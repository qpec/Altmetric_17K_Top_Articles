Abstract
Many antidepressants stimulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but the mechanisms by which 
they increase neurogenesis and modulate behavior are incompletely understood. Here we show 
that hippocampal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is modulated by antidepressant 
treatment, and that the changes in BMP signaling mediate effects of antidepressant treatment on 
neural progenitor cell proliferation and behavior. Treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor fluoxetine suppressed BMP signaling in the adult mouse hippocampus both by 
decreasing levels of BMP4 ligand and increasing production of the BMP inhibitor noggin. 
Increasing BMP signaling in the hippocampus via viral overexpression of BMP4 blocked the 
effects of fluoxetine on proliferation in the dentate gyrus and on depressive behavior. Conversely, 
inhibiting BMP signaling via viral overexpression of noggin in the hippocampus or infusion of 
noggin into the ventricles exerted antidepressant and anxiolytic activity along with an increase in 
hippocampal neurogenesis. Similarly, conditional genetic deletion of the type II BMP receptor in 
Ascl1-expressing cells promoted neurogenesis and reduced anxiety- and depression-like 
behaviors, suggesting that neural progenitor cells contribute to the effects of BMP signaling on 
affective behavior. These observations indicate that BMP signaling in the hippocampus regulates 
depressive behavior, and that decreasing BMP signaling may be required for the effects of some 
antidepressants. Thus BMP signaling is a new and powerful potential target for the treatment of 
depression.
Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability1, with an estimated 
lifetime prevalence of approximately 10–20%.2, 3 Despite recent advances in our 
understanding of MDD, nearly one third of patients are refractory to antidepressant

 treatment.4 Thus, new molecular targets and treatment strategies are needed to address this 
disorder.
Antidepressant treatment in rodents and non-human primates increases proliferation and 
neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG)5–8 and inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis can 
prevent the behavioral effects of antidepressant treatment.9, 10 This suggests a causal link 
between increased hippocampal neurogenesis and antidepressant efficacy. Studies in humans 
have found that patients with MDD have reduced hippocampal volume.11–13 Moreover, 
patients with MDD treated with antidepressants have an increased number of neural 
progenitor cells in the DG compared to untreated patients,14 further supporting a link 
between hippocampal neurogenesis and depression.
In the adult hippocampus, BMP signaling regulates multiple phases of neurogenesis.15 
BMPs are extracellular ligands which bind to heterotetramers of type I and type II BMP 
receptor (BMPR) subunits16 leading to phosphorylation of Smads 1, 5, and 8 which then 
translocate to the nucleus to induce changes in gene expression.17 In the adult DG, BMP 
signaling promotes quiescence of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells 
(NPCs), and inhibition of BMP signaling results in NSC activation and increased 
neurogenesis.15, 18 Inhibition of BMP signaling in mice results in improved performance on 
hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks19 and can reverse some cognitive deficits associated 
with aging.20 While many exogenous factors in the DG stimulate hippocampal 
neurogenesis,21 BMP signaling conversely diminishes neurogenesis and provides a 
mechanism for allostatic control of the neurogenic process.
Given the critical role of BMP signaling in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we 
hypothesized that it might also regulate anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and that 
neurogenic effects of antidepressants might be mediated, at least in part, by changes in BMP 
signaling. Here we show that antidepressant treatment reduces levels of BMP signaling in 
the adult DG and that overexpression of BMP4 blocks the effects of antidepressant treatment 
on behavior and hippocampal NPC proliferation. Further, inhibition of BMP signaling, 
either via overexpression of the BMP inhibitor noggin or conditional deletion of the BMP 
type II receptor in NPCs, reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors concurrent with an 
increase in levels of hippocampal neurogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy 
on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Northwestern 
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight to ten week old C57Bl/6 
male and female mice (Jackson Laboratory) were used for antidepressant treatment 
experiments as well as DG virus injection experiments. For antidepressant and virus 
injection experiments, animals were allocated to experimental groups by randomly assigning 
each cage to an experimental treatment. BMPRII floxed mice (BMPRIIfx/fx)22 were mated to 
mice containing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the Ascl1 
promoter (Ascl1-CreER™)23. To monitor Cre expression, these mice were crossed with

 Rosa-CAG-LSL-ZsGreen1 mice (RosaZG/ZG, Jackson Laboratory)24. Tamoxifen-induced 
ablation of BMPRII was performed at 8–10 weeks of age in BMPRIIfx/fx; Ascl1-CreER™; 
RosaZG/ZG mice. BMPRII+/+; Ascl1-CreER™; RosaZG/ZG littermates were used as controls. 
All mice were housed 3–5 per cage under a 14:10 hour light:dark cycle with ad libitum 
access to food and water.
Drug administration
Fluoxetine (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in saline and administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg 
via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection daily for 14 consecutive days. For bromodeoxyuridine 
(BrdU) labeling, mice received four consecutive i.p. injections of 50 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma 
Aldrich) at two-hour intervals and were sacrificed 24 hours after the first injection. For 
conditional deletion of BMPRII, tamoxifen was administered via i.p. injection at 180 mg/kg 
for five consecutive days.
Viral vector production and stereotaxic viral injection
The lentiviral vectors were produced as previously described.15 See Supplementary 
Materials and Methods for detailed procedures. Briefly, pBOB-IRES2-mCherry (LV-
Control), pBOB-secNoggin-IRES2-mCherry (LV-Noggin), or pBOB-secBMP4-IRES2-
mCherry (LV-BMP4) lentiviral vectors were generated and lentiviruses were used at a titer 
of 108 cfu/ml. Stereotaxic virus injections were performed using a stereotaxic frame (Kopf 
Model 900), a Micro 4 Microsyringe Pump Controller (World Precision Instruments), and a 
microsyringe (Hamilton) with a pulled glass pipette. Mice were anesthetized via isofluorane 
inhalation. 2µl of lentivirus were injected at a rate of 0.5µl per minute into the bilateral DG. 
Lentiviral infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and mice lacking successful 
virus infection in the bilateral DG were excluded from analysis.
Intraventricular infusion
Infusion experiments were performed with an Alzet pump as previously described.19 The 
pump delivered 50 ng/µl BMP4 (R&D), 50 ng/µl Noggin (R&D), or vehicle for 15 days at a 
rate of 0.25µl/hr.
Behavioral analysis
For all behavioral analyses, mice were transferred to the testing room at least one hour prior 
to testing for acclimation to the test environment. All behavioral apparatus were wiped with 
70% ethanol prior to each trial. The elevated zero maze (EZM) and open field (OF) tests 
were performed at the Northwestern University Behavioral Phenotyping Core Facility. 
Behavioral analyses were performed with the experimenter blinded to the experimental 
condition.
EZM—The EZM consisted of a 56 cm diameter round track divided into two closed 
quadrants separated by 180 degrees and two open quadrants separated by 180 degrees. The 
closed quadrants were enclosed by 15 cm high walls and the open quadrants had no walls. 
The maze was elevated 46 cm above the ground and testing was conducted under white 
light. The mouse was placed into a closed quadrant and behavior was video recorded for 5

 minutes. LimeLight software (Actimetrics) measured the percentage of time the mouse spent 
in open quadrants.
OF—The OF apparatus consisted of a 56 × 56 cm open arena with 30 cm high walls. The 
mouse was placed into the center of the arena and behavior was video recorded for 5 
minutes. LimeLight software (Actimetrics) measured the total distance traveled and the 
percentage distance traveled in the periphery and the 28 × 28 cm central area of the OF.
Tail Suspension Test (TST)—Tape was affixed to the mouse’s tail 2 cm from the tip and 
the mouse was suspended from a horizontal bar at a height of 30 cm. Cylindrical plastic 
tubes were placed at the base of the tail to prevent tail climbing. The mouse was suspended 
for 6 minutes and video recordings of the test were quantified by an observer blinded to 
experimental condition. The total time spent in an immobile posture and the latency to the 
first bout of immobility were measured.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were 
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then transferred to 30% sucrose for 24 hours. 
40µm-thick floating sections were obtained and immunohistochemical staining was 
performed using standard techniques. Primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-Ascl1 
(1:500, BD Pharmingen, 556604), mouse anti-BrdU (1:200, BD Pharmingen, 347580), goat 
anti-Dcx (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc-8066), mouse anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore, MAB377), and 
goat anti-Sox2 (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc-17320). See Supplementary Materials and Methods 
for detailed procedures.
Confocal imaging and quantification
Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 Confocal Microscope. Z-stacks of the DG 
were obtained (step size: 1 µm) using sequential scanning to prevent bleed-through between 
fluorophores. Six or more Z-stacks of equal thickness and equivalent rostrocaudal position 
were quantified for each sample. For viral injection experiments, only sections with 
confirmed infection in the DG were quantified. Stereological cell counting was performed 
using ImageJ software. For per volume quantification, cell counts were normalized to the 
volume of the DG granule cell layer. All imaging and quantification was performed blinded 
to experimental condition.
Protein extraction and western blotting
The DG was micro-dissected from adult mice as previously described.25 The tissue was 
mechanically homogenized on ice in T-per protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher) with 
Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher). Lysates were centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected for western blot analysis. Western blotting 
was performed using standard techniques. Primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-BMP4 
(1:1000, OriGene, UM500038), mouse anti-GAPDH (1:4000, Millipore, MAB374), rabbit 
ant-Id2 (1:200, Santa Cruz, sc-489), rabbit anti-noggin (1:2000, Millipore, AB5729), rabbit 
anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, CS9511), and rabbit anti-Smad1/5/8

procedures.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed via two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test or two-way 
ANOVA with Bonferroni’s paired comparisons test for correction for multiple comparisons, 
as indicated in the figures and text. GraphPad Prism 6 software was used for the analyses. 
Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and equality 
of variances was verified using the F-test of equality of variance. The significance threshold 
used was p<0.05. Sample sizes were chosen based on results from preliminary experiments. 
The exact sample size for each experimental condition is indicated in the results section, 
with n representing the number of individual animals analyzed. All data are reported as 
mean ± SEM.
Results
Fluoxetine treatment decreases BMP signaling in the adult DG
Given the critical role of BMP signaling in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis and the 
link between neurogenesis and antidepressant efficacy, we asked whether antidepressant 
treatment alters BMP signaling in the adult DG. To address this question, we treated 
C57Bl/6 mice with fluoxetine for 14 days and performed western blot analysis to quantify 
levels of BMP signaling molecules in micro-dissected DG (Figure 1a). BMP4 expression 
was significantly decreased in the DG of fluoxetine-treated mice (Figure 1b, c; Control 
1.0±0.08 n=8, Fluoxetine 0.78±0.06 n=8, p<0.05), and there was an increase in levels of the 
BMP signaling inhibitor noggin following fluoxetine treatment (Figure 1b, c; Control 
1.0±0.22 n=10, Fluoxetine 2.09±0.43 n=10, p<0.05). We observed a similar decrease in 
BMP4 expression in mice treated with imipramine (data not shown). The observed changes 
in BMP4 and noggin levels suggested that fluoxetine reduces BMP signaling in the adult 
DG. In fact, there was a nearly 50% reduction in levels of phospho-Smad1/5/8 in the 
fluoxetine-treated group (Figure 1b, c; Control 1.0±0.14 n=4, Fluoxetine 0.52±0.07 n=4, 
p<0.05) as well as reduction in expression of the BMP target gene Id2 (Figure 1b, c; Control 
1.0±0.09 n=8, Fluoxetine 0.69±0.09 n=8, p<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed 
that fluoxetine treatment for 14 days significantly increased the total number of BrdU+ cells 
in the DG (Figure 1d, e; Control 6948±1299 n=4, Fluoxetine 11472±1284 n=4, p<0.05), 
consistent with previous observations.5, 6 Taken together, these data indicate that fluoxetine 
reduces BMP signaling in the adult DG with an associated increase in proliferation.
BMP4 overexpression blocks the proliferative and behavioral effects of antidepressants
We next asked whether augmentation of BMP signaling in the DG would attenuate 
neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine treatment. We stereotaxically injected a 
lentivirus overexpressing the BMP ligand, BMP4, (LV-BMP4) or a control lentivirus (LV-
Control) into the DG and subsequently treated mice with fluoxetine or vehicle (Figure 2a). 
Affective behavior was assessed on the tail suspension test (TST) at day 20 post infection 
and mice received BrdU 24 hours prior to sacrifice to assess proliferation in the DG. The 
lentiviruses contained an mCherry fluorescent reporter, which allowed for verification of

 virus infection in the DG (See Supplementary Figure S1). BrdU+ cells were first quantified 
to analyze the effects on overall proliferation. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant 
effect of virus treatment (Figure 2c; F(1,30)=27.72, p<0.001), antidepressant treatment 
(Figure 2c; F(1,30)=7.545, p<0.05), and a significant interaction effect (Figure 2c; 
F(1,30)=4.815, p<0.05). Fluoxetine treatment significantly increased the number of BrdU+ 
cells in mice infected with LV-Control (Figure 2b, c; LV-Control+Vehicle 7785±623.9 n=10, 
LV-Control+Fluoxetine 14892±2496 n=9, Bonferroni’s test p<0.01). However, 
overexpression of BMP4 prevented a fluoxetine-induced increase in BrdU+ cells (Figure 2b, 
c; LV-BMP4+Vehicle 3369±487.4 n=7, LV-BMP4+Fluoxetine 4164±663.3 n=8, 
Bonferroni’s test p>0.05). We next quantified the number of BrdU+Sox2+ cells in the DG to 
assess effects on NPC proliferation. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant effect of 
virus treatment (Figure 2d; F(1,30)=21.94, p<0.001) and antidepressant treatment (Figure 2d; 
F(1,30)=5.325, p<0.05) on the number of BrdU+Sox2+ cells, and a significant interaction 
effect was also observed (Figure 2d; F(1,30)=4.247, p<0.05). Fluoxetine treatment increased 
the number of BrdU+Sox2+ cells in mice infected with LV-Control (Figure 2d; LV-Control
+Vehicle 4907±401 n=10, LV-Control+Fluoxetine 9817±1997 n=9, Bonferroni’s test 
p<0.01), but no such effect was observed in BMP4-overexpressing mice (Figure 2d; LV-
BMP4+Vehicle 1959±796.3 n=7, LV-BMP4+Fluoxetine 2236±447 n=8, Bonferroni’s test 
p>0.05), suggesting that BMP4 blocked the effects of fluoxetine on NPC proliferation. 
Furthermore, analysis of doublecortin-expressing (Dcx+) neuroblasts demonstrated a trend 
towards an increase in the number of neuroblasts following fluoxetine treatment in mice 
infected with control lentivirus. Viral overexpression of BMP4 in fluoxetine-treated mice 
reduced the number of Dcx+ cells below levels observed in fluoxetine-treated mice exposed 
to control lentivirus (Supplementary Figure S2).
In the TST, two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant interaction between fluoxetine 
treatment and virus treatment in both latency to immobility (Figure 2e; F(1,30)=4.789, 
p<0.05) and total time immobile (Figure 2f; F(1,30)=9.286, p<0.01). In mice infected with 
LV-Control, fluoxetine treatment resulted in an increased latency to immobility (Figure 2e; 
LV-Control+Vehicle 52.7±5.2 n=10, LV-Control+Fluoxetine 99.8±7.3 n=9, Bonferroni’s test 
p<0.001) and a decrease in total immobility time in the TST (Figure 2f; LV-Control+Vehicle 
146.5±9.7 n=10, LV-Control+Fluoxetine 72.5±10.1 n=9, Bonferroni’s test p<0.001), 
demonstrating the anticipated antidepressant effect. However, fluoxetine treatment had no 
statistically significant effect on BMP4-overexpressing mice in either the latency to 
immobility in the TST (Figure 2e; LV-BMP4+Vehicle 51.5±4.5 n=7, LV-BMP4+Fluoxetine 
72.1±6.3 n=8, Bonferroni’s test p>0.05) or the total immobility time in the TST (Figure 2f; 
LV-BMP4+Vehicle 129.8±30.5 n=7, LV-BMP4+Fluoxetine 124.7±13.8 n=8, Bonferroni’s 
test p>0.05), indicating that BMP4 blocked the behavioral effects of fluoxetine. No 
differences were observed between males and females in the effects of fluoxetine or BMP4 
on proliferation and affective behavior. (Supplementary Figure S3). Intraventricular infusion 
of BMP4 also inhibited the effects of fluoxetine on the TST (Supplementary Figure S4). 
Taken together, these results indicate that increased BMP signaling blocks the effects of 
fluoxetine both on proliferation in the DG and on behavioral performance in a test of 
depressive activity.

 The BMP inhibitor noggin promotes neurogenesis and alters affective behavior
In view of these findings, we next hypothesized that inhibition of BMP signaling in the DG 
would both increase neurogenesis and alter affective behavior. To test this hypothesis, we 
stereotaxically injected a lentivirus overexpressing the BMP inhibitor noggin (LV-Noggin) 
into the DG (Figure 3a). One cohort of mice was subsequently tested on the elevated zero 
maze (EZM) and the open field (OF), while a second cohort of mice was tested on the TST. 
Noggin overexpression led to a greater than two-fold increase in the number of doublecortin 
positive (Dcx+) neuroblasts (Figure 3b, c; LV-Control 58931±12726 n=5, LV-Noggin 
119743±2309 n=4, p<0.01), consistent with previous findings demonstrating an increased 
rate of neurogenesis in response to hippocampal noggin overexpression.15 Furthermore, 
noggin overexpression produced a comparable increase in neuroblast generation in both the 
dorsal and ventral DG (Supplementary Figure S1e). Behavioral performance on the elevated 
zero maze (EZM) was assessed at 14 days post infection. Noggin overexpression 
significantly increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the EZM (Figure 3d, 
e; LV-Control 12.24±2.65 n=8, LV-Noggin 28.49±5.47 n=6, p<0.05), suggesting a reduction 
in anxiety-like behavior. Examination of total distance traveled in the open field (OF) 
showed no difference in general locomotor activity between groups (Figure 3f; LV-Control 
3247±334.1 n=9, LV-Noggin 3553±313.3 n=6, p=0.54). There was also no significant 
difference observed in the percentage distance traveled in the center of the open field (Figure 
3g; LV-Control 13.97±2.28% n=9, LV-Noggin 15.54±1.94 n=6, p>0.05). Performance on the 
TST was assessed at 14 days post injection in a separate cohort of mice in order to assess 
depressive behavior. Noggin overexpression increased the latency to immobility in the TST 
(Figure 3h; LV-Control 37.7±4.3 n=13, LV-Noggin 53.3±4.2 n=12, p<0.05) and decreased 
the total immobility time (Figure 3i; LV-Control 176.8±9.6 n=13, LV-Noggin 149.3±8.4 
n=12, p<0.05), suggestive of an antidepressant-like effect. As an alternative approach, we 
next performed intraventricular infusion of noggin, which promotes neurogenesis and 
improves hippocampus-dependent cognition.19 Noggin or vehicle was infused into the 
lateral ventricles for 15 days and performance on the TST was assessed on day 15 (Figure 
3j). Noggin infusion led to a reduction in the total time spent immobile in the TST (Figure 
3k; Vehicle 111±19, Noggin 47.5±12), consistent with the viral overexpression results. 
Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of BMP signaling in the DG increases 
neurogenesis and produces an associated reduction in anxiety- and depression-like 
behaviors.
Inhibition of BMP signaling in NPCs promotes neurogenesis and reduces anxiety- and 
depression-like behavior
To assess whether inhibition of BMP signaling within the NPC population produces 
anxiolytic and antidepressant behavioral effects, we utilized a BMPRIIfx/fx; Ascl1-CreER™; 
RosaZG/ZG mouse line. This allowed for conditional ablation of the type II BMP receptor in 
Ascl1-expressing cells, which includes intermediate NPCs as well as a small subset of 
actively dividing NSCs in the DG and subventricular zone.26 These mice have a Cre-
responsive ZsGreen (ZG) reporter in the Rosa locus which allowed for fluorescent labeling 
of the recombined cells in which BMPRII was ablated. BMPRII was ablated via treatment 
with tamoxifen (Figure 4a). We have previously reported reduction of BMPRII expression in 
recombined cells in the DG using this protocol.15 To address the specificity of this Cre line,

 we evaluated ZG recombination in the DG and other brain regions. In addition to a high 
level of recombination in the subgranular zone of the DG, ZG+ cells were also observed in 
the subventricular zone neurogenic niche, and scattered ZG+ cells were observed in other 
brain regions, including the cortex27 (Supplementary Figure S5). Following short-term 
ablation, the majority of the ZG+ cells in the DG were progenitors of the granule cell 
neuronal lineage (Supplementary Figure S5b). Furthermore, the majority of both Ascl1-
expressing NPCs in the SGZ and total proliferating cells in the SGZ were ZG+, indicating 
successful targeting of the NPC population (Supplementary Figure S5c, d). At 16 days post 
injection, BMPRII ablation significantly increased the number of newborn neurons as 
assessed by the number of ZG+ cells expressing the neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 4b, c; 
WT 24600±2791 n=8, BMPRII KO 36424±4547 n=8, p<0.05), consistent with previous 
studies demonstrating enhanced maturation of NPCs into neurons in the absence of BMP 
signaling.15, 20 Behavioral analysis on the TST demonstrated that ablation of BMPRII 
increased latency to immobility (Figure 4d; WT 54.08±5.84 n=8, BMPRII KO 79.73±9.78 
n=8, p<0.05) and decreased the total time immobile (Figure 4e; WT 165±8.2 n=8, BMPRII 
KO 108.6±8.8 n=8, p<0.001). In the EZM, BMPRII ablation produced a trend towards an 
increase in the percentage of time spent in the open arms (Figure 4f; WT 29.42±2.88 n=8, 
BMPRII KO 36.17±2.12 n=8, p=0.08). Examination of total distance traveled in the OF 
showed no differences in general locomotor activity between groups (Figure 4g; WT 
2908±245.9 n=8, BMPRII KO 3170±237.1 n=8, p=0.46). Furthermore, BMPRII ablation 
increased the percentage distance traveled in the center of the open field (Figure 4h; WT 
13.0±1.6 n=8, BMPRII KO 18.3±1.9 n=8, p<0.05), which is suggestive of reduced anxiety-
like behavior. Lastly, performance on the TST was not affected by prior exposure to the 
EZM and OF, as demonstrated by the finding that ablation of BMPRII in a cohort of mice 
exposed only to the TST (Supplementary Figure S6) had similar behavioral effects on the 
TST as that observed in Figure 4. Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of 
BMP signaling in NPCs increases neurogenesis with an associated reduction in anxiety-and 
depression-like behavior.
Discussion
MDD is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume in humans11–13 and in 
hippocampal neurogenesis in animal models of this disorder.5–7 Hippocampal neurogenesis 
is decreased by stress and increased by chronic antidepressant treatment, raising the 
possibility that this process may be involved both in the pathogenesis and the treatment of 
MDD.8 Overexpression of the BMP antagonist, noggin, significantly increases neurogenesis 
in the DG whereas overexpression of BMP4 suppresses it.15 Further, noggin-overexpressing 
mice perform markedly better on tests of hippocampus-dependent cognition.19, 20 Since 
BMP signaling has such a major regulatory influence on neurogenesis and cognition, we 
asked whether BMP signaling regulates antidepressant activity. Here we demonstrate that 
BMP signaling is inhibited by fluoxetine, and prevention of this decrease via overexpression 
of BMP4 blocks effects of fluoxetine treatment on hippocampal neural progenitor cell 
proliferation and behavior. Further, inhibition of BMP signaling in the hippocampus 
produces an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis concurrent with behavioral reductions in 
anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Lastly, targeted inhibition of BMP signaling in Ascl1-

 expressing cells is sufficient to produce similar neurogenic and behavioral effects, 
suggesting that neural progenitor cells may play a key role in mediating the effects of 
reduced BMP signaling. The downstream targets of the BMP pathway that are required for 
the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of inhibition of BMP signaling are not yet 
known. However, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is a BMP target gene that 
modulates neurogenesis by regulating the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, and 
expression of p21 is reduced by antidepressants.28, 29 This suggests that p21 may be one of 
the key BMP target genes regulated by antidepressant treatment.
Hippocampal neurogenesis is increased by multiple different classes of pharmacologic 
antidepressants as well as non-pharmacologic treatments such as exercise, electroconvulsive 
treatment, and deep brain stimulation.5–7, 30, 31 This suggests that stimulation of 
neurogenesis may be a general mechanism that contributes to antidepressant efficacy. 
Notably, various signaling molecules stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis and produce 
antidepressant-like behavioral effects.32–35 However, the signaling pathways that provide 
negative feedback to maintain stability of the neurogenic process are less well described. 
Our observations suggest that BMP signaling provides a mechanism for allostatic control of 
neurogenesis and affective behavior. We observed a strong association between changes in 
neurogenesis and affective behavior following manipulation of hippocampal BMP signaling, 
suggesting that the behavioral effects of modulating BMP signaling are mediated through its 
effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. This is supported by the finding that inhibition of 
BMP signaling within Ascl1-expressing NPCs produces changes in affective behavior. A 
recent study showed that ablation of BMP signaling in post-mitotic neurons in the 
hippocampus and forebrain produced changes in exploratory behavior but did not alter 
depressive behavior,36 supporting the conclusion that NPCs are critical for the 
antidepressant-like effects of altered BMP signaling. However, causality in our study, as well 
as others that have linked neurogenesis and depression, remains to be fully ascertained. 
Furthermore, given that the Ascl1-CreER™ transgene expression is not exclusively 
restricted to the hippocampal NPC population, we cannot rule out the possibility that the 
behavioral effects of BMPRII ablation occurred secondary to blockade of BMP signaling in 
other cell populations. Furthermore, the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of BMPRII 
ablation were significant, but the degree of the effect was not as large as that observed with 
intraventricular infusion or viral overexpression of noggin. We hypothesize that this reflects 
the fact that intraventricular infusion and viral overexpression of noggin produce a profound 
increase in noggin expression in the DG and therefore theoretically reduce BMP signaling in 
all progenitor cells in the subgranular zone, whereas the tamoxifen-induced BMPRII 
ablation protocol only affects a subset of progenitors. It is alternatively possible that other 
cell populations in the DG besides the NPCs contribute to the behavioral effects of noggin 
overexpression. The heterogeneity of MDD implies that many neuronal circuits and 
signaling systems may contribute to its etiology.37 It is therefore likely that not all 
antidepressants produce comparable effects on BMP signaling and neurogenesis, but our 
findings support the conclusion that BMP signaling-mediated changes in hippocampal 
neurogenesis may be one potential mechanism of antidepressant activity.
Our data also demonstrated that overexpression of BMP4 alone markedly reduced 
hippocampal neurogenesis, but did not have an appreciable effect on depression-like

 behavior. BMP4 overexpression significantly reduced the total number of proliferating cells 
as well as the number of proliferating progenitor cells in the DG compared to control mice, 
consistent with previous studies showing that BMP signaling causes neural stem and 
progenitor cells to exit cell cycle.15, 20 Despite the reduction in hippocampal proliferation in 
BMP4-overexpressing mice, we did not observe an increase in depression-like behavior in 
these mice, which is consistent with previous studies which have shown that inhibiting 
hippocampal neurogenesis is not sufficient to induce a depression-like phenotype.9, 38–40 
Chronic stress produces a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis,41–43 raising the possibility 
that ablation of neurogenesis may increase the susceptibility to the behavioral effects of 
stress. Some studies have observed such an increase in stress susceptibility,44, 45 whereas 
others have reported that ablation of neurogenesis on its own does not produce an increased 
sensitivity to the behavioral effects of stress.6, 46 Our results on the overexpression of BMP4 
support the conclusion that stimulation of neurogenesis plays a key role in antidepressant 
efficacy, but that a reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not, by itself, sufficient to 
induce the onset of depressive symptoms.
In the dentate gyrus, functional differences have been observed along the dorsoventral axis. 
In particular, the ventral DG has been implicated in the mood regulatory function of the 
hippocampus, and studies have demonstrated a preferential decrease in neurogenesis in the 
ventral DG following stress.47 Furthermore, the ventral hippocampus displays enhanced 
connectivity with brain regions involved in mood regulation.48–50 In the conditional 
BMPRII ablation experiments, BMPRII was knocked out in both the dorsal and ventral DG. 
In the noggin and BMP4 virus overexpression experiments, virus infection was observed in 
the dorsal DG with extension into the ventral DG. Furthermore, no differences were 
observed in the degree of neurogenesis induction in the dorsal versus ventral DG following 
inhibition of BMP signaling. Therefore, the relative contribution of different regions of the 
DG to the behavioral effects of BMP signaling modulation cannot be delineated from these 
studies. In the lentiviral experiments, virus infection was observed in the ventral DG, but the 
virus did not consistently extend to span the entire length of the ventral DG. Therefore, 
future experiments to more specifically target the ventral DG could be performed to address 
the contribution of this subregion. Given prior evidence on functional dissociation along the 
dorsoventral axis, it is possible that inhibition of BMP signaling specifically in the ventral 
DG would be sufficient to produce antidepressant or anxiolytic effects. Alternately, it has 
previously been shown that neurogenesis in both the ventral and dorsal DG is required for 
behavioral effects of antidepressant treatment in specific stress paradigms,51 suggesting that 
both subregions of the DG may contribute to affective behavior in specific behavioral 
contexts. Future studies with targeted inhibition of BMP signaling in the ventral DG will 
therefore be necessary to address these questions.
Given that SSRIs increase serotonin levels via inhibition of serotonin reuptake, we 
hypothesize that 5-HT receptor activation may be responsible for the observed decrease in 
hippocampal BMP signaling following fluoxetine treatment. There are multiple serotonin 
receptors expressed in the adult dentate gyrus, including 5HT1AR, 5HT2CR, and 
5HT4R.52–54 In particular, 5-HT1AR has been implicated in the mechanism of action of 
SSRIs.9 Recent data has demonstrated that ablation of 5-HT1AR from dentate granule cells 
prevents fluoxetine-induced increases in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor

 (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the DG,53 suggesting that this 
receptor modulates gene expression and secretion from granule cells in response to SSRI 
treatment. We therefore hypothesize that fluoxetine-induced changes in BMP4 and noggin 
expression could be mediated by similar 5HTR-mediated modulation of gene expression 
from dentate granule cells or other cell populations in the hippocampal niche. Further, we 
hypothesize that targeting multiple signaling pathways could produce additive effects on 
both neurogenesis and depressive behavior.
Antidepressant treatment stimulates BDNF expression in the hippocampus55, 56 and 
modulation of BDNF or TrkB, a BDNF receptor, is sufficient to alter depression-like 
behavior.33, 57, 58 In the adult DG, BDNF increases survival of newly generated neurons.59 
Conversely, inhibition of BMP signaling causes hippocampal neural stem and progenitor 
cells to exit quiescence, leading to increased proliferation and a resulting increase in the 
number of neurons generated.15, 18 Therefore, inhibition of BMP signaling and BDNF 
stimulation could have additive effects on neurogenesis, with inhibition of BMP signaling 
increasing neuron generation and BDNF promoting survival of these neurons. In fact, 
concurrent overexpression of BNDF and noggin in the adult rat brain has an additive effect 
on the number of neurons generated from the subventricular zone60 and allows for sustained 
neuronal generation with long-term survival of newborn neurons.61 Similarly, the effects of 
noggin on hippocampal neurogenesis can be sustained long-term via environmental 
enrichment, an intervention that increases BDNF expression.20 Therefore, we hypothesize 
that targeting both the BDNF and BMP pathways may have additive effects on affective 
behavior, leading to improved antidepressant-like responses compared to either manipulation 
alone.
Data from the STAR*D trial has demonstrated that approximately two-thirds of patients with 
MDD don’t achieve remission of symptoms with first-line antidepressant treatment and 
nearly one-third of patients are refractory to all treatment strategies,4 indicating that there is 
substantial need for improved therapies. Here we show that the BMP signaling pathway is a 
potential new therapeutic target for MDD. Interestingly, the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine 
treatment decline with age,62 which parallels an age-related increase in BMP signaling.20 
However, inhibition of BMP signaling in aging mice both increases neurogenesis and 
prevents aging-related cognitive decline,20 raising the possibility that targeting BMP 
signaling may be a particularly effective antidepressant strategy for aged subjects.
In summary, hippocampal BMP signaling is reduced by treatment with the antidepressant 
fluoxetine. Overexpression of BMP4 specifically in the DG prevents both neurogenic and 
behavioral effects of fluoxetine treatment. Inhibition of BMP signaling, either via 
overexpression of the BMP inhibitor noggin or conditional genetic ablation of the type II 
BMP receptor in NPCs, both promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis and leads to a 
reduction in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. These studies highlight the importance 
of the BMP signaling pathway as a potential new target for antidepressant activity.

in expression of the BMP4 ligand and an increase in levels of the BMP inhibitor noggin 
following fluoxetine treatment. Levels of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and the BMP target gene Id2 
are reduced following fluoxetine treatment. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (c) 
Quantification of western blots by densitometric analysis indicates that there is a decrease in 
BMP signaling in the dentate gyrus of fluoxetine-treated mice. Values are normalized to 
loading control and expressed as relative fold compared to saline-treated control mice. n=4–
10 per group. (d) Immunostaining for DAPI (blue) and BrdU (green) shows that there is an

Quantification of the number of BrdU+ cells per mm3 in the dentate gyrus indicates that 
there is a 65% increase in the number of BrdU+ cells in fluoxetine-treated mice compared to 
controls. n=4 per group.

 Figure 2. Overexpression of BMP4 blocks proliferative and behavioral effects of antidepressant 
treatment
(a) Experimental paradigm: Control lentivirus (LV-Control) or a BMP4-overexpressing 
lentivirus (LV-BMP4) was stereotaxically injected into the dentate gyrus of wild type 
C57Bl/6 mice. Daily fluoxetine (or vehicle) treatment began on day 5 post-injection. 
Behavioral performance on the tail suspension test (TST) was performed on day 20 post-
injection. BrdU was administered 24 hours prior to sacrifice (Sac) to acutely mark the 
proliferating cell population and tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis on

 day 21. (b) Immunostaining for DAPI (blue) and BrdU (green) shows that there is an 
increase in proliferation in the dentate gyrus following fluoxetine treatment in mice infected 
with LV-Control (Control), but overexpression of BMP4 prevents the fluoxetine-induced 
increase in BrdU. (c) Quantification of the number of BrdU+ cells per mm3 in the dentate 
gyrus shows that there is over a two-fold increase in the number of BrdU+ cells following 
fluoxetine treatment but the effect of fluoxetine is blocked by overexpression of BMP4. 
n=7–10 per group. (d) Quantification of the number of BrdU+Sox2+ cells per mm3 in the 
dentate gyrus shows that the number of proliferating progenitor cells is elevated in 
fluoxetine-treated mice but the effect of fluoxetine is reduced by overexpression of BMP4. 
n=7–10 per group. (e) Fluoxetine treatment increased the latency to immobility in the TST 
and the effect of fluoxetine was blocked by overexpression of BMP4. n=7–10 per group. (f) 
Fluoxetine treatment decreased the total immobility time in the TST and the effect of 
fluoxetine was blocked by overexpression of BMP4. n=7–10 per group.

 Figure 3. The BMP inhibitor noggin increases neurogenesis and alters affective behavior
(a) Experimental paradigm: Control lentivirus (LV-Control) or a noggin-overexpressing 
lentivirus (LV-Noggin) was stereotaxically injected into the dentate gyrus of wild type 
C57Bl/6 mice. In one cohort of mice, behavior was assessed on the elevated zero maze 
(EZM) and open field (OF) tests on day 14 post injection. In a second cohort of mice, 
behavior was assessed on the tail suspension test (TST) on day 14 post injection. On day 16 
mice were sacrificed (Sac) and tissue was harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. (b) 
Immunostaining for DAPI (blue) and doublecortin (Dcx, green) shows that there is an

 increase in the generation of neuroblasts following noggin administration. (c) Quantification 
of the number of Dcx+ cells per mm3 in the dentate gyrus shows a greater than two-fold 
increase in neuroblasts in noggin-treated mice compared to controls. n=4–5 per group. (d) 
Representative path traces from the EZM demonstrate that there is a decrease in anxiety-like 
behavior in noggin-treated mice. (e) The percentage of time spent in the open arms of the 
EZM is higher in noggin-treated mice compared to controls. n=6–8 per group. (f) In the 
open field, no difference was observed in the total distance traveled by control and noggin-
treated mice. n=6–9 per group. (g) In the open field, no difference was observed in the 
percentage of distance traveled in the center of the arena. n=6–9 per group. (h) The latency 
to immobility in the TST was increased in noggin-treated mice. n=12–13 per group. (i) The 
total immobility time in the TST was decreased in noggin-treated mice compared to 
controls. n=12–13 per group. (j) Experimental paradigm: Mice were administered noggin or 
vehicle for 15 days via intraventricular infusion. Performance on the tail suspension test 
(TST) was assessed on day 15 and mice were sacrificed (Sac) on day 16. (k) Noggin 
infusion led to a reduction in the total time immobile in the TST. n=6–8 per group.

 Figure 4. Ablation of BMPRII in neural progenitor cells promotes hippocampal neurogenesis 
and reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors
(a) Experimental paradigm: BMPRIIfx/fx; Ascl1-CreER™; RosaZG/ZG mice (KO) were 
administered tamoxifen for five consecutive days in order to ablate the BMP type II receptor 
in neural progenitor cells. BMPRII+/+; Ascl1-CreER™; RosaZG/ZG littermates were used as 
wild type (WT) controls. Behavior was assessed on the elevated zero maze (EZM) and open 
field (OF) tests on day 14 and on the tail suspension test (TST) on day 15. On day 16 mice 
were sacrificed (Sac) and tissue was harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. (b)

 Immunostaining for the neuronal marker NeuN demonstrates that there is an increase in the 
number of recombined cells (ZG+) that have differentiated into neurons in the BMPRII KO 
mice compared to WT controls. (c) Quantification of the number of ZG+NeuN+ cells per 
mm3 in the dentate gyrus shows that there is an increase in neurogenesis in the BMPRII KO 
mice. n=8 per group. (d) Knockout of BMPRII increased the latency to immobility in the 
TST. n=8 per group. (e) Knockout of BMPRII decreased the total time spent immobile in the 
TST. n=8 per group. (f) The percentage of time spent in the open arms of the EZM is higher 
in BMPRII KO mice compared to BMPRII WT controls. n=8 per group. (g) No difference 
was observed between WT and BMPRII KO groups in the total distance traveled in the open 
field. n=8 per group. (h) In the open field, BMPRII knockout led to an increase in the 
percentage of distance traveled in the center of the arena rather than the periphery. n=8 per 
group.
