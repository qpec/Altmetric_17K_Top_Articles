IMPORTANCE Preclinical studies have shown that neurotrophic growth factors (NTFs) extend
the survival of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that the combined
delivery of these neurotrophic factors has a strong synergistic effect. We have developed a
culture-based method for inducing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to secrete neurotrophic
factors. These MSC-NTF cells have been shown to be protective in several animal models of
neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and possible clinical efficacy of autologous MSC-NTF cells
transplantation in patients with ALS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In these open-label proof-of-concept studies, patients
with ALS were enrolled between June 2011 and October 2014 at the Hadassah Medical Center
in Jerusalem, Israel. All patients were followed up for 3 months before transplantation and 6
months after transplantation. In the phase 1/2 part of the trial, 6 patients with early-stage ALS
wereinjectedintramuscularly(IM)and6patientswithmoreadvanceddiseaseweretransplanted
intrathecally (IT). In the second stage, a phase 2a dose-escalating study, 14 patients with
early-stage ALS received a combined IM and IT transplantation of autologous MSC-NTF cells.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were administered a single dose of MSC-NTF cells.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end points of the studies were safety and
tolerability of this cell therapy. Secondary end points included the effects of the treatment on
various clinical parameters, such as the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised score and the
respiratory function.

T
he biological mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis (ALS) are only partially understood, and
there is currently no effective treatment that can sig-
nificantly halt or reverse disease progression. Although neu-
rotrophic factors (NTFs) have been shown to extend the sur-
vival of motor neurons in ALS, peripheral administration of
single NTFs has not revealed any benefit.1,2 A more effective
approach might be direct delivery of multiple NTFs to the
central nervous system through transplantation of cells that
actively secrete these factors. Indeed, studies in animal mod-
els of neurodegenerative diseases have shown that NTF-
secreting cells induce neuroprotective effects.3-7
Systemic or intraspinal bone marrow or adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been re-
ported to delay motor neuron degeneration and improve mo-
tor performance in the mouse model of ALS.8-10 The benefits
of MSC treatment were attributed to significant upregulation
of various NTFs, especially the glial-derived neurotrophic fac-
tor (GDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor.8 In parallel, im-
munomodulation and increased neurogenesis were sug-
gestedasadditionalmechanismsforthesefavorableeffects.11,12
The outcome of pilot clinical studies of MSC therapy suggests
some neurological stabilization in patients with ALS13-16 and
possible neuroregeneration of the optic tracts in progressive
multiple sclerosis17 and in multiple system atrophy.18
Stem cell therapy has been pursued by us and others in
various neurological diseases as a novel means of promoting
regenerationandneuroprotection.13-19Mesenchymalstemcells
have become the most common type of adult stem cells used
in clinical trials owing to their safety profile and their immu-
nomodulatory and neuroprotective effects.20,21
Usingamedium-baseddifferentiationprocess,wehavein-
duced MSCs to become MSC-NTF cells, with markedly en-
hanced secretion of NTFs such as GDNF, brain-derived NTF,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte
growth factor.4-7 The protective effects of MSC-NTF cells in
animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, and the en-
couraging results of compassionate treatments, supplied the
rationale for investigating autologous MSC-NTF cell transplan-
tation in patients with ALS.
We conducted a phase 1/2 study of a single intramuscular
(IM) or intrathecal (IT) administration of autologous MSC-NTF
cells. Following a positive interim safety analysis performed
after completion of 12 of the targeted 24 patients, the trial was
transformed to a phase 2a dose-escalating study, by com-
binedIMandITadministrationoftheMSC-NTFcells.Thestud-
ies shared key design elements, including visit schedule and
activities, efficacy end points, and the major inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria, thus allowing their analysis as 1 study.
Methods
Study Design
Both parts of the trial were single-arm, open-label, proof-of-
concept studies that featured a 3-month run-in period, ad-
ministration of cells, and a 6-month follow-up period con-
ducted at the Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. The
2 stages of the trial were approved by the local ethics commit-
tee of the Hadassah Medical Center and by the National Eth-
ics Committee of the Israel Ministry of Health, conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and registered in
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01051882 and NCT01777646). The pa-
tients provided written informed consent.
Participants
For both stages of our trial, eligible participants were be-
tween 20 and 75 years of age, fulfilled the El-Escorial criteria22
for definite or probable ALS, and had a history of ALS of less
than2years’duration.BetweenJune2011andNovember2012,
12 patients were enrolled in the phase 1/2 part of the study. Of
these, 6 patients with baseline ALS Functional Rating Scale–
Revised (ALS-FRS-R) scores of more than 30 received cells IM
and 6 patients with more advanced disease (ALS-FRS-R score
<30and>15andforcedvitalcapacity[FVC]>50%)weretreated
IT. A planned interim safety analysis was performed after
treated patients completed the study protocol. This resulted
in the conversion of the study to a dose-escalating phase 2a
study. In the phase 2a part of the trial, 14 patients with base-
line ALS-FRS-R score greater than 30 and baseline FVC at least
50% were enrolled between December 2012 and October 2014
(Figure 1).
Procedures
The visit schedule consisted of a 3-month run-in period that
included a screening visit, an enrollment visit, and bone mar-
row aspiration and transplantation followed by follow-up vis-
its every 6 months after transplantation. Bone marrow was as-
pirated 2 months after the screening visit, and clinical-grade
MSC-NTF cells were manufactured by a current good manu-
facturing practice–compliant process in the clean room facil-
ity at the Hadassah Medical Center (Jerusalem, Israel) by Brain-
StormCellTherapeutics.Mesenchymalstemcellswereisolated

Key Points
Question: What are the safety and clinical effects of treatment
with mesenchymal stem cells induced to secrete neurotrophic
factors (MSC-NTF cells) in patients with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS)?
Findings: In 2 consecutive open-label studies, treatment of
patients with ALS with autologous MSC-NTF cells by intrathecal
(IT), intramuscular (IM), or combined (IT+IM) administration was
found to be safe and well tolerated. The rate of progression of
forced vital capacity and ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised
score in the IT (or IT+IM)–treated patients was reduced.
Meaning: Intrathecal and IM administration of MSC-NTF cells in
patients with ALS is safe with indications of possible, clinically
meaningful benefits.

complied with the release test specifications, which included
safety, potency (NTF secretion), and identity (surface marker
characterization).
In the first part (phase 1/2) of the trial, the MSC-NTF cells
were administered by IM injections at 24 separate sites to the
biceps and triceps (1 × 106 cells/site) or by IT administration
of 1 × 106/kg cells. In the second stage (phase 2a) of the study,
the patients were treated both IT and IM in 3 dosing cohorts
(low dose: 1 × 106 cells/kg IT and 24 × 106 cells IM; mid-dose:
1.5 × 106cells/kgITand36 × 106cellsIM;andhighdose:2 × 106
cells/kg IT and 48 × 106 cells IM). Following administration of
the MSC-NTF cells, the patients remained hospitalized for up
to 72 hours for observation of possible adverse events.
Peripheral blood samples obtained at visits 1, 4, 5, 7, and
10 were examined for various standard safety biochemical and
blood count parameters. Blood mononuclear cells were tested
by flow cytometry for the expression of several surface lym-
phocyte markers.
Muscle volume was determined at visits 1, 4, 5, 7 (only in
the second part of the study), and 10 by computerized analy-
sis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the left and
right arms with ScanIP 2012 Simpleware Ltd Software, using
the T1-weighted transversal sequence. The available scans for
each patient were analyzed and the resulting muscle vol-
umes were given in milliliters.
Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were re-
corded at monthly intervals from the bicep muscle. The elec-
trodes were fixed at the mid-distance between the elbow and
the shoulder (active) and at the elbow. Stimulation of the mus-
culocutaneous nerve was applied at the Erb point. For each

corded at the first visit and repeated thereafter. The CMAP am-
plitude was measured from peak to peak in millivolts.
Outcomes
Theprimaryendpointsoftheinvestigationwerethesafetyand
tolerability of a single IM or IT administration (phase 1/2) or
of combined IT and IM delivery (phase 2a). Secondary effi-
cacy end points included the rate of change in the ALS-FRS-R
score, obtained by an independent certified neurologist;
FVC21,22; and changes in muscle mass (estimated by 3-dimen-
sional MRI) and in CMAPs during the 6-month posttreatment
period compared with those in the run-in period.
Statistical Analysis
Parameters measured as changes over time were calculated as
simple linear regressions to compare the preintervention and
postintervention slopes of the ALS-FRS-R gradients and the
FVC. For the post hoc analysis, all patients who received IT ad-
ministration in the 2 studies, a piecewise linear model with a
random patient effect was used to compare the preinterven-
tion and postintervention gradients of ALS-FRS-R score and
FVC and to test for statistical significance.
Results
The eTable in the Supplement summarizes the participants’
demographic characteristics. Eleven of the 12 patients in the
phase 1/2 part of the study and 10 of 14 patients in the phase
2a stage completed all follow-up visits. No serious adverse
events were associated with IT, IM, or IT+IM administration
of MSC-NTF cells. In the phase 1/2 part, there was a single se-
rious adverse event (nephrolithiasis, unrelated to treatment).
A patient in the IT cohort withdrew consent after visit 7 and
later died of pneumonia related to disease progression. In
the phase 2a part of the trial, there were 2 deaths, which were
considered unrelated to the treatment: 1 involved a physician-
assisted suicide and 1 was due to a clearly defined (and unre-
lated-to-treatment) pathology (deteriorating chronic hypona-
tremia that resulted in cardiac complications).
Most of the observed adverse events were of grades I and
II and transient, appearing in close association with the ad-
ministration of MSC-NTF cells, lasting a few hours or up to 3
daysfollowingtransplantation(Table1).Theseincludedmainly
headache, fever, vomiting, leg and back pain, and neck stiff-
ness. There were no significant changes in any laboratory para-
meters, including blood counts, biochemistry, renal and he-
patic function, thyroid function, and urinalysis. Magnetic
resonance images of the arm muscles did not reveal any sig-
nificant pathology at the site of injection (neither infection nor
tumor formation) in any patient.
Neurotrophic growth factor secretion of the patients’cells
in the 2 studies was shown to be induced in the MSC-NTF cells
compared with the MSCs of the same patient prior to differ-
entiation (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Despite the differ-
ences in specific productivity, which are the results of patient-
to-patient variability, in all samples tested, MSC-NTF cells
secreted significantly more NTFs compared with the MSCs of
the same patient.
The rate of change in ALS-FRS-R score and FVC (percent-
age predicted) during the 6-month period following adminis-
tration of the MSC-NTF cells was compared with that of the
3-month run-in period. In the phase 1/2 part of the study, there
was an improvement in the mean monthly rate of progres-
sion of the ALS-FRS-R score and FVC in the IT cohort (from
−1.56 to 0.28 and from −3.5% to −2.3%, respectively), but not
in the IM-treated group (Figure 2A and Figure 3A). In the phase
2a stage of the trial, a more substantial improvement in the
monthly rate of decline of ALS-FRS-R score and FVC was ob-
served following MSC-NTF cell transplantation (from −1.4 to
−0.6 and −2.6% to 0.86%, respectively; Figure 2B and
Figure 3B). No clear dose effects were detected.
Because only IT-treated patients from both studies ap-
peared to experience systemic benefit, a post hoc compari-
sonwasmadebetweentheprogressionrateofALS-FRS-Rscore
and of FVC during the pretreatment vs the posttreatment pe-
riods for patients from both studies with 6 months of fol-
low-up who were treated IT or IT+IM, using a piecewise lin-
ear regression analysis with a patient random effect. This
analysis revealed a statistically significant improvement in the
rateofFVCprogression(P = .036;n = 15)andatrend(veryclose
to statistical significance) of improvement in the rate of ALS-
FRS-R score progression (P = .052; n = 15) for those with com-
plete follow-up.
An additional post hoc per-patient analysis of the rate of
disease progression in the same combined subgroup of pa-
tients (treated IT or IT+IM) was also performed. Patients who
demonstrated a posttreatment improvement in the slope of at
least 25%, to either ALS-FRS-R score or FVC compared with
the run-in period, were considered responders. Of those with
3 months of follow-up (n = 18), 78% (n = 14) were responders,
and of those with 6 months of follow-up (n = 15), 87% (n = 13)
were responders (Table 2). At 6 months after treatment, 80%
(n = 12) of the patients improved by more than 35% and 67%
(n = 10) by more than 50% to either ALS-FRS-R score or FVC
(Table 2).
In the phase 1/2 part of the study, an (expected) decline in
CMAPs during the run-in period was observed, which im-
proved after transplantation, especially in the IM-injected pa-
tients and in the right (injected) arm (eFigure 2A in the Supple-
ment). In the phase 2a stage, there was a similar indication of

a beneficial effect favoring the injected (right) arm (eFigure 2B
in the Supplement). Neither were statistically significant.
As expected, muscle atrophy progression was docu-
mented by MRI of the arm muscles in both parts of the trial.
In the first part of the trial, the data obtained were not suffi-
cient for meaningful comparisons owing to the lack of an ad-
equate number of quality MRI scans for analysis, and the fact
that the posttreatment scan was performed at day 1 after trans-
plantation (to detect possible local adverse effects) and was
greatly influenced by the changes in the degree of edema at
the site of injection. In the 2a trial, a difference in the progres-
sion of muscle volume loss between the right (injected) and
the left (noninjected) arm was observed (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). These findings are in agreement with the CMAP
data and indicate a trend toward a local effect of the trans-
plantation in the right arm.
The patients treated with MSC-NTF cells in our trial dem-
onstrated some systemic immunologic response to MSC-NTF
cell treatment. Patients in both parts of the study showed a
trend toward upregulation of the regulatory T-lymphocytes
(CD4+CD25+) for up to 3 months following transplantation
(eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
The current clinical trial consisting of 2 parts, a first-in-man
phase 1/2 study and a phase 2a dose-escalation stage, shows
that IT and IM injection of MSC-NTF cells in patients with ALS
is safe and well tolerated over the study follow-up period. Ad-
verseeventsthatwereconsideredrelatedtothetreatmentwere
mostly mild and transient and occurred close to the time of cell
administration. These findings match previous observations
of treatment with MSCs in a variety of diseases, including
ALS.13-19 Although our study was primarily targeted to assess
safety and not powered for efficacy, the data also provided
some indications of clinically meaningful beneficial effects in-
duced by the IT treatment with MSC-NTF cells. These are re-
flected by the slower rate of disease progression (assessed by
the changes in ALS-FRS-R score and FVC) during the 6 months
following transplantation vs the 3-month run-in period in this
patient subgroup. On the basis of an individualized per pa-
tient analysis, most of the IT- or IT+IM–transplanted patients
(89% at 3 months [n = 16] and 87% at 6 months [n = 13]) were
defined as responders (having a slower progression rate after

stem cells that have been induced under culture conditions to
produce NTFs, thus bearing the potential to support neuro-
nal survival (neurotrophic/neuroprotective effect) and to
modify the course of neurodegeneration in ALS.
The current trial is novel in 3 aspects. First, a new type of
autologous MSCs (MSC-NTF cells), developed using an inno-
vative medium-based technique to induce the secretion of
NTFs and thus increase their neuroprotective potential,3-7 was
applied clinically for the first time. Second, 2 unique routes
of administration were used: a central one (directly to the ce-
rebrospinal fluid to circumvent the blood-brain barrier) and a
peripheral one into the muscles. Third, additional biomark-
ers were used for the quantitative measurement of progres-
sion of neurodegeneration and muscle atrophy: calculation of
muscle volume using 3-dimensional MRI and measurement of
the CMAP amplitude of the same muscles.
Stem cell–based therapies have been proposed as potential
treatments for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Small
clinical trials using adult stem cells in a number of neurological
diseaseshavedepictedthesafetyofsuchtreatments.13-19 Inthe
MSC studies, immunomodulatory mechanisms have been sug-
gested to be central to the reported beneficial effects.19 Specifi-
cally for ALS, pilot trials using IT, intravenous and intraspinal
injection of MSCs, have shown the safety of the procedure par-
alleledbysomeweakindicationsofclinicalbenefits.13-16Itispos-
siblethatthebeneficialclinicaltrendsobservedinourstudymay
be attributed to the improved capacity of the MSC-NTF cells to
secreteNTFscomparedwithnaiveMSCs,thusexerting—atleast
theoretically—a more potent neuroprotective effect.
An additional explanation may be related to the immuno-
modulatory effects of MSC-NTF cells on central nervous sys-
tem microglial cells, especially in light of the observed up-
regulation of the regulatory cells in our study. Activation of
microglial cells results in the production of proinflammatory
mediators that are toxic to neurons and was suggested to con-
tribute to the pathology of ALS.23-26
SeveralstudieshaveshownthatMSCsinhibitmicroglialac-
tivation and are capable of reprogramming microglial cells into
anM2-likephenotypecharacterizedbyincreasedphagocyticac-
tivity and upregulated expression of anti-inflammatory
mediators.27,28
Additionally, the mode of administration of MSC-NTF cells
in our studies (especially the IT route) may be also crucial for
the observed therapeutic effect. Intrathecal transplantation,
as previously advocated and applied by our group14,29 brings
the cells in closer proximity to extensive areas of the central
nervous system and in particular to the lower motor neuron
cell bodies. Prior clinical trials with single NTFs in ALS relied
on peripheral delivery.1,2 Given the very short half-life of these
growth factors when administered peripherally, the subopti-
mal clinical effects in those trials do not necessarily rule out
the potential therapeutic benefits of NTFs in ALS.30 Thus, in
our study, we were able to safely deliver a cellular source of
NTFs to the subarachnoid space. Indeed, IT administration of
MSCs previously showed neuroprotective effects in animal
studies and in clinical trials.31,32 The rationale for IM admin-
istration of MSC-NTF cells was based on the notion that ini-
tial stages of ALS involve degeneration of nerve terminals in
the neuromuscular junction area, and the “dying-back
phenomenon.”33 Muscle-derived transgene GDNF signifi-
cantly delayed the onset of disease and increased the life span
of G93A-SOD1 mice.34 Intramuscular transplantation of MSCs
engineered to secrete GDNF or VEGF was shown to synergis-
tically improve the clinical course of ALS in an animal model
and ameliorate motor neuron loss.35 We previously reported
that IM transplantation of muscle progenitor cells, which over-
express NTFs, increases the lifespan in SOD1 mice.36 Never-
theless, our current results showed that IM administration in-
duced only a minor local effect in patients with ALS.
The limitations of these open-label studies were the small
numberofpatientsandthelackofacontrolplacebo-treatedarm.
Conclusions
The possible clinical benefits of our cell therapy may be ex-
plained by neuroprotective effects that resulted in improve-
ment in the progression rate of ALS-FRS-R score and FVC. The
observed posttransplantation progress rates differ from the ex-
pectedrateofprogressionreportedinnaturalcourseepidemio-
logical studies (of approximately 1 point in the ALS-FRS-R per
month)37; such degree of average progression rate was ob-
served in our patients during the 3-month run-in pretreat-
mentperiod.Rapidprogressionrates(of>0.5ALS-FRS-Rpoints
monthly) have been reported as bad long-term prognostic
indicators,38 suggesting that our cohort consisted of patients
with rather aggressive disease. According to the survey con-
ducted by Castrillo-Viguera et al,37 neurologists who treat pa-
tients with ALS believe that a 25% or more reduction in ALS-
FRS-R slope is of clinical significance.37 Therefore, the
importance of the observed modification of disease progres-
sion rate following MSC-NTF cell therapy in our pilot trials may
represent an indication of a clinically meaningful effect, pend-
ing further confirmation from the ongoing, double-blind pla-
cebo-controlled multicenter phase 2 clinical trial (clinicaltrials
.gov Identifier: NCT02017912).
