ABSTRACT
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the industrialized world and represents a tremendous social
and economic burden. As conventional therapies fail to provide a sustainable cure for most cancer
patients, the emerging unique immune therapeutic approach of bacteria-mediated tumor therapy (BMTT)
is marching towards a feasible solution. Although promising results have been obtained with BMTT using
various preclinical tumor models, for advancement a major concern is immunity against the bacterial
vector itself. Pre-exposure to the therapeutic agent under field conditions is a reasonable expectation and
may limit the therapeutic efficacy of BMTT. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential
of Salmonella and E. coli vector strains in na€
ıve and immunized tumor bearing mice. Pre-exposure to the
therapeutic agent caused a significant aberrant phenotype of the microenvironment of colonized tumors
and limited the in vivo efficacy of established BMTT vector strains Salmonella SL7207 and E. coli
Symbioflor-2. Using targeted genetic engineering, we generated the optimized auxotrophic Salmonella
vector strain SF200 (DlpxR9 DpagL7 DpagP8 DaroA DydiV DfliF) harboring modifications in Lipid A and
flagella synthesis. This combination of mutations resulted in an increased immune-stimulatory capacity
and as such the strain was able to overcome the efficacy-limiting effects of pre-exposure. Thus, we
conclude that any limitations of BMTT concerning anti-bacterial immunity may be countered by strategies
that optimize the immune-stimulatory capacity of the attenuated vector strains.

Introduction
Bacteria-mediated tumor therapy (BMTT) is a unique form of
immunotherapy and represents a promising strategy to target
solid tumors.1,2 Effective vector strains need to be deployed.
Accordingly, the research community has fostered potent bac-
terial vector strains of the genera Salmonella, Clostridia, Escher-
ichia and Listeria for more than a century. Many of the strains
derived over this period of time have been successfully applied
in preclinical and clinical trials.1,3-14
Bacteria as therapeutic agents exhibit many advantages over
conventional therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy: (i)
their unique ability to specifically colonize tumors from a dis-
tant site of inoculation allows targeting of nearly all tumors
present, including metastases. (ii) During the process of tumor
colonization, the bacteria overcome physiological barriers
which otherwise pose a limit to, for instance, chemotherapy.
(iii) Because of an intrinsic tumor colonizing ability, engineered
bacteria could be exploited as tumor targeting vectors for deliv-
ery of genetic cargo.2,15,16
Despite these advantages, the immune system of the host
could represent a major obstacle for BMTT. The intrinsic
efficacy of BMTT on the one hand relies on the capability of
the bacteria to induce, reactivate or amplify a preexisting
immune response against the tumor. In accordance, it was
shown that after systemic inoculation of bacteria, an initial
strong induction of the innate immune system takes place.
As such occurs, a resulting cytokine storm is required to initiate
bacterial tumor colonization. Subsequently, due to bacterial
adjuvant properties, an adaptive immune response consisting
of cytotoxic T cells is induced and responsible for tumor clear-
ance.17,18 In addition, recent studies indicate that Salmonella
and its effector molecules may act on and kill cancer cells
directly.10,19-22 To which extent direct effects or adjuvanticity
effectuate efficacy of BMTT remains presently elusive.
Thus, within the current study we aimed to address the open
question whether anti-bacterial immunity could interfere with the
therapeutic benefit of the bacteria in an immune competent host.

 conditions, should not be pre-exposed to the therapeutic bacteria
prior to treatment, humans, pets and livestock may already be sen-
sitized and thus exhibit immunity against the microorganisms.
Indeed, according to established statistics, approximately 20% of
the human population displays an active antibody titer against Sal-
monella.23 Similarly, many people ingest probiotic E. coli (e.g.
Mutaflor or Symbioflor-2) as treatment of gastrointestinal distur-
bances.24,25 Such prior encounters with bacteria that are related to
the therapeutic strains may prohibit success of BMTT.
The present study aimed to investigate the influence of pre-
exposure to S. Typhimurium or E. coli on the efficacy of BMTT
in a murine transplantable tumor model. In addition, we
explored the possibility to circumvent such potential immunity
against the vector using alternate routes of inoculation, by com-
paring intravenous (i.v.) with intratumoral (i.t.) infection. Our
results reveal that pre-exposure can indeed limit the efficacy of
standard E. coli or Salmonella applied via either route of inocu-
lation. As solution, we generated an optimized Salmonella
strain SF200 (DlpxR9 DpagL7 DpagP8 DaroA DydiV DfliF).
SF200 carries an optimized hexa-acylated Lipid A structure
because of the deletions DlpxR9 DpagL7 and DpagP8 (Supple-
mentary Figure S1). This structure is known to generate a max-
imally immune-stimulatory Lipid A moiety.26,27 Furthermore,
this strain harbors the aroA deletion, which we were recently
able to show to confer simultaneous attenuation and increased
immunogenicity.28 Finally, modifications of flagella synthesis
were introduced by the DydiV and DfliF mutations, which
result in constitutive expression of intracellular flagellin and
formation of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs).28-30 This strain
exhibited greater immunogenicity and was thus able to over-
come limits of pre-exposure in comparison to non-optimized
bacteria. From these data we conclude that pre-exposure to the
bacterial vector indeed represents an obstacle and serious con-
cern for BMTT. However, solutions can be found by an appro-
priate design of vector strains as demonstrated with SF200.
Results
Immunized tumor bearing mice are less sensitive to bacte-
rial infection: The influence of a bacterial pre-exposure on
BMTT susceptibility was investigated by treating na€
ıve
BALB/c mice with two doses of the corresponding bacteria
spaced one week apart. To this end, heat-inactivated S. Typhi-
murium UK-1 was administrated intravenously or live E. coli
Symbioflor-2 orally. To determine whether pre-exposure had
conferred immunity against a re-challenge, immunized CT26
tumor bearing mice were infected intravenously (i.v.) or
intratumorally with the corresponding bacteria (Fig. 1). In
general, pre-exposure reduced the severity of infection as
judged by the body weight loss and the general appearance of
the mice (Fig. 1). As expected, this effect was more prominent
for Salmonella compared to the probiotic E. coli strain as the
latter affects the mice only to a minor extend in the first place.
Interestingly, intratumoral (i.t.) rather than i.v. infection did
influence immunized mice to a lesser extent compared to
na€
ıve mice. This emphasizes the higher safety profile of this
route of inoculation as shown previously31 (Fig. 1A – F). To
exclude a strain specific effect, mice were immunized with
SF200 (DlpxR9 DpagL7 DpagP8 DaroA DydiV DfliF), and
challenged with either Wt or SF200, respectively. No signifi-
cant differences in mouse survival were observed between Wt
and SF200 immunization. Therefore, immunization with
UK-1 can serve to simulate pre-exposure conditions (Supple-
mentary Figure S2). In addition, health conditions of UK-1
immunized mice challenged with SL7207 demonstrated that a
general anti-Salmonella immunity had developed indepen-
dent of the immunizing Salmonella strain (Fig. 1B).
Beyond these macroscopic observations, the secondary infec-
tion induced a significantly decreased cytokine storm compared to
the primary infection as revealed by measuring TNF-a levels in
serum (Supplementary Figure S3). This also indicated that these
mice developed immunity towards the secondary bacterial infec-
tion. To corroborate these data, the tissue-distribution of the Sal-
monella variants SF200 and SL7207 was determined in na€
ıve and
immunized mice upon i.v. infection (Fig. 2). Both Salmonella
strains were equally affected by immunization. Pre-exposed mice
displayed 90% less splenic colonization by salmonellae (Fig. 2B)
and were less prone to splenomegaly as measured 6 dpi (Supple-
mentary Figure S4). Interestingly, although tumor colonization
was initially reduced in immunized mice, SF200 and SL7207
reached similar colonization levels 48 hpi independent on the
immune state of the mice and the route of administration (Fig. 2D
and Supplementary Figure S5). Altogether, these results demon-
strate that pre-exposure simultaneously improves the safety and
decreases the immune pathology elicited by the bacteria. There-
fore, it may also limit the efficacy of BMTT by these bacteria. For
such reasons, we further tested our new strain SF200, which was
developed for improved performance in BMTT.
Pre-exposure influences the tumor microenvironment upon
BMTT: To extend our analysis of SF200, immune histology was
performed on CT26 tumors upon intravenous and intratumoral
infection (i.v., Fig. 3 and i.t., Supplementary Figure S6). As
expected, tumor bearing na€
ıve mice developed necrosis and hyp-
oxic regions by 24 hours post infection (hpi) independent on the
route of inoculation (Supplementary Figure S7 for i.v. infection
and Supplementary Figure S8 for i.t. infection). This was even
more prominent at 48 hpi. Necrotic areas were extensively colo-
nized by salmonellae. Moreover, granulocytic neutrophils were
abundantly present in the interphase between viable and necrotic
tissue. These phenotypic characteristics were very similar to our
previous findings.32 However, while the microscopic profile of
tumors from na€
ıve mice upon i.t. and i.v. infection appeared
identical (Supplementary Figure S7 and S8), the tumors of
infected immunized mice generally displayed a profile different
from the former tumors. Sparse necrotic areas and less neutro-
phil infiltration were found and the bacteria were distributed all
over the cancerous tissue (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that
immunization affects the tumor microenvironment and might
influence the efficacy of BMTT. However, intratumoral infec-
tions appear to be less sensitive to this effect of pre-exposure.
Pre-exposure affects the efficacy of non-optimized strains
upon infection: As the microenvironment of the tumor is
altered also after application of SF200, the pre-sensitized host
response to bacterial infection could limit the potency of
BMTT. To this end, na€
ıve and immunized CT26 tumor bearing
mice were intravenously infected with 5�106 Salmonella var-
iants or 5�107 E. coli Symbioflor-2 (Fig. 4). As expected, most
tumors of na€
ıve mice regressed and were cleared by 14 dpi
e1382791-2
S. FELGNER ET AL.
 (Fig. 4A – C). However, E. coli Symbioflor-2 and the Salmonella
variant SL7207 partially lost their ability to clear tumors in
immunized mice in contrast to na€
ıve mice (Fig. 4D – E). In
case of infection with E. coli, 20% of the tumors regrew and in
case of application of SL7207 only a single tumor out of five
was cleared. Thus, immunization seriously limits the therapeu-
tic benefit of these vector strains. In contrast, the optimized Sal-
monella strain SF200 was able to clear all CT26 tumors also
under immunized conditions (Fig. 4F). This suggests that the
increased immunogenicity of SF200 may compensate for the
immunity induced by pre-exposure.
The negative influence of immunity was substantially more
pronounced when the bacteria were administered intratu-
morally (Fig. 5). Both, E. coli Symbioflor-2 and Salmonella
SL7207 lost more than 50% of their efficacy for tumor
clearance in immunized mice compared to na€
ıve mice
(Fig. 5D – E). In contrast, the efficacy of the optimized Salmo-
nella variant SF200 was not affected by pre-exposure of the
mice to Salmonella and all CT26 tumors were cleared within
14 dpi (Fig. 5F). Importantly, when such SF200 treated, pre-
sensitized tumor-bearing mice – that had cleared the CT26
tumor – were followed for more than 200 days post treat-
ment, no tumor relapses occurred.
We next wanted to establish that despite of anti-salmonellae
immunity an immunological memory against the CT26 tumor
had been established as shown before by T-cell transfer experi-
ments.31 We therefore performed a re-challenge experiment
with CT26 cells. When CT26 cells were injected in such mice,
no CT26 tumor formation could be observed on mice that
received SF200 before while the unrelated control tumor RenCa
showed uninhibited growth (Supplementary Figure 9). These
results demonstrate that independent of the route of inocula-
tion, highly potent vector strains are required to overcome the
bacterial immunity in the host and to retain therapeutic effi-
cacy. Otherwise the benefit observed under na€
ıve conditions
may be lost in a pre-sensitized population.
Superior immune induction by SF200 in pre-sensitized
mice: In order to elucidate putative reasons for the superiority
of SF200, cytokine profiles of tumors of na€
ıve and immunized
mice were analyzed 48 h after infection with SL7207 or SF200
by multiplex analysis (Fig. 6). In total, 23 cytokines were ana-
lyzed. Interestingly, for SF200 infected tumors, the cytokine
profile was similar in na€
ıve and immunized mice. In contrast,
for SL7207 infected tumors, the cytokine levels of e.g. IL-1b,
IL-6 or TNF-a were significantly lower in tumors from immu-
nized mice compared to tumors from na€
ıve mice. This indicates

ıve and immunized CT26 tumor-bearing mice were infected intrave-

 that the optimization that led to SF200 (and which are missing
in SL7207), may compensate for the effect of pre-immuniza-
tion. This might explain the therapeutic differences displayed
in.Fig. 4 and 5 To confirm the immunogenic superiority of
SF200, we also analyzed the cytokine profile induced in
RAW264.7 macrophages as well as in sera of tumor bearing
mice and compared it to an infection by UK-1 WT bacteria
(Supplementary Figure 10). Again, SF200 demonstrated ele-
vated cytokine levels in comparison to WT bacteria. These
results demonstrate that the genetic modifications incorporated
into SF200 significantly increased the immunogenic potency
and the therapeutic power of this strain.
Live bacteria are required to counter immunity after pre-
exposure: A fundamental question remains to be addressed in
BMTT: can the therapeutic effect of bacteria be separated from
traits
like
tumor
colonization,
bacterial
persistence
and
viability? We recently demonstrated that single doses of LPS or
heat-inactivated Salmonella are sufficient to induce an effective
anti-tumor response in the CT26 tumor model.33 As the new
optimized vector strain SF200 was well tolerated after pre-
exposure, we wondered whether inactivated bacteria would
also be sufficiently potent to clear CT26 tumors. Thus, SF200
was heat-inactivated at 56�C and the inoculum controlled for
viability via plating. To evaluate the potency of these heat-inac-
tivated bacteria, na€
ıve and immunized CT26 tumor bearing
mice were treated intravenously and intratumorally with this
preparation (Fig. 7). As expected, all tumors were cleared by
heat-inactivated SF200 upon i.v. infection in na€
ıve mice
(Fig. 7A). However, application of heat-inactivated bacteria i.t.
reduced the efficacy of SF200 already (Fig. 7B). Importantly,
while
live
SF200
were
able
to
clear
all
tumors
in
immunized mice, the heat-inactivated variant lost this capabil-
ity (Fig. 7C – D). 56% of the tumors were cleared upon i.v.
administration, only 33% when applying the bacteria i.t. These
results demonstrate that genetically optimized bacteria need to
be alive to counter the induced anti-bacterial immunity after
pre-exposure. The adjuvant effect of heat-inactivated bacteria
per se does not provide a sufficient stimulus for a successful
BMTT under these conditions.
Discussion
Due to their pathogenic and immunogenic nature, bacteria are
exploited as versatile vehicles for vaccination and therapy such as
BMTT. In BMTT, bacteria have been demonstrated to selectively
target cancerous tissue, most likely by a passive mechanism.34

mined by plating over the course of infection. Displayed are values of mean § SD of four replicates in each group. The inset in Fig. 2D displays enlarged the numbers of

 However, it remains elusive to which extent the intrinsic ability of
bacteria to induce anti-tumor activities relies on direct effector
mechanisms of the bacteria such as for instance cytotoxicity, or on
an exclusive immune stimulatory adjuvant effect (e.g. cytokine
storm and/or T cell activation). For instance, it was recently
reported that Salmonella can exhibit direct effects on the tumor
microenvironment by modifying cellular transport mechanisms.
However, these effects were only effective in combination with che-
motherapeutics.22,35 Thus, the direct effects on the therapeutic ben-
efit of BMTT remains ambiguous.
In contrast, the adjuvant effect of bacteria is well char-
acterized. It is known that bacteria elicit a strong cytokine
storm that causes stress to the tumor microenvironment.
A common phenotype is formation of necrosis and, poten-
tially, release of tumor-antigens. Accordingly, cytotoxic T-
lymphocytes are induced and are able to eradicate the
tumor.18 Therefore, the immune system of the host plays
an essential role in BMTT. This conclusion could also be
drawn from clinical trials. Patients that had already been
subject to chemotherapy were generally less susceptible to
BMTT, even though the therapeutic strains deployed had
previously displayed potency in a number of pre-clinical
animal models.36,37 One could speculate that the weakened

 conditions would generally not support BMTT anymore in
terms of efficiency.
Apart from chemotherapy, accidental or intentional expo-
sure to phylogenetic relatives of the therapeutic bacteria such
as Salmonella or E. coli causes immunity in patients. Therefore,
a pre-exposed patient may become less responsive to the bacte-
rial therapy. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence
of such pre-exposure on BMTT. As such, pre-exposure gener-
ally greatly affected the mice and also the therapeutic effective-
ness of BMTT. As expected, mice which had previously
encountered the bacteria were less sensitive to secondary
infections independent of whether the bacteria had been
administered systemically or directly into the tumor. Pre-expo-
sure also led to a significantly reduced cytokine response upon
secondary exposure as determined by TNF-a levels in blood.
Further, pre-exposure limited bacterial survival in vivo and
reduced bacteria induced inflammation upon secondary infec-
tion. These observations highlight the importance of in-depth
knowledge of the immunological background of patients before
assigning a particular treatment. For instance, vaccination
against salmonellae is often used to protect individuals that
travel to endemic countries. Suspensions of probiotic E. coli are

 used to treat disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Although
immunity may be transient, protection often lasts for several
years before the host again displays sensitivity.38 During this
time, efficacy of BMTT with non-optimized bacteria may be
limited due to a protective memory response.
TNF-a is a key mediator in BMTT. It induces necrosis in
large parts of the tumor upon systemic infection. When we ana-
lyzed the tumor microenvironment under immunity condi-
tions, using immune histology, we found decreased TNF-a
levels, in accordance with prior findings.17 Interestingly, immu-
nity tremendously limited the extent of necrotic regions within
the tumor. In addition, the typical appearance of infected
tumors with salmonellae surrounding the necrotic area was
also absent under these conditions. However, intratumoral
application of bacteria was less prone to these alterations. A
possible explanation for this observation could be that intratu-
morally administered bacteria are not exposed to the effector
mechanisms of the immune system to a similar extent as during
systemic administration. Although tumor colonization was
indistinguishable between the two routes of injection after one
week, we show that a hampered initial tumor colonization in
immunized mice could explain the difference in histological
observations. Upon systemic injection, fewer bacteria may ini-
tially reach the tumor because of a reduced cytokine response
under immunity conditions. However, tumor invasion by
merely a few bacteria is sufficient to ensure rapid bacterial pro-
liferation to 109 bacteria per gram tissue after 48 hpi, as we
have demonstrated in a recent study.31 We conclude that
tumors represent an immune-privileged niche that can be filled
to a specific level dependent on the bacterial species. This also
implies that a strong immune induction by the bacteria is ini-
tially required to obtain a potent anti-tumor effect that leads to
clearance of the tumor rather than an efficient early tumor col-
onization. This could explain why a pre-sensitized mouse is
less susceptible to bacterial cancer therapy using conventional
strains.
However, the BMTT efficacy of our newly optimized Salmo-
nella vector strain SF200 (DlpxR9 DpagL7 DpagP8 DaroA
DydiV DfliF) was not affected under these circumstances. All
tumors were successfully cleared, independent of the route of

 inoculation and immunization status. We constructed this
strain modularly based on previous results28,39 The homoge-
nously hexa-acylated Lipid A structure resulting from muta-
tions DlpxR9 DpagL7 DpagP8 renders the LPS molecule ideal
as ligand for the TLR4-MD2 complex and is maximally
immune-stimulatory.26,27 The aroA deletion globally affects
bacterial gene expression, and in particular two differentially
expressed genes (arnT and ansB) are involved in the immune
escape of Salmonella.28 The modifications affecting flagella syn-
thesis and assembly resulted in improved immunogenicity and
increased formation of OMVs. The DydiV deletion deregulates
flagella synthesis under in vivo conditions and the DfliF muta-
tion prevents assembly of the flagellar export apparatus.28-30
However the detailed molecular mechanism that improves bac-
terial performance still remains elusive.
Despite the lack of a precise mode-of-action, we were able to
demonstrate that these optimizations made in SF200 result in a
highly immunogenic strain that is superior to Wt and SL7207
regarding immunogenicity and safety. These optimizations
were even sufficient to counter the effects of immunity and tol-
erance against the vector. The cytokine pattern in the tumors
was almost identical in na€
ıve and immunized mice. For
instance in contrast to SL7207, the levels of IL-1b or TNF-a
remained high in the tumors of immunized mice after infection
with SF200. As IL-1b and TNF-a have been shown to play an
important role during oncolysis,40-42 our finding underscores
the potency of SF200 for BMTT.
Surprisingly, tumor colonization itself may not be the driv-
ing factor for therapeutic efficacy. Both, SL7207 as well as
SF200 colonized to tumor to the same extend independent of
the immune status. Rather the immunogenic potential of the
individual strain is decisive as indicated by the effect of immu-
nity on the cytokine pattern elicited by the two strains. As both
strains harbor an aroA deletion, the optimization of the Lipid
A regarding TLR-4 affinity and activation, the changes to TLR-
5 signaling by the flagella modifications and the OMV produc-
tion may be reasons why SF200 is superior to SL7207 with
regard to efficacy.26 As the level of cytokines usually correlates
with the activation of the immune system and the tumor
stroma, it will be crucial to analyze infiltrating immune cell and
tumor microenvironment in the future. In addition, it would be
also interesting to compare the therapeutic efficacy of SF200 to
other important Salmonella strains in the field of BMTT like
A1-R43-49 or the recently described and optimized ppGpp
mutant.40,50
In summary, modifications of bacterial associated immuno-
genicity factors are able to compensate anti-bacterial immunity
caused by pre-exposure, and otherwise interfering with the effi-
cacy of non-optimized strains such as SL7207. Thus, it
strengthens our concept that it is not only sufficient to attenu-
ate a bacterium but also necessary to improve its immune stim-
ulating character at the very same time.1 Apparently, this holds
true even more in pre-exposed hosts. In this context, one could
consider additional intrinsic improvements but also solutions
comprising immune stimulatory genetic cargo.51-56
Genetically engineered bacterial strains always raise the
question of safety. A major open question was whether live bac-
teria are essentially required under pre-sensitized conditions or
whether heat-inactivated variants with optimized immune
stimulatory structures like pathogen associated molecular pat-
terns (PAMPs) would be sufficient for therapy. An advantage
of heat-inactivation is safety of treatment as already W. Coley
demonstrated more than hundred years ago showing that heat-
inactivated bacteria can still be effective.57,58 Thus, SF200 was
heat-inactivated and used for therapy. Interestingly, in na€
ıve
mice, heat-inactivated bacteria retained effectiveness against
CT26 tumors, confirming observations with other types of bac-
teria.31 However, heat-inactivated bacteria completely lost their
efficacy in immunized mice. These experiments clearly demon-
strate that PAMPs are able and sufficient to affect tumor
growth in na€
ıve hosts, however that pre-exposure to the same
bacteria counteracts their effect. In conclusion, live bacteria are
most likely required for successful tumor therapy in a pre-sen-
sitized patient population. The exact reason why live bacteria
are more potent remains unclear. We speculate that they are
capable of stimulating the immune system at different levels
than heat-inactivated bacteria. For instance, the type III secre-
tion system and its effector proteins are only active in vivo in
live bacteria.59 Thus, their stimulative features may be missing
in heat-inactivated bacteria. In addition, colonization and pro-
liferation of live bacteria may provide a continuous stimulus
unlike the case with heat-inactivated bacteria.
Taken together, a significant proportion of the human
population exhibits an active titer against infectious agents.
The efficacy of BMTT can be extremely limited when
patients have encountered phylogenetic relatives of the ther-
apeutic bacterial vector prior to treatment. We were able to
demonstrate that the limitations conferred by bacterial
immunity can be overcome by targeted genetic manipula-
tion to increase the immune-stimulatory capacity of the
bacterial vector strain used. Thus, the concern that pre-
exposure represents a major disadvantage of BMTT can be
countered using effective strategies including rational bacte-
rial strain design and may facilitate reliability of BMTT in
the near future.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement: All animal experiments were performed
according to guidelines of the German Law for Animal Protec-
tion and with permission of the local ethics committee and the
local authority LAVES (Nieders€
achsisches Landesamt f€
ur Ver-
braucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit) under permission
number 33.9-42502-04-12/0713.
Strains and preparation of inoculum: Bacterial strains are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. Salmonella and E. coli
strains were grown overnight and sub-cultured to mid-log
phase in LB media at 37�C. Symbioflor-2 was adjusted as
described previously.5 In general, the bacteria were washed
twice and adjusted to the desired OD600 in pyrogen free PBS.
For heat-inactivation, bacteria were incubated at 56�C for one
hour. Plating the inoculum served as control.
Murine tumor model: Six to seven week old BALB/c mice
(Janvier) were intradermally inoculated with 5�105 syngeneic
CT26 tumor cells (colorectal cancer, ATCC CRL-2638) in the
right flank. Tumor development was monitored using caliper
measurements. Upon reaching a tumor volume of approx.
150 mm3 after 10 days, the mice were injected intravenously
ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
e1382791-9
 into the tail vein or directly into the tumor with 5�106 Salmo-
nella and 1�107 E. coli, respectively.
Immunization: Mice were immunized twice 5 and 4 weeks
before tumor inoculation. For Salmonella, 5�106 heat-inacti-
vated S. Typhimurium UK-1 wild-type bacteria were used to
immunize the mice using an intravenous route of inoculation.
For E. coli, mice were orally administered by gavage with 5�108
E. coli Symbioflor-2.
Therapeutic benefit and bacterial burden: Tumor devel-
opment was monitored using caliper measurements for as
long as tumors persisted or until confronted with a humane
endpoint in terms of exceedingly large tumor size (» 1
cm3) or morbidity. Body weight as general health indicator
was monitored using a scale. A loss of body weight below
80% of the original body weight was incentive to euthanize
a subject. To determine the bacterial burden, blood, spleen,
liver and tumor tissue were harvested at 7 days post infec-
tion and treated as described previously.17 CFUs were deter-
mined by serial plating.
Histology: Mice were treated i.v. with pimonidazole 30 min
before sacrifice. Tumor specimens were fixed with 4% (v/v) for-
malin for 24 – 48 h, embedded in paraffin. Approximately
3 mm thick sections were stained with hematoxylin/ eosin
according to standard laboratory procedures. Immuno-histo-
chemical staining was performed using the following antibod-
ies:
rabbit-anti-pimonidazole
(HP3-100kit,
Hydroxyprobe
inc.), rabbit-anti-MPO (Medac/ Thermo Scientific), rabbit-
anti-salmonella (US Biological) and DAB (3,3-Diaminobenzi-
dine Zytomed Systems DAB530) as chromogen. Hematoxylin
was used for counterstaining. Sections were analyzed by light
microscopy blinded to the experimental groups.
Electron microscopy: SF200 was cultured in 5 ml LB over-
night. On the next day, 650 ml glutaraldehyde (cf D 2%) was
added to fixate the bacteria. For scanning electron microscopy
fixed samples were placed onto poly-L-lysine coated cover slips
(12 mm in diameter), dehydrated with a graded series of ace-
tone, critical point dried with CO2 and sputter coated with
gold-palladium. Samples were examined in a Zeiss Merlin
(Oberkochen, Germany) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV
using the Everhart-Thornley SE-detector and the Inlens SE-
detector in a 25:75 ratio. Contrast and brightness were adjusted
with Adobe Photoshop C5.
TNF-a ELISA measurement in serum: Blood samples were
collected 1.5 h post infection. The TNF-a ELISA MaxTM Stan-
dard Kit (Biolegend) was used to determine the TNF-a level in
serum. All steps were done according to the manufacturer’s
manual. Three different biological replicates were analyzed and
a PBS treated group served as negative control.
Cytokine, chemokine and growth factor detection in super-
natants, sera and lysates: Cytokine, chemokine and growth
factor concentrations in supernatants of 264.7 RAW macro-
phages cells (6 hpi with MOI 10), sera (1.5 hpi, 6 hpi and 24
hpi) or tumor tissues (48 hpi) were quantified by the Luminex-
based multiplex technique according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Bio-Rad, USA). The tumor homogenate was
adjusted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml using a Lowry-
assay. Standard curves and concentrations were calculated with
Bio-Plex Manager 6.0, the detection sensitivity of all proteins
was between 1 pg/ml and 40 mg/ml.
Statistics: Significance between two groups was determined
using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, while one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni posttest was
used to compare two or more groups. Significance levels of
p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001 were denoted with asterisks:
�, ��, and ���, respectively.
