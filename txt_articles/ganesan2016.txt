Abstract 
Background: Although proof-of-concept for mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle programs 
targeting physical inactivity and overweight/obesity has been established in randomized trials, 
the feasibility and impact of globally distributed, large-scale mass-participation mHealth 
implementation has not been investigated. 
Objective: To determine the impact of Stepathlon, an international low-cost mass-participation 
mHealth intervention, on physical activity, sitting and weight.  
Methods: The study was an analysis of prospectively collected cohort data from participants 
completing Stepathlon, an annual 100-day global event in 2012, 2013, and 2014. 
(ACTRN12615001310550). Participants were organized in worksite-based teams, issued 
pedometers, and encouraged to increase daily steps and physical activity as part of team-based 
race. The program was conducted via an interactive multi-platform app available on mobile 
devices and the worldwide web. Analysis was performed according to a pre-specified plan. 
Results: N=69,219 subjects participated (481 employers, 1481 cities, 64 countries, all populated 
continents, age 36±9 years, 23.9% female, 8.0% high-income countries, 92.0% lower-middle 
income countries). After Stepathlon completion, participants recorded improved step count 
(+3519 steps/day 95%CI: 3484-3553, P<0.0001), exercise days (+0.89 days: 95% CI 0.87-0.92, 
P<0.0001), sitting duration (-0.74 hrs. 95%CI: -0.78 to -0.71, P <0.0001) and weight (-1.45kg, 
95%CI:-1.53 to -1.38, P <0.0001). Improvements occurred in women and men, in all geographic 
regions, and in both high and lower-middle income countries, and reproduced in 2012, 2013, 
2014 cohorts. Predictors of weight loss included step increase, sitting duration decrease, and 
increase in exercise days. (all P <0.0001). 
Conclusion: Distributed mHealth implementation of a low-cost lifestyle intervention is 
associated with short-term reproducible large-scale improvements in physical activity, sitting and 
weight.

Physical inactivity, sedentary behavior and obesity are increasingly recognized as 
growing contributors to the global burden of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
as well association with excess mortality (1,2). The increasing global presence of internet 
technology, with more than 3.2 billion users (3), and in particular the dynamic growth of mobile 
broadband, which now has 47% penetration (3), provides a powerful new potential pathway to 
enable low-cost distributed implementation of lifestyle interventions in diverse geographic and 
sociocultural settings (4,5). 
A growing body of evidence in randomized settings arising from proof-of-concept type 
studies has demonstrated that mobile health (mHealth)-based lifestyle programs and workplace-
pedometer programs may be a useful strategy to achieve modest but statistically significant 
improvements in physical activity, sitting, and weight (6-11). To date, such studies of mHealth 
and workplace lifestyle interventions have predominantly been conducted at limited scale in 
relatively targeted populations (7,12,13), with nearly all analyses focused towards single high-
income countries (6,13,14). 
At the current time, however, it remains unclear whether improvements in physical 
activity and weight with mHealth interventions seen in randomized trials will be translated when 
conducted as large-scale, mass-participation programs, using “real-world” participants. The 
potential power of mHealth technology, however, lies in its capacity for inexpensive 
geographically distributed implementation. It is unclear whether mHealth technology utilization 
for lifestyle change will be feasible or efficacious when conducted internationally, including 
large numbers of participants from both high-income (HIC) and low- and middle-income 
countries (LMIC) (5). mHealth-based distribution of preventive health lifestyle strategies may be

especially advantageous in LMIC settings, in the context of the rising burden of cardiovascular 
disease morbidity in these nations (15). 
To address the global population-level burden of physical inactivity, there is a clear need 
to develop mass-participation interventional programs with the capacity for geographically 
distributed implementation. To achieve such large-scale international mass participation, it may 
be important that such programs utilize appropriate and accessible technologies, are attractive to 
consumers, and of sufficiently low cost to enable self-financed growth. 
In the current study, we sought to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of Stepathlon, a 
low-cost pedometer-based workplace physical activity and wellness program, which utilized 
mHealth technology-based approach to facilitate large-scale implementation and program 
delivery. The program was conducted annually as a 100-day event in the years 2012-2014. Light 
weight, low-cost, non-interactive pedometers were used as a self-monitoring and motivational 
tool (16) with the aim of encouraging participants to increase step counts and physical activity. 
The objective of the study was to determine the impact of Stepathlon participation on step 
counts, sitting duration and weight. 
Methods 
The study was conducted as an academic-private partnership between researchers at 
Flinders University and University of Adelaide, and Stepathlon Private Limited, a start-up 
company based in Mumbai, India. The project research protocol was reviewed and approved 
with a low-risk waiver by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Adelaide, 
Australia. Data was provided on an unrestricted basis by Stepathlon for the purposes of scientific 
research, and analyzed according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. The project was

registered in the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
(ACTRN12615001310550). 
Stepathlon Program 
The Stepathlon is a 100-day international event based around participation of employees 
in a workplace-based pedometer program. The Stepathlon was conducted annually, with 
employee participants organized into teams of 5 individuals, to provide a supportive social 
environment to facilitate activity. Participants were issued with low-cost, light weight 
pedometers to monitor daily step counts. Pedometers used in Stepathlon used 3-dimensional 
piezoelectric accelerometer technology to increase accuracy of step count recordings. The 
pedometers were non-interactive and did not have the capacity to communicate electronically 
with mobile devices or the internet. Participants were encouraged to increase incidental activity 
such as using stairs and avoidance of sitting. For participants who undertook other physical 
activity (e.g. swimming, cycling), walking step equivalents were computed from American 
College of Sports Medicine Compendium of Exercises (17). 
Participants were encouraged to enter daily activity into the Stepathlon website. 
Interaction with the website was conducted via downloadable mobile device app, available on 
multiple platforms, or available via the internet for users without mobile broadband access. The 
website was constructed to facilitate motivation and engagement of participants. The site 
featured personalized tools for self-monitoring including personalized logs of exercise, physical 
activity and dietary intake. Encouragement emails were sent daily to all participants. The content 
of emails included message about physical activity and nutrition. Supplementary 
communications with participants were structured to in a way to encourage engagement. For 
example, email messages were sent to participants at individual milestones, but also triggered by

team milestones. The messaging was also designed to be entertaining. For example, simple 
quizzes and competitions were used as a way to encourage interaction with the online interface. 
The website included updating content with articles on nutrition and lifestyle, and featured a 
social network an online community of participants, with users posting comments on 
participation. Interactive advice and expert guidance on lifestyle and physical activity was 
available through an online chat facility. The overall 100-day step count challenge was 
conducted as a race between teams of 5 participants, to maximise social leveraging towards 
physical activity. In the race, cumulative team steps were converted to distances in kilometres, as 
part of a team-based race around a virtual world map. Competition occurred between teams both 
within the same employer, and with teams outside the same employer. A leaderboard was visible 
in the user interface to enable participants to see team data from the top teams, but individual 
participant data was not shown publicly on the user interface. A series of screenshots is provided 
in the Online Appendix to show examples of the online user interface. 
Program Participants and Data Collection 
Stepathlon program participants included adult employees of private and public sector 
organizations located in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Australia and 
New Zealand. Costs for employee participation were borne by the employers, with the cost of 
participation modest (approx. $US50 per participant in India, and $US 60 outside India). The 
data for the current study were prospectively collected via web-based physical activity and 
lifestyle survey questionnaires completed by participants before and after the 100-day Stepathlon 
event. Items on the questionnaire related to basic demographic information (e.g. age, gender, 
city, country) as well as personal activity and lifestyle information. Participants were mailed 
pedometers and login details for the Stepathlon mobile device app/website approximately 1-2

weeks prior to event commencement. The website for baseline data collection opened in the 1 
week prior to the event commencement. Baseline data collection was compulsory for entry into 
the Stepathlon event. Completion surveys were completed approximately 1-2 weeks following 
completion of the Stepathlon event. 
Statistical Analysis 
The pre-specified endpoints of the current study were the impact of Stepathlon on 
physical activity, as measured by step count change and sitting duration change, and weight in 
kilograms, assessed with linear regression models. Models were fitted to estimate the difference 
between pre-intervention and post-intervention characteristics. For all outcomes, linear 
regression models were fitted, with a generalised estimating equation to account for repeated 
measures, and including interaction terms to investigate potential effect modification by gender, 
age, year cohort, geographic region and income group. If an interaction term was non-significant, 
it was dropped from the model and main effects estimated; otherwise, separate estimates of 
effect of time by level of the effect modifier were obtained. Because step count is an ordinal 
variable (with categories consisting of 2500-step increments starting from <5000), it was also 
modelled using ordinal logistic regression as an additional sensitivity analysis; similarly, 
Exercising Days is a count variable (number of days per week) and was also modelled using log 
Poisson regression. Because the conclusions from these models were similar to those from the 
linear regression models, the latter are presented for reasons of interpretability. The relationship 
between weight change and other outcomes (change in step count, sitting duration and exercise 
days) was explored using univariate linear regression. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata 
version 13. Significance was set at 2-tailed alpha<0.05.

Over the 3 years from 2012-2014, 69,219 participants completed the pre-event 
questionnaire, and of these 36,652 completed the post-event questionnaire (53.0% response rate). 
Comparison of baseline demographic and physical activity characteristics of completing and 
non-completing participants is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Participants were recruited from 64 
countries, from 481 employers, in 1481 cities, on all continents. The largest participant countries 
were India (62414 participants, 90.2%), Australia (3459 participants, 5.0%, New Zealand (789 
participants, 1.1%), Singapore (439 participants, 0.6%) (Table 1). The distribution of 
participants by World Bank geographic region and income level is also shown (Table 1) (18).  
Impact of Stepathlon Participation on Step Count 
The distribution of participants by step count category before and after Stepathlon 
completion is shown in Figure 1 and Table 3. Overall, the step count was found to increase by 
+3519 steps per day (95%CI 3484, 3553, P<0.0001, Figure 1, Figure 2A, Table 3), when 
modelled as a continuous variable. Similar increases were found in women (+3159 steps per day, 
95%CI: 3086, 3232,  P<0.0001), men (+3398 steps per day, 95%CI: 3356, 3440, P<0.0001), 
each of the year cohorts (all P<0.0001, Figure 2A). To confirm this conclusion, step count was 
modelled as a categorical variable with an ordinal logistic regression (Online Appendix 2A). 
Impact of Stepathlon on Exercise Days and Exercise Duration  
Overall, there was an improvement of +0.89 exercise days per week after Stepathlon 
(95%CI, +0.87, +0.92 days, P<0.0001) (Figure 2B). Improvements in exercise days per week 
were seen in women, men and in all years (Figure 2B, Table 3). Exercise duration was reported 
on a 2-point ordinal scale with categories of <30 minutes per day, or ≥ 30 or more minutes per 
day. Stepathlon completion was associated with an improvement in the odds of exercising ≥ 30 
minutes per day of 1.65 (95%CI 1.61, 1.68, P<0.0001) (Online Appendix 2B).

Impact of Stepathlon Participation on Sitting Duration 
Overall, there was a decrease in sitting hours post Stepathlon participation of -0.74 hrs. 
(95% CI: -0.78, -0.71, P<0.001, Figures 1 and 2C, Table 3). Similar reductions in sitting 
duration were seen in women, men and each of the year cohorts (all P<0.0001) (Figure 2C). 
Statistically significant reductions in sitting duration were seen in all geographic regions and 
across all income levels (Figure 2C). 
Impact of Stepathlon Participation on Weight 
Overall there was a reduction in weight post-Stepathlon participation of -1.45 kg (95%CI: 
-1.53, -1.38, P<0.0001, Figure 1, Figure 2D). Significant reductions in weight were seen in 
women (-0.74kg, 95%CI: -0.91, -0.57, P<0.0001), men (-1.63kg, 95%CI:-1.72kg,-1.53kg, 
P<0.0001) and in each of the year cohorts (all P<0.001) (Figure 2D). Weight reduction was seen 
in the South Asian, East Asian, North American (all P<0.0001), Middle East Regions (P=0.0003) 
and European regions (P=0.00085) (Figure 2D). Weight reduction was seen in Lower Middle 
Income, Upper Middle Income, and High Income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries (Figure 2D). 
Predictors of Weight Change 
Step count increase was associated with improvement in weight (+1 category of step 
count increase was associated with a weight decrease of -0.23 kg (95%CI,-0.12,-0.26, P<0.0001)

Discussion 
The current study demonstrates the feasibility of implantation and delivery of a low-cost, 
global mass participation workplace-based pedometer and wellness program, delivered 
electronically to an internationally distributed “real-world” participant base. The efficacy of the 
program is demonstrated by modest, year-by-year reproducible statistically significant 
improvements in short-term measures of physical activity, sitting and weight, seen in women and 
men, in a variety of geographic and economic settings from both high-income and low-to-
middle-income countries (LMIC). The study demonstrates the capacity of endogenous 
innovation in LMIC to develop low-cost, internationally applicable mHealth programs. Finally, it 
demonstrates that the modest benefits in physical activity and weight change seen randomized 
settings, may be able to be translated to an international setting. 
To date, evaluations of workplace-based pedometer mHealth programs have 
predominantly been conducted in HIC, with few large-scale outcome data available from LMIC 
settings (6,11,19,20). The enormous global scale of the crisis of physical inactivity, sedentary 
behaviour and excess weight suggests a need for mass-participation lifestyle interventions 
implementable in both HICs and LMICs. It is important therefore that mHealth lifestyle 
interventions are perceived not only be to be attractive and effective to participants around the 
world, but implemented at sufficiently low cost to enable sustainable demand-driven growth in 
both the developed and developing world. 
The advent of the internet age, and in particular the broad global penetration of mobile 
device technology (3), offers a new potential paradigm, by enabling global large- scale, 
distribution and implementation of low-cost self-financing lifestyle programs. To date, the 
majority of studies evaluating mHealth lifestyle interventions have been conducted at a relatively

small scale compared to the current study, typically in small numbers of sites, most often in 
single countries (4,6,7,9,11,21,22). Indeed, the total number of subjects in Stepathlon 
significantly exceeded total participant counts in previous meta-analyses of workplace (10,11,14) 
and mHealth interventions (7,9). To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the feasibility and 
efficacy of any comparable low-cost workplace-based distributed mHealth intervention 
implemented at this scale. 
The Stepathlon was designed as a workplace exercise and wellness program with the 
objective of distributed delivery in workplaces distributed across multiple countries. The 
workplace has long-been recognized as an important location for health promotion and the 
implementation of activity and wellness programs. The current program utilized a number of 
elements derived from previous studies of mHealth and workplace lifestyle interventions, to 
simplify implementation and increase accessibility. These included a centralized website (11), 
and the use of low-cost, non-interactive pedometer technology as a self-monitoring tool (14). 
Teams were used to facilitate social leveraging and camaraderie as means to reinforce messages 
regarding physical activity (23,24). Importantly, the cost of the program delivery to consumers 
was low, facilitating distributed implementation and demand-driven program growth, in both 
HICs and LMICs. 
The Stepathlon program demonstrated overall improvements in physical activity, sitting 
duration and weight of the modest magnitude, but consistent with those seen in previous meta-
analyses of workplace (11,14) and mobile-health interventions (7,9). Significantly, these effects 
were shown to be reproducible in the annualized cohorts studied in 2012, 2013 and 2014. 
The mechanism of physical activity and weight changes seen in Stepathlon is unclear. 
However, it seems most likely to be multifactorial, with improvements occurring due to a 
 MANUSCRIPT

combination of  the effects pedometers as a self-monitoring tool, social leveraging by the use of 
teams in a workplace environment, and the use of mHealth technology to provide a tool to 
engage participants with information and encourage behavioral change. The critical 
technological aspects of the interface to optimize engagement remain and improve outcomes 
remains an area for future investigation. 
A specific consideration is the mechanism responsible seen for reductions in weight seen 
with Stepathlon. The relative contribution of increased physical activity and reduced dietary 
caloric intake in weight loss interventions remains incompletely understood (25-27). The 
Stepathlon intervention, although primarily a physical activity intervention, did include 
messaging about nutrition and diet in the user content. In Stepathlon, a modest relationship was 
seen at the population-level between increased physical activity measures of steps/exercise days 
and sitting with reduced weight, with insufficient information was available to formally assess 
dietary change, however, the changes in weight seen seem most likely to have occurred due to a 
combination of physical activity and dietary modification. 
Rates of Attrition 
Although attrition rates were significant in Stepathlon, they are in line with comparable 
lifestyle interventions (28-30). The level of attrition seen in Stepathlon should be interpreted in 
the context of large numbers of “real-world” participants who did in fact complete the program, 
demonstrating the capacity of the program to lead to improvements in large numbers of 
participants. The levels of attrition seen in the Stepathlon program are, to some extent, not 
entirely unexpected, and perhaps represent an important opportunity for future mHealth 
innovation to achieve improved participant engagement and program adherence via utilization of 
contemporary advances in “big data” and web analytics (31). Importantly, the data demonstrate

the feasibility of mHealth technology to achieve scalable large-scale implementation across 
diverse geographic and sociocultural settings, with growth sustained by consumer demand. 
Implications for mHealth  
The current study has a number of important implications for the development and study 
of mHealth-facilitated lifestyle programs. The study provides confirmation in a large and highly 
heterogeneous participant population of previous data supporting the use of mHealth to facilitate 
improvements in physical, activity and weight. The modest but replicable effects on physical 
activity and weight, may, if sustained, could be anticipated to lead to large-scale improvements 
in absolute cardiovascular disease risk (32). Future investigations will be required to determine 
the long-term impact of the program. 
The study approach, conducted as an academic-private sector collaboration, is in line 
with the recommendation of the AHA mHealth Scientific Statement (12), which has called for 
more rigorous research to provide an improved evidence base in the mHealth sector. The current 
study contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of mHealth by providing an 
external scientific analysis of a large-scale multinational intervention. This type of study is 
needed to complement the growing body of mHealth data arising from interventions led or 
developed by health professionals in academic or clinical settings (12). An important feature of 
the current study is the demonstration of the capacity for mHealth to provide an opportunity for 
low-cost development and innovation to occur in private sector LMIC settings. 
Implications for Public Health 
The study may have important implications for public health. In recent years, there has 
been growing recognition of the importance of physical inactivity, sitting and excess weight as 
key drivers of worldwide morbidity and mortality by their association with diabetes and

cardiovascular disease (1,2). Reversal of this trend will require development of new forms of 
physical activity intervention designed to influence large numbers of individuals to behavioral 
change towards movement and away from sedentary lifestyles. In practice, reaching large 
numbers of participants with supervised forms of exercise therapy faces significant challenges 
because of the time required per patient, and high cost (33). The current study demonstrates that 
utilization of mHealth technology at a large scale may be a potential way to inexpensively 
communicate messages about behavior change, in a way that could be effective in both high-
income and low-middle income country settings. 
Of specific concern is the impact of Stepathlon on short- and long-term cardiovascular 
disease risk. In Stepathlon, without direct measurement of clinical markers of risk such as blood 
pressure or cholesterol, we were unable to directly estimate the impact of behavioural change in 
physical activity and diet on long-term CVD risk profile. Future investigations will be needed, 
perhaps using recently developed lifestyle-based risk assessment models (32), to provide an 
estimate of CVD events prevented by changing lifestyle parameters. 
The current study may also have specific implications for cardiovascular and diabetes 
prevention in South Asia in particular. Urbanization and changing lifestyles with economic 
development are likely to be contributing to reductions in physical activity patterns in South 
Asian populations (34), a trend likely to be contributing to the increasing incidence of diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease (15,35). Large-scale technology-based physical activity interventions 
may be particularly important in overcoming this trend, because of the large and geographically 
dispersed populations in this region.

The large-scale, low-cost geographically distributed implementation of the Stepathlon 
program constrained some aspects of the study design, in comparison with investigations 
performed in more conventional clinical or academic settings. The distributed participant base 
meant that the study could only be feasibly conducted as a pre- and post- comparison, without 
randomization or a comparator control group. An important limitation of the current study was 
that it was conducted with a relatively short-term follow-up. Long–term follow-up studies of 
comparable interventions, however, have demonstrated modest sustained improvements in 
lifestyle parameters and cardiovascular disease risk factors (36,37). Future studies involving 
follow-up of participants over multiple years, or with additional longer-term follow-up are 
needed to assess whether the short-term behavior changes seen with Stepathlon are maintained 
over time. The cost associated with the program introduces the possibility of selection bias 
associated with recruitment and participation. The reliance on self-report introduces the 
possibility of recall and social desirability bias. The international low-cost mass-participation 
aspect of the study precluded the use of individual supervision by a health professional, which 
has been shown to improve adherence. Nonetheless, despite these potential limitations, the study 
demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of an international mHealth intervention, by leading to 
modest but reproducible gains in physical activity measures and weight, occurring in diverse 
economic and cultural settings, in very large numbers of participants. 
Conclusions 
These data demonstrate that utilization of mHealth-based approaches may facilitate low-
cost and large-scale global implementation of a workplace physical activity intervention, leading 
to modest but reproducible short-term population-level improvements in step counts, exercise 
duration, sitting and weight.

Table 3-Pre- and Post-Stepathlon Physical Activity and Weight Characteristics  
Paired Pre- and Post- Stepathlon physical activity for Stepathlon participants is shown, in particpants who completed both pre-event in post-
event data collection. Information is shown for step count per day, exercising days per week, and sitting duration in hours per day, and weight. 
For step count, exercising days, and sitting duration, the number of participants in each category is shown, with the percentage in brackets. 
Comparison is made between pre-event and post-event in each year of the study.

Part 2-Additional Analyses 
 
Models were fitted with time-by-region or time-by-income group interaction term, adjusted for gender, age and year.Three-way-
interaction models were also investigated for gender (to see if gender difference in change over time differed by region) but the 
terms were non-significant so these were dropped from the model. 
All outcomes were fitted as continuous even though some outcomes were categorical or ordinal.  Sample size is large enough for 
the Central Limit Theorem to apply, meaning that test for differences in means are valid even where the outcome is not normally 
distributed. ‘timenum’ in model tables is variable to code for Stepathlon pre- and post- completion timepoints. ‘gendernum’ in model 
tables is a variable to code for gender.
