Abstract
It has been said that complexity lies between order and disorder. In the case of brain activity, and
physiology in general, complexity issues are being considered with increased emphasis. We sought to
identify features of brain organization that are optimal for sensory processing, and that may guide the
emergence of cognition and consciousness, by analysing neurophysiological recordings in conscious
and unconscious states. We fi
nd a surprisingly simple result: normal wakeful states are characterised
by the greatest number of possible confi
gurations of interactions between brain networks, representing
highest entropy values. Therefore, the information content is larger in the network associated to
conscious states, suggesting that consciousness could be the result of an optimization of information
processing.
These fi
ndings encapsulate three main current theories of cognition, as discussed in
the text, and more specifi
cally the conceptualization of consciousness in terms of brain complexity.
We hope our study represents the preliminary attempt at fi
nding organising principles of brain
function that will help to guide in a more formal sense inquiry into how consciousness arises from
the organization of matter

Introduction
How consciousness arises from the organization of matter is a subject of debate that spans several
disciplines, from philosophy to physics.
Multitude of studies focus on the investigation of patterns
of synchrony in brain activity based on magnitudes of a variety of synchrony indices, and thus the
search for organising principles of brain function is today more crucial than ever. We sought to identify
global features of brain organization that are optimal for sensory processing and that may guide the
emergence of conscious awareness. Our results provide a (very simple) answer to the question of what the
magnitudes of synchrony indices represent in terms of the structure of brain activity. Neurophysiological
recordings of brain activity demonstrate fl
uctuating patterns of cellular interactions, variability that
allows for a wide range of states, or confi
gurations of connections of distributed networks exchanging
information, and support the fl
exibility needed to process sensory inputs. Recent years have seen a surge
in the study of fl
uctuations in brain coordinated activity, studies that have raised conceptual frameworks

 such as that of metastable dynamics [1] and that have motivated interest in the practical application
of assessments of nervous system variability for clinical purposes [2, 3]. A prominent question is how
to describe the organizing principles of this collective activity, which allow features associated with
consciousness to emerge. What is the optimal brain organization that allows it to adequately process
sensory stimuli and enable the organism to adapt to its environment?
Previous studies have revealed values of different indicators of brain coordinated activity, such as
synchronization, associated with healthy and pathologic states by comparison of baseline values and
those in, for instance, unconscious states like coma and epileptic seizures [4, 5, 6]. These observations
prompt the question of what physiological organization underlies the specifi
c values of the synchrony
indices found in normal alert states and other conditions; in other words, what is special about these
values found in conscious states?
We believe that we have provided an answer to this question in
our work. We propose that there is a certain general organization of brain cell ensembles that will
be optimal for conscious awareness, that is, for the processing of sensory inputs. As an extension of
previous work [7] where it was proposed that a general organising principle of natural phenomena is
the tendency toward maximal – more probable – distribution of energy/matter, we venture that the
brain organization optimal for conscious awareness will be a manifestation of the tendency towards a
widespread distribution of energy (or, equivalently, maximal information exchange). Whereas we do
not deal with energy or information in our work, we instead focus on the number of (micro)states,
or combinations of connected signals derived from specifi
c types of neurophysiologic recordings. We
use the term “information”in the intuitive sense that normally permeates neuroscience: cell ensembles
that are functionally connected to process/exchange information; furthermore, the equivalence between
information exchange and energy transactions has been the subject of several studies, more specifi
cally
in [7] (see also [8, 9]). The question then becomes: how do we capture the nature of these organizations
of cell interactions?
We have followed the classic approach in physics when it comes to understanding collective be-
haviours of systems composed of a myriad of units: the assessment of the number of possible confi
g-
urations, or microstates, that the system can adopt. In our study we focus on the collective level of
description and assume that coordinated patterns of brain activity evolve due to interactions of meso-
scopic areas ( [10, 11]). Thus we use several types of brain recordings in conscious and unconscious
states, evaluating the number of “connections” between these areas and the associated entropy and
complexity. We present evidence that conscious states result from higher entropy and complexity in
the number of confi
gurations of pairwise connections. The number of pairwise channel combinations is
near the maximum of all possible confi
gurations when the individual is processing sensory inputs in a
normal manner (e.g. with open eyes). Our interpretation is that a greater number of confi
gurations of
interactions allows the brain to optimally process sensory information, fostering the necessary variabil-
ity in brain activity needed to integrate and segregate sensorimotor patterns associated with conscious
awareness.

Materials and Methods
Electrophysiological recordings
Recordings were analysed from 9 subjects, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), scalp electroen-
cephalography (EEG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG). Three epilepsy patients were studied with MEG;
2
 1 epilepsy patient was studied with iEEG; 3 epilepsy patients were studied with simultaneous iEEG
and scalp EEG; and 2 nonepileptic subjects were studied with scalp EEG. For the study of seizures
versus alert states, the 3 subjects with MEG recordings and the one with iEEG were used. Details of
the patients’epilepsies and seizure types have been presented in previous studies (MEG patients in [5];
iEEG patients in [12]). For the study of sleep versus alert states, the 3 patients with combined iEEG
and scalp EEG have been described previously (patients 1, 3, 4 in [13]); the 2 subjects studied with
scalp EEG alone had been investigated because of a suspected history of epilepsy, but both were ulti-
mately diagnosed with syncope, with no evidence of epilepsy found during prolonged EEG monitoring.
In brief, the MEG seizure recordings were obtained in one patient with primary generalized absence
epilepsy, in one patient with symptomatic generalized epilepsy, and in one patient with frontal lobe
epilepsy. The iEEG seizure recordings were obtained from a patient with medically refractory temporal
lobe epilepsy as part of the patient’
s routine clinical pre-surgical investigation. MEG recordings were
obtained using a whole head CTF MEG system (Port Coquitlam, BC, Canada) with sensors covering
the entire cerebral cortex, whereas iEEG electrodes were positioned in various locations including, in
the temporal lobe epilepsy patient, the amygdala and hippocampal structures of both temporal lobes.
EEG recordings were obtained using an XLTEK EEG system (Oakville, ON, Canada). The details of
the acquisitions varied from patient to patient (e.g., acquisition rate varied from 200 to 625 Hz) and
were taken into consideration for the data analyses. The duration of the recordings varied as well: for
the seizure study, the MEG sample epochs were of 2 minutes duration each, with total recording times
of 30-40 minutes; the iEEG patient sample was of 55 minutes duration. The sleep study data segments
were each 2-4 minutes in duration, selected from continuous 24-hour recordings.
Data analysis
The only pre-processed data were those of the scalp EEG recordings. These were processed using a
Laplacian derivation [11], to avoid the potential effects of the common reference electrode on synchro-
nization [14] using the DSC algorithm [15]. Initially a phase synchrony index was calculated from all
possible pairwise signal combinations, for which we use the standard procedure of estimating phase dif-
ferences between two signals from the instantaneous phases extracted using the analytic signal concept
via the Hilbert transform. To compute the synchrony index, several central frequencies, as specifi
ed
in the text and fi
gure legends, were chosen with a bandpass fi
lter of 2 Hz on either side, hence, for
one value of the central frequency f, the bandpass is f ± 2 Hz. The central frequencies were chosen
according to the relevant behavioural states and some analytical limitations–thus for the sleep studies
we choose 4 Hz (not lower because the extraction of the instantaneous phase was not optimal for central
frequencies lower than 4). To see whether similar results were obtained with different frequencies, we
chose others (see fi
gures) provided there was power at those values. The phase synchrony index (R)
was calculated using a 1-second running window and was obtained from the phase differences using
the mean phase coherence statistic which is a measure of phase locking and is defi
ned as R = |�ei∆θ�|
where ∆θ is the phase difference between two signals. This analytical procedure has been described in
great detail elsewhere [4, 5, 14]. The calculation of the index R was done for all possible signal pairs.
The mean value of the R index thus obtained was then estimated for the desired time length. For
instance, for the sleep recordings, the time period was the whole episode, which was, as noted above,
between 2 and 4 minutes. For the seizure recordings, the periods to obtain the mean synchrony varied
depending on the behavioural condition, for instance, in fi
gure 1C the whole ictal event (labelled ‘
Sz’
)
3
 and the initial 10-second portion of it (’
10 sec Sz’
) were taken for the reason explained in the text
and fi
gure legend. The calculation of the number of connected signals and the entropy associated is
described in the Results section. We note here that to assess entropy we assume that the different
pairwise confi
gurations are equiprobable, thus the entropy is reduced to the logarithm of the number
of states, S = lnC (see notation in the main text). However, the estimation of C (the combinations of
connections between diverse signals), is not feasible due to the large number of sensors; for example, for
35 sensors, the total possible number of pairwise connections is [1442] = 10296, then if we fi
nd in the
experiment that, say, 2000 pairs are connected, the computation of [102962000] has too large numbers
for numerical manipulations, as they cannot be represented as conventional fl
oating point values in,
for instance, MATLAB. To overcome this difficulty, we used the well-known Stirling approximation for
large n : ln(n!) = n ln(n)˘n. The Stirling approximation is frequently used in statistical mechanics
to simplify entropy-related computations. Using this approximation, and after some basic algebra, the
equation for entropy reads, S = N ln(N/N − p) − p ln(p/N − p), where N is the total number of pos-
sible pairs of channels and p the number of connected pairs of signals in each experiment (see Results
for details and notation). Because this equation is derived from the Shannon entropy, it indicates the
information content of the system as well (37).
In addition to entropy, we used another measure of complexity, the Lempel-Ziv (L-Z) complexity,
based in the Kolmogorov deterministic complexity [16]. This complexity measure the amount of non-
redundant information in a string by estimating the minimal size of the ”
vocabulary” necessary to
describe the string [17]. Strings with high L-Z complexity require a large number of different patterns
(“words”
) to be reproduced, while strings with low complexity can be largely compressed with a few
patterns employed to eliminate redundancy with no loss of information. For this purpose, values of
the matrix B (defi
ned in Results) were placed in a one-dimensional vector and its L-Z complexity
determined.

Result
Guided by proposals that consciousness requires medium values of certain features of cell assemblies,
e.g. not too high or low synchrony or correlations [18, 19, 3], or halfway between order and disorder [20],
we chose to quantify the number of possible confi
gurations the brain can adopt in different behavioural
conditions. Our basic approach consists in the estimation of the number of possible pairwise connections
between recorded brain signals. Signals included MEG, iEEG and scalp EEG recordings; details can
be found in Methods. We are limited to pairwise combinations of the signals because of the manner
in which phase synchrony is computed –as phase differences between two signals –and we use phase
synchronization as the means to determine “connectivity”between the two signals. Once the number
of “connected”signals is known, we estimate the entropy of those pairwise combinations. The results
obtained with recordings acquired during conscious states are compared with those acquired during
unconscious states, which included sleep (all stages) and epileptic seizures. To determine connectivity,
we use an accepted approach of computing a phase synchronization index (details in Methods).
It must be noted that, while many studies use the words synchrony and connectivity as synonymous,
in reality phase synchrony analysis reveals only a correlation between the phases of the oscillations
between two signals, and not a real connectivity which depends on several other factors (this matter
has been covered in detail in [21, 22]. Nevertheless, due to the unfeasibility of an accurate, realistic
4
 estimation of connectivity which would necessitate individual cell recordings from entire cell ensembles
as well as structural connectivity details, we use an accepted version under the assumption that the
phase relations may represent, at least, some aspect of a functional connectivity. Hence, in order to
evaluate interactions (“connections”
), we take each sensor/channel as one “unit”
, and defi
ne a pair
of signals as “connected” if the phase synchrony index is larger than a threshold. The threshold is
determined for each individual, and is the average synchrony index in the most normal alert state,
the ‘
awake eyes-open’condition, when the individual is fully alert and processing the sensorium in a
regular fashion. Because our data include the three recording methodologies aforementioned, we have
the opportunity to assess the reproducibility of the results in various types of recordings. While we work
at the signal level we will make the reasonable assumption that the MEG and scalp EEG sensors record
cortical activity underlying those sensors and thus throughout the text we will use the terms brain
signals or brain areas/networks as synonymous. The iEEG, obviously, records signals at the source
level. Note that we are not interested in the specifi
c pattern of connectivity among brain sources/areas,
but rather in the global states. These points are further discussed in the Discussion section.
Phase synchronization for specifi
c frequencies (details in Methods) is calculated for each pair of
channels and a “connectivity”matrix S is obtained, whose entries are the average values of the syn-
chrony index during a certain time period for each pairwise confi
guration. From this matrix, a Boolean
connectivity matrix B is calculated, with 0 entry if the corresponding synchrony index is lower than
a threshold, and 1 if higher.
We defi
ne two channels as “connected” if the corresponding entry in
matrix B is 1. Then we use the combinations of connected channels as a ‘
complexity’measure. The
total number of possible pairs of channels given a specifi
c channel montage is given by the binomial
coefficient N = Nc!/2! (Nc − 2)! where Nc is the total number of channels in the recording montage,
normally 144 − 146 in the case of MEG sensors, and between 19 and 35 with iEEG and scalp EEG. For
instance, in our MEG recordings we haveNc = 144, thus N = 10, 296possible pairs of connected sensors
are obtained. For each subject we calculate p, the number of connected pairs of signals in the different
behavioural states, using the aforementioned threshold of the synchrony index (which varies for each
subject), and estimate C, the number of possible combinations of those p pairs, using the binomial
coefficient again: C = N!/p!(N − p)! where N is the aforesaid value. In sum, all these calculations
represent the relatively simple combinatorial problem we are trying to solve: given a maximum total of
N pairs of connected signals, in how many ways can our experimental observation of p connected pairs
(that is, the number of 1’
s in matrix B) be arranged. We then compute the entropy and Lempel-Ziv
complexity associated with those p values.
Figure 1 depicts the entropy (S), which, assuming equiprobable states, is the logarithm of the
number of states, S = ln C (see Methods for the estimation of entropy using very large C values) in
three epileptic patients. We note that this equation using the natural logarithm allows for a calculation
of both the Gibbs and the Shannon entropy, if needed, which differ from S by a constant multiplicative
factor k (the Boltzmann constant) and 1/(ln2) respectively. In reality the entropy estimation does
not provide any further information, as the main, crucial result is the number of confi
gurations, C.
However, we have done it since it is a standard manner to quantify the “complexity”of the number of
microstates. The entropy data points are graphed on the curve that represents the entropy of all points
in the binomial distribution, where the maximum number of confi
gurations (that is, maximum entropy)
occurs in the middle of the graph. Note in that fi
gure that during conscious states, when patients are
not having generalised seizures with loss of awareness, the entropy is close to the maximum, whereas
entropy is lower (more distant from the top) for the seizure states. The values during the seizures fall
5
 on the right-hand side of the graph because, due to the higher synchrony during ictal (seizure) events
such that the number of coupled channels (note that the x-axis is the number of connected signals)
is larger than during interictal (between seizure) activity, there are fewer pairwise confi
gurations and
thus lower entropy. This phenomenon seems associated with the level of consciousness since when the
seizures are not generalised (Figure 1C and 1D), and the patients remain responsive and conscious, the
entropy values are similar to those of interictal (baseline) activity. Where in the curve the data points
are located depends of course on the synchrony index. Because seizures had higher synchrony than
interictal periods (“baseline”
), the number of coupled signals is greater and the number of combinations
is lower.
We observe similar trends in the case of sleep. Figure 2 depicts some examples. Note how during
wakefulness the entropy is closer to the maximum of the curve, whereas the deeper the sleep stage,
the more distant from the maximum the values are. The deepest sleep stage, slow wave 3-4 (‘
sws3-4’
),
has consistently the lowest entropy. Interestingly, the entropy during REM sleep is very close, in most
cases, to the normal, alert state. This result may not be as surprising as it sounds if we consider the
mental activity during REM episodes that are normally associated with dreams. It is worth noting
too that in recordings taken when the subjects had their eyes closed, the entropy is much lower than
during the eyes open condition, and sometimes it is as low as during slow-wave 3-4 sleep. The results
for two central frequencies (4 and 8 Hz) are shown in Figure 2A and 2C, to demonstrate that it is not
always the case of high synchrony having lower entropy; sometimes it is lower synchrony (e.g., results
at 8 Hz) that resulted in fewer channel combinations and thus lower entropy as compared to fully alert
states. In Figures 1 and 2 we have shown results with iEEG and MEG (Figure 1) or iEEG and scalp
EEG (Figure 2) recordings to demonstrate that the same qualitative results are obtained with these
three recordings techniques. Thus these results do not depend on recording methodology. Shown in
Figure 3 is an example of the time course of the entropy before and during an ictal event. Hence,
we have demonstrated that the specifi
c values of the synchrony index R in fully alert states represent
the largest number of combinations (microstates, see Discussion) of pairwise signal confi
gurations.
This method solves the potential problem of the interpretation of the different R values obtained with
various recordings techniques. For example, in our experiments, average values in baseline conditions
are 0.
248 ± 0.
2 for MEG, 0.
428 ± 0.
04for iEEG, and 0.
46 ± 0.
05 for scalp EEG, nevertheless, in our
study the number of combinations are “normalised”to the number of recording sensors and show a fi
nal
result (the entropy) that is independent of the structure and synchrony magnitudes of the recording
methodology. The main idea derived from these results is represented in Fig. 4.
To further explore whether the decrease in entropy has a parallel with a decrease in other forms
of complexity, the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the number of confi
gurations was assessed. Tables 1 and
2 illustrate the Lempel-Ziv complexity estimated for the B matrices, where a complementary result
can be seen: unconscious states have lower values of complexity.
A decrease of complexity in the
raw electrophysiological signals was obtained too (data not shown), hence this may be a phenomenon
observable at different levels of description.

Discussion
Our attempts at seeking features of brain organization that allow for adequate processing of sensory
stimuli have provided evidence that a greater number of possible confi
gurations of interactions between
6
 brain networks is associated with alert states, representing high entropy associated with the number of
those combinations, whereas lower entropy (and thus fewer combinations of connections) is characteristic
of either unconscious states or altered states of alertness (eyes closed).
This observation refl
ects a
relatively simple general organising principle at this collective level of description, which results in the
emergence of properties associated with consciousness.
With the advent of the ‘
Big Data’era and the related torrent of empirical observations, the search
for organising principles that result in the emergence of biological phenomena seems more crucial than
ever. We tried to uncover relatively simple laws that capture the bounds in the global organization
of a biological system that enable it to become adaptable (i.e., responsive) to an environment, or, in
neuroscientifi
c terms, the features of optimal brain organization (in terms of connections) that allow
brains to adequately process sensory stimuli. We focused on the global states and did not investigate
specifi
c patterns of connectivity between brain areas as a variety of other studies have assessed these
inter-regional interactions in conscious and unconscious states [23, 24]. The fact that our results are
similar, independent of recording methodology, demonstrates the robustness of the analysis. On that
note, we remark that while we have used the term ‘
connectivity’
, in reality the analysis reveals only
correlation between phases of oscillation, as already discussed in Results.
The present study can be considered an extension of previous work where it was proposed that a
general organising principle of natural phenomena is the tendency toward a maximal, or more probable,
distribution of energy [7], which can be encapsulated by the notion of the maximization of information
transfer [25]. As well, the notions of information and energy exchange are conceptually related: “the
common currency paying for all biological information is energy fl
ow” [26, 9]. In the fi
nal analysis,
information exchange implies energy exchange, hence we interpret information exchange as energy re-
distribution as proposed in [7], even though our study is focused not on energy considerations but on
the number of states. Other studies have assessed the importance of brain synchronization to optimally
transfer information [27]. We interpret our observation that the number of pairwise channel combina-
tions –that we take as interactions/connections between brain networks –occurs near the maximum
of possible confi
gurations in periods with normal alertness, as that greater number of confi
gurations
of interactions represents the most probable distribution of energy/information resulting in conscious
awareness. The confi
guration entropy we calculate measures the information content of the functional
network, and has been used in other works for the purpose of quantifying information [28]. One some-
what surprising result is the low entropy during the eyes-close condition. One could argue that having
the eyes closed does not change much the conscious state, and yet we observe reduced entropy as com-
pared with eyes-open condition. Hence our observations may indicate not only states of consciousness
but also optimality of sensory processing – considering the great importance of visual processing in
humans, interrupting visual inputs should result in considerable changes in the dynamics; for instance,
an apparent alteration of brain dynamics upon eye closure is the appearance of alpha waves most clearly
in parieto-occipital regions. Interesting too is the relatively high entropy associated with REM episodes,
perhaps a refl
ection of the partial awareness during dreams. Perhaps the main difference between dream
and awake states is psychological, but they share similar brain dynamics.
It has been proposed that aspects of awareness emerge when certain levels of complexity are reached
[29]. It is then possible that the organization (complexity) needed for consciousness to arise requires
the maximum number of confi
gurations that allow for a greater variety of interactions between cell
assemblies because this structure leads to optimal segregation and integration of information, two fun-
damental aspects of brain information processing [20] . Our results help cast the study of consciousness
7
 and cognition into more of a physics framework that may provide insight into simple principles guiding
the emergence of conscious awareness, and perhaps the proposed thermodynamics for a network of
connected neurons [18] can be extended to explain cognition. Some classical studies [8] have already
characterized biological order in terms of functions of the number of states of a system. It is tempt-
ing to link our observations with the typical chemical equilibrium that, despite being composed of a
myriad of microstates, when viewed at the macroscopic level produces some useful laws, like the law
of mass action describing chemical balance, and thus the perspective we develop here may help guide
research to uncover organising principles in the neurosciences. In physics, microstates that yield the
same macrostate form an ensemble. A system tends to approach the most probable state, maximising
entropy under present constraints, and the resulting macrostate will be represented by the maximum
number of microstates. Hence, the macrostate with higher entropy (see scheme in Fig. 4) we have
defi
ned, composed of many microstates (the possible combinations of connections between diverse net-
works, our C variable defi
ned in Results), can be thought of as an ensemble characterised by the largest
number of confi
gurations. Here we defi
ne an ensemble of microstates as all possible confi
gurations of
connectivity leading to the same macrostate (having the same number of connected pair of signals, p).
The entropy of this macrostate, given by the logarithm of the number of combinations (our C), is the
number of microstates that are compatible with the given macrostate (assuming all microstates have
same statistical weight). In neurophysiological terms, each microstate represents a different connectiv-
ity pattern and thus is associated with, in principle, different behaviours or cognitive processes. The
macrostate that we fi
nd associated with wakeful normal states (eyes open) is the most probable because
it has the largest entropy (largest number of combinations of connections). While many elementary cel-
lular microscopic processes are far from equilibrium (e.g., ionic gradients), at the macroscopic level the
system tends towards equilibrium, as most natural phenomena remain in near-equilibrium conditions
[30]. At the same time, the ensemble of microstates associated with normal sensory processing features
the most varied confi
gurations and therefore offers the variability needed to optimally process sensory
inputs. In this sense, our results support current views on the metastability of brain states [1] in that
the states should not be too stable for efficient information processing, hence the larger the number of
possible interactions, the more variability is possible.
Equally, the results are consistent with the global workspace theory [31] in that the most widespread
distribution of information leads to conscious awareness. Furthermore, these observations relate as well
to the information integrated theory [32], in that consciousness increases in proportion to the system’
s
repertoire of states, thus the more combinations possible, the more states available, and here we can de-
fi
ne states as confi
gurations of interactions. Additionally, the results support computational/theoretical
studies showing that patterns of organised activity arise from the maximization of fl
uctuations in syn-
chrony [33], and that transitions between conscious states are achieved by just varying the probability
of connections in neural nets [34]. In general, our observations highlight the fundamental importance of
fl
uctuations in neuronal activity as the source of healthy brain dynamics. More specifi
cally, our results
have a precise parallel with the work of Hudetz et al. (2014), where they graph a dispersion index
versus an activation level (their fi
gure 7B) and propose that consciousness resides at the top of the
curve, and anaesthetic states and seizures to lower and higher activation levels respectively, as we show
in Figures 1 and 2. Their ‘
activation level’could correspond to the number of signals that take part in
the combinations (our x axes in the graphs), and their ‘
dispersion index’to our number of combinations
(the y axes). Other studies have proposed as well that consciousness requires medium values of certain
features of cell assemblies [32, 35].
8
 In sum, along with others, we consider cognition/consciousness not a static property but a dynamic
process with constant fl
ux of energy, or information exchange [25]. Even though we have talked above
about a macrostate, this should not be taken as a fi
xed state, rather it contains dynamic processes
represented by the microstates, the re-arrangements of connections among brain cell ensembles. The
emergent features of cognitive phenomena that can be termed “conscious”arise once an efficient web of
connections endowed with certain complexity appears. The fact that values of phase synchrony during
fully alert states gave us the largest entropy of the number of pairwise signal combinations explains
in part the neurophysiological organization underlying these specifi
c values of the quantifi
cation of
brain synchrony. Studies at this level of description may help to understand how consciousness arises
from organization of matter. In our view, consciousness can be considered as an emergent property
of the organization of the (embodied) nervous system, especially a consequence of the most probable
distribution that maximizes information content of brain functional networks.
On a technical note, we remark that in our analysis we had to choose a threshold to defi
ne “connec-
tivity”
, and therefore a suitable baseline had to be chosen. This procedure is obviously biased in that a
signal corresponding to a baseline has to be ascribed as the one providing the threshold, and we chose
the signals corresponding to the (psychological) state that is most suited for the purposes of adaptabil-
ity: fully alert and receiving all sensory inputs (awake with open eyes). By this choice, and according
to our methods, that signal is already ascribed as having maximum entropy. We tried another less
prejudiced method, using surrogates of the original signals, and then computing the average synchrony
index among the surrogate population (10 phase-randomised surrogates per original channel/signal)
that is the threshold to defi
ne connectivity. It turns out that the value of the magnitude of synchrony of
the surrogates is close to the one for the aforementioned baseline chosen, so the results do not vary; nev-
ertheless this new method still assigns the largest entropy to the random signals (surrogates), so there
is still the assumption that the average synchrony of the stochastic signals is a good approximation to
defi
ne connections among brain networks. Our current purpose is to completely avoid using thresholds
of synchrony indices, for which we are presently working on a scheme that assigns connectivity in the
time domain.

Conclusions and conjectures on the structure of brain-behaviour-
environment
It is tempting to speculate, based on these results and the conclusions of a previous study [7] that there
could be a universal logic ruling the evolution of natural phenomena — biological and nonbiological—
and the nervous system in particular: patterns emerge from a central theme captured by maximising
information exchange.
Because, in the fi
nal analysis, all exchange of information implies exchange
of energy, natural phenomena tend towards the most probable distribution of energy, and thus the
interactions among system constituents tends to be maximized.
Because the brain functions to maintain a predictive model of the environment (the reason the
brain evolved is to model the environment, after all), then perhaps the brain’
s global confi
guration
has to “copy”what is out there: and out there energy distributes in all possible microstates (second
principle of thermodynamics). Then to process such variability in nature, the nervous system should
have same structure, and the result is the ‘
inverted U’ that has appeared in our analysis and has
been theoretically proposed in other publications [20], the top of the curve representing more possible
9
 combinations to handle information/energy exchanges.
On the other hand, in the extremes of this
curve we fi
nd fewer microstates, thus these are not optimal situations to process the many microstates
in the environment. The key then is not to reach the maximum number of units interacting (which
would be all-to-all connections and thus only one possible microstate), but rather the largest possible
number of confi
gurations allowed by the constraints.
In a similar fashion, it has been argued that
the brain needs to show criticality because natural phenomena possess critical dynamics [36]. Then,
perchance, consciousness can be considered as an emergent property of the organization of the embodied
nervous system submerged in an environment, consequence of the most probable distribution of energy
(information exchange) in the brain. In this regard, consciousness (like biochemistry) may represent
thus an optimal channel for accessing sources of (free) energy.

Figure 1: Graphs representing the entropy of the number of pairwise confi
gurations of signals in epileptic
patients during conscious (baseline) and unconscious (generalised seizure) states. A, derived from MEG
recordings in a patient with primary generalised epilepsy, shows entropy associated with a normal alert
period (baseline, ‘
Base’
) and a generalised absence seizure (‘
Sz’
), estimated from synchrony values at two
central frequencies (defi
ned in Methods) of 5 and 12 Hz. The curve in this and other graphs here and in
Figure 2 represents the possible entropy values of all possible numbers of pairwise combinations, yielding
an inverted U or, for very large numbers, a Gaussian. Note that here as well as in all generalised seizures
analysed, the entropy values associated with alert, baseline conditions were closer to the maximum (top
of the curve) than those associated with the seizures.
B, entropy values of two seizures and their
corresponding baseline (‘
Base’
) activity (computed using a time period of 30-40 minutes before the
ictus) in a patient with secondary (symptomatic) generalised epilepsy (MEG recordings). C, derived
from iEEG recordings in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy, shows the entropy during the alert
state (‘
baseline’
), during the initial 10 seconds of the seizure when the patient was still responsive and
alert (‘
10 sec Sz’
), and during the rest of the seizure when it became generalised and the patient was
unresponsive (‘
Sz’
). Note that when the ictus has not yet generalised, the entropy is similar to that of
normal alertness. D, another example of a non-generalised seizure in a patient with frontal lobe epilepsy
(MEG recordings).

Figure 2:
Same graph types as in Figure 1, using sleep recordings. In each subject, data samples
were of 2-4 minutes duration during wakefulness with eyes open (‘
awake’
) or eyes closed (‘
Eyecl’
), and
sleep stages slow-wave 2 (‘
Sws2’
), slow-wave 3-4 (‘
Sws3-4’
) and rapid eye movement (‘
REM’
). A, results
derived from iEEG recordings in a subject investigated with bilateral frontal and temporal electrodes
and simultaneous scalp EEG. Entropy estimated from synchrony values at two central frequencies of 4
and 8 Hz. As occurred in the patient recordings shown in Figure 1, the baseline, alert state (in this case
labelled ‘
awake’
) is closer to the top of the curve, having greater entropy. The deepest sleep stage, slow
wave 3-4 (‘
sws3-4’
), has the lowest entropy. B, same subject but using the scalp EEG recordings for the
calculations, showing similar trend (evaluated at central frequency of 4 Hz). C, results derived from a
different subject investigated with right frontal electrodes and simultaneous scalp EEG, with synchrony
evaluated at two central frequencies of 4 and 8 Hz using the iEEG signals. Note that the eyes closed
(‘
Eyecl’
) condition has lower entropy than that of the normal alert state with open eyes. Depending on
the frequency of analysis, the entropy in ‘
Eyecl’falls toward the left or right side of the curve; e.g., at
8 Hz, because the synchrony is higher (more coupled channels) due to alpha waves at 8-10 Hz and the
entropy is reduced due to fewer combinations of connections, as occurs similarly during seizures (Figure
1). D, same subject but using the scalp EEG signals, showing similar results to those obtained with
iEEG (evaluated at central frequency of 4 Hz).

Proposed general scheme of the relation between global brain connectivity and behavioural
states. Normal alertness resides at the top of the curve representing the number of confi
gurations of
connections the system can adopt, or the associated entropy. The maximisation of the confi
gurations
(microstates) provides the variability in brain activity needed for normal sensorimotor action. Abnor-
mal, or unconscious states, are located farther from the top, and are characterised by either large or
small number of “connected”networks therefore exhibiting lower number of microstates (hence lower
entropy) that are not optimal for sensorimotor processing.
