Abstract
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that proliferate in the bloodstream. During each 
replication cycle some parasites differentiate into gametocytes, the only forms able to infect the 
mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the 
master transcriptional regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-
dependent silencing of ap2-g prevents sexual conversion in proliferating parasites. Here, we 
identified Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as an upstream activator of 
sexual commitment. We found that GDV1 targeted heterochromatin and triggered HP1 eviction 
thus de-repressing ap2-g. Expression of GDV1 was responsive to environmental triggers of sexual 
conversion and controlled via a gdv1 antisense RNA. Hence, GDV1 appears to act as an effector 
protein that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a conserved regulator of heterochromatin formation, 
heritable gene silencing and variegated gene expression (1). In Plasmodium falciparum, 
HP1-dependent clonally variant expression allows parasites to adapt rapidly to 
environmental challenges encountered during infection (2–4). For example, immune evasion 
via antigenic variation of var/PfEMP1 is the hallmark of Plasmodium survival. Other 
processes, such as expression of red blood cell (RBC) invasion ligands or nutrient 
transporters, are similarly regulated in this parasite (4). Most clonally variant genes cluster 
in subtelomeric domains but some also occur in chromosome-internal heterochromatic 
regions. In addition, HP1 forms microdomains at some euchromatic genes (2). One of these 
encodes the transcription factor AP2-G that is required for sexual conversion and 
differentiation (2, 5–7). HP1-dependent regulation of ap2-g controls the rate at which 
parasites commit to sexual differentiation (7).
To explore the mechanisms regulating HP1 occupancy in P. falciparum we identified HP1-
interacting proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
analysis of native HP1 complexes that were purified by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)

 from parasites expressing GFP-tagged HP1 (7) (Fig. 1A and Table S3). Interestingly, we 
consistently observed GDV1 among the potential HP1 interaction partners (Table S1). 
GDV1 is a nuclear protein implicated in sexual commitment and early gametocytogenesis 
but its exact function remains unknown (8). We therefore created a parasite line for the 
conditional expression of fluorescently labelled ectopic GDV1 (GDV1-GFP-DD) (Fig. 1B). 
Proteins tagged with the immunophilin protein-folding chaperone FKBP destabilisation 
domain (DD) are proteolytically degraded unless cells are cultured in presence of Shield-1, a 
small molecule ligand stabiliser (9, 10). Thus, GDV1-GFP-DD is barely detectable in 
parasites cultured in absence of Shield-1 (3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF), but its expression is 
markedly induced in parasites grown in presence of Shield-1 (3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDON) (Fig. 
1, B and C). In agreement with the co-IP results GDV1-GFP-DD co-localizes with HP1 at 
the nuclear periphery (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). Furthermore, we found that recombinant HP1 
and GDV1 formed a complex (Fig. S1) and that HP1 co-purified with GDV1-GFP-DD in 
reverse co-IPs (Fig. 1D, Tables S2 and S4). The chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding 
protein 1 (CHD1) and a protein of unknown function (PF3D7_1451200) also consistently 
co-purified with both HP1 and GDV1-GFP-DD (Tables S1 and S2). Given that CHD1 plays 
important roles in cell fate decision and heterochromatin remodelling in other organisms 
(11, 12) and that GDV1 is implicated in gametocytogenesis (8) it appears that this putative 
regulatory complex may function in activating sexual commitment.
Malaria parasites proliferate by iterative rounds of intra-erythrocytic replication through 
schizogony, merozoite release and RBC re-invasion. The decision to enter 
gametocytogenesis is made in the cell cycle prior to sexual differentiation; sexually 
committed schizonts release merozoites that invade RBCs and differentiate all into either 
female or male gametocytes (13, 14) (Fig. 2A). To test if GDV1 triggers sexual commitment, 
3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF parasites were split and cultured in the absence or presence of 
Shield-1. After re-invasion, stage I gametocytes were quantified by immuno-fluorescence 
assays (IFA) using antibodies against the gametocyte marker Pfs16 (15). Strikingly, the 3D7/
GDV1-GFP-DDON population displayed a sexual conversion rate of 57.2% (+/- 10.0 SD) 
compared to 11.0% (+/- 2.4 SD) in 3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF parasites, and these 
gametocytes differentiated normally into both male and female gametocytes and showed a 
typical female-biased sex ratio (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2). Moreover, Shield-1 titration revealed a 
positive correlation between ectopic GDV1-GFP-DD expression levels and sexual 
conversion rates (Fig. 2C). To test if endogenous GDV1 levels similarly correlate with 
gametocyte conversion we used CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing to append a triple 
hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the N-terminus of GDV1 (3D7/3xHA-GDV1) (Fig. S3). 
Endogenous 3xHA-GDV1 co-localised with HP1 as expected (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3) but was 
only expressed in some parasites. We next quantified 3xHA-GDV1 expression under 
conditions that either suppress or favour sexual conversion. To this end, we made use of the 
recent discovery of choline as an inhibitor of sexual commitment (16). 3D7/3xHA-GDV1 
parasites cultured in the presence or absence of 2 mM choline displayed sexual commitment 
rates of 1.8% (+/- 0.3 SD) or 30.9% (+/- 3.8 SD), respectively (Fig. 2E). Strikingly, parasites 
cultured in the absence of choline showed markedly increased 3xHA-GDV1 expression 
levels (Fig. 2F). This was accounted for by a higher proportion of 3xHA-GDV1-positive 
cells (48.6% (+/- 3.4 SD) in absence compared to 16.4% (+/- 1.8 SD) in presence of choline)

 (Fig. 2F) and comparatively higher 3xHA-GDV1 expression levels in individual 3xHA-
GDV1-positive parasites (Fig. S3). Together, these results show that GDV1 activates sexual 
conversion in a dose-dependent manner and that endogenous GDV1 expression can be 
induced by environmental signals triggering sexual commitment.
We next performed comparative transcriptome analyses using two-colour microarrays. 3D7/
GDV1-GFP-DDOFF ring stage parasites were split, cultured separately in absence or 
presence of Shield-1 and total RNA was harvested at seven paired time points spanning the 
remaining 24 hours of generation 1 (24-32 hours post-invasion (hpi); 32-40 hpi, 40-48 hpi) 
and the first 40 hours after re-invasion in generation 2 (8-16 hpi, 16-24 hpi, 24-32 hpi, 32-40 
hpi) (Fig. 2A). As expected, GDV1-GFP-DD expression triggered a transcriptional response 
characteristic of sexual commitment and early differentiation. This was evident from the 
induction of ap2-g in generation 1, followed by activation of early gametocyte markers (5, 7, 
8, 17) after re-invasion (Fig. 2G, Fig. S4 and Table S5). In F12 parasites, a 3D7-derived 
gametocyte-deficient clone carrying a loss-of-function mutation in ap2-g (5, 18), GDV1-
GFP-DD expression still activated ap2-g but failed to launch a sexual differentiation 
response (Fig. 2H and Table S6). Next to ap2-g only eight other genes were significantly 
induced in F12/GDV1-GFP-DDON parasites, all of which are marked by HP1. This set 
included dblmsp2, which was also induced in 3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDON parasites (Fig. 2, G 
and H). Given that DBLMSP2 is a merozoite surface antigen expressed only in a small 
subpopulation of schizonts (19, 20) the GDV1-dependent activation of the dblmsp2 locus 
suggests it may be expressed specifically in sexually committed schizonts. In summary, 
these findings show that GDV1 is an upstream activator of sexual commitment and likely 
triggers this process by antagonising HP1-dependent silencing of ap2-g.
To test if GDV1 associates with heterochromatin in vivo we conducted comparative ChIP-
seq experiments. 3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF parasites were split at 28-34 hpi, cultured in 
parallel in the absence or presence of Shield-1 and paired chromatin samples were harvested 
two (30-36 hpi), six (34-40 hpi) and ten (38-44 hpi) hours after Shield-1 addition. We found 
that (1) GDV1-GFP-DD associates specifically with heterochromatin throughout the genome 
(Fig. 3A, Fig. S5, Table S7); (2) GDV1-GFP-DD occupancy was markedly higher in 3D7/
GDV1-GFP-DDON compared to 3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF parasites (Fig. S5, Table S7); and 
(3) GDV1-GFP-DD occupancy is highly correlated with that of HP1 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, 
GDV1-GFP-DD occupancy peaked six hours post-induction and decreased substantially 
thereafter (Fig. 3A, Fig. S5, Table S7). This drop in GDV1-GFP-DD signal coincided with a 
reduced HP1 occupancy over heterochromatic genes in 3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDON compared to 
3D7/GDV1-GFP-DDOFF parasites (Fig. 3, A and C, Table S7). While the vast majority of 
heterochromatic loci, in particular those displaying high HP1 occupancy such as var genes, 
displayed only slightly decreased HP1 levels, some genes exhibited as much as 40% reduced 
HP1 occupancy (Fig. 3C and Table S7). This group of genes includes ap2-g and most known 
HP1-associated early gametocyte markers including geco (21), pfgexp17 (22) and 
pfg14_748 (8, 17) (Fig. 3, C and D, Table S7). These data are consistent with the microarray 
results, where GDV1-GFP-DD expression activated ap2-g and early gametocyte genes but 
had no effect on the expression of the bulk of heterochromatic loci including var genes (Fig. 
2, G and H). Of note, given the 50-60% sexual conversion rate observed for 3D7/GDV1-
GFP-DDON parasites (see above), a 30-40% reduction in HP1 occupancy indicates that HP1

 may be depleted at these loci specifically in sexually committed parasites but single cell 
approaches are required to confirm this hypothesis. Overall, we suggest that GDV1 
destabilises heterochromatin and thus allows specific transcription factors to activate 
expression of ap2-g and other gametocyte-specific heterochromatic genes, and this may play 
an important role in the positive auto-regulatory feedback loop proposed to reinforce AP2-G 
expression in committed parasites (5, 6, 23). How GDV1 achieves specificity in unlocking 
specific HP1-associated genes despite binding heterochromatin genome-wide is a 
challenging question to be addressed in the future.
Since GDV1 activates sexual commitment, the question arises of how parasites limit GDV1 
expression to prevent sexual conversion in asexual schizonts. A recent study identified a 
multi-exon long non-coding gdv1 antisense RNA (asRNA) that initiates downstream of the 
gdv1 locus and overlaps with the ATG start codon of gdv1 (24), which is a hallmark feature 
of regulatory asRNAs (25). To investigate if the gdv1 asRNA participates in regulating 
sexual commitment we created a gdv1 asRNA loss-of-function mutant in F12 parasites (F12/
gdv1-asKO) (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6). Strand-specific RNA-seq analysis identified a small set 
of genes that were consistently differentially expressed between F12/gdv1-asKO and F12 
wild-type parasites (17 up- and 23 down-regulated genes) (Fig. 4B, Table S8). Strikingly, 
and similar to F12 parasites expressing ectopic GDV1-GFP-DD (Fig. 2H), ap2-g, dblmsp2 
and two early gametocyte genes (pfg14_748, PF3D7_1477400) (8, 17) were markedly 
induced in F12/gdv1-asKO parasites, and all except one up-regulated gene are HP1-
associated genes (Fig. 4B, Fig. S6, Table S8). gdv1 sense transcripts were slightly increased 
in the F12/gdv1-asKO population, while gdv1 antisense transcripts were undetectable as 
expected (Fig. 4, B and C, Fig. S6, Table S8). These results indicated that the gdv1 asRNA 
acts as a negative regulator of GDV1 expression. To confirm this hypothesis, we tagged 
endogenous GDV1 in these parasites (F12/3xHA-GDV1/gdv1-asKO) and observed that 
indeed almost all parasites expressed 3xHA-GDV1 (96.7% +/- 2.5 SD) (Fig. S7). Lastly, we 
show that deletion of the gdv1 asRNA locus in a conditional AP2-G mutant resulted in a 
markedly increased production of gametocytes (Fig. S8 and Supplementary text). Together, 
these findings demonstrate a central role for the gdv1-asRNA in regulating GDV1-dependent 
activation of sexual commitment. We anticipate this mechanism likely involves inhibiting 
GDV1 expression by interference with gdv1 mRNA transcription, stability or translation, 
similar to asRNA-mediated gene regulation in other organisms (26).
We identified GDV1-mediated heterochromatin destabilisation as an epigenetic control 
strategy regulating sexual cell fate decision in P. falciparum. Our discovery of the gdv1-
asRNA as a negative regulator of sexual commitment is reminiscent of lncRNA-mediated 
control of gametogenesis in yeasts (27, 28). In S. cerevisiae, nutritional stress triggers 
gametogenesis by activating the transcriptional regulator Inducer of Meiosis 1 (IME1) (28). 
A lncRNA in the ime1 promoter and antisense transcription of ime4 are key factors in 
preventing IME1 expression under non-inducing conditions (29, 30). These parallels raise 
the exciting possibility that evolutionary divergent unicellular eukaryotes may employ a 
conceptually similar regulatory logic to control entry into the sexual phases of their life 
cycles. Interestingly, all Plasmodium species infecting humans possess a GDV1 ortholog 
suggesting the GDV1-based regulation of sexual commitment is conserved in all human-
infective malaria parasites. In conclusion, our study contributes to understanding the
