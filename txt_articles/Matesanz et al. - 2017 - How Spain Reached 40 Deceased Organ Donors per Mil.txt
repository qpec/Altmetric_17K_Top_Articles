With 40 donors and more than 100 transplant proce-
dures per million population in 2015, Spain holds a
privileged position worldwide in providing transplant
services to its patient population. The Spanish suc-
cess derives from a specific organizational approach
to ensure the systematic identification of opportuni-
ties for organ donation and their transition to actual
donation and to promote public support for the
donation of organs after death. The Spanish results
are to be highlighted in the context of the dramatic
decline in the incidence of brain death and the
changes in end-of-life care practices in the country
since the beginning of the century. This prompted
the system to conceive the 40 donors per mil-
lion population plan, with three specific objectives:
(i) promoting the identification and early referral of
possible organ donors from outside of the intensive
care unit to consider elective non-therapeutic inten-
sive care and incorporate the option of organ dona-
tion into end-of-life care; (ii) facilitating the use of
organs from expanded criteria and non–standard risk
donors; and (iii) developing the framework for the
practice of donation after circulatory death. This arti-
cle
describes
the
actions
undertaken
and
their
impact on donation and transplantation activities.

Introduction
Transplantation is the best and, frequently, the only life-
saving
treatment
for
end-stage
organ
failure.
In
2014, 119 873 solid organ transplants were performed
worldwide (World Health Organization Global Observatory
on Organ Donation and Transplantation (1)). Although
impressive, the annual number of organ transplants repre-
sents less than 10% of the global needs. Organ shortage
leads to deaths and poor quality of life for those on the
waiting list. Moreover, because the costs of renal replace-
ment therapy with dialysis greatly surpass those of kidney
transplantation after the first year, organ shortage implies
important costs to healthcare systems. The benefits of
transplantation have also been marred by the growing phe-
nomenon of organ trafficking and transplant tourism, prac-
tices that violate fundamental human rights and threaten
individual and public health.
The World Health Assembly, concerned by the growing
demand for organs and exploitative actions against the
destitute
and
vulnerable,
urged
member
states
“to
strengthen national and multinational authorities and/or
capacities to provide oversight, organization and coordi-
nation of donation and transplantation activities, with
special attention to maximizing donation from deceased
donors” (2). Anticipating a call that the World Health
Organization would launch 20 years later, the Spanish
Ministry of Health created the Organizaci�
on Nacional de
Trasplantes (ONT) in 1989 as an agency in charge of the
coordination and oversight of donation, procurement, and
transplantation
activities
in
a
politically
decentralized
country, albeit with an adequate legislative and technical
framework from the transplantation perspective. The
ONT conceived an organized and professionalized model
to effectively identify donation opportunities and facilitate
their transition to actual donation and to promote public
support for donation after death (3). The elements of the
Spanish model, extensively described in literature, made
Spain double its deceased donation activity in less than a
decade (Figure 1) and soon hold a privileged position
worldwide that it maintains (4–6).
In 2008, Spain was confronted with important epidemio-
logical events and changes in end-of-life care practices
that challenged the progress of the country toward self-
sufficiency in transplantation (7). The ONT then designed
the 40 donors per million population (pmp) plan (8). The
aims of this report are to summarize the challenges that
the system has faced in further developing donation from
the deceased and to describe the three strategies that
have made Spain reach the target of 40 donors pmp

 (Figure 1), giving rise to the highest number of solid
organ transplant procedures pmp in the world in 2015
(Figure 2).
Challenges for the Spanish Donation and
Transplantation System
Despite the important transplant activity undertaken in
the country, Spain is far from the self-sufficiency para-
digm. The number of patients on the kidney waiting list
remains above 4000, which exceeds the annual number
of kidney transplantations carried out in the country
(2500–3000), with preemptive transplantation being rare.
From 6% to 8% of patients waiting for nonkidney trans-
plants die every year, with a similar percentage being
removed from the waiting list mainly because they have
become too sick to be transplanted.
The chronic inability to cope with the transplantation
needs of patients has been further challenged by impor-
tant epidemiological changes and variations in the care of
neurocritical patients. Mortality related to cerebrovascular
and traffic accidents has fortunately decreased in Spain
over the years, leading the country to hold one of the
lowest mortality rates relevant to organ donation in the
world (9). The decrease in the occurrence of events
potentially leading to devastating brain injuries as a result
of transport and work safety measures, along with
improvements in the treatment of neurocritical patients,
explain such a decrease in mortality. The extended use
of decompressive craniectomies and other neurosurgical
interventions
has
also
contributed
to
a
progressive
decline in the incidence of brain death, which has
evolved from 65 cases pmp in 2001 to <50 pmp during
the past years (10).
Changes have also occurred in the patterns of care pro-
vided to critical patients at the end- of- life under the
guidance of the relevant professional societies (11). Far
from what the Ethicus Study described for southern
European countries at the beginning of the century,
where deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) following
the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) were
rare (12), at present >30% of deaths in the Spanish ICUs
and close to 20% of hospital deaths in patients with a
devastating brain injury follow the decision to WLST
because this is no longer in the best interest of the
patient (13,14). Until recently, patients dying after the
WLST could not be offered the opportunity to donate
their organs, because the framework for the practice of
controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD) had
not been developed and a moratorium existed on this
particular activity since 1996 (15).
The 40 Donors pmp Population Plan
The situation described here prompted the system to
consider new strategies to meet the demand of organs
for transplantation and to ensure that the option of organ
donation is posed in all circumstances of death. In 2008,

40 Donors per Million Population
 the ONT devised the 40 Donors pmp Plan, establishing
this objective in deceased organ donation in all Spanish
regions (8). The objective was not arbitrary. When com-
paring performance between regions and hospitals, pro-
found
differences
could
be
observed,
not
easily
explained by disparities in the pool of possible donors
(16). These differences suggested that there was still
considerable room for improvement.
Three specific objectives were established: (i) promote
the early identification and referral of possible organ
donors from outside of the ICU to consider elective non-
therapeutic intensive care and incorporate the option of
organ donation into end-of-life care; (ii) foster the use of
expanded and nonstandard risk donors; and (iii) develop
the framework for the practice of DCD. Actions under-
taken to yield a level of activity that has been achieved
by the country as a whole and surpassed by several
Spanish regions are summarized next.
Promoting the identification and early referral of
possible organ donors from outside of the ICU to
consider elective non-therapeutic intensive care
Early identification and referral of persons with a devas-
tating brain injury in whom further treatment has been
deemed futile by the treating team and who are consid-
ered possible organ donors—because of the likelihood of
brain death within a short period of time—to pose the
option of elective non-therapeutic intensive care to facili-
tate organ donation (ICOD) can substantially affect the
pool of potential donation after brain death (DBD) donors
(14).
Some years ago, a group of Spanish hospitals had
reached an outstanding performance in deceased dona-
tion, with rates over 60–70 donors pmp, levels that sur-
passed any previous assessment of the deceased donor
potential in the country. However, former estimations of
the DBD pool were exclusively focused on the ICU.
Many factors determine the number of persons who die
as a result of a devastating brain lesion within an ICU in
conditions consistent with brain death, inclusive of end-
of-life care practices (17). Admission criteria to the ICU
and ICOD when intensive care is deemed futile are
acknowledged as modifiable factors affecting the pool of
donors, practices that are dependent on the level of
professional
knowledge
and
ownership
of
deceased
donation.
In 2009, the ONT promoted a benchmarking study tar-
geted to identify best-performing hospitals in the country
in the different phases of the DBD process (18). The
study identified 10 hospitals with outstanding results in
the identification and referral of possible organ donors
from outside of the ICU to pose the option of ICOD.
Qualitative questionnaires and on-site visits by external
experts
pointed
out
critical
factors
for
success—
these hospitals had devised a pathway of care of the
neurocritical patient inclusive of the consideration of
organ donation when the responsible team shifted from
active treatment to palliative and end-of-life care. When
prognosis
was
ominous
and
further
treatment
was
deemed futile by the responsible physician, the case
was referred to the donor coordinator and organ donation
was discussed with the relatives along with the need to
initiate/continue intensive care with the aim of incorporat-
ing the option of organ donation into the patient0s end-of-
life care plans. This practice was a routine reflected in
local protocols, well accepted and properly monitored.
The finding was presented in the form of dedicated rec-
ommendations released to the Spanish network on the
practice of ICOD as part of a Guide of Best Practices in
Organ Donation (19).
Further work focused on the quantitative and qualitative
description of possible organ donors who were dying
outside of the ICU in Spain. The first national assess-
ment was performed in the context of a study jointly
undertaken by the ONT and the Spanish Society of
Emergency Care (Sociedad Espa~
nola de Medicina de
Urgencias
y
Emergencias).
Possible
organ
donors
accounted for one of 2000 patients attended at the
emergency department of procurement hospitals. Of
these possible donors admitted to the hospital through
the emergency room, 69% died outside of the ICU (in
the emergency department itself or on the hospital ward)
with the possibility of organ donation not having been
considered at any moment of their clinical evolution.
More recently, the ACCORD-Spain study assessed end-
of-life care practices relevant to organ donation at 68
hospitals in the country (14). Information was collected
from 1970 possible organ donors, of whom almost 40%
were never admitted to the ICU during their hospital stay
because the option of organ donation had not been con-
sidered when the responsible team had deemed further
treatment futile. Notably, 43% of these patients were
octogenarian and/or had significant comorbidities, and
most were not ventilated at the moment when the
decision was made not to continue intensive care. The
study also pointed out some of the many challenges of
ICOD—the complexity of conversations with the family,
the frequent need for elective ventilation, the uncertain-
ties about contraindications to organ donation that might
become evident once the decision has been made to
perform ICOD, and especially the difficulties of anticipat-
ing if brain death will occur within a reasonable period of
time.
The practice of ICOD and its related challenges are now
components of the national curriculum for donor coordi-
nators and intensive and emergency care professionals
in the framework of training activities organized and
funded by the Spanish government. Jointly with SEMES,
the ONT has produced recommendations on the role of
emergency care professionals in organ donation (20). A
1450

Matesanz et al
 working group designated by the ONT and the Spanish
Society of Intensive Care and Coronary Units (Sociedad
Espa~
nola de Medicina Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias)
is now finalizing guidelines on ICOD for the intensive
care community, targeted to harmonize and improve
practices in this particular setting. The ONT is finally
organizing Plan, Do, Study, Act cycles to promote the
implementation of national recommendations on ICOD.
The costs of ICOD are covered by the public healthcare
system. The practice provides more patients the opportu-
nity of donating their organs, and it is considered cost-
effective. The use of ICU resources is limited in most
cases—the median time between the devastating brain
injury and death in patients admitted to the ICU to facili-
tate donation is 1 day in the Spanish experience (14). It
has been recently estimated that an ICU bed provided to
a patient admitted to the ICU for palliation and considera-
tion of organ donation results in 7.3 quality-adjusted life-
years gained for the community per ICU bed-day (21).
Patients with devastating brain injury subject to ICOD are
septuagenarian or octogenarian. Up to 40% will finally
not transition to actual donation. However, the contribu-
tion of ICOD to actual donation rates is evident—it is
estimated that 24% of actual organ donors in the country
have been patients admitted to the ICU with the aim of
incorporating organ donation into their end-of-life care
pathway (14).
Fostering the use of organs from expanded criteria
and nonstandard risk donors
Expanded
criteria
donors:
In
the
context
of
the
fortunate reduction in the number of deaths due to
traffic
accidents,
if
criteria
for
organ
donation
had
remained unaltered, the deceased donation activity in
Spain would have dramatically decreased. However, the
Spanish coordination and transplantation system has
progressively adopted more flexible criteria for donor
selection. As a result, the number of aged donors,
mostly dead as a result of cerebrovascular accidents, has
sustainably
increased
in
Spain.
In
2015,
>50%
of
deceased organ donors were aged ≥60 years, falling
under the age criterion that defines the expanded criteria
donor kidney used by the United Network for Organ
Sharing. Moreover, 30% of deceased donors were older
than 70 and 10% were older than 80 years (Figure 3). An
“old-for-old” allocation strategy has been devised from
the beginning, whereby aged kidneys are preferentially
allocated to aged recipients regardless of HLA mismatch,
as also performed in other European programs (22). As
expected,
the
utilization
rate
(percentage
of
actual
donors from whom at least one organ is transplanted)
and the number of organs transplanted per donor for
donors older than 60 years are reduced (80% and two
organs transplanted per donor, respectively). However,
these donors contribute to transplantation activities in a
substantial manner—41% of the deceased kidney, 51%
of the liver, and 24% of the lung transplant procedures
are currently performed with organs recovered from
donors within this age group. Discard rates of organs
recovered from aged donors remain, however, high.
Further analysis and work should lead the system to
conclude whether organ discard is based on objective
factors related to posttransplantation outcomes and to
determine the role of, for example, ex vivo perfusion
techniques
in
better
assessing
organ
viability
while
allowing the reconditioning of organs.
Organ transplantation from aged deceased donors has
been associated with suboptimal patient and graft sur-
vival. However, results are acceptable and the practice
confers survival benefits compared with that of patients
who remain on the waiting list. In a recent registry study
undertaken in the region of Catalonia, 10-year death-
censored graft survival in recipients of kidneys from
donors ≥75 years of age was 68%. More importantly,
recipients of these kidneys had less than half the probabil-
ity of death than their matched counterparts under dialysis
therapy and waitlisted for kidney transplantation (23).
Similarly, the use of livers from aged donors provides
appropriate outcomes. Estimates of 1- and 5-year graft
survival
for
recipients
of
livers
from
donors
aged
≥75 years are 78% and 59%, respectively (24). Good
results are especially obtained when applying strict donor
selection criteria, and when avoiding the allocation of
these livers into recipients with advanced liver disease
(high MELD score) and with hepatitis C virus (HCV) cir-
rhosis (25).
Nonstandard risk donors:
External audits of procure-
ment hospitals in Spain have revealed that 25% of
persons in a brain-dead condition are not considered
medically suitable organ donors, although some of these
medical contraindications are inappropriately established
by the donor coordinator or the treating physician (10).
While
safety
of
the
process
is
an
unquestionable
professional standard, an evidence-based analysis of the
risks should guide decisions on donor selection at a
moment of organ shortage. The aging of the donor
population is also inherently linked to progressively more
difficult assessments of donor suitability.
The ONT has implemented a medical team available on a
24/7 basis for donor coordinators to ask for a second
opinion regarding the medical suitability of potential
organ donors. National Consensus Documents on the
evaluation of organ donors to prevent the transmission
of neoplasic diseases and with regard to infections have
also been important elements in addressing the problem
of inadequate donor losses on medical grounds (26,27).
These documents have inspired recommendations on
donor suitability at the Council of Europe level (28). More
recently, to clearly define the safety limits in the use of
American Journal of Transplantation 2017; 17: 1447–1454
1451
40 Donors per Million Population
 organs for transplantation, the ONT has developed a
specific national registry on the prospective follow-up of
recipients transplanted from nonstandard risk donors (i.e.
history of malignancy or active infection). With complete
follow-up available on 430 recipients of nonstandard risk
donor organs, only one case of disease transmission has
been reported. This was an anticipated transmission of a
HCV infection from an anti–HCV-positive donor to an
HCV-na€
ıve heart recipient in an urgent status. Information
provided by this registry is contributing to increase the
level of evidence that will guide future risk assessments
in the evaluation of organ donors.
Developing the framework for the practice of
donation after circulatory death
Contrary to that described for other countries, DCD in
Spain had been classically focused on Maastricht cate-
gory II or uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) donors—persons
who have been declared dead after an unsuccessfully
resuscitated cardiac arrest. This particular type of DCD
implies an important logistical effort, both inside and out-
side of the hospital, and a smooth cooperation between
the different stakeholders involved (29). Legal, ethical,
and the aforementioned complexities have precluded
many countries from embarking on this type of donation
despite efforts to emulate this program in other realities
(30). Even within Spain, because of the degree of sophis-
tication required, the activity was initially limited to three
Spanish cities—A Coru~
na, Barcelona, and Madrid. Follow-
ing national recommendations, and support by national
and local authorities, other programs have been initiated,
with a positive impact on the number of uDCD donors,
although the activity has stabilized thereafter (Figure 1).
At present, there are 11 uDCD programs in the country,
yielding an important number of kidney transplants with
impressive results (29). Liver transplantation from uDCD
donors has been made possible with a normothermic
regional perfusion approach, which leads to reasonable
outcomes close to those obtained with livers from DBD
donors (29). Results of lung transplantation from uDCD
donors are also promising (29). The contribution of
ex vivo preservation strategies to the validation and
repair of kidneys, livers, and lungs from uDCD donors is
currently under study.
cDCD had not been devised as an option in our country
for many years. The aforementioned changes in end-of-
life care were the main reason to reconsider the position

 of the country toward cDCD and eliminate the existing
moratorium on its practice. A National Consensus Con-
ference on DCD set down the basis for this practice in
Spain and was followed by the development of new leg-
islation that accommodated the possibility of cDCD and
established the minimum requisites for its development
(31,32). Along with institutional support and efforts in
professional training and public education, the results of
the initiative have been impressive (Figure 1). Today, >50
hospitals in the country are embarked in cDCD, which
already contributes to 10% of the overall deceased dona-
tion rates and has had a substantial impact on the kid-
ney, but also the liver and lung transplantation activity,
with excellent posttransplantation results so far (33,34).
The experience with normothermic regional perfusion in
the uDCD setting has been extended to cDCD in 12 cen-
ters. Spain will be able to address the question of
whether normothermic regional perfusion confers advan-
tages compared with the rapid recovery of organs in
cDCD—in terms of number of organs available, post-
transplantation
survival,
and
incidence
of
ischemic
cholangiopathy in the liver transplant setting.
Final Remarks and Conclusions
Organization around the process of deceased donation is
the
key
for
success
of
the
Spanish
system.
This
approach has been totally or partially replicated by other
countries and regions, resulting in a progression in the
pursuit of self-sufficiency in transplantation. The model
can be indeed implemented in other realities as long as
some basic conditions are guaranteed (35). New chal-
lenges are being confronted by the system—the trans-
plantation needs of the population are expected to
increase, while the potential of donation might continue
decreasing in the upcoming years, particularly for DBD.
Novel strategies to adapt to this changing scenario,
inclusive of ICOD, the use of organs from expanded and
nonstandard risk donors and DCD are being explored
and successfully implemented in Spain. This experience
may inspire other countries to conceive new ways of
dealing with the limited availability of deceased donor
organs.
