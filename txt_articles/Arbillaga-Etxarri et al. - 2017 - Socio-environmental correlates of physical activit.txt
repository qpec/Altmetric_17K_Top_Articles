ABSTRACT
Background Study of the causes of the reduced levels
of physical activity in patients with COPD has been
scarce and limited to biological factors.
Aim To assess the relationship between novel socio-
environmental factors, namely dog walking,
grandparenting, neighbourhood deprivation, residential
surrounding greenness and residential proximity to green
or blue spaces, and amount and intensity of physical
activity in COPD patients.
Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 410
COPD patients from five Catalan municipalities. Dog
walking and grandparenting were assessed by
questionnaire. Neighbourhood deprivation was assessed
using the census Urban Vulnerability Index, residential
surrounding greenness by the satellite-derived
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and residential
proximity to green or blue spaces as living within 300 m
of such a space. Physical activity was measured during
1 week by accelerometer to assess time spent on
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vector
magnitude units (VMU) per minute.
Findings Patients were 85% male, had a mean (SD)
age of 69 (9) years, and post-bronchodilator FEV1 of 56
(17) %pred. After adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic
status, dyspnoea, exercise capacity and anxiety in a
linear regression model, both dog walking and
grandparenting were significantly associated with an
increase both in time in MVPA (18 min/day (p<0.01)
and 9 min/day (p<0.05), respectively) and in physical
activity intensity (76 VMU/min (p=0.05) and 59 VMUs/
min (p<0.05), respectively). Neighbourhood deprivation,
surrounding greenness and proximity to green or blue
spaces were not associated with physical activity.
Conclusions Dog walking and grandparenting are
associated with a higher amount and intensity of
physical activity in COPD patients.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with COPD are substantially less active than
their healthy peers1 due to progressive airflow
limitation,
abnormal
gas
exchange,
skeletal
muscle dysfunction, comorbidities and behavioural
changes.2 However, maintaining a sufficient amount
of physical activity is critical for the patients’ prog-
nosis, quality of life and mortality.3 Thus, increasing
physical activity has been recently included as a rele-
vant health outcome of a wide range of interven-
tions,
including
pharmacological
treatment,4
pulmonary rehabilitation5 and interventions based
on behavioural strategies such as self-monitoring,
self-efficacy, motivation, goal setting and feedback.6
Of note, only one study so far has shown a sustained
long term increase in physical activity, exclusively in
a subgroup of patients who were not sufficiently
active at baseline.7
It has been argued that this absence of effective-
ness could be due to lack of knowledge concerning
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What is the relationship between socio-
environmental factors, namely dog walking,
grandparenting, neighbourhood deprivation,
residential surrounding greenness and
residential proximity to green or blue spaces,
and amount and intensity of physical activity in
COPD patients?
What is the bottom line?
▸ The study shows, for the first time, that
interpersonal relationship factors, specifically
dog walking and grandparenting, are related to
both the amount and intensity of physical
activity in COPD patients independent of
airflow limitation and other biological or
psychological parameters.
Why read on?
▸ Understanding the socio-environmental
characteristics of COPD patients, including
family duties and/or leisure time preferences, is
central to tailoring physical activity
recommendations in the clinical setting as well
as to designing and testing interventions to
modify their physical activity behaviour.

 the causes of physical activity behaviour.8 Remarkably, the
number of studies on physical activity determinants in COPD
patients is lower than the number of studies assessing interven-
tions to modulate this behaviour.3 Moreover, study of physical
activity determinants in COPD patients has been limited to indi-
vidual factors, mostly in the psychological and biological areas.
This is in contrast with the commonly accepted socio-ecological
models guiding most research on physical activity determinants
in the general population and in patients with other chronic
diseases.9
Socio-ecological models explain physical activity as being
affected by psychological, biological and socio-environmental
characteristics, and their interactions, both at the individual and
population levels. To facilitate the study of socio-environmental
characteristics and physical activity, three main dimensions have
been described: social inequality, interpersonal relationships and
neighbourhood characteristics.10 In patients with COPD, only
social inequality has been investigated as a potential determinant
of physical activity through the application of common mea-
sures of socio-economic status (SES), such as educational or
occupational categories, and has shown inconsistent associations
with physical activity.3 However, interpersonal relationships
such as walking the dog or grandparenting have not previously
been investigated despite the potential of interpersonal relation-
ships to affect physical activity behaviour.10 Likewise, neigh-
bourhood characteristics, such as the proximity of parks within
walking distance or lower neighbourhood deprivation levels,
have been associated with higher levels of physical activity in
the general population,11 although they have not previously
been tested in patients with COPD.
W
e
aimed
to
assess
the
relationship
of
novel
socio-
environmental factors (dog walking, grandparenting, neighbour-
hood
deprivation,
residential
surrounding
greenness,
and
residential proximity to green or blue spaces) with the physical
activity level of stable mild-to-very severe patients with COPD
from five Mediterranean municipalities.
METHODS
Study design and population
This
cross-sectional
analysis
used
baseline
data
from
the
ongoing multicentre trial ‘Effectiveness of an intervention of
urban training in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease
(COPD):
a
randomized
controlled
trial’
(NCT01897298).12 W
e first identified all patients with a COPD
diagnosis
(according
to
American
Thoracic
Society
and
European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) criteria)13 from 33
primary care centres and five tertiary hospitals of five seaside
municipalities
in
Catalonia:
Barcelona,
Badalona,
Mataró,
Viladecans and Gavà (see online supplementary table S1 for
their population and area characteristics). Exclusion criteria
were: spending >3 months/year away from their home address,
mental disability, severe psychiatric disease, comorbidity limiting
survival to 1 year, or any other severe comorbidity. Between
October 2013 and February 2015, all candidate patients were
approached
in
random
order
within
each
municipality
(Viladecans and Gavà were grouped together because they are
adjacent municipalities). Patients were consecutively included
until the end of the recruitment period specified for each geo-
graphical area based on the primary objective of the study.
A total of 410 clinically stable (defined as at least 4 weeks
without antibiotics or oral corticosteroids) patients with COPD
were enrolled: 189 patients from Barcelona, 30 from Badalona,
73 from Mataró and 119 from Viladecans/Gavà. The study was
approved
by
the
Ethics
Committees
of
all
participating
institutions and written informed consent was obtained from
each participant.
Variables and instruments
All patients answered an interviewer-administered questionnaire
about dog ownership (question: ‘Do you have a dog at home?’),
dog walking (if positive to having a dog, ‘Do you walk the
dog?’), having grandchildren (‘Do you have grandchildren?’)
and grandparenting (if positive to having grandchildren, ‘Do
you take care of them or collaborate in their care?’). The ques-
tionnaire also included data on education, marital status,
working status, occupation, number of people living at home,
smoking status, dyspnoea (assessed using the modified Medical
Research Council scale (mMRC)), health-related quality of life
(assessed using the COPD Assessment T
est (CAT)), and anxiety
and depression symptoms (assessed using the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression scale (HAD)). SES was obtained from questions
on employment characteristics, and classified using the National
Statistics Socio-economic Classification into six categories (I,
professional; II, managerial and technical; IIIN, skilled non-
manual; IIIM, skilled manual; IV
, partly skilled; and V
, unskilled
occupations).
Comorbidities
were
assessed
from
medical
records. Body mass index (BMI) was obtained by physical
examination. FEV1 and FVC before and after bronchodilator
use, and distance walked in the 6-min walking test (6MWD)
were determined following standardised methodology.
W
e geocoded patients’ addresses to assess individual measures
of neighbourhood deprivation, residential surrounding green-
ness,
and
residential
proximity
to
green
or
blue
spaces.
Neighbourhood deprivation was assessed using the Urban
Vulnerability Index14 which is a measure of neighbourhood SES
at the census tract level (median area of 0.26 km2) ranging from
0 (lowest) to 1 (highest level of neighbourhood deprivation).
T
o measure residential surrounding greenness, we used the
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is an
indicator of green (ie, photosynthetically active) vegetation
density based on the difference between visible red and near-
infrared surface reflectance. It was derived from Landsat 8 satel-
lite images with a 30 m×30 m spatial resolution during the
greenness season in 2014. NDVI has a range from −1 to +1,
with higher values indicating a high density of green vegeta-
tion.15 Residential surrounding greenness was abstracted as the
average NDVI in 100, 300, 500 and 1000 m buffers from
patients’ addresses calculated for both network and Euclidean
distances. Average NDVI in a network distance of 300 m was
used as the main measure of residential surrounding greenness;
the remaining variables were included in sensitivity analyses.
W
e identified outdoor green (ie, green urban areas, agricul-
tural land and pastures, and forests or country parks) and blue
(ie, inland and non-inland water bodies) spaces of ≥0.25 ha. W
e
calculated the network distance between participants’ home
addresses and the closest green or blue space. Following previ-
ous studies16 and European Commission recommendations,17
we defined residential proximity as living within 300 m of a
green or blue space (equivalent to a 15 min walk).
Physical activity was objectively measured using the Dynaport
accelerometer
(McRoberts,
The
Hague,
The
Netherlands),
which has been shown to be a valid tool for measuring physical
activity in COPD subjects.18 Patients were instructed to wear it
attached to the centre of their lower back with an elastic strap
for 1 week. A valid physical activity measurement was previously
defined as a minimum of 3 days with at least 8 hours of wearing
time per day.19 The main outcomes of the amount and intensity
of
physical
activity
were,

the bivariate relationship between each socio-environmental

(dog

neighbourhood
deprivation, residential surrounding greenness, and residential
proximity to green or blue spaces) and each physical activity
variable (time spent on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,
VMU per minute, steps, walking time and time spent on physi-
cal activities) using Student’s t-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-W
allis, and
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. Second, a multivari-
able regression model was built for each physical activity
variable. As the physical activity variables were normally distri-
buted, we used linear regression. Each model included as expos-
ure variables those socio-environmental characteristics that had
exhibited a p value <0.2 in the corresponding bivariate analysis.

that
could affect walking, and municipality were tested as potential
confounders. Model building combined step-forward and back-
ward algorithms, and covariates were included in the final
model if (i) they related to both the exposure and the outcome
in bivariable analysis, (ii) they modified (>10% change in
regression coefficient) the estimates of the remaining variables
in the multivariable models, or (iii) there was consistent evi-
dence in the literature of their association with physical activity.
Goodness of fit was assessed by means of normality of residuals,
heteroscedasticity, linearity, co-linearity, and identification of
influential data.
Potential effect modification on the studied associations was
evaluated by stratification of the final models according to sex,
COPD severity stages (mild-to-moderate and severe-to-very
severe), municipality and neighbourhood deprivation (cate-
gorised by its median value), and statistical testing of the inter-
action term. Sensitivity analysis was conducted (i) excluding
subjects with extreme values (>99th percentile) in the acceler-
ometer measures, (ii) using a mixed effects linear model to
account for the potential correlation between subjects within a
municipality as a random intercept, and (iii) using alternative
distance measures to calculate residential surrounding greenness
as detailed in the Methods section. Analysis was conducted
using a complete case approach in Stata V
.14.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, T
exas, USA).
RESULTS
Patients were mostly male (85%) and had a mean (SD) age of
69 (9) years (table 1). According to the ATS/ERS classification,
9% of patients had mild, 53% moderate, 31% severe and 7%
very severe COPD. According to the GOLD ABCD classifica-
tion, 23% of patients were in group A, 31% in B, 13% in C and
33% in D. Patients walked a mean of 486 (95) m in the 6MWT
.
Only 12% and 38% of patients reported walking the dog or
grandparenting, respectively. Half of the patients had green or
blue spaces within 300 m of their homes. All patients fulfilled
the criterion of wearing time per day (median wearing days 7,
range 3–7; median recording time 14.9 hours, range 11.1–15 of
15 hours maximum from 7:00 to 22:00). Patients spent a mean
of almost 3 hours/day on physical activity and half of this acti-
vity was at least of moderate intensity (table 1).
Figure 1 shows that dog walking and grandparenting were sig-
nificantly associated with both higher amount and higher inten-
sity of physical activity. However, neighbourhood deprivation,
residential surrounding greenness, or residential proximity to
green or blue spaces were not related to physical activity para-
meters. Online supplementary tables S2 and S3 show the bivari-
ate
associations
between
potential
confounders
and
both
exposures and outcomes. After adjusting for age, sex, SES,

 smoking, dyspnoea, exercise capacity and anxiety, dog walking
was significantly associated with an increase in moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity of 18 min/day (p<0.01), and an
increase in physical activity intensity of 76 VMUs/min (p=0.05),
as compared to not walking a dog (table 2). Grandparenting was
also related to both higher amount and higher intensity of phys-
ical activity after adjusting for potential confounders (table 2).
Very similar associations were obtained for steps and times
engaged in walking and physical activity of any intensity (see
online supplementary table S4). There was no interaction
between dog walking and grandparenting in their association
with physical activity amount or intensity. Goodness of fit tests
did not reveal any abnormality.
After stratification by sex, the association between grandpar-
enting and time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was
observed only in men (p-for-interaction=0.02) (see tables 3 and
online supplementary table S5). No differences were observed
after
stratification
according
to
COPD
severity
stage
(mild-to-moderate and severe-to-very severe), municipality and
neighbourhood deprivation. Sensitivity analysis excluding sub-
jects
with
extreme
physical
activity
values
(see
online
supplementary table S6) or using a mixed effects linear model
(see online supplementary table S7) showed very similar esti-
mates. Alternative buffers to calculate residential surrounding
greenness did not provide additional information (see online
supplementary figure S1).
DISCUSSION
W
e
assessed
the
relationship
between
socio-environmental
factors
and the physical activity level of
clinically stable
mild-to-very severe patients with COPD and found, for the first
time, that dog walking and grandparenting are both associated
with a higher amount and intensity of physical activity in COPD
patients. However, the characteristics of green or blue spaces
surrounding patients’ homes were not associated with physical
activity practice.
These results are consistent with previous research showing
that dog walking is associated with higher physical activity in

Whether this association may be extrapolated into an effective
intervention to increase physical activity in patients with COPD
is still a matter of debate. A recent review highlighted that dog
walking constitutes a specific behaviour different from other
physical activities or even other types of walking because it has
its specific barriers and facilitators and takes place in a specific
individual, mental, physical, social and environmental context.
For example, concerns about dogs coming into contact with
children or other park users, crowded places, and large or
uncontrolled dogs have been identified as barriers to dog
walking. On the other hand, accessible appropriate public open
spaces for dogs or neighbourhood walkability act as facilitators
for this activity.20 Therefore, before interventions are designed
for improving physical activity by means of dogs, research is
needed to understand the specific characteristics of patients with
COPD who walk their dogs and the factors influencing dog
walking behaviour in this population.23
The patients with COPD who reported grandparenting exhi-
bited higher levels of physical activity amount and intensity.
Indeed, previous studies had already shown that grandparenting
had significant benefits for grandparents’ physical and mental
health,24–26 but this had never been tested in chronically ill
patients, such as those with COPD. Interestingly
, patients with
COPD have reported that caring for and playing with grandchil-
dren is a motivator to undertake a pulmonary rehabilitation pro-
gramme.27 Thus, grandparenting may represent an excellent
opportunity for promoting physical activity in this aging popula-
tion. Our finding that the benefits for physical activity may be
restricted to grandfathers needs a cautious interpretation because
of a lack of statistical power in the female group (15% of the
sample). W
e hypothesise that grandmothers caring for grandchil-
dren may carry out domestic tasks, like cooking or feeding the
grandchildren, which do not require intense physical activity,
while grandfathers may spend more time outdoors, picking grand-
children up, or playing with them. Previous studies have reported
different effects of grandparenting depending on sex.24 26
W
e did not find any association between residential surround-
ing greenness and residential proximity to green or blue spaces
and physical activity in our patients with COPD. In the general
adult population, the proximity and number of green spaces
around the home has been related to higher levels of physical
activity,11 but this association has not been shown to be consist-
ent across studies.28 In fact, a recent study carried out in
Barcelona showed that perceived proximity to green spaces, but
not objective proximity, was associated with higher physical
activity.29 It has been reported that the relationship between the
built environment and physical activity characteristics is not
equal for the entire population but modulated by sex, age, SES
or working status.30 31 W
e hypothesise that, in subjects with
limited exercise capacity like patients with COPD, the ability of
a favourable built environment to stimulate physical activity
could be lower than in healthy subjects. This is supported by a
recent study showing that the aesthetics of the built environ-
ment were related to physical activity levels only in healthy sub-
jects but not in those with chronic disease.32 Therefore, despite
the increasing evidence of the association between the built
environment and physical activity in the general adult popula-
tion, qualitative and quantitative research is required to deter-
mine how the built environment affects behaviour in patients
with COPD or other chronic diseases before considering the use
of green or blue spaces to promote their physical activity.
Neighbourhood deprivation was not associated with physical
activity in our study, which could be partially explained by the
small variability in the urban vulnerability score in the five
included municipalities. However, low SES was associated with
a higher amount and greater intensity of physical activity, at
variance with previous studies in patients with COPD from
Barcelona that reported higher physical activity in the higher
SES categories.3 Such a difference could be attributed to the fact
that the current study included patients from middle-sized muni-
cipalities with population densities and historical urban back-
grounds different from that of Barcelona, which could result in
different social behaviour.33
The results of this study provide novel and original informa-
tion to help enhance physical activity for patients with COPD in
the clinical setting, highlighting the potential of interpersonal
relationships as determinants of behaviour. Questioning the
patients about their family duties and/or leisure time preferences
can help professionals customise physical activity recommenda-
tions. In patients with diabetes for example, the necessity of
encouraging dog walking or identifying other activities that
promote a regular commitment to undertake physical activity
has been recognized.21 Our results support the advice concern-
ing dog walking, which can be used in patients who already
own a dog but otherwise needs a deep understanding of patient
preferences and fears. Grandparenting and, in general, encour-

 responsibilities, may be an effective way to increase their phys-
ical activity. Current findings also indicate that that clinical
COPD recommendations should include social and environmen-
tal factors as part of the basic medical assessment.2 Finally,
although our findings indicate that greenness or proximity to
green or blue spaces is not associated with patients’ physical
activity, these spaces could be used as part of a complementary
strategy to promote physical activity in patients with COPD.
The strengths of this study are the novelty of the approach,
including individual and community socio-environmental vari-
ables, the use of an objective measure of physical activity that
prevents misclassification at the individual level, and the wide
distribution of patients across COPD severity grades. Moreover,
recruitment of patients from both primary and tertiary care
centres, adds external validity to our study, as demonstrated by
the fact that our patients exhibit less disease severity than that
observed in previous randomised trials and similar to that from
other primary care COPD cohorts.34 The recruitment from
several municipalities with diverse socio-environmental condi-
tions also increases generalisability, although limited to the
context of Euro-Mediterranean cities.
A limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study, so the
directionality
of
the
associations
cannot
be
established.
However, we consider it highly unlikely that patients with
COPD at that age change their family situation or move as a
result of their physical activity levels. The lack of other measure-
ments of physical environment, such as the quality of green
spaces, street walkability, sport facilities, connectivity, car traffic,
noise and air pollution, may have limited our ability to under-
stand the neighbourhood physical activity determinants in
patients with COPD. Indeed, these outcomes need to be
addressed in future investigations. Finally, as alluded to above,
the results of this study may not be extrapolated to cities with
very different cultural or climatic conditions, so more studies
targeting different COPD populations are needed.
In conclusion, dog walking and grandparenting are associated
with a higher amount and intensity of physical activity in
patients with COPD. The social characteristics of patients with
COPD should be considered to promote physical activity both
at the clinical level and in future research.
