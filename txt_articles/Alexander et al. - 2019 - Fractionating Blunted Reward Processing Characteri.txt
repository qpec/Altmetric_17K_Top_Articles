SUMMARY
Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression, but
the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are un-
known. Correlative neuroimaging studies implicate
dysfunction within ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
but the causal roles of specific subregions remain un-
identified. We addressed these issues by combining
intracerebral
microinfusions
with
cardiovascular
and behavioral monitoring in marmoset monkeys to
show that over-activation of primate subgenual ante-
rior cingulate cortex (sgACC, area 25) blunts appeti-
tive anticipatory, but not consummatory, arousal,
whereas manipulations of adjacent perigenual ACC
(pgACC, area 32) have no effect. sgACC/25 over-
activation also reduces the willingness to work for
reward. 18F-FDG PET imaging reveals over-activation
induced metabolic changes in circuits involved
in reward processing and interoception. Ketamine
treatment
ameliorates
the
blunted
anticipatory
arousal and reverses associated metabolic changes.
These results demonstrate a causal role for pri-
mate sgACC/25 over-activity in selective aspects of
impaired reward processing translationally relevant
to anhedonia, and ketamine’s modulation of an af-
fective network to exert its action.
INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating
condition that contributes significantly to global disease burden
(Ferrari et al., 2013). Anhedonia—defined as a loss of interest or
pleasure in all or almost all activities—is a core feature of MDD as
outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders (DSM-V; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The
clinical importance of anhedonia is illustrated by its high preva-
lence (Keller et al., 1995) and its robustness as a negative prog-
nostic indicator (Spijker et al., 2001; Uher et al., 2012). Despite
this, anhedonia remains poorly characterized both psycholog-
ically and neurobiologically.
Psychologically, the majority of studies fail to recognize its
distinct behavioral subtypes, including anticipatory, motiva-
tional, and consummatory components (for discussion, see
Der-Avakian and Markou, 2012; Treadway and Zald, 2011).
Instead, clinical and preclinical measures of anhedonia are
almost exclusively consummatory. Clinical studies use scales
to measure anhedonia such as the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Scale
(Fawcett et al., 1983) and the Chapman Physical Anhedonia
Scale (Chapman et al., 1976), in which the items are primarily
concerned with the hedonic (consummatory) responses to
reward. Similarly, rodent studies typically measure sucrose con-
sumption/preference as an overall index of anhedonia (Ferenczi
et al., 2016; Tye et al., 2013). However, there is a fundamental
disconnect between the construct assessed in these studies
and the pattern of impairments manifested in people with
depression, who typically display anhedonic symptoms in antic-
ipatory and motivational domains (Klein, 1987; McFarland and
Klein, 2009; Treadway and Zald, 2011) with relatively intact
consummatory responses to rewards (Amsterdam et al., 1987;
Arrondo et al., 2015; Berlin et al., 1998; Dichter et al., 2010;
although see McCabe et al., 2012 for neural changes during
consummatory processing in at-risk groups).
Neurobiologically,
while correlative human neuroimaging
studies have implicated subregions of the ventromedial prefron-
tal cortex (vmPFC) in the etiology of depression, the precise
anatomical locus of these changes varies throughout the subge-
nual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the perigenual ante-
rior cingulate cortex (pgACC). In depressed subjects, over-
activity in sgACC (including area 25) has been reported (Drevets
et al., 2008; Keedwell et al., 2009; Mayberg et al., 2005), together
with increased resting-state functional connectivity of this region
to the default-mode network (Greicius et al., 2007). In neigh-
boring pgACC (including area 32), there are variable reports of
under-activity (Fitzgerald et al., 2008; Ito et al., 1996; Mayberg
et al., 1994) and over-activity (Drevets et al., 1992; Ebert and
Ebmeier, 1996). Comparatively fewer studies have assessed
the involvement of these regions in anhedonia specifically and

 those that have implicate pgACC/32 (Harvey et al., 2007; Keed-
well et al., 2005) and more caudal sgACC (Dunn et al., 2002), but
their causal roles remain unknown. Although vmPFC lesions
in humans have been linked to reduced anticipatory arousal
prior to risky decisions (Bechara et al., 1996), the interpretation
of these results is confounded by a lack of anatomical speci-
ficity—the damage associated with lesions is neither restricted
to a specific vmPFC subregion, nor is it restricted to gray matter
(damaging underlying fibers of passage). Similarly, the only
non-human primate study investigating the role of sgACC/25
in reward-related behavior utilized aspiration lesions, compli-
cating interpretation due to white matter damage (Rudebeck
et al., 2014).
While targeted interventional studies in rodents have also at-
tempted to address the issue of causality, progress has been
hampered and translation made difficult owing to (1) a lack of
understanding regarding the extent to which anatomical homol-
ogy relates to functional equivalence (Myers-Schulz and Koe-
nigs, 2012; Wallis et al., 2017), (2) a failure to differentiate
between the functionally distinct prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic
(IL) mPFC sectors in the rodent (for example, Ferenczi et al.,
2016), and (3) a lack of validity of the rodent sucrose consump-
tion test as a measure of anhedonia relevant to depression
(Dwyer, 2012). The issue is therefore best addressed by using
interventional studies in non-human primates in which the
anatomical organization of the vmPFC most closely resembles
that of humans, and by recognizing the distinct subtypes of
reward-related deficits that likely underlie anhedonia.
The present
study
determined
whether
over-activity
in
sgACC/25 and under-/over-activity in pgACC/32 reported in
depressed humans can cause translationally relevant deficits
in reward processing in a non-human primate. By combining
intracerebral infusions with positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-
glucose (18F-FDG), we also determined the network of brain re-
gions associated with the observed deficits. Since ketamine has
recently emerged as a promising glutamate-based antidepres-
sant demonstrating efficacy in treating reward processing defi-
cits (Lally et al., 2014, 2015; Parsaik et al., 2015), we determined
the efficacy of ketamine to alleviate these deficits along with
associated circuit-wide changes.
RESULTS
An overview of the subjects used in these experiments is shown
in Table 1. Additional details of experimental histories together
with numbers of infusions are shown in Table S1. Histological
assessment of cannula placement and drug-induced c-fos
expression is shown in Figure S1.
sgACC/25 Over-Activation Blunts Anticipatory, but Not
Consummatory, Arousal for Reward, whereas pgACC/
32 Manipulations Have No Effect
Following surgery and recovery (experimental outline shown in
Figure 1A), marmosets (n = 6) acquired appetitive Pavlovian
discriminative cardiovascular and behavioral arousal responses
to an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS+) predicting the pres-
ence of high-incentive food reward (unconditioned stimulus,
US+), but not to a second auditory stimulus (CS�) predicting
the absence of food reward (US�; Figures 1B and 1C). Success-
ful discrimination was evident in cardiovascular responses as an
increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during the CS+
(compared to the 20 s pre-CS baseline period), but not during
the CS� (Figures 1C and S2A). During the US+ consummatory
period, a rise in MAP was observed above the rise seen during
the CS+ with no change during the US� (Figures 1C and S2B).
Marmosets fail to show MAP rises when consuming non-
preferred foods (Braesicke et al., 2005), suggesting that the in-
crease observed during the US+ period was due to hedonic—
rather than ingestive—factors. Heart rate (HR) responses were
variable: while there was a trend toward discrimination during
the CS period (Figure S2C), no discrimination was evident during

 the US period (Figure S2D). MAP is therefore used as the prin-
cipal cardiovascular measurement throughout the study owing
to its sensitivity as a discriminative measure of anticipatory and
consummatory arousal.
Behaviorally, both discriminative conditioned CS-directed and
conditioned US-directed behaviors were exhibited during the
CS period. The principal CS-directed behavior was a rapid
‘‘head-jerk,’’ previously described in rodents (Holland, 1977)
and marmosets (Reekie et al., 2008) as an orienting response
to an auditory appetitive CS. Animals developed increased
head-jerking behavior during the CS+, but not the CS� (Fig-
ure S2E). The US-directed measure used was nose-poking to-
ward the feeder box, but this did not discriminate between CS
type (Figure S2F). During the US+, the amount of food consumed
was used as the behavioral index of reward consumption. The
latency to begin eating food reward was also measured.
To over-activate sgACC/25, marmosets received infusions of
dihydrokainic acid (DHK; excitatory amino acid transporter-2
[EAAT2] inhibitor) to reduce glutamate reuptake (n = 5) and/or
CGP52432/ LY341495 (CGP/LY; GABAB receptor antagonist/
mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist) to increase pre-synaptic glutamate
release (n = 6). DHK-induced over-activation of sgACC/25 blunt-
ed anticipatory, but not consummatory, arousal, selectively
reducing cardiovascular and behavioral responses during the
anticipatory CS+ period (Figures 2A and 2B), but not during the
consummatory US+ period (Figures 2C and 2D). CGP/LY over-
activation of sgACC/25 resulted in the same pattern of blunting
(Figure S3). Neither manipulation caused a significant change
in the latency to eat the food reward (Table S2), nor were there
any changes in locomotor activity during the baseline or CS pe-
riods (Table S3). Both methods of over-activation tended to
elevate HR during the baseline period (Figures S4A and S4B).
DHK infusions had no effect on baseline MAP (Figure S4C), while
CGP/LY infusions elevated baseline MAP (Figure S4D). Never-
theless, the effect of CGP/LY to blunt CS+ cardiovascular
arousal is unlikely due to a ceiling effect associated with
raised baseline MAP because MAP still increased during the
consummatory period. Neither method had any effect on base-
line head-jerk numbers (which were infrequent; Figures S4E
and S4F). In contrast to sgACC/25 over-activation, we found
no effect of sgACC/25 inactivation (muscimol/baclofen [MB];
GABAA/GABAB receptor agonist) on arousal during either
reward anticipation or consumption (Figure S5), suggesting
that sgACC/25 activity is not necessary for the expression of
these appetitive responses.
Despite numerous neuroimaging studies implicating both un-
der- and over-activity in pgACC/32 in depression and anhe-
donia, we found that neither bilateral pgACC/32 over-activation
(using DHK or CGP/LY) nor bilateral pgACC/32 inactivation
(using MB) had any effect on anticipatory CS or consummatory
US arousal (Figure S6). This suggests that activity changes in
pgACC/32 are not causally related to basic reward processing
deficits and may reflect deficits in using reward information in de-
cision-making (Amemori et al., 2015) or compensatory changes.
Additional analyses of variance were carried out on absolute
MAP values and head-jerk values (rather than CS-directed
values) using phase as a factor (baseline versus CS+) for all
sgACC/25 and pgACC/32 infusions. These results are reported
in Table S4 and confirm the conclusions reported above.
sgACC/25 Over-Activation Impairs the Willingness to
Work for Reward on an Instrumental Progressive Ratio
Schedule of Reinforcement
To characterize the extent of the reward processing deficit
further, the effects of over-activation of sgACC/25 (using DHK)
on instrumental progressive ratio performance were assessed.
Marmosets (n = 3) were trained to respond to a visual stimulus
on a touchscreen under increasingly demanding reinforcement
requirements until a breakpoint (2 min of inactivity) was reached
(Figures 3A and 3B). Bilateral over-activation of sgACC/25 signif-
icantly impaired progressive ratio performance, reducing the
breakpoint to levels significantly below both the previous day
(�70.3% ± 12.5%; mean ± SEM) and control infusions
(�69.5% ± 11.6%; mean ± SEM) (Figure 3C). This effect was

surgery, marmosets were habituated to the testing
apparatus for 5–10 sessions, trained on the
appetitive discrimination task until criterion was
reached (significant MAP discrimination over three
CS+/CS� sessions, two-tailed paired t test), and
then cannulated to target sgACC/25 alone or both
sgACC/25 and pgACC/32. Following re-attain-
ment

manipulations took place.

 independent of individual marmosets’ baseline level of respond-
ing—higher and lower responders showed similar, marked
impairments (Figure 3D).
sgACC/25 Over-Activation Has No Effect on Sucrose
Preference or Consumption, Despite These Being
Common Preclinical Analogs of Anhedonia
We also investigated reward consumption in a manner directly
comparable to rodent studies using a sucrose preference test
adapted for marmosets (n = 4; Figure 3E). Measurements of su-
crose and water consumption were taken every 30 min across a
2-hr testing session, with an a priori interest in the first 30-min
window owing to the rapid action of intracranial infusions. In
the session prior to manipulations, marmosets showed a high
preference for sucrose solution over water and consumed large
amounts of sucrose in both the first 30 min and across the 2-hr
testing window (Figures 3F and 3G). As a positive control, we
assessed the effects of peripheral injections of the opioid antag-
onist naloxone—a putative modulator of the hedonic ‘‘liking’’
system. In the first 30 min of the session, naloxone had no effect
on sucrose preference (Figure S7A) but did reduce both sucrose
consumption and water consumption (Figure S7B). Across the
entire 2-hr period, naloxone reduced sucrose consumption
without affecting water consumption with the strongest effects
at later time points (Figure S7C). When assessing potential
consummatory effects induced by sgACC/25 over-activation,
we therefore measured both sucrose preference (reduced in
rodent models of depression) and absolute sucrose consump-
tion (reduced by naloxone and in rodent models of depression)
to fully ascertain the presence of any potential consummatory
impairment. Over-activation of sgACC/25 had no effect on
sucrose preference or consumption in the first 30 min (Figures
3H and 3I), nor across the 2-hr session (Figure 3J), demon-
strating that while over-activity in this region can cause anticipa-
tory and motivational impairments, it has no obvious effect on
reward consumption.
sgACC/25 Over-Activation Does Not Cause a General
Blunting in Emotional Arousal
Despite having no effect on consummatory arousal, it is still
possible that the anticipatory and motivational impairments
observed following sgACC/25 over-activation are due to a
more general blunting of effect. We therefore determined the
effects of sgACC/25 over-activation (using DHK) on emotional
arousal in the human intruder test (n = 3), where marmosets
are confronted with an uncertain threat in the form of a non-
familiar human. When confronted with an intruder in their home
cage, marmosets maintain distance, show rapid side-to-side
‘‘bobbing’’ movements, and exhibit a range of vocalizations
indicative of an anxiety response (Figure 4A). Using an explor-
atory factor analysis (EFA; STAR Methods), we have loaded
these behaviors onto a single latent factor representing marmo-
sets’ anxiety toward the human intruder (Table S5). A high factor
(anxiety) score typically reflects high distance, high bobbing, and
increased vocalizations.
In the 2-min baseline period prior to intruder exposure, there
were no differences in behavioral measures between control
and over-activation conditions (Table S6). During intruder expo-
sure, sgACC/25 over-activation significantly enhanced respon-
sivity of marmosets to the human intruder reflected in the
increased anxiety score (Figure 4B; see Table S6 for individual
measures). The effect of sgACC/25 to elevate arousal in
response to an intruder is the opposite finding to that expected
from a general emotional blunting, suggesting instead that
the effects of sgACC/25 over-activation are dependent on the
affective context—however, the extent to which this emotional

 arousal is conditioned (anticipatory) or unconditioned (consum-
matory) cannot be ascertained using the human intruder test.
Further experimentation using an aversive Pavlovian condition-
ing paradigm—equivalent to the appetitive paradigm used
above—would address this.
sgACC/25 Over-Activation Is Associated with Metabolic
Changes in a Circuit Including dmPFC, dACC, and Insula
To determine the brain regions involved in the blunted antici-
patory arousal induced by over-activation of sgACC/25, mar-
mosets (n = 4) underwent 18F-FDG PET imaging to assess
regional metabolic activity. Each subject had two counter-
balanced scans: one following a saline control infusion, and
one following over-activation of sgACC/25 (using DHK) (Fig-
ure 5A). In all cases, animals were injected with
18F-FDG
and then received a Pavlovian conditioning session in the
test apparatus for 30 min before being scanned under anes-
thesia (Figure 5B). For the voxel-wise analysis, a subtraction
image was produced (1) for (over-activation � control) to
determine brain regions showing increased activity following
sgACC/25 over-activation, and (2) for (control � over-activa-
tion) to determine brain regions showing reduced activity. In
parallel, we obtained cardiovascular (n = 3 owing to one
telemetry probe failure) and behavioral (n = 4) readouts during
the PET conditioning session immediately prior to the scan to
confirm whether the manipulations replicated the anticipatory
impairment described above.
Critically, over-activation of sgACC/25 on the day of scanning
replicated the blunting of behavioral and cardiovascular appeti-
tive arousal during CS+ presentation (Figure 5C). The accompa-
nying PET imaging revealed that over-activation of sgACC/25
increased 18F-FDG uptake in sgACC/25 (confirming that the
drug manipulation increases metabolism in sgACC/25) together
with significant increases in uptake in dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex (dmPFC; BA8b, 9), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
(dACC; BA24c), and left ventral insula (Figure 5D). sgACC/25
over-activation also lowered metabolic activity in a brainstem
region encompassing components of the serotonergic raphe
nuclei (rostral group B9), together with a more caudal region
encompassing the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) and the
medullary reticular formation (Figure 5E).
Acute Administration of Ketamine, but Not Citalopram,
Reverses Blunted Anticipatory Arousal Induced by
Over-Activation of sgACC/25
To determine whether the novel antidepressant ketamine could
reverse the blunted anticipatory arousal induced by over-
activation of sgACC/25, marmosets (n = 4) received a single
intramuscular injection of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) followed by
over-activation of sgACC/25 (using DHK) at 4 hr, 1 day, and
7 days after injection while undergoing behavioral testing on
the appetitive Pavlovian conditioning paradigm (Figure 6A).
These time points were chosen to coincide with clinical literature
showing rapid (4 hr time point) and relatively sustained (1 day
and 7 day time points) effects of a single acute administration
of ketamine to improve scores on depression scales (Abdallah
et al., 2015). In three animals, we also determined the endpoint
of ketamine’s action.
In a control experiment, ketamine alone (in the absence of
sgACC/25 over-activation) had no effect on either autonomic
or behavioral components of appetitive arousal compared to
vehicle control (Figure S8A). While over-activation of sgACC/25
4 hr following ketamine injection still resulted in blunted anticipa-
tory arousal, over-activation at 1 day and 7 days post-injection
did not: despite receiving infusions of DHK, animals showed
an MAP rise and head-jerking response selectively to the CS+
(Figure 6C). Therefore, at these time points, ketamine success-
fully reversed the anticipatory deficit induced by over-activation
of sgACC/25. The improvement at 1 day is unlikely to be due to
adaptational effects related to a recent DHK infusion (at 4 hr)
(H) Compared to a control infusion of saline, over-activation of sgACC/25 by reducing glutamate reuptake had no effect on sucrose preference in the first 30 min
of the session (two-tailed paired t test, p = 0.800).
(I) Over-activation of sgACC/25 had no effect on sucrose or water consumption in the first 30 min of the session (solution 3 manipulation, F1,3 = 1.05, p = 0.381;
main effect of manipulation, F1,3 = 1.70, p = 0.283).
(J) Across the 2-hr session, over-activation of sgACC/25 had no effect on cumulative sucrose or water consumption (solution 3 manipulation, F < 1, NS).

(A) In the human intruder test, marmosets are
divided into a quadrant of their home cage and
are confronted with a human intruder who main-
tains eye contact for 2 min. Marmosets display a
range of behaviors in response to the intruder,
including vocalizations (tsik, tse, tsik-egg, tse-egg,
and egg calls), bobbing (rapid side-to-side move-
ments), and locomotion (translational movements).
These behaviors—together with average height,
the time spent at the back of the cage, and
the time spent at the front of the cage—are measured and loaded onto a single EFA-extracted factor representing anxiety (see Table S5 and STAR
Methods).
(B) Anxiety (factor) score following control infusions and over-activation of sgACC/25. Over-activation increased marmosets’ anxiety toward the human
intruder reflected by an increased anxiety score (two-tailed paired t test, p = 0.047).

 because we replicate this effect by showing a comparable blunt-
ing of cardiovascular and behavioral arousal at the 1-day time
point in the subsequent
18F-FDG PET imaging experiment
when there was no infusion at 4 hr (see below). In two of the three
animals where the end point was assessed, ketamine’s action
had abrogated by 3 weeks; in the third animal, by 4 weeks (indi-
cated by the return of the over-activation-induced blunting of
CS+ arousal).
We also determined the sensitivity of the anticipatory impair-
ment to an acute dose of the first-line SSRI antidepressant cit-
alopram (10 mg/kg; Figure 6D). Acute citalopram has been
shown to have rapid and profound effects on marmosets’

Over-Activation
Relevant graphs show mean ± SEM (n = 3 for

cussed are significant at the level of p < 0.005 with
an extent threshold adjusted for search volume of

(A) Following implantation of a subcutaneous port
into the internal jugular vein, marmosets were
trained on a modified version of the appetitive
Pavlovian conditioning paradigm (see B) in prep-
aration for scanning. Saline control and DHK
scans were counterbalanced.
(B) On the day of a scan, animals received an
infusion of DHK or saline immediately followed by
18F-FDG injection through the port. The PET con-
ditioning session (inset) lasted 30 min (to increase
the sensitivity of 18F-FDG uptake to perturbation
by the behavioral paradigm), consisting of two 20 s
periods of the sight of reward without access, and
a final 20 s CS+ period. During training, the CS+
was followed by a 120 s US+. On scan days,
the animals were immediately removed from the
apparatus when the CS+ period terminated, an-
esthetized, and then scanned.
(C) Cardiovascular and behavioral responses were
measured during the CS+ period in the PET con-
ditioning sessions immediately prior to scanning.
Compared to saline scans, over-activation of
sgACC/25 significantly blunted cardiovascular
(ratio of MAP response to saline scans; one-
sample t test to 1.0, p = 0.048) and behavioral
(ratio of head-jerk response to saline scans; one
sample t test to 1.0, p < 0.001) arousal.

together with a region of dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex spanning dmPFC/8b,9 and dACC/24c
(surviving p < 0.001; 2). More caudally, increased
metabolic activity was observed in the left ventral
insula (3).

caudally, brainstem autonomic control centers
including the medullary reticular formation (MRF)
and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST; 2).

in a Time-Dependent Manner, whereas Acute Citalopram
Has No Effect
Relevant graphs show mean ± SEM (n = 4 for ketamine study; n = 5
for citalopram study).
(A) Timeline of ketamine study. Marmosets received a single
intramuscular injection of ketamine (t = 0) followed by over-acti-
vation of sgACC/25 (DHK) 4 hr, 1 day, and 7 days later.
(B) Ketamine had a time-dependent effect to reverse the cardio-
vascular (time point 3 CS, F2,12 = 14.71, p < 0.001) and behavioral
(time point 3 CS, F2,12 = 19.59, p < 0.001) aspects of the antic-
ipatory blunting induced by sgACC/25 over-activation (DHK in-
fusions). Compared to control infusions of saline vehicle (not
shown), sgACC/25 over-activation 4 hr after ketamine adminis-
tration still resulted in significant blunting of cardiovascular
(manipulation 3 CS, F1,3 = 60.46, p = 0.004; effect of manipulation
on CS+, p = 0.003) and behavioral (manipulation 3 CS, F1,3 =
25.59, p = 0.015; effect of manipulation on CS+, p = 0.012) arousal.
Over-activation 1 day following ketamine administration evi-
denced amelioration of the cardiovascular (4 hr versus 1 day: CS+,
p < 0.0001; CS�, p = 0.863) and behavioral (4 hr versus 1 day:
CS+, p < 0.0001; CS�, p = 0.371) impairments compared to 4 hr.
Similarly, over-activation 7 days following ketamine administration
evidenced amelioration of the cardiovascular (4 hr versus 7 days:
CS+, p < 0.001; CS�, p = 0.704) and behavioral (4 hr versus
7 days: CS+, p < 0.0001; CS�, p = 0.767) impairments compared
to 4 hr.
(C) Timeline of acute citalopram study. Marmosets received a
single intramuscular injection of citalopram followed by over-
activation of sgACC/25 (DHK) 30 min later.
(D) Compared to sgACC/25 over-activation alone, acute cit-
alopram had no effect on the cardiovascular (manipulation 3 CS,
F < 1, NS) or behavioral (manipulation 3 CS, F1,4 = 1.19, p = 0.338)
components of the anticipatory blunting. Compared to control
infusions of saline vehicle (not shown), sgACC/25 over-activation
with acute citalopram still resulted in significant blunting of car-
diovascular (manipulation 3 CS, F1,4 = 8.74, p = 0.042; effect of
manipulation on CS+, p = 0.016) and behavioral (manipulation 3
CS, F1,4 = 462, p < 0.0001; effect of manipulation on CS+, p <
0.0001) arousal.

 responsivity to a human intruder (Santangelo et al., 2016). In a
control experiment, an intramuscular injection of citalopram in
the absence of sgACC/25 over-activation had no effect on
either autonomic or behavioral components of appetitive
arousal (Figure S8B). Unlike ketamine, acute citalopram admin-
istration failed to reverse either the autonomic or behavioral
components of the over-activation-induced anticipatory deficit,
suggesting that it is insensitive to acute SSRI treatment
(Figure 6F).
Reversal of Blunted Anticipatory Arousal by Ketamine Is
Associated with Reductions in Metabolic Activity within
dmPFC, dACC, Insula, and sgACC/25
Marmosets (n = 4) received an additional 18F-FDG PET scan
consisting of sgACC/25 over-activation (using DHK) following
an injection of ketamine 1 day earlier, coinciding with a time
point at which the anticipatory cardiovascular and behav-
ioral
blunting
was
reversed.
Subtraction
images
were
computed for (1) (over-activation � [over-activation + keta-
mine]) to determine brain regions showing decreased meta-
bolic activity following administration of ketamine; and (2)
([over-activation + ketamine] � over-activation) to determine
brain regions showing increased activity following administra-
tion of ketamine.
Cardiovascular and behavioral data obtained on the day of
scanning showed that ketamine administration 1 day prior to
over-activation and scanning successfully reversed the DHK-
induced anticipatory cardiovascular and behavioral blunting
(Figure 7A), thereby replicating our previous findings. This was
accompanied by reversal of the metabolic changes within the
dmPFC, dACC, and left ventral insula (corresponding to the re-
gions showing elevated activity following sgACC/25 over-
activation; Figure 7B). No prefrontal or subcortical regions
showed significant increases in activity. To determine whether
ketamine normalized metabolic activity to control levels or
diminished activity below control levels, a (3) third subtraction
image was calculated for (control � [over-activation + keta-
mine]). Results from this comparison show that while activity
in dmPFC/dACC returned to control levels, activity in the left
insula was reduced below activity levels observed in the control
condition (Figure 7C). Therefore, in the context of sgACC/25
over-activation, ketamine normalizes activity within dmPFC/
dACC but deactivates the left insula.
Using the stringent criterion applied in the voxel-based
approach, there was no apparent effect of ketamine on meta-
bolic activity in sgACC/25 itself. However, using an atlas-defined
region of interest (ROI) (Paxinos et al., 2011), we examined the
mean 18F-FDG uptake in sgACC/25 across control, over-activa-
tion, and [over-activation + ketamine] conditions to determine if
the beneficial effect of ketamine depends—at least in part—on
modulation of sgACC/25 activity in response to DHK-induced
reductions in glutamate reuptake. Across all four subjects, we
found that ketamine administration reduced the increased meta-
bolic activity associated with DHK infusions into sgACC/25
(Table S7). These data suggest that the efficacy of ketamine
is related to (likely neuroplastic-mediated) alterations in the
responsivity of sgACC/25 to elevated levels of extracellular
glutamate.
DISCUSSION
Fractionating Blunted Reward Processing and Its
Relevance to Anhedonia
Over-activation of marmoset sgACC/25—achieved using two
different methods (reducing glutamate reuptake and increasing
pre-synaptic glutamate release)—blunted anticipatory cardio-
vascular and behavioral responses to a cue predicting food
reward (CS+) but did not robustly affect cardiovascular or behav-
ioral responses associated with consumption of the reward
(US+). Over-activation by reducing glutamate reuptake through
EAAT2 antagonism (DHK) is of particular relevance to depres-
sion, since EAAT2 shows reduced expression levels in postmor-
tem cerebral tissue samples of individuals who suffered from
depression (Choudary et al., 2005; Miguel-Hidalgo et al., 2010)
and in animal models of depression (Zink et al., 2010).
sgACC/25 over-activation also blunted appetitive motivation
as assessed by reduced breakpoints on a progressive ratio
task. Whether it is possible to separate anticipatory and motiva-
tional impairments remains unclear. Impairments in Pavlovian
reward anticipation impact instrumental performance through
Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, conditioned reinforcement,
and conditioned approach (Dickinson and Balleine, 1994;
Holland, 1977; Mackintosh, 1974). In people with depression,
reduced willingness to work for reward is thought to be driven
by a primary decrease in anticipatory pleasure (Sherdell et al.,
2012). Therefore, motivational impairments may not result from
deficits in goal-directed performance per se; rather, from a
reduced influence of Pavlovian cues signaling reward that would
otherwise support responding.
In contrast, we found no impact of sgACC/25 over-activation
on behavioral or cardiovascular consummatory arousal in the
Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, nor in the sucrose preference
test. This is at odds with the findings of a recent optogenetic
study in rodents, which found that activation of mPFC (IL and
ventral PL) reduced sucrose preference (Ferenczi et al., 2016).
The discrepancy may be related to functional differences
between the putative anatomical homologs IL and sgACC/25,
to differences in anatomical specificity in the region targeted
(in Ferenczi et al., opsin expression was not restricted to IL),
or to differences in the type of activation manipulation (here,
short-term pharmacological over-activation, whereas in Fer-
enczi et al., subthreshold depolarization).
The selective anticipatory and motivational impairments illus-
trate that the transient blunting of reward processing induced
by pharmacological over-activation of sgACC/25 possesses
face validity when compared to the anhedonia observed in peo-
ple with depression, who typically show anticipatory and motiva-
tional deficits (Klein, 1987; McFarland and Klein, 2009; Treadway
and Zald, 2011) rather than consummatory ones (Amsterdam
et al., 1987; Arrondo et al., 2015; Berlin et al., 1998; Dichter
et al., 2010). The contrasting findings across different reward
domains illustrate the importance of careful consideration of
the psychological constructs impaired in psychiatric disorders.
The deficits in appetitive arousal were not due to a general
blunting of emotional arousal since the same manipulation
induced heightened behavioral arousal when marmosets were
faced with an uncertain threat represented by a human intruder.

 This highlights the opposing effects of sgACC/25 over-activity
across emotional domains and implicates this region in adapting
behavior to emotional context. In addition, these data implicate

reduced activity in dmPFC/8b,9, dACC/24c (1)
and left ventral insula (2).
(C) Subtraction images calculated from SUVR
maps for control scans—[over-activation + keta-
mine] scans revealed that activity in the dmPFC/
8b,9 and dACC/24c region was no different
from control scans, indicating that ketamine had
normalized over-activity in these regions to control
levels (1). However, activity in the left insula was
reduced even compared to control conditions,
suggesting that ketamine administration caused
deactivation of the insula (2).
sgACC/25 over-activity in symptoms of
anxiety that commonly manifest in people
with depression (Kessler et al., 2003).
Indeed, several studies have identified
elevated activity in a subgenual region
(including area 25) associated with sus-
tained and unpredictable threat (Alvarez
et al., 2011; Hasler et al., 2007).
Could an effect of sgACC/25 over-
activity on a single construct explain the
contrasting effects on appetitive and
aversive processing? Hamilton and col-
leagues have proposed that increased
functional connectivity between subge-
nual
regions
and
the
default-mode
network seen in people with depression ‘‘represents an integra-
tion of the self-referential processes supported by the DMN
with the affectively laden, behavioral withdrawal processes
316
Neuron 101, 307–320, January 16, 2019
 associated with sg[ACC]’’ linked to rumination and worry (Ham-
ilton et al., 2015). If sgACC/25 over-activity enhances with-
drawal, this may manifest as reduced sensitivity to external
appetitive cues, together with elevated behavioral withdrawal
(increased distance) in the human intruder paradigm. In a previ-
ous study, we reported that sgACC/25 inactivations elevate
parasympathetic tone and reduce anticipatory arousal during a
CS predicting a mildly aversive US (Wallis et al., 2017). Elevated
parasympathetic tone is associated with affective engagement
(rather than withdrawal; Porges, 1992; Thayer and Siegle,
2002), which may facilitate the downregulation of responses to
mildly aversive stimuli (thereby reducing arousal). Thus, the re-
sults of sgACC/25 inactivations in a mildly aversive setting are
also consistent with a role for an ‘‘on-line’’ sgACC/25 in medi-
ating physiological and behavioral withdrawal.
Circuit-wide Changes Associated with Over-Activation
Induced Blunted Reward Processing
PET imaging revealed increased metabolic activity in sgACC/25,
dmPFC/dACC, and left ventral insula following over-activation of
sgACC/25. Elevated connectivity between similar regions has
been observed in depressed populations (Connolly et al., 2013;
Hamilton et al., 2015; Sheline et al., 2010), although these
changes are seldom related to impairments in reward process-
ing associated with anhedonia. Nevertheless, the increase in
dmPFC/dACC activity is consistent with previously reported re-
sults of increased activity in a similar region during reward antic-
ipation in currently depressed or remitted patients compared to
controls (Dichter et al., 2012; Knutson et al., 2008). Similarly, an
over-active insula has been observed during the anticipation of
rewards in groups at high risk of depression (Gotlib et al.,
2010) and following presentation of positively valenced pictures
in people with depression (Mitterschiffthaler et al., 2003).
Reduced activity following sgACC/25 over-activation was
seen in a region encompassing brainstem serotonin (5HT) neu-
rons (B9 group of raphe
´ nuclei). The importance of interplay be-
tween vmPFC and 5HT neurons has been appreciated in terms
of stress controllability (Amat et al., 2005), but more recently a
role for 5HT neuronal signaling during reward anticipation has
been demonstrated (Li et al., 2016). More caudally, we observed
reduced activity in a region including autonomic control centers
such as the NST. Several tract tracing studies have identified
connectivity between primate vmPFC and autonomic effector
regions (Rempel-Clower and Barbas, 1998) through which
sgACC/25 can modulate autonomic function (Rudebeck et al.,
2014; Wallis et al., 2017). While we did not observe reductions
in amygdala and accumbens activity following sgACC/25 over-
activation, both the amygdala (Braesicke et al., 2005; Gallagher
and Holland, 1994) and accumbens (Datla et al., 2002) have been
implicated in various aspects of appetitive Pavlovian condition-
ing. How these structures may interact with sgACC/25 warrants
further investigation.
Ketamine as an Efficacious Treatment for Over-
Activation-Induced Blunted Reward Processing
Ketamine reversed the blunted anticipatory cardiovascular and
behavioral arousal induced by sgACC/25 over-activation at
1 day and 7 days following administration. This effect was repli-
cated at the 1-day time point in the subsequent PET study, in
which ketamine also reduced the DHK-induced increase in
metabolic uptake within sgACC/25. The efficacious action of
ketamine may therefore be dependent on neuroplastic changes
within sgACC/25 that alter the responsivity of the region to
elevated levels of extracellular glutamate. This is consistent
with an extensive body of literature showing that reductions in
activity of a subgenual region are associated with the successful
treatment of depressive symptoms (Drevets et al., 2002;
Mayberg et al., 2000, 2005).
Downstream of sgACC/25, ketamine also reversed the associ-
ated elevations in activity within the dmPFC/dACC and left
ventral insula. Activity in the former two regions was normalized,
whereas activity in the insula was inhibited below control levels.
Normalization of activity in dmPFC/dACC following ketamine
differs from a recent clinical study in which the efficacious
action of ketamine on symptoms of anhedonia was associated
with increased (rather than reduced) metabolism in these
regions (Lally et al., 2015). However, the opposing effects may
be related to ketamine’s actions at different time points:
patients in Lally et al. were imaged 2 hr following ketamine
administration, whereas in the present study marmosets were
imaged 1 day after administration. The rapid versus slow actions
of ketamine are associated with different effects on neural cir-
cuitry, increasing dACC-mPFC functional connectivity acutely
(Grimm et al., 2015), but decreasing it 1 day later (Scheidegger
et al., 2012).
Translational Considerations
This study was designed to address several challenges faced in
the translation of preclinical studies to humans: specifically,
whether cross-species anatomical homology implies analogous
function, issues of symptom heterogeneity, and the methodolo-
gies used to quantify emotion.
First, concerning cross-species comparisons, the putative
anatomical homolog of primate sgACC/25 is rodent IL (Heilbron-
ner et al., 2016; Vogt and Paxinos, 2014), activations of which
have variable effects on appetitive behavior (Gasull-Camo
´ s
et al., 2017; John et al., 2012). However, whether primate/rodent
anatomical homology necessarily implies analogous function
is far from clear—indeed, we have shown opposite effects on
the regulation of negative emotion following inactivations of
marmoset sgACC/25 to those seen in rodent IL studies (Wallis
et al., 2017). Second, concerning symptom heterogeneity, the
impairments in anticipatory and motivational—but not consum-
matory—domains provide neurobiological evidence for the frac-
tionation of anhedonia into separable subtypes. It is imperative
that these subtypes are recognized clinically: people with
depression may present with selective impairments in specific
aspects of reward processing, with distinct underlying neural
mechanisms and hence differing optimal treatment strategies.
Finally, anhedonia is a complex emotional construct consisting
of behavioral and physiological changes that cannot be
adequately measured using single experimental outputs. While
informative, studies examining subjective, autonomic, or behav-
ioral components of emotion in isolation fail to account for the
complex nature of emotion. Future work must delineate the pre-
cise psychological and physiological functions that sgACC/25
Neuron 101, 307–320, January 16, 2019
317
 subserves in the regulation of positive and negative emotion
and isolate the pathophysiological processes that can lead to
chronic elevations in sgACC/25 activity associated with mood
disorders.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
Eleven marmosets (Callithrix jacchus, eight females and three males), bred on-site at the University of Cambridge Marmoset Breeding
Colony, were housed in male/female pairs (males were vasectomized). Seven were experimentally naive. Four marmosets had
varying amounts of aversive Pavlovian discrimination training prior to the study. For a summary of subjects used in the experiments
described in the manuscript, see Tables 1 and S1.
Animals were kept in a 12-hour light-dark cycle (lights on at 7am, lights off at 7pm) in a controlled environment of 22 ± 1�C
temperature and 50 ± 1% humidity. Their cages (280 3 120 3 98cm) contained a nest-box together with a variety of environmental
enrichment aids including suspended ladders, wooden branches, ropes and boxes. Animals had ad libitum access to water.
On weekdays, subjects were fed 20 g of MP.E1 primate diet (Special Diet Services, Essex, UK) and two pieces of carrot. On week-
ends, their diet was supplemented with fruit, rusk, malt loaf, eggs, bread and treats. All procedures were carried out in accordance
with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 as amended in 2012, under project licences 80/2225 and 70/7618. In addition,
the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) provided ethical approval of the project licence and
its amendments, as well as individual studies and procedures via delegation of authorization to the NACWO for individual study plans.
METHOD DETAILS
Behavioral testing apparatus and paradigms
Carry-box
Animals were trained to enter a transparent Perspex carry-box (240 3 230 3 200mm) in which they were transported to the behavioral
testing apparatus. The Perspex carry-box was placed inside the test chamber, and the marmoset remained inside this box during
testing. The carry-box had two circular windows (diameter 30mm) on opposite sides.

 Discriminative conditioning
Behavioral testing took place within a sound-attenuated testing chamber in a dark room. The chamber was lit by an 3W bulb (house-
light), located in the middle of the ceiling. Two electrically controlled food-box units were attached to the left and right walls of the
internal frame of the apparatus. A telemetry receiver, used to record cardiovascular data, was concealed beneath the floor of the
apparatus. Each food-box was cylindrical (internal diameter 52mm and length 51mm). When the carry-box was fitted into the internal
frame of the apparatus, the positions of the carry-box windows were aligned with the food-boxes. The inside of each food-box could
be illuminated by a 28V, 0.04W encased light bulb. Access to both food-boxes was restricted by black and opaque Perspex doors,
which could be opened remotely to allow access. The chamber contained computer-controlled speakers through which auditory
stimuli could be played, and three cameras used to record the animal during testing using video software (CyberLink, Power Director,
CyberLink Corp.). The video display was shown on a monitor outside of the testing apparatus meaning the animal could be observed
by the experimenter during testing. The apparatus was controlled by the Whisker control system (Cardinal and Aitken, 2010) and
in-house software.
Prior to conditioning, all marmosets were habituated to the sight and sound of the food-box doors opening and closing. During
these sessions, high incentive food (several pieces of marshmallow) was presented in either the left or right food-box and the
door of the food-box was opened after 120 s. When the animal stopped showing a startle response (i.e., rearing and jumping) to
the opening of the door and started consuming marshmallow within 40 s of its opening, they were advanced to conditioning sessions.
The mean number of habituation sessions was 10 ± 1 (mean ± SEM).
Marmosets were then exposed to two novel auditory cues and the cardiovascular arousal response (MAP) was measured. The cue
that produced the smallest arousal response became the CS+ and the cue that produced the largest arousal response became the
CS-. The animals were then trained on an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning paradigm: the CS+ was associated with food reward
(US+; marshmallow, net weight approximately 5.8-6.2g) and the CS- was associated with no reward (US-). Marshmallows were
chosen as the food reward since marmosets invariably favor them over other types of food (Caldwell et al., 2009). A trial consisted
of a 20 s CS period during which one of the cues was played. At the end of this period, one of the food-boxes would open, accom-
panied by the house-light offset, the onset of the food-box light and presentation of either an empty box (US-) or the high-incentive
food reward (US+). The auditory CS continued to be played for the entire 120 s duration of the US period. In multiple-trial sessions,
the offset of the US period was indicated by termination of the CS, closure of the black opaque food-box door and onset of the
house-light. If the trial was the last in a session, all lights were turned off at the end of the US period indicating session termination.
The intervals between trials were pseudorandomly varied between 70-110 s. There were either one or two trials in each session
with no more than one CS+/US+ trial; if present, the CS+/US+ trial was always the final trial. Thus, a session could consist of a single
CS-/US- or CS+/US+ trial, two CS-/US- trials or one CS-/US- trial and one CS+/US+ trial. Infusions were always conducted on
sessions containing both CS-/US- and CS+/US+ trial types which lasted 460 s in total. Behavioral and cardiovascular measurements
were analyzed both during the CS and US periods as well as the 20 s baseline (BL) periods immediately prior to the onset of the CS.
Progressive ratio
Behavioral testing took place within a sound-attenuated chamber in a dark room, identical to the chamber described in Discriminative
conditioning but without food-box units. When the carry-box was fitted into the internal frame of the apparatus and the door removed,
the marmosets had access to a touchscreen (Campden Instruments, Loughborough, UK). The stimulus presented on the screen was
a white circle (diameter of 75mm) displayed to the left or right of the central spout via the Whisker control system. When appropriate, a
reward of cooled banana milkshake (Nestle
´ ) was delivered through a centrally placed spout for 5 s. A brief tone (0.5 s, 80dB) played
from speakers at the back of the chamber signaled reward availability.
During training, marmosets were first familiarized with the delivery of banana milkshake from a spout in the testing apparatus.
They were then trained to respond to stimuli presented on a touchscreen for reward. Once marmosets were reliably and accurately
making R 30 responses in 10 min to a green square presented to the left or right of the licker (see Roberts et al., 1988), the stimulus
was changed to a white circle presented at a fixed location (the animal’s preferred side). Fixed ratio (FR) response schedules were
then introduced to familiarize marmosets with the requirement to make repeated responses for reward. Marmosets progressed from
FR1 / FR2 / FR3 / FR5 / FR7 response schedules when their performance at each level was stable. After FR7, marmosets were
trained on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement taken from (Pryce et al., 2004). In this schedule, the response increment
from trial n to n+1 starts at +1 and doubles every eight trials until a maximum increment of +8 (trials 1-8: responses 1-8; trials
9-16: responses 10-24 etc.). After two minutes of inactivity (or a session length of 30 min), marmosets ‘timed-out’ and were removed
from the apparatus. The total number of responses marmosets made prior to timing-out was considered the breakpoint.
Sucrose preference test
The sucrose preference test was carried out in animals’ home cages.
During a testing session, animals were divided into the top left or top right quadrant of the cage and the nest-box was removed.
Marmosets were presented with two bottles identical in appearance: one water bottle and one containing sucrose (25 g in 250 g
water). Each session lasted two hours, and from session to session the left-right position of the two bottles was varied. Every
30 min, an experimenter briefly removed each bottle and weighed it, before replacing it in the same position. The amount of sucrose
consumed and sucrose preference (sucrose/[sucrose+water]) was measured over the session. Once marmosets achieved stable
sucrose preference > 90% over two sessions, experimental manipulations took place.

 Human intruder test
Human intruder tests were carried out in animals’ home cages.
During testing sessions, animals were divided in the top right quadrant of the cage and the nest-box was removed. After 8 min of
habituation to separation, an unfamiliar intruder entered the room. The intruder wore different latex masks to disguise their face. The
intruder stood 40cm from the front of the cage and stared at the marmoset for 2 min. Behavior was recorded using a video camera
and microphone. Several measures were scored: time spent at the front (TSAF) of the cage, time spent at the back (TSAB) of the cage,
average height, bobbing (rapid side-to-side body movements), vocalizations (egg calls, tsik call, tsik-egg calls, and tse-egg calls) and
locomotion.
PET conditioning
Marmosets undergoing 18F-FDG PET scanning were trained on a modified version of the Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. The
length of the session was increased from 460 s to 1800s to increase the sensitivity of 18F-FDG uptake to perturbation by the behav-
ioral paradigm. Marmosets were habituated to the increased length of the session by gradually increasing the time spent in the
testing apparatus over approximately 12 habituation sessions (12 ± 1.4, mean ± SEM). During a standard PET conditioning session,
the opaque door of the rewarded food-box opened at 600 s and 1200s for 20 s revealing the high-incentive food reward, after which
it closed again. During this period, marmosets could see the reward without being able to access it – the sight of reward is also
known to act as an appetitive CS (Braesicke et al., 2005). At 1660s, the CS+ auditory cue was played for 20 s after which the rewarded
food-box opened for 120 s as before (US+). The CS+ continued to be played for the entire 120 s of the US+ period. During the
habituation and PET conditioning sessions, marmosets underwent the entire PET procedure. This included being taken to the rooms
used for intracranial infusions, intramuscular and 18F-FDG injections. Marmosets were also given mock injections before testing to
minimize the effects of handling on the day of the scan. All animals received this on every testing session from at least 4 days before
the first scan until the final scan.
Marmosets received at least 5 of these training sessions before undergoing the first PET scan. Owing to the requirement for low
blood glucose concentration and anesthesia during PET scanning, marmosets were unable to consume food reward on the day of the
scan. Therefore, in sessions conducted on the day of scanning, animals were removed from the apparatus at 1680s (immediately
after experiencing the CS+) and the session was terminated without a US+.
Surgical procedures
Eleven animals underwent two aseptic surgical procedures: one to implant intracerebral cannulae targeting either sgACC/25 alone or
both sgACC/25 and pgACC/32, and one to implant a telemetric blood pressure (BP) monitor into the descending aorta. Four of these
animals underwent a third procedure to implant a vascular access port for administration of 18F-FDG. Animals had 7-10 days of
recovery following all surgical procedures.
Cannulation surgery
Marmosets were pre-medicated with ketamine hydrochloride (Ketavet; 0.10ml of a 100mg solution, i.m.; Henry Schein, Melville, NY)
before being given a long lasting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic (Carprieve; 0.03ml of 50mg/mL carprofen, s.c.; Pfizer,
Kent, UK). They were intubated and maintained on 2.0%–2.5% isoflurane in 0.3L/min O2 and placed into a stereotaxic frame modified
for the marmoset (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA). HR, SpO2, breathing rate and CO2 saturation were all monitored by pulse-oximetry and
capnography (Microcap Handheld Capnograph, Oridion Capnography, MA, USA) and core body temperature was monitored by a
rectal thermometer (TES-1319 K-type digital thermometer, TES Electrical Electronic Corp, Taipei, Taiwan). Cannulae (Plastics
One, Roanoke, VA) were implanted into sgACC/25 (26-gauge double cannulae, 7.0mm long, 1.0 to 1.4mm apart, anteroposterior
[AP] +14, lateromedial [LM] ± 0.5) and pgACC/32 (26-gauge double cannulae, 2.0 to 3.5mm long, 1.0 to 1.2mm apart, AP +17,
LM ± 0.5 at 30� AP angle) adjusted in situ according to cortical depth (Roberts et al., 2007). Postoperatively, animals received the
analgesic meloxicam (0.1ml of a 1.5mg/mL oral suspension; Boehringer Ingelheim) for 3 days. Cannulae were cleaned every
week (and caps and cannula blockers changed) to ensure the cannulae remained patent and the site free from infection.
Telemetry probe surgery
Animals were anaesthetized as before. The descending aorta was visualized within the abdominal cavity and the probe catheter of
a telemetric BP transmitter (Data Sciences International [DSI], St. Paul, MN, USA) was implanted into the aorta just above the
aortic bifurcation as described previously (Braesicke et al., 2005). All monkeys received meloxicam as before in addition to
prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (Synulox; 50mg/mL solution, Pfizer, Kent, UK) one day before and for
6 days after telemetry surgery.
Port implant surgery
A vascular access port (Solomon Scientific, Skokie, IL, USA) was implanted into the animal to allow swift subcutaneous injection of
18F-FDG. Animals were anaesthetized as before and placed on to the surgical table in a prone position. An incision was made
below the shoulder-blades perpendicular to the axis of the spine where the port would be placed, and a second incision was
made on the neck to expose the jugular vein. A catheter attached to the port was threaded under the skin from the back toward
the neck. The port was placed in a skin pocket created by the first incision. A small incision was made in the jugular vein to insert
the open end of the catheter in the direction of the heart. The catheter was glued to the vein with Vetbond (M3 Animal Care Products,
MN, USA) and the incisions on the back and neck were sutured. All animals received meloxicam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
perioperatively as before.

 Drug treatments
For all sterile drug treatments, the marmoset was held gently in a researcher’s hand.
Central infusions
For central infusions, the caps and cannula blockers were removed from the guide, and the site was cleaned with 70% alcohol.
A sterile injector (Plastics One) connected to a 2ml gas tight syringe in a syringe pump was inserted into the guide cannula. Bilateral
infusions were carried out over 2 min at a rate dependent on the drug being infused. Following the infusion, the injector was left in
place for a further minute to allow the drug to diffuse before injector removal. Sterile cannula blockers and caps were replaced,
and the marmoset was returned to its cage for a pre-treatment time dependent on the drug being infused.
Intramuscular injections
For intramuscular injections, the injection site (located on the lateral aspect of the thigh) was cleaned with alcohol and injected with a
drug or an equal volume of saline vehicle before testing.
See Table S8 for a summary of doses and timings for centrally and peripherally administered compounds in this study. Of these,
DHK is the drug used most extensively in this study. Its pre-treatment time of 10 min was chosen based on work in rodents showing
maximal effects within 15 min of infusion, which return to control levels within 30-45 min (John et al., 2012).
PET imaging
Each animal selected to undergo PET scanning received three 18F-FDG PET scans with a microPET Focus-220 scanner
(Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN) with the first scan approximately 2 weeks after port implant surgery and an interval
between scans of approximately 2 weeks. On the day of a scan, animals did not receive breakfast to lower blood glucose con-
centration and hence increase the transport of 18F-FDG into brain tissue, thereby increasing the cerebral 18F-FDG signal-to-
noise ratio. The animal received an infusion of either saline vehicle or DHK approximately 10 min prior to a bolus injection of
approximately 70MBq of 18F-FDG administered subcutaneously via the vascular access port. They were then taken to the
test apparatus and after 30 min of the behavioral paradigm described previously, the animal was anaesthetized as described
above. The animal was then placed on a heat-pad on the scanner bed and attached to monitoring equipment. HR, SpO2 and
breathing rate were monitored continuously. The bed of the scanner was then positioned to locate the brain in the center of the
PET scanner field-of-view, where both sensitivity and resolution are optimal. For consistency, PET data acquisition started
70 min after the
18F-FDG injection and lasted for 45 min. The energy and coincidence timing windows used were
350-650keV and 6 ns, respectively.
The list mode PET data were histogrammed into 9 3 5 min 4D sinograms and then reconstructed using Fourier rebinning (FORE,
Defrise et al., 1997) followed by the 2D ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm installed on the scanner
(6 iterations, 16 subsets). As post-injection transmission scanning was not feasible, attenuation correction used a mean non-
attenuation corrected 18F-FDG image to determine a body outline, within which a uniform attenuation coefficient (0.096cm-1) was
ascribed. This was combined with a standard attenuation map of the carbon fiber bed determined from transmission scanning.
The combined attenuation map was forward projected using software installed on the scanner to produce an attenuation correction
factor sinogram, and image reconstruction was repeated with attenuation correction applied. Corrections were also applied for
random coincidences, dead-time, normalization, scatter, sensitivity and decay.
Post-mortem histological processing
Assessment of cannula placement
Animals were pre-medicated with ketamine hydrochloride before being euthanized with pentobarbital sodium (Dolethal; 1ml of a
200mg/mL solution, i.e.; Merial Animal Health, Essex, UK). Animals were then perfused transcardially with 300ml 0.1M PBS, followed
by 300ml of 4% paraformaldehyde fixative solution over approximately 15 min. The brain was removed and left in the 4% parafor-
maldehyde fixative solution overnight before being transferred to 0.01M PBS-azide solution for at least 48 hours. Finally, the brains
were transferred to 30% sucrose solution for at least 48 hours for cryoprotection. Brains were then sectioned on a freezing microtome
(coronal sections; 40-60mm), mounted on slides and stained with cresyl-violet. The sections were viewed under a Leitz DMRD
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The cannula locations for each animal were schematized onto drawings
of standard marmoset brain coronal sections together with estimated infusion spread (Figure S1A) which was estimated at
0.5-1.0mm (based on Allen et al., 2008).
c-fos expression
One hour prior to perfusion, an animal was infused with DHK into left sgACC/25 and saline vehicle contralaterally. The animal was
euthanized, perfused and brains sectioned as above before the tissue was immunohistochemically processed for c-fos expression.
Sections were washed for 3 3 10 min in 0.01M PBS and incubated for 10 min in 10% methanol/10% H2O2 v/v solution to inhibit
endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were then washed and blocked for two hours with 3% normal goat serum before being
incubated overnight with the primary antibody (1:2000 Rabbit polyclonal to c-fos; ab190289, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The following
day, sections were washed and incubated for two hours with the secondary antibody (1:500 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L [Biotin];
ab6720, Abcam). After secondary incubation, sections were incubated in an avidin/biotin complex solution for 30 min (RTU ABC re-
agent, Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK) and then reacted in 3,30 diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromagen for 15 s (ImmPact DAB SK-4105,
Vector Labs). Following DAB reaction, sections were transferred to ice-cold PBS and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Slides were

 dehydrated, coverslipped using DPX mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich, MI, US) and visualized using a Leitz DMRD microscope. See
Figure S1B for c-fos expression.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data collection and preliminary analysis
Discriminative conditioning: telemetry data collection and preliminary analysis
BP data were continuously transmitted by the implanted probe to a receiver for offline analysis using Spike2 (Version 8.11a, CED) as
described previously (Braesicke et al., 2005). Any outliers and recording failures in the data were removed (BP values above
200mmHg or below 0mmHg, or other abnormal spikes). Data collection was reliable overall, but data gaps of less than 0.4 s were
replaced by cubic spline interpolation and gaps of more than 0.4 s were treated as missing values. Systolic (s)BP events were ex-
tracted as local maxima from each cardiac cycle, and diastolic (d)BP events extracted as local minima. The HR was calculated using
the time interval between adjacent sBP events. MAP was calculated from adjacent systolic and diastolic values using the formula
MAP = dBP + 1=3(sBP-dBP). A mean MAP and HR value was calculated over the 20 s anticipatory CS period. The 20 s immediately
preceding each CS period served as its baseline for comparison purposes: the CS-directed autonomic measures were calculated as
the difference between the mean value for CS period and the mean value for the baseline period. The principal measure for the
consummatory period was the US-directed MAP response, calculated as the difference in MAP response between the US period
(calculated as a mean MAP response after the animals began consuming the reward) and 20 s CS period.
Discriminative conditioning: behavioral data collection and preliminary analysis
Behavior during the discrimination was recorded and subsequently scored by an experimenter and a blinded research assistant
(correlation between scorers: R2 = 0.59, considered ‘excellent’ (Cicchetti and Sparrow, 1981). Behaviors were scored separately
during the anticipatory period and consummatory period. The anticipatory CS period behaviors scored were CS-directed orienting
behaviors known as ‘head-jerks’ (Reekie et al., 2008). The number of anticipatory head-jerks was compared to the value in the 20 s
preceding baseline period to give a CS-directed score. Baseline and CS period locomotion was also scored to determine if sgACC/25
over-activation had any effect on locomotion levels, measured as the total time (s) an animal spent in motion (movement of all
four limbs plus movement about the body axis; see Table S3). The consummatory behavior scored was the amount of reward
consumed across the 120 s period (grams).
Pre-processing of PET data
MR imaging of the animals was not possible due to the cannulae implanted in the brain, preventing the use of MR-based spatial
normalization. Instead, first, the mean FDG image of each scan was manually, rigidly registered to an FDG brain template produced
from another FDG study in the colony that included MR imaging. The FDG brain template was constructed by averaging n = 21 FDG
images transformed to template space using registration transformations obtained by warping MR images (co-registered to the
FDG images) to an MR template. Second, for each subject, the three FDG scans rigidly registered to the FDG template were
averaged, the resultant image was non-rigidly registered (affine and non-linear) to the FDG template using ANTS (Avants et al.,
2008), and this transformation was applied to each of the three rigidly registered FDG scans. Use of a single spatial normalization
transformation per subject rather than per FDG scan was adopted after it was found – using the n = 21 FDG scans with MR – that
this approach provided ROI PET values with a higher correlation to those obtained using MR-based spatial normalization
(R2 = 0.89 versus R2 = 0.87).
For each scan, an SUVR map was created for voxel-wise analysis by dividing the mean PET image by a cerebellum ROI value.
Normalization by the cerebellum signal was designed to minimize the confounding influence of inter-scan differences in tracer
availability, plasma glucose concentration, the effect of anesthesia on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and basal cerebral
glucose metabolism.
An sgACC/25 ROI was manually defined in template space on the MR template according to the Paxinos et al. marmoset atlas
(Paxinos et al., 2011), averaged across hemispheres, manually edited and mirrored about the mid-line to provide symmetric left
and right ROIs. The mean SUVR value in each ROI was determined by overlaying the ROIs onto the SUVR map.
Statistical analysis
Where appropriate, data were inputted into GraphPad Prism v8.00.178 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) for statistical
analysis. Significance was set at a = 0.05 in all cases. Raw data are available from the authors.
Discriminative conditioning: illustrating discrimination
To illustrate successful discrimination between CS+ and CS-, a two-tailed paired t test was conducted on CS-directed cardiovas-
cular and behavioral measurements in sessions prior to drug manipulations. Cardiovascular discrimination between US+ and
US- was assessed in the same way.
Discriminative conditioning: drug manipulations
CS measurements taken during drug manipulation sessions were compared to infusions of saline vehicle using a two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA of the form C2 3 M2 where C is a within-subject factor with two levels (CS type: CS+, CS-) and M is a within-
subject factor with two levels (manipulation type: saline, drug). Significant interactions were subjected to Sidak’s multiple compar-
isons test applied to vehicle versus drug data for CS+ and CS- (to ascertain whether there were changes in responses to the
Neuron 101, 307–320.e1–e6, January 16, 2019
e5
 CS+ selectively, CS- selectively or both). Absolute MAP values during the baseline and CS+ periods were also compared using a
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA of the form P2 3 M2 where P is a within-subject factor with two levels (phase: baseline,
CS+) and M is a within-subject factor with two levels (manipulation type: saline, drug). US+ measurements taken during drug manip-
ulations were compared to infusions of saline vehicle using a two-tailed paired t test.
To determine if DHK and CGP/LY manipulations changed absolute locomotion levels, baseline locomotion and CS locomotion
were compared across saline and drug conditions using two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs. To determine if changes in
locomotion were correlated with changes in MAP, CS-directed locomotion changes were correlated with CS-directed MAP
changes across saline, DHK and CGP/LY infusion sessions into sgACC/25. R2 values were calculated to ascertain the strength of
correlation between MAP change and locomotion change across infusion types.
Discriminative conditioning: ketamine/citalopram study
For the ketamine study, cardiovascular and behavioral measurements were subjected to a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA
of the form C2 3 T3 where C is a within-subject factor with two levels (CS type) and T represents time point with three levels (4 hours,
1 day, 7 days). Significant interactions were subjected to Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, applied to vehicle versus drug data
across CS type. Ketamine control data were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA of the form C2 3 M2 as described
above. Cardiovascular and behavioral data from citalopram control and citalopram manipulation studies were analyzed using
two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs of the form C2 3 M2 as described above.
Progressive ratio
For control and drug sessions, a percentage change in the number of responses at breakpoint was calculated compared to the
previous day. A two-tailed paired t test was conducted on percentage change values for control versus drug sessions.
Sucrose preference test: first 30-min
A two-tailed paired t test was conducted to compare preference values between control and drug conditions over the first 30-min
window. Sucrose and water consumption over the first 30-min window were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA of the form M2 3 S2 where M is a within-subject factor with two levels (manipulation type) and S is a within-subject factor
with two levels (solution type).
Sucrose preference test: two-hour session
To compare the effect of drug manipulations on cumulative consumption of sucrose versus cumulative consumption of water
across the entire two-hour testing session, data were subjected to a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA of the form M2 3 S2
3 T4 (M: within-subject factor of two levels [manipulation type]; S: within-subject factor of two levels [solution type]; T: within-subject
factor of four levels [time window]). In the case of naloxone manipulations, planned comparisons were made between naloxone and
control manipulations at each time point for water and sucrose solutions separately using Fisher’s LSD test.
Human intruder test
An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on human intruder test scores obtained as part of a screening procedure on
171 marmosets from the University of Cambridge Marmoset Breeding Colony, to predict the extent to which the different behaviors
in the test are driven by an underlying latent variable. The EFA included: TSAF, TSAB, average height, proportion of time spent in
locomotion, number of bobs, egg calls, tsik call, tsik-egg calls, and tse-egg calls. In total, nine factors were identified. Based on
the point of inflection on a scree plot, a single factor was extracted accounting for 39.7% of the total variance in behavior. The loading
of individual behaviors onto this factor is shown in Table S5; the pattern of loading suggests this factor represents the marmosets’
anxiety toward the human intruder. For example, a higher factor (anxiety) score is associated with increased distance from the human
intruder and lower locomotion, together with increased vigilance in the form of head bobbing and tse-egg vocalizations.
PET scanning
SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Institute for Neurology, UCL, UK) was used for voxel-wise analysis. A general linear model was configured
with covariates for subject and condition (saline control versus over-activation versus [over-activation + ketamine]) and changes
in activity were tested with Student’s t test at each voxel. Prior to estimating the model, images were smoothed with a filter size
of 1mm3 using a locally adapted Gaussian kernel to include only those voxels inside a brain mask. In mitigation against type I errors
expected due to multiple comparisons, an adjusted p value of p < 0.005 was applied with an extent threshold adjusted for search
volume of 26 voxels.
For analysis of SUVR values in the sgACC/25 ROI across control, over-activation and [over-activation + ketamine] conditions, data
were subjected to a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA of the form M3 3 H2 where M is a within-subject factor with two levels
(manipulation type) and H is a within-subject factor with two levels (hemisphere). Planned comparisons were made between control
versus over-activation and over-activation versus [over-activation + ketamine] values using Fisher’s LSD test.
PET conditioning
A ratio was calculated comparing CS-directed cardiovascular and behavioral measures during the CS+ for control scans versus
over-activation scans and control scans versus [over-activation + ketamine] scans. A one sample t test was performed to determine
whether the ratio significantly different from a hypothetical value of 1.0 (no difference).
