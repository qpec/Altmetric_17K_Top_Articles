abstract
Skin-to-skin care (SSC) and rooming-in have become common practice in the 
newborn period for healthy newborns with the implementation of maternity 
care practices that support breastfeeding as delineated in the World Health 
Organization’s “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding.” SSC and rooming-in 
are supported by evidence that indicates that the implementation of these 
practices increases overall and exclusive breastfeeding, safer and healthier 
transitions, and improved maternal-infant bonding. In some cases, however, 
the practice of SSC and rooming-in may pose safety concerns, particularly 
with regard to sleep. There have been several recent case reports and case 
series of severe and sudden unexpected postnatal collapse in the neonatal 
period among otherwise healthy newborns and near fatal or fatal events 
related to sleep, suffocation, and falls from adult hospital beds. Although 
these are largely case reports, there are potential dangers of unobserved 
SSC immediately after birth and throughout the postpartum hospital period 
as well as with unobserved rooming-in for at-risk situations. Moreover, 
behaviors that are modeled in the hospital after birth, such as sleep 
position, are likely to infl
 uence sleeping practices after discharge. Hospitals 
and birthing centers have found it diffi
 cult to develop policies that will 
allow SSC and rooming-in to continue in a safe manner. This clinical report 
is intended for birthing centers and delivery hospitals caring for healthy 
newborns to assist in the establishment of appropriate SSC and safe sleep 
policies.

INTRODUCTION
Defi
 nition of Skin-to-Skin Care and Rooming-In
Skin-to-skin care (SSC) is defined as the practice of placing infants in 
direct contact with their mothers or other caregivers with the ventral 
skin of the infant facing and touching the ventral skin of the mother/

caregiver (chest-to-chest). The infant 
is typically naked or dressed only in 
a diaper to maximize the surface-to-
surface contact between mother/
caregiver and the infant, and the 
dyad is covered with prewarmed 
blankets, leaving the infant’s head 
exposed. SSC is recommended for all 
mothers and newborns, regardless 
of feeding or delivery method, 
immediately after birth (as soon 
as the mother is medically stable, 
awake, and able to respond to her 
newborn) and to continue for at 
least 1 hour, as defined by the World 
Health Organization’s (WHO’s) “Ten 
Steps to Successful Breastfeeding.” 
1, 
 
2 
SSC is also a term used to describe 
continued holding of the infant in 
the manner described above and 
beyond the immediate delivery 
period and lasting throughout 
infancy, whenever the mother/
caregiver and infant have the 
opportunity. For mothers planning 
to breastfeed, SSC immediately 
after delivery and continued 
throughout the postpartum 
period also involves encouraging 
mothers to recognize when their 
infants are ready to breastfeed and 
providing help if needed. 
2 Additional 
recommendations by the WHO, as 
part of the Baby-Friendly Hospital 
Initiative and endorsed by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) in 2009, include the following 
specifications for the period of time 
immediately after delivery: routine 
procedures such as assessments and 
Apgar scores are conducted while 
SSC is underway, and procedures that 
may be painful or require separation 
should be delayed until after the 
first hour; if breastfeeding, these 
procedures should occur after the 
first breastfeeding is completed. 
3 
The AAP further delineates that 
the administration of vitamin K 
and ophthalmic prophylaxis can 
be delayed for at least 1 hour and 
up to 4 hours after delivery. The 
Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative 
encourages continued SSC 
throughout the hospital stay while 
rooming-in.4
Unless there is a medical reason for 
separation, such as resuscitation, SSC 
may be provided for all newborns. 
In the case of cesarean deliveries, 
SSC may also be provided when the 
mother is awake and able to respond 
to her infant. In some settings, SSC 
may be initiated in the operating 
room following cesarean deliveries, 
while in other settings SSC may begin 
in the recovery room. SSC for healthy 
newborns shall be distinguished 
from “kangaroo care” in this clinical 
report, because the latter applies 
to preterm newborns or infants 
cared for in the NICU. 
5 This report 
is intended for mothers and infants 
who are well, are being cared for in 
the routine postpartum or mother-
infant setting, and have not required 
resuscitation. Although sick or 
preterm newborns may benefit from 
SSC, this review is intended only for 
healthy term newborns. Late preterm 
infants (defined as a gestational age 
of 34–37 weeks) may also benefit 
from early SSC but are at increased 
risk of a number of early neonatal 
morbidities. 
6
Rooming-in is defined as allowing 
mothers and infants to remain 
together 24 hours per day while in 
the delivery hospital. This procedure 
is recommended for all mothers and 
their healthy newborns, regardless 
of feeding or delivery method, and 
in some cases applies to older late 
preterm (>35 weeks’ gestation) or 
early term (37–39 weeks’ gestation) 
newborns who are otherwise 
healthy and receiving routine care, 
who represent up to 70% of this 
population. 
7 Mothers are expected to 
be more involved with routine care, 
such as feeding, holding, and bathing. 
Newborns may remain with their 
mothers unless there is a medical 
reason for separation for either the 
mother or the infant. Procedures 
that can be performed at the bedside 
can be performed while the infant is 
preferably being held skin-to-skin or 
at least in the room with the mother. 
Being held skin-to-skin by the mother 
has been shown to decrease pain 
in newborns undergoing painful 
procedures such as blood draws. 
8, 
 
9 
Mothers may nap, shower, or leave 
the room with the expectation that 
the mother-infant staff members 
monitor the newborn at routine 
intervals. Mothers are encouraged to 
use call bells for assistance with their 
own care or that of their newborns.
Evidence for SSC and Rooming-In
SSC has been researched extensively 
as a method to provide improved 
physiologic stability for newborns 
and potential benefits for mothers. 
SSC immediately after birth stabilizes 
the newborn body temperature and 
can help prevent hypothermia. 
10, 
 
11 
SSC also helps stabilize blood glucose 
concentrations, decreases crying, 
and provides cardiorespiratory 
stability, especially in late preterm 
newborns. 
12 SSC has been shown 
in numerous studies as a method 
to decrease pain in newborns being 
held by mothers 
13 
– 
16 and fathers. 
17 In 
preterm infants, SSC has been shown 
to result in improved autonomic and 
neurobehavioral maturation and 
gastrointestinal adaptation, more 
restful sleep patterns, less crying, 
and better growth. 
18 
– 
21 Although 
not specifically studied in full-term 
infants, it is likely that these infants 
also benefit in similar ways.
SSC also benefits mothers. 
Immediately after birth, SSC 
decreases maternal stress and 
improves paternal perception 
of stress in their relationship. 
22 
A recent study suggested that 
SSC and breastfeeding within 30 
minutes of birth reduce postpartum 
hemorrhage. 
23 Experimental 
models indicate that mother-infant 
separation causes significant 
stress, and the consequences of 
this stress on the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis persist.

the relationship between SSC and

maternal depression and stress, 
both depression scores and salivary 
cortisol concentrations were 
lower over the first month among 
postpartum mothers providing SSC 
compared with mothers who were 
provided no guidance about SSC. 
22 
For breastfeeding mother-infant 
dyads, SSC enhances the opportunity 
for an early first breastfeeding, 
which, in turn, leads to more 
readiness to breastfeed, an organized 
breastfeeding suckling pattern, 
and more success in exclusive and 
overall breastfeeding, 
12, 
 
25, 
 
26 even 
after cesarean deliveries. 
27 Further 
evidence shows a benefit for mothers 
after cesarean deliveries who 
practice SSC as soon as the mother 
is alert and responsive in increased 
breastfeeding initiation, decreased 
time to the first breastfeeding, 
reduced formula supplementation, 
and increased bonding and maternal 
satisfaction. 
28 Increasing rates 
of breastfeeding ultimately have 
short- and long-term health benefits, 
such as decreased risk of infections, 
obesity, cancer, and sudden infant 
death syndrome.3
The evidence for rooming-in also 
extends beyond infant feeding 
practices and is consistent with 
contemporary models of family-
centered care. 
29 Rooming-in and 
the maternity care practices aligned 
with keeping mothers and newborns 
together in a hospital setting were 
defined as best practice but not fully 
implemented in the post–World War 
II era, largely because of nursing 
culture and the presumption 
that newborns were safer in a 
sterile nursery environment. 
30 
Rooming-in leads to improved 
patient satisfaction. 
31, 
 
32 Integrated 
mother-infant care leads to optimal 
outcomes for healthy mothers and 
infants, including those with neonatal 
abstinence syndrome.33 Rooming-in 
also provides more security, may 
avoid newborn abductions or 
switches, leads to decreased infant 
abandonment, 
 
34 and provides more 
opportunity for supervised maternal-
newborn interactions. 
35 Hospital staff 
members caring for mother-infant 
dyads have more opportunities 
to empower mothers to care for 
their infants than when infant care 
is conducted without the mother 
and in a separate nursery. For the 
breastfeeding mother-infant dyad, 
rooming-in may help to support cue-
based feeding, leading to increased 
frequency of breastfeeding, especially 
in the first few days 
36; decreased 
hyperbilirubinemia; and increased 
likelihood of continued breastfeeding 
up to 6 months. 
37
SSC and rooming-in are 2 of the 
important steps in the WHO’s “Ten 
Steps to Successful Breastfeeding” 
and serve as the basic tenets for a 
baby-friendly–designated delivery 
hospital. 
1, 
 
38, 
 
39 The Ten Steps 
include practices that also improve 
patient safety and outcomes by 
supporting a more physiologic 
transition immediately after delivery; 
maintaining close contact between 
the mother and her newborn, which 
decreases the risk of infection and 
sepsis; increasing the opportunity 
for the development of a protective 
immunologic environment; 
decreasing stress responses by the 
mother and her infant; and enhancing 
sleep patterns in the mother. 
40– 
42
SAFETY CONCERNS REGARDING 
IMMEDIATE SSC
Rarely are there contraindications 
to providing SSC; however, there 
are potential safety concerns to 
address. A newborn requiring 
positive-pressure resuscitation 
should be continuously monitored, 
and SSC should be postponed 
until the infant is stabilized. 
43 
Furthermore, certain conditions, such 
as low Apgar scores (less than 7 at 
5 minutes) or medical complications 
from birth, may require careful 
observation and monitoring of the 
newborn during SSC and in some 
cases may prevent SSC. 
11 Other 
safety concerns are attributable to 
the lack of standardization in the 
approach, discontinuous observation 
of the mother-infant dyad (with 
lapses exceeding 10 to 15 minutes 
during the first few hours of life), 
lack of education and skills among 
staff supporting the dyad during 
transition while skin-to-skin, and 
unfamiliarity with the potential 
risks of unsafe positioning and 
methods of assessment that may 
avert problems. 
44 The main concerns 
regarding immediate postnatal SSC 
include sudden unexpected postnatal 
collapse (SUPC), which includes any 
condition resulting in temporary or 
permanent cessation of breathing or 
cardiorespiratory failure. 
45 
– 
48 Many, 
but not all, of these events are related 
to suffocation or entrapment. In 
addition, falls may occur during SSC, 
particularly if unobserved, and other 
situations or conditions may occur 
that prevent SSC from continuing 
safely. 
44, 
 
49
SUPC is a rare but potentially fatal 
event in otherwise healthy-appearing 
term newborns. The definition of 
SUPC varies slightly depending on 
the author and population studied. 
One definition offered by the British 
Association of Perinatal Medicine 
50 
includes any term or near-term 
(defined as >35 weeks’ gestation in 
this review) infant who meets the 
following criteria: (1) is well at birth 
(normal 5-minute Apgar and deemed 
well enough for routine care), (2) 
collapses unexpectedly in a state 
of cardiorespiratory extremis such 
that resuscitation with intermittent 
positive-pressure ventilation is 
required, (3) collapses within the 
first 7 days of life, and (4) either dies, 
goes on to require intensive care, 
or develops encephalopathy. Other 
potential medical conditions should 
be excluded (eg, sepsis, cardiac 
disease) for SUPC to be diagnosed. 
The incidence of SUPC in the first 
hours to days of life varies widely 
because of different definitions, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria of 
e3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
newborns being described, and lack 
of standardized reporting and may 
be higher in certain settings. The 
incidence is estimated to be 2.6 to 
133 cases per 100 000 newborns. In 
1 case series, the authors described 
one-third of SUPC events occurring 
in the first 2 hours of life, one-third 
occurring between 2 and 24 hours 
of life, and the final third occurring 
between 1 and 7 days of life. 
51 Other 
authors suggested that 73% of SUPC 
events occur in the first 2 hours of 
life. 
52 In the case series by Pejovic and 
Herlenius, 
 
51 15 of the 26 cases of SUPC 
were found to have occurred during 
SSC in a prone position. Eighteen were 
in primiparous mothers, 13 occurred 
during unsupervised breastfeeding 
at <2 hours of age, and 3 occurred 
during smart cellular phone use by 
the mother. Five developed grade 2 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy 
(moderate encephalopathy), with 4 
requiring hypothermia treatment. 
Twenty-five of the 26 cases had 
favorable neurologic outcomes in 1 
series; however, in another review, 
mortality was as high as 50%, and 
among survivors, 50% had neurologic 
sequelae.53 Experimental models 
suggest that autoresuscitation of 
breathing after hypoxic challenge 
takes longer with lower postnatal 
age and decreased core body 
temperature. 
54
SUPC, in some definitions, includes 
acute life-threatening episodes; 
however, the latter is presumed to 
be more benign. An apparent life-
threatening episode, or what may 
be referred to as a brief resolved 
unexplained event, may be low risk 
and require simple interventions 
such as positional changes, brief 
stimulation, or procedures to resolve 
airway obstruction. 
46, 
 
53
Falls are another concern in the 
immediate postnatal period. Mothers 
who are awake and able to respond 
to their newborn infant immediately 
after birth may become suddenly and 
unexpectedly sleepy, ill, or unable to 
continue holding their infant. Fathers 
or other support people providing 
SSC may also suddenly become 
unable to continue to safely hold the 
newborn because of lightheadedness, 
fatigue, incoordination, or other 
factors. If a hospital staff member 
is not immediately available to take 
over, unsafe situations may occur, 
and newborns may fall to the floor or 
may be positioned in a manner that 
obstructs their airway.
SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE SAFETY 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER DELIVERY
Several authors have suggested 
mechanisms for standardizing the 
procedure of immediate postnatal SSC 
to prevent sentinel events; however, 
none of the checklists or procedures 
developed have been proven to reduce 
the risk. Frequent and repetitive 
assessments, including observation 
of newborn breathing, activity, 
color, tone, and position, may avert 
positions that obstruct breathing or 
events leading to sudden collapse. 
41 
In addition, continuous monitoring 
by trained staff members and the use 
of checklists may improve safety. 
35 
Some have suggested continuous 
pulse oximetry; however, there 
is no evidence that this practice 
would improve safety, and it may be 
impractical. Given the occurrence of 
events in the first few hours of life, 
it is prudent to consider staffing the 
delivery unit to permit continuous staff 
observation with frequent recording 
of neonatal vital signs. A procedure 
manual that is implemented in a 
standardized fashion and practiced 
with simulation drills may include 
sequential steps identified in Box 1. 
55
BOX 1: PROCEDURE FOR IMMEDIATE 
SKIN-TO-SKIN CARE
Risk stratification and associated 
monitoring and care may avert 
SUPC, falls, and suffocation. 
59 High-
risk situations may include infants 
who required resuscitation (ie, any 
positive-pressure ventilation), those 
with low Apgar scores, late preterm 
and early term (37–39 weeks’ 
gestation) infants, difficult delivery, 
mother receiving codeine 
60 or other 
medications that may affect the 
newborn (eg, general anesthesia or 
magnesium sulfate), sedated mother, 
and excessively sleepy mothers 
and/or newborns. Mothers may be 
assessed to determine their level 
of fatigue and sleep deprivation. 
61 
In situations such as those 
described, increased staff vigilance 
with continuous monitoring, as 
described previously, is important 
to assist with SSC throughout the 
immediate postpartum period. 
62 
Additional suggestions to improve 
safety include enhancements to the 
environment, such as stabilizing 
the ambient temperature,

of appropriate lighting so that the 
infant’s color and condition can be 
easily assessed, and facilitating an 
unobstructed view of the newborn 
(Box 2). Additional support persons, 
such as doulas and family members, 
may augment but not replace staff 
monitoring. Furthermore, staff 
education, appropriate staffing, and 
awareness of genetic risks may limit 
sentinel events such as SUPC. These 
suggestions, however, have not yet 
been tested in prospective studies to 
determine efficacy.
BOX 2. COMPONENTS OF SAFE 
POSITIONING FOR THE NEWBORN 
WHILE SKIN-TO-SKIN62:
SSC may be continued while moving 
a mother from a delivery surface 
(either in a delivery room or 
operating room) to the postpartum 
maternal bed. Transitions of 
mother-infant dyads throughout 
this period, and from delivery 
settings to postpartum settings, 
facilitate continued bonding, 
thermoregulation, and increased 
opportunities for breastfeeding. 
These transitions may be 
accomplished safely with skilled staff 
members by using a standardized 
procedure. 
64 A newborn who is not 
properly secured may pose a risk for 
falls or unsafe positioning, leading to 
suffocation.
SAFETY CONCERNS REGARDING 
ROOMING-IN
Despite all of the advantages of 
rooming-in, there are specific 
conditions that pose risks for 
the newborn. Many of the same 
concerns that occur during SSC in the 
immediate postnatal period continue 
to be of concern while rooming-in, 
especially if the mother and infant 
are sleeping together in the mother’s 
bed on the postpartum unit. 
65 In 
addition, breastfeeding mothers 
may fall asleep unintentionally while 
breastfeeding in bed, which can result 
in suffocation. 
66 Infant falls may be 
more common in the postpartum 
setting because of less frequent 
monitoring and increased time that a 
potentially fatigued mother is alone 
with her newborn(s). 
67 The Oregon 
Patient Safety Review evaluated 7 
hospitals that were part of 1 larger 
health system and identified 9 
cases of newborn falls (from 22 866 
births), for a rate of 3.94 falls per 
10 000 births over a 2-year period 
from 2006 to 2007, which is higher 
than previous reports of 1.6 per 
100 000. 
68– 
70 It is not clear whether 
this higher incidence was attributable 
to an actual increase or better 
reporting. For hospitals transitioning 
to mother-infant dyad care (1 nurse 
providing care for both mother 
and infant) or separate mother-
newborn care while rooming-in, 
it is important to communicate to 
staff that the same level of attention 
and care is necessary to provide 
optimal safety. Mothers will be 
naturally exhausted and potentially 
sleep-deprived or may sleep in short 
bursts. 
61 They may also be unable 
to adjust their position or ambulate 
safely while carrying a newborn. The 
postpartum period provides unique 
challenges regarding falls/drops 
and is understudied compared with

falls in the neurologically impaired 
or elderly patient. Checklists and 
scoring tools may be appropriate 
and have the potential to decrease 
these adverse events, particularly 
if geared to the unique needs of the 
postpartum period, such as short-
term disability from numbness or 
pain, sleepiness or lethargy related to 
pregnancy and delivery, and effects 
from medication. 
71
Even though mothers and family 
members may be educated about 
the avoidance of bed-sharing, 
falling asleep while breastfeeding or 
holding the newborn during SSC is 
common. Staff can educate support 
persons and/or be immediately 
available to safely place newborns 
on a close but separate sleep surface 
when mothers fall asleep. Mothers 
may be reassured that they or their 
support persons can safely provide 
SSC and that staff will be available 
to assist with the transition to a 
safe sleep surface as needed. 
Mothers who have had cesarean 
deliveries are particularly at risk 
because of limited mobility and 
effects of anesthesia and warrant 
closer monitoring. 
72
Several studies examining safety 
while rooming-in have been 
conducted. Sixty-four mother-infant 
dyads were studied in the United 
Kingdom and randomly assigned 
to have newborns sleep in a stand-
alone bassinet, a side-car bassinet 
( 
Fig 1), or the mother’s bed to 
determine perception of safety (by 
video monitoring) and breastfeeding 
outcomes. 
73 Breastfeeding was 
more frequent among those sharing 
a bed and using a side-car than a 
separate bassinet, but there were 
more hazards associated with bed-
sharing than using a side-car or 
bassinet. Although there were no 
adverse events in this study, the 
authors concluded that the side-car 
provided the best opportunities 
for breastfeeding with the safest 
conditions. In a similar study 
examining dyads after cesarean 
delivery, more hazards were 
associated with stand-alone bassinets 
than side-car bassinets. However, 
side-car technology for hospital 
beds is not yet well established in 
the United States, and safety data 
are not yet available. Given the 
level of disability in mothers who 
have had a cesarean delivery, side-
car technology holds promise for 
improvement in the safety of the 
rooming-in environment. 
74
SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE SAFETY 
WHILE ROOMING-IN
Healthy mother-infant dyads are 
safest when kept together and 
cared for as a unit in a mother-
infant setting. Staffing ratios are 
determined to meet the needs of both 
the mother and her newborn(s) and 
to ensure the best possible outcomes. 
The Association of Women’s Health, 
Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses’ 
recommendations are to have no 
more than 3 dyads assigned to 1 
nurse to avoid situations in which 
nursing staff are not immediately 
available and able to regularly 
monitor the mother-infant dyads 
throughout the postpartum period. 
75 
These ratios may permit routine 
monitoring, rapid response to 
call bells, and adequate time for 
teaching; however, nursing staff 
extenders, such as health educators 
and nursing assistants, may augment 
care. Mothers and families who are 
informed of the risks of bed-sharing 
and guided to place newborns on 
separate sleep surfaces for sleep 
are more likely to follow these 
recommendations while in the 
hospital and after going home. 
Family members and staff can be 
available to assist mothers with 
transitioning the newborn to a safe 
sleep location, and regular staff 
supervision facilitates the recognition 
of sleepy family members and 
safer placement of the newborns in 
bassinets or side-cars.
SUGGESTIONS FOR ROOMING-IN
1. Use a patient safety contract with 
a particular focus on high-risk 
situations (see parent handout 
Newborn Safety Information for 
Parents 
68 and sample contract 
71).
2. Monitor mothers according to 
their risk assessment: for example, 
observing every 30 minutes 
during nighttime and early 
morning hours for higher-risk 
dyads. 
69
3. Use fall risk assessment tools. 
76
4. Implement maternal egress 
testing (a modification of a tool 
originally designed to transfer 
obese patients from bed to stand, 
chair, or ambulation by using 
repetition to verify stability), 
especially if the mother is using 
medications that may affect 
stability in ambulating. 
69
5. Review mother-infant equipment 
to ensure proper function and 
demonstrate the appropriate use 
of equipment, such as bed rails 
and call bells, with mothers and 
families.
6. Publicize information about 
how to prevent newborn falls 
throughout the hospital system.
7. Use risk assessment tools to avoid 
hazards of SSC and rooming-in 
practices. 
77
TRANSITIONING TO HOME AND SAFE 
SLEEP BEYOND DISCHARGE
Information provided to parents at 
the time of hospital discharge should 
include anticipatory guidance about 
breastfeeding and sleep safety. 
3, 
 
78, 
 
79 
Pediatricians, hospitals, and other 
clinical staff should abide by AAP 
recommendations/guidance on 
breastfeeding and safe sleep, pacifier 
introduction, maternal smoking, 
use of alcohol, sleep positioning, 
bed-sharing, and appropriate 
sleep surfaces, especially when 
practicing SSC. 
79 In addition, the 
AAP recommends the avoidance of

practices that increase the risk of 
sudden and unexpected infant death, 
such as smoking, the use of alcohol, 
placing the infant in a nonsupine 
position for sleep, nonexclusive 
breastfeeding, and placing the infant 
to sleep (with or without another 
person) on sofas or chairs.79, 
 
80 
To facilitate continued exclusive 
breastfeeding, the coordination 
of postdischarge support is 
recommended to enable the best 
opportunity to meet breastfeeding 
goals. Mothers may be referred to 
peer support groups and trained 
lactation specialists if breastfeeding 
problems occur. Community support 
is optimized by coordination with the 
medical home.

CONCLUSIONS
Pediatricians and other providers 
have important roles in the 
implementation of safe SSC and 
rooming-in practices. Safe 
implementation with the use of a 
standardized approach may prevent 
adverse events such as SUPC and falls.
The following suggestions support 
safe implementation of these 
practices:
1. Develop standardized methods 
and procedures of providing 
immediate and continued SSC 
with attention to continuous 
monitoring and assessment.
2. Standardize the sequence 
of events immediately after 
delivery to promote safe 
transition, thermoregulation, 
uninterrupted SSC, and 
direct observation of the first 
breastfeeding session.
3. Document maternal and 
newborn assessments and any 
changes in conditions.
4. Provide direct observation of the 
mother-infant dyad while in the 
delivery room setting.
5. Position the newborn in a 
manner that provides an 
unobstructed airway.
6. Conduct frequent assessments 
and monitoring of the mother-
infant dyad during postpartum 
rooming-in settings, with 
particular attention to high-risk 
situations such as nighttime and 
early morning hours.
7. Assess the level of maternal 
fatigue periodically. If the 
mother is tired or sleepy, 
move the infant to a separate 
sleep surface (eg, side-car or 
bassinet) next to the mother’s 
bed.
8. Avoid bed-sharing in the 
immediate postpartum period 
by assisting mothers to use a 
separate sleep surface for the 
infant.
9. Promote supine sleep for all 
infants. SSC may involve the 
prone or side position of the 
newborn, especially if the dyad 
is recumbent; therefore, it is 
imperative that the mother/
caregiver who is providing SSC 
be awake and alert.
10. Train all health care personnel 
in standardized methods of 
providing immediate SSC 
after delivery, transitioning 
the mother-infant dyad, 
and monitoring the dyad 
during SSC and rooming-in 
throughout the delivery 
hospital period.
