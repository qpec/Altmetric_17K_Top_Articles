Abstract
Background Vagal nerve blockade (vBloc) therapy was shown
to be a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe obe-
sity. This report summarizes the safety and efficacy of vBloc
therapy in the prespecified subgroup of patients with moderate
obesity.
Methods The ReCharge Trial is a double-blind, randomized
controlled clinical trial of participants with body mass index
(BMI) of 40–45 or 35–40 kg/m2 with at least one obesity-
related comorbid condition. Participants were randomized 2:1
to implantation with either a vBloc or sham device with weight
management counseling. Eighty-four subjects had moderate
obesity (BMI 35–40 kg/m2) at randomization.
Results Fifty-three participants were randomized to vBloc and
31 to sham. Qualifying obesity-related comorbidities included
dyslipidemia (73 %), hypertension (58 %), sleep apnea (33 %),
and type 2 diabetes (8 %). The vBloc group achieved a percent-
age excess weight loss (%EWL) of 33 % (11 % total weight loss
(%TWL)) compared to 19 % EWL (6 % TWL) with sham at
12 months (treatment difference 14 percentage points, 95 % CI,
7–22; p<0.0001). Common adverse events of vBloc through
12 months were heartburn/dyspepsia and implant site pain; the
majority of events were reported as mild or moderate.
Conclusions vBloc therapy resulted in significantly greater
weight loss than the sham control among participants with mod-
erate obesity and comorbidities with a well-tolerated safety
profile.

Introduction
The vagal nerve blockade (vBloc) device was developed to
provide an alternative to standard bariatric surgery for patients
with BMI of 35 to 45 kg/m2. Placement of the device is by
standard laparoscopic surgical techniques without anatomic al-
terations of the gastrointestinal tract. Development of vagal
blocking was based on prior observations that vagotomy could
improve obesity [1], including hypothalamic damage obesity
[2], and is thought to help patients control feelings of hunger.
Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated clinically mean-
ingful weight loss with vBloc therapy [3–5] and improvement in
obesity-related comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes
mellitus (DM2) [6]. Vagal blockade using the vBloc Maestro
System is the first new obesity treatment device to receive FDA
approval in 14 years.
Weight loss and safety results from the ReCharge random-
ized controlled trial, which evaluated vBloc therapy using a
rechargeable device, have been reported [4]. Using a mixed-
effects analysis of the intent-to-treat population, an estimated
mean percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) of 26 % (10 %

 TWL) for vBloc and 17 % for sham (6 % TWL) (p<0.001) at
12 months was demonstrated.
Patients with moderate obesity, BMI 35–40 kg/m2, partic-
ularly those with obesity-related comorbid conditions, is a
cohort of interest since health care assessment groups have
noted lack of clinical evidence in this population [7]. The
ReCharge Trial enrolled an appreciable number of participants
with moderate obesity, and this report summarizes safety and
efficacy data from the trial through 12 months in this patient
group to confirm that the moderate BMI group had similar
efficacy and safety results to the overall cohort and address
the lack of clinical evidence in this population.
Methods
Participants
The ReCharge Trial study design and methods have been de-
scribed previously [4]. The majority of participants were en-
rolled at eight sites in the USA, with two additional sites in
Australia. Participants were eligible for enrollment if their
BMI was 40–45 or 35–40 kg/m2 with one or more of the
following obesity-related comorbidities: type 2 diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea syndrome,
or obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. This report includes only
those participants with BMI 35–40 kg/m2.
Study Design
ReCharge is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled tri-
al comparing vBloc to a custom-designed sham device.
Randomization occurred at implant in a 2:1 ratio to vBloc and
sham in permuted block sizes of 3 or 6 stratified by clinical site
and type 2 diabetes mellitus status.
Participants and all follow-up personnel, including the spon-
sor, were blinded until 12-month visits were completed for all
trial participants. The interaction of the surgeon with study par-
ticipants was limited after randomization until the study was
unblinded due to the difference in implantation techniques for
the two study arms. The study was not unblinded until all par-
ticipants finished their 12-month visit and data were verified.
The safety of the study was monitored by an independent
data and safety monitoring board, and all serious adverse events
(SAEs) were independently adjudicated for relatedness by an
independent clinical events committee (CEC). The ethical stan-
dards for subject treatment set forth in the Helsinki Declaration
of 1975 were followed. Written informed consent was obtained
from all study participants. The study received institutional re-
view board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) approval from
Bellberry Limited EC, Scottsdale Clinical Research Institute
Scottsdale Healthcare, Tufts Medical Center IRB, Oregon
Health & Science University IRB, Mayo Clinic Rochester
IRB, Stanford University Medical Center IRB, University of
Minnesota IRB, Scripps IRB, and Western IRB. The study
was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier
NCT01327976.
Intervention
The Maestro Rechargeable System consists of two implanted
components: (1) leads that are placed around the anterior and
posterior vagal trunks near the esophagogastric junction using
standard laparoscopic surgery and (2) a rechargeable
neuroregulator placed subcutaneously on the thoracic wall
[8]. The neuroregulator requires in-home transcutaneous
charging approximately two times weekly using a transmit
coil placed over the neuroregulator.
The sham arm neuroregulator was custom-designed by the
sponsor to dissipate electrical charge at a rate identical to the
active device. In the sham device, charge was dissipated into
resistors within the sham neuroregulator rather than delivering
charge to the vagus. No electrodes were implanted and the
abdominal cavity was not entered. Skin incisions, placed
where trocars would typically be placed, were made to simu-
late the laparoscopic procedure and support blinding the par-
ticipant and the follow-up personnel.
The neuroregulator was programmed in both vBloc and
sham groups to deliver at least 12 h of therapy per day. Of
note, frequent charging of the devices was required in both
groups despite no therapy delivery in the sham group. This
was a feature designed to protect study blinding. The protocol
prespecified weekly therapy current amplitude level increases
over the first month to 6 mA. If needed, the amplitude could
be adjusted on an alternate schedule by the follow-up team if
the participant experienced any discomfort related to the ther-
apy. All participants were asked to check their battery level
daily and to recharge their battery when necessary.
Follow-up visits occurred weekly in the first month, bi-
weekly through month 3, and monthly thereafter. Monthly
visits were conducted within a 2-week window. All patients
participated in a weight management program that typically
consisted of a 15-min educational discussion at each visit on
healthy food choices, exercise, and behavioral modification
by a trained dietitian or a research assistant.
Study Objectives
The primary 12-month efficacy and safety endpoints of the
entire study population have been previously reported [4],
and overall study outcomes will continue to be assessed for
5 years. The prespecified coprimary efficacy endpoints were
as follows: (1) to compare the mean %EWL of the vBloc and
sham groups (in the entire sample, at a superiority margin of
10 %) and (2) to assess whether the percentage of participants
in the vBloc group with at least 20 % EWL exceeded 55 %
984
OBES SURG (2016) 26:983–989
 and whether the percentage with at least 25 % EWL exceeded
45 %. The primary safety endpoint was to determine whether
the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device,
implant/revision procedure, or therapy in the vBloc group was
less than 15 %.
This report focuses on efficacy and safety, through
12 months, in the moderately obese subgroup with BMI of
35 to 40 kg/m2. We also present the mean comparison using
percentage total weight loss (%TWL) and various commonly
cited %TWL thresholds.
Statistical Analysis
Mixed-effects regression models were used to conduct analyses
on the weight loss data in this moderate BMI cohort using the
intention-to-treat (ITT) population [9]. Models were fit with an
unstructured covariance matrix and treating time (study visits) as
a categorical variable with time-specific contrasts. Data are as-
sumed to be missing at random under these models. Weight loss
results are also reported as a complete case analysis.
Weight loss results are not reported using the last observation
carried forward (LOCF) method, the primary imputation method
for the 12-month results for the entire ITT population [4], due to
the limitations in statistical properties of LOCF imputation [9].
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3.
Results
Participant Baseline Characteristics and Disposition
Of the 162 randomized vBloc participants and 77 sham partic-
ipants, 53 vBloc and 31 sham participants were moderately
obese with comorbidities at baseline. The treatment groups were
well balanced on baseline demographics and medical character-
istics in the moderately obese subgroup (Table 1).
Approximately 80 % of the participants were female, and the
mean age was 52, and the mean BMI was 38 kg/m2. The most
common obesity-related comorbidities were dyslipidemia, hy-
pertension, and obstructive sleep apnea.
The CONSORT diagram for moderately obese participants
in the ReCharge Trial is shown in Fig. 1. Four participants in the
vBloc group and three in the sham group had withdrawn from
the study by the 12-month visit. The four withdrawals in the
vBloc group were due to intra-operative exclusions (discovery
of prior upper GI surgery, >5 cm hiatal hernia, cirrhotic liver, and
delayed gastric emptying), so the device was not implanted. The
three withdrawals in the sham group occurred after implant and
were due to breast cancer in one case and subject decision in two
cases. One participant in the vBloc group required surgical re-
vision to correct tilt of the neuroregulator within the subcutane-
ous pocket; the revision was uncomplicated with the patient
released on the same day as the procedure. The 12-month visit
completion rates were 87 % in both the vBloc and sham groups.
Weight Loss
Weight loss expressed as both %EWL and %TWL through
12 months is shown in Fig. 2. At 12 months, the estimated mean
%EWL was 33 % (95 % CI, 29–38) in the vBloc group and
19 % (95 % CI, 13–24) in the sham group in the ITT population,
with a corresponding treatment difference between groups of 14
percentage points (95 % CI, 7–22, p<0.0001). Estimated mean
%TWL was 11 % (95 % CI, 10–12) in the vBloc group and 6 %
(95 % CI, 4–8) in the sham group, with a treatment difference of
5 percentage points (95 % CI, 2–7, p<0.0001).
Among the patients completing the 12-month visit (complete
case), the mean %EWL was 34 % in the vBloc group and 20 %
in the sham group (treatment difference 14 percentage points;
95 % CI, 4–24, p=0.009) and mean %TWL was 11 % in vBloc
group and 7 % in the sham group (treatment difference 5

a Excess weight was calculated as the difference between the weight at the
time of implantation and the ideal body weight corresponding to a BMI of

teristics between the two treatment groups

 percentage points, 95 % CI, 1–8, p = 0.010). The percent-
age of patients who achieved categorical weight loss
thresholds from 20 % EWL to 50 % EWL and from
7.5 % TWL to 15 % TWL is shown in Table 2. The
vBloc group had a higher percentage of patients achieve each
level of weight loss, and the relative difference between the
treatment groups increased as the threshold of weight loss
became more difficult to attain. For example, 50 % of vBloc
participants achieved at least 30 % EWL compared to 26 % in
the sham group; however, 24 % of vBloc participants
achieved the higher threshold of at least 50 % EWL compared
to 0 % of participants in the sham group.
Safety
The adverse event (AE) profile related to device, procedure, or
therapy (Table 3) in this subset of the vBloc group was similar
to the entire population at 12 months [4]. Heartburn and dys-
pepsia, neuroregulator site pain, other pain, abdominal pain,
incision pain, nausea, eructation/belching, and dysphagia are

 the most frequently reported related AEs. More pain at the
neuroregulator site was reported in the sham than vBloc group
in this subpopulation, though considering the size of the active
vBloc and sham devices were identical, this is likely a chance
finding due to small sample size. All nonserious AEs in this
cohort were reported as mild or moderate in severity, and 84 %
of events had resolved at 12 months. Most related events were
temporary side effects of the procedure or therapy which re-
solved with no intervention or with a change in therapy
algorithm.
No primary safety endpoint-related SAEs occurred in the
moderately obese vBloc participants through 12 months.
Three SAEs (5.7 %) were adjudicated as related to general
intra-abdominal surgery in the vBloc arm. Two events were
mild or moderate events of nausea due to anesthesia and one
event was discovery of a cirrhotic liver at implant, so the par-
ticipant was not implanted.
Discussion
In the subset of participants with a BMI from 35 to 40 kg/m2
and at least one obesity-related comorbid condition in the
ReCharge Trial, weight loss with vBloc therapy was shown
to be superior to a rigorous sham control. The vBloc group
demonstrated an average weight loss of 33 % EWL or 11 %
TWL, with half of participants achieving at least 30 % EWL
and one in four patients achieving at least 50 % EWL. In
addition, vBloc therapy had a low rate of associated risks.
No primary safety endpoint-related events occurred, and all
nonserious AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Most AEs
spontaneously resolved or were addressed with modification
of the therapy algorithm.
With the combination of clinically meaningful weight loss
and favorable safety profile in the moderately obese popula-
tion, vBloc is a reasonable next step after diet and exercise
have failed, or for patients not willing to undergo, or not ap-
propriate candidates for, more aggressive surgical interven-
tions [10–12]. There is currently a treatment gap between
those patients who can be successful with diet and exercise
and those willing to undergo surgery, so additional efficacious

 and safe treatment options for obesity and comorbidities are
needed. While longer-term efficacy data need to be further
studied, the 1-year weight loss reported provides support that
vagal blockade may be considered an effective alternative to
conventional weight loss surgery particularly in this moderate
obesity patient group.
Weight loss in the sham group was greater than ex-
pected, which has been discussed elsewhere [4]. Briefly,
it was hypothesized that the sham response was due to
the robust placebo effect of sham surgery along with
daily monitoring and recharging of the sham device.
In keeping with our dietary intervention studies, the
sham effect was not found to persist in the entire cohort
of the ReCharge Trial through 18 months as the sham
group regained 40 % of the weight lost at 12 months
[5].
The analysis in this report has limitations. First, this
is an analysis of a subgroup of the entire randomized
sample and has limitations inherent to subpopulations.
On the other hand, this is offset somewhat by the fact
that this subgroup analysis was prespecified, the analy-
sis was conducted using the ITT population, and there
were little missing data. Second, analysis of a subgroup
diminishes the statistical power to identify significant
differences between the treatment groups; however, sta-
tistical superiority in mean weight loss was achieved
and most weight loss thresholds were met despite this
reduced power. Third, results for this subgroup are pre-
sented at 12 months, so the durability of weight loss in
this subset of participants requires additional follow-up.
Results of the entire ReCharge cohort through 18 months
have been published [5] and show that the weight loss
among vBloc participants were largely sustained, where-
as the sham group regained nearly half of the weight
they had lost through 12 months despite remaining
blinded through most of the period between 12 and
18 months.
Conclusions
Individuals with moderate obesity have been considered
well-suited candidates for vBloc therapy given that the
minimally invasive procedure does not require perma-
nent changes to gastrointestinal anatomy, is reversible,
and appears to have a more favorable safety profile to
traditional weight loss surgery. In this moderately obese
population, the ReCharge Trial demonstrated superior
weight loss in the vBloc therapy group than the sham
group among participants with moderate obesity.
Therapy with vBloc is safe and well tolerated.
Additional long-term data and continued follow-up of
the ReCharge study are needed to further characterize
the safety and effectiveness profile of vBloc therapy in
subjects with moderate obesity.
