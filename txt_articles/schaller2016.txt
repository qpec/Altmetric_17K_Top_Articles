Summary
Background Immobilisation predicts adverse outcomes in patients in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Attempts to 
mobilise critically ill patients early after surgery are frequently restricted, but we tested whether early mobilisation leads to 
improved mobility, decreased SICU length of stay, and increased functional independence of patients at hospital discharge.
Methods We did a multicentre, international, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial in SICUs of 
fi
 ve university hospitals in Austria (n=1), Germany (n=1), and the USA (n=3). Eligible patients (aged 18 years or older, 
who had been mechanically ventilated for <48 h, and were expected to require mechanical ventilation for ≥24 h) were 
randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a stratifi
 ed block randomisation via restricted web platform to standard of care 
(control) or early, goal-directed mobilisation using an inter-professional approach of closed-loop communication and 
the SICU optimal mobilisation score (SOMS) algorithm (intervention), which describes patients’ mobilisation capacity 
on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no mobilisation) to 4 (ambulation). We had three main outcomes 
hierarchically tested in a prespecifi
 ed order: the mean SOMS level patients achieved during their SICU stay (primary 
outcome), and patient’s length of stay on SICU and the mini-modifi
 ed functional independence measure score 
(mmFIM) at hospital discharge (both secondary outcomes). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01363102).
Findings Between July 1, 2011, and Nov 4, 2015, we randomly assigned 200 patients to receive standard treatment 
(control; n=96) or intervention (n=104). Intention-to-treat analysis showed that the intervention improved the 
mobilisation level (mean achieved SOMS 2·2 [SD 1·0] in intervention group vs 1·5 [0·8] in control group, p<0·0001), 
decreased SICU length of stay (mean 7 days [SD 5–12] in intervention group vs 10 days [6–15] in control group, 
p=0·0054), and improved functional mobility at hospital discharge (mmFIM score 8 [4–8] in intervention group vs 
5 [2–8] in control group, p=0·0002). More adverse events were reported in the intervention group (25 cases [2·8%]) 
than in the control group (ten cases [0·8%]); no serious adverse events were observed. Before hospital discharge 
25 patients died (17 [16%] in the intervention group, eight [8%] in the control group). 3 months after hospital discharge 
36 patients died (21 [22%] in the intervention group, 15 [17%] in the control group).
Interpretation Early, goal-directed mobilisation improved patient mobilisation throughout SICU admission, 
shortened patient length of stay in the SICU, and improved patients’ functional mobility at hospital discharge.

Introduction
More than 5·7 million patients in the USA, and more 
than 2 million patients in Germany are treated annually 
in intensive care units, of which about one-third are 
admitted to these wards after an elective or emergency 
surgical procedure. Muscle weakness is as common as 
arterial hypotension in the surgical intensive care unit 
(SICU),1–3 and is predictive of adverse outcomes in 
critically ill patients.4–7
Intensive care unit-acquired muscle weakness, a term 
describing several pathological entities with similar 
clinical features,3,8 can be aggravated by immobilisation,3,9–11 
which is often prescribed in patients in the SICU as a by-
product of a well established safety culture.12,13 Mobilisation 
is often neglected, delayed, or done with subjective 
provider-specifi
 c eff
 orts,14 due to scarcity of knowledge 
 
and available evidence. Because tools to measure the 
eff
 ect of early, goal-directed mobilisation therapy in the 
SICU were not available, as a fi
 rst step our team created 
the SICU optimal mobilisation score (SOMS), a 
numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no mobilisation) 
to 4 (ambulation), which describes patients’ mobilisation 
capacity. We validated SOMS in English, German, and 
Italian, as the basis to achieve early, goal-directed 
mobilisation therapy in the SICU.14–18
In this study we tested if early, goal-directed mobilisation, 
using a strict mobilisation algorithm combined with 
facilitated inter-professional communication, in critically 
ill SICU patients leads to improved mobility during SICU 
admission, decreased length of stay on the SICU, and 
increased functional independence at hospital discharge.

[Salzburg]), Germany (Klinikum rechts der Isar der 
Technischen Universität München [Munich]), and the 
USA (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [Boston, 
MA], Massachusetts General Hospital [Boston, MA], and 
University of Massachusetts Medical Center [Worcester, 
MA]). The research protocol was approved by all 
participating centres’ institutional review boards, who 
provided provide ethical approval, and has been 
published.17
Participants
We enrolled SICU patients who were aged 18 years or 
older, were mechanically ventilated for less than 48 h, 
and expected to require mechanical ventilation for at 
least another 24 h at the time of screening. Patients were 
included if they were functionally independent at 
baseline with a Barthel Index Score19 of at least 70 at 
2 weeks before admission to the SICU, based on patient 
or proxy completion of the measure. We excluded 
patients if they were admitted to hospital for more than 
5 days before screening, had a motor component of 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) lower than 5, had irreversible 
disorder with a 6-month mortality of greater than 50%, 
had raised intracranial pressure, had a cardiopulmonary 
arrest, had unstable fractures contributing to probable 
immobility, were included in another trial at the same 
time as our trial, had acute myocardial infarction, did not 
have lower part of their legs, had a rapidly developing 
neuromuscluar disease, were pregnant, or had a ruptured 
or 
leaking 
aortic 
aneurysm. 
Licensed 
physician 
investigators identifi
 ed eligible patients and approached 
the patients’ legally authorised representatives to obtain 
consent. In addition, study consent was reviewed in alert, 
oriented and non-delirious patients after extubation or 
after recovery from critical illness.
Randomisation and masking
We used a randomised block design, stratifi
 ed by GCS 
score (≤8 or >8) and Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation II (APACHE II; ≤12 or >12). Each 
randomisation block in each stratifi
 cation group was 
designated to randomly assign the patients (in a 
1:1 ratio) to either the intervention (early, goal-directed 
mobilisation) or the standard control group. We 
completed randomisation through an internet-based 
access-restricted platform by entering the centre and 
centre-specifi
 c patient number for documentation as 
well as APACHE and GCS scores for stratifi
 cation. 
Investigators had no access to the randomisation list and 
were not aware of the size of the randomisation block. 
Patients were not made aware of their assignment. 
Functional mobility at hospital discharge was assessed 
with 
the 
mini-modifi
 ed 
functional 
independence 
measure score (mmFIM) by trained and masked study 
staff
 .
Procedures
Participants in both study groups were managed by goal-
directed sedation with daily awakening trials; daily 
spontaneous 
breathing 
trials; 
daily 
neurological 
assessments; screening for arousal, delirium, and pain 
intensity; and regular evaluation for early enteral feeding 
(appendix). The decision to wean from mechanical 
ventilation was based on the protocol, and the decision 
to extubate was made by the treating physician based on 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the PubMed database for studies published between 
July 1, 2011, and April 1, 2016, regarding “early mobilization” OR 
“early mobilisation” or “early rehabilitation” AND “critical care” or 
“intensive care” or “critically ill”, and also screened the referenced 
literature in the published reviews. At the start of enrolment, we 
found two prospective studies undertaken in medical intensive 
care units (ICUs; one cohort, one randomised study), which 
reported patients treated with early mobilisation had better 
outcomes than those treated with standard of care: fewer 
hospital and ICU days, fewer days to fi
 rst day out of bed, and 
better functional mobility at hospital discharge.
On our last search, using the same criteria, we found 
two randomised controlled studies, both published since 2015, 
on early mobilisation in patients in the ICU, in two diff
 erent 
cohorts (patients with ARDS and those with stroke).
Added value of this study
We report, to our knowledge, the fi
 rst multicentre, 
randomised controlled study of early, goal-directed 
mobilisation in surgical critical care. We used the surgical 
optimal mobilisation score (SOMS) algorithm validated in 
three languages (English, Italian, and German), and we 
facilitated inter-professional communication.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data could lead to an increased use of a protocolised early 
mobility intervention including a dedicated patient mobility 
facilitator in surgical, critically ill patients, which improves 
functional independence at hospital discharge, and leads to 
improved discharge disposition. Our results are directly 
applicable to millions of surgical, critically ill patients who 
speak English, Italian, or German. Early, goal-directed 
mobilisation will probably be used in surgical ICU patients 
recovering from severe trauma and major surgery. Potential 
barriers for this goal could be addressed across shifts by 
inter-professional closed-loop communication.

local protocols and standards of care. The charge nurse 
and the SICU medical director (in European centres: 
medical director only) checked every day during rounds 
which patients could be discharged. ICU discharge 
readiness depended on standard criteria: absence of 
use of vasoactive drug prescriptions administered 
intravenously; stable gas exchange (oxygen therapy 
provided by nasal cannula only); adequate pain, anxiety 
and agitation control; and no use of spinal drains.20
Participants in the intervention group received the 
same level of clinical care as the control group 
(institutional standard of care) except for early, goal-
directed mobilisation.
Mobilisation in the control group was done in line 
with the individual centres’ practice guidelines for 
mobilisation and physical therapy (appendix). These 
guidelines are in accordance with published reports.21,22
Data from all centres were coded and stored in a central 
database (REDCap [Research Electronic Data Capture]) 
managed by the Massachusetts General Hospital. A Data 
Safety Monitoring Board convened at Massachusetts 
General Hospital to review adverse events and monitor 
the trial.
The intervention consisted of two parts. First, a 
mobilisation goal was defi
 ned during daily morning 
ward rounds and second, goal implementation across 
shifts was facilitated by inter-professional closed-loop 
communication (fi
 gure 1).
The intervention began no later than 1 day after trial 
enrolment. Each SICU selected a facilitator, who was an 
experienced member of critical care staff
  (either physical 
therapist, nurse, or a medical doctor) responsible for the 
implementation of the early, goal-directed mobilisation 
algorithm. The facilitator worked with the clinical teams 
(medical doctors, nurses, and physical therapists) to 
defi
 ne a daily mobility goal based on the mobility 
algorithm.15,16,18 The goal for a specifi
 c day was set either to 
level 0 (no mobilisation), level 1 (passive range of motion 
exercises in the bed), level 2 (sitting), level 3 (standing), 
or level 4 (ambulation). During a morning round, the 
facilitator guided each inter-professional clinical team to 
implement specifi
 c procedures to achieve this goal, and 
to identify and address barriers. After this structured 
process, a sign with the target mobility goal was posted at 
the participant’s bedside and the clinical team worked 
towards the goal throughout the day. To ensure 
achievement of the goal, progress and barriers to 
successful implementation were identifi
 ed by the 
facilitator through multiprofessional closed-loop com-
munication. Concerns from the clinical team regarding 
the proposed mobility goal or the patient’s response to 
mobilisation were elicited in a systematised approach. 
On the basis of the input received during the process of 
inter-professional discussion, changes in the treatment 
plan were implemented until the goal was reached. 
Finally, in the evening the achieved mobility level was

 nition of mobility goal. On the basis of a clinical examination taken on rounds, a daily challenging mobilisation goal was defi
 ned as either level 0 (no mobilisation), level 1 (passive range of 
motion exercises in the bed), level 2 (sitting), level 3 (standing), or level 4 (ambulation). (B) Implementation of mobilisation therapy. The target mobilisation goal was posted at the patient’s bedside. 
Barriers to successful implementation were then identifi
 ed by the facilitator through multi-professional closed-loop communication. Concerns raised by nurses, physical therapists, and intensive care 
unit (ICU) physicians and primary teams were invited in a systematised approach. The facilitator emphasised clear communication of the challenging mobility goal between ICU and primary teams, 
and made sure the mobility goal was addressed during ICU handover from day to night shifts. ICP=intracranial pressure. SCI=spinal cord injury. EVD=extracranial ventricular drains. CVVH=continuous

documented in the patient’s record and communicated 
across shifts. The achieved mobility levels were then 
collected from patients’ records by study staff
  and used 
for analysis.
Outcomes
We had three main outcomes that we tested in an a priori 
defi
 ned, hierarchical order.17 The primary outcome was 
the mean SOMS level patients achieved during their 
SICU stay, documented every day on patients’ records 
and collected by study staff
 . Mean SOMS level was 
calculated after the end of the study by the statistician 
(SJS, MB, TH, and TK). The two key secondary outcomes 
were patient’s length of stay on SICU, and the mmFIM 
(adapted from the modifi
 ed functional independence 
measure score23,24), representing functional mobility at 
hospital discharge. Transfer and locomotion ability for 
the mmFIM was assessed by trained, masked, study staff
  
on the basis of patient chart review and bed-side clinical 
examination, as appropriate.
We assessed functional capacity for locomotion and 
transfers (eg, moving oneself from a bed to a chair), each 
on a scale of 1 (near complete dependence) to 4 (complete 
independence).
An additional secondary outcome was the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) sum score25 to test global muscle 
strength, which was administered once a week by trained 
study staff
 17 while the patient was in the SICU. An MRC 
sum score of less than 48 defi
 ned clinically signifi
 cant 
muscle weakness. The secondary outcome of quality of 
life was assessed with the 36-item Short Form survey,26 
which was measured at 3 months after hospital discharge 
by trained, masked study staff
 .
To discriminate between mobility-related and mobility-
unrelated eff
 ects, we measured prespecifi
 ed tertiary 
outcomes that we believed were likely to be mobility-
related, and possibly unspecifi
 c (mobility-unrelated) 
endpoints. Mobility-related endpoints included daily 
high serum glucose concentrations (mmol/L), functional 
status (mmFIM) at SICU discharge, length of stay on the 
SICU until readiness for discharge (calculated from 
SICU admission until discharge readiness, as determined 
by the clinical team), hospital length of stay, in-hospital 
mortality, 3-month mortality, and discharge disposition. 
Mobility-unrelated endpoints were ICU delirium-free 
days, ventilator-free days, ICU sedation-free days, 
neuromuscular blocking agent-free days, vasopressor-
free days, mean daily morphine equivalent dose (mg), 
number of days receiving corticosteroids, and daily high 
serum sodium concentration (mmol/L).
Patients’ physiological parameters were monitored 
throughout the study as clinically indicated. The clinical 
team could interrupt mobilisation if a patient’s clinical 
condition deteriorated. The mobility goal set by the team 
was meant to be adequate15,17 to avoid the associated 
harm with immobilisation.10,27–29 All adverse events were 
summarised by treatment group and reported to the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board via email. 
Statistical analysis
The sample size calculation was based on published 
data from two studies15,30 on our hierarchical sequenced 
main outcomes.17 Data from the Massachusetts General 
Hospital on SICU mobility supported a SOMS diff
 erence 
of 1 (SD 1·5) and a correlation of SOMS to SICU length 
of stay of Pearson correlation coeffi
  cient (r) of –0·54.15

Data from a medical ICU mobility study supported 
complete mobility independence (mmFIM score of 4) of 
59% of patients in the intervention group and 35% of 
patients in the control group at hospital discharge.30 To 
fi
 nd eff
 ects of early, goal-directed mobilisation on the 
three hierarchical sequenced main outcomes, the total 
power was calculated by multiplication of the individual 
power estimates. With the assumption of an 11% mortality 
rate, and an 11% attrition rate, we estimated that enrolling 
100 patients in each treatment group would result in 
a greater than 80% power to identify an inter-group 
diff
 erence with a two-sided α error of 0·05.
The primary analysis (main outcomes) was done in the 
intention-to-treat analysis and the secondary outcomes 
were analysed in the per-protocol population. The eff
 ect of 
additional covariates (study centre, trauma, APACHE II 
score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, procedural severity 
score31) on results of the early, goal-directed mobilisation 
intervention were examined in several sensitivity analyses 
(appendix). Summary statistics of mean (SD) for normally 
distributed data or median (IQR) for skewed data were 
generated for continuous variables, and frequency 
(percentage) was generated for categorical or ordinal 
variables. The three main outcomes of the study were 
tested with a hierarchical sequence. This hierarchy 
allowed for the primary hypotheses to be tested in an a 
priori specifi
 ed order with a two-sided α error of 0·05 
without adjustment for multiple testing.32 By use of 
a Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test, where 
appropriate for continuous variables, the main outcomes 
were tested in the following predefi
 ned order: mean 
achieved SOMS level, SICU length of stay, and mmFIM 
score at hospital discharge. If a p value was larger than 
the predefi
 ned α error, the procedure terminated. In this 
case, no further interpretations could be based on 
outcomes that have a rank less than or equal to that 
endpoint whose null hypothesis was the fi
 rst that could 
not be rejected.32–37 We analysed categorical outcomes

using χ² test, or Fisher’s exact test, and summarised using 
odds ratios (95% CI).
All outcome measures were monitored from study 
day 1 and stopped at SICU discharge, unless otherwise 
indicated to allow for a time-dependent analysis of 
positive and negative outcomes in all patients. The 
predefi
 ned period for outcome-free days was 28 days 
and any participant who died before day 28 had all 
subsequent days counted as not outcome free (appendix). 
We considered all days after SICU discharge as outcome 
free. We used R statisical analysis program. (version 
3.2.2) for all analyses. This trial is active but not 
recruiting, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01363102. 
 
Role of the funding source
 
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. SJS, MB, TH, TK, and ME had full access to 
all the data in the study and the corresponding author 
(ME) had responsibility for the decision to submit. 
Results
From July 1, 2011, to Nov 4, 2015, we randomly assigned 
200 eligible adult patients to receive either standard 
treatment (96 [48%] patients; control group) or early, 
goal-directed mobilisation therapy (104 [52%] patients; 
intervention group; fi
 gures 1 and 2). Seven (7%) patients 
in the intervention group were not included in the per-
protocol population. Four patients voluntarily withdrew 
consent and three patients were not eligible (due to 
treatment plan being changed to comfort care) after 
obtaining consent (fi
 gure 2).
The baseline characteristics were similar between the 
two treatment groups (table 1; appendix). All patients, 
except for one who had supportive parenteral feeding, 
were self-feeding before admission to the SICU. In the 
control group, slightly more patients presented with 
trauma (31 vs 21) and cerebrovascular disease (17 vs 9) 
than in the intervention group. 
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mobilisation goal 
was achieved in 817 (89%) of 918 study days in the 
intervention group, leading to a signifi
 cantly higher 
mean achieved SOMS level in the intervention group 
 
than in the control group (group diff
 erence 0·7, 95% CI 
0·4–1·0, p<0·0001; table 2). Patients in the intervention 
group reached higher levels of mobilisation earlier in the 
SICU stay (fi
 gure 3), and left the SICU with a signifi
 cantly 
higher mobilisation level as documented by the fi
 nal 
SOMS level (p<0·001; appendix), compared with those in 
the control group. In the intervention group 52 (52%) 
patients had achieved a SOMS level 4 (ambulating) at 
ICU discharge compared with 24 (25%) patients in the 
control group (appendix). 
SICU length of stay in the intention-to-treat 
population was signifi
 cantly shorter in the intervention 
group than in the control group (group diff

95% CI –6·0 to –1·0, p=0·0054; table 2; appendix). The 
mobility-related functional independence scores at 
hospital discharge were signifi
 cantly higher in the 
intervention group than in the control group (group 
diff
 erence 3, 95% CI 1–4, p=0·0002; table 2; appendix). 
The likelihood of complete functional independence at 
hospital discharge (achieved the maximum mmFIM 
score) was signifi
 cantly higher in the intervention 
group than in the control group (p=0·0030; table 2; 
appendix). 
Both 
subdomains 
of 
the 
mmFIM 
(locomotion and transfers) were signifi
 cantly improved 
in the intervention group at hospital discharge, with 
47 (54%) of 87 survivors in the intervention group 
having achieved complete independence (level 8; 
(level 4 in subdomain transfer and level 4 in subdomain 
locomotion) versus 27 (31%) of 88 survivors in the 
control group in the subdomain of locomotion, and 
53 (61%) survivors in the intervention group versus 
27 (31%) survivors in the control group in the 
subdomain of transfers (appendix).
To evaluate whether missing data in patients who died 
in the hospital resulted in an appreciable bias, we applied 
additional confi
 rmatory analyses with similar results 
(appendix). The results of the main outcomes were 
similar between groups in the per-protocol analysis 
(appendix).
In the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations 
we found no signifi
 cant diff
 erences between groups in 
the incidence of signifi
 cant muscle weakness (score <48; 
table 2). Similarly, we found no signifi
 cant diff
 erences 
between groups in the quality of life, as assessed through 
the 36-item Short Form Health Survey at 3 months after 
hospital discharge (table 2); however, a high proportion 
of patients were lost to follow-up (could not be contacted 
or declined to participate) before completion of the 
survey (75 [38%] patients [38 in intervention group and 
37 in control group]; fi
 gure 2; appendix).
For mobility-related outcomes, use of early, goal-
directed mobilisation signifi
 cantly improved functional 
status of patients at time of SICU discharge in the 
intervention group compared with those in the control 
group (p=0·009; table 2). The time from SICU admission 
to SICU discharge readiness was shorter for patients in 
the intervention group (5 days) than for those in the 
control group (7 days; group diff
 erence –2, 95% CI 
–4 to –1, p=0·0006; table 2; appendix). This diff
 erence 
resulted in a mean decrease of ICU stay of 3 days. 
Patients in the intervention group were discharged 
earlier (p=0·011; table 2), and to a desirable disposition 
(to their home; p=0·0007) signifi
 cantly more often than 
those in the control group (table 2; appendix). For the 
mobility-unrelated outcomes, only ICU delirium-free 
days signifi
 cantly diff
 ered between groups, with patients 
in the intervention group being free from delirium for 
longer than those in the control group (p=0·0161; table 2). 
Other prespecifi
 ed tertiary outcomes did not diff
 er 
between groups (table 2; appendix).
We reported 35 (2·3% of mobilisation days) adverse 
events in 2164 ICU days in relation to mobilisation, 
with ten (0·8%) cases in the control group of 
908 mobilisation days and 25 (2·8%) cases in the 
intervention group of 1246 intervention days (table 3).

event. We recorded no adverse events of falls, 
dislodgement of endotracheal tubes or central lines, or 
episodes of hypertension. No serious adverse events 
were documented.
Mortality was not a prespecifi
 ed adverse event and did 
not signifi
 cantly diff
 er between groups. Before hospital 
discharge 17 (16%) patients died in the intervention 
group and eight (8%) patients died in the control group 
(p=0·09). 3 months after hospital discharge 21 (22%) of 
patients in the intervention and 15 (17%) patients in the 
control group had died (p=0·35).
Discussion 
Early, goal-directed mobilisation therapy in the SICU 
increased patients’ mobility level, decreased the length of 
stay in the SICU and hospital, and improved functional 
independence at hospital discharge.
Despite reports on the eff
 ectiveness of early 
mobilisation in medical ICU patients,30,38,39 early mob-
ilisation during the fi
 rst 3 days after admission to an 
ICU40 is not typically implemented in surgical patients.12,13 
Reasons as to why mobilisation is not used in patients in 
the SICU include missing evidence of effi
  cacy, confl
 icting 
results in medical and neurological ICU patients,30,41–43 
concern for patient safety and comfort, and scarcity of 
available staff
 .44,45
The eff
 ects of mobilisation therapy in the ICU were 
analysed in diff
 erent cohorts defi
 ned by disease entity. 
Morris and co-workers were the fi
 rst to report in a 
prospective cohort38 on the eff
 ects of early mobilisation 
(within 48 h of intubation and 72 h of admission to the 
medical ICU) in patients with acute respiratory failure. 
The authors38 showed that patients in the intervention 
group had a reduced length of stay in ICU and hospital. 
Our randomised trial supports the eff
 ect of an early 
mobility intervention on ICU length of stay and its 
reduction in patients’ length of stay in hospital, and we 
add the observation that early, goal-directed mobilisation 
improves functional mobility at hospital discharge.
Schweickert and colleagues’ randomised controlled 
study30 in 104 sedated, adult, medical ICU patients who 
had been on mechanical ventilation for less than 72 h 
examined the eff
 ects of a strategy for whole-body 
rehabilitation consisting of interruption of sedation and 
physical and occupational therapy in the earliest days of 
critical illness. The authors30 reported that early 
mobilisation was safe and well tolerated, and its use 
resulted in better functional outcomes at hospital 
discharge, shortened duration of delirium, and patients 
had more ventilator-free days than did patients receiving 
standard care.30 Our data show the benefi
 cial eff
 ects of 
early mobilisation on functional mobility at hospital 
discharge in surgical ICU patients. By contrast with the 
results of Schweickert and colleagues,30 we did not 
identify eff
 ects of early mobilisation on ventilator-free 
days compared with the control group, an endpoint that 
might refl
 ect diff
 erences between the groups in sedation 
management rather than mobility. We also did not 
identify diff
 erences in tertiary endpoints included to 
assess for mobility-unrelated treatment eff
 ects: ICU 
sedation-free days, vasopressor-free days, neuromuscular 
blocker-free days, and mean daily morphine equivalent 
dose. These fi
 ndings from our trial could support the 
view that our control and intervention groups both 
received similar treatment in line with recommended 
ICU standards of care, such as goal-directed sedation, 
sedation holidays, and spontaneous breathing trials.46,47
Immobilisation is a known risk factor of delirium.48,49 
Similar to fi
 ndings in the medical ICU,30,39 the occurrence 
of delirium was lower in patients undergoing early, goal-
directed mobilisation than in those receiving standard 
care. A patient who has delirium in the ICU will likely 
have subsequent delirium once discharged to a non-ICU 
ward, and potentially a decrease in cognitive function at 
hospital discharge,50 which might have contributed to the 
favourable outcomes in the intervention group.
Our study suggests that early start of mobilisation was 
the key to success. A randomised controlled trial41 showed

that even intensifi
 ed physical therapy started a median 
8 days after ICU admission was unable to improve overall 
patient outcomes (physical function, ICU hospital-free 
days, or discharge disposition). Moss and colleagues41 
enrolled patients in medical ICUs who had received 
mechanical ventilation for at least 4 days for acute 
respiratory failure. The ICU mobility intervention by 
physical therapists started after a median 8 days in the 
ICU did not result in improved functional independence.
Similarly, Morris and colleagues51 did not observe 
eff
 ects of ICU rehabilitation on length of stay in the ICU 
or hospital, but patients had improved functional status 
at 6 months. In comparison to our study, the patients 
in Morris and colleagues’ study51 were more often 
chronically ill, had received mechanical ventilation for 
longer before enrolment, and the process of progressing 
patients’ physical activities was less standardised.
In patients with previous stroke, early and intensive 
mobilisation therapy might lead to a reduction in 
favourable outcome.42 In a parallel-group, single-blind, 
randomised controlled trial42 including 2104 patients with 
ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, those who received 
the early mobilisation protocol had a reduction in 
favourable outcomes after 3 months. A follow-up analysis 
suggested that the specifi
 c frequency and duration of 
the mobilisation sessions needed to be optimised to avoid 
the harmful eff
 ects of aggressive early mobilisation in 
patients with stroke and to have a positive eff
 ect 
on neurological outcomes.43 Additionally, a preclinical 
study52 suggested that even sensory stimulation early after 
stroke might increase the size of the stroke and aff
 ect 
neurofunctional outcome, supporting the view that 
optimal mobilisation dosing in the ICU should take into 
account patients’ disease entity. The diff
 erences in 
outcomes between our study and data reported by Moss 
and colleagues41 and Bernhardt and colleagues43 might be 
accounted for by diff
 erences in case mix, disease entity, 
and timing of the intervention. Our early intervention 
study was undertaken in a mixed cohort of trauma and 
major surgery patients, whereas the two other studies 
assessed patients with ARDS41 and those with stroke.43 
We started our intervention (very) early into patients’ ICU 
stay,40 and showed its strong effi
  cacy. Our patient population 
reached functional independence in 51% of patients in the 
intervention group versus 28% of patients in the control 
group at hospital discharge. This result might also 
characterise improved value of surgical care.6,53 We 
speculate that the increased number of patients who were 
completely independent with ambulation and transfer 
mobility at hospital discharge was a key contributing factor 
to the observed diff
 erence in discharge disposition.
In an era of value-based health care and payment 
models, our intervention needed minimal or sometimes 
no increase in resources, and resulted in improved 
patient care, thus increasing the value of care delivered.54 
This study did not require an additional physical therapist 
dedicated to improve mobilisation therapy. However, the 
facilitator dedicated up to 15 min per patient every day to 
the intervention (goal assignment in the morning, and 
closed-loop communication). Although both groups had 
an equivalent total duration of physical therapy, the 
intervention group had a shorter length of stay in the 
SICU and hospital, and had a higher odds ratio of 
achieving functional independence at discharge, a factor 
that might aff
 ect long-term outcomes.55
Our study has limitations that should be considered. 
First, the bedside clinicians could not be masked to patient 
group assignment. However, trained masked assessors 
completed all possible outcome measurements. Second, 
generalisability to non-surgical ICU patients or non-
ventilated surgical ICU patients might be restricted 
because of patients we excluded. Our inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are very similar to other studies 
that investigated early mobilisation.30,56,57 These studies 
targeted critically ill patients receiving mechanical 
ventilation (who are rarely mobilised12,13), were at an early 
stage of acute disease (<72 h40), and had no functional 
limitation before ICU admission, where it was possible to 
see improvement in mobility through intervention. About 
40% of patients admitted to the ICUs alone were not 
ventilated and therefore were already ineligible to 
participate in our study. Third, seven patients randomly 
assigned to the intervention group were either changed 
from treatment to comfort care on the basis of discussions 
with health-care proxies, or voluntarily withdrew consent 
from the study and therefore had to be excluded in the 
per-protocol analysis. Nevertheless, results were similar 
between the intention-to-treat population, with those 
seven excluded patients, and the per-protocol analysis 
without them. Fourth, protocols for the control group 
were slightly diff
 erent across study centres. However, no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erences were recorded in percentage of 
spontaneous awakening and breathing trials done, and 
our post-hoc analysis showed a stable eff
 ect of the 
intervention when the possible eff
 ect of study centre was 
included in a sensitivity analysis (appendix). Fifth, an 
eff
 ect of mortality-associated missing data needs to be 
considered. Our analyses stratifi
 ed for mortality indicate 
our eff
 ect size is stable. Finally, the number of patients 
without any information at 3 months’ follow-up was high 
(73 [37%] patients), so the results of our secondary 
outcomes (quality of life and mortality at 3 months) 
should be interpreted with caution.
In summary, early, goal-directed mobilisation therapy 
with use of a validated algorithm combined with 
facilitated inter-professional communication improved 
the mobility level achieved during the SICU stay, 
decreased length of stay on the SICU, and increased the 
functional outcome of SICU patients at hospital 
discharge. The results of our study indicate that the 
creation of an inter-professional algorithm to guide early, 
goal-directed mobilisation in the SICU, and its rigorous 
implementation, improve patient outcomes and increase 
the value of patient care.
