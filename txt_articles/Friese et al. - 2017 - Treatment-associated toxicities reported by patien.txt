BACKGROUND: Patient-reported toxicities help to appraise the breast cancer treatment experience. Yet extant data come from clini-
cal trials and health care claims, which may be biased. Using patient surveys, the authors sought to quantify the frequency, severity,
and burden of treatment-associated toxicities. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2014, the iCanCare study surveyed a population-based
sample of women residing in Los Angeles County and Georgia with early-stage, invasive breast cancer. The authors assessed the fre-
quency and severity of toxicities; correlated toxicity severity with unscheduled health care use (clinic visits, emergency department
visits/hospitalizations) and physical health; and examined patient, tumor, and treatment factors associated with reporting increased
toxicity severity. RESULTS: The overall survey response rate was 71%. From the analyzed cohort of 1945 women, 866 (45%) reported
at least 1 toxicity that was severe/very severe, 9% reported unscheduled clinic visits for toxicity management, and 5% visited an emer-
gency department or hospital. Factors associated with reporting higher toxicity severity included receipt of chemotherapy (odds ra-
tio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.0-2.5), receipt of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7), and
Latina ethnicity (OR vs whites: 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5). A nonsignificant increase in at least 1 severe/very severe toxicity report was ob-
served for bilateral mastectomy recipients (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: Women with early-stage invasive breast cancer
report substantial treatment-associated toxicities and related burden. Clinicians should collect toxicity data routinely and offer early
intervention. Toxicity differences observed by treatment modality may inform decision making. Cancer 2017;123:1925-34. V

INTRODUCTION
Cancer treatments have a narrow therapeutic index. Clinicians constantly weigh the anticipated benefits of anticancer
treatments against the risks of treatment-associated toxicities. Toxicities may lead to treatment discontinuation,1,2 costly
health care service use,3 and premature death.4 Toxicities place physical, emotional, and financial burdens on patients and
families.5 Toxicity management also consumes clinician and practice resources.6
Despite the burdens placed on patients, families, and health care systems, to the best of our knowledge few data sour-
ces capture toxicities reliably. Treatment-related toxicity studies generally derive from clinical trials data,7 health care
claims,8 and single-site patient registries,9 with notable limitations of generalizability, data quality, and biased reporting.
In 2007, a National Cancer Institute-sponsored working group developed a patient-reported version of the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the CTCAE

 (PRO-CTCAE) enables patients to report the frequency,
severity, and burden of toxicities and addresses well-
documented biases observed with clinician-reported tox-
icity ratings.10,11
To the best of our knowledge, few studies to date
have solicited the toxicity experience directly from diverse,
population-based patient samples. Describing the pat-
terns, correlates, and frequencies of treatment-associated
toxicities from a large population-based sample allows cli-
nicians to understand the actual patient treatment experi-
ence outside the narrow confines of rigorously conducted
clinical trials. Such data could inform targeted, proactive
efforts to identify patients at risk of burdensome toxicities,
enable earlier intervention, and improve quality of life.
In this context, we analyzed data collected from a
population-based survey of women diagnosed with early-
stage invasive breast cancer. We examined the frequency
and severity of toxicities associated with cancer treatment.
We next explored the correlation between toxicity reports
and physical health and health care service use. Finally, we
examined patient, tumor, and treatment factors associated
with toxicities rated as severe or very severe.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling and Survey Procedures
The iCanCare study is a population-based mailed survey
of women with early-stage breast cancer. In partnership
with the Los Angeles County and Georgia Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programs, the
iCanCare study identified 3880 women aged 20 to 79
years who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer
determined by a definitive breast surgery date between
July 1, 2013 and September 31, 2014. Women were sent
surveys approximately 2 months after surgery and com-
pleted the survey on average approximately 7 months after
diagnosis. To enable meaningful analyses across racial and
ethnic groups, African American and Latina women were
oversampled in Los Angeles County. The following wom-
en were excluded from the iCanCare study sampling pro-
tocol: those with stage III or IV cancer (because the overall
project was focused on patients with early-stage disease),
those with Paget disease, or those with tumors measuring
>5 cm in size. In Los Angeles County, non-Hispanic
white and African American individuals aged <50 years
were excluded due to a competing study in these
populations.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the University of Michigan and partnering in-
stitutions. Informed by the methods of Dillman et al,12
we solicited participation with an incentive of $20 in cash.
Study coordinators in respective geographic areas contin-
ued to follow up with nonresponders, including up to 9
attempted telephone calls and 2 repeated mailings. Partic-
ipants received survey materials to their home address
with a statement that their answers would not be shared
individually with their providers. Study materials were
printed in English; women with Spanish surnames re-
ceived Spanish and English materials.13
Of the 3880 women originally identified, 249 were
ineligible. Of these 3631 women, 1053 women were not
reached or did not return questionnaires, resulting in an
overall response rate of 71% (2578 women). After exclud-
ing 694 women with ductal carcinoma in situ or bilateral
disease, our analytic sample included 1884 observations
in the observed data and 1945 observations after multiple
imputation. SEER registries linked surveys to standard-
ized tumor registry data.
Measures
Except when indicated, measures were collected from
patient
questionnaires.
The
primary
outcome
was
treatment-associated toxicities. Informed by the PRO-
CTCAE working group14 and our pilot work,15 partici-
pants rated the severity of 7 toxicities at their worst during
cancer treatment using a 5-point Likert scale (0 indicates
none, 1 indicates mild, 2 indicates moderate, 3 indicates
severe, and 4 indicates very severe). The toxicities mea-
sured were nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, pain,
arm edema, dyspnea, and breast skin irritation. These tox-
icities were selected after interviews with survivors and
analysis of toxicity reports in pilot work.15
Because to the best of our knowledge few studies to
date have investigated patient-reported, treatment-associ-
ated toxicities, we measured toxicities in 3 ways. First, we
examined the range of severity ratings across toxicities.
Next, we constructed a scale by multiplying the number
of toxicities reported by severity. For example, a score of 3
might reflect 1 toxicity that was rated as severe or 3 toxic-
ities rated as mild, and a score of 28 would reflect that a
patient reported all 7 toxicities as very severe.
To examine toxicity burden, we examined physical
health and health care service use. To measure physical
health, we used the 4-item physical function subscale of
the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Informa-
tion System (PROMIS) global health measure. The scale
is a brief, valid, reliable, precise, and clinically interpret-
able measure of physical health.16 Respondents rated each
item on a 5-point ordinal scale. The score was standard-
ized and normalized according to the scoring manual;

 scores <40 reflected poor physical health.17 To measure
health care service use, we asked patients whether they 1)
did not seek help, 2) called/e-mailed their provider, 3) dis-
cussed at a routine visit, 4) discussed at an unscheduled
visit, or 5) visited the emergency department/hospital.
We classified unscheduled care as either an unscheduled
clinic visit, emergency department visit, or inpatient hos-
pitalization for toxicity management.
Patients reported their age, race/ethnicity (white,
black, Latina, or Asian), education (�high school, some
college, �college graduate), and prior comorbidity diag-
nosis (chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, or
stroke) (no diagnosis, 1 condition, or �2 conditions). We
included 4 separate variables to capture treatment factors:
primary breast surgery (lumpectomy, unilateral mastecto-
my, or bilateral mastectomy), radiotherapy (yes/no), sys-
temic chemotherapy (yes/no), and receipt of both
radiotherapy and chemotherapy (yes/no). SEER registries
provided tumor information: AJCC summary stage (I or
II), grade (1, 2, or 3), and lymph node status (N0 or N1).
We calculated the difference between the date of patient
survey completion and the cancer diagnosis date.
Statistical Analysis
First, we used descriptive statistics to examine patient, dis-
ease, and treatment factors in our analytic sample and
then examined these factors in the subset of women who
rated at least 1 toxicity as severe/very severe, as well as
within the subset of women who reported unscheduled
care for toxicity management. Next, for each of the 7 tox-
icities and corresponding severity rating, we calculated the
percentage of women who also reported health care service
use (telephone call, scheduled visit, unscheduled visit, or
emergency department visit/hospitalization) for that tox-
icity. Using the multiplied scale of the number of toxic-
ities reported by their severity, we next plotted the
corresponding PROMIS physical function scores. Using
multivariable regression, we examined 2 dependent varia-
bles, unscheduled care and PROMIS physical function
scores, by toxicity score, controlling for patient, tumor,
and treatment factors. Finally, we used multivariable ordi-
nal logistic regression with design weights reflecting the
probability of selection and nonresponse to examine the
relationship of patient, tumor, and treatment factors with
higher levels of toxicity severity.
Unless specified, analyses controlled for geography
(Los Angeles County and Georgia) and were weighted to
account for differing probabilities of sample selection and
nonresponse.18 We identified small amounts of missing
data (range, 0%-3.9% across variables; 93% of observa-
tions had complete data). To minimize biased estimates
from missing data, we applied a sequential regression mul-
tiple imputation framework.19 We generated 5 inde-
pendently imputed data sets and computed inferential
statistics that combined analyses across data sets.20 Impu-
tation results were indistinguishable from the complete
case analysis. Table 1 is based on complete case analysis
(number identified in the table for each variable) and all
subsequent figures and regression results are based on
multiply imputed data (1945 women).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows patient characteristics, including women
who reported any of the 7 measured toxicities as severe/
very severe, and those who sought unscheduled care for
toxicities via clinic visits, emergency department visits, or
hospitalizations.
Frequency and Severity of Patient-Reported
Toxicities
Women with early-stage invasive breast cancer reported
several toxicities during treatment, many of which were
rated as severe or very severe. A total of 132 patients (7%)
reported that none of the 7 toxicities occurred during
treatment. A total of 1810 women (93%) reported at least
1 toxicity and 866 of the women in the analytic sample
(45%) rated at least 1 toxicity as severe/very severe.
Among the 7 toxicities, pain was most frequently reported
as severe/very severe (23%), followed by constipation
(14%) and breast skin irritation (13%).
Toxicities and Health Care Service Use
Figure 1 shows patient reports of health care service use by
each toxicity studied and the corresponding severity rat-
ing. Across all 7 toxicities, 2% to 4% of patients did not
endorse a toxicity rating but discussed the problem during
a routine office visit. The majority of patients sought help
during an office visit (range, 22%-77% across the 7 toxic-
ities); telephone calls/e-mails and emergency department
visits/hospitalizations were less frequently reported. For
women who experienced at least 1 toxicity, approximately
9% sought care through a previously unscheduled clinic
visit and 5% visited an emergency department or hospital.
Nausea/vomiting and diarrhea were frequent sources
of telephone calls/e-mails; 29% of patients with very
severe nausea/vomiting and 27% of patients with very
severe diarrhea called or e-mailed their provider. Severe
arm edema (77%) and very severe skin irritation (71%)
were the primary reasons for unscheduled clinic visits.
Patients with severe/very severe dyspnea most frequently

 visited emergency departments or hospitals for toxicity
management (28%), followed by patients with severe/
very severe arm edema (27%), severe/very severe diarrhea
(18%), and severe/very severe pain (18%).
Toxicities and Physical Health
The mean physical functioning score on the PROMIS
measure was 14.5 (standard deviation, 3), reflecting sub-
stantial deficits from the optimal score of 50. Figure 2
shows the relation between the multiplied toxicity rating
(number of toxicities and toxicity severity rating) and
PROMIS physical scores estimated by a regression model,
with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
Higher PROMIS scores reflect better physical functioning
and higher toxicity scores reflect more frequent and/or
severe toxicity ratings. These scores were averaged across
age, comorbid conditions, chemotherapy receipt, em-
ployment, marital status, and race/ethnicity. PROMIS
physical functioning scores were found to correlate li-
nearly, negatively, and significantly with toxicity ratings
(b 520.2; 95% CI, 20.3 to 20.2). Patients without tox-
icity had the highest scores, whereas patients who reported
all 7 toxicities as severe reported scores at the lowest possi-
ble score of 10 on the scale.

 Factors Associated With Reporting a Severe
or Very Severe Toxicity
Figures 3A to 3C show the unadjusted differences in tox-
icity reporting by breast cancer treatment. Toxicity severi-
ty varied by receipt of chemotherapy (Fig. 3A). For
example, 29% of chemotherapy recipients reported se-
vere/very severe pain compared with 19% of women who
did not receive chemotherapy. Severe/very severe consti-
pation was reported by 24% of chemotherapy recipients
compared with 9% of women who did not receive chemo-
therapy. Patients who received radiotherapy reported
more severe/very severe skin irritation compared with
women who did not receive radiotherapy (22% vs 7%),
but did not differ with regard to other toxicities (Fig. 3B).
Toxicity severity varied by surgical treatment (Fig.
3C). For 5 of the 7 toxicities studied, women who under-
went bilateral mastectomy were more likely to report
more severe/severe toxicities (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, pain, and shortness of breath). More recipi-
ents of bilateral mastectomy (37%) reported severe/very
severe pain compared with those undergoing unilateral
mastectomy (25%) or lumpectomy (18%).
Figure 4 shows the results of a multivariable logistic
regression model that demonstrated significant associa-
tions between the toxicity category plus patient and treat-
ment factors associated with the toxicity severity. We also
included a variable to reflect patient receipt of both che-
motherapy and radiotherapy. Three toxicities were found
to be more frequently associated with more severe ratings:
pain (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95% CI, 4.2-5.3), skin irrita-
tion (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8-2.5), and constipation (OR,
1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.7). Women who received systemic ad-
juvant chemotherapy were more likely to report more se-
vere toxicity (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.4). Patients who
received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy had an

 additional 30% higher odds of more severe toxicity (OR,
1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7) compared with those receiving only
chemotherapy. Patients who underwent bilateral mastec-
tomy were more likely to report higher toxicity (OR, 1.2;
95% CI, 1.0-1.4) than unilateral mastectomy recipients,
but the difference did not reach statistical significance.
Older patients were significantly less likely to report
higher toxicity (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8). Patients with
more comorbidities were more likely to report higher tox-
icity (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5 for the first comorbidity).
Latina women were more likely than white women to re-
port higher toxicity (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5). Com-
pared with college graduates, women with some college
education were more likely to report higher toxicity (OR,
1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based sample of women with early-
stage, invasive breast cancer, a substantial number of
patients reported clinically burdensome toxicities during
treatment. A scaled measure that captured the number
and severity of toxicities was associated with poorer physi-
cal health and increased health care service use, including
unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department visits,
and inpatient admissions. Compared with those without
severe toxicities, women who reported at least 1 severe
toxicity differed with regard to age, comorbidity history,
race/ethnicity, and breast cancer treatment. These novel
data solicited directly from patients highlight oppor-
tunities to improve supportive care through targeted tox-
icity management and data-informed patient-provider
communication.
High rates of burdensome toxicities reported by
women with early-stage breast cancer support recent asser-
tions that many women with curable disease experience
“collateral damage” from breast cancer treatment.21 Near-
ly 25% of chemotherapy recipients in the current study
endorsed severe/very severe nausea/vomiting during their
cancer treatment. This finding likely reflects the inconsis-
tent adoption of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vom-
iting guidelines across diverse chemotherapy settings.22 It
is unclear whether patients receive standardized education
regarding toxicities expected during treatment. Targeting
toxicities that occur frequently and are reported as severe
or very severe is one important clinical intervention with
which to improve outcomes for women with early-stage
breast cancer.
Importantly, toxicity severity correlates with clinical-
ly significant physical health deficits. Breast cancer survi-
vorship guidelines stress the importance of optimal
physical health for survivors of breast cancer.23 The data
from the current study suggest burdensome toxicities oc-
cur in patients who do not receive chemotherapy and in-
terfere with physical health, which may threaten long-

 term outcomes. Supportive care programs that extend be-
yond chemotherapy recipients are needed to reduce toxici-
ty severity, maintain health, and enhance the survivorship
period. For example, routine toxicity assessments across
chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy clinics would
identify high-priority areas for interventions.
The findings of the current study are congruent with
a prospective study of Italian women recently diagnosed
with breast cancer and treated with adjuvant systemic
therapy who completed similar patient-reported toxicity
measures.24 High rates of gastrointestinal symptoms were
reported. Compared with the current study, lower rates of
pain were reported. In a small, longitudinal study of wom-
en receiving doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for early-
stage breast cancer, the most frequent, severe, and distress-
ing physical symptoms reported included pain.25 The dif-
ferences observed may be due to the different survey time
points or survey prompts; on average, participants in the
iCanCare study completed surveys 7 months after under-
going definitive breast surgery. In the survey, women rat-
ed the severity of their toxicities at their worst during
treatment. Although prior work has suggested that patient
recall of toxicities is valid and reliable,26 we cannot ex-
clude the possibility of recall bias.
The current study finding of higher toxicity burdens
for nonwhite patients may explain prior findings of linger-
ing quality of life deficits for Latinas with breast cancer27;
culturally sensitive toxicity management interventions
may be warranted. Women may perceive that bilateral
mastectomy is associated with improved survival and min-
imal differences in other outcomes.28 The data from the
current study suggest that recipients of bilateral mastecto-
my experience more toxicity severity compared with other
surgical options; pain reports are nearly double those
compared with women who undergo lumpectomy. Deci-
sion aids for women that present patient-reported
outcome rates across surgical modalities may bridge
knowledge gaps. If women are aware of the pain differ-
ences reported by procedure, their treatment preferences
may differ. Given the differential effects of chemotherapy
and radiotherapy, it is not surprising that women who re-
ceived both of these treatments reported higher toxicity
severity than patients who received unimodal treatment;
targeted interventions may be warranted in women who
receive multimodal treatment.
Patients and providers seek to boost the value of can-
cer care services. Despite excellent survival rates, cancer
treatment often leads to costly toxicity management, in-
cluding emergency department visits and hospitaliza-
tions,29 and unscheduled clinic visits that strain busy
clinicians. The value of cancer care may improve if toxic-
ities can be managed proactively, before they worsen.
Researchers have examined the efficacy of routine toxicity
assessments coupled with notification of aberrant results
to providers, with mixed results.29,30 The results of the
current study underscore the need for further research
that examines novel strategies with which to reduce pre-
ventable treatment toxicities.
Strengths of the current study include an excellent
response rate, a diverse patient sample, and patient-
centered measures of toxicity and health care service use.
Unlike chart review and claims-based approaches, our use
of patient-reported measures may overcome documented
concerns for clinician reporting of toxicities31 and mea-
surement challenges in health care claims.8 However, sev-
eral aspects of the current study merit comment. First, the
current study data were cross-sectional and causal rela-
tionships could not be assumed. We did not have access to
medical records to ascertain regimens, dosages, and tim-
ing of chemotherapy and radiation, nor did we have clini-
cian reports of toxicities and health care service use, which
could address concerns for patient recall. The survey tim-
ing should be considered when interpreting toxicity
reports and health care service use. Although our work
was informed by the National Cancer Institute’s PRO-
CTCAE working group,14 the study measures are not
identical in terms of the timing of administration and rat-
ing categories. Although the regions studied are diverse,
the results may not be generalizable to other settings. Giv-
en the overall project goal of understanding treatment pat-
terns in patients with early-stage breast cancer, the results
of the current study are germane to patients with early-
stage disease; similar investigations in patients with ad-
vanced disease would identify toxicity frequency and in-
tensity within the setting of more frequent multimodal
treatments.
Nearly one-half of women with early-stage, invasive
breast cancer experience toxicities they perceive as severe
or very severe, including women who do not receive adju-
vant systemic chemotherapy. These findings have impor-
tant clinical implications. The toxicity burden faced by
patients may be greater than acknowledged by clinicians,
and warrants routine assessment during and between clin-
ic visits. Differential toxicity patterns identified in this di-
verse, population-based sample of women may help
clinicians when they review the risks and benefits of breast
cancer treatment options. Data-driven patient education
and communication tools that compare patient-reported
outcomes from breast cancer treatments could inform de-
cision making and prepare women for the treatment

 experience. Pain control is challenging for many women
across diverse treatment plans. Gastrointestinal toxicities
plague chemotherapy recipients despite available practice
guidelines. Additional studies must help clinicians to dis-
tinguish the duration of treatment-associated toxicities
and their impact on therapy completion. Finally, the data
from the current study speak to the need for culturally tai-
lored interventions coupled with management protocols
