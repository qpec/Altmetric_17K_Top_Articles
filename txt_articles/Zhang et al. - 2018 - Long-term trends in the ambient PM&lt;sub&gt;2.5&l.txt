Abstract. Concentrations of both fi
ne particulate matter
(PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in the United States (US) have
decreased signifi
cantly since 1990, mainly because of air
quality regulations. Exposure to these air pollutants is as-
sociated with premature death. Here we quantify the an-
nual mortality burdens from PM2.5 and O3 in the US from
1990 to 2010, estimate trends and inter-annual variability,
and evaluate the contributions to those trends from changes
in pollutant concentrations, population, and baseline mor-
tality rates. We use a fi
ne-resolution (36 km) self-consistent
21-year simulation of air pollutant concentrations in the
US from 1990 to 2010, a health impact function, and an-
nual county-level population and baseline mortality rate esti-
mates. From 1990 to 2010, the modeled population-weighted
annual PM2.5 decreased by 39 %, and summertime (April to
September) 1 h average daily maximum O3 decreased by 9 %
from 1990 to 2010. The PM2.5-related mortality burden from
ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, lung cancer, and stroke steadily decreased by 54 % from
123 700 deaths year−1 (95 % confi
dence interval, 70 800–
178 100) in 1990 to 58 600 deaths year−1 (24 900–98 500) in
2010. The PM2.5-related mortality burden would have de-
creased by only 24 % from 1990 to 2010 if the PM2.5 concen-
trations had stayed at the 1990 level, due to decreases in base-
line mortality rates for major diseases affected by PM2.5. The
mortality burden associated with O3 from chronic respiratory
disease increased by 13 % from 10 900 deaths year−1 (3700–
17 500) in 1990 to 12 300 deaths year−1 (4100–19 800) in
2010, mainly caused by increases in the baseline mortality
rates and population, despite decreases in O3 concentration.
The O3-related mortality burden would have increased by
55 % from 1990 to 2010 if the O3 concentrations had stayed
at the 1990 level. The detrended annual O3 mortality bur-
den has larger inter-annual variability (coeffi
cient of varia-
tion of 12 %) than the PM2.5-related burden (4 %), mainly
from the inter-annual variation of O3 concentration. We con-
clude that air quality improvements have signifi
cantly de-
creased the mortality burden, avoiding roughly 35 800 (38 %)
PM2.5-related deaths and 4600 (27 %) O3-related deaths in
2010, compared to the case if air quality had stayed at 1990
levels (at 2010 baseline mortality rates and population).

Introduction
The 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study lists air
pollution as the fourth-highest ranking global mortality risk
factor (GBD 2016). The most recent GBD estimates that
exposure to ambient particulate matter (particulate size less
than 2.5 µm, PM2.5) causes 4.2 million (95 % confi
dence in-
terval (CI), 3.7–4.8 million) deaths globally, with an addi-
tional 254 000 (97 000–422 000) deaths globally caused by
exposure to ozone (O3) (Cohen et al., 2017). For the United
States (US), the same study estimated a mortality burden
attributable to ambient PM2.5 of 88 400 (66 800–115 000)
deaths, and 11 700 (4400–19 600) deaths attributable to O3
in 2015 (Cohen et al., 2017). Adopting similar methods, the
US burden of disease study lists ambient PM2.5 and O3 pollu-
tion as the 8th and 15th leading risk factors in the US in 2010
(Murray and Collaborators US Burden of Disease, 2013).
Over recent decades, emissions of air pollutants within
the US have signifi
cantly decreased and air quality has im-
proved. For example, between 1990 and 2010, total US an-
thropogenic emissions are estimated to have declined by
48 %, 49 %, 67 %, 60 % and 34 %, for NOx (= NO + NO2),
non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), SO2,
CO and PM2.5, respectively (Xing et al., 2013). EPA obser-
vations showed that the US average annual PM2.5 concen-
tration declined by 42 % from 2000 to 2016, and maximum
daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 declined by 22 % from 1990 to
2016 (US EPA, 2017). These air quality improvements were
likely mainly driven by ambient air quality standards, and
federal and state implementation of stationary and mobile
source regulations, especially the 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA)
Amendments, the 2002 NOx State Implementation Plans
(SIP) Call, and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (Chestnut
and Mills, 2005; US EPA, 2011), together with other rules to
reduce anthropogenic emissions from light duty, heavy duty,
and nonroad vehicles (Fann et al., 2012b; US EPA, 2014).
Other changes in energy and emission control technology
that occurred concurrently with air quality regulations also
helped to improve air quality. These decreased concentra-
tions are expected to have brought substantial benefi
ts for
public health in the US, but assessing the health benefi
ts re-
quires quantifi
cation of changes in human exposure relating
where air quality has improved to how population and base-
line mortality are distributed.
Several recent studies have assessed the global (Anenberg
et al., 2010; GBD, 2015, 2016; Lelieveld et al., 2015; Silva
et al., 2013, 2016b) or national (Fann et al., 2012a; Punger
and West, 2013) burdens of disease attributable to air pollu-
tion. However, less effort has been made to understand how
these burdens evolve over time. Cohen et al. (2017) used es-
timates of air pollutant concentrations from a combination
of air quality model simulations and satellite and surface ob-
servations to study the global and national temporal trends
of the burdens of disease attributable to ambient PM2.5 and
O3 (only model results were used for O3), at 5-year inter-
vals from 1990 to 2015. Two other studies (Butt et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017) used coarse-resolution model simulations
to study the global/hemispheric PM2.5 mortality burdens for
the past few decades. Fann et al. (2017) estimated the annual
mean PM2.5 concentration in the US from monitoring data
and its all-cause mortality burden in 1980, 1990, 2000 and
2010. Epidemiological studies have also inferred how health
effects have changed through time in the US (Correia et al.,
2013; Pope et al., 2009). However, previous studies have not
estimated mortality burdens for both PM2.5 and O3 in the US
for several years in succession or investigated the different
drivers for mortality trends or the inter-annual variability of
the mortality burdens. The inter-annual variability analysis
indicates whether the mortality burden at a given year, such
as the results from Cohen et al. (2017) and Fann et al. (2017),
is representative of years around it. In the US, such changes
in the air pollution mortality burdens can support decision
making on air pollution control policies. For the public, ana-
lyzing trends can effectively illustrate the benefi
ts of past air
pollution controls, as well as the challenges for future policy
efforts.
Here we aim to quantify air pollution-related mortality in
the continental US in each year from 1990 to 2010, mainly
to understand the trends over this time period. We also an-
alyze the contributions of changes in air pollutant concen-
trations, population, and baseline mortality rates to the over-
all trend, and analyze the inter-annual variability in mortality
burden estimates. To achieve this, we use a 21-year (1990–
2010) model simulation of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations over
the continental US (CONUS) from 1990 to 2010. We also
use annual county-level baseline mortality rates and popula-
tion archived by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC
WONDER, https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html, last ac-
cess: 5 October 2018).

Methodology
2.1
Air quality simulations
We use simulations of air quality over the CONUS from
1990 to 2010 by Gan et al. (2015, 2016). These simulations
used the WRF-CMAQ model which coupled the Weather Re-
search and Forecasting (WRF, v3.4) model and the Commu-
nity Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ, v5.02) model (Wong
et al., 2012), covering the CONUS at 36 km × 36 km. These
simulations used an internally consistent emission inven-
tory from 1990 to 2010 for the US developed by Xing
et al. (2013), three-dimensional meteorological fi
elds con-
strained by reanalysis of available surface and aloft mea-
surements of the atmospheric state, and time-varying lateral
boundary conditions provided by the hemispheric CMAQ
(Mathur et al., 2017; Xing et al., 2015). The model system
used the CB05 chemical mechanism with the AERO6 mod-
ule for aerosols.

Gan et al. (2015, 2016) showed that the modeled trends of
total PM2.5 and its components generally matched both the
CASTNET (Clean Air Status and Trend Network) and IM-
PROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protection Visual) ob-
servational data from 1995 to 2010, with correlation coeffi
-
cients usually larger than 0.87 for total PM2.5 and its com-
ponents. Moreover, the trends for PM2.5 and its species were
similar in direction and magnitude (Gan et al., 2015). There
was a small or nearly no trend for PM2.5 in the western US
for both the model and observations, but a dramatic decreas-
ing trend in the eastern US, with a larger decreasing trend
from the model (−0.44 µg m−3 year−1) than from the IM-
PROVE observations (−0.30 µg m−3 year−1).
For O3, Astitha et al. (2017) used dynamical evalua-
tion methods, and showed that the simulated O3 trends
generally agreed very well with the observed downward
trends, especially for the period from 2000 to 2010, al-
beit underestimating trends over some regions, for both the
May to September average of daily maximum 8 h (MDA8)
and annual 4th highest O3. From 2000 to 2010, the re-
gional trends for the 4th highest O3 from the model (ob-
servations) were −0.80 ppbv year−1 (−0.73 ppbv year−1) for
Southwest, −1.14 (−1.53) for Southcentral, −1.31 (−1.66)
for Southeast, −1.46 (−1.61) for Midwest, −1.35 (−1.79)
for Northeast, and −1.11 (−1.40) for CONUS.
2.2
Mortality burden attributable to ambient air
pollution
The mortality burdens attributable to ambient PM2.5 and
O3 (�Mort) are estimated using the health impact function
(HIF) following Eq. (1):
�Mort = y0 × AF × Pop,
(1)
where y0 is the baseline mortality rate for specifi
c diseases,
AF is the attributable fraction calculated as 1 − 1/RR, with
RR as the relative risk of death from a specifi
c disease, and
Pop is exposed population age 25 years and greater.
For PM2.5, RR is calculated using the integrated exposure–
response (IER) model (Burnett et al., 2014), which has
been extensively used by recent studies, including Liu et
al. (2017), Silva et al. (2016a, b), Wang et al. (2017), and
the World Health Organization (2016). The RR is calculated
as a function of PM2.5 concentration following Eq. (2):
for C < C0RR(C) = 1,
(2)
for C ≥ C0RR(C) = 1 + α ×
�
1 − exp
�
−γ × (C − C0)δ��
, (3)
where C is the annual average ambient PM2.5 concentration,
C0 is the PM2.5 threshold concentration (5.8–8.0 µg m−3),
below which no additional risk is assumed, and the param-
eter values of α, γ , and δ are given by distributions (Burnett
et al., 2014). For this study, the RRs are downloaded from
the GBD website (Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx),
2013).
For the O3-related mortality burden, RR = expβ�X, where
β is the concentration response factor, and �X is the differ-
ence in O3 concentration (summertime 1 h daily maximum
O3) between the current year (1990 to 2010) and the low-
concentration threshold. For RR, we use the value of 1.040
(with 95 % CI: 1.013, 1.067) from Jerrett et al. (2009) fol-
lowing recent studies (e.g., Cohen et al., 2017; GBD, 2015,
2016; Lim et al., 2012). Turner et al. (2016) found a larger
RR for respiratory mortality (RR, 1.12; 95 % CI, 1.08–1.16)
associated with the annual average of MDA8 O3, and us-
ing these results would likely lead to a larger O3 mortal-
ity burden (Malley et al., 2017). We account for all chronic
respiratory disease (RESP), to be consistent with Jerrett et
al. (2009). The counterfactual concentration of 37.6 ppbv
(Lim et al., 2012; Lelieveld et al., 2015) is used in our study,
to be comparable with Cohen et al. (2017). We use adults
above 25 years, to be comparable with other calculations of
PM2.5 mortality burden following Silva et al. (2016a, b), even
though the estimated RRs from Jerrett et al. (2009) were for
adults above 30 years old only. Uncertainties in air pollution-
related mortality burden calculations are based on the uncer-
tainty in RRs only, ignoring those in modeled air pollutant
concentrations, and population and baseline mortality rates,
which may be larger than that from the RRs but are not in the
scope of our study.
We use baseline mortality rates from each year to calculate
deaths from air pollution in each year, as changes in baseline
mortality rates from other socioeconomic determinants are
likely more important than changes in deaths from air pollu-
tion. To estimate the annual baseline mortality rates (y0) for
each disease associated with PM2.5 (chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, COPD; ischemic heart disease, IHD; lung
cancer, LC; cerebrovascular disease and ischemic stroke,
STROKE) and O3 (RESP), we acquire US county-level spe-
cifi
c causes of mortality data for each year from the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (CDC, 2017). We then
aggregate the county-level mortality data to each model grid
cell at 36 km × 36 km. The specifi
c causes of mortality data
for some counties are sometimes suppressed when the total
deaths are lower than 10 year−1 to protect privacy (Jian et
al., 2016), missing or considered “unreliable” when the total
deaths are less than 20 year−1, and are corrected following
established procedures (BenMAP, 2017; Fann et al., 2017;
also see the Supplement).
Defi
nitions of each disease follow the GBD study (Lim et
al., 2012; Table S1 in the Supplement). Note that the CDC
changed the disease codes from the International Classifi
-
cation of Diseases 9th Revision (ICD 9) in 1998 to ICD10
in 1999, and there were discontinuities in the death counts
of specifi
c diseases (Anderson et al., 2001; Anderson and
Rosenberg, 2003). To account for the discontinuities, we
group the total deaths for each of the fi
ve diseases for ICD9
and ICD10 using the results of Anderson et al. (2001) and
Anderson and Rosenberg (2003), who reported deaths for
135 specifi
c causes in 1996 for both the ICD9 and ICD10

codes, and calculate comparability ratios (Table S1). We then
recalculate comparability ratios for the fi
ve diseases (RESP,
COPD, IHD, LC and STROKE) as the ratios of deaths for
ICD9 and ICD10 (Table S2). Finally, we apply these ratios
to the ICD9 baseline mortality rates from 1990 to 1998.
Annual population in the US at county level was taken
from the US Bureau of Census, which reported popu-
lations associated with the 1990, 2000, and 2010 cen-
suses and estimated population for each year in between
(CDC 2017; https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/bridged_
race/Documentation_bridge_postcenv2017.pdf, last access:
5 September 2018). The adult population above 25 years in
the US has steadily grown between 1990 and 2010, with an
average 1.23 % year−1 rate of increase (Fig. S1 in the Sup-
plement).
2.3
The contribution of different factors to mortality
trends
The overall trends in PM2.5- and O3-related mortality be-
tween 1990 and 2010 are a combination of contributions
from trends in population, baseline mortality rates, and con-
centration. Here we separate the contributions of each fac-
tor by assuming that only a single factor was changing from
1990 to 2010, with the other two constant at 1990 levels. For
example, the mortality burden change associated with air pol-
lution changes in year y (�Morty
P), relative to 1990, is calcu-
lated following Eq. (4):
�Morty
P = y1990
0
× AFy × Pop1990 − y1990
0
× AF1990 × Pop1990.
(4)
Similarly, we also calculate the mortality burden change
without accounting for ambient air pollution changes
(�Morty
noP) following Eq. (5):
�Morty
noP = yy
0 × AF1990 × Popy − y1990
0
× AF1990 × Pop1990.

Air quality trends
From 1990 to 2010, annual average PM2.5 in the model de-
creases signifi
cantly in the eastern US (Fig. 1c), but slightly
decreases or even increases in the northwest, southwest
and west (Fig. S2 and Table S3; also see Fig. S3 for the
US 9 regions defi
ned by the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration, Zhang et al., 2016). The dramatic

decreasing trends of PM2.5 in the eastern US were also re-
ported in previous studies (Gan et al., 2015; Xing et al.,
2015) due to emission reductions. The increasing trend in
the western central area is due in part to frequent wild-
fi
res (Dennison et al., 2014; Hand et al., 2013, 2014; Jaffe
et al., 2008; Murphy et al., 2011; Spracklen et al., 2007).
In general, the decadal decreasing trends in the east are
larger than 2 µg m−3 decade−1 from 1990 to 2010, especially
in the central area (−3.48 µg m−3 decade−1) and northeast
(−3.14 µg m−3 decade−1). The summertime average of 1 h
daily maximum O3 decreases signifi
cantly in the central and
eastern US, generally at a rate greater than 4 ppbv decade−1.
It also decreases in the western US, but at a much smaller rate
than in the east, generally less than 1 ppbv decade−1 (Fig. 1f;
Table S3).
In Fig. 2, both the spatial average and population-
weighted average (PWA) annual PM2.5 exhibit smooth de-
creasing trends (Fig. 2, top): the spatial average of an-
nual PM2.5 has decreased by 29 %, from 9.07 µg m−3 in
1990 to 6.45 µg m−3 in 2010, with a decadal rate of de-
crease of 1.1 µg m−3 decade−1. The corresponding PWA
PM2.5 decreases by 39 %, from 17.61 µg m−3 in 1990 to
10.73 µg m−3 in 2010, with a decadal decreasing rate of
3.2 µg m−3 decade−1. Years with high PM2.5, such as in
1994, 1996, and 2000, are mainly caused by increases in
organic carbon due to large wildfi
res in the western US
(Spracklen et al., 2007). Both the spatial average and PWA
O3 also exhibit decreasing trends over the past 2 decades,
with greater inter-annual variability resulting from meteo-
rological variability (Porter et al., 2017). The spatial aver-
age O3 concentration decreases by 9 %, from 55.02 ppbv
in 1990 to 49.99 ppbv in 2010, decreasing at a rate of
2.4 ppbv decade−1. The PWA O3 also decreased by 9 %,
from 58.96 ppbv in 1990 to 53.57 ppbv in 2010, decreasing at
a rate of 3.0 ppbv decade−1. We also calculate the air quality
and mortality burden trends separately for two 11-year pe-
riods, 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2010, following Astitha et
al. (2017). Both PM2.5 and O3 decrease more strongly in the
second decade than in the fi
rst decade for both spatial aver-
age and PWA (Table S5), consistent with previous fi
ndings
(Astitha et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2015; Porter et al., 2017;
Xing et al., 2015).
We then calculate trends in the number of days annu-
ally that exceed the daily PM2.5 standard (35 µg m−3), and
the daily MDA8 O3 standard (70 ppbv) (Fig. S4). The ex-
ceedance days decrease for both PM2.5 and O3, especially in
the eastern US. In 2010, fewer than 5 days exceed the air
quality standard for the majority of the US (Fig. S4b, e).
We also calculate the population exposure exceedances by
multiplying the population (adults > 25 years old) by the
number of air quality exceedance days in each grid cell.
The PM2.5 population exposure exceedances have decreased
from 5340 million people-days in 1990 to 1042 million
people-days in 2010, and the O3 population exposure ex-
ceedances has decreased from 4691 million people-days in

Mortality burden trends and contributing factors
The mortality burdens associated with exposure to ambi-
ent PM2.5 in the US steadily decreased by 54 %, from
123 700 (95 % confi
dence interval considering the uncer-
tainty in relative risk only, 70 800–178 100) deaths year−1
in 1990 to 58 600 (24 900–98 500) deaths year−1 in 2010
(Fig. 3). The leading cause of PM2.5-related mortal-

(62 600–132 500) deaths year−1 in 1990 to 43 600 (21 500–
68 700) deaths year−1, followed by LC, which has decreased
by 44 %, from 12 500 (2500–21 000) deaths year−1 in 1990
to 7000 (900–13 400) deaths year−1 in 2010 (Table S4). The
PM2.5 mortality burden per 100 000 adults is much higher in
the east than the west for both 1990 and 2010 (Fig. 4), due to
the higher PM2.5 concentrations (Fig. 1).
Table 1 shows the mortality burdens for PM2.5 and O3 in
2010, and also the burden changes since 1990 from different
contributing factors. From the table, we see that the PM2.5-

related mortality burden in 2010 would have decreased by
only 24 % (94 400 deaths year−1 in 2010, 95 %CI, 50 300–
139 800) compared with that in 1990, if the PM2.5 con-
centrations had stayed constant over the period 1990–2010,
due to decreases in the baseline mortality rates for the spe-
cifi
c causes of death that PM2.5 influences (Fig. 3), espe-
cially IHD (Fig. 5), despite the population increase. There-
fore, the reduction in PM2.5 concentrations from 1990 to
2010 signifi
cantly accelerates the decrease in the mortality
burden. The decreased PM2.5 concentration avoided roughly
35 800 (38 %) PM2.5-related deaths in 2010, compared to
the case if current air quality stays at level in 1990 (esti-
mated as the 2010 mortality burden minus the “concentra-
tion change excluded” case in 2010). The benefi
t of the de-
creased PM2.5 concentration could also be estimated as the
“concentration change only” case in Fig. 3, yielding 78 900
(35 700–129 200) deaths year−1 in 2010, decreasing by 36 %
(−44800 deaths year−1) compared with 1990. The popula-
tion increases from 1991 to 2010 would lead to increases in
the PM2.5 mortality burden, but that increase is smaller than
the combined reduction from decreasing PM2.5 concentra-
tions and baseline mortality rates (Figs. S5 and S6).
When separating the two 11-year periods, the PM2.5-
related mortality burden decreased by 45 % from 2000
to 2010 (decreasing trend of −4400 deaths year−1), much
higher than the 15 % decrease from 1990 to 2000 (decreas-
ing trend of −2100 deaths year−1) (Table S5). The detrended
annual PM2.5-related mortality burden has a coeffi
cient of
variation (CV, standard deviation divided by the average) of
4 %, mainly caused by inter-annual variation in PM2.5 con-
centrations (Table S6 and Fig. S6).
We also calculate burdens and trends for each state
individually (Table 2). The three states with the high-
est PM2.5 mortality burden in 1990 are New York (NY,
13 700 deaths year−1), California (CA, 9500 deaths year−1)
and Pennsylvania (PA, 9200 deaths year−1); and in 2010, NY
(5100 deaths year−1), Texas (TX, 4200 deaths year−1) and
Ohio (OH, 3900 deaths year−1). NY has seen the largest ben-
efi
ts of mortality burden decreases (−8500 deaths year−1),
followed
by
CA
(−6100 deaths year−1)
and
PA
(−5500 deaths year−1). For the relative mortality burden
changes, generally large percent decreases in PM2.5-related
mortality are seen in western, northern, and northeastern
states (including Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Maine
and Vermont) (Fig. 6), because the PM2.5 concentrations in

threshold in these states (Fig. 1), as confi
rmed by the
mortality burden changes from concentration changes alone
(Table S7). For other states in the eastern US with large
relative mortality burden changes, the contributing factors
are different. For example, for Connecticut, the relative
mortality burden changes from the decrease in PM2.5
concentration are larger than that from the decrease in the
baseline mortality rates. However, for Massachusetts, NY
and PA, the decreases in baseline mortality rates have a
slightly larger effect than that from the decrease in PM2.5
concentration. For CA, the effects from the decrease in base-
line mortality rates and PM2.5 concentration are comparable
(Table S7).

den per 100 000 adults is highest in the midwest and south-

Y. Zhang et al.: Long-term trends in the ambient PM2.5- and O3-related mortality burdens
Figure 4. The mortality burdens associated with PM2.5 (a, b), O3 (d, e) in 1990 (a, c) and 2010 (b, d), and the differences (2010 minus
1990) (c, f) for each 36 km × 36 km grid cell. Units are deaths year−1 per 100 000 adults (above 25 years old).
would have avoided roughly 4600 (27 %) O3-related deaths
in 2010, compared to the case if ozone concentrations stay
at level in 1990 (estimated as the 2010 mortality burden mi-
nus the “concentration change excluded” case in 2010). The
benefi
t of the decreased O3 concentration could also be es-
timated as the “concentration change only” case in Fig. 3,
yielding 8100 (2700–13 100) deaths year−1 in 2010, decreas-
ing by 25 % (−2800 deaths year−1) compared with 1990.
The change in O3 generally reduces the mortality burden rel-
ative to 1990 with some inter-annual variation (Fig. S6) due
to meteorology and wildfi
res (Porter et al., 2017), while the
increases in population and baseline mortality rates generally
increase the mortality burden, with a larger contribution from
the population change (Fig. S6).
When
separating
the
O3
mortality
trends
into
2
decades,
we
fi
nd
that
the
burdens
decrease
slightly
(−70 deaths year−1) from 2000 to 2010, compared with the
increasing trend from 1990 to 2000 (240 deaths year−1) (Ta-
ble S5). The increasing trend in the fi
rst decade is caused
by the combined effect of increases in baseline mortality
rates and population, while the decreasing trend in the sec-
ond decade is dominated by decreases in O3 concentration
(Fig. S6). The inter-annual variability for the detrended an-
nual O3 mortality burden from 1990 to 2010 (CV of 12 %) is
larger than PM2.5 (CV of 4 %), caused mainly by variations
in O3 concentrations from 1990 to 2010 (Table S6).
The three states with the highest O3 mortality bur-
den in 1990 are CA (910 deaths year−1), Florida (FL,
740 deaths year−1) and NY (700 deaths year−1); and in
2010, CA (1270 deaths year−1), TX (900 deaths year−1)
and FL (770 deaths year−1) (Table 2). CA has seen the
largest O3 mortality burden increases (360 deaths year−1),
followed by TX (230 deaths year−1) and Arizona (AZ,
140 deaths year−1), with the greatest decrease in NY
(−90 deaths year−1). For the relative mortality burden
changes, large percent decreases in O3-related mortality
are seen in the northwestern (Washington and Oregon) and
northeastern US (Fig. 6), mainly caused by signifi
cant O3 de-
creases (Table S7), while the greatest percent increases occur
in the southwestern US driven mainly by large population in-
creases, and also the baseline mortality rate increases.
Previous health impact assessments have used national
baseline mortality rates (Cohen et al., 2017; Silva et al.,
2016a, b, etc.), but baseline mortality rates can vary strongly
within individual counties (Fig. 5; Dwyer-Lindgren et al.,
2016). We performed sensitivity analyses by applying the
national average baseline mortality rates for each disease to
every county in the mortality burden calculations. We fi
nd
that the PM2.5 mortality burden calculated from the national
average baseline mortality rates is lower than those calcu-
lated from the county-level baseline mortality rates, ranging
among individual years from −2.2 % to −1.3 % (Table S8).
For the O3 mortality burden, the differences between using
the national average baseline mortality rates and our best es-
timates range from −1.1 % to 2.0 % (Table S8). However, us-
ing the national average baseline mortality rates fails to cap-
ture regional mortality burden hotspots for both PM2.5 and

Comparison with previous studies
The mortality burden associated with PM2.5 calculated in
our study generally aligns with several previous fi
ndings
(Fig. 7; also Table S9). Our PM2.5 mortality burden is higher
than that reported by Cohen et al. (2017) in 1990 (17 %
higher) and 1995 (4 % higher), and lower in 2000 (−0.5 %),
2005 (−17 %) and 2010 (−30 %) (Fig. 7). The overesti-
mation of PM2.5 mortality burdens in the early 2000s are
likely due to the higher population-weighted PM2.5 con-
centration simulated by WRF-CMAQ (Fig. 2), compared
with Cohen et al. (2017), in which they estimated the
PM2.5 concentration based on data fusion of air quality
model outputs, satellite retrievals and ground observations.
The lower mortality burdens in the second decade (from
2000 to 2010) in our study likely reflect that Cohen et
al. (2017) included hemorrhagic stroke and lower respira-
tory infections in the PM2.5-related mortality burden, in ad-
dition to COPD, LC, IHD and STROKE, and used an up-
dated integrated exposure–response function. While the ab-
solute value is similar, our results show a stronger decreas-
ing trend (−3000 deaths year−1) than Cohen et al. (2017)
(−1000 deaths year−1), which may result from the overesti-
mation of PM2.5 decreasing trends in our model relative to
ground observations (Gan et al., 2016). The PM2.5 mortal-
ity burdens estimated in our study are much lower than those
from Fann et al. (2017), but the temporal patterns are sim-
ilar, mainly because Fann et al. (2017) estimated the total
all-cause mortality with a different HIF.
To compare with Cohen et al. (2017), who reported the O3
mortality burden from the COPD, which is a subset of RESP,
we recalculate the O3 mortality burden from the COPD (Ta-
ble S4). The newly calculated O3 mortality burden from
the COPD is generally lower than the estimate of Cohen et
al. (2017) by 8 %–30 % (Fig. 7). This could be caused by the
fact that for the O3 changes, we use the summertime (April
to September) average of the 1 h daily maximum, while Co-
hen et al. (2017) used the 3-month average, which will be
higher. The temporal trend for the O3 mortality burdens from
our study is similar to that from Cohen et al. (2017), ex-
cept that the burden decreases after 2005 in our study but in-
creases in Cohen et al. (2017). The O3 mortality burden from
the RESP disease in 2005 estimated from our study is much
lower than two previous studies (Fann et al., 2012a; Punger
and West, 2013; Table S10). As discussed in the methods,
the lower US background O3 concentration used in these two
studies (22 ppb in the eastern US and 30 ppb in the western
US) could lead to a higher O3 mortality burden. We then did
sensitivity analysis by using the pre-industrial O3 concen-
tration simulated by an ensemble of model outputs from the
Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison
Project (Lamarque et al., 2013; see Fig. S9 and Sect. 2 in the
Supplement) as the counterfactual risk exposure factor, and
recalculated the O3 mortality burden with RESP. The new
calculated O3 mortality burdens are estimated to be 64 %–
100 % higher than the current estimation from RESP using
the low-concentration threshold (Table S10). In Fig. 7, we
see that the new estimated O3 mortality burden from RESP
in 2005 (dashed line) is now comparable with the two previ-
ous studies.

Conclusions
Signifi
cant improvements in air quality occurred in the US
from 1990 to 2010, which we estimate to have decreased the
population-weighted annual average PM2.5 by 39 %, and the
summertime (April to September) 1 h daily maximum O3 by
9 %. However, both PM2.5 and O3 are still a great threat to
the public health in the US, with estimated mortality burdens
of 58 600 (24 900–98 500) deaths year−1 and 12 300 (4100–
19 800) deaths year−1 in 2010, respectively. The mortality
burdens associated with exposure to ambient PM2.5 have de-
creased by 54 % over the past 2 decades. However, if the an-
nual PM2.5 concentration levels had remained constant dur-
ing 1990–2010, the associated mortality burden would have
only decreased by 24 %, due to decreases in the baseline mor-
tality rates of causes of death affected by PM2.5 and despite
population growth. The air quality improvements have sig-
nifi
cantly decreased the mortality burden, avoiding roughly
35 800 (38 %) PM2.5-related deaths in 2010, compared to the
case if air quality had stayed at 1990 levels.
The mortality burdens attributable to O3 are estimated to
have increased by 13 % during the same period. However,
without the emission reductions associated with implemen-
tation of measures under the CAA and the NOx SIP Call, the
O3 mortality burden would have increased by 55 % during
1990–2010. In calculating the O3 mortality burdens, we use
the average of 1 h daily maximum O3 and the RR from Jerrett
et al. (2009), but higher O3 mortality burdens would likely
have resulted had we used RRs from Turner et al. (2016).
We estimate that the air quality improvements avoided 4600
(27 %) O3-related deaths in 2010, compared to the case if air
quality had stayed at 1990 levels.
We also estimate the inter-annual variability in mortality
burdens considering air pollutant concentrations in individ-
ual years and annual county-level baseline mortality rates,
and fi
nd that the O3 mortality burdens are more variable (CV
of 12 %) than for PM2.5 (CV of 4 %), mainly because of inter-
annual variability in concentrations. We found that the inter-
annual variability is small for PM2.5 but larger for ozone,
which has not been shown previously that we are aware of.
The uncertainties in air pollution-related mortality esti-
mates presented in this study are based on the uncertainty
in relative risks for the specifi
c causes of death only, and
do not account for uncertainties in population and baseline
mortality rates (which are likely small), nor for uncertainty
in the modeled air pollutant concentration. Previous stud-
ies have shown that the uncertainties from the modeled air

pollutant concentrations may be greater than uncertainties in
baseline mortality or relative risk, so the use of model en-
sembles is suggested to better quantify the uncertainty (Silva
et al., 2016a; Liang et al., 2018). Uncertainties also exist due
to the assumption of equal toxicity for different components
of PM2.5 (Li et al., 2016). For our analysis, we use modeled
air pollutant concentration without any bias correction based
on either in situ observation or satellite data (Brauer et al.,
2015; Hogrefe et al., 2009; van Donkelaar et al., 2015; Xu
et al., 2016). In our study, the PM2.5 mortality burden trend
may be overestimated, and O3 mortality burdens underesti-
mated, based on comparing the modeled air pollution trends
with the observations. Despite these uncertainties, this study
illustrates the importance of past air pollutant reductions for
public health in the US, and of continued air pollution con-
trols to reduce air pollution-related mortality.
