Abstract
Background
Attention to women’s and girls’ menstrual needs is critical for global health and gender
equality. The importance of this neglected experience has been elucidated by a growing
body of qualitative research, which we systematically reviewed and synthesised.
Methods and findings
We undertook systematic searching to identify qualitative studies of women’s and girls’
experiences of menstruation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Of 6,892 cita-
tions screened, 76 studies reported in 87 citations were included. Studies captured the
experiences of over 6,000 participants from 35 countries. This included 45 studies from sub-
Saharan Africa (with the greatest number of studies from Kenya [n = 7], Uganda [n = 6], and
Ethiopia [n = 5]), 21 from South Asia (including India [n = 12] and Nepal [n = 5]), 8 from East
Asia and the Pacific, 5 from Latin America and the Caribbean, 5 from the Middle East and
North Africa, and 1 study from Europe and Central Asia. Through synthesis, we identified
overarching themes and their relationships to develop a directional model of menstrual
experience. This model maps distal and proximal antecedents of menstrual experience
through to the impacts of this experience on health and well-being. The sociocultural con-
text, including menstrual stigma and gender norms, influenced experiences by limiting
knowledge about menstruation, limiting social support, and shaping internalised and exter-
nally enforced behavioural expectations. Resource limitations underlay inadequate physical
infrastructure to support menstruation, as well as an economic environment restricting
access to affordable menstrual materials. Menstrual experience included multiple themes:
menstrual practices, perceptions of practices and environments, confidence, shame and
distress, and containment of bleeding and odour. These components of experience were

author had full access to all the data in the study
and had final responsibility for the decision to
submit for publication. The funders of the study
 interlinked and contributed to negative impacts on women’s and girls’ lives. Impacts
included harms to physical and psychological health as well as education and social
engagement. Our review is limited by the available studies. Study quality was varied, with
18 studies rated as high, 35 medium, and 23 low trustworthiness. Sampling and analysis
tended to be untrustworthy in lower-quality studies. Studies focused on the experiences of
adolescent girls were most strongly represented, and we achieved early saturation for this
group. Reflecting the focus of menstrual health research globally, there was an absence of
studies focused on adult women and those from certain geographical areas.
Conclusions
Through synthesis of extant qualitative studies of menstrual experience, we highlight consis-
tent challenges and developed an integrated model of menstrual experience. This model
hypothesises directional pathways that could be tested by future studies and may serve as a
framework for program and policy development by highlighting critical antecedents and
pathways through which interventions could improve women’s and girls’ health and well-
being.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• A growing body of qualitative research has highlighted the importance of menstrual
experiences for the health and well-being of women and girls in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs).
• Qualitative research has identified an array of factors contributing to experiences but
has not developed clear theory to direct intervention and evaluation.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We systematically searched and critically appraised the body of qualitative studies of
menstrual experience in LMICs.
• We identified overarching themes and mapped the relationships between them to
develop a directional model of menstrual experience.
• Women and girls reported impacts of negative menstrual experiences on physical and
psychological health, education, employment, and social participation.
• Both resource limitations and the sociocultural context contribute to menstrual
experience.

 What do these findings mean?
• Women’s and girls’ menstrual experiences are complex and multifaceted, but across
LMICs, consistent factors contribute to experiences.
• Findings advance the development of problem theory in menstrual health, and the
developed model can be used as a framework for developing interventions and
evaluation.
• Future interventions should seek to address identified antecedents of menstrual experi-
ence, including knowledge, social support, restrictive behavioural expectations, and the
physical and economic environment.
Introduction
Each day, more than 300 million women are menstruating [1]. There is increasing recognition
that this natural process is experienced negatively and presents a barrier to health and gender
equality in low- and middle-income contexts [2]. A growing body of qualitative research has
been critical to highlighting this issue. Early studies focused on adolescent girls reported that
menstruation was experienced with discomfort and fear [3–5]. Access to clean, reliable materi-
als to absorb menses, supportive sanitation infrastructure, and biological and pragmatic infor-
mation about menstruation were highlighted as core challenges [6, 7]. Studies suggested that
these challenges negatively impacted school participation [4, 8, 9], health, and well-being [10,
11, 12, 13]. Fewer studies of adult women have highlighted that they too lack resources and
support [14, 15], which may contribute to stress and absence from employment [16, 17].
In response to growing advocacy, programs and policies seeking to address menstrual
needs have emerged rapidly. Development of these interventions has drawn largely on qualita-
tive literature, with limited high-quality quantitative research and controlled trials available
[18, 19]. However, this use of qualitative evidence has been anecdotal and situated, drawing on
individual studies that may be restricted in scope and have limited generalizability beyond
their context. Thus, the first objective of this review was to undertake a systematic search and
synthesis of extant qualitative studies to draw out common themes, as well as appraise the cov-
erage and quality of existing research.
The second objective of this review was to draw on the rich body of qualitative evidence to
advance understanding of menstrual health. Program-orientated scoping research has often
identified lists of factors important for menstrual experience, alongside lists of consequences
for health and education. However, pathways between the variety of contributors and their
impacts remain poorly understood [20]. Menstrual health research has tended to draw on pro-
grammatic models rather than detailed problem theory. One common model includes a Venn
diagram with three circles: knowledge, menstrual products, and sanitation (e.g., [21, 22]). This
may also include cultural norms and social factors as a broad concept surrounding the three
core circles. These Venn models provide an intuitive high-level picture and pillars to inform
programming. However, they do not provide a detailed problem theory, mapping relation-
ships and aetiological pathways to hypothesised impacts on health and education. For example,
we would expect different causal pathways contributing to reproductive tract infections than
to mental health. The need for detailed problem theory becomes more salient when, in

 responding to the many challenges for women and girls, actors develop increasingly complex,
multicomponent interventions, with many desired outcomes.
A lack of clarity around core concepts, or terminologies, in menstrual research has further
complicated the development of problem theory. Early efforts were united around ‘menstrual
hygiene’. This was defined as ‘women and adolescent girls using a clean menstrual manage-
ment material to absorb or collect blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary
for the duration of the menstruation period, using soap and water for washing the body as
required, and having access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials’
[6], providing a target for improving the effective and hygienic management of menses. How-
ever, because this definition does not include other menstrual needs highlighted by qualitative
studies, more recent versions have expanded the definition, adding that ‘[women and adoles-
cent girls] understand the basic facts linked to the menstrual cycle and how to manage it with
dignity and without discomfort or fear’ [23]. Dissatisfied with the coverage and physical focus
of ‘menstrual hygiene’, more recent efforts have discussed ‘menstrual health’, suggested as ‘an
encompassing term that includes both menstrual hygiene management (MHM) as well as the
broader systemic factors that link menstruation with health, well-being, gender, education,
equity, empowerment, and rights’ [21]. This term may be useful to describe a broad field of
research and practice and facilitates the consideration of menstrual disorders (e.g., dysmenor-
rhea, endometriosis). However, although the use of ‘menstrual health’ or expansions to ‘men-
strual hygiene’ may be beneficial for more comprehensive advocacy, neither addresses the
underlying lack of unified problem theory. Thus, through an interpretive approach in this
review, we seek to evolve problem theory and concept definitions by providing a more
nuanced model and iteratively identifying aspects of menstrual experience.
In sum, this systematic review and metasynthesis had 2 overarching objectives: (1) synthe-
sise and appraise the extant qualitative research on women’s and girls’ menstrual experiences
and (2) interpret findings across studies to develop an integrated model of menstrual experi-
ence mapping relationships between contributing factors (antecedents), menstrual experience,
and the consequences of poor experiences for health and well-being (impacts).
Methods
The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO: CRD42018089581 and is reported according
to PRISMA guidance (S1 PRISMA Checklist).
Search strategy and selection criteria
The search strategy was designed to capture studies reporting on women’s and girls’ experi-
ences of menstruation. Searches were undertaken in 11 databases (Applied Social Science
Index and Abstracts, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ProQuest
Dissertation and Theses, Embase, Global Health, Medline, Open Grey, Popline, PsycINFO,
Sociological Abstracts, WHO Global Health Library) using a prespecified, piloted strategy
reported in Table 1. Searches were completed in January 2019 with no language of publication
or date restrictions applied. Comprehensive grey literature searching and hand searching were
undertaken. Organisations attending to menstrual health were identified through participation
in reports [7, 21], stakeholder meetings [2], and online searches. Websites (see list in S1 Text)
were searched using relevant terms (e.g., ‘menstrual’, ‘menstruation’). Citations of included
studies and reference lists of large menstrual health reports were searched [7, 21]. Results were
exported into EPPI-Reviewer 4 (EPPI-Centre; https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=
2914). Two authors (JH, AS) independently screened titles and abstracts, followed by full-text
screening to determine eligibility (JH).

 Studies were eligible if they reported qualitative analysis of the menstrual experiences of
women and girls residing in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) as defined by the
World Bank [24]. Studies that included women from LMICs now residing in high-income
countries, or that combined populations from LMICs with those in high-income settings, were
excluded. While these experiences also deserve increased attention, this review sought to
synthesise the large set of studies situated in LMICs to inform evolving policy and practice in
these regions. Studies exclusively concerning the acceptability of menstrual suppression were
excluded. Studies focussed on puberty more broadly, or the use of sanitation infrastructure,
were only included when they reported on experiences of menstruation. For example, studies
that included lists of puberty education needs that referenced menstruation but did not report
on women’s or girls’ lived menstrual experiences were not included. Similarly, studies focussed
on menopause, premenstrual syndrome, or polycystic ovary syndrome were not eligible for
inclusion. Studies capturing the menstrual experiences of populations with menstrual disor-
ders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, endometriosis) were eligible. Menstruating women and girls were
the target population; thus, studies were excluded if they focused exclusively on girls’ preme-
narche, key informants, or males. Where key informant interviews were analysed alongside
women’s and girls’ experiences, studies were included, but analysis focused on the experience
of the target population. Qualitative and mixed-methods studies reported in peer-reviewed or
grey literature were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they did not report any
qualitative analysis or results (e.g., qualitative responses were back-coded for quantitative
description).
Following full-text screening, study research questions were extracted and iteratively
grouped. Three groupings emerged: studies broadly focused on menstrual experiences, studies
of experiences of menstruation for those with dysmenorrhea or disorders, and studies of expe-
riences of menstrual interventions or products. Because the review aimed to provide a synthe-
sis of menstrual experience and advance problem theory rather than explore the role of
interventions, the third grouping was excluded from the present review but was retained for
analyses reported elsewhere.
Study quality appraisal
Included studies were appraised using the EPPI-Centre checklist [25]. This checklist assesses
methodological quality across recommended domains: sampling, data collection, analysis,
interpretation, and privileging of participant perspectives (see S1 Table) [26, 27]. The checklist
also facilitates generation of overall trustworthiness taking into account the first 4 ratings

 (sampling, data collection, analysis, and support for interpretation), as well as relevance to the
review (relevance to the review question, privileging and involvement of participant perspec-
tives), rated as low, medium or high. One author (JH) appraised the quality of all studies; 10%
were independently appraised by a second author (GJMT), with 100% agreement.
Analysis
Reflecting the research questions, we employed a thematic synthesis approach [28], or an
approach that seeks to describe themes as recurrent ‘units of meaning’ within and across stud-
ies, to synthesise insights from individual studies [29, 30]. We then used these themes to gener-
ate thematic networks to facilitate repeated comparison of the relationships between these
themes. The use of thematic networks was appropriate as it includes (a) the explicit step of
evidencing themes against specific statements and quotes from included studies and (b) the
development of relationships between themes to form a network. The use of thematic net-
works reflected a lines-of-argument approach to meta-ethnography [31]; that is, drawing on
the synthesis of qualitative research (meta-ethnography), we sought to go beyond merely
describing a phenomenon to interpreting and understanding the social processes underlying it
as part of an integrated scheme, such that no one study captures the entirety of the phenome-
non (lines of argument).
Analysis was undertaken in 4 steps:
1. The findings of high- and medium-quality studies were thematically coded using NVivo 12
(QSR International; https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/nvivo-products) by the first
author. Throughout initial coding, multiple mappings of the relationships between themes
were generated. Representative quotations and core sections of text corresponding to each
theme were recorded for each included study.
2. Emergent themes were discussed among the authorship team, and multiple mappings of
the relationships between themes were generated until authors reached consensus on a
representation with the greatest explanatory power.
3. Findings of low-quality studies were assessed for their fit with the proposed themes and
integrated model. Low-quality studies supported the primary analysis, and no new con-
structs emerged. This is akin to the ‘sensitivity analysis’ common in systematic reviews of
qualitative research, in which themes are checked to see if they rely on low-quality studies
alone [30].
4. Using Nvivo 12, all studies were recoded against the consensus themes and integrated
model for validation.
Results
The review flowchart is presented in Fig 1.
Study characteristics, quality, and relevance are presented in Table 2. Included studies cap-
tured experiences from 35 countries and over 6,000 participants. India was the country with
the highest number of studies (n = 12), followed by Kenya (n = 7) and Uganda (n = 6).
Using World Bank regional groupings [24], most studies were conducted in sub-Saharan
Africa (n = 45); this was followed by 21 studies undertaken in South Asia, 8 in East Asia and
the Pacific, 5 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 5 in the Middle East and North Africa, and
1 study from Europe and Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan).
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were the most common data collection method used,
particularly when working with adolescent girls. Eleven studies reported using participatory

 activities such as asking groups to design an ‘ideal latrine’, or rank priorities for improvements
to explore experiences and preferences. A total of 55 studies included adolescent girls (school
aged), with only 21 studies including exclusively university students or adult women. Most
studies reported undertaking a thematic approach to analysis.
Overall study quality and relevance ratings are reported in Table 2. Classifications accord-
ing to each item in the EPPI-Centre checklist, along with justifications, are displayed in S1
Table. Most studies were situated within a public health discipline and focused on cataloguing
antecedents and impacts of menstruation on participants’ lives, rather than sociological

 analysis. Study quality was varied, with 18 studies rated as high, 35 as medium, and 23 as low
trustworthiness. Lower-quality studies were characterised by poor reporting of participant
selection and analysis, with many having no defined or described analytic approach. After ini-
tial analysis of high- and medium-quality studies, analysis and integration of lower-quality
studies did not elicit any new themes nor changes to the integrated model.
Developing an integrated model of menstrual experience
Fig 2 presents an integrated model of menstrual experience. The figure summarises the themes
and subthemes identified through analysis and the relationships between them. Studies varied
in their coverage of included themes, with none reflecting the full picture gained through
metasynthesis.
Author orientations
In identifying themes and mapping the relationships between themes as part of our analysis,
differences in author orientations across the body of literature were apparent. We found that
studies varied along a continuum in the extent to which they approached menstrual experi-
ences as a result of the sociocultural context, particularly menstrual stigma, or focused on
resource deficits in the environment. These orientations influenced the focus of studies, topics
covered, and author interpretation of the relationships between antecedents, experience, and
impacts.
Studies with a more stigma-centric orientation conceptualised menstrual experiences and
negative outcomes as resulting from the stigmatised and gendered nature of menstruation.
These studies were often those using individual interviews or engaging adult women to pro-
vide reflexive insights into their experiences. Themes centred around the pressure to suppress

 evidence of menses and control the body. Studies focused on stigma, knowledge, and social
support as antecedents of experience. Where resource limitations were discussed in these stud-
ies, they were considered problematic because they failed to support socially proscribed discre-
tion. Menstrual experiences were characterised by shame and a lack of confidence to engage
socially when menstruating. Stigma-centric models of menstruation rarely elaborated on phys-
ical health consequences; rather, they detailed psychological and educational concerns and
consequences for empowerment. Others did not address the impacts of menstruation on such
outcomes, exploring only the experience itself.
Other studies were orientated towards poverty and resource limitations as causes of men-
strual experiences and impacts. These studies viewed the resources available to women and
girls as inadequate to meet their basic biological needs. This included an emphasis on men-
strual hygiene practices such as the use of materials poorly suited to absorbing menses. Knowl-
edge and cultural practices were important in resource-centric studies but were more often
linked with a failure to support effective management practices. Menstrual hygiene, the
hygienic and effective management of menstrual blood, lay at the centre of experience in these
studies, which frequently noted concerns around infection and consequences for school
attendance.
Our final integrated model synthesised studies along this continuum. As displayed in Fig 2,
the model views resource limitations and the sociocultural context, including menstrual
stigma, as determinants of menstrual experience and negative impacts. Themes are described
from this perspective.
Table 3 summarises the individual studies contributing to each theme according to their
level of trustworthiness.

 Antecedents of menstrual experience
Sociocultural context.
Across cultures, menstruation was stigmatised, constructed as
something that was ‘dirty’ or ‘impure’ and shrouded in silence. Menstrual stigma was a perva-
sive influence on women and girls. It meant that menstrual topics were not openly discussed,
making it difficult to access accurate information or seek support. Negative attitudes to men-
struation were internalised and manifested across multiple themes represented in the model,
including as self-imposed expectations to keep menstrual status hidden, and shame and dis-
tress at the potential of having menses exposed.
Restrictive gender norms also underlay the knowledge, behavioural expectations, and social
support that influenced experiences of menstruation. Expectations of female propriety and
the roles of women and girls over the life course as daughters, wives, and mothers restricted
resource access and proscribed care-giving tasks and movement outside the home, interacting
with more immediate contributors to menstrual experience.
Proximal antecedents of menstrual experience of knowledge, social support, and beha-
vioural expectations are described below, with supporting quotations presented in Box 1 and
contributing citations highlighted in Table 3.
Knowledge.
All studies reported an influence of knowledge about menstruation on wom-
en’s and girls’ experiences. Multiple domains of knowledge were discussed across studies,
including the basic biology of menstruation, reproduction and the links between menstruation

 Box 1. Illustrative quotations for proximal sociocultural antecedents of
menstrual experience
Knowledge
‘I was so scared actually I thought it was a disease that had attacked me. I thought I was
going to lose my life at any moment because it was really scary to start bleeding from
down there. I thought I was going to die’ (participant; Miiro 2018) [70].
‘My mother told me I would die if I showed anybody the blood’ (participant; Pillitteri
2011) [79].
‘When I first started menstruating I was shocked because I had not learned about it
before. . .I was too embarrassed to tell my parents because I knew that they would not
accept me and would say that I had bad behaviour. I could not tell them because they
would say that I shamed the family and would shout at me’ (participant; Sommer 2015)
[88].
‘Some people say witches can harm you if they come across (your) menstrual blood-
. . .you have prolonged periods or other complications. . .they can make you sterile’ (par-
ticipant; Lahme 2016) [68].
Girl 1: ‘[The teacher says] you stop playing with boys on your period’. Girl 2: ‘On your
period, you can get pregnant’ (participant; FGD, School 3, Private).
‘When someone is continuing with the period and is raped is there any chance to get
pregnant?’ (participant; School 4, Public School) (Girod 2017) [58].
‘A few girls had received quite a lot of information from family members before they
began menstruating, and they felt very confident in seeking help and managing menar-
che: “Both of my sisters had menstruation before than me that is why it was not diffi-
cult”‘ (Morrison 2016) [72].
‘Then my grandmother gave me one of my mother’s pads; she wasn’t able to teach me
how to use it because when she was a girl she used rags only. I put the adhesive side [of
the pad] on my body, instead of on my panties. I had climbed a tree with my brothers
and [when I saw that blood] I thought I had hurt myself on a branch. Then, I applied
alcohol [on my genitals] and I jumped!’ (participant; do Amaral, 2011) [55].
Social support
‘I worry who to tell because there are some mothers who when told about periods don’t
care and you are forced to go and tell someone else about it to assist you [with sanitary
pads]’ (participant; Crichton 2013) [10].
‘When asked about current sources of information and support on menstruation, partic-
ipants said that they preferred to approach a female relative or close friend rather than a
health worker. Nurses were described as “too busy” to address women’s concerns, diffi-
cult to talk to, and likely to provide only superficial and inadequate explanations”‘ (Scor-
gie 2016) [84].
‘In some schools, when girls go to the nurses to complain, the nurses will just tell them it
is not a disease and that they should go back to their work or their school. . .’ (teacher;
Sommer 2009) [88].

 ‘[I talk to] friends, [and] they help to explain about how to use sanitary pad properly,
product of hygiene, and give sanitary pad because they understand about the issue and
consider me their best friend’ (participant; Daniels 2016) [51].
‘Girls and teachers said that boys regularly harass girls. Girls in one focus group
described multiple occasions in which boys knew that a girl had a blood stain on her uni-
form; the boys found ways to make the girl stand up to expose the stain’ (Girod 2017)
[58].
‘You know, especially the male teachers, I don’t think they understand that when you
mess yourself up it is by accident’ (participant; Lahme 2016) [68, 69].
‘The teacher had taught and told us, in the gender clubs, to use sanitary napkins. How-
ever, since male students follow us while we change menstrual soak up [absorbent] in
school and teased at us, we didn’t use sanitary napkins’ (FGD participant; Tegegne 2014)
[93].
‘I wore a traditional dress and my aunts sat down in a circle with me and explained to
me that now I am of age and that they loved me and now I was a woman. I felt very privi-
leged, I felt connected to them’ (participant; Padmanabhanunni 2017) [78].
Behavioural expectations
‘You lose some of your old friends . . . you should not play or mix with girls who have
not started menstruating. You are not allowed to wear short dresses, skirts, or trousers’
(participant; Lahme 2016) [69].
‘[My] father plays with me when I have not experienced menstruation, but when I expe-
rience, he does not allow me to follow him’ (participant; Daniels 2016) [51].
‘During menstruation we do not have sex. If a man even touches a menstruating women
he becomes ritually impure. Since both the partners are releasing heat from their bodies,
if they mix, it will harm the body’ (participant; Garg 2001) [14].
‘I have heard from nearly everyone; teacher, mother, aunt and grandmother, that during
my period, I should not eat cold foods, foods that produce gas, pickles, yogurt and milk
because they cause stomach-ache. But I have not experienced it because I have not eaten
them. In other words, I have always observed these suggestions. Well [smiling], if my
mother sees me eat these things during my period, she will quarrel with me’ (participant;
Morowatisharifabad 2018) [71].
‘Girls were instructed not to conduct sacred acts including praying, fasting, or touching
holy books such as the Quran during menstruation. According to widely-accepted inter-
pretations of hadith and other scholarly writings in Islam, menstruating girls and
women are “ritually impure” due to the presence of blood. Girls may resume sacred acts
after menstruation ends, following a ritual full-body cleansing (ghusl)’ (Nechitilo 2016)
[77].
‘As one participant commented, “In my church, what they believe is that when a woman
is on her periods she is dirty and you can’t come to church dirty”. Participants experi-
enced these restrictions as “unfair” but feared that they would be offending their reli-
gious leaders and family if they did not adhere to these practices’ (Padmanabhanunni
2017) [78].

 and pregnancy, practical management of menses and pain, and interpreting the accuracy of
local taboos around menstruation.
Many authors stated that most of their study population had deficits in knowledge of men-
strual biology [37, 44, 47, 55, 57, 68, 69, 71, 73, 77, 83], with some noting that only healthcare
providers and biology teachers had a comprehensive understanding [95, 100]. In some studies,
knowledge was more varied, with those who had attended secondary education or schools
with more comprehensive reproductive health education having adequate knowledge [62–64,
83]. Knowledge deficits varied in content. In some studies, younger girls were unaware of their
reproductive organs and that menstrual bleeding originated from this system, rather than else-
where such as the digestive tract [9, 41]. In others, girls’ post menarche and older women
linked menstruation with reproduction but had other lingering questions such as why men-
strual bleeding occurred [11, 15, 44, 72, 73] or whether it was needed to rid the body of ‘dirty
blood’ [10, 14, 34, 71, 72, 77, 84]. Near universally across studies, women and girls recalled
experiences of intense distress and confusion if they were unaware of menstruation at menar-
che, with many participants reporting they thought they were sick or dying. In contrast, girls
who had received information before menarche described more positive experiences. Where
investigated, women and girls also lacked clarity on what constituted normal and abnormal
(i.e., disordered) menstruation [47, 73, 85, 105, 109].
Even when aware of menstruation, participants often had insufficient information to
understand the relationship between menstruation and reproduction. At menarche, many
girls were told they were now fertile and to avoid males; however, this information was often
provided without clarifying how or when girls were vulnerable to pregnancy [9, 32, 41, 58, 59,
64, 77, 84, 88]. Beliefs that menarche indicated sexual initiation prompted girls to hide their
status for fear of punishment, reported in studies from Ethiopia [89, 100], Ghana [88], and
Mali [95].
Girls expressed a strong desire for more practical information, including managing menses
or pain relief [3, 8, 41, 57, 72, 73, 83, 88, 89, 93, 95, 103]. Practical knowledge about menstrua-
tion influenced the practices undertaken as well as individuals’ perceptions of their practices,
with a lack of clarity around what was required for ‘hygiene’ causing concern.
Deficits in knowledge created confusion around the accuracy of cultural restrictions and
taboos, creating distress and impacting confidence. Girls in many studies sought clarity on the
accuracy of taboos such as appropriate foods or practices during menstruation. Several studies
noted distress resulting from conflicting advice from different sources (e.g., parents, teachers,
nongovernmental organisations [NGOs]) [3, 9, 44, 71, 73].
‘If the boy sees it, he will tell the family that you are having your menses, so if you pre-
pare food he will not eat it’ (participant; Pillitteri 2011) [79].
‘If we wash at day time, there would be people moving around. . . people will look at us
and will say that girl has no brains. . . we need a place where if we wash the cloth no one
can see’ (participant; Caruso 2017) [16].
‘These fears also led to SSGs [Senior School Girls] practicing a secretive “don’t tell” pol-
icy about menstruation, particularly towards boys and male teachers out of fear of shar-
ing something “improper”‘ (Rheinlander 2018) [81].

 Social support. Social support, or lack thereof, strongly dictated menstrual experiences.
Parents, siblings, peers, partners, and teachers were sources of information, resources, com-
fort, or assistance to accomplish menstrual tasks. Manifestation of mother–daughter commu-
nication was context dependent. In many settings, mothers served as the primary support and
source of information for girls, whereas in others such as Ghana [4], Malawi [79], South Africa
[84], and Tanzania [3], they were sometimes considered culturally inappropriate, and other
female relatives such as aunts or grandmothers were expected to serve in this role. However,
individuals’ access to support sources often varied more according to personal circumstances
than country. Partners’ perceptions of menses contributed to women’s self-conceptualisation,
resource availability, and the impact of menses on daily activities.
Friends and peers were critical: in school settings, they checked for stains, accompanied
others to changing facilities, or provided emergency supplies. Teasing or harassment by
female, but especially male, peers was highly distressing for adolescent girls. They reported
great distress at males being aware of their menstrual status and bullying behaviours such as
males teasing them if their status was revealed.
Healthcare providers such as nurses or community health workers were mentioned in only
a few studies, and always as unsupportive [3, 84, 87, 101, 103, 109]. In studies of those with dys-
menorrhea or menstrual disorders, some participants were embarrassed to seek help. Others
reported pursuing multiple avenues such as doctors and herbalists or community healers in
attempts to receive effective treatment for their pain [103–105, 109].
Teachers provided mixed support to girls during menstruation. Some were sensitive to
girls’ needs and provided information or support such as emergency supplies, while others
were uncomfortable or punitive if girls soiled themselves at school. Girls often felt more com-
fortable with female teachers than male teachers, who were viewed as less understanding and
presented threats of sexual advances.
Behavioural expectations.
Across studies, menstrual experience was impacted by inter-
nally and externally enforced behavioural expectations, i.e., expectations women and girls
placed on themselves or those enforced by others.
Externally enforced behavioural expectations included explicit cultural or religious expecta-
tions of menstruating women as well as more implicit ideals of propriety and cleanliness
placed on menstruating bodies. Explicit cultural restrictions varied across and within countries
according to region, religion, caste, and individual family expectations. So too did the extent to
which such restrictions directly impacted women’s and girls’ social participation. In the most
severe cases, subpopulations in Nepal practiced Chhaupadi, ritual seclusion from the commu-
nity and home during menstruation [36, 101]. In Zambia, Lahme and colleagues reported that
participants experienced a single instance of seclusion during their first period that many girls
found embarrassing and distressing [68]. In many settings, menstrual blood—and by exten-
sion, menstruating women—were considered ritually impure or polluting [10, 14, 16, 34, 37,
41, 43, 47, 60, 62–64, 68, 72, 77, 100, 101]. Such beliefs translated into restrictions on women’s
behaviour, including not interacting or sitting with males; touching or cooking food; having
contact with crops, livestock, or farming; or having sex. Adolescent girls reported distress at
these changes to expected behaviour and fears that they would cause harm to themselves or
others. In many religions, women and girls were banned from touching religious texts, pray-
ing, or entering places of worship during menstruation. Beliefs about the impurity or power of
menstrual blood influenced management practices. Women and girls took steps to ensure that
others could not see or access their disposed menstrual blood such as washing materials prior
to disposal, eschewing single-use disposable sanitary pads, or wrapping used absorbents to pre-
vent detection.

 Other behavioural expectations stemmed from beliefs that different foods or activities
would negatively impact women’s and girls’ health during menstruation. Hot or cold foods
were feared to influence blood flow or clotting, and foods of various colour or flavour groups
were feared to exacerbate menstrual pain, smell, acne, or cause illness.
Expectations were enforced by others, such as teachers or family, through instruction, disci-
pline, or teasing. Family members enforcement of behavioural expectations such as religious
or culturally proscribed menstrual restrictions greatly influenced the extent to which these
were adhered to and thus women’s and girls’ menstrual experience. Less explicit taboos such
as expectations of cleanliness, female propriety, and secrecy around menstruation were
‘enforced by adults in the community through signals and gestures’ [33]. Participants
expressed fear of judgement from others should they fail to comply.
Women and girls internalised menstrual restrictions and stigma and sought to regulate
their behaviour accordingly. This impacted confidence to engage in other activities during
menstruation and added to experiences of shame because a failure to hide menses was viewed
as a personal failure to maintain feminine standards or menstrual etiquette.
Resource limitations
Resource deficits contributed to economic and physical environments that limited women’s
choices for menstrual practices and shaped their experiences of menstruation. Quotations are
presented in Box 2 and contributing citations in Table 3.
Physical environment.
Many studies focused on the relationships between menstruation
and infrastructure, in particular, water and sanitation facilities. Women and girls reported
requiring spaces to undertake a range of menstrual tasks, including changing menstrual mate-
rials, washing and drying menstrual materials, and cleaning their hands and bodies. Such
spaces were often unavailable or poorly supported female needs.
Availability and characteristics of sanitation facilities and infrastructure varied across the
locations frequented by participants, such as home, school, work, or public areas. Available
facilities shaped experiences. An absence of sanitation facilities or safe spaces outside the home
meant managing menstruation in these locations was more challenging, reducing confidence
to travel outside the home and increasing distress and fear of shame. Characteristics of the
infrastructure such as the distance to or availability of soap and water, as well as the presence
of locks or lights, influenced the menstrual practices that could safely be undertaken. The avail-
ability of a bin or incinerators or community waste disposal or the use of pit latrines influenced
disposal choices. There were mixed perspectives on disposal options. For women and girls, the
priority was perceived privacy, with concerns that materials would attract pests. Teachers and
authors expressed concerns about blockages to sanitation systems.
The way that women and girls perceived the available environments for menstrual manage-
ment was an integral part of their experience, expanded upon below. This represented a com-
bination of what was available with personal needs and expectations for cleanliness, privacy,
and ‘appropriate’ behaviours. In schools, gender-separate latrines and locks on doors were fre-
quently discussed as compromising privacy, as was a lack of water to wash hands and remove
evidence of menstrual blood from latrines.
Environmental considerations were noted in studies across varied geographies. Wet seasons
and weather presented challenges for thoroughly and discretely drying reusable menstrual
materials [16, 79]. Water scarcity altered behaviours where this resource was limited and was
therefore conserved during washing absorbents or cleaning blood from hands or latrines [88,
89, 100]. Two studies undertaken in a cold climates found that latrines were too cold to be
used during winter months [35, 77].

Physical environment
‘The toilets have no good doors, and anyone can see you when you are changing’ (partic-
ipant; Crichton 2013) [10].
‘My friend does not have enough water. I saw her pants was blood stain[ed] because she
did not put pad. She did not have money to buy [a] pad. [She has] no toilet at her house,
and she used [the] toilet of her neighbor’ (participant; Daniels 2016) [51].
‘Showering was not an option in schools that experienced drought during the winter
because schools had to prioritize water consumption and sanitation needs. For girls who
rented a room with their siblings in the community, they also lacked the privacy to bathe
at home’ (Long 2013) [9].
‘I want to use the bush. At the bush you can cover the blood that pours on the ground
with sand, but in the public toilet you can’t’ (participant; Rheinlander 2018) [81].
‘The bucket/dustbin is a problem, we should be given an incinerator because the dustbin
is a problem. It would be better to burn them than to carry them to dump in the latrine.
And flush toilets are bad—we prefer latrines’ (participant; Sommer 2009) [87].
‘Some days we bleed heavily, and we need to change clothes at least 2 or 3 times during
the school hours. There is no place to change and dispose the cloth—there is question of
putting back those used cloth in our pockets. So we just bunk classes when we have to
change the clothes’ (participant; WaterAid 2009) [101].
Economic environment
‘Several women. . .wanted disposable pads but indicated that distance to vendors or an
inability to go to markets themselves limited their access’ (Caruso 2017) [16].
‘As the market is a little far away, we will get them only when we go ourselves . . . Will we
ask men and boys to get it for us? . . .We have to use cloth and feel dirty to wash’ (partici-
pant; Caruso 2017) [16].
‘Poverty prevents girls from effectively managing their periods. For example, while girls
often state that commercially-available pads are their preferred method for managing
their periods, a lack of money inhibits them from purchasing pads and, in two instances,
inhibited shopkeepers’ or kiosk owners’ ability to stock pads’ (McMahon 2011) [5].
‘Several factors contribute to the excessively high pricing of sanitary products in SI [Sol-
omon Islands]. Wholesalers are subject to a 15% Goods Tax on all imported products.
“Drugs, medicines, medicinal and surgical goods” are exempt from this tax, although
sanitary products do not currently qualify for the exemption. The high cost of transport
is another factor, but we also heard anecdotally that retailers add a 30%-40% mark-up
on products such as these’ (IWDA 2017) [62].
‘Some people exchange sex for money. The money is used to buy pads. Maybe she is
being given money then they have sexual intercourse. . .sometimes is good, sometimes
it’s not because you need help, so you will just engage yourself into sex’ (participant;

 Economic environment.
Lack of funds to purchase menstrual items or pain relief, and
lack of affordable cloth or commercial menstrual products, was a frequent study finding.
Many women and girls struggled to afford their choice of material, some studies noting that
the household frequently lacked money for basic necessities and that commercial sanitary pads
were considered an unaffordable luxury [5, 10, 15, 41, 43, 51, 64, 68]. Adolescent girls in poor
households noted that requesting money for menstrual needs could cause friction in the
household [10, 11]. Girls regularly undertook paid employment to generate funds. Two studies
from Kenya and one in Ghana noted concerns that girls engaged in transactional sex to meet
menstrual and other personal funding needs [4, 11, 64]; authors of a study in Ethiopia noted
that this was not reported in their population [100]. In some studies, authors noted that teach-
ers and NGOs provided menstrual materials, but that this was unreliable [44, 58]. Similarly, in
humanitarian contexts, participants expressed that material provision was inconsistent [15, 35,
83]. Stock shortages and inflated pricing of menstrual products due to remote locations,
retailer mark-up, and taxes were noted in some studies [5, 62, 63, 104]. In humanitarian con-
texts, changed access to materials was salient in women’s experiences as they adapted to new
management practices or were unable continue their past preferred behaviours [40, 83].
Menstrual experience
Illustrative quotations of menstrual practices and perceptions are provided in S2 Table; Box 3
shows themes of containment, confidence, and shame.
Menstrual practices.
The behaviours undertaken to manage menstrual bleeding were a
central component of the experiences reported. While studies differed in the extent to which
they explored these practices, together they provided a comprehensive picture of the range of
practices women and girls undertake to manage menses (S2 Table). These included accessing
and using materials to absorb menses, changing materials and disposing of them, washing
hands before or after changing materials, washing genitals, and washing and drying reusable
materials. Transportation of clean and used materials, as well as their storage between menses,
were highlighted in a smaller number of studies. Practices were strongly linked to participants’
experiences of physical health symptoms, with suggestions that unhygienic practices directly
cause irritation and infection [9–11, 41, 44, 51, 56, 68, 72, 75]. Participants frequently inter-
preted genital irritation as resulting from properties of their menstrual materials. Many studies
highlighted inadequate access to preferred, comfortable materials to absorb menses as prob-
lematic. The materials used, and the resources to undertake menstrual practices such as
washing hands, were associated with women’s and girls’ levels of confidence to manage men-
struation and their confidence to engage in other activities.
Perception of practices and environments.
A critical distinction emerged between
reported menstrual practices and women’s and girls’ perceptions of them, i.e., if women were
able to use their preferred practices and if these were perceived as reliable and comfortable (S2
Table). Perceptions were heavily influenced by women’s and girls’ understanding of menstrua-
tion and their internalised expectations of optimal practices. Similarly, while the physical envi-
ronment impacted on menstrual experience, perceptions of the environments’ cleanliness,
privacy, and safety were an integral component of experience. The stigmatised nature of men-
struation, taboos against the visibility of menstrual blood, and threat of sexual advances or
teasing by males all contributed to women’s and girls’ perceptions of the adequacy of different
environments. For example, in some cultures, even if disposal bins were available within
latrines, taboos around others seeing menstrual blood meant that these were perceived as inad-
equate because they left women and girls feeling vulnerable to embarrassment or physical
harm through witchcraft [14, 72, 84].

 Box 3. Illustrative quotations for themes of containment, confidence,
and shame
Containment
‘Girls also stated their fear that others would know when they are on their period, that
they would “smell” or “see” their stained clothes, that they would make fun of them,
especially the boys. “I can be worried because in our class we have stubborn boys [. . .] I
am not comfortable that, if it comes on my clothes everyone will know”‘ (participant;
Guerry 2013) [59].
‘Cloths were frequently mentioned as ineffective because blood leaks through the cloth,
a bloodied cloth can slip out of panties and fall on the ground, and bloodied cloth smells
“like bad eggs” or feels wet or heavy’ (McMahon 2011) [5].
‘I only have one uniform, so when I stain my skirt I go home and stay there until my
skirt is dry’ (participant; Pillitteri 2011) [79].
‘To assist with menstrual management in schools, the girls recommended the need to
have emergency pads, underwear, extra clothing including shawls and pain medication,
be available for girls who do not have the MHM-related materials they need’ (Mumtaz
2016) [73].
Confidence
‘[I can manage] because [my] parents often tell [teach] me, and I clean [my] vagina well.
I am able to know about menstruation and what to do for well hygiene, and [I] have
enough sanitary pad[s]’ (participant; Morrison 2016) [72].
‘In the following example, feeling positive about menstruation required having access to
sanitary pads and feeling confident about how to keep menstruation secret: “When I am
at home, I don’t like sitting in the house. I prefer going outside when I have my pad on
and I am not afraid to play with my friends”‘ (Crichton 2013) [10].
‘. . . You feel very uncomfortable, but madam we have no choice’ (participant; Lahme
2016) [68, 69].
‘I think it definitely shapes our perceptions of our bodies, at least it did me. I think it
leads to a lot of confusion about your body and what it’s supposed to be doing, and I
think it also informs our perceptions about what our role is as a wife, or a mother, or a
sister, because if you have grown up in a very strict household where the ritual was very
strongly emphasised, then you will go through life where you think you are untouchable
for the four days of the month’ (participant; Crawford 2014) [47].
‘In PNG [Papua New Guinea] and SI [Solomon Islands], some female participants
described staying home during their menstrual periods and avoiding interactions. This
is often self-imposed and frequently relates to a fear of clothes being stained by men-
strual blood or fear that others can smell menstrual blood’ (IWDA 2017) [63].
‘You can’t be free when you are menstruating like you always are when you are not
[menstruating]. When you are menstruating and you are in class, maybe you do not sit
properly and blood leaks on the pant [underwear] and out on the uniform. So you can’t

 Participants described different levels of satisfaction with the same practices or environ-
ments. In some studies, this manifested in generational tensions between mothers and daugh-
ters, where mothers felt that daughters already had greater access to materials or knowledge
than they had experienced [5, 97]. In humanitarian contexts, maintaining expected standards
of cleanliness and menstrual etiquette was challenged when practices and environments had
be free, you will just be thinking that maybe you have messed up. So it’s better to be at
home’ (participant; Chinyama 2019) [44].
‘A couple of girls said it was easier to concentrate if they knew when to expect their peri-
ods, and suggested tracking the dates on a calendar: “If may be you want to be remem-
bering fast on your own you can write a calendar.” One remarked that it used to be more
difficult to concentrate back before their schools started providing pads, saying “aah it’s
better, there [are] pads, we are now moving on the same page [as] boys. . .”‘ (Nanda
2016) [75].
Shame and distress
‘Girls expressed concern that if they were to use the toilet for managing menstruation
and there was a line of students, other students would then know they were menstruat-
ing because of increased time of toilet use or blood left on the seat or toilet bowl. [G]irls
expressed embarrassment, shame, and anxiety related to these possibilities’ (Ellis 2016)
[56].
‘Well, I have a very big family, 11 sisters and six brothers. My mother, if we’d ask any
kind of question like that, she would slap our mouth; she was very severe! So I thought I
was going to die; I didn’t know what it was when I bled for the first time. Even so I
decided to hide it Every time I bled, I’d spend a whole day in bed because I thought I was
going to die. This lasted for six months’ (participant; do Amaral 2011) [55].
‘Girls felt fear and shame in anticipation of a bloodstain, an odour, or a classmate realiz-
ing she was menstruating because these outcomes all resulted in humiliation, laughing
and teasing from classmates’ (Long 2013) [9].
‘In our community we have never talked about it because we feel ashamed’ (participant;
P8 Parent FGD 3) [11].

“tainting” and would consider them less desirable if their menstrual status was revealed’

 changed [35, 40]. Perceptions reflected an interaction between resources and behavioural
expectations and were often more salient to confidence, shame, and psychological, and social
consequences than the menstrual practices themselves.
Containment.
Containment was fundamental to participants across populations and
included leakage, keeping materials in place, and minimising detectable odour. Authors con-
ceptualised containment challenges differently, with some viewing soiling or odour as failures
of resources to meet females’ basic needs causing frustration, while others viewed concerns
about visible menstrual blood as symptoms of the stigmatised nature of menstruation and
enforced need for concealment. Direct quotations from participants supported both dis-
courses. They expressed fear at stigma or bullying invoked by revealed menstrual status; at the
same time, they expressed frustration at the need to clean limited supplies of cloths or linens
or at the experience of odour. Similarly, cloths falling out of underwear was viewed as both
embarrassing and a frustrating restriction of activities. The now-dirty materials needed to be
cleaned and re-affixed. Internalised expectations of menstrual etiquette, keeping clean and dis-
crete, meant that failures to contain menstrual blood or odour were viewed as personal failings
imbued with embarrassment and distress.
Confidence.
Women and girls reported varying levels of assurance that they were able to
manage their menstruation and could undertake other activities during menstruation. These
closely related subthemes were a salient part of menstrual experience. In our integrated
scheme, this is titled as confidence but includes concepts of self-efficacy and perceived agency.
Women’s and girls’ confidence that they could execute the necessary tasks to manage their
menses pervaded reports of menstrual experiences although was rarely identified by authors as
an independent theme. Reading across studies, authors consistently noted improved confi-
dence to manage menstruation when participants had access to preferred materials and envi-
ronments, greater knowledge, and access to social support [10, 15, 34, 38, 41, 51, 56, 58, 64, 70,
72, 75, 79, 84, 95, 103, 104]. One study identified and defined this construct as menstrual self-
efficacy [51]. Studies with greater interpretive depth noted that a lack of confidence to manage
menses influenced how women and girls perceived themselves and their bodies, internalising a
sense that ‘their bodies are beyond their control’ [5, 16, 47]. Conversely, greater confidence
positively impacted outcomes.
Throughout studies, authors also reported varied levels of confidence to engage in other
activities while menstruating. This was influenced by women’s and girls’ confidence that they
could manage menstruation and past experiences of failed containment, as well as by the sup-
port available. In some studies, this confidence was expressed as women’s and girls’ sense of
‘freedom’ or empowerment during menstruation, that they could freely participate in social
activities or travel outside the home without preoccupation with their menstruation [10, 43,
44]. Confidence to undertake other activities during menstruation was frequently the mecha-
nism through which poorly perceived menstrual practices and shame translated into impacts
on social participation and well-being.
Shame and distress. Across settings and studies, menstruation was overwhelmingly asso-
ciated with feelings of shame and distress. Internalised menstrual stigma and expectations of
silence on the topic resulted in negative attitudes and intense fears of shame should menstrual
status be exposed. In most studies, some participants reported experiences of intense distress
recalling incidents when menstrual status was revealed. Distress—including worry and fear—
associated with menstruation were highlighted by authors as significant burdens in the lives of
women and girls and as indicative of the need for more attention to the topic [3, 10, 11, 16, 40,
43, 44, 51, 68, 72, 81, 83, 84, 88, 90].
In some studies, authors noted that participants, typically a small minority, expressed a pos-
itive sentiment regarding their menstruation as affirmation of their womanhood and fertility

 [5, 8, 32, 43, 47, 51, 52, 55, 60, 71, 78, 85, 109]. For these women and girls, menstruation was
viewed as a healthy bodily function, and the stress of management was tempered by pride in
being a woman and the potential of joy of motherhood.
Individual menstrual factors.
Physical symptoms during menstruation—particularly
menstrual pain such as cramping of the abdomen, back, and legs—was a prominent part of
women’s and girls’ experiences. Participants also reported fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting,
breast tenderness, skin blemishing, and irritability. Menstrual symptoms and the presence of
abnormalities or disorders moderated individuals’ experiences, exacerbating shame and reduc-
ing confidence if participants felt that their experience was abnormal and making it more diffi-
cult to conceal menses. Pain directly restricted school, work, and social participation. In some
studies, girls expressed a desire for a safe place to rest at school to manage menstrual cramping
[8, 88]. Awareness of, and access to, pain relief methods varied. In some studies, participants
reported used strategies such as paracetamol or local herbal remedies, hot water, or rest to
combat menstrual pain. Individual menstrual variations, such as the extent of bleeding, influ-
enced perceptions of adequate practices and environments. Despite being the focus of very few
studies, antecedents of menstrual experience, including knowledge, social support, behavioural
expectations, and the resource environment, were all relevant to managing pain and other
symptoms [103–109]. Few women accessed healthcare, and the economic environment
restricted access to pharmaceutical pain relief. In 3 studies, authors reported myths that phar-
maceutical pain relief would result in health detriments or infertility [62, 70, 79].
Impacts
Illustrative quotations are presented in Box 4, and a summary of contributing citations is dis-
played in Table 3.
Physical health. Women and girls reported genital discomfort, irritation, rashes, and
bruising during menses stemming from the properties of menstrual materials or inadequate
frequency of change [9–11, 15, 37, 41, 44, 51, 56, 57, 68, 69, 72, 75]. Authors linked these
reports to reproductive tract infections, supported by key informants such as healthcare pro-
viders. In many settings, participants emphasised the importance of ‘keeping clean’ during
menstruation to prevent disease and were anxious to maintain this standard. However, beliefs
about the practices required for cleanliness or the associated health consequences varied. In
some settings, women and girls expressed a need to wash genitals many times per day to main-
tain hygiene, while in others, washing during menstruation was thought to impact blood flow.
In some studies, authors reported a mix of experiences of symptoms such as irritation, as well
as participants’ perceived health risks. Participants reported fears of infertility or cancer result-
ing from unhygienic menstrual management [11, 44, 97]. In others, women and girls were
concerned that they could contract genital infections or viruses from using unclean sanitation
facilities [16, 56, 81, 84]. Authors identified health impacts resulting from adherence to taboos
such as dietary restrictions on the consumption of common foods, linked to fatigue, or with-
holding urination for fear of others observing menstrual blood in latrines [16, 41, 56, 57].
Psychological health. Reading within and across studies, our integrated model separated
the negative menstrual experiences of poor confidence to manage menstrual bleeding or
shame and distress associated with menstruation, from the impacts of this experience on
broader psychosocial well-being and mental health, i.e., impacts on anxiety, depression, and
well-being beyond the immediate menstrual experience. Studies noted the potential for nega-
tive menstrual experiences to have broader psychological impacts [9, 10, 43, 44, 47, 68, 89, 93,
107]. Authors noted the erosion of self-esteem due to menstrual experiences, the contribution
of stress during menstruation to anxiety, and depression linked to reduced social participation

Physical health
‘If you don’t wash and change your sanitary pads regularly you can have rashes and
bruises. It’s very common to feel itching when you are using old rags or pieces of blan-
kets. . .you feel very uncomfortable’ (participant; Lahme 2016) [68].
‘If the cloth used is dirty, i.e., not cleaned properly before it is used, it can cause boils and
sores to form on private parts’ (participant; Garg 2001) [14].
‘When washing the cloth the bacteria may get transferred to our hands, and it is also dis-
gusting to wash the cloths. . .Later on we have used the same hands to eat and do many
other things’ (participant; Morrison 2016) [72].
‘When you are using mattress it can cut into small pieces and it can get inside the vagina.
[S]o she can get problem in the vagina’ (participant; P9 School D). ‘She can get cancer’
(participant; P3 School D) (Mason 2013) [11].
Psychological health
‘Participants used language like “feeling bad”, feeling “stressed”, or “fearful” and “want-
ing to cry” to describe the emotional distress they experienced’ (Crichton 2013) [10].
‘While being secluded, girls reported being bored, lonely, and depressed: “I was bored
sitting there alone. I felt like no one loved me. . .I felt like crying. . .”‘ (Morrison 2016)
[72].
‘During my first menstruation I was shocked and embarrassed. Generally, whenever I
have it, I think that I am below humans, depressed, eh. . .I hate being female; I assumed
it as a disease. . .’ (participant; Tegegne 2014) [93].
‘The girl cries, “Am I sick or what? Am I pregnant or what”. . .she feels bad about
herself. . .a girl could even commit suicide. She could come to that. . .if it was a single girl
[she asks herself], “And now what am I going to do? What am I worth?” In this situation,
many poison themselves. . .and many times you’re not pregnant, only that the blood has
stuck together, that clot. . .It’s in vain that they have worried’ (participant; Long 2013)
[9].
Education and employment
‘Girls missed parts of class when they had to change menstrual hygiene materials. This
was due to short breaks between classes, in combination with the long distance girls had
to walk to find a private place outside to change, or if they returned to their homes to
manage menstrual hygiene’ (Long 2013) [9].
‘I felt like, oh no. . . I didn’t want to stand up in class. My friends told me to go for lunch
[with them]. I told them I didn’t want to because I was having my periods. . .I thought,
like, I didn’t want anyone to come near me. I thought, like, they will get to know. Maybe
I’m smelling. . .’ (participant; Miiro 2018) [70].

 or experiences of stigma. Studies of those with menstrual disorders highlighted feelings of
powerlessness in addressing dysmenorrhea or associated symptoms that may negatively
impact psychological outcomes for these individuals [60, 103–105].
Education and employment.
Many studies that focused on girls of school age reported
consequences for education [3–5, 8–11, 15, 37, 39, 41, 44, 51, 56–59, 62–64, 67–70, 72, 75, 77,
79, 85, 87–89, 91, 93, 94, 100, 101, 104, 106, 107]. Some highlighted full- or part-day absences,
and others detailed disengagement from class when girls were present. Reduced participation
was triangulated with reports from teachers. Multiple aspects of menstrual experience contrib-
uted. Poorly perceived menstrual practices such as unreliable absorbents that girls felt were lia-
ble to leak or expose odour reduced attendance and engagement [8, 9, 11, 37, 39, 41, 56–59, 64,
68, 69, 72, 75, 79, 80, 85, 91, 93, 94, 100, 101]. Girls lacking knowledge and confidence to man-
age menstruation were reluctant to be around others [3–5, 8, 39, 70, 75, 77, 89]. Unsupportive
infrastructure was problematic. In many schools, girls reported that they had no adequate loca-
tion to change absorbents, feared others seeing menstrual blood in latrines, or lacked facilities
to dispose or clean absorbents [4, 5, 9, 10, 15, 41, 51, 56–58, 64, 70, 72, 74, 79, 87, 88]. This
meant travelling home to change menstrual materials, often resulting in part-day absences.
Menstrual pain made school attendance challenging. Some studies reported that teachers
remove you from the exams and say go and make yourself clean, you will make the class-
room to stink and then you will be disappointed and then you will start to say so I have
missed my exams, so instead of you passing you will fail at the end’ (participant; Nanda
2016) [75].
‘. . .I never used to go to class for almost 3 days. I used to sit in the sick bay and sleep. . .I
used to tell my teacher I am sick’ (participant; Jewitt 2014) [64].
‘In addition, if sanitation and disposal facilities at schools or in the workplace are nonex-
istent or not usable (i.e., not functional, lacking in privacy or filthy), women and girls
prefer to go home to change materials, or delay changing materials for extended periods
of time’ (IWDA 2017) [62].
Social participation
‘When I am menstruating, I don’t run. . .I don’t play around. I just stay quiet. I run and
get a heavy flow. Also when I play, I get a heavy flow’ (participant; Secor-Turner 2016)
[85].
‘I feel frightened to go around and meet people because of the smell, so I usually go to
the garden to stay away from people in the village’ (participant; IWDA 2017) [62].
‘Since I am the eldest in the family, I had to help my father with the cattle and the crops
but when I am menstruating I have to tell my mother and she passes it on to my
father. . .he will then remind me that I mustn’t come near where he is working’ (partici-
pant; Padmanabhanunni 2017) [78].
‘Even now, I stay separately for four days. And I don’t touch food, I don’t go to the
kitchen, and I don’t cook, and I don’t go to. . .puja [an act of prayer or worship]. . .reli-
gious function[s]’ (participant; Crawford 2014) [47].

 would send girls home from school, or punish them, if they detected odour or soiled outer gar-
ments, directly linking enforced behavioural expectations to education [41, 43, 81]. Where
menstrual restrictions forbade girls from travelling outside the home or being around males,
these also directly impacted school attendance.
Fewer studies attended to the experiences of adult women, and most explored sanitation
infrastructure and menstrual experiences at home rather than at work. Some studies linked
social exclusion, restriction of travel, and infrastructure deficits to impacts on formal or infor-
mal employment [39, 62, 63, 98].
Social participation.
Women and girls reported altering movement and participation
outside the household during menses, as well as restricting activities such as running or play-
ing sports [9, 14, 15, 35, 36, 38, 41, 43, 44, 47, 51, 59, 62–64, 70, 74, 77, 85, 97, 98, 100, 103–105,
107, 109]. Many motivations echoed those restricting school attendance, with women and girls
experiencing pain or afraid their menstrual status would be exposed, that others would detect
odour, or that menstrual materials or blood would fall out of place. Behavioural expectations
in many settings also restricted interactions with males, food preparation, or participation in
religious gatherings or activities. As noted above, women expressed varied adherence to and
frustrations with explicit restrictions on activities during menstruation, some appreciating rest
and others disliking being excluded. Some restrictions were interconnected with expectations
of propriety placed upon girls as they sexually matured, to protect from sexual advances, as
they could now become pregnant.
Discussion
This systematic review had 2 overarching objectives: (1) to synthesise extant qualitative stud-
ies of women’s and girls’ menstrual experience in LMICs and (2) to integrate findings across
studies to develop a directional model of menstrual experience to advance problem theory in
menstrual health research. Despite different settings and populations, the narratives and
lived experiences that emerged reflected consistent themes, with manifestations that differed
by context. Mapping relationships between themes highlighted the multidimensional nature
of menstrual experience. The integrated model produced illustrates pathways through which
distal and proximal antecedents influence menstrual experience and ultimately result in
impacts on physical and psychological health, education, employment, and social
participation.
Metasynthesis identified multiple components of menstrual experience. Menstrual prac-
tices, such as the type of material used, represented only one of these and directly contributed
to physical health outcomes alone. Women’s and girls’ perceptions of their menstrual practices
and environments emerged as a critical independent theme connecting practices to other
impacts such as school absenteeism. In addition, confidence to manage menstrual bleeding
and to undertake other activities during menses, as well as experiences of shame and fear, were
salient contributors to psychological, social, and educational outcomes. Distal antecedents—
the sociocultural context and resource limitations—underlay more proximal factors. Experi-
ences captured in qualitative studies revealed knowledge of the biological, reproductive, and
practical aspects of menstruation as a source of confidence, shame, and perceived acceptability
of practices and environments. Social support enhanced or diminished experiences. This was
closely connected to behavioural expectations that were placed upon women and girls and
were enforced through discipline and cultural practices and ideals of cleanliness or femininity.
Such expectations and broader menstrual stigma were internalised, influencing experience
and self-concept. Poorly supportive physical infrastructure, such as a lack of water and sanita-
tion facilities, made it difficult for women and girls to undertake their preferred menstrual

 practices in privacy and safety; in addition, the economic environment restricted access to pre-
ferred materials, soap, and pain relief.
Included studies represented a broad range of contexts, although the majority attended to
the experiences of school-aged girls. Amongst this group, we achieved early saturation of
impacts and antecedents. Qualitative studies identified different relative contributions of
antecedents such as the physical environment, knowledge, or behavioural expectations (partic-
ularly explicit restrictions) for girls in different settings, which have implications for program-
ming in those areas. However, researchers should reconsider burdening future populations to
identify these same factors and should focus on more detailed research questions. Greater
depth in understanding the transmission of social norms and behavioural expectations, as well
as confidence during menstruation, requires more attention. Experiences of adult women, par-
ticularly in the workplace, were under-researched. The experience of pain and menstrual dis-
orders was poorly integrated in included studies and did not reach saturation. Most studies
relied on FGDs. This approach was often selected to source priorities for intervention but
meant that studies more often captured shared experiences of the school environment, rather
than deep understanding of individual experiences that may yield greater sociological or psy-
chological insights.
Strengths and limitations
The model presented differs from previous nonsystematic summaries that have generated lists
of considerations to improve menstrual experience but have not specified directional relation-
ships. Systematic searching identified a large body of literature, facilitating clarity in the identi-
fied themes. Metasynthesis remains an evolving methodology for the review of qualitative
literature [30, 110–112]. This work draws on current best practice guidance [26, 27, 29, 30,
112]. As in all reviews, the findings are limited by available studies. The majority of included
studies came from sub-Saharan Africa, and findings may be more representative of this con-
text. We identified no studies from China, and studies from the Middle East and North African
countries were more frequently undertaken in urban, more highly educated populations,
though this reflects the global focus on menstrual hygiene research in specific geographical
areas. Despite extensive searching, eligible studies may have been missed. A small number of
studies in languages other than English were included; however, searching was only under-
taken in English and may not have identified all available publications. Study quality was
appraised using a tool designed for qualitative studies. This may have resulted in poorer scor-
ing of mixed-methods studies that were considered only based on their qualitative compo-
nents. Finally, as with any systematic review of qualitative research, a different team of
researchers may have generated different insights. However, our focus on consensus themes
and auditable methods lends credibility to our results as presented.
This review included a large volume of studies. This presented the opportunity to draw
themes and an integrated model across a broad range of contexts and populations. Region-spe-
cific reviews, or reviews with more targeted research questions, may have space to provide
deeper insights into specific questions or region-specific challenges.
Implications for research and practice
Findings of our synthesis have implications for research and practice. To date, developed inter-
ventions have sought to improve menstrual experience by investing in education (to improve
knowledge) and menstrual products (to improve the economic environment), two of the core
pillars of existing menstrual health frameworks [19, 113]. Social support, the physical environ-
ment, cultural restrictions, and the perception of menses as dirty and needing to be concealed

 were all highly salient in included studies, yet these risk factors have received limited attention
in interventions. Furthermore, these factors likely represent important covariates that should
be considered when not the focus of interventions. The integrated model presented here offers
a more nuanced framework to inform theories of change in program development and to
assist evaluation strategies.
Awareness of multiple, interconnected constructs also aids the identification of unantici-
pated harms. Models focused exclusively on menstrual practices have assessed only physical
harms such as infections. Our integrated model suggests that changes to girls’ perceptions of
their practices may cause distress as they struggle to adopt new practices advised in educa-
tion interventions in an unsupportive physical environment. Interventions that focus on
products may maintain menstrual stigma and reinforce behavioural expectations that con-
cealing menses is paramount. Such interventions may have positive impacts on containment
in the short term but risk greater harms if access to more reliable menstrual materials is
unsustained.
Results have implications for the design of quantitative studies. To date, these have evalu-
ated links between menstrual practices and impacts (e.g., sanitary pad use and school atten-
dance) [18, 114]. Our integrated model suggests that this is an indirect relationship and is
unlikely to capture the true effects of menstrual experience on psychological, educational, and
social outcomes without attention to the other components of experience that mediate this
relationship. This integrated model should inform hypotheses for more detailed quantitative
studies to test the pathways emerging from qualitative research and subsequently inform inter-
vention research. Furthermore, it may serve to inform measure development for identified
components of menstrual experience, antecedents, and impacts.
The definition ‘menstrual hygiene’ outlined in the Introduction fit poorly with the inte-
grated model resulting from this metasynthesis. This definition provides an unclear list of
menstrual practices, incorporates one mention of perceptions of the menstrual environment
but not practices, and refers to physical facilities for disposal only. Recent expansions on this
definition to include menstrual knowledge conflates menstrual experience with antecedents
[115]. As presently defined, ‘menstrual hygiene’ may reflect an incomplete set of menstrual
rights or needs, or it could be amended to capture menstrual practices as have emerged here.
Findings of this review suggest that terminology and construct definition in menstrual health
research may need to be expanded to recognise the many components of menstrual experience
and contributing factors.
Conclusions
In sum, extant qualitative studies have identified consistent negative impacts for health and
social participation resulting from poor menstrual experience. This large body of qualitative
evidence emphasises the need for practitioners and policymakers to attend to menstruation
to improve the physical and psychological health, educational attainment, and social partici-
pation of women and girls. The integrated model presented advances the development of
problem theory in menstrual health research and highlights important factors to consider in
future research and practice. Menstrual experience is characterised not only as the hygiene
practices undertaken to manage menstrual bleeding but by women’s and girls’ perceptions
of these practices, their confidence to manage menses and engage in other activities while
menstruating, and their experience of shame and containment. Through synthesis, we eluci-
date antecedent pathways and highlight the multiple components of menstrual experience
that must be considered for effective interventions and comprehensive quantitative
evaluation.
