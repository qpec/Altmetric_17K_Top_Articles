Although much work is being done to develop new treatments, research and knowledge regarding factors underlying
implant-related microbial colonization leading to infection are less comprehensive. Presence of microorganisms in and
around implants clinically characterized as uninfected remains unknown. The objective of this study was to detect and
identify bacteria and fungi on implants from various groups of patients with no prior indications of implant related
infections. Patient samples (implants and tissue) were collected from five different hospitals in the Capital region of
Denmark. By in-depth microbiological detection methods, we examined the prevalence of bacteria and fungi on 106
clinically uninfected implants from four patient groups (aseptic loosening, healed fractures, craniofacial complications
and recently deceased). Of 106 clinically uninfected implants and 39 negative controls investigated, 66% were colonized
by bacteria and 40% were colonized by fungi (p < 0.0001 compared to negative controls). A large number of microbes
were found to colonize the implants, however, the most prevalent microbes present were not common aetiological
agents of implant infections. The findings indicate that implants provide a distinct niche for microbial colonization.
These data have broad implications for medical implant recipients, as well as for supporting the idea that the presence
of foreign objects in the body alters the human microbiome by providing new colonization niches.
Key words: Implants; non-pathogenic colonization; microbiome; microbes; foreign bodies.

Implants are an important part of modern medi-
cine, saving thousands of people from impaired
mobility, morbidity and mortality (1). Based on
medical
progress in this area along with
new
implant technologies, future decades are expected
to see an increase in ~600% in total knee revisions
between 2005 and 2030 in the US (2). The primary
complication (20–25%) following implant surgery is
colonization of the implant surface or adjacent tis-
sue with microorganisms that can ultimately neces-
sitate
implant
removal
and
replacement
(3).
Dependant on the location of the implant and the
surgical procedure, infection rates average between
1 and 2% (4, 5).
A key aspect of chronic implant infections is
that they are caused by aggregates of bacteria,
known as biofilms. Biofilms are well-known to be
recalcitrant to both host defence and antibiotics
and have been proposed as a critical contributor
to chronic infections. Indeed, recent evidence sug-
gests that biofilms with diameters smaller than
100 lm (less than ~105 bacteria) are capable of
sustaining a chronic bacterial infection, although
these infections may initially be asymptomatic for
the patient (6). The small numbers of bacteria
comprising an aggregate makes it difficult to detect
by conventional clinical microbiology techniques

 (7), but modern PCR-based methods increase the
potentials (8–10). The lack of symptoms may not
prompt investigation of infection, however, such
infections
can
trigger
low-level
inflammation,
which builds over time and ultimately leads to
symptoms (11). Based on these observations, we
hypothesized that apparently uninfected implants
(hereafter designated ‘clinically uninfected’) may
harbour
microbial
communities.
To
test
this
hypothesis, we used microbiological and molecular
techniques
to
examine
clinically
uninfected
implants that had been removed for reasons other
than clinical or paraclinical indication of infection,
for the presence of microbial communities includ-
ing negative controls (devises temporarily inserted
into patients during primary knee operation and
deceased as well as devises opened in surgery room
and laboratory).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The study is a non-interventional exploratory clinical
study. Patient samples (implants and tissue) were collected
from five different hospitals in the Capital Region of Den-
mark (Region Hovedstaden, RH) between February 5,
2013, and April 4, 2017. In total 106 clinically uninfected
implants were removed from four different groups of
patients: those with aseptic loosening, healed fractures,
craniofacial complications and recently deceased. Five
implants that had been deemed clinically infected were
used as positive controls. Thirty-nine negative controls,
described in detail below, were also included. The inclu-
sion criterion was the presence of an implant. Except for
positive controls exclusion criteria were signs of putrefac-
tion or inflammation and/or a history of infection of the
implant.
The following information was obtained from each
patient: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), implant age,
implant type, known diseases, current medicine, history of
infection, immune status as well as tobacco and alcohol
use. Limited information (BMI, implant type, age and
gender) was available for 18 individuals in the recently
deceased group. No information was available for the
patients in the craniofacial implant group or from three
individuals from the aseptic implant group and the posi-
tive control group (Table 1).
By combining results from different patient groups
makes this study the first of its kind with no prior experi-
mental results to base a power analysis for calculation of
a necessary sample size. As for the negative controls based
on our findings of colonization of approximately 70% of
the 106 implants and assuming that 35% of the negative
controls to be colonized we estimated that 40 controls will
allow us to detect a significantly lower background with a
power of 0.95 and a p-value below 1%. For the immuno-
logical investigations the investigators were blinded. The
study was approved by the National and regional ethical
committee of Copenhagen, Denmark (1500093 and H-2-
2012-144 (46596)).
Sample collection
All surgical procedures were performed using standard
aseptic
techniques.
Implants
were
surgically
removed,
placed in a sterile container (Lock&Lock, Anaheim, CA,
USA) and covered by sterile physiological saline (Sub-
strate Department, Panum, Copenhagen, Denmark (SD)).
Implants from deceased individuals were retrieved within
48 h post-mortem and only if the body had been kept at
4 °C (12). For the aseptic loosening group, tissue adjacent
to the implant was excised and split into two sections.
One section was preserved in 4% buffered formaldehyde
(VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA), while the other was
preserved in RNAlater (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA,
USA).
All subsequent handling of materials or samples was
performed in a laminar flow cabinet. All materials used
for sample handling and for DNA purification were UV
sterilized within a closed laminar flow bench for at least
30 min before use. For DNA isolation and microbe

 culturing, all implants were sonicated for 5 min then
vortexed for 30 s as previously described (13). The sonica-
tion liquid was centrifuged at 7500 g for 20 min until the
pellet could be re-suspended in a maximum of 2 mL of
physiological saline (SD). The resulting suspension was
used for DNA purification and streak plating on Luria-
Bertani agar plates, modified Conradi-Drigalski (“blue”)
agar plates and Blood agar plates (Statens Serum institute
(SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark). Plates were incubated for
48 h at 37 °C, and identification of the cultured microbes
was performed using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/
Ionization–Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) spectroscopy
(Bruker, Bremen, Germany).
Negative controls
A total of 39 negative control implants were included in
the study to assess the false positive rate. These included:
(i) 11 implant screws that were placed into wound during
primary knee surgery before removal; (ii) 10 implants
screws that were implanted into deceased individuals dur-
ing post-mortem examination. For implantation, the area
of incision was washed with iodine solution, then an inci-
sion was made through the skin with a sterile scalpel. Fur-
ther incision to reach the bone was made with a new
disposable sterile scalpel. The screws were placed touching
the bone for approximately 20 s before removed; (iii) two
implants (knee spacers) were unpacked in a surgery room
and; (iv) 16 implants were unpacked in the laboratory. All
the implant materials were stored at 4 °C in sterile physio-
logical saline (SD) until tested for microbial contamina-
tion by the same DNA purification, PCR and sequencing
methods (described below) as used for the test implants.
Histopathology
Tissue samples were prepared and stained as previously
described (14). One tissue section from each sample was
stained with haematoxylin and eosin and analysed by one
observer (AGG) with medical background and 6 years of
forensic pathology experience and by a specialist and
experienced pathologist (HPH), to assess the infiltration of
inflammatory cells. The degree of inflammation was deter-
mined for each sample as none, mild, moderate or severe
infiltration of inflammatory cells. Histological analysis was
performed using a Leica light microscope equipped with
polarization filters and an integrated eyepiece graticule.
DNA purification, PCR and sequencing
DNA was purified from tissue samples (25 mg) and pellet
from sonicated/vortexed implants using the QIAamp (Qia-
gen, Hilden, Germany) tissue kit according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions, with a slight modification: tissues
were incubated overnight with proteinase K rather than
for 4 h. Real-time polymerase chain reactions were per-
formed using universal fungal and bacterial primers. Sam-
ples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of ≥2 cycles lower
than the Ct value of the NTC and Tm value similar to
that of the positive controls (�5 °C) were considered posi-
tive. A cut-off of 2 or 1 cycles from the NTC to consider
samples positive has been used by others (15–17). Ampli-
cons from positive samples were purified using the GFX
PCR
Purification
Kit
(Amersham;
GE
Healthcare,
Amersham, UK) and sequenced by Macrogen Europe
(Macrogen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The resulting
sequences were analysed using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov) and LeBIBI (https://umr5558-bibiserv.univ-
lyon1.fr/lebibi/lebibi.cgi).
When
possible,
polymicrobial
samples were analysed using the RipSeq algorithm (Patho-
genomix, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) to separate the sequences
(18).
The forward (50-YAACGAGCGCAACCC-30) (14) and
reverse (50-AGGCCCGGGAACGYATTYAACG-30) (14)
bacterial primers (Y=C or T) were designed to anneal to
16S rDNA, while the fungal primers were designed to
anneal to the ITS86 (50-GTGAATCATCGAATCTTT-
GAAC-30) and ITS4 (50-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-
30) regions on the 5.8S rDNA, respectively (19). The pri-
mers were synthesized by TAG (Copenhagen, Denmark).
The PCR master mix contained SYBR Green PCR Master
mix (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA), RNase-free
Milli-Q and 156.25 nM forward and reverse primers. Each
reaction comprised the PCR master mix (18 lL) and 2 lL
of template DNA. Real-time PCR was performed using a
StepOnePlus
instrument
(Life
Technologies
Waltham,
MA, USA) as follows: denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C,
followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 54 °C
(bacteria) or 58 °C (fungi). The Tm value was determined
using a ramped temperature gradient: 60 s at 60 °C,
increasing to 95 °C in 0.3 °C increments over a period of
20 min. A no template control (NTC) with nuclease-free
water (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA) and a
positive control with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida
albicans DNA were included in every run.
To determine the sensitivity of our molecular detection
method (DNA extraction, PCR and subsequent sequenc-
ing) we spiked non-infected tissue with a dilution series
ranging from 100 to 107 of P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
aureus and C. albicans. We were not able to identify less
than 104 of either P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or C. albicans
with our experimental methods.
Statistical analysis
Potential differences between implant infections sites were
investigated by comparing the two dominant implant
groups, screws and knees to the rest of the implants were
performed with Fisher’s exact tests using Prism 6 (Graph-
Pad, La Jolla, CA, USA). A p value ≤ 0.05 was consid-
ered
significant.
Power
calculation
was
based
on
comparison of the findings of either bacterial or fungal
DNA content in the 106 patient samples with the 39 ster-
ile samples using Sampsize at http://sampsize.sourceforge.
net/cgi-bin/s1.cgi.
RESULTS
Study population
To examine whether presumably ‘sterile’ implants
harboured microbial communities, we examined 106
implants along with surrounding tissue from 105
individuals. These implants were removed from
recently deceased persons who died of non-infection-
related causes (n = 46) and from clinical non-
infected patients, i.e., aseptic loosening (n = 20),

 craniofacial implants (n = 20) or fracture healing
(n = 20). Five implants from patients with known
infection were included as positive controls. As false
positives are a key concern in studies such as this, 39
negative controls were included. These negative con-
trols included implants directly removed from pack-
aging that had been introduced into surgical wounds
of living and deceased individuals. The craniofacial
implant group and three individuals of the aseptic
implant group were not included in our patient char-
acteristic due to lack of information. Of the remain-
ing 82 individuals, 48 were male (59%), the median
age was 64 (18–97) years, the BMI was 25 (13.5–
40.1) and the implant residence time was 13 months
(1 day–432 months). An overview of the patient
characteristics is presented in Table 1.
Foreign bodies initiates a new niche for a microbiota
to arise
Of the 106 clinically uninfected implants (Table S1)
examined, 70 (66%) were positive for bacteria, 43
(40%) were positive for fungi, and 78 (73%) were
positive for either bacteria, fungi or both (Table 2).
An implant was categorized as positive for microor-
ganisms when a tissue sample, implant sonicate or
both where positive for microorganisms since the
microorganisms in the tissue where considered to
be
associated
with
the
implant.
The
microbes
detected appeared to be specific for their respective
implant groups (Fig. 1). Implants removed due to
healed fractures appeared to be colonized primarily
by microbes usually associated with the skin and
mucosal membranes, whereas implants removed
due to aseptic loosening were colonized primarily
by microbes associated with mucosal membranes.
Implants from the deceased group were mainly col-
onized by microbes originating from mucosal mem-
branes and the intestinal flora. Finally, bacteria and
fungi colonizing implants from the craniofacial
group were associated with the skin, mucosal mem-
branes and the oral cavity. Fig. 1 provides an
overview of the genera and species of bacteria and
fungi identified.
When comparing PCR and culturing methods, a
higher number of fungi were detected with PCR,
whereas the bacterial number detected and identified
by culturing and PCR were more similar (Table 3).
To investigate any potential difference in implant
type, the two dominant groups of implants, screws
and knees (Table S1), were compared with the
remaining implants. There was a significant differ-
ence in the number of positive bacterial findings
between the groups. For the screws there was a sig-
nificantly higher number of positives compared to
the rest of the implants (p = 0.033) while the knees
had a significantly lower number of positives com-
pared to the rest of the implants (p = 0.0082) (Fish-
ers Exact test on a 2 by 2 table). No difference was
seen when comparing frequency of fungal coloniza-
tion of implant types. In the five implants used as
positive controls, bacteria well known to cause
implant infections were identified. As controls for
contamination during sample processing, 39 sterile
implant materials were tested for the presence of
either bacterial or fungal DNA content. Twenty of
the control implants were inserted in patients and the
remaining included packages that were either opened
during surgery or in the laboratory. Since all control
implants tested negative after being processed similar
to the investigated implants from patients (Table S2)
the frequency of findings of either bacterial or fungal
DNA were lower on the negative control implants
than the patient samples (p < 0.0001; power > 99%)
indicating that contamination during sample pro-
cessing was not of significant concern in this study.
Age, BMI, implant age, medical history or the
general health of study participants were not con-
founding factors when analysing patient history
and positive microbial findings of the clinically
uninfected implants. None of the participants had a
history or symptoms suggestive of bacteraemia or
fungaemia after the implant had been inserted.
There was no correlation between the post-mortem

Low infiltration of inflammatory cells despite
presence of microorganisms
Although it is clear from our findings that clinically
uninfected implants are colonized with microbes, it
was
not
clear
whether
the
presence
of
these
microbes caused an inflammatory reaction. To test
this, we performed a histopathological analysis of
the tissue surrounding the implant. This analysis
revealed that none of the samples obtained from
recently deceased patients showed any signs of infil-
tration by inflammatory cells, whereas 90% of the
healed fracture and craniofacial implants had mild
to moderate infiltration. Of the 99 tissue samples

 available from 20 aseptic loosening implants, 44 of
the biopsies (44%) had some degree of infiltration.
35 samples where determined with mild infiltration
of inflammatory cells and 9 samples with moderate
infiltration of inflammatory cells. None of the sam-
ples were determined to have severe infiltration of
inflammatory cells.
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to determine whether ‘clinically
uninfected’ implants (implants not removed because
of infection) harboured microbes. We examined
implants and associated tissue from individuals
with no history, clinical or paraclinical signs of
implant infection. Based on the current diagnostic
criteria for prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) (4)
none of the subjects included in this study would
be categorized as having an active implant infec-
tion. The histopathological evaluation of the adja-
cent tissue of the included implants showed no or
little inflammatory infiltration which supports the
lack of active infection.
Although most of the bacteria and fungi identified
in the present study have previously been identified
as aetiological agents of implant infections (20–22),
none of the most common bacteria or fungi (e.g.,
Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Propionibac-
terium acnes and P. aeruginosa) were found. An
interesting observation was that significantly more
screws were found to be colonized compared to other
implants. The screws are often localized close to the
skin and in direct contact with both the implant and
the bone which provides several opportunities for
microbial colonization. Our findings are consistent
with studies that have investigated supposedly asep-
tic cases of revision arthroplasty and detected bacte-
ria by using PCR technology (8, 23). To our
knowledge this is the first study to have examined
post-mortem implants with regard to microbial colo-
nization of presumably uninfected implants. Post-
mortem microbiology is used in limited cases, pri-
marily in the explanation of Sudden Unexplained
Death Syndrome (SUDI) and Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS), causes of septic shock and in
forensic microbiology (12,24–27). The presence of
contaminating bacteria is possible when working
post-mortem, but has been shown to most likely be
due to contamination induced by the forensic staff or
post-mortem microbial transmigration (12). In addi-
tion, it was shown that there is no significant increase
in the number of positive findings as the PMI to sam-
pling increase. It is generally accepted that samples
taken before 48 h post-mortem will yield results of
acceptable quality if kept at 4 °C (12).
Sample contamination is a potential problem but
the procedures used to prevent sample contamina-
tion such as standard aseptic surgery techniques
alleviate this problem (28, 29). To elucidate whether
the detected microorganisms were truly inhabiting
the implants of the present study, we analysed 39
different sterile implant materials that had under-
gone
different
handling
procedures
identical
to
those used in this study. All control samples were
negative for bacteria and fungi, thus we are confi-
dent that our findings are not contamination. Our
detection limit determined in vitro was 104 microor-
ganisms thus we cannot rule out the presence of
microbes below this level.
One question our study raises is why the microbi-
ology of symptomatic infected implants are differ-
ent from the microbiome of uninfected implants.
We hypothesize that when sterile implants are
inserted a new niche is created for the “implant
microbiota” to colonize. In the event of infection
with a conventional pathogen, the implant micro-
biota may be eradicated or displaced by the newly
arrived pathogen or the pathogen-induced inflam-
matory response. This could explain why we do not
find the usual implant associated microorganisms
and why the microorganisms we find are not usu-
ally associated with PJI.
Our findings have several implications. Firstly,
they challenge guidelines and methods regarding
diagnosis of infections on implants because it opens
the possibility that bacteria and fungi might play a
part in what has hitherto been determined as non-
infection-related problems such as aseptic loosening
or fracture healing. Secondly, and with somewhat
contrary implications, the findings suggests that cer-
tain type of bacteria and fungi can be present on or
adjacent to implants seemingly without clinical
symptoms.
Thus,
the
study
not
only
provides
important methodological discussions on how we
diagnose infections, but simultaneously calls for
more analytical discussions on the very definition
of infections and the role of bacteria present in
human tissue around implants. Due to the absence
of inflammatory cells our study also propose that
the insertion of foreign bodies initiates a new niche
for a microbiota to arise generating a potential
implant microbiome, thus creating additional novel
symbiotic microbiomes within our body.
