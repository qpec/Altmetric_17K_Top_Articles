BACKGROUND: The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for 
primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus are still inconclusive.
METHODS: The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis 
With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–
controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular 
events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without 
preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to 
receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin 
group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with 
the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned 
therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden 
death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and 
peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, 
consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from 
any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for 
cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a 
per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted 
for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.
RESUL
TS: The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) 
were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their 
original allocation. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the 
per-protocol cohort (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.42). 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic 
control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed 
similar results (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.30), with no 
heterogeneity of efficacy in subgroup analyses stratified by each of these factors 
(all interaction P>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded 
consistent results (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.25). 
Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 
(0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (P=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke 
was not different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular 
events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.

iabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardio-
vascular events.1,2 Platelet activation plays a caus-
ative role in the development of cardiovascular 
events in the setting of type 2 diabetes mellitus in which 
platelet activation and aggregation are exaggerated.3–5 
Guidelines published in the early 2000s recommended 
the use of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in pa-
tients with diabetes mellitus over a certain age or in the 
presence of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors.6–8 
This recommendation was based largely on results from 
randomized clinical trials that showed a positive effect 
of low-dose aspirin in healthy volunteers,9–11 in patients 
with hypertension,12 and for secondary prevention in pa-
tients after myocardial infarction.13 During that period, 
however, very little evidence directly supported the use 
of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovas-
cular events in patients with diabetes mellitus.
In this context, we designed and conducted the JPAD 
trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis 
With Aspirin for Diabetes) to evaluate the efficacy of low-
dose aspirin on the primary prevention of cardiovascular 
events. The study population was 2539 Japanese pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were enrolled 
beginning in 2002, and we reported the original results 
in 2008 after a median follow-up of 4.4 years.14 Low-
dose aspirin therapy did not increase adverse events 
such as hemorrhagic stroke or gastrointestinal bleeding, 
and although the efficacy results were not statistically 
significantly different, the point estimate of the effect on 
the primary composite cardiovascular outcome was a 
20% reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.58–1.10).14 The reason why the JPAD trial 
results did not demonstrate a benefit of aspirin was un-
clear. Possible explanations included a lower observed 
event rate than expected, yielding limited statistical 
power and the chance for type II error, or that low-dose 
aspirin is not effective in reducing cardiovascular events 
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary pre-
vention setting.
In addition to the JPAD trial, another randomized 
clinical trial investigated the efficacy of low-dose aspi-
rin therapy on the primary prevention of cardiovascular 
events in patients with diabetes mellitus and likewise 
did not demonstrate the efficacy of aspirin, although 
its follow-up period was 6.7 years.15 After the results 
of these trials were published, guidelines were revised 
to de-emphasize the use of aspirin for primary cardio-
vascular disease risk prevention in diabetes mellitus.2,16 
Around the same time, it became evident that posttrial 
observational studies are useful to examine the effect 
of an intervention on the prevention of cardiovascular 
events because long-term follow-up can strengthen sta-
tistical power.17–19
With these findings taken into account, the follow-up 
of the JPAD trial was extended to elucidate the efficacy 
and safety of long-term therapy with low-dose aspirin in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS
The JPAD trial was a multicenter, randomized, standard care–
controlled, open-label, blinded end-point trial conducted at 163 
institutions throughout Japan to evaluate the effect of low-dose 
aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus and no preexisting cardiovascular diseases.14 
Patient enrollment in the JPAD trial started in December 2002 
and was completed in May 2005. After the JPAD trial was com-
pleted in April 2008, all patients were followed up biennially 
until July 2015. The JPAD trial and its follow-up period together 
constitute the JPAD2 study (Figure 1).
The JPAD trial and the JPAD2 study were performed 
according to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved 
by the ethics committee of each participating hospital (Nara 
Medical University Ethics Committee and Graduate School of 
Medical Science, Kumamoto University Ethics Committee). 
Written informed consent was obtained from each participant 
before participation in the JPAD trial. In the JPAD2 study, 
the revised study protocol was approved by each ethics 
committee (Nara Medical University Ethics Committee and 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In the median 10-year follow-up of the JPAD trial 
(Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis 
With Aspirin for Diabetes) and the JPAD2 study, long-
term therapy with low-dose aspirin did not affect car-
diovascular events in Japanese patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus and without preexisting atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease.
• In analyses stratified by age, sex, presence of 
hypertension and dyslipidemia, smoking status, 
hemoglobin A1c, and estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, there was no significant difference in the effi-
cacy of low-dose aspirin between the aspirin and no-
aspirin groups.
• Long-term therapy with low-dose aspirin increased 
the hazard for gastrointestinal bleeding, but no sig-
nificant differences in the incidence of hemorrhagic 
stroke were observed.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• On the basis of the absence of cardiovascular 
efficacy coupled with significantly increased gas-
trointestinal bleeding risk, low-dose aspirin is not 
recommended for Japanese patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus in the absence of prevalent athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease.
• Whether these findings are broadly applicable to 
other patient populations remains uncertain, with 
international trials presently underway evaluating the 
utility of low-dose aspirin for primary cardiovascular 
prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Graduate School of Medical Science, Kumamoto University 
Ethics Committee), and verbal informed consent was again 
obtained from each participant. The study protocol for the 
JPAD trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov with the identi-
fier NCT00110448.
Sample Size Calculations
In the design of the JPAD trial, it was estimated that 52 primary 
outcome events per 1000 patients would occur annually. On 
the basis of a 2-sided α level of 0.05, a power of 0.95, an 
enrollment period of 2 years, and a follow-up period of 3 years 
after the last enrollment, we estimated that 2450 patients 
would need to be enrolled to detect a 30% relative risk reduc-
tion in cardiovascular events by the low-dose aspirin therapy. A 
final total of 2539 patients were enrolled.
Study Patients
In the JPAD2 study, we recruited all patients who did not meet 
the primary end point of the JPAD trial. The JPAD inclusion 
criteria were diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, age of 30 
to 85 years, and ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion 
criteria were electrocardiographic abnormalities consisting of 
ischemic ST-segment depression, ST-segment elevation, or 
pathological Q waves; a history of coronary artery disease con-
firmed by coronary angiography; a history of cerebrovascular 
disease consisting of cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, or transient ischemic attack; a his-
tory of peripheral atherosclerotic disease necessitating medi-
cal treatment; atrial fibrillation; pregnancy; use of antiplatelet 
or antithrombotic therapy; a history of severe gastric or duode-
nal ulcer; severe liver dysfunction; severe kidney dysfunction; 
and allergy to aspirin.
Intervention
In the JPAD trial, patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to 
receive aspirin (either 81 mg unbuffered, uncoated aspirin 
or 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin daily; aspirin group) or no 
aspirin (no-aspirin group). The randomization was performed 
as nonstratified randomization from a random-number table. 
Personnel at the central trial coordinating center prepared 
sealed envelopes with random assignments and distributed 
them by mail to the physicians in charge at the study sites. All 
patients were allowed to undergo any concurrent treatments. 
At the end of the JPAD trial, patients were administered low-
dose aspirin therapy (at either 81 or 100 mg daily) according 
to the decision of each physician during the follow-up period. 
We checked whether the patients were administered low-dose 
aspirin in the biennial follow-ups.
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary and secondary end points were the time to first 
occurrence of any cardiovascular event during the JPAD trial or 
the JPAD2 extension study.
The primary end point was a composite of the following 
cardiovascular events: sudden death; death resulting from cor-
onary, cerebrovascular, and aortic causes; nonfatal acute myo-
cardial infarction; unstable angina; newly developed exertional 
angina; nonfatal ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke; transient 
ischemic attack; and nonfatal aortic and peripheral vascular 
disease.
The secondary end points were each cardiovascular event 
and the combinations of cardiovascular events as follows: 
Coronary artery events were a composite of death result-
ing from coronary causes, nonfatal acute myocardial infarc-
tion, unstable angina, and newly developed exertional angina. 
Cerebrovascular events were a composite of death resulting 
from cerebrovascular causes, nonfatal ischemic and hemor-
rhagic stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Vascular events

A, In the JPAD trial, patient enrollment started in December 
2002 and was completed in May 2005. After the JPAD trial 
was completed in April 2008, we followed up all patients 
meeting JPAD2 criteria until July 2015. The median total 
follow-up duration (JPAD trial+follow-up) was 10.3 years (95% 
confidence interval, 10.2–10.5). B, During the follow-up 
period, 270 patients in the aspirin group stopped taking low-
dose aspirin, and 109 patients in the no-aspirin group started 
taking aspirin. Overall, 2160 patients (85%) retained their 
original allocation for aspirin (the per-protocol cohort). They 
were included in the primary efficacy analysis for cardiovas-
cular events. Safety analysis was conducted for hemorrhagic 
events on the intention-to-treat cohort.

were a composite of death from aortic causes and nonfatal 
aortic and peripheral vascular disease.
Hemorrhagic events consisted of gastrointestinal bleeding, 
hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites.
All potential end points and hemorrhagic events were adju-
dicated by a central independent committee blinded to group 
assignments in the both the JPAD trial and the JPAD2 study.
Statistical Analyses
The primary analyses were based on the per-protocol prin-
ciple because the JPAD2 study was a follow-up study of the 
randomized controlled trial, and the decision to continue the 
original allocation was at the discretion of the patients and their 
physicians. Patients who withdrew the original allocation were 
excluded from the per-protocol analyses. As the sensitivity 
analyses, we conducted the primary analyses on the basis of 
the intention-to-treat principle according to original JPAD ran-
domization assignment to evaluate robustness.
Categorical variables are expressed as numbers and per-
centages. Continuous variables are expressed as mean±SD or 
median (interquartile range). On the basis of their distribution, 
continuous variables were compared by use of the Student t 
test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate.
We followed up the patients until the day of the first car-
diovascular event or July 2015 if patients did not have a 
cardiovascular event. If patients were not followed up until 
July 2015, they were censored on the day of their last visit. 
Efficacy comparisons were based on time to the first event. 
The cumulative incidence of each end point was estimated 
with the Kaplan-Meier method in each group, and differences 
between groups were assessed with the log-rank test. We 
constructed Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the 
HR and 95% CI of the efficacy of low-dose aspirin therapy in 
terms of the incidence of the composite primary end point. 
We developed multivariable Cox proportional hazard models 
adjusted for age, sex, baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), history of smoking, 
and presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia. These fac-
tors were considered to affect the incidence of cardiovas-
cular events in patients with diabetes mellitus on the basis 
of previous studies.20–22 In these models, age was dichoto-
mized by 65 years, and HbA1c was dichotomized by a median 
value of 7.2%. eGFR was calculated by a Japanese equation 
for eGFR23 and dichotomized by 60 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2. In 
subgroup analyses, we stratified the patients by age (≥65 or 
<65 years), sex, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia 
at baseline, smoking status (current/past smoking or not), 
baseline HbA1c (≥7.2% or <7.2%), and baseline eGFR (≥90, 
60–89, or <60 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2). We conducted interac-
tion analyses in each subgroup to evaluate heterogeneity.
Hemorrhagic events were analyzed on the intention-to-treat 
cohort because hemorrhagic events were major causes of 
discontinuing low-dose aspirin therapy. For adjusting the influ-
ence of age, presence of hypertension, and concomitant use 
of antiulcer medications, we developed multivariable Cox pro-
portional hazard models. To evaluate the effect of hemorrhagic 
events on discontinuing low-dose aspirin therapy, we also ana-
lyzed hemorrhagic events in the per-protocol cohort.
Statistical analyses were conducted by an independent 
statistician (T.M.) using JMP 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Two-tailed values of P<0.05 
were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The median follow-up period was 10.3 years (95% CI, 
10.2–10.5), and 1621 patients (64%) were followed up 
until the day of the first cardiovascular event or July 2015 
(Figure 1). During the follow-up period, 270 patients in the 
aspirin group stopped taking low-dose aspirin, and 109 pa-
tients in the no-aspirin group started taking aspirin. These 
379 patients (15%) were excluded from the per-protocol 
analysis at the time their aspirin treatment changed, and 
2160 patients (85%) who retained their original allocation 
were included in the per-protocol analysis.
Baseline Characteristics in the Aspirin and No-
Aspirin Groups
Baseline characteristics are presented by initial random-
ized treatment assignment in Table 1. The mean age of 
the entire population at baseline was 65±10 years, and 
55% of the patients were men. The mean body mass 
index was 24±4 kg/m2. The median duration of diabe-
tes mellitus was 7.1 years. The prevalence of diabetic 
microvascular complications was 15% for retinopathy, 
13% for nephropathy, and 12% for neuropathy. Hyper-
tension and dyslipidemia were present in more than half 
of the patients (hypertension, 58%; dyslipidemia, 53%). 
Mean levels of HbA1c and eGFR were 7.5±1.3% and 
74.1±20.6 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2, respectively.
In the per-protocol cohort, there were slight but signifi-
cant differences between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups 
in terms of age, blood pressure, HbA1c, and creatinine at 
baseline (Table 1). The aspirin group was older and had 
higher blood pressure; however, the prevalence of hyper-
tension was not significantly different between the groups. 
The HbA1c level was higher in the aspirin group. The creati-
nine level was slightly higher in the aspirin group, but eGFR 
was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
We analyzed the differences in baseline characteristics 
between patients who were followed up through the entire 
study duration and those who discontinued early or were 
lost to follow-up. There were no overt differences between 
the groups (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
The Efficacy of Low-Dose Aspirin Therapy on 
Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
A total of 317 cardiovascular events occurred in the 
overall population (aspirin group, 151 events; no-aspirin 
group, 166 events; Table 2). The incidence of the prima-
ry end point was not significantly different between the 
aspirin and no-aspirin groups (log-rank P=0.2; Figure 2), 
and the HR of aspirin was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.91–1.42).

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling also 
showed no difference in the incidence of the primary 
end point between groups (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 
0.83–1.30; Table 3). The cardiovascular events com-
prised 125 coronary artery events, 133 cerebrovascu-
lar events, and 45 vascular events. There were no sig-
nificant differences in any of the secondary end points 
between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups (Table 2).
In patients who switched their original allocation for 
aspirin, 16 patients (6%) of the aspirin group and 5 pa-
tients (5%) of the no-aspirin group had the primary end 
points. Sensitivity analyses using intention-to-treat meth-
ods showed similar results (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82–
1.25; log-rank P=0.9; Figure 3). The number (incidence) 
of occurrences of the primary end point were 167 (16.5 
per 1000 person-years) in the aspirin group and 171 
(16.3 per 1000 person-years) in the no-aspirin group.

to-treat cohort are presented in Table II in the online-only

smoking status, baseline HbA1c, and baseline eGFR. In all 
subgroups, there were no significant differences in the 
efficacy of low-dose aspirin therapy between the aspirin 
and no-aspirin groups (Figure 4). The interaction analyses 
showed no heterogeneity of efficacy in all subgroups.
Hemorrhagic Events
We analyzed hemorrhagic events on the intention-to-treat 
cohort to avoid underestimation of the adverse events 
owing to low-dose aspirin because the low-dose aspirin 
therapy was often stopped in patients who experienced 
hemorrhagic events. In the present study, 13 of 270 pa-
tients who stopped taking low-dose aspirin in the aspirin 
group had a gastrointestinal bleeding event, although no 
patients did among 109 patients who started taking low-
dose aspirin originally assigned to the no-aspirin group.
Overall, hemorrhagic events occurred in 80 patients 
(6%) in the aspirin group and 67 patients (5%) in the no-
aspirin group (P=0.2; Table 4). Gastrointestinal bleed-
ing occurred more frequently in the aspirin group (aspi-
rin group, 25 events [2%]; no-aspirin group, 12 events 
[0.9%]; P=0.03); however, there were no significant dif-
ferences in the frequency of hemorrhagic stroke (aspirin 
group, 11 events [0.9%]; no-aspirin group, 15 events 
[1.2%]; P=0.4). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard 
modeling, adjusted for age, presence of hypertension, 
and concomitant use of antiulcer medications, also 
showed that low-dose aspirin increased the incidence 
of gastrointestinal bleeding (adjusted HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 
1.10–4.42; P=0.03) but did not affect the incidence of 
total hemorrhagic events (adjusted HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 
0.88–1.69; P=0.2) and hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted 
HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.32–1.55; P=0.4).
The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was not 
statistically different between the aspirin and no-aspirin 
groups in the per-protocol cohort (Table IV in the online-
only Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
After the JPAD trial was completed in 2008, 2160 pa-
tients (85%) retained their original allocation for low-dose 
aspirin. The JPAD2 study showed that over the 10-year 
trial plus posttrial follow-up, low-dose aspirin therapy

did not reduce cardiovascular events in Japanese pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no preexisting 
cardiovascular diseases. Hemorrhagic stroke was not 
increased by the low-dose aspirin therapy, but gastroin-
testinal bleeding occurred more frequently in the aspirin 
group. Both the JPAD trial and the JPAD2 study showed 
consistent results for the lack of efficacy of aspirin on 
primary prevention of cardiovascular events. Long-term 
follow-up results were consistent with the randomized 
trial findings that low-dose aspirin is not effective in re-
ducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus without prevalent atherosclerotic vascular 
disease.
In general populations, previous clinical trials for 
primary prevention with aspirin have demonstrated the 
beneficial effects of aspirin on preventing cardiovascu-
lar events.9–11,24 Recent meta-analyses also indicated 
the benefit of aspirin for primary prevention, especially 
in people with high cardiovascular risk.25,26 According 
to these results, low-dose aspirin is beneficial for pri-
mary prevention in general populations. Recently, the 
US Preventive Services Task Force recommended low-
dose aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardio-
vascular events in adults 50 to 59 years of age who 
have a ≥10% 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and 
are not at increased risk for bleeding.27 In patients with 
diabetes mellitus, however, the JPAD2 study could not 
demonstrate the benefit of aspirin for primary preven-
tion. Meta-analyses in patients with diabetes mellitus 
have reported that aspirin has a smaller benefit for pri-
mary prevention than in general populations,26,28,29 al-
though patients with diabetes mellitus are at high risk 
for cardiovascular events. It seems that there are differ-
ential effects of low-dose aspirin therapy on preventing 
cardiovascular events in patients with and without dia-
betes mellitus. Platelet dysfunction,5 increased platelet 
turnover,30 or aspirin resistance31,32 in diabetes mellitus 
might diminish the benefit of aspirin, although the pre-
cise mechanism is not clear at present. Increased dose 
of aspirin and twice-daily low-dose aspirin therapy could 
be possible therapeutic options for cardiovascular pre-
vention in patients with diabetes mellitus, but the clinical 
implication of these aspirin regimens remains uncertain 
in the absence of data from randomized trials assessing 
such strategies.33
A possible cause of the negative result in the JPAD2 
study was the progress of preventive medicines such 
as the development and clinical prescription of intense-
dose statins. Most evidence for the value of aspirin 
therapy for primary prevention was documented in the 
20th century,9,10,12,24 when intense-dose statins were not 
yet widely used, clinical targets of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol level were not as aggressive as contempo-
rary practice, smoking was more prevalent, and blood 
pressure was not intensively controlled. Recent clinical 
trials, including the JPAD trial, could not demonstrate the 
efficacy of aspirin in the setting of primary prevention for 
patients with or without diabetes mellitus.14,15,34,35 State-
of-the-art medicines might make it difficult to detect the 
efficacy of low-dose aspirin therapy on primary preven-
tion of cardiovascular events in the present day.
Overall, hemorrhagic events occurred numerically 
more frequently in the aspirin group, although the ab-
solute difference over the median 10.3-year follow-up

was only 1%, with gastrointestinal bleeding statistically 
more frequent in the aspirin group with an absolute dif-
ference of 1.1%. In the JPAD trial, there were 12 cases 
(1.0%) of gastrointestinal bleeding in the aspirin group 
and 4 (0.3%) in the no-aspirin group, but the difference 
was not statistically significant. Prolonged therapy with 
low-dose aspirin and aging of the study patients might 
increase gastrointestinal bleeding caused by aspirin.36 A 
previous meta-analysis of hemorrhagic events with aspi-
rin therapy revealed that low-dose aspirin increased the 
frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding, and comorbidity 
with diabetes mellitus was a significant risk.37 A popula-
tion-based study of aspirin-related bleeding showed that 
aspirin did not increase gastrointestinal bleeding even 
in patients with diabetes mellitus, although patients with 
diabetes mellitus had a higher rate of bleeding than 
those without diabetes mellitus.38 In the JPAD2 study, 
long-term follow-up revealed that low-dose aspirin cer-
tainly increased the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding in 
patients with diabetes mellitus.
A chemopreventive effect of aspirin on cancer has 
been suggested by a series of observations over the 
past few decades, as has been recently reviewed.39 
Results from several meta-analyses demonstrated that 
long-term therapy with low-dose aspirin is beneficial for 
prevention of cancer, especially colorectal cancer.40,41 
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommended 
the use of low-dose aspirin therapy for prevention of 
colorectal cancer in selected patients.27 In the JPAD trial, 
we reported that low-dose aspirin therapy tended to re-
duce deaths caused by cancer with a median follow-up 
of 4.4 years (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.40–1.57).42 We are 
planning to analyze the long-term efficacy of low-dose 
aspirin on cancer prevention in the JPAD2 study, but 
those data are not currently available.
The strength of the JPAD2 study was long duration 
(median, 10.3 years) of follow-up (JPAD trial+follow-up), 
the importance of the clinical question, and the sys-
tematic collection/central blinded adjudication of the 
primary cardiovascular outcomes. On the other hand, 
there are several limitations. First, the JPAD2 study was 
a follow-up study of a randomized controlled trial. We 
used per-protocol analyses instead of intention-to-treat 
analyses because the JPAD2 study was not a random-
ized study but a cohort study. However, per-protocol 
analyses compromise to some degree randomization 
that is captured more accurately in intention-to-treat 
methods, especially in the present context in which the 
occurrence of either a cardiovascular event or a bleed-
ing event would affect clinical prescription for aspirin 
and introduce informed censoring into the analyses. 
In fact, 270 patients, including 13 patients with gas-
trointestinal bleeding, stopped taking low-dose aspirin 
in the aspirin group, and 109 patients, including 5 pa-
tients with cardiovascular events, started taking low-
dose aspirin in the no-aspirin group during the follow-
up. Consequently, the remaining 2160 patients who 
retained their original allocation for aspirin were ana-
lyzed in the per-protocol setting. However, there were 
slight but significant differences in baseline character-
istics between the per-protocol aspirin and no-aspirin 
groups (Table 1). We conducted a multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard model on the per-protocol cohort 
that adjusted for important confounders (Table 3). In 
addition, we performed sensitivity analyses using the 
Kaplan-Meier method (Figure 3) and multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard modeling (Table III in the online-on-
ly Data Supplement) using the intention-to-treat cohort. 
These analyses yielded consistent results. Second, a 
substantial portion of patients (36%) were not followed 
up throughout the study period. As described in Meth-
ods, these patients were censored on the day of their 
last visit. The baseline characteristics were similar be-
tween patients who discontinued early or were lost to 
follow-up and those who were followed up throughout 
the study, as shown in Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Third, the prescription of low-dose aspirin 
might have been revised on the basis of the results 
of the original JPAD trial. For example, we reported 
the potential benefit of low-dose aspirin therapy for pa-
tients ≥65 years of age in the subgroup analysis of the 
JPAD trial.14 In the per-protocol cohort of the JPAD2 
study, the prescription frequencies of low-dose aspirin 
were 50% in patients ≥65 years of age and 42% in 
those <65 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS
The posttrial follow-up of the JPAD trial, comprising a 
mean observation during and after the trial of >1 de-
cade, indicated that long-term therapy with low-dose as-
pirin is not associated with lower cardiovascular events 
in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a 
primary prevention setting. On the other hand, low-dose 
aspirin therapy was associated with and significantly in-
creased the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
