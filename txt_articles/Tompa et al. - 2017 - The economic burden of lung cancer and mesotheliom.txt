Objectives To estimate the economic burden of lung 
cancer and mesothelioma due to occupational and para-
occupational asbestos exposure in Canada.
Methods We estimate the lifetime cost of newly 
diagnosed lung cancer and mesothelioma cases 
associated with occupational and para-occupational 
asbestos exposure for calendar year 2011 based on the 
societal perspective. The key cost components considered 
are healthcare costs, productivity and output costs, and 
quality of life costs.
results There were 427 cases of newly diagnosed 
mesothelioma cases and 1904 lung cancer cases 
attributable to asbestos exposure in 2011 for a total 
of 2331 cases. Our estimate of the economic burden 
is $C831 million in direct and indirect costs for newly 
identified cases of mesothelioma and lung cancer and 
$C1.5 billion in quality of life costs based on a value of 
$C100 000 per quality-adjusted life year. This amounts to 
$C356 429 and $C652 369 per case, respectively.
conclusions The economic burden of lung cancer 
and mesothelioma associated with occupational and 
para-occupational asbestos exposure is substantial. 
The estimate identified is for 2331 newly diagnosed, 
occupational and para-occupational exposure cases in 
2011, so it is only a portion of the burden of existing 
cases in that year. Our findings provide important 
information for policy decision makers for priority 
setting, in particular the merits of banning the mining 
of asbestos and use of products containing asbestos in 
countries where they are still allowed and also the merits 
of asbestos removal in older buildings with asbestos 
insulation.
IntrOductIOn
There is a growing interest in better under-
standing the extent of occupational cancers and 
their economic burden to society; yet, few such 
economic burden studies have been performed. A 
WHO report1 noted that relatively little has been 
published worldwide on the costing of asbestos-re-
lated diseases. It also noted a great variety in meth-
odological approaches used in studies. There are 
several key challenges to advancing the evidence 
base on the burden of asbestos-related diseases, 
namely, the uncertainty of conceptual issues, lack 
of standardised methodology and limited data 
availability.
Nonetheless, several studies have been under-
taken that consider the economic burden of all 
or specific occupational injuries and illnesses in 
various jurisdictions. Leigh has completed some 
on the economic burden of occupational injuries 
and illnesses in the USA.2 3 Similar studies have 
been undertaken for Australia,4 Singapore5 and 
Britain.6 In Canada, a more broadly cast series of 
studies on the economic burden of illness (both 
work and non-work related) have been undertaken 
by Health Canada7 and the Public Health Agency 
of Canada.8 A study by Lebeau et al focused exclu-
sively on occupational injuries and illnesses in 
Quebec.9 Several Canadian studies have focused 
on specific jurisdictions and types of health issues, 
such as occupational cancers in Alberta10 and 
skin cancer in Canada.11 The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC Foundation) and 
the American Heart Association regularly publish 
estimates on the burden of cardiovascular disease

(eg, 12, 13). These are only a sampling of studies we surveyed in 
the development of the methods for this analysis.
Though asbestos is an established human carcinogen, we 
were unable to find any peer-reviewed economic burden study 
on occupational cancer and/or mesothelioma attributable to 
asbestos exposure. In response to the absence of published 
studies, the WHO study prepared preliminary tables of compo-
nents of the burden for several European countries (see Annex 
5 in Ref. 1). One study by Driscoll et al identifies worldwide 
deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to 
lung cancer, leukaemia and malignant mesothelioma caused by 
workplace exposure including asbestos.14 Another study consid-
ered only the health service treatment costs for asbestos-related 
mesothelioma death in Scotland.15 
The lack of economic burden studies on occupational expo-
sure to asbestos is likely due to data challenges. Specifically, the 
long latency period from exposure to onset makes it difficult 
to identify attributable fractions required to estimate cases asso-
ciated with occupational exposure. In particular, lung cancer 
attributable to asbestos exposure poses a challenge, since unlike 
mesothelioma, such cases are clinically indistinguishable from 
lung cancers attributable to other types of exposures.16 
Though economic burden studies do not measure the prob-
ability of success of options to abate exposure or the opportu-
nity costs of interventions that might be undertaken to reduce 
the burden, they serve an important information role.17 They 
provide insights into the magnitudes of health and productivity 
loss and their costs to society. This information can be used to 
assess how the burden may have changed over time or how a 
burden from a particular health condition compares to other 
burdens. It can also help decision makers with priority setting. 
Burdens that appear particularly onerous may bring attention to 
the need to (1) increase funding for intervention options known 
to reduce the burden, (2) evaluate the merits (in terms of health 
resource implications) of burden reduction efforts from known 
alternatives that have not yet been evaluated, and (3) invest in 
research to discover options to reduce the burden in cases where 
no effective options have yet been identified. With regard to 
occupationally related asbestos exposure, much effort has been 
made by advocates to introduce legislation banning the mining 
of asbestos and importing, manufacturing or using products 
that contain asbestos. In such cases, information on the societal 
economic burden of illness associated with asbestos exposure 
can help inform the merits of such efforts.
Burden estimates are typically reported for a specific calendar 
year and are sometimes based on costs in that year for all individ-
uals diagnosed with or living with a particular condition. These 
aggregate costs are also referred to as prevalence costs, because 
they encompass costs for individuals across the illness trajectory, 
including new cases and individuals who have been disabled for 
a long time. Burden studies can also cost incidents longitudinally, 
starting from onset, and only include new cases. The time period 
for these longitudinal or incidence cost studies ranges from 
several months to the individual’s lifetime. These two general 
types of burden studies are not directly comparable, because of 
differences in the time periods measured and cases included.
In this study, we use the incidence cost approach to estimate the 
economic burden for Canadian society in the calendar year 2011 
of newly diagnosed lung cancer and mesothelioma cases attrib-
utable to occupational and para-occupational asbestos exposure. 
We use the term para-occupational to refer to cases in which the 
afflicted individual was not exposed through work, but through 
a family member who brought asbestos fibres into the home 
from work, sometimes described as ‘take-home’ exposure.18 We 
consider mesothelioma and lung cancer together, as they are the 
two most prevalent cancer-type diseases associated with occupa-
tional asbestos exposure.
Our estimates consider lifetime costs incurred by all stake-
holders associated with each new case. The key question 
addressed by this analysis is: What would be the saving to society 
if we did not have any cases of lung cancer or mesothelioma in 
2011 attributable to occupational or para-occupational asbestos 
exposures? Essentially, the estimated costs reflect the differ-
ence between a counterfactual scenario (ie, the road not taken), 
compared with the current scenario.
MethOdOlOgy
Counts of newly identified lung cancer and mesothelioma cases 
in 2011 attributable to occupational asbestos exposure were 
estimated by several members of our research team using an 
approach similar to the one used by the United Kingdom Burden 
of Occupational Cancer Study,19 but updated for the Canadian 
context. Asbestos is the only known cause of mesothelioma, 
and we attributed a proportion of the total number of incident 
mesothelioma cases in Canada to workplace asbestos exposure 
based on a review of population-based case–control studies of 
lung cancer that assessed workplace asbestos exposure. We esti-
mated that 85% of mesothelioma cases among men and 40% 
of mesothelioma cases among women occurred from workplace 
asbestos exposure. In addition, we estimated that 20% of female 
mesothelioma cases were due to para-occupational exposure. 
We also performed a meta-analysis of the ratio of excess lung 
cancer cases for every case of mesothelioma observed in cohorts 
of asbestos-exposed workers using methods similar to those 
reported by McCormack et al,16 but used the ratio derived from 
North American studies. We applied this ratio to our estimates 
of attributable mesothelioma cases to arrive at our estimates of 
occupational asbestos-attributable lung cancers. A fact sheet on 
these Canadian estimates has been prepared by the Occupational 
Cancer Research Centre (OCRC) and CAREX Canada.20
For our economic burden estimates, we consider three key 
cost categories—direct costs (primarily healthcare products and 
services), indirect costs (primarily output and productivity in paid 
work and in home production) and quality of life costs (social 
role engagement and the intrinsic value of health). Figure 1 
provides a schema for our conceptualisation of health values at 
the individual level. The schema delineates the value of health at 
the individual level for labour-market earning purposes and the 
value of health for social role engagement and the intrinsic value 
of health. The distinction is important to our methodological 
approach, since we estimate health impacts on labour-market 
output and productivity (labelled as indirect costs) separately 
from health impacts on social role functions (labelled quality of

life costs). We also estimate the value of home production sepa-
rately. The approach has precedence in the economic burden 
and health-technology assessment literatures,21 where health-re-
lated quality of life measure are key outcomes considered when 
assessing the merits of different treatment paradigms. Other 
recent studies in the occupational health field have also included 
the health-related quality of life costs as a distinct component 
(eg, Ref. 9). WHO also emphasises the importance of considering 
social costs in burden studies, as well as pain and suffering.1 This 
is particularly relevant with older populations, since many are 
not in the labour force. In such cases, a focus on loss of labour-
market earnings may distort the burden measurement.
We estimated total lifetime costs of newly diagnosed cases in 
2011 incurred by all stakeholders (ie, the societal level economic 
burden), discounting all costs to the 2011 calendar year, using a 
3% discount rate. Figure 2 provides an overview of costs by four 
key stakeholder groups: (1) individual, (2) family and commu-
nity, (3) employer and (3) system and public sector. The societal 
level perspective is simply an aggregation of costs incurred by 
all stakeholders, with adjustments made to ensure no double 
counting. Some values drop out of the aggregation, specifi-
cally with transfer payments such as wage replacement benefits 
provided by insurance programs, since in such cases a cost to one 
stakeholder is simply a benefit to another. The italicised items 
are cost categories that were not included in our computations, 
even though they are relevant impacts. They are not quantified 
due to methodological and data limitations.
We provide a summary of the estimation of the three key 
components—direct, indirect and quality of life costs. Details 
are provided in the online supplementary Appendix 1.
direct costs
Our starting point for estimating direct costs was the healthcare 
costs of lung cancer by type and stage identified via the Cana-
dian Cancer Risk Management Model (CRMM).22 The model 
also provided data on survival probabilities. The CRMM only 
had treatment costs for lung cancer, so we turned to data from a 
Canadian workers’ compensation board to estimate the cost of 
mesothelioma treatment. Treatment costs are generally higher 
in the workers’ compensation system than the public healthcare 
system in Canada due to premiums they pay for these services. 
To account for this, we used the average healthcare costs for lung 
cancer in the Canadian public healthcare system to estimate the 
cost for mesothelioma by proportionally adjusting it based on 
relative costs of mesothelioma versus lung cancer identified in 
data from the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.23 
For mesothelioma survival, we used data from the US Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry (http:// 
seer. 
cancer. 
gov/ 
registries/). To these costs, we added healthcare 
administration in the amount of 16.7%.24 These administration 
costs are presented separately along with workers’ compensa-
tion administration costs. A fraction of the occupational cases 
(but no para-occupational cases) would also be claimed through 
the Canadian workers’ compensation system. We estimated the 
proportion of cases in that system to be 54% for mesothelioma 
and 10% for lung cancer.25 Healthcare and administration costs 
are higher in workers’ compensation, so we used higher rates for 
those proportions based on data from the Ontario Workplace 
Safety and Insurance Board.23 For these administrative costs, 
we used 27% (Association of Workers Compensation Boards 
of Canada, http:// 
awcbc. 
org/), which was applied to both direct 
expenses and transfer payments, even though transfer payments 
were not included in the final cost estimates.
Other costs estimated for the direct cost component included 
family and community time in caregiving and out-of-pocket 
costs for travel to receive care, parking, pharmaceuticals, home 
healthcare and accommodation. These costs were estimated as an 
aggregate in two parts, time costs and out-of-pocket costs, rather 
than estimating each item individually. We assumed 16 
hours of 
caregiving time per week.26 Caregiving time was valued at the 
weighted average provincial minimum wage. To project future 
minimum wage rates, we increased the average by 2% per year 
after calendar year 2015. Out-of-pocket costs were estimated to 
be $C548 per month.27 Both caregiving and out-of-pocket costs 
were assumed to increase at 2% per year over a 10-year period 
and were adjusted for survival probabilities for that period.
Indirect costs
To estimate output and productivity costs, we used both the 
human capital and friction cost approaches similar to other 
recent studies.4 5 Societal level output and productivity costs 
were based on the former. We considered the wage of the indi-
vidual and the amount of work time lost due to poor health or 
premature death using survival probabilities from the Canadian 
CRMM and the SEER Registry, which provided survival proba-
bilities for 10 
year following diagnosis. Year-to-year, age-specific

survival was assumed to be similar to general population after 
10 years. Data on labour-force participation following diagnosis 
was based on Earle et al. 28 For labour-market earnings, we used 
the average for working Canadians adjusted for age and sex, 
which we drew from the Canadian Labour Force Survey from 
2011 and the Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics 
from 2010. We assumed a productivity growth rate of 1% per 
year. To these values, we added 14% to account for payroll costs 
paid by employers, based on employer contribution data from 
the Canadian National Accounts.
To estimate employer replacement costs of ill workers, we use 
a variant of the friction cost approach.29 This approach is meant 
to estimate employer’s short-term cost of production distur-
bances associated with employee turnover, which may include 
costs such as search expenses, management time for interview 
time, and reduced productivity of the new hire during the 
training period. We estimated this production disturbance cost 
as 50% of 6 
months wage of the worker being replaced. These 
costs were assumed to be incurred in the year of diagnosis.
Home production costs were estimated only for mortality, 
not morbidity (ie, home production values foregone only after 
death). The exclusion of home production costs for morbidity 
cases invariably results in an underestimate of these costs (Leigh, 
p746).2 Drawing on data from Statistics Canada’s General Social 
Survey from 2005, we identified average daily hours of home 
production by sex and 10-year age bracket for individuals iden-
tifying time spent in home production and multiplied this by 
365 to estimate yearly hours. For sensitivity analysis, we consid-
ered the average daily hours of home production by sex and 
10-year age bracket for all individuals (see online supplementary 
Appendix 1 for details). To estimate monetary values, we used 
the wage rate for housekeepers and related occupations (occupa-
tion code 4412) from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and 
Hours (SEPH). No payroll costs were added to this rate, and 
productivity was assumed to be constant over time.
Quality of life costs
Health-related quality of life costs were captured with qual-
ity-adjusted life years (QALYs). This is a preference-based 
measure that combines the morbidity in a particular health state 
and time in that state by means of a weight that is between zero 
(death) and one (a year in perfect health). Conceptually, QALYs 
are constructed such that they do not include consideration of 
earnings from labour-market activity or other sources; hence, 
this fact allows us to capture output and productivity impacts 
separately as we have described above. Since there is some 
controversy about overlap, we present these estimates separately, 
as well as including them in the total burden.
QALY weights and conditional life expectancies for cases were 
drawn from the Canadian CRMM, the SEER Registry and Arnold 
et al.30 Health-related quality of life and year-to-year age-spe-
cific survival is assumed to be similar to general population after 
10 years. Case QALYs were compared with population average 
QALYs (drawn from the 2010 Canadian Community Health 
Survey), adjusted for age, sex and population life expectancy, 
the latter based on the 2009–2011 Canada Life Tables (details 
provided in the online supplementary Appendix 1) QALYs for 
2012 onwards were discounted to 2011 calendar year using a 
3% discount rate.
The health policy and contingent-valuation literatures offer 
a range of monetary values for a QALY. 21 31–34 We used $C 
100 
000, which is in the mid-range of the values identified in 
these literatures. We also undertook sensitivity here, given that it 
was the largest of the three key components, by using $C 50 
000 
and $C 25 
000 for a QALY. The former value was commonly 
used in the Canadian health technology assessment field in the 
1990s. It is still a reference threshold, but because it is static 
in time (not updated since 1992), it is now more of a lower 
bound threshold. Neumann et al note that there is no accepted 
standard for what constitutes a good value, although the range 
from $C50 
000 to $C100 
000 per QALY has often been used as 
a rough benchmark in the USA. 35
results
There were 427 cases of newly diagnosed mesothelioma cases 
and 1904 lung cancer cases attributable to asbestos exposure 
in 2011, for a total of 2331 cases. Fifty-seven of the mesothe-
lioma cases were women, 38 of which were occupational and 
19 para-occupational. Of the 2331 cases, 90% were men and 
10% women. In terms of the age distribution of these cases, 
most (90%) were 60 years or older. Consequently, lost labour-
market output and productivity was not a large component of 
the total burden, as might be expected if the cohort was younger. 
Since many countries are extending age of retirement to late 60s 
and even 70, future burden studies may take this phenomenon 
into consideration. In our case, we have used historical labour-
market engagement/earnings and retirement patterns, so it is not 
factored into our results.
Both mesothelioma and lung cancer have poor survival prog-
nosis, though survival probabilities are higher for lung cancer. 
Survival through the first year is 42.4% for mesothelioma and 
46.4% for lung cancer. For 10 years, it is 4.2% and 9.1%. 
As a result, healthcare costs are low for mesothelioma, since 
many individuals die shortly after diagnosis and treatment is 
often focused on palliative care. Though survival probabilities 
factor  into direct, indirect and quality of life costs for cases, the 
biggest impact is on loss of quality of life and its related mone-
tary value.
Tables 1 and 2 provide breakdowns of the economic burden. 
For mesothelioma, the total societal burden is $C482 
million or 
$C1 130 398 per case, with direct and indirect costs comprising 
39% and quality of life costs 61%. For lung cancer, the total 
societal burden is $C1 869 
million or $C981 
576 per case, with 
direct and indirect costs comprising 34% and quality of life costs 
66%. The total combined burden sums to $C2 352 
million. 
These estimates are based on the value of $C100 
000 for a QALY.
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken with values of $C50 
000 
and $C25 
000 for a QALY. With the $C50 
000 value, the 
total burden of mesothelioma is $C334 
million and for lung 
cancer $C1 257 
million, for a total of $C1 591 
million. With 
the $C25 
000 value, the total burden of mesothelioma is 
$C260 
million and for lung cancer $C951 
million, for a total 
of $C1 211 
million. Given that the quality of life component is 
the largest part of the burden, the value placed on a QALY has 
important impact on the total burden. In this case, using a more 
conservative estimate, the total burden dropped to 67.6% of the 
original estimate with the $C50 
000 value and to 51.5% with the 
$C25 
000 value.
An alternative way to avoid double counting is to subtract 
values that may be double counted, in this case the productivity 
and output costs. If we exclude these, the total burden of meso-
thelioma is $C365 
million and for lung cancer $C1371 
million, 
for a total of $C1736 
million.
We also undertook sensitivity analysis for home production, 
using more modest values of daily hours of time use, since 
average home production hours are somewhat higher than a

US study by Grosse et al.36  Revised burden estimates for home 
production are 13% lower $C179 
605 per case for mesothe-
lioma and $C163 
061 for lung cancer.
dIscussIOn
Our estimate of the economic burden of illness in Canada attrib-
utable to occupational asbestos exposure is $C831 
million in 
direct and indirect costs for newly identified cases of mesothe-
lioma and lung cancer in 2011 and $C1.521 
billion in quality of 
life costs based on a value of $C100 
000 per QALY. This amounts 
to $C356 
429 and $C652 
369 per case, respectively. Our esti-
mate of the economic burden of illness is $C2.352 
billion for 
newly identified cases of mesothelioma and lung cancer in 2011. 
To put it into perspective, the Canadian economy had a gross 
domestic product of $C1.8 
trillion that year, so the burden 
identified represents 0.131% of this amount. Though this frac-
tion may not seem large, the monetary amount is nonetheless 
substantive, particularly given that it is only newly diagnosed 
cases and a conservative estimate of the incidence of illness and 
related costs due to asbestos exposure. We did not consider other 
illnesses known to be attributable to asbestos exposure such as 
pleural plaque and several other cancers, nor have we included 
non-occupational exposure cases.
Our estimates are of value to current efforts to reduce occu-
pational and non-occupational asbestos exposure in Canada and 
may also be of value to other countries in this regard. Though 
the last asbestos mines in Canada were closed in 2011, expo-
sure through the import and use of products containing asbestos 
continues, particularly in the construction industry. There is no 
ban on the import and use of such products, though there are 
some regulations on their use. Additionally, there is an accu-
mulation of asbestos in the built environment such as schools, 
hospitals and homes from more than a century of its use in 
construction. There is currently no systematic approach taken 
at the national level to document the level of exposure in the 
Canadian population. The WHO report (2013) also notes that 
asbestos continues to present a public health risk in Europe and 
that the recognition, diagnosis and recording of asbestos-related 
diseases remain a challenge in many countries.1
Administrative records for workers’ compensation boards 
across Canada indicate that work-related fatalities from meso-
thelioma are on the rise and may continued to grow in the near 
future (Associate of Workers’ Compensation Boards of Canada, 
www. 
awcbc. 
ca), so the economic burden is likely to increase as 
well. Between 2007 and 2012, there were 1207 fatalities. In 
fact, mesothelioma was the most common cause of work-re-
lated fatalities during this time period. We note also that in our 
estimates, we did not include transfer payment to claimants and 
their families; yet, this is a cost incurred by employers and factors 
into their cost of doing business. The average cost of a workers’ 
compensation claim for mesothelioma provides some insights 
into the magnitude of such costs—in Ontario it is $C532 
844. 
This estimate does not include litigation costs incurred by the 
insurance providers, employers and other stakeholders.
Our study is the first academic study we are aware of that has 
estimated the societal-level economic burden of illness associated 
with occupational and para-occupational asbestos exposure. We 
have been inclusive of costs borne by different stakeholders and 
have considered three broad categories of costs—direct, indi-
rect and quality of life costs. Our effort can serve academics

and policy makers seeking to inform policy decision-making 
processes in other countries, as it provides a methodological 
platform for them to quantify the economic burden of asbestos 
exposure in their jurisdictions.
In our review of the literature, we noted that there are different 
cost considerations used to estimate burdens, and this is likely 
due to a lack of standardisation in the form of a reference case 
(ie, a set of methodological criteria, based on professional scien-
tific consensus, to serve as a best practice guidelines and referred 
to when undertaking such analyses). There is a convention in 
published burden estimates to include the sum of medical and 
productivity costs. In fact, most studies contain these compo-
nents and many contain only these. But how these components 
are estimated and their underlying assumptions can vary dramat-
ically. For example, some use the human capital approach to esti-
mate productivity impacts, others the friction cost approach, and 
yet others willingness-to-pay or statistical value of human life 
approaches.1 Furthermore, there is lack of consensus on if and 
how to include the social cost of illness and health-related quality 
of life measures. But as noted in the WHO report ‘loss of earn-
ings does not accurately reflect the social cost of illness’ (WHO, 
p54).1 The primary benefit of standardisation is that it ensures 
studies are based on sound economic principles and makes 
the results of different studies more readily comparable. This, 
in turn, can facilitate the uptake of evidence by policymakers. 
Ideally, a reference case allows for deviation from prescriptions 
when necessary, as for example due to data limitations, as long 
as justification is provided for such deviations.
We note that the valuation of health in social role functions 
is a particular area of measurement that varies across economic 
burden and evaluation studies. Some studies use QALYs (or 
another health-related quality of life measure), particularly 
in the health technology field, others use contingent valua-
tion methods (eg, environmental field), and yet others use the 
statistical value of health and life (eg, transportation industry). 
The conversion of non-monetary health measure to mone-
tary estimates is also an issue. For our estimates, we used a 
mid-range value of $C100 000 for a QALY and also undertook 
sensitivity analysis, using lower values to identify more conser-
vative estimates.
Going forward, researchers working in the health and safety 
policy arena might consider focusing on both further devel-
oping economic burden and economic evaluation methods in 
this field (including the development of a reference case or 
gold standard) and promoting their application for the evalu-
ation of burdens and intervention alternatives to abate them. 
Our study and the related appendix (see online supplementary 
Appendix 1) provide an example of how the conceptual under-
pinnings of economic burden measurement can be applied 
in relatively unchartered terrain with data from a number 
of published and unpublished sources. Undoubtedly, some 
assumptions (and sometimes compromises) needed to be made 
to address data gaps. In our study, we have attempted to docu-
ment them as thoroughly as possible. Thus, our efforts can 
give insight to administrators, data collectors and academics 
of where further fieldwork might be undertaken.
suMMAry And cOnclusIOns
The total cost to Canadian society of newly diagnosed cases 
in 2011 of mesothelioma and lung cancer from occupation-
al-related asbestos exposure is $C831 million for direct and 
indirect costs and $C1.521 billion for quality of life costs. The 
latter is based on a value of $C100 000 per QALY. The per-case 
average lifetime cost is $C356 429 and $C652 369, respec-
tively. The breakdown of this cost into key components is as 
follows: 35% of the cost is attributable to direct and indirect 
costs and 65% to losses in health-related quality of life. This 
burden estimate is large; yet, it is only the tip of the total 
economic burden, since it includes only 2331 newly diagnosed 
occupational and para-occupational cases from one calendar 
year. The number of new cases is predicted to grow in the near 
future, even though asbestos is no longer mined in Canada, 
due to the long latency of onset and the continuation of occu-
pational exposures experienced by workers, particularly in the 
construction industry. We have not included in our estimates 
other occupational diseases that are associated with asbestos 
exposure, such as pleural plaque and several other cancers, 
and non-occupational exposure, so our estimate of the societal 
economic burden of new cases in Canada is likely a conser-
vative one. Our methods provide a template for estimates of 
asbestos-related disease burden in other countries.
