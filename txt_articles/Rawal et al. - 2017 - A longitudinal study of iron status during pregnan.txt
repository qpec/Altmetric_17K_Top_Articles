Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to prospectively
and longitudinally investigate maternal iron status during early
to mid-pregnancy, and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM), using a comprehensive panel of conventional
and novel iron biomarkers.
Methods A case–control study of 107 women with GDM and
214 controls (matched on age, race/ethnicity and gestational
week during blood collection) was conducted within the the
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies–Singleton
Cohort (2009–2013), a prospective and multiracial pregnancy
cohort. Plasma hepcidin, ferritin and soluble transferrin recep-
tor (sTfR) were measured and sTfR:ferritin ratio was derived,
twice before GDM diagnosis (gestational weeks 10–14 and
15–26) and at weeks 23–31 and 33–39. GDM diagnosis was
ascertained from medical records. Adjusted ORs (aORs) for
GDM were estimated using conditional logistic regression
analysis, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy BMI and
other major risk factors.
Results Hepcidin concentrations during weeks 15–26 were
16% higher among women with GDM vs controls (median
6.4 vs 5.5 ng/ml; p=0.02 ), and were positively associated
with GDM risk; the aOR (95% CI) for highest vs lowest quar-
tile was 2.61 (1.07, 6.36). Ferritin levels were also positively
associated with GDM risk; the aOR (95% CI) for highest vs
lowest quartile was 2.43 (1.12, 5.28) at weeks 10–14 and 3.95
(1.38, 11.30) at weeks 15–26. The sTfR:ferritin ratio was in-
versely related to GDM risk; the aOR (95% CI) for highest vs
lowest quartile was 0.33 (0.14, 0.80) at weeks 10–14 and 0.15
(0.05, 0.48) at weeks 15–26.
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that elevated
iron stores may be involved in the development of GDM from
as early as the first trimester. This raises potential concerns for
the recommendation of routine iron supplementation among
iron-replete pregnant women.

 Introduction
Iron is regarded as a double-edged sword in living systems, as
both iron deficiency and overload can be harmful. Pregnant
women are particularly vulnerable to iron deficiency and re-
lated adverse pregnancy outcomes [1]. While a few guide-
lines, including those from the American Congress of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend screening and
treatment for iron deficiency as required, several other groups,
such as WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, recommend routine iron supplementation in preg-
nant women [2]. Emerging findings from both animal and
human studies, however, have raised critical concerns about
significant links between larger iron stores and disturbances in
glucose metabolism, including an increased risk of type 2
diabetes among non-pregnant individuals [3–5]. The evidence
is unclear regarding the contribution of larger iron stores in
pregnancy to the development of gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM), a common complication of pregnancy that is associ-
ated with a number of adverse health outcomes for both wom-
en and their children [6]. Advancing gestation is characterised
by progressive increases in demands for iron [6] and insulin
resistance [7], the latter being a central feature of GDM.
Longitudinal studies that examine iron status across pregnan-
cy are, hence, needed to comprehensively elucidate the role of
iron status in the pathogenesis of GDM.
Prospective studies investigating the association between
iron status in pregnancy and the risk of GDM are few and
inconsistent in their findings [8–12], and none have examined
these associations with longitudinal measurements of iron sta-
tus. In addition, the vast majority of the existing literature
centres on serum ferritin as a biomarker of iron stores.
Ferritin levels, however, may not be the optimal indicator of
iron status, as they may also increase in the presence of infec-
tion or inflammation [13]. Alternatively, soluble transferrin
receptor (sTfR), a marker of tissue iron insufficiency, could
provide useful and complementary information on iron status
as it is considered to be less influenced by the acute-phase
response than ferritin [13–15]. Furthermore, emerging evi-
dence has identified hepcidin, a novel biomarker, as the master
regulator of iron homeostasis [16]. In response to high body
iron stores, increased hepatic secretion of hepcidin inhibits
iron absorption from three main sources: dietary absorption
in the gut, recycled iron from macrophages and stored iron
released from hepatocytes [16]. In pregnancy, hepcidin may
also play a critical role in the active transport of iron to the
fetus [17]. To our knowledge, only one prior study has exam-
ined serum hepcidin levels in relation to GDM [18]. The study
found a positive association, yet provided limited inference
because of the small number of GDM cases (n=30), the use
of cross-sectional analysis with blood samples collected at the
same time as GDM diagnosis and the lack of adjustment for
potential confounders.
In the present study, we aimed to prospectively and lon-
gitudinally investigate body iron status during early to mid-
pregnancy and its association with subsequent GDM risk
using a comprehensive panel of conventional and novel
iron biomarkers, including hepcidin, ferritin, sTfR and
sTfR:ferritin ratio. Additionally, concurrent measurements
of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were obtained to
account for inflammation. The secondary objective of the
study was to characterise longitudinal changes in these iron
metabolism biomarkers throughout pregnancy.
Methods
Study design We conducted a case–control study within the
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies–
Singleton Cohort (2009–2013), which was a prospective and
multiracial pregnancy cohort. Briefly, 2334 non-obese [19]
and 468 obese women, aged 18–40 years, were recruited
between 8 and 13 weeks of gestation, from 12 US clinical
centres, and followed throughout pregnancy [19]. Eligible
women had a known date of last menstrual period (LMP),
which was confirmed by ultrasound screening at enrolment
[19]. Women whose LMP and ultrasound dates did not match
within a specific range (±5–7 days) were excluded from the
study. Women with a history of pre-existing hypertension, di-
abetes or other major chronic diseases were also excluded [19].
Research approval was obtained from all participating institu-
tions and the participants provided written informed consent.
In the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies singleton cohort, 107
women with GDM (cases) were identified by medical record
review. The GDM diagnosis was based on Carpenter and
Coustan’s diagnostic criteria [20]. Each case was matched with
two randomly selected non-GDM controls, based on age
(±2 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander) and gestational week
of blood collection (±2 weeks). Thus, a total of 321 women
(107 GDM cases and 214 non-GDM controls) from the original
cohort were included in this case–control study. Following a
standardised protocol, blood specimens were collected at four
study visits during pregnancy. The visits were targeted at ges-
tational weeks 8–13 (enrolment), 16–22, 24–29 and 34–37, but
the actual ranges were gestational weeks 10–14, 15–26, 23–31
and 33–39, respectively. Blood specimens were collected at the
second visit (week 15–26), after an overnight fast. All
biospecimens were immediately processed and stored at
–80°C until being thawed for laboratory analysis.
Exposure assessment Concentrations of plasma hepcidin
(ng/ml) were measured using a competitive binding ELISA
kit (Human Hepcidin-25 [bioactive] ELISA kit; DRG
Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). Concentrations of plasma
250

 ferritin (pmol/l) and sTfR (nmol/l) were measured using
Roche reagents on the Roche Modular P chemistry
analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
sTfR:ferritin ratio was derived by dividing the plasma
concentration of sTfR (μg/l) by that of ferritin (μg/l).
Plasma CRP (nmol/l) was measured using a highly sensi-
tive latex-particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay
kit on the Roche Modular P chemistry analyser. All assays
were performed blinded to case or control status, and the
inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were ≤13%.
For women with GDM and one of their matched controls,
the assays were performed using samples from all four
time points of blood collection. For the remaining control
participants, biomarkers were only measured in the blood
specimens collected at the two visits prior to GDM diag-
nosis (i.e. gestational weeks 10–14 and 15–26).
Assessment of covariates A structured questionnaire was
administered at enrolment and collected information on
several GDM risk factors, including maternal age (years),
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander), nulliparity (yes/no),
family history of diabetes (yes/no), education (less than,
equal to or more than high-school), smoking in the 6 months
preceding pregnancy (yes/no) and alcohol consumption in
the 3 months preceding pregnancy (yes/no). Prepregnancy
BMI (<25.0, 25.0–29.9 or ≥30.0 kg/m2) was calculated
from prepregnancy weight (self-reported) and height (mea-
sured at enrolment). Information on GDM treatment (diet,
lifestyle modification and/or medication) was obtained by
reviewing medical records. Gestational age (weeks) at each
blood collection was calculated from the reported LMP
date. At each study visit, women also reported medication
and supplement use, including iron supplements.
Statistical methods Descriptive statistics are presented as
mean (SD) for parametric continuous variables, median
(25th, 75th percentile) for non-parametric continuous vari-
ables and frequencies for categorical variables. Differences
between cases and controls were analysed using generalised
linear mixed-effects models for continuous variables and
binomial/multinomial logistic regression with generalised es-
timating equations for categorical variables, accounting for
matched case–control pairs. To examine the longitudinal tra-
jectory of each iron biomarker over pregnancy, median con-
centrations of the biomarkers were plotted by study visit.
For each iron marker, crude and adjusted quartile-specific
ORs of GDM were estimated at weeks 10–14 and 15–26
(visits prior to the typical screening for GDM) using condi-
tional logistic regression models with the lowest quartile as the
reference group. Multivariable models were adjusted for a
priori selected covariates including parity, education, family
history of diabetes and prepregnancy BMI. Since maternal age
and gestational age at blood collection were only matched
between cases and controls within a specified range, both
were included as covariates to derive conservative risk esti-
mates. In addition, for each time-point, we adjusted for CRP
levels at the corresponding visit to limit the potential influence
of inflammation status. Tests of linear trend were conducted
using the median value for each quartile and fitting it as a
continuous variable in the conditional logistic regression
models. We excluded one case at weeks 10–14 and five cases
at weeks 15–26 from the final analyses, as these women were
diagnosed with GDM before the respective visit.
In order to test the robustness of our findings, we conducted
sensitivity analyses by excluding women with a history of
GDM (n=6), a history of chronic anaemia and other haema-
tological disorders (n=2), smoking before the current preg-
nancy (n=5), self-reported anaemia during the current preg-
nancy (n=16) or suspected iron deficiency (defined as plasma
ferritin <26.9 pmol/l [9]) at weeks 10–14 (n=3) or 15–26
(n=13). To evaluate whether the findings were modified by
major risk factors for GDM, we also conducted stratified
analyses by prepregnancy obesity status (BMI <30.0 vs
≥30.0 kg/m2), median CRP level (<48.3 vs ≥48.3 nmol/l at
weeks 10–14 and <49.5 vs ≥49.5 nmol/l l at weeks 15–26),
family history of diabetes (yes vs no) and GDM severity as
indicated by treatment (diet/lifestyle modification vs medica-
tion use). Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Significance
was set at two-tailed p values of <0.05.
Results
Compared with non-GDM controls, women who subsequent-
ly developed GDM were more likely to have a higher
prepregnancy BMI and a family history of diabetes
(Table 1). Figure 1 shows the longitudinal trajectory of each
iron biomarker among women with GDM and their matched
controls. Hepcidin and ferritin concentrations tended to de-
cline through mid-pregnancy and then level off. In compari-
son, sTfR concentrations and the sTfR:ferritin ratio, both in-
dicators of iron insufficiency, tended to increase with the pro-
gression of pregnancy.
At the first visit (weeks 10–14), only ferritin levels differed
significantly between GDM cases and controls. Ferritin levels
were approximately 21% higher among women who subse-
quently developed GDM than those who did not (median levels
143.2 vs 118.7 pmol/l, p=0.04; Table 2). At weeks 15–26,
closer to the time of GDM diagnosis, both hepcidin and ferritin
levels were significantly higher among cases than controls. In
addition, the sTfR:ferritin ratio was lower among cases at both
visits, but the difference was statistically significant only at the
second visit. sTfR concentrations did not differ significantly
between GDM cases and controls at either visit.

 Associations between quartiles of iron biomarkers and
GDM status are shown in Table 3. During gestational weeks
10–14, ferritin levels were significantly and positively as-
sociated with GDM risk, with an adjusted OR (aOR) (95%
CI) of 2.43 (1.12, 5.28) when comparing the highest vs
lowest quartile.The odds of GDM tended to increase with
increasing quartiles of ferritin at weeks 10–14 (p for
trend = 0.03). In comparison, the sTfR:ferritin ratio was sig-
nificantly and inversely associated with GDM risk at weeks
10–14 (p for trend = 0.02), with an aOR (95% CI) of 0.33
(0.14, 0.80) when comparing the highest vs the lowest quar-
tile (Table 3). At 15–26 weeks, plasma concentrations of
hepcidin and ferritin were significantly and positively asso-
ciated with GDM risk, whereas the sTfR:ferritin ratio was
inversely related to GDM risk (Table 3). Specifically, com-
paring the highest with the lowest quartile, the aOR (95%
CI) associated with GDM risk was 2.61 (1.07, 6.36) for
hepcidin, 3.95 (1.38, 11.30) for ferritin, and 0.15 (0.05,
0.48) for sTfR:ferritin ratio. The test for linear trend was
only significant for sTfR:ferritin ratio (p for trend = 0.002).
The associations between iron biomarkers and GDM risk
remained practically unchanged between multivariable
models with and without additional adjustment for CRP
levels (Table 3; data not shown for the latter).
The majority of women in our study (83% at weeks 10–14;
87% in the second trimester during 15–26 gestational weeks)
reported using supplemental iron, including both iron-only
supplements and prenatal or standard multivitamins that
contained iron (data not shown). In sensitivity analyses (data
not shown), the associations between iron biomarkers and
GDM risk were attenuated but did not appreciably change
after additional adjustment for supplemental use of iron (yes/
no) at the corresponding visit. The associations also persisted
in sensitivity analyses after the exclusion of women with a
history of prior GDM, self-reported anaemia during pregnan-
cy, smoking before pregnancy, suspected iron deficiency
(plasma ferritin <26.9 pmol/l [9]) or a history of chronic anae-
mia and other haematologic disorders. In addition, the direc-
tions of the associations remained similar when stratifying the
analyses by prepregnancy obesity status, CRP level, family
history of diabetes or severity of GDM (data not shown).
Discussion
In this prospective, longitudinal study of pregnant women
without prepregnancy chronic disease, higher iron status in
pregnancy (as indicated by higher hepcidin and ferritin con-
centrations and a lower sTfR:ferritin ratio) was significantly
associated with an elevated risk of GDM, even after adjust-
ment for plasma CRP levels, prepregnancy BMI and other
major GDM risk factors. In addition, the magnitude of asso-
ciations appeared greater in the second trimester, closer to
GDM diagnosis, than in early pregnancy.
Among iron biomarkers, ferritin has been most often investi-
gated in relation to GDM. Our finding of a significant and pos-
itive association between ferritin levels and GDM is consistent
with most [9–12, 18, 21–26] but not all previous studies [8, 27,

 28]. Notably, the majority of prior studies were cross-sectional,
using only a single measurement of ferritin, typically assessed at
the time of GDM diagnosis [18, 21–27]. Peripheral circulating
ferritin concentrations are a good proxy for body iron stores
but, being an acute-phase reactant, ferritin levels can also in-
crease with subclinical systemic inflammation, which is asso-
ciated with insulin resistance in GDM [13]. Hence, prospective
studies that measure iron status well before GDM diagnosis are
needed to establish temporality and to control for confounding
by insulin resistance-mediated inflammation. Studies that have
prospectively examined the association of ferritin with GDM
risk have, however, been limited and inconsistent in their find-
ings [8–12]. For instance, a study based in Lebanon found that
high ferritin levels in early pregnancy were significantly asso-
ciated with impaired glucose tolerance but not with GDM in-
cidence, although the latter could be attributed to the small
number of women with GDM in the study (n=16) [8]. In
another prospective study, the association between serum fer-
ritin and GDM was found to be significant after accounting for
several confounders, including ethnicity and a family history
of diabetes, but was attenuated to non-significance after addi-
tionally accounting for prepregnancy BMI [11]. On the other
hand, a recent case–control study based on data from the
Danish National Birth Cohort (1996–2002) reported a positive
and significant association between ferritin and GDM risk,
even after adjustment for plasma CRP levels and several risk
factors for GDM, including prepregnancy BMI [12]. Similarly
to the Danish study [12], we minimised the influence of in-
flammatory status by controlling for CRP levels in our multi-
variable models and found that high ferritin was significantly
associated with GDM risk at as early as 10–14 weeks of ges-
tation. Our study offers several unique strengths compared
with the Danish study [12], including a longitudinal design
with two iron measurements prior to GDM diagnosis, a more
contemporary and multiracial cohort, and the evaluation of
hepcidin, a relatively novel biomarker that has recently been
identified as the master regulator of iron homeostasis. Only one
prior study has been carried out to examine hepicidin levels in
relation to GDM [18]; in this study, positive associations were
observed between hepcidin and GDM, similar to our study.
However, inferences that can be drawn from the findings of
this prior study are hindered by its cross-sectional examination
of the data [18]. More importantly, the study did not control for
potential confounding factors or account for the impact of in-
flammation status.
sTfR, a marker of tissue iron insufficiency, has also been
understudied in the context of GDM risk [9, 12, 29]. In the
present study, no significant association was observed be-
tween sTfR levels and GDM risk. Similarly, in an Australian
cohort of pregnant women, first trimester sTfR levels were not
found to be significantly associated with the risk of GDM [9,
29]. In a recent study conducted among Danish women, sTfR
concentrations in early pregnancy (9.4 ± 3.2 weeks of
gestation) were significantly and positively associated with
GDM risk, but this was attenuated to non-significance after
adjustment for prepregnancy BMI [12]. It is worth noting,
however, that sTfR levels tend to increase only in the presence
of a functional iron deficiency. In an experimental study in
which iron-deficiency anaemia was gradually induced in
healthy participants, serum ferritin levels declined as iron
stores decreased, whereas circulating sTfR levels increased
only once the iron stores had been significantly depleted. In
our study sample, there were only a small number of women
with suspected iron deficiency (three women at weeks 10–14
and 13 women at weeks 15–26), as defined by plasma ferritin
levels less than 26.9 pmol/l [9]. Hence, sTfR levels alone
might not have been an appropriate indicator of iron status
in our sample.
Our study is unique in that we further examined the
sTfR:ferritin ratio, a measure that captures both cellular iron
demand and the availability of body iron stores [14]. The
added value of using sTfR:ferritin ratio, as opposed to isolated
measurements of sTfR and ferritin, is that it covers the full
spectrum of iron homeostasis, from normal, healthy iron stores
to mild or substantial functional iron deficiency [14, 15]. The
sTfR:ferritin ratio offers greater sensitivity and specificity in
characterising iron status than individual measurements of fer-
ritin and sTfR and is considered to be particularly useful when
individual measurements yield ambiguous results [13]. In the
present study, we observed significant inverse associations be-
tween sTfR:ferritin ratio and GDM, despite having observed
no association with sTfR levels alone. This suggests that the
inverse association with sTfR:ferritin ratio may be driven pri-
marily via levels of ferritin, hence this finding should be
interpreted cautiously.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively
demonstrate significant and positive associations between iron
status during pregnancy and GDM risk using longitudinal
measurements of a panel of conventional and novel iron bio-
markers. Higher hepcidin levels, which indicate an iron sur-
plus, were significantly related to an increased GDM risk only
during the second trimester, before the diagnosis of GDM.
Similarly, an elevated second-trimester iron status, whether
based on higher ferritin levels or lower sTfR:ferritin ratio,
was more strongly associated with GDM risk than an elevated
first-trimester iron status.
In secondary analyses, we examined the longitudinal trajec-
tory of several iron biomarkers over the entire course of preg-
nancy. Hepcidin and ferritin concentrations tended to decline
with advancing gestation, whereas sTfR concentrations and the
sTfR:ferritin ratio, both indicators of iron insufficiency, tended
to increase with the progression of pregnancy. This was ex-
pected, as iron demands increase dramatically throughout
pregnancy in order to support placental and fetal growth, sus-
tain the expansion of erythrocyte mass and offset blood losses
from delivery [30]. A similar decline in ferritin and hepcidin

255
 levels, and an increase in sTfR concentrations through the
course of pregnancy have been previously reported by others,
yet our study is the largest to date to provide data for changes in
hepcidin levels during pregnancy [31, 32].
Our findings are biologically plausible; iron may play a
role in the pathogenesis of GDM via several potential
mechanisms. As a strong pro-oxidant, free iron can cataly-
se several cellular reactions that generate reactive oxygen
species and increase the level of oxidative stress [3].
Oxidative stress induced from excess iron accumulation
can cause beta cell damage and apoptosis and, consequent-
ly, contribute to impaired insulin synthesis and secretion
[3]. In the liver, high iron stores may induce insulin resis-
tance via impaired insulin signalling, as well as by attenu-
ating the capacity of the liver to extract insulin [33, 34].
Excess iron deposition in the muscles may enhance NEFA
oxidation and interfere with glucose uptake or disposal [33,
34]. Iron accumulation may also impair the action of insu-
lin and interfere with insulin-induced glucose transport in
adipocytes [33, 34]. Consistent with this notion, an in-
creased prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been observed
in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis, a genetic
disorder characterised by excessive iron absorption and
pathological increases in total body iron stores [33].
Similarly, increasing evidence from biological and epide-
miological studies indicates that elevated body iron stores
are associated with an increased risk of types 1 and 2 dia-
betes [3–5]. Furthermore, induction of iron depletion has
been shown to improve insulin sensitivity measures in
carbohydrate-intolerant participants [35, 36].
Our study has several strengths. First, longitudinal blood
collection provided a unique opportunity to prospectively in-
vestigate levels of iron biomarkers across pregnancy and their
trimester-specific associations with the subsequent risk of
GDM. Second, the study participants represented various
races/ethnicities and included a relatively high number of
women with GDM who were well characterised based on
medical records. More importantly, our study examined con-
ventional and novel biomarkers of iron status, and measured
them prospectively at multiple time points before GDM diag-
nosis. Finally, we considered the influence of a number of
important confounding factors, including inflammatory status,
in evaluating the relationship between iron status in pregnancy
and GDM risk. It is important to note that the present study
focused on examining the role of body iron status, as mea-
sured by plasma iron biomarkers, in the development of
GDM; future studies investigating how dietary iron intake
influences these biomarkers and ultimately impacts GDM risk
are warranted.
In summary, the findings from this longitudinal and pro-
spective study among multiracial, relatively healthy pregnant
women without any prepregnancy chronic disease suggest
that higher maternal iron stores may play a role in the
development of GDM from as early as the first trimester.
These findings are of clinical and public health importance
since they extend the observation of an association between
high body iron stores and an elevated risk of glucose intoler-
ance among non-pregnant individuals to those who are preg-
nant, and raise potential concerns for the recommendation of
routine iron supplementation among iron-replete pregnant
women.
