Abstract
Background
Maternal overweight and obesity are associated with increased risks of birth-asphyxia-
related outcomes, but the mechanisms are unclear. If a change of exposure (i.e., maternal
body mass index [BMI]) over time influences risks, this would be consistent with a causal
relationship between maternal BMI and offspring risks. Our objective was to investigate
associations between changes in maternal BMI between consecutive pregnancies and
risks of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes in the second offspring born at term.
Methods and Findings
This study was a prospective population-based cohort study that included 526,435 second-
born term (�37 wk) infants of mothers with two consecutive live singleton term births in
Sweden between January 1992 and December 2012.
We estimated associations between the difference in maternal BMI between the first and
second pregnancy and risks of low Apgar score (0–6) at 5 min, neonatal seizures, and
meconium aspiration in the second-born offspring. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for BMI
at first pregnancy, maternal height, maternal age at second delivery, smoking, education,
mother´s country of birth, inter-pregnancy interval, and year of second delivery. Analyses
were also stratified by BMI (<25 versus �25 kg/m2) in the first pregnancy.
Risks of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration increased with
inter-pregnancy weight gain. Compared with offspring of mothers with stable weight (BMI
change of −1 to <1 kg/m2), the adjusted OR for a low Apgar score in the offspring of mothers
with a BMI change of 4 kg/m2 or more was 1.33 (95% CI 1.12–1.58). The corresponding
risks for neonatal seizures and meconium aspiration were 1.42 (95% CI 1.00–2.02) and
1.78 (95% CI 1.19–2.68), respectively. The increased risk of neonatal seizures related to
weight gain appeared to be restricted to mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m2 in the first pregnancy.

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity has epidemic proportions, also
among pregnant women.
• Maternal overweight and obesity increase the risks of pregnancy complications and
adverse neonatal outcomes, including severe birth asphyxia disorders.
• An independent association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and birth
asphyxia would be further supported if maternal weight gain between pregnancies
increases the risks of birth asphyxia in the following pregnancy.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Data from the nationwide Swedish Medical Birth Register were used, which included
532,858 second-born infants born at term (�37 weeks gestation) to mothers having
their first and second infants between 1992 and 2012.
• We estimated the associations between inter-pregnancy weight change and the risks of a
low Apgar score (0–6) at 5 min (rate 5.4/1,000), neonatal seizures (rate 1.2/1,000), and
meconium aspiration (rate 0.7/1,000).
• The risks of a low Apgar score consistently increased with maternal weight gain. Compared
with mothers with stable weight (−1 to <1 kg/m2 change in BMI between pregnancies),
infants born to mothers who gained 4 kg/m2 or more between pregnancies had a 33% to
78% increased risk of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration.
• A study limitation is that we could not investigate the potential impact of obstetric and
neonatal interventions.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• The risk of birth asphyxia increases with maternal weight gain between pregnancies.
Consequently, preventing weight gain between pregnancies could reduce the risk of
birth asphyxia and improve infant health.

 Introduction
Maternal overweight and obesity during pregnancy increase the risks of severe maternal and
infant complications [1–4]. In Sweden, the proportion of women with overweight and obesity
(body mass index [BMI] � 25 kg/m2) in early pregnancy increased from 26% in 1992 to 38%
in 2010 [5]. In the US, 58% of women between 20 and 39 y of age were overweight or obese
in 2011–2012 [6]. As recently stated by WHO, the prevalence of maternal obesity must be
reduced in order to improve maternal, fetal, and neonatal health [7].
Maternal overweight and obesity increase the risks of severe neonatal complications, includ-
ing major malformations, preterm birth, neonatal morbidities, and low Apgar score (0–6)
[3,8–11]. In term non-malformed infants, low Apgar score is commonly caused by birth
asphyxia [12].
We have previously demonstrated a linear relationship between maternal BMI in early preg-
nancy and the risks of low Apgar scores at 5 and 10 min and birth-asphyxia-related neonatal
morbidity in infants born at term [8]. Furthermore, we have found that the risk of asphyxia-
related infant mortality in term infants increases with the degree of maternal obesity [5]. Risks
being influenced by a change of exposure (i.e., maternal BMI) over time would be consistent
with a causal relationship between maternal BMI and adverse outcomes of the offspring.
In this nationwide Swedish cohort study, we examined whether changes in maternal BMI
between first and second pregnancies influenced the risks of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes
in the second-born offspring, including low Apgar score (0–6) at 5 min, neonatal seizures, and
meconium aspiration.
Methods
Study Design and Population
Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at Karolinska
Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden (number 2012/4:9). Informed consent was not required as all
data were anonymous.
Between January 1992 and December 2012, the nationwide Swedish Medical Birth Register
included 533,535 mothers with first and second live singleton term births (�37 completed
weeks). We excluded 165 mothers with no information on inter-pregnancy interval and 512
mothers with no information on mothers’ country of birth. In analyses of low Apgar score in
the second infant, we excluded another 6,423 mothers (1.2%) where either the first- or the sec-
ond-born infant had missing information on Apgar score at 1 or 5 min.
The Swedish Medical Birth Register started in 1973 and contains prospectively collected
data on more than 98% of all births in Sweden. The quality of data is considered high [13].
Information on sociodemographic factors, maternal and infant anthropometry, and Apgar
scores are collected on standardized forms used in antenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care in
Sweden. Maternal and neonatal diagnoses, including pregnancy complications and neonatal
morbidities, are classified by physicians according the Swedish version of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). The ninth version (ICD-9) was used between 1992 and 1996,
and the tenth version (ICD-10) thereafter. The standardized forms are forwarded to the Swed-
ish Medical Birth Register when the mother and infant are discharged from hospital. Informa-
tion on the mother’s country of birth and level of education were obtained from the Swedish
Register of Total Population and the Swedish Register of Education, respectively. Individual
cross-linkage of registries was possible using the personal identification number [14], a person-
unique identifier assigned to all Swedish citizens at birth or at naturalization.

 Exposures
Maternal BMI (kg/m2) was calculated for each of the two consecutive pregnancies. At the first
antenatal visit, which occurs in the first trimester in 90% of pregnancies [13], the woman´s
weight is measured wearing light indoor clothes and barefoot, and data on self-reported height
are recorded. Inter-pregnancy change in BMI was calculated as the difference in BMI between
the second and first pregnancies. We categorized the inter-pregnancy BMI change as <−2 kg/
m2 (i.e., BMI loss greater than 2 kg/m2), −2 to <−1 kg/m2, −1 to <1 kg/m2 (stable weight), 1 to
<2 kg/m2, 2 to <4, and �4 kg/m2. A 1-kg/m2 change in BMI corresponds to change of 2.8 kg
in a woman of average height (167 cm). Based on BMI in the first pregnancy, mothers were cat-
egorized as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight
(25–29.9 kg/m2), obese grade I (30–34.9 kg/m2), and obese grade II-III (�35 kg/m2) [15].
The inter-pregnancy interval was calculated as the time difference between the date of birth
of the first infant and estimated date of conception of the second infant (i.e., date of birth of the
second infant minus gestational age + 14 d). Gestational age was estimated primarily based on
early second trimester ultrasound, which is offered to all pregnant women and which 95% of
women accept [16]. When dating from an ultrasonic scan was not available, gestational age
was estimated using information on date of last menstrual period. Obesity-related disorders
were identified in the Swedish Medical Birth Register based on ICD codes: preeclampsia—
ICD-9 codes 642E–642G, ICD-10 codes O14–O15; chronic hypertension—ICD-9 codes 401–
405, 642C, 642M, ICD-10 codes O10–O11; gestational diabetes—ICD-9 code 648W, ICD-10
code O244; pregestational diabetes—ICD-9 code 250, ICD-10 codes E10–E14, O241–O243.
Covariates were categorized according to Table 1.
Outcomes
We estimated the risks of severe asphyxia-related outcomes, including low Apgar score, meco-
nium aspiration, and neonatal seizures, at the second birth by change in BMI from the first to
the second pregnancy. A low Apgar score was defined as a score between 0 and 6 points at 5
min after birth. A diagnosis of neonatal seizures was based on ICD-9 code 779.0 or ICD-10
code P90, and a diagnosis of meconium aspiration was based on ICD-9 code 770.1 or ICD-10
code P24.0.
Statistical Analyses
Rates of low Apgar score, meconium aspiration, and neonatal seizures were calculated as the
number of infants with these outcomes per 1,000 births. Logistic regression analyses were used
to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. Mothers whose
first infant had a low Apgar score, meconium aspiration, or neonatal seizures were excluded
from the analysis of the respective outcome in the second pregnancy to avoid bias in case of a
tendency to repeat adverse pregnancy outcomes. Inter-pregnancy weight change was catego-
rized as presented above in the regression model, but also treated as a continuous variable.
Multivariate models were restricted to second births with complete data on inter-pregnancy
weight change and covariates. We adjusted for maternal BMI in the first pregnancy, maternal
height, maternal age at second delivery, smoking habits in the second pregnancy, inter-preg-
nancy interval, mother´s education, mother’s country of birth, and year of second birth, cate-
gorized according to Table 1. Given the long study period, spanning over 21 y, we categorized
year of second birth (not shown in Table 1) into intervals as 1992–1996, 1997–2001, 2002–
2006, and 2007–2012.
In sensitivity analyses (S1 Table), mothers with obesity-related disorders (chronic hyperten-
sion, preeclampsia, or any type of diabetes) were excluded from the regression analyses. A

 sensitivity analysis was also performed to explore whether pregnancies of mothers with missing
data on inter-pregnancy weight change differed from those with information on inter-preg-
nancy weight change (S2 Table). To explore any effect modification by first pregnancy BMI on
the association between exposure and outcomes, analyses were also stratified by maternal BMI
in the first pregnancy (BMI < 25 or BMI � 25 kg/m2). Interaction terms were introduced in
the multivariate models, and a p-value of less than 0.05 for the interaction term was considered
statistically significant.
Results
The total number of infants with a low Apgar score (0–6 points) at 5 min was 2,824 (rate 4.08/
1,000). Corresponding numbers (rates) for neonatal seizures and meconium aspiration were
658 (1.23/1,000) and 372 (0.70/1,000), respectively (Table 1). Rates of all birth-asphyxia-related
outcomes increased with maternal BMI in the first pregnancy, inter-pregnancy interval, smok-
ing, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, any type of diabetes, and generally also with maternal
age at second delivery (Table 1). Maternal education was inversely correlated with all out-
comes. There was a U-shaped relationship between birth weight and gestational age and rates

 of low Apgar score and neonatal seizures, while the rate of meconium aspiration increased
with gestational age. Rates of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration in
second-born offspring were essentially similar in offspring of mothers with missing data on
BMI in the first pregnancy and the total population.
Rates of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration increased with inter-
pregnancy weight gain (Table 2). Compared with mothers with stable weight, the risk of a low
Apgar score was 26% increased in offspring of mothers who gained 2 to <4 kg/m2 and 33%
increased in offspring of mothers who gained �4 kg/m2. Risk of neonatal seizures was
increased by more than 40% in offspring of mothers who gained 2 to <4 and �4 kg/m2. The
risk of meconium aspiration was 78% higher in offspring of mothers who gained �4 kg/m2
compared with offspring of mothers with stable weight.

 We investigated whether the effect of weight change on asphyxia-related outcomes differed
between offspring of mothers who were underweight/normal weight and overweight/obese in
the first pregnancy (BMI <25 and �25 kg/m2, respectively) (Table 3). In underweight/normal
weight mothers in the first pregnancy, the risk of low Apgar score increased with weight gain,
while the corresponding association was less evident in infants of mothers who were over-
weight/obese in the first pregnancy. However, the test for an interaction between maternal
BMI and low Apgar was not significant (p = 0.12).
The risk of neonatal seizures increased with weight gain in offspring of mothers who were
underweight/normal weight in the first pregnancy, but not in offspring of mothers who were
overweight/obese in the first pregnancy (test for interaction; p = 0.004). In underweight/normal
weight mothers, offspring of mothers with a weight gain of �4 kg/m2 had a doubled risk of
neonatal seizures compared with offspring of mothers with stable BMI.
Stratifying the analyses by maternal BMI in the first pregnancy (<25 and �25 kg/m2) dem-
onstrated a more than doubled risk of meconium aspiration in offspring of underweight/nor-
mal weight mothers who gained �4 kg/m2. In contrast, in overweight/obese mothers, weight
gain was not associated with increased risk of meconium aspiration in offspring. However, the
test for interaction was not significant (p = 0.77).
In order to investigate whether associations between maternal weight gain and asphyxia-
related outcomes were influenced by obesity-related disorders, we repeated the analyses after
excluding offspring of mothers with chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, or any type of diabe-
tes. Restricting the analyses to offspring of mothers without obesity-related disorders did not
change the risks of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures, or meconium aspiration (S1 Table).
We also investigated weight gain and the risks of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes in the off-
spring of mothers who were underweight/normal weight (BMI below 25 kg/m2) in the second
pregnancy (S2 Table). Compared with the offspring of mothers with stable weight, the risks of low
Apgar score and neonatal seizures were more than doubled in offspring of mothers who were nor-
mal weight in the second pregnancy but who had gained �4 kg/m2 between pregnancies.
Finally, we investigated whether mothers with missing information on inter-pregnancy
weight gain, and hence not included in the analyses, differed from mothers with information
on weight gain with respect to other maternal characteristics or birth outcomes. The propor-
tions of women who were overweight, obesity grade I, and obesity grade II-III in the first preg-
nancy were 20.5%, 5.2%, and 1.7%, respectively, for mothers with known weight change and
19.3%, 4.9%, and 1.9%, respectively, for mothers with unknown weight change (due to missing
data on second pregnancy BMI) (S3 Table). Also, the distributions of maternal covariates (as
listed in Table 1) were comparable between mothers with missing data on inter-pregnancy
weight change and mothers with an inter-pregnancy weight change of −1 and <1 kg/m2 (the
reference group) or an inter-pregnancy weight gain of 1 to <2 kg/m2. The proportions of
mothers with obesity-related diseases and rates of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes were simi-
lar in mothers with and without data on inter-pregnancy weight change (S3 Table).The pro-
portions of women who were overweight, obesity grade I, and obesity grade II-III in the second
pregnancy were 25.3%, 7.6%, and 1.4%, respectively, for mothers with information on inter-
pregnancy weight change and 24.2%, 7.1%, and 1.4%, respectively, for mothers with unknown
weight change (due to missing data on first pregnancy BMI).

 gain. The risk increases were primarily found in offspring of mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m2 in
the first pregnancy. The observed increments in risks of low Apgar score, neonatal seizures,
and meconium aspiration remained essentially the same after exclusion of offspring of mothers
with obesity-related diseases.
Findings in Comparison with Other Studies
Data from epidemiological studies support that maternal BMI and changes in maternal BMI
influence the risks of maternal complications, preterm delivery, and infant mortality [8–11,17–
23], We have previously reported that the risks of severe birth-asphyxia-related complications
increase with maternal overweight and obesity [8]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
assess whether these risks are influenced by changes of exposure (i.e., change in weight) over
time.
The pathophysiology underlying the associations between maternal overweight/obesity
and birth-asphyxia-related outcomes in offspring is likely to be complex and multifactorial.
Obesity in pregnant women is accompanied by inflammation in maternal and placental tissues,
impaired microvascular function, oxidative stress, and marked insulin resistance [24,25],
changes that may contribute to the increased risk of birth asphyxia and other complications. It
has also been proposed that an altered gut microbiota in obese women adversely influences
maternal metabolism, which in turn may affect fetal health [26].
Fetal macrosomia is the most prevalent complication in pregnancies with maternal obesity
[4]. There is a linear association between maternal BMI and fetal macrosomia and between
maternal BMI and measures of hyperinsulinemia in cord blood [27], independent of maternal
glucose values. Results from both experimental and clinical studies strongly suggest that fetal
hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor for fetal hypoxia [28–31]. Thus, it is possible that fetal hyper-
insulinemia is of pathophysiological importance for the increased risk of birth asphyxia in
pregnancies with maternal obesity. Fetal macrosomia also increases the risks of traumatic
delivery and shoulder dystocia, which increase the risk of birth asphyxia [32]. Obesity-related
disorders, including chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and diabetic diseases, are associated
with increased risks of fetal hypoxia and low Apgar score [33,34]. However, excluding offspring
of mothers with obesity-related diseases did not substantially change the weight-gain-related
risks of asphyxia-related outcomes in our study.
Compared with offspring of normal weight mothers, offspring of overweight and obese
mothers are at increased risks of birth-asphyxia-related neonatal outcomes [8]. However,
increments in risks associated with inter-pregnancy weight gain were primarily restricted to
offspring of mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m2 in the first pregnancy. The same pattern has also
been demonstrated for complications during pregnancy [17]. Interestingly, in offspring of
mothers with BMI < 25 kg/m2 in the second pregnancy, risks of low Apgar score and neonatal
seizures were more than doubled in offspring of mothers who gained �4 kg/m2 between preg-
nancies (S2 Table). One could speculate that the less pronounced effect of weight gain in
women with established overweight/obesity may reflect a metabolic adaption over time to an
increased fat mass. Furthermore, women with overweight or obesity in early pregnancy accu-
mulate less fat in pregnancy than underweight/normal weight women [25]. Thus, the same
absolute increase in weight would reflect a larger relative increase in fat mass in women of
underweight/normal weight compared with women who already were overweight. It is also
possible that the distribution of added fat mass between pregnancies differs between lean
women and overweight women, with a relatively larger increment in visceral fat in lean than in
overweight women. However, rates of birth-asphyxia-related outcomes also increased with

 weight gain in offspring among women who were overweight or obese in the first pregnancy.
Thus, the statistical power to detect risk increments could have been insufficient.
Strengths and Limitations of the Present Study
The primary strengths of our study are the population-based design, including a large number
of births, and the prospectively recorded data on exposures and outcomes. The large cohort
enabled us to investigate the impact of a range of inter-pregnancy weight change categories on
the risks of neonatal outcomes related to birth asphyxia. The prospectively collected data lim-
ited the risks of selection and information bias. We were also able to analyze these risks strati-
fied by maternal BMI in the first pregnancy and to adjust for several potential confounders.
We used maternal BMI as a proxy for maternal fat mass. This assumption is justified as there is
a strong correlation (r2 = 0.84) between BMI and fat mass in early pregnancy [35].
Some limitations of the present study should be noted. In the present study, inter-pregnancy
weight change was calculated as the difference in early pregnancy BMI between the two first
consecutive pregnancies. We did not have information on gestational weight gain and do not
know when the weight gain occurred. The distribution of fat may differ if weight is gained dur-
ing or after pregnancy. Longitudinal studies demonstrate that women with high gestational
weight gain are likely to retain this weight into subsequent pregnancies [36] and that high
weight gain in the first pregnancy is an important risk factor for future overweight and obesity
[37].
In spite of having data on many key confounders, we cannot rule out the possibility of resid-
ual confounding by unmeasured maternal factors driving the relationship between inter-preg-
nancy weight change and risk of birth asphyxia. For example, women who gain weight between
pregnancies may also have a less healthy life style in other aspects than women with stable
weight. We also lacked specific information on obstetric interventions and neonatal resuscita-
tion efforts. Therefore, the impact of these factors on the risk of birth asphyxia could not be
investigated.
We studied neonatal conditions related to birth asphyxia. Severe birth asphyxia is com-
monly defined as an Apgar score of 0–3 at 5 min in combination with cord blood acidosis and
neurological symptoms like neonatal seizures [38]. However, in epidemiological studies, a fre-
quently used definition of birth asphyxia is an Apgar score of 0–6 at 5 min [39,40]. The validity
of this definition is supported by the fact that an infant with an Apgar score of 4–6 at 5 min has
a 45 times higher risk of neonatal death and a 31 times higher risk of cerebral palsy compared
to infants with an Apgar score of 7–10 at 5 min [41,42]. We studied only infants born at term,
as preterm birth itself is a common reason for low Apgar score [43]. Maternal BMI in early
pregnancy also influences risk of preterm birth [10]. In addition, the possibility of selection
bias should be considered given that the analyses were restricted to offspring of mothers with
two children.
Information on inter-pregnancy weight change was missing in 19% of the study population.
If pregnancies with information on inter-pregnancy weight change differ from pregnancies
without this information, results could be biased. However, the distributions of maternal covar-
iates, overweight, and obesity were similar in the first and second pregnancies of women with
and without information on inter-pregnancy weight change, and rates of asphyxia-related out-
comes were also similar.
Summary
Given the high prevalence of maternal overweight and the possible long-term consequences of
birth asphyxia, our results have substantial public health relevance, as even modest weight

 increases in normal weight women may impact offspring outcomes on a population level.
However, our finding that inter-pregnancy weight gain influences the risks of birth-asphyxia-
related outcomes should be confirmed in other populations. Encouraging women to normalize
BMI before pregnancy and to avoid weight gain between pregnancies is likely to be an impor-
tant measure to improve infant health.
