Abstract
Objectives
Increased expression of adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6) has beneficial effects on the heart
through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent and cAMP-independent path-
ways. We previously generated a catalytically inactive mutant of AC6 (AC6mut) that has an
attenuated response to β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, and, consequently, exhibits
reduced myocardial cAMP generation. In the current study we test the hypothesis that car-
diac-directed expression of AC6mut would protect the heart from sustained β-adrenergic
receptor stimulation, a condition frequently encountered in patients with heart failure.
Methods and results
AC6mut mice and transgene negative siblings received osmotic mini-pumps to provide contin-
uous isoproterenol infusion for seven days. Isoproterenol infusion caused deleterious effects
that were attenuated by cardiac-directed AC6mut expression. Both groups showed reduced
left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, but the reduction was less in AC6mut mice (p = 0.047). In
addition, AC6mut mice showed superior left ventricular function, manifested by higher values
for LV peak +dP/dt (p = 0.03), LV peak -dP/dt (p = 0.008), end-systolic pressure-volume rela-
tionship (p = 0.003) and cardiac output (p<0.03). LV samples of AC6mut mice had more sarco/
endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) protein (p<0.01), which likely contributed to
better LV function. AC6mut mice had lower rates of cardiac myocyte apoptosis (p = 0.016),
reduced caspase 3/7 activity (p = 0.012) and increased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression
(p = 0.0001).
Conclusion
Mice with cardiac-directed AC6mut expression weathered the deleterious effects of continu-
ous isoproterenol infusion better than control mice, indicating cardiac protection.

 Introduction
Substitution of Ala for Asp at position 426 in the catalytic core of adenylate cyclase type 6
(AC6), renders the molecule catalytically inactive, which impairs cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate (cAMP) generation, enabling separation of cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent
effects of AC6 in studies conducted in cultured cardiac myocytes [1],[2],[3],[4]. Transgenic
mice with cardiac-directed AC6mut expression possess normal LV contractile response to iso-
proterenol, despite impairment of LV β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cAMP production [5].
This was shown to be through the beneficial effects of AC6mut on Ca2+ handling, which are
predominantly cAMP-independent [5]. The next logical question, which we address in the
current study, is whether cardiac-directed expression of AC6mut might protect the heart from
the deleterious consequences of sustained β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, which is often
seen in association with heart failure.
The current study has a potential important clinical application. A randomized clinical
gene transfer trial using intracoronary delivery of a modified adenovirus-5 vector encod-
ing human adenylyl cyclase type 6 showed beneficial effects in patients with symptomatic
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was reported in 2016 [6]. In this trial, unal-
tered AC6, which generates cAMP, was used. There were no adverse effects attributable to
increased cAMP generation seen in the trial. Even so, attenuating βAR responsiveness
when treating heart failure may have advantages, and further refinement of the transgene
seems prudent.
The goal of the current study was to perform mechanistic and translational studies of the
effects of cardiac-directed expression of AC6mut specifically to determine how such animals
would fare in the setting of sustained increases in β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, a condi-
tion frequently encountered in subjects with heart failure. Our hypothesis was that cardiac-
directed expression of AC6mut would protect the heart from such deleterious effects, by gov-
erning cardiac responsiveness.
Materials and methods
AC6mut transgenic mice
AC6mut mice in congenic C57BL/6N background were used [5] and transgene negative sib-
lings were used as controls. One hundred seven mice (44% female; 4.1±0.2 months-old; 24.3
±0.4 grams) were used. Mouse genotyping was performed by PCR. We previously reported
details regarding the generation of transgenic mice with cardiac-directed AC6mut expression
[5]. The use of animals was in accordance with Association for Assessment and Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of VA San Diego Healthcare System.
Isoproterenol infusion
Osmotic minipumps (Alzet Model; DuRECT Corp., Cupertino, CA) filled with isoproterenol
(Sigma, I5627) were implanted subcutaneously in AC6mut and control mice using 2% isoflur-
ane/oxygen anesthesia. Infusion rate of isoproterenol was 60 mg/kg/d as previously described
[7],[8] and was continued for seven days. Isoproterenol was dissolved in saline supplemented
with 0.1% ascorbic acid as anti-oxidant. Pumps were removed a day prior to echocardiography
and hemodynamic measurements to avoid the confounding effects of concurrent isoprotere-
nol infusion on measurements of LV dimensions and function. All physiological studies were
performed without knowledge of group identity.

 Echocardiography
Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane (at a flow rate of 1 L/min oxygen) and maintained
at 1% isoflurane in oxygen. Echocardiographic images were obtained using a 9-18L MHz lin-
ear probe and a Vevo 2100 Imaging system.
In vivo physiology
Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, ip) and a 1.4F conductance-
micromanometer catheter (SPR 839, Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) was inserted via the
right carotid artery across the aortic valve and into the LV chamber. After LV pressures were
recorded, bilateral vagotomy was performed to minimize confounding effects of reflex activa-
tion. End-systolic pressure, and the rates of LV pressure development (LV +dP/dt) and decline
(LV -dP/dt) were obtained. Inferior vena cava occlusion was performed to reduce LV volume
for end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) measurements [9]. The product of
stroke volume, determined by conductance catheter, and heart rate was used to determine car-
diac output. Data were acquired and analyzed without knowledge of group identity.
Cyclic AMP measurement
Isolated mice cardiac myocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μM, 10 min) or
NKH477 a water-soluble forskolin analog (10 μM, 10 min), and then lysed (2.5% DTAB, 0.05
M sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin). Supernatant cAMP was mea-
sured using the cAMP Biotrak Enzyme Immunoassay System (GE Healthcare) as previously
reported. [1].
PKA activity assay
Isolated cardiac myocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μM, 10 min) or NKH477
(10 μM, 10 min). Cardiac myocytes were homogenized in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4–
0.5 mM EGTA-0.5 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail from Invitrogen) and centri-
fuged (14,000 x g, 5 min, 4˚C). The supernatant was incubated with PKA biotinylated peptide
substrate (SigmaTECH1 cAMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Assay System, Promega, Madison
WI) in the presence of [γ-32P]-ATP. The 32P-labeled, biotinylated substrate was recovered with
a streptavidin matrix, and the specific activity of PKA determined.
Cardiac myocyte apoptosis
Cardiac myocyte apoptosis was determined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL), as previously described [10]. Paraffin embedded heart tissue sec-
tions were deparaffinized and rehydrated using 100% Citrasolv followed by ethanol. Antigen
retrieval and nuclear permeabilization were performed by submerging the slides in 10 mM cit-
rate (pH 6.0) and heating by microwave. Nuclease-generated positive controls were obtained
by treating tissue with TACS-nuclease in TACS-nuclease buffer (Trevigen, Gaithersburg,
MD). TUNEL staining was performed using a CardioTACS kit except that the Streptavidin-
HRP Solution was replaced with Streptavidin-Oregon Green 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Finally, the slides were mounted using Prolong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),
and imaged by fluorescence microscopy through a 40x lens (Delta Vision System). Blue nuclei
and green apoptotic nuclei were counted using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sun-
nyvale, CA) stipulating a nuclear area from 8 to 450 pixel. Twelve images containing 8,000–
10,000 nuclei were counted for each LV sample. Apoptotic nuclei were expressed as percentage
of total nuclei. Caspase 3/7 activity was determined as previously described [4].

 LV calcineurin activity
Calcineurin activity was assayed using the Calcineurin Cellular Activity Assay Kit (Enzo Life
Sciences, Farmingdale NY). LV homogenates were placed in lysis buffer (provided by Enzo)
and centrifuged at 16,000 x g (4˚C, 60 min). Supernatant was desalted by gel filtration. Five
micrograms of protein were used in the assay. The results are reported as the amount of phos-
phate released (nmol/microgram protein).
Detection of mRNA and immunoblotting
Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify
mRNA and immunoblotting was used to quantify protein content. Primers for FHL1 (For-
ward: TGCAACAAGTGCGCTACTCG, Reverse: CAATGTTTGGCGAACTTGGTC); Periostin (For-
ward: GAGAGTACACCTTATTAGCACCTGTGTA, Reverse: GGTCGCTAAGGCCAACTTTTAC);
and collagen 1 (Forward: GCCAAGAAGACATCCCTGAAG, Reverse: GGGTCCCTCGACTCC
TAC).
Antibodies used in immunoblotting included: anti-FHL1 (Aviva Systems Biology, San
Diego CA; 1:1,000), anti-Bcl2, anti-TnI and anti-phospho-TnI (Cell Signaling, Danvers MA;
1:1,000); anti-NFATC3 and anti-NFATC4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz
CA; 1:200), anti-PLB antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden CO; 1:5,000); anti-phospho-
S16-PLB antibody (Badrilla, Leeds UK; 1:3,000 dilution); anti-S100A1 (Novus Biologicals, Lit-
tleton CO; 1:1,000); anti-SERCA2a (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale NY; 1:1,000); anti-

1:2,000); anti-phospho-CREB (Cell Signaling, Danvers MA; 1:1000). In all figures displaying
immunoblotting, summary data are normalized to GAPDH.
Statistical analysis
Data acquisition and analysis were done without knowledge of group identity. Group sizes
were determined by power calculations. Data represent mean ± SE; 2-way ANOVA was used
to detect differences among 4 groups. Sidak’s multiple comparison was used for between-
group comparisons when ANOVA p<0.05. When two group comparisons were made, Stu-
dent’s t-test was used (two-tailed). The null hypothesis was rejected when p<0.05. Analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego CA).
Results
Echocardiography
Basal heart rates were similar in both groups before and showed similar decline after seven
days of isoproterenol infusion (Table 1). LV end-diastolic dimension was unchanged by iso-
proterenol infusion in both groups. In contrast, end-systolic dimension increased similarly in
both groups. LV ejection fraction was reduced by isoproterenol in both groups, but less so in
mice with cardiac-directed AC6mut expression (p = 0.047).
LV contractile function
For a more load-independent evaluation of LV contractile function than ejection fraction, we
measured LV pressure development and decay (Fig 1; S15–S17 Figs). AC6mut mice showed
superior LV developed pressure (p<0.001), LV peak +dP/dt (p = 0.03) and LV peak -dP/dt
(p = 0.008). The mean slope of the ESPVR, perhaps the best measure of LV contractile func-
tion, was 2-fold steeper (p = 0.003) in AC6mut compared to control mice. Finally, AC6mut

 mice also showed a 41% greater basal cardiac output (p<0.03) than controls. There was no
group difference in heart rate.
Cyclic AMP, PKA activity, and Ca2+ handling proteins
Increased AC6mut expression was associated with reduced cAMP generation in normal car-
diac myocytes as we reported in our previous study [5]. Before and after seven days of isopro-
terenol infusion, we determined cAMP levels in cardiac myocytes isolated from AC6mut or
control mice (Fig 2A; S7 Fig). Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production was lower in LV
samples from AC6mut than from control mice before isoproterenol infusion (p<0.05). In

 addition, direct AC stimulation of cAMP was lower in cardiac myocytes from AC6mut mice
both before (p<0.03) and after 7d isoproterenol infusion (95% reduction, p = 0.0002).
PKA activity in cardiac myocytes isolated from AC6mut or control mice was also deter-
mined before and after seven days of isoproterenol infusion (Fig 2B; S8 Fig). AC-stimulated
PKA activity (NKH) was lower in cardiac myocytes from AC6mut than from control mice
before isoproterenol infusion (p<0.03; Fig 2B; S8 Fig), but no group differences were seen
after 7d isoproterenol infusion.
Fig 2. LV cAMP, PKA Activity and Signaling Proteins. A. Cyclic AMP Generation. LV membranes from AC6mut (M) and
control mice (C) were used to measure cAMP production before (No Iso, n = 5) and after 7d isoproterenol infusion (7d Iso,
n = 5). Membranes were stimulated with isoproterenol (Iso; 10 μM, 10 min) or NKH477 (NKH, a water-soluble direct AC
stimulant; 10 μM, 10 min). Cyclic AMP production was lower in LV from AC6mut than from control mice before and after 7d
isoproterenol infusion. B. PKA Activity in isolated cardiac myocytes before (No Iso, n = 5) and after 7d isoproterenol infusion
(7d Iso, n = 5). Cardiac myocytes were stimulated with isoproterenol (Iso; 10 μM, 10 min) or NKH477 (NKH, 10 μM, 10 min).
PKA activity (μmol/mg/min) was lower in cardiac myocytes from AC6mut (M) than from control mice (C) before isoproterenol
infusion, but no group differences were seen after 7d isoproterenol infusion. C. There was no group difference in total or
phosphorylated PLB, total or phosphorylated troponin-I or CREB phosphorylation after 7d of continuous isoproterenol
infusion. However, there were pre-Iso group differences in total PLB (reduced in AC6mut, p<0.003), and in P-TnI (reduced in
AC6mut, p = 0.005). In these instances, 7d isoproterenol was associated with reduced levels in the control animals, such
that there no longer were group differences. D. LV SERCA2a protein showed group differences (2-Way ANOVA: Interaction:
p = 0.29; Iso: p = 0.44; Gene: p = 0.002). Seven days Iso increased LV SERCA2a in AC6mut (M) mice vs control (p = 0.01).

 Cardiac-directed AC6mut expression had no effects on PKA substrates such as phosphory-
lation of phospholamban (PLB) at Ser16, troponin I (TnI) at Ser22/23, or cAMP-responses ele-
ment binding protein (CREB) at Ser133 after 7d isoproterenol infusion (Fig 2C).
However, there were pre-Iso group differences in total PLB (reduced in AC6mut, p<0.003),
and in P-TnI (reduced in AC6mut, p = 0.005). In these instances, 7d isoproterenol was associ-
ated with reduced levels in the control animals, such that there no longer were group differ-
ences. Table 2 shows quantitative analysis of immunoblotting data in Fig 2C.
In contrast, SERCA2a protein expression was higher in LV from AC6mut mice than in con-
trol mice after 7d sustained isoproterenol infusion (p<0.01, Fig 2D; S9 Fig).
Calcineurin activity, NFAT phosphorylation & FHL1 expression
LV-to-tibial length (LV/TL) ratios were increased by 7d isoproterenol (2-Way ANOVA:
Interaction: p = 0.80; Iso: p<0.0001; Gene: p = 0.43), and differences were seen within groups
(control: p = 0.02; AC6mut: p = 0.0001) (Fig 3A; S10 Fig). There were no between-group
differences before or 7d after continuous isoproterenol infusion. LV calcineurin activity
showed no group difference prior to isoproterenol infusion. However, 7d of continuous iso-
proterenol infusion was associated with a 39% increase in LV calcineurin activity in control
mice (p = 0.03) while AC6mut mice showed no change (Fig 3B; S11 Fig). AC6mut mice
showed lower calcineurin activity vs control mice after 7d isoproterenol (p<0.01). In addition,
after 7d isoproterenol infusion, Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells 3 (NFATC3) (p = 0.001)
and NFATC4 phosphorylation (p<0.001) were greater in LV samples from AC6mut mice vs
control (Fig 3C; S12 Fig). Sustained isoproterenol infusion was associated with lower levels of
Four and a Half LIM domains protein 1 (FHL1) protein in LV samples from AC6mut mice
(p<0.01), although no group difference was present prior to isoproterenol (Fig 3D; S13 Fig).
LV FHL1 mRNA expression also was reduced in AC6mut mice after isoproterenol infusion
(Fig 3D; S14 Fig).

 Cardiac myocyte apoptosis
There was a group difference in TUNEL-positive nuclei after 7d isoproterenol infusion. Con-
trol mice showed a 2.1-fold increase in LV apoptotic nuclei (p = 0.03; Fig 4A; S15 Fig), while
AC6mut mice showed no change. Control mice show more apoptosis vs AC6mut mice after
7d isoproterenol (p<0.03). LV caspase 3/7 activity was 1.3-fold higher in control mice after
isoproterenol infusion (p = 0.012, Fig 4B; S16 Fig). AC6mut expression was associated with
increased Bcl2 protein (p<0.0001; Fig 4C; S17 Fig). Bcl2 was also increased after 7d isoproter-
enol in AC6mut mice (p<0.004). LV Bax protein expression showed no group difference (data
not shown).
LV fibrosis
In both groups, 7d isoproterenol infusion was associated with a small but significant increases
in LV fibrosis (control: p = 0.001; AC6mut: p<0.02; Fig 5A and 5B; S18 Fig). Periostin protein
was 3-fold lower in LV from AC6mut mice vs control mice after 7d isoproterenol infusion
Fig 3. LV hypertrophy. A. LV-to-Tibial length (LV/TL) ratios were increased by 7d isoproterenol in both groups (2-Way ANOVA:
Interaction: p = 0.80; Iso: p<0.0001; Gene: p = 0.43) and differences were seen within groups (Control: p<0.02; AC6mut:
p = 0.0001; Sidak’s multiple comparison test). There were no between-group differences before or 7d after continuous
isoproterenol infusion. B. Calcineurin activity (PO4 release) in LV samples showed an overall group difference (2-way ANOVA:
Interaction: p<0.04; Iso: p = 0.085; Gene: p = 0.04). A 7d isoproterenol infusion resulted in increased calcineurin activity in control
mice (p = 0.03), not seen in AC6mut mice; AC6mut mice showed lower calcineurin activity vs control mice after 7d isoproterenol
(p<0.01). Between-group comparisons were made using Sidak’s multiple comparison test. C. LV phosphorylation of NFATC3
(p = 0.001) and NFATC4 (p<0.001) were higher after isoproterenol infusion in AC6mut (Mut) mice. D. LV FHL1 protein content (L
graph) was 3-fold greater in control than in AC6mut mice 7d after isoproterenol infusion (p<0.01), although FHL1 content was
similar in both groups before isoproterenol infusion. LV FHL1 mRNA (R graph) was higher in control than in AC6mut mice after 7d
isoproterenol. In C & D, p values are from Student’s t-test (unpaired, 2-tailed). In Figures displaying immunoblotting, summary data
are normalized to GAPDH.

(p = 0.008; Fig 5D; S20 Fig). Finally, after 7d isoproterenol LV from AC6mut mice showed
lower collagen-1 mRNA expression (p = 0.03; Fig 5D; S20 Fig). Periostin expression was unde-
tectable by immunoblotting prior to sustained isoproterenol infusion. However, mRNA levels
of periostin prior to sustained isoproterenol infusion showed no group difference (Control: 1.0
± 0.14; AC6mut: 0.84±0.07; n = 4, both groups; p = 0.34).
Necropsy
Table 3 shows data obtained at necropsy from four independent groups of mice. Isoproterenol
infusion for seven days was associated with an increase in LV weight and LV weight-to-tibial
length ratio in control and AC6mut mice (Fig 3A; S10 Fig and Table 3). Liver weight, normal-
ized to tibial length showed no group differences. Lung weight-to-tibial length was increased
in AC6mut mice that received 7d isoproterenol. However, left atrial weight-to-tibial length
ratios were increased after 7d isoproterenol in control mice (p<0.001) but not in AC6mut
mice. Finally, there were similar non-significant increases in right ventricular weight-to-tibial
length ratios after 7d isoproterenol in both groups.
Discussion
The most important conclusion from our studies is that mice with cardiac-directed expression
of AC6mut weather the deleterious effects of continuous isoproterenol infusion considerably
better than control mice. First, after seven days of isoproterenol infusion, mice with cardiac-
directed AC6mut expression exhibited superiority (vs control mice) in peak +dP/dt, peak -dP/
dt, the slope of the ESPVR, and cardiac output, which are measures of systolic, diastolic and
contractile function. Second, AC6mut mice, unlike control mice, did not show the expected
increase in cardiac myocyte apoptosis following isoproterenol infusion. These findings

(p<0.0001). Bcl2 was increased after 7d isoproterenol infusion in AC6mut (p<0.004). Between-group comparisons made using

 indicate that AC6mut expression protects the heart against β-adrenergic receptor stimulation,
and does so while preserving LV systolic and diastolic function despite lower levels of cardiac
cAMP. These findings provide a rationale for proceeding to additional preclinical studies—to
see whether AC6mut gene transfer has beneficial effects in pre-existing HF.
AC6mut transgenic line
The AC6mut transgenic line that we used produces a 17-fold increase in cardiac AC6mut pro-
tein (vs endogenous AC6) distributed to plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments [5],
thereby reducing cell-surface transduction of β-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling, as
well influencing protein:protein interactions within the cell. Although endogenous AC6
expression is unaltered in the AC6mut line [5], excess AC6mut likely played a dominant nega-
tive role in competing for Gsα and thereby impeding endogenous AC6 activation, thus

 explaining the 3.5-fold reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production in LV from
AC6mut mice (Fig 2A; S7 Fig).
In a previous publication describing the effects of targeted deletion of AC6, which reduced
LV cAMP generating capacity to a similar degree as does AC6mut expression, we found that
limiting cAMP production did not prevent isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy, indicating
that the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy does not require sustained increases in cardiac cAMP
levels. In the present study, the relative preservation of LV peak +dP/dt and peak -dP/dt in
AC6mut mice vs control after sustained isoproterenol infusion (Fig 1A, S1 Fig; Fig 1B, S2 Fig),
is likely due to the presence of cAMP-independent beneficial effects.
Group differences in LV function
The 7d isoproterenol infusion that we used in the current study had deleterious effects on LV
function in control mice that are similar to what we and others previously have reported [7],
[8],[11][12]. For example, a 4d isoproterenol infusion of 60 mg/kg/d (42 μg/kg/min) resulted
in similar decrements in ejection fraction and increases in end-systolic diameter in normal
C57B6 mice [12] to those we report here after a 7d isoproterenol infusion. Previous studies of
isoproterenol infusion of 7–14 days show consistent time-related increases in LV mass, which
vary somewhat by concentration and duration of infused isoproterenol, and whether data are
reported as total heart weight or LV weight normalized to body weight or to tibial length [7],
[8],[11] [12].
Seven days of isoproterenol infusion caused dilation of LV end-systolic diameter that was
similar in both groups (Table 1). However, the fall seen in LV ejection fraction after 7d isopro-
terenol infusion was less among AC6mut mice (Con: 26±2 percentage units; AC6mut: 17±3
percentage units; p = 0.047) a 31% relative reduction. This protective effect of AC6mut expres-
sion was mirrored in the AC6mut effect on LV +dP/dt (25% higher than control, p = 0.03, Fig
1A; S1 Fig) and LV -dP/dt (38% higher than control, p = 0.008, Fig 1B; S2 Fig). The ESPVR,

 perhaps the best measure of contractile function because of its relative independence of LV
loading conditions [13], showed a pronounced group difference—mean values for AC6mut
mice were 2-fold steeper than those in control mice (p = 0.003, Fig 1D; S4 Fig). Changes of
this magnitude would be anticipated to have an important physiological effect in clinical heart
failure. The slope of the ESPVR in human subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy was reported
to be reduced by 35% vs subjects with normal LV function [14], so a doubling of slope of the
ESPVR, as we report here, if translated to clinical settings, would restore normal function. Sim-
ilar decrements of LV peak +dP/dt have been reported in patients with heart failure in previous
studies [15],[16]
We previously reported that cardiac-directed AC6mut expression was associated with nor-
mal LV contractile response to acute isoproterenol stimulation despite impairment of cAMP
generating capacity through changes in LV Ca2+ handling [5]. In that previous study, which
did not employ sustained isoproterenol infusion, AC6mut expression was associated with
increased peak Ca2+ transients, and favorable alterations in LV Ca2+ handling proteins [5]. In
the present study, although we did not assess Ca2+ transients, SERCA2a, a key Ca2+ handling
protein, was expressed at a 2.7-fold higher level in LV from AC6mut than control mice 7d
after sustained isoproterenol infusion (Fig 2D; S9 Fig). The beneficial effects conferred by
AC6mut attenuated the deleterious effects of isoproterenol, leading to group differences in LV
function and decreased apoptosis, each with correlative molecular signaling events that pro-
vide mechanistic insight.
Cardiac function in the AC6mut line appears to contradict the usual close relationship
between cAMP generating capacity and LV function. For example, a 50% reduction in LV
cAMP is seen in severe HF in multiple preclinical models, with a proportional decrement in
LV function [17,18]. Furthermore, AC6 deletion reduces LV cAMP generating capacity and
LV function proportionately [4]. A striking finding in the present study is that despite a
marked reduction in cAMP generating capacity associated with AC6mut expression, LV func-
tion, compared to control mice, is unimpaired before [5], and superior to control mice after
sustained isoproterenol infusion (Fig 1A, 1B and 1D; S1, S2 and S4 Figs).
Isoproterenol-related LV hypertrophy
Increases in LV mass occur with even brief administration of isoproterenol. In the present
study after a 7d isoproterenol infusion, we saw a 22% increase in LV-to-tibial length ratio in
control mice, and a 20% increase in AC6mut mice (Fig 3A, S10 Fig; and Table 3). The infu-
sion caused an increase in calcineurin activity in control mice, which cardiac-directed
AC6mut expression mitigated (Fig 3B; S11 Fig). Calcineurin decreases phosphorylation of
NFATC3, one of the transcription factors in the NFAT family, and thereby promotes NFATC3
entry into the nucleus, which then activates the hypertrophic gene program [19],[20]. The
attenuation of isoproterenol-related increases in LV calcineurin activity among AC6mut mice
was associated with increased NFATC3 phosphorylation (Fig 3B and 3C: S11 and S12 Figs),
which would be predicted to reduce its nuclear entry. The importance of NFATC4 transloca-
tion and its role in the attenuation of hypertrophy is less well established. We also saw reduced
LV FHL1 after isoproterenol infusion in AC6mut mice (Fig 3D; S13 Fig). FHL1 plays an
important role in stress-induced LV hypertrophy and its deletion attenuates pressure-induced
LV hypertrophy [21].
Despite favorable effects that would be predicted to attenuate hypertrophy (reduced calci-
neurin activity, increased NFAT, reduced FHL1 expression), there were no group differences in
LV hypertrophy after sustained isoproterenol infusion. However, if these potentially beneficial
alterations are present when AC6mut mice are challenged by other models of HF (myocardial

 infarction-induced HF, pressure stress), reduction in hypertrophy may be seen. Additional
studies are needed to address this possibility.
We saw an increase in lung weight-to-tibial length ratio in AC6mut mice (Table 3) 7d after
isoproterenol infusion, a finding that can indicate lung congestion. However, left atrial weight-to
tibial length ratio, an indicator of left atrial enlargement, was increased only in control mice after
7d isoproterenol, making the difference in lung weight less likely a consequence of congestion.
Cardiac myocyte apoptosis
Sustained infusion of isoproterenol induces cardiac myocyte apoptosis. We found a 2-fold
increase in apoptotic rate after 7d isoproterenol infusion in control animals (Fig 4A; S15 Fig),
an increase that is similar to what others have reported using similar doses and duration of iso-
proterenol infusion [22],[23]. There was a corresponding increase in caspase 3/7 activity (Fig
4B; S16 Fig) and reduced Bcl2 expression (Fig 4C; S17 Fig). All of these changes were abro-
gated by cardiac-directed AC6mut expression (Fig 4A, 4B and 4C: S15–S17 Figs). Since car-
diac myocyte apoptosis is deleterious in the failing heart [24], and sustained β-adrenergic-
receptor stimulation is common in patients with heart failure, reducing β-adrenergic-recep-
tor-stimulated apoptosis would be predicted to benefit the failing heart.
Cardiac fibrosis
We saw reduced expression of periostin protein (Fig 5C; S19 Fig) and mRNA (Fig 5D; S20
Fig), and reduced collagen 1 mRNA (Fig 5D; S20 Fig) in AC6mut mice compared to control
mice following sustained isoproterenol infusion—changes that would be predicted to reduce
fibrosis. However, there were similar modest increases in fibrosis in both groups after isopro-
terenol infusion (Fig 5A and 5B; S18 Fig). It is plausible that isoproterenol infusion for a lon-
ger period or, alternatively, pressure stress, may result in group differences in fibrosis, given
these changes in LV periostin and collagen 1 expression. Periostin is an extracellular matrix
protein that is expressed and secreted by cardiac fibroblasts. Pathological stress, such as pres-
sure overload or myocardial infarction, increases cardiac periostin expression. Periostin, by
regulating collagen deposition, alters the mechanical properties of tissues. Cardiac-directed
expression of periostin increases LV collagen deposition and aging-associated LV hypertrophy
[25]. In contrast, periostin deletion decreases cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis after pressure
overload [25]. We previously reported increased periostin expression in AC6 deleted mice
after transaortic constriction, which provides a pressure stress on the heart [11]. The precise
mechanism for how AC6mut reduces LV periostin expression—and its implication in other
models of HF—will require additional studies.
C1C2 vs AC6mut
In the present study, mice with cardiac-directed AC6mut expression were less susceptible to
the toxic effects of isoproterenol, with relative preservation of both systolic and diastolic func-
tion. The putative mechanism for improved LV function was likely, at least in part, a result of a
2.7-fold increase in LV SERCA2a expression, an effect that may have increased LV function
despite reduced cAMP production. Similar findings were described in cardiac-directed expres-
sion of the cytoplasmic domains (C1C2) of AC6, a smaller molecule that, absent the two trans-
membrane moieties of the intact AC6 molecule, is isolated from the plasma membrane, and
present inside the cell [26]. However, unlike AC6mut, C1C2 retains catalytic activity. C1C2
expression, similar to AC6mut, did not increase phosphorylation of phospholamban or tropo-
nin I, but increased SERCA2a by 2.6-fold and protected the heart from isoproterenol toxicity.
However, cAMP-generating capacity is greater in C1C2 mice than in AC6mut mice, and the

 two have not been compared to determine their relative in efficacy in treating HF using gene
transfer.
AC6mut gene transfer
The logical next step toward the translation of the present studies to clinical application is
additional preclinical studies testing whether AC6mut gene transfer is beneficial in pre-exist-
ing HF. In a previous study, we examined the effects of AC6mut expression in cultured cardiac
myocytes using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer [3]. AC6mut gene transfer resulted in
marked reduction in cAMP generating capacity and reductions in apoptosis and phenyleph-
rine-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. The effects of AC6mut vs AC6 gene transfer were
similar, indicating that beneficial effects do not require increased cAMP generation [3]. Fur-
ther studies will determine whether the beneficial effects seen after AC6mut gene transfer in
cultured cardiac myocytes also occur after gene transfer in the intact failing heart.
Limitations of present study
A potential limitation of the present study is that we did not examine Ca2+ transients. Our
focus instead was on the deleterious effects of sustained isoproterenol infusion on function
and structure of the intact heart. However, a 2.7-fold higher level of LV SERCA2a in AC6mut
mice after Iso (Fig 2D; S9 Fig) would be predicted to have important effects on Ca2+ transients
[27], as we have previously reported in AC6mut mice [5]. Finally, although the AC6mut line
prevented some of the deleterious effects of isoproterenol infusion, translation to clinical stud-
ies will require treating pre-existing HF using AC6mut gene transfer.
Conclusion
Cardiac-directed expression of AC6mut enabled mice to weather the deleterious effects of con-
tinuous isoproterenol infusion considerably better than control mice. AC6mut expression had
beneficial effects on LV systolic, diastolic, and contractile function, and it reduced apoptosis.
These findings indicate that AC6mut expression protects the heart against some aspects of β-
adrenergic receptor stimulation, and does so while preserving LV systolic and diastolic func-
tion despite lower levels of cardiac cAMP. These findings provide a rationale for proceeding to
the next logical preclinical study—to see whether AC6mut gene transfer has benefits in pre-
existing heart failure.
