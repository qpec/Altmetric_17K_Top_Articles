Background. Diarrheal disease from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant worldwide morbidity and mor-
tality in young children residing in endemic countries and is the leading cause of traveler’s diarrhea. As ETEC enters the body 
through the oral cavity and cotransits the digestive tract with salivary components, we hypothesized that the antimicrobial activity 
of salivary proteins might extend beyond the oropharynx into the proximal digestive tract.
Results. Here, we show that the salivary peptide histatin-5 binds colonization factor antigen I pili, thereby blocking adhesion 
of ETEC to intestinal epithelial cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that histatin-5 stiffens the typically dynamic pili, abolishing 
their ability to function as spring-like shock absorbers, thereby inhibiting colonization within the turbulent vortices of chyme in the 
gastrointestinal tract.
Conclusions. Our data represent the first report of a salivary component exerting specific antimicrobial activity against an 
enteric pathogen and suggest that histatin-5 and related peptides might be exploited for prophylactic and/or therapeutic uses. 
Numerous viruses, bacteria, and fungi traverse the oropharynx to cause disease, so there is considerable opportunity for various sali-
vary components to neutralize these pathogens prior to arrival at their target organ. Identification of additional salivary components 
with unexpectedly broad antimicrobial spectra should be a priority.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are gram-negative 
bacilli that are endemic to developing countries. This organ-
ism causes significant worldwide morbidity and mortality 
by producing a cholera-like watery diarrhea in travelers and 
infants residing in endemic countries [1, 2]. ETEC can not only 
cause acute life-threatening hypovolemia, but has also been 
associated with chronic malnutrition [3] that can manifest as 
stunted growth [4] and/or impaired cognitive development [5]. 
Although the diarrheal illness is typically self-limited (~3 days) 
and mortality appears to be declining in recent years, the mark-
edly high incidence of >1 billion cases results in hundreds of 
thousands of deaths each year [6]. The pathogenicity of ETEC 
proceeds by initial colonization of the small intestine, mediated 
by adhesive pili [7, 8] and subsequent elaboration of heat-labile 
and/or heat-stabile toxins that activate nucleotide cyclases and 
result in the secretion of copious intraluminal fluids [9].
As ETEC is an extracellular pathogen, epithelial adhesion is 
paramount for colonization of the small intestine in the face of 
ruminating vortices of chyme and other fluidic peristaltic forces. 
ETEC accomplishes this task in part via colonization factors, 
including colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) [7, 8], which are 
pili (also called fimbriae) that extend approximately 1–2 µm from 
the bacterial surface, and individually comprise approximately 
1000 helically arranged CFA/I fimbrial subunit B (CfaB) proteins 
that terminate in a specialized tip adhesin, CFA/I fimbrial sub-
unit E (CfaE) [10–12]. The helical arrangement of CfaB mono-
mers is created by 2 interactions. The first involves donation of its 
N-terminus to an adjacent CfaB to complete a β-barrel immuno-
globulin-like fold [10, 11, 13]. This tandem donor strand comple-
mentation results in an elongated filament topologically similar to 
a string of sausages. A second and far weaker interaction occurs 
between the lateral surfaces of CfaB (subunit i to subunit i+3) 
and gives rise to the single-start, right-handed helical quaternary 
structure with approximately 3 subunits per helical turn [10, 12]. 
These lateral interactions break at tensions greater than approxi-
mately 8 pN, but they quickly reform when the tension is reduced 
[14]. This dynamic uncoiling and recoiling is a common property 
of pili from bacteria that colonize aqueous host environments

(eg, reference [15]), and has the effect of dampening the inces-
sant shear forces exerted on the adhered bacteria by their host. 
Thus, this spring-like mechanism inherent to pili in combination 
with adhesion mediated by the CfaE tip adhesin is essential to 
initiating and maintaining adhesion to the target tissue [16, 17].
Antimicrobial peptides play critical roles in human defenses 
against infection and inflammation. For example, secretions 
from Paneth cells in the intestines are essential for maintaining 
intestinal homeostasis [18]. Among the numerous components 
of saliva is a class of antimicrobial cationic, histidine-rich pep-
tides called histatins. These small, intrinsically disordered pep-
tides are abundantly present in saliva and possess antimicrobial 
activity against the oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis 
[19] and Candida albicans [20]. Here, we show that the oral 
antimicrobial peptide, cationic histatin-5, binds to and stiffens 
negatively charged CFA/I pili on ETEC, inhibiting this patho-
gen from sustaining adherence to intestinal cells.
METHODS
Cell Culture and Fluorescence Microscopy
Differentiated Caco-2 cells (14–17 days) prepared as in Anantha 
et al [21] were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 
Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) media with 1% 
mannose was added to each well. Peptide at 100 µM, or EMEM, or 
anti-CfaE polyclonal antibodies at 0.4 mg/mL were added to ETEC 
strain E7473 (kind gift of Dr Stephen J. Savarino, Naval Medical 
Research Center) adjusted to an optical density of 1.5 (wavelength 
of 650 nm), incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C, and added to the 
Caco-2 cultured cells for 3 hours at room temperature (RT) or 
37°C, and washed with PBS. Cells (and any bound bacteria) were 
fixed in 4% formaldehyde (15 minutes, RT), washed, and incu-
bated in blocking buffer (1 hour, 20°C; 1% bovine serum albumin 
[BSA], 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS). To visualize bound bacteria, 
anti–E. coli antibody (Pierce) was added to each well and incu-
bated overnight at 4°C. After 3 washes, each well was incubated 
with AlexaFluor-488 goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; 
Invitrogen) for 1–2 hours at 20°C to visualize bacteria, and stained 
with 4’
,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Scientific) to 
visualize Caco-2 cell nuclei. For 2 independent experiments, 3–5 
digital epifluorescence images were recorded from each of dupli-
cate wells for each condition. Total cells and adhered bacteria were 
counted using “find maxima” in ImageJ [22]; number of cells with 
bacteria bound were counted manually.
Human small intestinal tissue was obtained by endoscopic 
ileal biopsy of a 51-year-old woman (blood group O+) from 
the Digestive Disease Research Core Center Biobank in accord 
with Washington University School of Medicine’s institutional 
review board after informed consent was obtained. Human 
intestinal enteroids were passaged, maintained, and recovered 
as previously described by our group [23]. In brief, enteroids 
were grown in 3D Matrigel cultures for 72 hours at 37°C and 
5% carbon dioxide (CO2), after which they were trypsinized 
and dissociated through a 70-µm cell strainer. Cells were resus-
pended in 50% L-WRN (ATCC® CRL-3276) conditioned media 
containing 10 µM Y-27632 (Rho-associated protein kinase 
inhibitor) and 10 µM SB-431542 (transforming growth fac-
tor [TGF]-βI receptor inhibitor) prior to being added to 
 
trans-well pretreated with 34 µg/mL collagen IV in 3.3 mM 
 
acetic acid for 1 hour at 37°C. Transepithelial resistance (TER) 
was measured and media was changed daily. After the monolay-
ers became confluent (determined by a plateaued TER) [23, 24], 
differentiation of cells was facilitated by changing the media 
to 5% L-WRN conditioned media containing 10 µM TGF-βIR 
inhibitor and incubating for 24 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2.
ETEC (strain H10407) was grown overnight under static con-
ditions at 37°C. Primary human intestinal epithelial cell mono-
layers were infected and analyzed in a similar fashion to Sheikh 
et al [25]. In brief, the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 
either PBS, PBS containing 100 μM histatin-5, or PBS contain-
ing 100 μM scrambled peptide, which is a peptide with the same 
amino acid composition as histatin-5, but in randomized order. 
After washing, the epithelial monolayer was coincubated with 
the diluted ETEC culture for 1 hour at 37°C and then washed 
with the respective PBS-based solution. The transwells were fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% 
Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4°C with polyclonal 
rabbit anti-078 (1:200) in PBS with 1% BSA. The transwells were 
washed and incubated with antirabbit AlexaFluor 488 (1:200) in 
PBS with 1% BSA. The transwells were excised with a scalpel and 
slide mounted with Prolong Gold containing DAPI under a cover 
slip. Epifluorescence images were obtained of mucus-free regions 
with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with an Axiocam MRM 
camera with an Apotome optical sectioning filter. The resulting 
dataset was composed of 5 transwells per condition with an aver-
age of 27 high-power fields taken per transwell.
Chemical Cross-linking
CFA/I pili or expressed and purified donor strand comple-
mented CfaB with a 19 residue linker (dscCfaB) monomers (a 
kind gift from Dr Savarino) [10] at 20 μM was incubated alone 
and with either histatin-5 or scrambled histatin-5 (80 μM) 
(both from 21st Century Biochemicals) for 1 hour at 20°C in 
10 mM HEPES (pH 7.6). The solution was chemically cross-
linked by the addition of glutaraldehyde at several concentra-
tions between 0 and 0.1% for 1 hour, after which the reaction 
was quenched by the addition of 10% 1 M glycine for 1 hour. 
Loading buffer (5 M urea, 1.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% 
β-mercaptoethanol) was added at 30% by volume and the sam-
ples were electrophoresed through 18% tricine polyacrylamide 
gels and stained with Coomassie blue.

previously described [10] at a ratio of 13.2 µM:3.3 µM pep-
tide:pilin in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4–7.6 for 30 minutes at 37°C. 
Images of negatively stained samples (1% uranyl acetate) were 
recorded on film using a Philips CM12 EM, and digitized at 
2000 or 4000 dpi. Filament diameters were calculated using 
1-D projections of filament segments, vertically aligned using 
EMAN software [26]. Persistence length was calculated using 
MatLab software algorithms described in Li et al [27].
RESULTS
We began our investigation by incubating CFA/I-producing 
ETEC with differentiated Caco-2 cells. In Figure 1, we dis-
play the effect of several peptides on ETEC adherence. We 
found that histatin-5 and anti-CfaE antibodies (against the tip 
adhesin), which have previously been shown to prevent colo-
nization in human subjects [16, 17], decrease both the num-
ber of bacteria bound to each Caco-2 cell as well as the fraction 
of cells with adherent bacilli. Neither a peptide with the same 
amino acids as histatin-5 but in a scrambled order (scrambled 
peptide) nor an unrelated peptide of similar size, villin head-
piece HP36 [28], recapitulated this inhibition of adherence 
(Figure 1). The decreased adherence of ETEC to Caco-2 cells is 
independent of any effect that histatin-5 might have on Caco-2 
cells themselves as 100 µM histatin-5 (the maximum inhibitory 
dose) equivalently blocks binding to both live Caco-2 cells 
(Figure 1) and Caco-2BBE cells previously fixed with 4% PFA 
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Although Caco-2 cells are well differentiated and mimic many 
features of small intestinal epithelial cells, they are nonetheless 
a transformed cell line derived originally from a colonic tumor. 
To recapitulate a more physiological interaction, we next exam-
ined ETEC interactions with a primary culture of human small 
bowel epithelium in 2-dimensional polarized monolayers. These 
“enteroid”-derived monolayers feature stem cells and essentially 
normal differentiation and distribution of mature cellular lin-
eages (enterocytes, Paneth, Goblet, and Enteroendocrine cells 
[23]). In Figure 2, we confirm the previous results with Caco-2 
cells, demonstrating that adding histatin-5 to co-cultures of 
ETEC and enteroid monolayers caused a significant decrease 
in the number of ETEC per high-power field. A much smaller, 
although statistically significant, effect was observed on ETEC 
adherence in the presence of scrambled peptide.
As ETEC adherence is mediated by CFA/I pili, we used chem-
ical cross-linking to find that histatin-5 binds directly to CFA/I 
pili (Figure 3A). Furthermore, in the presence of histatin-5 (and 
scrambled peptide), we observed higher-order chemically cross-
linked species (Figure 3A and 3B) that were not observed in 
the absence of these small peptides (Figure 3C). Because we did

not observe similar higher-order species in experiments using 
the monomeric pilin dscCfaB, these data are best explained by 
histatin-5 (and scrambled peptide) binding within the largely 
negatively charged grooves [10] between adjacent pilins in the 
native CFA/I quaternary structure (Figure 3E–G).
To find a structural explanation for the inhibition of adher-
ence mediated by histatin-5, we employed electron microscopy 
to look for ultrastructural changes in the CFA/I pili. Although 
the measured length of CFA/I pili did not differ in the pres-
ence of histatin-5, as shown in Figure 4, we found the pili to be

remarkably straighter, the diameter to be increased by 8% (6.4–
6.9 nm), and the central channel to be less pronounced when 
histatin-5 was added at 13.2 µM, a concentration comparable to 
that measured in parotid secretions (14 µM) [29]. The increased 
diameter of pili is consistent with our chemical cross-linking 
data in that histatin-5 appears to be binding homogeneously 
along the pilus. The diameters of pili in the presence of scram-
bled peptide or villin headpiece were both slightly increased 
(3%; 6.4–6.6 nm). The persistence length, a measure of intrinsic 
rigidity or stiffness, was profoundly increased in the presence of 
histatin-5 and, to a lesser extent, by scrambled peptide, but not 
by villin headpiece (Figure 4C). The moderate increase in per-
sistence length observed in the presence of scrambled peptide 
correlates with the small but statistically significant decrease in 
ETEC adherence (Figure 2) as well as chemical cross-linking 
data (Figure 3). This effect is likely a consequence of the pro-
posed electrostatic association between pili and peptide in the 
context of low sequence complexity characteristic of this class 
of intrinsically disordered histatins, and suggests that other cat-
ionic histatins might exhibit similar antimicrobial activity.
Last, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to further 
characterize the consequences of histatin-5 binding to CFA/I 
pili in solution. In the presence of histatin-5, the 2-dimensional 
radius of gyration increased from 26.2 to 50.7 Å (Supplementary 
Figure 2A and 2B), consistent with histatin-5 promoting CFA/I 
pili to laterally assemble into a bundle-like arrangement of approx-
imately 3 pilus filaments. Subsequent electron micrographs con-
firmed this propensity for lateral association (Supplementary 
Figure 2C) at high concentrations of both proteins. The high pilus 
concentrations employed in SAXS might be more relevant in situ, 
as the presence of hundreds of pili emanating from the membrane 
of each bacillus greatly increases their effective concentration.
DISCUSSION
In this communication, we demonstrate that the salivary anti-
microbial peptide histatin-5 exhibits specific activity against 
CFA/I pili that reduces the adherence of ETEC to intestinal epi-
thelial cells. This reduced activity at concentrations that could 
be therapeutically induced is a consequence of histatin-5 bind-
ing to CFA/I pili and increasing their stiffness, as evidenced 
by a dramatic increase in persistence length at concentrations 
of histatin-5 (13.2 µM) that are comparable to those found in 
whole saliva and parotid secretions (3 µM and 14 µM, respec-
tively) [29]. Furthermore, at higher concentrations of CFA/I 
pili such as those that might be found on bacterial surfaces, 
histatin-5 promotes lateral association between adjacent pili. 
The stiffening of and the lateral association between CFA/I pili 
will compromise the ability of this essential virulence factor to 
dampen the shear forces exerted on the bacillus by the vortices 
of chyme and other fluidic peristaltic forces in the small intes-
tine, and thus colonization will be inhibited. Our new insights 
into these structural intra- and interpilus interactions might be 
used to develop novel strategies for the prevention and treat-
ment of ETEC infections through manipulating abundance of 
antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, this may represent a more 
general mechanism by which saliva inhibits enteric and even 
pulmonary pathogens as all of these pathogens must traverse 
the oropharynx prior to arriving at their target organs.
ETEC’s predilection for young children (<5 years old) and 
immunologically naive adults is thought to relate to immunity 
afforded by prior infections. Accordingly, ETEC vaccine develop-
ment efforts have targeted colonization factors including the CFA/I 
pili in addition to other virulence factors [30, 31]. Significant het-
erogeneity of the >25 antigenically distinct colonization factors

point mutations scattered about the CFA/I pili [10, 33], have con-
founded vaccine efforts. An inexpensive, therapeutic, and/or pro-
phylactic strategy may be a useful supplement to the vaccination 
efforts, especially in travelers to endemic countries.
Thus, we propose that primary prophylaxis with the naturally 
occurring histatin-5 for individuals traveling to ETEC-endemic 
regions would be an efficacious addition to vaccination and 
treatment with antibiotics. This small peptide can be chem-
ically synthesized (as in this work), is intrinsically disordered 
and thus cannot be denatured, and can be stored as powder that 
dissolves instantaneously in water.
We believe that our data represent the first example of a new 
paradigm in innate immunity: the contributions of salivary 
components to preventing extraoral infection. This research 
opens an untapped avenue for prevention of enteric infectious 
diseases through the targeted use of naturally occurring com-
ponents of saliva.
