TEV-48125 for the preventive treatment
of chronic migraine
Efficacy at early time points
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the onset of efficacy of TEV-48125, a monoclonal antibody against calci-
tonin gene-related peptide, recently shown to be effective for the preventive treatment of chronic
migraine (CM) and high-frequency episodic migraine.
Methods: A randomized placebo-controlled study tested once-monthly injections of TEV-48125
675/225 mg or 900 mg vs placebo. Headache information was captured daily using an electronic
headache diary. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in the number of headache hours
in month 3. Herein, we assess the efficacy of each dose at earlier time points.
Results: The sample consisted of 261 patients. For headache hours, the 675/225-mg dose sep-
arated from placebo on day 7 and the 900-mg dose separated from placebo after 3 days of ther-
apy (p 5 0.048 and p 5 0.033, respectively). For both the 675/225-mg and 900-mg doses, the
improvement was sustained through the second (p 5 0.004 and p , 0.001) and third (p 5 0.025
and p , 0.001) weeks of therapy and throughout the study (month 3, p 5 0.0386 and p 5
0.0057). For change in weekly headache days of at least moderate intensity, both doses were
superior to placebo at week 2 (p 5 0.031 and p 5 0.005).
Conclusions: TEV-48125 demonstrated a significant improvement within 1 week of therapy ini-
tiation in patients with CM.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with CM,
TEV-48125 significantly decreases the number of headache hours within 3 to 7 days of
injection. Neurology® 2016;87:41–48

Chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by headaches occurring on at least 15 days per month,
with at least 8 days of migraine per month.1 It affects approximately 1% of the adult popula-
tion2,3 and is the most frequently seen headache syndrome at major headache clinics and
neurology specialty centers.4,5 On the basis of ictal disability alone, migraine was ranked sixth
highest among specific causes of disability globally.6,7 Migraine-related disability is classified by
the World Health Organization as more burdensome than paraplegia, deafness, or angina, and at
the same level as psychosis and quadriplegia.8 Furthermore, relative to individuals with episodic
migraine or without headaches, those with CM are significantly more likely to be unemployed
or employable but not actively working for pay.9 Individuals with CM are also significantly more
likely to be divorced and to have psychological comorbidities.9
Despite its enormous burden, CM is undertreated. Effective treatment, at a minimum, re-
quires consultation with a physician, an accurate diagnosis, and receiving appropriate treatment.

 In the United States, less than 5% of persons
with CM are able to traverse all 3 of these hur-
dles, and only a third of those with CM receive
preventive medications.10 Furthermore, 1-year
adherence to labeled or off-label migraine pre-
ventive medication among individuals with
CM occurs in less than 20% of patients. The
most important reasons for discontinuation of
preventive medications among individuals
with CM appear to be incomplete efficacy,
as well as slow time to reach meaningful effi-
cacy, and poor tolerability.10,11 It has been sug-
gested that fast onset of efficacy of migraine
drugs may have significant implications for
patients, since it would favor compliance and
improve long-term outcomes.12
TEV-48125 is a fully humanized monoclo-
nal antibody that potently and selectively binds
to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).13
Its efficacy in the preventive treatment of CM
was demonstrated in a large phase 2b study,
where both tested doses separated from placebo
after 1 month of therapy for primary, second-
ary, and exploratory endpoints.14 Since statisti-
cally significant effects were seen very early in
that trial, herein we conducted post hoc analy-
ses to evaluate the efficacy of 2 doses of sub-
cutaneous TEV-48125 within the first few
weeks of therapy in patients with CM.
METHODS Study design and patients. The current study
represents post hoc analyses conducted as part of a phase 2b trial
assessing the efficacy of TEV-48125 in the preventive treatment
of CM in adults.14 The randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, phase 2b study was conducted at 62 sites in the
United States (headache centers, neurology clinics, and primary
care facilities) and an independent clinical research organization,
NCGS, monitored the study, assessing for appropriate patient
eligibility, protocol adherence, and completeness and accuracy of
case report entries. Eligible study participants were men or women
aged 18 to 65 years with a history of CM as per the International
Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version).1
Headache and migraine frequencies were confirmed during
a prospective 28 days run-in period. Participants could continue
to use up to 2 different standard migraine preventive medications,
if on stable doses for at least 3 months before study onset. They were
allowed to treat their acute migraine attacks as usual and had to show
higher than 80% compliance in completing the electronic headache
diary during the 28-day run-in phase to participate in this study.
Patients were excluded if they had received onabotulinumtoxinA
during the 6 months before study entry or if 3 or more preventive
medications failed because of lack of efficacy.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was conducted in accordance with the prin-
ciples of Good Clinical Practice and the US Food and Drug
Administration guidelines for safety monitoring. All patients
provided written informed consent before enrollment. The
study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards
for each site, and the trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02021773).
Randomization and treatment procedures. After the run-in
period, participants were randomized (1:1:1) via an electronic
interactive web response system, which was accessible through
the eClinical Operating System Portal. Randomization was
stratified independently by sex and preventive medication use.
The randomization sequence was developed centrally by staff at
NCGS who had no further role in the study. Study sites had
2 blinded study coordinators at clinic visits, one for clinical
assessments
and
one
for
treatment
administration,
and
participants were masked to treatment allocations. Participants
randomized to the 900-mg arm received 4 active injections of
225 mg/1.5 mL once monthly. Those in the 675/225-mg arm
received an initial loading dose of 675 mg (3 active injections
of 225 mg and one placebo injection), followed by maintenance
doses of 225 mg (one active and 3 placebo injections) for the
second and third monthly treatments. Patients receiving placebo
received 4 placebo injections monthly. Adverse events, laboratory
findings, ECG, and concomitant drugs were captured monthly at
every visit.
Outcomes. As described previously,14 the primary endpoint
for the study was the mean change from baseline in the num-
ber of headache hours of any severity during the 28-day
posttreatment period ending with month 3. The secondary
endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the number of
headache days of at least moderate severity during month 3. Here,
we analyzed the weekly cumulative headache hours and headache
days of at least moderate severity in the first month by week and
further analyzed accumulative headache hours in the first 7 days
after the first dose of study medication.
Statistical analyses. Similar to the analyses conducted for the
primary and secondary endpoints, the mixed-effects model
repeated measurement analysis method was used for the post
hoc analyses reported herein of the weekly change-from-
baseline values for the number of headache hours and
moderate/severe headache days in first 4 weeks. We used
analysis of covariance for the post hoc intraweekly assessments.
For each given period (e.g., first week after treatment, or 3
days after treatment), baseline values were calculated using the
original monthly baseline value multiplied by a factor to
match the time period (in the examples given above, first week
or first 3 days, baseline value was the original monthly
baseline multiplied by 7/28, or 3/28). In additional post hoc
analyses, we calculated the absolute risk reduction and the
number needed to treat (NNT) in the proportion of patients
with at least a 50% reduction from baseline headache hours
and moderate/severe headache days in the first few weeks.
All statistical tests were 2-sided at a level of 0.05. All effi-
cacy variables were analyzed by the intent-to-treat principle,
which included all randomized participants who received at
least one dose of study drug and provided at least one endpoint
measurement. Overall compliance for baseline and first month
posttreatment was 92%. For the analyses presented herein, all
p values presented are nominal without multiplicity adjustment.
Analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

 occurred in December 2014. The sample consisted of
261 patients randomized to receive placebo (n 5 89),
675/225 mg (n 5 87), or 900 mg (n 5 85) (figure 1).
Demographics and clinical disease characteristics were
similar across groups and are described in table 1.
Mean overall age was 41 years, 86% of participants
were women, 83% were white, and 40% of partici-
pants used preventive medications at the time of the
study.
Planned analyses recap. A priori analyses have been
published.14 In brief, at baseline, participants had
a mean of 162 headache hours per month and a mean
of 22 headache days and 17 migraine days per month.
For the primary endpoint, least square mean (LSM)
change from baseline to month 3 in the number of
headache hours was 237.1 (SE 8.4) for placebo,
259.8 (8.6) for 675/225 mg (p 5 0.039, LSM dif-
ference 222.7, and 95% confidence interval [CI]:
244.28 to 21.21), and 267.5 (8.6) for 900 mg (p
5 0.006, LSM difference 230.4, and 95% CI:
251.88 to 28.95). At 1 month of therapy, the num-
ber of headache hours decreased from baseline for
placebo was 218.1 (7.1), 675/225 mg 5 244.1
(7.3; p 5 0.003); 900 mg 5 256.82 (7.3; p ,
0.001). At 2 months of therapy, the number of hours
decreased from baseline for placebo was 234.1 (8.0),
675/225 mg 5 258.3 (8.1; p 5 0.018); and 900 mg
5 266.2 (8.1; p 5 0.002).
Early time points: Headache hours. There were signifi-
cant decreases in the mean number of headache hours
after 1 week of therapy for both treatment doses rel-
ative to placebo. The LSM change from baseline to 1
week was 22.85 (2.21) hours for placebo, 29.08
(2.25) for 675/225 mg (p 5 0.031, LSM difference
26.22, and 95% CI: 211.86 to 20.59), and

 difference 28.52, and 95% CI: 214.27 to 22.87),
a benefit that was extended through the second and
third weeks of therapy (figure 2A). The 900-mg dose
first separated from placebo after 3 days of therapy
(23.08 hours vs 10.36 for placebo, p 5 0.0331).
The lower dose separated from placebo on day 7
(placebo 5 21.59 hours, 675/225 mg 5 27.28, p 5
0.0486, 900 mg 5 29.76, p 5 0.0048) (figure 2B).
As shown in table 2, the percent of patients with
a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of
headache hours increased in the TEV-48125 groups
relative to the placebo group in weeks 1 to 3, although
the NNTs at these early time points were high.
Early time points: Moderate to severe headache days. For
moderate to severe headache days, the lower dose,
675/225 mg, nonsignificantly reduced the number
of days with moderate severity headaches in week 1
and week 3 (LSM change from baseline 21.12 vs
placebo 20.77, p 5 0.167 for week 1, and 21.13
vs 20.74, p 5 0.142 for week 3). The 900 mg
showed separation after 1 week (21.26 vs 20.77
for placebo, p , 0.054). Both doses separated from
placebo after 2 weeks’ LSM change from baseline
(SE): 20.79 (0.19) for placebo, 21.34 (0.20) for
675/225 mg (p 5 0.031, LSM difference 20.55,
and 95% CI: 21.06 to 20.05), and 21.51 (0.20)
for 900 mg (p 5 0.005, LSM difference 0.73, and
95% CI: 21.23 to 20.22) (p 5 0.005) (figure 3).
The 900-mg dose continued to separate from the
placebo group in week 3 (21.39 vs 20.74, p 5
0.016).
The percent of patients with a 50% reduction
from baseline in the number of moderate to severe
headache days also increased in the TEV-48125
groups during weeks 1 to 3, although the NNTs, as
seen for headache hours, were also high (table 2).
DISCUSSION It has been previously demonstrated
that both doses of TEV-48125 were superior to
placebo
in
the
preventive
treatment
of
CM,
validating for the first time CGRP as a therapeutic
target in this disease. Since benefit was seen as early
as 1 month after starting therapy, we explored the
earliest time point at which efficacy began. The new
analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the
number of headache hours starting as soon as
3 days after the highest dose (900 mg) was given,
and 7 days after the lower dose (675/225 mg) was
given. For moderate or severe headache days,
a significant decrease was seen during the second
week of treatment for the 675/225-mg and 900-mg
doses. These data offer a glimpse of how quickly

 preventive treatment effects may occur for CGRP
monoclonal antibodies in CM.
The new analysis of the data demonstrates that
TEV-48125 can have an effect in some patients
within a week of therapy initiation. Regarding clinical
meaningfulness, it is not the purpose of summary
measures to provide such information, but rather to
offer the insight that some patients may benefit rela-
tively rapidly from a new therapy. The early onset of
effect is certainly of interest for at least 2 reasons.
First, perceived early efficacy may be a reinforcing fac-
tor for compliance to therapy, especially in the con-
text of well-tolerated medications. Second, the
timing of the onset of action provides important
insights on the relevance of CGRP in the pathophys-
iology of migraine.
Fast onset of headache improvement is a highly
desirable attribute for migraine medications.15 Oral
preventive medications must be titrated over weeks
to effective doses, and then administered daily for
approximately 3 months to establish efficacy.16,17
Although some patients respond quickly to onabotuli-
numtoxinA, the only approved CM preventive treat-
ment, response is often delayed.18 Clinical experience
also suggests that in many cases, adverse events with
migraine preventive medications are perceived nearly
immediately while efficacy requires time to be noticed.

 reinforcement for migraineurs and increase adherence
to therapy.
Other CGRP monoclonal antibodies when stud-
ied in episodic migraine have shown fast onset of effi-
cacy.19,20 It is known that circulating CGRP levels are
increased in CM relative to episodic migraine and in
episodic migraine relative to controls.21 CGRP-
containing peripheral nerve cells in the trigeminal
ganglion act as polymodal nociceptors, innervating
peripheral tissues and in response to stimuli, release
CGRP sending primary afferent sensory transmis-
sions to neurons in dorsal horn of the spinal cord,
the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), and the
nucleus of the solitary tract. These neurons in turn
project sensory inputs to the amygdala, hypothala-
mus, brainstem, and thalamus, which relay these in-
puts to the insular cortex.22–25 Monoclonal antibodies
are large molecules that mostly do not cross the
blood–brain barrier with immunoglobulin G plasma
to CSF ratio of 0.1%.26 As a result, it has been sug-
gested that modulation of CGRP outside the blood–
brain barrier induces nearly immediate modulation of
central pathways. This probable mechanism is sup-
ported by previous work suggesting that in humans,
IV administration of CGRP, which does not cross the
blood–brain barrier, induces migraine attacks in in-
dividuals with migraine.27 Antibodies could bind to
the CGRP released at trigeminal nerve endings,
thereby avoiding the peripheral events of migraine
and consequent sensory transmission to central
second-order neurons in the TNC, thus avoiding
the
secondary
central
sensitization
that
would
follow.28
Reduced
afferent
input
into
central
second-order neurons within the TNC could modu-
late neuronal activity and subsequent central trigem-
inal sensory transmission.
The study has important limitations that should
be considered. First, the analyses reported in this arti-
cle had not been a priori defined. Nonetheless, post
hoc analyses have an important role in further defin-
ing the benefits of any drug, including subsets of pa-
tients experiencing particular benefit29,30 or, as in our
case, providing preliminary evidence for future rigor-
ous assessments. Second, and most important, we
have not interviewed patients to check whether the
effect size at early time points was clinically meaning-
ful, and we do not suggest that they were for the early
time points, although they certainly are for what is
seen after 1 month of therapy, as the therapeutic gain
(placebo-subtracted difference) seems to suggest so.
In the pooled analyses of the onabotulinumtoxinA
pivotal trials, the therapeutic gain for moderate or
severe headache days after 6 months of therapy was
21.9.31 In the present study, after 1 month of ther-
apy, 900-mg and 675/225-mg doses yielded a thera-
peutic gain of values of respectively 22.8 and 22.0
days. Since clinical benefit may be a function of abso-
lute response rather than placebo-adjusted response,
future studies should incorporate patients’ subjective
assessment of improvement.

Comment:
Monoclonal antibodies in chronic migraine—Are early effects
meaningful?
Chronic migraine affects approximately 1% of the adult population and is
defined as headache on $15 d/mo with $8 days of migraine-type headache. Since
treatment often remains frustrating for both the patient and physician, new treat-
ment strategies are highly welcome.
No doubt, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP) for the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine
deserve to be called a breakthrough—not because they cure headache, but rather
because they are effective for relatively refractory headaches and were developed
based on the pathophysiologic concept that the trigeminovascular system and
CGRP have a key role in the development of migraine pain; this was not a seren-
dipitous discovery.
Recently, the authors presented convincing evidence that TEV-48125
reduced headache hours over 9 to 12 weeks.1 Here, they present data on early
effects, suggesting a reduction of headache hours within the first few weeks.2 But
statistical significance notwithstanding—how clinically meaningful is a reduction
of a few headache hours per week? A valid answer to this question is not given here
and would require multiple measurements and evidence to determine the benefit
for patients’ lives.
Are these data still important? Most definitely: first, there is a biological
effect with relatively quick onset, whether clinically meaningful or not. Second,
unlike with many established drugs, we do not see the early onset of adverse events
and later onset of clinical benefit, which often challenges patient adherence. Third,
mAbs do not cross the blood–brain barrier, hence the critical therapeutic target is,
rather, located peripherally and not in the brain.3 This reasoning, together with the
demonstrated rapid onset, strongly supports an important concept toward
improved understanding of migraine mechanisms and guidance of future drug
discovery. Finally, this study reinvigorates an attractive objective, namely, to treat
other chronic-refractory craniofacial pain syndromes with CGRP-neutralizing
mAbs, such as trigeminal neuropathic pain, chronic temporomandibular joint
pain, and, certainly, cluster headaches.
