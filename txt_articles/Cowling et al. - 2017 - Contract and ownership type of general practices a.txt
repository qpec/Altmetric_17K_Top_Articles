Summary
Objective: To examine associations between the contract
and ownership type of general practices and patient experi-
ence in England.
Design: Multilevel linear regression analysis of a national
cross-sectional patient survey (General Practice Patient
Survey).
Setting: All general practices in England in 2013–2014
(n ¼ 8017).
Participants: 903,357 survey respondents aged 18 years or
over and registered with a general practice for six months
or more (34.3% of 2,631,209 questionnaires sent).
Main outcome measures: Patient reports of experience
across five measures: frequency of consulting a preferred
doctor; ability to get a convenient appointment; rating of
doctor communication skills; ease of contacting the prac-
tice by telephone; and overall experience (measured on
four- or five-level interval scales from 0 to 100). Models
adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic characteris-
tics of respondents and general practice populations and a
random intercept for each general practice.
Results: Most practices had a centrally negotiated contract
with the UK government (‘General Medical Services’
54.6%; 4337/7949). Few practices were limited companies
with
locally
negotiated
‘Alternative Provider
Medical
Services’ contracts (1.2%; 98/7949); these practices pro-
vided worse overall experiences than General Medical
Services practices (adjusted mean difference �3.04, 95%
CI �4.15 to �1.94). Associations were consistent in direc-
tion across outcomes and largest in magnitude for fre-
quency of consulting a preferred doctor (�12.78, 95% CI
�15.17 to �10.39). Results were similar for practices
owned by large organisations (defined as having �20 prac-
tices) which were uncommon (2.2%; 176/7949).
Conclusions: Patients registered to general practices
owned by limited companies, including large organisations,
reported worse experiences of their care than other
patients in 2013–2014.

Introduction
General practices in England are independent busi-
nesses contracted to provide primary care for specified
populations. Most are owned by general practitioners,
but many types of organisation are now eligible to
deliver these services. For the first 50 years of the
National Health Service, a general practice typically
comprised one or more general practitioners working
in common premises under a standard contract with
the UK government. New types of contract were
introduced in 1998 and 2004 that are locally nego-
tiated and allow commercial, voluntary sector and
other new providers to offer general practice services
(online supplementary material – Appendix 1).1
Several governments have attempted to increase the
role of non-traditional providers across many parts of
the National Health Service over the past 17 years.2–4
Limited companies – businesses with a separate legal
identity to their owners – currently own less than 5%
of general practices;5 their likely share of the market in
the future is unclear.
Other countries have experienced changes in the
ownership of primary care providers. In Sweden,
patient choice of primary care provider and free estab-
lishment of accredited ‘private’ providers became
mandatory in 2010; large national corporations,
including those owned by venture capitalists, now

 run around one-third of private providers.6 In
Australia, primary care has been increasingly cor-
poratised since the 1990s when publicly listed compa-
nies first entered the market; three national or
international companies received around 12% of
market revenue in 2011.7 Opponents argue that the
profit motive of these organisations could lead them
to compromise patient care, while those in favour sug-
gest they will bring greater innovation.8 A national
cross-sectional time series analysis of general practices
in England suggested, using aggregate data, that non-
traditional providers performed worse across 15 of 17
quality indicators studied from 2008 to 2013.1
Patient experience is a key domain of performance
in the English National Health Service. Measures of
patient satisfaction with general practice services are
monitored nationally9 and presented to patients for
each practice on an information website.10 These
measures
are
derived from an
annual national
survey of patients registered with a general practi-
tioner – the General Practice Patient Survey.11
Questionnaires include items on practice organisa-
tion, appointment experiences and patient character-
istics.12 Previous multilevel analysis of the survey
suggests that commercial providers of out-of-hours
primary care (weekends and 18:30 to 08:00 on
weekdays) provided a worse experience of these
services than National Health Service and not-for-
profit providers in 2012–2013.13 No studies had con-
ducted a similar analysis, using the multilevel struc-
ture of the data, for in-hours general practice services.
We examined the association between patient
experience and the contract type of general practices
in England, distinguishing limited companies from
other practices. We also examined the performance
of organisations that owned 20 or more practices,
using
five
measures
from
the
General
Practice
Patient
Survey
2013–2014:
continuity
of
care;
appointment convenience; doctor communication;
ease of telephone contact; and overall experience.
Methods
Patient survey questionnaires
We analysed data from the English General Practice
Patient Survey 2013–2014 (July to September 2013 and
January to March 2014). Patients were eligible for
inclusion in the survey if they had a valid National
Health Service number, had been registered with a gen-
eral practice for six months or more, and were aged 18
years or over.14 All general practices in England with
eligible
patients
were
included
in
the
survey
(n ¼ 8017).14 Postal questionnaires were sent to strati-
fied random samples of patients from each practice,
with 903,357 responses for 8005 practices (34.3% of
2,631,209 questionnaires sent).14 This provided 113
responses per practice on average (standard deviation
18.5) which allows most measures to have good (�0.8)
or excellent (�0.9) practice level reliability.15
We used five patient experience measures as out-
comes: the frequency of consulting a preferred
doctor; ability to get a convenient appointment;
rating of doctor communication skills; ease of contact-
ing the practice by telephone; and the overall experi-
ence. These were assessed using four- or five-point
response scales, ranging, for example, from ‘very
good’ to ‘very poor’ for overall experience (online sup-
plementary material – Appendix 2). The measure of
doctor communication was a composite of five ques-
tions.16Wechosetheseoutcomemeasuresbecausethey
are important to patients, will be affected by organisa-
tional characteristics, have sufficient practice level reli-
ability and are policy-relevant.15,17,18 All outcomes
relate to in-hours, rather than out-of-hours, services.
We included five patient characteristics from the
questionnaires in analyses: age (eight ordinal cate-
gories);
gender;
ethnicity
(White,
mixed,
Asian,
Black, other); confidence in managing own health
(four ordinal categories); and the ability to take time
off work to see a general practitioner (no, yes, not
working). Socioeconomic status was measured as
fifths of the Index of Multiple Deprivation rank for
the small geographic areas (lower layer super output
areas with a mean population of 1500) in which
patients lived.19 Similar case mix adjustors have been
used in analysing the General Practice Patient Survey
previously.13,20
General practice ownership
We obtained routine contract data for 7949 general
practices included in the General Practice Patient
Survey; these data were taken from general practice
computer systems in September 2013.21 The four
types
of
contract
were:
‘General’,
‘Personal’,
‘Alternative Provider’, and ‘Primary Care Trust’ –
all suffixed with ‘Medical Services’ (online supple-
mentary material – Appendix 1). Limited companies
operate under the first three types, giving seven
categories of contract in total. In our first analysis,
we compared patient experience across these seven
categories, distinguishing limited companies from
other ownership forms. We refer to practices with
each contract by the differentiating first part of the
contract
name in the
remainder of the
article
(e.g. Alternative Provider practices).
In our second analysis, we identified general prac-
tices owned by large organisations (defined as having
20
or
more
practices)
from
existing
literature,
Cowling et al.
441
 published data and provider websites.3,22–26 We
thought that each large organisation would list a rep-
resentative sample, if not all, of its practices on its
website; in case not, we searched for additional prac-
tices using National Health Service and regulator
datasets that gave organisation names.23,25,26 We
then compared
the patient
experience
measures
between practices owned by large organisations and
practices operating under a General contract (typic-
ally small general practitioner partnerships working in
a single practice). Each large organisation was regis-
tered as a limited company. However, some practices
owned by large organisations were not recorded as
limited companies in the contract data, possibly due
to separate legal identities in complex business struc-
tures. Some practices registered as limited companies
were not owned by large organisations.
We included four characteristics of each general
practice’s registered population in analyses: popula-
tion size;21 age–gender profile (percentages in six age
categories for male and female patients);21 ethnicity
profile (percentages White, mixed, Asian, Black,
other);27 and the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2010
rank for the practice population.28 Population sizes
and age–gender profiles were extracted from general
practice computer systems in September 2013.21
Ethnicity data were taken from the 2011 census.27
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics for patient characteristics and
outcome measures included all survey respondents.
We excluded uninformative questionnaire responses
(such as ‘Can’t remember’) from all analyses,13 which
accounted for small percentages of responses for each
outcome measure (3% for ease of telephone contact,
for example). When estimating associations between
patient experience measures and explanatory vari-
ables, we excluded observations with missing data
for any of the variables included in the estimation.
We further excluded patients registered to general
practices with fewer than 1000 patients or fewer
than 50 responses to the General Practice Patient
Survey (2% of practices);1,29,30 this omitted practices
serving atypical populations or those with unreliable
practice level scores for the outcomes.
We linearly rescaled each outcome measure to a 0–
100 scale to help compare scores across measures
(online supplementary material – Appendix 2).31 We
first estimated the associations between patient experi-
ence (measured at the patient level) and the contract
type of general practices using linear mixed-effects
regression models that included random practice-
level intercepts and adjusted (at the patient level) for
the six patient characteristics given above. We then
extended these models to include the population size,
age–gender, ethnicity and deprivation profiles of each
general practice as covariates. These characteristics
vary across practices with different contract types1
and are associated with patient experience independ-
ent of the corresponding patient characteristics.32
These models are therefore better adjusted for con-
founding variables and we present them in the subse-
quent main text; the results unadjusted for population
characteristics are given in the online supplementary
material. We repeated this analysis to estimate the
association between patient experience and practice
ownership by a large organisation.
We present the mean differences in each outcome
measure between practices with General contracts
(the reference category) and practices in other cate-
gories. We also provide standardised mean differ-
ences, calculated by dividing the mean difference by
the standard deviation between general practices
derived from the multilevel regression models, to
indicate the strength of associations. Results for prac-
tices with Primary Care Trust contracts are presented
in the online supplementary material, since these
trusts (responsible for commissioning primary care
and other services) were abolished in March 2013
and this contract type is no longer recorded.33 We
also restrict detailed results for practices recorded as
limited companies with General or Personal contracts
in the contract data to the online supplementary
material, as there were only 18 of these practices.
In a sensitivity analysis, we used propensity-score
matching to compare outcome measures between prac-
tices identified as Alternative Provider limited compa-
nies and those with General contracts. We used logistic
regression to estimate the propensity score based on
the patient and practice characteristics given above.
Each respondent whose practice was an Alternative
Provider limited company was then compared to 100
other respondents with similar propensity scores
whose practices had General contracts (nearest neigh-
bours matching with replacement).20,34 We excluded
respondents without a suitable match (due to non-
overlapping propensity scores). We used standardised
mean differences in patient and practice characteristics
to assess the quality of matching between the two types
of practices. This sensitivity analysis was then repeated
comparing practices owned by a large organisation to
practices with General contracts. All analyses were
conducted using Stata MP v.13 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA).
Results
The analysis included 903,357 survey respondents
(Table 1). Most patients described a positive overall
442
Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 110(11)
 experience of their general practice: 38.7% (342,015/
882,690) of responses indicated ‘fairly good’ and
49.6% (437 868/882 690) indicated ‘very good’
(Table 2). This was consistent with generally positive
reports of being able to consult a preferred doctor,
the convenience of appointments, the communication
skills of doctors and being able to contact someone at
the general practice easily by telephone (Table 2).
Younger respondents reported worse experiences of
their general practice across all measures, as did
respondents with less confidence in managing their
health and those who were unable to take time off
from
work
to
visit
their
practice
(Table
3).
Associations between patient experience and ethnicity
were somewhat inconsistent, while male patients
reported slightly
better
experiences
than female
patients on average.
Most practices had a General (54.6%; 4337/7949)
or Personal (40.1%; 3187/7949) contract and were
not recorded as being limited companies according
to their contracts (Table 4). Only 1.5% of practices
(116/7949) had a limited company status in these
data, the majority of whom had an Alternative
Provider contract (84.5%; 98/116). Large organisa-
tions owned 176 practices (in some form) mostly
with
Alternative
Provider
(51.5%;
88/171)
or
Personal (32.2%; 55/171) contracts.
Practices with Alternative Provider contracts, both
limited
and
non-limited
forms,
had

and more deprived categories than other practices
(online supplementary material – Appendix 3). This
reflected differences in the registered populations of

practices had the largest mean population (online

using

data,
patients reported worse adjusted experiences in prac-

experience was 3.04 (95% confidence interval 1.94–
4.15) lower in these practices than in those with
General contracts. Similar associations existed for
three of the other four experience measures. The lar-
gest mean difference was observed for the frequency
of consulting a preferred doctor; compared to prac-
tices with General contracts, the adjusted mean score
was

(10.39–15.17)

 this measure. There was no evidence that patients
found it less or more easy to contact Alternative
Provider limited practices by telephone (mean differ-
ence �0.22, �2.50 to 2.07, p ¼ 0.85).
Where Alternative Provider limited practices did
score lower, the standardised mean differences were
�0.63, �1.27, �0.53 and �0.74 for overall experi-
ence, consulting a preferred doctor, getting a conveni-
ent appointment and doctor communication skills,
respectively
(Table
5).
This
indicates
moderate
(appointment
convenience)
to
large
(preferred
doctor) effect sizes of being an Alternative Provider
limited practice.
Differences between practices with Personal con-
tracts and those with General contracts were small
(modulus of standardised mean differences �0.21)
and
inconsistent
in
direction
across
measures
(Table 5). Practices recorded as limited companies
with Personal contracts performed worse on four of
five measures; however, with similar standardised
mean differences as for Alternative Provider limited
practices (online supplementary material – Appendix
3). Alternative Provider practices not identified as
limited companies in the contract data were easier
to contact by telephone than practices with General
contracts
(standardised
mean
difference
0.37;
Table 5). Patient experience in Primary Care Trust
practices did not differ consistently across measures
to that in practices with General contracts (online
supplementary material – Appendix 5).
In the analysis of practices owned by large organ-
isations, these practices had lower adjusted experi-
ence scores than practices with General contracts
for four of the five measures studied (all p < 0.001;
Table 6). The largest standardised mean difference,
�1.22, was again observed for consulting a preferred
doctor, indicating a large effect size of ownership by a
large organisation. More moderate effect sizes were
observed for overall experience (�0.57), doctor com-
munication (�0.69) and appointment convenience
(�0.36). These standardised mean differences are
similar in magnitude to those for practices recorded
as Alternative Provider limited companies in the con-
tract data.
The results in both analyses were similar to those
given above when characteristics of each general
practice’s population were not adjusted for (online
supplementary material – Appendix 6). In the sensi-
tivity analysis using propensity-score matching, the
estimated associations were similar in direction and
magnitude to the results from regression modelling
(online supplementary material – Appendix 7).
Discussion
Patients registered to general practices owned by lim-
ited companies reported worse experiences of their care
than patients registered to other practices on average.
This applied to practices recorded as limited compa-
nies in routine contract data and to practices owned by

 large organisations. The sizes of the differences in
experience varied from moderate to large across four
outcome measures and were largest for the frequency
of consulting a preferred doctor. Limited company
ownership of general practices is uncommon in
England. Patient experience was not consistently asso-
ciated with the contract type for practices not recorded
as limited companies. Across all contract and owner-
ship types, patients generally reported positive experi-
ences of their general practices.
Relation to existing literature
A national ecological analysis of general practices in
England found that Alternative Provider practices
performed worse across 15 of 17 outcome measures
studied from 2008–2009 to 2012–2013.1 Most of these
practices (53%; 185/347) were newly established, but
the practices that changed to an Alternative Provider
contract did not appear to worsen care on average.1
A relative strength of the analysis presented here is
that we adjusted for patient level variables that con-
found the relationship between contract type and
patient
experience.
Our
results
suggest
that
Alternative Provider practices consistently provided
a worse experience for patients only when owned by
limited companies. This contrasts with the previous
analysis which observed the association for all
Alternative
Provider
practices.1
We
additionally
found that practices owned by large organisations
(�20 practices) provided worse experiences on aver-
age than practices with a General contract which are
typically
small
general
practitioner
partnerships.
Therefore, our findings highlight limited companies
as providing worse experiences of primary care,
rather than practices with the Alternative Provider
contract collectively.
Commercial providers of out-of-hours primary
care in England provided a worse experience of care
across three outcome measures than National Health
Service or not-for-profit providers in 2012–2013;13
the effect sizes were large for two outcomes (overall
experience, confidence and trust in the out-of-hours
clinician) and moderate for the other (timeliness of
care). This analysis used a similar design – multilevel
analysis of the General Practice Patient Survey – to
that reported here. Analysis of the 2007–2008 version
of the survey found no substantial differences in
patient experience between General and Personal
practices,32 which is consistent with our results.
The results are also consistent with several articles
that report associations between survey respondent
characteristics and reported experiences.13,16,31,32,35

 practitioner, reported substantially worse experiences

Strengths and limitations
The General Practice Patient Survey is a large nation-
ally representative survey providing sufficient numbers
of responses per practice to create reliable practice-
level measures.15 We examined policy-relevant meas-
ures of patient experience such as the convenience
of appointments17 and overall experience which is
monitored in the National Health Service Outcomes
Framework.9 We used the multilevel data structure to
estimate associations while adjusting for key charac-
teristics
of
survey
respondents
and
practice
populations.
Given the observational cross-sectional design of
the analysis, residual confounding may account for
some or all of the differences observed between own-
ership types. We did not determine whether changes
in practice contract type and ownership over time are
associated with changes in patient experience. This
was because relatively few practices change contract
type each year and there is much random variation in
changes in the patient experience measures within
practices between years. An alternative explanation
for the results is that limited companies may often
take over practices that already provide a poor
experience of care; it may then be difficult to improve
patient experience to the average levels of other prac-
tices. However, we may also expect this of Primary
Care Trust practices or Alternative Provider practices
not owned by limited companies, and these practices
provided similar patient experiences to practices with
General contracts. Moreover, past poor performance
may not be a reasonable justification of current poor
performance. Of the 98 Alternative Provider limited
companies in 2013, 71 had the same contract and
ownership status in 2012, 65 in 2011 and 59 in 2010.
Patient reports of experience may be affected by
perception of the organisation providing care in add-
ition to the service itself. This depends on patients
being aware of the ownership of their general practice
which may be atypical. In addition, it is patient per-
ception of experience, regardless of the organisational
characteristics that might affect it, that is ultimately
important. Patients may recall previous experiences
of their general practice inaccurately. This error
would have to be systematically associated with the
organisation type independent of measured patient
characteristics to bias the observed associations, how-
ever, which we feel is unlikely. This is also necessary
for other sources of response bias. The survey
response rate of 34.3% could have biased outcome
measures at the practice level, although previous
work suggests only a weak inconsistent association
between the response rate and two measures of
access (partial correlation coefficients of 0.04 and
�0.07).36 Response rates for Alternative Provider
limited companies and other Alternative Provider
practices were similar (1% difference), so response
rates
cannot
explain
differences
in
associations
between these two groups at least.
Most practices owned by large organisations were
not recorded as limited companies in the contract data,
probably because of complex ownership and legal
structures. This supports reclassifying practices using
data sources other than those made routinely available
when examining practice ownership. However, it may
be difficult to identify a representative sample of prac-
tices owned by smaller limited companies from
Internet
searching.
We
therefore
restricted
our
second analysis to large provider organisations.
Implications for research and policy
Researchers could pursue the explanation for patients
reporting worse experiences of care in general prac-
tices owned by limited companies. Traditional prac-
tices, in which the owners (GP Principals) also provide
clinical services, may be more responsive to patient
need than practices with more corporate ownership
structures. Future research could examine differences
in practice staffing and other organisational character-
istics that might explain our findings, in addition to
using other quality indicators as outcome measures.
The performance of corporate providers in other parts
of the National Health Service, such as elective sur-
gery, may be worth investigating. Similar research is
warranted internationally given the increased role of
these providers in several countries.6,7
Limited company ownership of general practices
remains uncommon in England. Although our results
suggest that limited companies provide worse patient
experiences on average, some practices owned by
these companies provide a good experience; others
provide the opposite. It is the responsibility of com-
missioners, regulators, clinicians and owners to guar-
antee
that
individual
practices
meet
expected
standards while ensuring that care quality is not sys-
tematically
associated
with
the
ownership.
Commissioners also need to ensure that contracts
offer good value for money, more so at a time when
the
National
Health
Service
is
very
financially
challenged.37
