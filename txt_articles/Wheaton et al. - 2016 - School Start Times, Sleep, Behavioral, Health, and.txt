Abstract
BACKGROUND—Insufficient sleep in adolescents has been shown to be associated with a wide 
variety of adverse outcomes, from poor mental and physical health to behavioral problems and 
lower academic grades. However, most high school students do not get sufficient sleep. Delaying 
school start times for adolescents has been proposed as a policy change to address insufficient 
sleep in this population and potentially to improve students’ academic performance, reduce 
engagement in risk behaviors, and improve health.
METHODS—This paper reviews 38 reports examining the association between school start times, 
sleep, and other outcomes among adolescent students.
RESULTS—Most studies reviewed provide evidence that delaying school start time increases 
weeknight sleep duration among adolescents, primarily by delaying rise times. Most of the studies 
saw a significant increase in sleep duration even with relatively small delays in start times of half 
an hour or so. Later start times also generally correspond to improved attendance, less tardiness, 
less falling asleep in class, better grades, and fewer motor vehicle crashes.
CONCLUSIONS—Although additional research is necessary, research results that are already 
available should be disseminated to stakeholders to enable the development of evidence-based 
school policies.

BACKGROUND
Sleepy adolescents have doubtlessly been a problem for a long time. However, it is only 
since the late 1980s that this issue has progressed from teachers’ anecdotes of students 
falling asleep in class and parental complaints of daily struggles to get their children out of 
bed to scientific investigations into the causes and consequences of insufficient sleep.
Most adolescents may need at least 9 hours sleep per night1–3; however, fewer than 8% of 
high school students report getting this amount.4 Less than a third of students report 8 or 
more hours of sleep, and this proportion decreases as school grade level increases so that 
fewer than a quarter of high school seniors get this amount.4 Healthy People 2020, a national 
initiative designed to guide disease prevention and health promotion efforts to improve the 
health of all Americans (http://www.healthypeople.gov/), contains 4 objectives related to 
sleep, including one for adolescents.5 This objective is to “increase the proportion of 
students in grades 9 through 12 who get sufficient sleep (defined as 8 or more hours of sleep 
on an average school night).”
Insufficient sleep in children and adolescents has been shown to be associated with a wide 
variety of adverse outcomes in multiple aspects of their lives from poor mental and physical 
health to behavioral problems and poor academic grades. Insufficient sleep has been linked 
to excess weight,6–13 decreased physical activity,14 and increased food intake, possibly due 
to alterations in appetite-regulating hormones.12 Results of investigations into longitudinal 
changes in weight attributable to sleep duration, however, have been mixed.10,15
A solid body of literature has found that insufficient sleep in this young population is tied to 
poor mental health, including depression, depressive symptoms,8,16–22 and suicidal 
ideation.8,18,20,22–25 In addition, a few studies have shown an association between 
insufficient sleep and unhealthy risk behaviors including alcohol use,17,19,20,22 tobacco 
smoking,20,22 marijuana use,20,22 use of other illicit/prescription drugs,22 unhealthy weight 
control strategies,26 and recent sexual activity.20 Other factors that have been found to be 
associated with insufficient sleep include risk-taking behaviors,27 bullying,28 school 
violence-related behaviors,29 and physical fighting.20 Short sleep duration has also been 
found to be associated with a higher risk of unintentional injury.30 Finally, students who do 
not get enough sleep also may be more likely to have problems paying attention and poor 
academic performance,17,21,31–36 although not all research agrees.37,38 One of these negative 
studies failed to find a correlation between school night sleep duration and grade point 
average.37 However, class grading and subsequently grade point averages are not 
standardized and may vary by subject, teacher, and school. That study also did not adjust by 
sex of student, which was a strong predictor of grade point average. Ming et al. found that 
“students with a sleep length of less than 7 hours on both weekdays and weekends exhibited 
poorer performance, while those who made up this sleep loss on weekends did not.”38 That 
study also relied on a non-standardized measure of academic performance and did not adjust

 for variables such as grade in school, which is strongly related to prevalence of insufficient 
sleep.
Adolescents tend to get insufficient sleep because of a combination of late bedtimes and 
early rise times. External factors that contribute to later bedtimes among adolescents include 
an increase in schoolwork; participation in afterschool activities, including employment; 
fewer parent-set bedtimes; and late-night use of technology in the bedroom.39–43 Biology 
also plays a part in later bedtimes among adolescents. One of the early changes associated 
with puberty is alteration of a child’s circadian rhythms, such that adolescents are more alert 
in the afternoons and evenings and require morning sleep.44 Their natural body clocks can 
keep adolescents awake until 11 PM or later, in spite of going to bed earlier and good sleep 
hygiene, such as avoiding stimulating activity at night and minimizing caffeine intake in the 
afternoon or evening.39 School-based sleep promotion programs have been tried as a means 
of improving sleep hygiene among adolescents. However, these programs may improve 
knowledge of sleep without having a significant effect on behavior.45,46
Rise times, on the other hand, are primarily determined by a single factor—school start 
times.43 Delaying school start times for adolescents has been proposed as a policy change to 
address insufficient sleep in this population and potentially to improve students’ academic 
performance, reduce engagement in risk behaviors, and improve health. In 2014, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics published a policy statement urging middle and high 
schools to adjust start times to permit students to obtain adequate sleep and improve physical 
and mental health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life.3 This paper reviews 
studies examining the association between school start times, sleep, and other outcomes 
including academic performance, mental health, and motor vehicle collisions among 
adolescent students. This paper, and especially the table provided, is intended to be a 
resource for educators, parents, and other stakeholders who wish to learn more about the 
impact of changing school start times for adolescents.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Methods
An outline of the steps in identification of articles and reports included in the literature 
review is presented in the Figure. To be included in the review, analyses had to include the 
variable of “school start time” either by comparing different schools with different start 
times (cross-sectional) or the same schools before and after changes in start times 
(longitudinal). Since the focus of this review is on the effect of school start times on 
adolescent students, studies that focused on elementary school (pre-middle school) students 
were excluded. Additionally, reports had to be available in English, but could include 
schools either in or outside the United States. Articles for the literature review were initially 
identified through a PubMed search for “school start time” OR “school start times” (Step A). 
Some exclusions from this initial search included a study that compared students in public or 
private schools to homeschooled students,47 a comparison of adolescent sleep during 
summer and during the school year,48 and one that modeled the effect of modifying school 
start times on the frequency of encounters between child pedestrians and motor vehicles.49 
Another broader PubMed search for “sleep” AND “adolescent” AND “school” resulted in

 approximately 3200 articles (Step B). Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify studies 
that might meet primary inclusion criteria. Full-text review of candidate articles confirmed 
inclusion of articles for this review. Reference lists of articles identified in Steps A and B 
and reviews of the topic of school start times were reviewed for identification of additional 
reports (Step C). Several of the earliest studies with results presented in abstract form only 
were identified in this manner,50–54 as were some studies from the education or economics 
literature that were not indexed by PubMed.55–59 A Scopus search for “school start time” 
(all fields) found 320 documents (Step D), of which 3 satisfied the inclusion criteria and had 
not been identified in previous steps. Finally (Step E), one additional non-duplicative report 
was identified in the reference list for articles in Step D. Final searches in Steps A, B, and D 
were conducted July 1, 2015. For this review, 38 reports were reviewed for years of study, 
study design, sample size, students’ ages, location, school start times, outcomes, and key 
reported findings. Five of these reports are listed more than once in the table. Three reports 
included multiple study populations whose data are analyzed separately.59–61 Three reports 
included cross-sectional and longitudinal components, with data for each component 
presented separately.55,57,61
The primary limitation to this review is its reliance on indexing by PubMed and Scopus, 
which could lead to omission of reports not indexed by these databases. To address this 
limitation, we also examined the reference lists on previous articles on the topic of school 
start times (Steps C and E). Five of the 38 reports were identified in this manner. Publication 
bias and over-representation of studies with significant results is also possible, however, 
some studies included in this review had results that did not agree with the majority.
Types of School Start Time Studies
We reviewed 38 reports on the impact of changes in school start time (see Table). 
Unfortunately, the earliest reports,50–54 which have been cited frequently, were only 
published in abstract form. However, since they seem to have provided the impetus for much 
of the subsequent research and are fairly detailed, we have included them in this review. The 
studies presented in this review can be categorized as either cross-sectional or longitudinal. 
The cross-sectional studies simply compared characteristics for students at two or more 
schools having different start times, such that School A had an earlier start time than School 
B and compared how students at the two schools with respect to such outcomes as sleep 
duration, school attendance, academic performance, and morning traffic accidents among 
teens.
Changing school start times is often a major endeavor that involves coordination between 
school faculty and staff, transportation resources, parents, students, and administration, and 
can take years to accomplish. Cross-sectional studies can be conducted without having to 
wait for a school or school district to undertake a change in school start time. However, as 
with all cross- sectional studies, only associations between school start times and other 
variables can be shown—not cause and effect. Other school characteristics, such as 
socioeconomic status of students, can also have effects on sleep and other outcomes but is 
often not reported.

 In the longitudinal studies, data are collected on students and schools before and after a 
change in start time. Some data that are regularly collected by schools, such as attendance 
and grades, can be obtained retroactively by researchers. Other data, such as those obtained 
from student sleep surveys, need to be collected before the start time change is implemented, 
and including these data can increase the duration of the study. Some studies evaluate 
characteristics of the same students before and after the change. Others evaluate the student 
population (either the entire school or specific grades in school) before and after the change. 
This second method, for instance, could compare outcomes in 9th-grade students in the year 
before the start time change with the same outcomes in 9th-grade students in the year after 
the change. Both of these methods have their drawbacks. Although it would seem to be 
preferable to evaluate the same students before and after a change, individual students can 
undergo significant changes from year to year that could exaggerate or diminish the effect of 
changing start times. However, by being able to evaluate changes in variables for individual 
students, researchers are able to address questions such as, “Did the students who got more 
sleep after the start time’s change have improved outcomes?” Although longitudinal studies 
may provide stronger evidence of causation than cross-sectional studies by addressing the 
issue of temporality, it is important to assess whether appropriate control conditions are 
used, whether analyses account for covariates (eg, age, sex, or socioeconomic status), and 
whether other explanatory variables are considered (eg, implementation of graduated drivers 
licensing).
Sleep and Sleepiness
Since delaying school start times is primarily intended to address the problem of insufficient 
sleep among adolescents, most of the studies focused on the association between school start 
times and sleep variables. Not surprisingly, students at schools with later start times got out 
of bed later on school days than those at earlier starting schools.35,36,50,53,55,56,60,62–69 The 
association between school start times and bedtimes, however, was mixed. Of 19 studies that 
evaluated the association between school start times and bedtime, there were no start time-
associated differences in weekday bedtimes in eleven studies.35,50,53–55,60,62,67,68,70 
However, six studies observed a later bedtime among students in schools that started at later 
times.34,36,56,64,66,71 It should be noted that in the study by Wolfson and colleagues, this 
bedtime difference was observed only in the autumn.64 Two studies unexpectedly reported 
earlier bedtimes after a delay in start times.65,69 In the study by Owens et al., some students 
stated that after seeing the benefits of getting more sleep with the delay in school start times, 
they sought to further increase their sleep by going to bed earlier.65 In Paksarian et al, 
bedtimes were delayed by only 10 minutes for each 30 minute delay in school start times.71 
In 29 reports, a later start time was found to be associated with longer weekday sleep 
duration,34,36,38,51–56,60–79 including the studies that noted later bedtimes.34,36,56,64,66,71 In 
contrast to the majority of studies that observed longer sleep duration in later starting 
schools, two studies comparing students from schools with different start times did not 
observe a significant difference in sleep duration.35,50 For one of these, the difference in 
sleep duration did not meet the authors’ effect size criterion, although the difference would 
not have been expected to be large since the difference in school start times was only 20 
minutes.35 The other study observed longer sleep duration for students at the later starting 
school, but the difference was not statistically significant.50 Another study observed a

 significantly longer sleep duration for 7th- and 8th-grade students of only one of two later-
starting districts.60 Sleep duration for the second later-starting district was also longer than 
for the early-starting district, but the difference was not statistically significant.60 Paksarian 
et al. observed longer sleep durations with later school start times (11 minutes for each 30 
minute delay in school start times), but only for schools that started before 8:01 AM.71 In 
further analysis, the authors found the longer sleep duration for boys only (20 minutes for 
each 30 minute delay in school start times) and that there was variation by urbanicity, with 
an increase in sleep duration for boys in major metropolitan areas and a decrease for boys in 
nonurban counties.71 The authors suggested that the different association according to 
urbanicity may be due to differences in mode of transportation to school and time spent 
traveling to school, but they did not have data to investigate the possible role of 
transportation in their study. Although nearly all the studies reviewed used self-reported 
sleep data either from sleep diaries or survey questions, the two studies that used data from 
electronic wrist monitors (actigraphs) worn during sleep confirmed the general finding of 
longer weeknight sleep duration for students with later start times.62,70 Eleven of the 
positive studies found that students got at least one additional minute of sleep for every two 
minutes of difference in start time (eg, at least 30 minutes more sleep when start time was 
one hour later),34,55,56,60,61,64,65,68,70,72,78 although six other studies observed smaller, yet 
statistically significant, differences.51,52,62,63,73,74
In addition to reporting longer sleep durations, students with later start times were less likely 
to report daytime sleepiness or falling asleep in class in nearly all studies that assessed these 
outcomes.34,36,55,56,60,64,65,69,72,74 Two studies observed no difference in sleepiness based 
on school start times. In the Norwegian study,78 start times were delayed from 8:30 AM to 
9:30 AM on Mondays only. The lack of association could have been due to either the change 
being in effect only one day a week or the earlier start time already being late enough. In the 
Croatian study,80 the students at the earlier starting schools were predominantly boys, while 
girls made up most of the population at the later starting schools. That study found that girls 
had later chronotype (evening preference) and more sleepiness. In addition, the schools in 
the Croatian study alternated their schedule weekly, with schools starting in the morning one 
week and in the afternoon the next. Even with a delay in start time, falling asleep during 
class appears to remain a major problem, however. In Wahlstrom and colleagues’ survey of 
students post-start time change, 27% reported falling asleep in a morning class in the 
previous 2 weeks, and 29% fell asleep in an afternoon class.61
Other methods for assessing students’ degree of sleep-deficiency were used in various 
studies. Students in a study by Carskadon and colleagues underwent polysomnography (a 
type of sleep study that measures multiple factors such as electrical activity in the brain, 
heart rate, movements of the eyelids and legs, and respiratory airflow) and multiple sleep 
latency tests.62 After an advance in start time from 8:25 AM to 7:20 AM, students had a 
shorter REM sleep latency (time between sleep onset and onset of REM sleep) on 
polysomnography and a shorter sleep latency (time to sleep onset during a standard testing 
protocol).62 Both of these results indicate sleep-deficiency. Differences in sleep patterns 
between weeknights and weekend nights can also indicate insufficient weeknight sleep as 
students try to make up for lost sleep on the weekends. Seven reports that evaluated weekend 
sleep patterns found more “catch-up” sleep on the weekends for earlier start

 times,51,61,64,66,69,74,78 although one found no difference in this outcome.71 One study 
assessed weeknight and weekend sleep and observed longer weeknight sleep duration and no 
change in weekend sleep patterns after a delay in school start time, which could be 
interpreted as a decrease in “catch-up” sleep.67 However, the difference between weeknight 
and weekend sleep was not analyzed. Three studies that included information about daytime 
naps noted that students with earlier school start times reported more napping,38,66,75 
presumably in an attempt to make up for insufficient nighttime sleep. Sleepy adolescents 
may also attempt to lessen sleepiness with caffeine. One study asked students about caffeine 
consumption and observed that caffeine use decreased after a 25 minute delay in school start 
time.67
Academics and Cognition
An outcome of particular interest to school administrators, teachers, and parents is academic 
performance; however, evaluating how delayed start times affect school grades or academic 
performance is difficult for several reasons. Class grading is not standardized and varies by 
subject, teacher, and school. Standardized tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the 
ACT are not taken by all students and are more likely to be taken by students planning to 
attend college. Finally, students with very good academic performance before a delay in 
school start time do not have much room for improvement. Given these limitations, however, 
some evidence suggests a positive association between later school start time and academic 
performance,57,58,60,61,64,81 although the association may be relatively weak55 and not 
universal.59,67,80
The first cross-sectional school start time study by the University of Minnesota found higher 
self-reported grades for students in later starting schools.60 Mean self-reported grades for the 
two districts that started before 7:30 AM were 6.4 and 6.5 (on a scale from 1 = mostly F’s to 
9 = mostly A’s) compared to 7.1 for the district starting at 8:30 AM (p < .05). However, the 
increase in grades observed from this group’s subsequent longitudinal study was small and 
not statistically significant.55 In their latest longitudinal study including 8 schools, the same 
group noted that most schools saw an increase in grade point average after delaying school 
start times.61 Arlington Public Schools (Arlington County, Virginia) observed an 
improvement in 10th grade students’ 1st period grades after a 45 minute delay in high school 
start times, with no change in 7th grade students’ 1st period grades after a 20 minute advance 
in middle school start times.81 Hinrichs’ investigation into ACT scores and school start times 
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which included school districts that did not delay school 
start times, controlled for various covariates and found no association between school start 
times and ACT scores.59 The annual ACT participation rate among Minnesota high school 
graduates varied from 59% to 66% during the study period (1993–2002).59 Hinrichs also 
evaluated the association between school start times and standardized test scores in Kansas 
(Kansas State Assessments) and the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC.59 Again, he found 
no association between school start times and academic achievement in these analyses.59 
Wolfson and colleagues observed higher grades after delaying school start times for 8th 
grade, although not for 7th-grade students.64 Another study linked school start times and 
standardized test scores for middle school students (grades 6–8) from 1999 to 2006 in the 
eighteenth largest public school district in the United States.57 In the cross-sectional

 component of that study, an hour later start time corresponded to higher test scores on both 
math and reading (on the order of 3 percentile points).57 The longitudinal component of the 
same report looked at schools that had changed school start times over the course of the 
study and found that a one hour delay in start time corresponded to a 2 percentile increase in 
math and 1.5 percentile increase in reading.57 Among older students, U.S. Air Force 
Academy freshmen, students assigned to a first period course and therefore an earlier start to 
the school day had poorer grades.58 A longitudinal study of nearly 200 boarding school 
students did not see a change in self-reported grades after a 25 minute delay in school start 
times.67 In Milic et al.’s study in Croatia, students with an earlier school start time 
performed better academically than students at the schools with later start times.80 However, 
in addition to the difference in the make-up of the student populations (more boys at earlier 
schools and more girls at later schools) in that study, students were also aware of the school 
schedule at enrollment and the response rate was low.
Several studies have investigated the association between school start time and cognitive 
outcomes. Two studies found that students with later start times reported fewer problems 
concentrating and paying attention.70,72 In contrast, a study in Spain measured attention 
level via a sustained attention task among students at three schools with different start times 
(8:00, 8:15, and 8:30) and observed the highest average attention level at the school starting 
at 8:15.77 However, it should be noted that the mean inductive reasoning score, a measure of 
intelligence which is positively associated with attention, was significantly lower for the 
latest-starting school than the other two schools.77 The Norwegian study that delayed start 
times on Mondays included reaction time tests and found that students at the school with 
delayed start time had significantly fewer lapses and faster reaction times on Monday than 
Friday compared to no difference among students at the control (no delay) school.78
Several studies asked students how much time they spent on homework. There was no 
consistent association between school start time and homework time. Wahlstrom and 
colleagues found that students with later school start times reported less hours of 
homework,60 whereas Edwards observed the reverse57 and Boergers and colleagues saw no 
difference.67 Interpretation of these results in difficult. An increase in time doing homework 
could indicate an improved ability to concentrate or less efficient studying. Since the value 
of homework is hotly debated, this outcome should not be taken out of context.
Attendance/Tardiness
School attendance is also important for academic success. A recent report found that short 
sleep duration was strongly associated with odds of school absences.82 Several studies 
included in this review found that earlier start times were also related to more frequent 
tardiness and more absences.55,57,60,61,64,65 In one study, even with delaying start times from 
8:00 AM to 8:55 AM, nearly a third of students reported being late to class because of 
oversleeping in the 2 weeks before the survey.61 However, one study of schools in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area found no association between school start times and overall 
attendance rates.59 The report by Arlington Public Schools stated that “maturity, rather than 
starting time, has the biggest impact on attendance rates.”81 However, when comparing 10th 
graders before and after the delay in high school start times, attendance rates were lower

 after the delay. Despite this finding, academic performance improved for those students. The 
report also noted that the attendance reporting procedures changed during the course of the 
study.
Depression
Sleep is strongly linked with many psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety.83 
Although sleep problems may be symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression, 
there is also evidence of a causal relationship between insufficient sleep and depression, as 
well as mood in general.84,85 Due to this observation, some school start time studies 
included depression symptoms as part of their student assessments. Students at later-starting 
schools appeared to experience fewer depression symptoms (lower depression 
scores).55,60,65,67 Incidentally, shorter REM sleep latency, such as was observed by 
Carskadon and colleagues after an advance in start time,62 is also often observed in major 
depression.86 One study found no difference in students’ positive or negative affect with 
delayed school start time.78 However, in that study, the start time was delayed on Mondays 
only.
Motor Vehicle Crashes
Four studies also investigated motor vehicle crashes among young drivers (aged 18 years or 
younger) in areas served by schools with different start times. In a Kentucky county, Danner 
and Phillips saw a 16.5% decrease (p < .01) in motor vehicle crash rates for 17- and 18-year-
old students in the 2 years following a 1-hour delay in school start time by county high 
schools.74 During the same time period, crash rates for this age group increased by 7.8% in 
the rest of the state.74 In their 2011 report, Vorona and colleagues compared crash rates for 
teen drivers aged 16 to 18 years in 2 neighboring, demographically similar cities (in eastern 
Virginia) with different start times. In 2007 and 2008, the teen crash rates were significantly 
higher in the city with an earlier school start time.87 For both cities, teen crashes peaked 
during the morning commute time.87 The group went on to perform similar analyses for two 
adjacent counties in central Virginia with different school start times.88 During the 2009–
2010 school year, crash rates among 16–18 year olds were higher (p < .05) in the county 
with the earlier school start times.88 The following year, crash rates among 16–17 year olds 
were higher (p < .05) in the same county, but difference was not statistically significant 
when 18 year olds were included in comparison (p = 0.09).88 Finally, Wahlstrom and 
colleagues investigated crash rates among 16- to 18-year-old students in 4 areas near schools 
that underwent delays in start time. Two areas saw major decreases (≥65%) in teen crash 
rates after the delays, while one saw a small decrease (6%), and another saw a small increase 
(9%).61
Other Outcomes
There are a handful of other outcomes that have been reported by only one study each. One 
study saw that students at schools with later start times spent less time at work during the 
school week (p < .05).60 More time working has been linked to poorer academic 
performance.89 However, the start time study was cross-sectional and other variables such as 
socioeconomic status may explain the difference in time spent at work. In the cross-sectional 
component of his study, Edwards found that students at schools that started later reported

 less time watching television.57 When he limited his analyses to schools that changed start 
times over the time course of the study, he confirmed that students at schools that delayed 
their start times reported significantly less time watching television.57 Among 197 boarding 
school students, no change in time spent in athletics or extracurricular activities was reported 
after a 25 minute delay in start time.67 Finally, in a small study of 15 students who 
transitioned from grade 9 (school start time 8:25) to grade 10 (school start time 7:20), self-
reported conduct problems and aggressive behaviors decreased with the change to an earlier 
start time.54 However, within each grade, these behaviors were associated with shorter sleep 
duration, which indicates that at least some of the decrease in these behaviors may be due to 
maturation.54
CONCLUSION
Delaying school start times for adolescents has been proposed as a policy change to address 
insufficient sleep among adolescents, a largely sleep-deprived population, and potentially to 
improve students’ academic performance, reduce engagement in risk behaviors, and improve 
health. Nearly all studies to date provide evidence that delaying school start time 
accomplishes the goal of increasing sleep duration among these students, primarily by 
delaying rise times. Most of the studies saw a significant increase in sleep duration even with 
relatively small delays in start times of half an hour or so. Later school start times also 
generally corresponded to improved attendance, less tardiness, less falling asleep in class, 
fewer depression symptoms, and fewer motor vehicle crashes. Although not all studies 
found that later start times corresponded to improved academic performance, no studies 
found a negative impact of later school start times on academics.
IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH
In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a policy statement urging middle 
and high schools to adjust start times to permit students to obtain adequate sleep and 
improve physical and mental health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life, and 
suggested that middle and high schools not start before 8:30 AM.3 Schools and school 
districts cannot make evidence-based policy decision without data. Therefore, research 
results such as those presented in this review, as well as the recent recommendations by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, should be disseminated to school districts, teachers, 
parents, and other stakeholders. The field still needs rigorous research, including trials with 
controls, if possible. Many questions remain, such as the issue of how late is late enough? 
Much of the focus has been on high school students, but biological changes begin earlier, so 
further research into middle-school students is warranted. More qualitative research about 
overcoming obstacles to delaying school start times would also be valuable.
Schools contemplating a change in school start time may consider partnering with 
researchers before a decision is even made. Baseline data on student sleep characteristics, 
tardiness due to sleepiness, and prevalence of falling asleep during class may be used in the 
initial decision of whether to delay school start times. Parents and administrators may not 
realize the extent of the problem of insufficient sleep among their students and this data may 
help persuade them that some action is necessary. If school start times are delayed, everyone

 would benefit from collection of detailed data before and after a time change. Not only 
would other schools or school districts contemplating a change benefit from expanded 
evidence, the district that undertook the start time change would be able to evaluate the 
impact of the change and communicate their findings to their stakeholders. Data collected 
should include not only sleep-related variables and academic achievement measures, but also 
measures of mental health (such as depression and anxiety symptoms), behavioral problems, 
risk behaviors, safety statistics such as motor vehicle crash rates and pedestrian injuries, and 
information on mode of transportation and travel time. Several obstacles to implementing 
start time delays are often cited, including costs of changing bus schedules, possible impact 
on athletics and extracurricular activities, and school faculty and staff resistant to change. 
However, as recently reported by Owens et al.90 in their examination of school districts that 
have delayed school start times, many anticipated problems fail to materialize or are only 
temporary. Several school districts have seen savings in transportation costs after changes 
made to facilitate delayed start times.90 Success stories describing how districts creatively 
overcame obstacles to school start time changes should be shared (for example http://
www.startschoollater.net/success-stories.html) to provide ideas to other districts 
contemplating change.

School Sleep Habits 
Survey35 (study,

school habits and
preferences), 8-day 
sleep diary
School night sleep duration 
correlated with SST (r
= .29, p < .001). SST had 
largest effect on sleep
duration (compared with 
parent-set bedtimes and
extra-curricular load).

School Sleep Habits 
Survey35 (study,

questionnaire
After SST delay, mean wake 
times (school days)
were later (p < .001), mean 
school night sleep
duration was longer (p < .
001), school night
bedtimes did not change. The 
percentage who slept
≥8 hour on school nights 
increased from 18% to
44% (p < .001). There were 
no changes in
nonschool night sleep 
patterns. After delay,
sleepiness scores (p < .001), 
depression scores (p <
.001), and caffeine use 
decreased (p < .05). No
changes in number of hours 
engaged in athletics,
extracurricular activities, and 
homework were
reported. No changes in self-
reported grades were
reported. Weekday sleep 
duration decreased to
baseline after reverting to 
pre-delay SST.

were higher (p < .05) in 
Chesterfield County
(which has earlier SST). In 
2010–2011, crash rates
among 16–17 year olds were 
higher (p < .05) in
Chesterfield County, but 
difference was not
statistically significant when 
18 year olds were

for the same time periods did 
not differ between the
two counties.
