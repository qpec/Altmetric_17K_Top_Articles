Abstract 
Introduction 
Late presentation is common in mesothelioma. Reliable assessment of past exposure to 
asbestos is a necessary first step for risk attribution and for the development of a future 
screening programme. Such a programme could maximise access to trials of novel therapies 
and would pave the way for development of novel chemoprophylaxis strategies.  This paper 
describes a method for individual exposure reconstruction along with data from a validation 
study. 
 
Methods 
The exposure assessment method uses only descriptive information about the 
circumstances of the work that could be obtained from questioning the worker. The 
assessment is based on the tasks carried out and includes parameters for substance 
emission potential, activity emission potential, the effectiveness of any local control 
measures, passive emission, the fractional time the asbestos source is active and the 
efficiency of any respiratory protection worn.  
 
Results 
There was a good association between the estimated and measured exposure levels. 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the log-transformed measurements and 
  
3 
estimates from the model was 0.86, and 95% of the estimated individual values were within 
about a factor of ten of the associated measured value. The method described would be 
suitable for pre-selecting individuals at high risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma for 
screening using appropriate tools and/or enrolment in clinical trials of chemo-prophylaxis.  
 
Discussion 
This method is of potential clinical value in developing novel treatment approaches for 
mesothelioma.  Pilot studies to test this approach are urgently needed.    
 
Keywords: mesothelioma, screening, asbestos, exposure 
 Introduction 
Asbestos was widely used in many countries in Europe, North America and elsewhere during 
the 20th Century.  The peak usage in most of these countries occurred in the 1970s (Nishikawa 
et al., 2008).  Most of the asbestos used was chrysotile with a smaller but important 
proportion of amphibole asbestos. Today many countries have banned the use of asbestos, 
but in all countries where there was widespread historic use there are still substantial 
quantities of asbestos that remain in situ in both commercial, public and residential buildings. 
Therefore, the health risks from inadvertent exposure will continue for many decades to 
come.  
 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has reviewed the evidence for 
carcinogenicity of asbestos and has concluded that all types of asbestos can cause 
mesothelioma, lung, laryngeal and ovarian cancer, with more limited evidence for causation 
of cancers of the colorectum, pharynx and stomach (Straif et al., 2009). For mesothelioma 
  
4 
and lung cancer, the dominant asbestos-related malignancies, the scientific evidence shows 
that the risk of disease is related to the lifetime cumulative exposure. In mesothelioma, the 
risk differs considerably between asbestos types, with the greatest risk associated with prior 
exposure to amphiboles. For example, using the algorithm developed  by Hodgson and 
Darnton (2000) suggests there is about a 5% lifetime risk of mesothelioma for 5 
fibres/ml.years exposure to crocidolite for someone aged 20 years when first exposed, with 
the corresponding risks for chrysotile exposure being around 0.03%. 
 
There is a long latency for mesothelioma and for those countries that banned asbestos in the 
1970s there are indications that the peak incidence rate has either occurred or will soon occur 
(Tan et al., 2010). For example, in Great Britain the annual number of mesothelioma deaths 
has risen from around 500 in 1980 to 2549 in 2014. On the basis of mortality trends over time 
it is projected that the peak number of mesothelioma deaths will be around the current 
number for the rest of this decade before beginning to decline thereafter (HSE, 2014).  
Globally, exposure to asbestos continues without regulation in many countries in the 
developing world, including those with large populations such as India. This predicts large 
numbers of asbestos-related mesothelioma and lung cancer deaths in these nations, unless 
novel effective intervention strategies are defined in the near future.   
 
There are currently no curative therapies for mesothelioma and curative treatment is only 
possible in lung cancer detected at an early stage. The development of new therapies for both 
diseases is hampered by the frequency of late-stage acute presentation in patients with 
declining physical function due to their disease. For mesothelioma patients in England and 
Wales, the median survival time from diagnosis is 9.5 months, with around 12% surviving 3-
  
5 
years (Beckett et al., 2015). In recent series, up to 50% of mesothelioma cases were recorded 
as having presented as an acute emergency to hospital (Tsim et al., 2014; 2015). Efforts to 
detect mesothelioma at an earlier stage using radiological screening have so far been 
unsuccessful (Fasola et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2009). This may have been due to the lack of 
an effective means of selecting individuals with a sufficiently high risk of the disease to 
generate enough screen-positive cases and/or the use of insensitive screening tools, such as 
computed tomography in these studies (Hallifax et al., 2015; Tsim et al., 2017). Mesothelioma 
screening is not currently recommended because of the currently limited therapeutic options 
for the disease. However, recent years have seen much increased research in mesothelioma 
resulting in the development of a range of novel treatment approaches. Many of these, 
including trials of radical surgery (Pietro Bertoglio and Waller, 2016) and hemi-thoracic radical 
radiotherapy (Rimner et al., 2016) or combined multi-modality approaches, are only suitable 
for the fittest patients with the lowest possible volume of disease. Early detection is therefore 
an essential component in testing these approaches and ultimately improving outcome. With 
regard to lung cancer, Wolff et al., (2015) suggest that low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT) should be evaluated as a screening tool specifically for former asbestos workers or 
others at risk, primarily smokers. This is based on evidence from the US National Lung Cancer 
Screening Trial that has shown that LDCT screening can reduce both lung cancer and all-cause 
mortality amongst current and former smokers (Detterbeck et al., 2013). To ensure sufficient 
screen-positive cases, for either mesothelioma or asbestos-related lung cancer, an accurate 
method of quantifying cumulative asbestos exposure, and thereby calculating risk using a 
suitable model of the relationship between cumulative exposure and risk would be an 
essential requirement for development of asbestos exposure-focused screening 
programmes.

Chemoprophylaxis is an attractive alternative approach to improving survival in patients at 
high risk of asbestos-related cancer, and does not require development of expensive 
screening technologies. Broadly speaking, chemoprophylaxis involves use of preventative 
therapy to modify the biology associated with carcinogenesis and reduce cancer incidence in 
patients with clearly definable high levels of risk. Use of therapies with minimal or no side-
effects is a prerequisite for chemoprophylaxis. Recent authors have strongly encouraged re-
evaluation of chemoprophylaxis in mesothelioma (Neri et al., 2012) after positive trials in 
breast (Cuzick et al., 2007; Fisher et al., 1998), prostate (Thompson et al., 2003)  and colorectal 
cancer (Rothwell et al., 2012; 2010). Major research groups are actively pursuing this, using 
high-throughput drug screening to identify novel molecules or existing medications that 
might be repurposed as chemoprophylactics, but identification of the right population will be 
required if this approach is to work. 
 
In the absence of effective therapies, or a state compensation scheme is many countries, the 
only means of redress for many with mesothelioma or asbestos-related lung cancer is to seek 
financial compensation through civil litigation. However, this generally requires the claimant 
to establish that asbestos exposures within one or more periods of employment was a 
material cause of their disease, which requires efforts to trace and document past exposure 
circumstances and to qualitatively or quantitatively characterise the exposure. The Helsinki 
Criteria for diagnosis and attribution of asbestos disease (Wolff et al., 2015), suggest that for 
mesothelioma to be attributed to asbestos exposure there should be “a history of significant 
occupational, domestic or environmental exposure”, although they caution that 
  
7 
mesothelioma may occur after lower level asbestos exposure. A method of accurately 
quantifying exposure would be a valuable tool for this purpose. 
 
The aim of this paper is to describe a method of reconstructing past inhalation exposure to 
asbestos and to validate the methodology by comparing estimated exposure levels with 
measured values.  
 
Methods  
The method of reconstructing asbestos exposure has been previously described (Cherrie et 
al., 1996) and there are limited validation data for asbestos and other hazardous occupational 
exposures (Cherrie and Schneider, 1999). The general methodology has been adapted to form 
the basis of the Advanced REACH Tool (ART) for estimating exposure to chemicals within the 
scope of the European REACH Regulations (Cherrie et al., 2011; Schinkel et al., 2011; 
Tielemans et al., 2008b) and for the Dutch control banding tool Stoffenmanager (Tielemans 
et al., 2008a).  However, neither of these tools enables the assessment of asbestos fibre 
exposure. We briefly summarise the method here using the terminology of Tielemans et al., 
(2008b).  
 
The method is based on a simple source-receptor model of exposure incorporating a source 
term that is dependent on three factors: the substance emission potential (E), Activity 
emission potential (H) and the effectiveness of any local control measures (LC). Substance 
emission potential reflects the intrinsic property of the material being handled, e.g. the 
dustiness of the asbestos containing material, that is assumed to be dependent on the type 
and proportion of asbestos present, and the extent of bonding in the product, e.g. presence 
  
8 
of a cement matrix. Activity emission potential describes the way the material is handled and 
primarily relates to the amount of energy imparted to the material to disperse the 
contaminant. General dilution ventilation (D) in a workroom will also have an impact on the 
contaminant concentration (Cherrie et al., 2011). 
 
Three further parameters are incorporated into the basic model: the passive or fugitive 
emission (Su), the fractional time the source is active (ta) and the efficiency of any respiratory 
protection (RPE). All these model parameters are assumed to be independent of each other 
and they are combined in a multiplicative form to estimate the exposure level. The main 
exception to this is the passive emission term, which is included as an additive factor 
unrelated to the active source. 
 
For a single source close to a worker, the exposure level (C) would be: 
 
𝐶 = (𝐸 × 𝐻 × 𝐿𝐶 × 𝑡𝑎 + 𝑆𝑢) × 𝐷 × 𝑅𝑃𝐸  
 
 
 
(1) 
 
The model simplifies the dispersion of contaminants away from sources using two notional 
spatial regions: the near-field, which is a volume around the worker whose exposure is being 
investigated and the far-field, which comprises the remainder of the work environment. 
Equation 1 should therefore more correctly be written with suffixes for the near-field, i.e. 
“NF” and where the source is in the far-field with “FF”, as in equations 2 and 3.  
 
𝐶𝑁𝐹 = (𝐸𝑁𝐹 × 𝐻𝑁𝐹 × 𝐿𝐶𝑁𝐹 × 𝑡𝑎𝑁𝐹 + 𝑆𝑢𝑁𝐹) × 𝐷𝑁𝐹 × 𝑅𝑃𝐸  
 
(2) 
 
  
9 
𝐶𝐹𝐹 = (𝐸𝐹𝐹 × 𝐻𝐹𝐹 × 𝐿𝐶𝐹𝐹 × 𝑡𝑎𝐹𝐹 + 𝑆𝑢𝐹𝐹) × 𝐷𝐹𝐹 × 𝑅𝑃𝐸  
 
(3) 
 
In this scheme the intrinsic and passive emissions nominally have concentration units 
(fibres/ml). This would correspond to the airborne concentration generated with a certain 
‘standardised’ handling. The other terms in these equations are dimensionless. Overall 
exposure (C) is the sum of the NF and FF exposure level terms, i.e. 
 
𝐶 = 𝐶𝑁𝐹 + 𝐶𝐹𝐹 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
To reconstruct exposure levels, the assessor must assign numeric values to each of the 
parameters. Selection of these parameters should be based on descriptive information for 
the process and work activities, although in some instances they may need to use their 
judgement, e.g. when details about the duration of the dust generating activity are 
unavailable or the task description is unclear. To aid consistency while coding exposure level 
it is recommend that assessors are trained and use the asbestos-specific guidance (see 
Supplemental Data 1), which also ensures estimates are obtained in units of fibres/ml. 
Exposures can be independently reconstructed by two or three assessors if there is a need for 
greater reliability, but there is little value in having more than three independent assessments 
(Semple et al., 2001). 
 
In the present study we have used the method to estimate exposure for a number of scenarios 
selected from either the published literature or from in-house reports (Supplemental Data 2). 
In each case a text description of the scenario was extracted and this was used as the basis 
for the reconstruction. No allowance was made for the reduction in exposure from wearing a 
  
10 
respirator because in each case the estimate was compared with measurements made 
outside any respiratory protection. A number of the scenarios were used in a previous study 
(Cherrie and Schneider, 1999). However, at the stage of assessment, the available 
measurement data were unknown to the assessor.  The modelled data were input to a Monte 
Carlo simulation where the assigned parameters were varied from -50% to +50% of the value, 
selected from a uniform distribution. The simulation was carried out 1,000 times and the 5th 
and 95th percentile values were used as measures of the uncertainty in the assessment from 
parameter assignment.  
 
Where the measurement data was only available as a summary range with the number of 
measurements, we used imputed values evenly spaced out on the log scale, e.g. 1, 3, 10 etc.  
We carried out a linear regression analysis of the log-transformed measurement (lnM) and 
modelled estimates (lnC) using ‘regress’ command in the STATA software package (Statacorp. 
2013. Stata Statistical Software. Release 13. College Station, TX: Statacorp LP). The ‘predict’ 
command was used to calculate the linear predictor of the final model and the standard error 
of the forecast, the latter being used to derive upper and lower bounds on the forecast.   
 
Results  
There were 32 scenarios assessed, with between one and 23 measurements of inhalation 
exposure level available for each (median 5 measurements). For four scenarios only the mean 
and range of exposure levels were available. The average exposure measured for each 
scenario ranged from 0.001 fibres/ml (engine reassembly with the installation of new 
chrysotile asbestos-containing gaskets) to 226 fibres/ml (grinding and grit blasting on steel 
  
11 
girders with crocidolite spray insulation). All measurements were made during the work tasks 
rather than as 8-hour average values.  
 
The results of the assessments in comparison with the measured data are shown in Figure 1. 
The area of each circle is proportional to the number of measurements contributing to the 
scenario and the vertical lines represent the minimum and maximum model estimates 
derived from the Monte Carlo simulation of parameter uncertainty. The dotted line is the line 
of equality and the solid line is the regression line (shaded area is the 95% prediction? 
interval). 
 
There is an apparent tendency of the model to overestimate at lower levels of exposure and 
under estimate at higher levels. The regression line (C = 1.285xM0.705, r2=0.74) is significantly 
different from the 1:1 line (p<0.001). The prediction interval, the interval around the 
regression line within which 95% of the measurements are located, is just over an order of 
magnitude higher or lower.  
 
In a number of situations there was more than a ten-fold difference between the estimated 
value and the measured exposure level, e.g. in the scenario involving removal of asbestos-
containing gaskets in a chemical plant (Supplemental Data 2, Scenario A31) where the 
assessment relied on the brief text description extracted from the published paper describing 
the work (Spence and Rocchi, 1996). The average measured value was 0.1 fibres/ml (range 
0.051 – 0.24 fibres/ml) and the estimate was 0.002 fibres/ml (uncertainty range 0.001 – 0.005 
fibres/ml). The text description for the task stated that when a gasket was removed, the 
individual applied a wetting agent to the gasket, and then attempted to remove it with little 
  
12 
effort using only a putty knife. If the gasket came out easily, it was placed in a plastic bag for 
special disposal. If the gasket proved difficult to remove or broke in the process, it was left for 
a second group of workers to deal with. Workers removed between 2 and 9 gaskets in a shift, 
although there was no information about the time spent in removal.  The main reasons for 
the low estimated exposure were the assumed low substance emission potential (E=0.2) and 
low activity emission potential (H=0.1), along with low time on task (ta=0.1). These 
parameters resulted in the low estimated value.  However, the authors also noted that, ‘on 
further analysis with transmission electron microscopy it was found that only four of the 11 
samples contained asbestos in very low concentrations and that most of the fibres, which 
were identified using phase-contrast microscopy, probably originated from the glass fibre 
lagging around the pipes’.  
 
Discussion  
The model estimation method described here has the potential to reconstruct individual 
exposure to asbestos across a wide range of circumstances to within about an order of 
magnitude or the average of several periods of exposure more precisely. The estimates can 
be used to reconstruct cumulative exposure for multiple jobs and multiple tasks within a job 
by subdividing the work history into a sequence of tasks and then combining the data, 
weighting each task exposure by the total time worked in that task. The approach relies on 
descriptive information about the work process and the environment where the work was 
undertaken, which can be obtained by interview with the exposed person or a work colleague. 
As was the case in this exercise the information can be quite brief, but if more detail is 
available it is likely to result in more precise estimates. The method is suitable for use in 
epidemiological studies, for reconstructing exposure for civil litigation or compensation cases 
  
13 
and potentially in selecting patients for future screening for chemoprophylaxis studies. The 
exposure determinants in the model define the key information that should be collected from 
interviews with exposed individual or others knowledgeable about their exposure. Assessors 
should be trained by someone experienced in the method and undertake suitable quality 
assurance assessments by reconstructing exposures for scenarios where measurement data 
are available. Using the mean of two or three independent assessors can reduce the variability 
in the final estimates (Semple et al., 2001) and in addition reconstructing exposure for a 
lifetime work history comprising several jobs would also result in reduced variability. Use of 
any available exposure measurement data, within a Bayesian framework, could improve the 
accuracy of the estimates further (McNally et al., 2014). 
 
The data from this exercise are comparable with the information in Cherrie and Schneider 
(1999) with both assessments showing a high correlation between the log-transformed 
estimated and measured exposure concentrations, with an overall overestimation in the 
assessments. The association is most likely because of the interlinking of different model 
parameters between scenarios, e.g. if the substance emission potential for asbestos-
containing materials with 10 – 15% chrysotile asbestos is set at 0.6 for one scenario then it 
should be the same of all other scenarios where the same material is used.  The positive bias 
is either dependent on the descriptive information used to reconstruct the exposure or is an 
inherent part of the exposure assessment methodology. It has been observed with other 
exposure reconstruction methods involving subjective judgement that assessments are often 
positively biased, with the bias reduced when the assessors have access to contextually 
relevant measurement data (Hawkins and Evans, 1989). 
 
  
14 
There are other approaches that have been proposed for estimating past exposure to 
asbestos. For example, Rasmuson et al., (2014) carried out a retrospective exposure 
assessment for 363 deceased asbestos workers for whom asbestos lung burden data were 
available (fibre number assessed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy plus 
number of asbestos bodies, both per gram wet lung). The exposure estimates were 
independently carried out by four experienced industrial hygienists using expert judgement, 
with the cumulative exposure estimated, i.e. as fibres/ml-years. Detailed information about 
the exposure circumstances was sparse, although the job title or exposure circumstances and 
duration of exposure were available for each case. The assessors showed a high degree of 
correlation on the assessed cumulative exposure (r2 for log-transformed data between 0.81 
and 0.88), which must, at least in part, reflect the given specific exposure durations. There 
was a statistically significant association between the average cumulative exposure estimates 
and the lung burden (r2 = 0.45 for the log-transformed data). However, this method relies 
completely on the expertise of the assessors and is not easily generalizable.  
 
Pannet et al., (1985) developed a job-exposure matrix (JEM) for a range of occupational 
carcinogens including asbestos, although in common with most tools of this type exposure 
was described as a categorical variable (high, moderate, low or none). Burdorf and Swuste, 
(1999) developed a JEM for asbestos with 19 jobs and exposure in five decades from 1946 to 
1995, with exposure categorised into four exposure levels and four probability groups. The 
exposure estimates were to be used in a stepwise decision tree to help ascertain causation of 
asbestosis and mesothelioma. These approaches provide a relatively crude selection of 
individuals diagnosed with mesothelioma with a cumulative exposure above around 0.25 
fibres/ml-years being identified as having their disease caused by asbestos. van Oyen et al., 
  
15 
(2015) developed a JEM for a wide range of jobs in Australia based on expert judgement 
supported by a wide range of historic exposure data, although the data were not 
quantitatively used to assess exposure (AsbJEM). Annual average exposure and asbestos type 
were estimated for this JEM for three time periods (1943–1986, 1987–2003, ≥2004).   
 
Peters (2016a) describe a JEM developed for four carcinogens, including asbestos, based on 
statistical modelling of a large number of personal exposure measurements (27,958 for 
asbestos) and a prior categorical assessment of exposure (none, low and high). The statistical 
model allowed exposure estimates to be provided by job, subdivided by geographic region 
and year. While this approach has the benefit of being based on quantitative data it is 
dependent on these data being representative of the exposure circumstances, and for 
example it is notable that there is little contrast in the modelled exposure level between the 
three exposure categories (e.g. the geometric mean for low jobs was 0.061 fibres/ml and for 
high jobs 0.074 fibres/ml).  There are also marked regional differences in estimated exposure 
(e.g. Germany and the Netherlands being a factor of 10 times higher than UK and Sweden), 
which is hard to explain by differences in legislation or work practices.    
 
Most JEMs are primarily based on the judgement of the researchers with the assessment 
based on relatively broad job titles encompassing a diverse range of work involving asbestos, 
and none have been validated against objective measurement data; their reliability is 
therefore likely to be poor. Kottek and Kilpatrick (2016) criticised the Australian AsbJEM for 
underestimating the frequency of high exposure tasks, resulting in their view in considerably 
underestimated annual average exposures for some jobs, e.g. by more than an order of 
magnitude. In response, the authors (Peters et al., 2016b) highlighted the inherent limitation 
  
16 
of JEMs that they assign exposure for all people with the same job title similarly, despite the 
likely very large variation in actual exposure within a job (Kromhout et al., 1993).  While JEMs 
can provide estimates of past exposure, and they may be the only suitable approach where 
there is very limited information about the exposure circumstances, they are likely to be 
imprecise and inaccurate.  The method outlined here defines the additional information 
beyond job title that should be collected to describe an exposure circumstance and provides 
specific individual estimates based on these data.   
 
An important use for this exposure reconstruction method could be selection of past asbestos 
workers or others at increased risk of asbestos-related cancer for screening (lung cancer or 
mesothelioma) and/or trials of novel chemoprophylaxis strategies. Those who were exposed 
to asbestos in the past and their families are naturally often concerned about the risk of being 
diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease, and often call for screening to detect disease. 
This was recently reflected in the outcome of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting 
Partnership (Stephens et al., 2015), which brought together patients, carers, researchers and 
clinicians involved with mesothelioma.  Research Priority no. 9 stated ‘does an annual chest 
x-ray and/or CT scan and medical examination in high-risk occupations (e.g. carpenters, 
plumbers, electricians, shipyard workers) lead to earlier diagnosis of mesothelioma?’ The 
Helsinki Criteria group made a similar recommendation (Wolff et al., 2015).  However, this 
question presupposes that chest x-ray/CT screening with an accompanying medical 
examination is a fruitful screening method, and that appropriate patients can be simply 
selected based on their occupation. Previous studies demonstrated this is not the case (Fasola 
et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2009) and mesothelioma screening is likely to be complex area, 
with technological challenges in detecting a difficult to image cancer and ethical issues in 
  
17 
detecting a cancer early, without curative treatment currently available.  Nevertheless, it is 
widely accepted that earlier detection of cancer is likely, over time to improve outcomes, not 
least by allowing the maximum possible number of patients to enter clinical trials of new 
treatments. It is our view that, given the considerable expansion of mesothelioma research 
over recent decades, early detection will accelerate the development of new treatments and 
should be pursued aggressively.  This view is clearly supported by patients (Stephens et al., 
2015). In addition, an earlier mesothelioma diagnosis will facilitate improved access to the 
currently available therapies, including chemotherapy which improves survival in some 
patients (Santoro et al., 2008; Vogelzang, 2008; Zalcman et al., 2016).  Other clinical services 
which can be provided to mesothelioma patents include medical thoracoscopy for optimal 
diagnostics  (Hooper et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2010), means of controlling pleural effusion 
(pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheters (Fysh et al., 2013; Rintoul et al., 2014), 
admission avoidance clinics and access to a mesothelioma clinical nurse specialists (White, 
2016) who can provide holistic care and advice about symptom control. In most healthcare 
systems these services are provided regionally and early detection allows patients to access 
these more easily. 
 
Multiple research groups, including our own, are currently testing a range of novel biomarker 
technologies, including soluble proteins in blood (Creaney et al., 2014; Ostroff et al., 2012; 
Pass et al., 2012; Tabata et al., 2013) molecules in exhaled breath  (Chapman et al., 2012; 
Dragonieri et al., 2012) and imaging end-points (Coolen et al., 2014; Tsim et al., 2015), allied 
to the asbestos exposure model described here could be used in the near future to test better 
screening strategies. However, screening will only be practicable and acceptable if the 
program can first identify those most at risk. This could be done by reconstructing the 
  
18 
cumulative exposure of former asbestos workers or others at  risk and using these data to 
estimate lifetime risk using a suitable risk model, such as that of Hodgson and Darnton (2000). 
Selecting individuals’ whose lifetime risk is estimated to be more than about 5% would 
probably result in a viable pre-selection for screening, or enrolment in chemoprophylaxis 
programmes which are currently under development. Feasibility and pilot studies to test this 
approach are urgently needed.   
 
 
Funding  
No external funding was received. 
 
Conflict of interest 
JWC and DMcE have previously prepared reports for civil and criminal court cases involving 
exposure to asbestos.
