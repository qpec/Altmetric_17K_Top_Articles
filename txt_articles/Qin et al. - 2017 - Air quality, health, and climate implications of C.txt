Facing severe air pollution and growing dependence on natural
gas imports, the Chinese government plans to increase coal-based
synthetic natural gas (SNG) production. Although displacement of coal
with SNG benefits air quality, it increases CO2 emissions. Due to var-
iations in air pollutant and CO2 emission factors and energy efficiencies
across sectors, coal replacement with SNG results in varying degrees of
air quality benefits and climate penalties. We estimate air quality,
human health, and climate impacts of SNG substitution strategies in
2020. Using all production of SNG in the residential sector results in an
annual decrease of ∼32,000 (20,000 to 41,000) outdoor-air-pollution-
associated premature deaths, with ranges determined by the low and
high estimates of the health risks. If changes in indoor/household air
pollution were also included, the decrease would be far larger. SNG
deployment in the residential sector results in nearly 10 and 60 times
greater reduction in premature mortality than if it is deployed in the
industrial or power sectors, respectively. Due to inefficiencies in cur-
rent household coal use, utilization of SNG in the residential sector
results in only 20 to 30% of the carbon penalty compared with using
it in the industrial or power sectors. Even if carbon capture and storage
is used in SNG production with today’s technology, SNG emits 22 to
40% more CO2 than the same amount of conventional gas. Among the
SNG deployment strategies we evaluate, allocating currently planned
SNG to households provides the largest air quality and health benefits
with the smallest carbon penalties.

C
hina’s ongoing coal-based synthetic natural gas (SNG) de-
velopment is largely motivated by efforts to reduce its extreme
ambient air pollution and dependence on foreign natural gas. Over
the past 15 y, China’s total natural gas consumption has increased
from 25 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2000 to 187 bcm in 2014, an
annual growth rate of 15% (1). However, domestic natural gas
production failed to keep pace with the increases in demand. In 2007,
China’s natural gas consumption surpassed domestic production for
the first time, and, by the end of 2014, dependence on foreign natural
gas had increased to 30% (1). After publicity surrounding high air
pollution levels in 2013 (2–4), the Chinese government aimed to
further increase both the quantity and the proportion of energy
obtained from natural gas (5). Until 2014, natural gas accounted for
approximately ∼9% and ∼5% of China’s energy consumption in the
residential (including both residential and commercial cooking and
heating) and industrial sectors, respectively, as well as ∼2% of na-
tional total electricity generation, suggesting large potential for fur-
ther increases in natural gas use in these sectors (1).
Historically, China has been characterized as rich in coal but poor
in gas and oil (6). Recently, to increase natural gas supplies, the
central government has emphasized domestic unconventional gas
development, including SNG. As a result, 2013 was considered a
“golden year” for the SNG industry. Through 2013, a total capacity
of 37.1 bcm per year of SNG production had been approved by the
central government, with another 40 projects (∼200 bcm per year)
proposed by the industry (7). Total planned SNG capacity is
∼1.25 times China’s 2014 total natural gas consumption (1). Also,
the Chinese government set targets for annual SNG production of
15 bcm to 18 bcm by 2015 and 32 bcm by 2017, with a potential
production of ∼57 bcm by 2020 (8–11). Notably, government plans
for SNG production are continuously changing, likely due to a mix
of concerns about the coal industry, local economy, air pollution in
eastern China, energy security, local water stress, and global climate
change (7, 12–15).
China’s coal-based SNG strategy converts low-quality dirty coal in
western parts of China into SNG via coal gasification and metha-
nation. As methanation catalysts are prone to sulfur poisoning,
hydrogen sulfide is removed from the coal and converted to ele-
mental sulfur before methanation. This process essentially elimi-
nates emissions of sulfur compounds including SO2. Additionally,
the SNG production process emits negligible NOx, which would
occur if the coal were burned in steam and power-generating boilers
(16). After converting coal to SNG, it is transported to and used in
eastern provinces. Compared with direct combustion of coal, gas
combustion emits negligible fine particulates and SO2, and little
NOx (17–19). Thus, replacing coal with SNG substantially reduces
emissions of air pollutants at the location of the end user (20).
However, the SNG cycle emits more CO2 than direct use of coal.
For electricity generation, up to 60% higher lifecycle CO2 emissions
occur with SNG than with ultrasupercritical coal-fired power plants
per kilowatt hour of electricity generated (12). As a result, plans for
Significance
China’s coal-based synthetic natural gas (SNG) projects can reduce
air pollution and associated premature mortality by substituting
for direct coal use in power, industry, and households. These
benefits, however, come with increased CO2 emissions unless
carbon capture and storage (CCS) is applied in SNG production.
Even with CCS, SNG has higher CO2 emissions than conventional
natural gas. In the United States, increases in natural gas supplies
have been primarily deployed to the power sector. In China,
however, due to inefficient and uncontrolled coal combustion in
households, we find that allocating currently available SNG to the
residential sector provides the largest air quality and health ben-
efits and smallest climate penalties compared with allocation to
the power or industrial sectors.

 increasing use of SNG are projected to dramatically increase
CO2 emissions.
An integrated analysis of the impacts of China’s SNG plans on
national air quality and associated health benefits as well as on global
carbon emissions is needed to provide guidance to the Chinese
government on SNG development. Moreover, as multiple SNG
projects are already in place or under construction, it is important to
determine production technologies and end-use applications that
will bring as large air quality and health benefits as possible while
keeping carbon and energy penalties as small as possible.
This paper quantifies the air quality, human health, and CO2
emission impacts of China’s SNG strategy using an integrated
assessment approach. We use the ECLIPSE_V5a_CLE scenario
(evaluating the climate and air quality impacts of short-lived
pollutants) for 2020 as our base case as it reflects the air pollution
policies and regulations in place for China’s 12th Five-Year Plan
(FYP) (21–24). Approximately 85% of natural gas in China is
consumed in the power, industrial, and residential sectors (25). Thus,
we construct three SNG sectoral allocation scenarios (SNG_Power,
SNG_Industrial, and SNG_Residential) by deploying all potentially
available SNG (57 bcm) in 2020 into each key demand sector in turn.
We substitute SNG for coal in each sector we analyze in proportion
to the gas required to displace that quantity of coal in the subsector
under the base case across provinces targeted to receive SNG
(Table S1). Due to large uncertainties in actual SNG production in
2020 and practical constraints on SNG deployment, SNG allocation
scenarios built in this study are effectively sensitivity analyses to
identify the potential impacts of SNG use in each sector. They are
not intended to be analyzed as to their actual executability in the
real world. We estimate changes in air pollutant emissions resulting
from SNG substitution for coal under each scenario (medium sce-
narios in Table S1). We then simulate the resulting changes in
PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or
smaller) concentrations, associated health impacts, and resulting
changes in CO2 emissions. Fig. 1 shows the potential provincial
distribution of SNG production and consumption based on gov-
ernment plans and gas pipeline infrastructure (7, 8, 12, 26).
Through regional atmospheric chemistry model simulations, we
evaluate the monthly mean PM2.5 surface concentrations in Janu-
ary, April, July, and October at a horizontal resolution of 27 ×
27 km2 for the base case and for each SNG scenario. The mean
concentration for the year is assumed to be the average of these
four months. We also estimate the population-weighted (P-W)
annual average PM2.5 surface concentrations at the provincial level.
Burnett et al. (27) developed disease-specific integrated exposure
response (IER) functions for PM2.5 that cover the global range of
exposures, including ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular
disease (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
and lung cancer (LC) for adults (≥25 y old), and acute lower re-
spiratory infection (ALRI) for children (<5 y old). Based on the
IER functions and P-W provincial PM2.5 surface concentrations, we
estimate the disease-specific population attributable fraction (PAF)
from exposure to ambient PM2.5 for each province and the corre-
sponding air pollution-related premature mortality. Differences in
national total premature deaths between each SNG scenario and
the base case are used to estimate the avoided premature deaths
under each SNG scenario. In parallel, we estimate the net changes
in CO2 emissions resulting from SNG substitution for coal under
each scenario. Calculation details are described in SI Materials
and Methods.
Results
Impacts of SNG Substitution on Pollutant and CO2 Emissions. For all sce-
narios, substituting SNG for coal results in net reductions in air pol-
lutant emissions: −40 g SO2/m3 to −0.7 g SO2/m3 SNG, −5 g NOx/m3
to −0.5 g NOx/m3 SNG, −21 g PM10/m3 to −0.7 g PM10/m3 SNG,
and −19 g PM2.5/m3 to −0.4 g PM2.5/m3 SNG, varying primarily on
the end-use application (Fig. 2). These reductions occur because
natural gas has higher energy efficiencies and lower air pollutant
emission factors (EFs) than coal per unit energy input.
Use of SNG in the residential sector results in the largest re-
ductions in the emissions of all air pollutants considered here (Fig.
2). For instance, allocating all planned SNG to the residential sector
reduces SO2 emissions more than twice as much as allocating all
SNG to the industrial sector, and 15 times more than allocating it to
the power sector. SNG allocation to the power sector reduces air
pollutant emissions the least; this is primarily because the power
sector has the most stringent emission controls on coal combustion
among the three sectors, whereas the residential sector coal emis-
sions are generally uncontrolled. This results in the lowest average
abated air pollutant EFs in the power sector (SI Materials and
Methods, Estimating Air Pollutant and Carbon Dioxide Emission
Changes and Fig. S1). The industrial sector also has a large fraction
of low-emitting coal boilers, due to efficient control technologies,
particularly for SO2 and particulate matter. In addition, thermal
efficiency improvement from a coal to gas switch is the largest in the
residential sector (Table S2). Thus, proportionally substituting coal
with the same amount of SNG in the residential sector leads to
much larger air pollutant emission reductions than in the other two
sectors. We also present the spatial distribution of monthly mean
SO2 emission reductions under each scenario as an illustration (Fig.
S2), and identify substantial reductions across four seasons when all
planned SNG is allocated to the residential sector, particularly in
Beijing (28%), Tianjin (13%), and Hebei (18%) provinces.
Across scenarios, however, we observe energy (7 MJ/m3 to 28
MJ/m3 SNG) and CO2 (0.5 kg CO2/m3 to 2.5 kg CO2/m3 SNG)
penalties; this is because the higher energy content of gas over coal
per carbon atom is offset by the larger quantity of coal used to
produce SNG. Although energy and CO2 penalties cannot be
avoided completely, we find that SNG allocation to the residential
sector, in addition to providing the largest reductions in air pollutant
emissions, results in the least energy loss and the smallest increases
in CO2 emissions. These results occur because the largest thermal
efficiency improvement of switching from coal to gas occurs in the
residential sector (SI Materials and Methods, Estimating Air Pollutant
and Carbon Dioxide Emission Changes and Table S2) (28).
Impacts of SNG Substitution on PM2.5 Surface Concentration. We
simulate China’s 2020 baseline monthly mean PM2.5 surface
concentrations for January, April, July, and October (Fig. S3A).
Model evaluation is shown in SI Model Evaluation (Fig. S4 and
Table S3). PM2.5 concentrations are significantly higher in Jan-
uary and October than in April or July; this is due to higher
emissions resulting from residential heating in winter, and more
stagnant meteorological conditions and less precipitation in
January and October. In addition, relatively low simulated PM2.5
concentrations occur in April partly because dust emissions are
not included in our simulations. We find the Beijing−Tianjin−
Hebei (BTH) region has extremely high area-wide PM2.5 con-
centrations, with maximum monthly mean PM2.5 levels reaching
170 μg/m3 at the grid level in January. Even in April and July, the

 maximum monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations in BTH can be
more than 80 μg/m3.
Monthly mean PM2.5 surface concentrations are reduced in all
SNG scenarios, but by far the largest decrease occurs when all
planned SNG is allocated to the residential sector (Fig. 3). This
allocation maximizes reductions in both primary PM2.5 emissions
and the formation of secondary PM2.5 due to reduction in emissions
of major precursors (i.e., SO2 and NOx). Grid-level reductions are
generally more than 5 μg/m3 across all seasons in the BTH region,
and can reach 60 μg/m3 (∼30% reduction) in the dirtiest season
(winter). In comparison, the PM2.5 concentration reductions are
less than 2 μg/m3 in the BTH region year-round when all available
SNG is allocated to the power sector, and less than 5 μg/m3 when it
is allocated to the industrial sector (Fig. S3 B and C).
China’s base case annual average P-W PM2.5 surface concentra-
tions at the provincial level in 2020 are shown in Fig. 4A. Annual
average P-W PM2.5 concentrations are projected to be ∼70 μg/m3
in BTH. This amount is twice China’s annual average PM2.5
national standards (35 μg/m3) (GB3095-2012) and 7 times that
of the World Health Organization (WHO) standards (10 μg/m3)
(29, 30).
Fig. 4 B−D shows changes in annual average P-W PM2.5 surface
concentrations across SNG sectoral scenarios. Using SNG in the
residential sector to replace coal leads to the largest provincial-level
P-W PM2.5 concentration reductions. For instance, PM2.5 concen-
trations are reduced by 19 μg/m3 (26%), 12 μg/m3 (17%), and 13 μg/
m3 (18%) in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces, respectively. In
addition to the BTH region, several other SNG producing and
consuming provinces, such as Henan, Shandong, Jilin, Shanxi, and
Inner Mongolia, also exhibit ∼10% PM2.5 concentration reductions
because of substantial reductions in SO2 and PM2.5 emissions. In
contrast, provincial-level PM2.5 concentration reductions are virtually
small when all planned SNG is allocated to the industrial or power
sectors [generally less than 0.6 μg/m3 (<1.5%) and 0.2 μg/m3
(< 0.5%), respectively].
Impacts of SNG Substitution on Premature Mortality. National total
avoided premature deaths under our SNG scenarios are shown in Fig.
5, with stroke and IHD contributing roughly 60% of total reductions
in premature mortality. Across scenarios, use of SNG in the residential
sector results in the largest decreases in total adult premature deaths
of ∼32,000 (20,000 to 40,000) and child deaths of 320 (200 to 400)
annually, with the range resulting from the low and high estimates of
relative risks. These reductions are roughly 10 and 60 times higher
than reductions obtained by deploying SNG in the industrial and
power sectors, respectively. Consistent with Liu et al. (31) findings for
the BTH region, our results highlight enormous benefits for China’s
air quality and associated human health by switching from coal to
cleaner fuels in the residential sector across the country.
Comparison of SNG Scenarios’ Air Quality and Climate Impacts With
and Without Utilization of Carbon Capture and Storage. Using all
SNG in the residential sector clearly provides the largest air
quality and human health benefits, with the smallest energy and
CO2 penalties among the scenarios we evaluate (Fig. 6). How-
ever, even under the SNG_Residential scenario, SNG substitu-
tion for coal results in an increase of 28 million tonnes of CO2
emissions, ∼0.2% of national total projected CO2 emissions in
2020 (24) (Fig. 6). For comparison, we replace coal with the same
amount of conventional natural gas as SNG in the residential
sector, and follow the same allocation strategies shown in Table
S1 (medium scenarios). We find that such replacement can re-
duce CO2 emissions by 214 million tonnes relative to household
use of coal, or reduce CO2 emissions by 242 million tonnes rel-
ative to SNG while providing the same amount of air quality and
health benefits.

bound (SNG displaces cleanest coal first) and upper bound (SNG displaces dirtiest coal first) substitution scenarios described in Table S1. The industrial sector
has no error bar for CO2 emissions and energy intensity due to the simplifying assumption in the ECLIPSE emission scenario that industrial coal boilers have the
same CO2 EF and thermal efficiency (SI Materials and Methods, Estimating Air Pollutant and Carbon Dioxide Emission Changes and Table S2).

 As all SNG allocation strategies increase CO2 emissions relative
to coal, we explore whether carbon capture and storage (CCS), if
used with SNG production, can make SNG an attractive option for
both air quality and climate. China has been one of the major
players working on CCS demonstration projects in recent years (32).
In SNG production, CO2 is separated from syngas before methanation
regardless of conducting CCS because this optimizes the economics of
the process by cost savings from higher methanation efficiency and
lower volume of input syngas (16, 33). Thus, CO2 is emitted as a by-
product of SNG production, and it does not require additional energy
to separate the CO2, therefore causing a relatively low energy penalty
when conducting CCS (16). We estimate the net energy penalty for
conducting CCS at SNG plants to be ∼9 to 15% (Table S4), with the
range dependent on where the energy for conducting CCS comes
from (SI SNG Production–Energy Penalty of CCS).
Nevertheless, even with CCS used for SNG production, net CO2
emissions are still 22 to 40% higher than occurs with the same amount
of conventional natural gas, with the range depending on end uses and
the energy sources for CCS (Table S5). Substituting coal with SNG
equipped with CCS requires 20 to 100% additional energy input
compared with directly burning coal, varying primarily depending on
end uses (Table S5). Thus, we find that SNG cannot simultaneously
address the multiple objectives facing China: air quality improvement,
carbon emissions mitigation, and energy intensity reduction.
Discussion
This study identifies deploying SNG to the residential sector as the
allocation strategy providing the largest net environmental benefits
among the substitution scenarios analyzed. We leave it to policy
makers to decide how much they are willing to pay for these ben-
efits. We did not include economic analysis of each SNG scenario.
We realize that, even though deploying SNG to the residential
sector results in much larger health benefits and lower climate
penalties than deployment to the power and industrial sectors, it
may also require higher investment on last-meter distribution
pipelines, particularly for rural areas with low population density
(28). However, given that only 40% of China’s urban population
used natural gas in 2015 (1), there may still be large opportunities to
distribute SNG to urban residents using solid fuels before making
large investments in reaching rural residents. Additionally, in low
population-density regions, SNG can be compressed or liquefied
and then transported by trucks that can be more cost-effective than
pipelines (34, 35). Some provincial governments are already
expanding natural gas use to rural areas by subsidizing gas pipeline
construction for rural households and transporting natural gas in
the form of LNG and CNG to improve the clean fuel accessibility
for rural residents (36).
The absolute environmental impacts estimated in this study are
subject to uncertainties in actual SNG production, how well the
ECLIPSE_V5a_CLE scenario reflects the actual energy and emis-
sion status in 2020, and the representation of PM2.5 in our atmo-
spheric chemistry model. Our model captures the magnitude and
trend of PM2.5 concentrations fairly well, particularly in eastern re-
gions where air quality and human health improvement pre-
dominantly occur (SI Model Evaluation). The actual energy use and
emissions in 2020 will likely differ from the ECLIPSE_V5a_CLE
scenario. Indications are that actual SNG production will be lower
than the production target we use here, due, in part, to the Chinese
central government’s frequent downward adjustment of SNG pro-
duction plans. However, our finding that substantial health benefits
and relatively small climate penalties occur when available SNG is
allocated to the residential sector is likely to persist as long as in-
efficient and uncontrolled coal use continues in the residential sector.
Our atmospheric chemistry model places all emissions into the
surface layer (0 m to 32 m), and air pollutant concentrations in each
grid box are instantly well mixed. The power and industrial sectors
discharges much of their emissions via stacks above 32 m, whereas
the residential sector primarily discharges closer to the surface than
is resolved in the model. Thus, our study may have overestimated
the PM2.5-associated health benefits under the SNG_Power and
SNG_Industry scenarios, and underestimated that under the
SNG_Residential scenario. In addition, as household outdoor emis-
sions are released closer to populations, they have higher intake
fractions (dose or exposure effectiveness) than those from industry or
power (37), which would widen the differences in benefits even
further if taken into account. Finally, the significance of the resi-
dential sector would be even more striking if we included benefits to
the household environment itself, i.e., health impacts from indoor
and near-field air pollution (38). Nevertheless, SNG may have to be
allocated to other sectors if too much future SNG production causes
saturation of the residential sector or if costs of pipeline construction
limit the spread of SNG to the more densely populated areas. Total
2020 SNG evaluated here (∼30% of currently industry-planned SNG
projects) replaces ∼60% of baseline coal consumption in the resi-
dential sector. Supposing all of the ∼200 bcm per year SNG projects
are implemented, this will quickly use up the opportunities for coal
replacement in the residential sector and lead to significantly lower
marginal health benefits but larger marginal carbon penalties.
Our study does not consider the interactions between SNG
and renewable energy, which can potentially increase the air

 quality and climate benefits obtained from the power sector and
potentially allow electrification of the residential sector at a low-
carbon intensity. However, the role that natural gas can play in
facilitating wind and solar on-grid integration is likely to be
limited in China in the near future given the small amount of
natural gas in the power sector (even including all planned 2020
SNG). Also, the primary barriers to China’s renewable in-
tegration lie elsewhere (i.e., oversupply of coal-fired electricity
with fixed annual operation hours and inadequate transmission
capacity) (39).
Conclusions
China’s SNG development has important implications for both
regional air quality and global climate. Since 2013, China’s se-
vere air pollution has drawn enormous public attention and a
commitment from the government to implement measures that
improve air quality (4). Switching from coal to gas is identified in
the national action plan as a strategy to improve air quality (5),
and efforts to increase natural gas supply, including via devel-
opment of SNG production, are under way. However, wide
concerns about China’s SNG strategy exist as CO2 emissions per
unit of end-use energy delivered from SNG projects greatly ex-
ceed that associated with most other energy sources and will
have lasting and significant impacts on climate change (7, 15).
We find that sectoral allocation makes a huge difference in the
environmental performance of a limited quantity of SNG. For in-
stance, SNG substitution for coal in the residential sector can re-
duce PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH region by ∼20%. These
areas are among the most densely populated regions with the worst
air quality in China. Additionally, deploying all SNG to the residential
sector can avoid 32,000 (20,000 to 41,000) air pollution-related pre-
mature deaths nationwide in 2020. In contrast, allocating all SNG to
the power or industrial sectors barely improves air quality and avoids
only 560 (230 to 740) or 3,100 (1,300 to 4,300) premature deaths,
respectively. Similarly, due to relative efficiencies in the use of coal
and gas in the industrial and power sectors compared with the resi-
dential sector, net increases in CO2 emissions when all planned SNG
is used in the industrial or power sectors to replace coal are 2 and
4 times higher, respectively, than if it is used in the residential sector.
We also compare the health impacts and net carbon emissions from
two regional allocation scenarios, and find that allocating SNG to
affluent provinces or proportionally to provinces based on their
baseline gas needs for coal replacement leads to similar reductions in
national total premature mortality and carbon emission increases (see
SI Regional SNG Allocation for details).
Critically, energy and CO2 penalties exist across all scenarios.
Thus, without CCS used in SNG production, the air quality and
human health benefits of SNG substitution for coal are achieved at
the expense of CO2 emission increases. Even with CCS, however,
the climate performance of SNG remains worse than conventional
gas (SNG+CCS emits 22 to 40% more CO2 than the same amount
of conventional gas), and applying CCS for SNG production results
in ∼9 to 15% additional energy loss compared to SNG without
CCS. In China’s 2015 intended nationally determined contributions,
China pledged to peak its CO2 emissions by 2030 or earlier, and to
lower CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60 to
65% from the 2005 levels by 2030 (40). Thus, SNG development is
inconsistent with China’s efforts to reduce energy and carbon in-
tensity, but it does provide substantial air quality improvement with
relatively small climate cobenefits if done in conjunction with CCS.
To achieve its goals, China may wish to limit the scale of SNG
development and to conduct pilot projects on pairing CCS with
SNG production to facilitate achievement of its international cli-
mate commitment while addressing its domestic air pollution issue.
Allocating SNG to the residential sector is likely to bring the
largest air quality benefits with the smallest carbon penalties,
even without CCS. Importantly, the air quality benefits brought
by SNG can easily be achieved by other sources of natural gas,
which have a lower carbon footprint. Given the multiple chal-
lenges facing China today, other domestic gas sources, including
tight gas, coal-bed methane, and shale gas (with methane leakage
well controlled) (41), as well as increased energy efficiency and
an increasingly electrified energy economy driven by renewable
energy, are likely to provide equal air quality benefits with lower
negative climate impacts. Large challenges exist, however, in
switching from coal to natural gas. Challenges include an un-
derdeveloped pipeline infrastructure, high infrastructure costs par-
ticularly in low-population regions, and low price competitiveness of
natural gas compared with cheap coal. However, the Chinese cen-
tral government has demonstrated a political willingness to address
these issues and has set ambitious near- and long-term natural gas
use targets, and has designed and approved substantial natural gas
pipeline expansion projects (i.e., Xinjiang SNG pipeline project)
while reforming China’s natural gas market (8, 42). Meanwhile,
provincial and lower-level governments are also subsidizing local
pipeline construction and natural gas consumption for rural resi-
dents (36). Nevertheless, a reasonable price on carbon would fa-
cilitate a more accurate valuation of natural gas relative to both
carbon-intensive coal and carbon-free renewables.
Materials and Methods
We use an integrated assessment approach to estimate the air pollution-
associated human health impacts in mainland China under each SNG sce-
nario. The ECLIPSE_V5a_CLE scenario, developed by the Greenhouse Gas and
Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model at the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, gains.iiasa.ac.at/models/), is
used as our 2020 base case anthropogenic emission input. The GAINS model
provides detailed information regarding energy mix and consumption, end-
use technology, and EFs for major air pollutants in each subsector at the
provincial level. Based on the ECLIPSE_V5a_CLE scenario, we design SNG
allocation scenarios by deploying all planned production of SNG to replace
coal in the power sector, industrial sector, and residential sector, in turn, in
proportion to baseline gas required for coal replacement in each subsector.
We estimate the provincial anthropogenic emissions under the base case
and each scenario accordingly, and assume 2020 emissions within each
province follow the same spatial and temporal pattern as that of the 2010
Multi-Resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC, www.meicmodel.org).
We use the weather research and forecasting model coupled with
chemistry, version 3.6 (WRF-Chem v3.6), to simulate air pollutant concen-
trations for the 2020 base case and for each SNG scenario (43). The study
domain covers East Asia at a horizontal resolution of 27 × 27 km2 with 31 ver-
tical levels, from the surface to 50 millibars (mb), with a 32-m-thick surface layer.
The global 3D chemical transport model [Model for Ozone and Related Tracers
(MOZART-4)], with a resolution of 1.9° latitude × 2.5° longitude, provides the
Fig. 6.
Comparison of CO2 emission changes and avoided premature mor-
tality under various SNG allocation scenarios relative to the use of coal.
Results for standard SNG scenarios all find increases in CO2 emissions while
results that include CCS and the use of conventional natural gas (NG) all
result in reductions in CO2 emissions. Solid circles represent SNG without
applying CCS, and open circles represent SNG with CCS applied during SNG
production. Solid triangles represent the outcome when conventional natural
gas is used without CCS. We assume that electricity provided for SNG_CCS is from
natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants using CCS. For results with other
types of power plants, refer to SI SNG Production–Energy Penalty of CCS.

for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System final gridded
analysis datasets at a 6-h resolution (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/
model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs). Biogenic emissions
are calculated online using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from
Nature (MEGAN) (44).
To evaluate the health effects of the SNG allocation scenarios, we estimate
the changes in premature mortality that are associated with long-term ex-
posure to ambient PM2.5 pollution for both adults and children based on the
IER functions developed from the Global Burden of Disease studies (27).
Detailed methods are shown in SI Materials and Methods.
