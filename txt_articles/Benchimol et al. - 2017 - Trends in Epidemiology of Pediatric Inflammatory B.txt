OBJECTIVES: 
 
The incidence of pediatric-onset infl
 ammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide. We 
used population-based health administrative data to determine national Canadian IBD incidence, 
prevalence, and trends over time of childhood-onset IBD.
 
METHODS: 
 
We identifi
 ed children <16 years (y) diagnosed with IBD 1999–2010 from health administrative data 
in fi
 ve provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec), comprising 79.2% of the Canadian 
population. Standardized incidence and prevalence were calculated per 100,000 children. Annual 
percentage change (APC) in incidence and prevalence were determined using Poisson regression analysis. 
Provincial estimates were meta-analyzed using random-effects models to produce national estimates.
 
RESULTS: 
 
5,214 incident cases were diagnosed during the study period (3,462 Crohn’
s disease, 1,382 
ulcerative colitis, 279 type unclassifi
 able). The incidence in Canada was 9.68 (95% CI 9.11 to 
10.25) per 100,000 children. Incidence was similar amongst most provinces, but higher in Nova 
Scotia. APC in incidence did not signifi
 cantly change over the study period in the overall cohort 
(+2.06%, 95% CI −0.64% to +4.76%). However, incidence signifi
 cantly increased in children aged 
0–5y (+7.19%, 95% +2.82% to +11.56%). Prevalence at the end of the study period in Canada was 
38.25 (95% CI 35.78 to 40.73) per 100,000 children. Prevalence increased signifi
 cantly over time, 
APC +4.56% (95% CI +3.71% to +5.42%).
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
 
Canada has amongst the highest incidence of childhood-onset IBD in the world. Prevalence 
signifi
 cantly increased over time. Incidence was not statistically changed with the exception of a 
rapid increase in incidence in the youngest group of children.

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Epidemiology of Pediatric IBD in Canada
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Th
 e incidence and prevalence of childhood-onset infl
 ammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) has risen rapidly over the past two dec-
ades ( 
1 
). While previously considered rare in children, IBD has 
emerged as a global disease in developed and developing nations 
( 
2,3 
). Th
 e increasingly early onset of Crohn’s disease (CD) and 
ulcerative colitis (UC) raises important questions regarding the 
role of early-life factors in the pathogenesis of IBD ( 
4 
). It also rep-
resents a signifi
 cant burden to health care systems ( 
5 
), because 
the treatment of childhood-onset IBD is more expensive in the 
long-term ( 
6 
).
 
Canadian health administrative data represent an unprece-
dented opportunity to assess the trends in epidemiology and health 
services utilization of children with IBD. Each Canadian province 
has independent single-payer health systems, so all legal residents 
of each province are included within health administrative data. 
Independently, the trends of pediatric IBD have been described in 
individual Canadian provinces ( 
7–12 
). However, application of the 
same case identifi
 cation algorithm in diff
 erent jurisdictions with-
out additional validation can result in misclassifi
 cation bias ( 
13 
). 
Even though the health administrative data from each province are 
similar in database population and data structure, research using 
these data has revealed diff
 erences in trends. For example, stud-
ies from Ontario have consistently reported increasing incidence 
in children and teenagers ( 
7–9 
), with less pronounced increased 
incidence in adults ( 
9 
). However, research from Quebec ( 
12 
) and 
Nova Scotia ( 
11 
) has demonstrated stable incidence in children 
and decreased incidence in adults. Th
 ese disparities may be due to 
diff
 erences in methodology ( 
13 
), or due to true variation. In addi-
tion, single-province studies may not be powered to demonstrate 
trends in age groups where IBD is rare, such as those with disease 
onset prior to the age of 10 years.
 
Th
 e Canadian Gastro-Intestinal Epidemiology Consortium 
(CanGIEC) was formed to provide national-level information 
using distributed network analysis of multiple Canadian provin-
cial health administrative data, reducing heterogeneity of methods 
and improving power for smaller populations or uncommon out-
comes. Th
 e aim of this study was to determine trends in incidence 
and prevalence of childhood-onset IBD in Canada to determine 
the burden of IBD in Canadian children.
 
METHODS
 
Study design and setting
 
Th
 is study was approved by the research ethics boards of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, the Ottawa Hospital, Univer-
sity of Manitoba, Dalhousie University, Conjoint Health Research 
Ethics Board of the University of Calgary, and the Montreal Jewish 
General Hospital. In addition, this study was reviewed for privacy 
concerns by Manitoba Health’s Health Information Privacy Com-
mittee, the Privacy Offi
  cer of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative 
Sciences (ICES), and the Comission d’acces a l’information du 
Quebec (CAI). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 
the provincial health administrative and population databases 
from fi
 ve Canadian provinces: Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, 
Ontario, and Quebec. Th
 ese databases contain records of all legal 
residents of each province, representing a source population of 
26,530,074 people, 79.2% of the Canadian population ( 
14 
).
 
 
CanGIEC conducted a distributed network analysis in which the 
same methodology was applied to each Canadian province’s health 
administrative data to produce standardized estimates of inci-
dence and prevalence in each province. In addition, we determined 
trends over time by age group: overall (6 months to 15.9 years (y) 
at diagnosis), and in sub-groups: 6 months to 4y, 5–9y, 10–13y, and 
14–15.9y at diagnosis or at the time of the point prevalence esti-
mate. Standardized estimates and trends were then combined by 
meta-analysis using random-eff
 ects models analysis to account for 
heterogeneity. Th
 is method has been used previously to conduct 
observational pharmaco-epidemiology research in Canada and 
the United Kingdom ( 
15 
).
 
Population
 
To create the cohort, we identifi
 ed all children <16y at the time of 
IBD diagnosis in each province. For incident cases, we excluded 
people with discontinuous health care coverage within the prov-
ince, such as those who left
  a province and then returned. Inci-
dent cases diagnosed <6 months old were also excluded due to 
the risk of misclassifi
 cation with allergic or other non-IBD causes 
of enterocolitis. We used validated algorithms to identify persons 
with IBD for the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario 
( 
7,16,17 
). Th
 ese algorithms (see  
Supplementary Table 1 
) online 
consisted of combinations of outpatient, hospitalization and pro-
cedural codes to accurately distinguish IBD cases from the rest of 
the population, and have all been validated as the most accurate 
identifi
 cation method for the province in which they were applied. 
Th
 e Ontario algorithm was validated and found to be accurate in 
a population of children with and without IBD from academic 
and community practices, treated by pediatric gastroenterolo-
gists, adult gastroenterologists, and primary care providers ( 
7 
). 
Th
 e Manitoba algorithm was also validated using a random sam-
ple chart review from across the province. Although most pedi-
atric patients with IBD were treated in a single-academic center 
in Winnipeg, the algorithm identifi
 ed 95% of those patients ( 
17 
). 
Th
 e Alberta algorithm was validated using a reference standard 
derived from endoscopy reports from the Calgary Health Region 
and Capital Health Region and included both academic and com-
munity practices ( 
16 
). Of note, Quebec cases were identifi
 ed using 
a modifi
 ed version of the Alberta algorithm ( 
12 
), and Nova Scotia 
cases were identifi
 ed using the Ontario pediatric algorithm ( 
7 
). To 
ensure that the lack of validated algorithms in Quebec and Nova 
Scotia had not altered study conclusions, we conducted a sensitiv-
ity analysis without these provinces included.
 
Th
 e date of diagnosis was defi
 ned as the date of the fi
 rst health 
care contact (either outpatient or hospitalization) within the iden-
tifi
 cation algorithm with associated International Classifi
 cation 
of Disease (ICD), ninth-revision (ICD-9) or ICD, tenth revision 
(ICD-10) for Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC): 555.x, 
556.x, K50.x, or K51.x. For the incident estimates in all provinces, 
we applied validated look-back and look-forward qualifi
 cation 
periods. Th
 e 3-year look-back period has been demonstrated to

successfully diff
 erentiate incident from prevalent cases in 95% of 
Ontario children ( 
7 
). A look-back period was not applied in cases 
where full administrative data was available from birth. In order 
to qualify as an IBD case, we allowed for the combination of codes 
to occur within a 3-year interval, which has also been validated as 
adequate in Ontario children ( 
7 
). Using these look-back and quali-
fi
 cation periods, we created study cohorts of incidence and preva-
lence of childhood IBD from 1999–2010 in Manitoba and Ontario, 
1999–2008 for Alberta and Quebec, and 2000–2008 for Nova 
Scotia. Complete details on data holdings and data availability for 
this study are presented in  
 
Supplementary Table 1 
.
 
In children with IBD, validated algorithms were used to clas-
sify them as CD, UC, or IBD type unclassifi
 able (i.e., cases for 
whom the algorithm could not distinguish CD or UC classifi
 -
cation; see  
Supplementary Table 1 
). Disease classifi
 cation was 
provided for both the initial diagnosis (grouping of diagnostic 
codes associated with health care contacts immediately aft
 er the 
date of diagnosis) and latest diagnosis (most recent grouping of 
health care contacts available for each case). For the purposes of 
incidence and prevalence estimates, the latest diagnosis was used 
to refl
 ect the treating physicians’ best assessment of disease clas-
sifi
 cation at the end of the study period. Th
 erefore, if a subject’s 
diagnosis changed from UC to CD, they were counted as CD for 
the incidence and prevalence estimates and for the calculation of 
time trends.
 
Data sources
 
Health administrative data from all provinces consisted of out-
patient physician billing records, and hospitalization records. 
Th
 e databases used to identify cases were described in detail in 
the studies describing validation of the identifi
 cation algorithms 
( 
7,16,17 
). In the case of all fi
 ve provinces, a record of the full IBD 
population was available to investigators for analysis. In Ontario 
and Nova Scotia, the full non-IBD population of the province 
was available to investigators. However, in Alberta, Manitoba, 
and Quebec general population estimates from the 2001 and 
2006 Canadian censuses were used to determine the denomina-
tor of incidence and prevalence rates, and to calculate inter-censal 
population estimates.
 
Statistical analysis
 
Descriptive statistics were reported as medians with interquar-
tile range (IQR), or proportions where appropriate. Sex- and 
age-standardized annual prevalence and incidence per 100,000 
population were determined for each province for the fi
 scal 
years (1 April to 31 March) in which data was available, with 
corresponding 95% confi
 dence intervals (CI) based on Gamma 
distribution ( 
18 
). Yearly and overall rates for the age groups (6 
months to 4y, 5–9.9y, 10–13.9y, 14–15.9y) were standardized by 
sex only, with standard populations consisting of at-risk people 
within the appropriate age group. Trends in incidence over time 
were reported as an annual percentage change (APC) over the 
study period by exponentiating the beta coeffi
  cient of the sex-
adjusted Poisson regression and subtracting it by one (exp(β 
)-1). 
Th
 is Poisson model was also used to assess statistical signifi
 cance 
in trends in incidence over time, stratifi
 ed by age category with 
age-appropriate denominator populations. An APC is statistically 
signifi
 cant when its 95% CI does not cross zero. Analyses were 
conducted using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
 
Meta-analysis using random-eff
 ects models was used to produce 
national estimates of incidence and prevalence. Incidence and 
prevalence estimates with 95% CIs were reported for each year, 
and for the overall study period. We assessed trends in incidence 
and prevalence over time, stratifi
 ed by age groups, by meta-ana-
lyzing the APC for each province using random-eff
 ects models. 
Only standardized estimates were included in meta-analyses ( 
19 
). 
Heterogeneity was calculated using the  
I 
2 statistic and Cochrane 
 
χ 
2 
 test ( 
Q 
-test), which describe the percentage of total variation 
across incidence estimates due to heterogeneity rather than chance. 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine APC in incidence 
and prevalence excluding provinces without a validated algorithm 
(Quebec and Nova Scotia). Meta-analyses were conducted with 
STATA statistical soft
 ware version 11 (STATA Corp, College Sta-
tion, TX, USA).
 
RESULTS
 
Descriptive characteristics
 
A total of 5,214 incident cases and 6,554 prevalent cases were 
included in the study population. Th
 e study cohorts are described 
in  
Table 1 
. For the incidence cohort, the characteristics of the 
populations in each province were similar. One exception was 
the greater predominance of CD in Quebec compared to other 
provinces for initial diagnosis (86.4 vs. 57.7%). Similar results 
were seen for latest diagnosis (88.5 vs. 59.1%) Th
 e median age at 
diagnosis (for overall cohort: 12.3y, IQR 10.5–14.1) and sex dis-
tribution (females 43.3%) was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between 
provinces. Th
 e sex distribution was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent 
between age groups, with a male majority present in all pediatric 
age groups ( 
Supplementary Table 2 
).
 
Incidence
 
 
For the full study period, the overall standardized incidence for all 
provinces was 9.7 (95% CI 9.1–10.2) per 100,000. Th
 e incidence by 
province is demonstrated in  
Table 2 
 and  
Figure 1a 
. Th
 e incidence 
of IBD in all years was lowest for Manitoba (7.2 per 100,000) and 
highest in Nova Scotia (15.2 per 100,000), with signifi
 cant het-
erogeneity amongst provinces ( 
I 
2 76.3%,  
P 
<0.001). Similar vari-
ation across provinces was present for CD (overall incidence 6.5 
per 100,000) and UC (overall incidence 2.4 per 100,000). For CD, 
both Nova Scotia (9.3 per 100,000) and Quebec (8.8 per 100,000) 
had higher incidence compared to other provinces. Quebec had 
a lower incidence of UC compared to other provinces (1.0 per 
100,000).
 
Th
 e incidence of IBD over the study period is demonstrated in 
 
Figure 2 
. Overall incidence per 100,000 children changed from 7.9 
(95% CI 6.4 to 9.4) in 1999 to 10.6 (95% CI 8.5 to 12.6) in 2008, the 
fi
 nal year that all provinces could contribute data. In 2010, when 
only Ontario and Manitoba could provide data, the combined 
incidence was 9.0 (95% CI 4.4 to 13.5) per 100,000. Change in

incidence over time is demonstrated in  
Figure 3 
, with graphical 
representation on a map in  
Figure 4a 
. For children <16y, the inci-
dence increased over time in Ontario (APC +5.8%, 95% CI +4.6 
to +7.0%) and Quebec (APC +2.8%; 95% CI +0.9 to +4.7%). Inci-
dence did not change over time in Alberta (APC +1.5%, 95% CI 
−1.2 to +4.2%), Manitoba (APC −1.4%, 95% CI −5.2 to +2.4%), 
or Nova Scotia (APC −0.8%, 95% CI −5.8 to +4.2%). Overall, the 
combined incidence rate was stable (APC +2.1%; 95% CI −0.06 to 
+4.8%). Signifi
 cant heterogeneity was observed between provinces 
in APCs over time ( 
I 
2 84.3%,  
P 
<0.001). Incidence rates were also 
stable over time when IBD was stratifi
 ed into CD (APC +1.7%; 
95% CI −1.0 to +4.4%) and UC (APC +1.7%; −3.8% to +7.1%). Th
 e 
only age group with statistically signifi
 cant increased incidence 
was children 6 month to 5y (APC +7.2%; 95% CI +2.8 to 11.6%). 
In this youngest group, incidence did not rise signifi
 cantly when 
stratifi
 ed by CD (APC +3.2%; 95% CI −3.2 to +9.7%) and UC 
(APC +5.5%; 95% CI −0.3% to +11.4%). Of note, signifi
 cant het-
erogeneity was not present amongst provinces for this age group 
(IBD:  
I 
2 9.5%,  
P 
=0.35; CD:  
I 
2 0.0%,  
P 
=0.84; UC:  
I 
2 0.0%,  
P 
=0.50). 
Due to the rarity of cases of children <5y, the rate change models 
did not converge for Manitoba in calculation of IBD trends, nor 
for Manitoba and Nova Scotia in calculation of CD and UC trends.
 
Results of the sensitivity analysis excluding Nova Scotia and 
Quebec are presented in  
Supplementary Figure 1 
. Excluding 
provinces without validated identifi
 cation algorithms did not sig-
nifi
 cantly alter APC of incidence.
 
Prevalence
 
 
Based on meta-analysis, the standardized period prevalence for all 
provinces was 38.2 (95% CI 35.8 to 40.7) per 100,000 children. Th
 e 
prevalence by province is demonstrated in

with IBD every year, and 2,695 children under 16y were living 
with IBD in Canada in 2008.
 
Th
 e high incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD in Can-
ada has been demonstrated in previous single-province stud-
ies ( 
9,12,20 
). In our study, the incidence of IBD in children was 
amongst the highest in the world which is consistent with the only 
previous multi-province Canadian study ( 
21 
). A previous system-
atic review which included studies published before 2010 demon-
strated that only Norway had similar incidence, 10.6 per 100,000 
children <16y ( 
22 
). More recently, a study from Stockholm County, 
Sweden reported an incidence of 12.8 per 100,000 in children <16y 
between 2002–2007, signifi
 cantly increased from previous reports 
from the same region ( 
23 
). By contrast, incidence estimates from 
other regions of Europe and the United States were signifi
 cantly 
lower ( 
1 
). Th
 e reasons for the higher rates in children from Canada 
and Northern Europe are not known. Lack of sunlight exposure 
and high rates of vitamin D defi
 ciency, antibiotic use, diet, and 
migration patterns have been hypothesized as contributors ( 
4,24 
). 
Th
 e interaction between environmental risk factors, the intestinal 
microbiome, and genetic predisposition are important areas under 
investigation. Th
 is trend of increased incidence in the northern 
latitude has also been demonstrated in the United States ( 
25 
). Even 
amongst northern states, incidence may be increasing. A recent 
population-based study from Rhode Island demonstrated a much 
higher incidence of IBD in children and adults ( 
26 
) compared 
with older estimates from Wisconsin ( 
27 
) and Minnesota ( 
28 
). It 
remains to be seen whether American states at northern latitudes 
will develop a similarly high incidence of pediatric IBD noted in 
Canada over the past two decades.
 
Th
 e incidence of pediatric IBD was stable during the study period, 
with the exception of incidence in children under 5 years old. 
Th
 e rise in the incidence of very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) ( 
29 
) 
national point prevalence was 46.2 (95% CI 34.6 to 57.8) per 
100,000, signifi
 cantly increased from the prevalence in 2000 of 
33.2 (95% CI 26.6 to 39.8) per 100,000. Overall, the prevalence for 
CD was 25.5 (95% CI 22.8 to 28.1) per 100,000. For UC, preva-
lence was 10.7 (95% CI 9.8 to 11.6) per 100,000.  
Figure 5 dem-
onstrates prevalence by province between 1999 and 2008. Time 
trends analysis demonstrated statistically signifi
 cantly increased 
prevalence in all age groups, except adolescents aged 14–15.9y 
( 
Figure 6 
). Overall, IBD prevalence increased by 4.6% (95% CI 
3.7 to 5.4%) per year, CD prevalence increased by 3.9% (95% 
CI 1.9 to 5.9%) per year, and UC prevalence increased by 4.4% 
(95% CI 1.8 to 6.9%) per year ( 
Figure 4b 
). Results of the sensitiv-
ity analysis excluding Nova Scotia and Quebec are presented in 
 
Supplementary Figure 2 
. Excluding provinces without validated 
identifi
 cation algorithms did not signifi
 cantly alter APC of preva-
lence.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Using a distributed network methodology applied to fi
 ve Cana-
dian population-based health administrative databases, we 
confi
 rmed that Canada has amongst the highest incidence and 
prevalence of childhood-onset IBD in the world. As previously 
reported, the predominant form of pediatric-onset IBD is CD, 
with more boys than girls aff
 ected. Th
 e incidence of childhood-
onset IBD was stable during the fi
 rst decade of the twenty-fi
 rst 
century, with the exception of rising incidence among children 
diagnosed under the age of 5y. Finally, we noted signifi
 cant het-
erogeneity in both incidence and trends over time amongst prov-
inces despite use of standardized analysis, indicating signifi
 cant 
regional variation. Extrapolating our results to the entire country, 
we estimate that approximately 600–650 children are diagnosed

in our study population was consistent across all provinces as evi-
dence by the lack of statistical heterogeneity between provinces. 
Th
 e rapid increase in VEO-IBD was previously noted in Ontario 
( 
8 
). Th
 is multi-province study demonstrated that incidence was 
rising by ~7% per year in that age group, with little heterogene-
ity amongst provinces. Th
 is fi
 nding may also explain the obser-
vation of increased prevalence of children <16y living with IBD, 
since these VEO-IBD cases would remain in the cohort for longer.

Epidemiology of Pediatric IBD in Canada
played a role in the observed increased incidence ( 
4 
). Th
 e associa-
tion between early-life environmental factors and childhood-onset 
IBD was particularly noted in studies demonstrating increased risk 
due to early-life antibiotic ( 
31 
) and air pollution exposure ( 
32 
). 
However, changes in health services factors may also have resulted 
in increased recognition in young children. Whereas all studies 
relying on administrative database are subject to misclassifi
 ca-
tion errors on the study population, this bias is less likely in chil-
dren under the age of 5 years because a previous validation study 
showed that only 1% of children diagnosed <6y did not have any 
health services contacts with associated IBD diagnoses at the end 
of a mean 9y follow-up period ( 
8 
). Th
 is means that most children 
initially labeled IBD continued to be treated as IBD years later.
 
Th
 ere was signifi
 cant heterogeneity in estimates of incidence, 
prevalence, and trends over time for those diagnosed above 5y old, 
indicating variation between provinces. In particular, we noted 
that Nova Scotia demonstrated signifi
 cantly higher incidence and 
prevalence of IBD compared with other provinces. In addition, 
Quebec demonstrated a much greater proportion of IBD patients 
being classifi
 ed as having CD compared with UC. Both of these 
fi
 ndings were demonstrated in other adult-focused cohort studies, 
and remain unexplained ( 
12,21 
). Diff
 erent genetic backgrounds 
may play a role. Quebec is primarily comprised of a unique French 
Canadian (Quebecois) population with a distinct phenotype ( 
33 
). 
Nova Scotia is comprised of 31% of people of Scottish origin and 
28% of people from other British Isles (compared to 15 and 20%, 
respectively, in all Canadians) ( 
34 
), and Scotland has been noted 
to have a higher incidence of pediatric IBD than the rest of the 
United Kingdom ( 
35 
). Finally, Ontario and Quebec have larger 
immigrant populations than other provinces, and Manitoba has a 
higher First Nations population than other provinces. Immigrants 
and First Nations people have been demonstrated to have lower 
rates of IBD than other Canadians ( 
36–38 
). Finally, the diff
 erences 
in incidence observed amongst provinces may be related to access 
to health services. If families from Nova Scotia are more likely to 
seek medical attention for their children, this would explain the 
higher incidence observed. Of note, pediatric asthma prevalence 
was also reported to be higher in Nova Scotia than other provinces 
( 
39 
). Future research will examine the issue of access and variation 
of care of children with IBD in Canada.
 
Th
 e rising incidence of VEO-IBD, and particularly in children 
under 5 years has important clinical implications. Children with 
onset of disease at younger ages have been demonstrated to have 
lower rates of hospitalization, emergency department utilization 
and surgical resection ( 
8,40–42 
). However, these patients will live 
longer with the disease and research regarding long-term outcomes 
is lacking. In addition, young children present more frequently 
with isolated colonic disease, with a change to a more ileo-colonic 
phenotype in children presenting between 6–9 years old ( 
40,42 
). 
Th
 erefore, it is much more diffi
  cult to determine IBD sub-type in 
children under 6 years presenting with colitis, which may impact 
medication choice, and the decision on whether to proceed to 
colectomy in patients failing medical management. Finally, the 
psycho-social impact on the family of caring for a young child with 
a chronic illness is signifi
 cant. Th
 is may be refl
 ected in the need for 
age-appropriate educational material, decisions regarding medical 
or dietary therapy, when to proceed to surgery, frequent school 
absences for the child, or parental absences from work. Th
 ese issues 
may be best addressed in centers off
 ering multi-disciplinary care 
such as support from a psychologist, social worker, dietitian, and 
specialized nurse. In light of these unique challenges in very young 
children with IBD, we recommend that these patients be treated by 
specialized pediatricians with expertise in multi-disciplinary IBD 
care. In addition, we would suggest that the Paris classifi

Limitations
 
Misclassifi
 cation bias can always aff
 ect research using routinely 
collected health data ( 
43 
), and the heterogeneity observed 
amongst provincial results may have been due to the use of dif-
ferent algorithms to identify IBD patients in each province. We 
used the most accurate identifi
 cation and classifi
 cation algorithms 
for each specifi
 c province to reduce the risk of misclassifi
 cation 
error, and the algorithms used were validated in the provinces to 
which they were applied (for Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario). 
In contrast, Nova Scotia and Quebec applied non-validated cod-
ing algorithms and were the provinces with the most inconsistent 
fi
 ndings. A sensitivity analysis that included only provinces that 
identifi
 ed patients with locally validated algorithms did not dem-
onstrate diff
 erent fi
 ndings. Nonetheless, no administrative data 
algorithm is completely accurate, and diff
 erential accuracies may 
have resulted in the appearance of heterogeneity. Future work will 
continue to develop and validate algorithms to identify patients 
with IBD, and to identify the causes of the variation seen across 
Canadian provinces.
 
Th
 is study was also limited by the time periods of data availabil-
ity, and particularly by the requirement for look-back and look-
forward periods to diff
 erentiate incident from prevalent cases. 
While use of these validated periods ensured accurate estimates 
of incidence, we were unable to determine trends in incidence 
prior to or aft
 er the study period. In addition, our analysis was able 
to determine overall ecological trends in IBD epidemiology, but 
not the reasons for the observed changes. Future research should 
determine whether changing environmental risk factors, new 
gene-environment interactions and/or alterations to the health 
system resulted in the changing rates.
 
CONCLUSIONS
 
In summary, we have demonstrated that Canada has amongst 
the highest rates of childhood-onset IBD in the world. While 
the incidence of IBD has stabilized in children over the age of 
5 years, the incidence is rising rapidly in children under 5 years 
old. Th
 ese fi
 ndings have important implications on the children, 
their families, and the health care system, because these children 
will live longer with the disease, have a more extensive disease 
phenotype, and result in higher direct costs for IBD care com-
pared with adults ( 
6,44 
). In addition, the increasingly early age of 
onset implies early-life environmental triggers in at-risk patients. 
Since young children are exposed to fewer environmental triggers 
in the course of their short lives, future research should focus on 
identifi
 cation of triggers in children with IBD, understanding the 
biology behind changes resulting in disease, and intervention to 
prevent the occurrence of IBD in this vulnerable age group.

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
 
The incidence of pediatric infl
 ammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) is rising internationally. 
 
✓ 
 
 
Very Early Onset (VEO) IBD is a newly recognized distinct 
entity with unique causes, clinical presentation, and 
outcomes. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
 
Canada has amongst the highest rates of pediatric IBD 
in the world, and there are differences in incidence and 
prevalence between Canadian provinces. 
 
✓ 
 
 
The incidence of VEO IBD (diagnosis <5 years old) has 
increased by 7.2% per year between 1999–2010. 
 
✓ 
 
 
The incidence of pediatric IBD in other age groups is 
rising in some provinces, but the overall incidence not 
signifi
 cantly changed in Canada between 1999–2010.
