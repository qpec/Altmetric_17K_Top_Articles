Abstract
Background
There is increasing evidence that lower maternal stature is associated with shorter gesta-
tional length in the offspring. We examined the association between maternal height and
the likelihood of delivering preterm babies in a large and homogeneous cohort of Swedish
women.
Methods
This study covers antenatal data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register on 192,432
women (aged 26.0 years on average) born at term, from singleton pregnancies, and of Nor-
dic ethnicity. Continuous associations between women's heights and the likelihood of pre-
term birth in the offspring were evaluated. Stratified analyses were also carried out,
separating women into different height categories.
Results
Every cm decrease in maternal stature was associated with 0.2 days shortening of gesta-
tional age in the offspring (p<0.0001) and increasing odds of having a child born preterm
(OR 1.03), very preterm (OR 1.03), or extremely preterm (OR 1.04). Besides, odds of all cat-
egories of preterm birth were highest among the shortest women but lowest among the tal-
lest mothers. Specifically, women of short stature (�155 cm or �-2.0 SDS below the
population mean) had greater odds of having preterm (OR 1.65) or very preterm (OR 1.47)
infants than women of average stature (-0.5 to 0.5 SDS). When compared to women of tall
stature (�179 cm), mothers of short stature had even greater odds of giving birth to preterm
(OR 2.07) or very preterm (OR 2.16) infants.
Conclusions
Among Swedish women, decreasing height was associated with a progressive increase in
the odds of having an infant born preterm. Maternal short stature is a likely contributing fac-
tor to idiopathic preterm births worldwide, possibly due to maternal anatomical constraints.

 Introduction
Preterm birth is not only a major cause of neonatal mortality worldwide, but it is also associ-
ated with adverse short- and long-term health outcomes [1]. Approximately half of all preterm
births are idiopathic or spontaneous, whose causes are multifactorial and often unknown [1,2].
However, maternal height may be a contributing factor. There is increasing evidence that lower
maternal stature is associated with shorter gestational length in the offspring [3–6], including
evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis [7]. As a result, short mothers are more
likely to deliver preterm babies [4,5,7].
It is not easy to dissect the influence of maternal height on length of gestation, since the lat-
ter may be affected by a number of factors such as ethnicity [2], maternal gestational age [8],
and maternal obesity [9]. Thus, in this study we examined the association between maternal
height and the likelihood of delivering preterm babies in a large and relatively homogeneous
cohort of Swedish women.
Methods
We examined Swedish Medical Birth Register data, from the first antenatal visit on all singleton
Swedish women aged �18 years who were born at term (37–41 weeks of gestation) and gave
birth in 1991–2009. For women with two or more pregnancies in the study period, data were
only included for the first recorded pregnancy. Women were excluded if they were of non-Nor-
dic ethnicity, of very short stature (�130 cm), born outside the term range or small-for-gesta-
tional-age [SGA; <-2 standard deviation scores (SDS) in birth length or birth weight], or born
with congenital malformations (ICD-9 740–759 and ICD-10 Q0–Q99). The occurrence of a
previous preterm pregnancy was not accounted for. Height was recorded to the nearest cm, but
it was self-reported in some cases. Gestational age of the women at their birth was mostly esti-
mated from the date of the last menstrual period, otherwise estimates were based on ultrasound
scans.
Relevant data (i.e. gestational age and birth weight) were also obtained on all offspring (with
no exclusions) from the Birth Register. Offspring gestational age was based on ultrasound
examination in the second trimester.
A continuous association between maternal height and gestational age in the offspring was
evaluated using general linear regression models, adjusting for maternal factors (age, maternal
gestational age, BMI, and smoking during pregnancy), as well as infant sex. Logistic regression
models (adjusting for above confounders) were run to evaluate likelihood of having an infant
born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation), very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation), or extremely
preterm (<28 weeks of gestation). Stratified analyses were also carried out, dividing the women
into groups according to height SDS based on the study population mean. In particular, short
stature (�155 cm) was defined as height �-2 SDS (below the study population mean) and tall
stature as �2 SDS (�179 cm). Analyses were performed in SAS v.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
USA). Where applicable, results are expressed as odds ratios (OR) or ß coefficients, with associ-
ated 95% confidence intervals (CI).
This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala.
Results
There were 303,301 women born in 1973–1988 in Sweden who gave birth in 1991–2009.
Anthropometric data were available on 268,208 women, but 75,776 failed to meet inclusion cri-
teria (i.e. women born outside the term range, SGA or with malformation, aged <18 years,
being of non-Nordic ethnicity, or born from multiple pregnancies). Thus, this study covers

 data on 192,432 women and their newborns, whose demographic characteristics are shown in
Table 1.
Decreasing maternal stature was associated with lower gestational age in the offspring [ß =
0.022 (95% CI 0.020, 0.023); p<0.0001], so that every cm decrease in maternal height was asso-
ciated with 0.2 days shortening of pregnancy length. Thus, the shorter the mother was (in cm),
the greater were the odds of having a child born preterm (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.03, 1.03), very pre-
term (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.02, 1.04), or extremely preterm (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02, 1.06).
Stratified analyses showed a progressive decline in the prevalence of infants born preterm,
very preterm, or extremely preterm with increasing stature across height groups (Table 2).
Thus, odds of any form of preterm birth were highest for the shortest women but lowest
among the tallest women (Fig 1).
Specifically, women with short stature had greater odds of preterm (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.47,
1.84) or very preterm (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.07, 2.01) births than women of average stature (-0.5
to 0.5 SDS) (Fig 1). When compared to women of tall stature, mothers of short stature had
even greater odds of giving birth to preterm (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.76, 2.44) or very preterm (OR
2.16; 95% CI 1.33, 3.50) infants.
Discussion
Among Swedish women, decreasing height was associated with a progressive increase in the
odds of having an infant born preterm. As a result, the odds of having a child born preterm or
very preterm were highest for women of short stature but lowest among the tallest women.
One of the strengths of this study was the fact that height was assessed in women within a
relatively narrow age range, so that the possible confounding effects of height reduction with
age [10] were minimized. In addition, we studied a relatively homogeneous population (e.g. all
Nordic women born at term), which allowed us to more accurately evaluate the associations
between maternal anthropometry and birth outcomes. However, as Swedish women are rela-
tively tall, our findings cannot be readily extrapolated to other female populations of much
shorter average height, such as those in Latin American or Asia [11]. Nonetheless, the same
pattern of a progressive increase in odds of preterm births with decreasing stature has been
observed amongst women from Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe [4,12,13]. A study in
New Zealand (87% Caucasian women) also observed that the risk of spontaneous preterm
birth after pre-labour rupture of membranes decreased by 7% for every cm increase in maternal

 height [14]. The authors noted however, that no association was observed between maternal
height and spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This level of detail could not be
examined in our cohort as we did not have data on the aetiology of individual preterm births,
which is the main limitation of our study. Nonetheless, our results and those from previous
studies [4,12,14,15] indicate that the risk of having an infant born preterm is greatest in the
shortest women within any given population or ethnicity. Further, another large study using
data from the Swedish Birth Register showed that short mothers (<160 cm) had substantially
increased risk of having an SGA infant [16].
Ozaltin et al. previously discussed possible mechanisms underpinning the association
between maternal height and adverse outcomes in the offspring, including socioeconomic fac-
tors, under-nutrition in utero, and maternal anatomical constraints [17]. Although socioeco-
nomic conditions and under-nutrition could be responsible in part for observed associations in
low- to middle-income countries, they would be unlikely to be an important factor in the com-
paratively well-resourced Swedish population (even though there were no socioeconomic data
collected on the women, which is a limitation of our study). Patel et al. speculated that the
shorter gestational length in certain ethnic groups may be an evolutionary adaptation to
smaller maternal pelvic size [18]. It has also been suggested that women of lower stature would
have a shorter cervical length, but one study suggested that this is not the case [19]. Unfortu-
nately, we did not have data on cervical length for our study population in order to address this
question. Nonetheless, in a recent study using data on genome-wide single nucleotide polymor-
phism from Finland, Norway, and Denmark, Zhang et al. concluded that "the effect of maternal
height on gestational age was transmitted through phenotypic causal mechanism rather than
genetic inheritance" [13]. As a result, the evidence suggests that anatomical constraints are
more likely to explain the effects of maternal height on pregnancy length. Further support for
the anatomical explanation was the lack of effect of paternal height on gestational length that
we [3] and others have observed [5]. However, it is important to note that the anatomical con-
straints hypothesis would likely apply only to spontaneous or idiopathic preterm deliveries.
Another limitation of this study was that height for a minority but unknown number of
women was self-reported and not measured. It seems that adult women tend to overestimate
their own height [20], with a Swedish study on older adults (mean age 63.9 years) indicating
that height was overestimated by 0.9 to 1.2 cm [21]. Thus, it is possible that the effects of short
stature on pregnancy length might have been slightly under-estimated in our study. In addi-
tion, the association of maternal stature with the risk of preterm delivery was not adjusted for
other conditions associated with a higher risk of prematurity, such as polyhydramnios, short
cervical length, cervical conization, and cervical incompetence. Lastly, there is a margin of

 error associated with the estimation of gestational length by ultrasound scans or the last men-
strual period [22], so that some infants and mothers would likely have been misclassified into
the wrong gestational age category. However, the possible effects of such misclassifications
would likely have been minimized in our large cohort.
In conclusion, our study on a large and homogeneous cohort of Swedish women provides
strong evidence of a progressive association between decreasing maternal height and increased
likelihood of having a child born preterm. These data corroborate the evidence from a number
of previous studies [3–5,12–15] and suggest that maternal short stature may be a contributing
factor to a number of spontaneous preterm births worldwide [4]. Based on this accumulating
evidence, maternal height is one of the factors that need to be considered when evaluating a
woman's risk of preterm delivery.
