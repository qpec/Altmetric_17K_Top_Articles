ABSTRACT
Background People’s intentions to use vaccines are influenced by their beliefs about both the specific vaccine and the disease it prevents. In
the absence of firm beliefs about Zika virus (ZIKV), individuals may base their intentions to vaccinate against it on beliefs about other vaccines,
and specifically the misbelief that MMR causes autism.
Methods A survey of 3337 Americans, using a random-digit-dialing sample of landline telephone households and cell-phones.
Results Intentions to use a Zika vaccine were influenced by beliefs about Zika, science in general, and MMR. Intentions were positively
influenced by perceived severity of and vulnerability to Zika, as well as belief in science’s efficacy. However, intentions were negatively
influenced by the belief that MMR causes autism in children.
Conclusion The misbelief about MMR and autism may reduce people’s intentions to use a new Zika vaccine. However, perceptions of severity
of and vulnerability to Zika may increase intentions. Implications for science educators and public health officials are discussed.

Introduction
When deciding whether to vaccinate, people weigh the
potential risks tied to both the vaccine and the disease. The
risks associated with Zika are consequential. The fetus of an
infected mother bears an increased risk of birth defects
including microcephaly.1–3 Moreover, in adults, Zika is asso-
ciated, albeit rarely, with Guillain-Barré syndrome.4–6 As of
February 2018, there had been 228 cases of presumed local
mosquito-borne transmissions within the United States, and a
total of 5658 cases (with the majority of cases the result of tra-
velers returning from affected areas). Overall, 37175 additional
cases had been reported in US territories, a figure largely attrib-
utable to widespread exposure in Puerto Rico.7
In August 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
announced the launch of a Phase 1 clinical trial of a DNA-
based vaccine.8 The second phase of the trial of that vaccine
was announced on 31 March 2017.9 Understanding the condi-
tions that inhibit or increase acceptance of such a new vaccine
should be a public health imperative. In the absence of a realistic
understanding of the risks of Zika and the benefits and risks of
a Zika vaccine, people may import into the decision process
their beliefs or misbeliefs about other vaccines. Using a phone-
based survey (n = 3337), this study examines the factors affecting
people’s intentions to get a Zika vaccine, including the misbelief
about an association between the Measles, Mumps and Rubella
(MMR) vaccine and autism, and discusses implications for pub-
lic health practitioners and communicators.
From beliefs about vaccines to behavior—
a reasoned action approach
Despite incontrovertible benefits,10 vaccinations have been the
subject of misinformation about alleged risks.11,12 Resulting

 misbeliefs can attenuate vaccination rates, risking a resurgence
in diseases considered under control.13 One enduring decep-
tion avers that the MMR vaccine causes autism.14 The bogus
association was convincingly debunked in research studies,15
and the original paper by Wakefield and colleagues was
exposed as biased, error-ridden and contaminated by unethical
practices. Subsequently, Wakefield’s British medical license was
revoked and the paper retracted.16–18 Nevertheless, many con-
tinue to embrace the discredited association.19 A 2014 Harris
online Poll of 1756 US adults found that 33% of parents of
children under the age of 18, and 29% of adults reported
believing that ‘vaccinations can cause autism’.20 A 2015 survey
of 1000 US adults by YouGov, found 21% of young adults
accepting the notion that vaccines cause autism; 13% of all US
adults agreed.21
MMR misbeliefs correlate with reduced intentions to vac-
cinate children,22 a relationship forecast by the model under-
lying the Theory of Reasoned Action, TRA.23,24 In this
theory the strongest predictor of volitional behavior is
behavioral intentions,25 resulting from beliefs, attitudes and
norms, and in later models, perceived control26. The model
is empirically supported.27,28 Like other theories of health
decision making, such as the Health Belief Model29 and the
Protection Motivation Theory,30 TRA predicts relationships
between specific, and not general, constructs.31 For example,
more positive attitudes toward drug-abuse were found to be
correlated with actual use of drugs (r = 0.46, P < 0.01) and
to a lesser degree with alcohol use (r = 0.29, P < 0.05)32.
Similarly, a meta-analysis28 demonstrated that moderately
relevant attitudes and beliefs may influence intentions and
behaviors. Hence, we expect intentions to vaccinate
against Zika to be strongly correlated with beliefs about
Zika and its vaccine, and to a lesser degree with beliefs
about other vaccines and diseases, and other health
behaviors.28
Nevertheless, information about new diseases is often
incomplete, and individuals may form beliefs based on those
already held about familiar diseases and treatments.33
Previous Zika outbreaks did not attract much scientific or
public attention, as most cases resulted in few, if any, notice-
able symptoms or mild ones.34–38 It was only in 201537 that
the disease was found to correlate with microcephaly,1,38,39
and, in adults, with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).4,5 As
Zika vaccines are being developed and tested,40,41 the scien-
tific understanding of the nature of the virus remains incom-
plete and the public’s knowledge of what science does know
lagging. Just as attitudes toward drugs can correlate with
alcohol drinking behavior,32 intentions to use a Zika vaccine
might be influenced by extrapolations from other vaccines.25
Accordingly, we hypothesized that:
H1: The more likely a person is to believe that MMR can
cause neurological disorders such as autism, the less likely
she will be to intend to use a Zika vaccine if available.
Although less compatible with the behavior than vaccine
beliefs,25 general beliefs about science may also influence inten-
tions to use a vaccine developed by the scientific community:
H2: People who believe in science’s power to overcome
problems will be more likely to intend to use a Zika vac-
cine than will those who believe that science is less
efficacious.
Finally, since people are more likely to reject vaccines if
they believe the diseases they protect against pose little
risk12,42 and since individuals are more likely to act to pre-
vent a specific disease when they believe themselves to be
susceptible to it,29 we hypothesize that:
H3: There will be a positive correlation between people’s
intention to get a Zika vaccine, if available, and (i) their
beliefs that Zika is dangerous to themselves and to chil-
dren, and (ii) their belief that they are highly vulnerable to
infection by Zika.
Methods
Sample and survey design
Data were collected between 08/25/16 and 09/26/16 (The
data analyzed are part of a larger project, a 34-week-long
survey with updated and replaced questions that consisted
of 37193 participants. The questions relevant and needed
for the analysis were used only on some dates, limiting the
sample to 3337 participants after a listwise-deletion pro-
cess.), as part of a national US survey about Zika. Samples
were drawn to represent the adult US population (SSRS
Omnibus surveys insert weights to provide nationally repre-
sentative and projectable estimates of the adult population,
18 years and older. As is often the case in large-scale sur-
veys, some variables may still vary somewhat from census
data. In our case, education is skewed a bit towards higher
levels. We control for that by using demographic variables in
the regression model. We do not, however, use weights in
the regression model itself, as unweighted OLS estimates are
considered unbiased and consistent, and have smaller stand-
ard errors compared to weighted OLS estimates. For more
on that decision, consult Winship and Radbill.43 For a
detailed information about SSRS’s Omnibus survey, see:

 single-stage, random-digit-dialing (RDD) sample of landline
telephone households and cell-phones. Within each landline
household, a single respondent (youngest adult) was selected
and, for cell-phone respondents, interviews were conducted
with the person answering the phone. Approximately 35 inter-
views were conducted weekly in Spanish. The sample con-
sisted of 3337 people (1713 females, 2305 whites) between
the ages of 18 and 97 (M = 52.76, SD = 19.05). Response
rate was 9%. Table 1 presents more sociodemographic infor-
mation on the sample.
Measures
Due to the questionnaire’s breadth, constructs were mea-
sured using single items. Intention to vaccinate against Zika
was measured using the item ‘If there were a vaccine that
protected you from getting ZIKA how likely, if at all, is it
that you would get the vaccine?’, ranging from 1 (not likely
at all) to 4 (very likely). The misbelief about MMR was mea-
sured using the item ‘How likely do you think it is that vac-
cines given to children for diseases like measles, mumps and
rubella can cause neurological disorders like autism?’, ran-
ging from 1 (not likely at all) to 4 (very likely).
Perceived severity of Zika was measured using the items
‘How likely is it that someone who contracts the ZIKA virus
will die as a result?’, ‘How likely, if at all, is it that a baby born
with an unusually small head, as a result of ZIKA virus, will
die prematurely as a result?’, both ranging from 1 (not likely
at all) to 4 (very likely) and ‘How accurate is it to say that a
pregnant woman who is infected with the Zika virus is more
likely to have a baby with an unusually small head and brain?’,
ranging from 1 (not at all accurate) to 4 (very accurate).
Perceived vulnerability was measured using the item ‘What is
the risk that you will be infected with Zika in the next 6
months?’, ranging from 1 (no risk), to 5 (extremely high risk).
Belief in science’s efficacy was measured using an item from
Bolsen et al.:44 ‘Which comes closer to your view: science enables
us to overcome almost any problem or that science creates unin-
tended consequences and replaces older problems with new
ones?’, with three possible options (‘science enables us to over-
come almost any problem’, ‘science creates unintended conse-
quences and replaces older problems with new ones’, and
‘somewhere in between/it depends/a bit of both’).
Other covariances included the questions ‘If you planned
a trip before you knew about the ZIKA virus, how likely
would it be for you to change your travel plans if you
learned that your destination had an outbreak of the ZIKA
virus?’, ranging from 1 (not likely at all) to 4 (very likely),
‘have you gone to any source online or offline to learn more
about the ZIKA virus, or not?’ (yes/no), how likely it is to
say that mosquitoes can transmit the Zika virus to humans’,
and ‘How accurate is it to say that an individual who has been
infected by the ZIKA virus will know it because the ZIKA
virus always produces noticeable symptoms?’, ‘both ranging
from 1 (not at all accurate) to 4 (very accurate), ‘Just your best
guess, how many cases have there been in the United States in
the last 6 months in which a baby with an unusually small head
and brain has been born to a mother who had the ZIKA virus
while she was pregnant?’, and ‘In the past 3 months, have you
done anything to protect yourself from getting Zika?’ (yes/no).
Finally, three covariates measured general attitudes toward the
governmental institutions that are responsible for fighting Zika,
‘How confident, if at all, are you in the federal government’s
ability to respond effectively to an outbreak of Zika virus in the
United States?’, ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 4 (very
confident), and what ‘is your general opinion’ of the CDC, and
NIH, from 1 (very unfavorable) to 4 (very favorable).

 MMR may cause autism 2.12(1.00), both measured on 1–4
scales. The bivariate correlation between the misbelief and
intention to vaccinate was negative, small and significant
(r = −0.12, P < 0.001). Intention was higher among those
lowest on the misbelief (M = 2.70, SD = 0.16) and lowest
among those highest on the misbelief (M = 2.3, SD = 0.13).
Intentions also correlated with perceived severity, as the cor-
relation of intention with the mistaken belief that Zika is a
likely cause of death was moderately positive (r = 0.18, P <
0.001), and a smaller positive correlation was found with the
belief that Zika causes microcephaly (r = 0.10, P < 0.001).
Intentions also correlated with the perception that one is
likely to be infected in the upcoming 6 months (r = 0.18, P
< 0.001).
In order to examine the demographic characteristics of
those who believed that MMR causes autism, a multiple
regression was conducted. People aged 40–59 were more
likely to believe the misinformation than were those 18–39
(β = 0.07, P < 0.001. The difference for people older than
60 was not significant (β = 0.02, P = 0.30). Whites, the big-
gest racial group in the sample, were less likely to believe in
the misinformation than non-whites (β = −0.15, P < 0.001).
Those who were college educated (college degree or higher)
were less likely to believe in the misinformation than non-
graduates (β = −0.15, P < 0.001). People with yearly
household incomes higher than $100,000 were less likely to
believe in the misinformation than those of lower income
(β = −0.07, P < 0.001). Atheists were less likely than reli-
gious people to believe in the misinformation (β = −0.08,
P < 0.001). Finally, people who identified as Democrats
were less likely to embrace the misinformation than
Republicans (β = −0.10, P < 0.001). Gender did not pre-
dict misbeliefs. These variables explained 9% of the variance
in the misbelief. Full regression results can be seen in Table 3
in the Appendix.
Hypotheses testing
To test the hypotheses, a multiple regression was conducted.
Because no effect was found for the date of the survey, par-
ticipants were analyzed together. The model explained
20.2% of the variance (adjusted R2). H1 predicted that belief
that MMR can cause neurological disorders such as autism
will be associated with lesser intent to use a Zika vaccine.
Controlling for all other variables in the model, the effect of
the misbelief on intentions was negative, and significant (β =
−0.019, P < 0.001). The misbelief was the strongest pre-
dictor of intention not to vaccinate in the model. Thus, H1
was supported.
H2 predicted that people who believe in science’s ability
to overcome problems will be more likely to intend to use a
Zika vaccine than people who believe that science is not effi-
cacious. Controlling for all other variables in the model, the
effect of the belief in science’s efficacy on intentions was
positive and significant. On average, people who believed
that science is efficacious were more likely to intend to vac-
cinate than were those who believed the opposite (β = 0.10,
P < 0.001), or fell between the two belief extremes (β =
0.05, P < 0.001). H2 was also supported.
H3 predicted a positive correlation between vaccination
intention and (i) beliefs that Zika is dangerous, and (ii) belief
that the respondent is highly likely to be infected with Zika.
Controlling for other variables in the model, the effect of
the mistaken belief that Zika is likely to cause death (β =
0.12, P < 0.001) and the accurate belief that Zika causes
microcephaly (β = 0.05, P < 0.001) were positive and signifi-
cant. The belief that microcephaly may lead to the death of
newborns did not predict intentions and was omitted from
the final model. H3a was generally supported. The effects of
the belief that one will be infected in the next 6 months on
intention was positive and significant (β = 0.15, P < 0.001),
supporting H3b.
As for covariates, younger people (18–39) were higher on
intentions to vaccinate. than people aged 40–59 (β = 0.06,
P < 0.001) and over 60 (β = 0.04, P = 0.001). People with a
college degree (or more years of education) were less likely
than those with less than a college degree to intend to vac-
cinate (β = −0.03, P = 0.025). Democrats’ intentions were
higher on average than Republicans’ (β = 0.04, P = 0.029).
Looking for information about Zika online was associated
with increased intentions (β = 0.06, P < 0.001), as was
knowing that Zika can be acquired from mosquitoes (β =
0.05, P < 0.001). Mistakenly believing infected people always
show symptoms increased intentions (β = 0.05, P = 0.001).
Also, the more cases of microcephaly people believed were
diagnosed in the US, the higher their intentions were (β =
0.03, P = 0.021). People who reported having taken action
to reduce the risk of infection were lower on intentions (β =
−0.08, P < 0.001). Finally, general positive opinions about
the CDC (β = 0.05, P = 0.003) and NIH (β = 0.06, P =
0.001) increased intentions, as well as confidence in the gov-
ernment’s response (β = 0.05, P = 0.002). The full regression
results can be seen in Table 2 (We also tested a more parsi-
monious model with only the misblief and demographics.
Conclusions regarding the association of the misbelief and
intentions remained virtually the same. The two models can
be seen in Table 2.).

 Discussion
This study examined the effects of beliefs on intention to
use a potential Zika vaccine, and found that people’s inten-
tions increased as perceptions of severity of the disease and
personal vulnerability increased. People’s belief in science’s
efficacy also increased intentions. However, the misbelief
that MMR causes autism in children reduced intentions and
was its strongest predictor. These findings are worrisome,
but can guide future vaccination communications. On one
hand, because the effect of a decades’-old misleading argu-
ment on medical and scientific endeavors persists, MMR
misbeliefs can reduce intentions to vaccinate against Zika.
On the other hand, perceived severity of and vulnerability to
Zika may increase vaccination intentions, especially when the
risk to adults is highlighted (some perceptions, like the
lethality of Zika are inaccurate and require future correc-
tions, but others were correct).
Interestingly, individuals who engaged in behaviors that
protect against Zika infection were lower on vaccination
intentions. This may be the result of their confidence that
their actions pre-empt the need to be vaccinated. Those
communicating about the vaccine should consider explaining
its effectiveness above and beyond individual actions. These
potential interventions are consistent with theories of health
behavior and decision making, that predict that perception
that a threat is severe and the respondent vulnerable increases
the likelihood of responsive action.
This study has both practical and theoretical implications.
As the Zika vaccine is being developed, health communica-
tors will soon need not only to cope with vaccine hesitancy
and anti-vaccination communications but also with the other
challenges involved in delivering vaccinations to vulnerable
populations. Building on prior research and theories about
health decision making, this study emphasizes the import-
ance of risk perceptions, including severity and susceptibility.
To scholarship supporting the importance of a match among
attitudes, beliefs and intentions, this study adds evidence of
the need for health communicators to address a spill-over
effect from misbeliefs about one vaccine on intention to use
another.
We note several caveats regarding findings. First, the use

 independent variables, and the covariates that produce statis-
tical noise may mask some of the effects or suppress their
sizes. Nonetheless, the effects were significant. Second, the
data used for analysis is cross-sectional and thus cannot be
interpreted as causal. For example, it may be the case that indi-
viduals who intended to get the vaccine sought more informa-
tion online. However, this caveat would not apply to the main
variables of interest, misbeliefs about MMR and perceived
severity and vulnerability. Finally, the variance explained in the
intentions to vaccinate was relatively small (R2 = 19.81%), a
possible product of statistical noise attributable to the single-
item measurements, or to the absence of other TRA compo-
nents from the model, such as attitudes and perceived control.
Factors not measured here that may also diminish intentions to
vaccinate include the fact that the vaccine is new, and fears asso-
ciated with the possible desirability of vaccinating pregnant
women. Future studies should more comprehensively test the
range of attitudinal barriers to vaccination and the specific ways
in which they may affect intentions.
