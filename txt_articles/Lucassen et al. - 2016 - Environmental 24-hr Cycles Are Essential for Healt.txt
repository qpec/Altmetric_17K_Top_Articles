SUMMARY
Circadian rhythms are deeply rooted in the biology of
virtually all organisms. The pervasive use of artificial
lighting in modern society disrupts circadian rhythms
and can be detrimental to our health. To investigate
the relationship between disrupting circadian rhyth-
micity and disease, we exposed mice to continuous
light (LL) for 24 weeks and measured several major
health parameters. Long-term neuronal recordings
revealed that 24 weeks of LL reduced rhythmicity in
the central circadian pacemaker of the suprachias-
matic nucleus (SCN) by 70%. Strikingly, LL exposure
also reduced skeletal muscle function (forelimb grip
strength, wire hanging duration, and grid hanging
duration), caused trabecular bone deterioration,
and induced a transient pro-inflammatory state.
After the mice were returned to a standard light-
dark cycle, the SCN neurons rapidly recovered their
normal high-amplitude rhythm, and the aforemen-
tioned health parameters returned to normal. These
findings strongly suggest that a disrupted circadian
rhythm reversibly induces detrimental effects on
multiple biological processes.
INTRODUCTION
Secundum naturam vivere.—Seneca (Letters to Lucilius,
Letter 5)
Virtually all organisms have measurable circadian rhythms that
help them anticipate and adapt to the environmental day-night
cycle. In mammals, these circadian rhythms are orchestrated
by neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is
located in the anterior hypothalamus. The SCN conveys tempo-
ral information to peripheral tissue oscillators, thus producing
synchronized circadian rhythms in many bodily processes,
including muscle function, bone metabolism, and immune sys-
tem function [1–4]. Under evolutionary pressure, the circadian
system evolved as a robust mechanism for adapting to life in a
cyclic environment. Thus, we hypothesize that organisms
require clear external cycles in order to maintain a healthy state
and that absence of external rhythmicity is detrimental for health.
The use of artificial lighting in modern society—particularly
during the night—disrupts the natural robust environmental
cycle and is a risk factor for frailty [5]. Nowadays, 75% of the
world’s population is exposed to light during the night [6]. More-
over, the prevalence of shift work is relatively high around the
globe; approximately 20% of workers in Europe, 29% of Ameri-
cans, and 36% of Chinese and Koreans are engaged in shift
work [7, 8]. Importantly, epidemiological studies of shift workers
revealed increased prevalence of breast cancer [9], metabolic
syndrome [10], osteoporosis [11], and bone fractures [12] in
this population. In addition, individuals who are exposed to
more light at night tend to have decreased sleep quality [13],
increased body weight [14], and a higher prevalence of cardio-
vascular disease [15]. Although these studies suggest a correla-
tion between artificial light exposure and health, they cannot
determine whether this relationship is causal. Animal studies
have shown that aberrant light exposure can affect both the im-
mune system [16–18] and metabolic function [19, 20]. However,
in these studies, the exposure to light was relatively brief; there-
fore, the results cannot be translated directly to humans, who are
often chronically exposed to disruptions in circadian rhythm.
To test whether long-term exposure to an aberrant light-dark
(LD) cycle affects these health parameters, and to test whether
these effects are reversible, we exposed mice to continuous light
(LL) for 24 weeks, followed by 24 weeks in a standard LD cycle.
To measure rhythmicity in the central clock, we performed in vivo
electrophysiological recordings in the SCN of freely moving mice
implanted with stationary electrodes. Although short-term expo-
sure to LL has been reported to reduce SCN rhythmicity [21–23],
whether the effects of long-term LL exposure are chronic has not
been studied previously. This issue is particularly important,
as the SCN is highly plastic and can adapt to changes in photo-
period, even after exposure for 3 weeks or longer [24]. We
measured the effect of long-term LL on skeletal muscle function,
bone microstructure, and immune system function at various

The top panel shows the experimental protocol. Mice in the LL group were exposed to light continuously from weeks 0 to 24 (experimental phase), then returned
to a standard 12 hr light/12 hr dark (LD) cycle from weeks 24 to 48 (recovery phase). Mice in the control group were maintained under the standard LD cycle for the
entire 48 weeks. At the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed for muscle and bone experiments or for LPS experiments. Note that separate cohorts of mice
were used at every time point. Mice used for the in vivo recordings are not included in the figure.

 time points during and following 24 weeks of LL exposure. Our
results support the hypothesis that long-term exposure to LL
conditions has significant detrimental effects on a wide range
of relevant health parameters. Moreover, the majority of these
parameters rapidly returned to normal upon restoring the LD
cycle. Thus, our results provide compelling evidence that an
absence of environmental rhythmicity plays a causal role in sus-
ceptibility to disease.
RESULTS
Reduced Behavioral Rhythms in LL
Wild-type mice (n = 134) were exposed to LL for 24 weeks
(‘‘experimental phase’’), followed by a 12 hr:12 hr LD cycle for
24 weeks (‘‘recovery phase’’). As a control group, a separate
set of age-matched mice (n = 119) were exposed to an LD cycle
for the entire 48 weeks (Figure 1). Although the strength of the
circadian rhythm decreased with age in both the LL and LD
groups, this effect was significantly greater in the LL mice
compared to the control mice (Figures 1A and 1B). At 2, 8, 16,
and 24 weeks, the behavioral rhythm in the mice in the LL group
was 19%, 36%, 50%, and 44% smaller, respectively, compared
to the control group. At 2, 8, 16, and 24 weeks in LL, 0/22, 1/20,
2/10, and 2/22 mice were arrhythmic as examined by F periodo-
gram, respectively. Rhythm strength of mice that were classified
as ‘‘rhythmic’’ by F periodogram analysis was severely damp-
ened (Figure S1). 2 and 8 weeks after returning to the LD cycle,
rhythm strength had increased by 79% (p < 0.001) and 104%
(p < 0.001), respectively, compared to rhythm strength at
24 weeks in LL. The period of behavioral rhythm was approxi-
mately 25.5 hr in the LL group, did not change over time, and
recovered to 24 hr during the recovery phase (Figure 1C). Mice
in the LL group had a slight but significant decrease in activity af-
ter 2 weeks in continuous light; however, activity levels did not
differ significantly between the two groups at any other time
point (Figure 1D). Upon returning to a standard LD cycle, the
mice in the LL group rapidly recovered in terms of both rhythm
period and rhythm strength (analyzed using the moving averages
method; Figures 1E and 1F). With respect to metabolism, the
mice in the LL group were significantly heavier at 8 and 24 weeks
than age-matched mice in the control group (respectively 2.8
and 2.4 g heavier). Similarly, unfasted glucose levels were signif-
icantly higher in the mice in the LL group at 24 weeks (Figure 1H).
Both the differences in weight and glucose levels disappeared
after the LL mice were returned to a standard LD cycle (Figures
1G and 1H).
LL Exposure Attenuates Neuronal Rhythms in the
Central Clock
At t = 0 (i.e., baseline), the multiunit activity (MUA) recordings re-
vealed high-amplitude rhythms, with higher levels of electrical
activity during the subjective day than during the subjective night
(Figure 2A). When exposed to LL, this amplitude decreased
initially to 63% of the baseline amplitude (Figures 2A and 2B);
at 8 and 24 weeks, the amplitude was reduced further to 34%
and 30% of baseline, respectively. The strength of the behavioral
rhythm was strongly correlated with MUA amplitude (R2 = 0.754,
p < 0.001, Pearson correlation), and fluctuations in the strength
of the SCN rhythm within individual animals occurred in par-
allel with fluctuations in the strength of the animal’s behavioral
activity rhythm. These changes in the SCN’s rhythm amplitude
recovered rapidly upon shifting back to a standard LD cycle.
Importantly, this recovery was mediated primarily by a reduction
in the SCN’s firing rate in the dark period. Proper positioning
of the microelectrode in the SCN was confirmed histologically
(Figures 2C and S2).
Skeletal Muscle Function Declines in Animals Exposed
to LL
Performance in all three functional muscle tests declined over
time in both groups of mice. During the experimental phase,
the mice in the LL group performed significantly worse in grip
strength and grid hanging duration at every time point compared
to the mice in the control group; performance in the wire hanging
test was also worse in the LL mice, with significantly different
values measured at 8 weeks (Figures 3A–3C). The difference in
skeletal muscle function between the two groups disappeared
in the recovery phase. Additional analyses in which the results
were corrected for body weight and behavioral activity were per-
formed for all measures (grip strength, wire hanging and grid
hanging time), and this did not alter effect sizes or significance
levels.
Both groups of mice exhibited increased fatigue-related
behavior (e.g., distance walked, behavioral intensity, and time
spent rearing) and anxiety-related behavior (e.g., time spent
in a corner) after completing the tests as analyzed by video
analysis; however, these measures did not differ significantly be-
tween the LL and control groups (Figure S3). These observations
suggest that the effect of LL exposure cannot be attributed to a
difference in motivation or anxiety.
We found no difference between the two groups with respect
to absolute creatine kinase (CK) levels, the pre-test or post-test
CK ratio, or the change in CK levels, indicating that LL exposure
did not induce muscle damage. Although the relative amount
of fibrosis in the quadriceps muscle was significantly higher in
LL mice compared to control mice at 24 weeks (percentage of
collagen 5% ± 1% versus 4% ± 1%, respectively), this difference
was too small to account for the observed differences in
muscle function. We found no significant difference in the
mRNA levels of macrophage (Lgals3, CD68), fibrosis (Col1a),
regeneration (MyoG), mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1a), or fiber
type (Myh7, Myh2, and Myh4, which are expressed in type 1 slow

markers in quadriceps muscles at 8 and 24 weeks.
Exposure to LL Induces Features Characteristic of Early
Osteoporosis
After 8 weeks in the experimental phase, both groups of mice
had normal bone maturation and reached their peak relative
bone volume density (BV/TV) at 20 weeks of age (Figures 4A
and S4). After 8 weeks of LL exposure, the metaphysis and
diaphysis of the femurs had a thicker cortex compared to con-
trols (Figure S4). Over the subsequent weeks, the volume, thick-
ness, number, and separation of the trabeculae, the structural
model index (SMI), and BV/TV began to differ between the two
groups (Figure S4). At the end of the 24-week experimental
phase, the trabeculae of the mice in the LL group were 34%
smaller in volume and 10% thinner (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4).
The mice in the LL group also had 28% fewer trabeculae, which
were separated more (by 16%). The trabeculae in this group
were also more rod-like in shape compared to the control group.
Together, these findings are characteristic of the early stages of
osteoporosis.
In the LL group, cortical bone thickness in the metaphysis was
increased by 5%; however, LL exposure had no effect on cortical
volume in the metaphysis or any cortical parameters in the
diaphysis (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4). Remarkably, bone structure
no longer differed between LL-exposed mice and controls after
returning the mice to a standard LD cycle (Figure S4). Similar re-
sults were obtained when we repeated our analyses after con-
trolling for body weight and behavioral activity levels. Lastly,
consistent with age-related osteoporosis, the serum levels of

 calcium, phosphate, and creatinine did not differ significantly be-
tween the LL and control groups (Figure S4).
Exposure to LL Alters the Immune System
The total white blood cell (WBC) count was relatively unchanged
throughout the experimental phase and did not differ signifi-
cantly between groups (Figure 5A). In contrast, both hemoglobin
levels and hematocrit values were lower in the LL mice, particu-
larly after 8 weeks of LL exposure (Figures 5B and 5C). Also at
8 weeks, the relative number of neutrophils was nearly twice
as high in the LL group, and the LL mice had fewer lymphocytes
(Figures 5D and 5E). The fraction of monocytes was higher in the
mice in the LL group, particularly at 16 weeks (Figure 5F). In the
recovery phase, the level of monocytes returned to control
levels; however, the hemoglobin and hematocrit values did not
return fully to control levels. With respect to the absolute number
of leucocyte subtypes, we also measured significantly more neu-
trophils and significantly fewer lymphocytes in the LL group at
8 weeks; in contrast, absolute number of monocytes did not
differ significantly between the two groups.
After 2 weeks into the experimental phase, the mice in the LL
group had lower plasma levels of IL-1b and IL-10, and they had
higher plasma levels of TNF-a compared to controls (Figure 5G).
Total cytokine secretion measured as the area under the curve
(AUC) also differed for IL-1b and TNF-a (Figure 5G; Table 1). After
8 weeks, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of the pro-
inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a was higher in
the LL group, whereas secretion of the anti-inflammatory cyto-
kine IL-10 was lower in the LL group. At 24 weeks, LPS-induced
cytokine secretion no longer differed between the two groups.
Taken together, these data suggest that LL exposure induces
a transient pro-inflammatory state.
DISCUSSION
Exposing C57BL/6J mice to LL for 24 weeks had significant
effects on the in vivo activity of neurons in the SCN. In addition,
LL caused a significant decrease in skeletal muscle function and
caused microstructural bone changes characteristic of the early
stages of osteoporosis. Finally, mice exposed to LL displayed
transient changes in the immune system, including a pro-inflam-
matory state that resolved after prolonged exposure to light.
Upon re-exposing the mice to an LD cycle, circadian period
length, SCN neuronal rhythms, and immune function returned
to pre-LL levels, while for the other parameters, the significant
difference between the experimental and control group dis-
appeared. Taken together, these results suggest that removing
cyclic environmental cues causes a reversible state of physio-
logical vulnerability.
Exposure to LL Decreases the Strength of Circadian
Rhythms
Retinal photoreceptors receive light and project light-encoded
information to the SCN via melanopsin-containing retinal gan-
glion cells and chemical photoreceptors [25, 26]. Continuous
exposure to light causes desynchronization of SCN neurons
[22], and in peripheral bodily tissues [27] in contrast to constant
darkness [20]. The long-term effects of LL—as well as the
system’s capacity to restore rhythmicity after returning to a stan-
dard LD cycle—had not been studied previously and are highly
relevant, given that circadian rhythms can be disrupted for
extended periods, for example in shift workers or elderly per-
sons. We confirm that short-term exposure to LL decreases
neuronal amplitude [20] and demonstrate that long-term LL
exposure further attenuates rhythmicity by approximately two-
thirds throughout the 24 weeks of exposure. The strength of
the SCN’s rhythm of a given animal corresponded temporally
with the strength of that animal’s behavioral activity rhythm, sug-
gesting that fluctuations in rhythm strength have a direct impact
on overt behavioral rhythms.
LL Exposure Disrupts Skeletal Muscle Function
All mice had a decline in muscle function over time; this pro-
gressive decline in muscle function is likely due to the effects
of aging [28]. The mice in the LL group had less grip strength
than age-matched control mice, indicating that LL reduces
muscle strength in addition to age. The mice in the LL group
also had reduced physical endurance, reflected by decreased
performance on the hanging tests, which require the mouse to
maintain sustained force against gravity. Mice use all four limbs
for hanging on a grid; in contrast, hanging on a wire is more com-
plex and requires the coordination of several muscle groups, as
well as dexterity and axial muscle strength. Even after 2 weeks in
LL, the mice in the LL group showed a significant deficit, and
this deficit remained throughout the experimental phase. Impor-
tantly, this decreased muscle function was independent of body
weight or behavioral activity, indicating that the decrease in mus-
cle function was not merely a reflection of weight gain.
A video analysis of mouse behavior prior to and after functional
testing revealed that the two groups of mice were fatigued to a

 similar extent by the testing regime. They displayed similar levels
of anxiety-related behavior, suggesting that the LL-induced
decline in muscle function was not due to differences in moti-
vation. We currently have no evidence to suggest that the
decreased muscle function in the LL group was due to structural
differences in muscle fibrosis, muscle damage (e.g., CK levels),
macrophage levels in the muscle, muscle fiber type, or differ-
ences in mitochondrial function or muscle regeneration. Previous
studies have linked circadian rhythm with muscle function by
examining mice with mutations in their clock genes; specifically,
these mice develop structural muscle changes [1, 29, 30] and
diminished muscle function [1, 31]. However, because clock
gene mutants may have impaired muscle function due to a direct
effect of the clock gene mutation on the cell cycle [32], these
models do not necessarily simulate disruptions in environmental
rhythmicity. Our analysis did not reveal significant changes in
muscle markers for immunological, degenerative or regenerative
changes, energy regulation, or type of fiber. We cannot exclude
that other markers would reveal differences but expect that
pre- or post-synaptic signaling at the neuromuscular synapse is
involved.
Continuous Exposure to Light Induces Clinical Features
Reminiscent of Early Osteoporosis
Short-term (i.e., up to 8 weeks) exposure to LL had no effect on
bone microstructure [33]. Indeed, the maturation of bone in both
animal groups was similar to bone maturation in humans [33, 34].
Long-term exposure to LL had a negative effect on the micro-
structure of cancellous (i.e., trabecular) bone; after 24 weeks,
the mice in the LL group had fewer trabeculae. The remaining
trabeculae were more rod-like in shape, thinner, less volumi-
nous, and more separated, thereby resulting in decreased BV/
TV compared to control mice. These changes in trabecular
bone are particularly striking, as C57BL/6 mice have a relatively
low BV/TV compared to other mouse strains [33]. The progres-
sive loss of trabecular bone is believed to play the most impor-
tant role in the decline in bone strength associated with age-
related osteoporosis [35]. The increased thickness of cortical
bone in mice exposed to LL may also be an accelerated effect
of aging, as cortical bone mass increases with age due to perios-
teal bone formation [35]; alternatively, it may represent a
compensatory mechanism designed to maintain overall bone
strength. Given its relatively large surface area, trabecular
bone undergoes considerable turnover and remodeling; thus,
osteoporotic changes are usually observed in trabecular bone
first. Therefore, we feel that the changes in trabecular bone
in mice exposed to LL are characteristic of early osteoporosis.
In previous studies, light at night has been associated with
lower rather than higher corticosterone levels [20, 36]. Since in-
creases, not decreases, in corticosterone have been associated
with muscle wasting and osteoporosis, we do not expect that
changes in levels of corticosterone were a direct trigger for the
effects we observed. For a mechanistic explanation for the
observed differences, future studies should include measure-
ment of markers of bone turnover, such as P1NP and CTX.
Of note, the levels of both calcium and phosphate were unaf-
fected in the mice in the LL group, consistent with age-related
osteoporosis in humans [2]. Moreover, general kidney function,
which was assessed by measuring creatinine levels, was also
unaffected by LL exposure.
In human studies, female shift workers have an increased risk
of bone fractures [12] and decreased bone mineral density [11].
These observational studies cannot be used to determine cau-
sality; thus, our results indicate for the first time that disrupted
environmental rhythms are a causal factor in the decline in
bone microstructure. Per and Cry mutant mice display increased
bone mass and osteoblast activity [37], while Bmal1 knockouts
display ectopic calcification and abnormal endochondral ossifi-
cation [3, 37, 38].
Circadian Disruption and the Immune System
Two weeks of LL exposure mildly affected LPS-induced cytokine
secretion. Eight weeks of LL exposure induced a higher number
of neutrophils, pro-inflammatory cells in the innate immune sys-
tem; thus, LL appears to induce a heightened pro-inflammatory
state. Consistent with this notion, the mice in the LL group had
higher LPS-induced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a, coupled with decreased secretion of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These differences were no
longer observed after 24 weeks of LL exposure, suggesting

 that the effect of LL on the immune system shows desensiti-
zation and/or that compensatory mechanisms may have been
activated. Identifying such compensatory mechanisms would
provide valuable information.
Previous studies have linked disruptions in environmental
rhythms with impaired immune function. For example, shift
workers have an increased risk of cancer [9] and metabolic
syndrome [39], both of which are related to immune system
dysfunction [40]. Shift workers do not have altered baseline cyto-
kine levels [41], and their immune response to challenges has not
been investigated. Previous animal studies have suggested that
circadian disruption is a causal factor in altered immune system
function. For example, mice subjected to a chronic (i.e., 4-week)
jet lag protocol have an enhanced response to LPS challenges
[4], and intestinal irritant-induced colitis is more aggressive in
mice that are chronically phase shifted [42]. Moreover, exposing
rats to LL increases mortality following LPS-induced sepsis [43].
In our experiments, we used a low, non-lethal dose of LPS;
therefore, we were able to quantify the effects of an immune
stimulus that more closely resembles the inflammatory response
in human sepsis [44].
Recovery of Health versus Stability of Health upon
Returning to a Normal Environmental Cycle
After returning to a standard LD cycle (i.e., the recovery phase),
the mice in the LL group no longer had impaired muscle perfor-
mance or deficits in trabecular bone microstructure. It is difficult
to assess whether restoring the LD cycle leads to a bona fide re-
covery of health, as bone microstructure and muscle function
naturally decline with age. Nevertheless, in the recovery phase,
many health parameters either stabilized or improved slightly,
and none of the parameters measured continued to decline,
while muscle function and bone microstructure have the poten-
tial to decline to much lower levels, as observed in very old mice
or models of severe disease [33, 45].
Immune parameters recovered to values before LL treatment
and in the SCN, neuronal rhythmicity recovered instantaneously
after returning the mice to a standard LD cycle. Importantly, this
rapid recovery led to a large amplitude rhythm that was properly
phased. The trough upon the first exposure to darkness was
particularly large, suggesting that this sudden, first absence of
light input acts as a ‘‘phase-resetting’’ stimulus for the majority
of SCN neurons. Our results are consistent with a previous report
in which the SCN’s rhythm recovered almost immediately
following a short bout of LL exposure [46]. Because neuronal ac-
tivity is the first step in generating the output signal and because
this activity drives the release of both neurotransmitters and hu-
moral signals, restoring the SCN’s output signal and thereby
boosting the rhythm in the sympathetic outflow [47] will have im-
mediate consequences for all peripheral systems that are under
control of the autonomic nervous system.
Clinical Relevance
Exposing animals to LL is an important model for intensive care
settings and nursing homes, in which lighting can fluctuate so lit-
tle throughout the 24-hr period that patients usually fail to entrain
to these cycles [48–50]. For example, rhythms in behavior, body
temperature, corticosteroid levels, heart rate, and melatonin
levels are often disrupted—or even abolished—in intensive
care patients [51–54]. Ironically, exposure to a robust environ-
mental cycle may be particularly relevant to severely ill patients,
as these patients could benefit considerably from a robust
immune response. Studies have shown that preterm infants in
neonatal intensive care units have improved sleep patterns and
gain weight faster when exposed to a robust LD cycle [55–58].
In addition, nursing home residents have improved sleep and
higher levels of physical activity [59].
In the present study, we used a condition of LL as a paradigm
to induce rhythm disturbances, rather than light-dim light or a
chronically shifting LD schedule, since LL has displayed consis-
tent and strong effects and it is most comparable to certain arti-
ficial light settings, for example, the intensive care setting. Given
our present results, it is of importance to perform studies with
paradigms that mimic light pollution in modern society in other
ways and to explore their effect on bone, muscle, and immune
function.
As 18% of elderly adults have decreased muscle strength [60],
6%–21% have osteoporosis [61], and immune system dysregu-
lation can aggravate age-related pathologies [62], large seg-
ments of the elderly population are at increased risk for frailty.
While intuitively health is associated more with the immune
system, it is generally accepted (e.g., in the clinic) that bone
and especially muscle function is a strong indicator for general
health, correlating highly with life expectation. A frail state in
the elderly could be explained by a decline in their circadian sys-
tem, since the changes in rhythm amplitude in the SCN in the LL
group are reminiscent of rhythm changes that occur in the clock
of aged individuals [63]. Therefore, the LL-induced decline in
mice may represent the contribution of an ‘‘aged’’ clock to the
age-related decline in health.

 Conclusions
Here, we provide insight into the long-term effects of disrupted
environmental rhythmicity on several major health parameters,
and we provide evidence that the majority of these effects are
reversible. We conclude that complex temporal relationships
involved in daily fluctuations in muscle function, bone microstruc-
ture, and immune function are disrupted by exposure to LL, and
thisdisruptionunderliestheobservedchangesinhealth.Theeffect
of LL-induced disruption of the SCN and consequent effects for
SCN output are expected to be intrinsically related with secondary
effects such as sleep disturbances, changes in the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system, etc. The
contributionoftheir effecttothe observeddecline inhealth-related
parameters cannot be disentangled from the immediate circadian
disorders induced by LL. Yet, the important message is that the
environmental LL condition is sufficient to trigger a cascade of
effects, leading to frailty.
These results create new opportunities for prevention and
treatment programs, particularly for frail individuals, such as
intensive care patients, nursing home residents, and the elderly.
Our results are also highly relevant to large segments of the pop-
ulation, as three-quarters of the world’s population is routinely
exposed to artificial light during the night [6]. We propose that
long-term prospective studies should be performed to examine
the health effects of increasing diurnal light levels in such settings.
For example, in addition to increasing light levels during the day
[64], light exposure during the night can be reduced easily without
compromising patient safety [65]. The long-term effects of a
robust LD cycle on muscle function, bone microstructure, and
the immune system are currently unknown in humans. Our study
provides compelling evidence that the detrimental effects of
chronic LL exposure warrant further investigation.
