Abstract: The search for new nontraditional targets is a high priority in antibiotic design today. Bacterial membrane energetics
based on sodium ion circulation offers potential alternative targets. The present work identifies the Na+-translocating NADH:
ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR), a key respiratory enzyme in many microbial pathogens, as indispensible for the
Chlamydia trachomatis infectious process. Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis significantly increased first H+ and then Na+ levels
within the host mammalian cell. A newly designed furanone Na+-NQR inhibitor, PEG-2S, blocked the changes in both H+ and Na+
levels induced by Chlamydia trachomatis infection. It also inhibited intracellular proliferation of Chlamydia trachomatis with a
half-minimal inhibitory concentration in the submicromolar range but did not affect the viability of mammalian cells or
bacterial species representing benign intestinal microflora. At low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 value = 1.76 nmol/L), PEG-2S
inhibited the Na+-NQR activity in sub-bacterial membrane vesicles isolated from Vibrio cholerae. Taken together, these results
show, for the first time, that Na+-NQR is critical for the bacterial infectious process and is susceptible to a precisely targeted
bactericidal compound in situ. The obtained data have immediate relevance for many different diseases caused by pathogenic
bacteria that rely on Na+-NQR activity for growth, including sexually transmitted, pulmonary, oral, gum, and ocular infections.

Introduction
Despite the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance today,
the number of new antibiotics grows at a distressingly slow rate
(Russell 2002). The essential part of the problem is that the vast
majority of antibiotics target the same 3 general prokaryotic path-
ways: protein synthesis, DNA replication, and bacterial cell wall
assembly. The identification of new targets outside of these tradi-
tional “over-targeted” pathways is, therefore, critical if the prob-
lem of antibiotic resistance is to be solved.
Bacterial energetics represents an attractive alternative target.
Although the majority of modern bacteria exploit the transmem-
brane circulation of protons (H+ cycle) in their membrane ener-
getics, a number of species rely on the sodium ion circulation (Na+
cycle) rather than the H+ cycle (Skulachev 1985). In these bacteria,
primary Na+ pumps generate the transmembrane electrochemi-
cal gradient of Na+ that can serve as a direct source of energy for
vital functions including substrate accumulation, motility, and
ATP synthesis (Skulachev 1985). Importantly, the Na+ cycle is wide-
spread among bacterial pathogens (Häse et al. 2001).

 Chlamydiae are a good example of such pathogenic bacteria. All
chlamydial genomes encode a complete Na+ cycle including the
Na+-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) as
a major primary Na+ pump (Dibrov et al. 2004; Dzioba et al. 2003;
Häse et al. 2001; Reyes-Prieto et al. 2014). The Na+-NQR is the major
respiratory Na+ pump in aerobic pathogens (Häse et al. 2001;
Reyes-Prieto et al. 2014). Although not homologous to the respira-
tory Complex I (Dibrov et al. 2004; Dzioba et al. 2003; Reyes-Prieto
et al. 2014; Steuber et al. 2014), it occupies the same position in the
electron transport chain, using the oxidation of NADH by ubiqui-
none to drive translocation of Na+ across the membrane. Reduc-
tion of quinone by the NQR complex is tightly coupled with Na+
translocation (Juárez et al. 2009; Steuber et al. 2014) and is inhib-
ited by the quinone analogs HQNO and korormicin (Hayashi et al.
2002; Nakayama et al. 1999; Yoshikawa et al. 1997). The Na+ cycle
may be critical for maintaining bacterial energetics operative dur-
ing chlamydial infection (Dibrov et al. 2004). It has been hypoth-
esized that the rapid consumption of ATP and glucose by
chlamydiae at the onset of infection would lead to acidification of
the host cytoplasm that will in turn activate Na+/H+ exchange in
the host cells to remove H+ and increase Na+ influx simultane-
ously with the inhibition of Na+ export via Na+/K+ ATPase (Dibrov
et al. 2004). The resulting rise in [Na+]i in the infected cell would
support chlamydial accumulation of amino acids and other sub-
strates by sodium-dependent symporters (Dibrov et al. 2004).
Thus, the Na+ cycle may be instrumental in the infectious process
and, in the framework of this hypothesis, the Na+-NQR is a key
element in the energization of nutrient uptake by the invading
pathogen.
If the preceding line of reasoning is correct, inhibition of Na+-
NQR should arrest bacterial energization and proliferation and,
ultimately, disrupt the infectious process. Korormicin is a natu-
rally occurring antibiotic and the most specific and potent Na+-
NQR inhibitor known (Nakayama et al. 1999). In this work,
korormicin and a novel synthetic furanone inhibitor of Na+-NQR
were used to test the hypothesis that Na+-NQR is a valid therapeu-
tic target in the infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The
objectives of the present study were, therefore, 2-fold: (i) to assess
Na+-NQR as a novel antibiotic target and (ii) to test the efficacy of a
newly synthesized furanone Na+-NQR inhibitor to arrest Chlamydia
trachomatis infection.
Materials and methods
Materials
Non-stereospecific synthesis of the furanone inhibitor, named
PEG-2 here, was done by Enamine Ltd. (Kiev, Ukraine). According
to the manufacturer, racemic PEG-2 mixture contained approxi-
mately 5%–10% of a desired enantiomer, PEG-2S. Stereospecific
synthesis of PEG-2S was accomplished by Canam Bioresearch
(Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada).
Bacterial strains and cultivation
Vibrio cholerae O395N1 strain (O1 classical biotype; SmR, �ctxA1)
(Mekalanos et al. 1983), and its isogenic �nqrA-F mutant derivative
(Dibrov et al. 2002), were used for isolation of sub-bacterial vesi-
cles. To maximize the expression of Na+-NQR, V. cholerae cells were
grown with vigorous aeration at 30 °C in FM medium (30 g/L NaCl,
0.75 g/L KCl, 1.2 g/L MgSO4, 1 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mmol/L KH2PO4,
0.4% glycerol, 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0) (Fadeeva et al. 2007) contain-
ing 0.4% succinate.
As representatives of benign gastrointestinal microflora, Escherichia
coli DH5� (supE44 hsdR17 recA1 endA1, gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) (U.S. Biochem-
ical Corp.), Lactococcus lactis (Boreal Northwest-VWR, Cat. No. 851150),
and Enterococcus faecalis (NCTC 775) were used. Cells were maintained/
propagated at 37 °C in standard tryptic soy broth (Difco) and on agar
plates prepared on the same broth.
Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 was propagated as described
previously (Hirono et al. 2003). The purified organism was stored
in SPG buffer (0.22 mol/L sucrose, 8.6 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 3.8 mmol/L
KH2PO4, 5 mmol/L glutamic acid, 0.2 �m filtered, pH 7.4) at –80 °C
until use. The titer of Chlamydia trachomatis was determined in HeLa
cells in the presence of cycloheximide (1.0 �g/mL), and concentra-
tions used were expressed as inclusion-forming units (IFU) per mil-
lilitre.
Mammalian cells
HeLa 229 cells (ATCC, CCL-2.1), HEK-293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573),
and primary rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were
used. VSMCs were harvested as previously described (Massaeli
et al. 1999). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s
medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitro-
gen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2.
Assays of the growth of free-living bacteria
Overnight starter cultures of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and
Enterococcus faecalis were grown aerobically in tryptic soy broth and
used to inoculate 200 �L tryptic soy broth medium in 96-deep-well
plates (Whatman) at an initial OD600 of 0.05. The obtained cul-
tures were supplemented with 0.5–50.0 �mol/L PEG-2S (or pure
DMSO in “zero” controls) and grown at 37 °C for 24 h with vigor-
ous aeration. At 2, 5, and 24 h, growth was measured as OD600 by
scanning the plates on a Bio-Rad iMark microplate reader. For
samples taken at 5 and 24 h, serial dilutions with the pre-warmed
growth medium were prepared using the aliquots of bacterial
cultures. The experiments were repeated at least 3 times.
Evaluation of PEG-2 efficiency against Clostridium difficile (Clos-
tridium difficile ATCC 700057) was performed by the Drop method
on pre-reduced BAK plates (Brucella agar with 5% laked sheep
blood, hemin, and vitamin K) according to Methods for Antimicro-
bial Susceptibility Testing of Anaerobic Bacteria (CLSI 2012).
Assessment of antichlamydial properties of antibiotics
For minimal concentration of the antibiotic that inhibits for-
mation of chlamydial inclusions by 50% (MIC50) determination,
HeLa cells were grown in 24-well or 96-well plates overnight prior
to chlamydial inoculation. Elementary bodies (105 IFU/mL) were
applied to the cells in SPG buffer (as identified above) and, after
2 h of incubation, unattached elementary bodies were removed
and infected cells were treated with different concentrations of
antibiotics in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence of
cycloheximide (1.0 �g/mL). After 42 h, inclusions were visualized
by immunocytochemistry.
To determine the chlamydicidal effect of korormicin and PEG-2,
HeLa cells were plated on 35 mm dishes, infected with Chlamydia
trachomatis, and treated with different concentrations of the anti-
biotic of choice. After 48 h, Chlamydia trachomatis was collected (P1)
and used to infect fresh cells. Subsequent collections of Chlamydia
trachomatis were used to obtain P2, P3, P4, and P5 stocks of Chlamydia
trachomatis. Dilution of Chlamydia trachomatis used to infect
cells after treatment with PEG-2 had to be minimized to visualize
inclusions. The last passage collection of Chlamydia trachomatis (P5)
after korormicin treatment and all collected passages of Chlamydia
trachomatis treated with PEG-2 were used to establish infectivity of
treated Chlamydiatrachomatis.Theminimalchlamydicidalconcentra-
tion (MCC2) for korormicin, PEG-2, and PEG-2S was calculated af-
ter 2 passages of infection with treatment and reflect inhibition of
infection by more than 90%. In all experiments, the inclusions
were visualized by immunocytochemistry.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2–4 ×
104 cells/well) or on glass-bottomed 96-well plates (104 cells/well)
overnight and then inoculated with Chlamydia trachomatis. After
42 h, cells were fixed with 90% acetone (or 100% methanol in the

 case of 96-well plates), probed with anti-Chlamydia specific anti-
body (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and inclusions were visualized
by Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular
Probes, Invitrogen) with DAPI (300 nmol/L) as a counter-staining.
Inclusion bodies and cell nuclei were identified using a fluores-
cent inverted microscope (TE- 2000s; Nikon). Cells and inclusions
were counted using Adobe Photoshop CS3.Ink software.
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates in growth
media and treated with different concentration of antibiotics. Af-
ter 48 h, the number of living cells was determined by colorimet-
ric enzyme assay (CellTiter 96 Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega
Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) (Cory et al. 1991).
Preparation of sub-bacterial membrane vesicles from
V. cholerae cells
Membrane vesicles from V. cholerae strains were prepared as
described previously (Dibrov et al. 2002). The membrane pellet
was suspended in Buffer A containing 100 mmol/L KCl, 50 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgSO4, 20 mmol/L HEPES-Tris, pH 8.0 at 20–30 mg
protein/mL, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.
Na+-NQR activity assays in sub-bacterial vesicles
The activity of Na+-NQR in sub-bacterial V. cholerae vesicles was
measured at 25 °C as oxidation of dNADH (�340 = 6.22 L/(mmol·
cm))
by following the changes in its fluorescence at 440 nm (excitation
light � = 340 nm) using Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorometer. The
assays were conducted in Buffer A supplemented with 15 �mol/L
Na+-dNADH with constant stirring. The reaction was initiated by
the addition of vesicles (aliquots of 50 �g of protein). Fluorescence
at 440 nm as a function of [dNADH] in the experimental buffer was
linear up to 20 �mol/L of added dNADH (data not shown).
Measurements of intracellular pH and sodium in cells
pHrodo Green AM and CoroNa Green Sodium Indicator (both
Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were used to measure intracellular
pH (pHi) and intracellular sodium (Na+i) concentration, respec-
tively. HEK293 cells were seeded on 24-well plates and infected
with Chlamydia trachomatis after overnight incubation in DMEM
with 5% fetal bovine serum. After 2 h of incubation with Chlamydia
trachomatis, cells were treated with different concentrations of
PEG-2S and subjected to pHi and Na+i measurements at different
time points according to the manufacturer’
s protocols. In all as-
sessments, calibration curves were performed prior to the exper-
iments. A fluorescent inverted microscope (TE- 2000s; Nikon) was
used to obtain images and mean intensity was quantified using
NIS Elements imaging software (Nikon, Mississauga, Ontario,
Canada).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.
Differences between treatment groups were assessed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the Student–Newman–Keuls
method (Hirono et al. 2003). A probability of P ≤ 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Chlamydial invasion perturbs ion homeostasis of infected
cells
Chlamydia trachomatis infection of HEK293 cells induced changes
in cytoplasmic pH and Na+ content. As expected, whereas pH did
not change in uninfected cells, infected cells became acidic within
2 h (Fig. 1A). The significant cytoplasmic acidification caused by
the metabolic activity of chlamydial reticulate bodies was fol-
lowed by a significant secondary rise in Na+i. Na+i did not change
in uninfected cells but exhibited a delayed increase in chlamydia-
infected cells (Fig. 1B).
Inhibition of chlamydial Na+-NQR by korormicin suppresses
proliferation of Chlamydia trachomatis reticulate bodies but
is toxic to mammalian cells
Korormicin, an antibiotic targeting Na+-NQR that was initially
isolated from marine bacterium (Yoshikawa et al. 1997), inhibited
the growth of Chlamydia trachomatis at 10–20 �mol/L (Figs. 2A–2D).
The extrapolated MIC50 for korormicin (after the first treatment)
was �18.00 �mol/L (Table 1). However, korormicin was also cyto-
toxic to mammalian cells at low nmol/L concentrations (Fig. 2E).
Design of synthetic NQR inhibitor PEG-2
The toxicity of korormicin encouraged us to redesign the inhib-
itor to be more suitable as an anti-NQR medicine (Dibrov et al.
2016). To eliminate the cytotoxic effect of natural korormicin, its
epoxy group was identified as the most probable source of toxicity
and removed. Further, the aliphatic “tail” of korormicin (Fig. 3A)
was shortened to 7 carbon atoms to lessen the overall hy-
drophobicity of the molecule and thus lower its effective anti-
chlamydial concentration. This approach yielded a furanone

 compound, named PEG-2 (Fig. 3B) (Dibrov et al. 2016). Due to the
presence of 2 chiral centers in the molecule, 4 stereoisomers of
PEG-2 are possible (Fig. 3B). Racemic mixtures of PEG-2 were ini-
tially used, which according to the manufacturer’
s report, con-
tained ≤10% of the active enantiomer, PEG-2S, shown in Fig. 3B.
Direct measurement of inhibition of Na+-NQR by PEG-2S
Na+-NQR activity can be differentially measured in sub-bacterial
membrane vesicles as the NQR-mediated oxidation of an NADH
analog, dNADH (Bertsova and Bogachev 2004; Fadeeva et al. 2007,
2008; Kostyrko et al. 2016). This allows the measurement of NQR

 activity directly without confounding factors — the enzyme is
functioning in its native membrane and feeding the electrons
taken from NADH to the respiratory chain. Vesicles isolated
from the NQR-positive V. cholerae strain demonstrated a PEG-2S-
sensitive oxidation of dNADH (Fig. 4A). Removal of functional
Na+-NQR by the chromosomal nqrA-F deletion resulted in the in-
ability of membranes isolated from the mutant V. cholerae strain
to oxidize dNADH (Fig. 4A). PEG-2S inhibition exhibited an MIC50
of 1.76 nmol/L (Fig. 4B).
PEG-2S disrupts chlamydia-induced changes in ionic
homeostasis in cells
In accordance with results shown in Fig. 1, HEK293 cells in-
fected with Chlamydia trachomatis displayed a cytoplasmic acidifi-
cation followed by an increase in Na+i levels (Fig. 5). The addition
of PEG-2S significantly supressed the chlamydia-induced acidifi-
cation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). As expected, sodium
accumulation was delayed relative to the acidification and it was
also sensitive to the low �mol/L PEG-2S concentrations (Fig. 5B).

 Anti-chlamydial effects of PEG-2 and PEG-2S
A single treatment with racemic PEG-2 had a significant effect
on infection of HeLa cells by Chlamydia trachomatis (Fig. 6). PEG-2
was more effective than korormicin by at least 2 orders of magni-
tude (Fig. 6A). As expected, PEG-2S was even more potent as an
anti-chlamydial agent than PEG-2 (Table 1). The MIC50 for PEG-2
and PEG-2S was 10 �mol/L and 0.7 �mol/L, respectively. After two
consecutive treatments, the MIC502 for PEG-2 was 4 �mol/L versus
0.25 �mol/L for PEG-2S (Table 1). Chlamydial inclusions formed in
the presence of PEG-2 were hollow compared with the untreated
control cells (Fig. 6B), and significantly smaller (Fig. 6C).
PEG-2 and PEG2S are nontoxic
PEG-2 up to 20 �mol/L (as well as PEG-2S) had no toxic effects on
primary cell cultures (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, PEG-2 and PEG-2S
(1–50 �mol/L) did not affect the growth of NQR-negative spe-
cies, including benign gastrointestinal bacteria, Escherichia coli,
Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis (Fig. 7), and pathogenic
Clostridium difficile (data not shown).
Discussion
The results presented here are important from 2 perspectives.
First, they demonstrate that the activity of the Na+-NQR is critical
for the growth and proliferation of Chlamydia trachomatis and
provide an explanation for this. The metabolism of invading
Chlamydia trachomatis increased cytoplasmic [H+] in the host cell by
10-fold soon after infection, and subsequently elevated intracellu-
lar Na+ levels as well. Both observed effects have been predicted
theoretically in the earlier work (Dibrov et al. 2004). The acidifi-
cation of the cytoplasm in chlamydiae-infected cells was thought
to occur due to the rapid catabolism of glucose provided by the
host cell (Dibrov et al. 2004; Iliffe-Lee and McClarty 1999). Deple-
tion of the host ATP pool caused by the metabolic activity of
chlamydial reticulate bodies (Iliffe-Lee and McClarty 1999) should
have reduced the export of Na+ by the Na+/K+ ATPase. Together
with an activation of Na+ influx via Na+/H+ exchange at the host
cell plasma membrane due to the elevated increased [H+]i, this was
expected to result in a rise of [Na+]i (Dibrov et al. 2004). Measure-
ments of internal Na+ and pH in uninfected and infected cells
confirmed both these predictions (Figs. 5A and 5B). This helps to
explain why the membrane energetics of this obligate intracellular
parasite relies on the sodium-motive force. Like other members of
the Chlamydia genus, Chlamydia trachomatis encodes Na+-dependent
symporters for the accumulation of a variety of substrates, includ-
ing amino acids and dicarboxylates (Dibrov et al. 2004). Therefore,
it is concluded that the generation and maintenance of the
sodium-motive force by the Na+-NQR becomes a prerequisite for
the proliferation of Chlamydia trachomatis.
The second major advance presented in this study is the design
of a novel antibiotic that targets the Na+-NQR and, in so doing,
inhibits the growth and proliferation of Chlamydia trachomatis. The
best NQR inhibitor identified to date is korormicin, an antibiotic
initially isolated from a marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas sp.
(Yoshikawa et al. 1997). However, its capacity to inhibit bacterial
growth was orders of magnitude less than its toxicity profile.
Thus, although the experiments with korormicin confirmed the
crucial role of Na+-NQR in bacterial proliferation, this inhibitor
cannot be advanced clinically as an anti-chlamydial remedy. Con-
versely, the data with PEG-2 and PEG-2S support this agent as
an effective inhibitor of Na+-NQR. The experiments with sub-
bacterial membrane vesicles allowed the measurement of Na+-
NQR activity directly when the enzyme was operating in a
physiologically relevant background (being placed in its native
membrane and supplying electrons taken from NADH to the re-
spiratory chain) but without additional permeability barriers and
influences from cytoplasmic metabolism (Bertsova and Bogachev
2004; Fadeeva et al. 2007, 2008; Kostyrko et al. 2016). In this model,
PEG-2S exhibited a low MIC50 of 1.76 nmol/L (Fig. 4B). PEG-2S was
also effective against Chlamydia trachomatis at low �mol/L concen-
trations in infected HeLa cells. It was nontoxic to both mamma-
lian cells (Fig. 6D) and non-pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria
(Fig. 7). Na+-NQR is absent in these cell types and this would,
therefore, support the contention that PEG-2S is a highly selective
inhibitor of Na+-NQR. Of note, gram-positive Clostridium difficile
possesses the ancestral form of NQR, RNF (Reyes-Prieto et al. 2014).

3 Na+-NQR-negative species belonging to benign intestinal
microflora in liquid medium was measured as light absorbtion at
600 nm at 2, 5, and 24 h of aerobic growth as described in the
Materials and methods. Plotted are means of 5 parallel cultures
exposed to each concentration of PEG-2S tested. Statistical analysis
revealed no difference in growth yields of any tested species at any
concentration of added PEG-2S. Pure stereoisomer, PEG-2S, was used
in these experiments. (A) Escherichia coli, (B) Lactococcus lactis,

 zymes is implicated in the binding of korormicin (Hayashi et al.
2002) and is absent in a homologous subunit of RNF (Reyes-Prieto
et al. 2014). Because Clostridium difficile was not sensitive to PEG-2S
(data not shown), one can conclude that PEG-2S may require
Gly140 to bind to Na+-NQR.
The data shown for the inhibition of bacterial growth by PEG-2
and PEG-2S have implications beyond the inhibition of the growth
of chlamydial pathogens. Na+-NQR is present in a variety of
pathogenic bacteria including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Treponema
denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria meningitidis,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and many others (Dibrov et al. 2004; Häse
et al. 2001; Reyes-Prieto et al. 2014; Steuber et al. 2014). Each may
rely on Na+-NQR for its energetics to different degrees and, there-
fore, will have differing sensitivities to anti-NQR drugs. Neverthe-
less, in the future, PEG-2S may be attractive for clinical use to
suppress bacterial growth and proliferation in a number of differ-
ent diseases by inhibiting Na+-NQR activity.
