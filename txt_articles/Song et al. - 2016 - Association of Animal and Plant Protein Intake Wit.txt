IMPORTANCE Defining what represents a macronutritionally balanced diet remains an open
question and a high priority in nutrition research. Although the amount of protein may have
specific effects, from a broader dietary perspective, the choice of protein sources will
inevitably influence other components of diet and may be a critical determinant for the
health outcome.
OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of animal and plant protein intake with the risk for
mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study of US health care
professionals included 131 342 participants from the Nurses’Health Study (1980 to end of
follow-up on June 1, 2012) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986 to end of
follow-up on January 31, 2012). Animal and plant protein intake was assessed by regularly
updated validated food frequency questionnaires. Data were analyzed from June 20, 2014,
to January 18, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cause-specific
mortality.
RESULTS Of the 131 342 participants, 85 013 were women (64.7%) and 46 329 were men
(35.3%) (mean [SD] age, 49 [9] years). The median protein intake, as assessed by percentage
of energy, was 14% for animal protein (5th-95th percentile, 9%-22%) and 4% for plant
protein (5th-95th percentile, 2%-6%). After adjusting for major lifestyle and dietary risk
factors, animal protein intake was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.02 per 10%
energy increment; 95% CI, 0.98-1.05; P for trend = .33) but was associated with higher
cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.08 per 10% energy increment; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P for
trend = .04). Plant protein was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.90 per 3%
energy increment; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95; P for trend < .001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR,
0.88 per 3% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.80-0.97; P for trend = .007). These associations
were confined to participants with at least 1 unhealthy lifestyle factor based on smoking,
heavy alcohol intake, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity, but not evident among
those without any of these risk factors. Replacing animal protein of various origins with plant
protein was associated with lower mortality. In particular, the HRs for all-cause mortality were
0.66 (95% CI, 0.59-0.75) when 3% of energy from plant protein was substituted for an
equivalent amount of protein from processed red meat, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92) from
unprocessed red meat, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75-0.88) from egg.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE High animal protein intake was positively associated with
cardiovascular mortality and high plant protein intake was inversely associated with all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality, especially among individuals with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor.
Substitution of plant protein for animal protein, especially that from processed red meat, was
associated with lower mortality, suggesting the importance of protein source.

efining what represents a macronutritionally bal-
anced diet remains an open question and a high pri-
ority in nutrition research.1,2 In short-term random-
ized clinical trials, substitution of protein for carbohydrate has
beenshowntofavorweightmanagement,decreasebloodpres-
sure,andimprovecardiometabolicbiomarkers,includingblood
lipid and lipoprotein profiles and glycemic regulation.3-5 These
beneficial effects are partly dependent on weight loss and pos-
sibly owing to the enhanced postprandial satiety and energy
expenditure when exchanging protein for carbohydrate.6
Therefore, high-protein and low-carbohydrate diets have been
promoted for weight loss and health improvement. Although
theamountandtypeofproteinmayhavespecificeffects,7such
as insulinlike growth factor 1 levels,8 from a broader dietary
perspective, the choice of protein sources will inevitably in-
fluence other components of diet, including macronutrients,
micronutrients, and phytochemicals, that can in turn influ-
ence health outcomes. Therefore, taking into account food
sources is critical to better understand the health effect of
protein intake and fine-tune dietary recommendations.
To date, data examining protein sources in relation to mor-
tality are sparse. Although no association was found between
animal or plant protein and all-cause mortality in a cohort of
postmenopausal women, substitution of plant protein for ani-
mal protein was associated with lower mortality due to cardio-
vascular disease (CVD).9 A positive association between ani-
mal protein and mortality was also found in the other study
using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.8
Nevertheless, these data are far from conclusive owing to sev-
erallimitations,includingtherelativelysmallsamplesize,single
assessment of diet at baseline, and lack of data on detailed food
sources of animal and plant protein. Therefore, we used data
from 2 large US cohort studies with repeated measures of diet
and up to 32 years of follow-up to prospectively examine ani-
mal protein vs plant protein in relation to the risk for all-cause
and cause-specific mortality and to perform an isocaloric
substitution analysis for a variety of food sources of protein.
Methods
Study Population
The Nurses’Health Study (NHS)10 included 121 700 US regis-
tered female nurses who were aged 30 to 55 years in 1976; for
this study, data were collected from 1980 to June 1, 2012. The
Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS)11 included 51 529
USmalehealthcareprofessionalswhowereaged40to75years
in 1986; data were collected from 1986 to January 31, 2012. De-
tailsofthe2cohortshavebeendescribedelsewhere.10,11Briefly,
follow-up questionnaires were administered at baseline en-
rollment and every 2 years thereafter to collect lifestyle and
medical information. Dietary intake was assessed by the food
frequency questionnaires (FFQs) every 4 years. The fol-
low-up rates were 95.4% in the NHS and 95.9% in the HPFS.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board at the Brigham and Women’
s Hospital and the Harvard
T. H. Chan School of Public Health. All participants provided
written informed consent.
Among participants who returned baseline question-
naires, we excluded those who had a history of cancer (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer), CVD, or diabetes at baseline, left
more than 10 items blank on the baseline FFQ in the NHS and
more than 70 items blank in the HPFS, or reported implausible
energy intake levels (<500 or >3500 kcal/d for women, or <800
or >4200 kcal/d for men). After exclusions, 85 013 women and
46 329 men were available for the analysis.
Dietary Assessment
In each FFQ, participants were asked how often, on average,
they consumed a standardized portion size of each food dur-
ing the previous year. The mean daily nutrient intake was cal-
culatedbymultiplyingtheconsumptionfrequencyofeachfood
itembyitsnutrientcontentandthensummingacrossallfoods.
Animal and plant protein intake was expressed as a percent-
age of total energy consumption. Major sources of animal pro-
tein included processed and unprocessed red meat, poultry,
dairy products, fish, and egg. Major food contributors to plant
protein included bread, cereals, pasta, nuts, beans, and le-
gumes. We derived protein intake from processed red meat by
summingtheproductsbetweenintakefrequency(servingsper
day) and the protein content (grams per serving) for various
processed red meats (ie, bacon, beef or pork hot dogs, salami,
bologna or other processed meat sandwiches, other pro-
cessed meats [eg, sausage, kielbasa]). Similar calculations
were performed for protein intake from unprocessed red meat,
poultry, fish, egg, and dairy. Food frequency questionnaires
have demonstrated good validity in assessing protein intake.
The Spearman correlation coefficient of intake assessed by
the FFQs and 7-day dietary record was 0.56 for animal pro-
tein and 0.66 for plant protein,12 as detailed in eMethods in
the Supplement.
Ascertainment of Death
We identified deaths from state statistics records, the Na-
tional Death Index, next of kin, and the postal system. Using
these methods, we were able to ascertain more than 96% of
the deaths in each cohort.13 Cause of death was identified from
death certificates or review of medical records by physicians.
For this analysis, we assessed all-cause mortality and deaths
due to CVD (International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Re-
vision, codes 390-458), cancer (International Classification of
Diseases, Eighth Revision, codes 140 to 207), and other causes.
Key Points
Question What is the association of the source of protein intake
with mortality in US adults?
Findings In this cohort study, high intake of animal protein was
positively associated with mortality, with the inverse true for high
intake of plant protein, especially among individuals with at least
1 lifestyle risk factor. Replacement of animal protein with plant
protein was associated with lower mortality, suggesting the
importance of protein source.
Meaning Public health recommendations should focus on
improvement of protein sources.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from June 20, 2014, to January 18, 2016.
We calculated person-time of follow-up for each participant
from the age in months at the return date of the baseline FFQ
(1980 for the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS) until the age in
months at the date of death, loss to follow-up, or end of
follow-up (June 1, 2012, for the NHS and January 31, 2012, for
the HPFS), whichever came first. We used time-varying Cox
proportional hazards regression models with age as the time
scale to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for mortal-
ity associated with animal and plant protein intake.
To reduce random within-person variation and to best rep-
resent long-term dietary intake, we calculated the cumula-
tivemeanproteinintakefromourrepeatedFFQs.14Westopped
updating dietary information when a participant reported a di-
agnosis of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), diabe-
tes, stroke, coronary heart disease, or angina, because these
conditions may lead to dietary change.15
Weusedanutrientdensitymodelwithadjustmentfortotal
energy intake and the percentage of energy from various fats
(saturated,polyunsaturated,monounsaturated,andtrans-fat).16
Thus, the coefficient for animal and plant protein reflects the
substitution effect of an equal amount of energy from protein
for carbohydrate. In the multivariable analysis, we further ad-
justedforseveralpotentialdietaryandlifestyleconfoundingfac-
tors,includingmultivitaminuse,smokingstatus,pack-yearsof
smoking,bodymassindex,physicalactivity,alcoholconsump-
tion, history of hypertension diagnosis, glycemic index, and
intake of whole grains, total fiber, fruits, and vegetables. To
address the possibility of residual confounding, we further ad-
justed for a propensity score that reflected associations of pro-
tein consumption with potential confounding covariates.17
Detailsaboutcovariateassessmentandpropensityscoreanaly-
sis are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.
We performed stratified analyses by age and lifestyle fac-
tors and evaluated the interaction via a likelihood ratio test.
Tominimizetheconfoundingeffectandtestforpotentialmodi-
fication by an overall lifestyle pattern, we further performed
a stratified analysis according to a priori–defined healthy life-
style pattern, as characterized by never smoking or ever smok-
ing for fewer than 5 pack-years, never or moderate alcohol in-
take (<14 g/d in women and <28 g/d in men), body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared) of at least 18.5 and less than 25.0, and physical
activity of at least 150 min/wk at a moderate level or at least
75 min/wk at a vigorous level (equivalent to ≥7.5 metabolic
equivalent h/wk) as recommended.18 Likewise, given the pre-
vious report that protein intake was associated with a higher
risk for diabetes-related mortality,8 we examined the protein-
mortality association according to the history of diabetes.
Finally, we estimated the effect of substituting 3% of en-
ergyfromplantproteinforanequivalentamountofanimalpro-
tein from various sources, including processed and unpro-
cessedredmeat,poultry,fish,egg,anddairy,bysimultaneously
including these protein items as continuous variables in the
multivariable model. The HRs and 95% CIs for the isoprotein
substitution effect were derived from the difference between
the regression coefficients, variance, and covariance.19
Theanalyseswerefirstconductedineachcohortseparately,
and because no appreciable difference was detected by cohort
(eTable 1 in the Supplement), we then conducted the pooled
analysisusingthesex-stratifiedCoxproportionalhazardsregres-
sion model in the combined data set. More details about statis-
tical analysis are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Results
In the 2 cohorts with 3 540 791 person-years of follow-up, we
documented 36 115 deaths, of which 8851 were due to CVD,
13 159 were due to cancer, and 14 105 were due to other causes.
Participants’median intake, as assessed by percentage of en-
ergy, was 14% (5th-95th percentile, 9%-22%) for animal pro-
teinand4%(5th-95thpercentile,2%-6%)forplantprotein.Ani-
mal protein intake decreased, whereas plant protein intake
increased over time throughout follow-up (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). Table 1 shows the basic characteristics of partici-
pants according to protein intake. Compared with participants
who consumed no more than 10% of energy from animal pro-
tein,thoseconsumingmorethan18%wereslightlyheavierand
less physically active and consumed more fats (especially satu-
rated fat) and less fiber and plant foods. In contrast, those with
higher plant protein intake demonstrated a clustering of posi-
tivehealthbehaviorsandhadasubstantiallyhealthierdietthan
those with lower plant protein consumption.
As shown in Table 2, higher intake of animal protein was
associated with higher CVD mortality. After adjusting for ma-
jor lifestyle and dietary risk factors, the HR per 10% incre-
mentofanimalproteinintakefromtotalenergyintakewas1.02
(95%CI,0.98-1.05;Pfortrend = .33)forall-causemortalityand
1.08 (95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P for trend = .04) for CVD mortality. In
contrast, a higher level of plant protein intake was associated
with lower mortality, with the multivariable HR per 3% incre-
ment of total energy intake of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95; P for
trend < .001) for all-cause mortality and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-
0.97; P for trend = .007) for CVD mortality. The associations
did not differ by duration of follow-up (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). We did not detect any statistically significant nonlin-
earrelationshipbetweenproteinintakeandmortalitybyspline
analysis (data not shown). The results remained largely
unchanged when we adjusted for a propensity score that
predicted protein intake levels (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Theincreasedmortalityassociatedwithhigheranimalpro-
tein intake was more pronounced among obese participants
(P for interaction = .008) and those with heavy alcohol in-
take(Pforinteraction = .06)(eFigure2intheSupplement).The
associationbetweenhigherplantproteinintakeandlowermor-
tality was stronger among participants who were 65 years or
younger or older than 80 years, currently smoked, consumed
at least 14 g/d of alcohol, were overweight or obese, and were
physically inactive (P for interaction ≤.02 for all).
Because most of the statistically significant associations
were seen among participants with an unhealthy lifestyle, we
further divided participants into healthy- and unhealthy-
lifestyle groups according to a priori–defined criteria. Table 3
shows the basic characteristics of the 2 groups. Participants in

the healthy-lifestyle group demonstrated slightly more ho-
mogeneous distributions in health behaviors than those in the
unhealthy-lifestyle group. At similar amounts of protein in-
take, protein sources differed between the 2 groups. Com-
pared with the healthy-lifestyle group, the unhealthy-
lifestyle group with similar animal protein intake consumed
more unprocessed and processed red meat, eggs, and high-
fatdairyproducts,butlesschicken,fish,andlow-fatdairyprod-
ucts.Atsimilaramountsofplantproteinintake,theunhealthy-
lifestylegroupconsumedlessfiber,fruit,vegetables,andwhole
grains than the healthy-lifestyle group.
Table 4 shows the associations of protein intake and mor-
tality in the 2 groups. The positive association with all-cause
mortality for animal protein intake and the inverse associa-
tion for plant protein intake were restricted to the unhealthy-
lifestyle group (P for interaction <.001), although the associa-
tion with animal protein intake did not reach statistical
significance. In the unhealthy-lifestyle group, the multivari-
able HR per 10% increment of animal protein was 1.03 (95%
CI, 0.99-1.07; P for trend = .16) and the HR per 3% increment
of plant protein was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P for
trend < .001). Similar results were observed for CVD mortal-
ity. When stratified by history of diabetes, the positive asso-
ciation with all-cause mortality for animal protein intake and
the inverse association for plant protein intake appeared to be
stronger among participants with diabetes than those with-
out diabetes (P for interaction = .06 and P for interaction .02,
respectively; eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Discussion
After adjusting for other dietary and lifestyle factors, animal
protein intake was associated with a higher risk for CVD mor-
tality, whereas higher plant protein intake was associated with
lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. However, in the
stratified analysis, these associations were confined to par-
ticipants with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor. Moreover, we ob-
servedthatsubstitutionofplantproteinforanimalproteinfrom
a variety of food sources, particularly processed red meat, was
associated with a lower risk for mortality, suggesting that the
protein source is important for long-term health.
Although short-term randomized clinical trials have
shown a beneficial effect of high protein intake,3,4,20,21 the
long-term health consequences of protein intake remain
controversial.8,9,22-25Inarandomizedclinicaltrialwitha2-year
intervention, 4 calorie-restricted diets with different macro-
nutrient compositions did not show a difference in the ef-
fects on weight loss or on improvement of lipid profiles and
insulin levels.26 When protein is substituted for other macro-
nutrients, the dietary source of protein appears to be a criti-
cal determinant of the outcome.
To our knowledge, only 2 cohort studies8,9 have examined
animalandplantproteinintakeinrelationtomortality.IntheIowa
Women’
sHealthStudy,9althoughneitheranimalnorplantpro-
teinwasassociatedwithall-causemortality,aninverseassocia-
tionwasfoundbetweenplantproteinandCVDmortality,andsub-
stituting plant protein for animal protein was associated with a
substantially lower CVD mortality. In a recent report from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III,8 higher
proteinintakewasrelatedtoanincreasedriskforall-causemor-
talityamongparticipantsyoungerthan65years.However,when
animal protein intake was controlled for, this association was
eliminated, suggesting that animal protein was responsible for
theeffectofhigherproteinintake,ifany,onincreasedmortality.
Although a direct comparison of these studies is difficult, given
thevariationinthestudymethods,27thesedatatogetherwithour
currentfindingssupporttheimportanceofproteinsourcesforthe
long-term health outcome and suggest that plants constitute a
preferred protein source compared with animal foods.

stitution of plant protein for animal protein has been related to
alowerincidenceofCVD36-39andtype2diabetes.40-42Moreover,
although a high intake of red meat, particularly processed red
meat, has been associated with increased mortality in a recent
meta-analysisof13cohortstudies,43highconsumptionofnuts,
a major contributor to plant protein, has been associated lower
CVDandall-causemortality.44Theseresultsunderscoretheim-
portanceofproteinsourcesforriskassessmentandsuggestthat
othercomponentsinprotein-richfoods(eg,sodium,45 nitrates,
and nitrites46 in processed red meat), in addition to protein
per se, may have a critical health effect.
Interestingly,inthisstudy,wefoundthattheassociationof
animal and plant protein with mortality varied by lifestyle
factors, and any statistically significant protein-mortality asso-
ciations were restricted to participants with at least 1 of the un-
healthybehaviors,includingsmoking,heavyalcoholintake,over-
weight or obesity, and physical inactivity. Several reasons may
explain these findings. First, given the remaining variation
of health behaviors across protein intake categories in the
unhealthy-lifestyle group, residual confounding from lifestyle
factors may contribute to the observed protein-mortality asso-
ciations.However,ourresultsarerobusttoadjustmentforawide
spectrumofpotentialconfoundersandthepropensityscore.Sec-
ond, our results suggest that the adverse effects of high animal
proteinintakeandbeneficialeffectsofplantproteinmaybeen-
hancedbyotherunhealthylifestylechoicesandbecomeevident
among the subgroup of individuals with these behaviors who
may already have had some underlying inflammatory or meta-
bolic disorders. Finally, as shown in Table 3, participants with a
similar intake and with and without a healthy lifestyle demon-
strateddistinctprofilesofproteinsources.Thosewithunhealthy
lifestylesconsumedmoreprocessedandunprocessedredmeat,
whereas the healthy-lifestyle group consumed more fish and
chickenasanimalproteinsources,suggestingthatdifferentpro-
tein sources, at least in part, contributed to the observed varia-
tion in the protein-mortality associations according to lifestyle
factors.Thishypothesisissupportedbyoursubstitutionanaly-
sisresults.Althoughsubstitutingplantfoodsforvariousanimal
foodswasassociatedwithalowermortality,redmeat,especially
processed red meat, showed a much stronger association than
fishandpoultry,whichthemselveswerenotassociatedwithmor-
tality(eTable6intheSupplement).Infact,proteinfromcertain
fish, such as cod, has been suggested to improve the lipid
profile, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity.35,47,48
The strengths of the present study included the large
sample size, repeated dietary assessments, and high fol-
low-up rate of the 2 well-established cohorts for up to 32 years.
Moreover, we collected detailed data on a wide spectrum of
lifestyle factors that allowed for rigorous confounding adjust-
ment and subgroup analysis. In addition, to facilitate public
health recommendations, we calculated protein intake ac-
cording to food sources and assessed the substitution effect
for protein of various origins.
A limitation of the study is the moderately higher protein
consumption (median, 19% of calories) in our study popula-
tion compared with the general US population (15%-16%),49,50
thus limiting our ability to assess the effect of the very low end
ofintake.Furthermore,asanobservationalstudy,residualcon-
founding could not be excluded. However, our results are ro-
bust to the multivariable adjustment and propensity score
analysis, and any confounding effect may have been mini-
mized in our stratified analysis according to lifestyle profile.
Conclusions
Although higher intake of animal protein was associated with
higher cardiovascular mortality and higher intake of plant pro-
tein was associated with lower mortality, these associations
were confined to participants with at least 1 lifestyle risk fac-
tor. Substitution of plant protein for animal protein, espe-
ciallyfromprocessedredmeat,mayconferasubstantialhealth
benefit. Therefore, public health recommendations should fo-
cus on improvement of protein sources.
