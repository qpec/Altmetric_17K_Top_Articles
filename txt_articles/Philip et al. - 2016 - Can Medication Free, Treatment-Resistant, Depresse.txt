Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is efficacious for acute treatment of re-
sistant major depressive disorder (MDD), but there is little information on maintenance TMS after acute
response.
Objective/hypothesis: This pilot feasibility study investigated 12-month outcomes comparing two mainte-
nance TMS approaches – a scheduled, single TMS session delivered monthly (SCH) vs. observation only (OBS).
Methods: Antidepressant-free patients with unipolar, non-psychotic, treatment-resistant MDD partici-
pated in a randomized, open-label, multisite trial. Patients meeting protocol-defined criteria for improvement
after six weeks of acute TMS were randomized to SCH or OBS regimens. TMS reintroduction was avail-
able for symptomatic worsening; all patients remained antidepressant-free during the trial.
Results: Sixty-seven patients enrolled in the acute phase, and 49 (73%) met randomization criteria. Groups
were matched, although more patients in the SCH group had failed ≥2 antidepressants (p = .035). There
were no significant group differences on any outcome measure. SCH patients had nonsignificantly longer
time to first TMS reintroduction, 91 ± 66 days, vs. OBS, 77 ± 52 days; OBS patients were nonsignificantly
more likely to need reintroduction (odds ratio = 1.21, 95% CI .38–3.89). Reintroduction lasted 14.3 ± 17.8
days (SCH) and 16.9 ± 18.9 days (OBS); 14/18 (78%) SCH and 17/27 (63%) OBS responded to reintroduc-
tion. Sixteen patients (32.7%) completed all 53 weeks of the study.
Conclusions: Maintaining treatment-resistant depressed patients off medications with periodic TMS appears
feasible in some cases. There was no statistical advantage of SCH vs. OBS, although SCH was associated
with a nonsignificantly longer time to relapse. Those who initially respond to TMS have a strong chance
of re-responding if relapse occurs.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic, and
serious psychiatric illness. Recurrent episodes occur in greater than
50% of patients, and it is this recurrence over the lifetime that con-
tributes to the substantial functional impairment associated with
this disorder [1,2]. Additionally, treatment-resistance is common in

 MDD. For example, the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve
Depression (STAR*D) study demonstrated that only one-third of pa-
tients achieved remission with a single antidepressant trial of
adequate dose and duration, and after multiple trials of antide-
pressants and multi-drug regimens, only two-thirds of patients
achieved remission [3]. STAR*D also reported that 40.1% of pa-
tients who achieved remission after failing their first antidepressant
experienced a relapse within 12 months of follow up [4]. Al-
though electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective acute
antidepressant treatment, with reports of up to 60% remission in
medication resistant patients, there remains a propensity for relapse;
in the community setting, over 50% of remitted patients relapse
within 6 months [5]. Thus, new approaches are needed for both acute
treatment and relapse prevention.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe and effica-
cious, noninvasive brain stimulation treatment for medication-
resistant MDD. To date, the acute efficacy of TMS is supported by
multiple double blind, randomized controlled trials [6–8] and a
recent meta-analysis [9]. The ideal method for maintaining benefit
for a patient who had an adequate response to an acute course of
TMS has not been determined. When considering strategies for sub-
sequent treatment with TMS, “reintroduction” of another acute
course (typically delivered 5 sessions/week with sometimes fewer
treatments in the series) should be distinguished from “mainte-
nance” TMS to prevent symptom recurrence, which involves the use
of regularly scheduled TMS treatments over an extended period of
time (e.g., weekly, biweekly, or monthly).
Reintroduction of adjunctive TMS in the face of threshold symp-
tomatic worsening was studied systematically in a large (n = 99)
prospective trial by Janicak et al. [10], which showed it effectively
restored prior level of symptom benefit for approximately 85% of
patients. The reintroduction protocol for that study involved TMS
delivered twice per week for two weeks, followed by escalation of
treatment frequency to 5/week for up to an additional 4 weeks, and
termination of the series when the global illness severity rating re-
turned to baseline. Demirtas-Tatlidede et al. [11] reported 4-year
outcomes for 16 unmedicated patients who responded to an initial
10-day acute course of TMS. Half benefited from reintroduction of
10-day courses of TMS reintroduced as needed, with an average in-
terval of nearly 5 months between courses.
As maintenance TMS has not been studied in a systematic
manner, there are no protocols to guide when to start mainte-
nance treatments, how often to schedule them, or the optimal
number of treatments over time. Evidence that maintenance TMS
treatments sustain symptom relief is described in reports from
studies that employed observational follow up periods up to six years
after successful acute treatment. However, interpretation of long-
term efficacy outcomes from the collective body of TMS literature
is limited owing to methodological variations across these studies,
i.e., all were open-label, few were prospective, some combined main-
tenance and reintroduction treatments, and most delivered TMS
concurrently with antidepressant pharmacotherapy (Table 1).
O’
Reardon et al. [12] retrospectively reviewed the charts of 10 pa-
tients for 6 months to 6 years with maintenance TMS treatments
at a nonstandard frequency (typically 1–2 per week) and ob-
served sustained marked benefit in 70%; 3 were maintained on TMS
monotherapy. Connolly et al. [13] reported on a retrospective anal-
yses of 42 (unipolar or bipolar) acute TMS responders who went
on to receive once monthly maintenance TMS in addition to stable
pharmacotherapy. Over 6 months, 62% maintained their level of de-
pressive symptom relief. Fitzgerald et al. [14] conducted a prospective
trial of monthly clustered TMS maintenance sessions (5 treat-
ments delivered over two days) in 35 patients who responded to
two prior acute courses of TMS. This approach substantially delayed
the onset of relapse, relative to the duration of wellness following
patients’prior acute TMS series.
Several TMS trials have included a transition from a series of acute
daily treatments to a continuation phase. For patients in these studies
who had already achieved response during the acute phase, the ad-
ditional weeks of continuation TMS treatments essentially
represented a maintenance regimen. Richieri et al. [15] examined
outcomes for acute TMS responders, using propensity analysis to
compare a group (n = 22) who did not receive any maintenance TMS
with a group (n = 37) who enrolled in a prospective maintenance
protocol that provided an extended taper phase (2 once-weekly TMS
sessions, followed by 2 bimonthly sessions, followed by 2 once-
monthly sessions). There was a statistically significant difference in
relapse rate (82% versus 38%) favoring the maintenance TMS group
at 20 weeks. Following 20 acute phase TMS sessions, the Levkovitz
et al. study [8] transitioned to a schedule of twice per week for 12
weeks. Comparison of week 5 and week 16 remission rates for those
who got active TMS (last observed values: 33% versus 32%, respec-
tively) suggest that the continuation regimen was associated with
sustained response over time, although there was a significant patient
dropout in the follow up phase. Harel et al. [16] transitioned pa-
tients to twice-weekly TMS for 8 weeks, followed by once-weekly
TMS for 10 weeks. Six of 12 acute responders (50%) in this study
remained responders at the end of 22 weeks.
The present study was undertaken as a pilot project to deter-
mine the feasibility and efficacy of providing scheduled, once-
monthly TMS versus observation only over a one-year period for
antidepressant-free subjects who had responded to an acute series
of TMS. This design permitted both groups’access to reintroduc-
tion treatments if needed for symptom re-emergence. Although in
clinical practice most subjects treated with TMS are also receiving
antidepressant pharmacotherapy, subjects in this study were an-
tidepressant medication free in order to isolate the effects of TMS
from the possible confounding effects of concomitant pharmaco-
therapy. The frequency of maintenance treatments was chosen based
on several factors. First, given the lack of a data on maintenance
schedules, we surveyed both academic and private practice TMS pro-
viders who provided an expert consensus of once-monthly TMS.

 Furthermore, this regimen was chosen to clearly distinguish main-
tenance TMS from continuation treatment or an extended taper. Most
prior TMS maintenance studies (Table 1) used treatments every other
week, and as such, made it impossible to evaluate whether ob-
served effects were due to prolonged durability of the acute
treatment or maintenance of effect and prevention of depressive
relapse.
Methods
Study subjects
Patients eligible to participate in the study were antidepressant-
free outpatient men or women, aged 18–70, meeting DSM-IV criteria
for MDD, single or recurrent type, with current episode duration of
at least 4 weeks but no longer than 3 years. Minimum symptom se-
verity for entry was moderate, as measured by the Clinical Global
Impressions Severity of Illness (CGI-S) [17] (total score ≥4) and a total
score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17)
[18] of at least 20. Patients had documented evidence of treatment
resistance in the current episode defined as the failure to receive
benefit from at least one but no more than four adequate trials of
antidepressant medication. Antidepressant resistance was estab-
lished by the Antidepressant Treatment Record (ATR, Neuronetics,
Inc., Malvern, PA), adapted from and validated against the research
version of the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) [19].
Patients were required to show symptom stability over one week
between screening and baseline visits with a minimum total HAMD17
score of 18 and ≤25% reduction from their score at the screening visit.
Exclusion criteria included depression secondary to a general
medical condition; history of substance abuse or dependence within
the past year; any psychotic disorder or major depression with psy-
chotic features; bipolar disorder; eating disorder (current or within
the past year); obsessive compulsive disorder (lifetime); or post-
traumatic stress disorder (current or within the past year). Also
excluded were individuals with an intracranial implant or any other
metal object within or near the head that could not be safely
removed; cardiac pacemakers; a clinically defined neurological dis-
order; an increased risk of seizure for any reason; history of failure
to respond to an adequate course of TMS or ECT for a major de-
pressive episode; and history of treatment with vagus nerve
stimulation.
Study overview
The study had three phases: a pre-study screening phase of 1
week with no treatment; an acute treatment phase consisting of
30 sessions of TMS administered 5 days per week for 6 weeks; and
randomization into a maintenance phase for those who met study-
defined response criteria (acute phase endpoint HAMD17 total score
<15 and had more than 25% improvement in total score HAMD17
compared with baseline). Investigators were blind to the criterion
for eligibility for randomization. Patients were randomized in a 1:1
manner to either: 1) SCH: a single TMS session once every four
weeks; or 2) OBS: observation only at each follow up visit. All ran-
domized patients underwent a three-week TMS taper, consistent
with the labeled use of the device (NeuroStar TMS Therapy System
User Manual, Neuronetics, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA). All treatments
were delivered open-label. Symptoms were assessed at each monthly
follow up visit in both SCH and OBS groups, and any patient meeting
criteria for symptom recurrence received reintroduction TMS.
Symptom recurrence mandating TMS reintroduction included a total
score on the HAMD17 ≥16 and ≥25% worsening from the HAMD17
score at entry into the maintenance phase. For patients meeting cri-
teria, TMS was provided in 5-day increments, up to a maximum of
30 TMS sessions (6 weeks). TMS reintroduction was discontinued
when a patient’
s HAMD17 score returned to the value observed at
the visit immediately prior to the first observation of clinical de-
terioration, after which patients resumed their previously assigned
maintenance schedule. Patients who did not achieve symptomatic
improvement after a complete 6 weeks of TMS reintroduction treat-
ment exited the study. TMS reintroduction could occur as often as
clinically required for discrete episodes of symptomatic worsening.
Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained at all sites.
After a complete description of the study procedures, written in-
formed consent was obtained from all subjects. The cost of treatment
sessions and associated direct clinical care were borne by the study
site, with material support from the sponsor for treatment related
supplies. The sponsor provided study physicians with a modest fi-
nancial remuneration on a contractual basis for study-related
document preparation and rating scale completion. Patients re-
ceived no direct financial compensation for participation.
Study locations, TMS device and clinical treatment parameters
Six sites with proficiency using TMS and experience in clinical
research participated in this study: three academic medical centers,
two private clinical practices, and one non-academic institutional
setting. All TMS treatments were delivered using the NeuroStar TMS
Therapy® system (Neuronetics, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA). Motor thresh-
old (MT) was determined over the left motor cortex at the initial
treatment session. An iterative, automatic, software-based math-
ematical algorithm (MT Assist®, Neuronetics, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA)
was used for MT level determination. Coordinates for placement of
the coil over the treatment location were calculated by the device
for a site 5.5 cm anterior from the MT location, along a left supe-
rior oblique plane. The standard treatment protocol was stimulation
at 120% of MT; at a pulse frequency of 10 pulses per second; and a
cycle of 4 seconds on (active stimulation) and 26 seconds off (no
stimulation). A single session contained 75 stimulation cycles, for
a total of 3000 pulses. These parameters remained unchanged
throughout the study.
Concomitant treatments
All patients were free of antidepressants or other psychotropic
medications except limited use of zaleplon, zolpidem, or eszopiclone
(1 dose nightly) as needed for treatment-emergent insomnia or
lorazepam (up to 2 mg daily) for treatment emergent anxiety. The
latter included up to 14 doses during the acute treatment phase,
and for up to 10 days on up to 8 occasions during the mainte-
nance phase.
Outcome measures
Clinical assessments were completed at baseline, at the end of
the 6-week acute phase, at the end of the 3-week taper, and every
four weeks thereafter during the maintenance phase. If TMS rein-
troduction was required, assessments were obtained at the end of
each 5-day block of TMS reintroduction. Efficacy measures in-
cluded the clinician-reported 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression (HAMD24) [20], the Montgomery–Asberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS) [21], the Clinical Global Impressions – Se-
verity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) [17], the patient-reported Inventory
of Depressive Symptoms – Self Report version (IDS-SR) [22], and
the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [23]. Clinical raters
were trained in the use of a structured interview for the HAMD24
and MADRS (Sackeim and Demitrack, available on request). The
17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) was derived
from the HAMD24.

 Safety was assessed by summary analysis of medically serious,
device-related adverse events or device malfunctions during the
study. The incidence of such events was compared with the inci-
dence ascertained from routine post-market surveillance data for
all NeuroStar TMS Therapy system devices installed in the United
States at the time of the study.
Statistical analysis
Primary objective
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of TMS ad-
ministered every four weeks by examining the proportion of patients
who had a sustained response throughout the 12-month mainte-
nance treatment phase. Sustained response was defined as not
requiring TMS reintroduction at any observation point during the
maintenance phase. The primary efficacy analysis was performed
on all patients randomized into the maintenance phase. For this cat-
egorical variable, logistic regression was used to model the odds for
persistence of response as a function of the assigned maintenance
treatment regimen. For continuous variables, analysis of variance
was employed with the factor of interest specified as the sole ex-
planatory variable in the model, and survival curves (censored for
dropouts) were plotted for time to first reintroduction.
Secondary objectives
Secondary objectives included categorical values for remission
(HAMD17 <8, HAMD24 <11) or recovery (MADRS <10) and re-
sponse (50% or more decrease from baseline score for MADRS,
HAMD24, and HAMD17). Other categorical values were the clini-
cian rated CGI-S (remission score <3, response score <4), the patient
rated PHQ-9 (remission score <5, response score <10) and patient
rated IDS-SR (remission score <15, response >50% reduction in score).
Reintroduction utilization was assessed by the number of TMS ses-
sions required, and average time to first TMS reintroduction,
compared between the two arms. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for acute phase remis-
sion and response rates, and need for reintroduction.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population
Demographic and clinical features of the study population are shown
in Table 2. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled with 49 (73.1%) com-
pleting acute treatment and meeting criteria for randomization. There
were a greater proportion of patients with higher levels of antidepres-
sant resistance (ATHF ≥ 2) in SCH group. Baseline symptom severity on
the HAMD17 was matched between groups, with symptoms in the
severe range. Reasons for study discontinuation are shown in Fig. 1.
Acute clinical outcomes
Of the 49 randomized patients, 23 were assigned into the SCH
group and 26 patients to the OBS group; 19/23 (82.6%) patients in
the SCH group and 23/26 (88.5%) in the OBS group met HAMD17 re-
mission criteria at time of randomization. The proportion of patients
who met response and remission criteria at randomization was similar
when using other rating scales (90.6%, 90.6% and 73.5% responders,
and 81.3%, 59.4% and 44.9% remitters, on the CGI-S, PHQ-9 and IDS-
SR, respectively), with an equal distribution of responders and
remitters assigned to each group. Odds of achieving remission in the
acute phase did not differ between groups (OR = .62, 95% CI 0.12–3.12).
Because all participants in the OBS group met criteria for clinical re-
sponse, calculation of the OR for response was not possible.
Maintenance therapy outcomes
Efficacy results for the continuous and categorical outcomes on
the HAMD17 across the maintenance phase are shown in Table 3,
and survival curves (censored for dropouts) are displayed in Fig. 2.
Of the 49 randomized patients, sixteen (32.7%) completed all 53
weeks of the study. There were no statistically significant group dif-
ferences in the primary outcome variable (i.e., the number of patients
who did not require TMS reintroduction), 9/23 (39%) in the SCH group
versus 9/26 (35%) in the OBS group (p > 0.1), or on any other outcome
variable. The odds of needing TMS reintroduction were nonsignifi-
cantly greater in the OBS group compared to the SCH group
(OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.38–3.89). Survival curves also found no signif-
icant differences in time to first retreatment (log-rank χ2 = 1.01, df = 1,
p > 0.1). There were no statistically significant group differences in
the number of patients who did not require TMS reintroduction:
9/23 (39%) patients in the SCH group vs. 9/26 (35%) in the OBS group
(p > 0.1). There was a mathematical, but not statistically signifi-
cant, difference in rates of study completion, with 10/23 (43%) in
the SCH group and 6/26 (23%) in the OBS group (p > 0.1). Efficacy
analysis using outcomes with the IDS-SR and PHQ-9 were similar
to those on the HAMD17, with no statistically significant group dif-
ferences (data not shown).
TMS reintroduction outcomes
TMS reintroduction was similar between groups during the main-
tenance phase (Table 4). Mean ± SD duration of time from the end
of the acute treatment series to first reintroduction was 91.2 ± 65.8
days for the SCH group and 77.1 ± 51.7 days for the OBS group. When
removing the taper phase following end of acute treatment series
from the calculation, the duration of initial benefit until first rein-
troduction was 69.9 ± 64.5 days for the SCH group and 56.0 ± 49.6
days for the OBS group. The number of retreatment TMS sessions
received by individual patients across the maintenance phase was
14.3 ± 17.8 in the SCH group and 16.9 ± 18.9 in the OBS group. When
including the taper phase treatments and regularly scheduled once-
monthly treatments along with all reintroduction treatments during
over the maintenance phase, the mean treatments per patient was
25.3 ± 16.7 for the SCH group and 27.5 ± 16.9 in the OBS group. The
reintroduction success rate (defined for each patient as return to
the HAMD17 score they reached at the end of acute treatment, or
better) was 14/18 (78%) for the SCH group versus 17/27 (63%) for
the OBS group. An exploratory analysis of demographic and clinical
characteristics, including age, gender, ATHF status, baseline HAMD17
score and end of acute treatment HAMD17 score was not predic-
tive for patients who required reintroduction TMS (data not shown).

 Safety
There were no serious device-related adverse events, no sei-
zures, no hospitalizations, and no suicide attempts reported during
the study. The risk of emergent suicidal ideation was evaluated post-
hoc for the acute and maintenance phases using Item 3 (Suicidality)
of the HAMD by determining the proportion of patients who in-
creased from a value of 0 or 1 at start of the phase to a value of 3
or 4 at any time during the phase. One patient overall had a tran-
sient increase in suicidality associated with worsening of depressive
symptoms during the post-acute treatment taper consistent with
loss of treatment benefit, which responded to TMS reintroduction.
Discussion
This pilot study in antidepressant-free patients with treatment-
resistant MDD who responded to an initial acute course of TMS
therapy involved an open-label, randomized design comparing two
maintenance regimens: once-monthly TMS versus observation only,
with all participants eligible to receive reintroduction TMS for protocol-
defined symptomatic worsening. We did not find an advantage for
once-monthly maintenance TMS treatments over observation, since
it did not significantly delay the time until reintroduction TMS was
needed or reduce the proportion of patients who needed retreatment.
While the experience of symptom re-emergence by the majority of
patients in this study may not be unexpected given the severity and
pharmacoresistence of depressive illness characterizing the patient
sample, we were able to confirm feasibility of using TMS monotherapy
over the course of one year. Even in the context of symptom re-
emergence during the one year of follow-up, medication free,
treatment-resistant, depressed patients who initially responded to
TMS were maintained off medications safely as there were no suicide
attempts or hospitalizations, and only a single patient had a tran-
sient increase in suicidal ideation.
While interpretations should be tempered by consideration of
the population studied, the relatively limited sample size, attrition

 rate and open-label design, we point to several numerical differ-
ences suggesting greater benefit from the SCH maintenance strategy
compared to OBS that may suggest a possible signal. Though re-
maining off all maintenance pharmacotherapy following initial
response to TMS may be a seldom-chosen strategy for this type of
patient receiving care in a naturalistic practice setting, for those who
may pursue such a strategy, our results indicate a maintenance TMS
schedule of only one treatment per month is not sufficient to prevent
return of depressive symptoms within the year.
The published literature describing scheduled maintenance TMS
for preventing recurrence of major depressive episodes is relative-
ly sparse (reviewed above in Table 1). While results arising from this
body of work indicates maintenance TMS is effective, their inter-
pretation is hindered by use of a variety of factors in both the acute
and maintenance phases that make it difficult to determine whether
specific parameters, scheduling intervals, or other aspects of their
protocols led to positive outcomes. Importantly, nearly every one
of these used concurrent TMS with antidepressant pharmaco-
therapy. Therefore, it is equally plausible to attribute their reported
outcomes to the enduring effects of the initial course of TMS, to
effects of antidepressant medications, or to the combination thereof.
A clear advantage of the current study was that it used a well-
established, effective, left prefrontal, high frequency TMS protocol
prospectively and systematically delivered to a medication-free pop-
ulation, allowing the observed outcomes to be uniquely attributable
to the TMS interventions. It is notable that in our study, TMS rein-
troduction was successful in rescuing most patients with threshold
deterioration and returning them to their prior level of depressive
symptom relief. This is an important observation given the chronic
and relapsing nature of pharmacoresistant major depression and
absence of definitive data suggesting that re-treatment with

 previously effective medications is capable of doing the same. On
this issue, our results provide support for a long-term treatment strat-
egy that incorporates retreatment with TMS for patients who showed
positive response to an initial acute course.
While not the a priori focus of this investigation, we noted a high
rate of remission (61.2%) from an acute series of TMS for the larger
sample of all enrolled antidepressant-free participants (prior to ran-
domization). For comparison, under similar open label treatment
conditions, Avery et al. [24] reported a 27.1% remission rate, and the
OPT-TMS study [25] reported a 29.6% remission rate. The patient
sample recruited in the current investigation was comparable with
regard to baseline depression scores and level of treatment resis-
tance to those who participated in these two trials, using the same
device and stimulation parameters. The current study required a full
6 weeks of acute treatments delivered five times per week, even if
remission occurred prior to treatment 30. Possible reasons behind
our observed acute phase outcomes include protocol-required com-
pletion of a fixed six-week acute course of TMS treatments, or factors
related to the open-label design of the study where physician and
participants likely knew that some degree of clinical improvement
was required to participate in the continuation portion of the study.
The data we gathered regarding durability of positive response
to the initial acute course of TMS (measured as days until threshold
symptom deterioration) produced results that were consistent with
prior TMS studies [10,26] and continue to suggest that approxi-
mately one-third of patients require reintroduction TMS treatments
during the year following successful acute treatment. Although di-
minished somewhat by a more stringent criterion for success (defined
as HAMD17 total score <15 and >25% improvement) and the absence
of maintenance pharmacotherapy in this trial, the data we gener-
ated are in line with previous work [10] showing the majority of
TMS responders benefit from TMS again if they relapse.
This study had several limitations. Most importantly, this pilot study
was powered not to be a definitive study but rather to provide pre-
liminary data that could inform future maintenance TMS study designs.
Another limitation was the significant attrition through the 12 months
of follow-up, which may be expected in a longitudinal study of
medication-free MDD patients with treatment-resistant illness. On the
other hand, it is informative that 32% of randomized patients com-
pleted the study despite an otherwise poor prognosis. This study also
had an imbalance in the distribution to the randomized groups, with
the scheduled treatment arm including a greater proportion of treat-
ment resistant subjects. This might have created a more difficult-to-
treat population in the monthly maintenance treatment arm. Another
limitation was the use of medication-free patients. While this was by
design, conducted to characterize long-term TMS outcomes in the
absence of the confounding presence of antidepressant medications,
it nonetheless limits the generalizability of these findings to clinical
populations who are rarely antidepressant free.
In summary, results from this study indicate that once-monthly
TMS is not superior to “watchful waiting” for antidepressant-free
MDD patients who responded to an acute TMS course. These results
suggest that TMS may require different, sequenced approaches for
maintenance. For example, this might include observation at first,
moving to prophylaxis or more frequent maintenance treatments
as a second stage and perhaps reserving combination with phar-
macology as a last step.
