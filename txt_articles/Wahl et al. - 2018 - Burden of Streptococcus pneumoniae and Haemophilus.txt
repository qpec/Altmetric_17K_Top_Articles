influenzae type b disease in children in the era of conjugate

Summary
Background Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine are now used in 
most countries. To monitor global and regional progress towards improving child health and to inform national 
policies for disease prevention and treatment, we prepared global, regional, and national disease burden estimates for 
these pathogens in children from 2000 to 2015.
Methods Using WHO and Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation collaboration country-specific estimates 
of pneumonia and meningitis mortality and pneumonia morbidity from 2000 to 2015, we applied pneumococcal 
and Hib cause-specific proportions to estimate pathogen-specific deaths and cases. Summary estimates of the 
proportion of pneumonia deaths and cases attributable to these pathogens were derived from four Hib vaccine and 
six PCV efficacy and effectiveness study values. The proportion of meningitis deaths due to each pathogen was 
derived from bacterial meningitis aetiology and adjusted pathogen-specific meningitis case–fatality data. 
Pneumococcal and Hib meningitis cases were inferred from modelled pathogen-specific meningitis deaths and 
literature-derived case–fatality estimates. Cases of pneumococcal and Hib syndromes other than pneumonia and 
meningitis were estimated using the ratio of pathogen-specific non-pneumonia, non-meningitis cases to pathogen-
specific meningitis cases from the literature. We accounted for annual HIV infection prevalence, access to care, 
and vaccine use.
Findings We estimated that there were 294 000 pneumococcal deaths (uncertainty range [UR] 192 000–366 000) and 
29 500 Hib deaths (18 400–40 700) in HIV-uninfected children aged 1–59 months in 2015. An additional 23 300 deaths 
(15 300–28 700) associated with pneumococcus and fewer than 1000 deaths associated Hib were estimated to have 
occurred in children infected with HIV. We estimate that pneumococcal deaths declined by 51% (7–74) and Hib 
deaths by 90% (78–96) from 2000 to 2015. Most children who died of pneumococcus (81%) and Hib (76%) presented 
with pneumonia. Less conservative assumptions result in  pneumococcccal death estimates that could be as high as 
515 000 deaths (302 000–609 000) in 2015. Approximately 50% of all pneumococcal deaths in 2015 occurred in four 
countries in Africa and Asia: India (68 700 deaths, UR 44 600–86 100), Nigeria (49 000 deaths, 32 400–59 000), the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (14 500 deaths, 9300–18 700), and Pakistan (14 400 deaths, 9700–17 000]). India 
(15 600 deaths, 9800–21 500), Nigeria (3600 deaths, 2200–5100), China (3400 deaths, 2300–4600), and South Sudan 
(1000 deaths, 600–1400) had the greatest number of Hib deaths in 2015. We estimated 3·7 million episodes 
(UR 2·7 million–4·3 million) of severe pneumococcus and 340 000 episodes (196 000–669 000) of severe Hib globally 
in children in 2015.
Interpretation The widespread use of Hib vaccine and the recent introduction of PCV in countries with high child 
mortality is associated with reductions in Hib and pneumococcal cases and deaths. Uncertainties in the burden of 
pneumococcal disease are largely driven by the fraction of pneumonia deaths attributable to pneumococcus. Progress 
towards further reducing the global burden of Hib and pneumococcal disease burden will depend on the efforts of a 
few large countries in Africa and Asia.

Introduction
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemo­
philus influenzae type b (Hib) are common causes of 
pneumonia, meningitis, and other serious infections in 
children. Pneumococcus was estimated to be responsible 
for 735 000 deaths in HIV-uninfected children and 
14·5 million total illnesses in children in 2000.1 Hib was 
estimated to have caused 363 000 deaths in HIV-uninfected

children and 8·1 million total episodes in children in the 
same year.2 These estimates represent the most recent, 
publicly available WHO national-level disease burden 
measures for these pathogens. Updated regional mortality 
estimates were published by WHO for 2008, estimating 
541 000 pneumococcal deaths and 203 000 Hib deaths 
that year.3
Several important vaccine developments have occurred 
since 2000. Protein-polysaccharide conjugate Hib vac 
cines 
are now included in the routine immunisation schedule of 
almost every country worldwide. By the end of 2015, 
129 countries, including 54 low-income and middle-income 
countries eligible for vaccine funding support from Gavi, 
the Vaccine Alliance, had introduced pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV); this number increased to 
141 countries by September, 2017
.4 Where Hib vaccine is 
used routinely with high coverage, virtual elimination of 
invasive Hib disease in children has occurred.5–7 Similarly, 
PCV has substantially reduced vaccine-type invasive 
pneumococcal disease among children.8–10
To measure progress towards reducing the burden 
of pneumococcal and Hib disease and inform the 
introduction and sustained use of prevention and 
treatment policies in the era of conjugate vaccines, we 
prepared annual modelled country-specific estimates of 
pneumococcal and Hib morbidity and mortality from 
2000 to 2015 in children aged 1–59 months using country-
specific data inputs whenever possible.
Methods
Conceptual models and inputs
We estimated annual pneumococcal and Hib deaths, 
cases, mortality rates, and incidence rates for each 
country from 2000 to 2015 for each of the three primary 
syndromes associated with these pathogens: pneu-
monia, meningitis, and invasive non-pneumonia, non-
meningitis (NPNM). We developed conceptual models 
for each syndrome (figure 1). For the pneumonia 
models, we identified PCV and Hib vaccine trials and 
effectiveness studies from a systematic review of the 
literature (see appendix pp 4–8 for search strategy) and 
a Cochrane review of PCV efficacy.11 We also updated a 
systematic review12 of pneumococcal and Hib invasive 
disease from 1980 to 2005 with published and 
unpublished data up to and including 2014 for the 
pathogen-specific meningitis and NPNM models. We 
searched six global databases (ie, PubMed, Embase, 
Biosis, Cochrane, Global Health, and Pascal) and five 
regional databases (ie, IMEMR, IMSEAR, LILACS, 
WHOLIS, and WPRIM) and followed the same quality 
assessment criteria described in the previously 
published literature review.12 We also used unpublished 
data from the Hib Rapid Assessment Tool and WHO 
Invasive Bacterial Disease surveillance network.13 Other 
model parameter values were obtained from publicly 
available sources or personal communication. We used 
state-specific input values for India whenever possible 
and developed subnational models to account for wide 
disparities across states in the country.
An independent expert committee and the Immunization 
and Vaccines Related Implementation Research Advisory 
Committee at WHO reviewed the conceptual models and 
inputs (appendix pp 33–34). A country consultation was 
undertaken by WHO to verify with country representatives 
the method 
ology and country-specific model inputs. 
Where evidence was unavailable or contradictory, we 
selected the most conservative approach that would be 
likely to under 
estimate disease. Our rationale was to 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study
We previously conducted a systematic review of invasive disease 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). On the basis of this review 
and using data from other sources, pneumococcus was estimated 
to be responsible for 735 000 deaths and Hib for 363 000 deaths 
in HIV-uninfected children in 2000. Updated estimates later 
published online for the year 2008 estimated that pneumococcus 
accounted for 541 000 deaths and Hib accounted for 
203 000 deaths that year. The Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation estimated that pneumococcus was responsible for 
393 000 pneumonia deaths and Hib for 59 000 pneumonia 
deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2015. 
Added value of this study 
We present updated national estimates of pneumococcal and 
Hib mortality and morbidity due to all syndromes associated 
with these pathogens (ie, pneumonia, meningitis, and other 
invasive diseases) from 2000 to 2015. These estimates 
incorporate new data from 67 studies published between 
2006 and 2014 that report on pathogen-specific meningitis 
case fatality and the distribution of meningitis cases by 
aetiology. Methods for estimating pneumococcal and Hib 
meningitis morbidity and mortality have been updated. To 
account for substantial within-country disease risk disparities, 
we developed India subnational pathogen-specific disease 
burden models for all syndromes associated with these 
pathogens for the first time. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
To our knowledge, the results presented here are the most 
up-to-date estimates available of pneumococcal and Hib 
mortality and morbidity attributable to all syndromes. These 
estimates highlight global progress towards reducing the 
morbidity and mortality associated with these two pathogens 
and indicate countries and regions where intensified 
prevention and treatment efforts are needed. They can be used 
to inform national child health intervention strategies.

minimise the likelihood that policy decisions would use 
overestimated burden estimates.
We report modelled pathogen-specific cases and deaths 
for each syndrome. Country-level results are available in 
the appendix (pp 36–145). Aetiology-specific deaths and 
cases, including country-specific estimates presented in 
the appendix, are modelled and not based on direct 
national reporting. We used world population estimates 
to calculate mortality and incidence rates reported as 
cases or deaths per 100 000 children aged 1–59 months. 
Population numbers were obtained from the United 
Nations Population Division.14 Global and regional 
results are the sum of country-specific estimates. Results 
for deaths and cases were rounded and reported with 
three significant digits or fewer; precision was not 
provided for fewer than 100 cases or deaths. Incidence 
and mortality rates were rounded to the nearest integer.
All analyses were done using Stata 14 (College Station, 
TX, USA). This analysis is compliant with the Guidelines 
for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(appendix p 35).15
Pathogen-specific pneumonia
To estimate aetiology-specific pneumonia deaths and 
cases, we applied aetiological fractions to annual, 
country-specific all-cause pneumonia deaths and 
cases prepared by WHO and the Maternal and 
Child Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE) collaboration 
(figure 1A).16 All-cause pneumonia estimates published 
by the WHO/MCEE collaboration already take into 
account immunisation with PCV and Hib vaccine. To 
avoid overestimating the vaccine effect, we adjusted all-
cause pneumonia deaths and cases to represent the 
burden of pneumonia that would have occurred had 
PCV and the Hib vaccine not been introduced. We 
assumed Hib pneumonia deaths and cases occurred 
only in children aged 1–23 months as described in the 
appendix (p 30).

We determined the proportion of all-cause pneumonia 
mortality and morbidity attributable to pneumococcus 
and Hib using the probe approach we previously 
developed and described.1,2 Briefly, we meta-analysed 
efficacy and effectiveness results from six PCV and four 
Hib vaccine randomised controlled trials and case-
control studies with random or systematic allocation of 
treatment with PCV17–25 and Hib vaccine26–30 and all-
cause pneumonia case definitions.31–33 Because vaccine 
trials and studies did not assess efficacy against 
pneumonia mortality, we used values of efficacy and 
effectiveness against radiography-confirmed, primary 
endpoint pneu 
monia (ie, consolidation),33 with relevant 
adjustments, to approx 
imate the proportion of pneu-
monia deaths caused by each pathogen. We used values 
of PCV and Hib vaccine efficacy and effectiveness 
against WHO-defined clinical and severe pneumonia30,32 
to estimate the contributions of each pathogen to these 
case definitions. Efficacy and effectiveness values were 
adjusted to account for incomplete efficacy against 
vaccine-type pneumonia. Because true efficacy values 
for vaccine-type pneumonia in children are not known, 
we used the observed efficacy against vaccine-type 
invasive disease for each trial as a proxy. For pneumo-
coccus, we estimated the degree of bias this proxy 
measure introduced by using two sensitivity analyses 
described in detail in the appendix (pp 27–29): 
(1) vaccine-type acute otitis media (AOM) efficacy and 
(2) the ratio of the vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type 
invasive pneumococcal disease to that of vaccine-type 
non-bacteraemic pneumo 
coccal pneumonia detected 
by a novel serotype-specific urinary antigen assay in a 
PCV trial34 done in Dutch adults older than 65 years. 
PCV efficacy values were also adjusted by the proportion 
of disease that was vaccine-type using invasive 
pneumococcal disease serotype distribution in the 
control group and by the proportion of pneumonia 
cases caused by Hib, because all PCV trials were done 
in the context of Hib vaccine.
Pathogen-specific meningitis
The conceptual model used to estimate pathogen-specific 
meningitis deaths was the same as for pathogen-specific 
pneumonia deaths (figure 1B). To calculate pathogen-
specific meningitis cases, we divided pathogen-specific 
meningitis deaths by country-specific and pathogen-
specific meningitis case–fatality ratio (CFR) estimates.
No studies were identified that reported the distribution 
of meningitis deaths by pathogen. We therefore used 
studies reporting the distribution of meningitis cases and 
adjusted these estimates by the relative pathogen-specific 
meningitis CFR to calculate the proportion of meningitis 
deaths due to pneumococcus and Hib, as described in the 
appendix (p 31). To estimate the proportion of meningitis 
cases due to each pathogen, we used data from 
observational studies because the aetiological diagnostic 
yield from investigations of meningitis cases is high when 
done with appropriate clinical and microbiological 
methods. Data from 98 studies reporting aetiologically 
confirmed bacterial meningitis cases attributable to 
common causes of bacterial meningitis were combined in 
random effects meta-analyses stratified by region.
We estimated pathogen-specific meningitis CFR using 
data from the systematic literature review (53 estimates 
for pneumococcus and 61 estimates for Hib), stratified by 
child mortality setting as previously defined: low 
(<30 deaths per 1000 livebirths), medium (30 to <75 deaths), 
high (75 to <150 deaths), and very high (≥150 deaths).1,2 
Because reported CFR values reflect mortality in children 
who access care at a study site or health facility, we 
adjusted CFR values to account for the higher CFR 
(ie, 90% for all pathogens, as recommended by the 
independent expert committee) assumed for those who 
did not access care. There is no measure of care-seeking 
for children with meningitis in standardised surveys; 
therefore, we used the proportion of children seeking 
care for pneumonia symptoms from Multiple Indicator 
Cluster Surveys and Demographic and Health Surveys as 
a proxy. We assumed 100% access to care in countries 
with low child mortality. We assumed a linear relationship 
between access to care over time to estimate for years 
missing data. In the three countries without access-to-
care data or the 24 countries with only 1 year of access-to-
care data from these datasets, we developed a generalised 
linear model to explain the relationship between child 
mortality and access to care so that we could extrapolate 
from countries with access-to-care data.
Pathogen-specific invasive NPNM
Pathogen-specific cases due to other invasive syndromes 
(eg, sepsis) were estimated using random effects meta-
analyses of the ratio of pathogen-specific NPNM cases to 
pathogen-specific meningitis cases reported from 
46 studies for pneumococcus and 28 studies for Hib 
studies (figure 1C). Analyses were stratified by child 
mortality setting and, for pneumococcus, by severe and 
non-severe cases. We estimated NPNM deaths by 
multiplying NPNM cases by NPNM CFR. The latter was 
derived for each pathogen by estimating the ratio of 
NPNM CFR to meningitis CFR by child mortality setting 
and applying the ratio to meningitis CFR estimates.
HIV prevalence
Children infected with HIV who die from any cause, 
including pneumococcus or Hib, are accounted for in 
HIV death estimates.16 We therefore estimated pneumo-
coccal and Hib deaths for each syndrome in HIV-infected 
children using annual estimates of HIV prevalence in 
children younger than 59 months of age provided by 
UNAIDS (personal communication with BW) and 
estimates of relative risk for invasive pneumococcal 
disease and invasive Hib disease in HIV-infected children 
from the supplemental material for previously published 
estimates.1,2 We assumed children on highly active 
 Articles

antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had the same risk of 
pneumococcal and Hib disease as did HIV-uninfected 
children. UNAIDS and the US President’s Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief provided the number of children on 
HAART therapy for 35 countries in 2015 (personal 
communication with BW). We assumed no HAART 
coverage in other countries.
Immunisation
We accounted for vaccine impact by subtracting the 
number of deaths and cases in children estimated to 
have been directly and indirectly protected by vaccination 
from the total number of pathogen-specific deaths and 
cases. Country-specific WHO and UNICEF Hib vaccine 
coverage estimates35 were adjusted to represent the 
annual proportion of children aged 1–23 months at 
risk of disease on the basis of the number of years 
after vaccine introduction and assuming no catch-up 
campaigns. For PCV, we stratified pneumococcal disease 
estimates by age on the basis of a review of its age 
distribution36 and applied vaccine coverage for each birth 
cohort to the corresponding estimate of pneumococcal 
disease for that age. Vaccine coverage estimates were 
combined with vaccine efficacy estimates and, in the case 
of PCV, regional estimates of disease serotype coverage 
by vaccine formulation prior to vaccine introduction4,37 to

estimate the proportion of children directly protected by 
vaccination. We used vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal 
disease efficacy and serotype coverage as proxies for 
vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia efficacy and 
the distribution of serotypes causing pneumococcal 
pneumonia, respectively.11,37
To estimate the herd protection associated with Hib 
vaccine in children, we used data from vaccine studies 
measuring the impact of Hib vaccine on invasive Hib 
disease and modelled the proportion of children 
protected on the basis of WHO and UNICEF coverage 
estimates using the same methods previously reported 
with updated model inputs.1,2 Although we were unable 
to make assumptions about herd immunity in the years 
following the introduction of PCV in the same way 
owing to too few datapoints, we assumed 95% of 
children were protected from vaccine-type pneumococcal 
disease 5 years or more after the introduction of PCV if 
reported vaccine coverage exceeded 65%.38 We also 
accounted for an increase in disease caused by non-
vaccine serotypes in countries where the seven-valent 
PCV product (PCV7) was used (ie, serotype replacement). 
For this, we used data from a systematic review38 
reporting the relative risk for non-vaccine-type invasive 
pneumococcal 
disease 
each 
year 
following 
the 
introduction of PCV7
. Because serotype replacement in 
invasive pneumococcal disease might underestimate 
the extent of replacement observed for pneumococcal 
pneumonia, we did a sensitivity analysis assuming full 
replacement by non-PCV7 serotypes for pneumococcal 
pneumonia. Summary estimates are not yet available 
for higher valency PCV products and so we did not 
account for serotype replacement when and where these 
vaccines were used.

Uncertainty
We estimated the uncertainty around our estimates 
using methods similar to previous analyses.1,2 For 
pathogen-specific pneumonia estimates, uncertainty 
intervals were based on a jack-knife, leave-one-study-out 
approach for the upper and lower bounds of the 
pneumococcal and Hib pneumonia fractions. For 
meningitis aetiology estimates, we determined the most 
conservative (ie, wide) uncertainty estimates for 
aetiological proportions on the basis of a jack-knife leave-
one-study-out analysis and reported confidence intervals 
from meta-analyses. Pathogen-specific NPNM morbidity 
and mortality uncertainty ranges were based on 
uncertainty from pathogen-specific meningitis models. 
We did not account for uncertainty in other model 
parameter values (ie, vaccine coverage or access to care) 
or all-cause mortality estimates.

Results
We estimated that pneumococcus was responsible for 
294 000 deaths (uncertainty range [UR] 192 000–366 000) 
in HIV-uninfected children in 2015 (table 1). An 
additional 23 300 (15 300–28 700) estimated pneumococcal 
deaths occurred in children with HIV
/AIDS in that year. 
Pneumococcal deaths in 2015 reflect a 51% (7–74) decline 
compared with 600 000 (396 000–733 000) pneumococcal 
deaths estimated to have occurred in HIV-uninfected 
children aged 1–59 months in 2000 (figure 2). 
Pneumococcal deaths in children infected with HIV 
declined by 75% from 2000 when there were 
approximately 95 200 deaths (61 200–114 000). Of all 
pneumococcal deaths in HIV-uninfected children in 
2015, pneumonia accounted for 81%, meningitis 
accounted for 12%, and NPNM accounted for 7% (table 1). 
The global mortality rate for pneumococcus in 2015 was 
45 deaths (29–56) per 100 000 children aged 1–59 months.
By the end of 2015, 129 countries were using PCV. 
Pneumococcal deaths declined most sharply between 
2010 and 2015, when the average annual reduction was 
8%, compared with just 3% from 2000 to 2010. After 2010, 
52 Gavi-eligible countries—many of them countries with 
the highest pneumococcal disease burden—introduced 
PCV in their national immunisation programmes. We 
estimated that PCV prevented 250 000 cumulative 
pneumococcal-related deaths from 2000 to 2015, with 
more than 95% of them prevented after 2010. A sensitivity 
analysis suggests that our adjustment for serotype 
replacement for PCV7 could overestimate averted deaths 
by 3100 deaths. Nevertheless, total pneumococcal deaths 
among HIV-uninfected children aged 1–59 months 
remained substantial in 2015, accounting for at least 11% 
(UR 7–13) of all mortality in that age group.
The updated proportion of radiography-confirmed 
pneumonia attributable to pneumococcus before account-
ing for vaccination, which included data from two 
additional studies,24,25 was estimated to be 34% (UR 24–36). 
Our sensitivity analysis using vaccine-type efficacy of 
AOM found the proportion could be as high as 51% 
(15–87). This assumes that the efficacy of PCV against 
vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia is as low as the 
efficacy of PCV against vaccine-type pneumococcal AOM. 
Furthermore, our second sensitivity analysis showed the 
proportion of radiography-confirmed pneumonia caused 
by pneumococcus could be as high as 65% (16–86) if the 
ratio of PCV efficacy against vaccine-type pneumococcal 
pneumonia to that of vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal 
disease in children is similar to that observed among the 
Dutch elderly population.34 We provide country-specific 
pneumococcal pneumonia mortality estimates using 
these sensitivity parameters in the appendix (pp 146–174).

the Congo (14 500 deaths, 9300–18 700), and Pakistan 
(14 400 deaths, 9700–17 000) had the most and accounted 
for half of all pneumococcal deaths in HIV-uninfected 
children in 2015 (figure 3), but only 29% of the global 
population aged 1–59 months. Among low-income and 
middle-income countries, Rwanda (93%), Peru (90%), 
El Salvador (89%), and Brazil (88%) had the greatest 
relative reductions in pneumococcal deaths from 2000 to 
2015 (appendix pp 36–71). Rwanda and Peru introduced 
PCV in 2009 and El Salvador and Brazil introduced PCV in 
2010. Chad (296, UR 193–367), Somalia (294, 184–386), and 
Angola (216, 148–248) had the highest pneumococcal 
mortality rates per 100 000 children aged 1–59 months.
We estimated 8·9 million cases (UR 7·7 million– 
10·6 million) of clinical pneumococcal pneumonia, 
irrespective of HIV status, in 2015—a reduction of 37% 
from 14·2 million cases (12·3 million–16·9 million) 
in 2000. We also estimated 3·5 million cases 
(2·6 million–4·0 million) of severe pneumococcal 
pneumonia in 2015, a reduction from 5·6 million cases 
(4·2 million–6·4 million) in 2000. We also estimated 
83 900 cases (36 100–169 000) of pneumococcal menin-
gitis in 2015 in children regardless of HIV status, 
providing a global incidence rate of 13 cases (5–26) 
per 100 000 children aged 1–59 months. Pneumococcal 
meningitis cases and deaths estimated for 2000 using 
our updated models were very similar to the previously 
published estimates.1 Pneumococcal NPNM contributed 
326 000 cases (142 000–653 000) in 2015, of which 22% 
were severe (table 1).
With regard to Hib, we estimated that there were 
29 500 (UR 18 400–40 700) Hib deaths in HIV-uninfected 
children aged 1–59 months in 2015, all of which 
we estimated to have occurred in children aged 
1–23 months. Hib was estimated to contribute to fewer 
than 1000 additional deaths in children infected with 
HIV (table 2). Of Hib deaths in HIV-uninfected children 
in 2015, 76% were due to pneumonia, 24% to meningitis, 
and less than 1% to NPNM (table 2). Hib deaths declined 
by 90% (78–96) from 2000, when there were an 
estimated 299 000 deaths (186 000–412 000) in HIV-
uninfected children (figure 2). The substantial decrease 
in Hib mortality corresponded with an increase in the 
number of countries using Hib vaccine between 2000 
(n=60) and 2015 (n=192). We estimated that Hib vaccine 
prevented approximately 1·2 million total deaths from 
2000 to 2015, not including the Hib deaths prevented in 
HIV-infected children.
Approximately 82% of all Hib deaths in HIV-uninfected 
children in 2015 (24 200 deaths, UR 15 000–33 400) 
occurred in the Africa and southeast Asia regions 
(figure 4), which together accounted for 51% of the child 
population in that year. The greatest reductions in Hib 
deaths from 2000 to 2015 were observed in the eastern 
Mediterranean (97%) and in the Americas (96%; 
appendix pp 72–107). The countries with the greatest 
number of total Hib deaths (excluding those in HIV-
infected children) in 2015 were India (15 600 deaths, 
9800–21 500), Nigeria (3600 deaths, 2200–5100), China 
(3400 deaths, 2300–4600), and South Sudan (1000 deaths, 
600–1400). The highest estimated Hib mortality rates per 
100 000 children aged 1–59 months in 2015 were in South 
Sudan (54, UR 33–75), Equatorial Guinea (43, 28–58), 
and Somalia (26, 14–37) (figure 4).
There 
were 
0·9 
million 
estimated 
cases 
(UR 0·9 million–1·5 million) of clinical Hib pneumonia 
in 2015, irrespective of HIV status. Of these, 298 000 
cases (179 000–602 000) were estimated to also be severe 
pneumonia. Assuming all Hib pneumonia deaths were 
among severe cases, the global inferred CFR was 8% 
(5–10) in 2015 for children not infected with HIV. We 
estimated 31 400 cases (13 400–50 800) of Hib meningitis

in children in 2015, including all children regardless 
of HIV status, corresponding to a global incidence of 
5 cases (2–8) of Hib meningitis per 100 000 children 
aged 1–59 months. The global Hib meningitis CFR, 
among HIV-uninfected children only, fell by almost half 
between 2000 and 2015, from 44% (18–68) in 2000 to 
23% (9–36) in 2015. We also estimated 10 000 severe 
cases (4300–16 200) of Hib NPNM in 2015.

estimates of pneumococcal and Hib disease burden 
since the estimates1,2 for the year 2000 published in 2009, 
as well as the first comprehensive regional and global 
burden estimates for these pathogens since they were 
updated for 2008.3 We estimated that pneumococcal and 
Hib deaths in children declined substantially in the era 
of conjugate vaccines.
Most pneumococcal and Hib deaths in 2015 were 
limited to a few countries in Africa and Asia. We estimated 
that four countries (India, Nigeria, China, and South 
Sudan) had more than 1000 Hib deaths in 2015. India and 
Nigeria introduced the Hib vaccine in 2011 and 2012, 
respectively; however, estimated national coverage in both 
countries was relatively low (ie, <50%) thereafter. South 
Sudan introduced the Hib vaccine in 2014. Hib deaths in 
these countries will probably decline as Hib vaccine 
coverage increases. China remained one of three 
countries that had not introduced Hib vaccine by 2015, 
along with Thailand and Russia. Likewise, half of 
global pneumococcal deaths in 2015 were limited to only 
four countries in Africa and Asia (India, Nigeria, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan). 
Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo intro-
duced PCV in 2012. Nigeria began routine immunisation 
with PCV in 2014 and India started routine use in 
three states in 2017
. Progress towards prevention of 
pneumococcal deaths in these countries will accelerate 
the global reduction in pneumococcal deaths.
The syndromic distribution of pneumococcal and Hib 
deaths was dominated by pneumonia, underscoring that 
disease burden estimates for these pathogens are highly 
sensitive to changes in all-cause pneumonia deaths, which 
are an independent input value in our pathogen-specific 
models. Given the low sensitivity of diagnostic tests for 
determining bacterial causes of pneumonia, we continued 
to use the probe approach to determine the fraction of

pneumonia cases caused by pneumococcus and Hib.1,2 
Our updated estimate of radiography-confirmed pneu-
monia cases attributable to pneumo 
coccus is similar to 
values estimated in previous models. Using this value as a 
proxy for the proportion of pneumonia deaths attributable 
to each pathogen inherently implies that the pneumonia 
CFR for radiography-confirmed pneumococcal pneu-
monia is equivalent to the CFR for radiography-confirmed 
Hib pneumonia, and that they are equal to the CFR 
for other causes of radiography-confirmed pneumonia. 
Globally, most (81%) pneumonia deaths are estimated to 
occur in the community,39 presumably with poor access to 
effective antibiotics. In such settings, the CFR of bacterial 
pneumonia is likely to be substantially higher than for 
non-bacterial pneumonia, revealing that our proxy method 
contributes to underestimating pneumococcal and Hib 
pneumonia deaths in settings of low access to care—the 
same settings that account for the greatest burden of 
pneumonia deaths.
We used vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease 
efficacy as a proxy for vaccine-type pneumococcal 
pneumonia efficacy when determining the proportion of 
pneumonia deaths caused by pneumococcus in the probe 
approach. This choice probably leads to an underestimate 
of the contribution of pneumococcus to pneumonia deaths 
and so we considered several alternatives. Based on the 
sensitivity analysis using vaccine-type AOM efficacy as the 
proxy value for vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia 
efficacy, pneumococcal pneumonia deaths could be as 
much as 51% higher than estimated by the base-case 
model. However, these results should be approached 
with caution as the efficacy against vaccine-type AOM 
is not likely to reflect the efficacy against vaccine-type 
pneumococcal pneumonia. Using vaccine-type non-
bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia efficacy in an 
elderly Dutch population34 as the relative proxy, the 
estimate 
of 
pneumococcal 
pneumonia 
deaths 
in 
children is twice that estimated by our base-case model. 
This method assumes the relative vaccine efficacy 
against bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic pneumococcal 
pneumonia in elderly people reflects the same ratio in 
children. However, there is little evidence to support this 
assertion. Furthermore, if the urine antigen test used to 
identify the non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia 
cases in the Dutch trial also detects antigenuria on the 
basis of vaccine-type pneumococcal nasopharyngeal 
colonisation, the observed efficacy value in that trial 
could reflect a contribution of vaccine efficacy against 
nasopharyngeal colonisation with vaccine-type pneumo-
coccus, which would probably be lower than the true 
vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia efficacy est 
imate.34 
The limitations associated with these sensitivity analyses 
contributed to our decision to use vaccine-type invasive 
pneumococcal disease efficacy in the base-case model.
Until highly specific diagnostic approaches for vaccine-
type non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia in 
children are available, the validity of these sensitivity 
analyses will remain unclear. Nevertheless, they do 
emphasise that our base-case estimates are very likely to 
be underestimates, possibly by as much as 100%. Our 
decision around which base-case analysis to use was also 
informed by consultation with external experts and a 
review of PCV impact studies with clinical pneumonia 
outcomes in several high-income and middle-income 
settings (appendix pp 22–23). Where parameter selection 
could not be grounded in clear evidence, we erred on the 
side of being conservative in our approach (ie, making 
decisions that would lead to an underestimate of disease 
burden). As evidence continues to accrue, we will 
revisit the assumptions in the base-case model. We have 
provided the results of the country-level pneumo 
coccal 
pneumonia estimates using the sensitivity analyses in the 
appendix (pp 146–74) to provide full access to the range of 
possible disease burden estimates for each country. 
Recently reported pneumo 
coccal pneumonia disease 
burden estimates for 2015 from the Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease 
collaboration 
use 
the 
vaccine-type 
pneumococcal 
pneumonia efficacy value in elderly people in their base-
case model.40 Consequently, pneumococcal pneumonia 
deaths estimated by the IHME—approximately 393 000 
in children aged 1–59 months—are greater in number 
than those presented here.
We prepared annual estimates of pneumococcal and Hib 
disease burden from 2000 to 2015, allowing us to make 
comparisons with previously published estimates. We 
previously estimated 735 000 pneumococcal deaths1 and 
363 000 Hib deaths in 2000 in HIV-uninfected children.2 
By comparison, we estimated 600 000 pneumo 
coccal 
deaths and 299 000 Hib deaths in 2000 excluding HIV-
infected children, using updated methods and new data. 
We observed similar differences comparing the current 
mortality estimates with those for the year 2008,3 which 
were generated using the original model with updated 
input values. Pathogen-specific URs for disease burden 
estimates for the years 2000 and 2008 from current and 
previously published methods overlap substantially. In 
addition, our validation for pneumo 
coccal disease 
(appendix p 177) suggests that our pneumococcal disease 
burden estimates are likely to be underestimated but 
within the confidence bounds. We were unable to validate 
the plausibility of our Hib cases and deaths because we 
found no other study that independently quantified the 
burden accounting for the poor diagnostic sensitivity.
All-cause child mortality has been decreasing in almost 
all low-income and middle-income countries as a result 
of vaccine and non-vaccine interventions.41,42 As this trend 
continues, morbidity associated with childhood illnesses, 
which is less affected by non-vaccine interventions, will 
play an increasingly important role in programme 
planning and policy making. We prepared country-
specific estimates of severe and non-severe disease 
associated with pneumococcus and Hib, which can be 
used for these purposes.

The availability of all-cause meningitis death estimates 
allowed us to shift from an incidence-based model to a 
proportion-based model. The motivation for this shift was 
to ensure that any pathogen-specific meningitis mortality 
estimates were inherently bounded by the total meningitis 
mortality. The sum of pathogen-specific death estimates 
derived using incidence data could theoretically exceed the 
total number of meningitis deaths. In addition, if the 
sensitivity of meningitis diagnostic tests is reasonably 
similar for each pathogen, using a relative distribution of 
pathogens (ie, our proportion-based method) could be less 
likely to underestimate the pathogen-specific burden of 
meningitis. We were unable to account for outbreaks of 
pneumococcal meningitis, which could lead to an 
underestimate of meningitis disease burden, particularly 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. To provide context to 
aetiology-specific meningitis death and case estimates 
derived using the proportion-based method, we also 
estimated pneumococcal and Hib meningitis mortality 
and morbidity using the incidence-based model (appendix 
pp 175–76).
Our pathogen-specific meningitis and NPNM models 
rely on data from a systematic literature review of studies 
published between 1990 and 2014. For the proportion-
based approach, we used studies that were conducted 
prior to the introduction of any conjugate vaccine. As 
most countries (n=192) were using Hib vaccine at the 
end of 2015, we anticipated very few additional studies 
would contribute data. Methods that do not rely on data 
from the era prior to the introduction of Hib vaccine will 
be needed to assess the burden of pneumococcal and 
Hib disease in the future.
Our model may have overestimated the impact of 
vaccination in children, particularly for PCV, due to the 
limited availability of data. We use country-specific 
vaccine coverage data from WHO and UNICEF. 
Reported coverage data have been observed to 
underestimate and overestimate coverage. The latter is 
more likely to occur when estimates are based on 
administrative data.43 As a result, our model could have 
overestimated the impact of vaccination. National 
vaccine coverage estimates can also mask regional and 
local coverage disparities. If those at risk of disease, 
independently of whether they received vaccine, are 
differentially reached by vaccination programmes, our 
model will overestimate the effect of immunisation. We 
also assumed serotype replacement for pneumococcal 
pneumonia to occur with the same frequency as 
invasive pneumococcal disease. We were also unable to 
account for serotype replacement in countries where 
PCV10 or PCV13 were routinely used. We probably 
overestimated vaccine impact in both cases. However, 
the extent to which vaccine impact is overestimated in 
any of these cases remains unknown. It is important to 
note that PCV and Hib vaccine probably provide 
protection to other age groups not included in this 
analysis.
These estimates should not be interpreted as a primary 
source of vaccine impact data and cannot be used to 
validate vaccine impact measured directly in the field as 
our models rely on assumptions of vaccine efficacy and 
effectiveness to estimate vaccine impact. However, our 
results can be used to emphasise the efforts of several 
organisations working to expand access to these vaccines. 
Our modelled estimates suggest an accelerated reduction 
in pneumococcal burden in the years after 2010 when the 
Advanced Market Commitment for PCV, a financing 
mechanism for the development of new vaccines, was 
launched by Gavi.44 The availability of funding for PCV in 
low-income and middle-income countries with the 
highest disease burden accelerated its adoption and 
therefore the reduction in pneumococcal deaths.
Pathogen-specific pneumonia and meningitis deaths 
are constrained by the all-cause pneumonia and 
meningitis death estimates produced by the WHO/
MCEE collaboration.16 Given that few deaths occur in 
countries with adequate vital registration systems, these 
estimates are based largely on verbal autopsy data. The 
potential for misclassification and other challenges 
associated with verbal autopsy studies, particularly for 
non-specific syndromes such as pneumonia, have been 
described extensively.45,46 Given the dependence of the 
present pathogen-specific mortality estimates on all-
cause pneumonia and meningitis deaths, advances in 
improving the confidence of cause of death estimates in 
high child-mortality settings would also positively affect 
pathogen-specific estimates.
Although we accounted for the increased risk of 
pneumococcal and Hib disease in children infected with 
HIV, we only accounted for the use of HAART among 
HIV-infected children in 35 countries in 2015. Studies 
have shown a marked reduction in pneumococcal disease 
in children younger than 18 years after the widespread use 
of HAART.47 Failing to account for HAART use in 
all countries probably leads to an overestimate of the 
pneumococcal and Hib disease burden in HIV-infected 
children. In addition, we were unable to account for HIV-
exposed but uninfected children who are at increased risk 
of morbidity and mortality from invasive pneumo 
coccal 
disease.48 Other than HIV, we were unable to account for 
other underlying risk factors for invasive bacterial 
diseases, including malaria infection49 and sickle cell 
anaemia.50 We assumed 0% Hib vaccine coverage 
for China: the vaccine is not used in the national 
immunisation programme; however, relatively high 
immunisation coverage through the private sector has 
been reported in some cities.51,52 We could not locate a 
reliable source of Hib vaccine coverage for the country. 
Although this would lead to an overestimate of disease, we 
believe those who would have access to the vaccine 
through the private sector would be at lower overall risk of 
disease compared with those without access to the vaccine. 
Despite these limitations, we believe the net effect of our 
estimates remains an underestimate of disease burden.

The burden of Hib disease is largely limited to a 
handful of countries that have not or only recently 
initiated routine use of Hib vaccine. Pneumococcal 
disease is beginning to decline substantially around the 
world, but still causes a large number of deaths and 
cases. The remaining burden of disease associated with 
these two pathogens warrants sustained and intensified 
efforts, including the introduction of vaccine in countries 
that have not yet introduced the vaccine and dedicated 
efforts to enhance coverage, particularly among children 
whose socioeconomic situation puts them at increased 
risk of disease.
