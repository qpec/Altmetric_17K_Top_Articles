Methods
and results
Using data from the prospective, multicentre Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation Myocardial

n = 12 675 STEMI patients who used emergency medical service transportation and were treated with primary percu-
taneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients were stratified by cardiogenic shock (CS) and out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest (OHCA). For patients treated within 60 to 180min from the first medical contact, we found a nearly linear
relationship between contact-to-balloon times and mortality in all four STEMI groups. In CS patients with no

OHCA, every 10-min treatment delay resulted in 3.31 additional deaths in 100 PCI-treated patients. This treatment
delay-related increase in mortality was significantly higher as compared to the two groups of OHCA patients with
shock (2.09) and without shock (1.34), as well as to haemodynamically stable patients (0.34, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions
In patients with CS, the time elapsing from the first medical contact to primary PCI is a strong predictor of an
adverse outcome. This patient group benefitted most from immediate PCI treatment, hence special efforts to
shorten contact-to-balloon time should be applied in particular to these high-risk STEMI patients.

Introduction
Ischaemic time duration is a major determinant of infarct size in
patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),
and prompt recognition and early management of acute STEMI is crit-
ical in reducing morbidity and mortality.1,2 Given the importance of
primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for mortality in
STEMI patients, the majority of clinical studies focus mainly on the
door-to-balloon time.3–12 In contrast to door-to-balloon time as a
potential quality marker for improved treatment protocols, much less
is known about the prognostic significance of first medical contact-to-
balloon time and of key components of pre-hospital delay on early
STEMI outcomes.13,14 Systematic studies investigating the impact of
pre-hospital ‘process of care’ factors on treatment delay and clinical
outcome are currently limited and, moreover, often biased due to
sampling errors which are related to different modes of presentation
to the hospital such as emergency medical service (EMS) transporta-
tion, inter-facility transport to a receiving PCI centre, and ambulatory
patient’s self-transport. In addition, the high incidence of out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) requiring instant cardiopulmonary
resuscitation as well as cardiogenic shock (CS) in STEMI patients may
impact on the transport time between first medical contact and arrival
at a PCI centre for coronary angioplasty. Currently, no data are avail-
able regarding the impact of contact-to-balloon time on mortality in
patients with CS and/or OHCA. Using data from the large and multi-
centre Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation
Myocardial Infarction (FITT-STEMI) trial, we addressed the prognostic
significance of treatment delay from first medical contact to coronary
reperfusion on short-term mortality in these high-risk patients.
Methods
Study design
The FITT-STEMI trial is an ongoing multicentre study to prospectively
determine the additional benefit of systematic and formalized data assess-
ment and interactive feedback on time to interventional treatment for
patients with STEMI. The primary aim of FITT-STEMI is to implement
standardized feedback-driven quality management for timely reperfusion
therapy in existing regional cardiac care networks for the treatment of
STEMI patients. Details on the study design, data collection, and outcome
measures including first clinical results have been described.15,16
Participation in the FITT-STEMI consortium required that all participating
hospitals endorsed the key strategies of the American College of
Cardiology initiative for the management of patients with STEMI,17 which
are the establishment of multidisciplinary treatment teams to develop
guideline-based written protocols for triaging and managing patients pre-
senting with symptoms suggestive of STEMI, activation of the catheteriza-
tion laboratory through a single-call system by the emergency
department physician, and prompt availability of a skilled cardiac interven-
tion team within 30min. Feedback quality control of the participating PCI
centres was performed quarterly during the first month of each quarter
beginning in the second quarter after joining the FITT-STEMI consortium.
Outcome data for each local study site were discussed on a regular basis
in interactive sessions with members of the participating interdisciplinary
treatment teams, including local EMS, physicians, and nurses working in
the emergency department and the emergency responding system, staff
members in the catheterization laboratory and interventional cardiolo-
gists. The formalized feedback presentations were prepared centrally by
the study initiator (K.H.S.) for use in regular site monitor visits and
included slide presentations on site-specific descriptive statistics regarding
clinical characteristics, times of transportation as well as procedural delays
during the time from the first medical contact to direct handoff in the car-
diac catheterization laboratory. In addition, the following pre-defined key
quality indicators were routinely assessed for each participating study site:
percentage of pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings within
and longer than 10min after the first medical contact (i.e. arrival-time of
EMS), percentage of patients with telephone announcement in advance,
proportion of patients with telemetry-ECG transmission, as well as aver-
age and median components of times to treatment, including those from
the first medical contact to balloon inflation.
Participating hospitals
Inclusion criteria for participating hospitals were 24-h PCI capability for at
least 1 year before study enrolment, at least two affiliated interventional
cardiologists who could take calls, and a minimum of 250 PCI procedures
per year with 50 annual procedures in STEMI patients. Study hospitals
joined the FITT-STEMI consortium at different points in time. The con-
sortium started off in 2006 consisting of one infarct treatment network
with a central PCI hospital and two referring non-PCI-capable hospitals.15
The study was extended to a group of six further STEMI-treatment net-
works at the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008.16 Since 2009 a num-
ber of new PCI hospitals have entered into the FITT-STEMI program
every year. At the end of 2015, a total of 48 hospitals scattered through-
out Germany participated in the consortium including five university

hospitals. The PCI hospitals are obligated to prospectively enrol without
exception all consecutive STEMI patients who presented within less than
24h after onset of symptoms. To ensure that all ECG-diagnosed STEMI
patients were included in the FITT-STEMI trial, written consent was
obtained from the responsible head of the cardiology department and/or
the interventional cardiologist in charge at each affiliated PCI hospital
before patient enrolment was started.
Completeness of patient enrolment was checked by comparing data
from two independent infarct surveys obtained from all participating PCI
hospitals: (i) insurance reimbursement data regarding the ICD-10
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems)
codes I21.0 to I21.3 (which included transmural infarction up to 28 days)
and (ii) data from the German Hospital Quality Report on PCI procedures
for the indication ‘ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) within
24 h after ECG diagnosis’ (also including subacute infarctions),18 which
was mandatory for all certified PCI-capable catheterization laboratories up
to the year 2016. These data checks showed that the percentages of annu-
ally included FITT-STEMI study participants among ICD-coded patients
with ‘transmural infarction’ (69.7± 6.8 percentage points) and patients reg-
istered by the German Hospital Quality Report (95.6± 11.5 percentage
points) were stable. Although the inclusion criteria differed between the
three data bases, the large overlap nevertheless underscored the integrity
of the enrolment strategy.
Data collection
Collected data included time of arrival on the scene and the durations of
out-of-hospital treatment, transport to the PCI centre, and transfer to the
catheterization laboratory as well as time of puncture and first balloon infla-
tion. For each patient, data were collected on a case-report form which
included clinical information on symptom onset, medical history, prior med-
ication, comorbid diagnoses, blood pressure, heart rate, Killip classification,
and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score for STEMI,
a commonly used and well-validated prognostication scheme categorizing
the patient’s risk of death.19 In addition, results from coronary angiography
and procedural critical time intervals were assessed. Cardiogenic shock
(Killip class IV) was confirmed by trained cardiologists at hospital admission
based on clinical criteria including hypotension (systolic blood pressure of
<90mmHg or the need for supportive measures to maintain a systolic
blood pressure of >
_90mmHg), signs of end-organ hypoperfusion, and a
heart rate of >
_60 beats/min.20 Patients with bystander cardiopulmonary
resuscitation were not excluded and were classified into the OHCA
groups. Similarly, patients with brain damage were not excluded from the
analysis, and pre-PCI fibrinolysis was not regarded as an exclusion criterion.
Transfer of data from each local study site to the principal coordinating
centre including data on in-hospital mortality was achieved using a web-
based electronic data transfer system allowing for independent monitoring
for data validation (‘source data verification’). The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty at the University of Go
¨ttingen
and the local ethics committees of all participating PCI centres.
Study participants
All patients presenting within 24h of symptom onset of STEMI
(n = 20 130) during 1 January 2006 to 30 November 2015, were included
in the FITT-STEMI trial. Study participants who had interfacility transferral
from a non-PCI-capable hospital to a receiving hospital with on-site PCI
(n = 3025), arrived at the interventional hospital by self-transport
(n = 2077), and suffered the infarction during in-hospital treatment at the
PCI hospital (n = 483) were excluded from the analysis to prevent selec-
tion bias with respect to both treatment times and mortality in these het-
erogeneous patient groups. The final study population comprised all
those STEMI patients with complete data who arrived at the primary PCI
hospital via EMS transportation and had treatment times of less than
360 min from arrival at the scene to balloon inflation (n = 12 675). A flow
diagram of the patient cohort is presented in Figure 1.
Statistical analysis
Raw time data were used to calculate the interval between first medical
contact and balloon inflation for each study patient. For some of the analy-
ses, the study cohort was classified along the guideline-recommended cut-
off level for contact-to-balloon time equal or less than 90min. Categorical
outcomes were compared between the two groups using the v2 tests.
Continuous data were reported as means and standard deviations and
were compared using the Student’s t-tests. In order to identify procedural
and clinical parameters that impacted on treatment time, we computed a
linear regression model using backward selection with contact-to-balloon
time as the dependent variable and a set of potential confounders known
to be associated with outcome. In addition, two logistic regression models
were calculated to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality
using either dichotomized or continuous data for contact-to-balloon time
as the independent variable. These models were adjusted for the following
potential confounders: age, sex, comorbid diabetes mellitus, hyperlipopro-
teinaemia, family history of MI, smoker status, chronic vessel occlusion in a
non-infarct-related coronary artery (NIRA), localization of the culprit cor-
onary artery, TIMI flow after PCI (score <
_2 vs. 3), as well as OHCA and
CS, including their interaction term. In additional models, TIMI risk score
was entered as an additional independent variable. The influence of hospi-
tal caseload on outcome was assessed using two independent approaches.
Estimation of hospital case volume was based on the mean number of
STEMI patients treated per quarter within each hospital over the entire
study period. Alternatively, the total number of quarters in the study in
which each PCI centre participated was used as an independent variable.
Model diagnostics based on generalized additive models suggested the
inclusion of a quadratic term for contact-to-balloon time when used as
continuous (non-dichotomized) predictor. The results from these regres-
sion analyses are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (95% CI). For the purpose of illustration, a linear trend was fitted to
predicted in-hospital mortality risks depending on contact-to-balloon
time, for contact-to-balloon times ranging from 60 to 180min. Within this
time interval, the predicted risks depended roughly linearly on the
contact-to-balloon time. The reported P-values are all two-sided, and P-
values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. No formal adjust-
ment for multiple testing was carried out. All statistical analyses were per-
formed on a personal computer using the statistical software SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Characterization of the study population
Of the 12 675 STEMI patients who received EMS transportation and
were treated with PCI, 144 patients had pre-PCI fibrinolysis (1.1%). As
temporary mechanical circulatory assist devices, intra-aortic balloon
counter-pulsation (IABP) was used in 339 patients (2.7%), while 114
(0.9%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygen-
ation (ECMO) and/or ventricular assist devices (VAD) (Table 1). The
majority (10 776; 85%) had no pre-hospital resuscitation and reached
the PCI hospital in stable condition. Among the resuscitated STEMI
patients (n = 1200, 9.5%), 369 patients had stable conditions and 831
patients presented with CS at the PCI hospital (Table 1). Another
group of 699 STEMI patients (5.5%) had no OHCA but presented
with CS. These four groups differed with respect to age, gender, and

risk-factor distribution, as a higher proportion of patients with OHCA
were male (78%) and, on average, younger (60.4± 12.3 and
61.3± 12.7years) and had less hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperli-
pidaemia, and family history of MI (for all, P < 0.0001). ST-segment ele-
vation myocardial infarction patients with CS and no OHCA were
older (67.2± 13.2years), had more diabetes mellitus and renal failure,
higher TIMI risk scores, and a higher proportion of multi-vessel and/or
left-main disease as compared to the three other groups (for all,
P < 0.0001). In-hospital mortality was lowest in haemodynamically sta-
ble patients (2.7%) and highest in CS patients with (45%) and without
(39%) OHCA. As compared to the two CS groups, mortality was
lower in patients presenting with OHCA and no CS (16%). The dem-
ographic, clinical, and cardiological data on the study cohort as strati-
fied by CS and OHCA are represented in Table 1. Supplementary
material online, Figure S1 demonstrates boxplots of contact-to-
balloon times stratified by the four groups.
Haemodynamic instability results in
treatment delay
Next, we performed a driver analysis by computing an estimate of
the importance of various independent clinical and procedural varia-
bles in predicting the time interval from the first medical contact to
reperfusion therapy. As expected, some procedural parameters
were associated with significantly shorter contact-to-balloon time.
Savings in contact-to-balloon time were on average 5.4min for
pre-hospital ECG, 17.5min for pre-announcement of the patient’s
transport by telephone, and 33.2 min for bypassing the emergency
department and direct transport to the catheterization laboratory
(for all P <
_ 0.0001; Table 2). Recording an ECG within the guideline-
recommended first 10 min after EMS arrival resulted in an additional
gain of 4.2 min in the time to reperfusion. In contrast, time to final
reperfusion therapy was prolonged in the case of hypertension
(3.2min), diabetes mellitus (4.3min), renal failure (6.8 min), and pre-
vious coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (11.4 min). Notably,
OHCA (17.3min) and CS upon hospital arrival (6.9 min) both signifi-
cantly contributed to system delay.
Contact-to-balloon time linked to
outcome
Among the total study cohort, there were n = 994 in-hospital deaths
(7.8%). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients with a contact-to-
balloon time of <
_90 min as compared to their counterparts with a
time to PCI treatment of >90min (3.9% vs. 12.2%, P < 0.0001,
Supplementary material online, Figure S2A). A particular high risk of
death was observed in the group of patients with contact-to-balloon
times ranging from 150 to 180 min, as one-fifth of all patients out of
this group died after PCI (20.0%, Supplementary material online,
Figure S2A). Patients with CS had a much higher mortality rate (645
deaths out of 1530; 42%) as compared to STEMI patients with no
clinical signs of haemodynamic instability (289 deaths of 10776
patients, 2.7%, P < 0.0001, Take home figure and Supplementary mate-
rial online, Figure S2B). In resuscitated patients with OHCA, there

was also a high mortality rate (432 deaths out of 1200; 36%). We
found pronounced beneficial effects on survival, when patients with
either CS or OHCA were treated within 90 min after first medical
contact (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36–0.66, P < 0.0001 and OR 0.56, 95% CI
0.38–0.82, P = 0.0031, respectively). By reducing the contact-to-
balloon time to less than 90min, one additional life could be saved
out of five patients treated with CS. However, this number needed
to treat was much higher in stable patients (one life additionally saved
out of 53 patients).
Effects of 10-min treatment delay
For contact-to-balloon times ranging from 60 to 180 min, we found a
nearly linear relationship between treatment time and mortality in all
four patients groups (Take home figure). Every 10-min treatment delay
resulted in 3.31 additional deaths in 100 PCI-treated CS patients with
no OHCA. This treatment delay-related increase in mortality was sig-
nificantly higher as compared to the two groups of OHCA patients
with (2.09) and without CS (1.34), as well as to haemodynamically
stable patients (0.34, P < 0.0001), respectively (Figure 2).

Impact of treatment delay on mortality
in adjusted models
Data from a stepwise multiple logistic regression model using in-
hospital mortality as dependent variable and guideline-recommended
contact-to-balloon time as independent variable adjusted for a variety
of clinical and procedural confounders confirmed the result from the
univariate analysis (Table 3). In this model, contact-to-balloon time of
<
_90min was a significant and independent predictor for better sur-
vival with an OR estimate of 0.57 (95% CI 0.47–0.70, P < 0.0001),
when adjusted for OHCA and CS. Using a model with continuous
instead of dichotomized data for contact-to-balloon time as a sensi-
tivity analysis, this result remained stable, thus confirming the signifi-
cant and independent predictive role of treatment delay on mortality
(P < 0.0001; Supplementary material online, Table S1).
In addition, the TIMI risk score was included as an independent var-
iable in a separate logistic regression model. Although higher TIMI
risk scores were significantly associated with poorer outcome
(P < 0.0010), the results demonstrated that contact-to-balloon time
of >90min remained a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality
(P < 0.0001). However, neither hospital caseload (P = 0.2979) nor
the duration of study participation per PCI centre (P = 0.6741) had
any significant impact on mortality (Supplementary material online,
Table S2).

Discussion
In this article, we present the outcome data from the prospective,
multicentre FITT-STEMI trial which was aimed at assessing the impact
of timeliness of invasive reperfusion therapy on in-hospital mortality
in patients with STEMI. Our results demonstrate that, in STEMI
patients, reduced contact-to-balloon time is associated with better
survival, regardless of the adverse haemodynamic consequences of
acute ischaemia-induced systolic dysfunction and cardiac arrest. We
found that longer intervals from the first medical contact to revascu-
larization enhance the risk of death, even when adjusted for OHCA
and CS, which both significantly delayed the time to interventional
treatment and were both linked to higher mortality. Most impor-
tantly, we observed that, in CS- and in OHCA patients, shorter times
to reperfusion considerably improved the outcome, with surprisingly
low mortality in OHCA patients in our study.
Our analysis of >12 500 STEMI patients demonstrates a steep
incremental increase in mortality resulting from longer times to PCI
treatment. One death among 12 STEMI patients can be prevented in
the total study cohort when the time from the first medical contact
to reperfusion is reduced to the guideline-recommended treatment
time to less than 90 min.21 As an important finding of our analysis,
STEMI patients with CS have substantially benefitted from early
reperfusion, regardless of whether or not OHCA had occurred.
However, the benefit of rapid revascularization was more pro-
nounced in the group of STEMI patients with CS who had not experi-
enced prior OHCA. For contact-to-balloon times ranging from 60 to
180 min, every 10-min treatment delay led to 3.3 additional deaths in
100 PCI-treated patients in this group. This treatment delay-related
increase in mortality rate within the early hours of infarction was 10-
fold higher in shock patients as compared to haemodynamically sta-
ble patients. Thus, our data clearly show the need for immediate PCI
treatment in STEMI patients with haemodynamic instability for whom
data on timely reperfusion therapy are currently not available.
The SHOCK investigators have published important studies
assessing the effects of revascularization within 36h of onset of MI in
patients with CS due to left ventricular failure complicating MI.20,22
They found that there was no benefit from early revascularization, as
the overall mortality at 30 days was not significantly reduced using
either PCI or CABG (152 patients) as compared to initial medical sta-
bilization (150 patients).20 However, there was statistically significant
mortality improvement at 6-month20 and 1-year follow-up.22 The
authors showed that restoration of coronary blood flow was a major
predictor of survival in patients with predominant left ventricular dys-
function.23,24 Trends in the use of early mechanical revascularization
for patients with acute MI complicated by CS obtained for the
National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) support this
observation.25 However, so far no data were available regarding the
impact of contact-to-balloon-time on mortality in patients with CS
complicating MI.
Another important finding of our study is that, in comparison to
OHCA patients presenting with CS, the mortality of OHCA patients
without CS was surprisingly low (45% vs. 16%). The observed low
mortality rate indicated that our study protocol allowed us to indeed
clearly distinguish between these two OHCA groups. We assume
that the ischaemia-induced loss of contractile myocardium is a pre-
requisite for the development of CS and appears to be the main
predictor of cardiac outcome, whereas potentially reversible arrhyth-
mic episodes can be successfully treated with instant defibrillation,
which may contribute to the comparably low mortality in the sub-
group of OHCA patients without shock. This assumption is sup-
ported by our group comparison (shown in Table 1), indicating
significant differences in angiographic findings, including chronic total
occlusion of a NIRA and TIMI angiographic flow rate before and after
PCI. The predictive role of these angiographic parameters was con-
firmed in our study cohort (Table 3).
Furthermore, we confirm that pre-hospital diagnosis of STEMI and
early notification of on-call cardiac catheterization teams by a physi-
cian trained in emergency medicine, who in Germany is a regular
member in the EMS transportation team, minimizes prognosis-
relevant delays in the time to PCI treatment, which results in a time
saving of more than 15min. Moreover, we observed significant time
saving benefits of nearly 10 min by recording an ECG within the rec-
ommended first 10min after arrival of the EMS transportation team
at the scene as compared to patients without a pre-clinical ECG,
which contributed to the improved outcome. This result is in good
agreement with data from the Acute Coronary Treatment and
Intervention Outcomes Network (ACTION) Registry-Get With The
Guidelines (GWTG) study showing that pre-hospital ECG use is
associated with a 10-min reduction in contact-to-balloon time.26 In
order to improve prognosis, pre-hospital ECG transmission and
STEMI identification linked to prompt activation of the cardiac cathe-
terization laboratory have been reported in some studies as a feasible
strategy to shorten the time from arrival at the hospital to reperfu-
sion.27–29 The benefit of early ECG recording on short-term survival
most probably accounts for faster decision processes during patient
management. This should be most important for STEMI patients with
CS and/or OHCA.
Limitations
Several issues merit consideration in the interpretation of the present
study. First and foremost, the data are observational and registry
based and, therefore, susceptible to unmeasured confounding and
selection bias such as resuscitation-specific variables (e.g. quality of
chest compressions), the use of additional treatments (e.g. therapeu-
tic hypothermia or pre-PCI fibrinolysis), or non-system reasons for
delay. Second, owing to the cross-sectional nature of the FITT-STEMI
trial, only in-hospital mortality was completely collected in this data-
base, while future investigations are needed to examine the associa-
tion with longitudinal outcomes at longer follow-up periods. Third, as
shown by our multivariate driver analysis, prolonged treatment times
resulted from serious clinical conditions. Thus, late arrival of very sick
STEMI patients could be the consequence of their serious clinical
conditions rather than the cause of increased hospital mortality,
which might be of relevance even within the groups of CS and
OHCA. Nevertheless, our logistic regression models indicated that
contact-to-balloon time was a strong and significant prognostic factor
independent of OHCA, CS, and other patient-related factors. The
validity of this important finding was strengthened by including TIMI
risk score as an additional independent variable. Fourth, no conclu-
sion about causality between the duration of contact-to-balloon time
and outcome can be reached from our observational study which
influences the generalizability of our results. Fifth, the findings from
our study conducted in Germany may not be directly applicable to

STEMI management care systems in other countries, in which exclu-
sively paramedics are part of the EMS transportation teams and not
physicians experienced in emergency medicine. The attendance of
both physicians and paramedics might have accounted for the benefi-
cial effects of shortened treatment times on survival seen in our
OHCA patients. Finally, it is unknown how the exclusion of formal-
ized data analysis and interactive feedback intervention would affect
the results from similar investigations, given that this approach was an
integral key element of the FITT-STEMI study design.
In summary, our data demonstrate that, in STEMI patients, the
time from first medical contact to primary PCI is strongly and inver-
sely linked to short-term survival. In addition, we show that CS
patients have maximum benefit from rapid reperfusion treatment
with short contact-to-balloon times. In this high-risk group, the treat-
ment delay-related increase in mortality was 10-fold higher as com-
pared to haemodynamically stable patients. Thus, our data suggest
that efforts to shorten the time to PCI therapy should be applied to
all STEMI patients, and that particularly patients with haemodynamic
instability may benefit most from future improvements in STEMI
treatment protocols.
