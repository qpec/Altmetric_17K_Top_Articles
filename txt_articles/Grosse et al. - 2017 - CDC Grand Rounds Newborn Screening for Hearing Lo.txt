Newborn screening is a public health program that benefits 
4 million U.S. infants every year by enabling early detection of 
serious conditions, thus affording the opportunity for timely 
intervention to optimize outcomes (1). States and other U.S. 
jurisdictions decide whether and how to regulate newborn 
screening practices. Most newborn screening is done through 
laboratory analyses of dried bloodspot specimens collected 
from newborns. Point-of-care newborn screening is typically 
performed before discharge from the birthing facility. The 
Recommended Uniform Screening Panel includes two point-
of-care conditions for newborn screening: hearing loss and 
critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). The objectives of 
point-of-care screening for these two conditions are early 
identification and intervention to improve neurodevelopment, 
most notably language and related skills among infants with 
permanent hearing loss, and to prevent death or severe dis-
ability resulting from delayed diagnosis of CCHD. Universal 
screening for hearing loss using otoacoustic emissions or auto-
mated auditory brainstem response was endorsed by the Joint 
Committee on Infant Hearing in 2000 and 2007* and was 
incorporated in the first Recommended Uniform Screening 
Panel in 2005. Screening for CCHD using pulse oximetry 
was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Heritable 
Disorders in Newborns and Children in 2010 based on an 
evidence review† and was added to the Recommended Uniform 
Screening Panel in 2011.§
Universal Screening for Hearing Loss
Permanent hearing loss present at birth affects approximately 
1.6 of every 1,000 infants in the United States (2). Early hearing 
detection and intervention (EHDI) programs at the state and 
federal levels promote a “1-3-6” plan that includes 1) screening 
all infants at age ≤1 month, 2) performing diagnostic audiologic 
evaluation of infants who do not pass screening at age ≤3 months, 
and 3) providing appropriate intervention for children with 
diagnosed hearing loss at age ≤6 months. Children with per-
manent hearing loss who receive intervention services before 
age 3–6 months have significantly better language development

than do children who do not receive services (3). Similarly, early 
diagnosis of hearing loss, starting with newborn screening, 
has been shown to reduce deficits in receptive and expressive 
language that occur in unscreened children who subsequently 
receive a clinical diagnosis of hearing loss (4).
Universal newborn hearing screening also can yield long-
term economic benefits (5). A prospective British cohort 
study that tracked groups of children with permanent bilateral 
hearing loss who were either screened soon after birth or later 
in infancy found that at school age, children in the newborn 
screening cohort had significantly better receptive language and 
substantially lower educational costs (6). Extrapolating from 
those data, a U.S. study estimated potential averted special 
education costs of approximately $200 million per year, which 
would largely offset the cost of hearing screening (7).
Statewide newborn hearing screening programs began to 
be established in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, all states had 
established publicly funded EHDI programs that provide 
1) technical assistance to providers, 2) support for families, 
and 3) data tracking to ensure receipt of services in accordance 
with the 1-3-6 goals. State EHDI programs receive technical 
assistance and funding from CDC or the Health Resources and 
Services Administration (HRSA). CDC provides funding to 
states to develop and implement data systems that help ensure 
that infants receive recommended screening, diagnosis, and 
intervention services. CDC also conducts an annual survey 
to assess progress toward achieving EHDI goals. In addition, 
CDC supports evaluation and research on long-term clinical 
outcomes and program effectiveness. HRSA provides funding 
and technical assistance to states to support quality improve-
ment activities, family engagement, and activities to reduce 
loss to follow-up of infants who do not pass the newborn 
hearing screening.
National EHDI data¶ have demonstrated improvements in 
the number of infants meeting the 1-3-6 goals. From 2000 
to 2014, the percentage of newborns who had documented 
newborn hearing screening increased from 52% to >97%, and 
the number of documented diagnoses of hearing loss follow-
ing screening increased sixfold, from 855 in 2000 to 6,163 in 
2014. Although almost all U.S. infants now undergo hearing 
screening soon after birth, infants who fail to pass screening do

not necessarily receive timely diagnostic evaluations or timely 
intervention services once they receive a diagnosis of permanent 
hearing loss. Therefore, EHDI programs focus on increasing 
the percentage of infants who meet the 3-month diagnostic 
evaluation and 6-month early intervention goals. Since 2005, 
states have reported aggregated data through the CDC Hearing 
Screening and Follow-up Survey on the numbers of infants 
successfully receiving those recommended services (2). From 
2005 to 2014, the percentage of infants who failed newborn 
hearing screening and who were documented by their state 
EHDI program as having received a completed diagnostic 
evaluation increased from 30% to 58%. Among infants with 
confirmation of hearing loss, documented enrollment in early 
intervention during the same period increased from 58% to 
65%. There have also been reductions in the number of infants 
lost to follow-up/lost to documentation (failure to report the 
results from hearing screening, rescreening, diagnostic services, 
or treatment services to the state EHDI program and the medi-
cal home), both overall and in selected states (2). For example, 
just 4.6% of infants who did not pass newborn hearing screen-
ing in Massachusetts in 2014 were lost to follow-up/lost to 
documentation, and 85% of infants with diagnosed hearing 
loss were documented to have received intervention services.
Further progress in the timely provision of newborn hear-
ing screening, diagnostic, and intervention services as well as 
improved standardization of data are possible through state-
based EHDI Information Systems (EHDI-IS). These EHDI-IS 
support the early identification of hearing loss and receipt of 
intervention by enabling state programs to document and track 
those infants not passing the newborn hearing screening and 
in need of follow-up services. CDC provides technical assis-
tance and funding to maintain and strengthen these systems. 
To improve the completeness and accuracy of reported data, 
CDC collaborated with state EHDI programs to develop a 
set of Functional Standards for EHDI-IS.** These standards 
specify technical and functional requirements for EHDI-IS 
and list data items considered important for tracking and 
surveillance by EHDI programs.
Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease
CCHD includes 12 structural heart disorders that prevent 
the heart from pumping blood normally to the body, resulting 
in a high likelihood of low blood oxygen saturation.†† CCHD 
screening relies on noninvasive pulse oximetry; diagnosis of 
CCHD requires evaluation by a specialist. CCHD occurs in 
approximately two of every 1000 births.§§ Infants with unde-
tected CCHD who are discharged from a birth hospital are

at risk for developing serious complications that could result 
in emergency readmission or death within the first few days 
or weeks of life. Although many cases of CCHD are detected 
prenatally or through clinical examination, infants who appear 
normal might be discharged home and subsequently undergo 
life-threatening crises. It has been estimated that before the 
introduction of newborn screening for CCHD, 70–100 
infants died each year in the United States from late-diagnosed 
CCHD (8). The cost of pulse oximetry screening is estimated 
to be $10–$15 per infant (9). Using conservative estimates of 
averted deaths and hospitalization costs, an economic analysis 
calculated that CCHD screening appears cost-effective relative 
to other services (10).
Newborn screening for CCHD has been implemented more 
recently than newborn hearing screening; the first state policies 
were adopted in 2011 (11). As of 2016, 48 states had laws or 
policies on CCHD screening. In contrast to long-established 
EHDI programs, CCHD screening programs are in the early 
stages of development, and no federal funding is available to 
support state CCHD screening activities. There is no national 
collection or analysis of CCHD screening data, and among 
states, data collection procedures differ. A HRSA-funded 
newborn screening technical assistance center has built a data 
repository and begun to collect information from states on 
newborns with CCHD who were identified by screening and 
had not received a prenatal or clinical diagnosis.
Many states have birth defects surveillance programs that 
collect information on children with various types of major 
birth defects, and some states with birth defects surveillance 
programs might have the capability to evaluate effectiveness 
of CCHD screening (12). New Jersey was the first state to 
implement mandatory statewide CCHD screening in all its 
birthing facilities on August 31, 2011 (13). One day after the 
requirement to screen all infants was implemented, a baby 
who did not pass CCHD screening was determined to have 
CCHD and underwent life-saving surgery with a successful 
outcome. Upon implementation in 2011, New Jersey assessed 
screening coverage through aggregate quarterly reports from 
all birthing facilities and collected information on all failed 
screens through a CCHD screening module built into the 
New Jersey Birth Defects Registry (NJBDR). The module 
captures clinical information needed to evaluate the unique 
contribution of screening to early identification of CCHD. 
Data from this module are reviewed monthly by NJBDR 
staff members, and follow-up with hospitals for clarification 
is conducted as needed. Confirmed records are then entered 
into a separate NJBDR analytic database. New Jersey now 
collects individual-level CCHD screening data on all live 
births through its electronic birth certificate and continues to 
ascertain detailed information on infants who fail the screen

through its CCHD module in the NJBDR. New Jersey’s high 
rate of screening coverage and successful ongoing use of the 
NJBDR have been achieved through employment of extensive 
education and training efforts. The key to the success of the 
New Jersey CCHD screening program has been collaboration 
among the NJBDR, hospitals, community partners, and the 
Office of Vital Statistics and Registry. More complete report-
ing of CCHD screening on all infants and linkage with birth 
defects surveillance systems are important for ensuring that all 
infants are screened, optimizing the screening algorithm and 
quantifying the contribution to improved health (12).
Universal CCHD screening continues to evolve. States have 
implemented various screening algorithms that are being evaluated 
for specific settings, such as births at high elevation or infants in 
neonatal intensive care units. Evaluation of the impact of CCHD 
screening on deaths from CCHD is also under way, using adminis-
trative data found in national linked infant birth and death records. 
Improved data collection will be crucial to assess the effectiveness 
and guide optimization of CCHD screening (14).
Challenges and New Directions in Point-of-Care 
Newborn Screening in the United States
EHDI is a mature point-of-care screening program that has 
demonstrated health and economic benefits. Lessons learned 
from EHDI can be applied to both CCHD screening and 
point-of-care newborn screening for other conditions that 
might be included in the Recommended Uniform Screening 
Panel in the future. The interface between public health and 
hospitals, health care providers, and families in point-of-care 
screening presents both challenges and opportunities across 
conditions (15). As demonstrated by EHDI, the data tracking 
and follow-up capacity of public health agencies can facilitate 
early identification of affected infants and ongoing coordina-
tion between families and clinical care systems. By promoting 
screening, timely diagnosis, and follow-up based on standard-
ized data systems, public health workers and agencies can play 
critical roles in enabling children with permanent hearing loss 
or CCHD to be healthy and reach their full potential.
