Study Objectives: To determine effects of yoga and aerobic exercise compared with usual activity on objective assessments of sleep in midlife women.
Methods: Secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial in the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) 
network conducted among 186 late transition and postmenopausal women aged 40–62 y with hot flashes. Women were randomized to 12 w of yoga, 
supervised aerobic exercise, or usual activity. The mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of change in actigraph sleep measures from each intervention group 
were compared to the usual activity group using linear regression models.
Results: Baseline values of the primary sleep measures for the entire sample were mean total sleep time (TST) = 407.5 ± 56.7 min; mean wake after sleep 
onset (WASO) = 54.6 ± 21.8 min; mean CV for WASO = 37.7 ± 18.7 and mean CV for number of long awakenings > 5 min = 81.5 ± 46.9. Changes in the 
actigraphic sleep outcomes from baseline to weeks 11–12 were small, and none differed between groups. In an exploratory analysis, women with baseline 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index higher than 8 had significantly reduced TST-CV following yoga compared with usual activity.
Conclusions: This study adds to the currently scant literature on objective sleep outcomes from yoga and aerobic exercise interventions for this population. 
Although small effects on self-reported sleep quality were previously reported, the interventions had no statistically significant effects on actigraph measures, 
except for potentially improved sleep stability with yoga in women with poor self-reported sleep quality.

INTRODUCTION
Women experiencing the menopausal transition and postmeno-
pause often complain of sleep disturbance. Yoga and exercise 
have been suggested as useful nonpharmacologic treatments 
for midlife women experiencing sleep disturbance, but evi-
dence regarding efficacy remains mixed and inconclusive. 
Several studies of yoga interventions for 8 to 16 w duration 
in women during and after menopause1–6 showed statistically 
significant within-group improvements in self-reported sleep 
outcomes.1–4 However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
failed to show significant improvements in self-reported sleep 
with yoga compared to gentle exercise,5 moderate-intensity 
walking,6 or usual care.6 Only one yoga RCT of midlife women 
required participants to meet clinical diagnostic criteria for 
insomnia and reported significant improvement in insomnia 
symptoms versus usual care.3 However, this study failed to 
detect a significant difference in self-reported insomnia symp-
toms between yoga and passive stretching, and also found

BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Yoga and exercise have 
been suggested as useful non-pharmacological treatments for 
midlife women experiencing sleep disturbance, but evidence 
regarding efficacy remains mixed and inconclusive. This study 
reports actigraphic sleep outcomes from a randomized controlled 
trial comparing 12 w of yoga, aerobic exercise, or usual care in 
women experiencing the menopausal transition or postmenopause 
with hot flashes.
Study Impact: Sleep disturbances were shown on baseline 
actigraphy sleep measures; however, yoga and aerobic exercise 
interventions did not significantly affect sleep measures. The limited 
body of current evidence does not support the efficacy of yoga or 
aerobic exercise for reducing sleep disturbance in women during the 
menopause transition or postmenopause with hot flashes. Future 
research should explore other approaches for improving sleep 
quality, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.

four RCTs comparing 4 to 12 mo of aerobic exercise,6–10 only 
one reported significant improvement in self-reported sleep 
quality compared to nonexercise controls.10 Analyses of per-
sons who improved in two of these studies showed that higher 
levels of exercise predicted greater improvement in sleep,7 but 
only among those exercising in the morning.9
The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for 
Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) research group compared 
12 w of yoga or aerobic exercise to usual activity on the pri-
mary outcomes of hot flashes in women in the late transition of 
menopause or postmenopause (N = 355).11,12 Although hot flash 
frequency and bother did not significantly improve in the inter-
vention groups versus controls, secondary outcomes of self-re-
ported sleep quality and insomnia severity were improved.11,12 
Yoga was associated with improvement in the global sleep 
quality score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, 
pre to post change = −0.5 relative to usual activity, p = 0.049) 
and a reduction in the Insomnia Severity Index score (ISI, pre 
to post change = −1.3 relative to usual activity, p = 0.007).11 
Similar changes in the PSQI (change = −0.8, p = 0.007) and ISI 
(change = −0.9, p = 0.025) were observed with aerobic exercise 
versus usual activity.12 These findings based on self-reported 
sleep provide modest support that yoga or exercise may im-
prove sleep quality in midlife women.
Analysis of objective sleep outcomes provides a comple-
mentary perspective to the subjective findings on the efficacy 
of yoga or aerobic exercise for improving sleep in midlife 
women with vasomotor symptoms. Objective sleep data are 
available from the MsFLASH yoga and aerobic exercise trial 
on a subset of participants who wore an actigraph during base-
line and prior to postintervention assessments (week 11–12).13 
Subjective sleep measures may change without a correspond-
ing improvement in objective measures. Evidence on objective 
sleep measures would inform the potential benefits of yoga 
and/or exercise for improving objective sleep quality midlife 
women with hot flashes. More importantly, multiday actigra-
phy data provide for analysis of sleep variability, a novel sleep 
outcome. Reduced night-to-night variability obtained from 
actigraphy could reflect improved sleep stability as an objec-
tive measure of sleep quality. As an example, an analysis of 
night-to-night variability showed significant differences in 
actigraphy measures between persons with no insomnia and 
those with chronic insomnia, suggesting that improved sleep 
stability may be an important outcome variable in insomnia 
trials.14 Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses to deter-
mine whether the mean values and variability of actigraphy-
derived sleep variables differed with yoga or aerobic exercise 
interventions versus usual activity. The paucity of objective 
sleep data in trials of interventions for midlife women with va-
somotor symptoms makes an analysis of actigraphy data from 
MsFLASH yoga and aerobic exercise study worthwhile.
METHODS
Study Design
MsFLASH study methods have been published,13,15 including 
the yoga and aerobic exercise trial.11,12 In brief, women in the 
late transition phase of menopause and postmenopause who 
qualified for participation were randomized to 12 w of yoga, 
aerobic exercise, or usual activity. The trial used a three-by-
two factorial design, and simultaneously randomized partici-
pants from across the three behavioral intervention groups to 
take either an omega-3 fish oil oral supplement or placebo. No 
self-reported sleep outcome differences were found between 
omega-3 fish oil and placebo capsules,16 such that this inter-
vention is not considered in the current analyses. Institutional 
Review Boards at each clinical site and the MsFLASH Data 
Coordinating Center approved the study. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent prior to completing any study 
procedures.
Interventions
The yoga intervention was based on the Viniyoga style, and 
included a variety of poses (restorative, inverted, twists, lat-
eral and forward bends) as well as a relaxing, meditative Yoga 
Nidra practice.11 The 12 weekly classes were 90 min long (at-
tended once weekly) and were taught by yoga instructors with 
at least 5 y of experience and 500 hours of training. A staff 
member attended every yoga class to monitor adherence to the 
instruction protocol. Classes were taught on an ongoing basis, 
but used three differing sequences of the poses to maintain 
interest. Women joined the classes as they were recruited. The 
participants were instructed to practice at home for 20 min 
daily on nonclass days, alternating between poses one day and 
Yoga Nidra the next day. They were given written instructions, 
a DVD with the three yoga sequences, a CD guiding Yoga Ni-
dra practice, and supportive yoga props (mat, blanket, strap, 
and bolster).
Participants in the aerobic exercise group attended 12 w 
of in-person training, with three weekly sessions.12 The ses-
sions typically lasted 40–60 min; the duration was based on 
the work load needed to achieve the target energy expendi-
ture goal, which progressed over the course of the program. 
The sessions were held at local fitness facilities and were su-
pervised by a trained certified exercise trainer. Women self-
selected the specific exercise (treadmill, elliptical trainer, or 
stationary bike) and exercised to a target heart rate based on 
heart rate reserve (50% to 60% in month 1, 60% to 70% there-
after). The aerobic exercise group was not asked to complete 
home practice sessions.
Eligibility, Screening, Randomization, Data Collection, 
and Blinding
Participant recruitment and data collection occurred at study 
sites in Indianapolis, Oakland, and Seattle. Eligibility criteria 
were: aged 40–62 y; in the menopausal transition or postmeno-
pause or had hysterectomy with follicle stimulating hormone 
levels higher than 20 mIU/mL and estradiol levels 50 pg/mL or 
lower; generally in good health; experiencing 14 or more hot 
flashes/night sweats per week (on 2-w screening diaries); and 
hot flashes rated as bothersome or severe on four or more occa-
sions/week. Exclusion criteria were: body mass index greater 
than 37 kg/m2; using hormonal medications (including contra-
ceptives) during the past month; use of any medications to treat 
hot flashes in the past month; any unstable medical condition;

current practice or use of one of the study interventions; con-
traindications for exercise or yoga; or major depressive episode 
in the past 3 mo. Subjects were not selected on the basis of 
insomnia or sleep disturbance symptoms.
Women were recruited by mass-mailing, using purchased 
lists and health plan enrollment files. Women who responded 
to the study invitation were screened by telephone, then com-
pleted screening questionnaires and 2-w vasomotor symptom 
diaries. Data collectors were blinded to intervention group 
allocation.
Following initial screening, participants completed an in-
person baseline study visit. Data collection included a blood 
draw, physiological assessment, and baseline questionnaires. 
Following the baseline visit, participants wore an actigraph 
and completed a 1-w vasomotor symptom and sleep diary. Of 
the 355 participants enrolled and randomized in the parent 
study, a subset of 207 women wore an actigraph. There were a 
limited number of devices available at each study site for this 
ancillary study, and the number of participants wearing the 
actigraph significantly differed by site: Indianapolis (n = 87) 
versus Oakland (n = 63) and Seattle (n = 57) (p = 0.001). Those 
who wore an actigraph at baseline were more highly educated 
than those who did not (p = 0.036), but characteristics did not 
otherwise differ. Following the 1-w baseline data collection, 
participants returned to the clinic. Subjects whose hot flashes 
and night sweats did not decline by more than 50% over the 
prior 2-w screening period were allocated to yoga, aerobic ex-
ercise, or usual activity in a 3:3:4 ratio. Randomization was 
conducted by the MsFLASH Data Coordinating Center using a 
dynamic balancing randomization algorithm to maintain com-
parability between the study groups across the clinical sites. 
Assessments were repeated at week 11–12, the final week of 
the intervention. Participants were compensated $50 after each 
clinic visit for a possible total of $150.
Measurements
Baseline Characteristics
Participants’ demographic characteristics, select health data (in-
cluding smoking history and alcohol use), and baseline symp-
toms were collected at the baseline visit, as described in a prior 
publication.13 In addition to basic demographic information, 
height and weight were measured to obtain body mass index. 
Baseline symptom assessment included the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder 7-item scale,17 the Patient Health Questionnaire 8-item 
scale (PHQ-8)18 to assess depression, the ISI,19 and the PSQI.20 
Global PSQI scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indi-
cating poorer sleep quality. Cutoff scores of 5 and 8 have been 
reported to indicate poor sleep quality;20,21 the higher cutoff 
point was used in exploratory analyses because of previous stud-
ies suggesting that self-reported sleep disturbance is common 
among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.22–24 Eighty 
percent of the women in this sample had a PSQI global score of 
greater than 5, and 49% had scores higher than 8.
Actigraphy
The primary sleep outcomes in these analyses included per-
cent change from baseline to 12 w in actigraphy-derived TST 
(total minutes asleep during time in bed [TIB]), WASO (time 
spent awake between initial sleep onset and final sleep offset), 
and number of long awakenings (LWAK = number of awaken-
ings longer than 5 min). Secondary sleep outcomes that were 
also examined and included percent change from baseline to 
12 w in sleep onset latency (time between bedtime and falling 
asleep) and sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed spent 
asleep = TST / TIB × 100).
Participants wore an actigraph (Actiwatch 2, Philips Respi-
ronics, Bend, OR) on the nondominant wrist. Activity counts 
were summed in 1-min epochs. The device also recorded pres-
ence and density of white light and marker data (participants 
were instructed to press the marker button on the side of the 
device at bedtime and rise time) that were used in the scoring 
of actigraphy data. Actigraphy data were scored in Actiware 5 
(Philips Respironics). Designation of the start and end of TIB 
was manually entered on each record by one of two trained 
technicians using a standard scoring algorithm codeveloped by 
one of the authors (DTB). Bedtimes and rise times were deter-
mined primarily from the participants’ sleep diaries. However, 
the scoring algorithm provided a hierarchy for using actigraph-
logged activity levels, actigraph-recorded light levels, and acti-
graph-recorded event markers to determine bedtimes and rise 
times when there was an observed mismatch between diary re-
corded bed/rise times and one or more of the actigraph-derived 
indicators. All scored records were visually inspected for ac-
curate scoring by an investigator with expertise in actigraphy 
(DTB). The scorers and reviewer were blind to intervention 
group assignment. Each epoch was scored as sleep or wake 
using the automated algorithm in Actiware 5, and the software 
generated the sleep variables (TST, WASO, sleep onset latency, 
and sleep efficiency). Because LWAK is not included in the 
Actiware software package, this was calculated using locally 
developed SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY) syntax.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 statistical software 
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The mean and variability values 
of the actigraphy outcomes were calculated from each week of 
actigraphy data – baseline and the last week of the intervention 
(week 11–12). To provide consistency for the variability analy-
ses,25 we included only women with 7 nights of actigraphy data 
at both assessment weeks: total n = 186, yoga n = 52, aerobic 
exercise n = 54, usual activity n = 80. The reduced number of 
participants was similar in each group (yoga n = 7, aerobic 
exercise n = 5, usual activity n = 6). Data loss occurred mainly 
from participant failure to wear the actigraph as directed or 
device malfunction.
Differences in intervention group characteristics at baseline 
were compared using analysis of variance or chi square (χ2) 
tests. Variability of actigraphy data was represented by the co-
efficient of variation (CV) of each sleep variable. The CV is 
calculated as the within-subject standard deviation divided by 
the within-subject mean multiplied by 100.26 This calculation 
allows comparison of variability between measures with dif-
ferent units; greater values indicate higher variability. Linear 
regression models were used to compare the primary outcomes 
and secondary outcomes for each intervention group relative

to the usual activity group. All analyses were adjusted for 
baseline values on each outcome as well as clinical site. All 
variables except TST-mean were right-skewed and were log-
transformed prior to analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was consid-
ered significant.
RESULTS
Baseline Measures
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean (± 
standard deviation) age was 54.9 ± 3.7 y. There were no sig-
nificant differences in baseline characteristics between the in-
tervention groups except that compared with usual activity, a 
lower proportion of participants in the aerobic exercise group 
had graduated college (p = 0.005) and mean alcohol consump-
tion per week was lower in the yoga group (p = 0.033). Most of 
the women were postmenopausal (82.2%). In all three groups 
at baseline, mean PSQI scores exceeded the threshold for sleep 
disturbance (higher than 5),20 and mean ISI scores were above 
the cutoff considered to indicate at least mild insomnia (8 or 
higher).19
Actigraphic Sleep Outcomes
Baseline sleep measures were: TST-mean, yoga, 400.6 ± 65.2, 
aerobic exercise, 412.3 ± 46.5, usual activity, 408.8 ± 57.3 min; 
WASO-mean, yoga, 53.2 ± 19.9, aerobic exercise, 54.5 ± 23.5, 
usual activity, 55.7 ± 22.1 min; WASO-CV, yoga, 40.4 ± 19.1, 
aerobic exercise, 36.1 ± 18.2, usual activity, 37.2 ± 18.7; and 
LWAK-CV, yoga, 75.8 ± 37.4, aerobic exercise, 84.2 ± 47.1, 
usual activity, 83.5 ± 52.3.
Week 11–12 actigraphy sleep measures are shown in Table 2, 
along with change scores from baseline. Participants in all 
three groups slept on average about 6.75 hours each night, with 
nearly 1 h of WASO and two to three long awakenings per 
night. Sleep efficiency was similar across groups. The mean 
or CV values of these sleep measures at baseline did not differ 
significantly across study groups. Comparisons of yoga and 
aerobic exercise to usual activity revealed no significant differ-
ences in the means or CVs of any change in the sleep measures 
from baseline to week 11–12 (Table 2).
We conducted analyses to explore whether the findings dif-
fered among those who were most adherent to the intervention 
or those who had poor sleep at baseline (i.e., two groups most 
likely to experience improvement). Adherence was defined 
as completion of at least 80% of the sessions (which included 
home practice sessions in the yoga group). There were no dif-
ferences on any outcome from baseline to week 11–12 between 
adherent yoga participants (n = 31, 60%) and adherent exercise 
participants (n = 45, 83%) versus the usual activity group.
Given that women were not selected on the basis of reported 
sleep disturbance or insomnia research criteria, we explored 
interactions between intervention group assignment and base-
line sleep quality (PSQI) or insomnia symptoms (ISI) scores 
in linear regression analyses. No interactions of ISI with treat-
ment group were statistically significant. In the yoga versus 
usual activity analyses, interactions between group and PSQI 
were statistically significant for LWAK-mean and TST-CV 
(p = 0.048 and 0.021, respectively). In the exercise versus usual 
activity analyses, interactions between group and PSQI were 
statistically significant for WASO-mean (p = 0.047).
We further explored these significant interactions in sub-
group analyses of participants with baseline PSQI scores 
higher than 821 (yoga, n = 21; exercise, n = 29; usual activity, 
n = 42). In the yoga versus usual care analysis, TST-CV was 
significantly lower in the yoga group: % Change (95% confi-
dence interval): −26.6 (−40.3, −9.7), p = 0.004 after adjusting 
for site and baseline TST-CV. None of the other PSQI analysis 
(LWAK-mean for yoga versus usual activity, WASO-mean for 
exercise versus usual activity) were statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Our findings showed that 12 w of yoga or aerobic exercise had 
no effects on actigraph sleep parameters in women in late-tran-
sition menopause and postmenopausal women with hot flashes. 
In this MsFLASH trial, changes in actigraph sleep measures 
were not observed despite modest but statistically significant 
improvements in self-reported sleep quality and insomnia 
symptoms in the exercise and yoga intervention arms.11,12 Al-
though women were not selected on the basis of sleep distur-
bance symptoms, mean baseline actigraph scores of sleep were 
beyond values often used to indicate poor sleep quality and 
at least mild insomnia, respectively. Nevertheless, change in 
mean actigraphy-derived sleep measures and values of sleep 
night-to-night variability were unaffected by the yoga or aer-
obic exercise interventions, each compared to usual activity. 
However, we found reduced variability in TST following yoga 
in women with baseline PSQI scores higher than 8, suggest-
ing that the women with self-reported poor sleep experienced 
improvement in sleep stability.
Studies of midlife women with hot flashes commonly show 
self-reported sleep disturbance,27,28 which the current study 
corroborates with actigraphy data. The baseline actigraphy 
measures in this study showed no difficulty falling asleep, but 
moderate amounts of WASO (54–57 min), along with mildly 
reduced sleep efficiency (85% to 86%). A sleep efficiency less 
than 85% is used as an arbitrary indicator of insomnia and more 
than 30 min of WASO is used as one indicator of insomnia. 
Women were also sleeping, on average, less than the recom-
mended minimum of at least 7 h/night for adults.29 Given that 
sleep disturbance was not an inclusion criterion for this study, 
the findings support the importance of assessing and address-
ing the symptoms of sleep disturbance and inadequate sleep in 
women during the menopause transition and postmenopause.
This study adds to the limited body of evidence on yoga 
for sleep in midlife women. With the increasing popularity of 
yoga as a mainstream form of exercise, it is important to evalu-
ate as it is recommended for treatment of symptoms such as 
hot flashes. Overall, the evidence from prior studies of self-
reported outcomes are mixed, tending to show within-group 
improvements with yoga,1,2,4 but no significant differences be-
tween yoga and control groups.4,6 To our knowledge, only one 
prior study of objective and subjective sleep outcomes from a 
yoga intervention for menopausal women reported reduced ISI

scores in the yoga group compared to usual activity group, but 
no improvements on polysomnography-derived parameters.3
Prior evidence of effects of aerobic exercise is also uncer-
tain. To our knowledge our study is among the first to report 
objective sleep outcomes from aerobic exercise in women in 
the late phase of the menopausal transition and postmenopause. 
As with yoga, findings from this MsFLASH trial showed small 
but significant improvements in self-reported sleep quality

DT Buchanan, CA Landis, C Hohensee, et al. Effects of Yoga and Exercise on Objective Sleep
and insomnia symptoms with aerobic exercise versus usual 
activity.12 These findings are similar to another study that 
reported significant improvement in sleep symptoms,10 but 
improvements in objective measures did not reach statistical 
significance. Several additional studies of aerobic exercise for 
menopausal women evaluated only self-reported outcomes, 
without objective measures, and found no significant differ-
ences between the intervention and control groups on self-re-
ported sleep outcomes.6–8
Overall, the current study adds objective evidence to prior 
studies using self-report, indicating that yoga and exercise in-
terventions do not appear to improve sleep duration or sleep 
continuity in midlife women selected on the basis of hot-flash 
frequency, and who had an average of 7.3 to 8 hot flashes per 
day.11,12 We had hypothesized that the variability in the sleep 
measures would be reduced after 12 w of a yoga or exercise 
intervention, but we found that the CVs of the sleep measures 
were unchanged from baseline. Reduced TST variability was 
observed in women with poor baseline sleep (PSQI higher than 
8), indicating a potential sleep-stabilizing effect of the yoga 
intervention.
High variability in actigraph-derived sleep duration has 
been associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and de-
creased well-being,26 and several studies have shown night-to-
night variability in sleep as a characteristic of insomnia.14,30 
The CV values at both baseline and week 11–12 in our study 
were similar to those reported in community-dwelling, rela-
tively healthy middle-aged and older women and men.25,26 The 
focus of this analysis was not on examining the extent of night-
to-night variability in relation to perceived sleep quality, hot 
flashes, or other baseline characteristics, but such an analysis 
would enhance understanding of the effect of sleep variability 
on symptoms and quality of life.
A limitation of this analysis could be that we did not account 
for the effects of hot flashes. However, prior analyses of the Ms-
FLASH yoga and aerobic exercise trial showed no effects of 
these interventions on hot flashes, yet small improvements in 
self-reported sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. The authors

DT Buchanan, CA Landis, C Hohensee, et al. Effects of Yoga and Exercise on Objective Sleep
interpreted these findings to suggest that complaints of poor sleep 
may be a function of age-related changes during the menopause 
transition.12 Another limitation is that the sample was restricted 
to women in late-transition menopause and postmenopausal 
women with hot flashes; thus, the effects of yoga and aerobic 
exercise on sleep may not be applicable to the broader popula-
tion of midlife women without hot flashes. Because of our inter-
est in studying possible changes in night-to-night variability we 
restricted the analyses to subjects with 7 nights of actigraphy 
data both on baseline and during the final intervention week. 
However, the small number of participants excluded from the 
final analyses was similar in the three intervention groups, sug-
gesting that the loss of participants with incomplete data was 
unlikely to have introduced bias into the analyses. Finally, the 
algorithm we used for determining bedtimes and rise times on 
actigraphy has not been validated, but use of our algorithm pro-
vided a consistent approach in the scoring of actigraphy data.
Strengths of this study include the randomized controlled 
trial, multisite study design, and the careful characterization and 
selection of women restricted to the late phase of the menopausal 
transition and postmenopause when hot flashes and sleep distur-
bance symptoms are high. In addition, rigorous procedures were 
used in the processing and scoring of the actigraph data.
In summary, no significant effects of yoga or aerobic exer-
cise on objectively measured sleep outcomes were observed 
among midlife women with hot flashes, although self-report 
improvements had been previously reported.11,12 There was 
some evidence of improved sleep stability with yoga in women 
with poor sleep quality on an exploratory analysis. At base-
line, actigraphy showed that on average, midlife women with 
hot flashes slept less than the recommended amount and health 
consequences of disrupted and inadequate sleep are well 
known and of concern.31–33 Future research should explore 
other approaches for improving sleep quality, such as cogni-
tive behavioral therapy for insomnia, to address the important 
problem of sleep disturbance in women during the menopausal 
transition and postmenopause.
