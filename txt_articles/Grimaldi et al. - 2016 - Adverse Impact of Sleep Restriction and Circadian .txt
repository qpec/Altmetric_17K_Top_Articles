T
he proportion of short sleepers in the adult US population 
has increased significantly over the past few decades.1 A 
recent review2 highlights that the majority of epidemiologi-
cal studies report a significant association between short sleep 
and hypertension. Several of these epidemiological studies 
have been prospective in nature, and a recent meta-analysis of 
longitudinal cohort studies reported that short sleep was asso-
ciated with increased risk for hypertension.3 In contrast, data 
from well-controlled laboratory studies, thus far, have failed 
to support a cause and effect relationship between short sleep 
and hypertension. Meier-Ewert et al4 and Sauvet et al5 found 
that 10 and 6 days, respectively, of experimental sleep restric-
tion (SR) did not change daytime arterial blood pressure (BP). 
Additionally, experimental SR has been shown to impair day-
time heart rate (HR) or HR variability (HRV) in some,4,6 but 
not all,5,7 studies.
Circadian misalignment (CM) is a condition typically 
associated with SR8 and occurs when endogenous circadian 
rhythms are desynchronized from the sleep–wake and feeding 
cycles. During CM, a number of rhythms of autonomic activ-
ity and endocrine release remain locked to the master circa-
dian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the 
hypothalamus, whereas multiple circadian oscillators located 
in peripheral tissues, including cardiac tissue and vascular 
smooth muscle, are partly synchronized by the timings of 
activity, sleep, and food intake.9 It is well recognized that shift 
work and jet lag are both associated with CM, but other factors 
such as chronotype, feeding habits, technological devices, and 
psychiatric health can influence CM.10 As such, the prevalence 
of acute, recurrent, or chronic CM is growing,11 and this has 
been suggested to have adverse cardiovascular consequences. 
Forced desynchrony, the gold standard laboratory approach 
to examine CM, has been shown to increase daytime BP in 
humans.8 However, this protocol involves reductions in total 
sleep time, and thus, the role of sleep loss in causing the car-
diovascular alterations could not be fully elucidated.8
Abstract—Insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances have been each associated with adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes in epidemiological studies, but experimental evidence for a causal link is scarce. The present study compares 
the impact of circadian misalignment (CM) to circadian alignment (CA) on human autonomic function using a 
nonrandomized parallel group design to achieve the same total sleep time in both conditions. After baseline assessments 
(3 days with 10-hour bedtimes), 26 healthy young adults were assigned to sleep restriction (SR; eight 5-hour bedtimes) 
with either fixed nocturnal bedtimes (CA; n=13) or bedtimes delayed by 8.5 hours on 4 of the 8 days (CM; n=13). 
Daytime ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate (HR; CA, n=11; CM, n=10) and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine 
levels (CA, n=13; CM, n=13) were assessed at baseline and the end of SR. Nocturnal HR and HR variability were 
analyzed during sleep at baseline and during the fourth and seventh nights of SR (CA, n=8; CM, n=12). SR resulted in 
a significant increase in daytime HR in both groups, without changes in blood pressure. SR increased 24-hour urinary 
norepinephrine in the CM group (30±4 versus 21±2 μg), but not in the circadian alignment group (group×condition, 
P=0.005). In contrast to the lack of detectable impact of CM on daytime autonomic function, SR with CM elicited 
greater increases in nocturnal HR, as well as greater reductions in vagal indices of HR variability, than SR without 
CM (group×condition, P<0.05). In conclusion, SR and CM both result in impaired autonomic function that could 
lead, under chronic conditions, to enhanced cardiovascular risk.  (Hypertension. 2016;68:243-250. DOI: 10.1161/

The present study aims to determine the impact of CM on 
autonomic nervous system control of cardiovascular function. 
To this effect, we designed an SR protocol comparing healthy 
adults under conditions of circadian alignment (CA) versus CM, 
keeping the amount of daily SR identical. We hypothesized that 
SR would impair autonomic function and that these impairments 
would be potentiated by CM when compared with CA.
Methods
Protocol and Participants
The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, all participants 
signed a written informed consent, and the Institutional Review 
Board of the University of Chicago approved the protocol (Figure 1).
Participants included 26 young healthy men (n=19) and women (n=7) 
aged 20 to 39 years who have been described in a previous article that fo-
cused on glucose metabolism.12 The current article focuses on autonom-
ic and cardiovascular outcomes that have not been reported. All subjects 
were free of endocrine, cardiovascular, psychiatric, and sleep disorders. 
Other exclusion criteria included medication use, smoking, excessive 
alcohol (>2 drinks/d) or caffeine consumption (>300 mg caffeine/d), 
shift work, or travelling across time zones during the past 2 months. 
Self-reported habitual sleep duration was 7.5 to 8.5 hours. Participants 
in each group were recruited from the community around the University 
of Chicago campus using the same advertisement materials. They were 
not pair-matched or group-matched. The CM and CA groups did not 
differ in sex distribution, age, or body mass index (BMI).12
Before the study, participants underwent a full in-laboratory poly-
somnography to exclude sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index >5 
events/h) and periodic leg movement during sleep (>5 events/h).13 
Participants were asked to follow standardized schedules (23:00–
07:00 hours bedtimes) for a week before the study. Compliance was 
verified using wrist activity recordings (Actiwatch, MiniMitter Inc). 
In women, the study was initiated during the early follicular phase of 
the menstrual cycle.
The study followed a nonrandomized, parallel group design com-
paring 2 interventions, each involving ≈2 weeks of hospitalization. 
Both interventions (Figure 1) consisted of 3 days with 10-hour bed-
times (22:00–08:00 hours: BL1–BL3; baseline rested condition), 
followed by 8 days with 5-hour bedtimes (SR1–SR8), resulting in a 
total of 24 hours of lost sleep opportunity over 8 days. Bedtimes were 
either always centered at 03:00 hour (00:30–05:30 hours, CA) or de-
layed by 8.5 hours on 4 days (09:00–14:00 hours on days SR2–SR3, 
SR5–SR6; CM). Participants abstained from caffeinated beverages 
throughout the protocol. On days BL3 and SR8, 24-hour blood sam-
pling for hormonal and metabolic assessments was performed at 15- 
to 30-minute intervals (for more details, see Leproult et al12).
Sleep
Sleep during each night was polygraphically recorded (Neurofax 
EEG-1100A, Nihon Kohden, Foothill Ranch, CA) using frontal, cen-
tral, and occipital electroencephalographic channels, electrooculo-
grams, submental electromyogram, ECG, chest and abdominal belts. 
Sleep recordings were visually scored in 30-s epochs in stages Wake, 
I, II, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
according to standardized criteria.14 Total sleep time was defined as 
the sum of the minutes of intra-sleep stages I, II, SWS, and REM.
Ambulatory BP and HR
BP and HR measurements were obtained from the nondominant arm at 
BL3 and SR8 while the subjects remained at bedrest. BP and HR were 
recorded at 15-minute intervals from 14:00 to 21:00 hour and again from 
8:00 to 14:00 hour via an ambulatory monitoring device (Accutracker II, 
Suntech Medical Instruments, Morrisville, NC). The first hour of each 
measurement was not included in the analysis to eliminate possible arti-
facts related to the beginning of the recording (Figure 1). Each isolated 
measurement that corresponded to a peak or a drop >15 mm Hg or bpm 
over or below the previous and next measurements was considered to be 
a technical artifact and was interpolated. In 5 subjects, the ambulatory 
BP monitoring device failed to record multiple and consecutive mea-
surements over ≥2 hours time frame. As such, these 5 individuals were 
excluded from the repeated-measure analysis, resulting in a total of 21 
subjects with complete daytime ambulatory BP (CA, n=11; CM, n=10). 
Mean arterial pressure was estimated using the standard calculation of 
one third pulse pressure plus diastolic pressure.15

Urinary Norepinephrine
Urine norepinephrine (NE) was obtained over 3 time intervals 
(15:00–21:00, 21:00–9:00, and 9:00–15:00 hours) during BL3 and 
SR8 (Figure 1). Fractionated urinary NE was assayed using a high-
performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection 
system (Coulochem Electrode Array System; ESA, Inc.). Twenty-
four-hour NE excretion and urinary NE levels for the 3 time intervals 
normalized per hour were computed.
HRV During Sleep
HRV analyses were performed during 1 baseline night (BL2) and 2 
nights of nocturnal bedtime restriction (SR4 and SR7; Figure 1). In 3 
participants, baseline HRV assessments were derived from night BL1 
because recordings during BL2 were of poor quality (n=1 in CA and 
n=2 in CM).
HRV analyses focused on the first 3 cycles of sleep (ie, approxi-
mately the first 5 hours of sleep). For each cycle, HRV analysis was 
performed on 5-minute periods during stage II, SWS, and REM sleep. 
An experienced neurologist (D. Grimaldi), blinded to the intervention 
condition (ie, CM versus CA), visually selected each 5-minute period 
to exclude portions of recording with breathing instabilities, arousals,16 
body movements, ectopic beats, and artifacts. To ensure a stationary 
signal,17 the same selection criteria were applied during the 30-s epoch 
preceding and the 30-s epoch following each 5-minute period.
HR and HRV were quantified during each 5-minute interval to de-
rive time and frequency domain indices (PRANA software; Phitools, 
Strasbourg, France). For each sleep stage, results of the analysis of 
the 5-minute periods in the 3 sleep cycles were averaged. The time 
domain index of HRV is reported as the square root of the mean of 
the squares of the successive differences between adjacent R-R inter-
vals (RMSSD), which is strongly correlated with the parasympathetic 
modulation of HR.17 Spectral analysis of HRV was performed by fast 
Fourier transform, and spectral power was calculated in the high fre-
quency band (HF; 0.15–0.40 Hz), reflecting mostly vagal activity, and 
in the low frequency band (LF: 0.04–0.14 Hz), reflecting a combina-
tion of vagal and sympathetic activities. Limitations associated with 
frequency domain analyses are acknowledged.18
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean (standard deviation) for normally 
distributed data or as median (25th, 75th percentiles) for data not 
normally distributed. We maintained the use of SEM in figures to 
maximize legibility. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed, 
including condition (baseline versus day of SR) and time (time of 
day), when applicable, as the within-subject factors and group (CA 
versus CM) as the between-subject factor. During nocturnal HR and 
HRV analyses, each stage was analyzed independently. Age and BMI 
were included as covariates. Between-group differences in changes 
from baseline of HR and HRV indices were also analyzed using a 
generalized linear model for repeated measures. When not normally 
distributed, the variables were log-transformed to meet the require-
ments for linear model analysis. All statistical calculations were per-
formed using JMP software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical 
significance was set at P<0.05.
Results
Participants
Demographics for the 26 participants have been previously 
reported.12 Daytime BP and HR were available for 21 partici-
pants and nocturnal HR and HRV for 20 participants. There 
were no significant differences in demographic characteristics 
between the CA and the CM groups in any of the analyses.
Polysomnography
The protocol was successful in achieving similar sleep dura-
tions in both the aligned and misaligned conditions because 
total sleep time during each night of the study (3 nights of 
baseline and 8 nights of SR) was nearly identical in the CM 
and CA groups, as previously reported.12 For the subset of 20 
participants in whom we report nocturnal HR and HRV, total 
sleep time, as well as the amounts of stage II, SWS, and REM 
Figure 2. Mean (±SEM) heart rate (top) and mean arterial pressure (bottom) measured every 15 minutes during daytime hours at baseline 
(black) and after 8 days of sleep restriction (red). Heart rate, but not mean arterial blood pressure, significantly increased after sleep 
restriction in both the circadian alignment and misalignment groups (condition, P<0.001; condition×group, P=0.46).

sleep, was also similar in the 2 groups (see Figure S1 in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Daytime Ambulatory BP and HR
Figure 2 illustrates that SR significantly increased daytime HR 
from baseline by 5 to 10 bpm above baseline in both CM and CA 
groups (condition, P<0.001). These clinically relevant increases 
in daytime HR were not different between CM and CA groups 
(condition×group, P=0.46). SR did not alter daytime mean arte-
rial pressure in either CM or CA groups (condition, P=0.14; 
condition×group, P=0.52). Similarly, mean systolic and dia-
stolic BP during evening and morning hours were not affected 
by SR in either group (data shown in Table S1).
Daytime and Nocturnal Urinary NE
Baseline 24-hour NE levels were within the normal range for 
healthy adults (<80 μg/24-hour) in all subjects.19 Baseline 
NE values were higher in subjects exposed to CA (group, 
P<0.01), and this difference was not explained by differences 
in demographic characteristics.
Figure 3 (upper panel) illustrates that 24-hour urine NE 
increased significantly after 8 days of SR in subjects exposed 
to CM (baseline, 21±8 μg; SR, 30±13 μg; P=0.013), but not 
in participants exposed to SR alone (baseline, 39±15 μg; SR, 
34±14 μg; P=0.26; condition×group, P=0.009).
When urinary NE levels were examined during the 3 
time intervals of urine collection, there was a significant 
group×condition interaction (P=0.005), and post hoc analysis 
revealed that NE levels increased more during nocturnal and 
morning hours as compared with baseline in the CM group, 
whereas no significant changes in urinary NE were observed 
in the CA group (Figure 3, lower panels). Specifically, SR 
with CM increased urine NE by ≈76% during the nighttime 
period (baseline, 0.6±0.3 μg/h; intervention, 0.9±0.4 μg/h; 
P=0.047) and by ≈78% during the morning period (baseline, 
1.1±0.5 μg/h; intervention, 1.7±0.8 μg/h; P=0.012).
Nocturnal HR and HRV
In the subset of participants in whom nocturnal HR and HRV 
could be analyzed, there were no significant group differences 
in sex distribution (CA, 3/8 women; CM, 4/12; P=0.85), BMI 
(CA, 23.1±2.4 kg/m2; CM, 22.1±2.5 kg/m2; P=0.19), and age 
(CA, 24.5±4.5 years; CM, 22.7±4.0 years; P=0.09). Nocturnal 
HR and HRV indices and respiratory frequency at baseline 
were not different between the 2 groups during all sleep stages 
(see Table S2). Changes in respiratory frequencies during

the intervention nights were comparable in the 2 groups in 
all sleep stages (group×condition: Stage II, P=0.82; SWS, 
P=0.28; REM, P=0.51).
Figure 4 illustrates that during SWS, normally the most 
restorative state of sleep, SR increased HR, in both the CM and 
CA groups (condition, P=0.030), but these increases in HR 
were greater in the CM group (group×condition, P<0.001). 
During SWS, SR decreased RMSSD (condition, P<0.01) and 
increased LF/HF ratio (condition: P<0.01) in the CM group, 
but not in the CA group (group×condition: P=0.008 and 
P=0.045, respectively).
Similarly, SR increased HR during stage II in both CM 
and CA groups (condition, P=0.013), and these increases 
in HR were greater in the CM group (group×condition, 
P=0.016). SR increased LF/HF ratio during stage II (con-
dition, P<0.01) in the CM group, but not in the CA group 
(group×condition, P=0.045). SR tended to decrease RMSSD 
during stage II in the CM group (P=0.049), but not in the CA 
group (group×condition, P=0.082). SR increased LF/HF ratio 
(P<0.01) during REM sleep in the CM group, but not in the 
CA group (group×condition, P=0.038). SR, with or with-
out CM, did not change HR during REM sleep (condition, 
P=0.921; group×condition, P=0.303) or REM RMSSD (con-
dition, P=0.887; group×condition, P=0.301).
Discussion
This well-controlled laboratory study is the first to determine 
the impact of CM on autonomic and cardiovascular function 
in sleep-restricted humans. Indeed, when controlling for the 
amount of SR, our data reveal 3 novel findings. First, SR with 
CM, but not with CA, significantly increased urinary NE and 
reduced nocturnal HRV. Second, SR with CM elicited greater 
increases in nocturnal HR when compared with SR alone. 
Third, these alterations in autonomic indices did not trans-
late into an augmentation of arterial BP, suggesting that other 
compensatory mechanisms are engaged to offset the observed 
impairment in sympathetic and parasympathetic functions 
during SR with CM. Collectively, these findings demonstrate 
a clear adverse impact of CM on autonomic function in sleep-
restricted healthy adults.
Several recent studies have suggested that CM can impair 
autonomic and cardiovascular function.20–22 Of particular 
interest, Scheer et al8 used a forced desynchrony protocol to 
examine the impact of CM on autonomic and cardiovascu-
lar function. The protocol involved 10 days of forced desyn-
chrony between endogenous circadian cycles and the imposed 
sleep–wake schedule. When participants slept and ate ≈12 
hours out of phase with their endogenous circadian rhythm, 
their BP was elevated during waking periods, whereas HR was 
unchanged. However, the authors report that total sleep time 
was reduced and acknowledged that the role of this reduction 
of sleep duration in the observed cardiovascular alterations 
could not be fully determined.8 Accordingly, the present study 
used a novel protocol in which sleep was restricted to the same 
extent with or without CM to examine the impact of CM in the 
presence of nearly identical levels of sleep loss. Our results 
reveal that this approach successfully increased sleep pressure 
and yielded similar total sleep times throughout all baseline 
and SR nights in both the CM and CA groups. However, our 
findings do not demonstrate that an impact of CM could be 
detected in the absence of sleep loss.
Epidemiological studies have reported significant asso-
ciations between sleep loss and hypertension.2 A recent meta-
analysis of longitudinal epidemiological studies reports that 
short sleep is associated with increased risk for hypertension.3 
Moreover, acute experimental models using 24 to 88 con-
secutive hours of total sleep deprivation consistently report 
increases in arterial BP.4,23–25 Taken together, these prospective 
epidemiological and acute total sleep deprivation studies hint 
toward a causal relationship between sleep loss and hyperten-
sion, but experimental data of well-controlled semichronic SR 
do not support this concept. Meier-Ewert et al4 and Sauvet 
et al5 both reported that experimental SR of, respectively, 10 
and 6 days did not affect daytime arterial BP. Our findings 
advance this prior work in an important way. Indeed, these 2 
previous studies obtained only a single time point snapshot 
Figure 4. Changes from baseline (±SEM) in heart rate (group×condition, P=0.016), root mean square of sequential differences of RR 
intervals (RMSSD; group×condition, P=0.008), and low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF) ratio (group×condition, P=0.045) in the 4th 
and 7th night of sleep restriction (SR4 and SR7) during slow-wave sleep. *P≤0.05 vs corresponding baseline. a.u. indicates arbitrary units;

of arterial BP, one using a 10-minute period of calibrated 
Portapres recordings5 and the other using unspecified casual 
General Clinical Research Center BP measurements.4 In con-
trast, the present study used a carefully controlled ambula-
tory BP monitoring system providing BP values at 15-minute 
intervals throughout waking hours. Our findings demonstrate 
unambiguously that 1 week of experimental bedtime restric-
tion to 5 hours per night does not result in significant eleva-
tions of arterial BP at any time of the waking period in healthy 
young adults, even when sleep loss is combined with CM, thus 
confirming and greatly extending the previous studies.4,5
There are several possible explanations for the discrep-
ancies between the prospective epidemiological studies and 
the laboratory SR studies. First, studies of experimental SR, 
including our own, have ranged in duration from 7 to 10 days, 
whereas prospective epidemiological studies have ranged from 
2 to 12 years.2 Second, participants in laboratory studies were 
young and healthy, whereas epidemiological studies enrolled a 
subject population with a wider range of demographics. Third, 
the vast majority of epidemiological studies were based on 
self-reported sleep duration, which is not strongly correlated 
with objectively defined sleep duration. Finally, it is possible 
that the well-controlled conditions of the laboratory studies 
eliminate effects of SR that could, under real-life conditions, 
cause elevations in BP. For example, participants in our labora-
tory studies typically report low levels of stress on validated 
scales,6 while meeting professional and personal demands 
when being chronically sleep-deprived may be much more 
stressful. In addition, in the laboratory, intake of caffeine, salt, 
and caloric-dense food is carefully controlled, whereas, under 
real-life conditions, insufficient sleep often results in increased 
caffeine, salt, and caloric intake that may in turn increase BP.
Despite similar ambulatory BP responses to SR in CA 
and CM groups, our data reveal significant differences in sev-
eral key autonomic variables between the 2 groups that may 
precede changes in ambulatory BP. Of particular interest, SR 
increased urinary NE levels only when combined with CM. 
NE baseline values were higher in subjects exposed to CA 
compared with those exposed to CM. However, all values 
were within the normal range for healthy adults,19 and the 
demographic characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. The 
difference in baseline NE levels, therefore, reflects random 
sampling within the wide physiological range of basal NE 
levels. Of note, despite a wide interindividual variability in 
24-hour NE levels, intraindividual levels are relatively stable 
over time.26 Moreover, it is worth noting that Faraut et al27 
recently reported that 1 night of sleep deprivation increased 
urinary NE from ≈40 μg/d to >70 μg/d. Our CA group dis-
played a similar baseline value to that of Faraut et al (ie, 39 
μg/d); thus, we are confident that our subjects were well within 
the range of being able to demonstrate further increases in uri-
nary NE with an adequate stressor (ie, not a ceiling effect). 
We acknowledge that the urinary NE baseline value for the 
CM group was on the lower side of the normative range (ie, 
15–80 μg/24 hours),19 and thus, we cannot rule out regression 
to the mean as an alternative explanation for the increase in 
NE levels in the CM group.
Urinary NE provides a reliable marker of sympathetic 
function that is highly dependent on glomerular filtration 
rate and renal function.28 The sympathetic nervous system is 
highly specific and regionalized; thus, we do not infer that SR 
with CM elicits a global increase of sympathetic activation. 
However, the increase of urinary NE after SR with CM sug-
gests that it may be valuable to use more invasive and region-
ally specific techniques, such as microneurography and NE 
spillover, to increase our understanding of the impact of SR 
and circadian dysfunction on sympathetic function.
Consistent with prior work,4 SR increased daytime ambu-
latory HR. The present study advances this prior work by 
demonstrating that CM does not seem to exacerbate this tachy-
cardia response to SR. However, in contrast to the daytime 
ambulatory HR, we observed a significant influence of CM on 
nocturnal HR and HRV responses to SR. During sleep, HRV 
analysis explores the integrity of autonomic nervous system 
function in the absence of confounding factors, such as physi-
cal activity and higher cortical functions. A reduction of HRV 
has been associated with an adverse prognosis in multiple car-
diovascular diseases.17,29 Previous studies that have explored 
the cardiovascular alterations associated with CM and sleep 
have primarily focused on assessments during daytime sleep 
when the circadian rhythm of autonomic nervous system 
activity is in an opposite phase relative to nighttime sleep.21,30 
These prior studies21,30 report that HR and LF:HF ratio were 
significantly increased during daytime sleep compared with 
nighttime sleep, suggesting that daytime sleep cannot provide 
the same cardiovascular restorative effects as nighttime sleep. 
In contrast, we investigated the cardiovascular consequences 
of SR with CM during the first realigned night after daytime 
sleep, when the behavioral sleep–wake cycle was identical to 
that of the CA group. We found that SR with CM was associ-
ated with higher HR and lower HRV during non-REM stages 
(ie, SWS and Stage II) as compared with SR with CA. Given 
the importance of SWS and non-REM sleep in cardiovascular 
restoration,31 these findings suggest that recurrent or chronic 
CM has adverse cardiovascular effects that are not readily 
corrected as soon as a normal daytime schedule is reinstated. 
The rate of recovery of nocturnal autonomous nervous sys-
tem activity after abrupt shifts of the sleep–wake cycle needs 
further study to improve our understanding of the adverse car-
diovascular consequences of shift work and design preventive 
strategies.
Morris et al32 recently reported that 3 days of CM (12-hour 
inversion of the behavioral and environmental cycle) without 
bedtime restriction elicited a reduction of daytime vagal indices 
of HRV, an increase in 24-hour BP and inflammatory markers, 
but no changes in 24-hour urinary NE excretion. The reduction 
in diurnal vagal cardiac control described by Morris et al32 cor-
roborates our findings from nighttime HRV analysis, indicating 
a reduction in vagal activity in subjects exposed to CM. There 
is, however, a discrepancy between our findings and those of 
Morris et al32 regarding BP and urinary NE responses to CM. 
The differences in the 2 experimental approaches (ie, CM and 
CA with similar levels of SR versus CM via 12-hour inversion 
of the behavioral and environmental cycle without control for 
sleep duration) likely explain these divergent findings. Indeed, 
Morris et al32 report that sleep duration was different between 
their CM and CA groups. It is important to note that although 
these in-laboratory studies are well-controlled, they are still

relatively short in duration (ie, 3–8 days) compared with real-
life CM. It remains possible that longer duration CM, with 
or without SR, would negatively impact both urinary NE and 
ambulatory BP. Nevertheless, when taken together, these two 
studies complement one another in suggesting the possibility 
of an increased cardiovascular risk in subjects exposed to CM 
and suggest that there may be a complex interaction between 
CM and SR that warrants further investigation.
We acknowledge some limitations in the present study. 
First, as previously reported,12 the 2 interventions could not be 
conducted simultaneously for logistic reasons, and therefore, 
assignment of the participants to the CA or CM group was 
not randomized in a traditional fashion. However, the same 
advertisement materials were used for both groups, and the 
subjects were not aware that an alternate intervention existed. 
It is possible that the lack of randomization contributed to the 
differences in NE baseline values between the 2 groups, but 
we think this is unlikely because baseline differences were 
not observed for other autonomic variables or for metabolic 
variables. Second, we introduced age and BMI as covariates 
in our analyses despite our limited sample size, and therefore, 
there is a potential for statistical overfitting. However, when 
we excluded age and BMI from our statistical models, the pri-
mary findings remained unchanged.
In conclusion, the present study reports that SR with CM, 
as typically occurs in shift workers, results in altered auto-
nomic function during wakefulness and sleep. In particular, 
SR with CM increases NE secretion and reduces cardiac vagal 
modulation which could, under chronic conditions, lead to an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Perspectives
Our findings are of importance to several conditions associated 
with SR with CM. For example, insufficient sleep is particu-
larly common in shift workers, who represent 15% to 30% of 
the working population.33–35 Irrespective of the schedule, shift 
work is typically associated with chronic CM. Prospective 
studies report adverse cardiovascular outcomes in shift work-
ers,19–22 and a recent meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies 
found that shift work is associated with an increased risk for 
myocardial infarction and all coronary events.36 In healthy 
subjects, the highest vagal influence on HR occurs during non-
REM sleep, together with the highest feedback contribution 
of the baroreflex,37,38 consistent with a cardiorestorative role 
of non-REM sleep. The results of this nonrandomized paral-
lel group study suggest that shift workers might not benefit 
from the restorative cardiovascular effects of aligned nights of 
sleep after a shift work rotation and may therefore not readily 
recover from their irregular sleep–wake pattern. Our findings 
hence suggest a mechanistic link between the reduction of 
cardiac vagal modulation during sleep found in our subjects 
exposed to CM and the increased risk to develop adverse car-
diac events observed in shift workers.
Evidence from rodent models has revealed that there are 
distinct phase relationships between rhythms of circadian gene 
expression in cardiac tissue, the liver, and the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus, and that these phase relationships need to be stable 
to achieve optimal cardiometabolic function at each time of 
day.39,40 In addition to shift work, other factors, such as jet lag, 
chronotype, feeding cycles, technological devices, and psy-
chiatric health, can influence CM.9 Therefore, the autonomic 
dysfunction reported during SR with CM in the present study 
is relevant to an increasingly wide range of individuals.

What Is New?
• Sleep restriction with circadian misalignment increases urinary norepi-
nephrine and nocturnal heart rate and reduces nocturnal heart rate vari-
ability when compared with sleep restriction with circadian alignment.
• These altered autonomic indices do not translate into an augmentation of 
ambulatory daytime arterial blood pressure.
What Is Relevant?
• Sleep loss and circadian misalignment are common among shift work-
ers. Our results suggest that shift workers might not benefit from the 
restorative cardiovascular effects of nighttime sleep after a shift work 
rotation.
Summary
This nonrandomized study is the first to determine the impact of 
circadian misalignment on autonomic and cardiovascular func-
tion in sleep-restricted humans. Our results demonstrate altered 
autonomic function during wakefulness and sleep, which under 
chronic conditions could lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease.
