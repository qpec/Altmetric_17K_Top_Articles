Analysing the link between public
transport use and airborne transmission:
mobility and contagion in the London
underground
Lara Goscé1,2* and Anders Johansson2
Abstract
Background: The transmission of infectious diseases is dependent on the amount and nature of contacts between
infectious and healthy individuals. Confined and crowded environments that people visit in their day-to-day life (such
as town squares, business districts, transport hubs, etc) can act as hot-spots for spreading disease. In this study we
explore the link between the use of public transport and the spread of airborne infections in urban environments.
Methods: We study a large number of journeys on the London Underground, which is known to be particularly
crowded at certain times. We use publically available Oyster card data (the electronic ticket used for public transport in
Greater London), to infer passengers’ routes on the underground network. In order to estimate the spread of a generic
airborne disease in each station, we use and extend an analytical microscopic model that was initially designed to
study people moving in a corridor.
Results: Comparing our results with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) data collected by Public Health England (PHE) in
London boroughs, shows a correlation between the use of public transport and the spread of ILI. Specifically, we show
that passengers departing from boroughs with higher ILI rates have higher number of contacts when travelling on
the underground. Moreover, by comparing our results with other demographic key factors, we are able to discuss the
role that the Underground plays in the spread of airborne infections in the English capital.
Conclusions: Our study suggests a link between public transport use and infectious diseases transmission and
encourages further research into that area. Results could be used to inform the development of non-pharmacological
interventions that can act on preventing instead of curing infections and are, potentially, more cost-effective.

Introduction
Epidemic outbreaks have always been present through-
out human history, affecting peoples day-to-day life.
Having an improved knowledge of infectious disease
spreading mechanisms and control measures is pivotal
for humanity’s well-being. Furthermore, gaining a bet-
ter understanding of how interactions between infective
and healthy individuals lead to contagion is a crucial step
in that direction. The idea behind our work arose from

the necessity of creating more realistic models describ-
ing the spread of infectious diseases that could be used
for policy making in order to have an impact on a pop-
ulation’s daily life. As an example, in the specific case of
influenza, UK Department of Health, created the 2011
UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy [1] where
effective response to a pandemic are set out. The doc-
ument reports that there is not enough evidence that
restrictions on mass gatherings will have any significant
effect on influenza virus transmission. Furthermore, from
the literature and available data, there is no conclusive
evidence of the individual effect of restrictions of mass
gatherings to help reduce influenza transmission. As a

consequence, the UK Government’s position on large
public gatherings, crowded events travelling and public
transport use is not only neutral in light of lack of evi-
dences, but those types of events are even encouraged
because they represent an important indicator of ’nor-
mality’ and may help maintain public morale during a
pandemic [1].
When studying the spread of airborne infections on
a metropolitan scale there are some environments that
serve as seeds of epidemic spread, where a higher num-
ber of individuals get in contact with each other. Previ-
ous work [2] has shown that incorporating elements of
pedestrian modelling [3–9]) when studying the spread of
a generic airborne infection in crowded environments,
can greatly improve the model’s fidelity. Combining ele-
ments of traditional compartmental models [10, 11], net-
work models [12, 13] and wearable sensor based studies
[14–16], an analytical method was recently devised [2]
with the aim to be able to more accurately model small
scale scenarios (i.e. pedestrian interaction). Here we apply
this mathematical description to the particular case of
the London Underground network by inferring a passen-
ger transport model from data obtained from the TfL
(Transport for London) [17].
Since it opened in 1863, the London Underground has
become the most important transport network of the
English capital and is considered the oldest rapid transit
system in the world. It serves 270 stations, has 402 km
of extension and carries a number of 1.265 billion annual
passengers. Therefore, its stations constitute an ideal use
case of crowded and confined environments and can be
analysed while studying crowd dynamics and contagion
mechanisms.
In the first part of our work we mathematically derive,
from the TfL dataset, the time individuals take to move
in a system of two stations connected with each other.
Furthermore, we show how this model can be extended
to a whole line of the London Underground and, from
this, we evaluate the number of contacts and new infec-
tions in some selected stations. In the second part, we
use real data on influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) collected by
NHS from GPs in London boroughs and show the corre-
lations between the use of the underground and new ILI
infections.
Method
Previous work [2] has studied the number of new infec-
tions created when infective individuals (along with sus-
ceptible ones) move in a corridor. Instead of completely
modifying the compartmental model framework, the
attention was focused on the transmission rate that is
generally considered constantly equal to λ = cβ in the
traditional approach, where β is the contact rate and c rep-
resents the proportion of contacts that end up becoming
infected. In the new definition fully explored in [2] it is
shown how, from an individual-level perspective, the con-
tact rate β can be derived from the average local density
around the infective individual �ρ�, which can be esti-
mated statistically from the average density within a larger
space �, using first an Eulerian description of the crowd
density Gamma distribution ps(ρ; A; B) =
BA
�(A)ρA−1e−Bρ
where A = 3μ = 3� = 3N/(Lw) and then re-formulated
into a Lagrangian description pt(ρ; A; B) = ps(ρ;A;B)
�v(ρ)� . Since
0.05 ≤ �v(ρ)� = 1/√ρ−1/√ρmax
0.5
≤ 1.34 is the average veloc-
ity of a pedestrian, the average local density around an
individual can be formulated as:
�ρ� =
� ∞
0
pt(ρ)ρ dρ
(1)
Moreover, when breathing, large droplets are carried up
to 1 meter (2 meters when coughing and 6 meters when
sneezing) [18–20]. Susceptible individuals can become
infected by inhaling these droplets thus, the density-
dependent transmission rate can be re-defined as:
λdensity-dependent = c�ρ�πR2
(2)
where πR2 is the area that surrounds the infective individ-
ual, according to a radius R meters which represents the
maximum distance large droplets can be carried to. Con-
sequently, in order to calculate the number of infections
produced by an individual walking in a corridor, we need
to calculate the average density of the whole corridor.
When considering the path that individuals walk inside
a station, we can visualise it as a corridor from the
entrance of the station to the train platform (and vice
versa). If we can estimate the average density inside that
station, at any time of the day, we can infer the local
density and, consequently, the transmission rate, thus
obtaining the number of new infections occurring in that
station throughout the day. We know that the average
velocity of individuals moving in the station is v = D/T,
where D is the distance walked by the individual from the
entrance to the train (or from the train to the exit) within
a duration of T seconds. Moreover the average velocity
as v(�) =
1
√� −
1
√�max
0.5
is derived in [4] from a microscopic
model of pedestrian flow, and is defined considering the
difference between the net distance between individuals
and the mean distance between their center of masses
over the net-time headway, and where �max is the maxi-
mum value of the density. Thus, we can infer the average
density � by knowing the time T the individuals take to
walk inside the station having v(�) = D/T and obtaining
� =

This means that, in order to solve the epidemiological
problem of the number of new infections occurring in
 Goscé and Johansson Environmental Health           (2018) 17:84

the stations of the network, we need to initially solve a
pedestrian dynamics model allowing us to determine the
time individuals take to walk inside the station at different
times of the day.
In the first week of November 2009, TfL collected data
from the Oyster cards (the electronic ticket used on pub-
lic transport in Greater London) and made around 10% of
them available to the public. When people use the under-
ground, they tap their Oyster card once at the entrance
and once again at the exit. These journeys were sam-
pled randomly and the time stamps and Oyster card ID is
reported for each entry and exit. TfL also provides a 100%
sample of the total average number of entries to and exits
from all the stations, every fifteen minutes. Using these
data sets, we develop a method to infer the time a passen-
gers take to walk across their starting and arrival stations.
By calling A the starting station of a generic journey and B
the arrival station, we can consider the total journey time
as a sum of smaller trips.
The total journey time for a single passenger �TA−>B =
the time required to walk across the starting station
from the entrance to the platform �tA
en +
+ the waiting time on the platform �tA
P
+ the travel time the train takes to go from A to B,
�tA−>B (for simplicity we do not consider trips that
require a change of line)
+ the time to walk across the arrival station from the
platform to the exit �tB
ex.
�TA−>B = �tA
en + �tA
P + �tA−>B + �tB

(4)
Our goal is to find an estimation of the average den-
sity in the station � = N/Lw (where L and w represent
respectively length and width of the walked path). Since
this number is clearly not constant during the day (from
the station opening until its closure) because the number
of people using the station N varies throughout the day,
we study the average density in a time interval of 15 min
and reiterate the process throughout the day. In order to
do so we look at the data of the journeys in that specific
time interval.
The Oyster card provide only enough data to infer
�TA−>B, while the remaining terms of Eq. (4) are
unknown. To solve this problem we use data collected by
a train tracking system (developed at CASA [21]) which
reports the exact position of each train of the network
every 3 min. By knowing the positions of all the trains in
the network we are able to infer the time the train takes
to move from one station to the next, and the average
waiting time at the platform
�
�tA
P + �tA−>B
�
. The still
analytically unsolvable equation can now be solved com-
putationally using the method of least squares to calculate
the walking time across each of the two stations.
As an example, we show here the solutions obtained
when studying the Central Line (49 stations and 74km of
extension). For practical reasons we show here curves for
only a few of the involved stations (Fig. 1) and report in
Table 1 the correlation coefficients for the other Central
line stations.
Figure 1 highlights two important consequences arising
by the use of this method: (i) the presence of peaks and (ii)
the correlation between the curves.
Firstly, the model is able to capture the expected bi-
modal behaviour: the morning and the afternoon peaks,
meaning that, at the times when the stations are more
crowded i.e. around 9 am and 6 pm when people travel
to/from work it takes longer to traverse the stations.
Moreover by comparing the Time Walked curve (i.e. the
curve that represents the time it takes each moment of
the day to cross the selected station) with the curve given
by the maximum number of individuals present in the
station during the day we observe a high correlation coef-
ficient between the two. Consequently, we can say that the
method captures the fact that the more crowded a station
is, the longer it will take to walk through it.
From the times required to walk inside each stations
we can determine the transmission rate defined in Eq. 2.
Finally the number of new infections that arise from the
contacts happening inside each single station during the
whole day can be calculated solving the simple compart-
mental model described in [2]
˙
s = −λis
˙
e = λis
˙
i = 0
(5)
Where s and i are the compartments representing sus-
ceptible and infectious individuals respectively and e is
the compartment of exposed (infected but not infectious)
individuals.
Influenza-like illnesses
The theoretical description of the model has been pre-
sented in relation to a generic airborne human infection.
In order to test the applicability of the model in a realistic
context, we will now focus our attention on Influenza-like
illnesses (ILI). ILI is described by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) as a nonspecific respi-
ratory illness characterized by fever, fatigue, cough, and
other symptoms. The majority of ILI cases is not caused
by influenza viruses but by others such as rhinoviruses
and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adenoviruses, and
parainfluenza viruses. ILI infections can lead to serious
complications and require hospitalization. Moreover indi-
viduals can average one to three (adults) and three to six
(children) ILI yearly [22]. Table 2 reports data collected by
Public Health England (PHE) [23] of the average rate per
100,000 practice population of ILI cases observed from
October 2013 until March 2014 in each London borough.
The data from PHE were obtained by a large surveillance

Fig. 1 Correlation coefficients for four stations on the Central line. We analysed all Central line trips arriving and departing in a given station
(Liverpool Street n=14723; Notting Hill Gate n=5058; Marble Arch n=4102; Stratford n=8426). Results show a peak configuration highlighting the
fact that people take more time to traverse the stations during specific times of the day. The correlation coefficient between the time necessary to
walk from the entrance of the station to the platform (and viceversa) and the maximum number of individuals in the station at a specific time (data
provided by TfL on the number of people entering and leaving each stations every fifteen minutes) show that these times are strictly connected to
the density in the station, meaning that more crowded is an area the longer it will take to traverse it. The walking times are multiplied by 5, 10 or 20

system that monitors in hours general practitioners (GPs)
consultations for a number of key clinical indicators. In
United Kingdom individuals register with a single primary
care physician who has a well defined patient popula-
tion. On a daily basis this system reports and covers over
40% of the England population. Data were collected from
available practices located in each London borough from
October 2013 to March 2014, Table 2 reports their average
value during these six months.
In order to investigate the correlation between ILI rates
in London and the contacts arising when using the under-
ground, we define two additional parameters: (i) the total
number of contacts occurring for a single passenger dur-
ing their whole trip �, (ii) and the total number of contacts
occurring for all passengers departing from the same bor-
ough in the same time interval during the duration their
trips �.
The quantity �, defined as the sum of all the people
each passenger get in contact with during their trip, is
� = �n
i=1 δi where n is the number of stations the pas-
senger need to cross during the trip and δi is the number
of contact the passenger makes in the i-th station and by
our model is equal to
δi = �ρi�πR2
(6)
where �ρi� is the average density in the i-th station.
While comparing data and results we need to keep in
mind that our model is applied to the very early stages
of contagion in environments considerably smaller than
the usual scale (a whole city, or even a nation). To be
able to perfectly compare the results from our micro-
scopic analysis we would need individual-level data that
are very difficult to acquire, thus in the comparison with
PHE data (that are population-level data) we need to take
into account the inferential fallacy that may occur when
statistical properties observed on an aggregate level do
not reflect the relations that exist on a local level. In the
attempt of overcoming this problem we study the amount
of contacts obtained during the whole trips when leav-
ing from stations belonging to the same boroughs. This
translate by saying that for each borough we calculate
the number � that is given by summing for all the trips

Results are shown for most of the Central Line stations (μ = 0.76178, σ = 0.13204).
Since TfL provides a 10% sample of travels happening during a single week, of
which we analyse only the ones happening during weekdays and not involving a
change of line, data points for some of the less busy stations were not available or
available only during peak times translating into a lower correlation coefficient. In
general, a higher amount of data points ensures a more accurate correlation
coefficient value. Note that we have excluded stations that had less than N trips in
any one 15-minute segment, where N is the average number of trips (i.e.
passengers) per station given by ratio between the total number of trips
departing(arriving) from the selected station and arriving(departing) in one of the
other stations on the line, over the number of station in that line
departing in each underground station of the borough
between 5 am and 10 am, the total amount of contacts
acquired during each whole trip. Normalised by the total

Results
We compared number of contacts calculated using our
model with data collected by Public Health England (PHE)
of Influenza-like illnesses (ILI) [23] and several interesting
results can be highlighted.
First of all, boroughs that do no contain any under-
ground station seem to have incidence rates lower than
than average 9.73 (per 100,000). The average ILI inci-
dence in boroughs without underground is 7.61, while it is
10.24 in boroughs with underground station. One excep-
tion is Lewisham (11.75) that, however, has a high number
of railway stations (London Overground and Docklands
Light Railway, DLR), here the 2011 Census [24] reported
railway as the principal form of transport that residents
of the borough used to travel to work. This difference,
however, is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.0776).
We also notice that boroughs with higher case rates are
generally more peripheral in respect to others, in partic-
ular their underground stations have a more peripheral
position on the map, meaning that people who travel from
there are forced not only to spend more time on the
train, but also to change line one or even several times,
consequently getting in contact with a higher number of
individuals.
As an example we compared trips from two different
boroughs: Islington and the Royal Borough of Kensington
and Chelsea (RBKC). Both are very central with respect
to the London map, but Islington has a case rate of 15.37
and its stations are more peripheral with respect to the
underground map (the majority of the stations are served
by only one line), while RBKC has a rate of 5.5 and its
stations are more central and well connected and gener-
ally served by two or more lines. In order to apply our
method in relation to the data, we must consider only the
trips made by individuals residing in these boroughs. TfL
does not provide personal data of the passengers, however
not all underground users reside in London (e.g. tourists,
commuters etc), moreover passengers can change posi-
tion multiple times throughout the day. For this reason,
we filtered our data by only considering trips with a depar-
ture time between 6 am and 10 am assuming that people
leaving for work early in the morning tend to use the more
convenient public transport available to them by taking
the train from the station closest to their residence. After
that, we evaluated all the trips leaving from the stations
in these boroughs between the selected time interval, and
considered the arrival stations, the lines and stations that
were involved, and the total journey time. The first notice-
able result is that almost all the trips departing from
stations in the borough of Islington have to change line in
King’s Cross St. Pancreas station which is one of the bus-
iest and most central station of the entire underground,
also connected with a major London railway terminal
of the same name. Consequently, for each trip we also
need to consider the time the individuals take in this sta-
tion when changing from a platform to another and the
number of contacts they make during the process. The
majority of trips departing from RBKC are instead direct
trips and do not stop at any intermediate station.
Now, let us evaluate the total number of contacts for
several frequent trips departing from stations from both
boroughs. Results can be seen in Fig. 2. For trips depart-
ing from RBKC most of the time only two stations are
involved and therefore
�RBKC = δO + δD
(8)
where δO is the number of contacts obtained by crossing
the origin station, and δD is the number of contact resulted
by crossing the destination station.
On the other hand, the majority of trips departing
from Islington have to stop in an intermediate station in
order to change line, most of the times King’s Cross sta-
tion. Thus, the total number of contact for each trip is
calculated by
�RBKC = δO + δKC + δD
(9)
where δKC is the number of contacts made at King’s Cross.
This supports our assumption that individuals leaving
from the borough with the highest incidence rate make
more contacts with respect of the ones leaving from the
borough with the lowest incidence rate.
In order to extend our analysis to the whole city, we use
the previously defined parameter �. The quantity � has
no direct epidemiological meaning, it is just an index of
comparison between our model results and PHE data. For
Fig. 2 Total number of contacts during trips departing from Islington
(red) and during trips departing from RBKC (green). We plotted results
for the n=3 most common routes per borough. Passengers leaving
from Islington, while travelling on the underground, need to change
lines more frequently respect to people departing from RBKC thus
traversing more stations and getting in contact with more people
 Goscé and Johansson Environmental Health           (2018) 17:84

this reason, we do not expect to find a perfect correla-
tion between the data and these values, also because PHE
data are very aggregate and do not report personal infor-
mation relating the infective individuals such as sex or
age, and we know, for example that everyday commuting
across the city is mostly done by adult individuals. More-
over, contact rates would only be able to capture what
happens in the underground while PHE data report infec-
tion cases independently from the origin of the contagion
(may it be in schools, offices, households etc). However, as
can be seen from � values reported in Table 2, this very
basic type of comparison can still capture a correlation of
0.44. The model can especially capture what happens in
boroughs that have generally higher incidence rates and
the respective total amount of contact � is higher (ex.
Greenwich, Newham, Southwark). On the other hand, it
is less able to capture what happens in some low inci-
dence boroughs. One explanation is possibly related to
the fact that, according to 2011 Census, people living in
those boroughs use mostly private means to go to work
(car, walk etc) compared to the underground, thus mean-
ing that even though taking the underground from those
boroughs involve an average or high amount of contacts,
there are actually not many people taking it in the first
place (ex. Hounslow, Richmond upon Thames, Merton).
Moreover, since the mean incidence rate is 9.73, we divide
boroughs into two groups: high incidence rates (≥ 10)
and low incidence rates (< 10), and compare the respec-
tive �-values. Results can be seen in Fig. 3. The model
is able to capture the fact that the totality of higher inci-
dence stations have an higher amount of contacts and,
vice versa, the totality of lower incidence stations have a
lower amount of contacts. A Mann-Whitney U-test was
run with the null hypothesis of both sets having an equal
median and the test rejected the hypothesis with a p-value
of 0.0293; showing a correlation between the total amount
of contacts passengers make when using the underground
and infection rates.
This correlation is especially significant if we compare
our results with with demographic rates from each bor-
ough in Table 3, where we can see that the role of pub-
lic transport in relation to the spread of ILI could be
compared to the role of other important key factors.
We collected demographic data by borough from Lon-
don Datastore [25], ranked them according to their ILI
rate and aggregated by comparing boroughs according
to the mean ILI incidence of 9.73 (as done previously)
and studied the correlation. Some of the results reported
in the table confirm a statistical significance for some
well-known factors such as boroughs inner densities
(p=0.0151), employment rates (p=0.0433), claimants of
benefits on housing and income support (p=0.0031) and
population aged 65+ (p=0.0012). More surprisingly is the
low correlation with the younger population aged <15
Fig. 3 Box Plot Left: Boroughs divided by high (n=15) and low (n=11) incidence rates and their associated �-values. It is possible to notice a clear
difference between the two sets medians (bands inside the boxes). Moreover, high rates boroughs exhibit a considerably higher interquartile range,
meaning that cumulative contact rates for boroughs with ILI incidence rates higher than 10 tend to exhibit a significantly higher range variability
respect to boroughs with lower ILI incidence rates. This distance, which represents the middle 50% of data, touches considerably higher �-values
for high ILI-rates boroughs respect to the values covered by low ILI-rates boroughs. A Mann-Whitney U-test was run with MATLAB with the null
hypothesis of both sets having an equal median and the test rejected the hypothesis with a p-value of 0.0293.Right: Boroughs divided by high

which represents the middle 50% of data, touches lower children demographic rates for high ILI-rates boroughs respect to the values covered by
low ILI-rates boroughs

Since the mean incidence rate is 9.73, we divided boroughs into two groups: high
incidence rates (≥ 10, n = 15)) and low incidence rates (< 10, n = 11) and
demographic data were divided accordingly. Mann-Whitney U-test was run for all of
them with the null hypothesis of both sets having an equal median. It can be seen
that, in relation to the spread of infectious diseases, the use of public transport can
possibly play a role comparable to the one played by some key factors such as inner
densities and employment rates and population by age
years old. Many studies have shown the important role
played by children in the spread of infectious diseases
because of their higher mixing rates and incidence rates
and shown that schools constitute some of the main sites
of contagion [26–33]. When comparing PHE data with
demographic data on the portion of the population aged
0–15 years old in each borough (knowing that in UK
children generally attend the school in their neighbour-
hood) we find a correlation coefficient of only 0.13. This
result seems, at first, particularly surprising, when think-
ing about the significant role children play in the spread
of ILI. Mughini et al. [34] performed a survey analysis on
ILI in families with children younger than 4 years, results
showed that parents of ILI-affected children had a concur-
rent 4-fold higher ILI risk. The small statistical difference
in children population between boroughs with low and
high ILI rates (Fig. 3), however, does not mean that chil-
dren do not contribute to the spread of ILI on a population
level, on the contrary many factors are involved and the
larger the scale of the analysis and grater is the amount
of time passed since contagion, more complicated is the
understanding of what the cause was. The scope of this
analysis is simply to compare some factors whose role in
the spread of infections is already acknowledged and dis-
cuss the possibility that the use of public transport may
play a similar role and should be taken into account along
them.
Discussion
The correlation between the use of public transport and
the spread of infectious diseases is something that has
always been assumed and generally accepted but has never
been proved.
Previous studies have highlighted the importance of
analysing social contacts and mixing patterns when study-
ing infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory
or close-contact routes. In [26] data were collected by
a population-based survey of mixing patterns in eight
European countries through a paper-diary methodology.
The definition of contact used in the study was of interac-
tions such as a kiss or a handshake for physical contacts,
while nonphysical contacts were situations such as a two-
way conversation without skin-to-skin contact. In the
model that we use [2], instead, we define two individu-
als as in contact if the local density around them is high
enough that they enter in the respective infective regions
that surrounds them. Another type of survey based study
[35] collected data of ILI cases across UK population
through Flusurvey, an internet-based open community
cohort. They calculated ILI incidence week by week
throughout five months, and investigated possible risk
factors associated with it. One of the main conclusions of
this study was that public transport does not increase the
possibility of acquiring ILI. However, that study took the
whole UK into account and the survey approach implied
that people were able to report their symptoms at any
point throughout their convalescence, moreover symp-
toms usually arise awhile (even days) after the contagion
happens, meaning that people using public transport and
people not using it have enough time to mix with each
other in other environments (offices, households, etc).
Consequently it is not possible to pinpoint exactly where
the contagion took place, giving the macroscopic result
of no connection between public transport use and inci-
dence of new infection, while a more detailed microscopic
analysis would be needed. In our work, instead of tak-
ing the whole of UK into account, we focus the attention
on a local description where the underground stations are
seen as confined and crowded spaces. We study the infec-
tion processes on the very first moments of the contagion,
actually limiting our study to 15 min segments of intervals,
knowing that the mixing patterns that arise once outside
the underground network (households, offices etc) will
lead to new infections that can blur the public transporta-
tion role when looking at the bigger picture. Also, studying
the connection between public transport and the spread of
airborne infections can highlight another issue i.e. the spa-
tial incidence patterns over time, meaning that it could be
possible to find out whether London Underground con-
tribute to how quickly and how strongly a disease spreads
to different areas of the city, areas that maybe otherwise
would be reached by the disease more slowly or with lower
case incidence.
The hypothesis of an association between public trans-
port and disease transmission is not novel. Another study
[36] focused on the relationship between public trans-
port use and acquisition of acute respiratory infection

(ARI). That study is closer to our work because it uses
a more microscopical analysis, both in time and space.
Data of ARI and control of other non respiratory condi-
tions were collected from General Practitioners, together
with data on bus or tram usage in the five days preceding
illness onset (cases) or the five days before consultation
(controls) and results show statistically significant asso-
ciation between ARI and bus or tram use. Moreover,
other studies have also highlighted the importance of
studying metropolitan patterns and social interactions.
In [37], using travel smart card data, authors construct
a time-resolved in-vehicle social encounter network on
public buses in a city and draw attention to the impact
of collective regularities can make on various diffu-
sion/spreading processes. Our work, while addressing a
similar question, is differentiate by the use of a novel
analytical method combining individual-level pedestrian
modelling and compartmental modelling. Moreover the
two studies [36, 37] analyse transmission in a static set-
ting (buses) while we address the problem in a dynamic
environment of people moving inside underground
stations.
The results of our study shows the existence of a corre-
lation between the use of public transport and infectious
diseases transmission. Specifically, we showed a correla-
tion between the use of London underground and the
spread of influenza-like illnesses. The model is particu-
larly able to show this correlation in environments with
high numbers of infections, capturing the fact that areas
that have the highest numbers of ILI cases are also areas
whose inhabitants spend more time in the underground
network by changing line more frequently and getting
in contact with more individuals. Correlation, however,
does not prove causation, when looking at an epidemic
on a large scale many contributing factors need to be
taken into account. The role of social inequalities and age
in the transmission of infectious diseases is well known
and publicly accepted [38–41]. We compared the correla-
tion between ILI cases and contacts originated from the
use of the underground with the correlation coefficients
between ILI cases and some demographic factors such
as children and elderly populations, boroughs inner den-
sities, employment rates and population on low income
support (benefit claimants) and our results show simi-
lar values. While these results are not enough to quantify
the role played by the use of public transport on large-
scale infection transmission, they are interesting for both
researchers and policy makers alike.
Limitations of this work are associated to the nature
of the datasets involved. On the modelling side, Oyster
card data and train tracking data were sourced in dif-
ferent years (2009 and 2013 respectively) and, while the
underground network did not undergo major transfor-
mations during those years, results could still be affected
by a level on uncertainty on the timetables. Also, PHE
dataset reports numbers of ILI cases disaggregated only
by borough and limited to one season, highly limiting
the model’s precision in the evaluation of the correlation
between infections and numbers of contacts. Moreover,
knowledge of specific ILI-related data such as lengths of
incubation periods or different level of infectiousness pro-
vided by the different pathogens causing ILI, would make
results more precise and case specific. Further studies
should focus, in particular, on sourcing individual-level
ILI data in different settings so that, by combining them
with already existing studies from household and schools,
a clearer map of the transmission of ILI in a metropolitan
environment could be drawn, this could help quantifying
the role that different hot-spots play in the transmission.
Empirical studies combining aero-biology and pedes-
trian modelling would be important in highly improving
models fidelity and devising non-pharmaceutical control
strategies tackling threshold densities to minimise num-
bers of infections and optimal ventilation in different
crowded environments.
Policy makers, in particular, should address the role
potentially played by public transport and crowded events
and avoid encouraging the attendance of such environ-
ments during epidemics in order to maintain public
morale, as specifically done by the UK Influenza Pandemic
Preparedness Strategy [1].
Conclusions
In summary, we have analysed the association between
the use of public transport and infectious diseases trans-
mission by studying the London Underground network.
We used real trips data to infer the level of density in
each station at any time during the day and the num-
ber of contacts between passengers, and compared these
results to influenza-like illnesses (ILI) rates in London
boroughs. Results show a correlation between the use
of the underground and ILI cases in London, specifi-
cally they show that higher numbers of ILI cases arise in
those boroughs where the population spend more time
in the Underground and/or incur in a higher number
of contacts when travelling. On the other hand, lower
numbers of ILI cases arise in those boroughs where peo-
ple have a limited use of the underground and/or incur
in fewer contacts. These results are in line with other
environmental and demographic factors such as popula-
tion stratified by ages, inner densities employment and
income.
These results are informative for both scientists and
policy makers alike. At the basic research stage, further
studies are required to explicitly quantify the role of
public transport in infectious disease transmission, and
policies should be re-evaluated to take these results into
account.
