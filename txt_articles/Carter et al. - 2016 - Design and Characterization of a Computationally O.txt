ABSTRACT
One of the challenges of developing influenza A vaccines is the diversity of antigenically distinct isolates. Previously, a novel
hemagglutinin (HA) for H5N1 influenza was derived from a methodology termed computationally optimized broadly reactive
antigen (COBRA). This COBRA HA elicited a broad antibody response against H5N1 isolates from different clades. We now re-
port the development and characterization of a COBRA-based vaccine for both seasonal and pandemic H1N1 influenza virus
isolates. Nine prototype H1N1 COBRA HA proteins were developed and tested in mice using a virus-like particle (VLP) format
for the elicitation of broadly reactive, functional antibody responses and protection against viral challenge. These candidates
were designed to recognize H1N1 viruses isolated within the last 30 years. In addition, several COBRA candidates were designed
based on sequences of H1N1 viruses spanning the past 100 years, including modern pandemic H1N1 isolates. Four of the 9 H1N1
COBRA HA proteins (X1, X3, X6, and P1) had the broadest hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity against a panel of 17
H1N1 viruses. These vaccines were used in cocktails or prime-boost combinations. The most effective regimens that both elicited
the broadest HAI response and protected mice against a pandemic H1N1 challenge were vaccines that contained the P1 COBRA
VLP and either the X3 or X6 COBRA VLP vaccine. These mice had little or no detectable viral replication, comparable to that
observed with a matched licensed vaccine. This is the first report describing a COBRA-based HA vaccine strategy that elicits a
universal, broadly reactive, protective response against seasonal and pandemic H1N1 isolates.
IMPORTANCE
Universal influenza vaccine approaches have the potential to be paradigm shifting for the influenza vaccine field, with the goal of
replacing the current standard of care with broadly cross-protective vaccines. We have used COBRA technology to develop an
HA head-based strategy that elicits antibodies against many H1 strains that have undergone genetic drift and has potential as a
“subtype universal” vaccine. Nine HA COBRA candidates were developed, and these vaccines were used alone, in cocktails or in
prime-boost combinations. The most effective regimens elicited the broadest hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) response
against a panel of H1N1 viruses isolated over the past 100 years. This is the first report describing a COBRA-based HA vaccine
strategy that elicits a broadly reactive response against seasonal and pandemic H1N1 isolates.
I
nfluenza vaccine efficacy is constantly undermined by antigenic
variation in the circulating viral strains, particularly in the hem-
agglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Current in-
fluenza vaccination strategies rely on changing the HA and NA
components of the annual human influenza vaccine to ensure that
they antigenically match circulating influenza strains (1, 2). De-
veloping an influenza vaccine that is capable of providing broad
and long-lasting protective antibody responses remains the cen-
tral challenge for influenza virus research. Protection against in-
fluenza infection is mediated primarily by neutralizing antibodies
(NAbs) (3–5). However, the virus undergoes genetic variation to
avoid the host immune response generating unique epitopes not
present in the parental strain while maintaining other shared
epitopes. This genetic drift allows the virus to escape from NAbs.
Ideally, upon infection with a variant virus strain, memory B cells,
which recognize the shared epitopes between the parental and
variant virus strains, should become activated. Simultaneously,
naive B cells should respond to the presence of novel epitopes in
variant strains. In this scenario, antibodies should be generated to
both shared and unique epitopes resulting in neutralization of the
new variant virus strain. However, in reality, the activation of
naive B cells and generation of NAbs to novel epitopes are not
effectively induced during infection, particularly in those popula-
tions undergoing immunosenescence, such as in the elderly (6, 7).
Several approaches are under way to develop a more effective in-
fluenza vaccine that will recognize most, if not all, circulating influ-
enza strains. Immune responses directed at more conserved influ-
enza proteins such as matrix (M2e) or nucleoprotein (NP) are in
development, but these vaccines function through disease modu-
lation and appear not to be as protective as needed to prevent

 morbidity and mortality following a high-dose influenza virus
challenge (8). While these approaches and many other approaches
have merit, several research groups (9), including ours, continue
efforts toward the generation of an influenza vaccine capable of
eliciting a potent, broadly reactive HA-specific antibody responses
that protects against both seasonal and novel pandemic influenza
strains that have undergone genetic drift. These vaccines induce
immunity targeting both the globular head and stem regions
of HA.
In order to overcome antigenic drift and mismatch of current
influenza vaccines for pandemic and seasonal viruses, we reported
a new methodology of antigen design using multiple rounds of
consensus building to generate candidates termed computation-
ally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRAs). This method
was initially designed to address the diversity of H5N1 highly
pathogenic avian influenza (10–13), and COBRA H5 designs were
shown to elicit increased breadth of antibody responses to 25
H5N1 strains that were isolated over a 12-year span. In this report,
a similar approach was used to generate COBRA HA antigens to
elicit antibody responses to a panel of 17 H1N1 viruses isolated
over almost a 100-year span of time. Each of the COBRA HA
antigens were expressed on virus-like particles (VLPs) to be used
as proof-of-concept antigens for immunogenicity and efficacy
testing in the murine model. These candidates were used individ-
ually, in cocktails or in prime-boost regimens to evaluate the effect
on elicited antibodies and protective efficacy compared to wild-
type H1N1 HA antigens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antigen construction and synthesis. Influenza A hemagglutinin (HA)
nucleotide sequences isolated from human H1N1 infections were down-
loaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database (13). Nucleo-
tide sequences were translated into protein sequences using the standard
genetic code. Full-length sequences from H1N1 viral infections isolated
from swine and human sources between 1918 and 2012 were used in this
analysis. For each round of consensus generation, multiple alignment
analysis was applied, and the consensus sequence was generated using
AlignX (Vector NTI). The final amino acid sequence, termed computa-
tionally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA), was reverse trans-
lated and optimized for expression in mammalian cells, including codon
usage and RNA optimization (Genewiz, Washington, DC, USA). Nine
H1N1 HA constructs were synthesized and inserted into the pTR600 ex-
pression vector, as previously described (14). We designed COBRA HA
antigens to represent different antigenic spaces. For example, HA COBRA
designated as A1, was generated with HA sequences from human viruses
isolated between 1918 and 2005, whereas A5 was generated using HA
sequences from human viruses isolated between 1918 and 2011, including
the pandemic 2009 strains (Table 1). Additionally, X1 HA COBRA se-
quence was generated using sequences from 1918 to 2012 but layered in a
different way than A5. X2 HA COBRA was based upon sequences from
viruses isolated between 1933 and 1947 which represents the post-1918
time period but early viral evolution in humans. X3 HA COBRA was
designed using sequences from viruses isolated over a recent 30-year pe-
riod (1978 to 2008), X5 HA COBRA uses sequences from the last 20 years
(1982 to 2012), and X6 HA COBRA was based upon sequences represent-
ing the last �10 years (1999 to 2012). The HA amino acid sequences were
aligned, and the most common amino acid at each position was deter-
mined resulting in primary consensus sequences representing each anti-
genic group within each subclade (Fig. 1). Each COBRA HA structure was
generated using the 3D-JIGSAW algorithm (15, 16), and renderings were
performed using MacPyMol (Fig. 2). A phylogenetic tree was inferred
from hemagglutinin amino acid sequences using the maximum likelihood
method, and clade/subclade groupings were identified using Jalview
(Dundee, United Kingdom) (Fig. 3A).

 In vitro expression. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (1 �
106) were transiently transfected with 3 �g DNA expressing each COBRA
or wild-type HA gene cassette. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37°C and
then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and clarified supernatant harvested fol-
lowing centrifugation. Cell lysates were then electrophoresed on a 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAG) and transferred to
a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The blot was probed with
pooled mouse antisera from infections with A/Brisbane/57/2007 and
A/California/07/2009 viruses. HA-antibody complexes were then de-
tected using goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). HRP activity was de-
tected using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rock-
ford, IL, USA) and exposed to X-ray film (Thermo Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA,
USA).
Functional characterization. To determine receptor-binding charac-
teristics, virus-like particles (VLPs) containing COBRA HA proteins were
purified from the supernatants of mammalian cell lines as previously de-
scribed (13). HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids
expressing HIV Gag, COBRA HA, and neuraminidase NA (A/mallard/
Alberta/24/01; H7N3) and incubated for 72 h at 37°C. Supernatants were
collected, and VLPs were purified via ultracentrifugation (100,000 � g
through 20% glycerol, weight per volume) for 4 h at 4°C. The pellets were
subsequently resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2,
and stored at �80°C until use. Protein concentration was determined by
Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL, USA). COBRA HA VLPs were prepared in various amounts as mea-
sured by total HA protein, and each individual preparation was 2-fold
serially diluted in v-bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume of 1%
horse erythrocytes (RBCs) (Lampire Biological Products, Pipersville, PA,
USA) in PBS was added to the diluted VLPs and incubated for 60 min at
room temperature. The HA titer was determined by the reciprocal dilu-
tion of the last well that contained agglutinated RBCs.
Cartography methods. Human, influenza A (subtype H1N1) hemag-
glutinin protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI Influenza Virus
Resource database, trimmed to remove signal peptides, transmembrane
regions, and cytoplasmic tails, and the resulting ectodomain sequences
were aligned using MAFFT (17). The pairwise dissimilarity matrix was
calculated from the multiple-sequence alignment based on the Hamming
distance between pairs of sequences with no prior assumptions regarding
the function or structure of the sequences. Principal component analysis
(PCA) was applied to the dissimilarity matrix for the purpose of dimen-
sion reduction and to facilitate visualization of the relative distances be-
tween HA proteins. The first two or three principal components were
retained for visualizing protein relationships in sequence space and rep-
resent a reasonable approximation of the general structure of the phylo-
genetic tree. Calculations were performed using custom scripts written in
python and R.
Antigenicity determination by monoclonal antibody binding. To
confirm antigenicity of cell surface-expressed COBRA HAs, HEK 293FT
cells (1 � 106) were transiently transfected with 2 �g DNA encoding each
COBRA HA or wild-type HA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technolo-
gies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected cells were
harvested 24 h posttransfection by gentle dissociation with TrypLE Ex-
press (Life Technologies) and labeled by using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Far
Red Dead Cell Stain kit (Life Technologies) to determine cell viability.
Labeled cells were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) prior to staining with 0.4 �g of anti-HA stem monoclonal antibody
(MAb) C179 (TaKaRa) or anti-HA MAb analogues to human neutralizing
antibodies directed against the head regions (5J8 [18]), and 4K8 [12]),
followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse or anti-
human IgG secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Stained cells were
analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and the
results were analyzed using FlowJo software. All mean fluorescence inten-
sity (MFI) values were corrected by subtracting background fluorescence
in mock-transfected cells. Corrected MFI values were expressed as a ratio
using A/New Caledonia/20/99 HA as a reference for C179 and A/Califor-
nia/07/09 as a reference for the 5J8 and 4K8 MAb analogues. Anti-HA
head MAb binding values were further standardized for expression levels
by correcting MFI values based on binding of a MAb directed against a
conserved epitope in the HA stem region.
Vaccine preparation. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected
with plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag (optimized for expression in mam-

HA-specific content was determined by densitometry of reducing

electrophoresed on a 4 to 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAG in morpholinepropane-
sulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Life

monoclonal antibody 15B7 (Immune Technology Corporation, New
York, NY), and the HA-antibody complexes were detected by transillu-
minating fluorescence from a biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG and the
WesternDot 625 Western blot kit (Life Technologies). A gel run under
identical conditions was stained with Sypro Ruby stain (Life Technolo-

from 17 representative H1N1 isolates and also the COBRA HA using the maximum likelihood method. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE 3.7 software, and
the alignment was refined by Gblocks 0.91b software. Phylogeny was determined using the maximum likelihood method with PhyML software. Trees were
rendered using TreeDyn 198.3 software (45). The NCBI accession numbers for the HA sequences used in phylogeny inference were obtained through the
Influenza Virus Resource (46). (B) Genetic map of the HA of H1N1 viruses isolated between 1918 and 2013 that was generated from the numbers of amino acid

on the x and y axes. The clusters are colored according to the era of isolation. The spheres that represent each COBRA HA are shown in green. (C) Binding of
neutralizing anti-HA monoclonal antibodies to mammalian expressed COBRA HA proteins. Wild-type and COBRA HAs expressed on the surfaces of HEK
293FT cells were labeled with stem-specific C179 monoclonal antibody or analogues to head-specific 5J8 and 4K8 monoclonal antibodies before analysis by flow
cytometry. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were corrected by subtracting background fluorescence in mock-transfected cells and are shown as a ratio
compared to MFI obtained with wild-type HA reference (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 HA for C179 monoclonal antibody or A/California/07/2009 for 4K8 and 5J8
monoclonal antibody analogues). The presence of an asterisk (MFI ratio*) indicates that the ratios have been normalized for HA protein expression levels based
on binding of control antibody to conserved HA stem epitope, which is necessary to correct for differential levels of expression. NT, not tested. (D) Electron

 One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Molecular weights were calculated
for all bands relative to MagicMarkXP standards (Life Technologies). The
HA band was identified on the Sypro Ruby-stained gel as the one migrat-
ing at the same molecular weight for HA as determined from the Western
blot. The densities of HA bands from recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/1934
HA standards (Immune Technology Corp.) were used to generate stan-
dard curves. The amounts of HA in the purified VLP lanes were calculated
by interpolation from the data of the standard curve. Experiments were
performed in duplicate or triplicate, and multiple exposure times were
analyzed for all iterations. Inactivated influenza virus (IIV) split vaccines
were provided by Sanofi Pasteur.
Electron microscopy. VLP samples were adsorbed onto freshly glow-
discharged carbon-stabilized Parlodion-coated 400-mesh copper grids
(Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). The grids were then rinsed with
buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 120 mM KCl, negatively
stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.2), and then dried by blot-
ting onto filter paper (Whatman no. 1). VLPs were visualized on a Hitachi
H-7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies
America, Schaumburg, IL) operating at 80 kV and digitally captured with
a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera at 5-megapixel resolution (Ad-
vanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA).
Mouse studies. BALB/c mice (Mus musculus, females, 6 to 8 weeks
old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA)
and housed in microisolator units and allowed free access to food and
water and were cared for under USDA guidelines for laboratory animals.
All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice (16 mice per group) were vac-
cinated with purified VLPs (3.0 �g) based upon HA content from the
densitometry assay or they were vaccinated with the monovalent inacti-
vated split influenza vaccine, via intramuscular injection at week 0 and
then boosted with the same vaccine at the same dose at weeks 4 and 8. In
other cases, mice were primed with one VLP vaccine and boosted with a
different vaccine. In addition, some mice were administered a cocktail of
H1N1 COBRA VLP vaccines (1.5-�g dose of each of the two vaccines) or
phosphate-buffered saline alone as a mock vaccination. Vaccines at each
dose were formulated with an emulsified squalene-in-water adjuvant
(Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France). The final concentration after mixing 1:1
with VLPs is 2.5% squalene. Twenty-eight days after each vaccination,
blood samples were collected from anesthetized mice via the retro-orbital
plexus and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The tubes were centri-
fuged, and serum samples were removed and frozen at �20°C � 5°C.
Four weeks after final vaccination, mice were challenged intranasally
with 1 � 106 PFU (10 50% lethal doses [LD50]) of the A/California/07/
2009 (H1N1) in a volume of 50 �l. After infection, mice were monitored
daily for weight loss, disease signs, and death for 14 days after infection. At
days 2 and 3 postinfection, five mice were sacrificed per time point for
determination of viral lung titers. Individual body weights and death were
recorded for each group on each day after inoculation. The experimental
endpoint was defined as �20% weight loss. All procedures were per-
formed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (19), Animal Welfare Act (20), and Biosafety in Microbiological
and Biomedical Laboratories (21).
HAI assay. The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay was used to
assess functional antibodies to the HA able to inhibit agglutination of
turkey erythrocytes. The protocol was adapted from the CDC laboratory-
based influenza surveillance manual (22). To inactivate nonspecific inhib-
itors, sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka
Seiken, Co., Japan) prior to being tested (14, 23–26). Briefly, three parts of
RDE was added to one part of sera and incubated overnight at 37°C. RDE
was inactivated by incubation at 56°C for �30 min. RDE-treated sera were
diluted in a series of twofold serial dilutions in in v-bottom microtiter
plates. An equal volume of each H1N1 virus, adjusted to approximately 8
hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 �l, was added to each well. The plates
were covered and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 1%
turkey erythrocytes (Lampire Biologicals, Pipersville, PA, USA) in PBS
were added. Red blood cells were stored at 4°C and used within 72 h of
preparation. The plates were mixed by agitation and covered, and the
RBCs were allowed to settle for 1 h at room temperature (18). The HAI
titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last well that con-
tained nonagglutinated RBCs. Positive and negative serum controls were
included for each plate. All mice were negative (HAI � 1:10) for preexist-
ing antibodies to currently circulating human influenza viruses prior to
vaccination.
Plaque assay. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were plated
(5 � 105) in each well of a six-well plate. Samples were diluted (final
dilution factors of 100 to 10�6) and overlaid onto the cells in 100 �l of
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicil-
lin-streptomycin and incubated for 1 h. Samples were removed, cells were
washed twice, and medium was replaced with 2 ml of L15 medium plus
0.8% agarose (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) and incubated for 72
h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Agarose was removed and discarded. The cells
were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and then stained with 1% crystal
violet for 15 min. Following thorough washing in distilled water (dH2O)
to remove excess crystal violet, the plates were allowed to dry, the numbers
of plaques were counted, and the numbers of PFU per milliliter were
calculated.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance of the antibody data was
determined using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonfer-
roni’s posttest to analyze differences between each vaccine group for the
different test antigens (multiparametric). Differences in weight loss, sick-
ness score, and viral titers were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, followed by
Bonferroni’s posttest for each vaccine group at multiple time points. Sta-
tistical significance was defined as P value of �0.05. Statistical analyses
were done using GraphPad Prism software.
Nucleotide sequences. The sequences for all nine COBRA HAs have
been reported in U.S. patent filings patent US 9,212,207 B2, 14/388,726,
and filing patent US 14/126,550.
RESULTS
Design of H1N1 COBRA HA genes. Previous studies from our
laboratory used the COBRA methodology to design H5N1 HA
sequences to account for various clades and subclades of H5N1, as
well as outbreaks using sequences obtained from viruses collected
over an approximately 5-year span of time (13). A similar method
was designed for the generation of COBRA HA genes for H1N1;
however, these designs took into account the evolution of H1N1
influenza viruses isolated in humans over a ca. 100-year span of
time, and therefore, the diversity of the HAs from H1N1 influenza
viruses is quite large (Fig. 1A). Viruses isolated represent different
antigenic eras of H1N1 HA sequences that result in a higher diver-
sity of sequence variation. The COBRA design utilized these
chronologically different eras of H1N1 HA sequences to account
for the unique antigenic types of HA domains. HA sequences were
designed both chronologically, as well as by species from which
influenza virus was isolated. An example of the COBRA sequence
alignments is shown in Fig. 1B. Primary consensus sequences were
then aligned, and the most common amino acid was chosen re-
sulting in secondary consensus sequences. The secondary and ter-
tiary consensus sequences were aligned, and the most common
amino acid at each position was selected resulting in the final
consensus sequence referred to by one of 9 H1N1 COBRA HA
designations (Table 1). Three of the H1N1 COBRA designs, A1,
A5, and X1, encompassed HA sequences that represented the last
�100 years of H1N1 history (Table 1). A1 contains only seasonal
H1N1 HA sequences. The X2 sequence represented a historical era
of H1N1 from 1933 to 1947, and three COBRA sequences repre-
sented the modern era of H1N1 with X3 (1978 to 2008), X5 (1982
to 2012), and X6 (1999 to 2012). X3 does not contain pandemic

sequence as A1; however, the glycosylation sites at amino acid
142 and 177 have been mutated to prevent glycosylation. Last,
P1 represents a unique set of H1N1 HA sequences isolated from
both human and swine species. The sequences used in the
methodology included HA sequences isolated from humans
between 1933 and 1957 and between 2009 and 2011, as well as
swine HA sequences from viruses isolated between 1933 and
1998. Using a predictive structural modeling of COBRA H1N1
HA sequences, three-dimensional trimerized HA proteins were
designed for five COBRA HA sequences and five wild-type HA
sequences (Fig. 2).
VLPcharacterizationoftheH1N1COBRAHAVLPvaccines.
The design and characterization of the COBRA HA proteins have
been described previously (10–13). Despite nearly identical pre-
dicted structures, the COBRA HA proteins did have subtle differ-
ences in the major antigenic binding and receptor-binding sites.
Phylogenetic analysis of the COBRA HA proteins indicated that
each molecule clustered with different representative wild-type
vaccine strains (Fig. 3A). The P1 COBRA HA located on the tree
with the swine-like viruses (A/California/07/2009 [CA/09], New
Jersey/8/1976 [NJ/76], and South Carolina/1/1918 [SC/1918])
and the X1, X2, and A5 COBRA HAs clustered with historical
H1N1 viruses. The X3, X4, X5, X6, and A1 H1N1 COBRA HA
proteins clustered with the more modern seasonal H1N1 viruses.
Similar to the phylogenetic analysis, each COBRA HA locates on a
two-dimensional PCA plot with different clusters of seasonal
H1N1 influenza viruses (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, a BLAST search
using each of the COBRA HA sequences revealed that each se-
quence was a unique sequence that has not been isolated from the
environment (data not shown).
Binding of monoclonal antibodies to the influenza virus HA
head and stem domains. COBRA or wild-type HA proteins were
expressed on the surfaces of HEK 293FT cells and used to test the
binding of three previously characterized monoclonal antibodies
using flow cytometry (17, 27–29). The monoclonal antibody C179
binds to conformational epitopes in the conserved stem domain
of H1N1 HA proteins (30). As expected, C179 monoclonal anti-
body bound all tested wild-type and COBRA HA proteins al-
though with varying efficiencies indicating exposure of different
known epitopes on the surfaces of the various HA proteins. In
contrast, the two HA head-specific monoclonal antibodies bound
to some, but not all, COBRA and wild-type HA proteins (Fig. 3C).
The 5J8 monoclonal antibody bound to the HA from modern
seasonal isolates A/Chile/1/1983 (Chile/83), A/Texas/36/91 (TX/
91), A/Singapore/6/86 (Singapore/86), and A/California/07/2009
(CA/09). Significantly, 5J8 and 4K8 antibodies failed to bind the
HA from A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (NC/99) or A/Brisbane/59/
2007 (Bris/07), consistent with the poor neutralizing activity ex-
hibited by these antibodies against both influenza H1N1 strains
(28, 29). In the case of COBRA antigens, 5J8 bound to the majority
of designs except for X2, which was not recognized by any of the
head-specific antibodies tested. In contrast, the 4K8 antibody ef-
ficiently bound to X1 and P1 with similar antibody binding to
pandemic CA/09 HA. Interestingly, 4K8 also bound to X4, but not
to A1, suggesting that removal of glycosylation sites on A1 may
have contributed to unmasking the 4K8 epitope. Overall, the pat-
tern of monoclonal antibody binding indicates that each of the
COBRA HA proteins have differently exposed epitopes and there-
fore may have different antigenic properties.
Characterization of virus-like particle vaccines expressing
COBRA HA. COBRA and wild-type HA VLP vaccines were ad-
sorbed and visualized by electron microscopy (Fig. 3D). Each VLP
had a classic viral core structure with visible spike proteins repre-
senting HA and NA gene products. With the exception of CA/09
VLPs, the surface glycoproteins were uniform in size and distri-
bution. CA/09 VLPs had fewer and more irregular surface glyco-
proteins (Fig. 3D). All wild-type and COBRA VLPs were designed
to express a mismatched NA from the N3 subtype (taxonomy
identifier [ID] 333366, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Vaccinated mice challenged with pandemic H1N1 influenza
virus. To determine the protective efficacy of each H1N1 COBRA
vaccine, mice were vaccinated using different regimens and then
challenged with CA/09 influenza virus. BALB/c mice (n � 11)
were vaccinated twice at 4-week intervals via intramuscular injec-
tion with purified COBRA HA VLPs (3 �g based upon HA con-
tent) with one of the nine H1N1 COBRA HA VLP vaccines plus an
oil-in-water-based adjuvant (proprietary to Sanofi Pasteur). Mice
were then challenged with CA/09 influenza virus (1 � 106 PFU)
on day 84. Mice vaccinated with P1 VLPs or the CA/09 influenza
monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) were protected
from weight loss and death, while mock-vaccinated animals rap-
idly lost weight and reached experimental endpoints between 6
and 7 days postinfection (dpi) (Fig. 4). All other COBRA VLP-
vaccinated mice lost between 10 and 20% of body weight by day 6
or 7 postinfection and then slowly began to recover weight (Fig.
4A). Even though mice vaccinated with the X6 VLP lost weight, all
the mice survived the influenza virus challenge (Fig. 4C). In con-
trast, other mouse groups demonstrating weight loss ultimately
had between 25% (X5) and 50% (X2, X3, A1, and A5) survival.
Similar results were observed using seasonal H1N1 IIV (Fig. 4B).
Mock-vaccinated mice all died by day 7 postinfection.
H1N1 COBRA HA VLP vaccines elicit broadly reactive anti-
body responses. In order to determine the breadth of the vaccine-
elicited antibodies, serum was collected from vaccinated mice on
day 84, following the third vaccination (Fig. 5). Mice vaccinated
with each of the three monovalent IIV vaccines elicited antibodies
that had HAI activity against different sets of H1N1 influenza
viruses (Fig. 5K to M). Mice vaccinated with the Bris/07 or NC/99
IIV vaccine had HAI activity exceeding 1:40 against four seasonal
viruses isolated from 1995 to 2007 with little or no activity against
the remaining 15-member H1N1 viral panel. Vaccination with the
CA/09 IIV vaccine elicited high HAI antibodies against the two
pandemic H1N1 strains (CA/09 and Philadelphia/1/2013 [Phil/
13]) and SC/18 (Fig. 5M). All vaccinated mice had high-titer an-
ti-HA antibodies that bound to recombinant HA derived from the
CA/09 and Bris/07 viruses as detected by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) (data not shown).
Although all COBRA HA VLP vaccines elicited similar IgG
titers, COBRA-vaccinated animals had HAI antibodies that rec-
ognized different sets of viruses from the H1N1 panel (Fig. 5).
Mice vaccinated with the X3, X5, X6, and A1 VLP vaccine candi-
dates had HAI titers against a set of seasonal influenza viruses
from 1986 to 2006. Only mice vaccinated with the X6 VLP candi-
dates detected the Bris/07 virus and the viruses representing the
viruses circulating in 1943 to 1983 were occasionally detected. The
X4 and A1 VLP vaccine candidates had high HAI activity against
Sing/86 and TX/91 but little or low HAI activity against other

 viruses in the panel (Fig. 5D and E). Mice vaccinated with the X1
VLPs had low-titer antibodies that recognized viruses from 1978
to 1991 (Fig. 5A). The X2 VLP candidate had robust HAI activity
against the oldest viruses in the panel (1934 to 1947) and little
activity against any of the other H1N1 strains (Fig. 5B). The only
VLP candidate that elicited HAI-specific antibodies against the
pandemic H1N1 strains were P1 and X1. All of the mice vacci-
nated with P1 had HAI activity against both CA/09 and Phil/13
viruses. In addition to the two pandemic H1N1 viruses, mice vac-
cinated with P1 also had low HAI activity against four other sea-
sonal H1N1 viruses, as well as NJ/76 and SC/18 for a total of eight
viruses recognized by the vaccine-elicited sera (Fig. 5I). This was
the broadest HAI activity elicited by any of the H1N1 COBRA HA
VLP vaccine candidates.
In order to enhance the breadth of elicited HAI activity by
H1N1 COBRA HA VLP vaccine candidates, mice were vaccinated
with different combinations of the COBRA VLPs in a prime-boost
strategy, and sera were tested for HAI activity on day 56 postvac-
cination. Mice were vaccinated with one of four H1N1 COBRA
VLP candidates (X1, X3, X6, and P1) in multiple prime-boost
combinations. Mice vaccinated with prime-boost combinations
of the X1 and X6 COBRA VLPs had little HAI activity against any
of the 15 viruses in the panel (data not shown), whereas mice
primed with X3 and boosted with X6 had HAI activity against
Sing/86, Beijing/1995 (Bei/95), NC/99, and Solomon Island/2006
(SI/06) (data not shown). Other vaccine combinations elicited
little or low HAI activity. There was no activity against pandemic
H1N1 (2009 to 2013) or historical H1N1 strains (1934 to 1957) by
any of these combinations of vaccine candidates. In contrast, mice
vaccinated with combinations containing the P1 COBRA VLP
candidate elicited antibodies that recognized different sets of
H1N1 viruses. Mice primed with P1 VLPs and then boosted with
either X3 or X6 VLPs had high HAI activity against four seasonal
(A/Weiss/43 [Weiss/43], Sing/86, Bei/95, and NC/99) and the two
pandemic H1N1 viruses. When X3 VLPs were used to prime mice
and those mice were boosted with P1, HAI activity against the
same four seasonal viruses were detected, but there was no HAI
detected against the two pandemic viruses. Interestingly, priming
with P1 COBRA VLPs elicits higher HAI titers than boosting with
P1 COBRA VLPs. P1 and X1 combinations were quite poor. Prim-
ing with P1 and boosting with X1 elicited HAI activity against
only the pandemic strains, and there was no detectable HAI
activity when mice were primed with X1 VLPs and boosted
with any other COBRA VLP candidate. Interestingly, the HAI

observation period. Three mice were sacrificed on day 3 postinfection to assess lung titers; therefore, the weights for 5 mice were recorded for the entire 14 days.

 activity of mice primed with P1 and boosted with X3 VLPs was
similar to the HAI activities of mice treated with combinations
of P1 and X6 VLPs.
To test additional potential immunization regimens, some
groups of mice received a third vaccination on day 56 with one of
the vaccine candidates administered in the two prior immuniza-
tions (Fig. 6). Mice primed with P1 VLPs and then boosted with
either X6 or X3 COBRA VLP vaccines and then boosted again with
P1 VLPs had serum HAI activity against the same 10 viruses (out
of 15) in the panel (Fig. 6A and D). When the same prime-boost
regimens were instead followed by a third immunization with X3
or X6 COBRA VLPs, the animals had HAI activity against the
same seasonal viruses in the panel but reduced HAI activity
against the SC/18, NJ/76, CA/09, and Phil/13 (Fig. 6B and E).
Priming with X3 COBRA VLPs and boosting with P1 VLPs fol-
lowed by another boost of P1 VLPs elicited HAI activity in 9 of the
15 viruses (Fig. 6H), whereas administering X3 as the third VLP
vaccination elicited antibodies with HAI activity against only 5
seasonal viruses (Fig. 6G).
Heterologous cocktail third vaccination. On day 56, some
groups of mice that were given a heterologous prime-boost vacci-
nation regimen were divided into subgroups and given a cocktail
of their first two vaccinations as their third vaccination (Fig. 6C, F,
and I). Mice primed with P1 COBRA VLPs, boosted with X6
COBRA VLPs, followed by a third cocktail vaccination of P1/X6,
had HAI activity against 10 viruses in the H1N1 panel on day 84
(Fig. 6C). Similar results were observed using a similar regimen
with P1 and X3 VLP combinations (Fig. 6F). Both sets of mice had
HAI activity against SC/18, Weiss/43, Sing/86, Bei/95, NC/99, and
CA/09. To a lesser extent, A/Fort Monmouth/1/47 (FM/47),
Chile/83, A/Texas/36/91 (TX/91), SI/06, Bris/07, and Phil/13 were
also detected. Mice administered X3 as the prime, followed by P1
VLP boost and boosted again with the P1/X3 VLP cocktail had
similar activities but lower titers to SC/18, CA/09, and Phil/13
(Fig. 6I).
HAI activity against H1N1 strains by cocktail mixtures of
H1N1COBRAHAVLPvaccines.SinceeachoftheH1N1COBRA

strains, we decided to mix cocktails of COBRA VLP candidates
together with the goal of stimulating the broadest breadth of HAI
activity against the panel of 15 H1N1 isolates (Fig. 7). The main
rationale for using cocktails was to increase the breadth of HAI

group of mice (n � 11) vaccinated three times (days 0, 28, and 56) with 1 of the 9 COBRA VLP vaccines or with 3 of the inactivated influenza virus (IIV) vaccines
against a panel of 15 H1N1 influenza viruses. The CA/09 VLP was used as a control wild-type HA VLP. Values are the geometric mean titers plus standard errors

 responses over and above what can be achieved using a monova-
lent approach, using an immunization regimen more compatible
with a final vaccine product. Mice were vaccinated with different
combinations of two H1N1 COBRA VLP vaccine candidates si-
multaneously (1.5-�g dose of each VLP vaccine). On day 84, after
three vaccinations, mice vaccinated with a cocktail of X1 and X3
VLPs (Fig. 7F) had HAI activity against three viruses in the panel
(Sing/86, Bei/95, and NC/99), and mice vaccinated with a cocktail
of X1 and X6 VLPs (Fig. 7H) recognized only NC/99 and SI/06.
However, mice vaccinated with X3 and X6 VLPs simultaneously
had HAI activity against seven seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses
(Weiss/43, A/Denver/1/1957 [Den/57], Sing/86, Bei/95, NC/99,
SI/06, and Bris/07) (Fig. 7E). The X3/X6 cocktail combination was
the only COBRA vaccine to effectively elicit antibodies that de-
tected Bris/07 and Den/57. When mice were vaccinated with cock-
tails containing the P1 VLPs, all mice had HAI activity against
SC/18, CA/09, and Phil 13 (Fig. 7A to D). Cocktails of P1 and X6
elicited antibodies with HAI activity against viruses from 1986 to
2006 but little or no activity against earlier H1N1 isolates or
Bris/07 (Fig. 7B). Cocktails of P1 and X3 elicited antibodies with
HAI activity against viruses from 1986 to 2006, as well as NJ/76,
Weiss/43, but low HAI activity against CA/09 and Phil/13 (Fig.
7A). Mice vaccinated with a triple cocktail of X1, X6, and P1 (1 �g
of each VLP vaccine) had HAI activity against 10 H1N1 viruses in
the panel, albeit generally at low levels (Fig. 7D).
HAI activity against H1N1 strains by cocktail mixtures of
wild-type H1N1 HA VLP vaccines. In order to determine the
breadth of HAI activity against the panel of H1N1 strains that was
unique to the HA COBRA vaccines, three wild-type HA genes
were selected from the NC/99, Bris/07, and CA/09 influenza
strains and used to generate VLPs with N3 NA in a similar manner
as the COBRA VLPs. These VLP vaccines were used to vaccinate
mice in a prime-boost-boost regimen with homologous VLPs or
in various combinations of heterologous vaccination (Fig. 8). At
both week 8 after two vaccinations (data not shown) and week 12
after the third vaccination, mice vaccinated with NC/99 and
Bris/07 VLPs or CA/09 VLPs (three times) elicited antibodies that
had HAI activity against each homologous virus and 1 to 3 of the
other 17 viruses in the panel (Fig. 8A to C). When these wild-type
HA VLPs were used in a cocktail or prime-boost regimen, there
was no increase in the breadth of HAI activity against the panel of
viruses, but rather a blending of the two responses (Fig. 8). This is
in contrast with the same regimens using COBRA HA VLPs,
where the elicitation of antibodies expanded the number of vi-
ruses in the H1N1 panel (Fig. 6 and 7). Therefore, the COBRA HA
VLPs, when used in combination, had more HAI activity against a
broader number of viruses not included in the sequences used to
design the COBRA HA sequence. The wild-type HA VLP elicited
antibodies with a narrow breadth of HAI activity than the COBRA
HA proteins did.

were determined for each group of mice vaccinated three times (on days 0, 28, and 56) with combinations of the 3 COBRA VLP vaccines against a panel of 15
H1N1 influenza viruses. Panels C, F, and I were vaccinated with a cocktail of the prime-boost vaccines as the third vaccination. Values are the geometric mean
titers plus standard errors of the means (SEM) (error bars) from antisera collected on day 84. Dotted lines indicate the 1:40 HAI titer.

 Vaccinated mice challenged with CA/09 virus. Groups of
mice were challenged with CA/09 influenza virus (1 � 106 PFU)
on day 56 and day 84. Mice vaccinated with any prime-boost com-
bination including the P1 VLPs had an average weight loss of less
than 7%, except for mice primed with X1 and boosted with P1,
which lost 13% of their original weight by day 6 postinfection
following infection at day 56 (Fig. 9A) and at day 84 (Fig. 9B and
C). All other prime-boost vaccinated mice lost between 10 and
20% of body weight by day 6 or 7 postinfection. Mice that did not
reach 20% weight loss by day 7 typically recovered. All mock-
vaccinated mice lost greater than 20% body weight, and all were
humanely euthanized by day 7 postinfection.
For cocktail-vaccinated mice, again vaccine regimens contain-
ing P1 VLPs were better protected against CA/09 challenge than
mice vaccinated with other COBRA VLP vaccine candidate cock-
tails (Fig. 9D and E). Mice vaccinated with a cocktail of P1 and X3
VLPs had no signs of morbidity and weight loss, whereas mice
vaccinated with other cocktails containing P1 VLPs lost on aver-
age 5 to 7% body weight. Mice vaccinated with cocktail candidates
not containing P1 VLPs lost between 15 and 20% body weight,
with few mice surviving beyond day 7 in any group. Mice vacci-
nated with P1 COBRA VLPs were protected against CA/09 virus
challenge as well as mice vaccinated with control CA/09 VLPs or
CA/09 IIV monovalent vaccines were (Fig. 9F). Interestingly, vac-
cination of mice with N1 neuraminidase (CA/09), but not N3,
protected mice against severe weight loss and disease.
On day 3 postinfection, all mice primed with P1 VLPs had little
or no detectable viral titers in their lungs (Fig. 10A and B), which
was similar to mice vaccinated with either of the CA/09 vaccines.
Mice primed with X3 or X6 COBRA VLPs and boosted with P1
VLPs had moderate viral lung titers. Mice vaccinated with any
other prime-boost regimens of COBRA VLPs, except X6, had viral
lung titers greater than 10e�6 PFU/g, which was similar to mock-
vaccinated mice. Mice vaccinated with any cocktail containing P1
VLPs had virtually no detectable viral titers in their lungs (Fig. 10C
and D). Viral lung titers were greater than 10e�6 PFU/g in mice
vaccinated with any other cocktail regimen.
DISCUSSION
Current licensed influenza vaccines induce hemagglutination in-
hibition (HAI) antibodies that do not cross-react with influenza
strains that have undergone genetic drift. There is an urgent un-
met need for more broadly protective seasonal influenza vaccines
with greater breadth, enhanced potency, and durability of HAI
responses. It is currently impossible to predict which antigenic
variants may evolve, and therefore, novel vaccine candidates are

 needed that will elicit immunity to potential variants. Recently, we
designed a new technology termed COBRA as a universal/more
broadly reactive vaccine approach for both emerging/pandemic
influenza viruses and currently circulating influenza subtypes. We
have published a series of studies demonstrating the effectiveness
of the COBRA HA antigens for H5N1 (11–13).
This method was applied to address the diversity within the
H1N1 HA and yields a vaccine that elicits increased breadth of
antibody response within the H1 influenza subtype. The method
uses multiple rounds of consensus building based upon not only
the phylogenetic sequence of each isolate but also the outbreak
and specific time that each isolate was collected, thereby eliminat-
ing the bias in the number of sequences uploaded to online data-
bases. Often similar or virtually identical HA sequences are listed
in NCBI or GISAID databases that represent individual strains.
This is primarily due to the fact that numerous isolates are col-
lected and sequenced from a single outbreak from a human or
zoonotic source in a single location at one specific period of time.
Therefore, in reality, often these sequences actually represent one
“antigenic type” or “sequence” of HA collected from thousands of
viral isolates and not thousands of individual viral isolates. This
repetition of HA sequences in the database accounts for the limi-
tation inherent in using these sequences for identification of
highly immunogenic, cross-reactive sets of epitopes for vaccine
design. Using multiple rounds of consensus building and weight-
ing each of these isolates for sequence, outbreak group, and time
of isolation eliminates this bias and allows COBRA designs to
retain highly immunogenic and cross-reactive epitopes.
In this study, nine independent COBRA HA genes were de-
signed to elicit anti-HA antibodies directed at the head domain of
the H1N1 HA. Some of the COBRA HA proteins were designed
using H1N1 HA sequences that represent specific recent periods
of time (X3, X5, and X6), whereas other HA COBRA proteins were
designed using HA sequences from viruses isolated from 1918 to
present (A1, A5, and X1) to cover almost the entire known anti-
genic history of H1N1 influenza virus evolution in humans (Table
1). Other HA COBRA proteins were designed to address specific
hypotheses (X2, X4, and P1).
Four of the H1N1 COBRA HA proteins (X1, X3, X6, and P1)
were further characterized. Of all the COBRA vaccine candidates,
the P1 COBRA VLPs elicited antibodies that had HAI activity
against both pandemic and seasonal influenza strains (Fig. 5).
Even though X1, X3, and X6 did not prevent weight loss following
CA/09 virus challenge, these vaccines did elicit HAI antibodies
against most seasonal H1N1 strains isolated in the last 30 years
(Fig. 5), which would indicate that these vaccines would elicit
broadly reactive immune response against seasonal influenza
strains. Interestingly, X1 and X6 did protect all mice against CA/09
challenge (Fig. 4). In fact, X6 had little virus detected in the lungs
of challenge mice, even though there were no HAI titers. While
this may seem unusual, in a previous study, ferrets exposed to
FM47 virus had low HAI titers, but it did protect animals against
direct infection and virus was not transmitted to other ferrets (31).
Future vaccine studies using these COBRA VLPs in ferrets will
allow for multiple challenges using both seasonal and pandemic
H1N1 viruses to demonstrate true protective efficacy against a
diverse panel of H1N1 viruses.
While there was not a single H1 COBRA design that could elicit
HAI antibodies to all viruses in the panel, collectively these vac-
cines elicited a polyclonal antibody response that did recognize all

 viruses in the panel. We speculated that presenting COBRA HA
VLP vaccines to the immune system in a prime-boost-boost reg-
imen or mixed together in a cocktail would elicit antibody re-
sponses able to recognize most, if not all, the H1N1 viruses in the
panel. We recently demonstrated that a cocktail of three H5N1
COBRA VLPs elicited antibodies that recognized H5N1 viruses
from 11 H5N1 clades/subclades isolated over a 12-year span (10).
There are structural changes between HA proteins from different
eras that may expose different epitopes on the HA molecule. In-
dividually, each of these H1N1 COBRA HA VLP vaccines most
likely elicited antibodies that neutralized antigenically related
H1N1 viruses in the panel based upon similarities in the structures
of their HA molecules. The four leading candidates were used in
various prime-boost-boost combinations. Any combination us-
ing X1, X3, or X6 COBRA VLPs resulted in broad HAI activity
against the seasonal H1N1 viruses in the panel but little or no
activity against the pandemic/swine strains (SC/18, NJ/76, CA/09,
and Phil/13). When these three COBRA VLPs were used in com-
bination with P1 VLPs, the breadth of HAI activity extended to
pandemic strains. The breadth of HAI activity was more signifi-
cant than the HAI activity elicited by combinations of VLP vac-
cines with wild-type HA protein.
It appears that the priming vaccination dose is a significant
factor in determining the viruses in the panel that will be recog-
nized by the vaccine-induced antibodies. The priming dose drives
the immune response and influences how the host responds to
subsequent booster vaccinations. If the prime vaccination was X3
COBRA VLPs, for example, it takes two booster vaccinations with
P1 VLPs to elicit antibodies with HAI activity against pandemic
strains (Fig. 6H). Priming with P1 COBRA sets the B cell reper-
toire to elicit antibodies that recognize a specific set of H1N1 vi-
ruses that include pandemic H1N1 strains. Interestingly, using a
cocktail of the first two COBRA vaccines as the third vaccination
resulted in the greatest breadth of HAI activity, activity greater
than using a single COBRA VLP alone (Fig. 6). Using the P1/X6
combination as an example, a third immunization with the P1/X6
cocktail resulted in seroprotection against 13 strains, whereas P1
or X6 used individually resulted in seroprotection against fewer
strains. Similar trends were observed for other COBRA vaccine
combinations. All studies were performed in immunologically na-
ive mice that had no preexisting immunity to influenza, and the
observed vaccine-induced immune responses were always consis-
tently broad. Most humans have a varied and extensive repertoire
of preexisting memory B cells with circulating antibodies that rec-
ognize previous H1N1 strains (32–34). The current trivalent in-
fluenza virus (IIV) has a single H1N1 strain that can recall some,
but not all, B cell memory responses. However, a COBRA HA
vaccine has the potential to recall a broader repertoire of memory

 responses and therefore protect against more antigenic H1N1
variants.
While both P1 COBRA VLPs and CA/09 VLPs elicit similar
HAI antibody titers against CA/09, CA/09 VLPs elicited higher
HAI titers against Phil/13, a pandemic H1N1 lineage virus, but not
a true genetic drift variant (Fig. 5 to 8). However, we expect that
once true genetic drift variants emerge, by definition antibodies
elicited by CA/09 virus will not recognize these new variants; how-
ever, P1 COBRA-elicited antibodies may still have the potential to
recognize these future genetic drift variants. In addition, only P1
can elicit antibodies that neutralize seasonal H1N1 strains,
whereas CA/09 VLPs do not elicit functional antibodies to any
seasonal strains. Therefore, P1 COBRA HA is a unique antigen
that has different epitopes for induction of more broadly reactive
antibodies at lower titers than HA proteins that elicit a more nar-
row breadth of high HAI activity.
Developing a universal vaccine strategy for seasonal influenza
virus subtypes has the potential to greatly impact human health. A
vaccine that protects against influenza variants within and across
subtypes will improve our understanding of the basic biology,
evolution, and transmission of influenza A virus. There are more
than 40 universal influenza vaccine candidates in development
(for reviews, see references 9, 35, and 36), but almost all of them
elicit immune responses that only modulate influenza-induced
disease and are not likely to offer the same protective capability as
a well-matched HA-based vaccine. The COBRA HA vaccines are
one of the few universal influenza vaccine candidates that elicit
immune responses that offer protection against influenza disease.
The COBRA approach refocuses the HA immunogen so as to elicit
functional antibodies that are broad in coverage within a subtype.
COBRA HA-elicited antibodies had potent HAI activity against a
broad panel of H1N1 strains isolated over several decades that was
superior to the antibodies elicited by wild-type HA vaccines (Fig.
8). In contrast to head-based universal strategies, anti-HA stem-
based approaches elicit antibodies that recognize the stem portion
of HA in isolates across several strains within a subtype (37) and
multiple subtypes within a group (38). Stem-induced antibodies,
just as head-based elicited antibodies, may function through dis-
ease modulation. However, there is no correlate of protection for
stem-induced antibodies for human vaccine studies. Some groups
have demonstrated that stem-induced antibodies may have sub-
optimal neutralization potency compared to antibodies directed
against HA head domain (39, 40), whereas other studies have
demonstrated high binding potency of these antibodies (41).
These stem epitopes may be less accessible than HA head epitopes,
and therefore, newer presentation and delivery strategies have
been developed to present HA stem regions to the immune system
more effectively (42, 43). COBRA HA-elicited antibodies have
HAI activity against the receptor binding site, which has benefits
over other universal vaccine candidates. Induction of HAI anti-
bodies is accepted as a surrogate/correlate for protective efficacy in
humans (44). Therefore, COBRA-based vaccine candidates have a
clear path forward to clinical proof of concept, unlike many other
universal vaccine candidates.
Universal influenza vaccine approaches have the potential to
be paradigm shifting for influenza vaccine landscape, with the goal
of replacement of seasonal vaccines with universal ones specifying
enhanced efficacy through their breadth and the potential for
increased durability through the use of adjuvants. The H1N1
COBRA HA VLP vaccines described in this report elicit anti-head
antibody responses against a broad number of H1N1 isolates that
cover the past 100 years. The ability of COBRA HA designs to elicit
HAI responses against future antigenically distinct H1 viruses for
which the current H1 component is a mismatch will provide a
critical assessment for their feasibility as “subtype universal” vac-
cine candidates.
