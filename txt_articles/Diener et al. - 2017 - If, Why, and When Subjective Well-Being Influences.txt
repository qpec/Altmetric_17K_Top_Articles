We review evidence on whether subjective well-being (SWB) can influence health,
why it might do so, and what we know about the conditions where this is more or
less likely to occur. This review also explores how various methodological
approaches inform the study of the connections between subjective well-being and
health and longevity outcomes. Our review of this growing literature indicates
areas where data are substantial and where much more research is needed. We con-
clude that SWB can sometimes influence health, and review a number of reasons
why it does so. A key open question is when it does and does not do so—in terms
of populations likely to be affected, types of SWB that are most influential (includ-
ing which might be harmful), and types of health and illnesses that are most likely
to be affected. We also describe additional types of research that are now much
needed in this burgeoning area of interest, for example, cross-cultural studies, ani-
mal research, and experimental interventions designed to raise long-term SWB and
assess the effects on physical health. This research area is characterised both by
potentially extremely important findings, and also by pivotal research issues and
questions.

INTRODUCTION
Literature reviews and meta-analyses of the scientific literature have generally
concluded that subjective well-being (SWB) can be beneficial to health and long-
evity. Our aim is to give a broad overview of the research and reviews in this

 area, including the mediators and moderators that help explain the effects of
SWB on health, as well as the various research methods that have been used.
Our review is designed to help scientists see more clearly where important
research is needed in this field.
Subjective Well-Being
Many different terms are used in the psychology literature to describe well-
being. Readers are referred to Diener, Oishi, and Lucas (2017) for more exten-
sive detailed coverage of this topic. “Psychological well-being” is the broadest
and most all-inclusive term. It includes “Subjective well-being”, which is how
individuals evaluate or appraise their own lives. To what degree does a person
evaluate her or his life and current situation as good and desirable versus unde-
sirable and negative? These evaluations can be either in terms of cognitive
reflections, representing reflective appraisals of life and domains of life such as
work, or can be in terms of affect. The person’s affect includes feelings of vari-
ous types, including emotions and moods. Positive affect includes the various
feelings people experience when things seem to be going well, and negative
affect is the experience that things are not going well. Positive affect includes
both momentary emotions such as enjoyment, and more chronic long-term
moods such as contentment. Negative affect includes momentary or “state” emo-
tions such as feelings of anger, sadness, stress, and worry, and also longer-last-
ing moods such as depression that occurs over time. Another form of SWB is
“optimism”, which often correlates with positive affect, but includes positive
expectations about the future.
Often a distinction is made between reflective forms of SWB and the experi-
ence of momentary SWB, although the two are correlated. Another form of
psychological well-being that has been assessed in this area is “eudaimonic”
well-being, which includes variables such as meaning and purpose in life, sup-
portive social relationships, and feelings of mastery. There is an ongoing debate
about the distinctiveness of various types of SWB, but this topic is beyond the
scope of the current review. In this review we examine the relation of different
forms of SWB, such as life satisfaction, positive affect, optimism, and low nega-
tive affect, with health and longevity. As will be seen, there is still much to be
learned about the overlapping versus distinct influences of the types of SWB on
health.
Our review is focused on the effects of somewhat enduring stable levels of
SWB rather than on the effects of momentary moods. However, the effects of
moods can be quite informative because they often indicate how SWB exerts its
effects. We do not focus on mental health in this review, as it is covered in other
reviews. However, there is substantial overlap between many of the mental
health measures that have been used and what we define as negative affect.

 Purposes of this Review
In light of the fact that a number of reviews and meta-analyses of this area have
been published, there are several purposes of the current review:
1. To examine recent evidence, as well as other types of evidence such as
research on SWB and genetic markers, and SWB effects in animal health
that have not been adequately reviewed in the health context.
2. To review how evidence drawn from different types of research method-
ologies each adds to our understanding of the pathways by which SWB
can influence health.
3. To use our multi-method review to show where the important gaps are in
the literature and the biggest areas in need of more research. By compre-
hending what each method adds, we can determine what types of informa-
tion and studies are missing from the current literature.
4. To review the literature within the framework of complex system dynam-
ics, in which the key variables are both influenced by and influence other
key variables. In this framework it is essential to search for the mediators
of the SWB and health association, as well as the moderators that make
the effects stronger or weaker. Furthermore, it is essential to understand
statistical controls in conceptual terms, and not merely as the control of
potentially confounding variables. In general a more sophisticated
approach to statistical control of possible confounds could be helpful in
this field. A dynamic systems approach alerts us to the fact that some vari-
ables that are treated as confounds in this literature can be causes or effects
of SWB, and therefore it is risky to automatically treat them as confounds.
The Value of Multiple Research Methods
Each type of research method has strengths compared to the other methods, and
therefore conclusions drawn from each method are useful. More complete under-
standing of the dynamic system connecting SWB to health can be gained if we
consider, in addition to the knowledge gained from correlational, experimental,
and longitudinal designs, nonhuman animal studies, as well as factors such as
mediation, moderation, causal modeling, and short- versus long-term mood
effects. Some laboratories rely exclusively on one method, although a more
catholic approach to methods might aid in the understanding of the issues they
are addressing. Below we list some of the strengths and limitations of each of
the various methodological approaches.
A. Correlational methods are relatively quick and inexpensive compared to
most other methods. Simple cross-sectional correlations between SWB and
health can be used to examine a spectrum of associations across large and
diverse subject samples. Such correlations can reveal the generality of the associ-
ations, and statistical controls of additional variables can help understand the
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH
135

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 linkages in the system. Correlational methods allow us to discover links in the
SWB and health system in a cost-effective and methodologically simple manner
that can focus and give direction to more intensive later studies.
B. Experimental studies can reveal causal connections in a strong way that is
usually not available when using the other methods. However, these methods
often only tell us whether an association can occur, but not whether it is a major
causal connection in the natural world. Furthermore, experiments frequently do
not make clear the context or border conditions that must be present for the con-
nection to occur. Furthermore, often it appears that the manipulated variable has
an effect, but we do not know why some participants are affected and others are
not. We also do not know about the generalisability of the findings to other cul-
tures, populations, situations, and personalities. It is possible to discover these
things through repeated experiments across many settings, samples, and cultures,
but this is often not the most efficient initial step.
Scientists who rely heavily on experimentation sometimes criticise other
methods because in using those methods one can never control all possible con-
founding variables, although one can frequently control the most obvious and
seemingly important ones. However, a parallel problem with experimentation is
that the scientist can usually not be certain of all that is being changed by the
intervention, and what the active component is with certainty. For instance, inter-
ventions to raise well-being can alter factors such as social relationships and
meaning and purpose in participants’ lives, both of which might be responsible
for health effects independently of SWB.
Health research experimentation, in particular, comes with its own unique set
of limitations. Given the goal to not harm research participants, there are few ill-
nesses that we can experimentally give to a participant (see Cohen, Alper, Doyle,
Treanor, & Turner, 2006, on the common cold and influenza for exceptions),
and, similarly, we cannot alter behaviors in a health damaging manner (e.g.
inducing smoking). Furthermore, because of the large stakes of studies experi-
menting on important health outcomes (e.g. disease survival or longevity), it is
growing more difficult to maintain adequate control groups and hold off provid-
ing participants with treatments and manipulations known to be effective in
improving wellness outcomes. Because medical researchers work with similar
constraints, they have long embraced the importance of non-experimental
research as useful, functional, and essential. Another pragmatic limitation to
long-term experimentation is that it is difficult and very costly to change peo-
ple’s long-term levels of SWB in a way that can influence future disease and
mortality outcomes, or reverse the effects that have already occurred.
A final issue should be mentioned in terms of experimentation, and that is that
philosophers, going back to Aristotle, differentiate several types of causality—it
is not a single thing. The type of causality that is studied with experimentation is
concerned with whether actions we take change the likelihood of an outcome.
The experimental methods as typically used do not tell us whether the thing we
136

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 manipulate is necessary or sufficient for the outcome, and often do not reveal the
mediators, how the events unfold over time, or the moderator and context condi-
tions required for the outcome to occur.
C. Prospective longitudinal studies can tell us whether one variable predicts
another variable later in time, and whether changes in the first variable are fol-
lowed by changes in the second. These studies complement experiments.
Although not possessing the same internal validity in terms of causal inferences,
they have the strength of being able to determine a sequence of events in the nat-
ural world. Possible confounding variables can be assessed and analyzed. Fur-
thermore, longitudinal methods can reveal the unfolding of dynamic systems
across time, as well as patterns over many years and even decades. However, it
is often argued that causality cannot be determined with as much rigor as in
experiments because one cannot be certain that all potentially confounding vari-
ables have been controlled.
D. Mediators, moderators, and causal modeling analyses seek to determine the
intervening processes that explain causal connections, as well as the broader
dynamic system that must be in place for it to occur. Mediational analyses seek
to explain why SWB influences health by examining the behavioral and physio-
logical outcomes of SWB that might in turn influence health. Moderator analyses
and causal modeling seek to determine the other contextual variables that must
be in place for the causal sequence to occur, or which make it a stronger or
weaker connection. In causal modeling we can also seek to understand the bidi-
rectional nature of causal influences.
To understand behavioral systems we must gain insight into the proximal ver-
sus distal influences on an outcome, and understand that these influences might
be related not only separately to the outcome, but also directly to each other. It is
also essential to differentiate possible third-variable explanations of the SWB
and health association from factors that might cause or result from SWB and be
an important aspect of understanding the effects of SWB.
E. Animal research is rare in the SWB and health area, but is becoming more
commonplace. It has the advantage that some of the confounding variables that
are troublesome for human research can be controlled in animal research, such
as differences in nutrition and the environment. Furthermore, experiments are
sometimes ethically permissible in animal research that cannot be conducted
with humans, allowing for stronger inferences to be made. Finally, animal
research helps us generalise the findings found in humans.
CONCLUSIONS ON THE VALUE OF MULTIPLE METHODS
The type of methodology used by researchers should be chosen based on the
questions being asked and goals of the research, rather than on a continuum of
better and worse methods. One’s initial research question, hypotheses, and goals
of the inquiry point to the best method for a particular study. In this review we
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH

 assume that each method is sometimes the best tool for answering specific ques-
tions most efficiently. Instead of awarding gold-standard status invariably to
experimentation, we suggest that the gold standard should be the method that
best fits the questions being addressed. While experimentation offers perhaps the
most rigor in terms of control, correlational studies are often a more efficient
way to answer initial inquiries, and longitudinal studies can answer questions
that are very difficult to address with experimentation alone. Furthermore, the
type of causal knowledge provided by experimentation needs to be supple-
mented with information on mediators, moderators, and considerations of the
entire dynamic system that is involved in health.
We suggest that a broad approach is needed—Scientific Understanding
Through Multiple Methodologies (SUMM). In this approach we recognise that
the phenomena in the field of human behavior and health occur in complex and
dynamic systems, and that the best way to gain a fuller understanding of these
systems is by using different methods for different aspects of the inquiry. One
can ask whether fields that have become too enamored with experimentation
have produced laboratory knowledge without knowing how much it explains
phenomena outside of the laboratory. We believe that SUMM can offer the scaf-
folding for using different methodological approaches to gain an integrated
explanation of phenomena occurring in complex systems.
PREVIOUS REVIEWS
In reviewing the studies we cite meta-analyses of that area where they are avail-
able, to ensure a more comprehensive and systematic review of each issue.
Tables 1 through 9 of this paper, and the supporting references, can be found in
the Appendix. Because meta-analyses, with their systematic location of publica-
tions and their objective method of summarising results, are methodologically
often stronger than simple literary reviews, in Table 1 first are listed the meta-
analyses of various areas that have been conducted, and then traditional literature
reviews. It can be seen that various types of SWB have been found to be associ-
ated with longevity and various health outcomes. The results occur across the
meta-analyses and literary reviews, although they are not found in all studies.
In the following sections of this paper we describe in the Appendix findings
from a number of individual studies to give readers a clear idea of the research
that has been conducted. Our aim is to give readers a broad overview of the vari-
ous methods and types of evidence that are available, with the goal of describing
the most needed research at this time. What we hope to achieve in this article is
to give a broad view of all the types of evidence that now exist, both in terms of
methodologies and also in terms of mediation and moderation. By taking a broad
approach, we are able to view the effects of various forms of SWB, and how the
outcomes of various methods do or do not converge. We hope to indicate where
more rigorous, large-scale, and probing research is needed. One area we cover is

 desirable ways to conduct statistical analyses in this field, and especially in the
area of controlling possible confounding variables. Our suggestions are applica-
ble to new research, but should also apply to re-analyses of existing data sets.
CROSS-SECTIONAL CORRELATIONAL STUDIES
In Table 2 we present a few examples of cross-sectional correlational studies. It
can be seen in the table that the correlational studies are quite diverse. Associations
have been found across nations between SWB and general health, as well as SWB
and specific health and physiological variables. Immune, cardiovascular, and
endocrine measures have all been found to be associated with several forms of
SWB. The examples of studies in Table 2 make evident that in correlational stud-
ies, even when statistical controls are applied and the observed association is clear,
researchers are unable to determine the direction of the relationship. This bidirec-
tional uncertainty limits the causal inferences that researchers are able to claim.
The strength of the correlational methodology is that it can be used to discover
initial associations between variables gleaned from large-scale, representative
samples that can often be gathered quickly and easily, or acquired from sec-
ondary sources. Efficiency, practicality, data collection and analysis on a global
scale are a few of the major advantages of this method. Furthermore, researchers
are usually able to gather relevant data without crossing ethical boundaries.
LONGITUDINAL STUDIES
Using longitudinal methods allows researchers to determine not only a temporal
ordering of events—whether SWB levels predict future health and mortality—
but also whether a change in SWB over time predicts a change in health.
Furthermore, these methods allow us to examine the natural unfolding of devel-
opmental variables over long periods of time. Because many health conditions
occur over many years or even decades, it is virtually impossible to examine their
causes using only experimental methods. Furthermore, whereas experiments ask
whether an association can occur, longitudinal designs observe this association
over time in the natural world—whether the association does occur. Longitudinal
methods allow us to view the effects of SWB in natural circumstances in inter-
play with other conditions that influence health. In Table 3 we present examples
of studies of SWB and health that have used longitudinal designs. The studies
generally show that various types of SWB are associated with greater longevity
and superior health outcomes over time. However, we will see later that these
desirable outcomes are not found for all groups of people across all studies.
Longitudinal studies provide evidence that SWB can influence both health
and mortality, but with the caveat that other uncontrolled factors might be caus-
ing the observed association. Even when controlling for a variety of possible
third variables (e.g. genetics, income), SWB frequently predicts future health.
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH
139

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 Yet, even with statistical controls longitudinal studies do not with certainty rule
out third-variable explanations of the findings. There might always be other
unobserved variables that are responsible for the association. Thus, we need
additional methods to fully resolve the third-variable problem and firmly estab-
lish directionality.
Longitudinal studies are often costly, have problems with attrition of partici-
pants, and the most appropriate measures may change as time progresses. Fur-
thermore, many of the meta-analyses find evidence of publication bias. One
possible solution to this problem includes the examination of dissertations where
the demand for significant results is lower. Furthermore, fail-safe studies suggest
that the existing findings are probably valid and not simply due to chance. Most
of the studies confirmed predictions even when sociodemographic variables were
controlled.
EXPERIMENTS DESIGNED TO RAISE LONG-TERM SWB AND
DETERMINE THE EFFECTS ON HEALTH
Long-term experiments on SWB and health or longevity include randomised
assignment of participants to conditions and the inclusion of control groups. This
method is implemented to examine the effectiveness of psychological interven-
tions to benefit health outcomes. These studies have the strength of occurring in
the natural world, as well as the control and greater certainty that comes from
randomised controlled trials. Lyubomirsky, King, and Diener (2005) reviewed
experimental evidence for the influence of SWB on health. In Table 4 are listed
experimental trials designed to raise long-term SWB and measure changes in
health and health behaviors, with over half being published since the Lyubo-
mirsky et al. review.
It can be seen in Table 4 that a number of randomised controlled trials have
now been conducted in which people’s well-being is raised and positive health
benefits ensue. Both reductions in negative affect and increases in positive affect
have been found to be related both to health behaviors and disease outcomes.
However, there are many limitations in the existing literature on experimental
interventions aimed at increasing SWB and assessing the effects on health. The
time frame of when treatments that improve people’s moods will actually pro-
duce tangible benefits to health and reduce the risk of mortality is not under-
stood. Many psychological interventions seem only modestly effective because
many of the health problems (e.g. smoking or obesity-related illness) may have
occurred over such a long time that it is difficult to counter them. Also, it can be
challenging to actually change people’s long-term SWB because of the environ-
mental and personality factors that may be impediments to change.
The majority of experiments designed to raise long-term SWB are focused on
people with chronic medical or mental conditions. This leaves open numerous
opportunities for future researchers to discover interventions that improve health
140

 outcomes in healthy community-based samples. Interventions to reduce negative
states such as depression, stress, and anxiety have received a vast amount of
research attention from mental health researchers. However, newer studies also
have been focused on raising positive emotions, and a number of these treat-
ments are promising (e.g. Friedman et al., 2017; Kushlev et al., 2017; Moskow-
itz, Hult, & Duncan, 2012; Parks & Biswas-Diener, 2013; Proyer, Gander,
Wellenzohn, & Ruch, 2014; Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005). Sin and
Lyubomirsky (2009) present a meta-analysis of the SWB treatments’ effective-
ness in altering levels of SWB, and a number of interventions appear to have
exerted a beneficial influence. Positive interventions, alone and in combination
with treatment to also lower negative emotions, are an opportunity for health
researchers to not only raise people’s quality of life, but also to experimentally
test the SWB and health connection.
As with all research approaches, there are challenges with intervention studies
designed to raise well-being. Challenges of real-world experimentation include
creating appropriate control groups, complications with random assignment to
conditions, and differential attrition between the experimental groups. In addi-
tion, there is not yet a consensus on what interventions are most likely to lead to
long-term improvements in SWB. It is not known whether treatments would be
more effective if they were targeted at the requirements of individual participants
rather than the current one-size-fits-all approach. The current studies investigat-
ing experiments designed to raise SWB are few, based on relatively small sam-
ples, and have not examined an array of health outcomes.
Shortcomings notwithstanding, the experiments altering long-term SWB have
advanced the field of well-being and health by suggesting that improvements in
well-being at least in some cases may improve health parameters. A number of
recommendations can be made. First, much of the research takes a casual
approach to selecting SWB interventions, without considering whether they are
the most effective with this population. A serious shortcoming is that the inter-
ventions have often produced only small changes in SWB, and therefore it is not
surprising when health outcomes are not found. Second, the time course of the
interventions and outcomes needs to be carefully considered. Can changes in
SWB alter the course of physiological indicators, or of disease manifestations in
the time under study? Another issue is to consider which type of SWB should be
the target of the intervention because it is likely to affect health. In some cases
this might be life satisfaction or positive affect, and in other cases it might be the
reduction of stress. Furthermore, SWB interventions that continue over time
seem most likely to produce long-term results.
RESEARCH WITH NONHUMAN ANIMALS
Although research with animals has been very helpful in many health-related
areas of research, this type of method is rare in the area of SWB. Animal studies

 have several advantages, including generalising findings more broadly than only
to humans. In addition, researchers with animals can often control factors that
confound conclusions based on human research. Besides ratings from caretakers,
animal emotional states have been assessed by methods such as cognitive bias
measures, vocalisations, and physiological methods such as studying cortisol
levels, cortical perfusion, and neuron activity. Behavioral indicators of well-
being can also be assessed. For example, Harding, Paul, and Mendl (2004)
showed that biased responding to stimuli can reveal negative emotional states in
rats just as such biases do in humans.
Research on animal samples supports the link between psychological well-
being and wound healing; rats which had an enriched environment and were not
isolation-reared showed quicker wound healing than their counterparts (Vitalo
et al., 2009). Conclusions from research on inflammation are confirmed by
research on rodents suffering stress from social defeat, revealing an up-regulation
of inflammatory markers (Powell et al., 2013). Chronic stress is widely known
to negatively influence a number of health-related factors in animals, such as
reduced reproduction (Moberg, 1985) and disturbed cardiovascular function
(Henry & Stephens-Larson, 1985). Animals under stress are immune-compro-
mised and therefore more open to disease (Marchant-Forde, 2015). In his
popular book, Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, Sapolsky (1994) explains how
short-term stress can be adaptive for animals in the wild, but can be detrimental
to health when it is chronically felt over time. The animal findings support the
conclusions from studies with humans, suggesting that stressful and negative
states can interfere with healthy physiological functioning.
There is only a very small amount of animal research on positive emotions
and health in the absence of chronic stress. Weiss, Adams, and King (2011)
found that orang-utans rated as higher in subjective well-being by zookeepers
(based on their estimates of positive moods, social life, and ability to reach
desired locations, and reach desired objects) tended to live a human equivalent
of 11 years more than the less happy apes (1 SD above versus 1 SD below the
mean). The Ben-Shaanan et al. (2016) study on stimulation of the reward system
and immune strength in rodents described in Table 6 is an impressive study of
how positive feelings might be tied to health parameters. It is evident that work
with varying levels of well-being in animals, including across the positive spec-
trum, is an area in need of future research.
MEDIATORS OF THE SWB AND HEALTH RELATIONSHIP
In order to fully understand how and why SWB affects health and longevity, the
mediators of this relationship must be understood. That is, we need to understand
what links the experiences of well-being to physical health outcomes. Ong
(2010) reviewed a number of ways that SWB may influence health and mortal-
ity, and concluded that health behaviors (e.g. better diet, regular exercise, and
142

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 improved sleep), physiological systems (e.g. cardiovascular and immune sys-
tems), and stress (exposure or undoing) are primary candidates for mediators in
the relationship. In terms of undoing the sequelae of negative emotions, research
shows that positive emotions make people more resilient to stress, with the abil-
ity to bounce back in mood and physiology more quickly after a stressor affects
their cardiovascular system (e.g. Fredrickson, Mancuso, Branigan, & Tugade,
2000).
It is imperative to discover what is happening physiologically that allows
increases in SWB to ultimately manifest itself as better health. For example, high
levels of well-being may positively alter cardiovascular function (e.g. heart rate),
and those improvements in the cardiovascular system will ultimately lead to bet-
ter health outcomes (Howell, Kern, & Lyubomirsky, 2007). The influence of dif-
ferent types of SWB may be mediated for different physiological systems by
different intermediaries. For example, while the immune system might affect
many different types of illness outcomes, the beneficial behavior of sunscreen
use might most influence the decreased likelihood of experiencing skin cancer.
There are several approaches to uncovering mediation. First, we can use sim-
ple correlational methods, and use statistical techniques to determine whether a
possible mediator can account for the covariation between SWB and health out-
comes. An extension of simple correlational approaches is to test causal models,
and often compare various possible models for the best fit. Causal models often
include measures of a number of influences on health, as well as more than one
possible mediator. They may also include several health outcome measures. By
including a number of variables in the model researchers hope to gain a more
realistic picture of how dynamic systems operate in the world. Furthermore,
these approaches are capable of taking the error of measures into account in
determining pathways of influence.
A second approach to determining mediation examines how SWB, possible
mediators, and health vary over time within individuals. Data collection methods
such as experience-sampling and ambulatory monitoring techniques have been
developed to document physiological and SWB information in real time in the
natural environment. In the momentary measurement methods,researchers can
determine whether moods and various physiological parameters that might influ-
ence health change together in a predictable way within individuals.
Besides cross-sectional correlations and momentary ecological methods,
short-term laboratory and ambulatory experiments demonstrate that manipula-
tions of mood can be accompanied by health-relevant physiological patterns.
The experimental methodology uses various tools (e.g. stimuli embedded in
videos or tasks) to temporarily activate specific emotions in order to disentangle
the relationship between the activated mood and other variables. The effective-
ness of various mood manipulations is reviewed by Joseph, Chan, Heintzelman,
Tay, and Diener (2017).

 Cardiovascular System Mediators
Consistent associations are found between SWB and cardiovascular functioning,
which in turn is related to health, cardiovascular events, and mortality. In Table 5
are listed examples of studies that explore the associations of SWB and physio-
logical and health outcomes, and a few sample studies showing that the physio-
logical measures are related to health. As can be seen, the association of SWB
and cardiovascular health has been found for short-term emotions and physiolog-
ical patterns at the moment that are beneficial to long-term health, as well as for
long-term levels of SWB and cardiovascular health.
Immune System Mediators
In Table 6 we present example studies showing an association of SWB and
immune measures, as well as a few studies revealing that immune function influ-
ences health. Based on these studies and others it seems plausible that boosted
immune function is a mediating variable that helps explain how SWB influences
health outcomes. In terms of theoretical explanations for the connection, Black and
Garbutt (2002) explain why stress leads to inflammation, which can harm health
when it is chronic. Pressman and Cohen (2005) outline how positive emotions spe-
cifically alter immune activity via endocrine, behavioral, and other activities.
Endocrine System Mediators
Certain hormones appear to be affected by SWB and momentary moods. Cortisol
is frequently associated with stress and positive affect with lower levels of corti-
sol (Steptoe, O’Donnell, Badrick, Kumari, & Marmot, 2008), including in mood
induction experiments (Buchanan, al’Absi, & Lovallo, 1999; Kirschbaum, Pirke,
& Hellhammer, 1993). Brummett, Boyle, Kuhn, Siegler, and Williams (2009)
found that positive affect was inversely related to levels of norepinephrine and
cortisol after awakening. Insulin levels may also be affected by moods. For exam-
ple, Skaff et al. (2009) showed that negative affect predicted rising blood glucose
levels the next day, while glucose one day did not predict moods the next day.
The endocrine changes are relevant to the cardiovascular and immune changes
discussed above. Sympathetic altering hormones (catecholamines) and hypotha-
lamic pituitary adrenal cortical axis hormones such as cortisol play a role in reg-
ulating these other systems, and may be an early step in SWB altering the
health-influencing mechanisms. There are other hormones that also could be
important in the SWB and health connection but they are relatively understudied
in this area (e.g. SWB and oxytocin and sex hormones). Finally, interesting
hypotheses about cannabinoid receptors and endorphins may be relevant to posi-
tive emotions, but it is too early to determine how they might help explain the
SWB and health association other than their connection to pain.

 SWB and Telomeres
Telomeres are protective endcaps on DNA and they protect it from damage dur-
ing replication. They become shorter as people age and telomerase helps rebuild
telomeres. The two are important in maintaining cellular health and fidelity in
terms of cell replication. While the degradation of telomeres is associated with
cell senescence, lack of telomerase has been associated with conditions such as
diabetes mellitis and poor insulin production. Stressful conditions have been
found to be related to shorter telomeres in both children and adults (Drury et al.,
2014; Epel et al., 2004). Children living in difficult, stressful conditions have
been found to have shorter telomere length (Mitchell et al., 2014). Conversely,
Jacobs et al. (2011) found that meditation was associated with greater telomerase
in immune cells, and this was mediated by the effects of the practice on increasing
feelings of control and decreasing neuroticism. The authors suggested that activi-
ties that raise people’s sense of well-being can have substantial effects on funda-
mental physiological processes. Although it is early in the history of research in
this area and there are few studies, the findings are promising in offering a direct
tie from psychological well-being to aging and health at the cellular level.
SWB and Wound Healing
Wound healing is interesting because it involves a number of different systems
working together in an intricate pattern. Although it is often included with
immune functioning because this is such a core part of healing, other processes
are also involved. In order for wounds to heal, usually vasoconstriction and
inflammation are involved, but also revascularisation must occur, collagen sup-
port and tissue growth must take place, and all these must occur in a specific
order over time. One study found that the process of skin-barrier recovery was
faster for individuals who had greater positive affect (Robles, Brooks, & Press-
man, 2009). It has also been found that surgical patients heal more quickly if
they are high in life satisfaction (Kopp et al., 2003). Kiecolt-Glaser, Marucha,
Marlarkey, Mercado, and Glaser (1995) found that women caring for a patient
with Alzheimer’s Disease healed more slowly from a standardised wound com-
pared to matched controls. Rats raised in an enriched versus isolated environ-
ment show faster wound healing (Vitalo et. al, 2009).
In individuals recovering from surgery, those who receive psychological inter-
ventions such as guided imagery, breathing exercises, or stress management
training were found to heal more quickly (Broadbent et al., 2012). Married cou-
ples in an experimental paradigm healed more slowly when they were in the con-
flict condition than in a supportive interchange condition (Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
2005). Dental students who were given a standardised wound healed more
quickly during the summer compared to while undergoing the stress of final
examinations (Marucha, Kiecolt-Glaser, & Favagehi, 1998).

 Health Behavior Mediators
People high in SWB often perform healthier behaviors, and this mediational path-
way may be a major cause of their greater health and longevity. In Table 7 we pre-
sent examples of studies on SWB and healthy behaviors. The table shows that
SWB has been found to be associated with health behaviors in many studies.
Although a few experimental studies have examined changes in SWB and the
changes in health behaviors that might ensue, more research of this type is needed.
In sum, there appear to be a number of mediational pathways through which
SWB affects health: cardiovascular, immune, wound healing, telomeres, endo-
crine response, and health behaviors. In light of the number of physiological pro-
cesses influenced by moods and SWB, it would be surprising if there were not
health outcomes deriving from SWB.
MODERATORS
When does SWB influence health and longevity, and when does it not? Across
studies SWB and health and longevity are often, but not always, related. For
instance, DuBois et al. (2015) reported that in 65 per cent of the studies they
reviewed a significant association was found after adjusting for one or more
covariates. Thus, in about one-third of the studies a significant association was
not found, and this raises the issue of moderation. In some cases the nonsignifi-
cant association could be due to lack of statistical power and other methodologi-
cal considerations. However, in others it might be that no association existed.
Thus, it is important to identify the conditions that must be in place to allow the
SWB and health connection to exist so we can gain a better understanding of the
factors that circumscribe when a causal association is actually found. These fac-
tors are referred to as moderators.
It is likely that the relationship going from SWB to health and longevity varies
across various groups and conditions. For instance the relationship between
SWB and healthy behaviors could be attenuated in subcultures that strongly pro-
scribe unhealthy behaviors such as smoking because virtually all people, regard-
less of their SWB, conform to the healthy normative behavior. There are also
potential cultural differences in the SWB and health connection, for example,
due to what emotions are considered normal or are valued (Curhan et al., 2014;
Miyamoto et al., 2013). For instance, in East Asian cultures calm positive emo-
tions are preferred over aroused ones, whereas the opposite is true in individual-
istic nations such as the USA. Thus, it might be that calm emotions are more
helpful to health than aroused ones in East Asian societies. Similarly, because
pride is desirable in some cultures and proscribed in others, it might have very
different associations with health. Kitayama, Park, Morozink Boylan, Miyamoto,
and Levine (2015) found opposite associations between anger expression and
cardiovascular, immune, and cholesterol indicators in the USA and Japan. The

 authors hypothesised that anger expression is linked to higher status in Japan,
and that this could be why it is associated with beneficial physiological patterns
in that culture. The area of culture differences in the SWB and health association
is wide open for needed research.
Moderation by the Population Sampled and
Geographical Region
Age, sex, and other characteristics of the population have served as moderators
of the connection between SWB and health outcomes. Examples of studies find-
ing moderation effects are presented in Table 8. As of yet, compelling explana-
tions of the sex and age differences in the findings have not been offered.
Studies of ethnic differences in the SWB and health association are so rare that
we do not hazard a guess as to their causes.
Moderation by the Type of SWB
Another moderator that seems to influence when SWB will affect health is the
type of SWB involved, for example optimism versus life satisfaction versus neg-
ative affect. Examples of studies analyzing moderators of this type are shown in
Table 9. It can be seen, for example, that in some instances positive or negative
affect are associated with health outcomes independently of SWB of the other
valence. One challenge in separating the effects of various types of SWB is that
they are often substantially correlated. Thus, untangling their influences statisti-
cally requires very large samples, and unfortunately many existing studies are
underpowered to reliably disentangle the correlated moderators. Although there
are data to suggest that positive and negative affect can exert separable influ-
ences, with positive affect sometimes exerting beneficial effects and at other
times negative affect exerting detrimental effects. We do not yet understand the
conditions where each might exert the strongest effects, and why. In addition, it
is uncertain whether the means and distributions of the types of SWB are respon-
sible for the effects that are found. The samples could vary more substantially on
one type of SWB than on another, for example, but researchers have not exam-
ined this possible explanation. Furthermore, for variables such as life satisfac-
tion, optimism, and enjoyment of life we have virtually no knowledge of the
separable versus overlapping effects. There is some indication that highly
aroused positive affect might be harmful to health compared to less aroused and
intense forms of positive affect.
Moderation by the Specific Health Outcomes
Different health outcomes might be differentially affected by SWB. For example,
depression likely influences deaths by suicide, but it seems less likely that it
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH
147

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 would affect deaths by certain genetic diseases. Similarly, positive affect might
benefit the immune system and thus help ward off some infectious diseases such
as influenza, but not counter the effects of others.
In terms of moderation by type of illness, Wikman, Wardle, and Steptoe
(2011) found that strokes were associated with substantially lower SWB,
whereas diabetes and cancer were least associated with low SWB. Howell et al.
(2007), in a meta-analysis of 150 experimental, ambulatory, and longitudinal
studies, found that affect appeared to influence pain levels, disease progression,
longevity, and immune strength, but not cardiovascular health or endocrine sys-
tem responses. For health status, well-being had a greater impact for both short-
and long-term outcomes in healthy samples. However, well-being more strongly
influenced unhealthy samples in countering disease and increasing survival.
Hoen, Denollet, de Jong, and Whooley (2013) found that positive affect pre-
dicted lower levels of all-cause mortality in patients with coronary artery disease,
but not cardiovascular events. Similarly, Shirom, Toker, Jacobson, and Balicer
(2010) found that in a sample followed for 20 years (mean age initially was 41.7
years) feelings of vigor predicted lower mortality and diabetes, but not ischemic
heart disease. Kroenke Seeman, Matthews, Adler, and Epel (2012) found that
positive affect predicted prevalent coronary artery calcification 15 years later,
but not to progressive calcification at 20 years follow-up. Because health out-
comes cover such a wide range of states—from overcoming cancer to catching a
cold—we need to more carefully analyze the type and intensity of illnesses that
are likely to be influenced by SWB, and why.
Moderation by the Study Characteristics
Some meta-analytic reviews point to different outcomes in studies that differ in
the research methods used. For example, Howell et al. (2007) found that ambu-
latory studies in which subjects were followed across days produced the least
strong findings, and experimental designs the strongest effects. They suggested
that in the ambulatory short-term studies across days that other factors such as
life events might swamp the effects that can be seen in long-term patterns,
whereas in experimental studies a greater number of extraneous factors may be
controlled.
Measurement is another methodological factor that can influence whether an
association is found between SWB and health. For instance, Steptoe, Gibson,
Hamer, and Wardle (2007) found that positive affect measured by experience-
sampling was related to several physiological indicators of healthy functioning,
but a global measure of positive affect was less often related to these same
parameters.
In summary, moderators thus far have been somewhat inconsistent across
studies and health outcomes, and there have been few systematic attempts at
strong conceptual understanding of the moderators. For instance for age and for

 sex we do not have a clear picture of the when and why they influence the asso-
ciation of psychological well-being and health, and this is also true of the other
moderators as well. We need more systematic analyses of different outcomes
resulting from different measures, methods, and distributions and mean levels of
the types of SWB before firm conclusions can be reached about possible moder-
ators in this realm.
SWB AND HEALTH EMBEDDED IN A COMPLEX DYNAMIC
SYSTEM
Behavior exists in complex systems where each outcome is influenced by a num-
ber of other variables, and in turn influences other variables. Furthermore, at
times a variable is both influenced and influences another variable. A full under-
standing of an association such as that between SWB and health must include a
consideration of bidirectional influences, reverse causation, and both distal and
proximal influences.
Multiple Causation
It is evident that health and longevity are influenced by many factors, both
genetic, behavioral, and physiological. These factors may be more distal or more
proximal from health outcomes. For example, income is a more distal influence
on health that can have an influence through more proximal influences such as
SWB, the quality of medical care, nutrition, and perhaps feelings of respect and
status. Social relationship variables such as social support versus loneliness can
influence health through social effects on health behavior, as well as possibly on
more direct effects on physiological indicators relevant to health.
A challenging issue is that many of the more distal factors such as income can
influence both SWB and health. Part of the challenge comes in that if these vari-
ables are controlled as possible confounding variables, this might statistically
over-control because it removes portions of SWB that are relevant to health (dis-
cussed further below).
Another issue with variables such as income and social support is that SWB
not only is influenced by them, but also is known to influence them. A number
of studies show that people high in SWB later earn higher incomes and have bet-
ter marriages, for example, and these associations have been replicated a number
of times. Thus, the danger with the automatic statistical control of these variables
is that this can control away significant and influential portions of SWB.
For behavioral phenomena we can always locate distal influences, those
occurring in the past or at a distance, and proximal indicators that are closer to
the outcome in space and/or time. The distal–proximal distinction is important in
the SWB and health domain because some of the variables that are often con-
trolled as possible confounds in correlational and longitudinal results could be
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 causes of SWB (and it mediates their effects on health), outcomes of SWB (and
they mediate its effects on health), or they might directly influence health.
Income is a prime example of a variable that can both foster SWB, and in part
result from it. Thus, simply controlling income as a confounding nuisance vari-
able, although informative, can be dangerous if not carefully considered within a
distal–proximal conceptual analysis. In analyzing statistical corrections there is a
danger of controlling away valid SWB effects.
Reverse Causation: Health Influencing SWB
Because health can influence SWB, a challenge arises in the difficulty of separat-
ing effects in each direction. When we examine longitudinal studies we find evi-
dence for an association between worsening health and declining SWB. For
example, Hubbard Goodwin, Llewellyn, Warmoth, and Lang (2014) found a
strong negative correlation between frailty and SWB in an elderly sample. Bin-
der and Coad (2013) studied over 100,000 individuals in the British Household
Panel Survey, and used propensity-matching to create “treatment” and “control”
groups. In this study, decreases in health such as stroke and cancer predicted
lower SWB.
Acute infection can trigger major depression (Gunaratne, Lloyd, & Vollmer-
Conna, 2013). A small amount of experimental work also suggests health effects
on SWB. Janicki-Deverts, Cohen, Doyle, Turner, and Treanor (2007) infected vol-
unteer participants with a virus and quarantined them. Daily production of proin-
flammatory cytokines was related to lower positive affect the next day, but was not
related to negative affect. In another study, those receiving a typhoid injection
were lower in mood several hours afterward, compared to the control condition
(Strike, Wardle, & Steptoe, 2004; Wright, Strike, Brydon, & Steptoe, 2005).
Several characteristics of an illness may increase the impact of health on
SWB, for example whether it interferes with activities of daily living. Mukuria
and Brazier (2013) found that ability for self-care, ability to carry out usual daily
activities, and pain were all aspects of health that are related to reports of happi-
ness. Graham, Higuera Jaramillo, and Lora (2011) found that both interference
with daily activities and pain were associated with lower SWB. However, the
researchers also found effects that suggest that expectancies moderate the effects
of health on SWB. For example, they found that difficulties with daily activities
had less impact on older respondents. Income lessened the impact of pain on life
satisfaction, but made difficulties with self-care more impactful. The authors sug-
gest that the latter finding is due to the fact that wealthier people have higher
expectations in general. Finally, they found that mobility problems had a larger
negative effect on men than on women.
The impact of ill-health on SWB is not a linear function of the objective ill-
ness, but seems to be heavily influenced by overcoming disability to stay
involved with other people and activities. It is important to note, however, that it
150

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 is possible that the individual’s level of SWB is one key determinant of whether
they stay involved with others and continue to work and function well. The path
from health to SWB is frequent enough that it must also be considered and ana-
lyzed when studying directionality between SWB and health.
Third-Variable Explanations (Confounding Variables)
Apparent causal influences might be due to some third confounding variable. In
the case of SWB and health, there are several culprits that deserve examination.
Sociodemographic factors, genetic predispositions, early nutrition (including pre-
natal nutrition), social relationships, and other factors must all be considered if
we are to uncover the true nature of the SWB and health connection.
One type of third variable that is sometimes overlooked is that of the measures
containing artifacts that might contaminate them and lead to misleading conclu-
sions. For instance, when SWB is assessed by self-report surveys and health is
also assessed by subjective ratings of health, there is an obvious problem of con-
tamination of both measures by factors such as social desirability, positivity, and
response biases such as number use, leading to a spurious association between
the two. Even more problematical, sometimes self-report measures of health
include items such as vigor and energy that are also included in measures of
SWB. For this reason it is important to examine experiments in which SWB or
moods are induced, which do not then rely on participants’ reports of their
moods, and to also examine objective tests of health such as biological and
health markers. Objective assessments of health behaviors such as activity track-
ing and prescription compliance also are very desirable. In the measurement of
SWB we can examine nonself-report measures such as SWB reports on the tar-
get
participant
obtained
from
knowledgeable
informants,
cognitive
and
response-time measures, experience-sampling, and daily reconstruction measures
(DRM) of moods. More diverse methods for assessing SWB would obviate some
concerns about measurement confounds leading to spurious conclusions.
One approach to ruling out the influence of third variables is through statistical
controls or similar strategies such as participant-matching. An example of statis-
tical controls, and the issues they present, is the study by Liu et al. (2016) on the
Million Women sample in the United Kingdom. The investigators followed a
large sample of women for 10 years after they had responded to a single-item
3-point happiness scale and observed mortality. The initial happiness measure
did predict longevity, but did not withstand the control variables that were then
employed—statistical controls for self-reported health, treatment for anxiety,
arthritis, asthma, depression, diabetes, or hypertension, and several sociodemo-
graphic and lifestyle factors (such as smoking, deprivation, and body-mass
index). One issue of such controls, as discussed below, is that they controlled the
effects that SWB had exerted to that point in time, at about age 50, and thus dis-
carded these effects. Another issue is that factors such as smoking and
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 hypertension can be influenced by SWB, and thus controlling these variables can
lead to an underestimation of the effects of SWB on health. One more issue is in
controlling subjective health, the reports of which are likely to be influenced by
a respondent’s happiness and positivity, the investigators controlled away valid
portions of SWB. Segerstrom (2014) found that both negative and positive affect
could in some instances influence reports of self-rated health beyond the effects
of objective indicators of health. Furthermore, it is remarkable that the findings
were as robust as they were, in light of the fact that the measure of SWB used
was not ideal. These issues with statistical controls are discussed below.
The Challenges of Statistical Control
The association between SWB and health might be because health influences
SWB or because third variables such as income influence both of them. In order
to determine whether SWB actually influences health, researchers often turn to
statistical controls in which the possible confound is eliminated statistically and
the resulting association examined. For instance, to rule out the possibility that
SWB is associated with longevity only because it is influenced by the person’s
health at the initial testing, health status at that time is controlled in the associa-
tion between initial SWB and longevity after that. However, there are a number
of serious issues when statistical controls are employed, and these often go
unrecognised. For instance, statistical controls can substantially alter the nature
of the questions being asked. Below we describe issues with statistical controls.
The first was discussed by Kahneman (1965) and the next two were discussed
by Meehl (1970). The final issue comes from our observations of research on
well-being and health. Readers are referred to those original sources, as well as
to Westfall and Yarkami (2016) and Rohrer (2017).
Undercontrol Because of Error of Measurement.
When statistically con-
trolling variables usually we do not control away the full amount of variance that
is due to those variables because they are measured with error. Thus, in control-
ling for Time 1 health, for example, our control will be incomplete to the extent
that our measure of health contains measurement error. Our measure of SWB is
also likely to be affected by measurement error. For example, if a relatively weak
measure of positive emotions is used, the underlying true associations might be
seriously underestimated. Corrections for the attenuated reliability of measures
are rarely conducted in this literature. This means that we do not fully capture
the effects of SWB, or of the potential confounding variables either, when simple
statistical controls are introduced in the analyses. Because most studies rely on
brief self-report measures of SWB, often collected at only one point in time,
underestimation is usually a distinct possibility. A measure of SWB taken at a
single point in time will only partially capture the long-term effects of SWB on
health because SWB does not remain completely stable over time.
152
DIENER ET AL.

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 Failure to correct measurement error in some cases can even produce illusory
positive findings. If a predictor is measured without error, such as the treatment
condition, and is not related to the outcome variable, it might appear to be asso-
ciated when potential confounds are statistically controlled if they are not cor-
rected for measurement error. Thus, not controlling for measurement error can
lead to both over- and under-estimation of effects in some instances.
Systematic Unmatching and Unrepresentative Subpopulations.
Statistical
control is similar to matching of subjects because we match people statistically
to compare people who are similar on the control variables and yet differ on the
independent variable. For example, in controlling Time 1 health, we seek to
identify people who are similar in health but different in SWB when we predict
longevity. The problem is that SWB must be caused, and when one of those
causes, for example health, is omitted from the system, other factors influencing
SWB must then differ. It is likely that some factor such as temperament must
then differ to make some people just as happy when they are ill as others are
when they are not ill. Meehl (1970) explains how statistical controls match sub-
jects on the variables in question, but then unmatch them in an unintended way
on other variables. He also explains how statistical controls are likely to make
the sample less representative than it was before controls were introduced, by
weighting certain unusual individuals more than the more typical ones.
Causal Arrow Ambiguity.
A serious issue is that when we control for a
possible confounding variable, it might over-control because it is itself a cause
or an effect of the independent variable, and therefore controlling it removes
some amount of the effect of the predictor. For example, controlling for health at
Time 1 because it is a possible confound overlooks the fact that it might at that
time also result from SWB. Therefore, when it is controlled it removes valid pre-
dictive power from SWB.
In order to separate the direct effects of SWB on health, as well as estimate
the mediated indirect paths, one should use longitudinal measures with path anal-
ysis in a cross-lagged design. This procedure is needed both to examine the
effects of SWB on outcomes, but also to assess third variables that might con-
found the results, or that might arise from SWB or lead to it. Only by using more
sophisticated research designs can researchers hope to accurately estimate the
various biases and influences.
It happens very frequently that investigators in this area control socioeco-
nomic variables such as income and education, without realising that factors
such as income can be themselves influenced by SWB. There are now studies
showing that people high in early SWB are likely to later earn higher incomes,
for instance, even when controlling factors such as parental income. Thus, in
controlling income the researchers are possibly throwing out valid portions of
SWB that might be influencing health.
PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH
153

 In behavioral research a number of third-variable patterns are recognised and
discussed, including third variables as suppressors, mediators, causes, and out-
comes. In the case where third variables cause both the independent and depen-
dent variable they may be confounds when trying to estimate the causal effects
of the independent on the dependent variable. However, there is a danger of
over-control in which actual effects are deleted. For third variables that may
cause both SWB and health, it is informative to examine both their direct effect
on health, but also their indirect effects through SWB. It is important to note that
when third variables are mediators or outcomes it can often lead to misleading
results when they are controlled. What is important is that a conceptual analysis
of the system be consistent with the way the controls are employed. A strength
of causal modeling, described below, is that the potential confounds can be intro-
duced into the analyses in terms of different possible relationships, and the
results determined. In this way one can be more certain that the researcher is not
spuriously controlling away true relationships. Furthermore, causal analysis
demands that researchers carefully consider the pathways that may exist between
the variables they measure.
Studying Change in the Rate of Effects, Not Effects Per Se.
Scientists
must consider the time course of disease progression. For instance, if a sample
begins at age 60 and beyond, substantial cardiovascular damage is likely to
already have occurred in many participants. Thus, if researchers control for Time
1 health they may inadvertently over-control in the sense that they eliminate pos-
sible detrimental effects of low SWB that might have occurred over many dec-
ades, and might also control away future damaging effects of low SWB because
these will be highly related to the rate of damage that has already occurred.
When we control Time 1 health we jettison potential earlier effects of SWB on
health from our analysis. Not only that, but we diminish the likelihood of uncov-
ering further effects of SWB that continue at the same rate as before. By control-
ling Time 1 health we essentially now examine whether the rate of SWB’s
influence on health is changing after that point in time, not whether the level of
SWB is influencing health. In controlling Time 1 health we thereafter will only
uncover effects when they occur at a greater rate than previously. We have
altered the question the statistics answer from whether SWB can influence
health, to whether it does so at a different rate than it did previously. The fact
that so many studies have shown positive results even after controlling Time 1
health might mean that the effects of SWB on health do increase with age.
The current standard practice of control might be more informative for dis-
eases that occur quickly without prior conditions that point to them. In this case,
controlling health at Time 1 may make sense. In this case the course of illness is
abrupt and discontinuous, and therefore controlling for T1 health does not throw
out all the earlier influences of SWB. However, for many diseases there is a pro-
gression of the condition over many years, even decades. The condition might

 only become fully evident and full-blown at some point in time, but the physio-
logical conditions underlying it might have progressed throughout adulthood and
to some degree be captured by Time 1 measures of health. In this case control-
ling for T1 health truly can lead to misleading results.
A further complication is that when one examines the predictive power of
SWB at Time 1 on later longevity, it must be recognised that not only are the
Time 1 measures a snapshot at that time that does not capture SWB during all
the prior years, and which could have affected health during those years, but also
that SWB might change after Time 1. Fujita and Diener (2005) found that a sig-
nificant number of individuals change substantially in well-being over a period
of years. Thus, Time 1 SWB might not fully predict longevity in part because it
rose or declined over time, and also a measure at one point in time does not fully
capture the long-term effects. Thus, highly reliable measures and ones that occur
over time will be needed to fully capture SWB’s effects on health. When med-
iocre measures of SWB are employed at one point in time, they cannot be
expected to fully assess the influences that might be occurring.
CONTROLLING POTENTIAL CONFOUNDS
Concerns about statistical over-control in behavioral research have been
expressed by others (e.g. Spector, Zapf, Chen, & Frese, 2000) because of the
possibility of throwing out phenomena by inadvertently erasing their effects.
However, in the fields both of SWB and health these concerns have not received
widespread attention. Researchers must fully understand the conceptual and sta-
tistical implications of the controls they use. It is not that controls should never
be employed, but they must be implemented cautiously, and their limitations
fully appreciated. In light of the strong effects statistical controls can exert, and
their ability to over-control away true associations, it is remarkable how fre-
quently significant effects have nonetheless been uncovered.
Caution alone is not enough to wisely use statistical controls. For instance, we
can employ methods when we control variables that take measurement error into
account. We can be certain that we know the variables employed are in fact
likely to be confounds. For instance, if we control various types of maladies at
Time 1 because they might be confounds by influencing SWB, we should know
that in fact these conditions do influence people’s well-being. Without such
knowledge the risk of over-control easily outweighs the risk of confounding. For
example, in the Liu et al. (2016) study described earlier, the investigators should
have determined whether hypertension and diabetes affect SWB before control-
ling them as possible confounds. Similarly, researchers should understand how
objective health differs from subjective reports of health, so they know how
much potential variance in SWB might be erased by controlling the subjective
reports versus simply controlling objective health measures.

 Statistical controls represent a theoretical statement about the structure of the
dynamic system, and are not simply a way of removing confounding variables.
It may be that in fact using statistical controls does not distort findings in particu-
lar cases, and does help control confounding variables. However, this happy cir-
cumstance cannot be assumed without understanding and carefully analyzing
each of the associations between all of the variables used in the analyses.
We suggest that statistical controls can be more problematic and challenging
than most researchers have realised. They do not magically solve the problem of
confounding variables. What is a researcher to do in this case, when confounding
variables obviously often may represent a problem? First, statistical controls
should be presented and interpreted carefully. Not only should the simple zero-
order correlations among all variables be presented in all research reports, but
controls should be entered in a way that allows examination of each of their sep-
arate influences. In this way, readers can gain a clearer picture of the associations
involved. When only final regression analyses are reported, it is impossible for
readers to fully understand the associations between the variables.
Third, investigators can employ alternative strategies and methods that take
potential confounds into account and possibly control them, but in meaningful
ways. For example, one can obtain reports of SWB at an early age, and then not
examine mortality until many years later. This greatly reduces the risk that Time
1 health was a confound because it had been influencing SWB. If the sample is
not tracked until some duration after the Time 1 SWB measures were obtained,
it is less likely that health had much effect on SWB at that time. For instance, in
the well-known nun study by Danner, Snowdon, and Friesen (2001), the autobi-
ographies on which the SWB scores were estimated were collected around age
22, and the nuns’ mortality was not tracked until after they reached 75. Thus, it
is unlikely that health had much effect on the early assessment of SWB because
the nuns in the study all lived for 50 or more years beyond that time before the
tracking began. Similarly, Steptoe (2016) assessed enjoyment of life, but did not
begin tracking mortality in the sample until two years beyond when the initial
measures of SWB were collected. In the ensuing eight years he found one-third
the mortality in the highest compared to lowest enjoyment of life group. In this
way Steptoe lowered the likelihood that Time 1 health was not exerting a pro-
found effect on SWB at Time 1 because his sample did not include those who
died in close proximity to the measure of well-being.
Another way of controlling possible confounding variables is to examine data
that are experimental or quasi-experimental in nature. For example, one can
examine whether physiological and health measures are influenced by experi-
ments designed to raise people’s SWB. One can examine whether stressful
events that cannot be attributed to the subjects’ individual characteristics, such as
war or an earthquake, affect people’s SWB and in turn their health. People
whose SWB is raised by a random event such as winning the lottery could be
examined in terms of their health thereafter.

 Researchers have also controlled for certain confounding variables by study-
ing twins, and employing statistical controls. Genetic studies that utilise the iden-
tical chromosomal make-up of twins can help rule out genes as the sole cause of
the health and SWB relationship. Sadler, Miller, Christensen, and McGue
(2011), for example, found that SWB was related to increased longevity in iden-
tical twins. Because SWB predicted longevity even between identical twins, the
results indicated that the relation between SWB and longevity cannot be entirely
due to either genes or shared family environment. Animal research is another
way to overcome the potential confounds that often occur in studies on humans.
CAUSAL SYSTEM MODELING
An additional method for exploring complex systems is causal modeling, which
is a statistical approach in which the empirical data are fit to a model of intercon-
nected variables, and the goodness of fit can be judged. Improvements to the fit
of the model can be calculated when paths of direct and indirect influence are
added or eliminated. Alternative plausible causal models can be tested against
one another. When data are longitudinal, causal direction can be explored by
comparing the fit of models that move in either direction over time. In this way,
factors such as income that might be potential confounds, but also might result
in part from SWB, can be included and yet not simply controlled away in a fash-
ion likely to spuriously introduce errors of inference. One feature of causal mod-
eling is that it can employ multiple measures of variables and analyze the data
using Structural Equation Modeling, in which case the effects of measurement
error can be assessed and obviated.
To adequately conduct strong causal modeling a conceptual framework is
needed that posits relationships between each of key variables that can influence
and be influenced by SWB and health, as well as potential confounding vari-
ables. Both direct and indirect pathways by which SWB can influence health
must be specified. Although it is never possible to assess all the potential con-
founding variables, the major ones need to be identified. For an introduction to
causal modeling, readers are referred to sources such as Imbens and Rubin
(2015) and Mayer, Thoemmes, Rose, Steyer, & West (2014).
An important ingredient for strong causal modeling is that the important vari-
ables in the model are assessed repeatedly over time. For example, to determine
the causal direction between SWB, health behaviors, and health outcomes, at a
minimum the researcher should have a measure of SWB at T1, a measure of
health behavior somewhat later, and a measure of health at T3 following that.
Furthermore, if each of the variables is assessed repeatedly at each of the time
points, it allows not only predictions from the levels of each variable, but also
from their change over time. Ideally of course this will include multiple points in
time, not just three.

 We know of no studies that have examined full causal models in which the
pathways going from SWB to the mediators and to health outcomes, as well as
possible confounds (that might also cause or be influenced by SWB), have been
tested simultaneously in the same specified model. Furthermore, we know of no
studies that simultaneously measure factors beyond SWB, such as social support,
that are thought to influence health but also influence and can be influenced by
SWB, so that the direct and indirect effects of them in combination with SWB
can be assessed. For example, does social support influence health because it
raises well-being and lowers stress, or does SWB influence health because it
makes people more sociable?
Causal parsing also has not been conducted with a broad set of SWB variables
simultaneously, including optimism, life satisfaction, stress, and enjoyment of
life, for example, with large samples to determine the common and unique
effects of these well-being variables on health. Although positive and negative
affect have been shown to have unique associations with health, an assortment
of types of SWB have not been carefully separated using sufficiently large sam-
ples. To strongly determine the separate effects of various forms of SWB, analy-
ses are required that include corrections for measurement error. Causal modeling
with longitudinal data, as well as experimentation in which the causal factors are
each varied, are needed to help understand the full causal system going from
psychological and social variables to health.
NEEDED RESEARCH
We began the review by asking whether SWB influences health and longevity.
In light of the review we can now give greater focus to this question. We now
know with some degree of confidence that SWB can influence health-relevant
biological indicators, health, and longevity, at least in some instances. We have
strong leads on several explanations of how SWB affects health. We also know
that SWB is neither a necessary nor a sufficient cause of health because other
factors clearly influence health, and even in the absence of high SWB some indi-
viduals are healthy. A major unanswered question now is when SWB does and
does not influence health. Much more research is needed, but certain areas seem
to be particularly understudied.
1. We need much more moderator research in which the factors that alter the
relationships between SWB and health are studied. As it now stands we have
inconsistent findings, for example that SWB is related to a health outcome for
one sex, but not for the other. Furthermore, these moderators sometimes reverse
from one study to the next. We have little understanding of these findings, and
many other potential moderators remain unstudied. This area demands much
more in-depth study and theoretical development.
2. Research is needed that examines the common and unique influences of the
various forms of high and low SWB, for example, life satisfaction, positive
158

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 affect, optimism, and stress. Many but not all researchers now recognise the
importance of assessing not just negative emotions such as stress and depression,
but positive emotions as well. A few studies include life satisfaction, optimism,
and other related variables as predictors as well. Because these measures are
inexpensive and quick to include, they should be employed more frequently. We
know that positive and negative emotions appear to have separable effects, but
we know little about the differential effects of other types of SWB. However,
because these variables tend to correlate, sometimes substantially, very large
samples are needed to reliably pinpoint their unique effects.
Research is also needed on the measures being employed. Different measures
may tap different aspects of the underlying concept, and therefore produce
results that could differ from other measures of supposedly the same variable.
For instance, the widely used PANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) scale
of positive and negative affect focuses on the experience of highly activated and
intense emotions (e.g. excited and enthusiastic). Other scales often assess less
aroused forms of positive emotion such as happiness or contentment (Diener
et al., 2010). It is possible that positive emotions are generally beneficial to
health, but highly aroused ones may be detrimental (e.g. Pressman & Cohen,
2005). Therefore, measures of positive affect should not be assumed to be identi-
cal. Positive feelings have been assessed by cheerfulness and sense of humor,
and by the enjoyment of life and other measures as well. There may be overlap-
ping influence between many of these concepts but we cannot be certain until
this is tested. It could also be that some of these measures capture more activated
and aroused feelings, whereas others capture calm and contented feelings, and
the two might have distinctly different effects on health. Furthermore, one-time
global self-reports of SWB might differ from well-being captured by experience
sampling measures or informant reports of SWB.
The level of SWB that most benefits health deserves more extensive study.
Are there threshold effects, above which SWB no longer benefits health? Are
there levels of SWB such as highly aroused positive affect that can harm health,
and how might they do so?
3. The time course of various health outcomes is also important to consider in
terms of the influences of SWB. Some outcomes might slowly accumulate over
many years, such as the build-up of arterial plaque. Other outcomes, such as
stress-induced tachycardia, might be immediate, and yet depend to some degree
on earlier unhealthy developments over decades. Similarly, some causes of
health or illness occur over long periods of time, for example the effects of
health behaviors such as using sunscreen and healthy nutrition. Other outcomes
may depend on immediate mood, yet in combination with physiological patterns
in the person that have been laid down over a long period of time. Sorting out
these differences both theoretically and empirically should be a goal of future
research, requiring that measures be administered repeatedly over time.

 4. More experimental research is needed on interventions in which long-term
positive psychological states are raised and the effects on health assessed, includ-
ing in populations who are not suffering from ill-being. The long-term experi-
ments are particularly valuable in establishing the causal impact of SWB on
health. Even in the realm of treatments to reverse states of ill-being such as
depression and anxiety much research is needed. Studies in which well-being is
raised in normal populations will help shed light on optimal levels of well-being.
5. Third variables such as prenatal effects and childhood environmental effects
need to be examined in terms of whether they are, at least in part, responsible for
the SWB and health associations that have been found. Could it be that the early
environment, including factors such as prenatal nutrition and stressful early fam-
ily conditions, can influence both later SWB and health through the adult lifes-
pan? If so, how much do these effects explain the SWB and health connection?
Although some variables such as SES have been studied frequently and con-
trolled, other possible explanatory third variables remain understudied.
6. Much more research is needed to parse the interacting effects of variables
such as income and social relationship quality, which can be influenced by SWB
but also influence SWB. Exploring these variables together with SWB is needed
to understand whether they directly influence health, or do so by influencing
SWB, which in this case is the mediator. There are a large number of variables
that can influence health, but which co-occur with SWB. Sleep is a prime exam-
ple. It can influence health and SWB, but SWB can also influence it. Thus,
sophisticated designs are needed to disentangle its effects separately from the
effects of SWB, and this is true of other variables such as income.
7. More nonhuman animal research will be informative, especially on the
effects of well-being on health. A number of studies on animals have examined
the influence of stress on health, but few have examined whether felicitous cir-
cumstances that would be thought to induce positive feelings influence animal
health. One reason that animal research adds to experiments and other research
with humans is that conditions can be more fully controlled with animals, and
certain third-variable explanations ruled out. In addition, the interactions of
genetics and SWB can be studied. Fortunately, there has recently been increased
interest in assessing the emotions of animals, and these methods may prove use-
ful in the SWB and health domain.
8. In terms of assessing SWB, it would be desirable to move beyond one-time
self-report survey measures in assessing SWB. Not only would it provide more
reliable measures if SWB were to be assessed at several points in time, but it
would also be potentially helpful to add other types of measures beyond simple
self-report surveys. Neuroimaging methods, experience-sampling, as well as
approaches such as informant estimates of the SWB of the target respondent,
memory and reaction-time cognitive measures, facial and nonverbal expression
measures, and assessments of emotional expressivity skills would be helpful to
add to our research armamentarium. The advantage of multiple assessment
160

Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied Psychology.
 methods for measuring SWB is based on the premise that none of them are per-
fect, and each contains some error of measurement. Thus, using latent traits of
combined measures could produce more valid measures. Furthermore, concerns
with self-report measures such as their confounding overlap with other measures
can be reduced by including nonself-report measurement methods.
9. More causal modeling of multiple influences on health needs to be con-
ducted, in which direct and indirect pathways from SWB to health are analyzed.
Factors that may influence SWB and/or health should be included in these analy-
ses to more carefully parse their effects. Because of the simpler statistical
approaches that have characterised the field, many existing data sets could be
revisited with more sophisticated analyses.
10. If we can uncover the process by which brain states are related to emo-
tions, and feelings of well-being influence the endocrine, immune, and cardio-
vascular systems, it might be possible to mimic those states physiologically in
people who are not readily responsive to well-being interventions.
11. Cultural differences in the SWB and health connection are wide open for
research. The few studies conducted to date suggest that there may be differences
in the effects of certain emotions on health, depending on cultural context.
APPLIED VERSUS THEORETICAL ISSUES OF THE RESEARCH
The question of when and how SWB affects health is of both theoretical and
applied importance. For healthcare practitioners the evidence now seems suffi-
cient that in some cases they may be concerned about the SWB of their patients.
Naturally, when patients suffer from problems such as depression or anxiety dis-
orders, a referral for proper treatment is advised. However, with certain disease
groups such as cardiovascular disease, interventions to raise the well-being of
clients and reduce their stress now seem justified. Although our evidence base is
not beyond a reasonable doubt, the preponderance of evidence suggests that at
least some individuals would benefit from having higher SWB. Current evidence
also suggests that in routine medical check-ups screening not only for negative
emotional states, but also for low positive ones, might be helpful. Furthermore,
interventions are now being tested that may raise well-being in much less costly
ways than traditional individual psychotherapy. However, the evidence base at
this point is too sparse to strongly recommend that assessments or interventions
for high SWB become routine parts of healthcare practice. Further, there are
complicating factors that must be explored such as the potential detrimental
effects of high-arousal positive affect.
For research scientists, the field is wide open for needed advances with
applied implications. When does SWB influence health, and when will increases
in well-being further benefit health? Are there physiological and behavioral pat-
terns evident in happy individuals that we could raise in a direct way even when
increasing SWB might be difficult or costly?

 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
To the question of whether SWB can influence health, at least in some instances,
we answer in the affirmative with some degree of certainty. To the question of
how this occurs, we now have initial answers, for example, in terms of health
behaviors, and the immune and cardiovascular systems. To the question of when
this occurs and when it does not, and where it is most likely to occur, we as yet
have only scattered initial hypotheses, and this is one of the big directions for
future research. To the question of how large the effects are we have some initial
estimates from scattered studies, for example in terms of extra years of life and
odds-ratios, but to our knowledge no systematic reviews and analyses have been
conducted. How do the effects of high versus low SWB compare, for example,
to the beneficial effects of exercise or not smoking?
We know little yet about whether interventions to directly raise well-being
will improve health and longevity. The results of such studies so far have been
mixed, perhaps in part due to the difficulty of raising long-term SWB in a non-
trivial way. We do not know if there are threshold effects beyond which
increases in SWB do not have benefits. Finally, there are potential third-variable
explanations of the effects, for example prenatal nutrition, that have not yet been
ruled out. Thus, we have some answers to various aspects of SWB causing
health outcomes, but there is much more to learn.
Our review suggests that encouraging progress has been made in our scientific
understanding of the well-being influence on health, but many important and
intriguing research questions remain. The reviews makes clear that we need to
know more than the simple experimental question framed as to whether SWB
has a causal influence on health. We are now moving beyond the initial stages of
research in this area where exciting associations have been uncovered, to more
sophisticated approaches that can identify the full set of conditions when SWB
will affect health and when interventions to increase SWB will improve health.
