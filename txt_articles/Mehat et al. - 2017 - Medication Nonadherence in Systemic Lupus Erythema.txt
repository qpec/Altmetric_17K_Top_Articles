Objective. Medication nonadherence has not been well characterized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our
objective was to a conduct a systematic review of the literature, examining the burden and determinants of medication
nonadherence in SLE.
Methods. We conducted a systematic search of Medline (1946–2015), Embase (1974–2015), and Web of Science (1900–
2015) databases and selected original studies of SLE patients that evaluated nonadherence to SLE therapies as the pri-
mary study outcome. We extracted information on study design, sample size, length of followup, data sources, type of
nonadherence problem examined, adherence measures and reported estimates, and determinants of adherence
reported in multivariable analyses.
Results. After screening 4,111 titles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 32 to 246
patients, and studies were categorized according to data source: self-report (5), electronic monitoring devices (1), clini-
cal records from rheumatology clinics (3), and refill information from pharmacy records (2). Overall, the percentage of
nonadherent patients ranged from 43% to 75%, with studies consistently reporting that over half of patients are nonad-
herent. Studies also showed that up to 33% of patients discontinue therapy after 5 years. Determinants of nonadher-
ence included having depression, rural residence, lower education level, and polypharmacy.
Conclusion. Overall, synthesis of current evidence suggests that the burden of medication nonadherence is substantial
in SLE. Findings highlight the importance of developing interventions to support adherence and improve outcomes
among patients.
INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic sys-
temic autoimmune rheumatic disease that specifically
attacks collagen and results in multifarious clinical mani-
festations, including joint pain, photosensitivity, malar
rash, and clinical nephritis (1,2). It occurs predominantly
in women (approximately 9:1 female to male) during
their childbearing years (3), with reported prevalence of
143.7 per 100,000 and incidence of 23.2 per 100,000 per-
son-years (4). Furthermore, women representing ethnic
minorities are disproportionately affected, including Afri-
can Americans (prevalence 223.4 per 100,000; incidence
31.2 per 100,000 person-years) and Hispanics (prevalence
126.5 per 100,000; incidence 22.2 per 100,000 person-
years) (4). As there is no cure for SLE, the goals of treat-
ment include decreasing autoimmunity to slow down
disease progression and prevent damage to other organ
systems from the downstream effects of SLE (3). The con-
ventional option to achieve these goals among patients
with SLE with minimal organ involvement is the long-
term use of antimalarials, namely hydroxychloroquine
and chloroquine (5,6). It is recommended that SLE
patients with multiple organ systems involved should
additionally be taking other immunosuppressive medica-
tions
(azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate,
chlorambucil, and cyclosporine) (5,6). Advances in SLE
treatments over the last few decades have resulted in
marked decreases in deaths associated with SLE activity
(7), but there seems to be no such decline in deaths asso-
ciated with the sequelae of SLE (7).
Nonadherence to long-term antimalarial or immuno-
suppressive treatment may be an important factor that
could potentially be driving poor long-term outcomes in

 SLE patients due to the downstream effects of the dis-
ease. Medication nonadherence is a complex construct
that encompasses the distinct problems of poor execution
of the dosing regimen (such that scheduled doses are
delayed or omitted), which may lead to transient inter-
ruptions in drug action, and discontinuation of the medi-
cation, which may lead to the intermittent or permanent
loss of drug effects (Figure 1). While a potential contribu-
tor to therapeutic challenges in SLE, medication nonad-
herence
has
not
been
well
described
among
SLE
patients. To date, 1 systematic review in 2009 has sum-
marized medication nonadherence across a variety of
rheumatic diseases, including 4 studies published from
1999 to 2006 that reported adherence rates among SLE
patients (8). The objective of our systematic review is to
update
these
data
and
synthesize
published,
peer-
reviewed evidence on the burden and determinants of
treatment nonadherence among patients with SLE in
real-world settings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature search strategy. We conducted a mapped
search of the following databases: Medline (1946 to
December 2015), Embase (1974 to December 2015), and
Web of Science (1900 to December 2015). We used
database-dependent terms (e.g., medical subject headings
[MeSH] in Medline) for concepts underlying our search,
including SLE (MeSH: lupus erythematosus, systemic)
and medication nonadherence (MeSH: health behavior,
patient compliance, medication adherence) as well as
keyword searches (Table 1). To supplement the database
searches,
we
conducted
a
manual
search
of
the
bibliographies of selected articles.
Study selection. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by
2 independent reviewers (PM and MA) for the inclusion
of
published
studies
that
evaluated
and/or
reported
medication
nonadherence
among
patients
with
SLE
in real-world settings. Specific inclusion criteria were
observational study design, patient sample that included
SLE, indication of the data source and measurement tool
to quantify medication adherence, and publication in
English, French, or Spanish. We excluded randomized
controlled trials, as we were primarily interested in
treatment of patients in clinical or real-world settings,
because medication adherence has been shown to be
higher among patients participating in clinical drug trials
(9). Discrepancies with respect to inclusion or exclusion
of papers were discussed and resolved by consensus.

Significance & Innovations
• Medication nonadherence is substantial in sys-
temic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with studies
consistently reporting that over half of patients
with SLE are nonadherent with treatment.
• Depression was a consistently reported patient
factor associated with lower adherence with SLE
medications and may represent a modifiable tar-
get for adherence interventions.
• SLE patients need to be supported by health care
providers to ensure treatment adherence.

 Data extraction and quality assessment. We extracted
the following information from the included studies: year of
publication, country, study setting, sample size, and data
source used to measure adherence (e.g., patient self-report,
electronic
monitoring
devices,
clinical
records,
and
pharmacy
refill
data).
Of
particular
importance
was
information
on
the
burden
of
medication
adherence,
including
type
of
nonadherence
problem
evaluated
(e.g.,
poor
execution
or
discontinuation),
adherence
measurement tool (e.g., questionnaire), adherence measure
(e.g., proportion of days covered, medication possession ratio
[MPR]), cutoff values to define subjects who were adherent
and nonadherent, and adherence estimates (e.g., mean score,
adherence rate, and percentage of nonadherent patients).
Using the World Health Organization’s Five Dimen-
sions of Adherence as a framework, we also extracted
information on determinants or factors shown to be inde-
pendently associated with adherence in multivariable
analyses, grouping them according to patient factors,
condition factors, therapy factors, social/economic fac-
tors, and health care system factors (10). Information on
determinants of nonadherence based on univariate or
bivariate analyses were not included.
We used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklists for
cohort, cross-sectional, and case–control studies com-
bined to assess how well the observational research was
reported (11). For purposes of our systematic review, we
adapted the checklist to include 22 items (maximum
score 22), which we applied to appraise the quality of
included studies. As with study selection, data extrac-
tion and quality assessment were conducted by 2 inde-
pendent reviewers (PM and MA), with any discrepancies
resolved by discussion and consensus.
RESULTS
Literature search. We identified 4,111 studies with our
search strategy, and after screening for titles and abstracts,
we reviewed the full text of 36 articles (Figure 2). Based
on this review, we included 11 articles and categorized
them according to measurement of adherence as studies
based on self-report (n = 5), electronic monitoring devices
(n = 1), clinical records (n = 3), and pharmacy refill data
(n = 2). Table 2 summarizes details of the included
studies, including country, setting and population, sample
size, number of years of followup, indicator of whether data
on determinants of adherence were reported, and the quality
score. Table 3 summarizes the results of the included studies.
Quality assessment. Quality scores ranged from 14 to
19, with a mode of 16 (in 4 studies), indicating the number
of items of 22 that pertained to reporting observational
research according to STROBE. An important consideration
in
this
systematic
review
was
whether
studies
appropriately
described
and
calculated
adherence
measures as well as reported appropriate statistics (e.g.,
mean/median adherence scores, proportion of adherent
patients). While all of these studies provided descriptions
of adherence measurement tools and adherence measures,
many failed to report appropriate statistics to describe rate
of nonadherence (7 of 11) and proportion of nonadherent
patients (6 of 11). The latter is particularly problematic, as
the lack of appropriate statistics precludes interpretation
of the results. In addition, the majority of these studies
failed to report methods to account for bias (10 of 11), as to
how they arrived at their sample size (6 of 11), and their
funding sources (5 of 11).
Burden of nonadherence.
Studies based on self-report.
Five studies assessed adherence to SLE medications
based on self-reports from patients in various settings.
Mosley-Williams et al (12) queried 122 patients (68 Afri-
can American women and 54 white women) from 2
rheumatology clinics at urban tertiary care medical cen-
ters regarding the frequency of failing to take their SLE
medications on a 5-point scale (where 1 = never, 2 =
rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, and 5 = all the time)
during the previous year (12). The difference between
the average medication adherence self-report scores of
African American women was mean � SD 2.3 � 1.2 and
for white women 2.5 � 1.3 (12). This difference was not
statistically significant.
Garcia-Gonzales
et al
(13)
evaluated
self-reported
adherence and the determinants of nonadherence among
32 SLE patients from outpatient rheumatology clinics in
Houston, Texas. As part of this evaluation, patients were
asked
to
complete
the
Compliance
Questionnaire
Rheumatology, a self-reported measure of medication
adherence, with 19 items specifically developed for
patients with rheumatic diseases, which was validated
through electronic monitoring (range 0–100, where 0 =

Mehat et al
 complete nonadherence and 100 = perfect adherence)
(13). Overall, the mean � SD questionnaire score for
patients was 68.0 � 8.3 (13). Also, self-reported adher-
ence was assessed by asking patients how often they for-
get their medications, how often they discontinued their
medications on their own because of the side effects, and
how often they discontinued their medications because
they were not helping. Possible answers were 1 = never,
2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, and 4 = often. The average
responses to those 3 questions were mean � SD 2.0 �
0.8, 1.5 � 0.7, and 1.2 � 0.5, respectively (13).
Daleboudt et al (14) assessed the level of self-reported
adherence and administered questionnaires to identify
determinants of nonadherence in 106 SLE patients from
the outpatient rheumatology clinic of the Auckland City
Hospital taking at least 1 immunosuppressive agent. The
Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory was used to
assess medication adherence. The mean � SD self-
reported adherence was 86.7% � 18.0% for all patients
(14). Oliveira-Santos et al (15) examined the prevalence
of adherence to medications in 246 SLE patients from
the lupus outpatient clinic at the Pedro Ernesto Univer-
sity Hospital. Adherence was measured using the Mor-
isky Medication Adherence Scale (16). They found that
68.3% of patients were nonadherent to their treatment
regimen for their SLE (15). Lastly, Abdul-Sattar and
Abou El Magd (17) examined medication adherence in
SLE patients from outpatient rheumatology clinics from
university hospitals in Egypt. The Compliance Question-
naire Rheumatology was used to assess adherence, and
patients were classified as nonadherent if taking <80% of
their medications correctly. The researchers found that
47.5% of patients were nonadherent to their SLE medica-
tion regimen (17).
Studies based on electronic monitoring devices. One
included study by Marengo et al (18) assessed adherence
using the Medication Event Monitoring System, which
involved a microchip in the cap of the medicine bottle
that records the date and time it was opened as well as
specialized software to calculate adherence measures.
Altogether, 78 SLE patients from outpatient rheumatology
clinics were followed over 2 years. Adherence was
determined
as
the
percentage
of
days
(weeks
for
methotrexate) that the patients took the medications as
prescribed; mean adherence was 62% for all drugs
combined (hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil,
methotrexate, and prednisone), with 75% of patients
classified as nonadherent, with average adherence <80%
(18).
Studies based on clinical records. Three studies used
clinical
records
to
assess
discontinuation
of
SLE
medications.
Morand
et al
(19)
used
an
Australian
clinical drug use database, which contained the dates of
initiation and commencement of hydroxychloroquine of
37 SLE patients over an 8-year period. At the end of
followup (8 years), 35% of patients had discontinued
antimalarial
therapy,
with
the
primary
reasons
for
stopping including remission (7 patients) and inefficiency
(4 patients) (19). Wang et al (20) used a Canadian clinical
lupus database to assess the timing and reasons for
discontinuation of antimalarials in 156 SLE patients.
They found that the median duration, in which an SLE
patient persisted with antimalarial therapy, was 6.1 years
per patient over a range of 35–84 months of observation
(20). Reasons for discontinuation included remission,
side
effects,
and
lack
of
efficacy,
as
well
as
“noncompliance,” a term which has historically been
used interchangeably with nonadherence. Lastly, Tsang-
A-Sjoe et al (21) conducted a longitudinal cohort study,
which used the Amsterdam Lupus Cohort, to assess
discontinuation of antimalarials in 139 SLE patients.
Here, 73.2% of SLE patients were using antimalarials at

 the end of the cohort followup. Among discontinuers,
reasons included intolerance (44.4%), quiescent disease
(13.9%), and ineffectiveness of the medication (2.8%).
Studies based on pharmacy refill data. Koneru et al
conducted
2
studies
(22,23)
examining
medication
adherence in SLE using pharmacy refill information. In
this instance, these were not refill records in automated
databases
(24).
Instead
the
researchers
inquired
for
information
about
where
participants
obtained
their
medications. These pharmacies were contacted, and the 4
most recent medication prescriptions (amounts and dates)
were collected, the MPR was calculated, and patients were
categorized as adherent (MPR ≥80%) or nonadherent
(MPR <80%) (25). In this group’s early work, they assessed
a convenience sample of 55 patients recruited from
university-affiliated rheumatology clinics to determine the
reliability and concurrent validity of the Medication
Adherence Self-Report Inventory with the gold standard
criterion, pharmacy refill information. They found that
39% of patients were nonadherent to prednisone and 51%
were nonadherent to hydroxychloroquine (23). Finally,
although the recent study by Koneru et al on medication
adherence in SLE was a qualitative study, we included it
in our systematic review as they used pharmacy refill
information to identify nonadherent patients, who were
then invited to face-to-face interviews to discuss barriers
to adherence and interventions to support adherence (22).
The
researchers
assessed
adherence
and
conducted
interviews of 63 SLE patients and found that 39% of
patients
were
nonadherent
to
prednisone,
51%
to
hydroxychloroquine, and 43% to other immunosuppressive
medications (22).

 Determinants of nonadherence. Data on the determinants
of medication adherence and nonadherence among SLE
patients, based on multivariable analyses, were reported
in 3 studies and summarized in Table 4 (15,17,18). Among
socioeconomic
factors,
lower
education
level
as
a
predictor of nonadherence was reported in 2 studies
(15,17). Among condition factors, having depression was
associated with nonadherence in 2 studies (17,18). With
respect to treatment factors, polypharmacy was associated
with nonadherence (17,18).
DISCUSSION
The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize
the data on the burden and determinants of medication
nonadherence among SLE patients. Overall, the percent-
age of nonadherent patients ranged from 43–75%, with
the majority of included studies reporting that over half
of SLE patients are nonadherent with treatment. These
studies assessed nonadherence in SLE among small
regionally specific clinical samples, with the number of
patients ranging from 32 to 246. The key determinants of
nonadherence that were reported in multiple studies
were having lower education (16,17), depression (17,18),
and polypharmacy (17,18). Altogether, this systematic
review confirms that the burden of nonadherence is sub-
stantial and significant in SLE. These findings also high-
light the need for more research on adherence using
more heterogeneous samples from different care settings,
as well as the need for research on interventions to sup-
port adherence among SLE patients.
In synthesizing the evidence of medication nonadher-
ence in SLE, we identified important limitations in the
literature to date. First, studies have not examined poor
execution and discontinuation, the distinct but equally
important aspects of medication adherence, together.
Second, some of these studies did not specify the medi-
cations being studied, which is problematic, because
some
medications
such
as
prednisone
are
used
primarily on a temporary basis to treat flares and are
not intended for long-term use, unlike antimalarials or
immunosuppressive
agents
(5,6).
Third,
all
of
the
included studies were based on small and regionally
specific
clinical
samples
(ranging
from
32
to
246),
which may not be generalizable to the population of all
SLE patients. Fourth, as every study used a prevalent
SLE cohort, they may be prone to survivorship bias,
because an SLE patient would need to survive until
they receive treatment to be included. Lastly, an addi-
tional limitation in the current literature was that only
3 studies (16–18) examined determinants of medication
nonadherence
in
SLE.
This
limitation
is
worrisome
because it is necessary to first understand the modifi-
able factors that are significantly associated with medi-
cation nonadherence before appropriate interventions
can be designed.
Across the included studies, a wide range of tools and
methods were used to assess medication adherence.
Because of this diversity, we could not standardize the
assessment of the quality of the measurement and report-
ing of medication adherence. Therefore, the STROBE
statement was used to assess how well the observational
research was reported. Although the included studies
met standards for describing rationale and methods, we
found that many studies did not report their findings in
a
clear
and
transparent
fashion.
The
percentage
of
reported nonadherent patients varied widely, which is
most likely due to such a wide range of methods used to
measure adherence. The most common method to ascer-
tain adherence among included studies was self-report,
which may tend to overestimate adherence because of
social desirability bias, whereby patients tend to over-
report good behaviors when they are being directly quer-
ied, which is a recognized problem in measurement of
adherence (26). In this regard, we observed that studies
based on self-report data had lower proportions of non-
adherent patients as compared with studies based on
electronic monitoring devices, which is most likely due

 to social desirability bias. Surprisingly, studies based on
pharmacy refill information estimated lower levels of
nonadherence when compared with electronic monitor-
ing devices. This result may have occurred for 2 reasons:
pharmacy refill information is only measuring a patient’s
possession of medication and not their actual medica-
tion-taking behavior, or, due to the fact that small region-

specific

observed may be simply due to chance. None of the
included studies used administrative electronic prescrip-
tion records to assess adherence, which counters the
recent trends of the increased use and wide acceptance
of retrospective, computerized databases for medication
adherence research (27,28).
With our main finding that the burden of medication
nonadherence in SLE is substantial, with over half of
patients nonadherent with treatment, a relevant implica-
tion of our systematic review is the need to improve
adherence and associated outcomes in SLE patients.
Indeed, prior research has shown that nonadherence con-
tributes to poor patient outcomes (29,30). Julian et al (31)
showed that patients who had problems with forgetting
to take medications had significantly greater numbers of
outpatient rheumatology and primary care visits and
were more likely to visit the emergency department
(odds ratio 1.45 [95% confidence interval 1.04–2.04], P =
0.03).
Using
US
Medicaid
data,
Feldman
et al
(29)
showed higher risks of emergency department visits and
hospitalizations
among
nonadherent
as
compared
to
adherent users of hydroxychloroquine and immunosup-
pressive medications, respectively. Thus, we highlight
some recommendations for health care providers to sup-
port adherence and improve outcomes. One should not
assume automatically that a patient is adherent. In addi-
tion, providing access to education material about treat-
ments, trying to reduce pill burden, and being observant
of
depressive
symptoms
and
providing
support
as
needed could be potential interventions to facilitate opti-
mal medication adherence to SLE treatments that would
improve outcomes.
Strengths and limitations of this systematic review
deserve discussion. Study strengths include a structured
approach to synthesizing evidence on medication nonad-
herence in SLE in terms of its burden and determinants.
Furthermore, because of our interest in methods of assess-
ing nonadherence, the current review also centers on the
various measurement methods (e.g., self-report, clinical
records, electronic monitoring devices, and pharmacy
refill data) and aspects of nonadherence in terms of poor
execution of the therapy or discontinuation of therapy.
This work also builds on a recent review article by
Costedoat-Chalumeau et al (32) through systematic search-
ing of the literature and comprehensive capture of studies.
Nonetheless, limitations of our systematic review bear dis-
cussion. First, identification and selection of studies for
inclusion may be limited by publication bias. Second,
while we assessed studies based on how well they
reported their observational research, we did not assess
the quality of medication adherence measurement due to
lack of an appropriate tool that would be applicable to
different methods used in the included studies. Third, we
limited our systematic review to include studies assessing
burden and determinants of nonadherence in SLE, neces-
sitating future synthesis of studies assessing outcomes
associated with nonadherence in SLE.
Overall, by demonstrating that over half of SLE patients
are nonadherent with antimalarial treatment across the
included studies, this systematic review confirms that
medication nonadherence is a significant problem in SLE.
This systematic review also highlights the need for more
research on nonadherence in more heterogeneous SLE
patient populations as well as interventions to support
adherence among SLE patients. Altogether, our findings
have important implications for SLE patients, health care
providers who prescribe SLE medications, and other
health care professionals involved in pharmacologic care
by emphasizing the importance of monitoring, discussing,
and supporting adherence with therapy.
