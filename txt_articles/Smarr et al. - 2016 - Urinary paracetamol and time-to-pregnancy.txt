study question: Is preconception urinary paracetamol (acetaminophen) associated with time-to-pregnancy (TTP)?
summary answer: Higher urinary paracetamol concentrations among male partners were associated with a longer TTP.
what is known already: Paracetamol is a commonly used analgesic among women and men of all ages. As metabolites of select che-
micals used in the manufacturing ofpolyurethane foam,dyesand various industrial products, aswellasacommon medicinal product, paracetamol
and its primary metabolite p-aminophenol, are ubiquitous in the environment. Studies investigating the relationship between adult urinary con-
centrations of paracetamol and TTP are lacking.
study design, size, duration: This prospective cohort included 501 couples discontinuing contraception for the purposes of
attempting conception during the years 2005–2009 and residing in Michigan or Texas, USA.
participants/materials, setting, methods: Totalurinaryparacetamol,itsmetabolitepara-aminophenol(p-aminophenol),
and a summary measure of both urinary biomarkers were quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray
triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Female partners used the Clearbluew digital home test to confirm pregnancy. Cox’s
proportional odds models for discrete survival time were used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), urinary creatinine, preconception smoking status, race/ethnicity and household income. Models were
further adjusted for hypothyroidism and hypertension as an attempt to account for possible indications of paracetamol medication use. FOR
estimates ,1.0 denote a longer TTP (diminished fecundity). Models were performed to examine urinary concentrations of paracetamol as a
continuous and variable or categorized into quartiles. In light of TTP being a couple-dependent outcome, models were first performed for
females and males, modeled separately, and then modeled for couples with each partner’s concentrations being adjusted for the other.
main results and the role of chance: Amongthe 501 enrolled couples, 347 (69%) had an human chorionic gonadotrophin con-
firmed pregnancy. Urinary concentrations of paracetamol were lowest among females and males who achieved pregnancy and p-aminophenol con-
centrations were lowest among those not achieving pregnancy. Urinary paracetamol concentrations were higher among female than male partners
(Median ¼ 26.6 and 13.2 ng/ml, respectively; P , 0.0001). After adjustment for age, BMI, urinary creatinine, preconception smoking status, race/
ethnicity and household income, the highest quartile of male urinary paracetamol was associated with a longer TTP [FOR ¼ 0.67; 95%
CI ¼ (0.47, 0.95)]. This association remained after adjustment for chronic health conditions, hypothyroidism and hypertension and female partner’s
urinary paracetamol concentration [FOR ¼ 0.65; 95% CI ¼ (0.45, 0.94)]. No associations were observed between female or male partners’ urinary
concentrations of paracetamol or of its metabolite p-aminophenol when urinary concentrations were modeled continuously.
limitations, reasons for caution: Only a single spot urine was available for analysis despite the short-lived nature of paracetamol.
Additionally, participants were not asked to provide information on indication of use for paracetamol medications; any underlying conditions for the
paracetamol use would have been potential confounders.

Introduction
Public health concerns have increased regarding the potential role of en-
vironmental chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants, phthalates
and heavy metals, as important contributors to male, female and couple
fecundity (Eskenazi et al., 2010; Harley et al., 2010; Bloom et al., 2011;
Buck Louis et al., 2012; Buck Louis et al., 2013; Specht et al., 2015;
Velez et al., 2015a,b). Like many of these environmental chemicals, para-
cetamol is ubiquitous in contemporary environments with routes of
exposures stemming from health status (e.g. medicinal use for chronic
musculoskeletal pain) and other environmental sources (e.g. drinking
water).
As commonly used analgesic and antipyretic, paracetamol (also known
as acetaminophen in the USA and Canada) is found in a large number of
over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs (Lank, 2014). Approxi-
mately 30–70% of pregnant women report having taken acetamino-
phen/paracetamol at least once during pregnancy when queried in
(inter)national epidemiologic studies (Werler et al., 2005; Rebordosa
et al., 2008), underscoring the ubiquitous exposure for reproductive
aged populations. Furthermore, low levels of paracetamol have been
detected in drinking water (Wu et al., 2012). Interestingly, aniline, achem-
ical used in the synthesis and manufacturing of many industrial products
(e.g. dyes, polyurethane foam, rubber processing chemicals) (ATSDR,
2011), metabolizes into p-aminophenol and paracetamol. As a reflection
of their environmentally abundance, urinary concentrations of paraceta-
mol and an isomer of p-aminophenol have been readily detected at
levelsashighas2 263and39 161 mg/l,respectively, inageneralEuropean
population without occupational or medicinal exposure (Dierkes et al.,
2014).
Paracetamol readily crosses the placental barrier (Gaber, 2006). Due
to associations with increased percentages of abnormal sperm, reduced
anogential distance and decreased testosterone production in rodent
studies (Kristensen et al., 2011, 2012; Thiele et al., 2013), paracetamol
is suspected to have endocrine disrupting properties. In human
studies,aDanishprospectivebirthcohortstudyreportedthatcompared
with mothers who reported no medication use during pregnancy,
women who used paracetamol for more than 2 weeks during the first
and second trimesters had an increased risk of delivering boys with con-
genital cryptorchidism (Kristensen et al., 2011). Other European studies
ofparacetamoluseassessedduringpregnancyhavereportedsimilarfind-
ings, with significant associations betweenmaternal paracetamol use and
male reproductive disorders (Jensen et al., 2010; Philippat et al., 2011;
Snijder et al., 2012).
To our knowledge, despite the growing bodyof literaturesurrounding
exposure and reproductive considerations, the relationship between
paracetamol and sensitive measures of human fecundity, such as
time-to-pregnancy (TTP) or the number of menstrual cycles or calendar
months required to achieve pregnancy, has not been previously
explored. We sought to prospectively assess male and female partners’
urinary concentrations of paracetamol and TTP in the present analysis.
Materials and Methods
Study population and participants
The Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) Study
comprises 501 reproductive aged couples who were recruited upon discon-
tinuingcontraceptionfor ≤2monthspriortoenrollment,forpurposesofbe-
coming pregnant. Couples were recruited from 16 counties in Michigan and
Texas between 2005 and 2009, as previously described (Buck Louis et al.,
2011). Inclusion criteria were minimal: females aged 18–40 and males
aged ≥18 years; in a committed relationship; no physician diagnosis of infer-
tility/sterility; females’ menstrual cycles ranging between 21 and 42 days
without any injectable hormonal contraceptives in the past year; and an
ability to communicate in English or Spanish.
Ethical approval
Institutional review board approvals were obtained from all collaborating
institutions; couples gave written informed consent prior to study participa-
tion and any data collection.
Urinary analysis of paracetamol and its
metabolite
After the baseline interview during the enrollment home visit, couples pro-
vided a non-fasting urine sample. Chemical analysis of total urinary paraceta-
mol and p-aminophenol was performed at the Wadsworth Center,
New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY. Specifically, 300 ml of
1 M ammonium acetate containing 30 U of b-glucuronidase (pH ¼ 5.5)
was added to 500 ml of urine sample, followed by incubation at 378C for
12 h.Targetanalyteswereextractedthricewithethylacetateandwerequan-
tified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (Acquity I Class;
Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled with an electrospray triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry (API 5500; AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA)
(UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Separation of target analytes was carried out by a
Kinetex C18 (1.3 m, 100A, 50 × 2.1 mm) column (Phenomenex; Torrance,
CA, USA) with a SecurityGuard guard column (Phenomenex) and positive
ionization, multiple reaction monitoring mode of detection. Quality assur-
ance and quality control parameters included procedural blanks, matrix
spikes and duplicate analysis of samples. Labeled internal standards
(d7-p-aminophenol and 13C2-15N-paracetamol) were spiked into all samples
and quantification was by isotope dilution. The method limits of quantification
(LOQ) for p-aminophenol and paracetamol were 0.25 and 0.5 ng/ml,
Smarr et al.
2120
 respectively. Creatinine was quantified using a Roche/Hitachi Model 912 clin-
icalanalyzer (Dallas,TX, USA)and the CreatininePlusAssay. Inaddition, non-
fasting blood samples were collected from each partner for the measurement
of serum cotinine using liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass
spectrometry and the results are reported in ng/ml (Bernert et al., 1997).
Lifestyle and TTP data collection
Upon enrollment, in-person interviewswereconducted with eachpartnerof
the couple to ascertain lifestyle and reproductive history followed by stand-
ard anthropometric assessments to measure body mass index (BMI)
(Lohman et al., 1988). Daily journals were completed by both partners to
capture various lifestyle behaviors relevant to fecundity and sexual inter-
course; women’s journals also recorded menstruation and pregnancy test
results. Women were instructed in the use of the Clearbluew Easyhome fer-
tility monitor to track daily concentrations of estrone-3-glucuronide and lu-
teinizing hormones to help time intercourse relative to ovulation. The
fertility monitor is accurate in detecting the luteinizing hormone surge
(99%) and in predicting peak fertility (91%) compared with the ultrasonog-
raphy gold standard (Behre et al., 2000). Additionally, female partners
were instructed in the use of the Clearbluew digital pregnancy test, which
is capable of detecting 25 mIU/ml human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)
when used on the day of expected menstruation. Urine for each woman
was tested at baseline to ensure the absence of pregnancy. The Clearbluew
Digital home pregnancy test is capable of detecting pregnancy with 99% ac-
curacywhenusedfromthedayofexpectedmenstrualcycle(Tomlinsonetal.,
2008). Couples achieving pregnancy in the first few weeks post-enrollment
were categorized as having a TTP ¼ 0 and those achieving pregnancy
during the first fully observed cycle were categorized as having a TTP ¼ 1.
Couples were followed until pregnancy or a year of trying, at which point
TTP was censored.
Statistical analysis
Univariate analyses were performed to assess the distributions of paracetamol,
its metabolite p-aminophenol and relevant covariates. Female and male lifestyle
characteristicswerecomparedbyobservedpregnancystatususingindependent
t-tests and x2 tests for continuous and categorical covariates, respectively. Cor-
relations between female and male partner’s paracetamol and p-aminophenol
urinary concentrations were examined with the use of Spearman rank analyses.
Median and accompanying interquartile ranges (IQRs) of baseline urinary chem-
ical concentrations (ng/ml) were calculated; medians were compared between
females and males using Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests. To avoid biasing re-
gression estimates, instrument-derived values (i.e. baseline noise) for both che-
micals were used in all models with urinary creatinine included as a covariate;
urinary concentrations below the LOQ were not substituted in any manner
(Richardson and Ciampi, 2003; Lubin et al., 2004; Schisterman et al., 2006). In
the event of missing chemical data as the result of insufficient female (6%) and
male (12%) urine for chemical quantification, data were imputed with Box–
Cox transformation, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (Schafer,
1997). Urinary creatinine and chemical concentrations were natural-log trans-
formed (ln) to normalize distributions.
Cox proportional odds models for discrete survival time were used to es-
timatefecundabilityoddsratios(FORs)and 95%CIs,whichallowsforacycle-
varyingintercept (Cox,1972).Modelsaccountedforlefttruncationreflecting
the time couples had discontinued contraception, and also right censoring as
couples exited the study or reached 1 year of trying. FORs estimate the odds
of becoming pregnant each cycle, conditional on not being pregnant in the
previous cycle. FORestimates ,1.0 reflect a longer TTP suggestiveof dimin-
ished fecundity, while FORs .1 reflect a shorter TTP orenhanced fecundity.
Urinary concentrations of paracetamol, p-aminophenol, and a summary
measure of both urinary biomarkers were first modeled individually for
each partner and adjusted based on a priori selection of confounders:
non-time-varying age (years), BMI (25 ≤ BMI , 30, 30 ≤ BMI , 35 and
BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 compared with BMI , 25 kg/m2), urinary creatinine (ng/ml),
preconception smoking status (serum cotinine above/below10 ng/ml
indicative of active smoking or not (Hukkanen et al., 2005; Benowitz et al.,
2009)),
race/ethnicity
(non-White/White)
and
household
income
(above/below $70 000). We refer to these models as partner-specific
models of TTP. Partner-specific models were further adjusted for chronic
health conditions, namely, hypothyroidism (Wilson and Walton, 1959;
Golding, 1970; Cakir et al., 2003) and hypertension (Lawrence, 1975; Ker-
khoff et al., 2012; Bae et al., 2015), in an attempt to control for differences
in the use of paracetamol medication. In light of low correlation between
both partners’ biomarker levels (r¼ 0.11 for paracetamol and r¼ 0.10 for
p-aminophenol), we re-ran models with the same covariates including the
urinary concentrations of the other partner to assess TTP as a couple-
dependent outcome. Couple-based models of TTP were adjusted to
account for both partners’ covariates and the difference between female
and male age (years). Furthermore, models were run first with urinary con-
centrations left continuous. To assess potential nonlinear associations,
models were performed with urinary paracetamol and p-aminophenol con-
centrations categorized into quartiles. Wald testswereperformed to testfor
nonlinear trend across quartiles of chemical concentrations.
As a sensitivity analysis, TTP was modeled against non-imputed urinary
concentrations of paracetamol and p-aminophenol to determine whether
the obtained results were different from the primary analyses. Given the ex-
ploratory nature of this study and the bias introduced to point estimates of
association when excluding participants with missing information (White
and Carlin, 2010; Desai et al., 2011), we focused on the imputed data in
the primary analysis to reduce the number of comparisons and preserve
our type I error rate.
Results
Among the 501 enrolled couples, 347 (69%) had an observed hCG con-
firmed pregnancy within a year. The cohort comprised mostly non-
Hispanic White couples with household incomes ≥$70 000 (Table I).
Females and males achieving pregnancy tended to be younger in age,
had lower BMIs, were more parous and had a lower prevalence of pre-
conception smoking compared with those not achieving pregnancy
during the study. Characteristics of females and males who withdrew
from the study (n ¼ 100, 20%) were similar with those not achieving
pregnancy during the study (Table I).
The comparisons of urinary paracetamol and p-aminophenol distribu-
tions for female and male partners by pregnancy status are displayed in
Table II. Overall, paracetamol and p-aminophenol were readily detected
in both male and female urine samples, with the percentage of urine
samples with measurable concentrations ranging between 93 and 100%.
Urinary concentrations of paracetamol were lowest among females and
males who achieved pregnancy, and p-aminophenol concentrations
were lowest among those who did not achieve pregnancy (Table II).
When examining urinary concentrations of paracetamol by covariates of
interest, geometric means differed by race/ethnicity and smoking status
at baseline among female urine samples (Supplementary data, Table SI).
Additionally, mean urinary p-aminophenol differed by BMI and household
income levels. Overall, urinary paracetamol concentrations were higher
for females than for males [Median ¼ 26.6 and 13.2 ng/ml, respectively;
P , 0.0001]. Similarly, the median urinary p-aminophenol was higher in
females [Median ¼ 957; IQR ¼ (446, 2190) ng/ml], compared with
male partners [Median ¼ 726; IQR ¼ (405, 1378) ng/ml; P ¼ 0.000].

female urinary paracetamol and TTP. Nonetheless, the fourth quartile
of male partners’ urinary paracetamol was associated with delayed
TTP in the adjusted couple-based models [a FOR ¼ 0.65; 95% CI ¼
(0.47, 0.98); P-trend ¼ 0.02]. No associations were observed when

 demonstrates that the probability of remaining non-pregnant tended to
be higher among couples whose male partners had urinary paracetamol
concentrations in the fourth versus first quartile.
In sensitivity analyses restricted to females and males without missing
urinary concentrations of paracetamol biomarkers (n¼ 435; 87%), the
third quartile (19.95–157 ng/ml) of female partners’ urinary paraceta-
mol was associated with a shorter TTP (enhanced fecundity), in partner-
specific and couple-based models controlling for demographic and
chronic health confounders (Supplementary data, Table SII). When the
analyses were restricted to males without missing chemical data, the
observed association with the fourth quartile of urinary paracetamol
remained although it was slightly attenuated (Supplementary data,
Table SII).
Discussion
These are the first data known to have assessed preconception urinary
concentrations of total paracetamol and its metabolite, p-aminophenol,
in relationtoTTP,reflectiveofcouplefecundity. Paracetamol concentra-
tions measured in urine for our study were readily detected in both
women and men with detection frequencies well above 90%. We
found male urinary concentrations of paracetamol in the highest quartile
(.73.5 ng/ml) to be consistentlyassociated with a longer TTP acrossall
partner-specific and couple-based models. In contrast, female urinary
biomarkers were not associated with TTP in all primary partner-specific
or couple-based models.
Interpretation of our findings in relation to other populations is chal-
lenging due to the dearth of literature regarding the quantification of
paracetamol in preconception urine and prospectively assessed TTP.
As such, these findings may potentially be of clinical and public health
relevance from two perspectives. First, there is a prevalent use of para-
cetamol globally as an OTC medication among men and women of all
ages (Kaufman et al., 2002) including children 0 months to 12 years of
age (Vernacchio et al., 2009). Second paracetamol and p-aminophenol
measured in urine may also be the result of exposure to other ubiqui-
tous chemicals in the environment. Specifically, p-aminophenol is a
primary metabolite of aniline which is used in the manufacturing of
various industrial products (Dierkes et al., 2014), and in other indus-
tries, e.g. meat production (Modick et al., 2014). The high detection
frequency of paracetamol in our cohort among both men and
women (93 and 97%, respectively) from two geographically different
states may corroborate the variety of potential sources of paracetamol
exposure.
In light of the high detection frequency of paracetamol in urine and the
stark gender differences in urinary concentrations of paracetamol, with
the highest distribution being among the females in the LIFE study, the
lack of association between female urinary concentrations of paraceta-
mol and TTP is worthy of further consideration. One possible explan-
ation could be that chronic medical conditions resulting in paracetamol
usemaydifferbygenderandtheseconditionsmayalsohavethepotential
to directly affect human fecundity. Such information on chronic health
conditions associated with chronic pain was not collected. As such,
our model adjustment for hypothyroidism or hypertension did not com-
pletelyaddressindicationfor pain medication butmore so othermedica-
tions (e.g. hormone therapy, antihypertensive drugs), as seen by the
slightly attenuated observed male findings and the lack of change regard-
ing our conclusions for female results. Another possibility to consider is
that although females had higher measured concentrations of urinary
paracetamol,perhapsinthecontextofhumanhealth,thesourceofpara-
cetamol exposure may be of more importance than the magnitude of
measured concentrations. Therefore, the observed associations may
be confounded by differences in paracetamol exposure source; such in-
formation (e.g. self-report of occupational versus environmental expo-
sures) was not collected and therefore was not included in regression
models. Future research might consider source apportionment analyses
inordertofurtherunderstandtherelationshipbetweenparacetamoland
couple fecundity. While we were unable to perform such work, we did
include an aggregate exposure measure (sum of both urinary paraceta-
mol biomarkers) in relation to TTP, as an attempt to account for a multi-
tude of potential exposure sources.
Despite the fact that we consistently observed an association among
male, but not female, urinary paracetamol and TTP, there are several
study design and analytic strengths to our analysis. First is the LIFE
Study’s prospective assessment of couples’ TTP, which is comparable
with the few other prospective cohort studies of TTP (Bonde et al.,
1998; Gnoth et al., 2003; Mikkelsen et al., 2009; Steiner et al., 2011;
Wise et al., 2015). In the LIFE Study, 69% of couples achieved hCG con-
firmed pregnancies, of which 90% occurred within six menstrual cycles.
Secondly, we are the first to quantify urinary metabolite, p-aminophenol
and total paracetamol in both partners at the time that they began trying
for pregnancy. Thirdly, we do not believe that model estimates were
heavily influenced by exposure misclassification given that our analyses
relied on measured paracetamol in urine, rather than the low prevalence
of the self-reported paracetamol use (2.6 and 1.2% for females and
males in LIFE, respectively). Lastly, our use of Cox proportional odds
models for discrete survival with a time-varying intercept minimizes
informationbias byutilizingallinformationprovided bystudy participants,
whileunderfollow-upandpriortocensoring,asingleestablishedprotocol
was used for quantifying all urine samples while being blinded to TTP.

 Still, we mustalso acknowledgethe potential limitations of the present
analysis.Regardingourexposureofinterest,paracetamolhasashortbio-
logic half-life, such that 24 h post-ingestion, 85–95% of the chemical has
been excreted by the kidneys (Forrest et al., 1982). Therefore, the use of
a single spot urine collected at study baseline to estimate preconception
exposures of paracetamol is an important limitation. Nonetheless, even
the use of a single urinary measurement of paracetamol may reduce po-
tential exposure misclassification resulting from the sole reliance on
questionnaire data to capture exposures, given the abundance of para-
cetamol in contemporary environments from a variety of sources, and
given the general lack of awareness of the many medications which
contain variable doses of paracetamol as a secondary ingredient (Lank,
2014). Also, we cannot ignore the potential for confounding given that
informationonindicationofmedicinalparacetamolusewasnotavailable.
Ultimately, our findings need to be cautiously interpreted until corrobo-
rated by future research based on serial measurements.
Havingconsideredthestrengthsandlimitationsofthecurrentanalysis,
one question that remains unanswered is the biological mechanism
explaining adult male paracetamol exposure and delayed TTP. A previ-
ous in vitro analysis of adult human testis and various analgesics reported
a reduction in testosterone secretion after 24 h by 18 and 30%, in re-
sponse to paracetamol exposure at 1025 and 1024 molar concentra-
tions, respectively. This finding may have implications for sperm count
and couple fecundity (Albert et al., 2013), but there remains a need for
more research to further elucidate the mechanisms by which paraceta-
mol affects fecundity.
Overall, we found a consistent association between higher paraceta-
mol concentrations in men and delayed TTP, but we cannot rule out re-
sidual confounding by indication of medication use or the potential for
chance findings. Our exploratory findings do, however, support the
needforfuturestudiestoconsiderbothpartners’exposureswhenasses-
sing couple-dependent outcomes such as TTP. Still, our findings await
corroboration using research that incorporates serial collection of
urinary paracetamol and detailed information on medicinal and environ-
mental exposures in the context of couple fecundity.
