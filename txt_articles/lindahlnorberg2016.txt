BACKGROUND: There is insufficient knowledge regarding the economic impact of childhood cancer on parents. The objectives of the
current study were to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of childhood cancer on mothers’ and fathers’ income from em-
ployment and employment status. METHODS: The study sample consisted of the parents of children diagnosed with cancer from
2004 to 2009 in Sweden (3626 parents of 1899 children). Annual register data concerning income from employment and employ-
ment status (employed/not employed) were retrieved from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor
Market Studies. Using generalized linear models, the mean income from employment and employment status were compared with a
matched control cohort of 34,874 parents sampled from the general population. RESULTS: Parents’ income was found to decrease
significantly after the child’s cancer diagnosis. The effect was most pronounced for mothers, whose income was reduced for 6 years
after diagnosis, whereas fathers’ income was similar to that of control fathers 3 years after the diagnosis. Mothers were more likely to
stop working after a child’s cancer diagnosis compared with controls. No association was found for fathers’ employment status. Youn-
ger age of parents; lower level of education; and, among mothers, being born outside of Sweden were found to be associated with
more adverse effects on income. CONCLUSIONS: Parents’ income from employment and employment status appear to be adversely
affected by having a child with cancer. Socioeconomic consequences are not distributed equally: the income of fathers appears to
catch up after a few years, whereas mothers tend to be disadvantaged in their professional life for several years after a child’s cancer
diagnosis. Cancer 2016;000:000–000. V

INTRODUCTION
Childhood cancer is a highly stressful experience for the affected child and his or her family.1-3 For the parents, the disease
is associated with challenges both during and after treatment that interfere with the family’s normal activities and routines,
often for a long time. These include adaptation to the unpredictable course of treatment; the acquisition of specific care-
giving skills related to, for example, the side effects of treatments; the child’s psychological response to treatment; and pos-
sible sequelae.3,4 To balance caring and work commitments, some parents reduce their working hours or change
employment.5 Reductions in earnings due to reduced working hours or discontinued employment combined with addi-
tional expenses may cause financial strain for the affected families.2,6-8
Substantial work disruption and income losses have been reported previously,6,9-16 with 30% to 50% of families
reporting that at least 1 parent stopped working to provide care for their child.5 To our knowledge to date, studies examin-
ing economical and occupational consequences for parents typically have been small, cross-sectional, without appropriate
control groups, and often relying on retrospective self-reports. Consequently, the evidence given is of modest quality,5
thereby indicating the need for more rigorously designed studies. One study using national registry data17 indicated ad-
verse outcomes with regard to parents’ earnings and employment only in certain subgroups when compared with the gen-
eral population, but further studies are warranted to determine how childhood cancer impacts work and income and for
the identification of particularly vulnerable groups.

Original Article
 In this population-based cohort study, we evaluated
income from employment and employment status in
mothers and fathers of children diagnosed with cancer us-
ing national registry data. In addition, we examined how
child, family, and demographic characteristics were asso-
ciated with income reductions and job discontinuation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study cohort consisted of the parents of children
(those aged � 18 years) who were diagnosed with primary
cancer between 2004 and 2009. Children were identified
via the Swedish Childhood Cancer Registry. Statistics
Sweden identified parents using the children’s personal
identification numbers. The study sample consisted of
1899 families with a child diagnosed with cancer (Fig. 1).
More than half of the children were boys (1024 chil-
dren; 54%). Central nervous system tumor was the most
frequent diagnosis (527 children; 28%), followed by leu-
kemia (512 children; 27%) and soft tissue sarcoma (112
children; 6%). The median age at the time of diagnosis
was 7 years. The majority of children (761 children; 40%)
were diagnosed between the ages of birth and 4 years,
20% (373 children) between the ages of 5 and 9 years,
24% (461 children) between the ages of 10 and 14 years,
and 16% (304 children) at age � 15 years.
A matched control cohort design was used. The
controls were individually matched with the families of
children diagnosed with cancer based on the following
factors evaluated 2 years before the year of diagnosis:
child’s year of birth, family status (mother and father liv-
ing together, single custody, joint custody but not living
together, and other), county of residence, number of
children living at home, parental age, and family dispos-
able income. The matching procedure (10 control fami-
lies for each exposed family) aimed for equivalence of key
characteristics between the families of children with can-
cer and controls at a time when the family most likely
had not yet been impacted by the child’s cancer (defined
as 2 years before diagnosis). Table 1 presents the sociode-
mographic characteristics of the study sample.
Measures
Data regarding the annual gross income from employ-
ment, employment status (employed/not employed) as of
November of each year, and demographic information
were extracted for the years 1990 through 2011 from the
Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance
and Labor Market Studies (LISA using the Swedish acro-
nym). LISA holds annual registers, integrates data from
the labor market and educational and social sectors, and
includes all individuals aged >16 years who were regis-
tered in Sweden on December 31 of each year.
Statistical Analysis
The mean income and proportion employed among the
parents of children with cancer and control parents were
compared over time by year, from 1 year before diagnosis
until the end of follow-up. Income and employment sta-
tus were analyzed separately for mothers and fathers.

 Generalized linear models were used to compare the mean
income between the parents of children diagnosed with
cancer and control parents and over the years.18 We used
a log-link function. The estimated regression coefficients
were exponentiated to obtain estimated mean income ra-
tios. All regression models included the childhood cancer/
control binary indicator, indicator variables for calendar
year (1 year before diagnosis was the reference year), and
the interaction terms between the childhood cancer/con-
trol indicator and all year indicators. The following cova-
riates were considered in the adjusted models, all of which
were evaluated the year before diagnosis (ie, baseline):
parent’s age, income, living arrangement, education, em-
ployment status, country of birth, municipality of resi-
dence, and number of children living at home (Table 1).
The observations between matched groups were consid-
ered independent, whereas those from the same matched
group and the repeated observations within families over
time were considered as dependent. Therefore, P values
and 95% confidence intervals were based on robust esti-
mates of the standard errors that took the potential intra-
family
and
intra-matched-group
dependence
into
account. The cluster-robust sandwich estimator was used,
which is consistent with dependent data and does not re-
quire any assumptions regarding the distribution of the
regression residuals.19 The large sample size guaranteed
that the asymptotic approximation for the standard errors
was sufficiently accurate despite the potential right-
skewness of the regression residuals and the within-
matched-group stochastic dependence.
The difference between the father’s and mother’s in-
come was calculated by including this difference as an in-
dependent variable in a linear regression model. Time
since diagnosis (as a categorical variable), the childhood
cancer/control indicator, and their interactions were in-
cluded as independent variables. Standard errors were esti-
mated with the cluster-robust sandwich estimator.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata statis-
tical software (version 14; StataCorp LP, College Station,
Tex).

 The regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm
approved the current study.
RESULTS
Analyses confirmed equivalence of the parents of children
with cancer and controls at 2 years before diagnosis for the
following variables: living arrangement, parental age,
number of children living at home, county of residence,
disposable income, and education (P values > .10).
Income From Employment
Mean income from employment per year is presented in
Figure 2. Income from employment decreased significant-
ly after the child’s cancer diagnosis (Table 2). A statistical-
ly significant 21% reduction in mothers’ earnings and a
statistically significant 10% reduction in fathers’ earnings
were found for the year of diagnosis when compared with
control mothers and fathers, respectively. The relative re-
duction in the income of mothers was evident up to 6
years after diagnosis (Table 2). Fathers’ income was com-
parable to that of control fathers 3 years after diagnosis
(Table 2).
Table 3 shows the results of the stratified analysis by
demographic characteristics. Among mothers, lower in-
come from employment at baseline, lower level of educa-
tion, younger age, being unemployed at baseline, living in
an intermediate-/densely populated area, having been
born outside of Sweden, and having children living at
home were associated with larger income reductions.
Among fathers, employment at baseline, cohabiting with
another adult (regardless of marital status), younger age,
and low level of education were associated with larger in-
come reductions (Table 3).
On average, the father’s income was higher than that
of the mother at all time points in both the families of
children with cancer and control families. The difference
between the father’s and mother’s income decreased over
time in the control families but not in the families of the
children with cancer. The difference in trend between the
families of the children with cancer and control families
was statistically significant (test for interaction between
childhood cancer/control status and time, P 5 .0099).
Having a child diagnosed at a younger age was found
to be associated with more pronounced and long-term
reductions in income (Table 4). In stratified analysis, the
most adverse effects were found for the fathers of children
aged birth to 4 years at the time of diagnosis and mothers
of children aged �9 years at diagnosis (test for 3-way in-
teraction between childhood cancer/control status, time,
and child’s age at diagnosis, P 5 .0022).

 Sensitivity analysis excluding parents after the event of
the child’s death (in total, 298 children diagnosed with can-
cer died during the study period) was conducted. The crude
estimates from these analyses were broadly similar, with a
statistically significant relative reduction in the income of
mothers up to 6 years after the year of diagnosis and of
fathers up to 1 year after diagnosis (data not shown).
Employment Status
Mothers were less likely to remain in employment after a
child’s cancer diagnosis when compared with control
mothers (Table 2). This effect was evident at the year of
diagnosis and up to 5 years later. Risk factors for unem-
ployment among mothers included low educational level,
living in an intermediate-/densely populated area, and
having children living at home (data not shown).
Having a child with cancer did not appear to affect
the employment status of the fathers, and none of the ana-
lyzed sociodemographic factors indicated subgroups at
risk of unemployment.
DISCUSSION
The results of the current study indicate that parents’ in-
come from employment is adversely affected by having a
child with cancer. Mothers’ income was lower than
expected for several years after diagnosis whereas fathers’
income returned to the expected level after a few years. A
child’s cancer also affected the mother’s employment situ-
ation in that mothers were less likely to remain in employ-
ment. In addition to differences between mothers and
fathers, level of education, age, country of birth, and base-
line income were found to be among the most important
determinants of the effect of a child’s cancer diagnosis on
income.
In keeping with previous studies,6,7,9,20 the current
study findings confirm that childhood cancer affects
parents’ employment and earnings negatively, and that

 the most pronounced income reductions are evident
shortly after diagnosis. However, the long-term conse-
quences, occurring years after diagnosis, are to our knowl-
edge not well established, with earlier studies reporting
conflicting results.7,14,17,21 The results of the current
study extend these findings, using detailed register data
for more precise reporting of the effects.
The current study findings demonstrate that the
effects of childhood cancer on income and employment
are not equally distributed among mothers and fathers. In
the short term, significant reductions in both mothers’
and fathers’ earnings were found, but even in the short-
term mothers were found to have larger income reduc-
tions than fathers. In accord with previous studies,7,17,21
the income of fathers of children with cancer returned to a
level equal to that of fathers of the general population after
a few years. In contrast, mothers were at risk of experienc-
ing long-lasting income reductions. The findings of the
current study further demonstrate that a child’s cancer
was associated with job discontinuation among mothers,
but not fathers. However, one should bear in mind that
income reductions for fathers may signal that they also ex-
perience work disruptions even if no effect was found for
fathers’ employment status. The effects on parents’ in-
come and employment warrant careful consideration as to
their potential causes and implications. The more adverse
associations noted among mothers may be because moth-
ers have been reported to display a higher level of psycho-
logical stress than fathers after a child’s cancer.1,3 The
psychosocial impact of the cancer experience thus may dif-
fer for mothers and fathers, with particular consequences
on the mothers’ ability to maintain working hours and/or
return to work. In addition, the mothers of children with
cancer have been found to report a higher rate of sick leave
than fathers,9 which may partly account for the more pro-
nounced reductions in earnings. Furthermore, the more
adverse effects on mothers may be because female-
dominated jobs are less flexible than jobs with a more
equal share of men and women,22 because having flexible
work arrangements facilitates parents staying at home to
care for a sick child without using formal leave. Differ-
ences in parenting roles,2 with fathers taking on the tradi-
tional gender role as primary breadwinner and mothers
the role of primary caregiver, might also serve as a possible
explanation. Mothers accordingly may be more prone to
adjust their paid work to their family and caregiving

 responsibilities than fathers. It has even been suggested
that fathers may need to work more to compensate for
declines in mothers’ earnings.17 Cultural differences re-
garding traditional gender roles might account for the dif-
ferent patterns found for mothers and fathers in relation
to country of birth. This line of reasoning fits with the the-
ory that parents born in Sweden tend to share parental
benefit days more equally than those born abroad.23
In the current study, mothers with a higher income
before the child’s cancer were found to have an equivalent
income level to control mothers at 4 years after diagnosis,
whereas more adverse effects were found for mothers with
a lower baseline income. This may be attributed to the less
flexible working conditions generally associated with low-
wage occupations.24A mother with a lower-income job
may more often need to take a day off to care for her sick
child, whereas a mother with a higher-wage job may have
the opportunity to work at home/at the hospital without
using formal care leave and as such lose income. Corre-
spondingly, jobs only requiring a lower educational level
in general are believed to be less flexible,25 which may par-
tially explain the more adverse effects noted among moth-
ers with a lower education.
More adverse effects on income were found for
parents, particularly fathers, who were cohabiting. Parents
may wish to work less after the experience of cancer in one
of their children,26 and parents who share household and
breadwinning burdens may more often have a choice to
do so. Furthermore, this finding may reflect a gender dif-
ference in parenting burden,2 which may be accentuated
because fathers who are separated from a partner are less
likely to live with their children.27
We found that the income of the parents of children
diagnosed at a younger age was more adversely affected.
Young age at diagnosis is associated with a higher caregiv-
ing burden, which might account for the more pro-
nounced income reductions found for parents of younger
aged children.
The economic stress of families can be ameliorated,
to some extent, by a country’s social security system. In
Sweden, the social security system offers families state
benefits when parents are unable to work due to caring for
a sick child (eg, parental benefit and childcare allowance)
or when the ability to work is reduced due to own illness
(sickness benefit). These state benefits, which are lower
than their income from employment, are available for a
limited number of days annually. During the treatment of
a potentially fatal disease such as cancer, the number of
days that a parent can receive parental benefits is unlimit-
ed, but is determined on the basis of a pediatrician’s pre-
scription. Nevertheless, parents in Sweden have been
found to experience economic strain.9,28 It is important
to note that income reductions and reduced working
hours, even for a shorter period of time, may have long-
term implications for a family’s financial security, career
opportunities, wage development, and state pensions.
In countries with a less generous social security sys-
tem and less rigorous national regulations regarding work,
the parents of children with cancer may need to continue
working to avoid financial hardship. In such societies, the
reductions in income from employment may not be as
pronounced as in the current study if the parents are
forced to continue working. Conversely, in countries in
which parents do not have the legal right to reduce their
working hours, as is the case in Sweden, to leave work may
be the only option for those with an increased care bur-
den. In such instances, the effects on income and employ-
ment may be more adverse.
The Psychosocial Standards of Care5 recommend
that all pediatric oncology centers assess families for finan-
cial hardship from the time of diagnosis through cancer
treatment and into survivorship or bereavement. The as-
sessment aims to identify those families in need of tar-
geted referral for financial counseling and supportive
resources. The importance of such an assessment is em-
phasized by the findings of the current study.
Certain limitations to the current study need to be
considered. Despite the high overall completeness of
LISA, some missing values were found, which can be
explained by the individual not being registered in
Sweden on December 31 of a particular year due to migra-
tion or death. LISA does not contain information regard-
ing job characteristics (eg, regarding full-time or part-time
employment), which could be of value for understanding
the differences between mothers and fathers. In the cur-
rent study, which is part of a project, we presented an
overall view of how childhood cancer impact parents’ in-
come and labor participation. There is considerable het-
erogeneity with regard to the severity of pediatric cancer
and associated sequelae, which is not addressed herein,
but future studies in this project will investigate the im-
pact of illness characteristics and the socioeconomic con-
ditions of bereaved parents. Further understanding of
how parents’ socioeconomic conditions vary depending
on the type of cancer, treatment (length, modality, and in-
tensity), and follow-up care could provide information re-
garding particularly vulnerable groups in need of closer
follow-up and thus should be investigated in future stud-
ies. However, this is complicated by the heterogeneity in
severity and outcome, even within diagnostic groups. In

 the current study, to identify parents at risk of greater dis-
ruption, associations with parents’ income from employ-
ment were stratified by several measures, including the
number of children living at home. To further explore the
impact of extensive caregiving responsibilities, more de-
tailed analysis of the effects on income and employment
in relation to parents’ family situation, including the ages
of the children living at home, remains a target for future
studies.
The results of the current study demonstrate that
having a child with cancer is associated with income
reductions for the parents. The association remained after
adjusting for prediagnosis sociodemographic factors.
Health care providers, policy makers, and employers
should be encouraged to pay attention to factors that
could facilitate the successful merging of work and parent-
ing responsibilities. This could include considering the
use of family-friendly work arrangements and providing
extended support from social work teams at hospitals to
help parents navigate the practical and emotional chal-
lenges after a child’s cancer diagnosis. In particular, more
support and financial assistance may be advocated for
young parents, mothers with a lower educational level,
and mothers who were born in another country. The cur-
rent study findings provide an increased understanding of
associations with parents’ employment after a child’s can-
cer that may have implications for policy in care provision
not only for the families of children with cancer but also
those of children with other chronic or serious childhood
illnesses.
