Abstract
Introduction and Aims. Cancer deaths made up 30% of all alcohol-attributable deaths in New Zealanders aged 15–79years in
2007, more than all other chronic diseases combined. We aimed to estimate alcohol-attributable cancer mortality and years of life lost
by cancer site and identify differences between Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders. Design and Methods. We applied the
World Health Organization’s comparative risk assessment methodology at the level of Māori and non-Māori subpopulations. Pro-
portions of specific alcohol-related cancers attributable to alcohol were calculated by combining alcohol consumption estimates from
representative surveys with relative risks from recent meta-analyses. These proportions were applied to both 2007 and 2012 mortality
data. Results. Alcohol consumption was responsible for 4.2% of all cancer deaths under 80years of age in 2007. An average of
10.4years of life was lost per person; 12.7years for Māori and 10.1years for non-Māori. Half of the deaths were attributable to
average consumption of <4 standard drinks per day. Breast cancer comprised 61% of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths in women,
and more than one-third of breast cancer deaths were attributable to average consumption of <2 standard drinks per day. Mortality
data from 2012 produced very similar findings. Discussion and Conclusions. Alcohol is an important and modifiable cause of
cancer. Risk of cancer increases with higher alcohol consumption, but there is no safe level of drinking. Reduction in population al-
cohol consumption would reduce cancer deaths. Additional strategies to reduce ethnic disparities in risk and outcome are needed in
New Zealand. [Connor J, Kydd R, Maclennan B, Shield K, Rehm J. Alcohol-attributable cancer deaths under 80years

Introduction
Deaths attributable to alcohol consumption have been
estimated to account for 5.9% of deaths worldwide in
2012 [1], with the burden of alcohol-attributable dis-
ease and injury in regions and countries closely related
to average adult per capita consumption of alcohol [2].
In New Zealand, per capita consumption has been rel-
atively stable over the last decade at approximately
9.2 L of pure alcohol per year [3], 150% of the global
average of 6.2 L of pure alcohol [2]. Based on the
2007 figures, 5.4% of deaths among those under
80 years of age in New Zealand have been estimated
to be attributable to alcohol [4]. Approximately 30%
of all alcohol-attributable deaths in that year were
due to cancer, with breast cancer being the leading
cause of alcohol-attributable death in New Zealand
women [4].
Despite a few studies from the early 20th century ex-
ploring the carcinogenic potential of alcohol [5], it was
in 1988 before there was sufficient evidence for the Inter-
national Agency for Research on Cancer to list alcohol as
a carcinogen for five aerodigestive cancers [6]. Estima-
tion of alcohol’s effect on cancer deaths at a global level
[1,7] has been made possible by a recent expansion in ep-
idemiological research, but public knowledge of the link
is poor, and explicit consideration in policymaking is rel-
atively recent [8,9]. This may be partly because mecha-
nisms of carcinogenicity are incompletely understood
and complex, but it is also possible that the historical ac-
ceptance of alcohol use in many cultures, despite harms
from intoxication, is a barrier to acceptance. There are a

 number of plausible biological mechanisms for alcohol’s
effect on cancer incidence that have been described, in-
cluding
direct
mutagenic
effects
of
acetaldehyde
contained in alcohol and also produced by oxidation of
alcohol for aerodigestive cancers, and interference with
oestrogen pathways in breast cancer [10–13]. It is very
likely that actions of alcohol and its metabolites are mod-
ulated by genetic factors, and that mechanisms of carci-
nogenesis vary by cancer site [7,14,15]. However, there
is compelling epidemiological evidence of an overall in-
crease in the risk of cancer with alcohol consumption [5].
The epidemiological literature on associations of alco-
hol with site-specific cancers has been comprehensively
reviewed in the last 10years [14,16,17]. In conjunction
with newer studies [5], these reviews support a causal role
of alcohol in cancers of the mouth and oropharynx, lar-
ynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and female breast.
For each cancer site, the increase in cancer risk shows a
dose–response relationship with average consumption,
and there is no convincing evidence of a threshold of ef-
fect or variation by beverage type.
Evidence is accumulating that incidence of pancreatic
cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma skin cancer is also
increased by alcohol consumption [5], although consen-
sus has not been reached about the associations being
causal. There is also good evidence that alcohol is not as-
sociated with some cancers (endometrium, bladder, kid-
ney and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and gastric
cardia) [5], and that renal cell cancer, Hodgkin’s and
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and thyroid cancer have a
small negative association with alcohol consumption
[5,18,19].
In New Zealand, as in many colonised countries, there
are marked and consistent disparities in health between
Māori, the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, and
non-indigenous New Zealanders. Approximately 15%
of the population self-identify as Māori, who are younger
overall than the non-Māori population, and socio-
economically disadvantaged on all indicators. Of particu-
lar relevance to this research, the Māori population
experiences higher cancer mortality and has a more
hazardous drinking pattern. In 2013, 19.7% of Māori
over 15 years old reported drinking heavily at least once
a week (>40 g for women or >60 g for men), compared
with 11.5% of non-Māori, after adjustment for age
structure [20].
The aim of this study was to estimate the number of
cancer deaths per year in New Zealanders under 80years
old that are attributable to alcohol consumption, by site
of cancer, and calculate the resulting years of life lost
due to those premature deaths. Because alcohol con-
sumption and health outcomes vary systematically by
sex and by ethnicity in New Zealand, we have reported
findings for men and women, and for Māori and non-
Māori separately, where,possible.
Methods
We adopted the comparative risk assessment methodol-
ogy that was developed for use in the Global Burden of
Disease (GBD) studies. In essence, it involves calculating
the proportion of each condition (in this case, type of can-
cer) attributable to the risk factor in question (in this case,
alcohol) and applying these proportions to mortality data
from the target population and time period of interest. In
this analysis, we applied the comparative risk assessment
approach to alcohol at a country level, and for Māori and
non-Māori separately, using the methods of the GBD
2010 study [21,22].
Our methods are described in detail elsewhere [23]
and are only outlined here.
The contribution of alcohol consumption to mortality
from each International Classification of Diseases—
10th revision coded cancer or group of cancers was quan-
tified with an alcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) in each
age/sex/ethnicity subgroup of the population. The AAFs
(generically known as population-attributable fractions)
used lifetime abstention as the theoretical-minimum risk
exposure and thus estimated the proportion of deaths
that would have been prevented if alcohol had never been
consumed by anyone in each defined subgroup. The
subgroup-specific AAFs were calculated by combining
alcohol consumption data from each subgroup with the
best available estimates of risk at different levels of con-
sumption, using the general formula:
AFi ¼
pi RRi � 1
ð
Þ
∑k
i¼0pi RRi � 1
ð
Þ þ 1
where
i = the average daily alcohol consumption category
(0=the referent abstainer category)
k = the number of alcohol consumption categories
AFi = population-attributable fraction for a specific
alcohol consumption category
pi = prevalence of alcohol consumption for category I
RRi = the risk of mortality at alcohol consumption
category I compared with abstainers.
For each cancer site, the overall AAF for all categories
of alcohol consumption was calculated for each age/sex/
ethnicity subgroup by summing the AFi across all alcohol
consumption
categories.
In
these
analyses,
four
consumption categories were used, which differed by
sex, as shown in Table 1.
Deaths and consequent years of life lost (YLL) from
cancer due to alcohol consumption were estimated for
all subgroups by applying the 2007 mortality AAFs to
contemporaneous cancer mortality data for 2007, as per
the usual GBD methods. To test the possible effect of
any changes in cancer mortality since 2007, we have also
J. Connor et al.
© 2016 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs
 applied the 2007 AAFs to 2012 mortality data. YLL were
calculated using the ‘remaining life expectancy method’
outlined by Mathers et al. [24], with life expectancies at
birth of 82.4years for women and 80years for men.
The selection of types of cancer to include in the analysis
was based on evidence of established epidemiological rela-
tionships using meta-analyses, new research and biological
evidence [21,22]. These were cancers of the mouth and
oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and
female breast. The age and sex-specific relative risks at dif-
ferent levels of alcohol consumption used in this study were
provided by the GBD 2010 alcohol group and based on re-
cent meta-analyses. Of note, the ‘abstainer’ reference cate-
gory used to define relative risks included only lifetime
abstainers, with ex-drinkers included as a separate alcohol
consumption category to reflect the difference in health
risks of ex-drinkers compared with lifetime abstainers [21].
We used the 2007/2008 New Zealand Alcohol and
Drug Use Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health
to estimate the distribution of average alcohol consump-
tion in 2007 up to the age of 65years [25]. Extrapolations
of consumption in older age groups also used data from
the Harm to Others survey (2008/2009) conducted by
the Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research
and Evaluation, which included older participants [26].
Details of the extrapolation methods have been published
elsewhere [23]. We did not adjust survey estimates of
consumption for under-reporting, because they covered
approximately 90% of alcohol ‘available for consump-
tion’ in 2007 according to official estimates of taxable
alcohol. In 2007, the overall per capita alcohol consump-
tion estimate calculated from the survey data was 8.3L
[23], while Statistics New Zealand reported the volume
of pure alcohol available per head of population aged
15years and over in New Zealand as 9.2 L [3].
Our analyses were restricted to people 15–79years of
age, because of concerns about data quality for both alco-
hol consumption and relative risks in older adults. Māori
and non-Māori New Zealanders were considered sepa-
rately and collectively throughout.
Results
The distribution of average daily alcohol consumption in
2007 is presented in Table 1, by age, sex and ethnicity.
The proportion of people in the highest average
consumption category was higher for men than women
in all age groups, and higher for Maori than non-Māori
in all groups apart from women 60years and older.
The alcohol-attributable fractions for specific cancers
in subgroups of the population are shown in Table 2.
Differences between Māori and non-Māori reflect differ-
ences in average alcohol consumption, while differences
between men and women incorporate both differences
in consumption and any differences in risk for men and
women at the same level of drinking.
The numbers of deaths in 2007 from these seven types
of cancer that were estimated to be attributable to alcohol
consumption are given in Table 3. In total, there were

Alcohol-attributable cancer mortality
© 2016 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs
 243 alcohol-attributable cancer deaths, meaning that
4.2% of cancer deaths would have been avoided in the
absence of alcohol consumption in the whole population.
Female breast cancer was the leading cause of alcohol-
attributable cancer death, making up 61.1% of all
alcohol-attributable cancer deaths in women, 14.0% of
total breast cancer deaths under 80years of age and
2.6% of all cancer deaths in New Zealand women under
80years of age in that year. For other cancer sites, mark-
edly fewer alcohol-attributable deaths were seen in
women than men, apart from colon cancer where the
numbers were similar. The use of more recent mortality
data from 2012 yielded similar results, with 236 cancer
deaths attributed to alcohol (4.0% of all cancer deaths)
and distribution by cancer type, sex and ethnicity also very
similar to 2007 (Table S1). In 2012, female breast cancer
made up 57.3% of all alcohol-related cancer deaths and
2.4% of all cancer deaths in women under 80years of age.
Each death from an alcohol-attributable cancer repre-
sented loss of potential years of life, and the estimate of
total YLL from these conditions in 2007 was 2536years.
The average YLL for the different cancer sites varied
from 8.5 to 13.1, the highest being due to breast cancer.
The average loss was higher in Māori than non-Māori
for all types of cancer (Table 4). In 2012, despite some
differences due to small numbers of cancers in Māori,
average YLL remained higher in Māori for all cancer
types, and overall average YLL was essentially the same
as for 2007 (12.7 in Māori and 10.3 in non-Māori). The
estimate of total YLL in 2012 was 2505years (Table S2)
The risk of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths increased
with heavier drinking, but these deaths were not limited to
very high levels of consumption (Table 5). Only 23% of
deaths occurred at average daily drinking level of 40g of al-
cohol or more, which is the equivalent of four standard
(10g) drinks a day in New Zealand, or approximately
three standard (14g) drinks in the USA. Another 26% of
deaths attributable to alcohol were estimated to have oc-
curred in ex-drinkers, and 51% of deaths were attributable
to average alcohol consumption of less than 40g per day.
Similar findings for 2012 are shown in Table S3.
The distribution of breast cancer deaths by average daily
alcohol consumption is shown in Figure 1. Over one-third
of these deaths were attributed to average consumption of

 less than 20g of alcohol per day (two standard drinks).
Similar findings for 2012 are shown in Figure S1.
Discussion
Cancer deaths made up 30% of alcohol-attributable pre-
mature deaths in New Zealand in 2007, more than all
other chronic diseases combined [4]. This amounts to
4.2% of all cancer deaths under 80years of age. There
was little gender difference in total alcohol-attributable
cancer deaths despite men drinking much more heavily
than women. This was because the breast cancer deaths
balanced the excess male cancer deaths for other cancer
sites. These premature deaths resulted in an average of
10.4years of life lost per person, 12.7years in Māori
and 10.1years in non-Māori. Just over half of the deaths
were attributable to average consumption of less than
four standard drinks per day despite the risk increasing
with drinking volume for all types. The remaining deaths
were due to heavier drinking or past drinking. Breast

Alcohol-attributable cancer mortality
© 2016 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs
 cancer was notable in that it comprised 61% of alcohol-
attributable cancer deaths in women, and more than
one-third of breast cancer deaths were attributable to
average consumption of less than two standard drinks per
day. Results were so similar when 2012 mortality data were
used; the remaining discussion will focus on 2007 results.
This study is subject to the limitations of the compo-
nents of the comparative risk assessment. The survey data
used to estimate consumption could be affected by
selection and information biases, resulting from incom-
plete response from the representative sample and
self-reporting of consumption. Relative risk estimates
come from meta-analyses of observational epidemiologi-
cal studies, which are vulnerable to information biases
and residual confounding that could affect many contrib-
uting studies in similar ways [27]. In addition, we do not
have estimates of relative risk that are specific to our
Māori and non-Māori populations and have therefore
generalised from risks measured in other populations.
In using contemporary alcohol exposure data in the
2007 analysis, we have not directly accounted for the lag
time between alcohol consumption and death from cancer.
Changes in population structure and drinking patterns
over time could mean that current drinking patterns do
not accurately reflect drinking patterns when the cancers
were developing. Relevant lag times are not well under-
stood and may vary by cancer type given that suggested
mechanisms vary, but they are often considered to be of
the order of one to three decades [28–30]. However,
New Zealand per capita consumption has not changed a
great deal in the last 25years [31], and AAFs from an ear-
lier study [32] are very similar except where evidence about
risk has been updated. Further, in the recent assessment of
alcohol-related cancer mortality in the USA by Nelson and
colleagues [33], similar attributable fractions were obtained
with contemporary consumption data (2009) and lagged
consumption data (early 1990s). In our analysis, former
drinkers were included as a distinct drinking category,
enabling the attribution of a proportion of cancers to
current abstainers who had previously been drinkers.
This study used average daily alcohol consumption as
its exposure measure and did not account for cumulative
lifetime exposure to alcohol or for the different patterns of
drinking that can result in the same average consump-
tion. Furthermore, this study did not account for any ge-
netic interactions or interactions between alcohol and
tobacco smoking. This is largely because primary studies
in the meta-analyses from which the risk estimates were
obtained lack these data [7]. For other outcomes, partic-
ularly injury or cardiovascular disease, frequency of heavy
drinking occasions can be a major determinant of risk
[21]. However, proposed biological mechanisms for the
effects of alcohol on specific cancers suggest that heavy
drinking episodes may not be very influential [7], and re-
cent evidence supports little impact of drinking pattern
on the cancer risk for light to moderate drinkers [34].
Pancreatic cancer, which was not included in our study,
may prove to be an exception to this, as there is some
evidence that binge drinking increases risk [35].
Uncertainty in AAFs is hard to quantify and usually only
achieved with Monte Carlo methodology [36], but even
this approach has limits. Uncertainty arises from the
estimation of the two components used to derive AAFs,
that is, exposure and risk relations. With regard to expo-
sure, the estimates of the current study were based on three
surveys, two of which were used for extrapolation to the
older age groups. Survey uncertainty can be estimated in
a standardised way [37], but the formula assumes random
sampling and complete response. Although they provide
the best available data on exposure, modern surveys do
not cover the full population via their sampling frames
[38,39], and they are also limited by non-response [38].
Moreover, there is measurement error in responses to sur-
vey questions on alcohol, especially because common ques-
tions try to elicit exposure over extended periods, which
requires a lot of mental integration [40]. Most of these
sources of uncertainty for exposure are not included in
usual uncertainty estimates for alcohol-attributable harm,
and to our knowledge, there is no way to include them.
Thus, we refrained from presenting uncertainty calcula-
tions in this publication. For illustrative purposes, we
present uncertainty for attributable risk in Australia, based
on survey variability assuming random sampling, but
corrected for subjective sampling errors and potential
under-reporting [41], which would amount to ±25% [42].
Global estimates of cancer mortality attributable to al-
cohol in 2012 were published recently [7]. Overall, 5.8%
of all cancer deaths were estimated to be due to alcohol
consumption, 7.8% in men and 3.3% in women. Attrib-
utable fractions varied greatly by region, but globally, this
was a major increase from the previous estimate of 3.3%
in 2002. This increase was partly due to improved
methods and inclusion of further cancer diagnoses, and
partly to increases in drinking. In a country-level study of
deaths in France due to alcohol, 12% of cancer deaths in
men and 6% of cancer deaths in women (10% overall) in
2009 were attributed to drinking [43]. The US country-
level assessment [33] found that 3.2–3.7% of all cancer
deaths in 2009 were due to drinking. The New Zealand
estimate (4.2%) lies between those of France and the
USA, reflecting differences in prevalence of abstention
and volumes consumed by drinkers. Also in the US study,
a difference in methods, where ex-drinkers were included
in the reference group along with lifetime abstainers, may
be partly responsible for the lower estimates.
In New Zealand, lung cancer is still the leading cause
of cancer mortality in both men and women. However,
the next two most common causes of cancer death are co-
lorectal cancer and breast cancer, which are both causally
linked to level of alcohol consumption. Alcohol is one of

 few modifiable risk factors identified for these cancers,
making this a public health issue of considerable
importance.
Attention to the effects of alcohol on middle aged pop-
ulations seems to be remarkably subdued given the
amount of harm that results. While there is a major focus
on the heavy drinking of young people, discussions about
older adults continue to get side-tracked by the idea that
possible cardiovascular benefits for some subgroups of
the older population [44] can ‘balance’ the risks of can-
cers, other chronic diseases, injuries and social impacts
of current drinking patterns [45]. However, cardiovascu-
lar risk reduction can be achieved in other ways [46],
while cost-effective strategies to prevent common cancers
are harder to find.
There are other messages that come from studies of al-
cohol and cancer that need clear consistent dissemina-
tion. One is the lack of any discernible threshold of
drinking under which an increased risk of cancer can be
avoided. This appears to be in conflict with drinking
guidelines
issued
by
health
authorities,
generally
interpreted as safe levels of drinking. Another important
message, illustrated in Figure 1 of this paper is that al-
though risk increases with average alcohol consumption,
a substantial proportion of cases of alcohol-related cancer
will arise in drinkers who do not drink at very high levels
[47]. This finding reflects the much larger proportion of
the population who drink at levels considered to be so-
cially acceptable, compared with those drinking at ex-
tremely high levels. While the risk of cancer per person
is not as high as in the heaviest drinkers, the total number
of cancers that results is greater.
Reducing cancer risk by decreasing alcohol consump-
tion across the population is an achievable goal, as effec-
tive strategy options exist for all levels of intervention,
from the individual to the global [48]. Our findings
strongly support the implementation of population-based
strategies because, apart from the heaviest drinkers, most
drinkers who will eventually develop cancer cannot be
identified.
Our findings also indicate that there are disparities in
risk and outcome of alcohol-related cancers for Māori
and non-Māori New Zealanders, with higher proportions
of cancer due to alcohol (AAFs) and higher average YLL
for each cancer type among Māori. Disparities in alcohol-
related cancer are likely to be reduced by broad popula-
tion strategies as they do not require any specific personal
resources to have their effect, and modelling of minimum
unit pricing in particular has shown potential to reduce
health gaps [49]. In the New Zealand context, additional
strategies to reduce harm from alcohol among Māori are
warranted given the marked disparities. In keeping with
the New Zealand Health Strategy, these would be ex-
pected to be developed by Māori or in partnership with
Māori [50].
Dissemination of knowledge about alcohol causing
cancer may increase support for population-based
strategies to reduce consumption, such as increasing
prices and reducing the availability and marketing of
alcohol. In Australia, Buykx and colleagues conducted
a large survey of adults and found that, as expected,
heavier drinkers were less likely to support evidence-
based policies to reduce harm through reduced con-
sumption. However, they also found that only 46%
of those surveyed were aware that ‘drinking too much
alcohol’ contributed to cancer, and that awareness pre-
dicted positive support for more alcohol control [51].
This suggests that more consistent messages about
moderate drinking causing cancer, particularly breast
cancer [18,47], might increase the acceptability of
population-based alcohol control measures and lower
drinking guidelines [52], even if they are ineffective
at changing drinking behaviour directly. A 2015 survey
published by Cancer Research UK found that knowl-
edge of alcohol’s contribution to cancer was extremely
low among the public in the UK, with only 13% iden-
tifying cancer as a health condition that could result
from drinking. Knowledge of the drinking guidelines
at the time was also poor [53]. However, in January
2016, the UK introduced new guidelines; reducing
the maximum consumption level to 14 units of alcohol
(112 g) a week and emphasising the link with cancer at
any drinking level [54]. Most major health organisa-
tions in New Zealand, including the New Zealand
Medical Association [55], Cancer Society of New
Zealand [56] and National Heart Foundation [57],
have adopted updated evidence-based position state-
ments on alcohol in the last 5 years. These easily acces-
sible documents, from sources that are recognised as
trustworthy,
provide
health
professionals,
non-
government organisations and the public with a reli-
able and consistent account of health harms from alco-
hol, including cancer.
Governments in high-income countries are presently
taking a low-key approach to the health burden of current
alcohol consumption that is well out of line with re-
sponses to other risks to the health of their populations
[58]. Significant progress in reducing alcohol-related
cancer requires regulatory change, and better public
and professional understanding of the nature of the
health risks of alcohol consumption will contribute to
bringing this about.
