Abstract
In the malaria parasite P. falciparum, drug resistance generally evolves first in low-transmis-
sion settings, such as Southeast Asia and South America. Resistance takes noticeably lon-
ger to appear in the high-transmission settings of sub-Saharan Africa, although it may
spread rapidly thereafter. Here, we test the hypothesis that competitive suppression of
drug-resistant parasites by drug-sensitive parasites may inhibit evolution of resistance in
high-transmission settings, where mixed-strain infections are common. We employ a cross-
scale model, which simulates within-host (infection) dynamics and between-host (transmis-
sion) dynamics of sensitive and resistant parasites for a population of humans and mosqui-
toes. Using this model, we examine the effects of transmission intensity, selection pressure,
fitness costs of resistance, and cross-reactivity between strains on the establishment and
spread of resistant parasites. We find that resistant parasites, introduced into the population
at a low frequency, are more likely to go extinct in high-transmission settings, where drug-
sensitive competitors and high levels of acquired immunity reduce the absolute fitness of
the resistant parasites. Under strong selection from antimalarial drug use, however, resis-
tance spreads faster in high-transmission settings than low-transmission ones. These con-
trasting results highlight the distinction between establishment and spread of resistance and
suggest that the former but not the latter may be inhibited in high-transmission settings. Our
results suggest that within-host competition is a key factor shaping the evolution of drug
resistance in P. falciparum.
Author summary
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has evolved resistance to most antimalarial
drugs, greatly complicating treatment and control of the disease. Curiously, although sub-
Saharan Africa accounts for the majority of the global burden of malaria, the evolution of
drug resistance in Africa has been markedly delayed compared to Asia and the Americas.
One reason might be that, in a population in which the prevalence of infection is high, a
newly emerged drug-resistant strain faces a high risk of extinction due to competition
from drug-sensitive parasites that already “occupy” most of the host population. Using a

 mathematical model, we confirm that drug-resistant parasites face a much greater risk of
extinction in a “high-transmission” setting like sub-Saharan Africa than in a “low-trans-
mission” setting like Southeast Asia. However, we also find that when drug-resistant para-
sites manage to avoid extinction, their subsequent spread may be more rapid in high-
transmission settings than in low-transmission settings, especially when selection is
strong. These results offer a novel explanation for global patterns of drug resistance evolu-
tion in malaria and suggest a new dimension to consider in resistance prevention and
containment efforts: namely, the intrinsic favorability of low- and high-transmission set-
tings for establishment and spread of drug resistance.
Introduction
Drug resistance is a recurring threat to effective treatment and control of P. falciparum
malaria. Chloroquine—a highly effective synthetic antimalarial—was used to combat malaria
on a massive scale in the 1950s; by the 1960s, resistance to chloroquine had developed in
Southeast Asia and South America, and over the next few decades, chloroquine resistance
spread to virtually every corner of the malaria-endemic world [1]. Sulfadoxine-pyrimeth-
amine, the prevailing substitute for chloroquine, was also rapidly undermined by resistance
[1]. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are now the standard treatment
for P. falciparum malaria in most countries, are in danger of widespread failure, with resistance
to artemisinin and piperaquine entrenched and spreading in Southeast Asia despite focused
containment efforts [2]. At present, ACTs are the last broadly effective antimalarial drugs left;
the prospect of widespread resistance therefore represents a looming crisis in global health.
A substantial body of evidence indicates a strong tendency for resistance to evolve in low-
transmission settings. Studies that reconstructed the evolutionary histories of resistance to
chloroquine, sulfadoxine, and pyrimethamine [3–6] found that drug-resistant parasites from
all over the world are frequently derived from just a handful of lineages. Furthermore, these
lineages disproportionately originated in low-transmission settings, especially Southeast Asia
and South America. These findings present a great puzzle: although the high-transmission set-
tings of sub-Saharan Africa account for roughly 90% of the global burden of malaria, resistance
has seldom evolved locally within Africa [7]. In at least two cases—those of resistance to chlo-
roquine and pyrimethamine—drug-resistant genotypes were carried to Africa from Southeast
Asia, after which the imported drug-resistant alleles swept across the African continent via
gene flow [4,5]. Resistance mutations must occur frequently in the high-transmission settings
of Africa but fail to be selected and spread through the population. This leads to the counterin-
tuitive conclusion that low-transmission settings are more conducive to the sustained trans-
mission of drug-resistant parasites (at least when resistance is rare)—a prerequisite for
resistance to become established in the population.
There are at least three different (and nonmutually exclusive) mechanisms that could
explain this counterintuitive pattern. The first is recombination during sexual reproduction in
the mosquito vector, which occurs more frequently in high-transmission settings [8]. Recom-
bination will tend to separate multiple mutations that contribute to a drug-resistant pheno-
type, slowing down the spread of resistance; the more loci involved, the stronger the effect will
be [9]. Thus, recombination could explain the delayed appearance of multilocus resistance
(such as for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and ACTs) in high-transmission settings [10,11].
However, recombination is unlikely to slow the spread of resistance encoded at a single locus,
such as resistance to chloroquine [4,12]. The fact that both single- and multilocus resistance

 mechanisms show similar tendencies to evolve in low-transmission settings therefore suggests
that recombination is not the primary mechanism delaying the evolution of resistance in high-
transmission settings.
The second proposed mechanism is that higher levels of acquired immunity reduce selec-
tion for resistance in high-transmission settings. Clinical immunity to malaria, which reduces
the likelihood of symptomatic infection, is thought to be acquired through years of frequent
exposure, mainly in high-transmission settings [13]. As a result, it is believed that malaria
infections are frequently asymptomatic in high-transmission settings (especially in older age
groups) but generally symptomatic in low-transmission settings and that levels of antimalarial
drug use will accordingly be higher in low-transmission settings, resulting in stronger selection
for resistance [14, 15]. However, a 2013 meta-analysis [16] found that, although there is a posi-
tive correlation between transmission intensity and asymptomatic infections, a majority of
infections are asymptomatic even in low-transmission settings, which suggests that the rela-
tionship between transmission intensity and selection for resistance is, at a minimum, weaker
than previously believed. Furthermore, historical records indicate that chloroquine resistance
spread rapidly across the African continent following its appearance in Kenya and Tanzania in
1978 [3], suggesting that the selection pressure was in fact adequate to drive rapid spread of
resistance in Africa.
Here, we address the alternative hypothesis that within-host competition between drug-
sensitive and drug-resistant parasites could inhibit the spread of resistance in high-transmis-
sion settings. Human malaria infections frequently consist of multiple parasite strains or geno-
types, with higher multiplicity of infection observed in high-transmission settings [17]. Strains
inhabiting the same host are limited by shared resources and strain-transcending immune
responses, leading to ecological competition. Within-host competition between drug-sensitive
and drug-resistant parasites has been unequivocally demonstrated in the rodent malaria para-
site P. chabaudi; in this model system, drug-sensitive parasites strongly suppress the growth of
drug-resistant parasites and reduce their transmission to the mosquito vector [18–22]. Empiri-
cal evidence strongly supports within-host competition in P. falciparum in humans as well
[23,24]. In particular, a series of cross-sectional studies across the African continent showed
that densities of chloroquine-resistant parasites were significantly reduced in children that
were coinfected with chloroquine-sensitive parasites, suggesting competitive suppression [23].
To date, few mathematical models have been developed to explore the impact of within-
host competition on the spread of drug resistance in malaria. Some of these have suggested
that within-host competition could inhibit the spread of resistance [25,26]; however, their con-
clusions were likely driven by assumptions that drug resistance carried a fitness cost that was
either contingent on or exacerbated by within-host competition. This essentially ensured that
resistant parasites were intrinsically more affected by competition than their drug-sensitive
counterparts, a finding that is not strongly supported by empirical data [23]. Thus, whether
within-host competition can explain the delayed evolution of resistance in high-transmission
settings on the basis of ecological competition alone, without invoking fitness costs of resis-
tance, remains an unanswered question.
Other models have suggested that within-host competition might actually accelerate the
spread of resistance in high-transmission settings because of a phenomenon known as “com-
petitive release.” Experiments in P. chabaudi have shown that competition between sensitive
and resistant parasites can be alleviated by antimalarial drug treatment, which removes the
sensitive parasites from the host, allowing the resistant population to expand [18]. In P. cha-
baudi, competitive release increases not only the density of resistant parasites but transmission
to mosquitoes as well [22,27]. Relatively simple models incorporating competitive release have
shown that it can increase the rate at which resistance spreads through a population [9,28],

 suggesting that drug resistance should evolve more rapidly in settings with more mixed-strain
infections—i.e., high-transmission settings. On the whole, empirical data contradict these pre-
dictions, but it is not immediately clear why. Competitive release has never been demonstrated
in P. falciparum, so it is not known with certainty that the assumptions made in these models
are valid. Alternatively, it may be that rates of antimalarial drug use are not high enough in
most circumstances for the effects of competitive release to matter, especially if other factors
tend to inhibit the spread of resistance in high-transmission settings. Curiously, although
mathematical models have examined the effects of within-host competition and competitive
release individually, no effort has been made to examine their combined effects—a significant
gap, since the two almost certainly go hand in hand.
Here, we develop a fuller understanding of how within-host competition might affect the
evolution of drug resistance in P. falciparum. We do so by considering the complex relation-
ships between transmission intensity, within-host dynamics, and the frequency of drug-resis-
tant parasites in the population (Fig 1). Transmission intensity and the frequency of resistant
parasites affect within-host dynamics indirectly by determining the occurrence of mixed-strain
infections as well as the acquisition of immunity; treatment with antimalarial drugs affects
within-host dynamics as well. Within-host dynamics then determine the transmission poten-
tial for sensitive and resistant parasites and thereby feed directly back into the frequency of
resistant parasites in the population. Thus, dynamics at the within-host and population levels
are connected by “reciprocal feedbacks” that make this question amenable to using a nested
model that explicitly describes dynamics on both levels [29].
In order to explore the effects of within-host competition on the establishment and spread
of drug resistance, we use a fully nested, individual-based model consisting of a mechanistic
model of within-host dynamics embedded into a “between-host model” that describes trans-
mission between humans and mosquitoes. The model captures the complex network of feed-
backs illustrated in Fig 1, and—unusually, even for a nested model—allows for within-host
dynamics to vary as a result of ongoing exposures and acquisition of immunity. We use this
model to explore key questions outlined above: whether within-host competition alone can
inhibit the spread of resistance, whether competitive release can accelerate the spread of resis-
tance, and how the net effect depends on the level of antimalarial drug use.

 Results
We developed a nested individual-based model consisting of a population of human hosts for
which the within-host dynamics of parasites, red blood cells (RBCs), and immune responses
are modeled using a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The parasite population is
assumed to comprise an effectively infinite variety of strains, which are phenotypically classi-
fied as either sensitive or resistant, and the dynamics of these two types are explicitly described
in the model. (We effectively assume that there are multiple strains of each type in the popula-
tion but only a single strain of each type within a given host.) Transmission between human
hosts and a mosquito population is simulated using stochastic sampling algorithms; the fre-
quency of human–mosquito contact is used as a proxy for transmission intensity.
We first give an overview of the general behavior of the within-host model and the full
nested model. We illustrate the dynamics of the within-host model for a single strain and for
two coinfecting strains; for the latter, we show how timing of infection, cross-reactivity
between strains, and fitness differences between strains can affect within-host dynamics. For
the full nested model, we show how infection prevalence, mixed-strain infections, and the
gradual acquisition of immunity are affected by transmission intensity.
We then present the results of simulations in which resistant parasites are introduced at low
frequency into populations in which drug-sensitive parasites are endemic. We examine the
fate of the resistant parasites in low- and high-transmission settings with zero, low, or high
rates of antimalarial drug treatment; we also consider how the outcomes are affected when
resistant parasites suffer a fitness cost relative to sensitive parasites. In each instance, we pres-
ent results for two different degrees of cross-reactivity between strains, because greater cross-
reactivity tends to intensify immune-mediated competition at the within-host and population
levels.
Within-host model
The within-host model accurately mimics the dynamics of parasites and immune responses
observed in P. falciparum infections. Fig 2 shows the simulated within-host dynamics of infec-
tion with a single strain, in the absence of preexisting immunity or antimalarial drugs. The
dynamics of infected RBCs (Fig 2A) are qualitatively similar to those observed in malaria-ther-
apy patients (examples shown in [30,31]), which are still one of the best sources of data on
malaria infection dynamics in naïve hosts. Gametocyte density (Fig 2B), innate immunity (Fig
2C), and acquired immunity (Fig 2D) all more or less track the dynamics of infected RBCs.
Note that gametocytes persist several weeks longer than asexual parasites, consistent with
observations from human malaria infections [32]. Acquired immunity fluctuates (a result of
the way antigenic variation is built into the model) but eventually stabilizes at a high level that
serves to reduce parasite growth in future infections.
In contrast to single-strain infections, empirical data on the dynamics of mixed-strain
malaria infections in humans are extremely limited; however, two-strain dynamics produced
by our within-host model are biologically reasonable and also consistent with observations
from the P. chabaudi model system. Fig 3 shows within-host dynamics of two strains (sensitive
and resistant), introduced either 20 or 100 days apart, with either high or low cross-reactivity
between strains (cross-reactivity is controlled by antigenic overlap, the proportion of antigens
or epitopes that are shared between strains). The resistant strain, which is introduced second,
reaches higher densities and persists longer when cross-reactivity with the sensitive strain is
small, demonstrating that cross-reactive immune responses can contribute to competition
between strains. The effect of timing can be most clearly seen in the simulations with higher
antigenic overlap. When the strains are introduced 20 days apart, the newly arrived resistant

 strain immediately goes extinct (probably due to high levels of innate immunity provoked by
the drug-sensitive strain); however, when the strains are introduced 100 days apart, the resis-
tant strain overtakes the sensitive strain because of strain-specific adaptive immune responses
that disproportionately affect the sensitive parasites. This shows the sensitivity of mixed-strain
infection dynamics to the timing of the introduction of different strains, a factor that has been
explored in the P. chabaudi model system [19] but is frequently overlooked in mathematical
models of superinfection.
Many studies have suggested that drug resistance imposes a fitness cost, with resistant para-
sites exhibiting impaired growth in vivo [23,33]. When incorporating even a modest cost of
resistance, our model suggests that such costs may be strongly exacerbated by within-host
competition. Fig 4A shows that, in single infections (without any competition between
strains), the impact of a 10% fitness cost of resistance is small; the area under the curve for the
resistant strain (total parasites produced over the entire infection) is 4.5% lower than for the
sensitive strain. In a mixed infection, however, the area under the curve for the resistant strain
is 91.4% lower than for the sensitive strain (Fig 4B).
Full nested model
The full nested model produces epidemiological patterns that are consistent with empirical
observations. First, we show how the mosquito biting rate—the parameter that determines
transmission intensity in our simulations—determines the entomological inoculation rate
(EIR; the number of infective mosquito bites per person per year). EIR was estimated for simu-
lations with four different values of b (mean number of mosquito bites per person per day).
For simulations with b = 5, b = 10, b = 15, and b = 20, respectively, the estimated EIRs are 6.1,
25.3, 47.9, and 72.6 infective bites per person per year. These values are not fixed, since EIR
depends on the total prevalence of infection in the human population, which can vary both
within and between simulations (for instance, an intervention can reduce the prevalence of
infection and consequently decrease EIR, even if the mosquito biting rate remains the same).
The exact values are less important than the fact that for a two-fold change in biting rate, EIR
more than doubles, reflecting the fact that mosquito biting rate affects not only the frequency
of contact between humans and mosquitoes but also the likelihood that any particular mos-
quito is infective, since the prevalence of infection among humans increases with transmission
intensity as well. This finding is consistent with a well-known feature of the Ross-MacDonald

 model, in which R0 is proportional to a2, where a is the rate of contact between humans and
mosquitoes [34].
Our model also reproduces the fundamental relationship between transmission intensity
and prevalence of infection. Fig 5A shows the relationship between transmission intensity
(determined by the mosquito biting rate, b) and total prevalence of infection. Prevalence
increases from approximately 70% in the lowest transmission setting (b = 5) to near 100% in
the highest transmission setting (b = 20). These results are consistent with epidemiological
observations of the relationship between transmission intensity and infection prevalence [35].
Actual estimates of malaria prevalence are significantly lower than those given by the model;
this may be attributable to the rapid host turnover in the model, as well as the limits of detec-
tion of malaria screening tools (which generally range from 1 to 100 parasites/μL).
The model also reproduces one of the key relationships outlined in Fig 1: that the frequency
of mixed-strain infections increases with transmission intensity. Fig 5B shows the relationship
between transmission intensity and the frequency of mixed-strain infections (in this context,
meaning infections with both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains). The median fre-
quency of mixed infections increases from 33% for the lowest transmission intensity (b = 5) to
93% for the highest transmission intensity (b = 20). These results are consistent with observed
correlations between transmission intensity and average multiplicity of infection (number of
strains per host) [17].
Epidemiological studies have observed that immunity to malaria is acquired over time, with
immunity developing more rapidly as transmission intensity increases; in high-transmission
settings, clinical immunity to malaria is more or less fully developed by five years of age
[13,36]. Again, our model accurately reproduces these patterns. Fig 6 shows the relationship
between age and parasite density for four different levels of transmission intensity. In all set-
tings, parasite density decreases with age, but this decrease is more rapid in higher transmis-
sion settings, consistent with empirical observations.
Simulation results
In order to understand how within-host competition affects the spread of resistant parasites at
the population level, it is helpful to first examine what happens in the absence of selection. We
ran simulations lasting 8,000 days (21.9 years), with sensitive parasites introduced at the start

transmission intensities. Data are daily measurements over a period of 2,000 days, from four independent simulations
for each value of b (e.g., each box-and-whisker represents 8,000 point measurements). Simulations were run with no
fitness differences between strains or antimalarial drug use. Box-and-whisker plots show median, interquartile range,
and maximum/minimum.

 and resistant parasites introduced after 3,000 days (8.2 years). Resistant parasites were ran-
domly introduced into 2% of human hosts, with no antimalarial drug use and no fitness cost
of resistance. We ran sets of 10 independent simulations for four conditions: low transmission
(b = 5) and high transmission (b = 15) with high cross-reactivity and low cross-reactivity
between strains. As discussed above, greater cross-reactivity tends to intensify competition
between strains.
As shown in Fig 7, the resistant parasites are able to persist longer and achieve higher preva-
lence in low-transmission settings, particularly with low cross-reactivity between strains. The
simulations continue for 5,000 days (13.7 years) after introducing the resistant parasites; the
frequency with which the resistant parasites go extinct in this time frame differs across the four
conditions tested. The resistant parasites go extinct more often in high-transmission settings
than in low-transmission settings (10 out 10 simulations for high transmission/high cross-
reactivity compared to 8 out of 10 for low transmission/high cross-reactivity, and 7 out of 10
simulations for high transmission/low cross-reactivity compared to 2 out of 10 for low trans-
mission/low cross-reactivity). The length of time that the resistant parasites persist prior to
going extinct also varies: looking only at the cases in which the resistant parasites go extinct,
the mean time to extinction is lower for high-transmission settings than for low-transmission

 settings (2.2 years for high transmission/high cross-reactivity compared to 5.8 years for low
transmission/high cross-reactivity, and 2.3 years for high transmission/low cross-reactivity
compared to 3.3 years for low transmission/low cross-reactivity).
The cumulative prevalence of the resistant parasites is also starkly different across the four
conditions tested. The total number of infection days for resistant parasites is an order of
magnitude greater in low-transmission settings compared to high-transmission settings
(Table 1). These differences in cumulative prevalence—a measure that accounts for factors
such as duration of infection, as well as force of infection and time to extinction—suggest that
low-transmission settings are more conducive to persistence and transmission of newly intro-
duced resistant parasites and may consequently offer more opportunities for the rare resistant
parasites to be selected by antimalarial treatment. In contrast, persistence of the resistant para-
sites appears to be strongly inhibited in high-transmission settings because of within-host

 competition from sensitive parasites occupying the majority of hosts. Cumulative prevalence
of the resistant strain is also an order of magnitude lower in the simulations with high cross-
reactivity between strains, compared to those with low cross-reactivity. This suggests that
immune-mediated competition, which is stronger when cross-reactivity between strains is
greater, might play an important role in limiting the persistence of newly introduced resistant
parasites.
The higher probability of extinction of resistant parasites in high-transmission settings
appears to be driven by more frequent and more severe within-host competition between sen-
sitive and resistant strains. Fig 8 shows cumulative densities of resistant parasites in hosts that
are uninfected when the resistant parasites are introduced (single infections) and in hosts that
already harbor sensitive parasites when the resistant parasites are added (mixed infections);
the proportion of infections falling into each category (single or mixed) is shown above each
box-and-whisker plot. Mixed infections occur much more frequently in high-transmission set-
tings, meaning the resistant parasites encounter competitive suppression more often than in
the low-transmission settings. Unsurprisingly, cumulative densities of the resistant parasites
are reduced in mixed infections compared to single infections; interestingly, the reduction is

host). The proportions of infections falling into each category (single and mixed) are shown above the box-and-
whisker plots. Results are shown for low transmission (b = 5) and high transmission (b = 15) with either high cross-
reactivity or low cross-reactivity between strains, and 10 independent simulations for each set of conditions;
simulations assumed no antimalarial drug use or fitness cost of resistance.

 more severe in high-transmission settings, suggesting that the higher average level of acquired
immunity in the high-transmission conditions may contribute to competitive suppression of
the newly introduced resistant parasites.
The above analyses demonstrate that within-host competition can inhibit the spread of
resistance in the absence of selection from antimalarial drugs or a fitness cost of drug resis-
tance. The next step is to consider how within-host competition might affect the spread of
resistance under selection. Antimalarial drug treatment and fitness costs of resistance, of
course, exert opposing selective pressures on resistance; the net outcome will depend on the
relative strengths of these selective forces. Fig 9 shows the results of simulations with three dif-
ferent rates of antimalarial drug use combined with three different fitness costs (one of which
is zero, in order to look at the effect of selection from antimalarial drugs alone). Results for a
slightly expanded range of parameter values are presented in S1 Fig.
Fig 9. Introduction of resistant parasites into populations with varying levels of antimalarial drug use and fitness costs of resistance. Panels A–I vary in
treatment rate (daily probability of infected host starting treatment) and fitness cost (proportional reduction in within-host growth rate for the resistant type). As in
Figs 7 and 8, each four-part panel presents results for (i) low transmission/high cross-reactivity, (ii) high transmission/high cross-reactivity, (iii) low transmission/
low cross-reactivity, and (iv) high transmission/low cross-reactivity. For all figures, solid lines and shaded areas show mean and range of 3 independent simulations
(blue, red, and black representing infections with sensitive, resistant, or both types of parasites, respectively). Note that in some panels, such as C(ii), shading for one
or more colors covers a wide area; this is generally caused by the resistant strain going extinct in some but not all of the replicate simulations.

 Panels A–C of Fig 9 show the results of simulations with no cost of resistance and varying
levels of antimalarial drug use. With the lowest rate of treatment (Fig 9A), the results are fairly
similar to those with no selection (Fig 7); in particular, the resistant parasites consistently go
extinct in the high-transmission/high-cross-reactivity setting, despite increasing in frequency
in the low-transmission/high-cross-reactivity setting. This suggests that within-host competi-
tion is able to prevent the establishment of resistance in high-transmission settings even in the
presence of positive selection. With higher rates of treatment (Fig 9B and 9C), however, resis-
tance is able to spread in all settings, but the relationship between transmission intensity and
spread of resistance flips, such that the rate of spread of resistance is higher in high-transmis-
sion settings. Taken together, these results suggest that in high-transmission settings, drug-
resistant parasites are at higher risk of extinction when rare but may actually spread more rap-
idly if selection is sufficiently strong to avoid extinction in the early stages.
Panels D–I of Fig 9 show results of simulations that include fitness costs of drug resistance
as well as antimalarial drug use. These yield three main observations. First, with a low rate of
treatment and/or a high fitness cost of resistance, the establishment of resistant parasites is
again inhibited in high-transmission settings (Fig 9D, 9E, 9G and 9H). Second, with a very
high rate of treatment, resistance spreads to fixation in both low- and high-transmission set-
tings, even in the presence of a fitness cost (S1D, S1H, S1L and S1Q Fig). Third, with treatment
rate and fitness cost both at intermediate levels, resistance is able to spread in both low- and
high-transmission settings but often fails to reach fixation (Fig 9F and 9I); this effect is particu-
larly pronounced in high-transmission settings. The stable coexistence of sensitive and resis-
tant parasites may result, in part, from exacerbation of the fitness cost of resistance in mixed-
strain infections (as shown in Fig 4), which will make the average fitness of the resistant para-
sites depend on the frequency of mixed-strain infections, as well as the rate of antimalarial
drug use.
A key result from these simulations is the fact that drug resistance often spreads (increases
in frequency) more quickly in high-transmission settings, despite being at higher risk of
extinction when rare. This could be partly attributable to the fact that the prevalence of infec-
tion is greater in high-transmission settings; thus, if equal proportions of infections are treated
in low- and high-transmission settings, a higher proportion of hosts will be treated (and there-
fore effectively unavailable to drug-sensitive parasites) in high-transmission settings. However,
the spread of resistance in high-transmission settings may also be accelerated by “competitive
release,” which refers to enhanced growth of the resistant parasite population in a host follow-
ing removal of drug-sensitive competitors by drug treatment.
Evidence for competitive release at the within-host level can be seen by comparing the post-
treatment density of resistant parasites to the density that would have been observed if the host
had gone untreated. We examined the within-host dynamics underlying spread of resistance
in low- and high-transmission settings, using model output for one simulation from Fig 9B(i)
and one from Fig 9B(ii). Fig 10 shows the distributions of resistant “gains” through competi-
tive release in treated mixed infections from each of these simulations. In most cases, the net
gains for resistant parasites are small: 77% of treated mixed infections in low-transmission set-
tings and 97% in high-transmission settings show net gains of less than 1 parasite/μL. How-
ever, a minority of treated mixed infections (approximately 9% in the low-transmission setting
and 1% in the high-transmission setting) show net gains of over 100 parasites/μL.
In high-transmission settings, the gains achieved by resistant parasites through competitive
release might be somewhat reduced due to higher levels of acquired immunity (which acts in a
more strain-specific manner than resources or innate immunity and is also slower to respond
to changes in parasite density). However, this decreased competitive release is likely offset
somewhat by the greater frequency of mixed-strain infections (roughly 28% of all infections in

 the high-transmission settings—counting only over the period during which sensitive and
resistant coexist in the population—versus 8% in the low-transmission setting). In addition,
the nonlinear relationship between gametocyte density and transmission to mosquitoes means
that the increase in fitness obtained from competitive release is not necessarily proportional to
the change in parasite density.
Discussion
One of the most compelling pieces of evidence that within-host competition could inhibit the
evolution of resistance comes from the results of simulations with no selection at all, in which
the only forces at work are ecological ones. Simulations with no antimalarial drug use and no
intrinsic fitness differences between sensitive and resistant parasites show that resistant para-
sites introduced at low frequency persist longer in a low-transmission setting than in a high-
transmission setting with otherwise identical parameters. Analysis of the within-host dynamics
in these simulations shows that, in a high-transmission setting, the newly introduced resistant
parasites almost always finds themselves in mixed-strain infections, in which they suffer from
competition with drug-sensitive parasites. As the “newcomers” in these mixed infections, the
resistant parasites suffer disproportionately from within-host competition, even though they
are not intrinsically less fit; this effect of prior residency has been observed in the P. chabaudi
model system [19]. In contrast, in low-transmission settings, the newly introduced resistant
parasites are more likely to find “unoccupied territory” in hosts without drug-sensitive com-
petitors. As a result, the resistant parasites suffer less from within-host competition and are
better able to persist in the population. Since the majority of P. falciparum infections are prob-
ably untreated at any given time [16], being able to persist in the population long enough to
experience episodes of positive selection by antimalarial drugs is likely to be a key determinant
of the evolution of resistance.
Fig 10. Net gains achieved by resistant parasites following antimalarial drug treatment of mixed (sensitive
+ resistant) infections. Using results from the simulations shown in Fig 9B(i-ii), we compared the densities of
resistant parasites at the end of every 14-day treatment window to the densities that would be expected if the same
infections had continued untreated for that 14-day period. For each treatment instance, the net gain is reported as the
density of resistant parasites after 14 days of treatment minus the density expected after 14 days without treatment.

 These results suggest that within-host competition may impede the spread of resistance
even in the absence of a fitness cost of resistance. Other theoretical studies have concluded that
within-host competition would slow the evolution of resistance in high-transmission settings,
but these results are contingent on a fitness cost of resistance being exacerbated in mixed-
strain infections [25,26]. Results from simulations with a fitness cost of resistance are consis-
tent with the idea that costs may be exacerbated in mixed infections, and this may well contrib-
ute to the impaired spread of resistance in high-transmission settings; however, fitness costs
do not appear to be intrinsic to the effects of within-host competition on the spread of resis-
tance. However, if the magnification of fitness costs in mixed-strain infections serves to pre-
vent the fixation of resistance in the parasite population, the resulting preservation of drug-
sensitive parasites could play a key role in the recovery of drug susceptibility when an antima-
larial drug is retired—a phenomenon that has been documented in numerous areas [23,37–39]
and that has raised hopes for a viable “drug cycling” strategy to manage resistance in P.
falciparum.
Across all simulations, the resistant parasites persist longer and/or spread more rapidly
with lower cross-reactivity between strains. Cross-reactivity, in this context, determines the
extent to which resistant parasites are affected by acquired immunity to sensitive parasites, and
vice versa; greater cross-reactivity therefore translates to stronger immune-mediated “apparent
competition.” The results showing that lower cross-reactivity is favorable for newly introduced
resistant parasites are consistent with the idea that within-host competition may inhibit the
spread of resistance. Furthermore, cross-reactivity is likely to be greatest for sensitive and resis-
tant strains drawn from the same local parasite population; a resistant strain imported from a
distant population may have markedly lower cross-reactivity with local drug-sensitive strains,
giving it a competitive advantage over local parasites [40]. This may favor the establishment of
imported resistant parasites in the population and facilitate their spread; this is an interesting
hypothesis to explain the spread of drug-resistant genotypes from Southeast Asia across much
of sub-Saharan Africa [4,5].
Simulations with antimalarial drug use also show resistance emerging more readily in low-
transmission settings—more readily, but not necessarily more quickly. In cases in which the
resistant parasites are able to avoid extinction, resistance actually spreads more rapidly in
high-transmission settings than in low-transmission settings with otherwise identical parame-
ters. There are two mechanisms that may contribute to this rapid spread of resistance in high-
transmission settings. The first is simply that the higher prevalence of infection in high-trans-
mission settings translates into a higher overall rate of use of antimalarial drugs, effectively
increasing the strength of selection for resistance. The second is that treatment of mixed-strain
infections results in “competitive release” of drug-resistant parasites; this occurs in both low-
and high-transmission settings but more frequently in the latter because of higher frequencies
of mixed-strain infections. In contrast to prior experimental and modeling studies [9,18,20],
we find that the gains attained through competitive release are generally modest; with weaker
drug-resistant phenotypes (such as delayed clearance in response to artemisinin-based thera-
pies), the gains are likely to be even smaller. However, with drugs that target gametocytes as
well as asexual parasites, treatment of mixed infections may enhance transmission of resistant
parasites even without large gains from competitive release, since rapid clearance of drug-sen-
sitive gametocytes will reduce competition for transmission to mosquitoes. Thus, the impact
of competitive release is likely to depend on the mode of action and degree of resistance to the
drug(s) being used.
Overall, the results presented here suggest that the relationship between transmission inten-
sity and evolution of resistance may be more nuanced than previously appreciated. This
nuance arises in the distinction between establishment of resistance and spread of resistance

 [41,42]. High-transmission settings may be less conducive to the establishment of resistance,
since the probability of extinction for newly introduced resistant parasites is higher [43]. How-
ever, the rate of spread of resistance can nevertheless be greater in high-transmission settings,
as a result of competitive release, a higher overall frequency of antimalarial drug use, or both.
These opposing findings help to reconcile previous models predicting rapid evolution of resis-
tance in high-transmission settings [9,28] with the observed tendency for resistance to evolve
in low-transmission settings. The distinction between probability of establishment and rate of
spread may be a fruitful one to explore further in models of drug resistance evolution. For
instance, although models have previously been used to explore the effects of recombination
on the spread of multilocus drug resistance, the impact of recombination on establishment of
multiple-mutant genotypes in the population, particularly in the presence of epistatic interac-
tions, may be an interesting puzzle to explore in future work.
Finally, we emphasize that this model cannot rule out the possibility that recombination,
unequal rates of antimalarial drug use, and/or fitness costs of resistance may be important
drivers of the observed relationship between transmission intensity and evolution of drug
resistance. However, our results show that the observed relationship can be qualitatively
explained without invoking any of the three. A key area in which to expand this work is con-
sideration of how these different factors might interact—for example, how the effects of
within-host competition might change when mutations at multiple loci contribute to resis-
tance. A great deal of theoretical and empirical work is still needed to quantify the relative con-
tributions of recombination, selection pressure, within-host competition, and other
mechanisms to variation in the rate of drug resistance evolution in P. falciparum.
Understanding the relationship between transmission intensity and evolution of resistance
is likely to lead to improved strategies for controlling malaria and managing drug resistance
[43]. For instance, the results presented here suggest that the fate of drug-resistant parasites
may be more sensitive to the rate of antimalarial drug use in high-transmission settings, in the
sense that strong selection might be a prerequisite for drug-resistant parasites to spread at all
in these settings. Thus, interventions such as mass drug administration (MDA) may present
different risks in low- versus high-transmission settings; although increased use of antimalarial
drugs will always increase selection for resistance, in low-transmission settings, this seems
likely to be a matter of degree, whereas in high-transmission settings, increased selection has
the potential to “tip the scales” in favor of resistance, allowing resistant parasites to establish
and spread where they otherwise would not. (It should be noted, however, that MDA is pri-
marily recommended for use in low-transmission settings in pursuit of malaria elimination.)
More broadly, reductions in malaria transmission could—paradoxically—increase opportuni-
ties for resistance to evolve, necessitating increased vigilance and/or compensatory measures
to ensure that resistance does not gain a foothold in newly “unoccupied territory” [44,45].
Knowledge of the factors that limit—or drive—the spread of resistance will aid in optimizing
control strategies for a wide range of different endemic settings [46,47].
Materials and methods
We use a nested model of parasite population dynamics: a model of within-host dynamics
embedded into another model that simulates parasite transmission between humans and mos-
quitoes. Essentially, the model tracks a population of humans, a population of mosquitoes, and
the parasites that circulate among them. Infections in mosquitoes are tracked over time, while
the dynamics of infection in each human host are modeled using ODEs. The model simulates
within-host dynamics in 24-hour increments interspersed with daily transmission of parasites
between humans and mosquitoes; any new parasites that are introduced to a human host are

 incorporated into the population of parasites tracked by the within-host model. The general
structure of the full model is illustrated in Fig 11.
The model is designed to explore questions related to the evolution of drug resistance; there-
fore, it actually describes the dynamics of two “types” of parasite: drug sensitive and drug resistant.
We assume the parasite population is comprised of a variety of strains, which are phenotypically
classified as either sensitive or resistant (in this model, resistance is absolute; we do not consider
multiple resistance mutations or different degrees of resistance—such as delayed-clearance phe-
notypes as seen with artemisinin resistance—but doing so will be an important direction for
future work). Different strains are assumed to have partial overlap in their antigens; for computa-
tional tractability, we assume that any two strains have the same degree of overlap, and the num-
ber of strains in the population is infinite. Within an individual host, all of the parasites of one
type are considered to constitute a single strain; thus, an infection with only one type is a “single-
strain infection,” while one with both types is a “mixed-strain infection”.
We now give an overview of the within-host model, the between-host (transmission) model,
and a few other important aspects. A detailed description of the model is provided in S1 Text.
Within-host model
The within-host model consists of a system of ODEs that describe the dynamics of infection
for two parasite “types” (sensitive and resistant, denoted with subscripts 1 and 2, respectively).
The dynamics of the following components are described:
• Uninfected RBCs (X)
• Infected RBCs of each type (Y1,Y2)
• Merozoites (extracellular parasites) of each type (S1,S2)
Fig 11. Overall structure of the full nested model. Parasites are continually transmitted from humans to mosquitoes
and vice versa; dynamics of infections in humans are modeled using a system of ODEs, while infections in mosquitoes
are tracked as they progress through a latent period and become infective. The within-host model tracks infection
dynamics over 24-hour intervals punctuated by daily “contact” between humans and mosquitoes, during which
transmission of parasites occurs. Once parasites are transmitted from a mosquito to a human, their population
dynamics are governed by the within-host model. ODE, ordinary differential equation.

The dynamics described by the within-host model boil down to two essential processes:
parasite replication and parasite–immune system interactions. Parasite replication is straight-
forward: merozoites invade RBCs, turning them into infected RBCs; infected RBCs either pro-
duce more merozoites or differentiate into gametocytes. RBCs are lost during this process but
are continually replaced by new ones. Interactions between parasites and the immune system

 are more complicated. The model includes two types of immunity: innate and acquired (some-
times called adaptive). Innate immunity acts in a strain-transcending manner and is important
for controlling parasite growth during the acute phase of the infection; acquired immunity is
at least partly type specific (the degree of specificity is determined by the model parameters)
and required for eventual clearance of the infection. Both innate and adaptive immune
responses are triggered by parasites, and both decay in the absence of continued stimulation;
however, the “on” and “off” rates for innate immunity are higher, resulting in a fast, self-limit-
ing response. Acquired immunity takes longer to develop but decays very slowly and helps to
limit parasite growth in subsequent infections. However, the dynamics of acquired immunity
are complicated by antigenic variation, which is discussed in more detail below.
Antigenic variation is an evolved strategy for evasion of acquired immunity. The parasite
has several dozen “variants” of an immunodominant surface protein but only expresses one
variant at a time; when the immune system learns to recognize the current variant, the parasite
switches to a different one [49,50]. Antigenic variation therefore interferes with recognition
and killing by the adaptive immune system and helps to prolong the infection, which may not
be cleared for several months (presumably when the variant repertoire has been exhausted).
Thus, antigenic variation plays a key role in the dynamics of P. falciparum infections; how-
ever, explicitly modeling the process is extremely computationally demanding. Instead, our
model implicitly incorporates antigenic variation by describing its effects on the dynamics
of infection. Each switch to a novel variant interferes with recognition by the adaptive
immune system, which makes the immune response less effective; this loss of effectiveness
is mathematically indistinguishable from a loss of immune effectors. We therefore incorpo-
rate antigenic variation as a second decay term in the equations for adaptive immunity,
which diminishes with the progress of the infection, since the variant repertoire is finite
and eventually runs out.
Between-host model
Unlike the within-host model, which is governed by deterministic equations, the between-host
model is stochastic; as a result, multiple simulations with the same parameters and starting
conditions will tend to yield similar but not identical results—unless the conditions favor
highly divergent trajectories, such as scenarios that tip either toward extinction or toward epi-
demic spread.
The between-host model describes human-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human transmis-
sion of parasites. Each human host is assigned to be bitten by a randomly chosen set of mos-
quitoes each day (the number of mosquitoes is based on the transmission intensity); these
mosquitoes can infect and/or become infected by the human host when they feed. The proba-
bility of a mosquito becoming infected is determined by the total gametocyte density in the
human host, using a gametocytemia-infectivity function originally described by Churcher and
colleagues [51]. If the mosquito is determined to be infected, the number of gametocytes of
each type picked up is determined by the individual gametocyte densities of drug-sensitive and
drug-resistant parasites. If parasites are acquired, there is a latent period (10 days in the
model) before the infection reaches the salivary glands and the mosquito becomes infective.
Mosquitoes are allowed to acquire parasites from multiple hosts (though only one host per
day); parasites acquired from different blood meals are tracked separately through the latent
period and up to the point of transmission to a human host.
An infective mosquito has a constant probability of introducing parasites to the human
host it feeds on. If this does occur, a fixed number of sporozoites is introduced; how many of
these are drug-sensitive and drug-resistant depends on the ratio of the two types in the pool of

 gametocytes the mosquito originally acquired. Once sporozoites are transmitted to the human
host, the infection goes through a latent period (i.e., the liver stage), which ends with merozo-
ites being released into the bloodstream, at which point the parasites become subject to the
within-host model.
Parasite diversity
An aspect of the model with particularly broad ramifications is the diversity of the parasite
population, particularly as it pertains to recognition by the adaptive immune system. In the
simulations presented here, we assume a complete lack of population structure: all strains in
the population, whether sensitive or resistant, are equally “related.” (However, we note that the
design of the within-host model results in competition between sensitive and resistant strains
being slightly weaker than competition between strains of the same type, particularly in hosts
that have had only a few infections. This permits stable coexistence between the strains in set-
tings in which transmission and cross-reactivity between different strains are both low—which
is not unreasonable, since some degree of linkage between resistance mutations and antigenic
loci is to be expected, particularly in low-transmission settings in which recombination rates
are low) [52].
Relatedness of different strains is governed by the parameters λ and μ, which specify the
fractions of fixed (nonvariant) and variant antigens shared by any two strains (for high cross-
reactivity, we have λ = 0.7 and μ = 0.3; for low cross-reactivity, we use λ = 0.35 and μ = 0.15).
These parameters determine cross-reactivity, or how much protection against one strain is
conferred by previous exposure to a different strain [53]. This affects how quickly immunity is
acquired: if cross-protection is minimal, then it may take many exposures to build up effective
immunity [54, 55]. Cross-reactivity also determines the severity of immune-mediated compe-
tition between sensitive and resistant parasites, which affects the ability of resistant parasites to
survive and spread in the face of competition from drug-sensitive parasites.
We note that in P. falciparum, genetic diversity is known to be greater in high-transmission
settings [8], so strains in high-transmission areas might be expected to have lower cross-reac-
tivity than strains in low-transmission regions. Thus, although it may be more straightforward
to compare simulations that differ only in transmission intensity or only in cross-reactivity
between strains, it may be important to compare high-transmission, low-cross-reactivity set-
tings with low-transmission, high-cross-reactivity ones. Therefore, we present simulation out-
puts in sets of four—high and low transmission with high and low cross-reactivity—to make
relevant comparisons while disentangling the effects of transmission intensity and cross-reac-
tivity between strains.
Antimalarial drug treatment
In the simulations presented here, antimalarial drug treatment is conditional only on the host
being infected with parasites (above the extinction threshold, a total infected RBC density
greater than 10−4). If a host is infected (and not already being treated), there is a fixed daily
probability of beginning antimalarial treatment. If started, drug treatment is maintained for a
fixed duration of 14 days, regardless of whether parasite clearance is achieved.
Simulations
Simulated populations consisted of 400 human hosts and 12,000 mosquitoes; transmission
intensity was determined by the rate of contact between humans and mosquitoes rather than
the ratio of mosquitoes to humans. Simulations were run for a total duration of 8,000 days.
Age was uniformly distributed with a maximum of 3,000 days; when hosts reached this limit,

 they were removed and replaced with naïve hosts of age zero. Drug-sensitive parasites were
introduced at an initial prevalence of 10%, and the simulation was run for 3,000 days to allow
the system to reach equilibrium before introducing drug-resistant parasites at a prevalence of
2%. Use of antimalarial drugs, when included, was initiated at the start of each simulation.
Certain parameters (human population size, starting prevalence of resistant parasites, host
lifespan) were constrained by computational demands. A larger population size would consid-
erably increase simulation run times and would not significantly change the results if the num-
ber of hosts initially infected with resistant parasites were held constant (this is because
transmission is frequency dependent rather than density dependent). A lower starting preva-
lence of resistance, or stochastic introduction of resistance, would better simulate de novo
emergence of resistance mutations; however, this would have significantly increased the num-
ber of simulations required, due to higher rates of extinction. Instead, we introduced resistant
parasites into a fixed, slightly higher number of hosts in each simulation, representing hosts
infected by a recently emerged drug-resistant mutant. Host lifespan was limited by the time
required for the simulation to reach equilibrium before introducing resistant parasites. A lon-
ger lifespan would be expected to alter the distribution of immune states in a population,
which would affect within-host dynamics (including competitive suppression and competitive
release in mixed-strain infections) as well as between-host dynamics (including infection prev-
alence and the frequency of mixed infections). However, the qualitative differences between
low- and high-transmission settings that underlie the results of our model would be expected
to hold.

larial drug use and fitness costs of resistance. Panels A–Q vary in treatment rate (daily prob-
ability of infected host starting treatment) and fitness cost (proportional reduction in within-
host growth rate for the resistant type). Each four-part panel presents results for (i) low trans-
mission/high cross-reactivity, (ii) high transmission/high cross-reactivity, (iii) low transmis-
sion/low cross-reactivity, and (iv) high transmission/low cross-reactivity. For all figures, solid
lines and shaded areas show mean and range of 3 independent simulations, respectively. (Note
that in some panels, such as C(ii), shading for one or more colors covers a wide area; this is
generally caused by the resistant strain going extinct in some but not all of the replicate simula-
tions.)
