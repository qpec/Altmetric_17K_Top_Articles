  Résumé en Français 
Incidence de pré-diabète et diabète de type 2 à l’arrêt du tabac : une étude de cohorte 
Le tabagisme est associé à un risque augmenté de développer un diabète de type 2. Arrêter 
de fumer devrait donc diminuer le risqué de diabète. Seulement, les études concernant le 
risque métabolique à l’arrêt du tabac sont discordantes.  
Par ailleurs, les effets métaboliques du tabac et de l’arrêt du tabac diffèrent probablement 
selon le sexe, avec notamment un effet différent du tabac sur la santé des femmes, et une 
prise pondérale plus importante à l’arrêt que chez les hommes. Notre étude vise à évaluer le 
risque métabolique à l’arrêt du tabac, chez les femmes et les homes séparément. 
Nous avons utilisé les données de l’étude de cohorte prospective CoLaus, qui évalue 
différents facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire chez des sujets choisis de manière aléatoire, 
dans la population Lausannoise entre 35 et 75 ans, suivis sur 5.5 ans en moyenne. Parmi 
ceux avec une glycémie à jeun normale au départ, nous avons divisé les participants en 
quatre groupes selon leur statut tabagique : non fumeurs, personnes ayant arrêté de fumer 
depuis plus de 5 ans, celles ayant arrêté depuis moins de 5 ans, et fumeurs actifs.  Nous 
avons mesuré les incidences de glycémie à jeun altérée (5.6-6.99 mmol/l) et de diabète 
(glycémie à jeun ≥ 7 mmol/l et/ou traitement pour le diabète) durant le période de suivi, 
stratifiées par sexe. Puis le risque d’incidence de glycémie altérée et de diabète a été calculé 
avec trois niveaux d’ajustement pour les facteurs confondants pour un risque métabolique. 
Nous avons inclus 3166 participants, dont 63% de femmes. Au total, 26.3% étaient fumeurs, 
6.5% ex-fumeurs depuis moins de 5 ans et 23.5% ex-fumeurs depuis plus de 5 ans. Durant 
le suivi, 1311 (41.4%) personnes ont développé une glycémie à jeun altérée (33.6% des 
femmes, 54.7% des homes), et 47 (1.5%) ont développé un diabète (1.1% des femmes, 
2.1% des hommes). Les personnes ayant arrêté de fumer n’avait pas de risque 
significativement plus élevé de développer une glycémie à jeun altérée ou un diabète que les 
fumeurs, après ajustement pour  l’âge, l’éducation, l’hypercholestérolémie, la prise d’alcool, 
l’activité physique, la prise de poids, le BMI initial et le BMI d’arrivée dans les différents 
modèles d’ajustement. L’analyse de l’interaction du sexe avec ces résultats est également 
négative.  
Les analyses de sensibilité ont montré que l’exclusion des personnes ayant changé de statut 
tabagique durant le suivi ne changeait pas ces résultats. Nous avons refait les analyses en 
incluant les participants ayant une glycémie altérée au début du suivi, mais le risque 
d’incidence de diabète n’est pas plus élevé chez les ex-fumeurs que chez les fumeurs non 
plus dans cette population. Sur demande d’un reviewer, nous avons également refait les 
analyses avec la glycémie en continue (valeurs de base et valeurs à 5.5 ans), et la glycémie 
moyenne n’était pas différente par groupe de tabagisme. 
En conclusion, dans cette population européenne d’âge moyen, avec une prévalence basse 
d’obésité et une prise de poids modérée durant le suivi, nous n’avons pas trouvé de risque 
significativement plus élevé de développer un diabète en arrêtant de fumer, et ce pour les 
deux sexes. L’arrêt du tabac doit donc être encouragé chez toutes les fumeuses et tous les 
fumeurs.

Aims: Smoking cessation has been suggested to increase the short-term risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
This study aimed at assessing the association between smoking cessation and incidence of T2DM and impaired
fasting glucose (IFG).
Methods: Data from participants in the CoLaus study, Switzerland, aged 35–75 at baseline and followed for
5.5 years were used. Participants were classified as smokers, recent (≤5 years), long-term (N5 years) quitters,
and non-smokers at baseline. Outcomes were IFG (fasting serum glucose (FSG) 5.6–6.99 mmol/l) and T2DM
(FSG ≥7.0 mmol/l and/or treatment) at follow up.
Results: 3,166 participants (63% women) had normal baseline FSG, of whom 26.7% were smokers, 6.5% recent
quitters, and 23.5% long-term quitters. During follow-up 1,311 participants (41.4%) developed IFG (33.6%
women, 54.7% men) and 47 (1.5%) developed T2DM (1.1% women, 2.1% men). Former smokers did not have
statistically significant increased odds of IFG compared with smokers after adjustment for age, education,
physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and alcohol intake, with OR of 1.29 [95% confidence
interval 0.94–1.76] for recent quitters and 1.03 [0.84–1.27] for long-term quitters. Former smokers did not have
significant increased odds of T2DM compared with smokers with multivariable-adjusted OR of 1.53 [0.58–4.00]
for recent quitters and 0.64 [0.27–1.48] for long-term quitters. Adjustment for body-mass index and
waist circumference attenuated the association between recent quitting and IFG (OR 1.07 [0.78–1.48]) and
T2DM (OR 1.28 [0.48–3.40].
Conclusion: In this middle-aged population, smoking cessation was not associated with an increased risk of IFG
or T2DM.

1. Introduction
Smoking is as an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
(Athyros, Katsiki, Doumas, Karagiannis, & Mikhailidis, 2013; Willi,
Bodenmann, Ghali, Faris, & Cornuz, 2007) and increases the risk of
micro- and macro-vascular complications (Clair, Cohen, Eichler, Selby,
& Rigotti, 2015; Eliasson, 2003; Turner et al., 1998). The increased risk
is due to different mechanisms: smoking is toxic on the pancreatic
beta cells (Hartwig et al., 2000), acts on inflammatory pathways
(Arnson, Shoenfeld, & Amital, 2010), induces oxidative stress, and
favours central obesity (Chiolero, Faeh, Paccaud, & Cornuz, 2008) and
insulin resistance (Eliasson, 2003; Facchini, Hollenbeck, Jeppesen,
Chen, & Reaven, 1992). As a consequence, to quit smoking should
reverse or at least lower this increased metabolic risk. However, the
reversible character of the pro-diabetogenic effects of smoking has
not yet been proven. Besides, smoking cessation is associated in most
cases with weight gain (Aubin, Farley, Lycett, Lahmek, & Aveyard,
2012), which is a known risk factor for T2DM. Weight gain is also an
important barrier to smoking cessation in many smokers (Luostarinen
et al., 2013).
Studies on metabolic risk after smoking cessation show contro-
versial results. A meta-analysis estimated that the risk of developing
T2DM for ex-smokers was not as high as that of smokers, but was still
23% higher relatively to non smokers (Willi et al., 2007). The incidence
of T2DM after smoking cessation has been investigated in six
prospective studies (Hur et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2013; Oba et al.,
2012; Wannamethee, Shaper, & Perry, 2001; Will, Galuska, Ford,
Mokdad, & Calle, 2001; Yeh, Duncan, Schmidt, Wang, & Brancati,
2010) and all showed an increased risk compared with never smoking
in the first years following smoking cessation.

 The development of metabolic risk goes through a continuum from
normoglycemia to impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a pre-diabetic state,
and T2DM. IFG is the key state in which life style measures are effective
to prevent disease (Orozco et al., 2008). Only few studies considered the
risk of developing impaired fasting glucose following a smoking quit
attempt and most focused on established T2DM.
Furthermore gender/sex disparities might exist concerning metabolic
risk after smoking cessation. Studies suggest that women might gain
more weight at smoking cessation (Flegal, Troiano, Pamuk, Kuczmarski,
& Campbell, 1995) and the effect of smoking on their health also differs
from men (Chiolero et al., 2008; Tanko & Christiansen, 2004).
Our study aimed at assessing whether the incidence of T2DM as
well as IFG increases after smoking cessation in a middle-aged European
population and test for an interaction with gender.
2. Subjects, material and methods
2.1. CoLaus study
Data from a Swiss prospective observational cohort study (CoLaus)
were used. The CoLaus study has been accepted by the Ethics Committee
of the Canton de Vaud. The sampling procedure of the CoLaus study has
been described previously (Firmann et al., 2008). Recruitment began in
June 2003 and ended in May 2006. The following inclusion criteria were
applied: (i) written informed consent; (ii) age 35–75 years; (iii) willingness
to take part in the examination and to have a blood sample drawn.
Participation rate was 41% and 6,733 participants (3,544 women and 3,189
men)wererecruited.Afollowupinterviewat5.5 yearswascompletedin2012.
2.2. Participants
For the present study, 5,064 participants who completed follow-up
were selected. Ninety of them (0.8%) were further excluded because
of missing data for smoking status, fasting serum glucose (FSG),
treatment for T2DM, body-mass index (BMI) or waist circumference
at baseline or follow up. Participants with T2DM (n = 278) or IFG
(n = 1530) at baseline were also excluded, leaving 3,166 participants
with FSG ≤5.6 mmol/l and no treatment for T2DM.
2.3. Variables
2.3.1. Impaired fasting glucose and T2DM
The primary outcomes were the cumulative 5.5-year incidences of
IFG and of T2DM. Serum glucose was measured at baseline and
5.5-year follow-up from blood samples drawn after an 8-hour fasting.
T2DM was defined as FSG ≥7 mmol/l or presence of an oral anti-
diabetic or insulin treatment. IFG was defined as FSG between 5.60
and 6.99 mmol/l and no treatment for T2DM.
2.3.2. Smoking status
Smoking status and years since quitting were self-reported.
Participants were categorised in four groups: current smokers if they
reported smoking ≥1 cigarette/day or ≥1 pipe or cigar/day at baseline;
recent quitters if they reported quitting smoking ≤5 years before
baseline; long-term quitters if they reported quitting N5 years before
baseline, and as never smokers otherwise. We considered pipe and cigar
smoking as equivalent to cigarette smoking because they represented a
minority of smokers (7%) and because all types of tobacco combustion
are harmful (Katsiki, Papadopoulou, Fachantidou, & Mikhailidis, 2013).
Exposure of interest was smoking cessation N 5 years or ≤ 5 years
before baseline, with smokers as the control group.
2.3.3. Other variables
BMI was calculated based on weight and height measured at
baseline. Waist circumference was measured at a level midway between
the lower rib margin and the iliac crest.
Baseline BMI (kg/m2) and weight gain during follow up (weight at
follow up minus weight at baseline in kilograms) was calculated in
women and men.
We defined participants as physically active if they exercised at
least 20 minutes of leisure time physical activity per week (Ponte
et al., 2013; Stringhini et al., 2012). Alcohol consumption was defined
as reported standard units consumed per week. High level of
education was defined as having completed at least secondary school
(N9 years of school) (Firmann et al., 2008). As participants were
included from an urban area, they were mainly with middle to high
socio-economic status. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as LDL
cholesterol ≥4⋅1 mmol/l or taking a lipid lowering treatment;
hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure N140 mmHg
and/or diastolic blood pressure N90 mmHg and/or taking an antihy-
pertensive drug treatment.
2.4. Statistical analysis
2.4.1. Basis analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata version 12⋅0 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Texas). Descriptive results were presented as
number of participants (percentage) or as mean ± standard deviation.
Between-group comparisons were performed using Student t-test for
continuous variables and Fischer's exact test for proportions.
Analyses were stratified by sex. The associations between smoking
status and incidences of IFG and T2DM were assessed separately. We
used logistic regressions to estimate the odds ratio (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of developing IFG or T2DM in recent quitters,
long-term quitters and never smokers compared with smokers. Three
levels of adjustment were performed: age only (model 1); age, education,
leisure-time physical activity, alcohol consumption, hypercholesterol-
emia, and hypertension (model 2), and all variables in model 2 plus BMI,
and waist circumference (model 3). We adjusted for waist circumference
and BMI in a separate model because they might be mediators rather
than confounders in the relationship between smoking cessation and
development of IFG or T2DM.
Finally, we tested the interaction for sex in the association between
smoking status and IFG or T2DM incidence using an interaction term in
the fully adjusted non-stratified model.
A two-sided p-value b0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
2.4.2. Sensitivity analyses
We tested whether participants with inconsistent smoking status
during the 5.5 years of follow-up influenced results. These partici-
pants (n = 343, 10.8%) were excluded, and the association between
smoking status and IFG or T2DM by smoking status was assessed in
the remaining 2823 (89.2%) participants using the fully adjusted
model (model 3). We also repeated the analyses without excluding
participants with IFG at baseline (n = 1,530, 30.8%). This was done to
test whether selecting participants with normal FSG introduced a bias
towards T2DM resistant smokers and ex-smokers.
We also adjusted the multivariate analysis to weight change
defined as weight at follow up minus weight at baseline (model 4).
Finally, in post-hoc analyses we analysed the change in glycaemia
as a continuous variable between baseline and follow up in each
smoking category by Wilcoxon Ranksum test and between categories
by Kruskall Wallis test.
3. Results
3.1. Subjects
The baseline characteristics of the participants free from IFG and
T2DM are summarized in Table 1. There were 63% of women, mean
age was 50.7 years and the majority had a high educational level.
There were 846 smokers (26.7%), 207 recent quitters (6.5%), 743
44
J. Le Boudec et al. / Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications 30 (2016) 43–48
 long-term quitters (23.5%) and 1370 never smokers (43.3%). Men
presented significantly higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors and
were more frequently current or former smokers than women.
3.2. Weight gain during follow-up
Weight gain during follow up according to smoking status can be
found in Table 2. Overall, women gained slightly less weight than men
over the 5.5 years of follow-up with a median of 1.2 kg (interquartile
range (IQR) −0.9 to 3.7) compared with 1.6 kg (IQR −0.8 to 4.2) in men
(p = 0.048).Amongwomen,recentquittersgainedthemost weightwith
a median of 1.6 kg, followed by smokers (1.5 kg), long-term quitters
(1.3 kg) and never smokers (1.1 kg). Among men, smokers gained the
most weight with a median of 2 kg, followed by never smokers (1.5 kg),
long term quitters (1.4 kg), and recent quitters (1.3 kg).
3.3. Association between smoking status and incidence of IFG or T2DM
During follow-up, 1,311 participants (41.4%) developed IFG and 47
(1.5%) T2DM. The unadjusted cumulative incidences of IFG and T2DM
according to baseline smoking status, stratified by sex are shown in
Fig. 1. Women had a lower cumulative incidence of IFG than men
(33.6% versus 54.7%, p b 0.001). Similarly women also had a lower
incidence of T2DM than men (1.1% versus 2.1%, p = 0.032).
The results of the minimal-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted
analyses of the associations between incidence of IFG or T2DM and
smoking status are summarized in Table 3. No statistically significant
association was found between smoking and the incidence of IFG or
T2DM. Former smokers did not have statistically significant increased
odds of IFG compared with smokers, with multivariable-adjusted OR,
adjusted for age, education, physical activity, hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension and alcohol intake, of 1.29 [0.94–1.76] for recent quitters
and 1.03 [0.84–1.27] for long-term quitters. Further adjustment for
body-mass index and waist circumference attenuated the association
for recent quitters (OR 1.07 [0.78–1.48]) and to a lesser extent for
long-term quitters (OR 0.96 [0.78–1.19]). Similarly, former smokers did
not have statistically significant increased odds of T2DM compared with
smokers with multivariable-adjusted OR of 1.53 [0.58–4.00] for recent
quitters and 0.64 [0.27–1.48] for long-term quitters. Further adjustment
for body-mass index and waist circumference attenuated the associa-
tion for recent quitters (OR 1.28 [0.48–3.40]). The sex × smoking status
interaction was non-significant.
3.4. Sensitivity analyses
The analyses were repeated using the fully adjusted model after
excluding participants who changed their smoking status during
follow-up:204(10.2%) womenand 139 (11.8%) men.Again,nosignificant
associationwas found betweenthe incidence of IFG or T2DM and smoking
status but the association was somewhat stronger for recent quitters
(Supplementary Table 1).
A second sensitivity analysis was performed using the fully
adjusted model 3 and including 1,530 participants with IFG at
baseline (and who initially excluded in the main analyses, total
N = 4696). Never smokers had a significantly lower likelihood of
developing T2DM compared with smokers (OR 0.67 [0.49–0.94]),
while recent quitters and long-term quitters did not have statistically
different odds of developing T2DM compared with smokers.
The adjustment for weight change between baseline and follow up
did not change the main results, as there was no significant increase in
IFG and T2DM incidence after smoking cessation when adjusted for
this factor either (Table 3, model 4).
Finally analysis of change in glycaemia between baseline and
follow-up showed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.16)
between smokers and those who had stopped smoking or never
smoked (Supplementary Table 2).
4. Discussion
In this study, we found no significant association between smoking
cessation and the incidence of IFG or T2DM. On average men were at
higher metabolic risk at baseline and also gained more weight during
follow up than women, but there was no interaction between sex and
metabolic risk after smoking cessation.
4.1. Smoking cessation and risk of T2DM
In a meta-analysis including 25 cohort studies not specifically
designed to assess the relationship between smoking cessation and
the incidence of T2DM, former smokers had on average a lower risk of
developing T2DM compared with current smokers on the long term
(Willi et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, six studies specifically designed to assess T2DM after
smoking cessation showed an increased risk in the short term after
cessation compared with never smoking (Hur et al., 2007; Luo et al.,
2013; Oba et al., 2012; Will et al., 2001; Yeh et al., 2010); Will et al.
showed an increased risk of T2DM in the first ten years after smoking

 cessation for men and in the first five years for women in a US
population (Will et al., 2001). No specific data were given regarding
weight gain. Wannamathee and colleagues reported a higher risk of
T2DM for smokers who had quit for less than five years compared
with British smokers who continued to smoke (Wannamethee et al.,
2001). In this study participants gained between 3.2 and 4.3 kg and
recent quitters gained more weight than continuing smokers and
long-term quitters (4.3 vs. 3.8 vs. 3.2 kg). In Korea, Hur et al. reported
a significantly increased risk of T2DM for men who had quit for two to
four years compared with non-smokers (Hur et al., 2007). No specific
data were given regarding weight gain. In 2010 Yeh et al. showed an
increased risk of T2DM in American men and women in the first six
years after smoking cessation compared with smokers (Yeh et al.,
2010). Recent quitters gained significantly more weight (3.8 kg)
compared to continuing smokers (0.6 kg) and longer term quitters
(1.2 kg). In Japan, Oba showed an increased risk of T2DM among male
former smokers who had quit for less than five years compared with
never smokers but former smokers who had quit for longer than five
years did not have an increased risk (Oba et al., 2012). Recent quitters
gained more weight (1.3 kg) than continuing smokers (0.2 kg) and
long-term quitters (0.2 kg). In this same study among women, the
risk of T2DM was increased to a greater extent, and for all former
smokers, even those who had quit for a longer period. A recent study,
conducted in the US among women, also showed an increased risk of

 T2DM in the first ten years after quitting (Luo et al., 2013). In this
study recent quitters gained more weight (2⋅9 kg) than all other groups
(0.3–0.5 kg). All these studies used never smokers as the reference group
and none compared directly quitters with continuing smokers. None of
these studies specifically tested the risk for IFG development.
Our study does not confirm these findings. Several hypotheses can
explain the discrepancy. First, weight gain after smoking cessation
was rather limited in our cohort particularly among recent quitters.
This may explain the lower incidence of T2DM and IFG after smoking
cessation compared with other cohorts. Surprisingly, recent quitters
did not gain more weight than the continuing smokers in our study. In
most studies described earlier, recent quitters gained more weight
over time than continuing smokers (with differences in weight gain
ranging from 0.5 to 3.2 kg) and this might in part explain the lack of
association between smoking cessation and T2DM or IFG in our study.
Second, the association between smoking cessation and T2DM
probably draws an inverse U-shaped curve (Clair & Cornuz, 2010) with
an increased risk of T2DM in the short term, followed by a decrease after
several years of abstinence. Based on the six prospective studies, it takes
between two to ten years for a former smoker to have a risk of T2DM
similar to that of someone who has never smoked. In our population,
recentquitters had quit for 2⋅6 years but former smokers wereabstinent
for 19⋅5 years on average. We might have measured the incidence of
T2DM at a moment when the risk was already decreasing, explaining
the absence of positive association for former smokers.
Another hypothesis is that the population we followed might not
be comparable to that of the other studies. Our sample was rather
homogenous, including an urban population with middle to high
socio economic status. Our population had a standard prevalence of
T2DM for Europe (5.6%), but great differences between men and
women for IFG and T2DM incidence and a low prevalence of obesity
(12%). Indeed, in Europe there is an estimated prevalence of 6% of
diabetes (in adults, type 1 and 2 together) as compared with 11.1% in
North America (Whiting, Guariguata, Weil, & Shaw, 2011), and the
prevalence of obesity in Europe is around 10–30% (Anonymous, 2010)
as compared with 34.9% in the US (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2014).
These particularities have to be taken into account, and our results
cannot be generalized to other populations.
Supplementary analyses showed that change in glycaemia was
similar in the different smoking categories. This strengthens our
results and the hypothesis that higher weight gain in quitters than in
smokers might explain the increased risk of diabetes after smoking
cessation found in other studies.
Our study speaks against an increase in metabolic risk after
smoking cessation, in an urban normal weight European setting with
overall low weight gain.
4.2. Limitations and strengths
The study has a number of limitations that need to be
acknowledged. First, since this is an observational prospective
study, associations were measured but there is no proof that they
are causal. Some potential confounders such as diet were not
included in our models. Second, variables were measured at
baseline and five-year follow-up only. Smoking habits might have
changed during this period. However we conducted a sensitivity
analysis excluding participants with inconstant smoking behaviour
over follow-up, which showed no significant influence on the
analyses. Additionally, other studies have used similar timeframes
and found valid results (Clair et al., 2013; Oba et al., 2012;
Wannamethee et al., 2001). Third, smoking status and duration of
smoking abstinence were self-reported. There might be a difference
between the actual duration of smoking abstinence and the
reported years, and we had no biological validation of smoking
abstinence. People usually remember well when they quit smoking
and self-reported smoking status is considered as trustworthy in
this kind of population (Patrick et al., 1994). Another limitation is
the exclusion of participants with pre-diabetes at baseline. We
therefore conducted another sensitivity analysis, in which we
included people with IFG at baseline. We observed a significantly
lower risk of T2DM in never smokers. We might have under-
estimated the increased risk in smokers and ex-smokers by
selecting only baseline participants with normal glycaemia. This
has to be taken into account when generalizing our results to
global population. Furthermore, the number of events is quite low
in our population, especially the incidence of new T2DM. As
observed by the large confidence intervals for the incidence of
T2DM in multivariate analysis (Table 3), lack of power might
explain the non-significant results. Finally we have used impaired
fasting glucose and not impaired glucose tolerance because only a
minority of participants had an oral glucose tolerance test.
Impaired glucose tolerance test is a better predictor for cardiovas-
cular disease than impaired fasting glucose (Nathan et al., 2007).
Several strengths deserve to be mentioned. Our study is based on
prospective data, representative of real life conditions. We used data
from an initial population of over 5,000 participants followed over a
5.5-year period and randomly selected. The sample we studied is
representative of an urban middle-aged population of European
decent. Numerous life styles, as well as anthropometric and biologic
variables, were reliably collected, allowing for an extensive adjust-
ment for potential confounders. We have especially been able to
measure fasting serum glucose levels, which is a major strength of
this study.

 5. Conclusion and implication
In an urban population of European decent, smoking cessation is not
associated with an increased risk of pre-diabetes or T2DM, compared
with smoking continuation or not smoking. Health professionals should
strongly recommend smoking cessation with focus on limiting weight
gain after quitting.
