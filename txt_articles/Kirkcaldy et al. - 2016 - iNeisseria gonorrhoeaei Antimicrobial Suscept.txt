Abstract
Problem/Condition: Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States; 350,062 gonorrhea 
cases were reported in 2014. Sexually transmitted infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae are a cause of pelvic inflammatory disease 
in women, which can lead to serious reproductive complications including tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic 
pain. Prevention of sequelae and of transmission to sexual partners relies largely on prompt detection and effective antimicrobial 
treatment. However, treatment has been compromised by the absence of routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical 
care and evolution of antimicrobial resistance to the antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea.
Period Covered: 2014.
Description of the System: The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) was established in 1986 as a sentinel surveillance 
system to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States. Each month, N. gonorrhoeae 
isolates are collected from up to the first 25 men with gonococcal urethritis attending each of the participating sexually transmitted 
disease (STD) clinics at 27 sites. The number of participating sites has varied over time (21–30 per year). Selected demographic 
and clinical data are abstracted from medical records. Isolates are tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using agar dilution at one 
of five regional laboratories.
Results: A total of 5,093 isolates were collected in 2014. Of these, 25.3% were resistant to tetracycline, 19.2% to ciprofloxacin, 
and 16.2% to penicillin (plasmid-based, chromosomal, or both). Reduced azithromycin susceptibility (Azi-RS) (defined as 
minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥2.0 µg/mL) increased from 0.6% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014. The increase occurred in 
all geographic regions, but was greatest in the Midwest, and among all categories of sex of sex partners (men who have sex with 
men [MSM], men who have sex with men and women [MSMW], and men who have sex with women [MSW]). No Azi-RS 
isolates exhibited reduced cefixime or ceftriaxone susceptibility (Cfx-RS and Cro-RS, respectively). The prevalence of Cfx-RS 
(MIC ≥0.25 µg/mL) increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 1.4% in both 2010 and 2011, decreased to 0.4% in 2013, and increased 
to 0.8% in 2014. Cro-RS (MIC ≥0.125 µg/mL) increased following a similar pattern but at lesser percentages (increased from 
0.1% in 2008 to 0.4% in 2011 and decreased to 0.1% in 2013 and 2014). The percentage of isolates resistant to tetracycline, 
ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or all three antimicrobials, was greater in isolates from MSM than from MSW.
Interpretation: This is the first report to present comprehensive surveillance data from GISP and summarize gonococcal susceptibility 
over time, as well as underscore the history and public health implications of emerging cephalosporin resistance. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility patterns vary by geographic region within the United States and by sex of sex partner. Because dual therapy with 
ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is the only recommended gonorrhea treatment, increases in azithromycin and cephalosporin MICs 
are cause for concern that resistance to these antimicrobial agents might be emerging. It is unclear whether increases in the 
percentage of isolates with Azi-RS mark the beginning of a trend. 
The percentage of isolates with elevated cefixime MICs increased 
during 2009–2010, then decreased during 2012–2013 after 
treatment recommendations were changed in 2010 to recommend 
dual therapy (with a cephalosporin and a second antibiotic) and a

Introduction
Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted pathogen that 
causes infections at the anatomic site of exposure (e.g., urethra, 
cervix, pharynx, and rectum) and in the eyes of newborn 
infants. Urethral infections often cause discharge and pain 
with urination; cervical, pharyngeal, and rectal infections 
are frequently asymptomatic. In women, gonorrhea is a 
major cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead 
to severe reproductive health complications (e.g., infertility, 
ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain). Infrequently, 
disseminated gonococcal infection can result in localized 
septic arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis (1). Infants born 
to infected mothers can acquire eye infections that lead to 
blindness. Gonococcal infections can increase the risk for sexual 
transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2).
Gonorrhea has been a nationally notifiable disease since 
1944 (3). From 1968 to 1994, gonorrhea was consistently 
the most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United 
States (4,5). Since 1995 (and with the advent of chlamydia as a 
nationally notifiable disease), gonorrhea has been consistently 
the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the 
United States; 350,062 cases were reported in 2014 (6,7). 
In 2014, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases was higher in 
the southern United States (131.4 per 100,000 population) 
than in the midwestern, western, and northeastern regions of 
the country. The reported case rate among women decreased 
from 108.0 per 100,000 population to 101.3 per 100,000 
population during 2011–2014 but beginning in 2009, the 
reported case rate among men increased from 91.0 per 100,000 
population to 120.1 per 100,000 population in 2014.
Prevention of gonorrhea sequelae and of transmission 
to sexual partners relies largely on prompt detection of 
infection and effective antimicrobial treatment. However, 
gonorrhea treatment has been compromised by the evolution 
of antimicrobial resistance to each recommended antibiotic 
agent (8).
Surveillance is critical for detecting and monitoring 
gonococcal resistance. N. gonorrhoeae culture is not routinely 
available in most clinical settings (because of the shift in 
clinical practice in the United States and other developed 
countries toward the use of nonculture-based diagnostic 
tests, such as nucleic acid amplification tests [NAATs]) and 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not routinely conducted 
in most laboratories (9). Thus, gonorrhea case reporting 
does not include reporting of antimicrobial susceptibility 
and supplemental surveillance approaches have been used. 
In the 1970s, CDC monitored antimicrobial susceptibility 
of N. gonorrhoeae through periodic large-scale surveys such 
as the National Gonorrhea Therapy Monitoring Study (10). 
In the late 1970s and 1980s, surveillance of penicillinase-
producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) was conducted by health 
departments and incorporated into case reporting to CDC 
(11). However, the approach lacked consistent sampling frames 
and methodologies (11).
This report presents data from the Gonococcal Isolate 
Surveillance Project (GISP) to describe trends in gonococcal 
antimicrobial susceptibility in the United States during 
2000–2014 and summarizes data collected during January–
December 2014. Federal agencies can use the findings in this 
report to develop national treatment recommendations and 
set research and prevention priorities. Local and state health 
departments can use GISP data to determine allocation of 
STD prevention services and resources, guide prevention 
planning, and communicate best treatment practices to health 
care providers.
higher dosage of ceftriaxone. Subsequently, the treatment recommendations were changed again in 2012 to no longer recommend 
cefixime as part of first-line therapy (leaving ceftriaxone-based dual therapy as the only recommended therapy). Despite the MIC 
decrease (i.e., trend of improved cefixime susceptibility) during 2012–2013, the increase in the number of strains with Cfx-RS 
in 2014 underscores the potential threat of cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
Public Health Action: The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria identifies prevention, rapid 
detection, and control of outbreaks of ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection as a priority for U.S. public health action. 
Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance is conducted to guide development of treatment recommendations for effective therapy 
and prevention of complications from and transmission of gonorrhea. Federal agencies can use GISP data to develop national 
treatment recommendations and set research and prevention priorities. Local and state health departments can use GISP data 
to determine allocation of STD prevention services and resources, guide prevention planning, and communicate best treatment 
practices to health care providers. Continued surveillance, appropriate treatment, development of new antibiotics, and prevention 
of transmission remain the best strategies to reduce gonorrhea incidence and morbidity.

Methods
Data Source
In 1986, CDC established the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance 
Project (GISP) as a sentinel surveillance system to monitor 
trends in N. gonorrhoeae antimicrobial susceptibilities in the 
United States (12). Data collection began in 1987. Each sentinel 
site has used a standard protocol, sampling frames, and culture-
based laboratory methods consistently since GISP’s inception. 
Urethral N. gonorrhoeae isolates and demographic and clinical 
data are collected each month from up to the first 25 men with 
gonococcal urethritis in participating STD clinics (i.e., maximum 
300 isolates per site annually) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp/
gisp-protocol-may-2016.pdf). In 2014, 27 sites participated in 
GISP (range: 21–30 sites during 1987–2014) (Table 1).
Participating Clinical Sites
State and local health departments competitively applied 
to participate in GISP as part of the funding opportunity 
Improving STD Programs Through Assessment, Assurance, 
Policy Development, and Prevention Strategies (CDC-
RFA-PS14-1402) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/foa/aapps/
ps14-1402-foa-amendment-i-final_07-08-13.pdf). In 2014, 
24 state and city health departments (comprising 27 clinic 
sites) participated in GISP (Table 2). GISP is not designed to 
be nationally representative, but rather to detect changes in 
antimicrobial susceptibility across a wide sample of geographic 
settings. Because resistant gonococcal strains, such as PPNG, 
are thought to have been imported into the United States 
from elsewhere, most often East Asia, GISP has preferentially 
included sites that are major ports of entry and transit hubs (12).
Participating Regional Laboratories
Regional laboratories applied to participate in GISP through 
a competitive application process as part of a separate funding 
opportunity (STD Laboratory-Based Surveillance and 
Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project [CDC-RFA-PS14-1401]) 
(http://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp/foa-8-2013.htm). In 2014, the 
five participating laboratories were located at Emory University 
(Atlanta, Georgia); Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, 
Maryland); Texas Department of State Health Services (Austin, 
Texas); University of Alabama at Birmingham; and University 
of Washington (Seattle, Washington).
Data and Specimen Collection
Sampling of urethral N. gonorrhoeae isolates with a 
paired clinical and sexual history allows for monitoring of 
antimicrobial susceptibility in isolates from men stratified by 
sex of sex partners and other epidemiological characteristics. 
Urethral infections in men are more likely to be symptomatic 
(prompting health care–seeking behavior) than genitourinary 
infections in women and also might be presumptively 
identified by Gram stain;* thus, sampling of urethral infections 
in men is an efficient means to detect gonococcal infection. 
Consistent sampling minimizes potential confounding by 
changes in screening or testing practices, as well as changes 
in population samples, thus allowing for reliable analyses of 
antimicrobial susceptibility trends.
* Per CDC’s 2014 STD laboratory guidelines, Gram stains of endocervical 
specimens or pharyngeal or rectal specimens are not considered sufficient to 
detect gonococcal infection and therefore are not recommended.

Antimicrobial susceptibility in isolates from MSW has 
been demonstrated to be a reliable proxy of antimicrobial 
susceptibility in isolates from women (13,14). In addition, 
population-level susceptibility of urethral isolates from MSM 
has been similar to that of population-level susceptibility of 
pharyngeal and rectal isolates from this population (15).
Presumptive identification of N. gonorrhoeae is based on 
growth of typical-appearing colonies on Thayer-Martin 
selective media incubated at 95.0°–97.7°F (35.0°–36.5°C) in 
5.0% CO2, a positive oxidase test, and the observation of gram-
negative diplococci in stained smears. Gonococcal isolates 
are then subcultured from the selective primary medium to 
chocolate agar with 1.0% IsoVitaleX (Becton, Dickinson and 
Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) noninhibitory media 
to obtain a pure colony of the isolate. After 18–20 hours of 
incubation, growth from the pure culture is suspended heavily 
in trypticase soy broth containing 20.0% (v/v) glycerol and 
immediately frozen to -94.0°F (-70.0°C). Frozen isolates 
are shipped monthly to the assigned regional laboratory for 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Demographic and clinical data are abstracted from medical 
records by clinic staff and submitted each month using 
an electronic web-based application provided by CDC. 
Abstracted information includes age, race/ethnicity, sex, 
sex of sex partners,† previous diagnoses of gonorrhea, HIV 
status, selected behavioral characteristics including recent 
travel, and antimicrobial gonorrhea treatment. Clinical 
outcome is not collected for GISP
. De-identified data are 
transmitted to CDC through a secure data portal. Jurisdictions 
are required to uphold the CDC National Center for HIV/
AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention’s Data 
Security and Confidentiality Guidelines for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, 
Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis Programs 
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/programintegration/docs/
pcsidatasecurityguidelines.pdf). The GISP protocol has been 
reviewed periodically by the CDC Human Research Protection 
Office and deemed to be a surveillance and disease control 
activity and not to be human subject research (most recent 
review, May 2016).
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
Regional laboratories determine β-lactamase production and 
antimicrobial susceptibilities of all submitted isolates according 
to a standard protocol. In 2014, antimicrobial susceptibilities 
to azithromycin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, 
spectinomycin, and tetracycline were determined for each 
isolate by the agar dilution procedure on Difco GC medium 
base (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New 
Jersey) inoculated with 104 colony forming units. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility results are reported as minimum inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs), which are the lowest antimicrobial 
concentrations that inhibit visible growth of a microorganism 
in the laboratory. As MICs increase, organisms can grow at 
higher antimicrobial concentrations, providing early warning 
of potentially impending resistance. Results are transmitted 
monthly to CDC through a secure data portal. Results are 
also transmitted to the clinical sites, but because the results are 
available approximately 2–3 months after specimen collection, 
results are not used to guide clinical management. For quality 
assurance, regional laboratories include a set of seven control 
strains with each testing run. Control strain results must be 
within a defined MIC range for the run to be valid. In addition, 
the regional laboratories participate in biannual external quality 
assessments that include antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 
a set of 15 blinded cultures provided by CDC.

Specimen Repository
GISP isolates that meet specific criteria are archived in the 
CDC/ATSDR Specimen Packaging, Inventory and Repository 
(CASPIR). Isolates from GISP are included in the Food 
and Drug Administration–CDC Antimicrobial Resistance 
Isolate Bank (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-
bank/index.html), which is available to support and advance 
development of diagnostic devices and antimicrobials.
Data Analysis
To minimize overrepresentation of individual geographic 
sites, the number of isolates in the analytic data set is limited 
to 300 per site each year. All numbers and percentages in 
this report are unweighted. Men were categorized by sex 
of sex partner as MSM, MSMW, or MSW. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility trends are stratified by census region and sex of 
sex partners and are interpreted according to criteria established 
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) when 
such criteria are available (16). For antibiotics for which CLSI 
has not established resistance criteria (i.e., cefixime, ceftriaxone, 
and azithromycin), the surveillance definition of reduced 
susceptibility is applied to isolates with MICs higher than 
wild-type distributions (cefixime MIC ≥0.25 µg/mL [Cfx-RS], 
ceftriaxone MIC ≥0.125 µg/mL [Cro-RS], and azithromycin 
MIC ≥2.0 µg/mL [Azi-RS]). Treatment outcome data from 
Toronto, Canada, suggest that the surveillance case definition 
for Cfx-RS correlates well with unsuccessful treatment (17). In 
2005, the GISP surveillance definition of Azi-RS was changed 
from ≥1.0 µg/mL to ≥2.0 µg/mL. Descriptive analyses of 
annual prevalences of resistance phenotypes were performed. 
Bivariate analyses of epidemiological characteristics were 
conducted by chi-square, with significance level of p<0.05.
Results
During 2000–2014, a total of 86,517 isolates were submitted 
(annual median: 5,693; range: 5,093–6,552), including 
5,093 isolates submitted from 27 sites in 2014 (Table 1). In 
2014, 40.0% of the isolates were collected in the West and 
approximately 25.0% in the Midwest (Table 2). The West is 
relatively overrepresented when accounting for the proportion 
of reported gonorrhea cases among men (40.0% of GISP 
isolates and 24.9% of reported cases in 2014), and the South 
is relatively underrepresented (23.4% of GISP isolates versus 
41.4% of reported cases in 2014) (7). The median age of men 
from whom isolates were collected was 28 years (interquartile 
range [Q3–Q1]: 23–36 years). The majority of participants 
were black; the racial/ethnic composition of GISP participants 
approximates that of reported gonorrhea cases among men in 
the United States (7).
In 2014, associated sex of sex partner data were available for 
5,032 isolates (98.8% of total); 37.1% of the isolates were from 
MSM or MSMW. This percentage increased from 13.9% in 
2000 and coincides with increases during 2009–2014 in reported 
gonorrhea case rates among men in the United States (7). In 
2014, HIV co-infection and recent antibiotic use were more 
often reported by MSM and MSMW than MSW (Table 3).
During 2000–2014, treatment data were submitted for 
98.6% of isolates; data were submitted for 99.3% in 2014. The 
percentage of isolates with treatment recorded as ceftriaxone 
250 mg as a single intramuscular dose increased from 10.0% in 
2005 to 94.3% in 2014 (Figure 1) and coincided with changes 
in STD treatment guidelines (18,19). Among men treated 
with ceftriaxone 250 mg in 2014, 96.4% were co-treated with 
azithromycin, 2.2% with doxycycline, and 0.1% with another 
antibiotic; 1.3% were not treated with a second antibiotic. 
Those not treated with ceftriaxone 250 mg were treated with 
ceftriaxone 125 mg, ciprofloxacin, cefixime, or levofloxacin 
(all <1.0%), or a study drug as part of a clinical trial (2.9%). 
The percentage of men treated with azithromycin 2 g as 
monotherapy ranged from 0.04% in 2000 to 3.2% in 2012; 
in 2014 the percentage was 1.9%.
Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Azithromycin
The percentage of Azi-RS isolates remained low during 
2000–2013 but increased from 0.6% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014 
(Figure 2), representing the highest prevalence since 1992 
when GISP began testing for azithromycin susceptibility. The 
increase during 2013–2014 was observed in all regions, but 
was greatest in the Midwest (Figure 3). In 2014, the largest 
numbers of Azi-RS isolates per site were collected in Minnesota 
(23), Texas (11), and Arizona (10). When stratified by sex of 
sex partner, the percentage of Azi-RS isolates increased in 2004 
among MSM and MSMW, then decreased (Figure 4). During 
2013–2014, the percentage increased among all categories 
of sex of sex partner: MSW (0.4% to 1.4%), MSM (0.9% 
to 4.3%), and MSMW (1.4% to 3.2%) (Figure 4). Of men 
whose isolates exhibited Azi-RS in 2014 and for whom data 
were available (96.8%), 45.2% were white, 35.5% were 
black, 57.4% were MSM, 36.1% were MSW, and 6.6% were 
MSMW. In addition, 21.0% reported recent travel (versus 
8.7% of men with azithromycin-susceptible isolates, p<0.001) 
and 14.4% reported recent antibiotic use (versus 7.8% of men 
with azithromycin-susceptible isolates, p = 0.016).

Ten isolates with high-level azithromycin MIC (≥16.0 µg/mL) 
were identified in 2014. Of the seven with MIC = 16.0 µg/mL, 
three were from the West (two MSM and one MSMW), three 
were from the Northeast (all MSW), and one was from the 
Midwest (MSM). One isolate had MIC = 32.0 µg/mL (MSM 
in the West), one had MIC = 64.0 µg/mL (MSM in the West), 
and one had MIC ≥256.0 µg/mL (MSM in the West).
Cefixime and Ceftriaxone
The percentage of Cfx-RS isolates (MIC ≥0.25 µg/mL) 
increased from 2006 (0.1%) to 2010 (1.4%), decreased to 
0.4% in 2013, and then increased to 0.8% in 2014 (Figure 2). 
Isolates from the West were more likely to be Cfx-RS than 
those from the Northeast, Midwest, or South (Figure 5). The 
majority of Cfx-RS isolates collected in 2014 were identified 
in Arizona (eight), California (seven), and Hawaii (six); 
however, at least three Cfx-RS isolates were identified in each 
U.S. region. Since 2004, Cfx-RS prevalence has been higher in 
isolates from MSM or MSMW than MSW (Figure 6). In 2014, 
the percentage of Cfx-RS isolates was 1.3% among MSM, 
1.2% among MSMW, and 0.4% among MSW (Figure 6).
In combination with azithromycin, ceftriaxone is 
recommended for gonorrhea treatment (20). During 2000–
2014, the percentage of Cro-RS (MIC ≥0.125 µg/mL) isolates 
ranged from 0.1% to 0.4% (Figure 7). In 2014, the percentage 
was 0.4% in the Northeast, 0.2% in the West, and 0.1% in the 
South and Midwest (Figure 7). Since 2002, Cro-RS prevalence 
has been higher in isolates from MSM or MSMW than from 
MSW (Figure 8). In 2014, the percentage of Cro-RS isolates 
was 0.4% among MSMW, 0.2% among MSM, and 0.1% 
among MSW. Among the seven Cro-RS isolates in 2014, 
five had MIC = 0.125 µg/mL (three MSW in the South,

had MIC = 0.25 µg/mL (one MSM in the Northeast and one 
MSMW in the West).
Ciprofloxacin
GISP measures ciprofloxacin susceptibility to monitor 
fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG). During 
the 2000s, prevalence of QRNG strains increased in the 
United States (Figure 2), emerging in the western United States 
(Hawaii and then California), soon after among MSM, and 
then among MSW. In response, CDC adjusted treatment 
guidelines and no longer recommended use of fluoroquinolones 
in each affected location or population (21–23). In 2007, CDC 
no longer recommended use of fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea 
treatment for any patient in the United States (24). The 
percentage of QRNG isolates decreased from 14.8% in 2007 to 
9.6% in 2009 (Figure 2) and then increased; by 2014, 19.2% 
of isolates exhibited QRNG, the highest prevalence observed 
in GISP since testing for ciprofloxacin susceptibility began 
in 1990. In 2014, QRNG strains were identified in 27.3% 
of isolates from the West, 21.4% from the Northeast, 14.3% 
from the South, and 10.2% from the Midwest (Figure 9); 
QRNG strains were identified in approximately 30.0% of 
isolates from MSM and MSMW and 12.7% of isolates from 
MSW (Figure 10).
Penicillin
Since 1989, penicillin has not been recommended for 
gonorrhea treatment because of high prevalence of resistance; 
penicillin resistance remains common (25). In 2014, a total of 
826 (16.2%) isolates exhibited penicillin resistance alone or in 
combination with other resistance phenotypes (Figure 2). Of 
these isolates, 477 (57.8%) exhibited chromosomal resistance 
(MIC ≥2.0 µg/mL without β-lactamase) and 349 (42.2%) 
exhibited plasmid-based resistance (presence of β-lactamase). 
The percentage of isolates with penicillin resistance was high 
in all regions (Northeast [25.6%], West [17.4%], Midwest 
[13.3%], and Southeast [13.2%]). Penicillin resistance was 
common in isolates from MSM (22.1%), MSMW (21.9%), 
and MSW (12.5%).
Tetracycline
In 2014, a total of 1,287 (25.3%) isolates exhibited 
tetracycline resistance, either alone or in combination with 
other resistance phenotypes (Figure 2). The prevalence of 
tetracycline resistance was high in all regions (West [33.5%],

Northeast [25.8%], South [19.6%], and Midwest [17.6%]). 
Tetracycline resistance was common in isolates from MSM 
(38.0%), MSMW (31.5%), and MSW (18.2%).
Multidrug Resistance
In 2014, a total of 1,946 (38.2%) of all isolates collected 
in GISP exhibited resistance (to penicillin, tetracycline, 
or ciprofloxacin) or reduced susceptibility (to cefixime, 
ceftriaxone, or azithromycin, for which CLSI has not yet 
established resistance breakpoints) (16) (Figure 11). Resistance 
or reduced susceptibility to one antibiotic was identified in 
20.8% of isolates, to two in 9.6%, to three in 7.2%, to four 
in 0.5%, and to five in 0.1%.
Among 125 Azi-RS isolates, 48.8% were resistant to 
tetracycline, 22.4% to penicillin, and 8.8% to ciprofloxacin; 
none exhibited Cfx-RS or Cro-RS. Among 38 Cfx-RS isolates, 
92.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 76.3% to tetracycline, 
and 71.1% to penicillin. All seven Cro-RS isolates were 
resistant to penicillin; 85.7% were resistant to tetracycline and 
ciprofloxacin. No Cfx-RS or Cro-RS isolates exhibited Azi-RS.
Spectinomycin
Since 2000, no isolates collected in GISP have exhibited 
spectinomycin resistance. U.S. distribution of spectinomycin 
was discontinued in 2005 (26). 
Discussion
This is the first report to present comprehensive surveillance 
data from GISP and summarize gonococcal susceptibility 
over time, as well as underscore the history and public health 
implications of emerging cephalosporin resistance. Before 
GISP
, monitoring of gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility 
was conducted periodically through large-scale surveys and 
later was limited primarily to detection of PPNG, identified by 
simple and inexpensive assays for β-lactamase (10,11). However,

¶ In 2010, CDC revised its gonorrhea treatment guidelines to recommend dual therapy with a cephalosporin (either ceftriaxone [preferred] or cefixime) and a second 
antimicrobial (azithromycin or doxycycline) and to increase the recommended dosage of ceftriaxone to 250 mg. In 2012, CDC again revised its gonorrhea treatment 
guidelines to no longer recommend cefixime and to recommend only ceftriaxone-based dual therapy for gonorrhea treatment.

many public health laboratories lacked the resources to conduct 
susceptibility testing other than β-lactamase testing and to detect 
chromosomal resistance; such testing is more expensive and 
technically demanding (27). GISP was established in 1986 to 
address those challenges and to provide a scientific rationale for 
changes in gonorrhea treatment guidelines.
Data from GISP repeatedly have led to revisions to national 
guidelines for gonorrhea treatment, including the 2015 STD 
treatment guidelines (20). GISP has allowed CDC to continue 
to monitor gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility despite 
decreasing use of cultures in clinical practice. Following the 
emergence of N. gonorrhoeae resistance to numerous antibiotics, 
and with decreasing susceptibility of the pathogen to cefixime 
(an oral cephalosporin), the primary gonorrhea treatment 
option recommended by CDC is dual therapy combining 
ceftriaxone (an injectable cephalosporin) and an oral dose of 
azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) (20). Monitoring of 
cephalosporin and azithromycin susceptibility is particularly 
important to ensure the effectiveness of the recommended 
treatment option. Data from GISP will remain important for 
monitoring effectiveness of potential treatment options and 
for success of the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-
Resistant Bacteria (28).
Azithromycin Susceptibility Trends
Dual therapy with ceftriaxone, an injectable cephalosporin, 
and azithromycin, an oral macrolide, is the only recommended 
gonorrhea treatment in the United States (20). The recent 
increase in Azi-RS prevalence, just 5 years after cephalosporin 
MICs began to increase among isolates collected in GISP
, 
highlights the potential for development of resistance to 
the only currently recommended antimicrobial agents. The 
increase in Azi-RS prevalence was greatest in the Midwest 
but occurred in all geographic regions. Azi-RS prevalence 
increased among MSM, who traditionally have experienced a 
disproportionate number of resistant N. gonorrhoeae infections 
(23,29,30), but also among MSW.
N. gonorrhoeae Azi-RS is associated with mutations in the 
mtrR coding region, conferring overexpression of an efflux 
pump, and mutations in at least one of the four (but usually two 
or greater) alleles encoding the 23S ribosomal subunit, causing

decreased antimicrobial affinity (31–35). It is unclear whether 
circulating gonococcal strains in the United States acquired 
these mutations through domestic selection pressure or whether 
Azi-RS strains were introduced through importation from 
other countries, as might have occurred with PPNG, QRNG, 
and Cfx-RS, and spread clonally (11,36,37).
The epidemiology of Azi-RS differs from other resistance 
phenotypes and might suggest a potential role for domestic 
selection pressure. Other resistance phenotypes emerged 
in Hawaii and then California (likely because of relative 
proximity to East Asia) before spreading eastward. In contrast, 
azithromycin MICs have tended to be higher in isolates from 
the Midwest than from other regions (38); therefore, it is 
not surprising that in 2014, the Midwest had the greatest 
proportion of Azi-RS isolates. Selection pressure might be 
exerted by the high frequency with which azithromycin is 
prescribed in the United States for nonsexually transmitted 
illnesses, such as respiratory infections (39,40). The 
recommended dual-therapy regimen for gonorrhea treatment 
is not a likely contributor to increases in Azi-RS. Azithromycin 
has been recommended for use in gonorrhea treatment (to treat 
chlamydia co-infection) since 1998 (41) without increases 
in Azi-RS prevalence. Recent studies have not indicated 
antagonist effects between ceftriaxone and azithromycin 
(42,43). However, gonorrhea treatment with azithromycin 
monotherapy could conceivably select for Azi-RS; in a recently 
described case, higher azithromycin MIC was exhibited after 
unsuccessful treatment with azithromycin monotherapy (34). 
During 2000–2012, a small increase in use of azithromycin 
alone for gonorrhea treatment was observed in STD clinics 
participating in GISP
. Data on gonorrhea treatment outside 
of STD clinics are limited.
Several countries have reported isolates with Azi-RS and 
increasing azithromycin MICs, which supports the idea of 
importation of Azi-RS strains into the United States and 
subsequent clonal spread (44–47). Such reports heighten 
concerns about whether a trend toward increased Azi-RS is 
beginning in the United States, which could compromise 
successful gonorrhea treatment. Not only is azithromycin part 
of currently recommended dual therapy, it is also a component 
of each of the alternative treatment regimens for gonorrhea 
(20). Azithromycin monotherapy is not recommended for

gonorrhea treatment; clinicians are strongly encouraged to 
avoid its use to reduce potential for selection pressure and 
ensure treatment effectiveness.
Cephalosporin Susceptibility Trends
Concern is growing about potential for cephalosporin 
resistance. Higher oral cephalosporin (e.g., cefixime) MICs 
and cases of unsuccessful treatment with oral cephalosporins 
have been identified in multiple countries. Since 2009, 
ceftriaxone-resistant strains have been identified in Japan, 
Spain, and France (48–50). In response to these developments, 
CDC revised its gonorrhea treatment guidelines in 2010 to 
recommend 1) dual therapy with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 
[preferred] or cefixime) plus either azithromycin or doxycycline 
for gonorrhea treatment and 2) a higher dosage of ceftriaxone 
(18). Subsequently, increasing cefixime MICs were observed in 
GISP (19). Anticipating that increasing cefixime MICs would 
result in declining effectiveness of cefixime and that in turn, 
continued use of cefixime might hasten the development of 
resistance to ceftriaxone, CDC revised its guidelines again in 
2012 to no longer recommend cefixime as part of dual therapy; 
ceftriaxone-based dual therapy was the only recommended 
therapy (19). Subsequent decreases in the proportion of 
Cfx-RS isolates suggested an association between changes in 
treatment guidelines and circulation of fewer clinical strains 
with reduced susceptibility. Although other countries observed 
similar trends, only some had changed treatment guidance to 
ceftriaxone-based dual therapy. Other factors (e.g., reduced 
transmission of a clonal lineage) might have contributed to 
decreasing prevalence (35,51–59). On the basis of historical 
precedent, such as patterns observed with QRNG strains, 
recent cephalosporin susceptibility data from Australia and 
Europe, and 2014 GISP data, improvement in cefixime 
susceptibility might be short lived (24,54,60).
N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States remain highly 
susceptible to ceftriaxone, perhaps because additional mutations 
(beyond those required for Cfx-RS) seem to be required to 
confer Cro-RS (48–50). Although not yet documented, it is also 
conceivable that such mutations confer fitness costs (i.e., acquired 
mutations that confer resistance might impair the virulence, 
transmissibility, or infectivity of the bacteria), as the spread of 
the ceftriaxone-resistant strains appears to be limited (61,62).

organisms to varying concentrations of antimicrobial agents. 
However, laboratories’ widespread adoption of molecular-
based diagnostic tests that do not yield live organisms, such 
as NAATs, has led to a marked decrease in use of and capacity 
to perform culture testing and N. gonorrhoeae antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing in the United States (9). In comparison 
to culture, NAATs are more sensitive and specific, can be 
performed on less invasively collected specimens (e.g., urine 
and self-collected vaginal swabs), and have far less burdensome 
specimen handling requirements (63).
The limited amount of antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
conducted outside of GISP also precludes use of electronic 
health records as a data source for surveillance of gonococcal 
antimicrobial susceptibility. The potential for cephalosporin and 
azithromycin resistance with limited antimicrobial treatment 
options underscores the importance of GISP data (64). Beyond 
the recommended dual-therapy regimen, no other antibiotics 
are available to treat gonorrhea effectively with a high level of 
efficacy at all anatomic sites of infection, a favorable side-effect 
profile, low cost, and ease of administration.
The strengths of GISP surveillance include nonrandom, 
systematic sampling and consistent methodology. Systematic 
Gonorrhea Treatment Recommendations
CDC recommends that gonococcal infections be treated 
with ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular dose and 
azithromycin 1 g orally (20). The combination regimen is thought 
to have a synergistic effect that enhances killing of N. gonorrhoeae 
resistant to one of the antimicrobials and minimizes potential 
for transmission of resistant strains. Furthermore, Cfx-RS and 
Cro-RS isolates are susceptible to azithromycin and vice versa. If 
a pathogen harbors reduced susceptibility to one antibiotic, the 
second antibiotic is expected to cure the infection. Patients with 
cephalosporin allergies should be treated with azithromycin 2 g 
plus either gentamicin or gemifloxacin (20).
Monitoring Antimicrobial Susceptibility
GISP is the only source of national and regional gonococcal 
antimicrobial susceptibility data in the United States. Since 
1986, GISP has provided data to guide gonorrhea treatment 
recommendations and address the threat of antimicrobial 
resistance while monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility. 
Culture-based methods are necessary for N. gonorrhoeae 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, which exposes live

sampling of consecutive symptomatic men minimizes selection 
bias and provides a robust estimate of gonococcal susceptibility at 
each sentinel clinic. Consistent methodology minimizes potential 
confounding by changes in screening or testing practices, 
population samples, or laboratory practice over time, thus 
allowing for reliable analyses of antimicrobial susceptibility trends.
By design, GISP does not collect a representative sample of 
gonococcal strains from men throughout the United States. 
Rather, by relatively oversampling from the western United 
States (where resistance tends to emerge), GISP functions as a 
truly sentinel system and is able to more rapidly detect trends. 
STD specialty care clinics, particularly those that participate in 
GISP
, maintain culture capacity and thus are able to provide a 
sufficient number of isolates for surveillance. Most gonorrhea 
cases in the United States are identified in settings other 
than STD clinics (7), but gonococcal infections usually are 
asymptomatic and often are distributed across multiple health 
care settings. Compared with other health care facilities, STD 
clinics still tend to diagnose a disproportionate number of 
gonococcal infections among men.
Data from GISP repeatedly have been used to 
develop CDC’s STD treatment guidelines for gonorrhea 
(18–20,23,24,41,65–68). These guidelines have a direct 
influence on health care–provider prescribing practices (69,70). 
GISP data indicate that health care providers in state and 
locally funded STD clinics tend to adopt changes in treatment 
guidelines quickly. For example, the percentage of patients 
treated with ceftriaxone 250 mg increased substantially following 
release of 2010 STD treatment guidelines. CDC’s guidelines 
also influence gonorrhea treatment in non–STD clinic settings, 
although adoption of new recommendations in these facilities 
tends to be slower (69).
GISP monitors N. gonorrhoeae antimicrobial susceptibility 
trends in the United States. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) conducts global surveillance of gonococcal 
antimicrobial susceptibility through the Gonococcal 
Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (GASP), which 
is operated by regional coordinating centers in nearly all 
WHO regions. GASP collaborates with GISP and other 
national surveillance programs, such as United Kingdom’s

Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance System 
(GRASP) and Australia’s Gonococcal Surveillance Programme 
(51–54). Although interpretation of data sometimes is limited 
by convenience sampling designs and lack of associated 
epidemiologic data in some countries, GASP and other 
international surveillance programs provide critical data on 
global transmission of resistant strains.
Limitations
The findings provided in this report are subject to at least 
four limitations. First, only men with urethral gonorrhea 
diagnosed in participating STD clinics are included, so 
epidemiologic characteristics of men in GISP are not expected 
to reflect those of all persons with gonorrhea diagnosed in 
the United States. Second, reported treatment data reflect 
prescribing practices in specialty STD clinics and are not 
expected to reflect gonorrhea treatment practices in private 
clinical settings and other non-STD clinic health care settings, 
where most gonorrhea is diagnosed in the United States 
(7). Third, although relative oversampling of the western 
United States might allow for more rapid identification of 
emerging resistance trends, such sampling might contribute 
to overestimates of national-level point prevalence of resistance 
phenotypes. Finally, although clear differences in susceptibility 
are evident by sex of sex partner even after stratification 
by geographic region and adjustment for other potential 
confounders (30), the magnitude of difference in prevalence 
of resistance between MSM and MSW might be influenced 
by differences in proportions of MSM, MSMW, and MSW 
in GISP by geographic region.
Future Directions
One goal of the United States National Strategy for Combating 
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria is to maintain ceftriaxone-resistant 
N. gonorrhoeae prevalence at <2.0% through 2020 (28). This 
effort will require a multipronged approach and new tools to 
prevent emergence of resistant gonorrhea strains. Strengthening 
gonorrhea control should be the foundation, possibly with a 
focus on the western United States and other regions where 
resistant strains tend to emerge. Optimal prevention measures 
include screening sexually active females aged <25 years, as well 
as women aged >25 years at increased risk for infection§ (20); 
screening sexually active MSM at anatomic sites of possible 
exposure at least annually (20); and appropriately treating 
patients with gonorrhea and their recent sex partners, including 
retesting 3 months after treatment. Gonorrhea control options 
for patients who cannot link their partners to evaluation and 
treatment include partner notification by health department 
staff or expedited partner therapy. Clinicians should use the

dual-therapy regimen of ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly 
and azithromycin 1 g orally (20) to treat patients with gonorrhea 
and stay abreast of changes to CDC’s treatment guidelines. 
Sexually active persons can be encouraged to use condoms 
consistently and correctly to prevent transmission of gonorrhea.
In 2016, the U.S. Congress approved $160 million in 
additional funding to CDC to implement its role in the 
National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. 
The national strategy outlines interventions to reduce the 
emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which 
include N. gonorrhoeae (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/
solutions-initiative/index.html). As part of this initiative, 
CDC plans to build capacity in up to nine U.S. counties to 
rapidly detect and respond to antibiotic-resistant gonococcal 
infections. Rapid identification of resistant infections could 
allow local public health authorities to slow transmission 
through rapid investigations, contact tracing, and network 
analyses. New diagnostic tools are needed. Development of 
well-validated molecular assays to quickly identify presence 
or absence of resistance determinants (absence suggests 
antimicrobial susceptibility) could guide more timely and 
tailored treatment and improve reach and speed of surveillance. 
Through the Advanced Molecular Detection initiative, CDC 
is supporting identification of N. gonorrhoeae resistance 
determinants, an important first step in the development 
of molecular assays (http://www.cdc.gov/amd/project-
summaries/treating-gonorrhea-threat.html). Phenotypic 
culture-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing will remain 
critical, however; molecular tests alone will not detect new 
mutations conferring resistance or new resistance phenotypes. 
New antibiotics and new prevention tools, including a vaccine, 
are urgent needs. Surveillance is a core public health function 
that guides prevention and control efforts as new tools or 
approaches are developed and implemented.
Conclusion
Since its inception in 1986, GISP has monitored N. gonorrhoeae 
antimicrobial susceptibility. Data from GISP have advanced 
knowledge about gonococcal resistance, influenced policy and 
prevention decisions, and repeatedly provided evidence on which 
to base national treatment recommendations. In 2014, data from 
GISP demonstrated increases in prevalence of Azi-RS and to a 
lesser degree, of Cfx-RS. It is unclear whether these increases 
mark the beginning of trends, but emergence of cephalosporin 
and azithromycin resistance would complicate gonorrhea 
treatment substantially. Local and state health departments 
can use GISP data to determine allocation of STD prevention 
services and resources, guide prevention and control planning, 
and inform health care providers. Federal agencies can use GISP 
data to monitor susceptibility trends, identify novel resistances, 
guide national treatment recommendations, set research and 
prevention priorities, and monitor success of the National 
Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. Specimens 
collected through surveillance can be used to guide development 
of diagnostic methods, therapeutic agents, and vaccines. 
Continued surveillance, appropriate treatment, development of 
new antibiotics, and prevention of transmission remain the best 
strategies to reduce gonorrhea incidence and morbidity.
