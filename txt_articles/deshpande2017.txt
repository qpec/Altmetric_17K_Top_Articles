IMPORTANCE American football is the largest participation sport in US high schools and is a
leading cause of concussion among adolescents. Little is known about the long-term
cognitive and mental health consequences of exposure to football-related head trauma at the
high school level.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association of playing high school football with cognitive
impairment and depression at 65 years of age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A representative sample of male high school students
who graduated from high school in Wisconsin in 1957 was studied. In this cohort study using
data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, football players were matched between March 1
and July 1, 2017, with controls along several baseline covariates such as adolescent IQ, family
background, and educational level. For robustness, 3 versions of the control condition were
considered: all controls, those who played a noncollision sport, and those who did not play
any sport.
EXPOSURES Athletic participation in high school football.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite cognition measure of verbal fluency and
memory and attention constructed from results of cognitive assessments administered at 65
years of age. A modified Center for Epidemiological Studies’Depression Scale score was used
to measure depression. Secondary outcomes include results of individual cognitive tests,
anger, anxiety, hostility, and heavy use of alcohol.
RESULTS Among the 3904 men (mean [SD] age, 64.4 [0.8] years at time of primary outcome
measurement) in the study, after matching and model-based covariate adjustment,
compared with each control condition, there was no statistically significant harmful
association of playing football with a reduced composite cognition score (–0.04 reduction in
cognition vs all controls; 97.5% CI, –0.14 to 0.05) or an increased modified Center for
Epidemiological Studies’Depression Scale depression score (–1.75 reduction vs all controls;
97.5% CI, –3.24 to –0.26). After adjustment for multiple testing, playing football did not have
a significant adverse association with any of the secondary outcomes, such as the likelihood
of heavy alcohol use at 65 years of age (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.32-1.43).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cognitive and depression outcomes later in life were found to
be similar for high school football players and their nonplaying counterparts from mid-1950s
in Wisconsin. The risks of playing football today might be different than in the 1950s, but for
current athletes, this study provides information on the risk of playing sports today that have
a similar risk of head trauma as high school football played in the 1950s.

can football in 2014,1 but, recently, many have ques-
tioned the safety of the sport2,3 or even called for its
ban.4 These concerns have been driven partially by reports of
chronic traumatic encephalopathy,5,6 increased risks of neu-
rodegenerative disease,7 and associations between a history
of concussion and cognitive impairment and depression later
in life8-10 among retired professional football players.
Althoughtheyareconcerning,mostreportsofchronictrau-
maticencephalopathyamongretiredprofessionalfootballplay-
ers are based on posthumously donated brains and are poten-
tiallyaffectedbyreferralbias.Oneexception,astudybyBieniek
et al,11 examined a larger, nonselected brain bank and found a
higher rate of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among for-
mer athletes than nonathletes. However, they determined par-
ticipation in contact sports by querying only medical rec-
ords, potentially underestimating the true rate of participation
and leading to information bias.12 Without population-level
samples, it is difficult to estimate the base rate of long-term
dysfunction among professional football players, much less
among high school players.
There has been limited work examining the association of
playinghighschoolfootballwithcognitiveimpairmentandde-
pression later in life. One study found an association be-
tween increased exposure to head trauma and cognitive im-
pairmentanddepressionamongformerhighschoolandcollege
players.13 A population-level study by Savica et al14 found that
high school football players were not at a higher risk of neu-
rodegenerative disease than their male classmates who did not
playfootball.Althoughtheyareinformative,thesestudieshave
limitationsforelucidatinganassociationbetweenplayingfoot-
ball and cognitive impairment; the former study13 used vol-
unteer participants, and the latter14 did not control for any
potential confounders, such as adolescent IQ or family
background.15-18
In the absence of a randomized clinical trial, the criterion
standard for studying the association of an exposure with
an outcome is a prospective longitudinal study that follows
a population sample and measures many potential con-
founders.19-21 We use data from such a study, the Wisconsin
Longitudinal Study (WLS) of graduates from Wisconsin high
schools in 1957,22 to study the long-term association of playing
high school football with cognitive impairment and depres-
sion.TheWLScontainsarichsetofbaselinevariablesrelatedto
family background, adolescent characteristics including ado-
lescentIQ,andeducationallevelthatallmaybelinkedtohealth

tiveandpsychologicalwell-beingassessmentsat54,65,and72
years of age.
Methods
After constructing the participant matches but before exam-
ining the outcome data, we registered the study at clincialtri-
als.gov (identifier: NCT02833129) and posted our protocol
with matching results online to arXiv (identifier: arXiv:
1607.01756), as recommended by Rubin.23 The University of
Pennsylvania institutional review board approved the proto-
col for this matched observational study, and WLS interview-
ers obtained oral informed consent from participants.
Study Population
In 1957, the WLS randomly sampled 10 317 Wisconsin high
school graduates (one-third of all graduates) and has ob-
served them since then.22,24 Data on participation in football
were recorded following systematic reviews of high school
yearbooks between January 2005 and February 2011. Partici-
pation data were unavailable for 1018 of the 4991 men (20.4%)
in the WLS. An additional 69 men (1.4%) played sports with a
high incidence of head trauma (eg, soccer, hockey, wrestling,
and lacrosse). The remaining 3904 men (78.2%) were eligible
for this study. Of these men, primary outcomes were unavail-
able for 1212 (31.0%), who were removed from our primary
analysis. Of the remaining 2692 men, 834 (31.0%) played foot-
ball and 1858 did not. Further details of eligibility and inclu-
sion criteria can be found in the eAppendix in the Supple-
ment. The WLS data set does not include history of concussion
and total exposure to football prior to high school. These fac-
tors have been associated with cognitive decline in later
life,8,9,13,25 but we were unable to explicitly control for them
in our analysis.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
We considered 2 primary outcomes measured at 65 years of
age (mean [SD] age, 64.4 [0.8] years) related to depression
and cognitive impairment. We measured depression with the
WLS-modified Center for Epidemiological Studies’Depres-
sion Scale (CES-D).26 We constructed a composite cognition
measure by averaging the z scores from the Letter Fluency (LF)
and Delayed Word Recall (DWR) tests. Of the measures of lan-
guage and executive function and verbal memory attention in
the WLS, these were the most consistent with the National In-
stitute of Health’
s recommended Common Data Elements in
Traumatic Brain Injury research.27 A meta-analysis of the neu-
ropsychological effects of mild traumatic brain injury identi-
fied LF as the task most sensitive to exposure.28 Impairments
in DWR may be particularly relevant to cognitive defects later
Key Points
Question Does playing high school football have a statistically and
clinically significant adverse association with cognitive impairment
and depression at 65 years of age?
Findings In this cohort study using data from the Wisconsin
Longitudinal Study among men graduating high school in
Wisconsin in 1957, there was no statistically or clinically significant
harmful association between playing football in high school and
increased cognitive impairment or depression later in life, on
average.
Meaning For men who attended high school in the late 1950s,
playing high school football did not appear to be a major risk factor
for later-life cognitive impairment or depression; for current
athletes, this study provides information on the risk of playing
sports today that have a similar head trauma exposure risk as high
school football played in the 1950s.

search has identified associations between sports-related con-
cussions and preclinical Alzheimer disease.8 For individuals
missingeitheranLForDWRscore,weusedtheavailablezscore
instead of the mean of the 2 scores.
Secondary outcomes were the composite cognition
score at 72 years of age, modified CES-D scores at 54 and 72
years of age, individual cognitive test scores, hostility indi-
ces, anxiety and anger indices derived from the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory29 and State-Trait Anger Expression
Inventory-II,30 and whether the individual reported con-
suming 5 or more alcoholic drinks on at least 5 separate
occasions in the month preceding the WLS interview at 54,
65, and 72 years of age.
Regular physical activity in early adulthood has been as-
sociated with slower rates of cognitive decline,31 potentially
mediatinganynegativeassociationofplayingfootballandcog-
nitive impairment. Accordingly, we examined whether foot-
ball players were more likely than controls to engage in such
activityat35yearsofage.SeetheeAppendixintheSupplement
for more details on the outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
Matching Methods
To control for potential confounding variables, we used full
matching to create matched sets containing 1 football player
and 1 or more controls or 1 or more football players and 1
control. These sets optimally balance the distribution of the
baseline variables listed in Table 1 between football players
and controls.32 Our full matching procedure first applies a
propensity score caliper33 and then minimizes the rank-
based Mahalanobis distance between matched participants
with similar propensity scores.34 Our objective in matching
is to achieve standardized differences between exposed
participants and controls on baseline variables below 0.2
SDs. Regression-based covariate adjustment has been
shown to remove biases due to covariate imbalance of this
magnitude.35,36
Our control group consisted of all participants who did
not play high school football (all controls). We also consid-
ered 2 subsets as alternative control groups: those who did not
play any high school sports (nonsport controls) and those who
played a noncollision sport but did not play football (non-
collision sport controls); eTable 2 in the Supplement tabu-
lates participation of eligible individuals by sport. These
alternative control groups may differ along unmeasured
characteristics, such as personality and fitness, that could
affect our outcomes. A convincing study would show con-
sistent evidence (or lack thereof) of an exposure association
across comparisons with each control group. Comparability
of the 2 alternative control groups would suggest that
such unmeasured characteristics did not significantly in-
fluence the outcomes of interest.37 To facilitate these 4
comparisons—football vs all controls, football vs noncolli-
sion sport controls, football vs nonsport controls, and non-
collision sport vs nonsport controls—we built 4 separate full
matches that were exactly matched on availability of LF,
DWR, and modified CES-D scores at 65 years of age (eAp-
pendix in the Supplement). Matching was performed prior
to analysis between March 1 and July 1, 2017.
Attrition Analysis for the Availability of Outcome
eTable 3 in the Supplement shows the availability of primary
outcomes. To examine whether playing high school football
increased the likelihood of attrition from the WLS or the avail-
ability of outcomes at 65 years of age, we fitted logistic regres-
sions to estimate the availability of the LF, DWR, and modi-
fiedCES-Dscoresat65yearsofageusingallbaselinecovariates
and an exposure indicator.
Test Statistic for Exposure Association
For each continuous outcome, we fitted a multiple regres-
sion model using the same baseline covariates used in the
matching, indicators for the matched sets, and an exposure
indicator. We tested for an exposure association using a
2-tailed t test. P < .05 was considered significant. The com-
bination of full matching and regression is robust and
efficient.37-40 An identical procedure was used for binary
outcomes except we fitted a conditional logit regression
model and reported the outcomes as odds ratios (ORs). For
each outcome variable, we judged effect sizes by the popu-
lar criterion attributed to Cohen: 0.2 SDs for small effects,
0.5 SDs for medium effects, and 0.8 SDs for large effects.41
For the combined cognition score, these cutoffs (on the
absolute scale) are 0.16 for small effects, 0.41 for medium
effects, and 0.65 for large effects; for the modified CES-D
score, 2.56 for small effects, 6.41 for medium effects, and
10.25 for large effects.
Test for Unmeasured Confounding Using Postexposure Variables
Since acute cognitive dysfunction following concussions or
mild traumatic brain injury resolves within 3 months in
most patients,42-46 we hypothesized that any medium-term
differences in outcomes before 35 years of age between
football players and controls would be due to unmeasured
differences that existed prior to high school graduation. To
assess the presence of these differences, we tested whether
playing football was associated with several medium-term
postexposure variables (military service, years of education,
occupational prestige of job held in 1974, and earnings in
1974) at α = .05, with no correction for multiple testing.
Ordered Hypothesis Testing
We tested each primary outcome at α = .025 and reported
97.5% CIs so that the overall familywise error rate was 0.05.
To perform the aforementioned comparisons with different
control groups without losing power owing to multiple test-
ing, we used an ordered testing procedure47 (eAppendix in
the Supplement).
Secondary Analyses
For testing the association of playing football with the sec-
ondary outcomes, we used only matched sets constructed
using all controls. We adjusted for multiple testing of
secondary outcomes with the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure,48 controlling the false discovery rate at α = .05.

 Because physical activity at 35 years of age could mediate
the association of playing football with the primary out-
comes, we tested for football’
s association with physical
activity at α = .05 using the same matches as the primary
analysis.
The number of ε4 variants of the apolipoprotein E gene
(APOE [OMIM 107741]), a risk factor for developing Alzhei-
mer disease,49 was available for a limited subset of partici-
pants. We assessed the balance of the number of ε4 variants
and the availability of APOE data between football players and
each control group. We repeated our primary analysis re-
stricted to participants with APOE data and included the
number of ε4 variants in the match. We then tested whether
playing high school football and the presence of the APOE ε4
variant has an interaction association with long-term cogni-
tive or mental health outcomes.
The availability of outcomes at multiple time points en-
abled us to compare rates of cognitive decline among football
players and all controls. For each individual cognitive test and
themodifiedCES-Dscore,wefittedamixed-effectsmodelwith
fixedeffectsforplayingfootball,age,andtheirinteraction,and
a time-invariant random effect for each participant. We also
includedthecovariatesfromTable1asfixedeffects.Thisanaly-
siswithoutmatchingincludesmanyofthe1212individualswho

LF,DWR,andmodifiedCES-Dscoresat65yearsofage.Weused
a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control the false discov-
ery rate at α = .05.
Results
Attrition Analysis
Football players were not significantly more or less likely than
controlstobemissingtheLFscore(OR,1.07;97.5%CI,0.90-1.28;
P = .37), the DWR score (OR, 1.08; 97.5% CI, 0.91-1.29; P = .31),
or the modified CES-D score (OR, 1.15; 97.5% CI, 0.96-1.39; P =
.09) at 65 years of age.
Matching
Table 1 shows the standardized differences from matching
footballplayerswithallcontrols.Beforematching,the2groups
were adequately balanced (standardized differences, <0.2) on
allvariablesexcepthighschoolsize,participationinschoolgov-
ernment, and planned years of future education. After match-
ing, all standardized differences were less than 0.2, so our
covariate adjustment could remove remaining differences in
the covariates.35,36 The other matches were similar (eTables
4-6 in the Supplement). The distributions of IQ, planned years
of future education, and parental income for football players
and matched controls were very similar (eFigure in the Supple-
ment). eTables 7 to 11 in the Supplement provide further de-
tails on the matching results.
Testing Unmeasured Confounding Using
Postexposure Variables
After matching, we found that playing high school football
was not significantly associated with serving in the military
between 1957 and 1975 (OR, 1.05; 97.5% CI, 0.91-1.22;
P = .42), years of education up to 1975 (1.04; 97.5% CI, 0.87-
1.25; P = .62), occupational prestige of job held in 1974
(–6.86; 97.5% CI, –29.67 to 15.96; P = .50), or earnings in
1974 (10.30; 97.5% CI, –1.85 to 22.45; P = .06). The distribu-
tions of postexposure variables were similar across football
players and each version of the matched controls (eFigure in
the Supplement).
Primary Outcomes
The distributions of the primary outcomes for football play-
ers and each version of the matched controls were similar
(Figure 1). Table 2 shows the estimated treatment effect in each
of the 4 comparisons.
Cognition
Football players did not have significantly different compos-
ite cognition scores than all controls (–0.04; 97.5% CI, –0.14
to0.05;P = .37),andthe97.5%CIcontainedonlyeffectssmaller
than the small effects cutoff (0.15) (Table 2). Compared with
eachcontrolgroup,footballplayers’compositecognitionscores
werenotsignificantlydifferent,althoughwhencomparedwith
nonsport controls, the 97.5% CI contained some effects above
the small-size cutoff but none above the medium-size cutoff
(0.41). Noncollision sport controls and nonsport controls were
also not significantly different (–0.09; 97.5% CI, –0.20 to 0.03;
P = .10).
Depression
Football players’modified CES-D scores were significantly
lower (–1.75; 97.5% CI, –3.24 to –0.26; P = .01) than all con-
trols, meaning that they reported fewer depressive symp-
toms (Table 2). The 97.5% CI suggests that playing high
school football could have a beneficial effect above the
small-size cutoff (2.56) but not above the medium-size cut-
off (6.4). Because the 97.5% CI contains only beneficial
effects of football on depression, there is no evidence that
football is associated with increased depression. Compared
with each control group, we obtained similar findings,
although the association of playing football with depression
was not significant when compared with nonsport controls
(–1.27; 97.5% CI, –2.89 to 0.35; P = .08). Noncollision sport
controls and nonsport controls’modified CES-D scores were
also significantly different (0.67; 97.5% CI, –1.19 to 2.52;
P = .42).

 the differences were not statistically significant, and the
97.5% CIs contained only values smaller than the small
effect cutoff.
Apart from the Immediate Word Recall test, none of the
97.5% CIs for individual cognitive tests contained values
larger than the small effect cutoff. After Benjamini-
Hochberg correction, the difference in Immediate Word
Recall test scores at 72 years of age between football players
and all controls was not significant (0.20; 97.5 CI, −0.02 to
0.41; unadjusted P = .04) (Table 3). Football players’anger,
anxiety, and hostility indices at all ages were not signifi-
cantly different from all controls’indices. Football players
were not significantly more likely than controls to consume
a large amount of alcohol at 54 years of age (0.49; 97.5% CI,
0.21-1.14; unadjusted P = .06), 65 years of age (0.68; 97.5%
CI, 0.32-1.43; unadjusted P = .25), and 72 years of age (1.11;
97.5% CI, 0.18-6.68; unadjusted P = .90).
Physical Activity
Compared with all controls and nonsport controls, at 35 years
of age, football players were significantly more likely to en-
gage in regular moderate to vigorous physical activity (all con-
trols: OR, 1.23; 97.5% CI, 1.02-1.48; P = .02; nonsport con-
trols: OR, 1.37; 97.5% CI, 1.11-1.70; P = .001). Football players
were not significantly more or less likely to engage in such ac-
tivity than noncollision sport controls. Noncollision sport con-
trols were significantly more likely to engage in such activity
than were nonsport controls.
Interaction of APOE ε4 Status With Playing High School Football
When we repeated our analysis using only individuals with
availablegenotypedata,ourfindingsweresimilar(eTables11-22
in the Supplement). The presence of an additional APOE ε4
variant does not significantly modify the association of play-
ing high school football with modified CES-D scores (–1.49;
97.5% CI, –3.39 to 0.41; P = .08) or composite cognitive scores
(0.01; 97.5% CI –0.11 to 0.14; P = .80) at 65 years of age (eTable

Discussion
Among men who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in
1957, playing high school football was not adversely associ-
ated with cognitive impairment or depression later in life. Fur-
thermore,thecorresponding97.5%CIscontainonlysmallposi-
tive and negative effect sizes. Our findings are consistent
with those of Savica et al,14 who found no differences in the
incidence rates of neurodegenerative disease among football
players and their non–football-playing classmates in a con-
temporaneous cohort.
Athletes and parents may consider our findings when
weighing the potential risks and benefits of participation in
high school athletics. Participation in high school sports, even
contact sports with a high risk of head trauma, has potential
benefits,includingpromotingphysicalactivity,teamwork,and
recreation.Indeed,inourcohort,playinganyhighschoolsport,
football or otherwise, was associated with increased physical
activity at 35 years of age. However, such participation is not
without risk, and our findings do not speak to the benefits of

 common-sense measures, such as improving concussion man-
agement protocols.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths along with some limitations.
Strengths include the use of prospectively collected longitu-
dinal data from a large population sample and careful control
for several important confounders, including adolescent IQ,
high school rank, and parent’
s educational level. Using mul-
tiple control groups and comparing postexposure variables
thought to be unaffected by playing football, we found no evi-
dence of unmeasured confounding. However, because 31.0%
of eligible participants were missing both primary outcomes,
ourresultsmaybelimitedbyselectionbias.Theattritionanaly-
sis found that football players were not significantly more or
less likely to be missing either primary outcome, somewhat
mitigating this concern.
Ourfindingsmaynotgeneralizetocurrenthighschoolfoot-
ball players owing to changes in playing style, training tech-
nique, protective equipment, and rules aimed at improving
safety. Although high school football today may be safer as a
result of these changes, it is possible that the frequency and
severityofheadimpactshaveincreasedowingtothefasterpace
of the game, the larger body size of the players,51 or an in-
creased perception of safety.52 Exposure to repeated head
traumabefore12yearsofagemayleadtocognitivedeclinelater
in life,53 but information on the age of first exposure is un-
available in the data set.
Although we did not find evidence of a large mean asso-
ciation of playing high school football with cognitive impair-
ment and depression later in life, some subgroups of football
players may have an elevated risk of dysfunction later in life.
Several studies have found that a history of multiple con-
cussions may have long-term cognitive and behavioral
consequences8,9,13,25 and that the frequency and severity
of head impacts vary by team position (eg, quarterback,
receiver).54 Concussion history and position information were
unavailable. Further research is needed to examine the risks
for these subgroups.
Conclusions
Among men graduating from high school in Wisconsin in
1957, we did not find evidence that playing football had a
negative long-term association with cognitive functioning
and mental health at 65 and 72 years of age. Although our
findings may not generalize to current high school football
players, they may be relevant to current athletes playing
contact sports with similar mean levels of head trauma as
