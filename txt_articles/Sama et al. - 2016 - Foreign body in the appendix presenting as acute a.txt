Foreign body in the appendix presenting
as acute appendicitis: a case report

Abstract
Background: Foreign bodies are a rare cause of appendicitis. In most instances, ingested foreign bodies pass through
the alimentary tract asymptomatically. However, those that enter the lumen of the vermiform appendix may not be
able to re-enter the colon and may initiate an inflammatory process. We report a case of acute appendicitis induced by
an unusual foreign body.
Case presentation: A 26-year-old Sub-Saharan woman presented with right iliac fossa pain and tenderness. She
underwent an open appendectomy which revealed a condom fragment within the appendiceal lumen. A detailed
retrospective history confirmed accidental ingestion of the condom 2 weeks prior to onset of symptoms.
Conclusions: Although a rare finding, a variety of foreign bodies can be lodged in the appendix and may instigate an
inflammatory process. There is a need to increase awareness of the potential dangers of ingested foreign bodies.

Background
Worldwide, appendicectomy for acute appendicitis is the
most common emergency surgical procedure [1, 2]. The
ingestion of inedible and indigestible objects is frequent
in children; in adults it is a rare condition that often oc-
curs accidentally, or it can occur in patients with mental
disorders or in prisoners [3, 4]. The presence of a foreign
body (FB) in the appendix, acting as a cause of an in-
flammatory process, is a very rare event [5]. Here we
present a rare case of an appendicectomy indicated for
acute appendicitis due to an accidental ingestion of an
unusual FB which is apparently the first case of its kind
published in the literature.
Case presentation
A 26-year-old Sub-Saharan woman presented to our unit
with a 1-week history of vague colicky lower abdominal
pains occasionally radiating to her right iliac fossa (RIF),
which progressively increased in intensity over the last
4 days and localized to her RIF. She also developed nau-
sea and anorexia but reported no episodes of vomiting.
She took self-prescribed doses of ibuprofen with no re-
lief, prompting a consult at our health unit.
On examination, she had a temperature of 38.2 °C, re-
spiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, pulse of 78 beats
per minute, and her blood pressure was 110/82 mmHg.
There was tenderness and guarding on palpation of her
RIF and a positive Rovsing’s sign. There was no palpable
mass and her bowel sounds were normal. A vaginal
examination revealed right adnexal tenderness. The rest
of the examination was unremarkable. A white blood
cell count showed a leucocytosis of 12,500cells/mm3
with a neutrophilic predominance of 10,500cells/mm3. A
working diagnosis of acute appendicitis was suggested
based on an Alvarado score of 9/10. An abdominal ultra-
sound scan was requested which revealed a thickened
appendiceal wall and fluid collection around her RIF. No
FB was identified. She was prepared for emergency sur-
gery. Via a gridiron incision, her appendix was found to
be inflamed and an appendectomy was performed. No
intraoperative complication occurred and her abdo-
men was closed in layers. Due to an unusual feel, we
blindly dissected the resected appendix and found an
incomplete piece of a rubbery material which was
consistent with a condom (Fig. 1). The postoperative
period was uneventful and she was discharged on
postoperative day 4.

 Discussion
The year 1735 saw the first appendicectomy, which was
performed on an 11-year-old boy at St. George’s Hos-
pital in London by Claudius Amyand during which a
sewing pin was found to have perforated the appendix
[6]. FBs in the appendix are uncommon but well de-
scribed with an estimated prevalence of 0.0005 % [7, 8].
FBs generally do not cause any complications and pass
through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) spontaneously
within a week. The complication rate of ingested FBs is
estimated at less than 1 % [8].
Various objects acting as FBs have been reported in
the literature to be the cause of acute appendicitis, in-
cluding bird shot, bullets, fishing lines, screws, coins,
stones, toothbrush bristle, pins, needles, teeth, bone
fragments, dog hair, fruit seeds and pits, toothpicks, drill
bits, tongue studs, crown post, keys and intrauterine
contraceptive devices [3, 4, 7–11]. Considering the
dependent position of the cecum and to some extent its
low motility, such FBs tend to gravitate and settle there.
In addition, the chance of entry to the appendiceal
lumen is determined not only by its orifice (which might
be tight or widely open) but also by the anatomic pos-
ition of the appendix. There is almost no possibility for a
FB to enter the lumen of a retrocecal appendix [8]. Once
the FB is lodged in the appendix, peristaltic motion is
usually insufficient to expel it back into the cecal lumen.
It may remain immobile in the appendix without stimu-
lating an inflammatory process or cause an inflammatory
reaction with or without perforation. The period of la-
tency between ingestion of the FB and the onset of
symptoms varies from hours to years [4, 9, 11]. Compli-
cations usually depend on the size and shape of the FB.
Blunt FBs cause appendicitis through obstruction of
the appendiceal lumen and remain dormant for lon-
ger periods. Elongated sharp FBs are more likely to
cause perforations, appendicular abscesses, and peri-
tonitis [4, 8–10].
In our case, there was no history suggestive of FB in-
gestion during clinical evaluation. However, following re-
trieval of the condom fragment from the patient’s
appendix and its presentation to the patient postopera-
tively, she could recall having performed oral sex on her
boyfriend 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. She
reported that the condom had loosened during the act
and she accidentally ingested it. She however did not
find it necessary to inform us as she did not think it was
the cause of her symptoms because she had passed out
fragments of the ingested condom in her feces 5 days
after ingestion. It is likely that during its migration in
the GIT the condom was torn into fragments and a
piece was trapped within the vermiform appendix and
the rest expelled in fecal matter. Arya et al. [12] had re-
ported a case where multiple pieces of a condom were

 retrieved from the bronchus of a 27-year-old Indian
woman. As in the present case report, she inhaled the
condom during oral sex.
Apart from accidental ingestion of a condom during
oral sex, it is important to note that the act is also associ-
ated with several other complications including a signifi-
cant risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency
virus, syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, hepatitis viruses, gonor-
rhea, and human papilloma virus infections [13].
There is a need to increase awareness of the potential
dangers of ingested FBs. Each time such incidents occur,
it is advisable patients report promptly for proper evalu-
ation and follow-up until the FB is properly traced as it
may account for significant morbidity and mortality.
Conclusions
Foreign bodies are rare causes of appendicitis. A wide
variety of objects can be trapped in the appendix. Our
case demonstrates a rare clinical scenario in which an
unusual FB became lodged in the appendix and eventu-
ally initiated an inflammatory process which resulted in
acute appendicitis.
