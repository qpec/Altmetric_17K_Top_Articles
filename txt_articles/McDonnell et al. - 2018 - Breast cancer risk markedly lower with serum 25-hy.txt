Abstract
Background
While numerous epidemiologic studies have found an association between higher serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and lower breast cancer risk, few have
assessed this association for concentrations >40 ng/ml.
Objective
To investigate the relationship between 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk
across a broad range of 25(OH)D concentrations among women aged 55 years and older.
Methods
Analyses used pooled data from two randomized clinical trials (N = 1129, N = 2196) and
a prospective cohort (N = 1713) to examine a broad range of 25(OH)D concentrations.
The outcome was diagnosis of breast cancer during the observation periods (median: 4.0
years). Three analyses were conducted: 1) Incidence rates were compared according to
25(OH)D concentration from <20 to �60 ng/ml (<50 to �150 nmol/L), 2) Kaplan-Meier plots
were developed and 3) multivariate Cox regression was used to examine the association
between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk using multiple 25(OH)D measurements.
Results
Within the pooled cohort (N = 5038), 77 women were diagnosed with breast cancer (age-
adjusted incidence: 512 cases per 100,000 person-years). Results were similar for the three

 analyses. First, comparing incidence rates, there was an 82% lower incidence rate of breast
cancer for women with 25(OH)D concentrations �60 vs <20 ng/ml (Rate Ratio = 0.18,
P = 0.006). Second, Kaplan-Meier curves for concentrations of <20, 20–39, 40–59 and �60
ng/ml were significantly different (P = 0.02), with the highest proportion breast cancer-free in
the �60 ng/ml group (99.3%) and the lowest proportion breast cancer-free in the <20 ng/ml
group (96.8%). The proportion with breast cancer was 78% lower for �60 vs <20 ng/ml
(P = 0.02). Third, multivariate Cox regression revealed that women with 25(OH)D concen-
trations �60 ng/ml had an 80% lower risk of breast cancer than women with concentrations
<20 ng/ml (HR = 0.20, P = 0.03), adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, calcium supple-
ment intake, and study of origin.
Conclusions
Higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a dose-response decrease in breast
cancer risk with concentrations �60 ng/ml being most protective.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in women [1]. More than 252,000 new
cases of female breast cancer and 40,600 deaths were projected to occur in 2017 in the United
States [1]. While more early detection and improvements in treatment have reduced the mor-
tality rate, there has been no reduction in the incidence of breast cancer in the past 20 years
[2]. Identifying and implementing effective primary prevention strategies could reduce breast
cancer incidence rates.
Epidemiologic studies by Gorham et al. [3,4] and Garland et al. [5] were the first to propose
that vitamin D prevents breast cancer. Since then, the mechanisms by which vitamin D might
prevent the development and growth of breast cancer have been well documented [6] and
numerous epidemiologic studies have found an association between higher serum 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, the physiological measure of vitamin D status, and a
lower risk of breast cancer [7–18]. However, few studies have assessed this association in con-
centrations >40 ng/ml [7,8].
The objective of this analysis was to investigate the relationship between 25(OH)D concen-
tration and breast cancer risk across a broad range of 25(OH)D concentrations among women
aged 55 years and older. Data from two randomized clinical trials (RCT) and a prospective
cohort study were pooled: the 2007 Lappe et al. cohort (RCT, median 25(OH)D = 31 ng/ml,
N = 1129) [19,20], the 2017 Lappe et al. cohort (RCT, median 25(OH)D = 36 ng/ml, N = 2196)
[21], and the GrassrootsHealth cohort (prospective cohort study, median 25(OH)D = 49 ng/
ml, N = 1713) [20]. This pooled cohort provided a larger sample size for improved statistical
power and allowed for analysis across a broad range of 25(OH)D concentrations that would
otherwise not have been possible due to the lack of a sufficient number of participants with
25(OH)D concentrations higher than 40 ng/ml.
Materials and methods

 to: 1) calcium plus vitamin D3 (1400–1500 mg/day of calcium plus 1100 IU/day of vitamin
D3), 2) calcium (calcium as mentioned previously plus vitamin D placebo), or 3) control (cal-
cium and vitamin D placebos). This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00352170.
In another study, women in the 2017 Lappe et al. cohort (hereafter termed 2017 Lappe
cohort) participated in a four year, population-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
vitamin D and calcium supplementation in a 31-county area in Eastern Nebraska. Participants
were randomly assigned to: 1) intervention (1500 mg/day of calcium and 2000 IU/day of vita-
min D3) or 2) control (calcium and vitamin D placebos). This trial was registered at clinical-
trials.gov as NCT01052051.
For both Lappe cohorts, inclusion criteria included women aged 55 years or older who
were free of known cancer at enrollment and within the prior 10 years. As described previ-
ously [19–22], supplement intake by bottle weight and health status were assessed at
6-month intervals. Medical records were examined to confirm reports of cancer diagnosis
and ascertain diagnosis date. Participants who did not complete at least two health assess-
ments were excluded from this study because of lack of prospective data. Serum 25(OH)D
concentrations were measured at enrollment and annually thereafter using radioimmunoas-
say (IDS Radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit, Fountain Hills, AZ for the 2007 cohort and Liaison1
Analyzer, Diasorin, Stillwater, MN for the 2017 cohort) at the Creighton University Osteopo-
rosis Research Center Laboratory (Omaha, NE). The intra-assay coefficient of variation was
5% for IDS RIA and 5% for Liaison1. Additionally, the Creighton Laboratory participates
in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS) with findings on test sam-
ples regularly close to the international mean. Detailed descriptions of the Lappe trials and
results of other outcomes can be found elsewhere [19–22]. All participants provided written
informed consent and the studies were approved by the Creighton University Institutional
Review Board (Omaha, NE).
Women in the GrassrootsHealth cohort participated in a prospective population-based
cohort study run by a non-profit public health research organization. Voluntary partici-
pants, who reside in 57 countries worldwide (91% in the United States or Canada) submitted
home blood spot 25(OH)D test kits and completed online health questionnaires. There were
no exclusion criteria nor any requirements related to 25(OH)D concentration or supple-
ment intake dose. Participants included both genders and a wide range of ages; however,
only female participants aged 55 years or older who were free of known cancer at enrollment
and within the prior 10 years who completed at least two health assessments were included
in this pooled analysis to match the inclusion criteria of the Lappe cohorts. As described
previously [20], cancer diagnosis dates and cancer type were reported as were average daily
calcium supplement intake, age, smoking status, height, and weight. Serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations were determined by analysis of dried blood spot test kits using liquid chroma-
tography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) by ZRT Laboratory (Beaverton, OR) or Purity
Laboratory (Lake Oswego, OR). The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 9% for ZRT
and 5% for Purity. Additionally, the ZRT and Purity assays have been validated against the
DEQAS LC-MS/MS consensus group (R2 values of 0.998 and 0.994 respectively). LC-MS/
MS with dried blood spot cards has been validated against the radioimmunoassay method
(R2 value of 0.91 and a slope not different from 1.0) [23]. All participants provided informed
consent and the study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia,
WA).
Overall, this analysis included 1129 women from the 2007 Lappe cohort (median follow-up
time, 4.0 years), 2196 women from the 2017 Lappe cohort (median follow-up time, 4.0 years),
and 1713 women from the GrassrootsHealth cohort (median follow-up time, 1.9 years)
(pooled cohort N = 5038; median follow-up time, 4.0 years).

 Statistical methods
Demographic characteristics were summarized and comparisons between cohorts were per-
formed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for age, BMI, calcium supplement intake (study and non-
study combined for Lappe cohorts), and serum 25(OH)D. The chi-square test was used for
smoking status. While data was collected for all types of cancer diagnoses, the outcome of
interest for this current study was the diagnosis of breast cancer (invasive or in situ) during the
observation periods. Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates were calculated using direct
standardization to the 2010 US population [24].
Three analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between 25(OH)D concen-
tration and breast cancer. First, breast cancer incidence rates and their 95% confidence inter-
vals (95% CI) were calculated for successive 20 ng/ml strata of serum 25(OH)D concentration
from <20 to �60 ng/ml using a moving average method [25–27] to assess incidence trends
across the range of 25(OH)D. A rate ratio (incidence density ratio) for <20 vs �60 was calcu-
lated to compare incidence rates.
Second, Kaplan-Meier curves comparing the proportion of breast cancer-free participants
by 25(OH)D group were developed to estimate breast cancer-free survival over time and
account for varying lengths of follow-up. Four a priori categories of 25(OH)D were used:
<20 ng/ml, 20–39 ng/ml, 40–59 ng/ml, and �60 ng/ml. The 20 ng/ml cut point is from the
National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly Institute of Medicine) recommendation for
bone health [28], the 40 ng/ml cut point is from articles recommending this concentration
for the prevention of cancer [29–33], and the 60 ng/ml cut point is from the Lowe et al. study
showing reduced breast cancer risk above this concentration [7] and is the top end of the
range recommended by a consortium of scientists and physicians to prevent many diseases
including breast cancer [29]. Participants were allowed to move between strata of 25(OH)D
according to changes in 25(OH)D concentration over the course of the observation periods.
Third, multivariate Cox regression was used to quantify the association between serum
25(OH)D and the risk of breast cancer after adjusting for the following breast cancer risk fac-
tors: age, BMI, smoking status, and calcium supplement intake. Indicator variables for study
of origin were included to adjust for differences in study methods and demographics. Serum
25(OH)D concentration was assessed as a categorical variable (<20 ng/ml, 20–39 ng/ml, 40–
59 ng/ml, and �60 ng/ml), as was calcium supplement intake (<1000 mg/day vs �1000 mg/
day) based on the NAM recommendation for bone health [28]. Serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tion and calcium supplement intake changed during the course of the studies for most partici-
pants; therefore, these variables were entered as time varying covariates (multiple values were
used for each participant to allow for changes in status over time). Age and BMI at baseline
were entered as continuous variables and smoking status at baseline was entered as a categori-
cal variable for “current smoker” (yes/no). Since breast cancers diagnosed in the first year
were likely present but undiagnosed at study entry, multivariate Cox regression was repeated
including only participants free of breast cancer at one year. Additionally, restricted cubic
splines with three knots in default locations were used to assess the nature of the association
between 25(OH)D (as a continuous variable) and cancer risk, including possible increased
risk in the upper serum concentrations. Analyses and graphics were done with the R software
(www.r-project.org).
Results
Baseline demographic characteristics of the pooled and individual cohorts are shown in

intake and a lower proportion of participants who were current smokers than either Lappe

 cohort. The 2007 Lappe cohort had the lowest baseline median serum 25(OH)D concentration
(28 ng/ml) and the GrassrootsHealth cohort had the highest (43 ng/ml).
During the observation periods, 77 women in the pooled cohort were diagnosed with
breast cancer (19 from the 2007 Lappe cohort, 44 from the 2017 Lappe cohort, and 14 from
the GrassrootsHealth cohort). The age-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer was 512
cases per 100,000 person-years in the pooled cohort (458 cases per 100,000 person-years in
the 2007 Lappe cohort, 619 cases per 100,000 person-years in the 2017 Lappe cohort, and
337 cases per 100,000 person-years in the GrassrootsHealth cohort).
Within the pooled cohort, results were similar for the three analyses used to investigate the
relationship between 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer (incidence rate comparison,
Kaplan-Meier plot, and multivariate Cox regression). First, breast cancer incidence rates
according to 25(OH)D group are shown in Fig 1. Rates were lower with higher serum 25(OH)
D categories (Fig 1). Comparing incidence rates, there was an 82% lower incidence rate of
breast cancer for �60 ng/ml vs <20 ng/ml (Rate Ratio = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04–0.62, P = 0.006).
Second, Kaplan-Meier curves comparing the proportion of breast cancer-free participants
by 25(OH)D group are shown in Fig 2. These curves were significantly different (P = 0.02),
with the highest proportion breast cancer-free at 4 years in the �60 ng/ml group (99.3%) and
the lowest proportion breast cancer-free in the <20 ng/ml group (96.8%). The proportion
with breast cancer was 78% lower for �60 ng/ml vs <20 ng/ml (P = 0.02) in the Kaplan-Meier
analysis.
Third, the results of multivariate Cox regression are shown in Table 2 and Fig 3. Women
with 25(OH)D concentrations �60 ng/ml had an 80% lower risk of breast cancer compared to
women with concentrations <20 ng/ml (HR = 0.20, P = 0.03), adjusting for age, BMI, smoking
status, calcium supplement intake, and study of origin (Table 2). The dose-response decrease
in breast cancer risk for women with 25(OH)D concentrations of 20–39 ng/ml and 40–59 ng/
ml vs <20 ng/ml are shown in Table 2. Age, BMI, smoking status, calcium supplement intake,
and study of origin were not significant predictors of breast cancer risk in this pooled cohort.
Among women free of breast cancer at one year (N = 4406), those with 25(OH)D concentra-
tions �60 ng/ml had a 93% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women with concentra-
tions <20 ng/ml (HR = 0.07, P = 0.02). Spline regression with 25(OH)D as a continuous

 variable revealed consistently lower risk of breast cancer with higher 25(OH)D concentration,
with no evidence of increased risk in the higher 25(OH)D concentrations (Fig 3).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted using 25(OH)D concentration quartiles, baseline
25(OH)D concentration only, excluding non-US residents in the GrassrootsHealth cohort,
and for each individual cohort. All revealed lower risk of breast cancer with higher 25(OH)D
concentration.
Discussion
In this pooled cohort, 25(OH)D concentration was significantly inversely associated with
breast cancer risk. All three analyses showed that women with 25(OH)D concentrations �60
ng/ml had significantly lower risk of breast cancer (~80%) compared to women with concen-
trations <20 ng/ml. There was a consistent decrease in breast cancer risk as 25(OH)D concen-
trations increased, with no evidence of increased risk in higher concentrations. Using a pooled
cohort allowed for analysis across a wider range of serum 25(OH)D concentrations than any
of the cohorts alone. While a novel approach, similar inclusion criteria were used for all three
cohorts and analyses were adjusted for study of origin and breast cancer risk factors to account
for differences in methodology and demographics.
The findings from this analysis support the previously reported inverse association between
25(OH)D and risk of breast cancer [7–18]. Another study assessed breast cancer risk across a
broad 25(OH)D concentration range with similar findings [7]. In that hospital-based case con-
trol study, Lowe et al. found that women with 25(OH)D concentrations >60 ng/ml had an

 83% lower risk of breast cancer than women with concentrations <20 ng/ml (P<0.001) [7].
The present study replicated these findings in a much larger, population-based study, thus
increasing generalizability, and it’s prospective design enabled use of 25(OH)D values before
diagnosis to distinguish between cause and effect.
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) trial did not find an association between assigned
vitamin D treatment group and breast cancer risk [34]; however, low dosage (400 IU/day) and
poor compliance (~50%) likely contributed to the lack of effect. A subsequent re-analysis of
the WHI data showed a significant reduction in breast cancer risk among women not taking a
vitamin D or calcium supplement before enrollment [35]. A few other nested case-control
studies have found no effect [36–38]. Those studies used a single 25(OH)D measurement at
enrollment to predict cancer risk over a long follow-up period. That study design does not
accommodate changes in vitamin D status over time and diminishes the predictive value of

Participants were allowed to move between strata of 25(OH)D according to changes in 25(OH)D concentration over the course of the observation
periods. Four-year cumulative breast cancer-free proportion was 99.3% among participants with 25(OH)D concentrations �60 ng/ml compared to
96.8% for those with 25(OH)D concentrations <20 ng/ml (the proportion with breast cancer was 78% lower for �60 ng/ml vs <20 ng/ml, P = 0.02).

 the pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D measurement. Grant has shown that the magnitude and signifi-
cance level for the relationship between 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk are
inversely related to the length of follow-up [39]. In this study, we performed a sensitivity analy-
sis using only baseline 25(OH)D concentration (rather than multiple 25(OH)D values as a
time varying covariate) and found a weaker association, also highlighting the diminished pre-
dictive value of 25(OH)D concentrations measured long before diagnosis.
Vitamin D may play a number of roles in the prevention of breast cancer development and
progression. The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, binds to the vitamin D
receptor (VDR) in normal breast epithelium and this complex regulates the cell cycle, pro-
motes differentiation, increases cell-to-cell adhesion, protects cells from DNA damage, regu-
lates cytokines, activates immune cells, and suppresses inflammation, all of which may act to
reduce malignant transformations [6]. In breast cancer cells, this complex also activates apo-
ptosis and other mechanisms to suppress tumor growth [6]. Additionally, other vitamin D
metabolites from recently discovered alternative pathways, such as 20(OH)D3 from the
CYP11A1-mediated metabolism of vitamin D, have been found to have preventive effects sim-
ilar to 1,25(OH)2D3 [40–42]. Studies with respect to cancer treatment have demonstrated vita-
min D’s ability to degrade neoplasm [43] and detailed genomics have shown the profound
effects vitamin D has on established neoplastic tissue [44]. These mechanisms of vitamin D
action provide a possible biological explanation for a causal association between 25(OH)D and
breast cancer risk and highlight the importance of assessing this association by the concentra-
tion of vitamin D metabolites in the serum and not by indirect measures such as treatment
group or supplement intake amount which tend to be inadequate and prone to bias.
Whether our findings reflect prevention of the primary tumor or treatment of early stage,
undiagnosed cancer by vitamin D is not clear. Of interest, the results for women who were
followed and free of breast cancer at the end of the first year revealed a stronger association
between 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk (HR: 0.07, P = 0.02 for �60 vs <20
ng/ml). There was only one case of breast cancer diagnosed after one year among those with
25(OH)D concentrations �60 ng/ml. This woman’s diagnosis occurred 2 months into year
two. Since there is a time delay between cancer initiation and diagnosis, many undiagnosed
cancers that existed at enrollment would be diagnosed during the first year. Therefore, it is
possible that analyses among women free of breast cancer at one year would better assess vita-
min D’s specific role in prevention rather than prevention and tumor arrest combined.
While the associations between breast cancer risk and age and calcium supplement intake
were in the expected directions (higher risk with increased age and lower risk with higher cal-
cium supplement intake), the effects of these risk factors did not reach statistical significance
in this analysis. Since an inclusion criterion for these cohorts was age 55 years and older, the
exclusion of younger women may have diminished the effect of age in this analysis. If younger
women were included in this study we would expect to see a significant increase in breast can-
cer risk with age and possibly the effect of age-related changes in vitamin D metabolism. Also,
information on dietary calcium intake was not available for the GrassrootsHealth cohort so
this analysis only assessed supplemental calcium intake. However, it is possible that dietary cal-
cium intake or total calcium intake would have been a significant predictor of breast cancer
risk. Additionally, the small proportion of current smokers may have limited the ability of this
study to detect an association between smoking status and breast cancer.
Strengths of this analysis include using a wider range of 25(OH)D concentrations than
most other studies and employing multiple analysis techniques with findings of a similar mag-
nitude. Also, using serum 25(OH)D concentration is a better indicator of vitamin D status and
statistically more powerful than using treatment group or intake amount because it captures
the effect of multiple vitamin D input sources (supplement, sun, and food), overcomes the

 inherent bias of treatment compliance, and accounts for inter-individual variability in dose
response [45]. All three cohorts participated in well-designed population-based studies that
included multiple measurements of serum 25(OH)D, allowing for changes in vitamin D status
over the course of the observation periods. Using multiple 25(OH)D measurements also over-
comes the issue of diminished predictive value of 25(OH)D measurements at enrollment over
long follow-up periods. The median amount of time between the 25(OH)D measurement
prior to diagnosis and the date of diagnosis was fairly short (~6 months).
Limitations of the analysis include the possible lack of generalizability to younger women
and men. However, since other studies have found a significant association between higher
25(OH)D concentrations and lower breast cancer risk in younger women [10–13,18], we
would expect that this inverse association is applicable to women of all ages. Also, while there
were no ethnic inclusion criteria, the vast majority of participants were non-hispanic white
(100% in the 2007 Lappe cohort, 99% in the 2017 Lappe cohort, and 96% in the Grassroot-
sHealth cohort) so these results may not be generalizable to persons of other ethnicities. While
inclusion criteria were matched across cohorts and analyses were adjusted for study of origin
and breast cancer risk factors, differences in demographics and methods (e.g. study design,
recruitment, and data collection tools) between the cohorts may have affected pooled analyses.
Median follow-up time was longer for the Lappe RCTs than the GrassrootsHealth prospective
cohort; however, all rate calculations used person-time denominators and analyses accounted
for varying lengths of follow-up. Additional limitations include the use of self-reported data
and not being able to control for some risk factors (family history of breast cancer, diet, and
estrogen use).
The current NAM recommendation of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) is based solely on bone health
[28], yet it is widely used as the target level for all health conditions. The findings from this
study suggest that breast cancer incidence could be substantially reduced by increasing
25(OH)D concentrations well above 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L). Fig 3 shows tight confidence
bands from about 30 to 55 ng/ml, which represents a decrease in breast cancer risk of ~38%.
The high end of that range, 55 ng/ml, falls within the 40 to 60 ng/ml range recommended by
a consortium of scientists and physicians to prevent several diseases including breast cancer
[29]. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 40–60 ng/ml (100–150 nmol/L) are within the
physiological range, as evidenced by traditionally living Africans who have a mean 25(OH)D
concentration of 46 ng/ml (range: 23–68) with 62% having concentrations between 40–60 ng/
ml [46]. In the range of 60 to 100 ng/ml, the downward trend continues. The widened confi-
dence bands stem from the decreasing number of women with 25(OH)D concentrations in
this upper range. Clarifying the nature of the association in this upper range should be a high
priority for future investigations.
Focusing on primary prevention and implementing evidence-based interventions is needed
to substantially decrease breast cancer incidence and associated mortality and economic costs.
The national cost of female breast cancer in 2010 was estimated to be $16.5 billion [47]. If
women raised their 25(OH)D concentration from their current mean of approximately 30 ng/
ml [48] to 55 ng/ml, the analysis from this study suggests that more than $6 billion could be
saved every year in the United States. Vitamin D status is a modifiable risk factor for breast
cancer, and increasing 25(OH)D concentrations via supplementation at the population level is
safe and affordable.
