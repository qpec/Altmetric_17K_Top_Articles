ABSTRACT 
Study Objective: To assess the prospective relationship between sleep and obesity in 
a paediatric population.  
Methods: We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, Web of 
Science and Cochrane  (up to 25th September  2017). Included studies were 
prospective, had follow-up >1 year, had duration of sleep at baseline, and measures 
of incidence of overweight or obesity and/or changes in body mass index (BMI) z-
score and BMI during follow-up.   We extracted relative risks or changes in BMI  z-
score or BMI and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled them using a random 
effect model.  
Results: Forty-two studies were included but, as there was significant heterogeneity, 
results are presented by age strata. Short sleep was associated with a greater risk of 
developing overweight or obesity in infancy (7 Studies, 14 738 participants, RR: 1.40; 
95% CI 1.19 to 1.65; p<0.001), early childhood (8 Studies, 31 104 participants, RR: 
1.57; 1.40 to 1.76; p<0.001), middle childhood (3 studies, 3 005 participants, RR: 
2.23; 2.18 to 2.27; p<0.001) and adolescence (3 studies, 26 652 participants, RR: 
1.30; 1.11 to 1.53; p<0.002). Sleep duration was also associated with a significant 
change in BMI z-score (14 studies, 18 cohorts, 31 665 participants) (mean difference 
-0.03; -0.04 to -0.01 per h sleep; P=0.001) and in BMI (16 studies, 24 cohorts, 24 894 
participants) (mean difference -0.03 kg/m2; -0.04 to -0.01 for every h of increase in 
sleep; P=0.001). 
Conclusions: Short sleep duration is a risk factor or marker of the development of 
obesity in infants, children and adolescents.

Statement of Significance  
This comprehensive systematic review of prospective studies shows that short sleep 
duration is a risk factor for weight gain and the development of obesity in infants, 
children and adolescents. The findings suggest that parents, medical practitioner and 
health care workers need to be aware of the importance of adequate sleep in 
children and that educational programmes should be developed to aid parents and 
children to improve sleep.  
 
Introduction 
Sufficient sleep is necessary for optimal daytime performance and wellbeing. Whilst 
babies and children spend more time asleep than adults, the amount of sleep that 
people get varies greatly.1 A decrease in the average duration of sleep,  alongside an 
increase in shift work and longer work hours, has been reported in westernised adult 
populations. Decreased sleep is associated with increased reporting of fatigue, 
tiredness, and excessive daytime sleepiness.1 Too little sleep is also associated with 
adverse health outcomes, including total mortality2, stroke and coronary heart 
disease,3 type 2 diabetes,, hypertension,5-6 and poor self-rated health.2 Usual sleep 
duration in children and adolescents is affected by age and a number of different 
cultural, social, psychological, behavioural, patho-physiological and environmental 
factors. Insufficient and disturbed sleep in children has been shown to be associated 
with performance deficits, including reduced school grades and mood and 
behavioural disruption, including hyperactivity and depression.7 
 
The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the last few decades and the 
World Health Organization has now declared it a global epidemic. In childhood, 
obesity can cause a number of psychosocial problems including low self-esteem and 
it has been suggested that it may be associated with the increased prevalence of 
type 2 diabetes seen in children.8 Furthermore, if continued into adulthood, it is 
likely to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Sleep 
deprivation also has major effects on metabolism, endocrine function and immune 
and haemostatic pathways.9

Early cross-sectional studies reported associations between short duration of sleep 
and the risk of obesity in children.10   New evidence from prospective longitudinal 
studies in children have now shown that short duration of sleep may precede the 
development of overweight or obesity.11 If causal, the potential public health 
implications would be far reaching. 
 
The aims of this article are (i) to systematically review published prospective 
population-based studies of the association between sleep duration and overweight 
or obesity in infants, children and adolescents, (ii) to carry out a meta-analysis to 
assess whether the evidence supports the presence of a prospective relationship 
between short sleep duration and obesity in children of different ages,  (iii) to obtain 
a quantitative estimate of the risk.  
 
Methods  
Search strategy and selection criteria  
We performed a systematic search to identify studies that reported the longitudinal 
association between sleep duration and overweight, obesity and body mass index.  
We searched the electronic databases PubMed, Medline, Embase Web of Science 
and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1966 to 25th Sept 2017). We 
used “Sleep terms” (sleep OR sleep disordered breathing OR bed time) in 
combination with “Obesity terms” (BMI OR body mass index OR weight OR waist 
circumference OR waist OR WHR OR waist hip ratio OR obese OR overweight OR 
adiposity OR adipose tissue OR anthropometry OR body composition OR body 
constitution) and “Study Population terms”, (children OR adolescents OR pediatrics 
OR pediatric OR paediatric OR paediatrics OR infant OR preschool) with “Study type 
terms” (prospective OR cohort OR longitudinal). Search strategies used subject 
headings and key words. Articles resulting from these searches and relevant 
references cited in those articles were reviewed. We did not use language 
restrictions.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
For inclusion, studies had to fulfil the following criteria: (a) original published article, 
(b) study in infants, children or adolescents (c) observational prospective design, (d) 
assessment of duration of sleep quantity as baseline exposure, (e) follow-up of > 1 
year for incident outcomes, (f) one of the following outcomes: i) incident cases of 
overweight and/or obesity ii) prospective changes in BMI z-score or iii) changes in 
BMI. 
 
Studies were excluded if (a) case-control design was used; (b) cross-sectional 
associations were reported, (c) only meeting abstract or unpublished material 
available or, (d) if all individuals had sleep disordered breathing. If multiple published 
reports from the same study were available, we included only the one with the most 
detailed information for both exposure and outcome.  When data was not readily 
available from published reports, we wrote to the authors to ask for raw data. 
 
Data extraction 
Three reviewers (MAM, MK & FPC) independently extracted the data.  Differences 
about inclusion of studies were resolved by arbitration with the co-authors.  From a 
total of 4,683 search records, 2,569 studies were identified after duplicates had been 
removed (Figure 1).  Full text evaluation of 127 studies identified 42 studies that had 
data suitable for meta-analysis (20 for overweight/obesity, 14 for BMI z-score and 16 
for BMI). Relevant data included the first authors surname, year of publication, 
country of origin and details of the population studied (including the number of 
participants), recruitment year, number of recoded cases of obesity, BMI, 
participants’ age, method used to determine sleep, category for “short” sleep, 
outcome assessment method, odds ratios or relative risks of overweight/obesity, 
change in BMI z-score or in BMI, corresponding 95% CI, and covariates adjusted in 
the statistical analysis.

Exposure 
Sleep in children and adolescent is different from that of adults and although by age 
10 sleep is similar to that of adults, the total time is longer (10 h).12 The definition of 
“short sleep” was defined by age as stated in Table 1. For odds ratios, short sleepers 
were compared to both middle and long sleepers, although in some studies they 
were compared to a reference category.  
 
Outcome  
Unless stated otherwise in Table 1, obesity in children was defined either as BMI 
>95th and overweight as >85th percentile according to local national growth charts or 
by international growth charts where the thresholds for obesity is defined as the 
percentile which passes through BMI >30 kg/m2 at age 18 years. Both BMI z-scores 
also called BMI standard deviation (s.d.) scores, and changes in BMI,  were also used 
for outcome data.  The former are measures of relative weight adjusted for child age 
and sex. BMI z-scores are calculated relative to an external reference.  
 
Populations 
For the purpose of this study children were categorized into four sub-groups 
according to the average age at the time of the baseline assessment: infants (0 to <3 
years); early childhood (3 to <9 years); middle childhood (9 to <12 years) and 
adolescents (12-18 years). 
 
Confounders  
Studies adjusted for various confounders including age, sex, ethnicity, income, 
exercise etc.  (Table 1). With consideration to the causal pathway, estimates from 
the most adjusted model were used, for the meta-analysis where appropriate,. 
However, in some cases of papers using BMI z-score as outcome, age and BMI were 
also adjusted for, suggesting possible overadjustment.  Mean age of the populations, 
country and sample size were collected and used in stratified analyses of 
heterogeneity, publication bias and sensitivity.

Statistical Analysis  
The quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis was evaluated by the Downs 
& Black Quality Index score system using a validated checklist for assessing the 
quality of the studies.13 For the assessment of non-randomized studies, the 
maximum score is 20. To estimate the quantitative relation between short sleep 
duration and overweight or obesity, we calculated an estimate of relative risk (risk 
ratio RR) from either odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals or regression coefficient β (95% CIs) for changes in BMI z-score or BMI as a 
continuous outcome. When studies did not report the necessary data, we requested 
them from the authors. If the SE of either the RR or β were not supplied it was 
algebraically computed from the 95% CIs, where possible. We used a random effect 
model weighted by the inverse of the variance14 and by comparison with the 
reference category, we estimated the pooled risk and 95% CI of risk of development 
of overweight/obesity or the mean difference in BMI z-score or BMI with each 
additional hour of sleep.  The heterogeneity among studies was tested by Q-statistic 
and quantified by H-statistic and I2-statistic.15 Funnel plot asymmetry was used to 
detect publication bias, and Egger’s regression test was applied to measure funnel 
plot asymmetry16-17 where appropriate. ‘Trim and fill’ method was used to attempt 
to correct for publication bias.18 The influence of individual studies, from which the 
meta-analysis estimates are derived, was examined by omitting one study at a time 
to see the extent to which inferences depend on a particular study or group of 
studies (sensitivity analysis). Subgroup analysis was carried out to assess possible 
sources of heterogeneity and to check for the potential impact of geographic 
location on the relationship between sleep and obesity. Egger’s test and ‘trim and 
fill’ were performed using Stata version 14 (Stata corporation, College Station, TX, 
USA). Random effects meta-regression was used to determine if follow-up was 
significantly associated with heterogeneity. Other statistical analyses were 
performed using Review Manager software version 5. The systematic review and the 
meta-analysis were carried out in line with the PRISMA guidelines for non-
randomised studies, with the appropriate exclusion of non-relevant items.19

Results 
Characteristics of Study Cohorts 
Of a total of 4,683 studies identified from the searches (Figure 1), after exclusion of 
ineligible studies (Supp Table S1 for details of the studies and the reason for 
exclusion) 42 studies (63 cohorts) met the inclusion criteria for the qualitative 
synthesis and had data suitable for the different sets of analyses. Studies that 
reported data for boys and girls, for different age groups or for different nationalities 
were treated as separate cohorts.  Ages at the start of the study ranged from 0 to 12 
years (Table 1). There were 20 studies for obesity (21 cohorts across the different 
age groups),20-39 14 studies for BMI z-score (18 cohorts across the age groups)22,25,40-
50 and 16 studies for BMI (24 cohorts across the different age groups).27-29,35,42,51-61 
Overall, for sleep and obesity the meta-analysis included 75,499 participants from 9 
different countries, for BMI 24,894 from 9 countries and for BMI z-score 31,665 from 
8 countries.   
 
Incidence of overweight and/or obesity in short sleepers 
Data on the relationship between sleep and overweight and/or obesity by age 
groups are shown in Figure 2. In the pooled analysis, short sleep was associated with 
an increased risk of overweight or obesity in the combined group (RR: 1.58 [95% CI 
1.35, 1.85]; P<0.001). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 92%, 
p<0.001) with evidence of publication bias (Supp Figure S1a) (Egger’s test p=0.005).  
The addition of seven point estimates identified by the ‘trim and fill’ method 
resulted in a revised pooled estimate of 1.42 [1.12, 1.81] but still remained 
significant. In a sub-group analysis by age group seven cohorts included infants 0 to 
<3 years at baseline. The pooled relative risk was 1.40 [1.19, 1.65], P<0.001, with no 
statistical evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 40%; p=0.13). Eight cohorts included 
children 3 to <9 years at baseline. The pooled relative risk was 1.57 [1.40, 1.76], 
P<0.001, with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 23%; p=0.25). Three 
cohorts included children 9 to <12 years at baseline. The pooled relative risk was 
2.23 [2.18, 2.27], P<0.001 with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%; p=0.41). Three

cohorts included children 12-18 years at baseline. The pooled relative risk was 1.30 
[1.11, 1.53], P=0.002 with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%; p=0.49) (Figure 2). 
 
Sub group analysis by continent in the combined age groups 
Sub-group analysis by continent yields risk ratios ranging from 1.26 to 2.19 across 
the three sub-groups; each with statistically significant results. Heterogeneity 
estimates ranged from 0% to 92%, with no evidence of heterogeneity in the Australia 
and Oceania sub-group (Supp Table S2). 
 
Sensitivity analysis  
Sensitivity analysis by deleting one study at a time yields risk ratios that are still 
statistically significant for each sub-group (Supp Table S3a). The heterogeneity 
estimates range from 0% to 49%. In infants, the heterogeneity was reduced to zero 
by the removal of the study of Bolijn et al.25  In early childhood, the heterogeneity 
was reduced to zero by the removal of the study of Scharf et al.31  In middle 
childhood and in adolescents there was no overall heterogeneity (see Supp Table 
S3a). Removal of two studies27,39 with quality scores <15 has no major effect on the 
estimates (see Supp Table S4). Follow-up time was not significantly associated with 
heterogeneity (p=0.878 by meta-regression).  
 
Short sleep and BMI Z-score 
In the pooled analysis, short sleep was associated with a decrease in BMI z-score per 
hour of increase in sleep (RR: -0.03 [-0.04, -0.01]; P=0.0001) (Figure 3). In the pooled 
analysis there was significant heterogeneity between studies ((I2 = 54%, p< 0·003) 
(Eggers test p=0.054)) (Supp Figure S1b). In a sub-group analysis by age group, there 
was no overall statistical heterogeneity, yet whilst the risk estimates were 
statistically significant in infants and early childhood they were not statistically 
significant in middle childhood or adolescents. (p=0.45) (Figure 3).  The ‘trim and fill’ 
method did not produce any correction to the original estimates.

Sensitivity analysis by deleting one study in the sub-groups at a time is shown in the 
online supplement. In middle childhood the heterogeneity was reduced to 0% by the 
removal of either Michels et al48 or Storfer-Isser et al (girls).47 Likewise, in 
adolescents it was reduced to zero by the removal of Maume et al.50 Supp Table 
S3b). The removal of two studies with quality scores <15 has no major effect on the 
results (Table A4). Follow-up time was not significantly associated with 
heterogeneity (p=0.837 by meta-regression). 
 
Short sleep and BMI 
Data on the relationship between sleep and change in BMI are shown in the online 
supplement  (Supp Figure S2). In the pooled analysis, short sleep was associated 
with a decrease in BMI per hour of increase in sleep (RR: -0.03 [-0.04, -0.01]; 
P=0.001), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80%, P<0·001) and 
evidence of publication bias; Eggers test p 0.001) (Supp Figure S1c). The ‘trim and fill’ 
method did not produce any correction to the original estimates. In a sub-group 
analysis by age groups, there was some heterogeneity of effect (p=0.03) with the 
effect being greater in children aged 3 to <9 years (Supp Figure S2). Sensitivity 
analysis is shown in the online supplement. In middle childhood the heterogeneity 
was reduced to zero by the removal of Seegers et al35 (Supp Table S3c). The removal 
of eight cohorts (5 studies)27,42,51,57,58 with quality scores <15 has no major effect on 
the results (Supp Table S4). Follow-up time was not significantly associated with 
heterogeneity (p=0.836 by meta-regression). 
 
Discussion 
This study provides a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature and 
quantitative estimates of the longitudinal associations between short sleep and 
overweight or obesity, change in BMI z-scores, or change in BMI. For sleep and 
overweight or obesity, the pooled effect is strong.  The association is supported by 
the significant relationships between hours of sleep and changes in both BMI z-
scores and BMI. Sub-group analyses show that the effect of short sleep on risk of 
overweight or obesity was significant for each age group.

Strengths and limitations 
The results are of interest for a number of reasons. Firstly, whilst our previous meta-
analysis showed that obese children were more likely to be short sleepers,10 it only 
reported evidence from cross-sectional studies and could not rule out reverse 
causality62; these results extend those previous observations. Secondly, the 
association is consistent in different populations. Thirdly, they demonstrate that the 
effect on the risk of overweight or obesity appears to be consistent across all age 
groups. Although the meta-analysis detected significant heterogeneity between 
studies for both infants and early childhood this was reduced to zero by the removal 
of one study from each group.  Furthermore, when we attempted to correct for 
publication bias by using the ‘trim and fill’ method, the pooled estimate was only 
marginally reduced and maintained statistical significance. Finally, the categorical 
results were corroborated by the meta-analysis of regression coefficients from 
studies looking at both change in BMI z-score and change in BMI. These show that 
longer sleep duration in children is associated with a reduced age-related weight 
gain. 
 
These results are important as studies suggest that there has been a worldwide 
decrease in night time sleep duration63 and a study conducted in 2004 suggested 
that children got less sleep than was recommended at the time.64  The National 
Sleep Foundation (NSF) in America recommends different sleep durations for 
different age groups. The recommendations, as stated on their website are as 
follows: newborn (0-3 months), 14-17 hours; infant (4-11 months), 12-15 hours; 
toddler (1-2 years), 11-14 hours; preschool-age (3-5 years), 10-13 hours; school-age 
(6-13 years), 9-11 hours; and teenage (14-17 years), 8-10 hours.65  However, whether 
‘an hour’ of sleep reduction or extension has the same effect on metabolic outcomes 
at different ages of development from infancy to adolescence is not known. 
 
There are some limitations. The quality of the data cannot go beyond the quality of 
the individual studies included. However, the removal of studies with quality scores  
<15 out of a maximum of 20 had no appreciable effect on the results. The results can

only be representative of the studies that have been included and are unable to 
provide a representative inference of all studies published. There are limitations 
associated with the measurement of the variables of interest. The majority of the 
included studies have assessed sleep by means of self-reported (child or parental) 
questionnaires. Only one used the gold-standard polysomnography36 and three used 
accelerometry.29,45,56 Furthermore, in many of the studies it is the parents who 
reported children’s sleep duration and whilst this is necessary for young children it 
does require that the parent has a good level of awareness of their child's sleep 
schedule. As described in the methods section, the diagnostic classification of 
overweight and obesity varied across studies.  A meta-analysis of observational 
studies is open to important fallacies in that it cannot directly control for confound-
ing and therefore may be open to biased estimates. Some papers adjusted for age 
and sex in BMI z-score models. The adjustment was unnecessary as both variables 
were used for BMI standardization (although continuous age might slightly improve 
the estimation). However, we are unable to derive estimates by excluding age and 
sex from the models. Whilst this is an inextricable problem, any overadjustment 
would result in an underestimation of the true effect, hence indicating that the 
relationship we describe might be conservative and even stronger, had 
overadjustment been avoided.  
 
Potential mechanisms 
This meta-analysis of prospective studies supports a causal relationship between 
short sleep and subsequent weight gain and obesity in children.   There are several 
lines of evidence to suggest plausible mechanisms.  Sleep deprivation is associated 
with various hormonal responses which may lead to appetite dysregulation, affecting 
both hunger and satiety.  These include lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels,66,67 
which would increase appetite. Sleep restriction has effects on endocannabinoids 
which regulate a variety of central nervous system processes including appetite.68  
Changes in factors which would affect metabolism, including insulin and glucose 
metabolism, cortisol, growth hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone are also 
important.69-74 Sleeping less would give more time to eat and to engage in other

sedentary activities, as exemplified by children and adolescents who like to stay up 
late to play on their computer or watch TV or to interact with social networks whilst 
snacking.69 More opportunities to eat energy dense foods and concomitant tiredness 
may led to less engagement in physical activity.69  
 
Activation of inflammatory pathways by short sleep may be implicated in the 
development of obesity75 and it can up- and down-regulate the expression of genes 
involved in oxidative stress and metabolism.76 Finally, insufficient sleep is associated 
with alterations in mood, attention, impulse control, motivation, and judgment, all 
of these factors could potentially influence eating behaviours, energy intake, and 
ultimately BMI in children.77 
 
Short-term, acute, laboratory, and cross-sectional observational studies indicate that 
adverse changes in sleep are associated with adverse changes in insulin and glucose 
response but can be reversed when sleep quantity and quality are restored.78 The 
detrimental effects of sustained and prolonged chronic sleep however, may not be 
reversible leading to long term adverse health and safety consequences.79  
An fMRI study has shown that acute sleep deprivation enhances the brain's response 
to hedonic food stimuli.80 Compared with sleep, total sleep deprivation was 
associated with an increased activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex in 
response to food images, which was independent of calorie content and pre-scan 
hunger ratings. These results suggest that sleep loss enhances hedonic stimulus 
processing in the brain underlying the drive to consume food.80 
 
Whilst the results of a clinical trial to assess the feasibility of increasing sleep 
duration to a healthy length (approximately 7½ h in an adult population) and the 
effect of sleep extension on body weight are still  awaited,81 studies in adults have 
shown that insufficient sleep can impair one’s ability to lose fat mass-associated 
weight.82

Implications  
Sleep is not a passive state but is an active process in which memory consolidation, 
tissue restoration, metabolic and haemostatic processes occur.83 The findings from 
this study suggests that sleep may be an important and potentially modifiable risk 
factor (or marker) of future obesity and ensuing type 2 diabetes in early life.  Our 
study highlights the need for a greater awareness of the importance of adequate 
sleep in children both for parents and for medical practitioners. Educational 
programmes could be used to empower parents and children to improve sleep 
quality and maximize quantity.  
 
Conclusion 
Short sleep duration is a risk factor or marker of the development of obesity in 
infants, children and adolescents.
