Summary
Background The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) has mobilised efforts among 180 parties 
to combat the global tobacco epidemic. This study examined the association between highest-level implementation of key 
tobacco control demand-reduction measures of the WHO FCTC and smoking prevalence over the treaty’s first decade.
Methods We used WHO data from 126 countries to examine the association between the number of highest-level 
implementations of key demand-reduction measures (WHO FCTC articles 6, 8, 11, 13, and 14) between 2007 and 2014 
and smoking prevalence estimates between 2005 and 2015. McNemar tests were done to test differences in the proportion 
of countries that had implemented each of the measures at the highest level between 2007 and 2014. Four linear 
regression models were computed to examine the association between the predictor variable (the change between 2007 
and 2014 in the number of key measures implemented at the highest level), and the outcome variable (the percentage 
point change in tobacco smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015).
Findings Between 2007 and 2014, there was a significant global increase in highest-level implementation of all key 
demand-reduction measures. The mean smoking prevalence for all 126 countries was 24·73% (SD 10·32) in 2005 
and 22·18% (SD 8·87) in 2015, an average decrease in prevalence of 2·55 percentage points (SD 5·08; relative 
reduction 10·31%). Unadjusted linear regression showed that increases in highest-level implementations of key 
measures between 2007 and 2014 were significantly associated with a decrease in smoking prevalence between 
2005 and 2015). Each additional measure implemented at the highest level was associated with an average decrease 
in smoking prevalence of 1·57 percentage points (95% CI –2·51 to –0·63, p=0·001) and an average relative decrease 
of 7·09% (–12·55 to –1·63, p=0·011). Controlling for geographical subregion, income level, and WHO FCTC party 
status, the per-measure decrease in prevalence was 0·94 percentage points (–1·76 to –0·13, p=0·023) and an average 
relative decrease of 3·18% (–6·75 to 0·38, p=0·079). This association was consistent across all three control 
variables.
Interpretation Implementation of key WHO FCTC demand-reduction measures is significantly associated with 
lower smoking prevalence, with anticipated future reductions in tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. These 
findings validate the call for strong implementation of the WHO FCTC in the WHO’s Global Action Plan for the 
Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013–2020, and in advancing the UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goal 3, setting a global target of reducing tobacco use and premature mortality from non-communicable 
diseases by a third by 2030.

Introduction
Tobacco use is the single greatest preventable cause of 
death in the world. Globally, tobacco kills nearly 6 million 
people a year and is a risk factor for six of the eight leading 
causes of death.1 Moreover, global tobacco use exerts an 
extraordinary toll on economic wellbeing, causing more 
than US$1 trillion in health-care costs and lost 
productivity annually.2
In response to the growing tobacco epidemic, WHO’s 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was 
adopted in 2003 and came into force in 2005. The 
WHO FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that obligates 
180 parties (179 countries plus the European Union as of 
March, 2017) to implement a broad array of supply and 
demand reduction tobacco control measures.3
To help countries meet their commitments to the 
treaty and implement important policies that prevent 
and reduce tobacco use, in 2008, WHO developed the 
MPOWER technical assistance package corresponding 
to WHO FCTC articles: article 6 (raise taxes on 
tobacco), article 8 (protect people from tobacco smoke), 
articles 11 and 12 (warn about the dangers of tobacco), 
article 13 (enforce bans on tobacco advertising, 
promotion, and sponsorship [TAPS]), article 14 (offer

help to quit tobacco use), and article 20 (monitoring 
tobacco use).1
Evidence shows that the WHO FCTC has accelerated 
implementation of measures in three crucial policy 
domains: TAPS bans,4 smoke-free laws,5 and health 
warnings on tobacco packaging.6 Studies have shown 
that strong implementation of WHO FCTC key 
demand-reduction measures have led to dose-response 
effects for comprehensive smoke-free laws7 and pictorial 
health warnings.8,9 Although research shows that tobacco 
tax and price increases are the fastest acting and most 
effective of all the key measures, progress has been much 
slower in this policy domain.
So far, however, only two studies have addressed the 
important issue of whether WHO FCTC policies are 
associated with reductions in tobacco use at the 
population level. Dubray and colleagues10 found that 
overall, countries with higher MPOWER composite 
scores in 2008 experienced greater decreases in current 
tobacco smoking between the years 2006 and 2009. 
Anderson and colleagues11 used WHO report data from 
201012 to generate policy percentage scores (from 0% to 
100%) for articles 6, 8, 11, 13, and 14. They found a 
negative association between the overall combined policy 
score at a single timepoint (2010) and differences in 
smoking prevalence between 2010 and 2015.
Our study reports a broader and more comprehensive 
assessment of the effect of five key WHO FCTC 
demand-reduction measures on tobacco 
smoking 
prevalence than both previous studies. Our analyses 
included a cohort of 126 countries: every country where 
tobacco smoking prevalence trend estimates for 2005 and 
2015 were available.13 The outcome variable was the 
change in smoking prevalence over a 10-year period (2005 
to 2015), corresponding to the first decade of the WHO 
FCTC. The predictor variable for each of the 126 countries 
was the change in the number of key measures that had 
been implemented at the highest level between 2007 (the 
first year that WHO examined implementation of these 
measures) and 2014 (the most recent examination) rather 
than the single timepoint measure used in the two 
previous studies.10,11 Both previous studies performed 
their analyses with the four-point implementation scale, 
which gave equal weight to any advance, regardless of 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar for 
studies published in English or French from database inception 
to Nov 30, 2016. We also askded tobacco control experts 
about any articles that might have been submitted or in press. 
We also searched Google Scholar and Google for grey 
literature. Two studies were identified that examined the 
empirical relationship between the implementation of tobacco 
control demand measures of the WHO FCTC and smoking 
prevalence. First, Dubray and colleagues (2015) found that 
overall, countries with higher MPOWER composite scores in 
2008 experienced greater decreases in current tobacco 
smoking between the years 2006 and 2009. Fewer than 
60 countries had sufficient data to meet the inclusion criteria. 
Second, Anderson and colleagues (2016) found a negative 
association between higher policy scores (articles 6, 8, 11, 13, 
and 14 in 2010) and change in smoking prevalence between 
2010 and 2015.
Added value of this study
Our study offers a comprehensive global assessment of the 
effect of the change in progress of highest-level 
implementation of key tobacco control demand-reduction 
measures of the WHO FCTC on reductions in smoking 
prevalence over the treaty’s first decade. First, our analyses were 
done with a cohort of 126 countries for which WHO had 
computed trend estimates of smoking prevalence for 2005 and 
2015. Second, the outcome variable was the difference in 
smoking prevalence over a broader 10-year period (2005–15), 
corresponding to the first decade of the WHO FCTC. Third, the 
predictor variable for each of the 126 countries was the change 
in the number of key demand-reduction measures that had 
been implemented at the highest level between 2007 (WHO’s 
first analysis) and 2014 (WHO’s most recent analysis), rather 
than the single timepoint measures used in Dubray and 
colleagues’ and Anderson and colleagues’ studies. Our study’s 
use of changes in the number of highest-level implementations 
allows for a more rigorous assessment of whether increases in 
implementation of tobacco control demand-reduction 
measures were associated with decreases in prevalence. 
Additionally, the present study assessed the effect of five key 
WHO FCTC measures on changes in smoking prevalence over a 
10-year period, whereas the other studies examined the 
association of an aggregate policy score with change in 
smoking prevalence over a 3-year (Dubray and colleagues) or a 
5-year (Anderson and colleagues) period.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although the progress of WHO FCTC ratification has been 
remarkable (179 countries and the European Union, covering 
nearly 90% of the world’s population), implementation of the 
treaty has been slow and has not always been at the highest 
level. The present results show that countries that have 
implemented key demand-reduction measures of the WHO 
FCTC at the highest level have experienced significant decreases 
in smoking prevalence, with the magnitude of the decrease 
being proportional to the number of highest-level 
implementations. Finally, these results support the call for full 
implementation of the WHO FCTC in WHO’s Global Action Plan 
for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 
2013–2020 and Sustainable Development Goal 3.

whether it fulfilled parties’ obligations to meet the WHO 
FCTC guidelines. By contrast, the present study focuses 
on the effect of fully implementing a policy at the highest 
level, the level acknowledged by scientific literature as the 
most effective for reducing tobacco use.
This assessment study was a rigorous test of the global 
progress of the implementation of key demand-reduction 
measures over the first decade of the WHO FCTC. We 
tested the hypothesis that countries implementing 
policies at the highest level experienced significant 
decreases in current tobacco smoking prevalence. 
Examination of the association between differences in 
the putative cause (highest-level implementation of 
demand-reduction measures) and differences in the 
outcome (smoking prevalence) conforms to best practices 
in policy assessment.14 Finally, among WHO FCTC 
parties, the assessment addressed the question of 
whether parties that had implemented a greater number 
of demand-reduction measures at a level approximately 
equivalent to the guidelines of the corresponding WHO 
FCTC articles had greater reductions in tobacco smoking 
prevalence over the first decade of the treaty than did 
countries with fewer measures.
Methods
Study design and key measures included 
This study represents an analysis of WHO data from 
126 countries. Data on five key WHO FCTC demand-
reduction measures (referred to as key measures) in 2007 
and 2014 were taken from the WHO Report on the Global 
Tobacco Epidemic 2015,15 articles 6 (tobacco taxes), 
8 (protection from exposure to tobacco smoke), 11 (health 
warnings), 13 (TAPS), and 14 (tobacco cessation). 
Article 12 was not included because first, the criteria for 
highest level of achievement changed between 2007 and 
2014, and second, media campaigns and other article 12 
interventions are of a transient nature (could occur 
sporadically). MPOWER also calls for countries to 
monitor tobacco use and prevention policies (article 20), 
but although monitoring is a crucial tobacco control 
activity, it is not a demand-reduction measure and thus 
was not included in the analyses.
WHO assesses the level of achievement of key 
measures on a scale of 2–5, where 2 is the lowest level, 
and 5 is the highest level (1 = no data available). Figure 1 
presents the criteria for the highest level of achievement 
for each measure. For all 126 countries, each of the 
five key measures was allocated 1 point in 2007 and 
1 point in 2014 if it reached the highest level of 
achievement or 0 points if it did not. A country could also 
score –1 point if a highest-level policy was in place in 
2007 but not in 2014. For each country, the number of 
measures at the highest level was summed for 2007 and 
for 2014. The predictor variable was the 2014 total minus 
the 2007 total for each country. 
Covariates
The World Bank classifies countries by gross national 
income per capita into four categories: low income 
(US $1035 or less), low-middle income ($1036–$4085), 
upper-middle-income ($4086–$12 615), and high income 
($12 616 or more).16 A country was classified as a WHO 
FCTC party if it had ratified the WHO FCTC before the 
2014 WHO MPOWER data were collected (1=WHO 
FCTC party; 2=WHO FCTC non-party).
The 22 UN geographical subregions are Eastern Africa, 
Middle Africa, Northern Africa, Southern Africa, Western 
Africa, Northern America, Caribbean, Central America,

to code all subregions (0 vs 1).
Outcome variable
The outcome variable was the change in estimated 
tobacco smoking prevalence for each country between 
2005 and 2015 (2015 prevalence minus the 2005 
prevalence). We used the estimates of tobacco smoking 
prevalence in individuals aged 15 years or older derived 
by WHO for 2005 and 2015 to compute the outcome 
variable. Estimates for 116 countries were extracted from 
the WHO Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of 
Tobacco Smoking 2015;15 prevalence estimates for an 
additional ten countries computed after the publication 
of the report were provided by WHO. Data for use of 
smokeless tobacco are scant in most countries; thus, it 
was not possible to include prevalence trend estimates 
for smokeless use.
WHO derived prevalence estimates from a Bayesian 
meta-regression of data from surveys done between 1990 
and 2014 in each country. Data were sourced from 
country-provided surveys submitted to the WHO FCTC 
Implementation Database and the WHO Comprehensive 
Information Systems for Tobacco Control database.15
Statistical analysis
McNemar tests were done to test differences in the 
proportion of countries that had implemented each of 
the measures at the highest level between 2007 and 2014. 
Four linear regression models were conducted to 
examine the association between the predictor variable 
(the change between 2007 and 2014 in the number of key 
measures implemented at the highest level and the 
relative change), and the outcome variable (the 
percentage point change and the relative change in 
tobacco smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015). 
Diagnostic tests showed that the linear regression model 
was appropriate for the analysis with respect to the 
assumptions of linearity, normality of percentage point 
change in smoking prevalence, and homoscedasticity.
Model 1 was an unadjusted analysis in all 126 countries 
and for WHO FCTC non-parties only (n=10), and then 
for WHO FCTC parties only (n=116). Model 2 added the 
following covariates: WHO FCTC party status, 2016 
World Bank Income Classification, and UN subregion. 
Interactions between each of the covariates and the 
predictor variable were also examined to test whether 
the association between WHO FCTC policy imple-
mentation and change in prevalence varied across each 
covariate. Model 3 was an unadjusted analysis for the 
relative change in tobacco smoking prevalence between 
2005 and 2015 in all 126 countries and then for WHO 
FCTC parties only and for WHO FCTC non-parties. 
Model 4 tested the association between the change in the 
highest-level key measure implementation and the 
change in smoking prevalence expressed as a relative 
change in all 126 countries (with the covariates included 
in model 2). Analyses were done with SPSS (version 22).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The lead and corresponding authors 
(SG and GF, respectively) had full access to all the data in 
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
Smoking prevalence estimates were available for 126 (65%) 
of 194 WHO member states. According to the 2016 
World Bank classification, 45 (36%) were high-income 
countries, 32 (25%) were upper-middle-income countries, 
32 (25%) were lower-middle-income countries, and 
17 (13%) were low-income countries (appendix). Smoking 
prevalence estimates for 2005 and 2015, as well as 
percentage point change between 2005 and 2015 for each 
country are shown in the appendix. Nauru and Niue were 
not categorised by the World Bank; therefore, following 
WHO’s standard procedure for countries without a 
World Bank classification, gross domestic product  data 
from the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook were 
used, resulting in both countries being classified as upper-
middle-income countries. In FCTC parties (n=116), the 
mean treaty ratification date was 2005, where 116 (70%) of 
the included countries had become parties to the treaty. 
Andorra, Argentina, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, 
Indonesia, Morocco, Switzerland, the USA, and Zimbabwe 
were considered FCTC non-parties.

Table 1 presents the number of countries with key 
tobacco control demand-reduction measures in 2007 and 
2014. By 2014, only one country (1%) had implemented all 
five key measures at the highest level, four countries (3%) 
had four measures, ten countries (8%) had three measures, 
20 countries (16%) had two measures, 40 countries (32%) 
had one measure, and 51 countries (40%) had 
implemented no measures at the highest level. The 
appendix shows the change in scores for each key 
measure by country. A mean of 1·04 measures (SD 1·14) 
were implemented at the highest level by 2014. 
Overall, there was a significant increase in the proportion 
of highest-level implementations in each key measure 
between 2007 and 2014 (table 1). In the 116 WHO FCTC 
parties, there was a significant increase between 2007 and 
2014 in highest-level implementations in all five policy 
domains (p<0·0001 for articles 6, 8, 11, and 13; p=0·021 for 
article 14); by contrast, there was no significant increase in 
any of the key measures in the ten non-parties.
The mean smoking prevalence for all 126 countries was 
24·73% (SD 10·32) in 2005 and 22·18% (8·87) in 2015, a 
mean decrease in prevalence of 2·55 percentage points 
(5·08; relative reduction of 10·31%; appendix). In WHO 
FCTC parties, the mean smoking prevalence in 2005 was 
24·74% (10·41) and 22·11% (8·84) in 2015, a mean 
decrease of 2·62 percentage points (5·13; relative 
reduction of 10·63%). In WHO FCTC non-parties, the 
mean smoking prevalence in 2005 was 24·72% (9·79) and 
22·97% (9·65) in 2015, a mean decrease of 1·75 percentage 
points (4·63; relative reduction of 7·07%).
From 2005 to 2015, smoking prevalence decreased in 
90 (71%) of 126 countries, increased in 24 countries 
(19%), and did not change (a change of <1 percentage 
point) in 12 countries (10%; appendix).
In an unadjusted linear regression (model 1; table 2), 
increases in highest-level implementations of key measures 
between 2007 and 2014 were significantly associated with a 
decrease in smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015 
(p=0·001). Specifically, an increase of one additional 
highest-level implementation was associated with a mean 
decrease in smoking prevalence of 1·57 percentage points 
(95% CI –2·51 to –0·63). Figure 2 presents the scatterplot 
of the 126 countries showing this association.
In WHO FCTC parties only, an increase of one 
additional highest-level implementation was associated 
with a mean decrease in smoking prevalence of 
1·44 percentage points (p<0·005; 95% CI –2·44 to –0·44). 
In non-parties, an increase of one additional highest-level 
implementation was associated with a mean decrease in 
smoking prevalence of 2·94 percentage points (95% CI 
–6·03 to 0·15), although this was not significant because 
of the small sample size (n=10).
In an adjusted model with all 126 countries, controlling for 
WHO FCTC status, World Bank income, and UN subregion, 
the association remained significant (p=0·023 model 2; 
table 2). Specifically, each additional measure implemented 
at the highest level was associated with an average decrease 
in smoking prevalence of 0·94 percentage points (95% CI 
–1·76 to –0·13) between 2005 and 2015. In WHO FCTC 
parties, each additional measure implemented at the highest 
level was associated with aw mean decrease in smoking 
prevalence of 0·98 percentage points (95% CI –1·81 to 
–0·14, p=0·022; analyses not shown in table 2).
The strong association between the number of key 
measures implemented and reductions in smoking 
prevalence did not differ across UN subregion, World 
Bank income category, or whether or not the country was 
a WHO FCTC party (all interactions p>0·30 after 
Bonferroni adjustment; analyses not shown in table 2).

The unadjusted and adjusted analyses for the relative 
change in smoking prevalence are presented in  table 3. 
Each additional highest-level implementation was 
associated with a relative decrease in smoking prevalence 
of 7·09% in the unadjusted analysis (95% CI –12·55 to 
–1·63, p=0·011,) and 3·18% in the adjusted analysis 
(–6·75 to 0·38, p=0·079). Again, this association did not 
differ by UN subregion, World Bank income category, or 
party status (all interactions p>0·30 after Bonferroni 
adjustment; analyses not shown in table 3).
Discussion
Between 2007 and 2014, there was a significant increase in 
the proportion of countries that implemented each of the 
five key measures of the WHO FCTC at the highest level. 
This was consistent with the WHO FCTC Impact 
Assessment Expert Group’s conclusion that the WHO 
FCTC has increased implementation of strong tobacco 
control measures.18 Additionally, increases in the number 
of highest-level implementations between 2007 and 2014 
were associated with significantly greater reductions in 
smoking prevalence over the WHO FCTC’s first decade. 
In all 126 countries, each additional measure implemented 
at the highest level between 2007 and 2014 was associated 
with an average decrease in smoking prevalence of 
1·57 percentage points between 2005 and 2015, a relative 
decrease of 7·09%. Thus, for example, countries that had 
implemented three additional highest-level measures 
experienced, on average, a decrease in smoking prevalence 
of 4·71 percentage points (1·57% × 3), and a relative 
decrease of 21·27% (7·09% × 3). The significant unadjusted 
association was maintained in the main adjusted model.

Both the unadjusted and adjusted associations were 
consistent across parties and non-parties, income 
classification, and UN subregion. The association between 
highest-level implementations and reductions in smoking 
prevalence was also observed in the non-parties: in the 
unadjusted analyses, each additional highest level 
implementation was associated with a decrease in smoking 
prevalence of 2·94 percentage points and a relative 
decrease of 9·97%, but neither was significant because of 
the small sample size (n=10).
The path from policy to reductions in tobacco use 
depends on two distinct stages: first, the likelihood that a 
country will implement a tobacco control measure, and 
second, the effect that the measure has on reducing tobacco 
use. The findings of this study show that the second stage 
is no different for WHO FCTC parties and non-parties. If 
any country implements a measure at the highest level, 
tobacco use is likely to decrease. However, the difference 
lies in the first stage: parties are more likely to implement 
strong measures. This might be due to the lower level of 
governmental support for tobacco control in non-parties 
(which also led them to remain non-parties), but it also 
might be due to non-parties’ absence of access to the 
benefits that accrue from being a WHO FCTC party, such 
as greater regional and global cooperation and technical 
support for tobacco control as well as the expectations and 
obligations for advancing tobacco control among the 
parties. Therefore, although WHO FCTC parties and non-
parties have an equal opportunity to reduce smoking if 
strong tobacco control measures are implemented, actually 
being a party is associated with greater likelihood of taking 
those opportunities through strong implemen 
tation of the 
key demand reduction measures.
Geographical subregions varied in the number of key 
demand-reduction measures implemented at the highest 
level and thus in reductions in smoking prevalence. For 
example, Northern Europe, South America, and Australia 
engaged in strong WHO FCTC implementation over 
the first decade of the WHO FCTC and experienced 
corresponding large reductions in smoking prevalence 
(–7·11, –6·75, and –6·20 percentage points, respectively). 
By contrast, Western, Middle and Northern African 
regions implemented very few WHO FCTC measures; 
these regions experienced increases in smoking 
prevalence (by 3·36, 12·60, and 4·60 percentage points, 
respectively). Countries in the same region often have 
similar goals, political will, challenges, and resources; 
thus, regional differences were expected.
These findings show the potential of tobacco control 
measures to reduce tobacco use. But the pace of highest-
level implementations has been slow. For example, by 
2014, only a fifth of countries (28 of 126) in the study 
sample had implemented tax measures at the highest 
level. This is disconcerting because raising tobacco taxes 
to increase prices is the most effective means of reducing 
tobacco use, especially in low-income and middle-income 
countries where smokers are more price-sensitive.2,19–21
Although the largest increase among all highest-level 
implementations of key measures was article 8 
(smoke-free policies), global progress here has still been 
slow. Article 8 guidelines call for “implementation of 
comprehensive smoke-free policies within five years of 
entry into force of the Convention for each party”22 and yet, 
as of 2014, only 28% of countries had implemented such 
highest-level smoke-free laws. Comprehensive smoke-free 
laws are a crucial intervention in reducing the burden of 
smoking-attributable diseases and deaths by protecting 
people from exposure to second-hand smoke. Notably,

smoke-free environments not only protect non-smokers, 
but also encourage smokers to quit.7
There was a significant increase between 2007 and 2014 
in the implementation of health warnings on cigarette 
packaging at the highest level (from seven to 32 countries). 
At present, 105 countries or jurisdictions require pictorial 
warnings, and 94 have warnings that cover at least an 
average of 50% (front and back) of the cigarette package.9 
Many studies have shown that large pictorial graphic 
warnings are the most effective.8,9 Despite the excellent 
progress made in many countries, the treaty does call for 
parties to implement article 11 within 3 years after treaty 
ratification, and, so again, progress in this key policy 
domain has been slower than desired.
Only 16 (13%) of 126 countries had implemented a 
complete TAPS bans by 2014, far fewer than desired 
given that the treaty calls for parties to implement 
comprehensive TAPS bans within 5 years of the entry 
into force of the WHO FCTC.23,24 Research shows that 
tobacco marketing and promotional activities increase 
consumption of tobacco products and that bans on such 
activities reduce initiation and consumption, especially 
among young people.25,26
Finally, progress on tobacco cessation has been slow, 
particularly in lower-income countries. Although many 
countries might not offer cessation treatment because of 
perceived cost or low demand, there are several effective 
low-cost forms of cessation support that can be 
implemented quickly in all countries.27 Global progress 
and success in tobacco cessation is imperative to reach 
the WHO and UN goal of 25% reduction in premature 
mortality from non-communicable diseases by 202528 
and reduction by a third by 2030,29 respectively, with a 
specific target of reducing tobacco use by 30%.28,29
Although the progress of WHO FCTC ratification has 
been remarkable (covering nearly 90% of the world’s 
population) and the global implementation of all five key 
demand-reduction measures has increased since the 
WHO FCTC came into force, there are still many 
countries where implementation has fallen short of the 
standards set by WHO FCTC. Many countries are faced 
with multiple challenges in moving tobacco control 
forward, most notably, because of the role of the tobacco 
industry in delaying and weakening tobacco control 
policies, particularly in low-income and middle-income 
countries.30 Strong implementation of the WHO FCTC 
article 5.3, which focuses on countering tobacco industry 
interference, is of crucial importance in fighting the 
tobacco epidemic and protecting public health.
There are some study limitations that warrant caution 
when interpreting the results. First, only 65% of the 
world’s countries met the study inclusion criteria. This 
study did, however, include all 126 countries with 
available data, which included countries from all income 
classification levels, WHO regions, and UN subregions.
Second, there are limitations to the available data that 
might have resulted in an underestimation of the observed 
estimates or prevented more in-depth analyses. With 
regard to the first issue, the time interval of the predictor 
variable of the change of highest-level implementations 
(2007–14) does not align precisely with the outcome 
variable of change in smoking prevalence (2005–15). 
However, because the time interval of the predictor is fully 
nested within the outcome, it is likely that if anything, the 
observed estimates of effect are underestimates for those 
countries that implemented highest-level policies early 
in the life of the WHO FCTC. Another source of 
underestimation might have resulted from the fact that 
this study assessed policies implemented at the 
highest level, without taking into account the level of 
enforcement and compliance for the implemented 
policies. This discrepancy is unfortunately endemic in 
this area, which highlights the need for evidence systems 
that examine the actual effectiveness of policy imple-
mentation within and across different countries.14,31
In addition to the above, the available data prevented a 
more in-depth analysis of the effect of individual measures 
on smoking prevalence. As many countries implement 
tobacco control policies together or within a relatively 
close proximity in time (resulting in high multicollinearity 
in individual predictor variables), it is too difficult to 
untangle the effect of each policy on changes in smoking 
prevalence. These challenges point to the need for more 
rigorous and timely evaluation studies to assess the effect 
of tobacco control measures within and across countries.
Third, there are challenges in the consistency and quality 
of prevalence data. Some WHO prevalence estimates were 
from under-resourced countries where gathering quality 
prevalence data is difficult. In many countries across the 
spectrum, surveys were done at irregular intervals and 
both before and after policies were not always implemented. 
These data quality issues should not produce a bias in 
estimating the relationship between policy implementation 
and reductions in prevalence, but rather a greater 
uncertainty about its magnitude.
Fourth, this study focused on the association between 
five key tobacco control demand-reduction measures and 
smoking prevalence. Other demand and supply-reduction 
measures of the WHO FCTC were not considered because 
of the paucity of evaluation data and policy monitoring 
efforts on these measures. Thus, estimates of the effect of 
implementation of other tobacco control policies outside of 
MPOWER was not possible, therefore highlighting the 
strong need for evidence systems to track the progress and 
effect of the full range of WHO FCTC policies and 
guidelines. Moreover, there might be several other plausible 
factors that have influenced the decreases in smoking 
prevalence (eg, industry activities and interference and 
networks that affect the diffusion of knowledge and 
influence decision making with regards to WHO FCTC 
provisions);32 however, it was not possible to assess many of 
these variables because of the unavailability of such data 
across the full range of countries studied. Additionally, this 
study necessarily focused on smoking because only scant

data exist on other forms of tobacco, including smokeless 
tobacco.
This finding highlights the importance of tobacco 
control in two global initiatives that have set goals of 
markedly reducing non-communicable diseases through 
reducing tobacco use: WHO’s Global Action Plan,28 and 
the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which calls on 
countries to “strengthen the implementation of the World 
Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control in all countries, as appropriate”.29
