Atopic dermatitis is an allergic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the production of the type 2 cytokines in 
the skin by type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 (TH2) cells, and tissue eosinophilia. Using two distinct 
mouse models of atopic dermatitis, we show that expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor  (ROR) in skin- 
resident T regulatory cells (Tregs) is important for restraining allergic skin inflammation. In both models, targeted 
deletion of ROR in mouse Tregs led to exaggerated eosinophilia driven by interleukin-5 (IL-5) production by ILC2s 
and TH2 cells. Expression of ROR in skin-resident Tregs suppressed IL-4 expression and enhanced expression of death 
receptor 3 (DR3), which is the receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family cytokine, TNF ligand–related molecule 1 
(TL1A), which promotes Treg functions. DR3 is expressed on both ILC2s and skin-resident Tregs. Upon deletion of ROR 
in skin-resident Tregs, we found that Tregs were no longer able to sequester TL1A, resulting in enhanced ILC2 activation. 
We also documented higher expression of ROR in skin-resident Tregs than in peripheral blood circulating Tregs in 
humans, suggesting that ROR and the TL1A-DR3 circuit could be therapeutically targeted in atopic dermatitis.
INTRODUCTION
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin inflammatory dis-
ease affecting ~17% of children in developed nations (1). AD lesions 
are characterized by the presence of activated T helper 2 (TH2) cells, as 
well as by the expansion of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) (2–4). 
Both TH2 cells and ILC2s may contribute to allergic skin inflammation 
in AD. Cutaneous inflammation elicited by topical application of cal-
cipotriol (MC903), a low-calcemic analog of vitamin D, has been used 
as a mouse model of acute AD (5, 6). Allergic inflammation in this 
model is accompanied by expansion of ILC2s driven by epithelial cyto-
kines (2, 4). More importantly, it is dependent on ILC2s; it is preserved 
in Rag1−/− mice and is severely attenuated in Tslpr−/− mice, ILC- 
depleted Rag1−/− mice, and ILC2-deficient Rorasg/sg/wild-type (WT) 
bone marrow chimeras (2, 4). Cutaneous inflammation elicited by re-
peated epicutaneous (EC) application of ovalbumin (OVA) or peanut 
extract to tape-stripped mouse skin provides an antigen-driven mouse 
model of acute AD (7–9). Allergic inflammation in this model is de-
pendent on T cells, because it is abolished in Rag2−/− mice (9, 10).
CD4+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) constitute a substantial sub-
set of immune cells residing in murine and human skin (11). Lack of 
Tregs in humans and mice results in immune dysregulation associated 
with allergic skin inflammation (12, 13). Treg numbers are unaltered in 
AD skin lesions (14). Thus, the role of skin-resident Tregs in controlling 
allergic skin inflammation is unclear. Here, we have dissected the mo-
lecular architecture of skin-resident Tregs and identified retinoid-related 
orphan receptor  (ROR) as a regulator of genes in Tregs responsible 
for suppressing allergic skin inflammation.
RESULTS
Skin-resident Tregs exhibit an activated signature and 
express the transcription factor ROR
Specialization of tissue-resident Tregs is an important factor in main-
taining tissue homeostasis and modulating local immune responses. 
To investigate whether skin-resident Tregs exhibit a specialized phe-
notype, we compared the phenotype of skin-resident Tregs and Tregs 
in skin-draining lymph node (dLN). About 45% of CD4+ T cells in 
ear skin expressed FOXP3 compared with ~20% of CD4+ T cells in 
dLNs (Fig. 1A). Skin Tregs localized around dermal blood vessels and 
interfollicular areas (fig. S1A). We compared the transcriptome of 
CD3+CD4+YFP+ Tregs from the skin and dLN of Foxp3eyfp-cre mice. Skin 
Tregs differed from dLN Tregs by more than 5000 genes [fold change > 2; 
false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. Skin Tregs were enriched for the ex-
pression of genes encoding signaling receptors [Icos and Il1rl1 (ST2)], 
activation markers (Cd44 and Klrg1), effector molecules (Il10, Ctla4, and 
Areg), and tissue-homing receptors (Ccr3, Ccr8, and Ccr10) (Fig. 1B). 
Flow cytometry demonstrated that the percentage of T cells that ex-
pressed ST2, ICOS, and CD44 and the expression levels of these mark-
ers were significantly higher in skin Tregs than in dLN Tregs (Fig. 1C). 
Rora, the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator ROR, was high-
ly up-regulated in skin Tregs (Fig. 1B). This was confirmed by quantita-
tive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Fig. 1D). RORA expression 
was significantly higher in CD4+CD25+CD127lo skin Tregs than in cir-
culating Tregs in humans (Fig. 1E). Human skin Tregs, similar to mouse 
skin Tregs, display an activated signature with increased expression of 
ICOS, CTLA4, and CD44 (15).
To examine and map the fate of ROR-expressing Tregs, we bred 
Roracre mice to Rosa26Yfp (R26Y) mice. In RoracreR26Y mice, yellow 
fluorescent protein (YFP) marks cells that are expressing or previously

expressed Rora. Most of the skin Tregs (>90%) in RoracreR26Y mice ex-
pressed YFP compared with a small fraction (~5%) of Tregs from dLNs 
(Fig. 1F). Rora+(YFP+) Tregs in the skin uniformly expressed the tran-
scription factor HELIOS, but not RORt (fig. S1B), suggesting that ROR- 
expressing skin Tregs are natural Tregs. 
The percentage of ICOS+ and ST2+ Tregs 
and the levels of ICOS and ST2 were sig-
nificantly higher in Rora+(YFP+) Tregs than 
in Rora−(YFP−) Tregs in dLNs (fig. S1C). 
A negligible subset (<1%) of thymic Tregs 
were Rora+(YFP+) (fig. S1D), suggesting 
that ROR+ Tregs expand and/or are in-
duced in peripheral tissues.
We used RoracreR26Y mice to inves-
tigate Rora expression by cell subpopu-
lations in the skin. In addition to Tregs, 
a fraction of CD3+CD4+CD25− T cells, 
CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD3+TCR+/low der-
mal  T cells, CD3+TCRhigh epider-
mal  T cells, and CD45+Lin− ILCs in 
the skin were YFP+ (Rora+) (fig. S2A). In 
addition, a fraction of CD45−EpCAM+ ke-
ratinocytes that are mostly derived from 
the basal layer of the epidermis and a frac-
tion of CD45−EpCAM− cells, which con-
tain a mixture of mature keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts in the skin, were YFP+ (Rora+) 
(fig. S2A). The percentages of YFP+ (Rora+) 
cells among skin cell subpopulations were 
not significantly altered following MC903 
treatment (fig. S2, B and C). These results 
show that ROR expression was not re-
stricted to skin Tregs.
ROR deficiency in Tregs results  
in exaggerated allergic skin 
inflammation in response to topical 
application of MC903
ROR is necessary for the development 
of ILC2s (16), promotes TH17 cell dif-
ferentiation, and antagonizes FOXP3 
in vitro (17), suggesting a potential pro-
inflammatory role. To understand how 
ROR regulates the function and/or 
maintenance of skin Tregs, we generated 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. Fluorescence- 
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of 
skin population of cells from Foxp3egfp 
mice for enhanced green fluorescent pro-
tein (eGFP) expression revealed that Foxp3 
expression was restricted to CD4+ T cells 
and was not detected in any other addi-
tional skin cell population that expressed 
Rora in the skin, including CD8+ T cells, 
dermal and epidermal  T cells, ILCs, 
and CD45− cells (fig. S3). In addition, none 
of the Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice had weight 
loss or developed the staggerer pheno-
type observed in ROR-deficient Rorasg/sg 
mice (18). Furthermore, the numbers of ILCs and  T cells in the skin 
were not reduced in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. These results suggest that 
Rora is deleted specifically in Tregs of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Tregs revealed complete deletion of

the floxed fourth exon of Rora in these mice (fig. S4A). The numbers 
of YFP+ Tregs were not altered in the skin or dLNs of these mice (fig. S4B), 
indicating that ROR is not required for the accumulation or main-
tenance of Tregs in the skin. The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is 
important for Treg function in the gut and lungs (19). There was an 
increased percentage of IL-10+ Tregs in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice com-
pared with controls (fig. S4C).
Topical application of MC903 to ear skin of WT mice results in 
increased dermal thickness and infiltration of CD45+ cells that include 
eosinophils and CD4+ T cells (5). There was an increased ear thickness, 
accompanied with an intense cellular infiltrate, and significantly in-
creased dermal thickness in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with 
Foxp3eyfp-cre controls (Fig. 2, A to C). FACS analysis revealed a three-
fold increase in dermal infiltration by CD45+ cells in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice compared with Foxp3eyfp-cre controls (Fig. 2D). Eosinophils 
accounted for ~45% of CD45+ cells in the dermis of MC903-treated 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice, compared with 15% in controls, yielding an 
eightfold increase in eosinophil numbers (Fig. 2E). The percentages of 
basophils (ckit−IgE+), mast cells (ckit+IgE+), neutrophils (CD11b+Gr1hi), 
T effector cells (Teffs) (CD4+FOXP3−), Tregs (CD4+FOXP3+), and ILCs 
(Lin−CD90+) infiltrating MC903-treated skin were comparable in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and controls. Nevertheless, the numbers of these 
cell populations were two- to threefold higher in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice (Fig. 2, F and G), reflecting the approximately threefold increase 
in CD45+ cells. MC903-driven allergic inflammation in mice of 
C56BL/6 background is largely dependent on thymic stromal lympho-
poietin (TSLP) (2, 4). The exaggerated cutaneous inflammatory response 
in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice, which are on a C56BL/6 background, was 
not due to increased Tslp expression (fig. S5A). Serum immunoglob-
ulin E (IgE) levels were higher in MC903-treated Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice than in controls (fig. S5B), indicative of a heightened type 2 
response.
ROR deficiency in Tregs results in increased expression  
of eotaxins and IL-5 in MC903-treated skin
The proportion of eosinophils in blood was comparable in MC903- 
treated Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and controls (fig. S6A), suggesting that the 
exaggerated eosinophilia in MC903-treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice resulted from increased eosinophil recruitment. Eotaxins are the 
major eosinophil chemoattractants (20). There was increased expres-
sion of Ccl11 and Ccl24, which encode for eotaxins 1 and 2, in MC903- 
treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with controls (Fig. 3A). 
IL-5 plays a critical role in tissue eosinophilia by synergizing with 
eotaxins and promoting eosinophil survival in tissues (21, 22). IL-5 levels 
were significantly higher in MC903-treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice than of controls (Fig. 3B). IL-4 and IL-13 levels were comparable 
in the two groups (fig. S6B).
IL-5 is predominantly produced by ILC2s and by a subset of acti-
vated TH2 cells (23). ILC2s exist as preactivated resident sentinels in 
the dermis that rapidly release IL-5 and IL-13 upon stimulation (21). 
In contrast, TH2 cells are recruited to the skin at a later stage of allergic 
inflammation. MC903 treatment up-regulated IL-33/ST2 and CD69 
expression, down-regulated CD25 expression, and had negligible ef-
fect on KLRG1 expression on skin Lin−CD90+ ILCs, but the changes 
were comparable in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and Foxp3eyfp-cre controls. 
However, in Il5, mRNA levels were significantly increased in ILCs 
from MC903-treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with 
controls (Fig. 3C). There was also a twofold increase in Il4 and Il13 
mRNA levels in ILCs from MC903-treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice; however, it did not reach statistical significance (fig. S6C). There 
was a significant increase in CD4+FOXP3−IL-5+, but not CD4+IL-13+ 
or CD4+IL-4+, Teffs in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with con-
trols (Fig. 3D). The chemokine CCL8 is up-regulated in AD skin le-
sions (24) and is critical for the recruitment of CCR8-expressing 
IL-5+ TH2 cells to the skin in a mouse model of AD (24). Ccl8 expression 
was strongly increased in MC903-treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice (Fig. 3E). In contrast, Ccl17, Ccl22, Ccl4, and Ccl5 expression 
was comparable in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and controls (fig. S6D). 
Cxcl1, Ccl2, and Ccl7 expression demonstrated a trend toward an 
increase in MC903-treated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice, which 
could underlie the increased influx of myeloid cells in these mice 
(Fig. 2F).
ROR deficiency in Tregs alters the expression of genes 
involved in Treg cell migration and function and skews Tregs 
to IL-4–producing effectors
To gain an understanding of how ROR regulates the function of skin 
Tregs, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) transcriptomic 
analysis on Tregs isolated from untreated and MC903-treated skin of 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and Foxp3eyfp-cre controls (table S1 and fig. S7). 
We observed a change in ~1700 genes across the four groups exam-
ined (fold change > 2; FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Expression of the central 
circadian rhythm genes Nr1d1 and Nr1d2 was decreased in skin Tregs 
from Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with controls, consistent with 
the role of ROR as a circadian rhythm regulator (25). Genes involved 
in signaling via transforming growth factor– (TGF) (Smad3), tumor 
necrosis factor– (TNF) (Tnfa), nuclear factor B (NF-B) (Irak4 
and Tirap), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Fos and 
Jun) and in cell adhesion (Icam2 and Itga4) were comparably ex-
pressed in Tregs from untreated skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and 
Foxp3eyfp-cre controls and underwent comparable changes after MC903 
treatment. Genes in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT 
pathway were down-regulated in ROR-deficient skin Tregs. Dysregu-
lated PI3K/AKT signaling affects Foxp3 and Il2ra expression in Tregs 
and increases their conversion to TH1 cells (26). We did not observe any 
effect on Foxp3, Il2ra, or Ifng expression in our transcriptomic and flow 
cytometric analyses of skin Tregs from Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. Several 
genes encoding chemokines and chemokine receptors (Ccl2, Ccr3, and 
Ccr5) were up-regulated upon allergic skin inflammation in all mice, 
but to greater extent in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. Up-regulation of these 
genes is consistent with the increased numbers, and higher velocity, of 
Tregs in MC903-treated skin of Foxp3egfp mice (Fig. 2G; fig. S8, A and B; 
and movies S1 and S2). Furthermore, Tregs in MC903- 
treated skin 
showed less directed movement (fig. S8C). Expression of Ccr6 and CCR6, 
thought to be important for migration of Tregs into neonatal skin (27), was 
strongly decreased in skin Tregs from Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared 
with controls both before and after MC903 treatment (Fig. 4, A to C). 
However, the numbers of skin Tregs in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice were not 
reduced (Fig. 3G).
Treg suppressive activity is mediated in part by the nucleotides ade-
nosine and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) (28). Tregs 
from untreated and MC903-treated skin showed strongly decreased 
expression of Nt5e, which encodes the 5′ ectonucleotidase CD73 that 
metabolizes AMP to adenosine (28), and reduced surface expression 
of CD73 compared with controls (Fig. 4, B and D), whereas expression 
of Pde3b, which encodes the phosphodiesterase 3B that breaks down 
cAMP (29), was increased (Fig. 4B). Expression of Gzmb, which encodes 
granzyme B that mediates Treg cytotoxic activity, was up-regulated

(Fig. 4B), indicating that not all genes involved in Treg function were 
down-regulated in the absence of ROR.
Expression of IL-4 in Tregs inhibits their ability to suppress TH2 
cells and ILC2s (30, 31). Il4 levels were elevated in skin Tregs from 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with controls (Fig. 4, A and B). 
This was confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, the percentage 
of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs among IL-4–expressing CD4+ cells in MC903- 
treated skin was significantly higher in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice than in 
controls (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that ROR expression prevents 
the conversion of Tregs into IL-4–producing effectors. The transcription

factor RUNX1 inhibits Il4 expression in Tregs (32). Runx1 expres-
sion was decreased in Tregs from Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice (Fig. 5B), 
suggesting that reduced RUNX1 activity may derepress Il4 expres-
sion in ROR- 
deficient Tregs. Tregs from MC903-treated skin of 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice, but not controls, expressed Ccl8 and Ccl24 
transcripts (Fig. 4B), suggesting that these Tregs contribute to the 
exaggerated eosinophil-dominated allergic skin inflammation in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice.
ROR expression in Tregs promotes expression of the TL1A 
ligand DR3 and restrains TL1A-driven allergic inflammation 
elicited by cutaneous application of MC903
Tnfrsf25 encodes the TNF receptor family member DR3 (death recep-
tor 3), which is expressed constitutively on T cells, including Tregs and 
ILC2s (33, 34). Tnfrsf25 expression, as determined by RNA-seq analy-
sis, and DR3 surface expression, as determined by FACS analysis, 
were both strongly reduced in skin Tregs from Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice 
compared with Foxp3eyfp-cre controls (Figs. 4B and 5, A and B). In 
contrast, DR3 surface expression by skin ILC2s was comparable in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and controls (Fig. 5C). The DR3 ligand TL1A 
is released by endothelial and myeloid cells. TL1A synergizes with the 
epithelial cytokines IL-33, IL-7, and IL-25 to enhance IL-5 expression 
in human and murine ILC2s and to promote allergic inflammation 
(33, 35, 36). TL1A also acts on Tregs to increase their proliferation and 
their ability to suppress allergic airway inflammation (34). Skin TL1A 
levels were not altered after MC903 treatment and were comparable in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and Foxp3eyfp-cre controls (Fig. 5D). Given this 
finding, we tested the hypothesis that selective down-regulation of 
the TL1A receptor DR3 on Tregs from skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice 
may play an important role in the exaggerated MC903-driven allergic 
inflammation observed in these mice. MC903-mediated eosinophilia 
was attenuated in Tnfrsf25−/− mice (Fig. 5E), demonstrating a role for 
TL1A in MC903-driven allergic skin inflammation. Intradermal in-
jection of TL1A into ear skin resulted in a significant increase in the 
percentage and numbers of eosinophils, but not neutrophils, in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice compared with controls (Fig. 6F). More im-
portantly, local TL1A blockade during MC903 treatment by intrader-
mal injection of neutralizing antibody to TL1A significantly reduced 
MC903-driven allergic skin inflammation in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. 
This was evidenced by a significant decrease in dermal thickness, infil-
tration by CD45+ cells and eosinophils, and expression of Il5 and Ccl8 
compared with isotype control antibody–treated mice (Fig. 6, G to J). 
These results suggest that ROR expression in Tregs restrains TL1A- 
mediated allergic skin inflammation and eosinophilia elicited by cuta-
neous application of MC903.
ROR deficiency in Tregs results in exaggerated skin 
inflammation in response to EC sensitization
To investigate whether ROR deficiency in Tregs plays a role in re-
straining antigen-driven T cell–dependent allergic skin inflammation, 
we subjected Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice and Foxp3eyfp-cre controls to EC 
sensitization. EC sensitization was elicited by repeated application 
of the antigen OVA to tape-stripped skin, as illustrated in Fig. 6A. Skin 
inflammation in this model shares many characteristics of acute AD 
skin lesions, including epidermal thickening, dermal infiltration by 
CD45+ cells (including eosinophils), and increased expression of type 
2 cytokines (8, 9). Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice EC sensitized with OVA 
exhibited significantly increased epidermal thickness and significantly 
increased infiltration by CD45+ cells compared with Foxp3eyfp-cre con-
trols EC sensitized with OVA (Fig. 6, B to D). Furthermore, the num-
bers of all cell populations analyzed, including eosinophils, basophils, 
neutrophils, mast cells, CD4+Foxp3− T cells, Tregs, and ILCs, were two- 
to fourfold higher in OVA-sensitized skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice 
compared with Foxp3eyfp-cre controls (Fig. 6, E and F). Il4, but not Il13, 
mRNA levels in OVA-sensitized skin were significantly higher in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice than in controls (Fig. 6G). Il5 mRNA was not

detectable in sensitized skin in either group. Nevertheless, intra-
cellular FACS analysis revealed that OVA sensitization caused a 
small but significant increase in the numbers of IL-5+ ILCs and 
IL-5+ CD4+FOXP3− Teffs in Foxp3eyfp-cre control mice. The numbers of 
IL-5+ ILCs and IL-5+ CD4+FOXP3− Teffs were four- to fivefold higher 
in OVA- 
sensitized skin of Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice than in controls 
(Fig. 6H). OVA sensitization did not result in significant changes in 
IL-33R/ST2, CD69, CD25, or KLRG1 expression by skin ILCs in 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl or Foxp3eyfp-cre controls. These results suggest that 
ROR+ Tregs play an important role in constraining antigen-driven 
skin inflammation.
DISCUSSION
We show that skin Tregs express high levels of the transcription factor 
ROR. Deletion of Rora in Tregs does not alter the number of skin Tregs 
but results in exaggerated type 2 allergic skin inflammation in response 
to topical application of MC903 or EC sensitization with OVA. Thus,

we have identified ROR as a regulator of Treg genes responsible for 
suppressing allergic skin inflammation.
The vast majority of mouse skin Tregs expressed ROR and had an 
activated phenotype. In contrast, a small minority of Tregs in skin dLNs 
expressed ROR and had an activated phenotype. It remains to be de-
termined whether circulating ROR+ Tregs are specifically attracted to 
the skin or whether the skin environment drives ROR expression 
in Tregs. The numbers of skin Tregs are not altered in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice. Furthermore, although the majority of human blood Tregs ex-
press the skin-homing receptor CLA (37), human blood Tregs ex-
pressed fivefold less RORA mRNA compared with skin Tregs. These 
findings argue for local acquisition of ROR expression by Tregs in 
the skin.
We demonstrated that ROR expression in Tregs restrains allergic 
skin inflammation induced by topical application of MC903, an AD 
model dependent on ILC2s (2, 4). This was evidenced by increased 
ear swelling and dermal thickness in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice, with a 
threefold increase in the influx of inflammatory cells that included 
T cells, basophils, neutrophils, and mast cells, and a selective enrich-
ment in eosinophils that showed an eightfold increase over controls. 
Type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4, are documented to drive eotaxin ex-
pression (21, 38). Increased eosinophilia in MC903-treated skin of 
Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice may be explained by synergy between in-
creased skin IL-5 expression and increased skin and Tregs eotaxin ex-
pression, likely driven by increased expression of IL-4 and IL-13. The 
exaggerated skin inflammation in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice was not 
caused by increased cutaneous expression of TSLP, the epithelial cyto-
kine essential for MC903-driven skin inflammation in mice on the 
C57BL/6 background, the background of the Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice 
we used. ROR was essential for repressing IL-5 expression in fast- 
responding ILC2s and for restricting the CCL8-dependent recruit-
ment of IL-5+ TH2 effector cells to the skin, likely by dampening the 
expression of Ccl8 in the skin, and particularly in skin Tregs. ROR also 
repressed IL-13 and IL-4 expression by skin ILCs, although the effect 
did not reach statistical significance, but had no effect on IL-4 and IL-13 
expression by T cells. We propose that in addition to their role in re-
straining adaptive immunity, a central function of Tregs resident in bar-
rier interfaces, such as skin, is to inhibit the rapid activation of innate 
lymphocytes. The unrestrained activation of these innate sentinels may 
contribute to acute flare-ups in allergic diseases.
ROR regulated the expression of several genes important for Treg 
migration and function. Changes in chemokine receptor expression 
may underlie the increased motility of Tregs in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice. Our data suggest that decreased expression by ROR-deficient 
Tregs of Tnfrsf25 encoding DR3, a gene important for Treg function, con-
tributed to the enhanced skin inflammation in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl 
mice. The exaggerated skin inflammation in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice 
may be a direct effect of decreased TL1A activation of Tregs and/or in-
creased availability of TL1A to activate ILC2s. Definitive evidence of 
the role of DR3 expression on Tregs in limiting allergic skin inflam-
mation and its mechanism of action awaits the generation and study 
of mice with selective deficiency of Tnfrsf25 in Tregs and/or ILC2s. 
Furthermore, our data indicate that ROR restrains the conversion 
of Tregs into IL-4–producing effector cells, possibly because ROR 
drives the expression of Runx1, which inhibits Il4 gene transcription. 
Derepression of the TH2 proinflammatory genes in ROR-deficient 
skin Tregs likely contributes to the enhanced allergic skin response 
in Foxp3eyfp-creRorafl/fl mice. Furthermore, IL-10 expression was increased 
in ROR-deficient skin Tregs. The transcription factor AhR (aryl hydro-
carbon receptor) enhances IL-10 production in Tregs (39), whereas 
IL-4 suppresses it (40). We observed increased Ahr and Il4 expression 
in ROR-deficient skin Tregs. Increased expression of AhR and IL-4 
may underlie the enhanced IL-10 expression by these cells.
In addition to its role in suppressing ILC2-dependent allergic skin 
inflammation driven by topical application of MC903, ROR expres-
sion in Tregs was important for suppressing T cell–dependent allergic 
skin inflammation driven by topical application of the antigen OVA to 
tape-stripped skin, a T cell–dependent mouse model of AD. This was 
evidenced by increased epidermal thickness, increased dermal infiltra-
tion by CD45+ inflammatory cells (including eosinophils, mast cells, 
neutrophils, T cells, and ILC2s), increased cutaneous expression of Il4, 
and increased expression of IL-5 by T cells and ILCs.
We demonstrate significantly higher expression of RORA in hu-
man skin Tregs than in blood Tregs, suggesting that our results may be 
applicable to humans. Our results may be particularly relevant to pa-
tients with AD, a disease in which both TH2 cells and ILC2s play im-
portant roles in allergic skin inflammation. RORA polymorphisms in 
asthma (41) and Rora down-regulation in dogs with AD (42) further 
suggest that ROR may play a regulatory role in atopic diseases. More-
over, expression of Rora in Tregs resident in tissues such as the gut (43) 
may endow them with the ability to dampen allergic inflammation in 
organs other than skin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Foxp3eyfp-cre (C57BL/6), R26R (C57BL/6), Rag1−/− (C57BL/6), and 
Rorcgfp (C57BL/6) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laborato-
ry (Bar Harbor, ME). Rorafl/fl (C57BL/6) mice were generated in the 
laboratory of P. Chambon (France) (44). Roracre (C57BL/6) mice were 
generated in the laboratory of D. O’Leary (45). Tnfrsf25−/− mice were 
generated by E. Y. Wang and obtained from the laboratory of R. Siegel. 
Foxp3egfp reporter mice were a gift from T. Chatila. All mice were kept 
in a pathogen-free environment. All procedures performed on the mice 
were in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the 
Children’s Hospital Boston.
Preparation of skin cell homogenates from mice  
and human skin
Dorsal and ventral ear murine skin was separated using tweezers, 
chopped, and digested in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medi-
um containing Liberase TL (2.5 mg/ml, Roche, Life Technologies) and 
deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I (20 ng/ml, Sigma) for 90 min at 37°C, 
with vigorous shaking. Digested tissue was mechanically disrupted 
with a plunger, filtered, washed, and suspended in media for flow cy-
tometric analysis. Human skin surgical discards of facial skin were ob-
tained from the laboratory of R. Clark (Brigham and Women’s Hospital). 
To obtain cells from human skin, we removed all the fat using a scal-
pel and chopped the skin into small pieces and digested for 2 hours at 
37°C with vigorous shaking in complete RPMI containing collagenase 
IV (2 ng/ml, Worthington Pharmaceuticals), hyaluronidase (2 ng/ml, 
Sigma), and DNase I. Digested tissue was mechanically disrupted using 
a plunger, filtered, centrifuged, and resuspended for cell sorting.
Flow cytometry

antibody (2.4G2) and washed before staining. Staining with CD45 
and fixable viability dye (eBioscience) was used for FACS analysis of 
skin cell homogenates. One hundred twenty-three count beads from 
eBioscience were used for estimating cell counts. Cells were analyzed 
on LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed with 
FlowJo software (v9.7).
Intracellular staining analysis for cytokines  
and transcription factors
LN and skin cell suspensions were incubated with media containing 
phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, ionomycin, GolgiPlug, and GolgiStop for 
3 hours. Staining for surface markers was performed, followed by fix-
ation and permeabilization using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer. Cells 
were incubated with antibodies against cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, and 
IL-13, along with antibodies to FOXP3, overnight in Perm/Wash buf-
fer (BD Biosciences). This protocol was also used to stain cells with 
anti-FOXP3 and anti-HELIOS markers without quenching the emis-
sion of YFP in Roracre R26R mice.
MC903 treatment
MC903 (catalog no. 2700) was purchased from Tocris Biochemicals. 
The stock was reconstituted in ethanol. MC903 (2 nM) (in a volume of 
20 ml) was topically applied on the ears of mice every other day, for a 
total of four applications. Ethanol (vehicle) was applied on the control 
ear. Mice were sacrificed 1 day after the last application.
RNA preparation and qPCR
Cells were sorted directly into the lysis buffer of RNA Isolation Micro 
kit (Zymo Research), and RNA was prepared on the basis of kit in-
structions. For analysis of transcripts in skin, skin tissue was stored in 
RNAlater (Ambion) and homogenized using a tissue homogenizer, 
and RNA was prepared using RNA isolation kits (Zymo Research). 
Reverse transcription was performed with an iScript cDNA synthesis 
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PCRs were run on an ABI Prism 7300 
(Applied Biosystems) sequence detection system platform. TaqMan 
primers and probes were obtained from Life Technologies. The house-
keeping gene 2-microglobulin was used as a control. Relative mRNA 
expression was quantified using the 2−Ct method.
RNA-seq and transcriptomic analysis
CD3+CD4+Foxp3+(YFP+) Tregs from skin and dLNs were sorted on 
Aria cell sorter into the lysis buffer (PicoPure RNA Isolation kit, Life 
Technologies). RNA was prepared after DNase treatment (Qiagen) 
and sent to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core 
Facility for library preparation and sequencing. Replicates with a min-
imum RIN (RNA integrity number) score of 7 were processed. Com-
plementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using Clontech SMART-Seq 
v4 reagents from 500 pg of RNA and fragmented to a mean size of 150 
base pairs (bp) with a Covaris M220 ultrasonicator. Illumina libraries 
were prepared from cDNA using Rubicon Genomics ThruPLEX DNA-seq 
reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The finished double- 
stranded DNA libraries were quantified and sequenced on a single 
Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing system run with single-end 75-bp 
reads by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core 
Facility. TopHat was used to align reads to mouse genome [Mm9, 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)], and HTSeq 
was used to estimate read counts. Read counts from all experiments 
are listed in table S1. Highly correlated triplicate samples were used for 
comparative analysis (fig. S6). DEseq2 was used to normalize data and 
access differential gene expression with an FDR of <0.05. Expression 
levels for individual genes are represented as reads per kilobase of tran-
script per million mapped reads (RPKM). Heat maps were generated 
using GENE-E software (Broad Institute). RNA-seq raw data can be 
accessed through accession no. GSE99086.
Intravital two-photon imaging
Foxp3egfp (Balb/c) mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally using 
ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). One of the ears was 
gently attached to an aluminum block using double-sided tape. Ear 
temperature was maintained at 33°C using a heating pad. GenTeal 
(Novartis) eye gel was spread over the ear to allow immersion of 
the 20× objective (0.95 numerical aperture). Images were acquired 
using an upright microscope (Prairie Technologies) coupled to a 
Mai Tai Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics). To visualize vasculature, 
mice were intravenously injected with Qdot655 (Molecular Probes) 
diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Images were acquired with a 
laser wavelength of 900 nm for optimal GFP excitation and second- 
harmonic generation. Epidermis and dermis were analyzed by acqui-
sition of ~100-mm optical stacks every 30 to 60 s for 15 to 60 min with 
4-mm spacing. Images were transformed into four-dimensional time-
lapse movies and analyzed using Imaris software versions 7.4.2 and 
8.4.1 (Bitplane). Imaging experiments were performed in the Balb/c 
background, but similar results were observed using Foxp3egfp (C57BL/6) 
mice. Balb/c mice were preferred to avoid autofluorescence from 
melanin.
Histology
Tissue samples were stored in 10% formalin and sent to the histology 
core at Boston Children’s Hospital for processing and hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) staining. Slides were analyzed on the 20× objective of 
bright-field microscope (Nikon), and captured images were analyzed 
using ImageJ software for enumeration of dermal thickness.
Local treatments by intradermal injection
Recombinant TL1A (0.9 g/l; catalog no. 753008, BioLegend) was 
injected intradermally into the ear of mice in a total volume of 10 ml 
every day for 3 days. Isotype antibody or anti-human/mouse TL1A 
antibody (R&D Systems) was injected intradermally into the ears in 
a total volume of 10 l every other day for 3 days. Cells from ears were 
prepared, and flow cytometric analysis was performed as described 
earlier.
Epicutaneous sensitization
Six- to 8-week-old female mice were epicutaneously sensitized for 
2 weeks, as described previously (9). In brief, for each treatment, female 
mice were anesthetized, and then their back skin was shaved and 
tape-stripped with a film dressing (Tegaderm, 3M). EC sensitization 
consisted of applying a 1-cm2 gauze containing 200 g of OVA (Sigma- 
Aldrich) to the skin after each tape stripping and securing it with a film 
dressing. Analyses were done at day 12.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
For detection of total IgE levels, mouse sera were prepared and enzyme- 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed (88-50460-88, 
eBioscience) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For quantification 
of cytokines in the tissue, mouse ears were flash-frozen in liquid nitro-
gen. Tissue was chopped, lysed, and homogenized in 500 ml of T-PER 
tissue protein extraction buffer (catalog no. 78510, Thermo Fisher

Scientific) in the presence of complete protease inhibitor and phos-
phatase inhibitors. Total protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic 
acid protein assay kit (catalog no. 23227, Pierce), and levels of IL-5 
were enumerated after normalizing to the total protein content in the 
tissue. IL-5 levels in ear skin were measured using Quantikine IL-5 kit 
(M5000, R&D Systems), and TL1A levels were measured using DuoSet 
ELISA kit (DY1896-05, R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined by the Mann-Whitney test or 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis using GraphPad Prism. P < 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
