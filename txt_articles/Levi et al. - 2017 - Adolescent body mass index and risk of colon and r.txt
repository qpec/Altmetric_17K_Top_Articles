BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between the body mass index (BMI) in late adolescence and the risk of colon
and rectal cancer. METHODS: This study analyzed a cohort of 1,087,358 Jewish men and 707,212 Jewish women who underwent health
examinations at the ages of 16 to 19 years between 1967 and 2002 and were followed by linkage to the national cancer registry up to
2012. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer according to age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles from
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (overweight, 85th percentile to <95th percentile; obesity, �95th percentile).
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 23 years, 2967 incidence cases of colorectal cancer, including 1977 among men (1403 in the
colon and 574 in the rectum) and 990 among women (764 in the colon and 226 in the rectum), were identified. Overweight and obe-
sity were associated with the risk for colon cancer among both men (HR for overweight, 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.84;
HR for obesity, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15-2.06; statistically significant from a BMI of 23.4 kg/m2 [spline analysis]) and women (HR for over-
weight, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.22-1.93; HR for obesity, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.89-2.57; significant from a BMI of 23.6 kg/m2). Obesity, but not over-
weight, was associated with a risk for rectal cancer among men (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.65; significant from a BMI of 29.6 kg/m2) and
women (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 0.90-4.58; significant from a BMI of 30.6 kg/m2). CONCLUSIONS: Being overweight or obese in adoles-
cence was associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancers in men and women, whereas obesity was associated with
rectal cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4022-30. V

INTRODUCTION
There is growing concern about the impact of adolescent overweight and obesity on chronic disease later in life.1-3 Colo-
rectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in
the world.4 Adult obesity has been associated with an increased risk for CRC among both men and women, although
meta-regression analysis indicates that the association is stronger for colon cancer than rectal cancer and for men than
women.5-7 In contrast to consistent reports on the association of adult obesity and CRC risk, data about the association of
adolescent obesity and the risk of CRC are conflicting,8-18 and a recent report by Zhang et al17 questioned the association
between adolescent obesity and the risk of CRC among men but not women. Moreover, most previous studies were lim-
ited by the use of reported or recalled body mass index (BMI) values11,12,14-16 rather than measured BMI values.18 In this
study, we extend our previous work on the association between the BMI measured at adolescence and the risk of CRC
among men19 by including data for women and updating our cancer registry linkage data and thus enlarging the number
of incident CRC cases from 638 to 2967.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We analyzed a cohort of 16- to 19-year-old Israeli Jewish adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations in late
adolescence (predominantly at the age of 17 years) to determine their fitness for military service and had at least 10 years
of follow-up (Fig. 1). As recently described,1 between January 1967 and December 31, 2010, 2,454,693 adolescents were
evaluated. After the exclusion of 64,186 subjects with missing height or weight data and 92,377 non-Jewish examinees,

 2,298,130 individuals remained. We than excluded
503,560 subjects who were evaluated after December
2002 and did not have the opportunity for at least 10
years of follow-up. These exclusions resulted in a study
sample of 1,794,570 participants; this sample included a
nationally representative group of Jewish men, but this
was less true for Jewish women because Orthodox reli-
gious women are exempt from military service. According
to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, approximately
15.5% of those aged 15 years define themselves as ultraor-
thodox, and 17.3% define themselves as orthodox; most
do not undergo a medical examination.20
Detection of CRC Incidence
By linkage with the Israeli National Cancer Registry
(INCR) database, we detected all cases of colorectal ade-
nocarcinoma (site codes 8140, 8510, 8420, and 8020
from the International Classification of Diseases for Oncol-
ogy, 3rd edition) involving the colon (C18) or rectum
(C19-C20) that were diagnosed and reported to the
INCR during the period up to December 31, 2012. The
INCR was established in 1960, and since 1982, the
reporting of all newly diagnosed cancers in Israeli resi-
dents to the registry has been mandated by law. The
completeness of the INCR has been consistently high
(both before and after 1982) and is estimated to be
approximately 94% for solid tumors.21 Also, the INCR
does not include data about citizens who have emigrated
from Israel.
Data Collection and Study Variables
We calculated the BMI from the weight and height, which
were measured by means of a beam balance and a stadi-
ometer with each participant barefoot and wearing under-
wear. Physicians reviewed medical records, performed the
health examinations, and provided standardized diagnos-
tic codes where applicable. Data regarding the socioeco-
nomic status and the country of origin were recorded. The
age at the time of examination, the year of birth, and the
height were treated as continuous variables. The socioeco-
nomic status was determined according to residential
locality,22 with participants grouped into low, medium,
and high categories. The country of birth was categorized
as follows: Israel, the former Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, Asia/Africa, or Europe (including countries of
emigration from Europe). BMI values were grouped
according to percentiles for age and sex as established by
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Figure 1. Study design and CRC outcomes. The BMIs for adolescents between the ages of 16 and 19 years were determined from
measurements of weight and height taken during medical examinations as part of an obligatory health evaluation. International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (3rd edition) codes for CRC were used. BMI indicates body mass index; CRC, colorectal
cancer.

 (CDC)23 as follows: less than the 5th percentile (under-
weight group), 5th to <85th percentiles (healthy-weight
reference group), 85th to <95th percentiles (overweight
group), and 95th percentile or higher (obese group). We
also analyzed BMI values according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) definition: <18.5 (underweight),
18.5 to 24.9 (normal weight), 25 to 29.9 (overweight),
and �30 kg/m2 (obese).24 Further analysis of the BMI in
7 CDC percentile groups was performed: <5th, 5th to
24th, 25th to 49th, 50th to 74th, 75th to 84th, 85th to
94th, and �95th. Deaths in the cohort and their dates
were obtained from the national population (death)
registry.
Study Oversight and Conduct
The institutional review board of the Israel Defense Forces
Medical Corps approved this study and waived the
requirement for written informed consent.
Statistical Analysis
A Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the unadjusted
cumulative incidence of colon and rectal cancers was per-
formed according to baseline BMIs grouped according to
CDC BMIs. We used Cox proportional hazards models
to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for cancer outcomes. Subjects were fol-
lowed up to any cancer diagnosis or death or the termina-
tion of follow-up, whichever came first. Covariate data
included the year of examination, age at examination, sex,
country of birth, and socioeconomic status because these
might affect cancer risk.25,26 Data were missing for
11,939 examinees (0.7%) for the residential socioeco-
nomic status and for 988 (0.1%) for the country of birth.
Cox models were performed with BMIs grouped by both
CDC and WHO categories, and they were unadjusted
and adjusted for the birth year, sex, country of birth, and
residential socioeconomic status. During the follow-up
period, 48,818 other cancers occurred, and 31,013 sub-
jects died. The leading causes of death were injury
(33.4%), cancer (27.1%), and circulatory system (9.9%).
Because the assessed cohort was young, the proportion of
subjects censored on account of injury was relatively high.
Hence, Cox models were repeated and accounted for
competing risks due to death and other cancers.27,28
Trends were evaluated in the Cox models with the exact
CDC percentile for the BMI or the absolute continuous
BMI value through the introduction of linear and qua-
dratic terms into the models. The HR was further strati-
fied according to the maximum age attained during
follow-up: �35, 36 to 45, or �46 years. Spline models
(smoothHR and survival packages, R software, version
3.2.2) were fit to estimate the BMI value associated with
the lowest risk of cancer and the lowest BMI associated
with significantly increased risk. The assumption of pro-
portionality of the hazards was confirmed visually for all
variables. An examination of the age at cancer diagnosis
according to the BMI status was performed via an analysis
of variance with Duncan post hoc analysis.
Most of the analyses were performed with IBM
SPSS 22 (IBM, Armonk, New York), whereas the com-
peting risk calculations were performed with SAS 9.3
(SAS, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Participants
The baseline characteristics of the study participants are
shown in Table 1. The mean age at the baseline examina-
tion was 17.4 6 0.4 years; 39.4% of the cohort were
women, 84.4% were Israeli-born, and 6.4% were immi-
grants from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics. According to the US CDC classification, a total of
140,467 examinees (7.8%) were overweight, and 54,224
(3.0%) were obese.
CRC Cases
Over a median of 23.3 years of follow-up and a total
of 44,563,618 person-years of follow-up, 2967 cases of
CRC were identified, including 1977 cancers among
males (1403 in the colon and 574 in the rectum) and 990
cancers among females (764 in the colon and 226 in the
rectum). The median age at the end of follow-up was 40.6
years (interquartile range [IQR], 33.7-50.3 years), and the
median age at the CRC diagnosis was 49.4 years (IQR,
42.0-54.4 years): 49.5 years (IQR, 41.7-54.5 years) for
colon cancer and 49.2 years (IQR, 42.7-54.1 years) for
rectal cancer (P 5 .79).
BMI in Adolescence and Risk for Colon
and Rectal Cancers
The Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis for the cumulative
incidence of colon and rectal cancers across the CDC
BMI categories shows a divergence of the curves begin-
ning at approximately 15 to 20 years of follow-up and
becoming more prominent at 25 to 30 years of follow-up,
with obese and overweight adolescents showing overt
excess risk in comparison with those with a CDC healthy-
range weight (Fig. 2). The absolute rates of colon and rec-
tal cancers combined for subjects older than 45 years
among underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and
obese examinees at the baseline were 32.0/105, 35.7/

 105,49.8/105, and 61.6/105, respectively (P < .001 for
the difference in rates across weight categories; Table 2).
Overweight and obesity were associated with the risk
for colon cancer among both men (HR for overweight,
1.53; 95% CI, 1.28-1.84; HR for obesity, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.15-2.06; significant in the spline model from a BMI of
23.4 kg/m2; Plinear trend <.001) and women (HR for over-
weight, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.22-1.93; HR for obesity, 1.51;
95% CI, 0.89-2.57; significant from a BMI of 23.6 kg/
m2; Plinear trend 5 .015; Table 3, Fig. 3, and Supporting
Table 1 [see online supporting information]).
Obesity, but not overweight, was associated with
the risk for rectal cancer among men (HR, 1.71; 95%
CI, 1.11-2.65; significant from a BMI of 29.6 kg/m2;
Pquadratic trend 5 .004) and women (HR, 2.03; 95%
CI, 0.90-4.58; significant from a BMI of 30.6 kg/m2;
Plinear trend 5 .140; Fig. 4).

 percentile), overweight (85 to <95th percentiles), and a
high CDC healthy-range weight (75 to <85th percen-
tiles) showed evidence of an increased risk for colon cancer
(HR for obesity, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.19-2.21; HR for over-
weight, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.32-1.99; HR for high healthy-
range weight, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05-1.58; Supporting
Tables 2 and 3 [see online supporting information]).
Analyses of the association of the BMI according to
WHO were consistent with analyses according to the US
CDC (Supporting Table 4 [see online supporting infor-
mation]). Repeat analyses accounting for competing risks
also yielded consistent results (Supporting Table 5 [see
online supporting information]). Stratification of the
association of the BMI and the risk for CRC according
to the age during follow-up (�35, 36-45, and �46 years)
shows that the association was evident among all age
categories, with similar HRs for the overweight category
but increasing HRs for the obese with increasing age
(Table 2). Among subjects with a follow-up age � 35
years, underweight was associated with an increased risk
of CRC (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03-2.06; P 5 .036). This
observation did not repeat itself among the older age
groups.
The mean ages at the CRC diagnosis among
normal-weight, overweight, and obese adolescents were
similar (47.6 6 9.6, 47.3 6 9.2, and 47.6 6 8.7 years,
respectively; P 5 .71), whereas the mean age for the
underweight was somewhat lower (45.3 6 9.69 years;
P 5 .012). A test for the interaction of sex and BMI was
not significant for either colon cancer (P 5 .972) or rectal
cancer (P 5 .085). In comparison with non-ultraorthodox
men, ultraorthodox men (n 5 45,065) were more over-
weight and obese (9.6% vs 7.1% and 6.3% vs 3.3%; P <
.001). The ultraorthodox men accounted for 81 CRC
cases, and being ultraorthodox was not significantly asso-
ciated with the risk for CRC (HR, 1.13; 95% CI,
0.91-1.42).
DISCUSSION
Our study provides evidence that being overweight and
obese in adolescence is associated with an increased risk of
subsequent colon cancer in both men (significant from
23.4 kg/m2) and women (significant from 23.6 kg/m2).
Obesity, but not overweight, showed an association with
rectal cancer among men (significant from 29.6 kg/m2)
and women (significant from 30.6 kg/m2). Notably, a
high CDC healthy-range weight in adolescence might be
associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in men;
this observation needs further verification.
The main strength of the current study is the high
quality of the data (standardized, measured BMIs vs
reported or recalled BMIs in most other studies11,12,14-16
and the detection of cancer cases through the National
Cancer Registry) for a large cohort of 1.79 million males
and females with 45.5 million person-years of follow-up
and 2967 incident CRC cases. This provides the power to
stratify the risk for colon and rectal cancer among both
sexes across the BMI categories and to make adjustments
for a number of covariates.
The association between the adolescent BMI and
CRC among men has been addressed in several studies,
some reporting little or no association,10,17,29 a possible
association,12,30,31 or a positive association.11,13,16,18,32,33
A recent report by Zhang et al,17 based on the Nurses’
Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study, reported that there was little or no evidence for an

 association of recalled adolescent body fatness with the
risk for CRC among men, although there was a positive
association among women. Renehan et al,30 using data
from the US National Institutes of Health AARP Diet
and Health Study, reported only a possible positive associ-
ation for recalled weight at the age of 18 years with CRC.
In contrast, Kantor et al,18 on the basis of a large cohort of
adolescents with measured BMIs (n 5 239,658), reported
that upper overweight (BMI, 27.5 to <30 kg/m2) was
associated with a 2.08-fold higher risk of CRC (95% CI,
1.40-3.07), and obesity was associated with a 2.38-fold
higher risk of CRC (95% CI, 1.51-3.76; Ptrend < .001).
Our study is consistent with a graded increased risk of
CRC with the BMI category and is the first to show a sig-
nificantly increased risk for colon cancer among those
with a high CDC healthy-range weight in adolescence.
Few studies have reported on colon and rectal sites
separately.18,30 For rectal cancer among males, Renehan
et al30 reported an HR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.41-1.28) for
overweight and an HR of 1.51 (95% CI, 0.91-2.50) for
obesity, whereas Kantor et al18 reported an HR of 1.41
(95% CI, 0.69-2.87) for upper overweight and an HR of
2.17 (95% CI, 1.05-4.46) for obesity. For women,
Renehan et al reported no association for rectal cancer,
whereas Zhang et al17 reported that the increased hazard
was consistent across the colorectum. Our data indicate
that the risk for rectal cancer may be increased only for
obese adolescents, and this suggests possibly different
mechanisms for colon cancer and rectal cancer.34 This
might be supported by reports of a differential impact of
obesity on the risk of adenomas35,36 and may provide
some explanation for the inconsistencies concerning the
association of the BMI with rectal cancer in women
reported in several studies.5-7 The association of the BMI
with rectal cancer among men showed a quadratic trend,
with an increased risk evident also in the underweight cat-
egory. Because the number of cancer cases in this category
was low, further studies are needed to confirm this
finding.
Fewer studies have reported on the association between

Adolescent BMI and Risk of Colorectal Cancer/Levi et al

 overweight and obese women at adolescence. Among adults,
the association between the BMI and CRC risk is reported
to be more consistent and stronger among men.5,6 We have
found that the risk for CRC does not differ between men
and women, and we provide no support for the theories
advanced about sex differences.17,37 One might speculate
that the impact of obesity at adolescence, because of the
more prolonged exposure, might differ from that of adult
obesity. In the absence of adult BMI measures, we are unable
to explore this issue.
Several explanations have been suggested for the
association of a higher BMI with CRC. These include
downregulation of adiponectin; upregulation of leptin,
interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor a; increased insu-
lin and insulin-like growth factor 1; the impact of nonal-
coholic steatohepatitis; low-grade inflammation; and an
altered immune response.38,39
The main limitation of our study is that the cohort is
still young, with a median age of 49.4 years at the CRC
diagnosis. Yet, an analysis by the age of follow-up showed
that the association of adolescent BMI with the risk of
cancer remained positive after stratification by age during
follow-up and was amplified in the oldest age group
(approximately 30 years after the baseline BMI measure-
ment). Also, the competing risk analysis accounted for a
relatively high proportion of subjects censored because of
death caused by injury and other cancers. In the current
study, the BMI was measured only once at the age of 17
years, and we had no data on weight changes later in life.
There is evidence that the adult BMI is not independent
of the adolescent BMI.40,41 Consequently, we could not
assess whether colon cancer and rectal cancer are related to
adolescent obesity independently of adult obesity.
Also, we are aware of the absence of data on diet,
physical activity, and smoking, which might affect risk
estimates.42,43 Carcinogenesis is a complex process, and
diet affects the immune system, inflammation, and micro-
biota and exerts an indirect effect through overnutrition
and obesity.42 Hence, because diet and obesity are closely
related, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of one from

years for (A) men (statistically significant from a BMI of 23.4
kg/m2) and (B) women (statistically significant from a BMI of
23.6 kg/m2). BMI indicates body mass index.

 the impact of the other. In the case of red meat consump-
tion, the association is currently described as weak, and it
is impossible to distinguish between the consumption of
red meat and other dietary and lifestyle factors.44 Further-
more, it is likely that these potential confounders may
exert their effects more in adulthood than adolescence.
A family history of CRC is a potential confounder
to which adolescents are exposed. We lacked this informa-
tion. Because our cohort is young, many of the cancers
occurred before the age of 50 years. However, there are
data to suggest that obesity is associated with an increased
risk of both sporadic and Lynch syndrome–related colon
and rectal cancers among men.13,45,46 One of the limita-
tions of this study is the lack of follow-up on emigrated
patients. However, the rate of emigration from Israel is
very low (0.44% in 1995) and has been decreasing in
recent years (0.19% in 2014).47 It is likely that among
CRC patients, this rate is even lower because Israel has a
national health insurance law that ensures full treatment
for all citizens.48 Therefore, the potential selection bias is
not expected to be large or to affect the HR estimates
substantially.
In summary, findings from our study provide evi-
dence that overweight and obesity at adolescence are asso-
ciated with colon cancer among both men and women
and that obesity, but not overweight, is significantly asso-
ciated with rectal cancer among men and nonsignificantly
increased among women. We also show that among men,
those in the high CDC healthy-range weight category are
also at increased risk for colon cancer.
