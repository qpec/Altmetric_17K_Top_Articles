Public health surveillance systems are important for tracking disease
dynamics. In recent years, social and real-time digital data sources
have provided new means of studying disease transmission. Such
affordable and accessible data have the potential to offer new
insights into disease epidemiology at national and international scales.
We used the extensive information repository Google Trends to
examine the digital epidemiology of a common childhood disease,
chicken pox, caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), over an 11-y period.
We (i) report robust seasonal information-seeking behavior for chicken
pox using Google data from 36 countries, (ii) validate Google data
using clinical chicken pox cases, (iii) demonstrate that Google data
can be used to identify recurrent seasonal outbreaks and forecast
their magnitude and seasonal timing, and (iv) reveal that VZV im-
munization significantly dampened seasonal cycles in information-
seeking behavior. Our findings provide strong evidence that VZV
transmission is seasonal and that seasonal peaks show remarkable
latitudinal variation. We attribute the dampened seasonal cycles in
chicken pox information-seeking behavior to VZV vaccine-induced
reduction of seasonal transmission. These data and the methodo-
logical approaches provide a way to track the global burden of
childhood disease and illustrate population-level effects of immu-
nization. The global latitudinal patterns in outbreak seasonality
could direct future studies of environmental and physiological
drivers of disease transmission.

C
hildhood infectious diseases continue to be a major global
problem, and surveillance is needed to inform strategies for
the prevention and mitigation of disease transmission. Our ability
to characterize the global picture of childhood diseases is limited,
because detailed epidemiological data are generally nonexistent
or inaccessible across much of the world. Available data suggest
that recurrent outbreaks of acute infectious diseases peak within
a relatively consistent, but disease-specific, seasonal window,
which differs geographically (1–5). Geographic variation in disease
transmission is poorly understood, suggesting substantial knowl-
edge gains from methods that can expand global epidemiological
surveillance. Seasonal variations in host–pathogen interactions are
common in nature (6). In humans, the immune system undergoes
substantial seasonal changes in gene expression, which is inverted
between European locations and Oceania (7). The regulation of
seasonal changes in both disease incidence and immune defense is
known to interact with environmental factors, such as annual
changes in day length, humidity, and ambient temperature (8).
Accordingly, quantification of global spatiotemporal patterns of
disease incidence can help to disentangle environmental, demo-
graphic, and physiological drivers of infectious disease transmission.
Furthermore, the recognition of the regional timing of outbreaks
would establish the groundwork for anticipating clinical cases and,
when applicable, initiating public health interventions.
Because childhood disease outbreaks are often explosive and
short-lived (9), temporally rich (i.e., weekly, monthly) data are
needed to understand their dynamics. Similarly, to establish the
recurrent nature of outbreaks that occur at annual or multiannual
frequencies, long-term data are needed. Thus, ideal disease inci-
dence data have both high temporal resolution and breadth (i.e.,
frequent observations over many years). Over the past decade, the
Internet has become a significant health resource for the general
public and health professionals (10, 11). Internet query platforms,
such as Google Trends, have provided powerful and accessible
resources for identifying outbreaks and for implementing interven-
tion strategies (12–14). Research on infectious disease information-
seeking behavior has demonstrated that Internet queries can
complement traditional surveillance by providing a rapid and effi-
cient means of obtaining large epidemiological datasets (13, 15–18).
For example, epidemiological information contained within Google
Trends has been used in the study of rotavirus, norovirus, and in-
fluenza (14, 15, 17, 18). These tools offer substantial promise for
the global monitoring of diseases in countries that lack clinical
surveillance but have sufficient Internet coverage to allow for sur-
veillance via digital epidemiology.
Here, we focused on one common childhood disease, chicken
pox, as a study system because it would allow us to validate In-
ternet query data using clinical data from the small number of
geographically distinct countries that report cases, and to address
the impact of varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccination on out-
breaks. Chicken pox, a highly contagious disease caused by VZV,
has low mortality but exceptionally high morbidity, with most
unvaccinated children infected by the age of 15 y in developed
Significance
Disease surveillance systems largely focus on infectious dis-
eases with high mortality, whereas less severe diseases often
go unreported. Using chicken pox as an example, we demon-
strate that Internet queries can be used as a proxy for disease
incidence when reporting is lacking. We established that
Google Trends accurately reflected clinical cases in countries
with surveillance, and thus population-level dynamics of
chicken pox. Then, we discovered robust seasonal variation in
query behavior, with a striking latitudinal gradient on a global
scale. Next, we showed that real-time data-mining of queries
could forecast the timing and magnitude of outbreaks. Finally,
our analyses revealed that countries with government-mandated
vaccination programs have significantly reduced seasonality
of queries, indicating vaccination efforts mitigated chicken
pox outbreaks.

 countries (19, 20). The burden of VZV extends beyond chicken
pox, because a VZV infection causes fluid-filled blisters, which
eventually burst, creating the opportunity for infection from
various invasive bacterial pathogens (e.g., group A streptococcal
infections) (21). Chicken pox is not included in the WHO global
monitoring system for vaccine-preventable diseases (22), meaning
there are few countries that report clinical cases. In the United
States, a country that immunizes against VZV, chicken pox was
historically a notifiable disease. A lapse in national surveillance in
1981–2001 compromised the ability of researchers to examine the
long-term disease dynamics and the impact of immunization
(3, 23, 24). Although the clear symptomatology of chicken pox
makes the disease readily observable at the individual level, the
lack of reporting makes VZV transmission dynamics cryptic at
the population level and obscures its spatiotemporal patterns.
The VZV vaccine is on the WHO list of essential medicines,
which specifies the most important medicines needed for basic
health systems (25), and is available as either the stand-alone
VZV vaccine or the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vac-
cine. However, the United States, Germany, Canada, Uruguay,
Australia, and regions of Spain and Italy are among the few lo-
cations that have included VZV vaccination in their childhood
immunization schedules for multiple years (26–30). Short-term
surveillance studies in select locations of the United States have
demonstrated that moderate levels of vaccine coverage were able
to reduce chicken pox incidence dramatically (31, 32), partially
through the effect of herd immunity (33). However, the effects of
VZV vaccination on morbidity and mortality remain poorly un-
derstood (29) because global chicken pox report rates are low
[e.g., the US rate is estimated to range from <0.1% to 20% (34)].
Therefore, the public health community is faced with a scarcity of
chicken pox data to inform VZV vaccination policy. In certain
locations (e.g., Madrid), VZV immunization has ceased, possibly
due to the lack of information regarding the effects of immuni-
zation that can be used to assess health gains and economic fea-
sibility. Clearly, there remains a lack of research, especially in
countries that have recently introduced the VZV vaccine into the
childhood immunization schedule (29, 35).
In this study, we took advantage of the extensive data available
in Google Trends to study the global seasonal transmission of
chicken pox, using the following procedures:
i) We data-mined chicken pox information-seeking behavior
using language-specific Google queries of “chicken pox” from
36 countries spanning five continents over an 11-y period
(SI Appendix, Table S3), and characterized the seasonality
of outbreaks.
ii) We then validated Google Trends data using detailed time
series of clinical cases from five countries within four continents.
iii) We confirmed that statistical models have a profound ability to
forecast outbreaks in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations.
iv) Finally, we verified the impact of VZV vaccination on the
seasonality of chicken pox outbreaks.
Seasonality of Chicken Pox Information Seeking and
Validation
We detected significant seasonality of the Google Trends data (36)
in 27 of the 34 countries for which weekly data were available.
Each geographic region in our study displayed distinct sea-
sonal patterns of information-seeking behavior (Fig. 1). A strong
latitudinal pattern was clearly discernible (Fig. 1), with peaks early
Fig. 1.
(Left) Global seasonality of chicken pox outbreaks measured using Google Trends as a proxy for chicken pox dynamics. Countries are organized by
geographic region and latitude. Latitudinal variation in seasonal chicken pox information-seeking behavior was observed for countries with wavelet-confirmed
significant seasonality. The seasonality was estimated by fitting a general additive model (GAM) to the detrended Google data from each country. GAM
values using week number as the predictive variable for Google data are shown in the heat map and correspond to the GAM curves to the right. (Right) Data

 in the year in the Northern Hemisphere and later in the Southern
Hemisphere, corresponding to springtime outbreaks worldwide.
These spring peaks agree with the seasonal timing found in his-
torical datasets and previous studies of chicken pox (1, 3, 37–39)
(SI Appendix, Fig. S8). European countries were mostly unimodal,
with a peak in March–May, but some had an additional smaller
peak in late December. Several countries in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and those
countries located in South America, had a single discernible peak
at various times of the year. China and Japan had bimodal peaks,
which occurred in March–May and December–January, balanced
by deep summer troughs occurring in July–August. Other Asian
countries had a single peak that occurred in February–March,
punctuated by a relatively shallow trough.
To validate Google Trends as a reasonable proxy for chicken pox
dynamics, we compared clinical data with Google Trends data
from five countries. We found that in the three countries lacking
VZV vaccination (Mexico, Thailand, and Estonia), chicken pox
information seeking was significantly correlated with reported
cases of chicken pox, with R2 = 0.70, 0.81, and 0.65, respectively
(Fig. 2). The correlation was reduced, but still significant, in
Australia (R2 = 0.26), which implemented nationwide immuniza-
tion in 2005. In the United States, which has actively vaccinated
since 1995, the association between information seeking and
reported chicken pox cases was low (R2 = 0.018). To understand
the patterns in these countries better, we investigated the context of
the language-specific Google searches of chicken pox. We com-
pared the context of top searches containing the term chicken pox
to determine whether they were searches for disease, symptoms, or
treatment (i.e., indicative of disease in the household/community)
or for vaccination (i.e., not necessarily related to disease incidence).
The proportion of searches related to disease, rather than
chicken pox vaccination or other search contexts, differed between
focal countries. In Mexico and Thailand, which do not vaccinate,
we classified the relative frequency of the top searches, indicat-
ing disease, to be 0.82 and 0.80 (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). In both
Australia and the United States, where the VZV vaccine is re-
quired, vaccination and other search contexts had a higher relative
frequency, whereas disease indicators had a frequency of 0.71 and
0.66, respectively. Interestingly, in the United States, the second
highest query involved chicken pox vaccination (SI Appendix,
Table S2). Estonia had a low search volume, and the top searches
were not available.
These data indicate the value of adding further layers to
search terms. By doing so, we identified two patterns in infor-
mation seeking: (i) the data reflected seasonal dynamics in most
countries (Mexico, Thailand, Estonia, and Australia), and (ii) in
the United States, where vaccination has long been introduced,
the data reflected a shift in the motivation of information seeking.
These findings suggest that Google Trends reflect chicken pox
dynamics more closely in countries that do not vaccinate vs.
countries that do vaccinate, and highlight the dynamic nature
of information seeking. Country-specific differences in chicken
pox search context likely explains why chicken pox information
seeking in Mexico, Thailand, Estonia, and Australia, but not in
the United States, strongly reflected reported cases.
Forecasting Outbreaks Using Google Trends
To determine whether the information-seeking behavior observed
in Google data, T, was able to forecast chicken pox outbreak
magnitude and timing, we built and fitted eight different statistical
models to forecast chicken pox case data. We evaluated the epi-
demiological information contained in Google Trends by com-
paring these Google Trends models with a seasonal null model
that did not incorporate Google data (SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2
and Table S1). Three models that included the Google data fit
better than the null model; however, we focused on the model
with the best fit, and refer to it as the Google model hereafter. The
null model lacked information seeking in the force of infection
parameter, which we defined as the monthly per capita rate at
which children aged 0–14 y are infected. To estimate the number
of symptomatic VZV infections per month, we multiplied the
force of infection with an estimate of the population aged 0–14 y
(SI Appendix, Eq. 1). Both the Google and null models were fitted
to the case data from a VZV-unvaccinated population (Thailand),
which showed robust seasonality, and a VZV-vaccinated population
(Australia), which exhibited reduced seasonality. To estimate the
number of symptomatic VZV infections each month, It, we used
Google Trends data from the previous 2 months, Tt−1 and Tt−2,
where t is time in monthly time steps. The chicken pox process
model tracked the force of infection, λt,

The model also contained environmental stochasticity, et, which
was drawn from a gamma distribution with a mean of 1 and
variance θ. We estimated six parameters for the model: the mean
and the phase of the seasonality (β1 and ω), a parameter scaling
the Google Trends data (β2), the baseline force of infection (β3),

 the process noise dispersion parameter (θ), and the reporting
dispersion parameter (τ) of a normal distribution, with a mean
of 1, from which case reports were drawn. The parameters were
estimated using maximum likelihood by iterated particle filtering
in the R-package pomp (40, 41).
The Google Trends model fit the case data (SI Appendix, Fig. S1)
and performed better than the null model (which estimated five
parameters) for both Australia and Thailand; null model Akaike
information criteria (AICs) were >28 units above Google Trends
model AICs in both locations. Because each model was seasonally
forced, all models captured the seasonal timing of outbreaks.
However, the Google Trends model was able to predict the in-
terannual variation in outbreak size (Fig. 3), whereas the null
model could not (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
The Signature of VZV Immunization
We investigated the signature of VZV immunization by exam-
ining Google Trends data in countries that actively immunize and
countries that do not. Seasonality of information-seeking behavior
was much stronger in countries lacking active immunization pro-
grams than in countries that include the VZV vaccine as part of
the childhood immunization schedule (Fig. 3). Germany, which
made the VZV vaccine mandatory in July 2004 (27, 42), had
weakening seasonality in information seeking until 2009, when a
second VZV booster dose was added to the immunization sched-
ule, drastically reducing information-seeking seasonality (SI
Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6). In Australia, where the VZV vaccine
was publicly funded in November 2005 (43), the amplitude of
information seeking was severely dampened by the end of 2007.
In the United States, immunization began in 1995 (31), and Canada
required the vaccination starting in 2000 (44). In these two
countries, where the VZV vaccine introduction predated Google
Trends data, little seasonality was observed in the Google Trends
data (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S9). In Spain and Italy, where
only a few regions or municipalities require VZV immunization
(29), minimal change was observed in the Google Trends dynamics
following immunization implementation. However, in Spain, there
was a reduction in search amplitude when immunization efforts

 were at their maximum, likely indicating a reduction in searches
following immunization, similar to Germany (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Because information-seeking behavior strongly correlates with
seasonal outbreaks of chicken pox (Fig. 2), the loss of informa-
tion seeking seasonality in countries that immunize can signal
the loss of recurrent seasonal chicken pox outbreaks, indicating
outbreak mitigation driven by VZV immunization. We suggest
that if (i) disease transmission is seasonal, as it is for chicken
pox and other childhood diseases, and (ii) vaccination reduces
disease transmission, then the impact of immunization can be
measured as the reduction in seasonal outbreak amplitude.
This assumption is justified because vaccination will strongly
diminish the transmission rate during the high-transmission
season. In the case of chicken pox, the reduction of seasonality
in information seeking is likely due to diminished outbreak
seasonality seen in clinical data (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S8) and the subsequent shift of information seeking from dis-
ease queries to vaccination queries.
Discussion
In this study, we used digital epidemiology of chicken pox to (i)
reveal previously unreported seasonal outbreaks on a global scale,
which displayed robust latitudinal dependence; (ii) confirm the
reliability of the Google data against known clinical cases;
(iii) forecast the size of annual outbreaks; and (iv) uncover
the population-level effects of routine VZV immunization. The
lack of contemporary reporting, due to the relatively benign
nature of infections and the increased use of immunization, has
made it difficult to decipher modern VZV global epidemiology.
Here, we established that information-seeking behavior can be
applied to reveal the underlying epidemiology of a childhood
disease, chicken pox.
Our analyses reveal profound global patterns of seasonality in
chicken pox transmission dynamics. These seasonal patterns are
spatially structured: We have demonstrated a latitudinal pattern in
the timing of outbreaks, with inverted phases between the
Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere and an apex in
the spring. Evidence of the underlying biological basis for sea-
sonality in chicken pox transmission remains an open question.
There is a significant latitudinal shift (i.e., near 6 months) in
chicken pox outbreak timing from the Northern Hemisphere to
the Southern Hemisphere, which suggests an influence of envi-
ronmental, biological, and/or behavioral drivers that vary with
latitude, such as seasonal immunity, environmental factors, and/or
school terms. Interestingly, Google Trends also revealed seasonal
variation in croup; fifth disease; and hand, foot, and mouth dis-
ease; each of these childhood diseases exhibited a unique annual
peak with little overlap in their seasonal window of outbreak oc-
currence. The lack of synchrony among childhood diseases likely
indicates that school terms and holidays are not the primary
drivers determining outbreak timing (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). We
speculate that seasonal information-seeking behavior linked to
childhood illnesses reflects biologically based seasonality of host–
pathogen interactions (6, 7). Our present data open new possi-
bilities for extensive global analyses, which could disentangle
contributions of different seasonal drivers to a broad range of in-
fectious diseases. There is a pressing need for such knowledge
because global seasonality is becoming rapidly modified and
disrupted through human action, with potentially far-reaching
implications for infectious disease transmission (45).
By taking advantage of freely available, real-time Internet
search query data, we were able to validate information-seeking
behavior as an appropriate proxy for otherwise cryptic chicken
pox outbreaks and use those data to forecast outbreaks 1 month
in advance. Our modeling approach, which incorporated Google
Trends and the knowledge of spring peaks, was better able
to forecast outbreaks than models that ignored Google Trends.
Although the added value of incorporating Google Trends into
the model was particularly clear for Thailand, which does not
immunize against VZV, it also held for Australia, a country that
vaccinates. These results suggest that information seeking can be
used for rapid forecasting when the reporting of clinical cases is
unavailable or too slow.
Comparisons of Google Trends data with the reported cases in
countries that lacked VZV immunization revealed a significant
positive relationship (70%, 81%, and 65% of variation in reported
cases explained by variation in Google Trends). However, the
relationship significantly decreased in countries that included
VZV vaccination in their childhood immunization schedule and
displayed either no seasonality or low-amplitude seasonal cycles
(e.g., 1.8% in the United States, 26% in Australia). Interestingly,
in Italy and Spain, where the VZV vaccine was only required in
specific regions or municipalities of the country, no change in
seasonal information-seeking behavior was detected in the face
of vaccination, implying that widespread immunization is necessary
to mitigate seasonal cycles of disease and information seeking.
These findings, particularly from the highly vaccinated countries in
our data (the United States and Australia) indicate that immu-
nization programs diminish seasonal information-seeking behavior
and likely represent decreased seasonality of outbreaks.
Studies of disease transmission at the global level, and the
success of interventions, are limited by data availability. Dis-
ease surveillance is a major obstacle in the global effort to
improve public health, and is made difficult by underreporting,
language barriers, the logistics of data acquisition, and the time
required for data curation. We demonstrated that seasonal
variation in information seeking reflected disease dynamics, and
as such, we were able to reveal global patterns of outbreaks and
their mitigation via immunization efforts. Thus, digital epide-
miology is an easily accessible tool that can be used to comple-
ment traditional disease surveillance, and may be the only
readily available data source for studying seasonal transmission
of nonnotifiable diseases in certain instances. We focused on
chicken pox and its dynamics to demonstrate the strength of digital
epidemiology for studying childhood diseases at the population
level, because VZV is endemic worldwide and the global landscape
of VZV vaccination is rapidly changing. Unfortunately, there is still
a geographic imbalance of data sources: The vast majority of digital
epidemiology data are derived from temperate regions with high
Internet coverage. However, because many childhood diseases
remain nonnotifiable throughout the developing world, digital
epidemiology provides a valuable approach for identifying re-
current outbreaks when clinical data are lacking. It remains an
open challenge to extend the reach of digital epidemiology to study
other benign and malignant diseases with underreported outbreaks
and to identify spatiotemporal patterns, where knowledge about
the drivers of disease dynamics is most urgently needed.
Materials and Methods
Google Trends data (Dataset S1) for the language-specific search term for
chicken pox were downloaded and tested for seasonality. These data were
then compared against reported cases of chicken pox in countries where
case reports were available. We then constructed and tested multiple sta-
tistical models to determine whether Google Trends data could forecast
chicken pox seasonality. Finally, we examined the effect of national im-
munization campaigns on the seasonal amplitude of Google searches. Fur-
ther methodological descriptions are included in SI Appendix. This study was
done with freely available, deidentified, preexisting data (Datasets S2–S6);
thus, no consent was required.
