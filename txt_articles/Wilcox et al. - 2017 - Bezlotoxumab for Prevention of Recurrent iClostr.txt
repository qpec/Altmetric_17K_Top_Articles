BACKGROUND
Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. 
Recurrences are common after antibiotic therapy. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human 
monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively.
METHODS
We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials, MODIFY I and 
MODIFY II, involving 2655 adults receiving oral standard-of-care antibiotics for primary or re-
current C. difficile infection. Participants received an infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilo-
gram of body weight), actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilogram each), or placebo; 
actoxumab alone (10 mg per kilogram) was given in MODIFY I but discontinued after a planned 
interim analysis. The primary end point was recurrent infection (new episode after initial 
clinical cure) within 12 weeks after infusion in the modified intention-to-treat population.
RESULTS
In both trials, the rate of recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly lower with bezlotox-
umab alone than with placebo (MODIFY I: 17% [67 of 386] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted 
difference, −10.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −15.9 to −4.3; P<0.001; 
MODIFY II: 16% [62 of 395] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; adjusted difference, −9.9 percentage points; 
95% CI, −15.5 to −4.3; P<0.001) and was significantly lower with actoxumab plus bezlotoxu-
mab than with placebo (MODIFY I: 16% [61 of 383] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, 
−11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.4 to −5.9; P<0.001; MODIFY II: 15% [58 of 390] vs. 26% 
[97 of 378]; adjusted difference, −10.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −16.4 to −5.1; P<0.001). In 
prespecified subgroup analyses (combined data set), rates of recurrent infection were lower 
in both groups that received bezlotoxumab than in the placebo group in subpopulations at 
high risk for recurrent infection or for an adverse outcome. The rates of initial clinical cure 
were 80% with bezlotoxumab alone, 73% with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, and 80% 
with placebo; the rates of sustained cure (initial clinical cure without recurrent infection in 
12 weeks) were 64%, 58%, and 54%, respectively. The rates of adverse events were similar 
among these groups; the most common events were diarrhea and nausea.
CONCLUSIONS
Among participants receiving antibiotic treatment for primary or recurrent C. difficile infec-
tion, bezlotoxumab was associated with a substantially lower rate of recurrent infection 
than placebo and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. The addition of actoxumab 
did not improve efficacy. (Funded by Merck; MODIFY I and MODIFY II ClinicalTrials.gov

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
I
n high-income countries, Clostridium 
difficile is the most common cause of infec-
tious diarrhea in hospitalized patients.1,2 After 
completing initial antibiotic therapy, up to 35% 
of patients have recurrent C. difficile infection,3,4 
which is more difficult to treat and is associated 
with more hospitalizations, more severe out-
comes, and higher costs than the first infection 
and a 50 to 60% chance of repeat recurrent in-
fections.5,6 Currently, no therapy has been ap-
proved to prevent recurrent C. difficile infection.
Passive or active immunization against C. dif-
ficile toxins A and B is protective in animals that 
are challenged with toxigenic C. difficile,7-9 which 
underscores the key importance of the toxins in 
causing the symptoms of C. difficile infection. 
The relative biologic importance of toxins A and 
B in C. difficile infection is controversial, but it 
may be host species–dependent.10-12 Neutraliza-
tion of both toxins appears to be necessary for 
maximal protection in rodents, but neutraliza-
tion of toxin B alone appears to be sufficient in 
piglets.13 In humans, the level of circulating 
antibodies against toxin A14,15 or toxin B16 has 
been correlated with protection against primary 
and recurrent C. difficile infection.
A new approach to the prevention of recur-
rent C. difficile infection is the administration of 
monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins 
(in addition to antibiotic therapy) as a form of 
passive immunity. Actoxumab (MK-3415/GS-CDA1/
CDA1) and bezlotoxumab (MK-6072/MDX-1388/
CDB1) are fully human monoclonal antibodies 
that bind and neutralize C. difficile toxins A and 
B, respectively. In patients who were receiving 
metronidazole or vancomycin for C. difficile infec-
tion, a single intravenous infusion of actoxumab–
bezlotoxumab was found to be associated with a 
significantly lower rate of recurrent infection 
than placebo (7% [7 of 101] vs. 25% [25 of 99], 
P<0.001),17 whereas adjunctive treatment with 
actoxumab alone was not.16 In two global, phase 3 
trials, we examined the safety and efficacy of 
bezlotoxumab, both alone and combined with 
actoxumab, for the prevention of recurrent 
C. difficile infection.
Methods
Trial Oversight
MODIFY I and MODIFY II were randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted 
at 322 sites in 30 countries from November 1, 
2011, through May 22, 2015. Both trials were 
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines and the provisions of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The protocols and 
amendments were approved by the institutional 
review board or independent ethics committee at 
each study site. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants before the trial 
began. The MODIFY I and MODIFY II trials were 
designed by representatives of Merck and by aca-
demic advisors. All the data were collected by 
investigators and associated site personnel, ana-
lyzed by Merck statisticians, and interpreted by 
the authors. The first, second, and last authors 
wrote the first draft of the manuscript with the 
assistance of a medical writer who is an em-
ployee of Merck. All the authors participated in 
reviewing and editing the manuscript, approved 
the submitted versions, had full access to the 
data (under confidentiality agreements), and 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and for the fidelity of the trials to the pro-
tocols, which are available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org.
Participants and Procedures
The participants were adults with primary or 
recurrent C. difficile infection who were receiving 
oral standard-of-care antibiotics (metronidazole, 
vancomycin, or fidaxomicin, chosen by the treat-
ing physician) for 10 to 14 days. Participants who 
were receiving oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin 
could also receive intravenous metronidazole. 
C. difficile infection was defined as diarrhea (≥3 
unformed bowel movements [types 5 to 7 on the 
Bristol stool scale18] in 24 hours) with a stool test 
result that was positive for toxigenic C. difficile. 
The diagnostic methods included cytotoxicity 
assays, culture with toxin detection or strain 
typing, and commercial assays that detect (at 
least) toxin B or its gene (see the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Microbiologic 
assessments were performed at R.M. Alden Re-
search Laboratory. Polymerase-chain-reaction 
ribotyping of C. difficile cultures was completed 
at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.19 Detailed inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are provided in the trial 
protocols.
Participants were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of bezlotoxu-
mab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight), ac-
toxumab plus bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilogram 
each), placebo (0.9% saline), or, in MODIFY I

Bezlotoxumab for Recurrent C. difficile Infection
only, actoxumab alone (10 mg per kilogram); 
actoxumab was not evaluated alone in MODIFY II 
because earlier results suggested a lack of effi-
cacy for this antibody.16 The use of a single dose 
was supported by the long half-life of the mono-
clonal antibodies (approximately 19 days). Ran-
domization was stratified according to oral 
standard-of-care antibiotic and hospitalization 
status (inpatient or outpatient). The participants, 
investigators, study-center personnel (except the 
pharmacist preparing the infusion), and sponsor 
personnel were unaware of the study-group as-
signments until the trial was completed and the 
database was locked.
Participants who underwent randomization re-
ceived a single, 60-minute intravenous infusion 
of the assigned monoclonal antibody or placebo 
(study day 1) while they were receiving standard-
of-care antibiotic therapy (in three cases, standard-
of-care therapy was initiated on the day after the 
infusion). Participants recorded unformed bowel 
movements daily until day 80 to 90 after the 
infusion; new episodes of diarrhea were moni-
tored through telephone contact between visits. 
Safety assessments included preinfusion and 
postinfusion electrocardiography, monitoring for 
reactions for 24 hours after infusion, recording of 
all adverse events and results of laboratory tests 
through week 4, and recording of serious adverse 
events (including deaths) through week 12.
Both trials had a planned sample size of 400 
participants per group. Efficacy was assessed in 
a modified intention-to-treat population, which 
included all randomly assigned participants who 
received the study infusion, had a baseline stool 
test that was positive for toxigenic C. difficile, and 
began receiving standard-of-care therapy before 
or within 1 day after receiving the monoclonal 
antibodies. Safety was assessed in the as-treated 
population, which included all randomly assigned 
participants who received the study infusion, 
analyzed according to the actual treatment re-
ceived.
Prespecified End Points
The primary end point was the proportion of 
participants with recurrent C. difficile infection 
(defined as a new episode of C. difficile infection 
after initial clinical cure of the baseline episode) 
during 12 weeks of follow-up in the modified 
intention-to-treat population (for the rationale 
for using this end point, see the Statistical 
Analysis Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Initial clinical cure (defined as no 
diarrhea for 2 consecutive days after completion 
of standard-of-care antibiotic therapy adminis-
tered for ≤16 days) was an exploratory end point. 
Secondary analyses included the rate of recur-
rent C. difficile infection in the subgroup of par-
ticipants in the modified intention-to-treat pop-
ulation who had an initial clinical cure, as well 
as in prespecified subgroups of participants with 
risk factors for recurrent C. difficile infection or 
for adverse outcomes related to C. difficile infec-
tion: an age of 65 years or older,20,21 a history of 
C. difficile infection,3,4 compromised immunity,22,23 
clinically severe C. difficile infection (defined as a 
Zar score ≥2; scores range from 1 to 8, with 
higher scores indicating more severe infection),24 
and infection with a strain associated with poor 
outcomes (strain 027,20,25-27 078,28 or 24429,30). A 
secondary end point was the rate of sustained 
cure (i.e., initial clinical cure of the baseline 
episode of C. difficile infection and no recurrent 
infection through 12 weeks), also known as 
global cure or sustained clinical response. The 
time to recurrent infection and the rate of recur-
rence of diarrhea (defined as a new diarrheal 
episode, regardless of whether it was associated 
with toxigenic C. difficile) were exploratory end 
points. The prespecified and post hoc efficacy 
end points are listed in Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
MODIFY I and MODIFY II were independent and 
nearly identical trials, each of which was pow-
ered to determine the efficacy of bezlotoxumab 
alone or in combination with actoxumab for 
prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection. 
MODIFY I had an adaptive design in which dis-
continuation of enrollment in the actoxumab 
group, bezlotoxumab group, or both was allowed 
if a significant difference in the rate of recurrent 
infection between either of these groups and the 
actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group was found in an 
interim analysis. In the interim analysis, which 
was prepared and reviewed by an independent 
data and safety monitoring committee and in-
cluded 632 participants in the modified intention-
to-treat population (39.5% of the 1600 planned), 
the rate of recurrent infection was found to be 
significantly higher in the actoxumab group than 
in the actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group (P 
= 
0.02), 
and more deaths and serious adverse events were 
found to have occurred in the actoxumab group

than in the placebo group. Enrollment in the 
actoxumab group was therefore stopped.
The protocols of both trials were designed to 
strongly limit the study-wise type I error rate to 
5% for the primary end point. The multiplicity 
strategy addressed multiple comparisons among 
the study groups in both trials and multiple 
analysis times in MODIFY I (see the protocols). 
Comparisons between treatment and placebo 
with regard to the primary end point were per-
formed at a two-sided alpha level of 0.025 in 
MODIFY I (because of the more complex multi-
plicity strategy) and at a two-sided alpha level of 
0.050 in MODIFY II. Both trials had more than 
90% power to detect a difference of 9 to 10 per-
centage points in the rate of recurrent infection, 
under the assumption of a rate of 20% in the 
placebo group.
A planned analysis of pooled data from the 
two trials was documented in an integrated sta-
tistical analysis plan (see the protocol). Pooling 
the data also facilitated the analysis of treatment 
effects in important prespecified subgroups of 
participants who were at high risk for recurrent 
C. difficile infection or for adverse outcomes re-
lated to C. difficile infection. Additional details 
regarding statistical methods, including sensi-
tivity analyses and approaches to handling miss-
ing data, are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Results
Study Population
Of the 2655 participants who underwent random-
ization in the trials, 2580 (97%) were treated and 
2559 (96%) were included in the modified inten-
tion-to-treat population (Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). In the modified intention-
to-treat population, 2174 participants (85%) 
completed the trial through 12 weeks. The most 
common reasons for early discontinuation (death, 
7% [182 of 2559]; withdrawal of consent, 4% 
[106 of 2559]; and loss to follow-up, 3% [71 of 
2559]) were consistent among the study groups, 
with the exception of death, which was more 
common in the actoxumab group (11% [26 of 
232]) than in the other groups.
The median age of participants in the modi-
fied intention-to-treat population was 66 years 
(range, 18 to 100); 86% were white, and 56% 
were women. Key baseline characteristics were 
balanced among the study groups (Table 1, and 
Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Most participants were inpatients (68%), 
and most received either metronidazole (47%) or 
vancomycin (48%) as the oral standard-of-care 
antibiotic; only 4% received fidaxomicin. In 94% 
of the participants, the study agent was infused 
within 6 days after initiation of standard-of-care 
antibiotic treatment (median, 3 days in all groups) 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Initial Clinical Cure
In the MODIFY I trial, initial clinical cure was 
achieved in 77% of the participants in the bez-
lotoxumab group (299 of 386) and in 83% of 
those in the placebo group (327 of 395) (adjusted 
difference, −5.3 percentage points; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], −10.9 to 0.3). In the MODIFY II trial, 
initial clinical cure was achieved in 83% of the 
participants in the bezlotoxumab group (326 of 
395) and in 78% of those in the placebo group 
(294 of 378) (adjusted difference, 4.8 percentage 
points; 95% CI, −0.9 to 10.4). In the pooled data 
set, the rate of initial clinical cure was 80% (625 
of 781) in the bezlotoxumab group and 80% (621 
of 773) in the placebo group. Among participants 
who received actoxumab–bezlotoxumab, initial 
clinical cure was achieved in 75% (286 of 383) of 
those in MODIFY I, in 72% (282 of 390) of those 
in MODIFY II, and in 73% (568 of 773) of those 
in the pooled data set (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Recurrence of C. difficile Infection
In both trials, the percentage of participants in 
the modified intention-to-treat population who 
had recurrent infection (Fig. 1) was significantly 
lower in the bezlotoxumab group than in the 
placebo group (MODIFY I: 17% [67 of 386] vs. 
28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, −10.1 per-
centage points; 95% CI, −15.9 to −4.3; P<0.001; 
MODIFY II: 16% [62 of 395] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; 
adjusted difference, −9.9 percentage points; 95% 
CI, −15.5 to −4.3; P<0.001) and was significantly 
lower in the actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group 
than in the placebo group (MODIFY I: 16% [61 
of 383] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, 
−11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.4 to −5.9; 
MODIFY II: 15% [58 of 390] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; 
adjusted difference, −10.7 percentage points; 
95% CI, −16.4 to −5.1; both P<0.001). All P val-
ues were below the threshold determined by the 
multiplicity strategy. In contrast, the rate of re-
current infection did not differ significantly be-

Severe infection was defined as a Zar score of 2 or higher. The Zar score ranges from 1 to 8 and is based on the following factors: age 
greater than 60 years (1 point), body temperature higher than 38.3°C (100°F) (1 point), albumin level lower than 2.5 g per deciliter (1 point), 
peripheral white-cell count higher than 15,000 per cubic millimeter within 48 hours (1 point), endoscopic evidence of pseudomembranous 
colitis (2 points), and treatment in an intensive care unit (2 points).
†  
The determination of whether a participant was immunocompromised was made on the basis of medical history or use of immunosuppres-
sive therapy.
‡  
Included are systemic antibiotics other than the standard-of-care antibiotic that was given to treat C. difficile infection.
§ 
 
Renal impairment was defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 μmol per liter) or higher.
¶  
Hepatic impairment was defined as having two or more of the following: an albumin level of 3.1 g per deciliter or lower, an alanine amino-
transferase level at least 2 times the upper limit of the normal range, a total bilirubin level at least 1.3 times the upper limit of the normal 
range, or mild, moderate, or severe liver disease (as reported on the Charlson Index).

tween the actoxumab group and the placebo 
group in MODIFY I (26% [60 of 232] and 28% 
[109 of 395], respectively; P 
= 
0.64). Bezlotoxu-
mab and actoxumab–bezlotoxumab were similar 
in their effect on the rate of recurrent infection, 
with no significant difference found between 
these groups in either trial (Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In the subgroup of participants in the modi-
fied intention-to-treat population who had ini-
tial clinical cure, the differences in the rate of 
recurrent infection were similar to those found 
in the overall modified intention-to-treat popu-
lation, both with respect to the rates in the bez-
lotoxumab group as compared with the placebo 
group (MODIFY I: 22% [67 of 299] vs. 33% [109 
of 327]; adjusted difference, −10.8 percentage 
points; 95% CI, −17.7 to −3.8; P 
= 
0.003; MODIFY 
II: 19% [62 of 326] vs. 33% [97 of 294]; adjusted 
difference, −13.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 
−20.4 to −6.9; P<0.001) and with respect to the 
rates in the actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group as 
compared with the placebo group (MODIFY I: 
21% [61 of 286] vs. 33% [109 of 327]; adjusted 
difference, −11.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 
−18.6 to −4.7; P 
= 
0.001; MODIFY II: 21% [58 of 
282] vs. 33% [97 of 294]; adjusted difference, 
−11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −19.0 to −4.7; 
P 
= 
0.001) (Table S7 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Sensitivity analyses addressing the ef-
fect of the initial clinical cure rate and the effect 
of missing or incomplete data (including early 
discontinuations due to death or other reasons) 
on the rate of recurrent infection were consistent 
with the results of the primary analysis (see the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The distribution of the time to recurrent in-
fection according to study group is shown in 
Figure 2. Most recurrences (71%) occurred with-
in 4 weeks after study infusion. Differences in 
the rate of recurrent infection between either 
regimen that included bezlotoxumab and place-
bo were apparent as early as 2 weeks after infu-
sion and were maintained through week 12. The 
absolute differences in the Kaplan–Meier rates of 
recurrent infection between the bezlotoxumab 
group and the placebo group were 12 percentage 
points at week 4, 12 percentage points at week 
8, and 13 percentage points at week 12; the cor-
responding differences between the actoxumab–
bezlotoxumab group and the placebo group 
were 11, 12, and 13 percentage points.

calculated by the Miettinen and Nurminen method, with stratification according to trial, standard-of-care therapy, 
and hospitalization status.

Bezlotoxumab for Recurrent C. difficile Infection
Across prespecified subpopulations of partici-
pants who were at high risk for recurrent C. diffi-
cile infection or for adverse outcomes related to 
C. difficile infection, the rates of recurrent infec-
tion were lower in the bezlotoxumab group and 
in the actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group than in 
the placebo group, both in the pooled data set 
(Fig. 3) and in the individual trials (Figs. S3 and 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The ob-
served effects on the rate of recurrent infection 
were similar with bezlotoxumab and actoxumab–
bezlotoxumab in all subgroups except partici-
pants with infection caused by C. difficile strain 
027 and participants with infection caused by 
strain 027, 078, or 244. Among participants with 
one or more risk factors (1964 of 2559, 77%), 
recurrent infection occurred in 17% of the par-
ticipants (100 of 592) in the bezlotoxumab group, 
in 16% of the participants (99 of 606) in the 
actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group, and in 30% of 
the participants (174 of 583) in the placebo group 
(post hoc analysis). In a comparison of partici-
pants according to hospitalization status, standard-
of-care antibiotic therapy, and geographic region,

The results shown are for the modified intention-to-treat population with data pooled from the two trials. Shown at 
the bottom of the graph are the numbers of participants who were at risk at the start of the interval and the Kaplan–
Meier rates and 95% confidence intervals at each time point. Data from participants who did not have initial clinical 
cure were right-censored at day 1 (the day of the infusion). Data from participants who completed the 12-week study 
period without documented recurrent infection were censored at the date of the last completed stool count. For 
participants who discontinued before recurrent infection, the time to event was considered to be right-censored at 
the date of the last stool record. The inset shows the same data on an expanded y axis.

the differences in the rates of recurrent infection 
were consistent with those seen overall (Fig. 3). 
Specifically, the choice of standard-of-care anti-
biotic (metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomi-

Bezlotoxumab for Recurrent C. difficile Infection
Sustained Cure and Recurrence of Diarrhea
In MODIFY I, sustained cure was achieved in 
60% of the participants (232 of 386) in the bez-
lotoxumab group and in 59% of the participants 
(225 of 383) in the actoxumab–bezlotoxumab 
group, as compared with 55% of the participants 
(218 of 395) in the placebo group (difference 
between bezlotoxumab and placebo, 4.8 percent-
age points; 95% CI, −2.1 to 11.7; difference be-
tween actoxumab–bezlotoxumab and placebo, 
3.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −3.5 to 10.4). In 
MODIFY II, sustained cure was achieved in 67% 
(264 of 395) of bezlotoxumab recipients and in 
57% (224 of 390) of actoxumab–bezlotoxumab 
recipients, as compared with 52% (197 of 378) of 
placebo recipients (difference between bezlotoxu-
mab and placebo, 14.6 percentage points; 95% 
CI, 7.7 to 21.4; P<0.001; difference between ac-
toxumab–bezlotoxumab and placebo, 5.2 percent-
age points; 95% CI, −1.8 to 12.2). In the pooled 
data set, the rate of sustained cure was 64% (496 
of 781) with bezlotoxumab, 58% (449 of 773) 
with actoxumab–bezlotoxumab, and 54% (415 
of 773) with placebo (Fig. S5 and Table S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Diarrhea recurrence, 
irrespective of an association with C. difficile in-
fection, was an exploratory end point. As expect-
ed, the rates of diarrhea recurrence were higher 
than the rates of C. difficile infection recurrence; 
however, the treatment effects observed in asso-
ciation with each study agent with regard to the 
primary end point were maintained (Table S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Adverse events are summarized in Table 2. Infu-
sion-specific reactions were reported by 9% of the 
participants; the most frequent reactions were 
nausea (2%), headache (2%), dizziness (1%), fa-
tigue (1%), and pyrexia (1%), with similar rates 
across the study groups (Table S10 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Infusion-specific reactions 
were rated as mild (76%) or moderate (22%) and 
resolved within 24 hours. Study infusion was dis-
continued because of an adverse event in 2 par-
ticipants (1 in the bezlotoxumab group and 1 in 
the actoxumab group). During the 4 weeks after 
infusion, the overall rates of adverse events were 
similar with bezlotoxumab (62%), actoxumab–
bezlotoxumab (59%), and placebo (61%) and were 
higher with actoxumab (67%). Rates of serious 
adverse events and deaths were also higher in the 
actoxumab group than in the other study groups. 
Drug-related adverse events occurred in 7% of 
the participants (172 of 2579), and serious drug-
related adverse events in 1% (14 of 2579), and 
both occurred at similar rates across the study 
groups. The adverse events reported by 4% or 
more of participants in any study group were ab-
dominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, 
pyrexia, C. difficile infection, urinary-tract infec-
tion, and headache. The most common fatal ad-
verse events were related to infections and infes-
tations, which occurred in 11 participants (1%) 
in the actoxumab–bezlotoxumab group, 11 par-
ticipants (1%) in the bezlotoxumab group, 11 
(5%) participants in the actoxumab group, and 
25 participants (3%) in the placebo group; the 
next most common type of fatal adverse event 
was cardiac disorders, which occurred in 8 (1%), 
14 (2%), 2 (1%), and 12 (2%) participants, respec-
tively (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
No binding or neutralizing antidrug antibodies 
to bezlotoxumab were detected after treatment 
with bezlotoxumab or actoxumab–bezlotoxumab 
(see the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
The results of MODIFY I and MODIFY II, sepa-
rately and combined, show that among partici-
pants receiving standard-of-care antibiotic ther-
apy for primary or recurrent C. difficile infection, 
bezlotoxumab was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower rate of recurrent infection than was 
placebo. Both the rates of recurrent infection

The results shown are for recurrence of C. difficile infec-
tion (CDI) in the modified intention-to-treat population, 
with data pooled from the two trials. Panel A shows 
the subgroup results for bezlotoxumab versus placebo; 
Panel B shows the subgroup results for actoxumab–
bezlotoxumab versus placebo. The absolute differences 
between rates (expressed as percentage points) and 
95% confidence intervals for active treatment versus 
placebo were calculated by the Miettinen and Nurminen 
method without stratification. The Zar score ranges 
from 1 to 8 and is based on the following factors: age 
greater than 60 years (1 point), body temperature higher 
than 38.3°C (100°F) (1 point), albumin level lower than 
2.5 g per deciliter (1 point), peripheral white-cell count 
higher than 15,000 per cubic millimeter within 48 hours 
(1 point), endoscopic evidence of pseudomembranous 
colitis (2 points), and treatment in an intensive care unit 
(2 points).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
and the absolute differences in the rates of re-
current infection among the study groups were 
consistent between the two trials. Bezlotoxumab 
was associated with a rate of recurrent infection 
that was 38% (10 percentage points) lower than 
that associated with standard-of-care therapy 
alone. Actoxumab was not efficacious when 
given alone and provided no additional benefit 
when given with bezlotoxumab. These observa-
tions are consistent with evidence indicating that 
toxin B is the main determinant of virulence in 
recurrent C. difficile infection in humans,10-13 but 
they do not exclude the possibility that toxin A is 
also a contributing factor and that anti–toxin A 
antibodies are protective in human disease, as is 
suggested by seroepidemiologic data.14,15
The effect of bezlotoxumab in preventing re-
current C. difficile infection was sustained through-
out 12 weeks. We note that 29% of recurrent 
infections occurred beyond the conventional

Bezlotoxumab for Recurrent C. difficile Infection
4-week assessment period for treatment efficacy. 
The number needed to treat to prevent one epi-
sode of recurrent C. difficile infection was 10; it 
was 6 among participants 65 years of age or older 
and those with previous C. difficile infection.
Our trials included a substantial percentage 
of participants (77%) who had one or more risk 
factors for recurrent C. difficile infection or for 
adverse outcomes related to C. difficile infection; 
bezlotoxumab was consistently associated with 
rates of recurrent infection that were lower than 
those associated with placebo across these sub-
groups. In the largest subgroup (persons ≥65 
years of age), bezlotoxumab was associated with 
a rate of recurrent infection that was 51% lower 
than that associated with placebo. Among par-
ticipants who were infected with the 027 strain, 
actoxumab–bezlotoxumab was found to have a 
larger treatment effect than bezlotoxumab alone. 
However, given the relatively small number of 
participants, it is not clear whether this differ-
ence was due to a true advantage of actoxumab–
bezlotoxumab over bezlotoxumab alone.
A single intravenous dose of bezlotoxumab at 
10 mg per kilogram, given alone or in combina-
tion with actoxumab, had a generally favorable 
safety profile in adults who were receiving 
standard-of-care antibiotic therapy. The rates of 
adverse events were generally as expected, given 
the underlying disease severity, baseline coexist-
ing conditions, and ages of the participants. The 
reasons that higher rates of death and serious 
adverse events were found in the actoxumab 
group are unclear. The conditions associated with 
death in this group (including sepsis, which was 
present in approximately 25% of those who died) 
also occurred in the other groups. The rates of 
death and serious adverse events in the actoxu-
mab–bezlotoxumab group were similar to those 
in the placebo group and the bezlotoxumab 
group. In light of the advanced age and coexist-
ing conditions of the participants who died, a 
causal association between actoxumab treatment 
and death could not be established or ruled out.
A lower rate of initial clinical cure in the bez-
lotoxumab group than in the placebo group was 
found in MODIFY I, but the reverse was found in 
MODIFY II (by a similar magnitude). The differ-
ences in the rate of initial clinical cure between 
these two groups in each trial were small and 
not clinically meaningful. Furthermore, the ob-
served rate of initial clinical cure in the pooled 
data from the two trials was the same (80%) for 
these two groups, a finding consistent with the 
a priori expectation that bezlotoxumab does not 
affect the efficacy of standard-of-care antibiotic 
treatment. Toxin B levels in stool are markedly 
reduced early after the start of standard-of-care 
antibiotic therapy; therefore, bezlotoxumab would 
not be expected to affect initial clinical cure, 
since most participants received the antitoxin 3 
or more days after standard-of-care antibiotic 
therapy began.31,32
The results from each trial regarding the rate 
of recurrent C. difficile infection significantly fa-
vored bezlotoxumab when either the modified 
intention-to-treat population or the subgroup 
with initial clinical cure was used as the denom-
inator. The advantage in the rate of sustained 
cure associated with bezlotoxumab was smaller 
in MODIFY I than in MODIFY II and did not 
reach significance in MODIFY I because of the 
smaller difference in observed initial clinical cure 
rates between the bezlotoxumab group and the 
placebo group in that trial.
These trials had several limitations. First, the 
selection of standard-of-care antibiotic was not 
standardized but rather was at the discretion of 
the investigator. To control for this, the study 
groups were stratified according to the standard-
of-care antibiotic and therefore were balanced 
with regard to that variable. Moreover, the effi-
cacy of bezlotoxumab with regard to the rate of 
recurrent infection was not affected by the choice 
of standard-of-care antibiotic. Second, although 
the time of study infusion relative to the onset of 
symptoms was balanced across treatment groups, 
the time interval was broad; thus, an assessment 
of the effect of neutralization of toxin B or toxin 
A on the severity and duration of the baseline 
episode could not be performed. Third, the pro-
portion of participants with a severe baseline 
episode of C. difficile infection is probably an 
underestimate, since more than 90% of partici-
pants were receiving standard-of-care antibiotics 
when the severity assessment was performed. 
Fourth, other therapies that are currently used 
for the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infec-
tion were not allowed; therefore, the combined 
effect of bezlotoxumab and other approaches 
(e.g., fecal microbiota transplantation) is not 
known. Finally, safety assessments were limited 
because of the relatively small number of pa-
tients who received bezlotoxumab, which makes

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
it difficult to detect potentially serious but low-
frequency toxic effects.
In summary, a single intravenous dose of 
bezlotoxumab against C. difficile toxin B, when 
given with standard-of-care antibiotics, provided 
protection against recurrent C. difficile infection 
for up to 12 weeks that was superior to that 
provided by treatment with standard-of-care anti-
biotics alone. Bezlotoxumab has a novel mecha-
nism of action that reduces the likelihood of 
recurrent C. difficile infection, most notably among 
patients who have an increased risk of this un-
favorable outcome.
