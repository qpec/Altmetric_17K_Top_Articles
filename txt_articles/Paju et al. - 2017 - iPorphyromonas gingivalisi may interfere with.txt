ABSTRACT
In this observational and prospective study, we investigated if microbiological and serological
markers of periodontitis associated with conception in 256 non-pregnant women (Mage =
29.2 years; range 19–42 years). Clinical oral and gynecological examinations were performed,
major periodontal pathogens in the saliva were detected, and serum and saliva antibodies
against major periodontal pathogens were analyzed. The follow-up period for becoming
pregnant was 12 months. Porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly (p = 0.032) more
frequently detected in the saliva among those who did not become pregnant (8.3%) than
among those who became pregnant (2.1%). The median levels of salivary P. gingivalis
immunoglobulin A (IgA; p = 0.006) and IgG (p = 0.007) antibodies were higher among
those who did not become pregnant compared to those who became pregnant. Hazard
ratios (HR) for not becoming pregnant were HR = 3.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–13.9;
p = 0.048) if the subject was polymerase chain reaction–positive for P. gingivalis with high
salivary antibodies against it, and HR = 1.62 (95% CI 1.03–2.54; p = 0.035) if she had high
levels of serum P. gingivalis IgA and signs of periodontal infection. P. gingivalis associated
with no success in getting pregnant.

Introduction
Periodontal diseases are prevalent worldwide. Severe
chronic periodontitis is the sixth most common med-
ical condition according to the Global Burden of
Disease Study [1]. Periodontal infection has been
linked to several medical conditions such as cardiovas-
cular diseases, diabetes, respiratory infections, and
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature
birth and low birth weight [2,3]. This systemic con-
nection may be mediated by bacterial lipopolysacchar-
ide (LPS), resulting in endotoxemia and a subsequent
low-grade pro-inflammatory state [4]. Gram-negative
bacteria,
such
as
Porphyromonas
gingivalis
and
Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans,
that
are
enriched in the biofilm of periodontal infection may
contribute to endotoxemia [5,6] and therefore contri-
bute to systemic inflammation. These species may also
give rise to molecular mimicry, that is, cross-activation
of autoreactive immune cells by pathogen-associated
epitopes, which have harmful implications [7,8].
Several causes, such as ovulation disorders, ovarian
insufficiency, Fallopian tube pathology, endometriosis,
and uterine or cervical abnormalities, may affect fertility
in women. Infection and inflammation play a role in
infertility by affecting the ovary, uterus, the embryo,
and implantation, and inflammation may interfere
with ovulation and hormone production as well as
contributing to endometriosis [9]. An association
between periodontitis and endometriosis has previously
been suggested [10]. Periodontitis and infertility share
common risk factors such as age, obesity, and tobacco
smoking, but the association still needs clarification.
Data on the influence of periodontitis on concep-
tion or the success of becoming pregnant are limited.
Clinical periodontitis was associated with delayed
conception among non-Caucasians, but because simi-
lar results were not found in Caucasians, it is
unknown whether this was related to periodontitis
or confounding factors [11]. Women with poor clin-
ical periodontal status and signs of gingival inflam-
mation seem to have worse outcomes by in vitro
fertilization [12]. No data on the effect of microbio-
logical or serological markers of periodontal infection
on conception are available.
An observational study was conducted in a pro-
spective setting with a cohort of young women who
were hoping to become pregnant. The goal was to
study whether microbiological or serological markers
of common periodontal pathogens are associated
with conception in women.

 19–42 years) [13]. Subjects were enrolled from the
general community from the Helsinki University
Central Hospital area in Southern Finland by news-
paper advertisements. Inclusion criteria were that
they were not pregnant, were menstruating regu-
larly, and had discontinued contraception in order
to become pregnant. Exclusion criteria included a
history of preterm delivery and use of antibiotics
within the preceding 2 weeks. All the 256 entering
subjects also completed the study. The study was
approved
by
the
Ethics
Committee
of
the
Department
of
Obstetrics
and
Gynecology,
University of Helsinki, Finland. All the subjects
provided written informed consent. This study con-
forms to STROBE guidelines. The sample size was
calculated with 80% power and at 5% significance
level to find 20% difference in the serum antibody
levels between women with different conception
outcomes.
Baseline examinations and follow-up
Subjects were interviewed on their medical history,
tobacco smoking, oral hygiene habits, previous dental
visits, and socioeconomic status. Social class was
determined according to the woman’s education
level and divided into three categories: low – junior
high school or vocational school; medium – college,
polytechnic, or a higher vocational institute; or high –
academic university. Clinical oral and gynecological
examinations
were
performed,
as
previously
described [13]. Briefly, the oral examination mea-
sured the presence of caries lesions and periodontal
disease (periodontal pocket depth; visible plaque; gin-
gival bleeding on probing; and clinical periodontal
attachment loss [PAL]), and stimulated saliva was
collected by chewing paraffin for 2 min. A period-
ontal pocket depth of ≥4 mm was considered as a
pocket, and clinical attachment loss of ≥1 mm was
considered as PAL. Gynecological speculum exami-
nation was performed, and a vaginal swab was taken
for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). The
results of the clinical oral and gynecological examina-
tions were disseminated to participants immediately
after the examinations.
Saliva samples were processed for polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis to detect two major
periodontal pathogens – P. gingivalis and A. actino-
mycetemcomitans – using species-specific primers, as
previously described [14]. Saliva and serum samples
were analysed for immunoglobululin G (IgG) and
IgA antibodies against P. gingivalis and A. actinomy-
cetemcomitans by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) with a mixture of three P. gingivalis
serotypes and six A. actinomycetemcomitans sero-
types, as previously described [15]. The antibody
levels are presented as absorbance (AU) and ELISA
units
(EU)
for
saliva
and
serum,
respectively.
Threshold for seropositivity was determined as ≥2.0
EU for IgA and ≥5.0 EU for IgG, according to
Pussinen et al. [15].
Vaginal samples were Gram-stained for the diag-
nosis of BV based on Nugent’s criteria [16]. Study
subjects were followed to establish whether they did
(n = 205) or did not (n = 51) become pregnant during
the observation period of 12 months.
Statistical analysis
A chi-square test was used to calculate the frequency
distributions, and a non-parametric Mann–Whitney
U-test was used to calculate the differences in con-
tinuous variables between conception outcomes. The
correlations between serum and saliva antibody levels
were analysed with Spearman’s correlation coeffi-
cient. The Cox regression models were adjusted for
age, current smoking, socioeconomic status, BV, pre-
vious deliveries, and clinical PAL. The goodness of fit
was ascertained by a Hosmer–Lemeshow test. The
hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) are presented for the association
between conception outcomes and measured para-
meters. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to be
statistically
significant.
IBM
SPSS
Statistics
for
Windows v22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used
for all calculations.
Results
Table 1 shows selected characteristics of the study
subjects. Those who did not become pregnant were
older, more frequently current smokers, and had
higher median C-reactive protein (CRP) concentra-
tions compared to those who became pregnant.
All antibody levels measured from saliva and
serum were higher among those with clinical
PAL, and these differences were statistically sig-
nificant

and
serum
(p = 0.042) A. actinomycetemcomitans IgG, as
well as saliva P. gingivalis IgA (p = 0.025) and
IgG (p < 0.001). The PCR positivity for either
bacterium did not significantly associate with clin-
ical PAL (p = 0.2 for both). Both serum and saliva
antibody levels were higher among subjects who
were PCR positive for the corresponding bacter-
ium compared to those who were PCR negative.
For P. gingivalis, the differences were statistically
significant for serum IgA (p < 0.001), serum IgG
(p = 0.023), and saliva IgG (p < 0.001). For A.
actinomycetemcomitans, the differences were sig-
nificant for serum IgA (p = 0.009), serum IgG
(p = 0.006), and saliva IgG (p < 0.001). The cor-
responding serum and saliva antibody levels had a

Table 2 shows that P. gingivalis was significantly
(p = 0.032) more frequently detected in saliva among
those who did not become pregnant (8.3%) than
among those who became pregnant (2.1%), and the
median levels of salivary P. gingivalis IgA (p = 0.006)
and IgG (p = 0.007) antibodies were higher among
those who did not become pregnant compared to
those who became pregnant. No significant differ-
ences were found between IgA or IgG serum concen-
trations (Table 2) or seropositivities to these two
periodontal pathogens (data not shown) between
these groups of women.
Cox regression analysis confirmed that elevated
salivary antibodies against P. gingivalis were associated
with no success in conception (Table 3) and that this
finding was independent of age, current smoking,
socioeconomic status, BV, previous deliveries, and
clinical PAL. The six women who were at the same
time PCR positive for P. gingivalis and who belonged
to the highest tertile of either P. gingivalis IgA or IgG
(n = 96) had a HR of 3.75 (CI 1.01–13.9; p = 0.048) for
not becoming pregnant compared to P. gingivalis–
negative subjects with lower levels of salivary antibo-
dies. In women who had more than one deepened
periodontal pocket, serum P. gingivalis IgA associated
with no success in conception with a HR of 1.62 (CI
1.03–2.54; p = 0.035). In addition, in the full Cox

 salivary antibodies against A. actinomycetemcomitans
or serum antibodies against P. gingivalis or A. actino-
mycetemcomitans were not significantly associated
with conception outcome.
Discussion
This is the first report to demonstrate with microbiolo-
gical and serological methods that a common period-
ontal pathogen associates with conception. The main
finding was that the detection of P. gingivalis in saliva
and elevated concentrations of salivary antibodies against
this periodontal species significantly increase the risk for
unsuccessful conception among young women. This
result was independent of age, current smoking, socio-
economic status, BV, previous deliveries, and clinical
PAL in Cox regression analysis. Periodontitis and infer-
tility share some common risk factors such as age, smok-
ing, low socioeconomic status, and obesity. In addition to
these traditional risks and confounding factors, the
results suggest that P. gingivalis may play a role in delayed
conception or at least be a marker of this association.
Although both P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetem-
comitans are considered etiological periodontal patho-
gens [17], their salivary presence did not differ
between subjects with and without PAL in the present
study. The detection frequencies of salivary P. gingiva-
lis and A. actinomycetemcomitans in the Finnish adult
population are 35.3% and 20.0% in the whole sample
of subjects ≥30 years, and 13.0% and 16.0% in the
lowest age group of 30–34 years, respectively [14].
The rates were markedly lower (3.1% and 3.9%) in
the present study, probably reflecting the oral health of
the healthy young women. Even though periodontal
diseases may affect young adults, the bacterial counts
are usually lower and the expression of the disease is
generally milder than later in life. It has been shown
previously that even the carriage and, further, the
amount of the major periodontal bacteria is a stronger
determinant of the systemic antibody response than
the extent of periodontitis [18]. This most likely
explains the present association between delayed preg-
nancy and salivary but not serum antibody response,
although they moderately correlated with each other.
Clinical periodontal characteristics such as PAL, the
number of teeth or periodontal pockets, or amount of
gingival bleeding did not differ between women who
became pregnant and women with delayed concep-
tion. It is possible that salivary antibodies appear
before serum antibodies, especially in subjects with
no significant signs of periodontitis, as was the period-
ontal status of most of the study subjects. On the other
hand, the women with signs of periodontitis and high
serum IgA levels against P. gingivalis had an increased
hazard of not becoming pregnant. Beck et al. have
suggested that the quality and quantity of the host
response to oral bacteria may be an exposure more
relevant to systemic events than solely clinical period-
ontal measures [19]. The possible routes of systemic
exposure to P. gingivalis are diverse, but they cannot
be further clarified with the present study design.
Both P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans
are strongly associated with clinical periodontitis
[17]. However, only the salivary presence of P. gingi-
valis was associated with delayed conception. The
difference between P. gingivalis and A. actinomyce-
temcomitans may be due to the variation in specific
virulence factors such as LPS, fimbriae, adhesins, and
proteinases [20]. For example, the endotoxin activity
of LPS may vary between Gram-negative species,
depending on the structure of LPS [21]. Also, spe-
cies-specific factors such as gingipains, cysteine pro-
teinases, specifically produced by P. gingivalis, may
exert immunomodulatory effects and therefore help
the bacterium manipulate host response [20,22]. The
association between P. gingivalis in saliva and fertility
problems suggests that some specific bacterial fea-
tures are involved, independent of the extent of clin-
ical infection and inflammation. The same bacterial
antigens that explain the association between P. gin-
givalis infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes in
humans [23,24] and in animal models [25,26] may
also delay conception. The underlying mechanism
between P. gingivalis virulence and conception may
also include more specific features, as recently shown
with aspiration pneumonia by P. gingivalis in a
mouse model: gingipains were crucial for the inflam-
matory response in the lungs, making a clear contri-
bution to the development of pneumonia [27].
The strength of this study is that it a group of young
Finnish women was recruited that was fairly homoge-
nous considering socioeconomic status and general
health. Limitations of this study are that information

 on the exact date of the discontinuation of contraception
and how long it was being used before that was not
available. It is not known if the subjects in need of
periodontal therapy did actually receive treatment during
the follow-up period. In addition, it was not studied
further if the delayed conception was actually due to
the presently studied women or their spouses. The dis-
tribution of infertility due to male factor is found to range
from 20% up to 70% [28]. The association between P.
gingivalis and delayed conception needs to be confirmed
in other settings and a larger material, and the mechan-
isms explaining this association need to be clarified. The
present data, however, encourage women in fertile age to
maintain good oral hygiene and to attend periodontal
evaluations regularly in order to avoid periodontal infec-
tion. Infertility is a major concern, and increasing health-
care resources are needed for infertility treatments. The
dental and medical community should pay more atten-
tion to the common periodontal diseases potentially
limiting conception or interfering with the success of
becoming pregnant.
