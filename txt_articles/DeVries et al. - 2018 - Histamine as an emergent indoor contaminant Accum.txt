Abstract
Histamine is used in bronchial and dermal provocation, but it is rarely considered an environ-
mental risk factor in allergic disease. Because bed bugs defecate large amounts of hista-
mine as a component of their aggregation pheromone, we sought to determine if histamine
accumulates in household dust in bed bug infested homes, and the effects of bed bug eradi-
cation with spatial heat on histamine levels in dust. We collected dust in homes and ana-
lyzed for histamine before, and up to three months after bed bug eradication. Histamine
levels in bed bug infested homes were remarkably high (mean = 54.6±18.9 μg/100 mg of
sieved household dust) and significantly higher than in control homes not infested with bed
bugs (mean < 2.5±1.9 μg/100 mg of sieved household dust). Heat treatments that eradi-
cated the bed bug infestations failed to reduce histamine levels, even three months after
treatment. We report a clear association between histamine levels in household dust and
bed bug infestations. The high concentrations, persistence, and proximity to humans during
sleep suggest that bed bug-produced histamine may represent an emergent contaminant
and pose a serious health risk in the indoor environment.
Introduction
Indoor environmental contaminants pose serious health risks to humans. Well-investigated
examples include human-generated contaminants, such as lead [1], asbestos [2] and various
pesticides [3, 4], along with aeroallergens produced by pests such as house dust mites [5], cock-
roaches [6], and rodents [7]. These pests share several common features: (a) they are often
obligatorily associated with humans and present in large numbers; (b) some of the allergens
they produce are excreted in feces and urine and persist in household dust; (c) environmental
conditions (sanitation, temperature, humidity) can influence both pest populations and the
persistence of allergens; and (d) allergen-containing household dust can become airborne and

 inhaled when disturbed [8–11]. Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius, Fig 1) share these features, but
they are not known to produce allergens beyond those delivered with their bites.
Bed bugs had all but disappeared from developed areas of the world by the 1960s, but have
resurged globally since the early 2000s [12–17]. Although C. lectularius is capable of transmit-
ting Trypanosoma cruzi (the causative agent of Chagas disease) [18] and Bartonella quintana
(trench fever) [19] in laboratory assays, there is no evidence of natural pathogen transmission.
Bed bug bites, however, can occasionally cause severe dermatitis [20], as humans become sen-
sitized to nitrophorin proteins in bed bug saliva [21]. Bed bugs also have strong psychological
impacts on humans, with effects often lasting past their eradication [22]. Bed bug eradication
is particularly challenging because of high levels of resistance to insecticides, difficulty applying
insecticides onto and close to beds, and costs associated with pest abatement [23]. High tem-
peratures (“heat treatments”) can eliminate bed bugs, but this approach is often prohibitively
expensive.
Histamine was recently identified as a close-range aggregation pheromone component in
bed bug feces [24], with bed bugs likely synthesizing a majority of histamine de novo [25]. His-
tamine is a known food contaminant, mainly of fish and alcoholic beverages such as beer and
wine [26]. When ingested, histamine is a mediator of acute inflammatory reactions and associ-
ated with significant adverse effects in sensitive individuals, including hypotension, uticaria,
shock, heart palpitations, diarrhea, vomiting, pain, itching, and respiratory distress [26]. Cuta-
neous exposure is known to result in dermatitis, primarily in atopic patients [27, 28]. Respira-
tory exposure to histamine can reduce forced expiratory volume (FEV) [29], and increase
nasal mucosa reactivity [30], with these effects mostly seen in atopic individuals [31]. Dermal,
nasal, or respiratory responses (e.g., bronchial reactivity) [32, 33] to histamine in clinical tests
suggest that exposure to histamine in the environment would constitute a significant health
risk, although information on environmental exposure is limited. Histamine levels have been
correlated with the mass of respirable agricultural dust, and thought to be associated with
occupational asthma, rhinitis, bronchitis, and related respiratory syndromes [34–36]. How-
ever, information on indoor histamine exposure is scarce, and the health risks from chronic
respiratory exposure to histamine are poorly understood.
To determine whether bed bugs deposit histamine and whether histamine could pose an
exposure risk for humans indoors, we designed a study to quantify histamine levels in homes
with and without bed bugs. In addition, we evaluated the persistence of histamine following
bed bug eradication.

(#3840). Before participation, adult participants (>21 yrs old) provided informed consent.
Study design and sampling
Apartments were located within the same nine-story multi-unit (140 apartments) building in
Raleigh, NC. This building has been chronically infested with bed bugs for several years despite
recurrent pest control interventions. Therefore, some “un-infested” apartments in this build-
ing could have been infested with bed bugs prior to our sampling, or they might represent
marginally infested units where we failed to detect low-level bed bug populations. To obtain
truly un-infested homes, five additional homes in Raleigh, NC, not associated with the apart-
ment building, were also sampled as external negative controls. Unlike the un-infested units in

 the apartment building, these homes had no evidence of bed bugs in >3 years, and were
located >8 km away from the apartment building.
Residences were surveyed and divided into groups based on their infestation status: infested
(14 apartments), un-infested within the same complex (10 apartments), and un-infested >8
km away (5 apartments). The bed bug infested homes were further divided into two treatment
groups: infested-controls (no intervention; 9 apartments) and infested-treated (intervention; 6
apartments, some switched over from the infested control group). House dust was sampled in
all homes at the beginning of the study (baseline), and infested-treated homes were also sam-
pled repeatedly at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Since all homes remained occupied
throughout the study, ethical considerations dictated that infested-control homes could be
sampled only up to 4 weeks after baseline, and some infested-control apartments subsequently

 were switched to the infested-treated arm. However, sampling from control and treated apart-
ments overlapped temporally, with staggered start dates.
Homes were visually inspected for bed bugs during the initial home visit. This was followed
by sampling bed bugs with traps (Climbup Interceptor, Susan McKnight Inc., Memphis, TN)
for two weeks. Climbup Interceptors have previously been shown to be effective at detecting
even low-level bed bug infestations [37]. Although quantitative in nature, the trap counts were
intended to indicate only the presence or absence of bed bugs, direct our dust sampling efforts,
and assess treatment efficacy. Dust samples were collected from an area with the highest con-
centration of bed bugs in either the bedroom or living room. An area of the floor (3 m x 15
cm) near a wall and behind a bed or couch was sampled for 2 min using a Eureka Mighty-Mite
9.0-ampere vacuum cleaner (Eureka Company, Bloomington, Ill) fitted with a Dustream1
collector and filter (40 μm, Indoor Biotechnologies Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Samples were
placed into glass vials and stored at -80˚C.
Bed bug interventions
A professional pest control company was contracted by the building management to handle all
bed bug abatement efforts. This was entirely independent of our research; our only contact
with the pest control company was to coordinate our sampling efforts with their interventions.
Bed bug interventions included heat treatments, where the ambient temperature was raised to
~50˚C and maintained for >4 hr while fans circulated air throughout the apartment [23]. Fol-
lowing heat treatments, the pest control technician applied residual insecticide sprays and
dusts to bed bug sheltering areas. Although we did not participate in the intervention efforts,
we actively monitored bed bugs throughout the study using visual inspections and traps.
Homes where bed bugs were detected at any time post-intervention were discontinued in the
infested-treated arm of the study, and only used for their baseline histamine values.
Histamine analysis
Dust samples were weighed (total mass), sieved (450 μm), and weighed again (sieved mass).
Sieves were made from adhering 450 μm mesh (Wildco1, Yulee, FL) to hollowed out plastic
Petri dish lids and bases (4.5 cm diameter; Falcon1, Brookings, SD). Approximately 5–50 mg
sieved dust was extracted in plastic centrifuge tubes (Sarstedt Inc., Nu
¨mbrecht, Germany) in 1
ml of HPLC grade water. To this mixture, 10 μg of histamine-α,α,β,β-d4 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.
LLC, St. Louis, MO) was added (in 0.1 M HCl) as an internal standard. Samples were shaken
on a rocker for 10 min, centrifuged at 2000 rpm, and the supernatants were transferred to glass
vials. To each supernatant the following were added: 1 ml toluene, 2 ml alkaline buffer solution
(pH = 12; Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH), and 100 μl of the derivatization agent isobutyl
chloroformate (IBCF; Sigma-Alrich Co. LLC). Samples were then capped and shaken on a
rocker for 45 min. Derivatized samples were centrifuged briefly, and the top (organic) layer
was transferred to a new glass vial. Samples were blown to dryness under a gentle stream of
high-purity nitrogen and heat (30˚C), resuspended in 1 ml of toluene, and stored at 4˚C.
Samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) 6890N GC coupled
to an Agilent Technologies 5975 mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and operated in EI mode. The
GC was fitted with a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane Agilent J&W
HP-5ms column preceded by a 3 m deactivated guard column. The temperature program was:
100˚C to 320˚C at a rate of 10˚C/min, and held at 320˚C for 10 min. The IS method of quanti-
fication was used with a 9-point calibration curve ranging from 0.1 μg/ml to 50 μg/ml, and no
samples exceeded the upper level of the calibration curve. Quantification ions were selected for

 both the IS (197) and histamine (194), and both compounds eluted at approximately the same
time (14.3 min).
Statistical analysis
The mass values of sieved dust at baseline were compared among the three groups–infested,
un-infested in the same building, and un-infested >8 km away–using a one-way ANOVA.
Baseline histamine values (before intervention) were cube-root transformed to assure normal-
ity, and compared among the infested and un-infested treatment groups using a one-way
ANOVA. Changes in histamine over time in either the infested-control homes or infested-
treated (intervention) homes were normalized (percentage of baseline value) and evaluated
using repeated measures ANOVA with square-root transformed percentages compared using
the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and all relevant data are available in the supporting information
files for this manuscript.
Results
Baseline histamine levels in homes
In infested homes at baseline, we trapped and visually observed bed bug levels ranging from
16–100 (mean = 40.6 ± 6.2 bed bugs). There were no significant differences in the amount of
sieved dust recovered among the three treatment groups (F2,26 = 2.72, P = 0.0848, Fig 2).
Household dust from homes with active bed bug infestations had significantly higher hista-
mine levels than dust from un-infested-control homes either from the same apartment build-
ing or from homes >8 km away (F2,26 = 14.84, P < 0.0001, Fig 3). Bed bug-infested homes
averaged >54 μg histamine/100 mg dust, while control un-infested homes averaged <2.5 μg/
100 mg of dust (same apartment building) or <0.3 μg/100 mg of dust (different buildings, >8
km away).
Effects of spatial heat treatments on histamine levels
Histamine levels remained unchanged over one month in no-intervention infested apartments
(F1,8 = 2.07, P = 0.1878, Fig 4). Heat treatments/interventions (and apparent bed bug eradica-
tion) did not significantly affect histamine levels in infested homes over time (F3,13 = 0.90,
P = 0.4662, Fig 4). It should be noted that one infested home that did not have measurable
amounts of histamine at baseline was not used for repeated measures analysis, but was
included in the above baseline data. This indicates that (a) histamine in household dust was
not degraded by the heat treatment, and (b) histamine is highly stable in household dust and
persists for months following bed bug eradication.
Discussion
Histamine was detected only at trace levels in homes known to be free of bed bugs, indicating
that environmental histamine is of no concern in residences that are truly un-infested. On the
other hand, we found a clear association between high levels of histamine in house dust and
the presence of bed bugs, indicating that bed bugs are the major contributor to indoor hista-
mine residues. Low, but detectable, levels of histamine in some un-infested apartments within
the same building suggest either that bed bugs had been present in these apartments at some
prior time, or that some bed bugs were present but we failed to detect them.
The significance of these finding is substantial, because exogenous histamine can provoke
allergic responses and asthma. Histamine receptors are expressed in many cell types, including

 epithelial and endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and in various tissues, includ-
ing lungs, skin, gut, the nervous system, and the immune system. The histamine concentra-
tions we measured in sieved household dust (mean >54 μg/100 mg dust) are 10-fold higher
than the US-FDA upper limit in edible fish (5 mg/100 g fish) [38]. Arguably, comparisons of
ingested and inhaled histamine are challenging because airborne limits have not been defined.
In clinical diagnostic tests of airway hyper-responsiveness in patients with airway disease, how-
ever, patients who breathed saline aerosols containing as little as 24.5 μg of histamine experi-
enced a 20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) [39]. Additionally,
histamine is a potent inducer of pruritus, and cutaneous applications of histamine induce
atopic dermatitis [27]. Histamine is used as a positive control in skin-prick allergy tests at a
dose of ~0.5 mg (1 drop of a 1% solution) [33]. Unfortunately, there is no information on the
health effects of chronic low-level exposure to histamine because prior to our study there was
no compelling need for such an assessment.
Quantifications of environmental histamine are scarce. Histamine was detected in dairy
farm hay dust at up to 0.7 μg/100 mg of airborne dust and up to 0.05 μg/100 mg of bulk hay
[36]. While these levels were far lower than those used in clinical bronchial provocation, they
were nevertheless considered a health concern. Notably, the histamine concentrations in dust
collected in bed bug-infested homes were 50-times greater than in agricultural hay.

(n = 5) are separate apartments >8 km from the apartment building and are not known to have had bed bugs in the past 3 yrs. No
significant differences were detected among groups according to ANOVA.

 Importantly, the high concentrations of histamine we recovered were from sieved dust par-
ticles which readily become airborne and represent the major route of entry of allergens into
the airway, as documented in studies correlating cockroach allergens in settled and airborne
dust [40]. The potential health risks associated with bed bug-produced histamine might rival
those associated with other indoor pests, namely cockroaches and dust mites. Although
unknown, we speculate that environmental histamine may have additive or synergistic interac-
tions with other allergens [41]. Because histamine is downstream in the mammalian immune
response, exposure to dust-associated airborne histamine would likely trigger more rapid
adverse effects than exposure to aeroallergens alone. Histamine produced by bed bugs could
potentially pose a greater risk than some arthropod-produced allergens, due to its deposition
location and stability. Cockroaches deposit allergens mainly in the kitchen [42, 43]. In con-
trast, bed bugs, like dust mites [44], aggregate and defecate near their human host (Fig 1), and
histamine is deposited on or near where humans sleep and spend arguably the longest amount
of time during the day. Therefore, like potent dust mite allergens, bed bug-derived histamine
may pose health risks due to its proximity and persistence in our breathing space. In addition,
cutaneous exposure to histamine that has accumulated on bedding materials may be of con-
cern. Histamine appears to induce developmental effects, including suppression of epidermal

 differentiation and thinning of the epidermis, which impairs the barrier function of the skin
[45, 46]. Persistent contact with high levels of histamine may therefore pose significant dermal
risks.
All bed bug interventions, including chemical and heat treatments [23], singularly focus on
bed bug abatement because the objectives are to reduce or eliminate bites. Our finding of hista-
mine persistence at least three months after bed bug eradication underscores the need to
develop and validate intervention strategies that eliminate histamine, in addition to eradicating
bed bugs. Prolonged exposure of homes to temperatures of 50˚C did not reduce histamine lev-
els in house dust. Therefore, a combination of deep cleaning and pest elimination will likely be
needed, similar to the strategies used to reduce German cockroach allergens [43]. We suggest
that a similar protocol be developed for bed bugs, and evaluated for its efficacy in reducing his-
tamine levels in homes, and ultimately reducing adverse health effects. Additionally, when
developing abatement strategies, we must also consider their effects on the movement and
distribution of histamine in homes. It is plausible, for instance, that the high temperatures and
air circulation during heat treatments could re-circulate histamine-containing dust particles
and deposit them in new locations with higher chances to become contacted, inhaled, or
consumed.
Conclusions
Bed bugs have become a major social, economic, and health problem since their global resur-
gence in the early 2000s. Infestations can reach exceedingly high levels, especially among the
elderly and in disadvantaged communities, where interventions may be unaffordable. While
bed bug bites have been recognized as a dermatological concern that can be exacerbated and

 lead to secondary infections, bed bugs have not been implicated as disease vectors or allergen
producers. The results of this study demonstrate that the presence of bed bugs strongly corre-
lates with histamine levels in homes, and thus may adversely affect the health of residents
through exposure to exogenous histamine. Furthermore, bed bug eradication with heat and
insecticides does not appear to reduce histamine levels in homes, suggesting high thermal and
chemical stability of histamine. Future investigations should first expand the sample size of the
present work, to ensure that our findings are not confounded by any other undetected vari-
ables. In addition, future studies should evaluate temporal and spatial dynamics of histamine
deposition in bed bug-infested homes, health impacts of dermal and respiratory exposure to
environmental histamine, and the efficacy of various mitigation strategies to reduce histamine
in homes. The intimate association of bed bugs with humans and the spatial distribution and
persistence of histamine in homes suggest that histamine may represent an emergent indoor
environmental contaminant whose impact on human health should be investigated.
