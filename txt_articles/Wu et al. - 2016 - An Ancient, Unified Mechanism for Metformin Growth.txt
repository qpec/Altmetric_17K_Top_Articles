SUMMARY
Metformin has utility in cancer prevention and
treatment, though the mechanisms for these ef-
fects remain elusive. Through genetic screening in
C. elegans, we uncover two metformin response ele-
ments: the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and acyl-
CoA dehydrogenase family member-10 (ACAD10).
We demonstrate that biguanides inhibit growth
by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory capacity,
which restrains transit of the RagA-RagC GTPase
heterodimer through the NPC. Nuclear exclusion
renders RagC incapable of gaining the GDP-bound
state necessary to stimulate mTORC1. Biguanide-
induced inactivation of mTORC1 subsequently in-
hibits growth through transcriptional induction of
ACAD10. This ancient metformin response pathway
is conserved from worms to humans. Both restricted
nuclear pore transit and upregulation of ACAD10 are
required for biguanides to reduce viability in mela-
noma and pancreatic cancer cells, and to extend
C. elegans lifespan. This pathway provides a unified
mechanism by which metformin kills cancer cells
and extends lifespan, and illuminates potential
cancer targets.
INTRODUCTION
Metformin has been used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) for nearly
60 years. It also has potential benefit in cancer prevention and
treatment (Evans et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2013). The class
of drugs to which metformin belongs, the biguanides, inhibit
cellular growth in a variety of cancer cell lines, particularly in mel-
anoma (Yuan et al., 2013) and pancreatic cancer cells (Kordes
et al., 2015). While it is widely accepted that the mitochondrion
is a primary target of metformin (Griss et al., 2015; Owen et al.,
2000; Wheaton et al., 2014), exactly how mitochondrial inhibition
by metformin is transduced to the drug’s other health-promoting
effects, including its anticancer properties, remains unclear.
Mitochondrial inhibition by metformin causes energetic stress,
which results in activation of the energy sensor adenosine mono-
phosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Zhou et al., 2001).
However, multiple lines of evidence indicate that AMPK is
dispensable for metformin’s beneficial effects (Foretz et al.,
2010; Griss et al., 2015; Kalender et al., 2010), invoking other
major metformin effectors downstream of mitochondria.
The protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1), which also serves as an energy and nutrient sensor,
plays a central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation and
survival (Schmelzle and Hall, 2000). Inhibition of mTORC1 activ-
ity has been reported in cells in culture treated with metformin,
suggesting that reduced TOR activity may be important for the
metabolic effects of biguanides (Kalender et al., 2010). In sup-
port of this idea, both metformin and canonical mTOR inhibitors
have highly similar effects on the transcriptome, selectively
decreasing mRNA levels of cell-cycle and growth regulators
(Larsson et al., 2012). Several, distinct pathways are known to
regulate mTORC1 signaling, including TSC-Rheb and Ras-
related GTP-binding protein (Rag) GTPase-mediated signaling
(Sancak et al., 2008). Metformin may inhibit mTORC1 via
modulation of Rag GTPases (Kalender et al., 2010), but the
mechanism by which this occurs is uncharacterized. It has
been suggested that the pathway that leads to metformin-medi-
ated inhibition of mTORC1 could represent a distinct mechanism
of mTORC1 regulation, since no signaling pathway has been
identified that connects the mitochondrion to mTORC1 without
involvement of AMPK (Sengupta et al., 2010). Whether a

 mitochondrial-mTORC1 signaling relay plays a role in the action
of metformin is still unknown.
As in mammals, metformin promotes health and extends
lifespan in C. elegans (Cabreiro et al., 2013; De Haes et al.,
2014; Onken and Driscoll, 2010), raising the possibility of
conservation of genetic pathways responsible for metformin’s
beneficial effects. Using unbiased, iterative genetic screens in
C. elegans, we identified a single, central genetic pathway by
which metformin regulates growth. We report two elements
absolutely required for the anti-growth properties of metfor-
min: the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and acyl-CoA dehydro-
genase family member 10 (ACAD10). These two metformin
response
elements
were
used
to
illuminate
the
major,
biological pathway through which metformin induces its favor-
able effects. Remarkably, this ancient pathway unifies mito-
chondria, the NPC, mTORC1, and ACAD10 into a single
signaling relay that mediates metformin’s anti-aging effects

RESULTS
Metformin Induces Growth
Inhibition by Increasing CeACAD10
Expression in C. elegans
Metformin
elicits
a
dose-dependent
decrease in C. elegans growth (Fig-
ure 1A), unlike its non-dose-dependent
effect on lifespan (Cabreiro et al., 2013).
This result parallels metformin’s ability
to
inhibit
growth
of
certain
cancers
(Yuan et al., 2013), leading us to hypothesize that we could use
the worm to unearth mechanistic targets of biguanides, including
metformin and phenformin, in neoplasia. To identify conserved
targets of biguanides involved in growth inhibition, we con-
ducted an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in C. elegans of
1,046 genes annotated to have a role in metabolism by gene-
ontology term. Metformin sensitivity RNAi induce slow growth
and reduce body size with 25 mM metformin, a dose that has
no effect on controls, whereas metformin resistance RNAi permit
animals to grow on plates with 150 mM metformin, a dose that
elicits profound developmental delay and growth inhibition in
controls (Figures 1B, S1A and S1B). RNAi knockdown of 13
genes leads to metformin resistance, whereas RNAi of 5 genes
causes metformin sensitivity (Figures 1B, S1B, S1C, and S1D).
Consistent with the idea that mitochondria are the primary
target of metformin (Madiraju et al., 2014; Owen et al., 2000),
three metformin sensitive RNAi encode mitochondrial proteins,

 including a complex I subunit (Y53G8AL.2), a subunit of pyruvate
dehydrogenase (pdha-1) and a component of the proton-trans-
porting ATP synthase complex (immt-1) (Figures 1B, S1B
and S1D). We also find that genetic loss-of-function mutants
of mitochondrial respiration components gas-1 and mev-1 are
hypersensitive to 25 mM metformin (Figure S1E).
Knockdown of the C. elegans ortholog of acyl-CoA dehydro-
genase family member 10 (CeACAD10, F37H8.3) by RNAi led
to the greatest degree of metformin resistance (Figures 1B,
S1B and S1C). CeACAD10 RNAi and a genetic loss-of-function
mutation in CeACAD10 render animals 3-fold more resistant
to 100 mM metformin relative to controls (Figures 1C and 1D).
In order to study CeACAD10 protein expression, we generated
transgenic C. elegans CeACAD10 translational fluorescent
reporter (Figure 1G). Consistent with CeACAD10 being both
necessary and sufficient for biguanide-induced growth inhibi-
tion, CeACAD10 overexpression itself leads to slow growth of
C. elegans and makes the animals hypersensitive to metformin
(Figure 1E).
CeACAD10 mRNA expression is elevated over 2-fold by
50 mM metformin, and �4-fold by 5 mM phenformin (Figure 1F).
The intensity of the CeACAD10 reporter is induced �7- and �9-
fold by metformin and phenformin, respectively, indicating that a
more pronounced increase in CeACAD10 protein accompanies
the
mRNA
increase
(Figures
1G
and
1H).
Microscopy
of C. elegans CeACAD10 reporter animals indicates predomi-
nantly cytoplasmic localization (Figures 1G and S1F). Unbiased
co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and mass spectrometry of
CeACAD10::mRFP revealed enrichment of interacting proteins
involved in growth and post-embryonic development, as well
as proteins harboring ribosomal and mitochondrial cellular
component gene ontology terms (Table S1). These data are sup-
portive of the idea that CeACAD10 may play a role in growth
through regulation of protein translation and fundamental cellular
energetics.
Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation, CeTORC1 and
CeACAD10 Act in the Same Pathway Mediating the
Response to Metformin
To determine whether CeACAD10 lies in the same pathway
with previously reported metformin targets, we examined the
effects of targeting AMPK, mitochondria, and CeTORC1 on
CeACAD10 expression. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I
with rotenone or gas-1 RNAi in C. elegans elevates CeACAD10
mRNA and CeACAD10 reporter expression (Figures 2A and
2B). Mitochondrial inhibitors antimycin A and oligomycin A
also induce a robust increase in CeACAD10 mRNA (Fig-
ure S2A). Similarly, reduced function of CeTORC1 by RNAi
or chemical inhibition using rapamycin leads to induction
of CeACAD10 mRNA and the CeACAD10 reporter (Fig-
ures 2A-2C).
We next conducted combinatorial analysis to determine
whether mitochondria, CeTORC1, and CeACAD10 lie in a sin-
gle metformin response pathway. RNAi of gas-1 or daf-15
does not have an additive effect with metformin on CeACAD10
induction (Figure 2D). Additionally, animals treated with gas-1
RNAi do not further increase CeACAD10 expression or further
reduce body size when exposed to rapamycin, supporting
the idea that the mitochondria, CeTORC1 and CeACAD10
lie in a single genetic pathway (Figures S2B and S2C). RNAi
of gas-1 or daf-15 significantly decreases the body size of
C. elegans, but has no additive reduction when co-adminis-
tered with metformin (Figure 2E). While it is not clear whether
the non-additive effect of metformin with gas-1 and daf-15
RNAi is because growth inhibition is near maximal with met-
formin or because mitochondria and CeTORC1 truly lie in a
pathway with metformin, stronger evidence is provided by
the fact that RNAi to CeACAD10 suppresses 50% of the
slow growth evident in animals deficient in daf-15 (Figures
2F and S2D).
In keeping with reports indicating that metformin exerts its ef-
fects independently of AMPK (Foretz et al., 2010; Kalender et al.,
2010), metformin is still able to induce CeACAD10 expression in
mutants lacking the AMPKa catalytic subunit aak-2 (Figure S2E).
Further, the AMPK agonist AICAR does not induce CeACAD10
mRNA or protein expression (Figures S2F and S2G). Finally, mu-
tants lacking either one or both of the AMPKa subunits aak-1 and
aak-2 show growth inhibition comparable to wild-type animals
when treated with metformin (Figure S2H).
Metformin has been reported to extend lifespan indirectly
through effects on the bacterial E. coli diet of C. elegans
(Cabreiro et al., 2013). In contrast, metformin induces the
CeACAD10 reporter equally well when added to cultures of
live or UV-killed bacteria (Figure S2I). Direct injection of metfor-
min into the intestine of C. elegans also induces the CeACAD10
reporter (Figure S2J). Finally, metformin blocks growth in
C. elegans whether animals are fed cultures of live or UV-killed
bacteria (Figure S2K). These data are consistent with a direct
effect of metformin on CeACAD10 induction and growth inhibi-
tion in C. elegans.
(F) CeACAD10 RNAi suppresses the effect of CeTORC1 deficiency on body size reduction by daf-15 RNAi (see Figure S2B for knockdown efficiencies). Data are
presented as a fraction mean of the body size reduction by daf-15 RNAi ± SEM n = 27–44; **p < 0.01 and no significance (ns), by two-way ANOVA.
(G) Sequences of the CeACAD10 promoter reporter (top) are sufficient to confer induction by metformin (bottom). The promoter reporter is only used in this figure.

of-function skn-1(lax188) mutants. n = 3 biological replicates; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and no significance (ns), by two-way ANOVA.
(J) RNAi of skn-1 partially suppresses the effects of 50 mM metformin, 5 mM rotenone and 100 mM rapamycin on CeACAD10 expression. n = 3 biological rep-
licates; **p < 0.01, by two-way ANOVA.
(K) Effect of skn-1 RNAi on 100 mM metformin-induced growth suppression. n = 3 biological replicates; *p < 0.05, by two-way ANOVA.

 The Stress-Responsive Transcription Factor SKN-1
Partially Mediates CeACAD10 Induction by Metformin
Analysis of a CeACAD10 promoter reporter indicates that
metformin activates transcription of the CeACAD10 gene (Fig-
ure 2G). An RNAi screen of 708 transcription factors identified
skn-1 as the only knockdown that blocks the effect of
metformin on CeACAD10 induction (Figure 2H). A null muta-
tion in skn-1 also partially suppresses metformin effects on
CeACAD10 mRNA induction (Figure 2I). A gain-of-function
mutation in skn-1 (Paek et al., 2012) induced CeACAD10
mRNA �2.5-fold and was non-additive with metformin (Fig-
ure 2I). While skn-1 has been previously invoked in the lifespan
extension attributable to metformin and inhibition of CeTORC1
(Cabreiro et al., 2013; De Haes et al., 2014; Onken and Dris-
coll, 2010; Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012), skn-1 is only partially
responsible for CeACAD10 induction, as metformin, rotenone,
and rapamycin can still induce CeACAD10 2- to 3-fold
following RNAi to skn-1 (Figures 2H–2J). RNAi of skn-1 re-
duces metformin-mediated growth inhibition significantly, but
to a much lesser extent than CeACAD10 RNAi (Figure 2K).
As expected, based upon higher CeACAD10 expression,
skn-1 gain-of-function mutants are smaller than controls, but
do not show additive growth inhibition with metformin treat-
ment (Figure 2L).
In order to test whether skn-1 directly mediates the increase in
CeACAD10 expression, we conducted chromatin IP of SKN-1.

dance following treatment with metfor-
min, with no change evident in the
30UTR region (Figure S2L). These data
agree with the absence of a SKN-1::
GFP binding site in CeACAD10 gene
ModENCODE data and in prior SKN-1
ChIP studies (Steinbaugh et al., 2015).
We did not see nuclear translocation
of a SKN-1::GFP reporter post metfor-
min treatment, while clear translocation
was evident with hydrogen peroxide
(Figure S2M). In summary, these data
indicate that factors other than skn-1 are primarily responsible
for CeACAD10 induction and the action of biguanides on
growth.
The Nuclear Pore Complex Is Required for Metformin-
Induced CeACAD10 Expression and Growth Inhibition in
C. elegans
To identify the genetic machinery responsible for CeACAD10
induction by metformin, we carried out an unbiased, forward
genetic screen for suppressors of metformin’s effect on
the CeACAD10 reporter. Using whole-genome sequencing,
we determined that the two most potent suppressive mu-
tants carry missense mutations in genes encoding two
distinct components of the NPC, npp-3/NUP205 (Nucleoporin
205 kDa) and npp-21/TPR (translocated promoter region).
Both mutations, NPP-3(E1644K) and NPP-21(P1501L), as
well as RNAi to npp-3 and npp-21, entirely blunt the effect
of metformin on induction of CeACAD10 expression at both
the mRNA and protein level (Figures 3A–3D). RNAi of npp-21
does not universally suppress transgene expression (Figures
S3A–S3C).
Strikingly, mutation of npp-3 or npp-21 also renders animals
resistant to metformin’s growth-inhibiting effects (Figure 3E),
comparable to CeACAD10 loss of function. RNAi of npp-21 abol-
ished the anti-growth effect of metformin in C. elegans, indi-
cating that the mutations obtained in npp-3 and npp-21 are
loss-of-function alleles (Figure 3F).

 An Ancient and Unified Mitochondria-NPC-mTORC1
Signal Relay Mediates the Action of Metformin
To determine the genetic relationships of mitochondria, NPC,
CeTORC1, and CeACAD10 in the metformin response pathway,
we examined CeACAD10 expression following treatment with
rotenone or rapamycin. Both rotenone and rapamycin induce
CeACAD10 in a wild-type background (Figures 4A and 4B),
consistent
with
genomic
inhibition
of
mitochondria
and
CeTORC1 (Figure 2B). However, the effect of rotenone on
CeACAD10 induction is abolished in the npp-21 mutant back-
ground, whereas rapamycin still induces the same increase as
it does in wild-type (Figures 4A and 4B). These results place
the mitochondria upstream of the NPC in metformin action and
establish CeTORC1 as acting downstream of the NPC.
To determine whether this metformin growth inhibitory
pathway is conserved, we examined mTORC1 activity in human
cells after RNAi to NPC components. Treatment with metformin,
rotenone, and rapamycin leads to potent inhibition of ribosomal
S6 protein phosphorylation (Figure 4C). Upon depletion of NPC
component TPR by RNAi, neither metformin nor rotenone is
able to inhibit S6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C). These results
confirm that the NPC is a critical effector of the metformin
response pathway, connecting decreased mitochondrial activity
to inhibition of mTORC1. Consistent with mTORC1 lying down-
stream of the NPC in the response to biguanides, RNAi knock-
down of TPR does not block the inhibitory effect of rapamycin
(Figure 4C). RNAi knockdown of NPC components NUP205,
NUPL1, NUP153, NUP214, and NUP98 also fully suppressed

Phenformin Restrains Passage of
Macromolecules through the NPC
As certain cancer cell lines lack the met-
formin transporter protein OCT2 (Yuan
et al., 2013) and as phenformin can
induce the same or even more potent ef-
fects on CeACAD10 induction, we used
phenformin to study how biguanides
affect the NPC. Phenformin did not alter
localization or apparent density of NPCs
in HeLa cells, as assessed by immunoflu-
orescence (Figure S5A). Phenformin does not alter the expres-
sion of NPC components at the mRNA level in C. elegans and
two different cell lines, HEK293E and melanoma C8161 cells
(Figures S5B–S5D) or protein level in HEK293E cells (Figures
4C and S5E).
Certain components of the NPC have been reported to act in
roles outside of the NPC (Simon and Rout, 2014). To determine
whether it is their role in the NPC by which identified components
mediate metformin-induced growth inhibition, we conducted
RNAi to 18 additional functionally and structurally distinct NPC
genes in C. elegans. All of these RNAi significantly suppress
metformin’s effect on CeACAD10 induction (Figure 5A). Thus,
reduced NPC component expression produces metformin resis-
tance, and npp-3 and npp-21 operate in their role specific to the
NPC in order to transduce metformin’s effects.
We next asked whether biguanides exert their antigrowth
activities by altering NPC activity. Loss of function of NPC
components such as NUP205 is known to increase passage
of macromolecules through the nuclear pore (Galy et al.,
2003). Indeed, biguanides have the opposite effect, restricting
passive transport of macromolecules through the NPC in mel-
anoma cells (Figure 5B). In contrast, biguanides had no effect
on active nuclear import of a constitutive NLS::GFP (Fig-
ure S5F). Consistent with our earlier results, protein levels of
the NPC subunit NUP98, which, along with other FG motif pro-
teins, is critical for maintaining the permeability barrier of the
NPC (Labokha et al., 2013), are unchanged by phenformin
(Figure S5E).
1710
Cell 167, 1705–1718, December 15, 2016
 As biguanides restrict passive transport through the NPC and
loss of function of NPC components suppresses biguanide ef-
fects, loss of function of various nuclear pore proteins should
reverse the ability of biguanides to restrict passive NPC trans-
port. Indeed, RNAi to TPR, NUP205, NUP214, NUP98, and
NUP85 in HeLa cells prevented phenformin from restricting nu-
clear entry of fluorescent dextrans of 70 kDa (Figures 5C and
S5G). We found this surprising given that many of these NPC
components have not been reported to play a role in nuclear
passive transport (Timney et al., 2016). RNAi to these same
components did not affect active nuclear transport of a consti-
tutive NLS::GFP (Figure S5H).
As metformin has well reported effects on mitochondrial func-
tion (Madiraju et al., 2014; Wheaton et al., 2014), we next sought
to mechanistically tie biguanide action at the mitochondrion to
changes in NPC activity. We reasoned that metformin might
affect NPC activity through reduction in cellular energy stores

with the uncoupling agent 2,4-dinitro-
phenol (DNP) which lowers both ATP
and ROS increases CeACAD10 mRNA
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5E). These data suggest
that biguanides alter NPC transport by reducing cellular ATP
levels.
Phenformin Inhibits Rag GTPase-Mediated mTORC1
Signaling by Restricting RagA/RagC Nuclear Access
Inhibition of nuclear export with leptomycin is known to inhibit
mTORC1
(Kim
and
Chen,
2000).
We
hypothesized
that
biguanides inhibit mTORC1 activity in part by altering nucleocy-
toplasmic partitioning of essential mTORC1 pathway proteins.
Of mTORC1 pathway proteins analyzed, only RagC showed a
significant nuclear proportion under basal conditions (Figure 6A).
Following treatment with phenformin, the majority of RagC was
excluded from the nucleus, while the overall level of RagC was
not altered (Figures 6A and 6B and S6A).
Given that RNAi to NPC components suppresses biguanide
effects on ACAD10 expression and increases nuclear entry of

 70 kDa dextrans, we reasoned that RNAi to TPR should allow
RagC to enter the nucleus even upon phenformin treatment.
RNAi to TPR fully reversed reduced nuclear RagC levels
evident with phenformin (Figure 6C) and moreover re-animated
mTORC1 in spite of phenformin treatment (Figure S6B).
Analysis of the Rag protein sequences revealed that only
RagC harbors a predicated nuclear export signal (NES). Mutation
of its predicted NES led to a significant rise in nuclear RagC,
whereas wild-type RagC is largely cytoplasmic (CW versus
CDNES, Figure S6C). Demonstrating that phenformin prevents
RagC nuclear localization, even RagCDNES fails to localize to
the nucleus with phenformin pretreatment.
RagC does not, alternatively, have a predicted, canonical nu-
clear localization signal (NLS). Curiously, even the addition of an
NLS to RagC failed to drive it to the nucleus when co-expressed
with wild-type RagA (Figure S6D). The majority of Rag proteins
exist in the cell in heterodimeric form, with RagA and RagB asso-
ciating with either RagC or RagD (Sancak et al., 2008). This
raised the possibility that the Rag binding partner of RagC rather
than RagC itself is the trigger for nuclear entry.
Activation state and conformation of Rag family proteins is
driven by guanine nucleotide-bound state. Previous studies
have made use of mutations in Rag proteins that mimic the acti-
vated and inactive conformations (Oshiro et al., 2014; Sancak
et al., 2008). When RagA is in the GTP bound state and RagC
the GDP bound state, the RagA/RagC heterodimer is fully
capable of activating mTORC1 (Sancak et al., 2008). Alterna-
tively, RagA (or RagB) carrying mutations mimicking the GDP
bound state act as dominant negative suppressors of mTORC1
activation (Figures 6E and S6E) (Sancak et al., 2008). Here we
also made use of RagA and RagC mutations that mimic the
activated and inactive conformations (RagAA: RagA(Q66L)
mimics active RagAGTP; RagAI: RagA(T21L) mimics inactive
RagAGDP; RagCA: RagC(S75L) mimics active RagCGDP; RagCI:
RagC(Q120L) mimics inactive RagCGTP; RagAW and RagCW:
wild-type proteins).
We hypothesized that inactive RagAI might act as an inhibitor
of mTORC1 because RagAGDP serves as the normal trigger for
nuclear entry of the RagA/RagC heterodimer. Thus, mutant
RagAI could provide an unyielding stimulus to localize RagA/C
in the nucleus, preventing its exit to activate mTORC1. Indeed,
RagAI stimulated a massive, 51% shift in RagCW nuclear local-
ization, consistent with this form of RagA being the signal for
RagC nuclear entry (Figures 6D and S6F). RagC is driven to
the nucleus by RagAI regardless of its activation state, although
the RagCI form showed less propensity to go to the nucleus
(Figure 6D). Virtually no RagC was detected in the nucleus
when co-expressed with RagAW or RagAA (Figure S6G). Pre-
treating cells with phenformin prevents RagAI from driving
RagC to the nucleus, supporting the conclusion that phenfor-
min-mediated NPC changes prevent the RagA/RagC complex
from entering the nucleus (Figure S6F). We further confirmed
that RagAI acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of mTORC1
signaling, no matter what form of RagC it is co-expressed
with (Figure 6E).
We next attempted rescue of phenformin-mediated mTORC1
suppression by expressing variants in RagA and RagC. Expres-
sion of any single isoform of RagA or RagC is not capable
of suppressing the phenformin effect (Figure S6E). Full sup-
pression of the phenformin effect requires both RagAA and
RagCA (Figures 6H and S6E). RagAA is only partially able to
suppress phenformin effect when co-expressed with RagCW,
similar to the result with RagCA co-expression with RagAW
(Figure 6H).
Our data support that RagC requires nuclear passage in order
to be fully capacitated to activate mTORC1. If this is correct, then
bulky modification of RagC that further restricts its nuclear
passage should not only prevent RagAA-mediated activation of
mTORC1 in phenformin treated cells, but we predict it might
also act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of mTORC1 action.
Indeed, increasing RagC molecular weight by �27 kDa and
78 kDa by coupling one or three GFP molecules to RagC, largely
and nearly completely restricts RagC from the nucleus of phen-
formin treated cells, respectively (Figure 6F). In support of
the idea that nuclear exclusion of RagC prevents its activation,
GFP-RagCW
and
3xGFP-RagCW
inhibit
mTORC1
in
the
basal state, even when co-expressed with RagAA (Figure 6G).
3xGFP-RagCW renders RagAA completely incapable of sup-
pressing phenformin’s effects on mTORC1 activity (Figures 6H
and S6H). Thus, when RagA cannot partner with any nuclear-
potentiated RagC, it cannot block biguanide-mediated suppres-
sion of mTORC1. As predicted, the induction of ACAD10 mRNA
(D) Overexpression of inactive RagA (AI) drives RagC in wild-type (CW), activated (CA), or inactive (CI) form to the nucleus in HEK293E cells (see STAR Methods for
molecular identity of mutants). A schematic model indicating that RagAI is the stimulus for RagC nuclear entry is shown. Blots shown are representative of three
biological replicates.
(E) Overexpression of RagAI acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of mTORC1. HEK293E cells were transfected with the indicated combination of RagA (AW, wild-

inhibiting mTORC1 (star 1) but not RagA-RagCI (star 2). n = 3 biological replicates; **p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA.

 by phenformin, which is conserved in mammalian cells, is fully
suppressed by the RagAA/RagCA complex but not the 3XGFP-
RagCW/RagAA (Figure 6I).
From these data it logically flows that RagC acquires
activation in the nucleus that potentiates is ability to activate
mTORC1.

Flag-RagC
by
mass spectrometry did not identify any phosphorylation,
acetylation, oxidation, or mono-, di- and tri-methylation that
distinguished control versus phenformin treatment, or cyto-
plasmic versus nuclear fractions (data not shown). Our next
hypothesis was that RagC transitions from the GTP-bound
inactive form to the GDP-bound active form during nuclear
transit. To this end, we examined nuclear extracts for GTPase
activating protein (GAP) activity for RagC. Indeed, the majority
of RagC GAP activity was seen in nuclear extract (Figure 6J),
and the reported GAP for RagC, folliculin (FLCN) (Tsun
et al., 2013), was detected in the nucleus (Figure S6I). These
data indicate that RagC is potentiated by nuclear GAP
activity that facilitates conversion of RagCGTP to activated
RagCGDP. In support of this, treatment of cells with phenfor-
min renders RagC incapable of binding mTORC1 by co-IP
(Figure 6K).
An Ancient Pathway Defined by ACAD10 and the NPC Is
Required for Metformin-Mediated Lifespan Extension
and Growth Inhibition in Cancer
Metformin promotes longevity in organisms as diverse as
C. elegans and mice (Barzilai et al., 2016). Accordingly, we
next analyzed whether the ACAD10-NPC signaling pathway
is involved in lifespan extension in C. elegans. Either RNAi or
genetic loss of function mutation in CeACAD10 or npp-21
completely abrogates lifespan extension mediated by metformin
(Figures 7A–7D and Table S2). These data suggest that this
signaling axis is involved in whole organism health, and so we
next moved to study the role of this pathway in human cancer
cells.
We first confirmed that ACAD10 expression is induced by
biguanides in human cells, including HEK293E (Figure 6I),
two melanoma cell lines C8161 and MeWo, and one pancre-
atic cancer cell line PANC1 (Figure 7E). Remarkably, RNAi to
NPC components TPR and NUP205 abolished the increase
of ACAD10 mRNA by phenformin in melanoma cells (Fig-
ure 7F), indicating conservation of the NPC-ACAD10 signaling
axis.
Working from our prior observation that phenformin inhibits
the growth of melanoma cells (Yuan et al., 2013), we next asked
whether the ancient mitochondria-NPC-mTORC1-ACAD10 ge-
netic pathway is a conserved mediator of the growth-inhibitory
properties of biguanides. Indeed, loss of function of the NPC
or ACAD10 leads biguanide-sensitive cancer cells to become
resistant to phenformin-mediated killing (Figures 7G and 7H;
knockdown efficiency in Figure S7).
DISCUSSION
Ancient and Unified Mechanism for Metformin’s
Lifespan-Extending and Anticancer Activities
Uncovered by C. elegans Genomics
Using iterative genomic screening in C. elegans, we identify a ge-
netic pathway linking metformin to inhibition of cancer growth
and lifespan extension (Figure 7I). We put forward an ancient,
conserved pathway that unifies metformin response elements
including the mitochondrion and mTORC1, adding mechanistic
understanding of how metformin inhibits mTORC1 by restraining
NPC transport. The reduction in mitochondrial function signals
to the NPC, which connects metformin to nuclear exclusion of
RagC, ultimately preventing activation of mTORC1. Finally, we
identify that inhibition of mTORC1 by biguanides leads to tran-
scriptional upregulation of the previously uncharacterized gene
ACAD10, a step absolutely required for the lifespan-extending
and anticancer activities of metformin (Figure 7I).
The Role of ACAD10 in Metformin Action and the TORC1
Pathway
From data presented here, we conclude that CeACAD10 expres-
sion levels are central to the effects of metformin in C. elegans.
Although function of human ACAD10 and its nematode ortholog
CeACAD10 are not fully characterized, our early results indicate
that proteins interacting with CeACAD10 are implicated in
growth, development, and in fundamental regulation of protein
translation and cellular energetics. Importantly, we show that
ACAD10 is a critical effector of TORC1-regulated organismal
growth. Further investigation will be needed to determine how
ACAD10 affects anabolic and catabolic processes downstream
of TORC1.
Genetic analysis of CeACAD10 enabled us to demonstrate
that mitochondria, the NPC, TORC1, and ACAD10 all participate
in a single metformin response pathway. Importantly, SKN-1, a
proven regulator of metformin action in worms (Cabreiro et al.,
2013; De Haes et al., 2014; Onken and Driscoll, 2010), is partially
responsible for metformin-induced CeACAD10 upregulation, but
based upon our analysis, regulation of CeACAD10 by SKN-1 is
likely to be indirect. As reduction of skn-1 only modestly inhibits
the growth inhibitory properties of metformin, we conclude that
residual CeACAD10 induction is sufficient to mediate metformin
effects, and additional transcription factors are responsible for
the full spectrum of biguanide-mediated growth inhibition.
NPC Conformational Changes Are Linked to Metformin
and Altered Cellular Energetics
Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the anti-
cancer activity of metformin is attributable to its inhibition of
mitochondrial complex I (Wheaton et al., 2014). Cancer cells
become markedly resistant to metformin when expressing high
levels of the metformin-resistant S. cerevisiae mitochondrial

 complex I component, NADH reductase (NDI1). Mitochondria-
directed metformin analogs are 1,000 times more potent than
metformin at killing cancer cells (Cheng et al., 2016). It has
been previously shown that metformin can decrease cellular
ATP levels by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) in a dose-dependent manner (Foretz et al., 2010),
consistent with its dose-dependent antigrowth property in
C. elegans and cancer.
In a surprising twist, we show that it is metformin’s effects on
the nuclear pore that are the essential determinant of cell growth,
not the drop in ATP levels and OXPHOS activity themselves. This
conclusion is in line with prior observations in the literature
relating mitochondrial function and ATP levels to nucleocyto-
plasmic transport. Mitochondrial OXPHOS produces the major-
ity of cellular ATP that is required for NPC conformational
changes that dictate nuclear pore opening or closure (Rakowska
et al., 1998). Direct visualization of NPC by atomic force
microscopy has been used to show that ATP depletion alters
NPC conformation (Rakowska et al., 1998). Mitochondria are
frequently observed in close contact with the nuclear envelope,
and this juxtaposition may serve to as a conduit by which
mitochondria provide energy for nucleocytoplasmic transport
through the NPC (Prachar, 2003). Thus, alterations in the NPC
in upon ATP deprivation are well poised to modulate NPC-regu-
lated signaling.
Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling Regulates mTORC1
Activity via RagC
Nucleus-localized
components
of
the
mTORC1
signaling
pathway have been widely reported (Betz and Hall, 2013),
including mTOR, Raptor, and TSC. Nuclear distribution of these
proteins has substantial effects on mTOR signaling (Back and
Kim, 2011), especially mTOR itself (Kim and Chen, 2000).
Consistent with our observations, the yeast ortholog RagC/
Gtr2 has been reported in the nucleus in previous studies (Hirose
et al., 1998).
Based upon our results, we conclude that biguanides exclude
RagC from the nucleus by restricting passive transport through
nuclear pores. It has been previously established that RNAi to
nuclear pore components generally enhances rather than re-
stricts passive nucleocytoplasmic transport (Galy et al., 2003).
Indeed our work suggests that loss of function of a larger group
of NPC components than previously appreciated (Timney et al.,
2016) affects passive diffusion through the NPC, re-animating
nuclear RagC and mTORC1 activity. We cannot conclusively
rule out the possibility that other aspects of NPC transport are
modulated by biguanides or that these might play a role in nu-
clear transport of the Rag proteins. Future work will be needed
to determine the full spectrum of biguanide-mediated effects
on the NPC.
We propose that RagC enters the nucleus with RagA in its
inactive conformation, RagC acquires the activated, GDP bound
form and, that RagA/RagC exits the nucleus to activate mTORC1
signaling. As would be expected, modifications of RagC that
prevent nuclear entry (bulky 3xGFP tagging) or that prevent sub-
sequent exit of activated RagC (co-expression of inactive RagAI)
lead to dominant-negative like inhibition of mTORC1 activity. The
importance of subsequent nuclear export is underscored by
similar mTORC1 inhibition when we mutate the putative NES
on RagC. In support of our model, others’ work corroborates
our observation that RagAI is found in the nucleus (Hirose
et al., 1998). Demonstrable nuclear RagC GAP activity and
the nuclear existence of the RagC GAP FLCN support the
conclusion that RagC nuclear transit is critical for activation of
mTORC1. Other studies have reported the presence of nuclear
FLCN by immunofluorescence (Tsun et al., 2013). While our
data do not rule out that cytoplasmic GAP activity also activates
RagC, under the circumstances tested, our data suggest the
nuclear context of FLCN rather than its bulk amount is important
for its GAP activity toward RagC. Finally, our data neither confirm
nor deny the exciting possibility of other modes of nuclear
potentiation of RagC.
The underlying mechanisms how Rag GTPases mediate
mTORC1 signaling are still unclear. The Rag heterodimer is
rendered fully capable of activating mTORC1 when RagA/B is
bound to GTP and RagC/D to GDP (Sancak et al., 2008). Prior
work suggests that activating mutations in RagC strengthen its
affinity for Raptor, an important step in mTORC1 activation (Osh-
iro et al., 2014). We suggest that activating mutations in RagA
and RagC bypass the need for nuclear passage of RagC by
mimicking the activation step normally acquired in the nucleus,
fully animating mTORC1 even in the face of biguanide treatment.
An overarching implication of our findings is that the RagC-
NPC signaling axis is a major means by which TORC1 activity
is intimately linked to levels of cellular ATP. We suggest that
disruption of RagC-mediated mTORC1 activation might repre-
sent the elusive link between kinase activity and cellular energy
(ATP) levels.
Nuclear Transport in Aging, Cancer, and Aging-Related
Metabolic Disease
The NPC serves as the only conduit through which material ex-
changes between the cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells.
It has been postulated that modifying nuclear transport could be
an effective way to block tumor formation and growth, given that
increased nucleocytoplasmic transport has been invoked in can-
cer progression and antineoplastic agent resistance (Kinoshita
et al., 2012; Vargas et al., 2012). Here, we demonstrate that met-
formin induces growth inhibition in cancer by restricting NPC
transport, and that this effect can be reversed by RNAi to NPC
components. We conclude that modulating nuclear transport
machinery could be a general strategy for halting progression
of melanoma and other tumor types.
Nuclear leakiness has been previously implicated in age-
dependent deterioration in mammalian cells (D’Angelo et al.,
2009), and altering nuclear transport impacts yeast longevity
(Lord et al., 2015). In the current study, we prove that the
NPC is absolutely required for metformin to extend lifespan in
C. elegans. Thus, it is plausible that restraining nuclear transport
either by treatment with metformin or through other means might
also be a general strategy for promoting healthy aging.
We speculate that the NPC and ACAD10 may be involved
in insulin action and regulation of blood glucose levels. Though
little is known about ACAD10, it lies within a susceptibility
locus for T2D in Pima Indians (Bian et al., 2010). The NPC has
also been suggested to act in the insulin signaling pathway
1716
Cell 167, 1705–1718, December 15, 2016
 (Pinkston-Gosse and Kenyon, 2007). It remains an intriguing
possibility that the ancient pathway defined by the NPC and
ACAD10 underlies metformin’s antidiabetic actions and its ability
to improve insulin sensitivity.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Nematode Strains
All nematode strains were grown at 20�C, and maintained following standard procedures (Brenner, 1974). N2 Bristol was used as
the wild-type strain. The listed mutant strains were used: MGH325 CeACAD10(gk463343) II 4x, MGH275 aak-1(tm1944) III 4X,
MGH274 aak-2(ok524) X 4X, MGH276 aak-1(tm1944) III;aak-2(ok524) X 4X, MGH326 npp-3(alx43) II 3X, and MGH327 npp-
21(alx44) II 4X. The following transgenic lines were used: MGH249 alxIs19[CeACAD10p::CeACAD10::mRFP3-HA myo-2p::GFP]
8X, MGH328 alxEx90[CeACAD10p::CeACAD10::mRFP3-HA myo-2p::GFP], MGH322 npp-3(alx43);alxIs19 3X, MGH323 npp-21(al-
x44);alxIs194X, MGH277 aak-2(ok524);alxIs19 4X, CF1553 muIs84 [(pAD76) sod-3p::GFP + rol-6] 3X and MGH50 mgIs48[ges-1p::MI-
TO::GFP] 0X, LG326 skn-1(zu169) IV; geIs7[skn-1b::GFP].
Human Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
C8161 cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (PS, Life Technologies) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37�C. All other cell lines used in this study were grown in
high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PS in a 5% CO2
atmosphere at 37�C. For western blotting and cell fractions, HEK293E cells (a gift from Dr. Ramnik Xavier) were used. For cell viability
measurements, C8161 (ATCC), MeWo (ATCC) and PANC1 (a gift from Dr. Nabeel Bardeesy) cells were used. For nuclear perme-
ability testing, C8161 and HeLa cells were used. For GST-RagCW/FLAG-RagAX expression, HEK293T cells (ATCC) were used.
For ACAD10 mRNA level determination, HEK293E and C8161 cells were used. For immunofluorescence assays, HeLa cells
(ATCC) were used.
Chemicals and Antibodies
Metformin and phenformin (Sigma) were dissolved in water with the stock solutions as 1 M and 0.2 M respectively. AICAR (LC Lab-
oratories) was dissolved in water at 50 mM. Rotenone (Sigma) and rapamycin (LC laboratories) were dissolved in ethanol to make
2.5 mM and 10 mM stock solutions, respectively. For transfection, Lipofectamine 3000 was used according to the instructions of
manufacturer (Invitrogen). For western blotting, we used the anti-TPR antibody (NB100-2866, Novus Biologicals), the self-generated
anti-RagC antibody (Oshiro et al., 2014), and antibodies against p-S244/240 S6 (#2215), total S6 (#2217), mTOR, TSC2, Raptor as
well as RagA from Cell Signaling Technology, and FLAG-Tag from Sigma. For immunostaining of RagC, the same self-made Rabbit
RagC mAb and the corresponding secondary Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment (Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate, Cell Signaling
Technology) was used, while Alexa Fluor 594 anti-nuclear pore complex proteins antibody, mAb414, was used to stain NPCs
(BioLegend).
METHOD DETAILS
Feeding RNAi in C. elegans
The RNAi clones used in this study were all isolated from a genome-wide E. coli feeding RNAi library and fed to C. elegans as
described previously (Pino et al., 2013). Synchronous C. elegans were obtained by bleach treatment of gravid adults, and after
72 hr of RNAi feeding, animals were harvested and examined as day-1 adults unless noted otherwise. For the RNAi screen of
metformin response genes, the RNAi bacteria were seeded onto 96-well plates using NGM agarose supplemented with 5 mM
IPTG (US Biologicals) and 100 mg/mL carbenicillin (Sigma), free liquid was driven off in a laminar flow hood, and RNAi plates
were incubated at room temperature overnight. The following day, the indicated dose of metformin was added into 96-well
RNAi plates and free liquid was driven off in a laminar flow hood. Synchronous populations of L1 stage, wild-type worms
were dropped onto 96-well RNAi plates with or without metformin, and imaged directly from the RNAi plates after 3 days expo-
sure to drugs using a Leica DM6000 microscope at a magnification of 40X. Imaged worms were scored based on their stages
and sizes compared to controls.
Quantitative RT-PCR
To quantify changes in mRNA abundance in nematode and human cells, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according
to manufacturer instructions. RNA was treated with RNase free DNase prior to reverse transcription with the Quantitect reverse tran-
scription kit (QIAGEN). Quantitative PCR was conducted in triplicate using Quantitect SYBR Green PCR reagent (QIAGEN) following
manufacturer instructions on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad). For C. elegans, all assays were performed with
2,000 animals at late L4 stage per sample. Drug treatments were started from synchronous L1 larvae stage and ended as late-L4
stage. Drug treated worms were harvested by washing off of plates and washed an additional 4 times with M9 buffer, allowing worms
to settle by gravity between washes. RT-PCR assays for human cells were conducted with 2 X 105 cells post-24 hr drug treatments or
96 hr shRNA transduction. Both worms and cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in �80�C until RNA preparation. The
sequences of used primer sets were: for C. elegans: CeACAD10: 50-GCCATGCTGACAAACAACAT-30 and 50-TCAAATCGCATG

Expression levels of tested genes were presented as normalized fold changes to the mRNA abundance of act-1 for worms and
beta-actin for human cells respectively by the DDCt method.
Lentiviral shRNA Infection
Lentiviral shRNA constructs based in pLKO1 were obtained from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT Genetic Perturbation Plat-
form and are commercially available from Sigma. shRNA delivery was conducted as previously published (Yuan et al., 2012). shRNA
knockdown cells post-24 hr-selection with 2 mg/ml puromycin were treated in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml puromycin with or
without drugs for the indicated times followed by western blotting or cell viability measurement. The knockdown efficiency of targeted
genes by shRNA in different cell lines was examined by RT-PCR for mRNA levels under identical experimental conditions at the iden-
tical time of experiments.
Western Blotting
Cell lysates were prepared immediately following the indicated treatments by boiling in 0.5% SDS for 10 min, followed by incubation
on ice. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). SDS-PAGE was conducted on the same
day that lysates were made, followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane at 50 V for 16 hr at 4�C. Immunoblots
were performed according to primary antibody manufacturers’ protocols. For immunodetection of primary antibodies, goat-anti-rab-
bit-HRP conjugate (GE Healthcare) was used at 1:5,000 in 5% BSA dissolved in TBST, and HRP was detected using West-Pico
chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Pierce). The western blot results shown are representatives of at least two independent
biological replicates.
Immunofluorescence
HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6 well cell culture plates grown to about 50% confluence. Cells were treated with vehicle
and 1 mM phenformin for 24 hr, then washed twice in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were rinsed
twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After rinsing with PBS, cells were blocked in 3% BSA/PBS
for 30 min and then incubated in 3% BSA with anti-RagC antibody overnight. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then incu-
bated in 3% BSA with Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment (Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate) for 1 hr. For NPC immunostaining with
mAb414 antibody, the experiment was done exactly following the instructions from the manufacturer (BioLegend). Cells were then
rinsed three times for 5 min each in PBS and mounted using ProLong Diamond Antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Life Technol-
ogies). Images were captured using a Leica DM6000 microscope with a 63X oil immersion objective.
Body Size Determination of C. elegans
Animals, post-RNAi feeding, drug treatment, or combinations of both for 72 hr, were paralyzed in M9 buffer with 1 mg/ml levamisole
(Sigma),and then imaged at 5X magnificationona Leica DM6000 microscope.Maximal, longitudinal cross-sectional area oftheimaged
C. elegans was determined by using MetaMorph software for a minimum of 27 animals per condition in each experiment. Results of
single experiments are shown. Each experiment was performed at least twice, and results were consistent between experiments.
Creation of the CeACAD10 Fusion and Promoter Transgenic Lines
For the CeACAD10 reporter (Figure 1G), the entire genomic sequence of CeACAD10 locus (1367 bp), including introns and exons,
plus 2418 bp of promoter were amplified and cloned into a modified version of the commercial Fire vector pPD95.77 (the GFP region
was swapped with monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) with a C-terminal HA epitope tag) at the SbfI and SalI sites. The
following cloning primers were used for the fusion reporter: forward: 50-AGCCTGCAGGACCGTAGCTCCAGTGTCGATT-30 and
reverse: 50-AGCCTGCAGGTCCACAAAAATTGCTCATTGC-30. The same forward primer above was used for cloning the promoter
only transgenic line (Figure 2G), while the reverse one was: 50-CCGGGTACCTGCTGGGTCATAGTCATTTTG-30. Both fragments
were injected at 20 ng/ml into the gonad of wild-type adult animals. The CeACAD10 reporter was integrated into the genome with
250 J/m2 UV-C using a Stratalinker 2400 UV crosslinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and screened for the successfully
integrated lines, while the promoter only transgenic was used directly for expression tests post-metformin treatment.
Isolation of Metformin Suppressor Mutants
The reporter line was mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS, Sigma), and the resultant F2 generation was screened on
plates supplemented with 50 mM metformin for suppressors of CeACAD10 expression. Whole genome Illumina sequencing was em-
ployed followed by analysis and variant calling in Galaxy (Kim et al., 2008) to identify causal mutations. Causal mutations were
confirmed by Sanger sequencing and RNAi.

 CeACAD10 Reporter Fluorescence Intensity Analysis
Animals of the reporter line in either wild-type or mutant background were treated with drugs or RNAi for indicated times, paralyzed
with 1 mg/ml of levamisole, and then imaged in 96-well format with a Leica DM6000 microscope outfitted with a mCherry filter set and
MMAF software. Image analysis was conducted with MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc.) as described previously (Pino et al., 2013). All RFP
or GFP intensity tests were carried out in biological triplicate or quadruplicate with at least 30 animals tested per replicate.
ATP Measurement
500 synchronized young adult worms were collected in M9 buffer and washed three times. Worm pellets were treated with three
freeze/thaw cycles and boiled for 15 min to release ATP and destroy ATPase activity and then spun at 4�C at 12,000 3 g for
10 min. ATP content was measured with an ATP detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher,
A22066), and normalized to total protein content determined by BCA assay.
SKN-1 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Synchronous L4 animals ( �6,000 per plate x 8 large plates) were generated from three independent egg preps of SKN-1::GFP trans-
genic animals. Animals were washed in M9 with 0.005% Triton X-100 three times, washed once with M9 with 0.005% triton with 1%
formaldehyde, then frozen drop wise in 3 pellet volumes of the same cross-linking buffer (M9 plus 0.005% Triton X-100 plus 1% form-
aldehyde) in liquid nitrogen and kept at �80C. Pea-size frozen pellets were crushed in a dry-ice-chilled mortar and pestle, and ground
into powder until worm carcasses are disturbed. After thawing, animals were formaldehyde crosslinked at room temperature for
20 min, followed by quenching with 125 mM glycine (final concentration) at room temperature for 5 min. Pellets were washed three
times in ice cold PBS, spinning each time 2 min 4400 rpm between washes at 4C. Pellets were then resuspended in 2 pellet volumes
ice cold FA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES: adjust pH to 7.5 with KOH, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2%
Sodium Lauryl Sarcosine (AKA Sarkosyl; sodium lauryl sarcosinate), and 2 mM PMSF added immediately before use. Sonication was
conducted in a Qsonica Q800R with total sample volume not exceeding 180ul per tube with total sonication time of 25 min, amplitude
70%, 30 s pulses on alternating with 30 s off. The resulting chromatin was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000rpm (21,000 g) for 15 min
at 4C. The supernatant was retained and protein quantified. One mg of chromatin was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation
diluted to 1 mL final volume with no detergent FA Lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES: adjust pH to 7.5 with KOH, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, and 2 mM PMSF added immediately before use). Triton X-100 was added from 25% stock to 1% final concentration. Each
1 mL chromatin was pre-cleared with 30 ml of magnetic protein G Sepharose at 4�C for 1 hr. Fifty microliters were removed and
used to assess input DNA. Pre-blocked 30uL magnetic protein G-Sepharose (with 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.3 mg/ml of salmon sperm
DNA in FA lysis buffer + 1% Triton X-100) were added per IP (primary antibody and negative control IgG antibody) along with
5 mg of A-11120 mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or IgG2a isotype control (02-6200, Invitrogen). Chromatin IPs
were incubated overnight at 4�C on a Nutator. Beads were washed five times with 1 mL of no detergent FA lysis buffer + 1% Triton
X-100, followed by 1 mL of no detergent FA lysis buffer +1% Triton X-100 + 0.5 M NaCl (3 min wash end over end rotator). Beads were
washed with 1 mL TE and immune complexes were eluted with 100 mL ChIP elution buffer 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1%
SDS 10 min at 65�C. An equal volume of RNase A mix (50 mM Tris pH 8.0 99.5 parts to 0.5 part RNase A (Sigma R4642) in 50% glyc-
erol (stock 33 mg/mL)) was added to eluted ChIP and input samples and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. Thereafterer 2 mL per 100 mL of
20mg/mL ChIP Proteinase K (4 mL for 200uL of total volume, chromatin plus ChIP elution buffer; PK stock in water +50% glycerol,
Sigma P4850) was added to each sample followed by incubation 2 hr at 55C and then 6 hr to overnight at 65C to digest protein
and reverse cross links. DNA was cleaned in a QIAGEN PCR clean up column and eluted in 50 mL elution buffer. One half mL was
added to each qPCR reaction. Signal minus IgG background was expressed relative to the amount of input DNA after calculating
the amount of each qPCR reaction from an 8-point standard curve. Primers used for qPCR of ACAD10 genomic loci were as follows:
ACAD10p �460nt F, tttttgaacattttggttttgacc; ACAD10p �460nt R, ttccctcgctggaactgaac; ACAD10p �105nt F, gaccaactcgttcagtttt

Longevity Assay
Lifespan analysis was conducted at 20�C according to a protocol modified from our previous and other’s procedures (Cabreiro et al.,
2013). Briefly, synchronized L1 animals were seeded onto the standard nematode growth media (NGM) plates until L4 stages. On day
0, 30–50 L4 worms per plate (3 plates, 90–150 worms in total per condition) were transferred onto NGM (for mutants) or RNAi plates
(for RNAi) with or without metformin co-treatment. All plates were supplemented with 100 mM 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) solution to
suppress progeny production. Statistical analysis was performed with online OASIS2 resources (Han et al., 2016).
Cell Fractionation
Cell fractionation was carried out following a rapid and efficient protocol (Suzuki et al., 2010) to avoid possible loss of any nucle-
ocytoplasmic shuttling proteins from the nucleus during the time of isolation, with the following modifications. In this study sub
confluent HEK293E cells untreated or treated with 24 hr on 6-well plates were washed 3 times with ice cold PBS prior to fraction-
ation with 0.1% NP40 in PBS. Total lysates, cytosol and nuclear fractions were collected at each step of fractionation for western
blot analysis.

 Cell Viability Measurement
Cell viability analysis was conducted as previously described (Yuan et al., 2013). In brief, shRNA knockdown cells were seeded onto
96-well plates at a density of 800–1,000 cells per well, and drug treatment was initiated the following day. After 3 days of drug treat-
ment, the viability measurement was carried out with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Nuclear Permeability Assay
C8161 cells were plated with 3 X 105 cells per well onto sterilized coverslips in the base of 6-well plates 24 hr before drug treatment.
After 24 hr of drug treatment, cell membranes were permeabilized with 40 mg/ml digitonin in freshly made transport buffer (TB) con-
taining 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM
DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) at room temperature. Digitonin permeabilization times were optimized by using trypan
blue (Life Technologies) staining in C8161 cells (10 min) to efficiently permeabilize plasma membranes while keeping the nuclear en-
velope intact as indicated by full exclusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Dextran 500000-Conjugate (Sigma). Immediately after
semi-permeabilization, cells were rinsed twice with TB and incubated with fluorescent labeled dextran mixtures at the concentration
of 2 mg/ml of each dextran for 20 min, including FITC-Dextran 500000-Conjugate mixed with Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate
(TRITC)-Dextran average molecular weight 65,000–85,000 (Sigma) for C8161 cells. Then, coverslips were inverted onto a 15 ml drop
of Antifade mounting medium made with 1X PBS, 90% glycerol, and 2% n-propyl gallate (Sigma) for imaging. Images were taken
from randomly distributed fields of the coverslips using a Leica DM6000 microscope outfitted with a standard GFP filter set or
mCherry filter set and MMAF software at a 63X oil immersion objective. Scale bars were added using ImageJ software. The fluores-
cence intensities of intranuclear area and extranuclear background for each nucleus were measured using ImageJ, and the intensity
ratio of intranuclear and extranuclear levels was calculated to index nuclear permeability.
RagC Proteomic Analysis
Flag-tagged RagC and RagA were co-transfected into HEK293T cells in order to prepare four samples: 1) control (no drug) total
RagC, 2) total RagC subjected to treatment with 1 mM phenformin, 3) control (no drug) cytoplasmic RagC, and 4) control (no
drug) nuclear RagC. Flag-tagged RagC was immunopurified by large-scale immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads
(Sigma), eluted with Flag peptide and separated by SDS-PAGE. The 4 gel bands were in-gel digested with trypsin and analyzed by a
Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, which provided high-resolution MS peptide mass measurement and high-resolution MS/MS peptide
sequencing. We searched the 4 data files with both our in-house Sequest-based platform, as well as the commercial software PEAKS
in attempt to identify modifications in RagC. Overall sequence coverage was above 60% for phenformin and control, 90% for cyto-
plasmic and 50% for nuclear fractions, which correlated well with gel band intensity. For our in-house platform, we used a wide mass
tolerance no enzyme search and a single protein database. Identified peptides were limited to fully tryptic peptides having a ppm
tolerance of less than 10 ppm and a cross-correlation score of greater than 2.5. We specifically searched for oxidation, mono-,
di- and tri-methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation with our in-house software and 485 different modifications using the PEAKS
software.
GAP Assay
The GAP assay was performed to detect whether there is GAP activity present in the nucleus for the activation of RagC as described
previously (Oshiro et al., 2014) with minor modifications according to other recent work (Tsun et al., 2013). Briefly, in order to spe-
cifically monitor the GAP activity on RagC GTPase, the wild-type GST-RagCW construct (8 mg) was co-transfected with FLAG-
RagAQ66L;D130N (RagAXTP form, which only binds xanthosine containing nucleotides, 4 mg) into HEK293T cells in 10 cm tissue culture
plates using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher). Cells were collected 48 hr post-transfection for protein purification with glutathione
agarose. The purified heterodimer (25 mg) was first charged with 0.1 mM xanthosine triphosphate (XTP, sigma) to get RagA fully
charged with XTP to avoid interference with the GAP assay for RagC. Then the complex was incubated with a-32P-GTP to charge
RagC with labeled GTP for monitoring the GAP activity in the cell fractions. As indicated in Figure 6J, cytoplasmic and nuclear frac-
tions were added to the pre-charged Rag GTPase complex to determine which fraction has GAP activity toward RagC GTPase.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All the western blotting and dextran diffusion quantifications were conducted in ImageJ. The statistical analyses were performed us-
ing Prism (GraphPad Software). All values are presented with mean ± SEM and the number (n) of samples employed is indicated in
legends. The statistical differences between control and experimental groups were determined by one-way ANOVA, with p values <
0.05 considered significant. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed to determine
significance difference where genetic interferences and drug treatments were applied together. p values < 0.05 were considered sta-
tistically significant. The log rank test was used to determine significance in lifespan analyses.

 Supplemental Figures
Figure S1. Metformin Response Genes Identified from an RNAi Screen in C. elegans, Related to Figure 1
(A) Larval distribution of wild-type animals 3 days post exposure to metformin. The drug treatment to synchronized wild-type animals was begun at the L1 stage,
and the counting to determine proportion of worms at different larval stages was carried out on day 3 of drug treatment. Three independent experiments were
conducted (n = 45–92 animals are counted in each condition). Data represent means of three experiments and SEM.
(B) Representative DIC images of scores from the RNAi screen for genes rendering metformin resistance at 150 mM (highlighted with green boxes) and metformin
sensitivity at 25 mM (highlighted with red boxes). The scoring was conducted 3 days after synchronous L1 C. elegans were dropped on RNAi plates containing
metformin or not, when the animals fed bacteria carrying vector RNAi reached egg laying adult stage on no drug plates. In the metformin resistance screen with
150 mM metformin, colored in green, scores were assigned based on C. elegans stage (indicated with example images from animals experienced different RNAi
treatment, i.e., L1 (0), L1-L2 mixed stage (1), L2-L3 mixed (2), L3-L4 mixed (3), L4 (4), and egg laying adults (5)). In the metformin sensitivity gene screen with 25 mM
metformin colored in red, the scores also corresponded to C. elegans stages but with egg laying adults (0) – L1 (�5).
(C and D) Sample images of the hits with significant scores from the RNAi screen, including metformin resistance gene F37H8.3 (CeACAD10) (C) and metformin
sensitive mitochondrial genes (D). The C. elegans gene names are followed by names of their human orthologs.
(E) Animals carrying mutations in mitochondrial components gas-1/complex I and mev-1/complex II are hypersensitive to 25 mM metformin. n = 40–78 worms
analyzed; ##p < 0.01 and **p < 0.01, by two-way ANOVA.
(F) CeACAD10 expression in the head and body of C. elegans exhibits a mainly cytoplasmic distribution in the intestine (large areas of red fluorescence). Neurons
in the ventral nerve cord also express CeACAD10 (chain of bright dots) but this expression is not sensitive to biguanides (not shown).
 Figure S2. Evidence That CeACAD10 Induction by Metformin Is Dependent on Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation, CeTORC1, SKN-1
but Independent of AMPK and Bacterial Metabolism, Related to Figure 2
(A) Mitochondrial respiration inhibitors increase CeACAD10 mRNA levels. Administered concentrations of mitochondrial inhibitors were chosen based on the
published literature. Sub-toxic concentrations of the indicated drugs are enough to induce CeACAD10 expression, such as rotenone (a complex I inhibitor, 5 mM)
(Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012), antimycin A (a complex III inhibitor, 0.6 mM), and oligomycin A (a complex V inhibitor, 20 mM). Animals were treated from the
synchronous L1 stage and collected as L4 larvae. n = 3 biological replicates; **p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA.
(B and C) Inhibition of CeTORC1 by Rapamycin (100 mM) and deficiency of mitochondrial function by gas-1 RNAi do not induce additive effect on either CeA-
CAD10 induction (B) or growth inhibition (C). Synchronized L1 animals, CeACAD10 reporter for (B) and wild-type animals for (C) were dropped on to vector control
and gas-1 RNAi plates containing vehicle (equal volume of ethanol to rapamycin) or rapamycin. 3 days later, the animals were imaged and analyzed for changes
on CeACAD10 expression (B) and body area (C). n = 3 biological replicates for both experiments. ns, no significance; **p < 0.01, by two-way ANOVA.
(D) daf-15 mRNA levels post single or double RNAi treatment, indicating that daf-15 was equivalently knocked down with both single and double RNAi (relevant to
Figure 2F). The double RNAi was carried out with a 1:1 ratio of daf-15 with either vector or CeACAD10 RNAi. n = 3 biological replicates; **p < 0.01 and no
significance (ns), by two-way ANOVA.
(E) Metformin (50 mM) leads to a significant increase in CeACAD10 expression in either wild-type or aak-2 mutant animals. For this experiment, the CeACAD10
reporter was generated by crossing the reporter into the aak-2 mutant background (strain MGH277 aak-2(ok524);alxIs19[CeACAD10p::CeACAD10::mRFP3-HA
myo-2p::GFP]). Both the reporters in wild-type and the aak-2 mutant backgrounds were treated with vehicle or metformin (50 mM) for 3 days before being imaged
and analyzed for CeACAD10 induction. n = 3 biological replicates; **p < 0.01, by two-way ANOVA.
(F and G) AICAR, an AMPK agonist, does not alter CeACAD10 expression at either the mRNA level (F) or protein level (G, 1 mM AICAR, which is enough to induce a
significant decrease in fat mass in C. elegans (Sengupta et al., 2010)). n = 3 biological replicates; no significance (ns), by one-way ANOVA (F).
(H) Defects of AMPK catalytic subunits aak-1, aak-2 or both do not affect the growth inhibition of 100 mM metformin in C. elegans. Effect is normalized to the
vehicle control for each strain. Animals were treated as in (E). n = 46–82 worms; no significance (ns), by two-way ANOVA.
(I and J) Induction of CeACAD10 expression by metformin is independent of E. coli bacterial food source viability. Metformin (50 mM) increases CeACAD10
expression of C. elegans fed either live or UV-killed bacteria (I). Direct injection of metformin into the intestine of C. elegans induces CeACAD10 expression (J). The
injection site is indicated by a white arrow.
(K) Metformin-induced growth inhibition is also independent of bacterial viability. Synchronized wild-type L1 animals were dropped onto plates seeded with live or
dead bacteria killed by UV exposure according to published procedures (Watson et al., 2014), with or without metformin (100 mM). After 3 days of treatment, the
animals were imaged for body area analysis.
(L and M) SKN-1 is non-significantly altered on the CeACAD10 promoter region (L) and without clear nuclear translocation (M) post metformin treatment by ChIP
analysis. The same SKN-1::GFP reporter shown in (M) was used for ChIP assay (L) and nuclear trans localization test (M). For the CHIP assay, two CeACAD10
promoter fragments (one at �460 nucleotides (�460nt) and the other at �150 nucleotides (�150nt)) were monitored with the ACAD10 30 UTR (+1.7 kb) serving as
a negative control. Ten mM hydrogen peroxide drove SKN-1 to the nucleus after treating the L4 reporter animals for 20 min in M9 buffer as previously reported.
Animals were paralyzed with 1 mg/ml levamisole before imaging.

 Figure S3. The Metformin Response Suppressor npp-21 Is Not a Universal Transgene Suppressor, Related to Figure 3
(A–C) Deficiency of npp-21 by RNAi selectively suppresses CeACAD10 expression (A), but not expression of sod-3p::GFP (B) and ges-1::MITO::GFP (C) re-
porters. These three reporter lines were treated with vector or npp-21 RNAi as synchronous L1 larvae, imaged, and fluorescence intensity was quantified using a
custom MATLAB (The MathWorks) script as described previously (Pino et al., 2013). n = 3 biological replicates; **p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA. All bars indicate
means and SEM.
 Figure S4. Knockdowns NPC Components NUPL1 and NUP214 by shRNA Abolishes the Effects of Metformin and Rotenone, but Not Ra-
pamycin, on Reduction of Ribosomal S6 Protein Phosphorylation, Related to Figure 4
(A) Drug treatments of HEK293E cells post lentiviral shRNA knockdown were carried out in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml puromycin selection in the medium, with
8 mM metformin for 24 hr, 40 mM rotenone for 1 hr or 40 nM rapamycin for 1 hr, and levels of total and phospho-S240/244 ribosomal S6 protein were assessed by
western blotting.
(B) Knockdown efficiency of each targeted shRNA in HEK293E cells is normalized to that in cells treated by GFP shRNA. The mRNA level of each gene post the
target shRNA knockdown was related to its mRNA level in the GFP shRNA control group. n = 3 biological replicates; **p < 0.01, by one-way ANOVA.
 Figure S5. Biguanides Do Not Affect the NPC in A Canonical Way, Related to Figure 5
(A) Phenformin does not alter either the localization or density of the NPC. Post immunostaining the NPC with mAb414, HeLa cells with and without 1 mM
phenformin treatment were mounted with medium containing DAPI on slides for imaging on a Leica DM6000 microscope station. Images were taken at the
maximal cross-sectional nuclear area of cells to capture clear view of the nucleus indicated by DAPI in blue, and NPC in red (top panel). Also the top nuclear view
of cells was taken to observe NPC number changes or density alterations (lower panel). Scale bar, 10 mm.
(B–D) Biguanides do not alter mRNA expression of NPC components in C. elegans (A, 50 mM metformin or 5 mM phenformin) and mammalian cells (B and C,
1 mM phenformin). n = 3 biological replicates. All bars indicate mean and SEM.
(E) Phenformin does not alter protein level of the FG nucleoporin NUP98 while strongly suppressing mTORC1 activity, indicated by the dramatically decreased S6
phosphorylation level in 1 mM phenformin-treated HEK293E cells. Results are representative of two independent experiments.
(F) Phenformin does not affect the active transport of constitutive NLS-GFP reporter into the nucleus. The constitutive NLS-GFP reporter construct, carrying the
classic SV40 large T antigen NLS sequence, was transfected into HeLa cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 1 mM phenformin or
vehicle for 24 hr before being imaged. Images are representative of three independent experiments. Scale bar, 10 mm.
(G and H) Knockdown of NPC components, including TPR, NUP205, NUP98, NUP214 and NUP85, consistently facilitates passive transport (G) but does not
affect active transport through the NPC (H) in HeLa cells. Passive transport was assessed using the dextran diffusion assay in digitonin-permealized HeLa cells
after the indicated lentiviral shRNA knockdown (G). Greater proportions of 70 kDa dextran are seen in each RNAi but not in shGFP control cells. The effect of
targeted gene knockdown by shRNA on active nuclear transport (H) was tested by using the cNLS-GFP reporter as in (F).
(I and J) CeACAD10 expression is not affected by ROS-inducing compound paraquat at 2 mM (I) and metformin-induced ACAD10 expression is not attenuated by
adding ROS-scavenging reagents, BHA and NAC at varied doses (J). n = 2 for (I) and 3 biological replicates for (J). ns, no significance, by two-way ANOVA.
 Figure S6. Phenformin Inhibits mTORC1 Activity by Limiting Nuclear Access of the RagC/RagA Heterodimer, Related to Figure 6
(A) Phenformin does not alter the overall protein level of RagC. Samples treated or untreated by phenformin from 4 independent replicates were analyzed by
western blot and quantification of RagC levels with or without phenformin treatment (1 mM).
(B) TPR knockdown by lentiviral shRNA suppresses phenformin-induced inhibition of mTORC1 activity but does not increase RagC protein level. Results are
representative of two independent experiments in HEK293E cells.
(C) Mutations of the NES signal of RagC (CDNES) predicted by using NetNES (la Cour et al., 2004) increase its nuclear localization in HEK293E cells co-expressed
with wild-type RagA (AW), which can be restricted by 1 mM phenformin treatment. Results are representative of 3 biological replicates.
(D) Nuclear localization of wild-type RagC is not triggered by overexpression with a constitutive NLS sequence (NLSCW) when compared with wild-type RagC (CW)
coexpressed with wild-type RagA (AW). Results are representative of 2 independent experiments.
(E) Complete suppression of phenformin effect on mTORC1 inhibition requires RagC and RagA both in their activated state, i.e., RagCA/RagAA. Single and
combinational overexpression of various forms of RagC and RagA was conducted to determine suppression of phenformin effect by RagC/RagA heterodimers.
The indicated shorthand labels stand for: CW, RagC wild-type; CA, RagCS75L mutant, mimics activated RagC; CI, RagCQ120L mutant, mimics inactive RagC; AW,
RagA wild-type; AA, RagAQ66L mutant, mimics activated RagA; AI, RagAT21L mutant, mimics inactive RagA. Results are representative of 3 or more independent
experiments.
(F) Pre-treating HEK293E cells with phenformin prevented RagAI from driving RagC into the nucleus. Results are representative of two independent experiments.
(G) RagC does not shuttle into the nucleus when RagA is present in its wild-type (AW) or active (AA) state (HEK293E cells). Results are representative of three
biological replicates.
(H) Bulky modifications on RagC by adding GFP or 3XGFP tags renders RagC dominant negative toward regulation of mTORC1 activity in the basal state and
abolishes the CWAA heterodimer’s suppression of phenformin effect. Schematic of the constructs used is shown to the right. Results shown are representative of
three independent experiments.
(I) The putative RagC GAP, FLCN, is present in the nucleus. Blots are shown with short and long exposures. Results are representative of two independent
experiments.
