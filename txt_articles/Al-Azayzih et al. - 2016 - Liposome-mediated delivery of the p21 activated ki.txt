Abstract
P21 activated kinases-1 (PAK-1)is implicated in various diseases. It is inhibited by thesmall 
molecule ‘Inhibitor targeting PAK1 activation-3’ (IPA-3), which is highly specific but 
metabolically unstable. To address this limitation we encapsulatedIPA-3 in sterically stabilized 
liposomes (SSL). SSL-IPA-3 averaged 139 nm in diameter, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.05, 
and a zeta potential of −28.1, neither of which changed over 14 days; however, the PDI increased 
to 0.139. Analysis of liposomal IPA-3 levels demonstrated good stability, with 70% of IPA-3 
remaining after 7 days. SSL-IPA-3 inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in vitro with comparable 
efficacy to free IPA-3. Excitingly, only a 2 day/week dose of SSL-IPA-3 was needed to inhibit the 
growth of prostate xenografts in vivo, while a similar dose of free IPA-3 was ineffective. These 
data demonstrate the development and clinical utility of a novel liposomal formulationfor the 
treatment of prostate cancer.

 and a zeta potential of −28.1, which was stable for over 14 days with 70 % of IPA-3 remaining 
even after 7 days. A 2 day/week administration of 5 mg/Kg dose of SSL-IPA-3 significantly 
inhibited the growth of prostate xenografts in vivo as compared to similar dose of free IPA-3, 
demonstrating the potential benefits of SSL-IPA-3 for the management of prostate cancer.

Background
P21 activated kinases (PAKs), which exist in 6 different isoforms, are categorized into 
group-I and group-II PAKs based on their distinctly different mechanisms of activation and 
their non-redundant role in the regulation of cellular function1. Group-I PAKs, PAK-1 and 
PAK-2 in particular, have been implicated in various cancers2. Although PAK-1 is the most 
expressed PAK isoform in the majority of tissues, the expression level of PAK-1 is below the 
detectable range in normal prostate tissue and prostatic epithelial cells1. Instead, normal 
prostate abundantly expresses group-IIPAKs such as PAK-4 and PAK-63. A previous study 
from ourlaboratory demonstrated that Rac1-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling is essential for 
prostate cancer invasion4. Since group-I PAKs are the major downstream effectors of Rac1 
in mediating cytoskeletal remodeling5, 6, we further investigated the role of PAK-1 in 
prostate cancer revealing that although not detected in the human prostatic epithelial cells, 
normal prostate gland and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, PAK-1 is abundantly 
expressed in prostate tumor biopsies and metastasized colonies harbored in the human lung 
tissues7. Most recently, we demonstrated that PAK-1 is essential for the growth of prostate 
PC-3 cell tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice as well as transforming growth factor-β 
(TGFβ)-induced prostate cancer cell epithelial-tomesenchymal transition8. Thus; our studies 
suggest that PAK-1 is a potential target for prostate cancer therapy.
Among the known inhibitors of PAKs, the most reliable and specific to group-I PAKs is the 
‘inhibitor targeting PAK-1 activation-3’(IPA-3), a compound identified through high 
throughput screening9. A major advantage of IPA-3 is that, unlike other kinase inhibitors, 
IPA-3 does not interact with and compete for the ATP-binding domain of the kinase10. 
Instead, itis a non-competitive, allosteric inhibitor of PAK-1 thatinhibits PAK-1 
activation,even at higher ATP levels. However, the chemically and metabolically labile 
nature of IPA-3 becomes a major bottleneck in its use for therapeutic purpose10. Although 
IPA-3 inhibits prostate cancer cellular function in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, increased 
frequency (i.e. daily) of drug administration was necessary7, 8. Further, since PAK-1 is 
necessary for many physiological events11-14, serious toxic side effects of targeting PAK-1

 with the free form of IPA-3 cannot be ruled out.This creates a need for a novel method to 
deliver IPA-3 to prostate cancer cells in vivo to improve the stability and efficacy, to 
minimize the frequency of drug administration and to reduce any potential side-effects.
Lipid-based nanoparticulate drug carriers, such aslong-circulating sterically-stabilized 
liposomes (SSL) have the ability to stably encapsulate drugs and facilitate drug 
delivery15-17. They can alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug, especially compared to free 
drug and sometimes enhance theirpharmacological activity15. Differences in the half-life 
and/or tissue and tumor distribution are suggested to be primary drivers for these actions. 
Additionally, SSL are also suggested to decrease off-targeted toxicity18, 19. Doxil®(Centocor 
OrthoBiotech, Horsham, PA) is an example of a clinically approved nanoparticle-
encapsulating the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin that is essentially a SSL. In addition to their 
ability to stabilize drugs and enhance their bio-distribution, SSL accumulate passively in 
solid tumors due to the enhancedpermeability and retention effect mediatedby defects in the 
vasculature and lack of functionallymphatics20,21. In the current study, we attempted to 
encapsulate IPA-3 into sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL-IPA-3), characterize the physical 
properties of these particles, and study the efficacy of these liposomes on prostate cancer cell 
viability in vitro and growth of PC-3 cell tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice.
Methods
Cell Lines and cell culture
The human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, LNCaP and DU-145 and the breast cancer cell 
lines MCF-7 and MDA-231 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). PC-3, LNCaP, and 
DU-145 cells were cultured in F12K, RPMI, and EMEM, respectively. MCF-7 and 
MDA-231cells were cultured in RPMI. All culture media were supplemented with 10% FBS 
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (ATCC). All the cells were maintained at 37°C in 
incubators with 5% CO2 and humidified atmosphere.
Chemicals and Reagents
IPA-3 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, United Kingdom). The phospholipids, 
1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine(DSPC), 1, 2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-
phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE), and 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine–
N-[poly (ethyleneglycol) 2000 (DSPE–PEG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc 
(Alabaster, Alabama). Cholesterol and MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide] were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri). 
F-12K, EMEM and RPMI cell culture media and their supplements, including antibiotics 
and fetal bovine serum (FBS), were purchased from ATCC. All other chemicals and solvents 
were of analytical grade and were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).
Preparation of Sterically Stabilized IPA-3 Liposomes (SSL-IPA-3)
Liposomes were prepared using the thin lipid hydration method followed by freeze–thaw 
cycles and a high-pressure extrusion as described previously22, 23.Liposome composition is 
shown in Table 1. Cholesterol (5 μmol/ml), phospholipids including DSPC (9 μmol/ml) and 
DSPE–PEG (1 μmol/ml) in chloroform and IPA-3 (4 μmol/ml) in ethanol were added into a

 round bottom flask, the solvents were then evaporated under vacuum in a water bath at 65°C 
using a rotary evaporator (BuchiLabortechnik AG, Postlfach, Switzerland). The formed thin 
film was then hydrated and suspended in ammonium phosphate buffer (250 mM, pH 7.4) or 
phosphate saline buffer (PBS) to achieve a final lipid concentration of 10 μmol/ml. The 
formulation then underwent five liquid nitrogen freeze–thaw cycles above the phase 
transition temperature of the primary lipid, prior to passing five times through a Lipex 
extruder (Northern Lipids, Inc, Burnaby, BC Canada) at 65°C using double stacked 
polycarbonate membranes (80 nm, GE Osmonics, Trevose, Pennsylvania). Excess un-
encapsulated IPA-3 and lipids were eliminated using dialysis in 10% (w/v) sucrose for at 
least 20 hours (hrs) with three changings of the dialysis media. The liposome diameter was 
determined using a dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, 
Malvern Instruments, Enigma Business Park, Grovewood Road, Malvern, Worcestershire, 
UK).Liposomal size was further confirmed using Tandem Electron Microscopy (TEM) 
imaging (Supplemental Data Figure 1A). Liposome suspensions were stored at 4°C, 
protected from light, and used within 24 to 48 hrs of preparation. Empty SSL (made without 
IPA-3 encapsulation) were also formulated and used as vehicle controls.
Quantification of IPA-3 in Liposomes
SSL suspensions were collected after an overnight dialysis and IPA-3 was quantified using a 
spectroscopic method based on its absorbance at 360 nm. Serial dilutions of IPA-3 stock 
solution were made in acidic ethanol. Absorbance at 360 nm was recorded using a Spectra 
Max M2 microplate reader (MTX Lab Systems, Inc.Vienna, Virginia 22182 U.S.A.) and 
plotted against the concentration of IPA-3. Astandard curve (R2> 0.99) was used to 
determine the concentration of IPA-3 in SSL (Supplemental Data Figure 1B).
Characterization of Size, Zeta Potential and Physical Stability of Liposomal IPA-3
Long circulating liposomes containing IPA-3 were evaluated for physical stability in the 
storage conditions at 4°C. Drug leakage from liposomes was determined by removing 
portions of liposome suspension from a pool stored at pH 7.4 and 4°C at various times. 
IPA-3 liposomes were submitted to dialysis and reanalyzed for IPA-3 content as described 
above. A significant change in IPA-3 content was used as an indication of liposome stability. 
Changes in mean diameter and zeta potential of liposomes were also used to assess stability 
and was monitored overtime using a dynamic light scattering Malvern Zetasizer. Samples 
were diluted 1 in 10 (v/v) with PBS for the size and zeta potential measurements. As IPA-3 
liposomes were to be used for in vivo studies after reconstitution, we assessed IPA-3 
stability after reconstitution for increasing time periods, including 3 days, the time 
corresponding to in vivo dosing. The analysis showed that over 80% of IPA-3 was 
maintained in SSL after 3 days (Supplemental Figure 2). In fact, good stability appeared to 
be maintained up to at least 7 days in reconstituted liposomes.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Liposomal IPA-3measured using MTT staining
The cytotoxicity of the liposomal IPA-3 as well as the free IPA-3 was determined in three 
prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and DU-145) using the MTT assay24. Free IPA-3 
and SSL-IPA-3 were used for comparison. Cells were seeded in 48-well tissue culture plates 
at 5 × 104 cells/ml and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hr. This time was

 sufficient for the cells to attach and resume their growth. Liposomes were diluted in the 
different culture media to their final concentrations and experiments were performed in 
triplicates. Cells were also treated with free IPA-3 (1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 μM), 
DMSO (vehicle for IPA-3) and empty liposomes (vehicles for encapsulated IPA-3; indicated 
by white bars in the controls of Figure 1D and E) as controls. The cells were incubated for 
24, 48, and 72 hrs. MTT was added at each time point, at a final concentration of 0.25 
mg/ml and plates were incubated at 37°C. Non-reduced MTT and media were aspirated after 
2 hrsand replaced with DMSO to dissolve the MTT formazen crystals. Plates were shaken 
for 15 min and absorbance was read at 590 nm using a Spectra Max M2 plate reader (BMG 
Lab Technologies, Inc., Durham, NC). The concentration of IPA-3 resulting in 50% growth 
inhibition (IC50) was estimated from the concentration-effect curve.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Liposomal IPA-3measured usingannexin V and PI staining
Annexin V and PI staining plus flow cytometry was used to assess NRK cell death as 
previously described with modifications25. Briefly, cells were seeded and allowed to grow 
for 24 h prior to addition of free IPA-3, SSL-IPA-3, or empty liposomes. After the indicated 
time, medium was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in binding 
buffer (10 mMHEPES, 140 mMNaCl, 5 mMKCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) 
containing annexin V-FITC (25 mg/ml) and PI (25 mg/ml) for 10 min. Cells were then 
washed three times with binding buffer, released from monolayers using a rubber policeman, 
and staining quantified using a Dako Cyan ADP 9 color flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, 
Inc., Miami, FL). For each measurement 10,000 events were counted.
Immunoblot Analysis
Proteins from different cell lines were collected in RIPA buffer, which contained protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein concentrations 
were determined using the BCA assay. Protein samples of 40 μg were separated on SDS-
PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked in 5% 
(w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline–Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 2 hrs. The membranes 
were then incubated with a rabbit PAK-1 antibody at a dilution of 1:500 in 1% (w/v) BSA 
TBS-T overnight. Antibodies against GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, 
CA) were used at a dilution of 1:200 in 1% (w/v) BSA in TBST for 1 hr. Membranes were 
then incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, 
Madison, WI) used at a dilution of 1:2500. The membrane was then washed with TBS-T 
three times for 10 minutes each and imaged with a Fluorchem SP digital imager (Alpha 
Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA). Densitometry was performed using National Institutes of 
Health Image J software.
In vivo prostate tumor xenograft

 empty liposomes, free IPA-3 (5 mg/Kg), and SSL-IPA-3 (5 mg/kg) were started on day 7 
from tumor implantation, and were administered two times a week (i.p.). Tumor diameters 
were measured with digital calipers on day 7, 14, 21, and 25, and the tumor volume in mm3 
were calculated by the modified ellipsoidal formula (Tumor volume = ½[length × width2]). 
Average size of the tumors prior to the treatment with free IPA-3 and SSL-IPA-3 were 42 
mm3. Mice were sacrificed on day 25 and tumors were dissected, weighed, and snap-frozen 
for further immunohistochemistry analysis.
TUNEL assay
The TUNEL assay for in situ detection of apoptosis was performed using the ApopTag® 
Fluorescein in situ Apoptosis detection kit (Millipore, MA) as described previously8. Frozen 
sections taken from prostate tumor xenografts were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 
30 min. Fixed tissues were then permeabilized in (ethanol: acetic acid [2:1]) and labeled 
with fluorescein 12-dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Nuclei were 
counterstained with DAPI. Tissue sections were analyzed for apoptotic cells with localized 
green fluorescence using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert100M, Carl 
Zeiss, Germany).
Statistical Analysis
All in vitro experiments were repeated at least three times (n = 3) in triplicate. Results are 
shown as the average of all replicates ± SEM.A two way ANOVA test followed by 
Bonferroniposttest was used to determine whether the differences between free IPA-3 and 
SSLIPA-3treatment groups were statistically significant. A two-tailed student'st test was 
used to compare the differences in PAK-1 expression between different cancer cell lines, and 
for the direct comparison of the tumor xenograft weights. The significance level (alpha) was 
set at 0.05 (marked with symbols wherever data are statistically significant).
Results
Characterization of SSL-IPA-3
SSL-IPA-3 (Table 1) had a hydrodynamic particle diameter of approximately 139 nm, and 
this value did not change significantly over a period of two weeks (Table 2). The 
polydispersity index (PDI), a measure of the distribution of diameters was maintained at 
values less than 0.14 for up to 14 days. These PDI values are within the recommended size 
for medical applications, which is a PDI of less than0.326. Thezeta potential (the overall 
surface charge of the particles) also did not significantly change during this time. The 
stability test showed that 70% of IPA-3 was retained by these liposomes after 7 days post- 
formulation, and 50% was retained after 14 days.The stability tests also showed that a high 
amount of IPA-3 was retained in SSL after reconstitution for dosing, up to 80% after 3 days, 
and greater than 60% after 7 days post reconstitution (Supplemental Figure 2).
Anti-tumor activity of IPA-3and SSL-IPA-3in various human prostate cancer cell lines
The anti-tumor activity of freeIPA-3 was initially determined in vitro to verify that this 
compound inhibited prostate cancer cell growth.Our data showed that freeIPA-3, at 
concentrations of 5-30 μM, induced concentration- and time-dependent decreases in MTT

 staining with an IC50 between 10 and 35 μM,depending on the cell line. Interestingly, 
DU-145 cells were less susceptible to the toxicity of IPA-3 compared to PC-3 and LNCaP 
cells(Figure 1A-C). This difference was not a result of differences in media composition 
(Supplemental Figure 3). Treatment of PC-3 cells with SSL-IPA-3 also decreased MTT 
staining. As expected, SSL-IPA-3 was not as toxic to these cellsas free IPA-3 (Figure 1D-E). 
Nevertheless, decreases in MTT staining were still detected at doses of 20 μM and higher in 
PC-3 cells. In contrast, SSL-IPA-3was unable to induce significant decrease in MTT staining 
in DU-145 cells, even at the maximal encapsulation efficiency of 30 μM IPA-3. These data 
show that SSL-IPA-3 display anti-cancer activity in vitro.
Annexin V and PI staining were assessed using flow cytometry to further study IPA-3 and 
SSL-IPA-3 induced death in PC-3 cells (Figure 2). Treatment of cells with empty liposomes 
did not appreciably increase the percent cells staining positive either for annexin V alone or 
annexin and PI after 48 hr. In contrast, treatment with free IPA-3 (20-30 μM) significantly 
increased the percent of cell staining positive for annexin V alone, as well as those staining 
positive for both annexin V and PI, suggesting the IPA-3 is inducing cell death via apoptosis. 
The increase in annexin V and PI staining were also time-dependent (data not shown). SSL-
IPA-3 also increased the percent cells staining positive for annexin V alone, but appeared to 
have a greater effect on cells staining positive for both annexin V and PI. Further, SSL-IPA-3 
also increased the number of cells staining positive for PI alone, suggesting that the presence 
of necrosis. The increase in cell staining positive for late apoptosis markers, as well as 
necrosis, suggest that the encapsulation of IPA-3 in liposomes enhanced cell death and may 
be more efficacious at killing tumor cell in vivo.
To test whether the differential sensitivity of IPA-3 on DU-145 and PC-3 cells were due to 
the differences in the activity of PAK-1,PAK-1 protein expression was determined in PC-3, 
DU-145 and LNCaP cells, and compared to two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-231 and 
MCF-7). Our results indicated that PAK-1 expression was variable in all cell lines 
tested,with higher levels being detected in DU-145 cells and the lowest level being detected 
in MDA-231 cells (Figure 3A-B). Comparison of the protein expression level of PAK-1 to 
the IC50 of free IPA-3 showed an excellent correlation with an R2 of 0.92 (Figure 3C-D). As 
expected, cells with the highest levels of PAK-1 expression (DU-145 and MCF-7) had the 
highest IC50s (~32 and 25 μM, respectively), while cells with the lowest PAK-1 expression 
(MDA-231 and LNCaP cells) had the lowest IC50s (8 and 10 μM) respectively. These data 
suggest that differences in the sensitivity of cells to SSL-IPA-3aremediated not by 
differences in sensitivity to the nanoparticles, but more so by differences in the expression of 
PAK-1.
SSL-IPA-3 inhibits the prostate tumor xenograft growth in vivo
We previously reported that inhibition of PAK-1using IPA-3reduced prostate tumor 
xenograft growth in athymic nude mice with daily administration8. In the current study, we 
sought to determine if 2 days/week administration of SSL-IPA-3 can inhibit the PC-3 cell 
tumor xenograft growth in vivo, compared to the same frequency of free IPA-3. Our results 
indicated that 2 days/week administration of SSL-IPA-3was indeed sufficient to inhibit the 
growth ofPC-3 cell tumor xenografts, as comparedtoempty liposomeand free IPA-3

 administered groups (Fig 4A-C). In fact, similar doses of free IPA-3 (2 days/week) 
administration did not have a significant effect on PC-3 tumor xenograft growth. There was 
no significant effect of empty liposome, free IPA-3 or SSL-IPA-3administration on the body 
weight of mice even after 25 days (Fig 4D). These data shows the novel finding that SSL-
IPA-3 is effective at inhibiting the growth of prostate tumor xenograftsin vivo.
SSL-IPA-3 treatment induces apoptosis in vivo more effectively than free IPA-3
We next determined the effect of SSL-IPA-3 and free IPA-3 on apoptosis in the PC-3 cell 
prostate tumor xenografts in vivo using TUNEL staining Our analysisindicated that both 
SSL-IPA-3 andfree IPA-3 treatments resulted in significant increases in the number of 
apoptotic cells per field compared to the control groups, but, the effect on the apoptosis was 
more greater in the SSL-IPA-3-treated group, as compared to the free IPA-3-treated 
group(Fig 5A-B). Thus, SSL-IPA-3'sehanced ability to limit prostate tumor growth in vivo 
correlates to increased apoptosis.
Discussion
Serine–threonine kinases PAKs,PAK-1 in particular, have been associated with a variety of 
pathological conditions, including cancer1. PAK-1 is regulated by auto-inhibition, and is 
suggested as good therapeutic target for cancer therapyby using small molecules that may 
cause conformational changes in the protein disturbing its autoregulation1, 27. Previous 
studies from our laboratory showed that Rac1, an upstream regulator of PAK-1 promotes 
prostate cancer cell survival, proliferation and transendothelial-migration4. Although absent 
in the normal prostate and human benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, our studies revealed 
that PAK-1 is expressed in prostate cancer cells, prostate tumors and metastatic colonies in 
the patient lungs7, and thatPAK-1 is important in the TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells8. These studies suggested that targeting PAK-1 
may be an effective strategy for prostate cancer therapy.
In a screening process for allosteric inhibitors targeting PAK-1 activation, IPA-3 has been 
identified as a small molecule inhibitor of PAK-1, and was then proposed as a potential 
therapeutic candidate for various human pathologies including cancer9. However, IPA-3in its 
free form has a very short half-lifein vivo because of its rapid metabolism10. Thus, the 
metabolically labile nature of IPA-3 becomes a major bottleneck in its use for therapeutic 
purposes. Although the free form of IPA-3 was effective in inhibiting prostate cancer growth 
in our studies, this required daily administration of the drug8. This demanded a reliable 
method to specifically deliver IPA-3 to prostate cancer cells in vivothat will improve the 
stability and efficacy of IPA-3, reduce the frequency of drug administration and avoid any 
potential side-effects of free IPA-3.
Like in the case of IPA-3, most of the laboratory based research on prostate cancer does not 
reach the clinic due to various issues relating to the dose, frequency of drug administration, 
stability of particular drug in vivo and the adverse reactions. The major limitation of many 
anti-cancer drugs is caused by rapid metabolism and/or toxic side effects. An ideal drug 
dosage formulation for anti-cancer therapy has to exhibit specific delivery of an effective 
dose of drug to the target tissue over the required period of time. Tumor specific drug

 delivery using lipid-based nanoparticulate drug carriers, such as SSL, have been used to 
encapsulate and release drugs, often with higher efficiency compared to free drug28. This 
suggested that encapsulation of IPA-3 in SSL may confer stability to IPA-3, lead to its 
specific delivery to cancer tissues, and hence may be ideal to improve its efficacy in 
inhibiting prostate cancer growth.
IPA-3 was effectively and stably encapsulated in SSL. Analysis of zeta potential and size 
indicated that these nanoparticles would be functional for clinical application, and the 
activity of these formulations were verified in vitro. It is not surprising that SSL-IPA-3 were 
not as effective as free IPA-3 in vitro and in vivo, as this is commonly seen in many studies, 
including those reported from our own laboratory16, 22, 29. What was surprising was that the 
effect of SSL-IPA-3 was shown to be cell type-dependent and mediated by the level of 
expression of PAK-1. The decreased susceptibility of DU-145 cells to SSL-IPA-3 liposomes 
indeed mirrored their decreased susceptibility to free IPA-3. These differences were not a 
result of difference in sensitivity to the formulation used as DU-145 and PC-3 cells were 
equally sensitive to another anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin, encapsulated in SSL and a 
modified liposome formulation22, 23. Our in vitrostudies also revealed that free IPA-3 
displays greater antitumor activity than SSL-IPA-3. Such an observation is expected as 
encapsulated IPA-3 in SSL must first be released from the liposomes before acting on its 
target PAK-1. These data also suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of SSL-IPA-3 may be 
limited in cancers that express high levels of PAK-1. It is also possible that the differential 
expression of PAKs in these cancers may also mitigate the toxicity.
Biophysical characterization of SSL-IPA-3 showed excellent stability, as based on the 
maintenance of zeta potential, size and IPA-3 levels for at least 7 days. Because of its 
lipophilicity, IPA-3 is probably mostly incorporated in the phospholipid bilayer of the 
liposomes, which provides a hydrophobic environment. Once trapped, IPA-3may remain in 
the liposomal bilayer due to their lower affinity for the inner and outer aqueous regions of 
the liposomes3031. However, given enough time, IPA-3 may dissociate from the SSL. This 
may be the cause for the decrease in IPA-3 levels seen in these formulations after 14 days. 
Nevertheless, our data show that SSL-IPA-3is reasonably stable and therapeutically active, 
even in biological fluids. Future efforts will be placed on increasing stability for longer time 
periods.Lyophilization is a promising approach to ensure the extension of shelf-life and 
longer-term stability of liposomes. Thus, methods such as water replacement and 
vitrification could also be usedto produce an extended shelf-life32.
The data presented in our study demonstrate the novel finding that 2 days/week 
administration of SSL-IPA-3is effective in decreasing the growth of human prostate cells in 
vitro and tumor (PC-3) xenografts in vivo. Further, and more exciting, was that the data 
showed enhanced efficacy of SSL-IPA-3 compared to free IPA-3, which suggests that the 
activity of SSL-IPA-3 becomes more effective in an in vivo environment. The increase in 
efficacy of the SSL-IPA-3, as compared to free IPA-3 is most likely a result of the 
phenomenon discussed in introduction, including the possibility that the encapsulation of 
IPA-3 in SSL extends the half-life of IPA-3 and overcomes its rapid metabolism in its free 
form. The implications of these findings are significant because they suggest decreased 
dosing, with higher efficacy, which could decrease side-effects and other off-target toxicities

 associated with anti-cancer agents. Although the experiments in this studyare focused on the 
activity of SSL-IPA-3on prostate cancer, this targeting strategy may additionally be used to 
target other cancers such as breast cancer as was shown by our in vitro studies.
In conclusion, we have demonstratedthe formulation and characterization of novel SSL-
based nanoparticle formulation that is reasonably stable and shows excellent efficacy both in 
vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that SSL-IPA-3 isan effective targeting strategy for 
inhibiting prostate cancer growth. Data in this study also suggest that the activity of IPA-3 is 
cell dependent and is mediated by the level of expression of PAK-1 in cancer cells.
