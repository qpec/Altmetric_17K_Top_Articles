Abstract
Background: Multiple corticosteroids and treatment regimens have been used as adjuncts in the treatment of
septic shock. Qualitative and quantitative differences exist at cellular and tissular levels between the different drugs
and their patterns of delivery. The objective of this study was to elucidate any differences between the drugs and
their treatment regimens regarding outcomes for corticosteroid use in adult patients with septic shock.
Methods: Network meta-analysis of the data used for the recently conducted Cochrane review was performed.
Studies that included children and were designed to assess respiratory function in pneumonia and acute respiratory
distress syndrome, as well as cross-over studies, were excluded. Network plots were created for each outcome, and
all analyses were conducted using a frequentist approach assuming a random-effects model.
Results: Complete data from 22 studies and partial data from 1 study were included. Network meta-analysis
provided no clear evidence that any intervention or treatment regimen is better than any other across the
spectrum of outcomes. There was strong evidence of differential efficacy in only one area: shock reversal.
Hydrocortisone boluses and infusions were more likely than methylprednisolone boluses and placebo to result in
shock reversal.
Conclusions: There was no clear evidence that any one corticosteroid drug or treatment regimen is more likely to
be effective in reducing mortality or reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or superinfection in septic
shock. Hydrocortisone delivered as a bolus or as an infusion was more likely than placebo and methylprednisolone
to result in shock reversal.

Background
The place of therapeutic corticosteroids in critically ill
patients with sepsis is controversial. Two main questions
still exist in this population. First, is there a group of
critically ill patients who are relatively deficient in corti-
costeroids, and if so, how they should they be treated
[1]? Second, do steroids given to all critically ill patients
improve outcomes [2]? These questions have been inves-
tigated primarily in those patients with septic shock, and
sufficient studies have been conducted to allow multiple
meta-analyses
[2–4],
including
a
recently
updated
Cochrane review [2]. However, not all therapeutic cortico-
steroids are the same. Even at dose equivalency, some cor-
ticosteroids have more immunosuppressive properties
(e.g., dexamethasone), and some have more mineralocor-
ticoid and vasoreactive properties (e.g., hydrocortisone)
[5]. This, tied with the evidence that endogenous gluco-
corticoids are secreted in a pulsatile manner in health [6],
major surgery [7] and critical illness [8] warranted further
analysis of the effects of the individual drugs and the dose
regimens used. We performed a network meta-analysis
(NMA) on the data used for the Cochrane review to estab-
lish the likely effectiveness of each drug and therapeutic
regimen in adults with septic shock.

 Methods
Inclusion criteria for the Cochrane review [2] were as
follows:
� Randomised controlled trials with and without
blinding
� Children and adults with sepsis defined by the
following:
– Documented infection, defined as culture or
Gram stain of blood, sputum, urine or normally
sterile body fluid that is positive for a pathogenic
micro-organism, or a focus of infection identified
by visual inspection (e.g., ruptured bowel with
the presence of free air or bowel contents in the
abdomen found at the time of surgery, wound
with purulent drainage); and
– At least two symptoms of a systemic
inflammatory response syndrome, such as fever
(body temperature >38 °C) or hypothermia
(<36 °C), tachycardia (>90 beats per minute),
tachypnoea (>20 breaths per minute) or
hyperventilation (arterial carbon dioxide tension
<32 mmHg) and abnormal white blood cell count
(>12,000 cells/ml or <4000 cells/ml) or >10%
immature band of neutrophils; and
– At least one sign of organ dysfunction, that is,
metabolic acidosis, arterial hypoxaemia (arterial
oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen
<250 mmHg), oliguria (<30 ml/h for ≥3 h),
coagulopathy or encephalopathy; and
– Septic shock defined by a combination of these
criteria and the presence of hypotension
(persisting systolic arterial pressure <90 mmHg)
that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and
requires vasopressor support, that is, >5 μg/kg of
body weight per minute of dopamine or any dose
of epinephrine or norepinephrine.
� Interventions were regarded as systemic treatment
with any type of corticosteroid preparation, whereas
controls were standard therapy or placebo.
Data from trials of acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) were included when separate data were available
for participants with sepsis or when contact with study
authors resulted in provision of the data.
Studies that were included for analysis in the Cochrane
review were initially included in this analysis. However, we
excluded all data from children (<18 years), as well as
those studies that were designed to investigate the effect
of corticosteroids on respiratory function in ARDS and
pneumonia (primary outcome measures were purely re-
spiratory function). Cross-over studies where both groups
received steroids and no information was published on
outcomes at the cross-over were also excluded. The
RevMan 5 file for the published meta-analysis was pro-
vided by the lead author of the Cochrane review [2]. Full
details of the methods of data search, abstraction, hand-
ling and assessment are available from http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002243.pub3/full.
Outcome measures
Interventions were grouped as follows:
� Hydrocortisone infusion
� Hydrocortisone bolus
� Dexamethasone bolus
� Methylprednisolone bolus
� Methylprednisolone infusion
� Prednisolone
Infusions were defined as treatment regimens where
there was continuous delivery of a drug without inter-
ruption until the end of the treatment period. The bolus
group was defined as those receiving treatment regimens
with planned temporal interruptions to corticosteroid
drug delivery.
Outcomes were grouped as follows:
� Up to 28-day mortality
� Hospital mortality
� Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LoS)
� ICU mortality
� Shock reversal
� Incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding
� Incidence of superinfections
Hyperglycaemia was a commonly reported negative
outcome of the use of glucocorticoids. However, the def-
inition of hyperglycaemia between studies varied so
widely that it was not possible to group the results.
Data management
One author (TM) drew up a data extraction table from
the RevMan file that was amended by the other authors.
Two authors (BG, TM) extracted data and cross-
checked this for accuracy against the original publica-
tions. Errors were corrected where necessary. Where the
treatment regimen was not published, one author (BG)
attempted to contact the authors. If the authors were
unable to be contacted, the study was excluded.
Assessment for risk of bias
Assessment for risk of bias was carried out by the
authors of the Cochrane review in accordance with
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions [9]. Full details are available within the
original analysis [2].

 Statistical analysis
Network plots were created for each outcome to illus-
trate which interventions had been directly compared
within trials. The thickness of the nodes and edges in
each network is proportional to the number of patients
allocated to each intervention and contributing to each
pairwise comparison, respectively. An NMA was under-
taken to combine results of all comparisons among in-
terventions in a single analysis. This approach makes use
of both the direct comparisons available within trials
and the indirect comparisons of interventions that can
be made across trials when they use a common com-
parator intervention [10]. All analyses were conducted
using a frequentist approach assuming a random-effects
model, with an equal heterogeneity variance assumed for
all comparisons, using the network suite of Stata com-
mands, programmed by Ian White [11]. We intended to
rank the interventions according to their probability to
be best, second best, third best and so forth for the dif-
ferent outcomes. If there had been both direct evidence
and indirect evidence for any particular pairwise com-
parison, we would have examined their agreement using
methods to examine inconsistency in NMA; in practice,
we did not encounter any instances of this.
Results
Study characteristics
Thirty-three studies were included by the authors of the
Cochrane review (see Additional file 1: Tables S1 and
S2). Eleven studies were excluded from our analyses.
Five were excluded because the study was designed to
look at respiratory function in pneumonia only, not sep-
sis [12–16]. Two studies were excluded because they
used children as their study population [17, 18]. We ex-
cluded data from children in one study, but included the
data from adults [19]. Two studies were excluded be-
cause both intervention groups received steroids (as a
cross-over study [20] or for different durations [21]).
One study was excluded because no information regard-
ing the treatment regimens used in the study was avail-
able
[22].

inclusion
and
exclusion is presented in Fig. 1.
NMA results
Most CIs are very wide and often include the null value,
both at the study level (see Additional file 2: Figures S1–S7)
and at the NMA level. For that reason, rankings of
treatments may be misleading for this review and
hence are not included. Conclusions for each out-
come are described below.
Mortality up to 28 days
There is evidence that boluses of methylprednisolone
increase the risk of mortality compared with boluses
of dexamethasone (OR 5.71, 95% CI 0.99–32.9), and
there is weak evidence that boluses of dexamethasone
reduce the risk of mortality at 28 days compared with
placebo (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.05–1.34) (see Fig. 2 and
in Additional file 2: Figure S1). The results showed
the same trends (with some loss of precision) after
excluding 14-day mortality.
Hospital mortality
There is weak evidence that boluses of dexamethasone may
reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality compared with pla-
cebo (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15–1.46) (see Additional file 2:
Figures S2 and S8). The results suggest that infusions of
hydrocortisone might increase the risk compared with
boluses of dexamethasone (OR 3.06, 95% CI 0.72–12.9)
and compared with boluses of hydrocortisone (OR 2.00,
95% CI 0.72–5.59).
Incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding
The results for incidence of GI bleeding do not enable
clear conclusions to be drawn (see Additional file 2: Figures
S6 and S9).
Incidence of superinfections
There is weak evidence that boluses of dexamethasone
may increase the risk of superinfections compared with
placebo (OR 2.78, 95% CI 0.73–10.6) (see Additional file
2: Figures S7 and S10). There is some evidence that both
boluses (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.09–1.19) and continuous infu-
sions of methylprednisolone (0.23, 95% CI 0.05–1.08) may
reduce this risk compared with boluses of dexamethasone.
Shock reversal
There is strong evidence that boluses of methylpred-
nisolone are less likely to result in shock reversal than
hydrocortisone boluses (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19–0.72) and
infusions (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07–0.81) (see Fig. 3 and
Additional file 2: Figure S5). There is also evidence
that hydrocortisone increases the likelihood of shock
reversal compared with placebo when given as a bolus
(OR 2.34, 95% CI 0.99–5.50) or as an infusion (OR
3.68, 95% CI 1.52–8.93).
ICU mortality
Only a small subset of the database provided informa-
tion for ICU mortality, so NMA for this outcome was
not performed. However, one of the studies provides
evidence that an infusion of methylprednisolone re-
duces the risk of this outcome compared with placebo
(OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–0.99) (see Additional file 2:
Figure S3).

 Hospital LoS
Only a small subset of the studies in the database pro-
vided information for hospital LoS; thus, NMA for this
outcome was not performed. The results do not enable
clear conclusions to be drawn.
ICU LoS
Only a small subset of the database provided informa-
tion for ICU LoS; thus, NMA was not performed for this
outcome. However, results from two studies suggest that
hydrocortisone infusion may reduce the ICU LoS com-
pared with placebo. One of the studies provided strong
evidence supporting this hypothesis (mean difference of
7 days, 95% CI 2.35 to 11.7 days), whereas the other
study yielded a less precise result (mean difference of
9 days, 95% CI −3.64 to 21.6 days).
Discussion
This NMA has provided no clear evidence that any one
intervention or treatment regimen is better than any
other across the spectrum of outcomes. The use of glu-
cocorticoids in the critically ill is commonplace, but its
targets and true indications are hazy. There have been
three indications for the use of glucocorticoids in sepsis
over the last century. First, they were given as immuno-
suppressants; large doses of glucocorticoids that have
significant immune effects such as dexamethasone and
methylprednisolone were given until studies in the late
1980s [23–27] showed a trend towards increased rates of

 superinfection and these high dose studies were halted.
Second, there have been attempts to identify and treat a
group of patients who are thought to be relatively
deficient in glucocorticoids during their critical illness
(critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency [1]),
although sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for this
remain to be found [28–31]. Last, and more recently,
there has been a movement towards giving all patients
who are unresponsive to, or on high-dose vasopressors, so
called low-dose hydrocortisone (<400 mg/day) [32–34], in
effect using it as a non-catecholamine vasoconstrictor. It
is this approach that is currently recommended in the
Surviving Sepsis guidelines [35]. This variation of study
design intention has led to significant heterogeneity be-
tween the studies in this area. To try and reduce this, we
excluded studies specifically designed with respiratory
function as the outcome [12–16]. The hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis of children is different from that of
adults and develops across childhood and puberty [36].
Including the outcomes of children would further increase
heterogeneity if assimilated with adult studies, and there-
fore data from children were also excluded for this ana-
lysis. In health [6], major surgery [7] and critical illness
[8], adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol
are secreted in a pulsatile manner generated by the
positive feedforward and negative feedback of these two
hormones. This pulsatility is critical for patients with ab-
solute cortisol deficiency [37, 38] to maintain normal
glucocorticoid
receptor
(GR)
signalling
and
optimal
physiological function. The pulsatile secretion pattern also
translates into the pattern of receptor binding [39], with
continuous and intermittent binding yielding both quanti-
tative and qualitative differences in gene transcription
[40]. In health, much of the effect of glucocorticoids is
mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor, whereas at
higher (stress) levels, the effects are mediated mainly
through the GR. This, coupled with the knowledge that
cortisol binding globulin is saturable [41] at plasma corti-
sol levels of around 400 nmol/L, means that GR may be
continually activated during critical illness rather than the
intermittent activation of health. Intermittent delivery of
hydrocortisone under these conditions may not yield the
benefits seen under non-stressed conditions. There is
some early animal evidence that there are no pattern
dependent effects (continuous versus pulsatile) seen at
glucocorticoid-responsive genes when high-dose plasma
corticosteroids are used [42]. More studies are required to
clarify the differential effects of these different glucocortic-
oid patterns.
The drive behind this NMA was to gain information
that may aid in the design of improved treatment regi-
mens. This analysis shows that hydrocortisone is likely
to lead to shock reversal, but that this does not yet
translate into improved mortality outcomes. Design of
studies in this area should now be focused on elucidat-
ing the optimal dose and regimen for glucocorticoid
treatment using hydrocortisone, yielding the benefits of
improved cardiovascular reactivity and capillary perme-
ability, with the lowest risk of hyperglycaemia, super-
infection and GI bleeding.
Comparison with other studies

within the critical care environment [2–4], but, to our
knowledge, this is the first using an NMA approach and

 therapeutic agent and regimen. Although all corticoste-
roids possess the immune, metabolic and fluid homeostatic
features of their group, marked differences in the activity
of each drug in these features exists. Authors of the previ-
ous meta-analyses have always used pairwise techniques to
compare steroids versus placebo. In two cases, this was
using a frequentist approach [2, 4]. In the third case, the
different effects of high-dose (>1000 mg/day) versus low-
dose (<1000 mg/day) hydrocortisone equivalents in syn-
thetic
ACTH
responders
and
non-responders
were
analysed using a Bayesian approach [3]. The results of all
three were also inconclusive in terms of mortality, as
our analysis is. The Bayesian meta-analysis, like our
analysis, did show a high probability of treatment effi-
cacy of low-dose hydrocortisone treatment in terms
of shock reversal. This again was not at the expense
of higher complications, and this pattern persists re-
gardless of the method of analysis [2–4].
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study are that it takes the robust,
structured approach of a Cochrane review and applies a
different statistical approach to the data. NMA allows
multiple pairwise comparisons and therefore may allow
a more granular approach to answering the clinical
question than a generic ‘steroids versus placebo’ ques-
tion. In principle, for a network analysis to hold true, the
interventions should be ‘jointly randomisable’. That is, a
participant in any trial meeting the inclusion criteria
could have been randomised to any of the interventions
[43]. This is true for this analysis and the underlying
principle regarding why patients included in the trials
designed to look at respiratory function and children
were excluded. The study included data from over 3000
patients, and therefore it may appear that its ability to
discriminate small differences in outcome should be rea-
sonable. However, this ability is significantly reduced by
dividing the patients into multiple treatment groups,
whereby the number of patients in each group is fewer.
The limitations of the study include that there were
few direct comparisons of treatment regimens (all but
two studies were intervention versus placebo). This
means that the strength of inference made in an NMA
between different interventions is not as robust as it
could be and that consistency between direct and indir-
ect evidence could not be assessed. This study used data
from the last 50 years. Improvements in intensive care
over the last half-century are myriad, and the breadth of
patients, in terms of both age and co-morbidities now
treated within a critical care environment, has increased.
This means that bias will have inevitably crept in. Whilst
the inclusion criteria for studies may not have changed,
the population from which they are drawn will. Many
patients not considered appropriate for critical care in
the 1970s and 1980s are the mainstay of work for many
critical care units in developed countries [44]. As men-
tioned previously, the glucocorticoids used in trials have
changed with time from high-dose immunosuppressive
agents towards lower-dose hydrocortisone. Thus, al-
though at an individual level the included patients are
‘jointly randomisable’
, between the groups there are likely
to be significant differences. We also did not compare
the effect of the dose of corticosteroids. The network is
already rather sparse, and therefore our ability to differen-
tiate between different doses and different agents is very
low. Other limitations included that many of the studies
reported different outcome measures for the same head-
line outcome. This made performing NMA on these out-
comes impossible in many circumstances. This was most
striking for ‘hyperglycaemia’
, where the definition varied
between ‘total insulin dose’ [32] blood glucose >150 mg/dl
on any day [45], an increase of >200 mg/dl [46] and
others, hence its exclusion as an outcome. Standardisation
of outcome definitions for critical care trials would im-
prove this problem going forward.
Conclusions
This NMA has provided no clear evidence that any one
treatment regimen of glucocorticoids is more likely to be
effective than any other in the treatment of septic shock.
This was seen across the outcome measures. There is
good evidence that both hydrocortisone boluses and in-
fusions increased the likelihood of shock reversal com-
pared with placebo and boluses of methylprednisolone.
Current guidelines for the management of sepsis [35] re-
flect this. Physiological patterns of hydrocortisone in
both blood and at the level of GRs in the tissues are pul-
satile, and at physiological levels, these patterns change
both the quantity and the type of genomic outputs. Go-
ing forward, studies of steroids in sepsis should be fo-
cused on the most appropriate dose of hydrocortisone
delivered in the correct pattern. Definitions of outcome
within the critical care literature vary widely, and the
case should be made for standardisation.
