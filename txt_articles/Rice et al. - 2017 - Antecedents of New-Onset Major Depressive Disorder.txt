IMPORTANCE Early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) is common in individuals at high
familial risk of depression and is associated with poor long-term mental health, social, and
educational outcomes.
OBJECTIVES To examine the developmental pathways that lead to first-episode
adolescent-onset MDD (incident cases) in those at high familial risk and to postulate a
theoretically informed model that enables simultaneous testing of different pathways to
incident adolescent-onset MDD composed of contributions from familial/genetic and social
risk factors, as well as effects via specific clinical antecedents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a 4-year longitudinal study (April
2007 to March 2011) among offspring of depressed parents in the general community.
Analyses were conducted between September 1, 2015, and May 27, 2016. Participants were
337 families in whom the index parent (315 mothers and 22 fathers) had experienced at least
2 episodes of MDD (recruited through primary care) and among whom there was a
biologically related child in the age range of 9 to 17 years living with the index parent (197 girls
and 140 boys with a mean [SD] age of 12.4 [2.0] years) at baseline. Offspring with MDD
before the study or at baseline (n = 27), offspring with an episode of MDD that had remitted
by follow-up (n = 4), and offspring with missing baseline MDD data (n = 2) were excluded.
Ninety-two percent (279 of 304) of families completed the follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was new-onset offspring MDD, and
the secondary outcome was the total DSM-IV MDD symptom score.
RESULTS On average, children and adolescents had a mean (SD) of 1.85 (1.74) (range, 0-8.5)
DSM-IV symptoms of MDD at follow-up. Twenty (6 males and 14 females) had new-onset
MDD, with a mean (SD) age at onset of 14.4 (2.0) years (range, 10-18 years). Irritability
(β = 0.12, P = .03) and fear and/or anxiety (β = 0.38, P < .001) were significant independent
clinical antecedents of new adolescent-onset MDD, but disruptive behavior (β = −0.08,
P = .14) and low mood (β = −0.03, P = .65) were not. The results were similar for the DSM-IV
symptom count at follow-up. All the measured familial/genetic and social risk indicators
directly influenced risk for new-onset MDD rather than indirectly through acting on
dimensional clinical antecedents.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There are multiple pathways to first-onset adolescent
depression in individuals at familial risk. Irritability and fear/anxiety may be additional clinical
phenomena to be included as targets in primary preventive interventions focusing on the
child. In addition to targeting these phenomena in parents and children, depression
prevention methods in high-risk groups may need to take into consideration social risks, such
as poverty and psychosocial adversity.

M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading global
cause of lifelong disability. The incidence markedly
risesduringmid-adolescence,1-3andfirstonsetatthis
age predicts a long-term trajectory of symptoms into adult
life,4-6 with especially poor long-term mental health, social,
and educational outcomes.2,4-7 Even when the onset of de-
pression is in adult life, many of its contributing risk factors
begin during childhood,8,9 highlighting the importance of un-
derstanding the etiology of early-onset MDD.10 The most com-
mon major risk factor for early-onset MDD is depression in a
parent.6,11-13 Therefore, the adolescent offspring of depressed
parents are an important group for investigating the initial de-
velopment of early-onset MDD.
Majordepressivedisorderhasacomplexmultifactorialeti-
ology that includes inherited or familial influences13-18 and so-
cialriskfactors.8,9,19,20Howdosuchriskscollectivelyaffectthe
child and eventually translate into first-onset MDD? The child-
hood symptom dimensions of fear and/or anxiety, depression
(lowmood),andconductandoppositionalproblemshavebeen
found to precede later mood disorder.21-26 Irritability may be a
distinct dimension of oppositional behavior that indepen-
dently predicts depressive symptoms.27-29 Therefore, familial/
genetic and social risk factors may increase the probability of
incident MDD through earlier effects on these symptom di-
mensions that appear to be antecedents to disorder.
Despite a consensus that depression has multifactorial
causes and likely involves multiple risk pathways that begin
in childhood, studies to date have documented elevated life-
time rates of depressive disorder in those at familial risk but
have not tested which developmental processes are involved
in the initial onset of MDD in these individuals. These data
would be informative for refining primary prevention meth-
ods. Depression prevention efforts focus on modifying low
mood, with promising results when prevention targets those
at elevated risk for MDD, including offspring of depressed
parents.30-32However,therearedifferentdevelopmentalroutes
to first-onset MDD. If these channels can be identified, target-
ing relevant risk factors and clinical antecedents could be use-
ful adjuncts to existing prevention programs.33
A focus on identifying processes involved in the first on-
set of adolescent depression is warranted given the high rates
of recurrence when depression arises at this time.4 To our
knowledge, this article is the first to examine the antecedents
of the initial onset of MDD during adolescence in a high-risk
sample using an approach that models risk factors simultane-
ously and accounts for the co-occurrence of such risks. We set
out to test whether multiple indicators of familial risk and so-
cial adversity simultaneously affect first-onset MDD via irri-
tability, disruptive behavior, fear/anxiety, and low mood in a
longitudinal study of high-risk child and adolescent offspring
of parents with a history of recurrent MDD.
Methods
Participants
Data were from a prospective longitudinal study of the off-
spring of parents with recurrent depression. At baseline, there
were 337 families (315 mothers and 22 fathers) recruited pri-
marily from United Kingdom general practices.34 The pres-
ence of least 2 episodes of DSM-IV MDD in the index parent
was confirmed at baseline with a timeline of the parent’
s pre-
vious depressive episodes,35,36 and the Schedules for Clinical
AssessmentinNeuropsychiatry37assessedcurrentparentalde-
pression.Onechildperfamilywasincluded.Theyoungestchild
between 9 and 17 years old was selected to reduce the likeli-
hood that children had already experienced MDD, totaling 197
girls and 140 boys (mean [SD] age, 12.4 [2.0] years at base-
line). All children were biologically related to and living with
the affected parent. Additional exclusion criteria were mod-
erate to severe intellectual disability (IQ, <50) in the child and
the presence of DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder, mania or
hypomania, or psychotic disorder in the parent at interview.
Two families were excluded because the index parent was sub-
sequently diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. Parents and
offspring were assessed on 3 occasions. The mean (SD) time
between the baseline (T1) and second (T2) assessment was 16.2
(2.6) months and between the second and third (T3) assess-
ment was 12.5 (1.6) months. Data were collected via semistruc-
tured diagnostic interviews and questionnaires.34 Written in-
formed consent or assent was obtained from parents and
childrenasappropriate.TheMulti-CenterResearchEthicsCom-
mittee for Wales (of the National Health Service Health Re-
search Authority) approved the study.
Outcome Variables at Follow-up
Primary Outcome of New-Onset Offspring MDD
Child psychopathologic conditions were assessed with the
Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA),38 which
is a semistructured diagnostic interview that derives psychi-
atric symptoms and diagnoses during the preceding 3
months.38,39 The parent and child assessments were com-
pleted independently by trained, supervised interviewers. A
modified section of the CAPA was used to collect information
on MDD symptoms occurring before the study and between
assessments. Major depressive disorder was defined as the
presence of at least 5 depressive symptoms, including one of
Key Points
Question In individuals at high familial risk, what are the
developmental pathways that lead to the first onset of major
depressive disorder in adolescence?
Findings This investigation was a 4-year longitudinal study among
offspring of depressed parents in the general community. In a
theoretically informed model that simultaneously tested different
pathways, irritability and fear and/or anxiety were the clinical
antecedents of new-onset major depressive disorder, and social
and familial risk factors directly affected new-onset major
depressive disorder.
Meaning Depression prevention methods in high-risk groups
likely need to target clinical phenomena in parents and children
and take into consideration social risks, such as poverty and
psychosocial adversity.

new-onset offspring MDD, defined as MDD at T2 or T3 assess-
ment. To increase confidence that we were identifying first-
onset MDD cases, we excluded offspring with a diagnosis of
MDD before T1 or at T1 (n = 27), offspring with an episode of
MDDthathadremittedbetweenfollow-upassessments(n = 4),
andoffspringwithmissingMDDdiagnosticinformationatbase-
line (n = 2). These exclusions resulted in a maximum sample
of 304 families. Diagnostic data at follow-up were available for
279 of 304 individuals (91.8%).
Secondary Outcome of the Total DSM-IV MDD Symptom Score
A total DSM-IV MDD symptom score defined by the CAPA at
follow-up was calculated. This number represented the mean
of the total symptoms aggregated across T2 and T3.
Antecedent Variables Assessed at Baseline (T1)
Dimensional Clinical Antecedents
Low Mood | The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire is a widely
accepted depression screening instrument and was used to
generate a full range of low mood scores.40 It includes 34 items
aboutachild’
smoodsymptomsduringthepast3months,rated
from 0 (not true) to 2 (true).40 Scores across informants were
combined by using the highest rating per item from the par-
ent or the child. Internal reliability was excellent (α = .95). We
did not use the CAPA depression score as a predictor to avoid
thepossibilityofcriterioncontaminationwhenpredictingnew-
onset MDD at follow-up diagnosed using the CAPA and be-
cause the threshold for endorsing an MDD symptom is high.38
Fear/Anxiety | The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional
Disorders is a 41-item questionnaire41,42 that assesses chil-
dren’
s symptoms of anxiety (generalized, panic, somatic,
school, separation, and social anxiety), rated from 0 (not true
or hardly ever true) to 2 (very true or often true).42,43 Internal
reliability was excellent (α = .93). Parent and child data were
combined as above for low mood.
IrritabilityandDisruptiveBehavior|Symptomsofoppositionalde-
fiantdisorderwereassessedwiththeCAPA.Anirritabilityscore
was calculated by combining the following items (0 for absent
and 1 for present): touchy or easily annoyed, angry or resent-
ful,andtempertantrums.44,45Otheritems(disobedientorbreak
rules, annoys others, blames others, and spiteful or vindic-
tive) were used to create a disruptive behavior score. The 2
scales showed adequate internal consistency (α = .61 for both).
Indexes of the Degree of Familial Risk
Severity of parental MDD16,34 and familial loading for MDD in
additional family members17 were used to index the degree of
offspring familial risk. Using a life-history calendar,35,36 par-
ents reported on any hospitalizations for depression and gave
details of their previous worst 2 episodes of depression and as-
sociated impairment.46 A severe episode of depression was de-
fined as a period of hospitalization due to depression or an epi-
sode of depression with severe impairment in at least 1 area of
functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale score,
≤50).34,46 Family history of depression in addition to the in-
dex parent was ascertained by asking parents about a diagno-
sis of depression in first- and second-degree relatives of the
child. The number of family members with a history of depres-
sion was weighted by relatedness.17
Social Adversity Indexes
A measure of psychosocial adversity was derived from recent
stressful life events.47 A total score (maximum, 21) was calcu-
lated by summing stressful events occurring within the past
12 months. Sample items include death of a close friend, se-
rious illness, being bullied, and increased quarrelling be-
tween parents. If a life event was reported by the parent or the
child, it was considered present.48
Low parent-reported household income was considered
ameasureofeconomicdisadvantageandwasdefinedasagross
annual family income of £20 000 (US $24 368) or less.49 In this
sample, the amount is equivalent to the international defini-
tion of poverty (<60% of the median income).50
Statistical Analysis
Structural equation modeling, which enables simultaneous as-
sessment of all hypothesized risk paths, was performed. The

sented as standardized β coefficients. We hypothesized that ir-

Twenty (6 males and 14 females) had new-onset MDD, with a
mean (SD) age at onset of 14.4 (2.0) years (range, 10-18 years)
(Table). Structural equation modeling analysis results for the
primary outcome of new-onset offspring MDD are shown in
the Figure and are described below.
Dimensional Clinical Antecedents
Irritability was associated with new-onset MDD (β = 0.12,
P = .03), as was fear/anxiety (β = 0.38, P < .001). In contrast,
allowing for other effects in the full model, neither disruptive
behavior (β = −0.08, P = .14) nor low mood (β = −0.03, P = .65)
was associated with new-onset MDD. To compare the magni-
tude of the 2 paths showing significant association with new-
onset MDD (irritability and fear/anxiety), we constrained them
tobeequal,whichresultedinasignificantχ2change(χ2
1 = 9.09,
P = .003), indicating that the path from fear/anxiety to new-
onset MDD was significantly stronger. The association be-
tween irritability and fear/anxiety was low but significant
(β = 0.17, P = .001), suggesting that they do not frequently
co-occur (Figure).
Indexes of Familial Risk
The direct paths from additional family history of depression
to new-onset MDD (β = 0.10, P = .03) and from parental de-
pression severity to new-onset MDD (β = 0.24, P < .001) were
significant. Neither of the indexes of familial risk was associ-
ated with the clinical antecedents.
Indexes of Social Risk
Both economic disadvantage (β = 0.12, P = .02) and recent psy-
chosocial adversity (β = 0.22, P < .001) had significant direct
effects on new-onset MDD. In addition, economic disadvan-
tage and recent psychosocial adversity were associated with
the clinical antecedents.
Indirect Effects
We hypothesized that indexes of familial and social risk would
influence risk for new-onset MDD indirectly via the dimen-
sional clinical antecedents, as well as directly. None of the in-
direct effects were significant, including economic disadvan-
tage to new-onset MDD via irritability (β = 0.007, P = .32),
economic disadvantage via fear/anxiety (β = −0.012, P = .43),
recent psychosocial adversity via fear/anxiety (β = −0.012,
P = .45), and irritability (β = 0.003, P = .57).
Secondary Analysis
The CAPA-derived DSM-IV MDD symptoms were assessed as
a secondary outcome (eAppendix in the Supplement). The
pattern of the results was similar to the findings for the pri-
mary outcome. The only exception was that the paths to
MDD symptoms from irritability and from fear/anxiety were
not significantly different (χ 2
1 = 0.27, P = .61). The small
number of affected boys (Table) precluded examination of
sex differences for new-onset MDD. We thought it impor-
tant to examine age effects by identifying and excluding
prepuberty-onset MDD cases given evidence that they may
differ from puberty-onset cases.22 We also considered
excluding cases in which irritability was the defining MDD
mood symptom. However, there were no such instances
(eAppendix in the Supplement). Additional sensitivity
analyses (eAppendix in the Supplement) examined which of
the separate aspects of fear/anxiety (generalized anxiety,
social anxiety, etc) were most associated with new-onset
MDD and whether irritability and fear/anxiety predicted an
earlier child or adolescent onset. The results suggested that
generalized anxiety symptoms were driving the predictive
effect of fear/anxiety on new-onset MDD and that fear/
anxiety (and not irritability) predicted an especially early
MDD onset.

Discussion
In a longitudinal study of children and adolescents at high fa-
milial risk of MDD, we examined mechanisms underlying the
development of a first episode of adolescent-onset MDD. Si-
multaneous testing of different pathways suggested 6 routes
to adolescent depression (2 via the clinical antecedents and 4
via familial/genetic and social risk factors). Both irritability and
fear/anxiety predicted new adolescent-onset MDD and MDD
symptomcount.Theseeffectswereindependentofeachother,
as well as of disruptive behavior and low mood. These ante-
cedents are often examined individually and are correlated. To
our knowledge, their joint contribution has not been exam-
ined together in this way. The observation that irritability and
not other aspects of oppositional behavior increased risk for
new-onsetMDDisconsistentwiththeresultsfrompopulation-
based studies.23,26,45,52 Subthreshold low mood symptoms are
known to predate depression.21,24 Therefore, the finding that
fear/anxiety predicted new-onset MDD over and above the ef-
fect of low mood may seem surprising, but these dimensions
are highly correlated (Figure). While anxiety and depression
cross-predict each other over time,26,53-59 anxiety typically
emerges earlier,22 which may contribute to the stronger predic-
tive effect observed for fear/anxiety on first adolescent-onset
MDD. Sensitivity analyses illustrated that generalized anxiety
symptoms were driving the predictive effect of fear/anxiety on
new-onset MDD. Overall, our findings suggest that also target-
ing irritability or fear/anxiety60,61 as a means of depression pre-
vention in children seems warranted. Investigating the neural
orbehavioralcorrelatesofirritabilityandfear/anxietymayhelp
elucidate how these dimensions increase MDD risk.62
We predicted that indicators of familial loading and so-
cial risk would influence MDD onset indirectly via effects on
dimensional clinical antecedents. We did not find such evi-
dence, and all the indirect paths were nonsignificant. In con-
trast, there were significant direct effects of all familial/
geneticandsocialriskfactorsonMDD.Therefore,theindicators
of social risk predicted MDD independent of correlated famil-
ial risk, parental depression severity, and clinical anteced-
ents in the child. This result has important implications for
treatment and prevention and highlights the need to resolve
not only clinical phenomena in the child but also wider con-
textual difficulties. Effective prevention of adolescent MDD is
important given the potential for long-term beneficial effects
on adult functioning.63 Our findings suggest that primary pre-
vention methods for depression in groups with high familial
risk will need to include effective treatment of parental
depression,30,64,65 irritability, and fear/anxiety in the child and
consider social risk factors. Family-based programs may be in-
dicated in children at high familial risk of depression because
parental depression is associated with social adversity (pov-
erty and stress exposure)66-68 and moderates the effective-
ness of preventive programs focusing on the child.30,69 Our re-
sults underscore the potent effect of social risks in the initial
development of adolescent depression.49,66,70,71
This study has several important strengths, including a
large, prospective longitudinal investigation of children and
adolescents at high familial risk of MDD with repeated mea-
surement using comprehensive psychiatric assessments, al-
lowing a novel focus on incident cases of new-onset MDD, low
rates of attrition across assessments, and the use of a method
appropriate for simultaneously modeling multiple correlated
risk effects. However, the results should be interpreted in light
of some considerations and limitations.
Limitations
First,althoughtheratesofMDDwerehigherthanthoseincom-
parable community studies,56 participants in this sample had
not yet reached the peak period of risk for MDD, which occurs
in early adult life; therefore, the numbers with MDD are low.
However, the findings were replicated for MDD symptom
count. Second, we selected the clinical antecedents and indi-
cators of familial and psychosocial risk on the basis of empiri-
cal evidence.6,8,9,17,20,21,23,26,27,45 It is inevitable that some vari-
ables viewed to be important because they are disrupted in
major depression (eg, parenting72 and neuropsychological or
cognitive dysfunction73) will have been omitted. Measure-
ment differences between constructs may also contribute to
the results (eg, the clinical antecedent construct of fear/
anxiety contained more items than that for irritability). Third,

we cannot rule out person effects on the environment (ie, that
individuals to some extent elicit environmental risk expo-
sure through their behavior).74,75 However, it seems unlikely
that children evoke economic adversity, and evidence sug-
gests causal effects of psychosocial adversity on MDD when
accounting for inherited influences on environmental
exposure.76 Fourth, as would be expected, there were few boys
with MDD in the sample, meaning that we were unable to as-
sess sex differences in the pathways to first-onset MDD. Such
variations in the pathways to lifetime adult MDD have been
reported77-79; therefore, whether there are sex differences in
pathways to the incidence of adolescent-onset MDD will re-
quirefutureinvestigation.Pooledanalysesacrossmultipledata
sets may be needed to increase sample sizes for such analy-
ses. Fifth, we assessed indicators of familial risk for MDD using
data from clinical interviews as opposed to measured geno-
types. However, family history provides complementary in-
formation to molecular genetic risk scores, which are only
weakly predictive at present.80 Sixth, the sample consisted
mostly of depressed mothers, making it unclear whether the
findings would generalize to the offspring of depressed fa-
thers, which warrants future investigation.
Conclusions
This study of children and adolescents at high familial risk of
MDD shows that irritability and fear/anxiety are important
clinical antecedents of new-onset MDD but that familial and
social risk factors also contribute to risk for the initial onset of
adolescent MDD. Primary depression prevention or early
intervention strategies may need to not only target clinical
features in the high-risk child and the parent but also incor-
porate public health and community strategies to help over-
come social risks, most notably poverty and psychosocial
adversity.

Invited Commentary
Prevention Targets for Child and Adolescent Depression
Anne L. Glowinski, MD, MPE; Max S. Rosen, MD
In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry, Rice and colleagues1 chal-
lenge us to prioritize the prevention of child and adolescent
depression. As summarized by the authors, the problem is of
major public health significance.
Thestudy’
smajorcontributionistheexaminationandelu-
cidation of pathways to first-onset major depressive disorder
(MDD) in children and adolescents 9 to 17 years old at high risk
for depression as indexed by
a parental history of at least 2
episodes of MDD. Much ex-
tantworkhasidentifiedthose
risk factors that place adolescents at highest risk for depres-
sion, such as the independent influences of parental depres-
sion and low socioeconomic status, both of which increase the
hazard ratios 2-fold for adolescent depression.2
Rice and colleagues1 uncover multiple possible pathways
to first-onset MDD, including indirectly through clinical an-
tecedents categorized as fear/anxiety (β = 0.38, P < .001) and
irritability (β = 0.12, P = .03). Most important, those 2 ante-
cedents have not been used as often as low mood (β = −0.03,
P = .65inthepresentstudy)inpreventiontrialstoindicatehigh
risk, despite some previous evidence that they are pheno-
types that indeed predict the development of depression. For
example, Whelan and coworkers3 found that postnatal mater-
nal depressive symptoms were associated with adolescent ir-
ritability symptoms, which in turn correlated with adoles-
cent depressive symptoms (β = 0.11, P < .05). Notably, poverty
(β = 0.12, P = .02), severity of parental illness (β = 0.24,
P < .001), and psychosocial adversity (β = 0.22, P > .001), as
measured by a composite score of recent stressful life events,
contributesignificantlyanddirectlytofirst-onsetMDD.1There-
fore, the present study will potentially pave the way for bet-
ter prevention targets in high-risk youth.
It is critical to pause and reflect on the fact that this study
also strengthens previous findings that exposure to parental
depression and low socioeconomic status are significant and
independent risk factors for youth depression.4 Clinicians are
typically familiar with the concepts of primary, secondary, and
tertiary prevention, but fewer are aware of the paradox by
Rose,5 which involves understanding the surprising differ-
ence between the effect of individual-level (often termed tar-
geted) vs population-level (often termed universal) preven-
tion approaches. Although population-level risk factors
typically have much smaller effect sizes than individual-
level risk factors for a given person (eg, an urban environ-
ment vs a family history in a first-degree relative as an indi-
vidual risk factor for schizophrenia), they paradoxically affect
a much larger number of people and thus translate into po-
tentially large effect sizes at the population level. This large
influence is intuitively not anticipated, especially not by cli-
nicians, who are still largely trained to think about illnesses
at individual levels rather than at population levels.
Most reviews of youth depression prevention efforts con-
cur that selective prevention programs (those targeting high-
risk individuals) outperform universal intervention pro-
grams, which direct efforts at all individuals in a given
population. For instance, in their meta-analysis of 32 differ-
ent depression prevention strategies that mostly used cogni-
tive behavior therapy, stress reduction, and problem-solving
techniques, Stice and colleagues6 concluded that studies tar-
geting adolescents with depression risk factors, such as nega-
tive cognitions or anhedonia, had a moderate effect size on av-
erage (r = 0.23, P < .001), whereas the mean effect size for
universal prevention programs was trivial (r = 0.04, not sig-
nificant). Ahlen and colleagues2 explain this finding as pre-
dictable because higher-risk adolescents have more room for
improvement (hence the larger effects on depressive symp-
toms of targeted vs universal prevention programs). Al-
though much of the evidence suggests that most of the effect
ofuniversaltrialsisdrivenbyimprovementinadolescentswith
