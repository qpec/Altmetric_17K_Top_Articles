Objective: Exosomes from obese adipose contain dysregulated microRNAs linked to insulin signaling, as
compared with lean controls, providing a direct connection between adiposity and insulin resistance. This
study tested the hypotheses that gastric bypass surgery and its subsequent weight loss would normalize
adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs associated with insulin signaling and the associated metabo-
lome related to glucose homeostasis.
Methods: African American female subjects with obesity (N 5 6; age: 38.5 6 6.8 years; BMI: 51.2 6
8.8 kg/m2) were tested before and 1 year after surgery. Insulin resistance (HOMA), serum metabolomics,
and global microRNA profiles of circulating adipocyte-derived exosomes were evaluated via ANCOVA
and correlational analyses.
Results: One year postsurgery, patients showed decreased BMI (218.6 6 5.1 kg/m2; P < 0.001), amelio-
rated insulin resistance (HOMA: 1.94 6 0.6 presurgery, 0.49 6 0.1 postsurgery; P < 0.001), and altered
metabolites including branched chain amino acids (BCAA). Biological pathway analysis of predicted
mRNA targets of 168 surgery-responsive microRNAs (P < 0.05) identified the insulin signaling pathway (P
5 1.27E210; 52/138 elements), among others, in the data set. The insulin signaling pathway was also a
target of 10 microRNAs correlated to changes in HOMA (P < 0.05; r > 0.4), and 48 microRNAs correlated
to changes in BCAA levels.
Conclusions: These data indicate that circulating adipocyte-derived exosomes are modified following
gastric bypass surgery and correlate to improved postsurgery insulin resistance.

Introduction
Insulin resistance in patients with obesity significantly contributes to
the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus (T2DM). Adipose is a key modulator of systemic insulin
resistance and metabolic dysregulation, exerting effects via mecha-
nisms such as releasing proinflammatory cytokines into circulation
(1-4). Central adiposity has been strongly linked to the pathogenesis
of obesity-related comorbidities like insulin resistance in peripheral
tissues (5,6). However, large variations exist in the individual’s
response to obesity as some patients with high body mass index
(BMI) can have normal glucose homeostasis while others with nor-
mal BMI can have frank diabetes (7). Clearly the volume of adipose
tissue alone does not portend systemic disease, suggesting adipose
function must also play a critical role.
Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ, which synthesizes and
releases adipokines (such as leptin, resistin, and adiponectin) that act
as
autocrine,
paracrine,
and
endocrine
factors
to
modulate

 metabolism locally and at distant sites (3,8). Ectopic adipose accu-
mulation can significantly compromise insulin sensitivity by interfer-
ing with insulin signaling (9). However, variability in the relation-
ship between BMI and overall insulin resistance highlights a major
gap in our understanding of how adipose accumulation may affect
overall glucose regulation.
One potential mechanism that could link adipose accumulation to
overall glucose regulation is interorgan signaling from adipose tissue
via exosomes. Deng et al.’s (10) was the first study to suggest
adipocyte-derived exosomes could affect insulin resistance, finding
that obesity-related microRNAs targeted key biological pathways
that impact insulin signaling using an animal model. Exosomes are
nanoparticle-sized endocytic vesicles that transport lipids, sugars,
nucleic acids, and proteins between cells (11,12). Exosomal signal-
ing is largely determined by their microRNA content, which can
control gene expression in target cells by inhibiting mRNA transla-
tion or enhancing mRNA degradation (13,14).
We recently described obesity-related differences in the microRNA
content of exosomes derived from human obese visceral adipose tis-
sue as compared with those from lean subjects (15) and identified
adipocyte-derived exosomal signaling as a mediator linking adipos-
ity and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (15,16). While these
previous experiments showed the chronic effects of obesity on
adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNA contents, the ability of sig-
nificant weight loss to reverse these changes and the potential for
cardiometabolic health gains are yet to be determined.
There is ample evidence that bariatric surgery leads to weight loss
and improved glucose regulation, though the mechanisms by which
surgery produces these effects, and their interdependence, are
unclear (17). The overall goal of this project was to determine
whether

changes
circulating
adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs in subjects with obesity.
We hypothesized that surgery-responsive microRNA levels 1 year
after gastric bypass would be involved in insulin signaling pathways
and that microRNA levels would correlate to clinical improvements
in insulin sensitivity.
Methods
Study participants
Subjects were adult African American females (age range 27–49)
recruited from a bariatric surgery program at Vidant Medical Center
(Greenville, NC). All study protocols were approved by Institutional
Review Boards at both East Carolina University and Children’s
National Health System and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants. Inclusion criteria included age between 25 and
60 years, BMI between 35 and 65 kg/m2, negative pregnancy test,
and a willingness to comply with study requirements. Subjects were
excluded if they were taking thiazolidinediones or if they had previ-
ous bariatric surgery. Diabetes was diagnosed at enrollment in
accordance with the criteria of the NIH Consortium for the Longitu-
dinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery.
Surgery and clinical data collection
Each subject was enrolled in the standard clinical protocol for gas-
tric bypass surgery at Vidant Medical Center. Two weeks before
surgery and 1 year postsurgery, anthropometric measurements (age,
height, weight) and blood samples (via antecubital venipuncture)
were collected using standard clinical methods. Whole blood was
fractionated into serum and plasma components for further study.
BMI was calculated as kg/m2. Insulin was measured by immunoas-
say (Access Immunoassay System, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA)
and glucose with an oxidation reaction (YSI 2300, Yellow Springs,
OH). The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2) was calculated
from
plasma
glucose
and
insulin
levels
(www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/
homacalculator).
Circulating adipocyte-derived exosome isolation
Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was used as a sensitive and
specific marker for adipocyte-derived exosomes isolated from 500
lL plasma and serum samples (18). First, exosomes were pelleted
using Exoquick TC (Systems Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA) and then
pellets were resuspended in 100 lL PBS. We then used commer-
cially available antibody complexes and dextran-coated magnetic
particles (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) to target
FABP41 exosomes in plasma and serum. The anti-FABP4-antibody
(mouse monoclonal) complexes link targeted exosomes to magnetic
particles. Labeled exosomes were then pulled to the sides of the
tube when the sample was placed in a magnet. Magnetically labeled
exosomes remained in the tube while other exosomes were poured
off into a new tube. The exosomes were then prepared for RNA
studies as described below.
RNA extraction and amplification
We extracted adipocyte-exosomal total RNA using mirVana micro-
RNA Isolation Kits (Life Technologies) and amplified total RNA
with the Complete Seramir Exosome RNA Amplification Kit from
media and urine (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) accord-
ing to manufacturer’s instructions. We used the Agilent 2100 Bioa-
nalyzer RNA Pico Chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to
assess RNA quality at each step.
RNA expression and statistical analyses
We labeled 1,000 ng RNA with AffymetrixV
R FlashTagTM Biotin
HSR RNA Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to
standard procedures. Labeled RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix
GeneChipV
R microRNA 4.0 arrays and run using a Fluidics Station
450 Protocol (FS450_002) (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Data dis-
cussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series acces-
sion GSE74083 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
Resulting data were analyzed in Expression ConsoleTM using
RMA 1 DMBG (Affymetrix) and then exported to Partek Genomics
Suite for analyses. Only mature human microRNAs were retained
for
statistical
comparison
between
groups.
Repeated
measures
ANCOVA (time; age covariate) was used to compare microRNA
expression from pre- to postsurgery, using P � 0.05 as a filter.
Rather than use a false discovery rate on the initial microRNA data
set, we carried all microRNAs that met the unadjusted P < 0.05 cut-
off into biological pathway analysis and used more stringent cutoffs
during the pathway identification process (as described below). The
relationship between insulin resistance (HOMA) and microRNA

 changes from baseline to 1 year postsurgery was also assessed using
Pearson correlation coefficients.
Biological pathway analyses
MicroRNAs found to be differentially regulated from pre- to postsur-
gery were uploaded into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Suite (IPAV
R,
Ingenuity Inc., Redwood City, CA) for further analyses. First, targets
of microRNAs were determined using IPA’s microRNA Target Filter,
which identifies experimentally validated microRNA-mRNA interac-
tions from TarBase, miRecords, and the peer-reviewed biomedical lit-
erature, as well as predicted microRNA-mRNA interactions from Tar-
getScan. We used a conservative filter at this point, using only
experimentally validated and highly conserved predicted mRNA tar-
gets for each microRNA. We carried these mRNA targets through to
core pathway analyses, which identified relationships among the
mRNAs in our data set. The P values represented by the pathway
analyses reduce the risk of false-positive findings from the original
repeated measures ANOVA, as false-positive findings occur at ran-
dom, while pathways are created only using biologically related ele-
ments (i.e., nonrandom). Canonical pathways, novel networks, and
common upstream regulators were then queried for overlap with our
differentially expressed microRNA gene target list.
Plasma metabolites
Targeted analysis of 42 amine-containing metabolites consisting of
20 major amino acids and secondary metabolites of arginine and
cysteine that are sensitive to inflammation and oxidative stress were
performed as described previously (19,20). Briefly, plasma was
acidified with 5% perchloric acid containing eight stable isotope
internal standards. Acid-soluble supernatant was used for strong-
cation exchange solid-phase extraction to capture cationic amine-
containing metabolites. Extracted metabolites were further derived
with
isopropyl chloroformate.
Derivatives
of
metabolites were
resolved using Agilent 1260 ultra-high pressure liquid chromatogra-
phy and eluted with a gradient of water and isopropanol (65% v/v).
An Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with
Agilent 1200 UPLC system was used to detect resolved analytes and
quantified using authenticated external and internal standards.

 Gastric bypass surgery decreases insulin
resistance
Changes from baseline to the 1-year postsurgery time point included
a 15.1 6 8.7% reduction in fasting plasma glucose and a 74 6 4.3%
reduction in fasting plasma insulin (Table 1).
Pre- versus post-bypass surgery microRNA
comparisons
One hundred sixty-eight known mature human microRNAs were dif-
ferentially expressed after surgery in circulating adipocyte-derived
exosomes compared with presurgery baseline. Once a conservative
filter was applied (only microRNAs with experimentally confirmed
or highly conserved predicted targets), 56 microRNAs remained,
which collectively putatively target 7,143 mRNAs.
Using the 7,143 mRNA targets of the 56 surgery-responsive micro-
RNAs, we used IPA to identify enriched biological pathways. Using
a P value filter for pathway significance of P < 0.01, 36 canonical
pathways were identified as enriched in the surgery-responsive data
set. Table 2 presents the top 15 canonical pathways by IPA pathway
rank score that had >25 elements in our data set and are related to
metabolism. This last filter was used to screen out ubiquitous
cancer-specific pathways.
One of the top canonical pathways identified as enriched was the
WNT-b catenin pathway (41 molecules in our data set/167 mole-
cules in pathway; pathway P 5 1.41E212), similar to what we
found
when
analyzing
the
adipose-derived
exosomes
isolated
directly from the visceral adipose itself (15). Another top predicted
canonical pathway for the pre- to postsurgery analysis was Insulin
Receptor Signaling (Figure 1), with 32/134 elements represented in
Figure 1 Insulin receptor signaling pathway targeted by surgery-responsive microRNAs. The canonical pathway for insulin receptor signaling was highly ranked as a tar-
get for surgery-responsive microRNAs. Green color indicates predicted downregulation of target transcripts by differentially expressed microRNAs (i.e., upregulated
microRNAs that inhibit mRNA target production), and red color indicates predicted upregulation of mRNA targets. Genes in gray and marked with an asterisk (*) repre-
sent targets of multiple microRNAs that have different correlational directions in relation to HOMA change. Specific fold changes and microRNA-mRNA pairings are
detailed in Table 3. The pathway was generated using QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPAV
R , QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).

 the affected mRNA target set (pathway P 5 5.65E207). Specific
microRNA-mRNA pairs in this pathway are listed in Table 3.
Pre- versus post-bypass surgery microRNA
changes correlated to insulin resistance
Using Pearson correlational analyses between change in all micro-
RNA levels and change in HOMA from baseline to 1 year postsur-
gery, change in 46 known mature microRNAs was significantly cor-
related to change in HOMA. Once a conservative filter was applied
(only experimentally confirmed or highly conserved predicted tar-
gets), 29 microRNA remained, which together putatively target
4,266 mRNAs.
Using the 4,266 mRNA targets of the 29 microRNAs that correlated
to HOMA changes after surgery, we again used IPA to identify
enriched biological pathways. Despite having fewer microRNAs and
mRNA targets in the experimental gene set, the correlational analy-
ses generated more significant pathways than the ANOVA compari-
son, with 132 pathways having P value scores of P < 0.01. All but
one of the top 15 pathways from the ANOVA comparison were also
significantly represented in the correlational gene set (Table 2), with
the exception of the apoptosis pathway.
Insulin Receptor Signaling (Figure 2) was again identified as being
enriched in our data set, with 52/134 elements represented in the
HOMA-correlated
mRNA
target
set
(pathway
P 5 1.27E210).
Specifically, 10 microRNAs that correlated to HOMA each con-
tained �3 target mRNAs within the Insulin Receptor Signaling
canonical pathway and are listed in Table 4.
Bypass surgery-induced weight loss and
metabolic improvements
To further investigate metabolic changes in patients following gas-
tric bypass, metabolomic profiles of amine-containing metabolites
were quantified at baseline (2 weeks before surgery) and 1 year fol-
lowing
gastric
bypass
surgery.
Metabolites
were
assessed
by
ANCOVA over time and were correlated to HOMA levels and
changes in exosomal microRNAs.

 At 1 year postsurgery, there were significant rises in asparagine
(155%; P 5 0.035), citrulline (159%; P 5 0.008), glutamine (Gln;
130%; P 5 0.014; Figure 3A), glycine (191%; P < 0.001; Figure
3F), and histidine (147%; P 5 0.027). Significant reductions were
found in cysteinylglycine (219%; P 5 0.006), glutamic acid (Glu;
227%; P 5 0.038; Figure 3B), leucine/isoleucine (215%; P 5
0.034; Figure 3D), total branched chain amino acids (BCAAs)
(231%; P 5 0.033; Figure 3E), and the Glu/Gln ratio (245%; P 5
0.008, Figure 3C).
Several metabolites were significantly correlated to HOMA values,
including asparagine (r 5 0.84, P < 0.001; CI: 0.52 to 0.95), gly-
cine (r 5 0.72, P < 0.01; CI: 0.24 to 0.91), lysine (r 5 0.70, P 5
0.01; CI: 0.21 to 0.91), and histidine (r 5 0.64, P 5 0.03; CI: 0.08
to 0.88). Both Glu (r 5 20.54, P 5 0.07; CI: 20.85 to 20.04) and
Gln (r 5 0.53, P 5 0.07; CI: 20.05 to 20.84) showed trends
toward correlating with HOMA, while the Gln/Glu ratio (r 5 20.62,
P 5 0.03; CI: 20.87 to 20.07) was significantly correlated to
HOMA.
As BCAAs have been particularly linked to insulin dysregulation
(and HOMA), lastly we identified exosomal microRNAs that corre-
lated to total BCAAs as measured in our metabolite panel. Using P
< 0.05, 135 microRNAs were significantly correlated with BCAA
levels pre- and postsurgery. Of these 135, 91 have conservatively
mapped mRNA targets, totaling 8,695 mRNA targets. In the Insulin
Receptor Signaling canonical pathway, 48 microRNAs targeting 78
mRNAs were significantly correlated to BCAA levels. The micro-
RNAs with the most targets in the Insulin Receptor Signaling path-
way included let-7a-5p (r 5 20.7; 11 targets including INSR, IRS2,
and KRAS) and miR-16-5p (r 5 0.66; 28 targets including INSR,

 Discussion
Increased adiposity (especially within visceral depots) is associated
with insulin resistance, a key early mechanism driving the develop-
ment of T2DM. While this association is epidemiologically strong,
direct mechanisms by which adipose impacts glucose metabolism in
tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver are still unclear. Here, we
show that circulating adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs tar-
geting the canonical Insulin Receptor Signaling pathway are altered
following bariatric surgery-induced weight loss. Many of these
microRNAs also significantly correlate with robust clinical improve-
ments in insulin resistance. This is consistent with our previous
work, wherein we reported obesity-dysregulated microRNAs in vis-
ceral adipocyte-derived exosomes are predicted to impair insulin
receptor signaling in adolescents with obesity, suggesting that
obesity-dysregulated exosome signaling from adipose could be posi-
tively impacted by weight loss following bariatric surgery (15,16).
Initially proposed in the late 1970s, the amelioration of type 2 diabetes
following bariatric surgery has been the object of intense study for the
past decade (21,22). In a 2004 meta-analysis of >22,000 patients follow-
ing bariatric surgery, Buchwald et al. (23) reported resolution of diabetes
in 77% of patients. Similarly, the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Data-
base shows diabetes resolution at 1year after gastric bypass in 62% (24).
In the past decade, the resolution of diabetes (and other obesity comor-
bidities) has been debated at great length, especially relating to whether
the effects are weight loss-dependent or a result of the bypass procedure
itself. As all of the patients in our cohort lost significant amounts of
excess weight at 1 year after gastric bypass, we cannot clarify that debate,
but we do provide evidence of a potential direct link by which loss of or
change in adiposity could directly modulate insulin resistance in the
periphery. Further studies that directly compare exosomal microRNA
changes between nonsurgical weight loss (i.e., diet or exercise interven-
tion) and gastric bypass would be able to shed light on the contributing
effects of the procedure, in contrast to weight loss, on exosomal
signaling.
Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple microRNAs are
involved in glucose homeostasis, including miRs-33, 2103, 2107,
and 229a/b (25-28). However, relatively little is known about which
microRNAs are most strongly related to clinical changes in insulin
sensitivity. Various diabetes and surgery models have associated lev-
els of a variety of microRNAs with diabetic status and/or HOMA,
such as miR-146a (29), miRs-375 and 230d (30), miR-103 (31),
miRs-128, 2130b-3p, 2374a-5p, and 2423-5p (32), and miR-223
(33). Of these, we found that miR 103-3p was increased almost 60%
after surgery and had multiple targets in the insulin receptor signaling
pathway. None of the other aforementioned microRNAs were corre-
lated to HOMA in our study or had greater than three targets in the
insulin signaling canonical pathway. Glucose homeostasis is a com-
plex clinical trait, likely affected by multiple microRNAs, which can
change depending on which metabolically active tissue is affected. A
recent review by Vienberg et al. (34) listed close to 50 microRNAs
that affect various metabolically active tissues. Rather than focus our
discussion on individual microRNAs in circulating exosomes, we
instead focus on biological pathways that are targets of the collective
microRNA profiles. By coupling a statistically powerful longitudinal
study design with a large effect size for HOMA improvements after
surgery, our data represent a collective picture of how surgery-
responsive microRNAs could affect important biological pathways
underlying the insulin sensitivity clinical trait.
We also found significant metabolomic profile changes in the blood
of patients with obesity patients 1 year following bypass surgery.
Significant weight reduction following surgery was associated with
a significant rise in fasting plasma Gln and decrease in Glu. The
plasma Glu/Gln ratio is significantly elevated in obesity and associ-
ated with elevated risk for diabetes (35), and thus the increase in
Gln and decrease in Glu would normalize this ratio, thereby reduc-
ing the risk of diabetes. Similarly, BCAA accumulation is associated
with increased insulin resistance (36-38), and we found significant
reductions in fasting plasma BCAAs in our patients following
bypass surgery. In animal models of diet-induced obesity, elevation
in fasting BCAAs was associated with decreased catabolism in adi-
pose tissue (38). A decrease in BCAAs and an associated increase
in fasting Gln can also arise from improved muscle catabolism of
BCAAs where excess nitrogen can be removed through Gln export
(39). This would occur if muscle insulin sensitivity improved fol-
lowing weight loss. Thus it is possible that adipocyte-derived exoso-
mal microRNA changes and their subsequent effect on the muscle
may drive these changes. While we did not specifically measure

 muscle insulin sensitivity, our patients demonstrated robust improve-
ments in HOMA, indicating improved peripheral insulin sensitivity.
In order to more definitively evaluate the relationship between the
adipocyte exosomes and the muscle, in vitro assessment of the effect
of exosome exposure on insulin signaling in primary skeletal muscle
would be required.
Regarding extrapolation of our data to previous studies in the area,
our previous data and others suggest the visceral fat is more diabeto-
genic than the subcutaneous tissue, which may explain why our
identified microRNAs are different than in other reports. Further-
more, it is likely that race and ethnicity play a role in the microRNA
content of adipocyte-derived exosomes. Our study explored surgery-
induced changes in African American females, a group that has a
disproportional burden of T2DM (though our cohort was largely
insulin resistant rather than overtly diabetic). Further testing of our
hypotheses in different biological groups will test the universal
nature of the mechanism.
Conclusion
In summary, our data show that the microRNA content of circulat-
ing adipocyte-derived exosomes isolated from the peripheral blood
are significantly modified following gastric bypass bariatric surgery
and these changes are correlated to improvements in insulin resist-
ance after surgery. Furthermore, we show that the altered micro-
RNAs target a myriad of members in the insulin receptor signaling
pathway. Lastly, we found metabolomic changes (specifically a
decrease in BCAAs) in our patients after bypass consistent with
improved glucose homeostasis. Further elucidating the role of
adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNAs in bariatric surgery patients
provides a unique opportunity to understand obesity-related insulin
resistance and its response to surgical intervention and perhaps will
lead to novel intervention strategies in the future.O
