Public health concerns exist surrounding the epi-
demic of the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the rapid growth
of transplantation in developing countries, including
endemic zones of active arbovirus transmission, as
well as travel to such regions by potential organ
donors and recipients. Few data exist regarding the
clinical characteristics of ZIKV infection in immuno-
compromised hosts. Laboratory screening protocols
for transplantation to differentiate ZIKV infections
from
other
endemic
viral
diseases
and
for
the
detection of possible donor-derived infection have
not been stated. The diagnosis of ZIKV infection
remains a challenge, fueled by the lack of standard-
ized
commercially
available
diagnostic
tests
and
validated reference diagnostic laboratories, as well
as the limited duration of ZIKV viremia. In this
small series, ZIKV infection in renal and liver recipi-
ents presented without rash, conjunctivitis, or neu-
rological
symptoms,
and
with
abnormal
graft
function, thrombocytopenia, and bacterial superin-
fection. We report the first case series of ZIKV
infection in solid organ recipients, with a descrip-
tion of clinical and laboratory features and thera-
peutic management.

Introduction
The detection of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in the Feder-
ated States of Micronesia (Yap Island) in 2007 marked its
emergence outside Africa and Asia, and documented the
first large-scale ZIKV outbreak among humans. Since
then, ZIKV has been reported in French Polynesia, New
Caledonia, Cook Islands, Easter Island (Chile), Samoa,
Brazil, and nearly every country in the Americas and the
Caribbean. Its association with increased numbers of
microcephaly and Guillain-Barr�
e syndrome has led the
World Health Organization to declare a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern on February 1, 2016
(1,2). On May 2016, 48 countries and territories were
found to have active ZIKV transmission (3). Recently,
autochthonous
ZIKV
transmission
has
also
been
described in Cape Verde (4) and in the southern state of
Florida, United States (5).
In urban and periurban environments, ZIKV is transmitted
in
a
human–mosquito–human
transmission
cycle
by
mainly two species of Aedes mosquitoes—Ae. aegypti
and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus (6,7). Epidemiolog-
ical evidence suggests that ZIKV may be also transmitted
from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy (8), sex-
ual intercourse (9), and blood transfusion (10). The usual
clinical presentation of ZIKV infection, in the general pop-
ulation, is usually nonspecific (mild fever, rash, arthralgia,
and conjunctivitis) and might be misdiagnosed as several
other arboviral diseases, most commonly dengue and
chikungunya fever (11). ZIKV infection has also been
associated with newborn microcephaly (12) and neuro-
logical complications, such as meningoencephalitis (13)
and Guillain-Barr�
e syndrome (14).
Thus far, no cases of ZIKV infection have been reported
in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTr). As for other
novel pathogens, the risk of development of severe dis-
ease due to ZIKV in these patients is unknown. Given

 the rapid growth of transplantation in developing coun-
tries, including endemic zones of active arbovirus trans-
mission (e.g. Brazil), as well as travel to such regions by
potential organ donors and recipients, it is important to
describe the clinical characteristics of ZIKV infection in
immunocompromised hosts. Here, we describe four SOT
patients who presented in 2015 with a positive ZIKA
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and negative assays for other arbovirus infections, such
as dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV).
Methods
Patients were identified at a single center (Hospital de Base) located in
S~
ao Jos�
e do Rio Preto, northwest of S~
ao Paulo State, Brazil. This region
is endemic for the circulation of DENV, and other arboviruses and co-
infections with more than one arbovirus are observed (15,16). All Zika
cases were confirmed by PCR and were observed during the recent epi-
demic between June 2015 and January 2016.
All dengue-suspected SOT patients seen at our center were screened by
PCR for exposure to the following arboviruses: DENV1–4, CHIKV, ZIKV,
Saint Louis encephalitis (SLEV), Rocio virus (ROCV), Ilh�
eus virus, Bus-
saquara virus, Iguape virus, and West Nile virus (WNV). The screening
period for these samples was within the onset of symptoms and the vire-
mia phase (up to 7 days). DENV diagnosis was made according to Brazil-
ian Ministry of Health guidelines in suspected patients living in or coming
from areas with reported dengue or with the Ae. aegypti mosquito and
who presented with fever usually between 2 and 7 days and with two or
more of the following manifestations: nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia,
arthralgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, petechiae, positive tourniquet test,
and leukopenia (17). Blood samples were collected and the patients were
initially screened for DENV by NS1 and/or IgM (Alere S.A.).
PCR/quantitative PCR assays were applied to the isolated virus RNA to
determine a diagnosis of DENV 1–4 (18), ZIKV (19), or CHIKV (20). First,
flavivirus genus–specific primers, targeting conserved NS5 regions, were
used in a RT-PCR assay. Second, DENV 1–4, yellow fever virus (YFV),
and SLEV species-specific primers were used, because these viruses
are known to circulate in our region. In this way, multiplex nested PCR
was used to identify DENV 1–4 and YFV. Different N-PCRs were used
to detect SLEV, ROCV, Ilh�
eus virus, Bussaquara virus, Iguape virus, and
WNV (18). To detect ZIKV and CHIKV, a one-step quantitative, real-time,
fluorescent probed–based RT-PCR assay was performed using primers
targeting the envelop (E) and NSP1 regions, respectively (19,20). The
ZIKV assay presents a sensitivity limit of 100 and 25 copies according to
the set of primers/probes used (19). To CHIKV, the assay showed an
analytical sensitivity <1 plaque-forming unit to both sets of primers/
probes used (20). This study is part of an ongoing arbovirus surveillance
program

Results
Between January 2015 and April 2016, 187 SOT (129
kidney transplants [KTx] and 58 liver transplants [LTx])
were performed in our service and 40 patients were sus-
pected and were screened for DENV (KTx: 72.5% [29/
40] and LTx: 27.5% [11/40]). Serology anti-dengue IgM
and
NS1
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
tests
were performed based only in the beginning of symp-
toms and thus they were not used for every patient.
PCR was performed in 51.72% (15/29) of KTx and in
72.72% (8/11) of LTx. Four (10%; 4/40) of the dengue-
suspected patients were confirmed by RT-PCR as ZIKV
infections. All were male, two of these were liver recipi-
ents (LTx), and two of them were kidney recipients
(KTx). The laboratory and clinical profile of these patients
is described in Table 1.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and
patient hospital admission was 7.25 � 2.06 days (range
of 5–10 days). All ZIKV-infected SOTr presented with
complications, notably bacterial infections, and required
hospitalization related to their transplant status or to
ZIKV infection until resolution of their symptoms. One
LTx was re-hospitalized and required re-transplantation
due to hepatic artery thrombosis and biliary stenosis
91 days after ZIKV detection. Two patients reported fever,
myalgia, and adynamia, while no patient exhibited con-
junctivitis, exanthema, or neurological symptoms when
admitted to the hospital. Three out of four SOT patients
presented with anemia, and all of them had thrombocy-
topenia, with levels lower than 100 000/mm3 (platelet
count mean 94 750/mm3 � 29 600). Previous hematolog-
ical parameters about 1 month before ZIKV infection
detection are presented in Table 1. Signs of acute liver or
renal damage were observed in all patients. Both KTx
recipients had their immunosuppression regimen altered.
No donor had available data about Zika fever suggested–
symptoms, travel history, and/or previous ZIKV infection.
They were followed up upon discharge as required due to
their transplant follow-up care. Up to April 2016, no
patient had died or presented neurological symptoms of
any kind of clinical sequelae in follow-up visits.
Discussion
This is the first series of reports of ZIKV infection in
organ transplant recipients. Based on this small series, it
is not possible to ascertain the potential impact of ZIKV
in the immunosuppressed SOTr, including infectious
complications and graft rejection. Case reports describing
ZIKV infection in patients with conditions associated with
compromised immune systems are limited. Recently in
Colombia, two fatal cases were reported in patients with
leukemia, but the role of ZIKV infection in these cases
was unclear (21). Because of scarcity of data on this sub-
ject, management of ZIKV infection has been based on
past
experience
with
other
flavivirus
infections
in
immunocompromised hosts, including DENV infection in
SOT (22).
In the absence of data, some recommendations have
been published regarding arbovirus infection in SOT
(23). These recommendations suggest that transplant

 recipients and their physicians should familiarize them-
selves with the main clinical signs and complications
of
ZIKV
infection,
including
meningoencephalitis
and
Guillain–Barr�
e
syndrome.
The
overlap
between
the
symptoms of ZIKV infection and those caused by DENV,
especially in areas where these arboviruses circulate
concurrently, makes a differential diagnosis challenging
(11).
In this series, the mean period from the beginning of
symptoms until hospitalization was longer, at approxi-
mately 7.25 days, than for normal individuals with symp-
toms compatible with dengue or ZIKV for whom the
observed mean period was shorter at 2.76 days (�1.42;
range of 1–6 days) (24). Worsening liver or renal function
was observed in almost all SOT ZIKV-infected patients,
but given that they were also hospitalized due to compli-
cations, it is impossible to define, based on only these
descriptions, the potential impact of ZIKV on clinical pre-
sentation severity and outcomes of these infections in
an immunosuppressed individual.
The impact of immunosuppression on ZIKV infection in
SOT is unclear as is the impact of ZIKV on allograft
function. ZIKV must be compared with other arbovirus
infections that may co-exist in the same regions. The
laboratory and clinical profiles of DENV infection in SOT
have
been
described
previously
(25,26),
and
often
include
rash,
fever,
and
conjunctivitis,
which
were
absent in most of the present series. Thrombocytopenia
is a very common manifestation in dengue (27), but as
shown in this series, it is not exclusive to DENV infec-
tion as it was also observed in ZIKV infection. Data
regarding severe dengue (SD) in SOT are conflicting
(25), and early diagnosis and treatment are essential; in
areas where ZIKV and DENV are circulating concur-
rently, it is essential that diagnostic assays be utilized
for effective therapeutic management. Until recently,
ZIKV was believed to cause only mild disease, which it
still does in the majority of cases, with treatment
focused on symptoms, except for a growing body of
evidence that ZIKV infection results in severe congenital
(14) and neurologic complications (7). On the other
hand, patients with dengue exposure may present with
severe disease, often in secondary heterologous infec-
tions,
a
condition
attributed
to
antibody-mediated
immune enhancement and activation of cross-reactive
memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (26). In the absence of
available antiviral drugs against DENV infection, treat-
ment for these patients consists primarily of supportive
care, including bed rest, antipyretics, analgesics, and
urgent resuscitation with intravenous fluids to replace
lost intravascular volume in cases of SD (28), a critical
measure to reduce mortality of disease. Patients with
clinical signs and epidemiological history compatible with
viral disease and in regions where other arboviruses,
such as dengue, are endemic should be tested for ZIKV
and DENV infections.
The diagnosis of ZIKV must be determined by molecular
testing generally within the first week of onset of symp-
toms but might be considered in any SOTr with a com-
patible syndrome and potential exposures, given the
limited knowledge of the course and duration of ZIKV vir-
emia in immunosuppressed patients, which might be
prolonged. Such assays are not available in all areas;
newer assays are under investigation. Cross-reactivity
between flavivirus antibodies and/or antigens may lead
to the erroneous diagnoses. Positive serology by detec-
tion of NS1 and anti-dengue IgM in nonrecipient of SOT
dengue-suspected patients but with detected ZIKV infec-
tion by RT-PCR have already been reported (24). It is also
essential to consider other modes of ZIKV infection, such
as blood transfusion (10), donor-derived infection, or
postoperative infection. A review of the donor epide-
miological data is essential to prevent donor-derived
infections, including travel history, presence of signs/
symptoms of ZIKV infection, and place of residence
regarding areas of arbovirus transmission. Such data are
not routinely available in our area. Laboratory screening
for ZIKV in transplant donors is challenging as ZIKV vire-
mia detection by RT-PCR demands a qualified reference
laboratory, while serologic screening may not reflect the
true risk of transmission (29). After these preliminary ret-
rospective results, our protocols to screen potential
transplant recipients and donors have been reviewed.
For transplant recipients, we suggest performing PCR for
DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in serum to detect asymp-
tomatic or mild infection. Donor screening is dependent
on the government organ allocation system and availabil-
ity of serum from them. PCR for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV
in serum may be performed, as well as PCR for ZIKV in
urine, especially in kidney donors, to detect potential kid-
ney impairment.
This study describes clinical and laboratory data observed
in four cases of SOTr infected by ZIKV and highlights the
need to better understand the ZIKV clinical spectrum in
immunocompromised hosts, including SOTr, the factors
that may affect the clinical presentation, molecular and
serologic diagnostic testing, and the differential diagnosis
of disease.
