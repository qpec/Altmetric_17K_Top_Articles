Variation in telomere length is heritable and is currently considered a promising biomarker of susceptibility for neuropsychiatric disorders,
particularly because of its association with memory function and hippocampal morphology. Here, we investigate telomere length in
connection to familial risk and disease expression in bipolar disorder (BD). We used quantitative PCRs and a telomere-sequence to
single-copy-gene-sequence ratio method to determine telomere length in genomic DNA extracted from buccal smears from 63 patients
with BD, 74 first-degree relatives (49 relatives had no lifetime psychopathology and 25 had a non-BD mood disorder), and 80 unrelated
healthy individuals. Participants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging to determine hippocampal volumes and cognitive assessment
to evaluate episodic memory using the verbal paired associates test. Telomere length was shorter in psychiatrically well relatives (p = 0.007)
compared with unrelated healthy participants. Telomere length was also shorter in relatives (regardless of psychiatric status; po0.01) and
patients with BD not on lithium (p = 0.02) compared with lithium-treated patients with BD. In the entire sample, telomere length was
positively associated with left and right hippocampal volume and with delayed recall. This study provides evidence that shortened telomere
length is associated with familial risk for BD. Lithium may have neuroprotective properties that require further investigation using
prospective designs.

INTRODUCTION
Telomeres are DNA repeat structures (TTAGGG) at the end
of each chromosome that undergo shortening during mitosis
(Allsop et al, 1992; Stewart et al, 2012). Telomere shortening
has been associated with exposure to cellular stressors
(Saretzki and Von Zglinicki, 2002), lifestyle factors (Valdes
et al, 2005), and social adversity (Epel et al, 2004; Gianaros
et al, 2007; Shalev et al, 2013), whereas telomerase, an
enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats (TTAGGG) onto
the 3′ telomeric end, may reverse or mitigate this process
(Allsop et al, 1992; Stewart et al, 2012). Cell senescence or
cell death is triggered when a critically short telomere length
is reached (Stewart et al, 2012). Telomere length is therefore
considered a promising biomarker of biological aging and
susceptibility to disease (Calado and Young, 2009; Heidinger
et al, 2011).
The relationship between telomere length and psychiatric
disorders is a topic of much interest but also uncertainty
(Eitan et al, 2014). Previous studies have reported shortened
peripheral telomere length in major depressive disorder
(MDD) (Verhoeven et al, 2016; Hartmann et al, 2010; Lung
et al, 2007), schizophrenia (SCZ) (Yu et al, 2008), as well as
different forms of dementia (Mouiha et al, 2011; Rabinovici
et al, 2007). In bipolar disorder (BD), individual studies have
reported both reduced (Barbé-Tuana et al, 2016; Lima et al,
2015) and increased telomere length in patients compared
with unrelated healthy individuals (Martinsson et al, 2013;
Simon et al, 2006). The heterogeneity of the primary studies
is reflected in recent meta-analyses that either failed to find
an effect of diagnosis (Colpo et al, 2015) or reported a small
effect (Darrow et al, 2016). In post-mortem brain tissue,
decreased telomere length has been found in the hippocam-
pus of patients with SCZ, BD, and MDD, suggesting that
telomere shortening may be more relevant or pronounced in
this brain region (Mamdani et al, 2015).
Telomere length is associated with brain morphology,
particularly the hippocampus (King et al, 2014; Nilsonne
et al, 2015), a brain region that appears vulnerable to
multiple disease mechanisms (Hibar et al, 2016; Rabinovici
et al, 2007; Schmaal et al, 2016; van Erp et al, 2016; Mouiha
et al, 2011) that is also capable of neurogenesis (Barnes et al,
2009; Spalding et al, 2013). Telomere length is also associated
with memory function (Valdes et al, 2010) including episodic
memory that is closely linked to hippocampal function
(Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2010; Kühn and Gallinat, 2014;
Van Petten, 2004). Telomere shortening may therefore

 represent a common biological mechanism linking hippo-
campal abnormalities and deficits in episodic memory, both
of which have been consistently reported in psychiatric
disorders (Bora et al, 2009, 2013; Bourne et al, 2013;
Lim et al, 2013; Szöke et al, 2008).
In the case of BD, psychotropic treatment may influence
telomere length. There is convincing evidence that patients
on long-term lithium treatment have longer telomeres
(Martinsson et al, 2013; Squassina et al, 2016), whereas the
case
regarding
antidepressants
remains
equivocal
(Verhoeven et al, 2017; Bersani et al, 2015; Soeiro-de-Souza
et al, 2014). The relationship between telomere length and
BD is therefore complex, implicating both disease- and
treatment-related mechanisms. One way to disentangle these
effects is to examine first-degree relatives of patients, as
telomere length shows high heritability (Slagboom et al,
1994). Accordingly, we examined telomere length in remitted
patients with BD, first-degree relatives of patients, and
unrelated
healthy
comparison
individuals.
We
further
investigated the effect of psychotropic treatment on telomere
length and the association between telomere length with
hippocampal volume and episodic memory.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Buccal DNA was available from 217 individuals of white
British ancestry who had participated in the Vulnerability to
Bipolar Disorders Study (VIBES), described previously
(Delvecchio et al, 2015; Dima et al, 2013, 2016; Forcada
et al, 2011; Frangou, 2009,2011; Jogia et al, 2011, 2012;
Kempton et al, 2009; Lelli-Chiesa et al, 2011; Perrier et al,
2011; Pompei et al, 2011a, b; Ruberto et al, 2011; Takahashi
et al, 2010). The VIBES sample includes (1) patients who
fulfill criteria for BD-I based on the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, revised (DSM-IV)
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994) (2) first-degree
relatives and, (3) unrelated healthy individuals without a
personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. Patients
and relatives were screened to exclude pedigrees with
schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Exclu-
sion criteria for all participants were current and hereditary
neurological disorders, DSM-IV lifetime drug or alcohol
dependence or drug or alcohol abuse in the preceding
6 months, and contraindications to magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Trained psychiatrists and clinical psychol-
ogists respectively conducted clinical interviews and cogni-
tive assessments. Diagnostic assessments were based on the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders (First
et al, 2002a, b) and psychopathology was rated using the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton, 1960)
and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; Young et al,
1978). The study received institutional ethical approval. All
individuals
provided
written
informed
consent
before
participation.
The study sample comprised 63 patients with BD, 74 first-
degree relatives (siblings = 35; offspring = 39), and 80 un-
related healthy volunteers (Table 1 and Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2); 27 patients with BD and 8 relatives were
unrelated to any other participant in the database. Of the
first-degree relatives, 21 had a lifetime diagnosis of MDD and
4 of Anxiety Disorders (Supplementary Table S1). All
participants with psychiatric diagnoses were in remission
at the time of study enrolment defined as a HDRS and YMRS
score below 7 (Table 1), in accordance with the criteria set by
the task force of International Society for Bipolar Disorders
(Tohen et al, 2009). All but 4 patients with BD were
medicated as detailed in Table 1. In addition, 15 of the 25
relatives with non-BD psychiatric diagnoses were prescribed
antidepressants as monotherapy at the time of study
participation (Table 1). Relatives with non-BD diagnoses
who were not on treatment had been either medication naive
(n = 7) or had not received any psychotropic treatment for
41 year.
Cognitive Assessment
In all participants, an estimate of general intellectual ability
was obtained using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-
Revised (Wechsler, 1981) and episodic memory was assessed
using verbal paired associates (VPA) test from the Wechsler
Memory Scale-Third Edition (Wechsler, 1997). This is the
most
widely
used
instrument
for
the
assessment
of
hippocampus-linked memory (Van Petten, 2004). Scaled
scores for VPA-immediate and VPA-delayed recall were
used in the analyses.
Determination of telomere length.
Buccal
DNA
was
extracted using a standardized procedure (Freeman et al,
2003). DNA samples had good purity ratios (260/280 ratios
between 1.7 and 1.9), as measured using the Nanodrop,
ND1000 (Thermoscientific, Wilmington, DE). Telomere
length was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR) assays as previously described (Cawthon, 2009;
Vincent et al, 2017) performed on the ABI Prism 7900HT
Sequence Detection System, with the output generated using
SDS Software version 2 (details in Supplementary Material
and Supplemental Figure S1). Telomere lengths are reported
as relative ratios of the copy number of telomere DNA
(TTAGGG) to a single-copy gene (albumin). The telomere
length was normally distributed in the entire sample
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov p = 0.09). Eleven specimens were
excluded because they either failed quality control (n = 4)
or were identified as outliers (n = 7) (telomere length 42
SD). The telomere length was negatively associated with age
in the entire sample (β = − 0.18; t = − 2.72; p = 0.007) but not
with sex (β = 0.07; t = 1.09; p = 0.29). Further analyses
showed that the regression slopes were not statistically
different
by
sex
or
diagnostic
group
as
detailed
in
Supplementary Material (Supplementary Figure S2 and
Supplementary Tables S3–S5). Following linear regression
of age and sex, the standardized residuals of the telomere
length, referred to as age- and sex-adjusted telomere length,
were used in most downstream analyses.
MR Imaging
High-resolution T1-weighted whole-brain MR images were
obtained on a GE Signa HD 1.5T MR imaging system using an
inversion recovery prepared, spoiled gradient-echo sequence.
Whole-brain coverage was obtained in axial orientation with
slice thickness of 1.5 mm, repetition time of 18 ms, echo time
of 5.1 ms, flip angle of 20°, field of view = 240 × 180 mm, and
voxel
dimensions = 0.9375 × 0.9375 × 1.5 mm.

 preprocessing, we used FreeSurfer, version 5.3.0 (http://surfer.
nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), a widely used and validated software,
to segment and respectively quantify total intracranial and left
and right hippocampal volume. Segmented regions were
visually inspected and statistically evaluated for outliers.
Statistical Analysis
Group differences were examined using analysis of variance
(followed by post hoc tests) and independent t-tests, as
appropriate. Family membership was modeled as a repeated
measure. Bivariate associations were assessed using Spear-
man’s correlation coefficient and regression analyses were
used to model the contribution of multiple predictors. We
first examined the effect of potential confounders, namely
medication in patients and the relatives and the effect of
psychiatric status (with regard to non-BD diagnoses) in the
relatives to determine the number of groups and variables to
be considered. Analyses were performed in SPSS (Version
22, IBM, New York, NY).
RESULTS
Examination of Confounders
Telomere length and medication in patients with BD.
Details on medication are shown in Table 1. In patients with
BD, the mean duration of treatment with lithium was 3.8
years (range: 6 months to 40 years) and the mean dose was
904 mg (range 600–1200 mg). Lithium dose and treatment
duration did not correlate with telomere length (p40.13).
Lithium treatment status was not associated with differences
in age of onset, or HDRS and YMRS scores (p40.94). Only
four patients with BD who were not on current treatment
with lithium had been prescribed this medication at some
point in the past.
We then examined the effect of medication (on lithium vs
not on lithium, on antidepressants vs not on antidepressants;
typical antipsychotic, atypical antipsychotic, none; carbama-
zepine, lamotrigine, sodium valproate, none) on age- and
sex-adjusted telomere length in patients with BD. We first
tested the effect of each individual class and then considered
all classes together. Treatment with lithium was associated
with longer telomeres (t60 = − 2.24, p = 0.03). We found no
effect of antidepressants (t60 = 1.13, p = 0.16), antipsychotics
(F2, 60 = 0.57,
p = 0.57),
or
anticonvulsants
(F3, 60 = 1.69,
p = 0.15). When all medications and their interactions were
considered, there was still an overall effect of lithium
(F1 = 4.01, p = 0.04), but the main effects and interactions
with the other medication classes were not significant
(p40.22).
Telomere length and medication in relatives of patients
with BD.
Relatives had only been exposed to antidepres-
sants. A multiple regression analysis did not support an
association between telomere length and antidepressant
treatment (β = − 0.02, t = − 0.33; p = 0.73) in relatives; in the
same model we found a significant association with age
(β = − 0.19, t = − 2.37; p = 0.01) but not sex (β = 0.10, t = 1.32;
p = 0.18). Moreover, age-and sex-adjusted telomere length
did not differ between relatives based on their antidepressant
exposure (F1, 63 = 1.79, p = 0.18). Further analyses on the
association between antidepressants and telomere length can
be found in Supplementary Material.
Telomere length and psychiatric status in relatives of
patients with BD.
Age- and sex-adjusted telomere length
differed between relatives with psychiatric diagnoses, psychia-
trically well relatives, and healthy volunteers (F2, 154= 4.24,
p = 0.01). The post hoc Bonferroni corrected pairwise tests
showed
that
healthy
relatives
had
significantly
shorter
telomere length than healthy volunteers (p = 0.02), whereas
no other pairwise comparison was significant (p40.20).
Primary Analyses
Having established which confounders were relevant, we
proceeded to carry out a series of hypothesis-driven analyses.
Telomere length in patients with BD and first-degree
relatives.
Based on the results above we considered five
groups in our final analysis, namely, unrelated healthy
participants, psychiatrically well relatives, relatives with
psychiatric diagnoses, patients with BD on lithium, and
patients with BD not on lithium. We found an overall effect
of
group
on
age-
and
sex-adjusted
telomere
length
(F4, 217 = 3.79, p = 0.005). The post hoc Bonferroni corrected
pairwise tests showed that compared with unrelated healthy
participants, telomere length was shorter in psychiatrically
well relatives (p = 0.007; Figure 1) and relatives with
psychiatric diagnoses, although at nominal statistical sig-
nificance (p = 0.07). Lithium-treated patients with BD had
longer telomere length compared with psychiatrically well
relatives (p = 0.001), relatives with psychiatric diagnoses
(p = 0.01), and patients with BD not on lithium (p = 0.02);
all other pairwise comparisons were not significant.
Telomere length and hippocampal volume.
The mean and
SD of the hippocampal volumes are shown in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S10. There was no effect of group
(ie, healthy volunteers, psychiatrically well relatives, relatives
with psychiatric diagnoses, patients with BD on lithium,
Figure 1
Scatterplot showing the distribution of adjusted telomere length
in the study sample. Compared with unrelated healthy individuals, age- and
sex-adjusted telomere length was shorter in psychiatrically well relatives and
in relatives with psychiatric diagnoses relative to controls (p = 0.07; not
shown in figure). Lithium-treated patients with BD had longer telomere
length compared with relatives, regardless of psychiatric status, and patients
with BD not on lithium.

age
(F1, 162 = 0.59, p = 0.44) but a significant effect of sex
(F1, 162 = 4.48, p = 0.03). There was no significant effect of
group on hippocampal volumes (left F4, 173 = 0.81, p = 0.51;
right F4, 173 = 1.59, p = 0.17); the effects of age and sex were
significant (po0.001) but not the group × sex × age interac-
tion (p40.50). We found no significant correlation between
hippocampal volumes and lithium dose or duration of
lithium treatment (p40.14) in patients with BD; we found
no significant correlation between hippocampal volumes and
antidepressant treatment in patients with BD or relatives
(p40.14).
We found no difference in the slopes between telomere
length and left and right hippocampal volumes with respect
to
group
(Supplementary
Figures
S3
and
S4
and
Supplementary Tables S6 and S7) or sex (Supplementary
Figures S5 and S6 and Supplementary Tables S8 and S9).
Telomere length explained a substantial amount of the
variance of the left (adjusted R2 = 0.21, β = 0.46, po0.001,
95% confidence intervals: 0.32–0.58) and right (adjusted
R2 = 0.22, β = 0.47, po0.001, 95% confidence intervals:
0.31–0.56) hippocampal volume (Figure 2).

significant
effect
of
group
on
VPA-immediate
recall
(F4, 184 = 2.59, p = 0.04). Nonlithium-treated patients with
BD (p = 0.008) and relatives with psychiatric diagnoses
performed worse than healthy volunteers (p = 0.05). Simi-
larly, there was a significant main effect of group on VPA-
delayed recall (F4, 184 = 8.51, po0.001). Compared with
unrelated healthy volunteers, delayed recall was reduced in
psychiatrically
well
relatives
(po0.001),
relatives
with
psychiatric diagnoses (po0.001), and nonlithium-treated
patients with BD (p = 0.05).
We found no difference in the slopes between telomere
length and VPA-immediate and VPA-delayed recall with
respect to group (Supplementary Figures S7 and S9 and
Supplementary Tables S11 and S13) or sex (Supplementary
Figures S8 and S10 and Supplementary Tables S12 and S14).
Telomere length explained a nonsignificant amount of the
variance in VPA-immediate recall (adjusted R2 = 0.004;
β = 0.09; p = 0.19, 95% confidence intervals: − 0.26, 1.31).
Telomere explained a small but significant amount of the
variance for VPA-delayed recall (adjusted R2 = 0.02 0;
β = 0.14, p = 0.05; 95% confidence intervals: − 0.003, 1.25)
(Figure 2).
Telomere length and clinical features.
We examined
correlations between age- and sex-adjusted telomere length
and severity of manic and depressive psychopathology,
number of episodes (total, manic, depressive, mixed), and
age of onset. None was significant (ρo0.15, p40.10).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to date to demonstrate a link between
shorter telomere length and familial risk for BD. Lithium
treatment was associated with telomere length such that
patients on long-term lithium treatment had longer telo-
meres compared with relatives and patients with BD who
were not treated with lithium. In the entire sample, telomere
length was also associated with larger hippocampal volume
and better episodic memory.
Our results suggest that shorter telomere length may be a
common factor linking genetic liability to BD to multisystem
disorder vulnerability. Shorter telomeres have been asso-
ciated with multiple adverse health outcomes, primarily
cardiovascular disease (Brouilette et al, 2003; D’Mello et al,
2015; Fitzpatrick et al, 2007; O’Donnell et al, 2008), type 2
diabetes (O’Donnell et al, 2008), age-related cognitive
dysfunction (Yaffe et al, 2011), and dementia (Panossian
et al, 2003; Thomas et al, 2008). Comorbidities such as
hypertension, elevated lipids, poor glycemic control, and
diabetes type 2 are more prevalent in patients with BD
compared with the general population (Beyer et al, 2005;
Czepielewski et al, 2013; Fiedorowicz et al, 2010; Forty et al,
2014; McIntyre et al, 2006, 2010; Smith et al, 2013). Although
psychotropic medication may contribute to physical mor-
bidity, cardiometabolic disturbances in patients with BD
have been observed independent of medication exposure
(Maina et al, 2008; Regenold et al, 2002). Medical morbidity
in relatives of patients with BD is understudied, but
according to a recent study, 26% of first-degree relatives of
patients with BD self-reported a cardiometabolic disorder as
compared with 13% of individuals without a family history
of psychiatric disorders (Mothi et al, 2015). Patients with BD
are also at greater risk of developing dementia later in life
compared
with
patients

nonpsychiatric
disorders

 (da Silva et al, 2013; Kessing and Nilsson, 2003) but this
association has not been examined in first-degree relatives.
Telomere length was shorter in first-degree relatives
compared with unrelated healthy comparison individuals,
potentially reflecting the cumulative lifetime burdens of
genetic and environmental exposures. Although shorter
telomere length has been linked to insufficient telomerase
activity (Blackburn, 1991; Lu et al, 2013), large population-
based studies suggest individuals with shorter telomeres
(Epel et al, 2008; Farzaneh-Far et al, 2010), including those
individual experiencing significant distress (Damjanovic
et al, 2007), may have upregulated telomerase that maintains
telomere length. Telomerase activity has not been assessed in
individuals with familial risk for BD, but in patients longer
telomere length has been associated with lithium-induced
increase in telomerase activity (Martinsson et al, 2013; Wei
et al, 2015; Squassina et al, 2016). Alternatively, longer
telomere length in BD may be predictive of good lithium
response and hence long-term lithium treatment. The cross-
sectional nature of the current study does not allow us to
resolve the direction of causality. We did not find evidence
that antidepressants influence telomere length in patients
with BD or their relatives, consistent with the lack of such an
association reported in larger studies (Verhoeven et al, 2017).
We confirmed previously reported associations between
telomere length, hippocampal volume (King et al, 2014;
Nilsonne et al, 2015), and episodic memory (Valdes et al,
2005) that support the notion that telomere length is a
marker of hippocampal vulnerability linked to reduced cell
proliferation potential (Wolkowitz et al, 2015). Reduction in
proliferative potential is likely to affect primarily cells capable
of division in the adult brain; these would include neural
stem cells located in the dentate gyrus (Gage et al, 1995;
Palmer et al, 1997) and other cells that support neuronal
function (eg, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and
pericytes). In preclinical studies, telomerase induction has
been shown to reverse tissue degeneration (Jaskelioff et al,
2011; Shingu et al, 2015) and restore proliferative potential of
neuronal progenitor cells (Jaskelioff et al, 2011) that may
account for the association between lithium treatment and
decreased risk of developing dementia in patients with BD
(da Silva et al, 2013; Kessing et al, 2008).
There are several methodological considerations pertinent
to this study. Telomere length was ascertained from buccal
rather than brain tissue. However, previous studies have
found that this is an acceptable surrogate as genetic
influences on the regulation of telomere length appear tissue
independent (Dlouha et al, 2014; Friedrich et al, 2000). We
conducted a number of analyses to estimate and subse-
quently model the contribution of potential confounding (eg,
medication) and moderating variables (eg, age). No correc-
tion for multiple comparisons was applied to these analyses
as the intention was to identify all potential sources of
variance in this data set and account for them in hypothesis
testing. The results of our hypothesis-driven analyses survive
Bonferroni correction. Medication adherence was based on
participants’ self-report. We considered these reports largely
valid given that patients had remained on their prescribed
medication for long periods and were in remission at study
entry. As telomere length changes over time, longitudinal
designs are critical in delineating the trajectories of change.
However,
general
population
samples
have
found
no
evidence of accelerated telomere shortening over follow-up
periods of 5–10 years in people with depression or anxiety
disorders (Hoen et al, 2011; Verhoeven et al, 2016, 2017).
Telomere shortening has been associated with adversity
(Epel et al, 2004; Gianaros et al, 2007; Shalev et al, 2013),
oxidative
stress
and
inflammation
(Masi
et
al,
2012;
O'Donovan et al, 2011; Saretzki and Von Zglinicki, 2002),
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Demissie et al, 2006),
obesity, and smoking (Valdes et al, 2005). In addition,
telomere length may also be influenced by other genetic risk
factors for BD. Examination of the complex interface
between these factors, telomere length, and BD in long-
itudinal studies will further enrich our understanding of the
biological mechanisms involved.
To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence
linking telomere length to familial propensity to BD. An
increased understanding of telomere biology may lead to
potential therapeutic interventions to maintain telomere
length or reverse telomere attrition. In clinical practice, it
would be advisable to target modifiable risk factors such as
smoking, obesity, and stress and promote protective factors
relating to healthy lifestyle and physical activity (Cherkas
et al, 2008). Furthermore, targeting telomerase or other
associated proteins may provide novel pharmacological
targets
that
could
address
both
mental
and
physical
morbidity in those predisposed to or suffering from BD.
