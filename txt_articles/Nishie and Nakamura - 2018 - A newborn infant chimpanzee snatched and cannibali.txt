A newborn infant chimpanzee snatched and cannibalized immediately

Abstract: 
Objectives: This study reports on the first observed case of a wild chimpanzee infant 
being snatched immediately after delivery and consequently cannibalized by an adult 
male in the Mahale Mountains, Tanzania. We demonstrate “maternity leave” from long-
term data from the Mahale M group and suggest that it functions as a possible 
counterstrategy of mother chimpanzees against the risk of infanticide soon after delivery. 
Materials and methods: The subjects of this study were the M group chimpanzees at 
Mahale Mountains, Tanzania. The case of cannibalism was observed on December 2, 
2014. We used the long-term daily attendance record of the M group chimpanzees 
between 1990 and 2010 to calculate the lengths of “maternity leave,” a perinatal period 
during which a mother chimpanzee tends to hide herself and gives birth alone. 
Results: We observed a very rare case of delivery in a wild chimpanzee group. A female 
chimpanzee gave birth in front of other members, and an adult male snatched and 
cannibalized the newborn infant immediately after birth. Using the long-term data, we 
demonstrate that the length of “maternity leave” is longer than that of nonmaternity leave 
among adult and adolescent female chimpanzees. 
Discussion: We argue that this cannibalism event immediately after birth occurred due to 
the complete lack of “maternity leave” of the mother chimpanzee of the victim, who might 
lack enough experience of delivery. We suggest that “maternity leave” taken by expecting 
mothers may function as a possible counterstrategy against infanticide soon after delivery.

 An infant chimpanzee eaten soon after birth 
2 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Infanticide by males has been observed in many primate 
species (Palombit, 2012) and has been explained 
mainly in terms of male reproductive strategy known as 
the sexual selection hypothesis (Hrdy,1974): males kill 
unrelated infants; infanticide makes the mother resume 
cycling quickly; and infanticidal males increase their 
probability of siring subsequent infants after the 
infanticide. Among wild chimpanzees, researchers have 
reported intragroup infanticide 45 times in nine 
different groups within six populations (Wilson et al., 
2014); however, infanticide immediately after delivery 
has never been observed because of the rarity of 
observed delivery in the wild (Fujisawa, Hockings, 
Soumah, & Matsuzawa, 2016; Goodall & Athumani, 
1980; Kiwede, 2000; Zamma, Sakamaki, & Kitopeni, 
2012). This rarity of observed delivery among wild 
chimpanzees has been believed to derive from 
“maternity leave” (Nishida, Takasaki, & Takahata, 
1990), a perinatal period during which a mother 
chimpanzee tends to hide herself and gives birth alone. 
“Maternity leave” was first described at Mahale 
(Nishida et al., 1990), but has only been analyzed 
quantitatively at Gombe (Pusey et al., 2008). Pusey et 
al. (2008) suggested that maternity leave functions as a 
female counterstrategy to reduce the risk of infanticide 
around the time of parturition. 
While incidents of infanticide in most primate 
species are largely consistent with the sexual selection 
hypothesis, the circumstances of infanticide in wild 
chimpanzees are diverse and not entirely consistent 
with it (Palombit, 2012; Watts & Mitani, 2000). 
Alternative hypotheses have also been discussed as 
adaptive explanation of infanticide committed by male 
chimpanzees. The nutritional benefit hypothesis 
assumes that infanticide benefits the attacker(s) with 
important nutrients through cannibalism, which has 
occurred in most instances after infanticide among wild 
chimpanzees (Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, 1992). The resource 
competition hypothesis assumes that the attacker(s) 
reduce resource (mating) competition by eliminating 
unrelated male infants as possible future competitors 
(Nishida & Kawanaka, 1985; Takahata, 1985). The 
sexual coercion hypothesis predicts that the attacker 
male(s) can coerce the mother female to mate more 
restrictively with them by killing her offspring (Arcadi 
& Wrangham, 1999; Hamai, Nishida, Takasaki, & 
Turner, 1992). Here, we show the first observed case of 
a wild chimpanzee infant being snatched immediately 
after delivery and consequently cannibalized by an 
adult male in the Mahale Mountains, Tanzania. We 
hypothesize that the complete lack of “maternity leave” 
can be a reason for this rare incident. This study also 
demonstrates “maternity leave” from long-term data 
from the Mahale M group and suggests that it functions 
as a possible counterstrategy of mother chimpanzees 
against the risk of infanticide soon after delivery. 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
2.1. Study site and subjects 
The Mahale Mountains National Park (6°15′S, 
29°55′E) is situated on the eastern shore of Lake 
Tanganyika in Tanzania at an altitude of approximately 
780–2,400 m. The study site (Kasoje area, the home 
range of the M group chimpanzees) is located in the 
northwestern part of the park at an altitude of 
approximately 780–1,300 m and has an annual rainfall 
of approximately 1,700 mm. The area is dominated by 
semi-deciduous forest with small patches of woodland 
and secondary forest distributed in a mosaic pattern. 
The M group chimpanzees at Mahale have been 
studied continuously since 1968. It had 84 members in 
1990; the total decreased to 45 in the mid-1990s, but 
subsequently increased. At the time of obser- vations 
reported here (2014), it had 60 members, including 10 
adult males (16 years ≤) and 20 adult females (13 years 
≤). 
Devota, the mother of the victim infant, had 
immigrated into the M group in 2012 and was estimated 
to be 14 years of age at the time of the reported case in 
2014. This case was presumably her first delivery, as 
she had not been observed to give birth since she had 
immigrated. Darwin, the male who snatched and ate the 
infant, was born in the M group in 1988 and was 25 
years of age in 2014. He was the second- or third-
ranking male at the time. 
 
2.2. Analysis of “maternity leave” 
To determine whether expecting mother chimpanzees 
isolated themselves from other members during the 
perinatal period, we counted the inter-sighting intervals 
for new mothers (“maternity interval”) and for all other 
adult or adolescent females (“nonmaternity interval”). 
From the daily attendance record of the M group 
chimpanzees from 1990 to 2010 (21-year period), we 
extracted 94 births to 36 females (one each to 12 
females and 2–7 to 24 females). “Maternity interval” 
was counted as the number of each mother’s absent 
days before the first appearance with her newborn 
infant. “Nonmaternity interval” was similarly counted 
as the number of absent days of all other adult or 
adolescent (9–12 years) females who were observed on 
the same day of the mother’s first appearance with the 
newborn infant. The definition of “nonmaternity 
interval” in this study is different from that of Pusey et 
al. (2008), because the inter-sighting interval may well 
 An infant chimpanzee eaten soon after birth

be affected with the seasonal fluctuation of party size at 
Mahale (Itoh & Nishida, 2007). To evaluate the effect 
of delivery on the length of inter-sighting intervals, we 
used a GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects 
model) with gamma distribution and log link function, 
using the glmmADMB package (Fournier et al., 2012; 
Skaug, Fournier, Bolker, Magnusson, & Nielsen, 2016) 
implemented for the statistical software R ver. 3.3.0 (R 
Core 
Team, 
2016). 
At 
Mahale, 
the 
overall 
gregariousness of chimpanzees largely changes with the 
availability of main fruit food, especially Saba (Itoh & 
Nishida, 2007), which enables researchers to divide a 
year into two seasons: the gathering season, roughly 
from August to January, and the dispersing season, from 
February to July. In the former, most of the group 
members gather together, making the length of inter- 
sighting interval shorter, while in the latter, they split 
into many small parties, making the inter-sighting 
interval longer (Nakamura, 2015). Therefore, we set the 
length of inter-sighting interval (days) as the response 
variable, the status of each inter-sighting interval (2 
levels: maternity or nonmaternity interval) and the 
season in which each birth event occurred (2 levels: 
gathering season: August–January, dispersing season: 
February–July) as fixed effects, and each female ID (n 
= 71) and each birth event ID (n = 94) as random effects. 
We used the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) for 
model selection. We calculated AIC values for all the 
possible models with or without the explanatory 
variables, and the model that yielded the smallest AIC 
value was selected as the best model to predict the 
length of inter-sighting interval. We conducted 
Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the length of 
maternity interval of primiparous females with that of 
multiparous females. Primiparous females here were 
defined as those who had not previously been observed, 
by the researchers, to have infants. 
 
3. RESULTS 
 
3.1. The case of cannibalism 
On December 2, 2014 at 11:01, HN and an assistant 
located a party of 21 chimpanzees, including 4 adult 
males (Primus, the alpha male; Carter; Bonobo; Caesar) 
and 10 adult females. Devota, who would give birth 
soon after that, was included in the party; however, at 
this stage, we did not notice any obvious signs that she 
would give birth, such as pushing her hand into vagina 
or discharging amniotic fluid prior to delivery described 
in previous studies (Goodall & Athumani, 1980; 
Kiwede, 2000; Zamma et al., 2012). At 11:28, the 
assistant who was sitting approximately 20 m from HN 
witnessed Devota crouching down and suddenly giving 
birth on the ground. Immediately after the delivery, 
Darwin, a dominant adult male who was sitting behind 
Devota, picked up the newborn infant and rushed into 
the bush. Therefore, Devota did not even have the 
opportunity to touch the infant. The entire incident 
occurred very rapidly; therefore, we could not confirm 
whether a live-birth or stillbirth had occurred or even 
the sex of the infant. Approximately 30 s later, when 
HN arrived at the position where Devota had given birth, 
a placenta with umbilical cord remained on the ground, 
following which Effie, an adult female, picked up the 
placenta and climbed a nearby tree. 
Effie held the placenta for a while, but never ate it, 
although she occasionally licked her hand holding the 
placenta. At 12:08, Darwin reappeared holding the 
infant under the tree where Effie sat on a branch (Figure 
1). Slight bleeding was observed on the infant’s nostril 
and its entire body was inactive; however, we could not 
confirm whether it was dead or still alive. The body of 
the infant at that time remained intact. Although HN 
managed to take some photographs, the heavy rain and 
darkness at that time prevented a better view of the 
infant, and we could not confirm the sex of the infant. 
Approximately 30 s later, Darwin holding the infant 
once again rushed into the dense bush, after which we 
soon lost sight of him. When we located Darwin again 
sitting on a tree at a height of approximately 15 m at 
12:57, he had already started eating the infant from the 
lower half of its body. Darwin ate the infant alone on a 
branch, whereas some adult females and adolescent 
males were observing Darwin on the same tree, several 
to 10 m away. 
Between 13:32 and 13:38, Xantip, an adult female, 
and Azam, an adolescent male, picked up and ate some 
pieces of meat or bones falling from the branch where 
Darwin was positioned. An adolescent female, Genie, 
approached Darwin and tore a small piece of meat from 
the body of the infant held by Darwin; however, he 
showed no reaction. At 13:43, Bonobo, an adult male, 
approached Darwin and peered at the body held by 
Darwin; however, Bonobo did not attempt to touch the 
body and soon moved away. 
By 13:57, Darwin had finished eating the body of 
the infant. At 14:29, we witnessed Ichiro, an adolescent 
male, carrying the placenta which Effie had been 
carrying, but the placenta remained uneaten. After a 
while, when we once again observed Ichiro, he no 
longer had the placenta, and we could not locate it 
subsequently. 
On December 3, the following day, we located 
Darwin at 11:30 and followed him throughout the day. 
As Darwin had severe diarrhea, we could not locate any 
bones or hairs of the infant in his feces.

3.2. Length of “maternity leave” 
The summary of the length of inter-sighting interval is 
presented in Table 1. We constructed GLMMs to verify 
whether expecting mother chimpanzees generally tend 
to hide themselves during the perinatal period. The AIC 
values and the parameter estimates (±SE) for all 
possible models are shown in Table 2. The full model, 
including both the type of interval and the season of 
birth, predicted the length of inter-sighting interval best 
(AIC = 5841.4). Maternity intervals were longer than 
nonmaternity intervals, and intervals were shorter 
during the gathering season than during the dispersing 
season (β0 = 0.917 ± 0.131, βmaternity = 1.346 ± 0.083, 
βdispersing = 1.144 ± 0.154; Figure 2). This is consistent 
with the hypothesis that new mothers take “maternity 
leave.” The length of perinatal absence did not differ 
significantly between primiparous and multiparous 
females (Wilcoxon rank sum test, nprimiparous = 20, 
nmultiparous = 74, z = –0.005, p = .996).

4. DISCUSSION 
 
The “sexual selection hypothesis” seems consistent 
with this case, as it is unlikely that Darwin have 
fathered the Devota’s infant. Devota might have 
conceived during April or May 2014 (estimated 
duration of gestation in wild chimpanzees: 208–235 
d) (Wallis, 1997), though we did not observe any 
copulations of Devota during this period. Because 
Darwin had not been observed at all for an 
extraordinarily long duration between January 29 and 
June 5, 2014, including the Devota’s estimated 
conception period, we assumed that he had been ill 
and could not range with other chimpanzees. 
Nevertheless, the possibility of Darwin being the 
father cannot completely be ruled out as we did not 
observe Devota during all the possible days of 
conception and it is possible that she somehow met 
and copulated with Darwin during those days. In 
addition, because we could not collect any tissue 
samples from the infant, it was not possible to 
conduct a DNA analysis to confirm the paternity. 
Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the sexual 
selection hypothesis can simply be applicable to this 
case. 
We also lack enough evidence for testing 
alternative hypotheses of infanticide. The nutritional 
benefit hypothesis seems partly applicable, since 
Darwin consumed the most part of the infant, 
although severe diarrhea might reduce the benefit. 
The resource competition hypothesis cannot be tested 
because we have no data on the sex of the victim and 
the relatedness between Darwin and the infant. The 
sexual coercion hypothesis may also be possible; 
however, we have few copulation data between 
Darwin and Devota before/after the infanticide and 
thus cannot test it. 
We could not confirm whether the infant was alive 
 An infant chimpanzee eaten soon after birth

because Darwin snatched and ate the newborn 
immediately after birth. If this was a stillbirth, it was 
not Darwin who killed the infant; thus, there is a 
possibility that this case might not be a true case of 
infanticide. 
We argue that the rarity of similar observations to 
this case is largely because of the rare chance to 
observe delivery among wild chimpanzees. Females 
tend to hide themselves during the perinatal period, 
termed “maternity leave,” that is considered to be a 
possible 
female 
counterstrategy 
against 
male 
infanticide (Palombit, 2012). Devota’s delivery in 
front of many other chimpanzees including adult 
males might have induced, or at least increased the 
risk of the subsequent suspected infanticide and 
cannibalism. 
For “maternity leave” to work as a counterstrategy 
against infanticide, it is particularly important for a 
mother to be spatially situated away from males 
around the time of delivery. If a male is to maximize 
his benefit by killing an infant, infanticide 
immediately after birth may be the best tactic. Infants 
are most vulnerable, females may be least able to 
resist, and the interval between parturition and 
resumption of cycling would be shortest. In fact, 
some previous studies at Mahale also reported 
relevant cases. In one case, an adolescent male was 
observed carrying a dead infant presumed to have 
been born on that day. It was suspected to have been 
killed and cannibalized because it showed some 
antemortem wounds and its right foot was lost, as if 
bitten off (Hosaka, Matsumoto, Huffman, & 
Kawanaka, 2000). In another case, two high-ranking 
adult males severely attacked an adult female and her 
infant born on that day. In this case, the infant, 
protected by the mother and some other females, 
barely escaped being killed (Sakamaki, Itoh, & 
Nishida, 2001). Given how rarely births have been 
seen in the wild, the possibility exists that infanticide 
immediately or very soon after delivery occurs more 
often than these two cases indicate. 
If “maternity leave” is an effective counterstrategy 
against infanticide soon after delivery, the reason for 
Devota not employing this strategy is a mystery. We 
suggest some possible reasons, not mutually 
exclusive. First, females might need to learn when 
and how to take “maternity leave” through experience, 
and Devota, presumed to be primiparous, had not yet 
had the experience. This “need to learn” hypothesis is 
possible; however, it is not consistent with the result 
that there was no significant difference in the length 
of perinatal absence between primiparous and 
multiparous females. Nevertheless, this result should 
be considered with caution: it is possible in the wild 
that infanticide soon after delivery is completely 
unnoticed by the researchers. If primiparous females 
face more such risks because of the lack of “maternity 
leave,” we might have missed some of the true first 
deliveries, and some of those we included as 
“primiparous females” in the above analysis may not 
really be primiparous. Then the length of perinatal 
absence 
of 
“primiparous 
females” 
could 
be 
overestimated, as we might have omitted some short 
perinatal absences of true primiparous females 
consequently resulting in infanticide, and instead, we 
might have included some perinatal absences of 
females who actually are giving their second or third 
deliveries. Second, the infant was born prematurely 
and Devota was not prepared to give birth then. This 
“premature delivery” hypothesis is also possible; 
however, Toshifumi Udono, a veterinarian who has 
observed many chimpanzee deliveries in captivity 
and investigated the photographs taken by HN, 
suggested that this presumption may be ruled out 
because the infant was large enough to be viable 
(Toshifumi Udono, pers. comm.). Third, Devota 
might not have perceived any risk of infanticide at the 
delivery because there might have been possible 
father males who had copulated with Devota around 
the time of conception. This “father’s protection” 
hypothesis is also possible; however, we cannot draw 
any conclusion because we have no copulation data 
of Devota during the conception period, nor have we 
any tissue sample of the victim infant for paternity 
confirmation.
