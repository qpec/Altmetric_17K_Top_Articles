Abstract
The U.S. health care sector is highly interconnected with industrial activities that emit much
of the nation’s pollution to air, water, and soils. We estimate emissions directly and indirectly
attributable to the health care sector, and potential harmful effects on public health. Nega-
tive environmental and public health outcomes were estimated through economic input-out-
put life cycle assessment (EIOLCA) modeling using National Health Expenditures (NHE) for
the decade 2003–2013 and compared to national totals. In 2013, the health care sector was
also responsible for significant fractions of national air pollution emissions and impacts,
including acid rain (12%), greenhouse gas emissions (10%), smog formation (10%) criteria
air pollutants (9%), stratospheric ozone depletion (1%), and carcinogenic and non-carcino-
genic air toxics (1–2%). The largest contributors to impacts are discussed from both the
supply side (EIOLCA economic sectors) and demand side (NHE categories), as are trends
over the study period. Health damages from these pollutants are estimated at 470,000
DALYs lost from pollution-related disease, or 405,000 DALYs when adjusted for recent
shifts in power generation sector emissions. These indirect health burdens are commensu-
rate with the 44,000–98,000 people who die in hospitals each year in the U.S. as a result of
preventable medical errors, but are currently not attributed to our health system. Concerted
efforts to improve environmental performance of health care could reduce expenditures
directly through waste reduction and energy savings, and indirectly through reducing pollu-
tion burden on public health, and ought to be included in efforts to improve health care qual-
ity and safety.
Introduction
The Institute of Medicine 2013 Workshop Summary Public Health Linkages with Sustainability
suggests that “the health sector should lead by example by greening itself and reducing its eco-
logical footprint. . ..to improve global health and the health of the planet [1].” Quantification of
pollution and disease burden stemming from health care is critical to improve the quality and
safety of practice, to inform mitigation strategies and leverage health care leadership in sustain-
able development.

 The United States spends the most of any nation by far on its health care system, nearly
one-fifth of GDP, or approximately $3 trillion dollars in 2013 [2]. Health care services are also
energy-intensive. Hospitals are the second-most energy-intensive commercial buildings in the
country, after food service facilities [3]. Hospitals are typically large buildings, open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, and contain several energy-intensive activities, including sophisticated
heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, computing, medical and laboratory equipment use,
sterilization, refrigeration, laundry, as well as food service [3]. In addition to energy used on
site in the form of heating fuels and electricity, the health care system also uses vast quantities
of energy-intensive goods and services, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, which
require significant energy inputs for their manufacturing. As the U.S. is the second-largest
emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) globally, it follows that the health care sector is an impor-
tant target for emissions reductions as well. Yet despite its size and status, there has been little
work to quantify or probe consumption-based emissions from the U.S. health care sector, how
these emissions are trending over time, or how these emissions might affect public health
overall.
In 2009, Chung and Meltzer [4] estimated the aggregate carbon footprint of the U.S. health
care sector, underscoring the substantial role that health care plays in the physical economy of
the country. They report that health care contributes 8% of the nation’s greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions both from health care activities and direct purchases (46%) and from indirect activi-
ties associated with the supply chain of health care-related goods and services (54%). Parallel
efforts in the United Kingdom report that the National Health Service (NHS) contributes
3–4% of the national GHG emissions total [5]. Efforts are underway to quantify the climate
impacts of specific medical devices or supplies and procedures, with the overall objective of
finding equally effective but less carbon-intensive ways to deliver care [6–9].
While greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a critical category of emissions and climate change
may have severe, negative impacts on human health and livelihoods [10], there are several
other categories of emissions from health care with negative environmental and public health
consequences that are important to consider. In addition to direct emissions from health care
facilities, there are also indirect emissions that occur as a consequence of producing the elec-
tricity and materials that those facilities use. In this way, the health care sector is interconnected
with and supported by industrial activities that emit much of the pollution to air, water, and
soils nationally, including particulate matter, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, persistent organic pol-
lutants, and toxic metals. These very emissions contribute to the national disease burden. Fine
particulate matter is the leading cause of air pollution-related disease, with 87% of the world’s
population living in areas exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality
Guideline of 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 [11]. The objective of this work is to provide a quantitative esti-
mate of the GHG and non-GHG-related emissions directly and indirectly attributable to the U.
S. health care sector in order to assess the scale of potential harmful effects of these emissions
on public health.
Methods
Negative environmental and public health outcomes attributable to the health care sector were
estimated for the U.S. using economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIOLCA). Input-
output models are compiled by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and describe
monetary flows among all of the 400+ economic sectors that comprise the national economy.
EIOLCA extends these economic models by adjoining sector-specific intensity values for emis-
sions and resource use (e.g., energy, water) per dollar of expenditure. As described in the model
documentation [12], for those sectors that report energy use or emissions data, such as utilities

 or manufacturing, intensity values come from government agencies such as the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) or Energy Information Administration (EIA). For other EIOLCA
sectors for which resource use and emissions are not reported directly, researchers extracted
economic data from the BEA Commodity x Industry Use table to determine total expenditures
on different fuel commodities (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas), used average price data to translate
these dollar values to physical amounts of fuels, and used emission factors for each fuel to esti-
mate total emissions of different pollutants. Once all intensity values have been adjoined,
matrix algebra model algorithms then use economic activity in a given sector to calculate both
direct emissions (from that sector) and indirect emissions (from all other linked sectors) that
occur throughout the entire economy as a result of that activity [13].
We use health care spending data compiled in the US National Health Expenditure
Accounts for the decade 2003–2013 in all categories of health consumption and investment
expenditures [2]. Each expenditure category is matched to the corresponding economic sector
(S1 Table) in the most recent 2002-vintage purchaser-price EIOLCA model, housed at Carne-
gie Mellon University [12]. This model requires inputs in nominal 2002 dollars, so expendi-
tures in subsequent years are deflated to this base year using the National Health Expenditures
Medical Price Index [2], calculated using the component-based Producer Price Index and Con-
sumer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (S2 Table). This approach allows for a
dynamic view of health care-related emissions and damages over the study period.
For each expenditure, the EIOLCA model then returns direct and indirect emissions to air,
water and soils; these emissions form the life cycle inventory (LCI) of the results. These emis-
sions are then linked to nine categories of environmental and human health outcomes,
included in this analysis in order to quantify the contribution of health care-related activities
relative to national totals. These impact categories include global warming; stratospheric ozone
depletion (allowing higher levels of short-wave ultraviolet light through the atmosphere,
increasing the health risks of skin cancer); respiratory disease from inhalation of primary and
secondary particulate matter (PM) and from ground-level ozone (smog) stemming from emis-
sions of criteria air pollutants; cancer and non-cancer disease through inhalation and ingestion
routes of chemical exposure; environmental effects of acidification (from formation and depo-
sition of acid rain) and eutrophication (algae blooms from excess nutrients) in soils and surface
waters; and ecotoxicity that reflects the toxic burden of all emitted chemicals to aquatic organ-
isms. Emissions are linked from the EIOLCA model to these nine categories of environmental
and human health impacts using the USEPA’s life cycle chemical fate-exposure-effect model
(TRACI) [14]. Each emitted substance that contributes to a particular environmental or health
impact is then scaled by its impact-specific potency, represented by a ‘characterization factor’.
Each factor is endpoint- and substance-specific and is a complex function of a chemical’s fate
and transformation in the environment, chemical activity, uptake and exposure, and potential
toxicity. In the public health context, characterization factors measure average health damages
per unit of chemical emitted. Characterization factors are relative, measured against a reference
substance for which effects are well-known, and so have common equivalent units, such as
CO2-e for global warming [15].
In life cycle assessment methodology (ISO 14040/44), an optional step is normalization,
that is, scaling results by a reference set of values to ease interpretation [16]. Given the national
level of our analysis, here we use a normalization set reflecting U.S. totals for each environmen-
tal and human health impact category. Health care sector totals are divided pairwise by this
normalization set to arrive at the national percentages for each impact category. Normalization
sets have been estimated previously for several versions of the TRACI model [17–19]. We
make use of the most recent set available, calculated by Ryberg et al. [19] for the TRACI 2.1
model for the impact categories of global warming (in CO2-e), acidification (in SO2-e), criteria

 air pollutants (in PM2.5-e), eutrophication (in N-e), stratospheric ozone depletion (in CFC-
11-e), and photochemical smog formation (in O3-e) [14]. This normalization set is for year
2008 emissions. We update these to 2013 by scaling with the decrease in GHG emissions from
2008 (7,050 million tons CO2-e) to 2013 (6,673 million tons CO2-e), for a ratio of approxi-
mately 1.06:1. It was not possible to perform normalization for ecotoxicity potential because
national estimates have not been reported with units or levels of aggregation consistent with
EIOLCA outputs. For human cancer and non-cancer disease, we use estimates from Lautier
et al. [18] that are expressed using the same reference substances for cancer and non-cancer
effects as the version of TRACI implemented within the EIOLCA online tool. These are ben-
zene equivalents for cancer and toluene equivalents for non-cancer health effects. EIOLCA out-
puts low and high estimates for benzene-e and toluene-e emissions. We use the average of
these results. Details of how these benzene and toluene equivalents are calculated in the original
TRACI model can be found in Bare [20].
Unit conversion was necessary for several impact categories where the reference substance
from the TRACI results did not match the reference substance needed for subsequent analysis.
For particulate matter (respiratory inorganics), the output of EIOLCA used PM10 as the refer-
ence substance, while our normalization set used PM2.5. Conversion was performed using the
ratio of characterization factors in the TRACI method [20]: PM2.5 = 1.67 PM10-e. For photo-
chemical oxidation potential (smog formation), the reference substance from EIOLCA is
ozone equivalents while the reference substance for the IMPACT2002+ method (used for dam-
age assessment, below) is ethene (C2H4). Conversion was performed using the ratio of charac-
terization factors in TRACI: C2H4 = 8.99 O3-e. For human health cancer and non-cancer
effects, the reference substances from EIOLCA are benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8) equiva-
lents while the reference substance for the IMPACT2002+ method is chloroethylene (C2H3Cl).
Conversion was performed using the ratio of characterization factors in IMPACT2002+ for
emissions to water: C6H6 = 0.118 C2H3Cl-e and C7H8 = 0.0127 C2H3Cl-e.
Results for each category are summed across U.S. expenditures to create health care sector
totals, which are then compared to U.S. totals [19]. Health care-related results were translated
from each emissions equivalents units of CFC-11-e (stratospheric ozone depletion, leading to
skin cancer), C2H4-e (smog formation), PM2.5-e (respiratory disease), and C2H3Cl-e (human
health) to the public health metric of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost using damage
assessment factors from the IMPACT2002+ model [21]. Factors used were 1.05×10−3 DALYs
per kg CFC-11-e, 2.13×10−6 DALYs per kg C2H4-e, 7.00×10−4 DALYs per kg PM2.5-e, and
2.8×10−6 DALYs per kg C2H3Cl-e emitted. Though health damages from increased ultraviolet
radiation, poor ambient air quality, or toxic exposures may take many years to manifest, they
are assigned to the year in which the emission took place.
Results
GHG Emissions
Fig 1 shows growth in U.S. health care GHG emissions, with an increase of more than 30%
over the past decade to a total of 655 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents (Mt
CO2-e) in 2013, or 9.8% of the national total. If the US health care sector were itself a country,
it would rank 13th in the world for GHG emissions, ahead of the entire U.K. [22]. Disaggre-
gated results are provided in Table 1. The largest contributors to emissions by expenditure cat-
egory were Hospital Care (36%), Physician and Clinical Services (12%), and Prescription
Drugs (10%), not including releases of waste anesthetic gases. Expressing the results disaggre-
gated by EIOLCA sector reveals that only 2.5% of GHG emissions were directly from the oper-
ation of health care facilities (e.g., from on-site boilers), meaning that the majority of health

 care’s carbon footprint is associated with its suppliers of energy, goods, and services. Among
these supplying sectors, the largest sources of GHG emissions induced by health care activities
were: power generation (36%); government services (8%); non-residential commercial and
health care construction (this includes “embodied carbon” of health care facilities (4%); and
basic organic chemicals manufacturing (3%) (Table A in S1 File).

 Several trends are evident in U.S. health care GHG emissions over the past decade. Health
care spending has increased monotonically, with a slight decrease in 2011 in real dollars. As
emissions are directly proportional to spending in EIOLCA models and are based on a single
year (2002 in this case), emissions estimates have also increased over the decade in every
spending category. (Adjustments to results based on using dynamic rather than static emission
factors are discussed in the Assumptions and Uncertainty section below.) The greatest
increases over the decade have been in home health care (+66%) and hospital care (+41%). At
the same time, national GHG emissions as inventoried by the EPA have been trending down,
largely as a result of efficiency improvements, decreased motor vehicle use, and fuel switching
for production of heat and electricity.
Non-GHG Emissions
Total results for 2013 in all environmental categories are shown in Table 2, with the proportion
of national totals in each category and the total disease burden, in DALYs. Through its direct
and indirect emissions, U.S. health care was responsible for significant fractions of national air
pollution and subsequent public health burdens, including acidification (12%), smog formation
(10%) and respiratory disease from particulate matter (9%), with a lower contribution to ozone
depletion and carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic air toxics (1–2%). Health damages from
these five categories of pollutants are estimated at 470,000 DALYs lost due to health care activi-
ties in 2013.
Disaggregated results by health expenditure category are presented in Fig 2, with numerical
details provided in S3 Table. In 2013, hospitals were the largest contributor among expenditure
categories to environmental and health impacts, between 31–37% of the total. The one excep-
tion is for ozone depletion, to which prescription drug expenditures were the largest contribu-
tor at 33%, with an additional 22% from medical devices and 15% from hospital care. Health
care structures and equipment contribute 17% of PM-equivalent emissions and 15% to smog

 formation, largely from construction and manufacturing activities. Expressing the results dis-
aggregated by EIOLCA sector (Tables A-I in S1 File) also reveals interesting patterns. ‘Power
generation and supply’ is the largest contributing supply sector by far to acidification (44%),
respiratory impacts (26%), eutrophication (21%), and smog formation (28%) impact catego-
ries, as a result of electricity use in health care facilities and their supply chains. For ozone
depletion, however, the largest contributors were ‘Surgical and medical instrument
manufacturing’ and ‘Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing’ (23% each), from the use of
halocarbon solvents, refrigerants, propellants, blowing agents, and other ozone depleting sub-
stances. For ecotoxicity and human health toxicity (cancer and non-cancer) the most impor-
tant EIOLCA sector ‘Waste management and remediation’, which contributed more than 85%
of the total to ecotoxicity and >50% to human health toxicity impacts.
Fig 3 shows results for all impact categories over the period 2003–2013, with numerical
details provided in S4 Table. The overall increase in modeled impacts was remarkably consis-
tent, between 27–30% across all impact categories. Ozone depletion shows the steepest slope
(fastest increase) in impacts for the period 2003–2010, reflecting the large increase in ozone
depletion-intensive prescription drug expenditures during that period. This increase in expen-
ditures of 78% in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars exceeded that for all other expenditure cate-
gories. The economic slowdown during 2007–2010 can be seen in the sharp corrections for
ozone depletion and respiratory effects, but after 2010 all impact categories resume consistent
growth to 2013.
All of the above results are a product of life cycle emissions or effect intensities (per dollar
expenditure, from the EIOLCA model) and dollars expended in each sector (from NHE
accounts). The life cycle intensity values alone are presented in S5 Table for each health care-
related EIOLCA sector. Per dollar of expenditure, ‘Nonresidential commercial and health care
structures’ is the most emissions-intensive sector (on a life cycle basis, including both direct
and indirect emissions) for global warming, acidification, respiratory effects, eutrophication,
and smog formation, while ‘Surgical and medical instrument manufacturing’ is the most inten-
sive for ozone depletion potential and ‘General state and local government services’ is the most

Across all impact categories, ‘Insurance carriers’ is the least emissions-intensive EIOLCA sector
related to health care, as expected for a service sector without major material or energy
requirements.
Discussion
Patient Health and Public Health
Indirect health damages stemming from health sector pollution are currently unreported and
largely unrecognized in health care, and it is useful to compare these results to other estimates
of patient health and public health damages. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) first highlighted
in 1999, To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System, that 44,000–98,000 people die in U.
S. hospitals each year as a result of preventable medical errors, at a total cost of $17–29 billion
per year [23]. The IOM report highlighted that the level of preventable harm in medicine is
unacceptably high, and mostly the result of faulty systems. This report sparked a national
exploration into how the health care delivery system could be redesigned to innovate and
improve care through formalized patient safety efforts [24] led by the U.S. Department of
Health & Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). With a con-
servative average estimate of 10 years of life lost per fatality [25], DALYs from deaths due to
preventable medial errors are of the same order of magnitude as the 470,000 DALY lost due to
health care-related emissions, calling for similar national attention to the need for prevention
of health sector pollution.

 related burdens of just over 1.9 million DALYs [26]. Fann et al. estimated PM2.5- and ozone-
related burdens of nearly 2.2 million years of life lost for 2005 (excluding transboundary emis-
sions) [27], while Caiazzo et al. estimated that total combustion-related emissions in 2005
caused 210,600 premature deaths from PM2.5 and ozone exposure [28]. While the methods
used were different from the EIOLCA methods employed in the present work, suggesting cau-
tion in making direct comparisons, these past results suggest that the overall contribution of
the health care sector to the national burden of disease is significant.
While some level of emissions and subsequent damages to public health are an inevitable
consequence of energy use and general economic activity in our current industrial system,
Americans spend more than twice as much on health care as other industrialized countries,
without commensurate health benefits [29]. Just as some portion of current health care spend-
ing is excess (with a midpoint estimate of 34% in 2011 [30]) and so not necessary to maintain a
high level of population health, there are opportunities to reduce health care-related emissions
and indirect burdens without compromising patient care through waste reduction and effi-
ciency improvements in the actual delivery of care. Indeed, the follow up IOM report, Crossing
the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century [24], described six aims for qual-
ity as a systems property. These aims include avoiding injuries to patients from care that is
intended to help them, as well as improving efficiency and avoiding waste. Health care pollu-
tion itself is a patient safety issue and pollution prevention ought to be included in ongoing
efforts to improve health care safety and quality overall.
Assumptions and Uncertainty
Uncertainty associated with the EIOLCA model structure and construction is discussed in the
model documentation and in supporting literature [12, 13]. Recall that the EIOLCA model
adjoins three types of data: a matrix of economic flows (compiled by BEA), a vector of emis-
sions for each sector (compiled from various government sources), and a matrix of characteri-
zation factors that link emissions to impacts (calculated from the EPA TRACI model). There
can be uncertainty associated with values in each of these data sets. Often parameter uncer-
tainty is unquantified because data are reported to the government directly without statistical
analysis or sampling. Other sources of uncertainty include: the use of self-reported, incomplete,
and/or aggregated data from industry; bias due to reporting thresholds that lead to chronic
underestimation of emissions and therefore impacts (most pronounced for toxicity-related
impacts); the linear structure of the model (no returns to scale); classification mismatch
between BEA sectors and study sectors of interest (NHE categories in this case); and temporal
mismatch between the EIOLCA model year and the study year.
Temporal considerations arise largely because of the reliance on a static economic model.
Under this assumption, emissions intensities (mass of pollutants emitted per unit of economic
activity) remains fixed for each economic sector, even though improvements in efficiencies and
pollution control and the mix of technologies employed. (Price changes have been controlled
for using the Medical Price Index as noted.) This effect is perhaps most pronounced for the
power generation sector, which has experienced a dramatic decrease in the percentage of coal-
fired electric generating units powering the grid over the study period, with a concomitant
decrease in the carbon emissions intensity of electricity (GHG emissions per unit of electricity
generated) of nearly 17% [31]. If we apply this adjustment to the share of health care GHGs
from power generation (37%), this leads to a downward revision of results by ~6% to 607 Mt
CO2-e of health care GHG emissions in 2013, or 9.3% of the US national total. Considering
particulate matter, according to the 2014 National Emissions Inventory (NEI), absolute emis-
sions factors for electricity generation have decreased by 55% for primary PM10 and 59% for
Environmental and Health Impacts of U.S. Health Care

 primary PM2.5 (including condensibles) [32], equivalent to a 57% and 61% decrease, respec-
tively, in PM emissions factors when accounting for the increase in electricity generation from
2002–2013. Inspection of the EIOLCA results reveals that electric power generation is respon-
sible for just 26% of total health care-related PM emissions (the percentage is 12% for the econ-
omy as a whole [32]). Thus, health damages due to PM exposure can be revised downward by
approximately 15%, to 370,000 DALYs, bringing the total for all five pollutant damage catego-
ries to 405,000 DALYs. Outside of power generation, many other sectors have also experienced
changes in emissions factors due to fuel switching, efficiency improvements, and improved pol-
lution controls. For example, the truck transportation sector has experienced increases in fuel
economy, improvements in engine and catalytic converter designs, and more widespread avail-
ability of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. It is not possible at this time to capture changing emis-
sions trends in all of the 400+ sectors of the economy in order to adjust the results, as was done
for power generation, but future versions of the EIOLCA model should provide the means to
test the sensitivity of the results to changes in emission factors over time.
Other sources of uncertainty include the characterization factors that relate emissions to
changes in ambient concentrations and from ambient concentrations to exposure and disease
onset. Though this has been an area of intensive modeling and research recently, it is well-
known that factors for human health toxicity are among the most uncertain of all impact cate-
gories, especially for toxicity stemming from metal emissions [33]. There is also uncertainty
introduced by moving between model versions of TRACI and in using the separate
IMPACT2002+ model to extend the TRACI results to health endpoints of DALYs lost and
cases incurred, particularly for the human health cancer and non-cancer impact categories.
Future work should take advantage of upcoming model updates (to both EIOLCA and life
cycle impact assessment methods) to re-run the analysis and investigate the largest contribut-
ing expenditure categories and supply sectors. Model updates may also reduce uncertainty for
cancer and non-cancer impact categories including additional toxic releases in the EIOLCA
inventory as well as updating characterization factors and eliminating the need for inter-model
conversions. We believe, however, that the main finding is robust, namely that the health care
sector is responsible for a significant proportion of emissions and public health damages in the
U.S. Conversely, efforts to improve resource efficiency in health care, through energy efficiency
projects or effective waste prevention and management practices, for example, will not only
reap economic rewards for health care facilities but will also produce significant indirect public
health benefits.
Improvement Efforts
Environmental stewardship plays a synergistic role in achieving the triple aim set out by the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement and adopted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services, namely better care for individuals, better care for populations, and reducing per-cap-
ita costs [34]. Reducing waste can improve both economic and environmental performance
without compromising quality of care [30]. Reducing direct and indirect emissions should be
considered a key aspect of building a safer health system to improve health care quality and
efficiency and reduce unintended adverse effects, both direct and indirect. Decreases in emis-
sions that are attributable to the health care sector will have direct benefits in the U.S. and else-
where, for example by decreasing the 3.7 million annual fatalities that result from poor
ambient air quality worldwide leading to ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute lower respiratory infections in children [35], or the
34,000 annual cancer cases in the U.S. alone attributable to occupational and environmental
exposures [36]. Economic damages from electricity generation emissions alone in the U.S. has

 been estimated at in excess of $130 billion annually (dominated by health damages) [37], so
controlling emissions and reducing demand for electricity could potentially save billions of dol-
lars in health care costs. For GHGs specifically, climate change mitigation efforts have been
specifically called for by the WHO and other leading health care bodies [38]. Potential health
benefits include reducing the estimated 150,000 annual fatalities that occur worldwide as a
result of climate change [39]. Efforts to improve the carbon footprint of health care will also
have environmental and health co-benefits, as has been demonstrated for several other sectors
including food and agriculture [40], urban transport and land use [41], and household energy
use [42].
The World Health Organization notes the health sector, itself, can reap gains from rapid
and early adoption of mitigation strategies that improve access to renewable energy, through
environmentally friendly operational and building solutions [43]. In the U.S., the Healthier
Hospitals Initiative (HHI) (http://healthierhospitals.org/) is a national campaign launched in
2012 to improve environmental health and sustainability in the health care sector. The HHI
was organized with Health Care Without Harm, Practice Greenhealth, and The Center for
Health Design, and offers tools and resources developed from the Green Guide for Healthcare.
The HHI already engages 1,200+ U.S. hospitals actively seeking guidance on the transition to
more sustainable operations. The American Hospitals Association also provides a Sustainabil-
ity Roadmap (http://www.sustainabilityroadmap.org/.) Both offer recommendations to
improve the environmental footprint of key areas that reduce both direct on-site and indirect
supply chain emissions, including cleaner and more efficient energy use, water conservation,
waste reduction, environmentally preferable supply chain management, safer cleaning chemi-
cals, and healthier foods. The Coalition for Sustainable Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices is
seeking to develop manufacturing standards for best practices and reporting transparency,
guided by life cycle assessment (http://www.sduhealth.org.uk/areas-of-focus/carbon-hotspots/
pharmaceuticals/cspm.aspx).
Clinicians play a critical, yet unaddressed role in health care resource use and represent a
key opportunity for waste prevention. Seemingly small changes in how medical supplies are
utilized or services delivered could have substantial benefits for resource conservation and pub-
lic health when magnified over this large sector. Efforts such as the Choosing Wisely Campaign
(http://www.choosingwisely.org/) offer evidence-based guidance to reduce unnecessary medi-
cal tests, treatments and procedures. A critical knowledge gap exists in the medical community
regarding the indirect health consequences of wasteful, non-value added practices in all their
forms, making resource conservation education and leadership crucial to improving the health
system.
Conclusions
The fundamental tenet of health care practice is ‘Do no harm,’ but ironically, the practice of
health care itself causes significant pollution, and, consequently, indirect adverse effects on
public health. We quantify life cycle emissions of the health care sector, including upstream
and downstream activities, and estimate the magnitude of subsequent impacts to human
health. We found this amount of disease burden, unreported and largely unrecognized in
health care, is similar in magnitude to annual deaths stemming from preventable medical
errors first reported in To Err is Human [23], which is a topic of national discourse and institu-
tional efforts to improve health care safety. These findings underscore the need to measure,
mitigate, and educate on the considerable human health and environmental impacts associated
with health care practice itself. Efforts to improve the environmental performance of health
care can reduce expenditures directly through waste reduction and energy savings, but also

 indirectly through reducing the pollution burden on public health, and ought to be included in
efforts to improve health care quality and safety.
