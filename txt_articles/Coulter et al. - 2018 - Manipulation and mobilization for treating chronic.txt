Abstract
BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Mobilization and manipulation therapies are widely used to benefit
patients with chronic low back pain. However, questions remain about their efficacy, dosing, safety,
and how these approaches compare with other therapies.
PURPOSE: The present study aims to determine the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of various
mobilization and manipulation therapies for treatment of chronic low back pain.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The present study measures self-reported pain, function, health-
related quality of life, and adverse events.
METHODS: We identified studies by searching multiple electronic databases from January 2000
to March 2017, examining reference lists, and communicating with experts. We selected random-
ized controlled trials comparing manipulation or mobilization therapies with sham, no treatment, other
active therapies, and multimodal therapeutic approaches. We assessed risk of bias using Scottish In-
tercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Where possible, we pooled data using random-effects meta-
analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was
applied to determine the confidence in effect estimates. This project is funded by the National Center
for Complementary and Integrative Health under Award Number U19AT007912.
RESULTS: Fifty-one trials were included in the systematic review. Nine trials (1,176 patients) pro-
vided sufficient data and were judged similar enough to be pooled for meta-analysis. The standardized
mean difference for a reduction of pain was SMD=−0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.47 to −0.09,
p=.004; I2=57% after treatment; within seven trials (923 patients), the reduction in disability was
SMD=−0.33, 95% CI −0.63 to −0.03, p=.03; I2=78% for manipulation or mobilization compared with
other active therapies. Subgroup analyses showed that manipulation significantly reduced pain and
disability, compared with other active comparators including exercise and physical therapy (SMD=−0.43,
95% CI −0.86 to 0.00; p=.05, I2=79%; SMD=−0.86, 95% CI −1.27 to −0.45; p<.0001, I2=46%). Mo-
bilization interventions, compared with other active comparators including exercise regimens, significantly
reduced pain (SMD=−0.20, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.04; p=.01; I2=0%) but not disability (SMD=−0.10,
95% CI −0.28 to 0.07; p=.25; I2=21%). Studies comparing manipulation or mobilization with sham
or no treatment were too few or too heterogeneous to allow for pooling as were studies examining

 relationships between dose and outcomes. Few studies assessed health-related quality of life. Twenty-six
of 51 trials were multimodal studies and narratively described.
CONCLUSION: There is moderate-quality evidence that manipulation and mobilization are likely
to reduce pain and improve function for patients with chronic low back pain; manipulation appears
to produce a larger effect than mobilization. Both therapies appear safe. Multimodal programs may
be a promising option.

Introduction
Similar to conclusions reported most recently in BMJ [1],
a recent review published in JAMA reported that among pa-
tients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulative therapy
was associated with modest improvements in pain and func-
tion at up to 6 weeks, with transient minor musculoskeletal
harms. However, study results showed substantial heteroge-
neity [2]. The review did not address the efficacy of
manipulation and mobilization for chronic low back pain.
Given the current interest in non-pharmacological alterna-
tives for the treatment of chronic pain, in particular non-
opioid treatments [3], a systematic review of manipulation
and mobilization for chronic low back pain is timely.
The lifetime prevalence of low back pain in the United
States may be as high as 84%. The prevalence of chronic low
back pain is about 23%; it disables 11%–12% of the popu-
lation [4]. A recent systematic review of the clinical course
of non-specific low back pain found that in the first 3 months,
33% of patients showed recovery, but 1 year after onset, 65%
still reported pain [5]. The severity, length, or duration of pain
for any one individual varies, and the transition from acute
to chronic low back pain is difficult to determine [6].
Pain management approaches vary greatly. Many physi-
cians rely on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid,
and neurotropic medications, or steroid injections and surgery
as their main tools [7]. Because of the potential or apparent
risks associated with these tools [8], non-pharmacological ap-
proaches, thought to involve minimal adverse events, have
become popular. In recent years, multiple studies have ex-
plored the evidence for treating chronic low back pain; options
include spinal manipulation therapy, behavioral therapy, ex-
ercise therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,
interferential currents, low-level laser therapy, and yoga [9].
Other therapies include massage, acupuncture, and superfi-
cial heat therapy (eg, therma heat wraps, hot water bottles,
heated packs filled with grain, hot towels, and electric heating
pads) [10]. Manual modalities such as physiotherapy, massage,
chiropractic, occupational, and osteopathic therapies, includ-
ing spinal manipulation and mobilization, are often used
together and alone to treat chronic non-specific low back pain
[11,12].
Several systematic reviews have focused on manual thera-
pies such as spinal manipulation and mobilization for treating
back and neck pain [13–16]. Earlier work suggested that there
is little or no evidence that spinal manipulative therapy was
superior to other standard treatments for chronic low back
pain [17,18]; however, recent systematic reviews suggest that
spinal manipulation and mobilization are “viable” options for
pain treatment [13,19]. However, the efficacy of manipula-
tion and mobilization may vary depending on the duration
of symptoms, how the intervention is administered (eg, whether
there is additional exercise or general practitioner care, at what
dosages, and follow-up periods), the comparator, and types
of outcomes reported. Such variability could be considered
inconsistent findings; however, the overall evidence sug-
gests that manipulation and mobilization are effective treatment
modalities compared with other therapies [13,19].
The purpose of the systematic review described here was
to disentangle inconsistencies by evaluating the research ac-
cording to different symptom durations across the spectrum
of chronicity, the variations in treatment techniques, varia-
tions in comparators, and the impact on important patient-
reported outcomes. Our goal was to better understand the
effectiveness of mobilization and manipulation for chronic
non-specific low back pain as compared and reported in ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) since 2000. We would attempt
meta-analysis when there were subsets of data similar enough
to pool. This systematic review is part of a larger project in-
vestigating the appropriateness of manipulation or mobilization
for the treatment of chronic low back pain and cervical pain,
funded by the National Center for Complementary and In-
tegrative Health under Award Number U19AT007912.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis report adheres
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis guidelines.
Search strategy and data sources
The systematic review builds upon previous systematic
reviews of manipulation and mobilization for chronic low back
pain (up through 2000), such as Bronfort et al. [13] and
Shekelle et al. [18,20,21]. We designed a broad search strat-
egy that did not define the specific population (ie, not using
the word chronic or non-specific) or intervention (ie, span-
ning across multiple professions). In addition, we placed no
limitations on control or comparators, outcomes, or study
867
I.D. Coulter et al. / The Spine Journal 18 (2018) 866–879
 designs, so that the breadth and variations across the re-
search could be discovered, and the literature could inform
the appropriate definitions and subgroups to consider for anal-
ysis given that inconsistencies are present. We searched
PubMed or MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL,
PsycINFO, and ICL from January 2000 through March 2017.
We drew on reference lists and consultation with subject matter
experts to ensure comprehensiveness (Fig. 1). Because the
National Institutes of Health–funded project focused on both
chronic neck pain and chronic low back pain, we executed
the search to meet both needs together (Table 1).
Scoping review
A scoping review of the literature informed the defini-
tions of chronicity used in the review. It also clarified what
is considered non-specific, and what subgroups should be con-
sidered for systematic review and meta-analysis. We reviewed
articles and categorized studies according to specific popu-
lations, interventions, control or comparators, outcomes, and
study designs. We excluded studies clearly not related to back
pain or to an intervention involving mobilization or manip-
ulation. We presented findings to an internal steering committee
(ISC) and an external advisory committee (EAC), where
evidence-informed definitions and specific research ques-
tions were devised based on the evidence base for carrying
out systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 1).
Study selection
Six reviewers used study eligibility criteria to indepen-
dently screen the literature in duplicate. Disagreements about
inclusion were resolved through discussion and consensus,
or if necessary, by the ISC. The eligibility criteria included
(1) a population experiencing chronic [6,22] and non-
specific [23] low back pain (as defined in Table 1); (2) an
intervention, with the involvement of a therapist, consisting
of either (i) manipulation (labeled as thrust), (ii) mobiliza-
tion (labeled as non-thrust), or (iii) a multimodal integrative
practice including manipulation or mobilization compo-
nents, labeled as a multimodal “program” if the observed effect
could not be attributed directly to the thrust or non-thrust in-
tervention (eg, a study of chiropractic plus acupuncture vs.
usual care would be multimodal and labeled as a “program”
separate from chiropractic plus acupuncture vs. acupunc-
ture); (3) compared with a sham treatment, no treatment, or

Note: Figure 1 addresses search strategy for low back pain as well as neck pain studies. The findings of neck 
pain studies are not reported here.  Because the Center of Excellence for Research in CAM (CERC) project was 
focused on both chronic neck pain as well as chronic low back pain, the search was executed to meet both needs 
together to streamline the effort.

Population “chronic” low
back pain
According to the Pain Management Task Force [6], chronic pain can be described as
ongoing or recurrent pain, lasting beyond the usual course of acute illness or injury
or more than 3–6 mo, and which adversely affects the individual’s well-being. In
2014, the National Institutes of Health Task Force on Research Standards for Low
Back [22] recommended defining chronicity of pain as: “(1) How long has back
pain been an ongoing problem for you? (2) How often has low-back pain been an
ongoing problem for you over the past 6 months? A response of greater than 3
months to question 1, and a response of ‘at least half the days in the past 6 months’
to question 2 would define chronic low back pain.”
The majority of studies defined chronicity based on the duration of pain symptoms for
12 wk or more. Therefore, a similar definition of chronicity (≥12 wk) was adopted,
and studies were categorized as those patients with >12 wk, a mean duration of
6 mo, and those with >12-mo pain duration.
Population “non-specific”
Non-specific low back pain is defined as pain not attributable to a recognizable,
known specific pathology [23] (eg, infection, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture,
structural deformity, rheumatoid arthritis, radicular syndrome). Therefore, the
etiology of the pain is often unknown and it is not categorized with a major
pathogenic etiology.
The existing literature does not use standard terminology to report “non-specific”
chronic pain. To guide the eligibility of studies, the following terms were specified
to be outside the scope of “non-specific”: specific conditions, ie, cancer,
rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, spondylolisthesis (displacement of vertebra) and
spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal), pregnancy-related pain, and ankylosing
spondylitis. Consensus among the internal steering committee specified the
following exemptions: osteoarthritis, sciatica, radiculopathy, low back pain “of
mechanical origin,” pain associated with spondylosis, sacroiliac joint syndrome,
trauma-induced, disc herniation, pelvic anteversion, and “occupational” low back
pain.
Interventions mobilization or
manipulation
Bronfort et al. defined mobilization as “the application of manual force to the spinal
joints within the passive range of joint motion that does not involve a thrust (p.
336)” [13]. The RAND report by Coulter et al. defines mobilization as “controlled,
judiciously applied force of low velocity and variable amplitude directed to spinal
joint segment(s)” (p. xi) [24].
Spinal manipulation is defined as “the application of high-velocity, low amplitude
manual thrusts to the spinal joints slightly beyond the passive range of joint
motion,” by Bronfort et al. [13], where the RAND report by Coulter et al. defines
spinal manipulation as “a controlled, judiciously applied dynamic thrust
adjustment, that may include combined extension and rotation of the upper cervical
spinal segments, or low-velocity and low-amplitude force with the use of a short or
long lever directed to spinal joint segments within patient tolerance” (p. xi) [24].
The interventions in this systematic review consist of manipulation or mobilization in
chiropractic settings and other non-invasive therapies including osteopathy, manual
therapy and physical therapy. For simplicity, interventions were categorized into
thrust and non-thrust interventions. When combined with other active
interventions, they were labeled as “programs.”
Control/comparator(s)
This review focused on any intervention being compared with mobilization or
manipulation, including any active therapy (ie, exercise, physical therapy),
manipulation (thrust), mobilization (non-thrust), sham, no treatment, usual, or
standard care.
For the purpose of analysis, controls or comparisons were categorized as active,
sham, or no treatment, or as direct comparisons between various thrust and non-
thrust interventions.
Outcome(s)
Although pain reduction was predefined as the primary outcome of interest, the most
commonly reported pain-related, patient-reported outcomes that affect health status
were determined through a scoping review and thus pooled to determine which
could be assessed.
Patient-reported outcomes that the majority of studies include to date: pain intensity
or severity (as measured by a VAS or NRS) disability (as measured by the RMDQ,
HRQoL) as measured by the SF-36 or safety.
Study design(s)
All study designs were considered for the purposes of scoping the literature.
Randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review and meta-
analysis. Other study designs were queried when gaps were present (ie, safety).
HRQoL, health-related quality of life; NRS, numeric rating scale; RMDQ, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; SF-36, Short Form 36; VAS, visual analog scale.

 other active therapies, such as exercise, physiotherapy, or phys-
ical therapy; (4) an RCT, involving adult human subjects (age
18 years or older); and (5) at least one pain outcome mea-
suring a reduction in pain intensity or severity, such as the
visual analog scale (VAS) or numeric rating scale (Table 1).
Data extraction and quality assessment
Six reviewers participated in data extraction and quality
assessment of the individual studies. Population character-
istics, treatment intervention(s), control or comparators, and
outcomes were described for each included study. Quality as-
sessment was performed in duplicate by reviewers;
disagreements were tracked and resolved by the ISC. Risk
of bias was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guide-
lines Network (SIGN 50) checklist for RCTs [25]. We assessed
external validity using the External Validity Assessment Tool
(EVAT) [26], which measures the generalizability of re-
search to other individuals (external validity) and other settings
(model validity) outside the confines of a study.
Data synthesis and analysis
The primary analysis was based on trials reporting a
continuous outcome measure for pain intensity, disability,
or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [27] up to 1
month after the end of treatment. Subgroups were con-
structed to transparently report those studies where (1)
chronicity duration is greater than 3 months or greater than
12 months, (2) intervention consisting of thrust or non-
thrust, (3) and were compared with sham or no-treatment or
another active intervention, for each outcome assessed.
Secondary analyses were based on trials reporting a contin-
uous measure for pain, disability, or HRQoL at follow-up
points closest to 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Single
treatment (one dose over one day) studies were excluded
from any analysis. Data synthesis and analysis methods for
those multimodal interventions where the effects of manip-
ulation or mobilization could not be distinguished from the
total program were not applied as these studies involved
more pragmatic, program-type interventions and were het-
erogeneous from study to study. For simplicity and because
many types and styles were included in systematic review,
the authors chose to refer to the manipulation therapies as
“thrust” and mobilization therapies as “non-thrust” (Table 1).
We grouped studies in this way in order to attempt to create
homogeneous subsets of studies, allowing us to ask ques-
tions about how interventions compare (eg, thrust vs. sham
or no treatment, thrust vs. other active therapies); dose
regimens and practitioner-specific techniques remained het-
erogeneous across studies (Supplementary Data Files 1 and
2). Some subgroups were judged too heterogeneous to pool
in any meaningful way.
For all studies where data were available, we extracted
sample size, mean, and standard deviation for each treat-
ment group, at each time point reported. An unbiased estimate
using the Hedges’ effect size [28] and 95% lower and upper
limits was computed using intergroup differences between
groups at those time points. For a reduction in pain intensi-
ty or disability, a negative effect size favors the thrust or non-
thrust intervention more than the comparison arm (active
comparator, sham, or no treatment group). For an increase
in HRQoL, a positive effect size indicates benefit in thrust
or non-thrust treatment group more than the comparison arm.
This was done regardless of whether the study was consid-
ered for meta-analysis or not.
We considered a minimum of three studies judged similar
enough in terms of the population, intervention, control or
comparator, and outcome measure as sufficient for pooling
data for meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences (SMDs)
were computed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, Version
3.3.070 (CMA; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). Meta-
analyses of SMD were performed with the generic inverse
model of REVMAN. Because we expected heterogeneity, we
used random-effects models; statistical heterogeneity was ex-
amined by I2 with low, moderate, and high I2 values of 25%,
50%, and 75%, respectively. Publication bias was assessed
using the Begg adjusted rank correlation test [29] and the Egger
regression asymmetry test [30]. Pooled effect sizes for pain
and disability outcomes were translated into the VAS (0–
100) using a standard deviation of 25 points, and the Roland-
Morris Disability Questionnaire (0–24), using a standard
deviation of 6 points, respectively, for clinical interpretation
[17].
We assessed confidence in the effect estimates using the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) approach based on the following cri-
teria: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision,
and publication bias, for each outcome [31].
Results
A total of 7,360 published citations were captured from
January 2000 to March 2017, of which 6,663 were screened
at title or abstract level according to the broad eligibility
criteria. This search also included studies on neck pain,
which are not reported here. We retrieved full text for 711
articles; of these, 334 were identified as RCTs on either
neck pain or low back pain. After removing the studies on
neck pain, a total of 64 RCT publications reporting on
patients with chronic, non-specific low back pain were
included in this systematic review. Of these, 32 reports
[32–63] including 25 unique studies [32–56] were labeled
as non-specific chronic low back pain unimodal (ie, thrust
or non-thrust) studies; 32 reports [64–95] including 26
unique studies [64,66–90] were multimodal (ie, programs
involving thrust or non-thrust) chronic low back pain studies.
In addition, non-randomized studies were identified as part
of a larger effort, and investigated to gain further understand-
ing of safety issues and more pragmatic “real world”
implications beyond that which might be offered in the
RCTs evaluated (data not shown) (Fig. 2).

 Study characteristics
Characteristics of included studies are detailed in Sup-
plementary Data Files 1 and 2. The included RCTs examining
either a uni- or multimodal intervention of thrust or non-
thrust for patients with chronic low back pain were published
between 2000 and 2014. No studies meeting eligibility cri-
teria were found between 2015 and 2017. The total number
of participants across the 51 unique studies was 8,748, ranging
from 19 to 1,334 participants in each study. The average age
of participants was 42 years, ranging from 29 to 59 years.
On average, there were more females than males. For the
unimodal (Supplementary Data File 1) studies, participants
reported average pain duration of 3 months or more in 60%
of included studies, 6 months or more in 12% of studies; in
28% of studies, participants described chronic pain as more
than 1 year. Multimodal studies (Supplementary Data File 2)
reported participant average pain duration of 3 months or more
in 30% of the included studies; fewer studies described par-
ticipants’ chronic pain lasting 6 months (19%). Lastly, 51%
of included studies described participants’ chronic pain as
lasting more than 1 year.
Of the 25 unimodal studies, 60% were identified as thrust
interventions, 28% were non-thrust interventions, and 12%
used a combination of both. Some of these studies were
multimodal by design, but were included in this subgroup for
the purposes of analysis because the effect of each interven-
tion could be distinguished. A variety of interventions were

871

 combined to serve more as “programs” for the included
multimodal studies. The most prevalent interventions used in
combination with a thrust or non-thrust intervention were pre-
scribed exercises; others included stretches, massage,
ultrasound, education, or advice therapy. Combined treat-
ment dosages varied from one session for 3 minutes to 16
sessions of 45 minutes each over the course of 8 weeks. The
majority of studies (84%) had active control or comparators
(eg, acupuncture, physical therapy, exercise, usual care); the
remaining studies compared the intervention with sham or
no treatment.Active control or comparator dosages varied from
one session for 3 minutes to 16 sessions of 45 minutes each
over the course of 8 weeks.
The studies reported outcomes related to pain intensity or
severity, disability, and HRQoL, all of which were consid-
ered critical outcomes for evaluation. The most common
outcome measures were evaluated using the VAS (26 of 51)
and the numeric pain rating scale (12 of 51) for pain reduc-
tion, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (21 of 41)
or Oswestry Disability Index for disability (16 of 41), and
the Short Form-36 for HRQoL (15 of 17) (Supplemental Data
Files 1 and 2).
Methodological quality
Overall, risk of bias was not considered serious across either
the unimodal or the multimodal studies. Of the 25 unimodal
RCT studies [32–56], 3 (12%) were given a SIGN 50 score
of high quality (++) [32–34], 18 (72%) as acceptable quality
(+) [35–52], and 4 (16%) as low quality (0) [53–56]. Among
the 26 multimodal studies, 3 (12%) were rated high quality
(++) [88–90], 20 (77%) acceptable quality (+) [68–87,94],
and 3 (11%) low quality (0) [64,65,67,96]. The most prev-
alent poorly addressed quality criteria related to pitfalls in
reporting group differences, intention-to-treat analyses, and
multisite similarities, respectively. Overall, all EVAT catego-
ries were addressed adequately. The source population (44
of 51) and recruitment of participants (39 of 51) were trans-
parently described and reflective of the population from which
they were drawn. Twenty-three of 51 studies described the
staff, places, and facilities where treatment occurred, but other
studies lacked the details required to fully understand the clin-
ical applicability to real-world settings. The majority of studies
involved physical therapists, chiropractors, physicians, na-
turopathic, or osteopathic clinicians. In some, multiple
therapists delivered the interventions. Practitioner character-
istics were well described in many of studies. Treatment
locations varied, including private clinics, university set-
tings, hospitals, or other medical facilities (Table 2).
Adverse events
Of the 25 unimodal RCTs, 5 reported that no adverse events
occurred during the study period; 2 reported minor adverse
events—typically worsening symptoms. Another study re-
ported that 2% of patients experienced serious adverse events.
However, none of these symptoms was determined to be
treatment-related, and the frequency of adverse events in the
treatment and control groups was not significantly differ-
ent. The remaining 17 studies did not provide any information
on adverse events in the publications.
None of the multimodal studies reported a serious adverse
event. Ten studies failed to report on adverse events and 10
reported that none had occurred. Of the remaining six, the
adverse events were noted as mild, including temporary
treatment-related soreness, tiredness, or worsening of exist-
ing complaints. Of studies that did report adverse events, the
authors failed to describe how an event was determined to
be adverse, how data were collected, and the intervals for data
collection. It appears that this is perhaps spontaneous self-

 during treatment resulting in death, life-threatening adverse
experience, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hos-
pitalization, or persistent or significant disability or incapacity
(Supplementary Data Files 1 and 2). Of the non-RCT studies
examined for the larger project effort, the majority ne-
glected to report on adverse events. Those that did reported
either new complaints or worsening of existing complaints
after initial treatment; however, these complaints were not as-
sociated with worse long-term outcomes and were unlikely
to be serious [97–99].
Data synthesis
Studies comparing thrust or non-thrust with a sham or no
treatment control were heterogeneous and could not be pooled
for analysis in any meaningful way. In addition, dose studies
that are included in the systematic review were heteroge-
neous and omitted from any analysis. As noted previously,
we excluded multimodal studies from analysis because of their
inherent heterogeneity. The remainder of studies for consid-
eration consisted of those thrust and non-thrust interventions
compared with another active therapy, consisting of exer-
cise or physical therapy where treatment was over multiple
sessions and post-treatment assessment was closest to 1 month
(4–8 weeks from baseline) across outcomes of pain reduc-
tion, disability, and enhanced HRQoL.
Reduction in pain
Nine trials (1,176 patients) with a reduction in pain at post-
treatment closest to 1 month from baseline and with continuous
data were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled SMD
across all studies showed a statistically significant larger re-
duction in pain from thrust or non-thrust interventions
compared with an active comparator being that of exercise
or physical therapy (SMD=−0.28, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.09,
p=.004; I2=57%). Statistical subgroup analyses showed that
when compared with active therapies (SMD=−0.43, 95% CI
−0.86 to 0.00; p=.05, I2=79%), the data favor thrust inter-
ventions for patients with chronic low back pain (5 trials; 481
patients). Among five trials (695 patients), non-thrust inter-
ventions, compared with other active comparators, showed
a statistically significantly larger reduction in pain
(SMD=−0.20, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.04; p=.01; I2=0%). Trans-
lated into the VAS, the reduction in pain intensity achieved
by thrust interventions equates to 10.75 points larger on a
0–100-mm scale than its comparators; non-thrust interven-
tions equate to a 5.0-point reduction higher on a 0–100-mm
scale compared with other active comparators. Fig. 3 details
the overall analysis and the subgroups analyzed.
Secondary analyses comparing varying durations of chro-
nicity or dose were not feasible given the available literature
but are specified if documented in the study in Supplemen-
tary Data File 1. Data were available for 3 and 6 months

873

 follow-up in both thrust and non-thrust compared with other
active comparators for pooling into meta-analysis. Thrust in-
terventions compared with other active comparators (3 trials,
370 patients) trended toward an increasing effect over time
at 3 months follow-up (SMD=−0.68, 95% CI −1.14 to −0.23;
I2=73.7%) and 6 months (3 trials, 223 patients) follow-up
(SMD=−0.72, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.45; I2=0%) (data not
shown). Non-thrust interventions at 3 and 6 months follow-
up did not significantly change from post-treatment.
Reduction in disability
Seven trials (923 patients) with continuous data were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis for a reduction in disability at post-
treatment closest to 1 month (Fig. 4). The pooled SMD across
all studies showed a statistically significant larger reduction
in disability from thrust or non-thrust interventions com-
pared with an active comparator (SMD=−0.33, 95% CI −0.63
to −0.03, p=.03; I2=78%). Subgroup analysis showed a sta-
tistically significant larger effect in favor of thrust (3 trials;
225 patients) compared with other active comparators
(SMD=−0.86, 95% CI −1.27 to −0.45; p<.0001, I2=46%);
however, analysis of non-thrust interventions (5 trials; 698
patients), when compared with other active comparators, did
not show a statistically significantly larger reduction in dis-
ability after treatment (SMD=−0.10, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.07;
p=.25; I2=21%). Translated into the Roland-Morris Disabil-
ity Questionnaire, the reduction in disability by thrust
interventions equates to a 5.16-point larger reduction l on a
0–24-mm scale than its comparators; non-thrust interven-
tions equates to a 0.6-point reduction larger on a 0–24-mm
scale compared with other active comparators. Data were avail-
able for 6 months follow-up comparing thrust with other active
comparators; the pooled estimate across three trials (223 pa-
tients) was an SMD=−0.71 (95% CI −0.98 to −0.44; I2=0%)
(data not shown). Non-thrust interventions at 3 and 6 months
follow-up did not significantly change from post-treatment
(data not shown).
Improved health-related quality of life
Too few studies reported on health-related quality of life
to allow for pooling an overall effect estimate at any time point.
Where assessed across studies, however, data are detailed in
Supplementary Data File 1.
Confidence in the effect estimates
Overall, risk of bias was not of serious concern across anal-
yses or subgroups pooled for each outcome assessed. As
expected, we detected statistically significant heterogeneity
across the overall analysis for a reduction in pain (p=.009)
and a reduction in disability (p=.0001). Heterogeneity was
likely due to pooling various types of intervention tech-
niques, dose regimens, and their comparators. Within the
subgroups when compared with active comparators,

874
I.D. Coulter et al. / The Spine Journal 18 (2018) 866–879
 heterogeneity remained significant for thrust versus other active
therapies. The comparators in these studies consisted of various
exercise regimens and physical therapy. There were too few
studies to pool according to specific chronicity duration or
according to specific predefined dosing cutoffs. The results
appeared precise; however, sample size pooled remains small.
We detected no publication bias according to either the Begg
or Egger test for either the overall analysis or according to
subgroups (data not shown). Overall, confidence in the re-
ported effects was graded as moderate for a reduction in pain
and disability after treatment.
Discussion
During the period January 2000 to March 2017, the meth-
odological quality of the RCT studies for mobilization and
manipulation for chronic low back pain is adequate overall;
however, studies remain heterogeneous in terms of dose, du-
ration, techniques involved with varying interventions and
different practitioners with perhaps different training and back-
grounds, controls or comparators being used across studies,
and duration of chronicity of patients included. The source
populations and recruitment of the participants seem to reflect
the population of interest for the study (external validity);
however, the staff, places, and facilities in which patients are
receiving therapy are not well described, making extrapola-
tion for real-life settings challenging (model validity).
Mobilization and manipulation appear to be safe, based
on what was reported in the literature. A small-moderate effect
was found in favor of manipulation for patients with chronic
low back pain, with pain duration of at least 3 months or more.
This effect seems to increase over time at 3 and 6 months
follow-up for reducing pain compared with other active com-
parators, namely exercise and physical therapy comparators.
Manipulation was also shown to reduce disability. The quality
of the body of evidence is moderate for both of these out-
comes. In the case of studies that defined chronic pain as 12
months or more, there is insufficient evidence to draw any
conclusions solely on this chronicity duration from the current
literature. Evidence to support mobilization interventions does
not seem to be as strong as evidence to support manipula-
tion intervention for chronic low back pain. Although there
are several large studies on mobilization compared with active
comparators for chronic low back pain, the majority did not
show statistically significant differences in favor of mobili-
zation interventions compared with other active comparators.
We are moderately confident in the effect estimates being
reported.
There is currently a gap in the evidence concerning the
efficacy of manipulation and mobilization compared with sham
or no treatment on pain or disability in the population studied.
Pooling across other subgroups was limited because there were
too few sufficiently similar studies. In addition, we were not
able to draw definitive conclusions about patients’ HRQoL
due to data limitations. Unlike the unimodal studies, which
evaluated the results from the thrust or non-thrust interven-
tions, the body of evidence from multimodal studies included
a variety of interventions and integrated programs. For
example, with exercise, individuals were allowed to choose
their at-home routine or practitioners prescribed specific treat-
ments. These types of programs may be attractive to patients
because the programs may be similar to what would occur
in real practice.
Overall completeness and applicability
The European Workgroup guidelines recommend a refer-
ral for spinal manipulation therapy, including mobilization,
for patients who are suffering from chronic back pain [100].
In the United States, similar recommendations exist in favor
of manual therapies including manipulation and mobiliza-
tion for chronic low back pain [101–103]. However, the
recommendations regarding manual therapies for chronic low
back pain continue to show some variation depending on
country or region of origin. In most guidelines, manipula-
tion is recommended or presented as a therapeutic option.
Other guidelines do not recommend it. It is not known why
there are such inconsistencies across guidelines [103–105].
Guidelines may have depended largely on panelists’ inter-
pretations, which have been based on insufficient or
inconclusive evidence or reflected methodological flaws in
the reported studies. Other factors that may influence guide-
line recommendations include local and national political
variance or bias [103].
Similar to the practice guidelines, recent systematic reviews
have reported favorable evidence for treating chronic non-
specific low back pain using manipulation and mobilization,
including chiropractic [13,106], osteopathic manipulation
therapy [107], and physical therapy [108]. However, as with
practice guidelines, these systematic reviews conclude that
the scientific evidence is challenged by heterogeneity in the
types of populations and interventions being studied, lacks
long-term outcomes, includes insufficient data to explore sub-
group effects, and has methodological bias that can limit and
complicate the interpretation of the results [11]. Indeed, most
systematic reviews conclude that it is difficult to draw de-
finitive conclusions regarding the risk-benefit of manual
therapies in patients with chronic non-specific pain.
As stated previously, we relied on the evidence provided
by Bronfort et al. [13] and Shekelle et al. [18,20,21] as a start-
ing point for our analysis. We used the definitions of
manipulation and mobilization based on Bronfort et al. [13]
and Coulter et al. [24]. However, our methodology gener-
ated a list of terms a priori to consider for inclusion criteria
to meet our definitions. Therefore, our comprehensiveness may
have increased the number of RCTs in this report but may
have also increased the heterogeneity for the pooled esti-
mates across those studies. Bronfort et al. [13] identified 31
total low back pain trials. Of these, 11 trials (n=1,472) as-
sessed chronic low back pain and 14 trials (n=3,068)
investigated a mix of patients with acute and chronic low back
pain.

I.D. Coulter et al. / The Spine Journal 18 (2018) 866–879
 Because of heterogeneity across studies (ie, too dissimi-
lar in terms of patient characteristics, outcome measures, time
points, and type of treatment comparisons), we did not sta-
tistically pool these studies. However, the results from Bronfort
et al. [13] were generally in favor of spinal manipulation or
mobilization for treating chronic low back pain. Bronfort et al.
[13] and Shekelle and Coulter [21] suggested that recom-
mendations for spinal manipulation may be made with some
degree of confidence They identified gaps in the current lit-
erature base that need to be filled in future work, such as the
need for future trials to examine well-defined subgroups of
patients and further address the value of manipulation and
mobilization to establish optimal number of treatment visits.
Our review attempted to explore this, but research evidence
remains lacking. We found that methodological flaws in the
RCTs we analyzed—lack of power (low precision due to
sample size) and some inconsistency—influenced our statis-
tical analysis and the overall quality of the body of evidence.
Indeed, better designed studies, more homogeneous group-
ings, clinically relevant patient-based outcomes, and larger
clinical trials are needed to inform practice decisions regard-
ing spinal manipulation and mobilization for patients with
chronic non-specific low back pain. However, this review sug-
gests that we can have moderate confidence in the estimate
of the effect across the studies for each outcome evaluated
and subgroup assessed, and the effect seems to increase over
time, especially for manipulation therapy.
Strengths and limitations
This review had several strengths, including (1) the in-
volvement of an ISC to contribute to the question development
and the population, intervention, control/comparator and
outcome (PICO) framework, as well as to provide guidance
throughout the review with an EAC; (2) the use of a system-
atic, explicit, and transparent methodology, incorporating the
evaluation of internal validity (risk of bias), external and model
validity, meta-analysis according to patient reported out-
comes, and GRADE framework applied to determine the
overall quality of evidence for each critical outcome evalu-
ated; and (3) an independent methodological review team to
carry out each of the technical steps involved in the review
phases. None of the study authors reported any conflict of
interests.
The current search, scoping review, and analysis lever-
age previous efforts and add to the literature by including both
manipulation and mobilization interventions not only in chi-
ropractic settings but also in other non-invasive therapy settings
such as osteopathy, manual therapy, and physical therapy. Our
approach also addresses the complexity of chronicity and non-
specificity for populations being studied. We attempted to sort
the literature in the most homogeneous fashion, predefining
eligibility criteria and specifying very precise definitions with
subject matter expertise to drive the systematic review.
However, clinical heterogeneity between study groups remains
a confounder. Indeed, this is not surprising since chronic pain
is a multifactorial condition associated with specific and non-
specific medical disorders. Non-specific chronic low back pain
is difficult to evaluate, and the nature of the pain and its un-
derlying pathophysiology are poorly understood. Therefore,
chronic non-specific pain, by definition, is heterogeneous. Ad-
equate assessment of pain and use of validated tools are
essential prerequisites of a successful pain treatment plan and
research study [109]. In addition, the styles, techniques, and
dosing or duration of treatment involving manipulation
and mobilization vary considerably, and what might work well
for one individual may not for another. Stakeholders, includ-
ing patients, need to be involved to help focus the research
on that which could be most impactful to them.
Conclusion
There is moderate-quality evidence that manipulation (ie,
thrust) interventions may produce small-moderate reduc-
tion in pain intensity compared with other active comparators
such as exercise. Thrust interventions are also likely to reduce
disability for patients compared with these active compara-
tor interventions. The effect seems to increase over time at
3 and 6 months follow-up. There is moderate-quality evi-
dence that mobilization (ie, non-thrust) interventions are likely
to have minimal effect compared with other active compara-
tors in terms of reducing pain intensity or disability.
Multimodal programs may be promising options. More re-
search is needed to assess other important patient reported
outcomes in order to strengthen the evidence base regard-
ing mobilization and manipulation for reducing disability and
increasing HRQoL for patients with chronic low back pain.
The research to date is still heterogeneous, and questions
remain about optimal treatment duration, dose require-
ments, practitioners to be involved, and the kinds of patients
who may benefit the most.
