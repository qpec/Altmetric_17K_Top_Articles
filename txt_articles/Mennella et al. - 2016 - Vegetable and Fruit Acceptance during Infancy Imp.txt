ABSTRACT
Many of the chronic illnesses that plague modern society derive in large part from poor food choices. Thus, it is not surprising that the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, aimed at the population $2 y of age, recommends limiting consumption of salt, fat, and simple sugars, all of which have
sensory properties that we humans find particularly palatable, and increasing the variety and contribution of fruits and vegetables in the diet, to
promote health and prevent disease. Similar recommendations may soon be targeted at even younger Americans: the B-24 Project, led by the US
Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA, is currently evaluating evidence to include infants and children from birth to 2 y of age in
the dietary guidelines. This article reviews the underinvestigated behavioral phenomena surrounding how to introduce vegetables and fruits into
infants’ diets, for which there is much medical lore but, to our knowledge, little evidence-based research. Because the chemical senses are the major
determinants of whether young children will accept a food (e.g., they eat only what they like), these senses take on even greater importance in
understanding the bases for food choices in children. We focus on early life, in contrast with many other studies that attempt to modify food habits
in older children and thus may miss sensitive periods that modulate long-term acceptance. Our review also takes into consideration ontogeny and sources
of individual differences in taste perception, in particular, the role of genetic variation in bitter taste perception. Adv Nutr 2016;7(Suppl):211S–9S.

Introduction
Many of the chronic illnesses that plague modern society de-
rive in large part from poor food choices. To promote health
and prevent disease through diet and nutrition, the most re-
cent Dietary Guidelines for Americans (1) and the US De-
partment of Health and Human Services’ newest 10-y
national objective, Healthy People 2020 (2), recommend,
in part, limiting consumption of salt, fat, and simple sugars,
all of which have sensory properties that we humans find
particularly palatable, and increasing the variety and contri-
bution of fruits and vegetables in the diets of the population
$2 y of age [Nutrition and Weight Status Goals 14 and
15 (2)]. Similar recommendations may soon be targeted at
even younger Americans: the B-24 Project, led by the De-
partment of Health and Human Services Office of Disease Pre-
vention and Health Promotion and the USDA’s Center for
Nutrition Program and Policy, is currently evaluating the evi-
dence base to support including infants and children from
birth to 2 y of age in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (3).
Why the focus on fruits and vegetables? Not only are they im-
portant sources of a wide range of vital micronutrients that are
underconsumed by many, but evidence suggests that increased
consumption of these foods can reduce the risks of a number
of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and certain
cancers (4). Increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet can also
aid in weight management for children and adults (5–9), espe-
cially when these foods are substituted for more energy-dense
foods in the diet (10, 11). However, despite the recommenda-
tions of health authorities worldwide, people and even young
children eat too much salt, fat, and simple sugars and too few
fruits and vegetables (12), although fruits continue to be more
accepted by children than green vegetables (12–15).

 patterns of American children, revealed that 1 in 3 infants
between the ages of 6 and 8.9 mo and 1 in 5 infants between
the ages of 9 and 11.9 mo did not consume any fruit or veg-
etable on a given day. By 1 y of age, the top fruits and veg-
etables were not baby food but rather fresh or canned,
indicating that children who eat these foods are making
the appropriate transition to fruits and vegetables at the table
(16). However, not 1 of the top 5 vegetables eaten was a dark
green vegetable (12, 13, 16). Instead, young children were
more likely consuming potatoes, sweet- and salty-tasting
snacks, and sweetened beverages (12, 13), a dietary pattern
similar to that observed in older children (18–21).
For older children, fruits are more accepted than vegetables,
and some progress has been made in recent years (14): total
fruit intake among children increased between 2003–2004
and 2009–2010 because of increases in whole fruit consump-
tion (i.e., all fruit excluding juice). Over this time period, fruit
juice intake (i.e., 100% juice, foods, and other beverages) also
decreased. However, total vegetable intake did not change
during this period. It is important to note that no sociode-
mographic group met the Healthy People 2020 target con-
sumption for vegetables, and only children between the ages
of 2 and 5 y met the target for fruits.
In this article, we review the ontogeny of the chemical
senses, one of the major determinants of whether young
children will initially accept or reject a food, and how chil-
dren learn to like a food more. Because young children eat
only what they like (22), these senses take on even greater
importance in understanding the bases for food acceptance
during childhood. We also review the underinvestigated be-
havioral phenomena surrounding how to introduce vegeta-
bles and fruits into infants’ diets, for which there is much
medical lore (23, 24) but, to our knowledge, little evidence-
based research (23, 25). Our focus is on early life, in contrast
with many other studies that attempt to modify food habits in
older children and thus may miss sensitive periods that mod-
ulate long-term acceptance.
Current Status of Knowledge
The biology of flavor and chemical sensing. Flavor, a pow-
erful determinant of human ingestive behavior, is a product
of several sensory systems, most notably those of taste and
smell (odors perceived retronasally). The anatomically inde-
pendent flavor senses are well developed at birth and con-
tinue to change throughout childhood and adolescence,
serving as gatekeepers by controlling one of the most impor-
tant decisions an animal makes: whether to eat something or
reject it [see Forestell and Mennella (26) for review].
Experimental research conducted during the past century
has repeatedly revealed that children live in different “taste”
worlds than do adults. Early in life they have sensory systems
that detect and prefer the once rare calorie- and mineral-rich
foods that taste sweet or salty while rejecting the potentially
toxic ones that taste bitter. However, there are age-related
changes in taste perception and preference such that the re-
warding properties of sweet and salty and the aversive prop-
erties of bitter are more pronounced during childhood and
adolescence, changing to resemble the adult pattern around
midadolescence (27–30). The following sections focus on
age-related changes in sweet, salty, and bitter tastes because,
to our knowledge, little research has focused on such changes
in the other basic tastes of sour [but see Liem and Mennella
(31, 32) and Liem and de Graaf (33)] and umami.
That the ability to detect sweet tastes is functioning and
interacting with systems controlling effect is evident early
in life (34, 35), presumably because it attracts children to
the predominant taste quality of mother’s milk and it is
our biological signal of calories (34, 36). Within hours after
birth, newborns differentiate varying degrees of sweetness
and consume more of a sugar solution than water (37).
When a sweet solution is placed in the oral cavity, infants re-
lax the face and sometimes smile (38). Both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies have revealed that preferences
for sweets remain heightened throughout childhood
(28) and early adolescence, declining to adult levels during
midadolescence (28, 39). The taste of sugars is not just
liked by children; tasting something sweet can also blunt
expressions of pain (40, 41). The more children like sweets,
the better its analgesic properties.
Similar age-related changes have also been observed for
salty taste. Although the ability to detect salt does not emerge
until infancy, children prefer more concentrated salt solu-
tions and saltier foods than do adults. Preferences for salt
and sweet are not only elevated during childhood but also
are related to each other (42), as well as to how much the
child is growing: children who are growing, as evidenced
by higher levels of a biomarker for bone growth, prefer
sweeter and saltier solutions (42, 43).
As much as children like sweet and salty flavors, they ini-
tially reject all that tastes bitter. Shortly after birth, babies re-
ject bitter-tasting substances, as evidenced by decreased
intake and pronounced facial expressions (44, 45). In other
words, they can detect and respond accordingly to bitter
tastes. Of all the taste qualities, bitter taste perception is
the most varied across individuals (46). We posit that the in-
dividual differences in acceptance of vegetables may arise
from genetic differences among infants, although this
body of research has focused on how bitter taste perception
of vegetables relates to variation in taste receptor genotype in
adults (47) or how vegetable intake relates to individual dif-
ferences in bitter taste perception among older children
(48), but not among infants.
There has been major progress toward identifying the ini-
tial events in taste recognition, and new light has been shed
on the molecular mechanisms underlying why children and
adults live in different sensory worlds and why some chil-
dren may be more accepting of some bitter tastes than are
other children (49, 50). For example, because of genotype dif-
ferences, some individuals are more sensitive to the bitter taste
of some vegetables (47, 51) and are thus less likely to eat these
foods (47, 52, 53). Genetically based differences in receptors for
bitter taste are particularly well known for the related bitter
compounds phenylthiocarbamide and 6-n-propylthiouracil
(PROP); some people can detect these at low concentrations,
212S

 but others need much higher concentrations or cannot de-
tect at all (54, 55).
Because people perceive taste-active chemicals differently,
they also perceive the tastes of foods differently. Although
many bitter receptor genes have alleles that affect bitter per-
ception (56), their role in food preferences has not been fully
explored. Perhaps most is known about the taste receptor,
type 2, member 38 (TAS2R38) gene, which is related to
the ability to taste PROP and phenylthiocarbamide, codes
for 1 member of the family of 25 taste receptors that respond
to bitter stimuli (55). Some vegetables contain phenylthio-
carbamide-like glucosinolates (e.g., turnips and broccoli)
(47); the different TAS2R38 alleles correlate with differences
in perceptions of bitter intensity of these vegetables (47, 51).
We investigated whether age modified the genotype-
phenotype relations in the TAS2R38 gene and bitter taste
sensitivity of PROP (27, 57). Like the age-related changes in
sweet and salt preference, children become less sensitive to
some bitter tastes with age. Not only does PROP sensitivity
vary with age but children heterozygous for a TAS2R38 vari-
ant perceived a bitter taste at lower PROP concentrations than
did adults who were heterozygous (27, 57), with intermediate
thresholds for heterozygous adolescents (27). In other words,
childhood may be a time of heightened bitter sensitivity for
many children, and such sensitivity may affect food accep-
tance. Because bitter sensitivity has been shown to be related
to taste acceptance of certain vegetables in both children
[those less sensitive to bitter flavors are more accepting or per-
ceive less bitterness than those who are more bitter sensitive
(53, 58–60)] and adults (47, 51, 61, 62), research is currently
under way in our laboratory to determine whether variations
in the TAS2R38 genotype contribute to individual differences
in infants’ initial liking of cruciferous vegetables, as well as the
number of repeated exposures needed to develop a liking for
these foods during infancy.
It is interesting to note, from a culinary perspective, that
the 2 tastes that are most preferred (i.e., salty and sweet) can
block or mask bitter taste for children and adults (63, 64).
For sodium salts, the efficacy of blocking bitter tastes depends
on both the age of the subject and the chemical nature of the
blocker and bitter agent, and its site of action appears to be at
the receptor level in the periphery. Although there was varia-
tion among individuals and among bitter agents in the ability
of sucrose to suppress bitterness, for some people and for
some compounds sucrose is an unequivocally effective masker
of bitter taste, and for some bitter agents it worked better than
sodium salts (64, 65). A clinical study of school-age children
showed that the addition of dilute solutions of the nonnutri-
tive sweetener aspartame to the vegetables decreased children’s
perception of the bitterness and increased their liking of the
vegetables (66) [see also Sharafi et al. (65)].
In summary, our basic biology does not predispose children
to favor the recommended low-sugar, low-sodium, vegetable-
rich diets and makes them especially vulnerable to our current
food environment high in salt and refined sugars. Thus,
the struggle parents have in modifying their children’s
diets to reduce added sugars and salt appears to have a
strong biological basis. However, as discussed in the fol-
lowing sections, the senses that underlie flavor perception
are “plastic” and can be modified by early experience,
suggesting new, research-based strategies to improve
children’s diets.
Learning about foods: amniotic fluid and mother’s milk.
Although innate taste likes and dislikes may create an obsta-
cle to healthy eating by children, early experiences can teach
children (like other mammalian young) what foods are safe
and part of the culinary traditions of their family. During the
past few decades, our research program and others have sys-
tematically studied the transfer of dietary volatiles to amni-
otic fluid and human milk to determine its effects on the
behavior of breastfed infants [see Mennella (67) for review].
This research has revealed that a wide variety of flavors ei-
ther ingested (e.g., fruits, vegetables, alcohol, and spices)
or inhaled (e.g., tobacco) by the mother are transmitted to
her amniotic fluid and/or milk (67–76). In general, the in-
tensity of the flavor in milk increased within hours after con-
sumption. That amniotic fluid and breast milk share flavor
profiles with foods eaten by the mother suggests that breast
milk “bridges” experiences with flavors in utero and those in
solid foods (77). These variations in flavor from mother to
mother and from feeding to feeding suggest that breastfeeding,
unlike formula feeding, provides the infant with the potential
for a rich source of sensory variety. The types and intensity of
flavors experienced may be unique for each infant and charac-
teristic of the culinary traditions of the family. These are the
foods their mothers eat (78, 79) and will be the foods that their
mothers will feed them as they grow. This is the first way, but
not the only way, we learn about flavors of the foods of the
family, culture, and environment.
During the first year of life, infants make the important
transition from an all-milk diet to one containing solid
foods; thus, like other mammals, developmental processes
must ensure that they learn both what and how to eat (67,
80). To determine how pre- and postnatal flavor experiences
affect liking of flavors at weaning in humans, to our knowl-
edge, we conducted the first randomized clinical trial in
which we assigned pregnant women who planned to
breastfeed their infants to groups that differed in whether
and when they drank carrot juice (81). One group of women
was randomly assigned to drink carrot juice for several days
per week during the last trimester of pregnancy; another
group was randomly assigned to drink carrot juice for a sim-
ilar time period during the first 3 mo of lactation, whereas
the control group drank water and avoided carrots and car-
rot juice during both pregnancy and lactation. When
mothers weaned their infants to solid foods, we tested their ac-
ceptance of plain cereal on 1 d and carrot-flavored cereal on an-
other day. Infants who experienced the flavor of carrots in either
amniotic fluid or mother’s milk responded more favorably (e.g.,
ate more and made fewer faces of distaste) to carrot-flavored
cereal than did nonexposed control infants.
Learning about foods through dietary transmitted flavors
in amniotic fluid and mother’s milk may be a fundamental

 feature of mammalian dietary learning (67). Such experiences
early in life may cause a variety of neurologic and physiologic
changes that influence later behaviors, and there is some ev-
idence that dietary learning is more pronounced during early
life (82). When mothers ate fruits or vegetables, infants expe-
rienced the flavors in amniotic fluid and then mother’s milk,
which, in turn, increased the palatability of these foods by
their infants. Animal models show that early experiences
with retronasally perceived odors (flavors) in milk result in
enhanced detection of these learned odors that in nature
would facilitate selection of foods that mothers find palatable.
Not only does breastfeeding confer an initial advantage to
babies in their acceptance of fruits and vegetables when these
foods are part of the maternal diet, but this continuity in fla-
vor helps the infant transition to solid foods.
This pattern makes evolutionary sense because the foods
that a mother eats when she is pregnant and nursing are the
flavors associated with nutritious foods or, at the very least,
with foods the mother has access to and, hence, the foods to
which the child will have the earliest exposure. Because food
habits established during infancy track into later childhood
and adolescence (79, 83), early experiences with nutritious
foods and flavor variety should maximize the chance that, as
infants grow, they will enjoy a more healthy diet because
they like the taste. Because mothers typically feed children
foods that are part of their own diet and culture, the breastfed
infant continues to learn the flavors of the foods they will be
offered. Sensory experiences with food flavors in mother’s
milk in children whose mothers eat a varied diet may explain
why children who were breastfed tend to be less picky and
more willing to try new foods during childhood (84).
Learning about foods: repeated exposure and dietary
variety. Learning about foods and flavors continues after
weaning because experiences can modify liking of fruits
and vegetables (25). As summarized in Table 1, through
basic research we have discovered that regardless of whether
infants are breastfed, formula fed, or both, once they are

 weaned to solid foods acceptance of fruits and vegetables
can be facilitated by different types of early dietary experi-
ences (85–92). The vast majority of this research uses a
within-subject design and evaluates the infant’s acceptance
by a variety of measures, including intake, facial reactivity,
and maternal perceptions, using an infant-led feeding par-
adigm both immediately before and after the exposure pe-
riod, which typically lasts 8–10 d [see Forestell and Mennella
(86, 90) for review of methodologies).
One type of experience entails repeated exposure to a
particular vegetable or fruit for 8–10 d (85–87, 89) or longer
(94). Like children (95), infants ate more of the fruit or veg-
etable to which they were repeatedly exposed. Merely look-
ing at the food does not appear to be sufficient; children
have to experience the flavor and taste of the fruit or vege-
table to learn to like it (96, 97). Through use of the Facial
Action Coding System (98), which measures the contraction
of individual facial muscles that change the appearance of
the face and is an indicator of liking or disliking (99), we
found that facial expressions became less negative after re-
peated dietary experience with a particular food, and in
some cases mothers judged that their infants enjoyed the
foods more after the exposure (86, 89, 90).
As shown in Figure 1, eating fruits and vegetables acti-
vates distinct, stereotyped motor behaviors of the orofacial
region, which provide insights into the hedonic response
to the taste of the food (e.g., liking). There were individual
differences in the display of these facial expressions while
eating that, in some cases, predicted the rate at which infants
ate a particular food (86). For example, repeated exposure to
green beans and/or peaches modified intake but only those
who experienced peaches after green beans appeared to like
the taste of the green beans more after the 8-d exposure. We
hypothesize that the sweet taste of peaches masked some of
the bitterness of the green beans, increasing its palatability
and liking (64). When vegetables are fed alone (without
the masking of the fruit), it takes longer (>8 d) for the
face to change than changes in intake (86, 89). In other
words, measures of liking and of intake are related but are
governed by separate neural substrates (100) and, conse-
quently, do not always change in tandem (100, 101). This
suggests that mothers should be encouraged to focus on
their infants’ willingness to eat a food, not just the facial ex-
pressions made during feeding (86, 102). They should also
be made aware that with repeated dietary exposure, it may
take longer to observe changes in facial expressions than
changes in intake [see Paul et al. (93)].
A second type of dietary experience involves experiencing
a variety of flavors rather than any one specific food or fla-
vor. Infants who were repeatedly exposed to different vege-
tables on alternate days not only ate more of the vegetables
to which they were exposed but also ate more of the novel
vegetables than did infants repeatedly exposed to only one
vegetable (87). That is, they also learn through repeated ex-
posure to a variety of such foods that vary in both flavor and
texture. This, in turn, promotes willingness to eat not only
the introduced foods but also other, novel foods. Exposing
infants to multiple sensory contrasts (between- and within-
meal flavor variety) provided more opportunities to develop
flavor preferences, perhaps based on postingestive reinforc-
ing effects of nutritious foods.
Further study revealed a wide range of individual differ-
ences in vegetable acceptance by infants (90) relating to their
1) exposure—those who had been eating vegetables over the
previous weeks displayed fewer facial expressions of distaste,
and 2) temperament—those who were more approaching
ate more of the green beans for a longer time and showed
fewer facial expressions of distaste. Mothers were sensitive
to certain facial behaviors expressed during feeding, which
affected their judgments of their infants’ liking of the food.
Such findings are consistent with research in older chil-
dren (103, 104). Although vegetables in particular are
most cited by children as being a food they do not like
(105), children can continue to learn to like these foods,
but it is a more difficult task as they grow older (106,
107), perhaps because they refuse to taste these foods and

 therefore cannot learn to like them. We cannot underesti-
mate the role of the caregivers because they feed their chil-
dren what they themselves are eating [see also Worobey et al.
(108), Birch et al. (109), Savage et al. (110), and Hart et al.
(111)]. One strategy is to have caregivers try eating more
fruits and vegetables because children whose mothers were
instructed to do so tried more vegetables (112). In addition,
the more fruits and vegetables eaten by the mother, the more
likely their child followed their lead (108). Also, in a child-
care setting, providing a variety of vegetables and fruits
may not only lead to increased consumption of these foods
by children but also increase the sensory experiences needed
to learn to like these foods (113).
Conclusions
The period from birth to 24 mo of age is a time of rapid de-
velopment, including feeding behavior. Emerging evidence
suggests that individual patterns of food preferences and eat-
ing behaviors emerge and differ depending on the foods of-
fered and the contexts of feeding during this early period of
dietary transition. For many children, by the time they reach
2 y of age, they have essentially completed the transition to
“table foods” and are consuming diets similar to those of
other family members.
Research has shown that as children make this transition,
early experiences with nutritious foods and flavor variety
may maximize the likelihood that they will choose a healthier
diet because they like the tastes and variety of the foods it con-
tains. These foods need to be part of the family’s diet and food
environment so that once the preference develops, the child
continues to be exposed to the actual food to maintain the
preference, learning to like more complicated flavors and tex-
tures (114). Ultimately, the goal is to gradually familiarize chil-
dren to a varied diet that meets nutritional needs for growth
and development and provides them with opportunities
to learn to like and prefer a variety of healthy foods.
The task ahead is challenging and there is not going to
be just one solution to the problem, especially for those
children who do not have their first taste of vegetables un-
til they enter school (115).
Although there are inborn responses to the basic tastes,
and some individuals may be more sensitive to some tastes
because of genotype, the development of these chemical
senses has inherent plasticity that interacts with early life ex-
periences to ensure a child is not genetically restricted to a
narrow range of foodstuffs [see Mennella (67) and Mennella
and Beauchamp (116) for review]. Beginning very early in
life, sensory experiences can shape and modify flavor and
food preferences (25, 117). Such functional plasticity, one
of the main characteristics of the brain, highlights the ability
to change behavior based on experience. In other words, our
biology is not necessarily our destiny. However, because con-
sumption of vegetables (and some fruits) is so low among
children and their family members, many children are de-
prived of the sensory experiences as well as parental and
peer modeling and the type of food environments needed
to learn to like these foods. In animal models, early taste
deprivation remodels the central nervous system (118),
whereas experience with bitterness during early life en-
hances liking of bitter taste in adulthood (119). We acknowl-
edge that although food neophobia in the older child is in
part a heritable trait (120, 121), we posit that the rejection
of certain types of foods, in particular bitter-tasting vegeta-
bles, in the infant also may be caused in part by heritability
of bitter taste sensitivity (not neophobia) and in the child, a
combination of heritable taste sensitivity as well as nonge-
netic (environmental) factors such as maternal feeding prac-
tices and lacking food environments (122, 123).
Because there is no consistent, evidence-based guidance for
caregivers who are feeding infants and toddlers [the current Di-
etary Guidelines are not intended to apply to Americans <2 y
of age (1)], research is needed to develop evidenced-based
strategies that take into account individual differences in ini-
tial acceptance of fruits and vegetables, to understand how
infants and toddlers develop the food preferences and the
self-regulatory processes necessary to promote healthy growth,
particularly in today’s food environment. We need to know
whether there are optimum times during the life span when
experience promotes greater liking of these and other healthy
foods and, conversely, when deprivation of such foods has the
greatest consequences on diet and health for generations to
come.
