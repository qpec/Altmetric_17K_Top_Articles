Introduction effective triage of patients with emergent 
large vessel occlusion (elVO) to endovascular therapy 
capable centers may decrease time to treatment and 
improve outcome for these patients. here we performed 
a derivation study to evaluate the accuracy of a portable, 
non-invasive, and easy to use severe stroke detector.
Methods The volumetric impedance phase shift 
spectroscopy (ViPs) device was used to assign a 
bioimpedance asymmetry score to 248 subjects across 
three cohorts, including 41 subjects presenting as 
acute stroke codes at a major comprehensive stroke 
center (csc), 79 healthy volunteers, and 128 patients 
presenting to cscs with a wide variety of brain 
pathology including additional stroke codes. Diagnostic 
parameters were calculated for the ability of the device 
to discern (1) severe stroke from minor stroke and (2) 
severe stroke from all other subjects. Patients with 
intracranial hardware were excluded from the analysis.
results The ViPs device was able to differentiate severe 
stroke from minor strokes with a sensitivity of 93% (95% 
ci 83 to 98), specificity of 92% (95% ci 75 to 99), and 
an area under the curve (aUc) of 0.93 (95% ci 0.85 to 
0.97). The device was able to differentiate severe stroke 
from all other subjects with a sensitivity of 93% (95% ci 
83 to 98), specificity of 87% (95% ci 81 to 92), and an 
aUc of 0.95 (95% ci 0.89 to 0.96).
Conclusion The ViPs device is a portable, non-invasive, 
and easy to use tool that may aid in the detection of 
severe stroke, including elVO, with a sensitivity of 93% 
and specificity of 92% in this derivation study. This 
device has the potential to improve the triage of patients 
suffering severe stroke.
INTroDuCTIoN
Endovascular therapy (EVT) has become the most 
effective treatment for patients with emergent 
large vessel occlusion (ELVO).1–5 The benefit of 
EVT, however, is highly time dependent, with each 
additional hour resulting in up to a 20% decreased 
chance of achieving a good outcome.6 7 With only 
10% of stroke centers capable of performing EVT, 
ELVO patients are often transferred from the 
primary hospital to an endovascular capable center 
after a delayed diagnosis, costing these patients an 
average of 110 additional minutes, increasing their 
chance of mortality, and substantially decreasing 
their chance of a good functional outcome.7–9
In 2017, the American Heart Association and 
American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) Mission: 
Lifeline Stroke Committee produced a severity 
based stroke triage algorithm for EMS. This recom-
mends travel directly to a thrombectomy capable 
stroke center for patients who test positive with 
a prehospital stroke screening tool and stroke 
severity tool, as long as this does not add more 
than 15 
minutes of additional transport time. Such 
a strict additional transport time restriction is in 
part the result of the high false positive rate and 
poor accuracy of clinical examination based stroke 
severity scales.10 11
Prehospital triage of patients suffering myocardial 
infarction (MI) to centers capable of performing 
percutaneous intervention posed similar challenges 
in the 1990s. Portable ECG with focus on ST eleva-
tion as a predictor of MI became the major prehos-
pital diagnostic tool with a sensitivity of 69% and 
a specificity of 81%.12 This test must be performed 
and results sent to interventional capable hospitals 
within 10 
minutes of emergency personnel arrival 
on the scene. A technology that could achieve 
similar speed, sensitivity, and specificity for ELVO 
would have the potential to likewise improve the 
rapidity of care for stroke. The volumetric imped-
ance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cere-
brotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, California, 
USA) experienced initial positive findings with a 
pilot study performed on stroke alerts at a single 
center, which demonstrated 86% sensitivity and 
77% specificity for ELVO in that preliminary highly 
ELVO enriched cohort. Here we assessed the poten-
tial of the VIPS device to function as an easy to use, 
portable, fast, and safe non-invasive severe stroke 
detector across a broad group of diverse diagnoses, 
generated from the pilot cohort, the VIPS for the 
Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimped-
ance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) 
cohort (a wide range of brain pathologies), and a 
cohort of normal controls.
MeThoDs
study population
Prospective data for this analysis were gathered 
across three cohorts, including a single center pilot 
cohort, a cohort of healthy normal subjects, and 
the multicenter VITAL study. The pilot study was 
performed at a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) 
and consisted of patients presenting or transferred 
from a satellite hospital with symptoms consistent 
with acute ischemic stroke being evaluated for 
possible endovascular therapy. The initial analysis 
of the pilot population generated a sensitivity of 
86% and a specificity of 77% for ELVO, which

led to subsequent efforts to obtain data across a broader popu-
lation, which is presented herein with this combined analysis. 
The healthy cohort consisted of normal volunteers who had no 
history of stroke, brain tumor, brain surgery, significant head 
trauma, or implanted medical devices in the head or neck, and 
had no metallic craniofacial implants. The VITAL study consisted 
of a diverse patient population presenting to one of five CSCs 
and undergoing neuroimaging for any brain pathology or neuro-
logic presentation. In both the pilot study and the VITAL study, 
screening was performed on arrival to the main hospital by 
study coordinators in communication with the evaluating neuro-
interventionalist. Patients had to have neuroimaging within 
30 
minutes of the VIPS device reading. Patients were excluded 
if they were found to have implanted medical devices or metal 
in the head or neck. All patients enrolled in the pilot study and 
the VITAL study were scanned by a study coordinator or investi-
gator after arrival at the hospital conducting the study.
The study was approved by the institutional review board of 
each institution, and consent was obtained for all study subjects.
Volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy
VIPS is a non-invasive technology capable of detecting a 
bioimpedance signature across a bodily tissue. The VIPS device 
functions by transmitting an array of varying frequencies of low 
energy radio waves from each side of the back of the head to 
a receiver in the forehead portion of the visor. Radio waves 
of different frequencies are modified differently as they pass 
through the tissue, depending on the type and fluid proper-
ties of the tissue, producing a unique signature for varied brain 
pathologies. VIPS exploits the alterations in tissue electrical 
properties that occur as a result of fluid and electrolyte changes. 
For example, in a region of the brain that is ischemic due to an 
ELVO, arterial blood content is diminished and the distribution 
of fluids and electrolytes between the intracellular, extracellular, 
and intravascular spaces may be substantially shifted. These 
alterations result in a change in the tissue bioimpedance. Because 
acute stroke typically affects the hemispheres unequally, ELVO 
induces an asymmetry in the bioimpedance of the brain. The 
larger the fluid and electrolyte changes in the affected cerebral 
region (ie, the larger the stroke), the greater the bioimpedance 
asymmetry. The VIPS device has two transmitters located toward 
the back of the head and biased to each side, and one receiver 
positioned in front of the forehead. This allows the device to 
measure the bioimpedance of each brain hemisphere separately, 
making it sensitive to asymmetries, such as those caused by an 
ELVO. It should be noted that there is not a specific, single 
bioimpedence asymmetry number that is generated by the tech-
nology, but rather bioimpedance values on each side across a 
spectrum of frequencies. This information is then analyzed with 
a proprietary algorithm to develop the final result that we refer 
to in this manuscript as ‘mean bioimpedence asymmetry’. The 
goal of this derivation study was to classify patients according 
to imaging and clinical criteria and then use those classifications 
to guide analysis of the raw dataset, using machine learning, to 
create the analysis algorithm that eventually provides the final 
mean bioimpedence asymmetry.
Device safety and regulatory status
The VIPS device is non-invasive and can be used when placed on 
the head, like a visor. The transmitter and receiver antennae are 
enclosed inside plastic housings and do not contact the subject. 
The radiated power has been tested and is extremely low: the 
power density is at least eight times lower than the safety limits 
set by the Federal Communications Commission and recognized 
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The device also 
meets all relevant requirements of the International Electrotech-
nical Commission general standard 61 
601. The device is cleared 
by the FDA for distribution in the USA, and is CE marked for 
distribution in the European Union.
Device use
Only study personnel applied the device. Device training was 
performed by Cerebrotech at each participating center and 
consisted of a short presentation followed by two mock device 
applications per study coordinator or investigator. The device 
is placed on the subject’s head, resting on the ears and forehead 
(figure 1). The device communicates with a laptop by Bluetooth. 
The operator then activates the device from the laptop. Each 
reading takes 5 
s and three readings are performed. The results 
of the three readings are combined, and the entire scan takes 
about 30 
s to complete. If the device is not able to acquire a 
sufficient reading due to poor positioning, instructions to repeat 
the testing appear. Device usage is demonstrated in the accompa-
nying video (see online supplementary video 1).
‘severe stroke’ criteria
Prior to data analysis, a panel of experienced stroke physicians, 
including non-interventional stroke neurologists, interventional 
neurosurgeons and radiologists, and critical care neurologists, 
many of whom are part of Cerebrotech’s SAB, were surveyed 
by Cerebrotech to identify brain pathology subtypes that they 
agreed would merit severe stroke triage to a CSC and therefore 
receive the label ‘severe stroke.’ These neurological processes 
include ELVO (internal carotid artery (ICA), M1, or M2 occlu-
sions), severe intracranial or extracranial stenosis with concur-
rent acute National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 
scores ≥6 (luminal narrowing of 70–99% 
and more likely to 
require acute intervention due to symptomatic flow failure), 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) ≥60 mL (more likely to decom-
pensate and require emergent neurosurgical intervention, 
including hemicraniectomy, clot evacuation, and/or CSF diver-
sion), 13–16 and large established territorial strokes (including

territory of at least one major arterial division). All ELVOs were 
included in the definition of severe stroke because even patients 
with a low NIHSS score and ELVO may benefit from immediate 
triage to a thrombectomy capable center, given the high propor-
tion (up to 41%) of these patients who ultimately decompensate 
and require immediate intervention.17 These initial surveys were 
driven by the pilot experience.
Brain pathology that does not merit highly time sensitive triage 
includes acute small strokes (strokes that are not ELVOs and do 
not have established territorial infarcts), ICH <60 mL, tumors, 
established non-territorial strokes, stroke mimics, including 
seizure and metabolic causes, subdural hematomas, subarach-
noid hemorrhages, and subjects with no pathology. Patients 
with intracranial implants were excluded from analysis due to 
hardware interference with the device recording. Scans were 
managed by the CRO and reviewed by a panel of stroke neuro-
interventionalists (one radiologist and two neurosurgeons) who 
were blinded to the patients’ final asymmetry scores. It should be 
noted that, as this was a derivation study, initial clinical presen-
tation and early direction of asymmetry were available to the 
review panel. This was important, and by design, in order to 
allow assessment of the technology’s ability to identify, or not 
identify, the broad disease subtypes scanned, which is critical for 
a derivation study.
Diagnostic evaluation
Mean bioimpedance asymmetry (MBA) was calculated for all 
patients. An MBA threshold was identified to maximize the diag-
nostic ability of the device to differentiate subjects with severe 
stroke from subjects without severe stroke (as defined a priori 
above). Diagnostic characteristics were calculated, including 
sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), positive like-
lihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive predictive value, 
and negative predictive value. Diagnostic characteristics were 
calculated for the ability of the device to differentiate subjects 
qualifying for severe stroke among all strokes. Diagnostic char-
acteristics were then calculated for the ability of the device to 
differentiate between subjects qualifying for severe stroke among 
all evaluable subjects.
Comparison with existing diagnostic methods
The NIHSS was performed by a medical professional or clinical 
coordinator accredited to perform the examination at the time 
of device evaluation on all enrolled subjects. Commonly used 
prehospital ELVO triage scales, including the Prehospital Acute 
Stroke Severity Scale (PASS), the 3 item Stroke Scale (3ISS), and 
the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Severity Scale (CinPSS), were 
applied on the entire test cohort and compared with the VIPS 
device. False negative rates and false positive rates were calcu-
lated for the accuracy of the test to diagnose subjects suffering 
acute brain pathology qualifying for severe stroke triage among 
all stroke patients.
resuLTs
subject population
A total of 252 subjects were enrolled across the three cohorts, 
of whom 248 were included in this dataset (79 healthy controls, 
41 subjects from the pilot study, and 128 VITAL subjects). 
Among the four excluded subjects, two were from the pilot 
cohort and two were from the VITAL cohort. Of these, two 
were excluded due to metallic objects in the hair and two due 
to device data that were corrupted. Additionally, 13 subjects, all 
from the VITAL cohort, were removed from data analysis due 
to the presence of cranial metallic hardware and/or a history of 
craniotomy. Therefore, 235 subjects were included in the final 
analyzed study population. The average age was 62 years and 
45% of the subjects were men (table 1). The entire analysis 
included 57 subjects with brain pathology classified as severe 
stroke. These 57 consisted of 41 subjects with ELVO, including 
25 with ICA or M1 occlusions and 16 with M2 occlusions. 
There were four subjects with established territorial strokes, 10 
subjects with severe stenosis/near occlusion with a concomitant 
NIHSS score ≥6, and two subjects with ICH ≥60 
mL. There 
were 26 subjects with small ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, 
including 16 subjects with small ischemic strokes, 10 with ICH 
<60 
mL, five with established non-territorial strokes, eight with 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, one with subdural hematoma, four 
with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, three with seizures, six 
with tumors, 46 with miscellaneous non-lesional pathology, and 
79 un-imaged healthy controls with no related medical history.
Mean bioimpedance asymmetry
MBA for subjects qualifying for severe stroke (n=57) was 16.5% 
(95% CI 14.6 to 18.4) while MBA for subjects with small strokes 
(n=26) was 8.0% (95% CI 6.9 to 9.0) and MBA for healthy 
control subjects (n=79) was 5.0% (95%CI 4.5 to 5.5) (table 2).

subjects with severe stroke from subjects suffering small strokes.
Diagnostic characteristics
Initially, diagnostic characteristics were calculated for the 
device’s ability to differentiate subjects with severe stroke from 
subjects with small strokes. In this group, the device performed 
with a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 83 to 98), specificity of 92% 
(95% CI 75 to 99), and an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) 
(table 3, figure 2). Secondly, diagnostic characteristics were 
calculated for the device’s ability to differentiate subjects with 
severe stroke from all other tested subjects in the pooled anal-
ysis. In this group, the device performed with a sensitivity of 
93% (95% CI 83 to 98), specificity of 87% (95% CI 81 to 92), 
and an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.96) (table 3, figure 3).
evaluation of existing diagnostic methods
The false negative rate and false positive rate for the device’s 
ability to differentiate subjects with severe stroke from other 
subjects suffering a stroke were 7% and 8%, respectively. False 
negative rates for the NIHSS, PASS, 3ISS, and CinPSS were 
also calculated for the ability of each of these tests to differen-
tiate subjects with severe stroke from other subjects suffering a 
stroke, and resulted in 21%, 21%, 25%, and 25% respectively 
(figure 4). Sensitivity for these assessment tools to differentiate 
subjects with severe stroke from other subjects suffering a stroke 
were 79%, 79%, 75%, and 75%, respectively, while specificity 
was 71%, 75%, 63%, and 71%, respectively.
DIsCussIoN
This study demonstrates that a novel non-invasive device can 
rapidly acquire physiological data that may yield high sensitivity 
and specificity for detection of severe stroke. Stroke treatment 
systems of care have been designed for the past 20 years around 
rapid administration of tissue plasminogen activator.18 Now with 
level 1a evidence in support of thrombectomy for ELVO, we are 
charged with the task of triaging ELVO patients to thrombec-
tomy capable centers as accurately and quickly as possible.19 Data 
suggest that approximately 75% of ELVO patients are denied a 
chance at thrombectomy due to delays in triage.20Patients who 
are transferred from one hospital to another have longer revascu-
larization times, worse Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores 
at the time of treatment, and suffer worse outcomes.7 8 The ideal 
diagnostic test to improve patient triage would be portable, fast, 
require minimal specialized training, pose no additional risks to 
the patient, perform in a reproducible and accurate manner, and 
be low cost such that it could be widely adopted in all ambu-
lances to integrate into our current triage system. This is the first 
formal study evaluating a device with the potential to satisfy all 
of these characteristics.
Current technology for triage
Current triage efforts consist mainly of neurological assessment 
tools based on the physical examination but these are highly user 
dependent and even in the best of testing conditions fall short of 
sufficient diagnostic accuracy. The most widely used and studied are 
the 3ISS, Los Angeles Motor Score (LAMS), Rapid Arterial Occlu-
sion Evaluation Scale (RACE), CinPSS, Field Assessment Stroke 
T
riage for Emergency Destination (FAST-ED), and PASS.21–26 The 
scales focus on different elements of the neurological examination, 
with some emphasizing accuracy while others emphasize reproduc-
ibility and ease of use. The diagnostic accuracy remains low, with 
reported sensitivities ranging from 55% to 85%, specificity from 
40% to 89%, and AUC from 0.73 to 0.78. Given the complexity 
of presentations associated with neurologic disease and the high 
rate of severe stroke mimics, scales that rely entirely on the neuro-
logic examination are inherently error prone and incapable of suffi-
ciently diagnosing severe stroke patients.27
Mobile stroke units have been adopted by some centers and 
present a viable although costly option for prehospital triage. A 
randomized trial published in 2012 demonstrated faster delivery 
of thrombolysis to appropriate patients with use of a mobile

eCG as a model technology for severe stroke triage
The current extreme need for a diagnostic tool for severe stroke 
triage parallels the historic need for and development of the 
ECG as a solution for the diagnosis of patients suffering acute MI 
(AMI).31 Not all hospitals perform percutaneous cardiac interven-
tion, and the improved diagnosis of AMI from ECG permitted 
improved triage to the correct center, which has shortened time 
to reperfusion and reduced mortality.32–35 With a mounting body 
of evidence in support of ECG, the 1996 AHA/ACC guidelines for 
AMI management were the first to recommend it.36 Current 2013 
guidelines recommend that emergency medicine services perform 
a 12 lead ECG in the ambulance for all patients with symptoms 
suggestive of AMI, with a level of evidence class 1B recommenda-
tion. In addition to bypassing non-percutaneous cardiac interven-
tion hospitals, systems of care developed around the use of ECG by 
improving preparation of the emergency department and interven-
tion teams prior to arrival of the patient.37 Receiving hospitals in 
systems using ECG were more able to perform within the guideline 
recommended 90 
minute time frame.38–40 The key feature of the 
ECG that established its efficacy as a prehospital diagnostic tool 
was the detection of an ST elevation as a predictor of AMI with a 
sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 81%.12
other devices undergoing testing for prehospital severe 
stroke triage
Multiple technologies have been proposed for stroke detection 
and are in various stages of prototype development and testing. 
Strokefinder MD100 (Medfield Diagnostics AB, Gothenburg, 
Sweden) is a microwave based technology made to fit on a 
stretcher and designed to detect intracranial hemorrhage. The 
device was used to differentiate patients with chronic subdural 
hematomas from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 100% and 
specificity of 75%.41 42 Transcranial Doppler based technology is 
also under investigation. Results of a pilot study performed by 
Neural Analytics (Los Angeles, California, USA) were presented 
as an abstract at the 26th European Stroke Conference, Berlin, 
May 2017, demonstrating sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 
86%, and AUC of 0.96, differentiating 17 patients with CT angi-
ography confirmed ELVO from 28 healthy controls.43 Data using 
the Neural Analytics Lucid System were presented at the 2017 
Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurologists. The authors 
reported 91% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and AUC of 0.94 in 
diagnosing ELVO among patients suspected of having a stroke. 
There are other start-up companies evaluating ultrasound, brain 
oxygenation asymmetry, and other technologies for prehospital 
diagnosis but these companies have not published data to date.
Future directions
This study has evaluated the VIPS device in a pooled analysis, 
including a healthy cohort, patients presenting as stroke codes 
to a CSC emergency department, and patients presenting with 
a wide range of brain pathology to multiple CSCs. These data 
permitted derivation of basic diagnostic parameters for the 
device in these patient populations. Future testing is necessary to 
validate this device as a diagnostic tool in specific patient popu-
lations and settings. With such a high diagnostic accuracy for 
severe stroke, other potential settings where triage is necessary 
might include locations with people at a higher than usual risk 
for stroke, such as nursing homes, in operations with increased 
stroke risk such as cardiothoracic surgery or carotid endarter-
ectomy, and settings removed from standard medical care, such 
as cruise ships, flights, and third world settings where neuroim-
aging is not readily available. As this study demonstrated, there 
is some variability, even in the healthy population. Attaining a 
pre-stroke baseline on an individual would improve the sensi-
tivity and specificity of the device even further if a severe stroke 
were to occur in that individual and the device were used. In 
its early iteration, the future cost of this device is not known 
but will be an important factor in determining its ability to be

adopted in multiple clinical settings. In addition, while the device 
has been calibrated to diagnose pathology likely requiring severe 
stroke triage, it is possible to vary device parameters to focus on 
different intracranial pathologies, widening the applicability of 
the technology beyond stroke triage.
Limitations
Certain important limitations should be considered in interpreting 
and applying the results of this study. First, this analysis pooled data 
from three cohorts with different selection criteria in order to obtain 
a broad range of potential brain conditions and thereby serve as a 
survey of the device’s response to various brain pathologies. The 
populations from each individual center were small, and certain 
subsets of brain pathology may have been more heavily represented 
by chance. It should also be emphasized that this was a derivation 
study, with the data being maximized to create the selection algo-
rithm. Validation of these results is necessary, particularly in the 
specific settings where this device might be used. Second, although 
a committee of stroke interventionalists agreed preemptively on 
brain pathology requiring severe stroke triage, thereby designating 
those with and without ‘severe stroke,’ some disagreement about 
which acute brain pathologies should be included on this list is 
inevitable and these definitions may continue to evolve. Third, the 
technology relies on the ability of the device to send and receive 
radio waves which can be modified by intracranial or extracranial 
metallic implants, such as titanium plates and screws or metallic 
hair extensions. Additional testing will be required to determine 
the applicability of this device in populations with metallic cranial 
implants. Lastly, while the VIPS algorithm was determined by inde-
pendent machine learning and while this study is, by design, a deri-
vation study wherein independent blinded verification of results on 
a novel population is not the desired method or result, it should 
be noted that the imaging review was supported by Cerebrotech 
through paid consultants who have a financial relationship with 
Cerebrotech. The resultant machine learning output and threshold 
derived from the data generated by their review was not available 
to them during their review, but it is important to consider that 
these contributors’ financial relationships may have indirectly 
affected the study outcome in an unanticipated way, despite the 
ultimate threshold and algorithm being determined independently.
Conclusions
Evaluation in a multicenter clinical derivation study has 
demonstrated that the VIPS device appears to accurately diag-
nose patients requiring severe stroke triage, including patients 
suffering from ELVO. The VIPS device is a portable, non-inva-
sive, and easy to use tool that may aid in the detection of severe 
stroke, including ELVO, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity 
of 92% in this derivation study. Additional validation studies are 
necessary to confirm these findings in specific patient popula-
tions and medical settings.
