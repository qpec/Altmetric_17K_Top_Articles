Abstract: The aim of the present work is to extensively evaluate the pharmaceutical attributes of 
currently available riluzole presentations. The article describes the limitations and risks associated 
with the administration of crushed tablets, including the potential for inaccurate dosing and reduced 
rate of absorption when riluzole is administered with high-fat foods, and the advantages that a 
recently approved innovative oral liquid form of riluzole confers on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) patients. The article further evaluates the patented and innovative controlled flocculation 
technology used in the pseudoplastic suspension formulation to reduce the oral anesthesia seen 
with crushed tablets, resulting in optimized drug delivery for riluzole. Riluzole is the only drug 
licensed for treating ALS, which is the most common form of motor neurone disease and a highly 
devastating neurodegenerative condition. The licensed indication is to extend life or the time to 
mechanical ventilation. Until recently, riluzole was only available as an oral tablet dosage form 
in the UK; however, an innovative oral liquid form, Teglutik® 5 mg/mL oral suspension, is now 
available. An oral liquid formulation provides an important therapeutic option for patients with 
ALS, 80% of who may become unable to swallow solid oral dosage forms due to disease-
related dysphagia. Prior to the launch of riluzole oral suspension, the only way for many patients 
to continue to take riluzole as their disease progressed was through crushed tablets. A novel 
suspension formulation enables more accurate dosing and consistent ongoing administration of 
riluzole. There are clear and important advantages such as enhanced patient compliance compared 
with crushed tablets administered with food or via an enteral feeding tube and the potential for 
an improved therapeutic outcome and enhanced quality of life for ALS patients.

Introduction
Background
The aim of the present work is to extensively evaluate the pharmaceutical attributes 
of currently available riluzole presentations.
Riluzole is the only drug licensed for use in the management of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neurone disease.1
ALS is a progressive, ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease, marked by a 
gradual degeneration of nerve cells of the central nervous system that control voluntary 
muscle movement. Degeneration of motor neurones is characterized by muscle 
weakness, typically impacting arms and legs, speech, swallowing and breathing. 
Impairment of swallowing (dysphagia) is a feature of ALS resulting from weakness or 
spasticity of muscles affecting the tongue, lips, palate, jaw, pharynx, larynx and upper 
trunk, causing difficulties for patients in the oral consumption of dry, tough-textured or 
crumbly food and thin liquids, although the specific nature of the difficulties depends 
on the patient’s individual clinical pathology.1

Destruction of nerve cells in motor neurone disease may 
be caused by excess glutamate (neurotransmitter) in the 
brain and spinal cord. Riluzole is a glutamate antagonist that 
reduces the release of glutamate, thus slowing the progres-
sion of the early disease.2 The burden of disease associated 
with poor patient compliance and a more rapid degenera-
tion of motor neurones upon patients, family members and 
caregivers is substantial, with increasing cost associated with 
increasing disability and the need for assisted medical care.2 
Riluzole 100 mg daily is a disease-specific therapy that has 
been shown to slow disease progression in patients with 
probable and definitive ALS with symptoms of 5 years. 
A median survival prolongation of up to 3 months has been 
shown in some patients in clinical studies.2 The same review 
article cited earlier observational studies, which suggested 
that treatment with riluzole may be associated with a delay 
in disease progression of up to 21 months.2
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) approved riluzole for use in motor neurone disease in 
2001, and the drug is freely available for diagnosed patients 
in the UK.3 Riluzole is also approved in the European Union 
and US for the treatment of ALS.
Challenges for ALS patients
More than 80% of ALS patients develop dysphagia, rendering 
the oral administration of riluzole tablets impossible.1,4 The 
inability of a patient to swallow a tablet formulation may result 
in poor patient compliance and early discontinuation of a life-
prolonging treatment. Swallowing dysfunction and dysphagia 
however is a challenge for oral drug therapy.5 Swallowing is a 
complex function involving several nerves and muscles acting 
in a synchronized reflex mode upon voluntary initiation.
Manipulation of a solid oral drug product by a patient 
or caregiver, for example, by crushing of tablets to aid 
administration or ingestion, increases the likelihood of 
medication errors and promotes the possibility of incorrect 
and incomplete dosing, changes in drug product perfor-
mance and safety concerns. It is important to recognize the 
potential consequences of manipulating a medicinal product. 
Changes to the way a dosage form is presented can impact its 
absorption characteristics, cause product instability, produce 
local irritant or anesthetic effects (particularly for riluzole), 
cause failure to reach the site of absorption, may produce 
occupational health and safety issues and could result in a 
preparation with an unacceptable taste and/or unpleasant 
mouthfeel.6 From a safety perspective, crushed tablets may 
expose carers or health care professionals to health risks 
due to dust inhalation, ingestion or non-oral absorption. 
Irritation may also arise as a consequence of powdered drug 
substance coming into contact with the skin, eyes or other 
mucous membranes.
National Health Service guidance for riluzole tablets 
states that tablets can be crushed and given in a spoonful of 
sugar, food puree or yoghurt, however that crushed tablets 
can have an anesthetic effect on the tongue.7 Such an undesir-
able and untoward side effect may result in a patient refusing 
or being unable to take his/her prescribed medication.
Crushing tablets for the purpose of administration via an 
enteral feeding tube typically falls outside of the scope of 
a marketing authorization. Under such circumstances, the 
prescriber and practitioner accept liability for any adverse 
events arising from administration. Potential issues of drug 
administration via an enteral feeding tube include cleanliness 
and infection control, tube blockage, incorrect or incomplete 
dosing and particularly in a community setting, safety of the 
carer. Applicable guidance states that tablet crushing should 
be considered as a last resort.8 Furthermore administration 
of crushed tablets to ALS patients exhibiting swallowing 
dysfunction or dysphagia may result in aspiration pneumonia 
and an increased risk of silent aspiration.4
A recent article highlights the many deficiencies of 
administering crushed tablets to patients.9
Until recently, riluzole was only available as an oral tablet 
dosage form; however, the first oral liquid form of riluzole 
(Teglutik®, novel riluzole oral suspension 5 mg/mL), has 
now been launched in the UK (Martindale Pharma Limited, 
Romford, Essex).10,11
Advantages and potential challenges of an 
oral liquid presentation of riluzole
The availability of an oral suspension of riluzole precludes 
the need for manipulation of tablets to facilitate administra-
tion. Riluzole oral suspension is presented as a 5 mg/mL 
palatable oral liquid formulation comprising finely divided 
particles of drug substance suspended in a thixotropic 
vehicle. The oral suspension utilizes controlled flocculation 
technology and exhibits pseudoplastic flow (shear thin-
ning), meaning that the apparent viscosity of the vehicle is 
relatively high when the applied shear stress is low (ie, upon 
standing), but that the apparent viscosity decreases as the 
applied shear stress increases (ie, upon shaking). The novel 
composition of the aqueous vehicle is designed to minimize 
the local anesthetic effect of the drug in the mouth and the 
unpleasant metallic taste.
Riluzole oral suspension is supplied with a plastic 
graduated oral dosing syringe for accurate and reproducible

riluzole suspension for optimized drug delivery in ALS
dose administration for ALS patients. The syringe barrel is 
graduated in milliliters up to 10 mL, to provide enhanced 
flexibility of dosing. Each 1 mL of riluzole oral suspension 
contains 5 mg of active drug, allowing accurate incremental 
dosing up to 50 mg riluzole per 10 mL dose.12 Riluzole oral 
suspension is indicated for twice-daily administration, with 
a 10 mL dose exhibiting the consistency of single cream, 
which is thus easily ingested by ALS patients who may 
experience difficulties in managing thin liquids.1 In contrast, 
riluzole film-coated tablets are only available as a single-dose 
strength of 50 mg.13
Potential challenges of riluzole oral suspension may 
include the perception that oral liquids are intended “for 
children” and that some patients may not initially be expect-
ing to be offered an oral liquid. In addition, some patients 
may not like having to manage 2×300 mL glass bottles of 
their medication each month. Conversely, these possible 
negatives are more than offset by having the utility of rilu-
zole in a dosage form that patients can easily take and that 
caregivers can easily administer with no compromise on the 
effectiveness of the drug.
Product overview
rationale for an aqueous suspension
Riluzole is a lipophilic drug substance with a low aqueous 
solubility. The drug is very slightly soluble in water at neutral 
pH (~0.3 mg/ml at pH 7), and although the solubility of the 
drug substance increases with decreasing pH (~12 mg/ml 
at pH 1.2), chemical stability decreases significantly under 
acidic conditions.14,15 An aqueous solution formulation of 
riluzole is therefore not feasible.
The solubility of riluzole may be increased by means 
of co-solvents or solubilizers to produce a physically and 
chemically stable drug solution. However, palatability is 
found to be significantly compromised, and the prolonged 
local anesthetic effect in the mouth (20–30 minutes) is 
exacerbated as a consequence of the intrinsic properties of 
this drug substance in solution.14,15
Suspensions as drug delivery systems
A pharmaceutical suspension is a relatively complex disperse 
system in which insoluble particles, generally 1 µm in 
diameter, are dispersed in a liquid medium, usually aqueous. 
The small particle size and large surface area of dispersed 
drug particles ensures a high availability for dissolution and 
hence absorption.
An acceptable suspension should typically exhibit the 
following properties: the suspended material should not 
settle too rapidly; particles that do settle must not form a 
hard mass and should be readily dispersed upon shaking; 
and the suspension must not be too viscous to pour freely 
and provide uniform dosing.16
However, many insoluble solids are not easily wetted 
by water and exhibit varying degrees of hydrophobicity, 
especially when finely divided. Particles may form large 
porous clumps within the liquid, while others remain on 
the surface and may become attached to the container. Any 
foam produced on shaking may be slow to subside because 
of the stabilizing effect of the small particles at the liquid/air 
interface. To ensure adequate wetting, the interfacial tension 
between the solid and the liquid must be reduced so that 
absorbed air is displaced from solid surface by the liquid. 
The particles will then disperse readily through the liquid, 
particularly if intense shearing is used during mixing.16
Thus, key ingredients of suspensions are surfactants, 
substances that alter the conditions prevailing at an inter-
face, causing, for example, a marked decrease in the surface 
and interfacial tension of water. These substances are of 
importance in a wide variety of fields as emulsifying agents, 
detergents, solubilizing agents, wetting agents, foaming and 
antifoaming agents and flocculants and deflocculants, and in 
drug stability and drug absorption.
All surfactants are characterized by having two regions 
in their molecular structure: a lyophobic (or hydrophobic) 
group, such as a hydrocarbon chain that has no affinity for 
aqueous solvent; and a lyophilic (or hydrophilic) group that 
has affinity for water. To have such an affinity, the group must 
possess an appreciable polar character, for example, an ion or 
group with a large permanent dipole. A molecule or ion that 
possesses this type of structure is termed amphipathic.16
The hydrocarbon chains of a water-dispersible surfactant 
are adsorbed to the hydrophobic particle surfaces, while the 
polar groups project into the aqueous medium becoming 
hydrated. Thus, wetting of solid will occur due to a fall in 
both the interfacial tension between the solid and the liquid, 
and to a lesser extent, between the liquid and air.
Even when dispersion has been achieved, suspensions 
may be disadvantaged by numerous factors such as excessive 
foaming, rapid separation or caking, taste issues caused by 
solubilization and change in bioavailability.
Formulation development of riluzole 
5 mg/mL oral suspension
To successfully develop a suspension formulation, it is 
critical that the drug substance must comprise finely divided 
particles of appropriate particle size in order to produce

a homogenous dispersion. This is achieved by the use of 
micron-sized drug particles in the suspension product. 
Riluzole is a highly hydrophobic material, particularly when 
presented as a finely divided powder. Excipient selection 
then becomes key to ensuring physical and chemical stability 
of riluzole oral suspension. The qualitative composition is 
provided in Table 1.12,17
Materials such as alcohol, glycerol and glycols that are 
water-miscible solvents will reduce the liquid/air interfacial 
tension. The riluzole suspension formulation contains sorbitol 
(D-glucitol), a hexahydric alcohol. Sorbitol will penetrate 
the loose agglomerates of drug particles displacing the air 
from the pores of the individual drug particles, thus enabling 
wetting to occur by the aqueous medium.
To further facilitate wetting of the drug substance and 
reduce the interfacial tension between the lipophilic solid 
and the hydrophilic vehicle, a combination of anionic and 
nonionic surfactants has been used.14,15
Sodium lauryl sulfate (anionic) and macrogol cetostearyl 
ether (nonionic) surfactants are used as wetting agents in 
appropriate concentrations in riluzole oral suspension. These 
surfactants are classified according to the nature of the ionic 
type of the hydrophilic group (Table 2).
As suspensions are thermodynamically unstable, dis-
persed particles tend to aggregate and/or sediment with 
time; in order to minimize settling and prevent caking of 
dispersed particles of riluzole, controlled flocculation has 
been implemented utilizing functional excipients to produce 
a stabilized suspension which is readily re-dispersed upon 
shaking. Flocculation is the process where suspended par-
ticles agglomerate to form loosely structured flocs, which 
are held together in a high-volume-network-like structure. 
Flocculated particles are therefore weakly bonded, and as 
such, they do not form a cake and are readily resuspended. 
The supernatant liquid is typically clear as colloidal particles 
are trapped within the flocs and sediment with them.
The hydrophilic colloid xanthan gum, a naturally 
occurring cellulose polymer, has been utilized in the pat-
ented formulation as a protective colloid, which coats the 
hydrophobic drug particles with a multimolecular layer. 
This layer imparts a hydrophilic character to the solid drug 
particles and promotes both wetting and suspension.
Controlled flocculation is dependent on a combination of 
particle size control, the use of electrolytes to control zeta 
potential and the addition of polymers to enable cross-linking 
between particles. Flocculation is typically achieved in part 
by neutralizing the charge of the suspended particles. Riluzole 
oral suspension thus remains in a controlled flocculated 
state, by the innovative combination of anionic and nonionic 
surfactants and hydrophilic polymers. Ionic surface-active 
agents cause flocculation by neutralization of the charge on 
each particle, whereas nonionic surfactants will have little 
effect on charge density, but because of their linear con-
figurations, they may absorb onto more than one particle to 
promote a loose flocculated structure.
The suspending polymer xanthan gum also contributes to 
controlling the degree of flocculation. The polymer molecules 
promote a gel-like network within the system and adsorb 
onto the surface of the dispersed particles, thus holding them 
in a flocculated state. Although some settling is likely, the 
sedimentation volume remains large and can persist for a 
prolonged period.
An ideal pharmaceutical suspension will exhibit a high 
apparent viscosity at low rates of shear so that on storage, 
the particles either settle very slowly or remain permanently 
suspended. At higher rates of shear, such as those caused 
by moderate shaking, the apparent viscosity should fall 
sufficiently for the product to be readily and accurately 
dispensed.
A flocculated system, in part, meets these criteria, in that 
in such a system, pseudoplastic or plastic flow is exhibited 
as the structure progressively breaks down under shear. The 
product then shows time-dependent reversibility of the loss 
of structure, or thixotrophy. The inventors report that the

riluzole suspension for optimized drug delivery in ALS
chosen combination of excipients confers a high degree of 
flocculation.14,15
Suspending agents are used in riluzole oral suspension to 
impart viscosity to the vehicle and facilitate a stable disper-
sion by minimizing sedimentation and agglomeration of drug 
particles. Importantly, the viscosity of the suspension must 
be optimized to minimize sedimentation of drug particles 
under the static conditions of storage, while maintaining 
acceptable flow properties upon the application of shear in 
the form of gentle agitation. Such properties facilitate ease 
of resuspendability and dispensing of product by the patient 
and the absence of caking upon prolonged storage. However, 
controlled flocculation must be maintained, and the combina-
tion of suspending agents to enhance and preserve physical 
stability and flocculation is crucial.14,15 Riluzole oral sus-
pension also contains sweetener (saccharin), antifoam and 
a further suspending agent aluminum magnesium silicate, 
which may also contribute advantages by associating with 
dissolved drug, thereby reducing the anesthetic effect.
Riluzole oral suspension is an innovative, physically and 
chemically stable aqueous liquid formulation, which has 
been developed utilizing expertise in pharmaceutical oral 
suspension technology and the design of optimized delivery 
systems for human administration, which is exemplified by a 
product shelf-life of 3 years, or 15 days after first opening.17
Clinical performance and bioequivalence 
of oral suspension
Riluzole oral suspension has been reported to exhibit a 
surprisingly favorable palatability profile compared with 
riluzole solution, indicating a significant advance especially 
in providing an effective treatment for ALS with potential for 
a high degree of patient acceptability and compliance.14,15
Although comprising dissolved drug and solid drug parti-
cles suspended in an aqueous vehicle, there results minimal or 
no anesthetic effect in the mouth upon oral administration.14,15 
The unique and patented liquid suspension formulation of 
riluzole appears to minimize the local anesthetic effect of 
drug particles in the mouth by providing a protective barrier 
between the drug particles and the oral mucosa and tongue. 
Furthermore, this is in contrast to the presentation of crushed 
riluzole tablets that are noted to have a significant anesthetic 
effect on the tongue.6,10
Although the pathogenesis of ALS is not completely 
elucidated, it is suggested that glutamate (the primary excit-
atory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system) plays a 
role for cell death in the disease. Riluzole is proposed to act by 
inhibiting glutamate processes, although the mode of action 
is unclear. Riluzole oral suspension is indicated to extend 
life or the time to mechanical ventilation for patients with 
ALS. Clinical trials have demonstrated that riluzole extends 
survival for patients with ALS, with survival being defined 
as patients who were alive, not intubated for mechanical 
ventilation and tracheotomy-free.17
Riluzole tablets are rapidly absorbed after oral administra-
tion with maximal plasma concentrations occurring within 
60–90 minutes (Cmax =173±72 [standard deviation] ng/mL). 
About 90% of the dose is absorbed, and the absolute bio-
availability is 60%±18%. The rate and extent of absorption 
is reduced when riluzole is administered with high-fat meals 
(decrease in Cmax of 44%, decrease in AUC of 17%).17
In a bioequivalence study between novel riluzole oral 
suspension and Rilutek® (tablets), the total exposure of 
riluzole 50 mg tablets and riluzole 5 mg/mL oral suspension 
was equivalent. (ratio: 106.84%; 90% confidence interval 
[CI]: 96.98%–117.71%). Understandably, riluzole is more 
rapidly absorbed after the administration of oral suspension 
(Tmax approximately 30 minutes), with a Cmax approximately 
20% higher than after the administration of riluzole tablets. 
(ratio: 122.32%; 90% CI: 103.28%–144.88%).17
The innovative technology employed in riluzole oral 
suspension clearly provides an opportunity for more accurate 
dosing and enhanced patient compliance compared with 
crushed tablets administered with food puree, yoghurt or via an 
enteral feeding tube. The suspension is readily administered by 
means of a graduated oral dosing syringe, and the concentration 
is consistent with a volume that is easy to measure and not bur-
densome. No product manipulation or premixing is required, 
and dilution with liquids is not necessary. Crucially, it is 
reported that there is minimal or no anesthetic effect in the 
mouth upon administration of the oral suspension.14,15
Conclusion
Riluzole is a disease-modifying treatment that has been 
shown to slow the course of ALS. Based on the recognized 
efficacy of riluzole, the demonstrated bioequivalence of 
riluzole oral suspension, reduced anesthesia in the mouth and 
the significant advantages of a liquid presentation exhibiting 
shear-thinning (pseudoplastic) behavior over tablets for ALS 
patients, riluzole 5 mg/mL oral suspension is the drug of 
choice. Teglutik® is a patented formulation that represents a 
significant therapeutic advancement for patients with ALS.
