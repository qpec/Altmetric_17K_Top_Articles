Neonatal vitamin D status and risk of
multiple sclerosis
A population-based case-control study
ABSTRACT
Objective: As previous research has suggested that exposure to vitamin D insufficiency in utero
may have relevance for the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), we aimed to examine the direct asso-
ciation between level of neonatal vitamin D and risk of MS.
Methods: We carried out a matched case-control study. Dried blood spots samples (DBSS)
belonging to 521 patients with MS were identified in the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank.
For every patient with MS, 1–2 controls with the same sex and birth date were retrieved from
the Biobank (n 5 972). Level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in the DBSS was measured using
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. The association between different levels of
25(OH)D and risk of MS was evaluated by odds ratios (OR) calculated in conditional logistic
regression models.
Results: We observed that lower levels of 25(OH)D in neonates were associated with an increased
risk of MS. In the analysis by quintiles, MS risk was highest among individuals in the bottom quin-
tile (,20.7 nmol/L) and lowest among those in the top quintile of 25(OH)D ($48.9 nmol/L), with an
OR for top vs bottom of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.78). In the analysis treating
25(OH)D as a continuous variable, a 25 nmol/L increase in neonatal 25(OH)D resulted in a 30%
reduced risk of MS (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57–0.84).
Conclusion: Low concentrations of neonatal vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of
MS. In light of the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency among pregnant women, our obser-
vation may have importance for public health. Neurology® 2017;88:44–51

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS affecting
approximately 2.5 million individuals worldwide.1,2 The etiology and exact pathogenesis of
MS is still unknown, but there is growing evidence that low vitamin D levels are associated
with an increased risk of MS3,4 and that supplementary vitamin D intake may have a protective
effect.5,6 The results of a recent mendelian randomization study strongly support the causality of
an association between lower vitamin D levels and increased susceptibility to MS.7
Although some controversy exists, patients with MS from the Northern hemisphere seem to
be more likely to be born in April or May,8–12 just after the very low winter levels of vitamin D,13
suggesting that in utero exposure to vitamin D insufficiency also is relevant for the risk of MS.14

 In a Swedish case-control study,15 no asso-
ciation was found between levels of neonatal
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) measured
in dried blood spots samples (DBSS) and later
risk of MS, but the results may have been
affected by degradation of 25(OH)D due to
high storage temperatures.15,16 In contrast, in
a recent study in the Finnish Maternity
Cohort, maternal vitamin D deficiency (serum
25[OH]D levels ,30 nmol/L) in early preg-
nancy was associated with a 90% increase in
risk of MS in the offspring.17
Here, we examine the association between
neonatal 25(OH)D status and risk of MS in
a large population-based case-control study
using data from the nationwide Danish MS
registry and the Danish Newborn Screening
Biobank (DNSB).
METHODS Participants. The study was based on a linkage
between the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry,18 the Danish
Civil Registration System,19 and DBSS from the DNSB.20 Resid-
ual DBSS have been systematically stored at 2208C for individ-
uals born in Denmark since May 1, 1981. The biobank is
considered close to complete for virtually all newborns in Den-
mark since 1982, corresponding to approximately 1.8 million
samples. DBSS are taken by a heel prick 5–7 days after birth
and analyzed for a number of inborn errors of metabolism at
the Newborn Screening Laboratory, Statens Serum Institut, in
Copenhagen.20,21 Using data from the nationwide Danish Mul-
tiple Sclerosis Registry (MS Registry), we identified all the indi-
viduals who were born since April 30, 1981, and had onset of MS
before or in 2012. The Danish MS Registry, which was estab-
lished in 1956, is the longest running nationwide MS registry and
covers a period of more than 50 years.18 In the present study, we
only included cases fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Allison or
Poser including possible MS (when other diseases are ruled out),
and since 2005 the McDonald criteria and their updates, but not
cases of clinically isolated syndrome or poorly documented cases.
The linkage between the MS Registry and the DNSB was possible
due to the unique personal ID number assigned to every Danish
citizen by the Civil Registration System since April 1968.19 For
every MS case with a DBSS in the DNSB, DBSS from 1 to 2
controls of same sex and exact birth date were selected. Controls
had to be alive or living in Denmark on the date of MS diagnosis
in the matched patient with MS.
25(OH)D assessment. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
(25[OH]D3), which is the main circulating form of vitamin D,22
and the related ergosterol-derived form 25-hydroxyvitamin D2
(25[OH]D2), which can be obtained from certain dietary
sources,
e.g.,
mushrooms,
fortified
foods,
and
vitamin
supplements.21 For each individual, one 3.2-mm disc of DBSS
was used. The assay was performed at the Statens Serum Institut,
Copenhagen, and is a modified version of the method by Eyles
et al.23 The assay method is highly sensitive and uses minimal
sample cleanup to reduce sample loss during extraction, chemical
derivatization to enhance 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 ionization,
and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy coupled
with multiple reaction monitoring. It has previously been shown
that the assay can reliably detect seasonal (within year)
fluctuations, is strongly correlated with neonatal cord blood
(r 5 0.85),13 and that appropriate 25(OH)D3 concentrations
can be detected after prolonged storage time (e.g., greater than
20 years).23 Neonatal DBSS are routinely collected from capillary
blood.
The
protein-bound
25(OH)D
is
excluded
from
erythrocytes, thus, concentrations in whole blood are lower
than in serum. We therefore multiplied the total 25(OH)D
concentrations measured in capillary blood by 2.56 (1/[1–
0.61]) to estimate serum levels13,23; all 25(OH)D values
reported below correspond to estimated serum levels.
Potential confounders. Perinatal factors such as gestational
age, birthweight, maternal age at birth, Apgar score, and parental
ethnicity have been shown to be associated with neonatal vitamin
D status or maternal D vitamin deficiency,24,25 whereas the asso-
ciation with MS is less clear.26–28 Data on birthweight (,3,000,
3,000–3,249, 3,250–3,499, 3,500–3,749, 3,750–3,999, 4,000–
4,249, $4,250 g), Apgar score 5 minutes after birth (0–9, 10),
and gestational age (#37, 38, 39, 40, $41 weeks) were obtained
from the Danish Medical Birth Register.29 Information on pa-
rents’ age at child’s birth (,20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39,
$40 years) and place of birth (both parents Danish born, both
born abroad or one born abroad and one unknown/with missing
information, one Danish and one born abroad, one Danish born
and one unknown/missing information) was obtained from the
civil registration system.19 Greenland was considered a foreign
country. Parental place of birth was used as a proxy measure of
ethnicity. Parental history of MS was determined using informa-
tion from the MS Registry.
Statistics. Odds ratios (ORs) of MS according to neonatal levels
of 25(OH)D were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
Due to the matching scheme, all analyses were controlled for sex,
age, and exact date of birth. To explore a dose-response
relationship with MS, we modeled neonatal 25(OH)D levels in
5 groups according to quintiles of 25(OH)D in controls.
Individuals
were
furthermore
classified
into
predefined
categories of 25(OH)D levels, i.e., individuals with neonatal 25
(OH)D serum levels ,30 nmol/L, 30–,50 nmol/L, and $50
nmol/L were considered to have been born with deficient,
insufficient, and sufficient levels, respectively, of 25(OH)D.22,25
Under an assumption of linearity between levels of 25(OH)D and
MS risk, we finally modeled 25(OH)D as a continuous variable.
We a priori included gestational age, birthweight, and paren-
tal ethnicity in the multivariable conditional logistic regression
analysis. Other covariates (mother’s age, father’s age, Apgar score,
and parental MS) were only retained in the model if they changed
at least one of the quintile-specific ORs estimated in the above
multivariable model by $10%. In the multivariable analysis, we
excluded cases and controls having missing values.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The present study was approved by the Danish Ethical
Committee of the Capital Region, Copenhagen, and The Danish
Data Protection Agency.
RESULTS According to the MS Registry, 796 indi-
viduals born on or after April 30, 1981, had devel-
oped MS. One hundred seventy-seven patients with
MS, 68% of whom were born before 1986, were
not identified in DNSB. Restricting to singletons
and excluding individuals who did not have sufficient
DBSS to measure 25(OH)D, the number of cases
and controls was reduced to 534 and 1,001. Twenty

 of the controls died or had emigrated from Denmark
before MS diagnosis in the corresponding case.
Finally, we excluded 13 cases without a matched con-
trol, and 9 controls without a case, thus limiting the
dataset to 521 cases and 972 controls (figure 1).
Characteristics of patients with MS and controls
participating in the study are described in table 1.
Mean values of serum 25(OH)D were 33.0 nmol/L
(SD 16.9, minimum 1.3 nmol/L, maximum 101.4
nmol/L) among patients with MS and 35.9 nmol (SD
17.5, minimum 4.9, maximum 114.7) among con-
trols (p , 0.01) (figure e-1 at Neurology.org). Impor-
tantly, 25(OH)D levels measured in DBSS from
persons born in the period 1981 to 2000 showed
no evidence of 25(OH)D degradation by year for
cases or controls (figure 2). Figure 3 shows mean 25
(OH)D levels according to month of birth among
cases and controls. As expected, a clear seasonal
variation was seen for cases as well as for controls,
with the lowest levels of 25(OH)D in the winter
and early spring.
We observed that lower levels of neonatal 25(OH)
D were associated with an increased risk of MS. In the
analyses by quintiles, MS risk decreased monotoni-
cally with increasing 25(OH)D (OR for the highest
compared to lowest quintile 0.53, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.36–0.78; p for trend 0.001, table 2).
A similar pattern was seen using predefined categories
of 25(OH)D, although no statistically significant dif-
ference was observed between sufficient and insuffi-
cient levels of 25(OH)D (table 2). Finally, for every
25 nmol/L increase in neonatal 25(OH)D level, the
risk of MS was reduced by 30% (OR 0.70, 95% CI
0.57–0.84) (table 2).
In the multivariable analyses, we ended up ad-
justing only for parental ethnicity, birthweight,
and gestational age, and results were practically
unchanged (table 2).
DISCUSSION In this large population-based case-
control study, we found an inverse association
between neonatal levels of 25(OH)D and risk of
MS. Especially children born with 25(OH)D levels
less than 30 nmol/L were at an increased risk of
MS, whereas the additional benefit of higher levels
of 25(OH)D were less strong. Our results support
previous studies suggesting a protective role of
vitamin D in the development of MS, but also
suggests that vitamin D insufficiency in utero may
be of relevance for the risk of MS.
The majority of previous studies have examined the
relevance of vitamin D intake, UV radiation, or serum
25(OH)D levels in adolescence or adulthood4,6,16,30–32;
few studies have examined the possible association

 between in utero vitamin D levels and risk of MS, and
findings are conflicting.3,14,15,17 Furthermore, direct
measurements of in utero levels of D vitamin are not
possible, meaning that the above association has only
been addressed using different markers of fetal vitamin
D levels, including maternal intake of vitamin D14 dur-
ing pregnancy, maternal serum levels of 25(OH)D dur-
ing pregnancy,3,17 or neonatal levels of vitamin D.15
A study among US nurses found a lower MS risk in
the offspring of women with higher vitamin D intake
during pregnancy.14 Results should, however, be inter-
preted with caution because food intake during preg-
nancy relied on self-reported data collected several
decades after the pregnancy at a point when many
patients with MS already had been diagnosed among
the offspring, which increases the risk of recall bias.
Two prospective, nested case-control studies have
been conducted measuring maternal serum 25(OH)
D in pregnancy (primarily 1st trimester) and risk of
MS in the offspring. In the first of these studies, con-
ducted in Sweden and including 37 patients with MS
and 185 matched controls, there was no significant
association between serum 25(OH)D levels in preg-
nancy and MS risk among the offspring.3 This anal-
ysis was, however, limited by the small sample size
and by insufficient matching on date of birth. More
recently, a larger study was conducted in the Finnish
Maternity Cohort. In this study, which included 176
patients with MS and 326 matched controls, mater-
nal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy (25[OH]
D , 30 nmol/L) was associated with a 90% increased
risk of MS in the offspring.17
Finally, in a Swedish case-control study, neonatal
levels of 25(OH)D were measured in DBSS stored
in the Swedish Phenylketonuria Biobank since 1975.
In this study, similar in design to ours and including
459 cases and 663 controls, levels of neonatal 25
(OH)D were not associated with MS risk.15 Several
limitations of the study may have contributed to the
null findings, including low participation among con-
trols (;44%) as compared to cases (;88%), so that
the representativeness of the controls is uncertain.16 In
addition, Ueda and colleagues15 reported a substantial
degradation of 25(OH)D in older DBSS, which is
likely to be due to storage conditions. DBSS in the
Swedish Phenylketonuria Biobank were stored at room
temperature from 1975 to August 1981, and since
then at 48C. Approximately 50% of the DBSS were
collected between 1975 and 1981 and thus exposed to
room temperature. In our study, there was no evidence
of 25(OH)D degradation, likely due to storage of the
DBSS at 2208C.20 Degradation is expected to be sim-
ilar among cases and controls, and is likely to result in
nondifferential misclassification,16 which could also
explain the null finding in the Swedish study. Ueda
and colleagues15 did repeat the analyses stratifying on

 5-year interval of birth year, and interestingly, they
observed a tendency towards a lower risk of MS the
higher the level of neonatal 25(OH)D levels for indi-
viduals born between 1980 and 1984. Thus, for every
10 nmol/L increase in neonatal 25(OH)D level, the
risk of MS was reduced by 10% (OR 0.9 [0.78–1.01]),
which is consistent with our findings.
A potential limitation of our study is that only 534
of the 796 patients with MS born since the
establishment of the DNSB were included in the 25
(OH)D analysis, mainly due to lack of DBSS material
or due to less completeness of the DNSB in the first
years after establishment. However, inadequate mate-
rial is unlikely to be related to 25(OH)D levels or
future MS risk and thus inconsequential for the re-
sults of the study. Further, 25(OH)D levels in the
present study were low, with more than 40% of the
children born with deficient levels of 25(OH)D
(,30 nmol/L). Nevertheless, our measured levels of
neonatal 25(OH)D are compatible with neonatal val-
ues measured in a previous study by Eyles et al.13
Another important issue is how well neonatal 25
(OH)D levels measured in DBSS represent 25(OH)
D status during pregnancy. 25(OH)D levels in DBSS
are highly correlated with levels in umbilical cord
blood,13 but probably only moderately correlated
with maternal levels at midgestation.25 Thus in
a recent longitudinal study in the Netherlands, the
correlation between maternal serum levels of 25(OH)
D at midgestation and levels of 25(OH)D in the off-
spring’s umbilical cord was 0.57 and levels of 25(OH)
D in umbilical cord were about 20 nmol/L lower than
maternal serum levels at midgestation.25
Data concerning sun exposure, including out-
door physical activity, body mass index, diet, and
intake of vitamin D supplements in adolescence
and adult life were not available for cases and con-
trols in our study, which could have influenced
our results.25,33 However, in previous studies14,15
adjustment for these covariates did not change the
results.
Individuals participating in the present study were
young (the majority born after 1981), and many had
not yet reached the age of peak MS incidence by the
time of the study (2012). Thus our findings largely
reflect the association between neonatal vitamin D lev-
els and MS diagnosis up to age 30, and may not nec-
essary be applicable to MS onset in older individuals.
A key question is whether the lower MS risk
among children born with higher 25(OH)D levels re-
flects a direct protective effect of higher 25(OH)D
levels in utero, or rather if it is mediated by higher
vitamin D status during childhood and early adult-
hood. The association between 25(OH)D levels at
birth and later in life is most likely to occur because
of a combination of behavioral (similarity between
mother and child in vitamin D intake and sunlight
exposure) and genetic factors. Although genetic varia-
tions in 25(OH)D levels are modest34 and by them-
selves insufficient to explain the strong association
found in this study, the impact of behavioral factors
is more difficult to quantify, and we cannot therefore
exclude the possibility that 25(OH)D levels in child-
hood and adolescence account for the apparent pro-
tective effects of in utero 25(OH)D.

 Nevertheless, our results support previous sugges-
tions of a protective role for vitamin D in the devel-
opment of MS.16,32 Although the exact mechanism
of a vitamin D effect is incompletely understood, it
is likely to involve an attenuation of the T-cell
response to autoantigens and suppression of the pro-
duction of proinflammatory cytokines such as inter-
feron-g and Th17-interleukin 17.35 By modifying
and regulating the production and release of neuro-
trophic factors, vitamin D may also have a neuropro-
tective effect.36 Animal studies have furthermore
suggested that prenatal exposure to vitamin D defi-
ciency may lead to alteration in mitochondrial, cyto-
skeletal, and synaptic functions of the brain.37,38
We observed an inverse association between neo-
natal levels of 25(OH)D and risk of MS, thus the
higher the level of 25(OH)D among neonates the
lower their risk of MS in later life. However, we can-
not exclude the possibility that this apparent benefi-
cial effect is mediated by a correlation between 25
(OH)D levels at birth and levels later in life, in which
case maternal vitamin D supplementation would not
reduce MS risk in the offspring. This uncertainty not-
withstanding, the high global prevalence of hypovita-
minosis D among pregnant women25,39 and the fact
that increasing maternal vitamin D levels is likely to
reduce the mother’s risk of MS as well as her off-
spring’s provides a rationale for universal vitamin D
supplementation in pregnancy.
