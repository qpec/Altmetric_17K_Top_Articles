ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of depression and tends to persist even after mood
symptoms recover, leading to detrimental effects on clinical and functional outcomes. However, most currently
available treatments have not typically addressed cognition. Modafinil has been shown to have beneficial effects on
cognitive function and therefore has the potential to improve cognition in depression. The objective of this double-
blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on cognitive functions in patients with
remitted depression.
METHODS: In total, 60 patients with remitted depression participated in the study. Cognitive functions were
evaluated with tests of working memory, planning, attention, and episodic memory from the Cambridge Neuro-
psychological Test Automated Battery at the baseline session and after treatment. A double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel groups design was used to assess the effects of single-dose (200 mg) modafinil (n 5 30)
or placebo (n 5 30) on cognition and fatigue. The main outcome measures were neurocognitive test scores from the
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Visual analogue scales for subjective feelings and fatigue
were used as secondary measures.
RESULTS: The modafinil group had significantly better performance on tests of episodic memory (p 5 .01, ηp
2 5 .10)
and working memory (p 5 .04, ηp
2 5 .06). Modafinil did not improve planning or sustained attention.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that modafinil (200 mg) could improve episodic memory and working
memory performance in patients with remitted depression. Modafinil may have potential as a therapeutic agent to
help remitted depressed patients with persistent cognitive difficulties.

Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of depression. Cogni-
tive symptoms are among the most frequently endorsed
symptoms, and nearly half of the patients continue to report
residual cognitive symptoms between episodes (1). Cognitive
dysfunction has been shown to be associated with poorer
functional outcomes (2,3) and higher rates of relapse (4) in
patients with depression. However, there are major challenges
to addressing the impact of cognitive problems in depression.
First, clinical practitioners tend to inquire about and treat the
mood symptoms and frequently do not ask patients about
cognitive problems (5). Second, when measured, the effects
on cognition of most currently available treatments for depres-
sion are relatively small (6). Recently, cognitive dysfunction has
been increasingly recognized as a novel target for treatment in
depression (7). Alternative therapeutic interventions are needed
to tackle cognitive problems in depression. In this double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we investigated
the effects of single-dose modafinil on cognitive domains in
patients with remitted depression.
Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent currently licensed for
narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder (8). Its beneficial
effects on sleep problems, fatigue, and motivation have led to
its use to alleviate symptoms in patients with depression.
A
meta-analysis
of
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
revealed that modafinil augmentation was associated with
greater reduction in symptom severity in depression (9).
Notably, modafinil’s effectiveness was evident in the first
week, suggesting possible acute or subchronic effects. How-
ever, there was not a single cognitive outcome in the
previously published controlled studies. To date, only one
open-label study has measured cognitive performance and
demonstrated improvement with modafinil augmentation in an
executive function task (10). Over the past 2 decades, the
cognition-enhancing potential of modafinil has been shown for

 various domains of cognitive performance in healthy volun-
teers (11–13). Modafinil also improved cognitive dysfunction in
other psychiatric conditions, including attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder (14) and schizophrenia (15). Procognitive
effects of modafinil on working memory were associated with
its effects on noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal
cortex. It was suggested that modafinil’s action on glutama-
tergic pathways may be linked with positive effects on
encoding (15).
A growing body of evidence indicates that cognitive deficits
in depression are seen even after mood symptoms recover
(16,17). A recent meta-analysis of depression studies examin-
ing a broad range of cognitive domains showed that the
magnitude of cognitive deficits in remitted depression were in
some domains comparable to deficits during episodes (18).
Patients with remitted depression showed cognitive deficits in
the domains of executive function, memory, and attention.
Given these previously published findings, we specifically
aimed to recruit patients with remitted depression to test the
efficacy of modafinil on cognition. Using patients in remission
minimizes the confounding effects of depressed mood on
cognition. Neuropsychological performance in depression is
highly heterogeneous (17,18); therefore, differences between
patients in cognitive deficits should be taken into consider-
ation. In this study, we used a baseline cognitive testing
session to assess possible performance differences within the
sample. The rationale for test selection was based on those
tests shown to be most affected in the recent meta-analysis
(18). Measures from this session were used to inform analyses
at the intervention session.
The main aim of this study was to investigate whether a
single dose of modafinil (200 mg) could improve performance
on cognitive tests in patients with remitted depression. The
possible mediating role of clinical variables on cognition was
assessed, including fatigue symptoms, psychosocial function-
ing, and work functioning.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Research Governance
The study was jointly sponsored by the University of Cam-
bridge and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health
Service (NHS) Foundation Trust. The protocol was submitted
to Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency, and the
study was classified as not a clinical trial of an investigational
medicinal product. Study funding was from a core award to
the Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute from the
Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust. The Ethics
application was approved on June 25, 2014, by the NHS
National Research Ethics Service–Cambridge East Research
Ethics Committee (Ethics Reference No. 14/EE/0178). The
study was adopted by National Institute of Health Research
Clinical Research Network–Mental Health and registered into a
public database (UK CRN ID: 17355) that was accessible
online. The consent procedure was in line with NHS National
Research Ethics Service ethical standards and was compliant
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consents
were obtained at the baseline session.
Participants
In total, 60 patients with remitted depression aged between 18
and 65 years were recruited from a range of mental health
trusts, from general practitioner surgeries, and through online
and local advertisements. Inclusion criteria were 1) confirmed
diagnosis of a previous unipolar depressive episode (during
the last 3 years) according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria, 2)
currently in remission from depression (score of less than
12 on the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
[MADRS]) for at least 2 months, and 3) fluency in English.
Exclusion criteria were 1) history of head injury, 2) mental
retardation, 3) any other psychiatric diagnosis (except comor-
bid anxiety), 4) active suicidal ideation, 5) cognitive disorder
owing to a medical condition, 6) pregnancy and breastfeeding,
7) treatment-resistant hypertension or any known significant
cardiovascular disease, 8) renal or liver disease/impairment, 9)
taking hormonal contraceptives, anticonvulsants, or warfarin, 10)
taking drugs that are metabolized through CYPC19 enzymes or
drugs that are eliminated by gastrointestinal CYP3A enzymes,
and 11) taking maximum dose of antidepressant medication that
is metabolized through CYP2D6 enzymes owing to a possible
interaction in people who have low metabolizer status (approx-
imately 7% of the U.K. population).
The sample consisted of 37 female and 23 male patients.
The mean age of participants was 45.03 6 10.82 years, the
mean length of current remission was 8.21 6 7.49 months,
and the mean number of previous depressive episodes was
3.18 6 1.52. Patients had some degree of residual depressive
symptoms; the mean MADRS score at the baseline session
was 5.33 6 3.25. The details of demographic and clinical
features are presented in Table 1. The groups were balanced in
terms of age, gender, and education levels (Table 1). Of the
sample, 48 patients were on antidepressant medication (citalo-
pram 5 15, venlafaxine 5 11, sertraline 5 6, fluoxetine 5 5,
duloxetine 5 2, mirtazapine 5 2, dosulepin 5 2, doxapin 5 1,
bupropion 5 1, nortryptiline, 5 1, amitryptiline, 5 1, trazodone 5
1), whereas 12 patients were unmedicated. The study sessions
were conducted between November 2014 and November 2015.
Study Sessions
Baseline Session. Participants attended a baseline session
at their local mental health trust. They were assessed at the
same time interval (10 AM to 2 PM) in a quiet room, and they
were advised not to take caffeinated drinks at least 2 hours
before the session. Benzodiazepine use was not allowed prior
to the session. The session involved detailed evaluation of
clinical features, depression history, anxiety ratings (State and
Trait Anxiety Inventory), depressive symptom severity rating
with MADRS, premorbid IQ (National Adult Reading Test),
psychosocial functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning),
work functioning (Lam Employment Absence and Productivity
Scale), and computerized cognitive testing. The following tests
from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated
Battery (CANTAB) were used: 1) Rapid Visual Information
Processing (RVIP), 2) Stockings of Cambridge (SOC), 3)
Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and 4) Paired Associates
Learning (PAL). A summary of the tests, including descriptions,
main outcome measures, and references, is presented in
Table 2 (19–23). Detailed descriptions can be found in the

 CANTABeclipse administration guide (24). In addition to
providing baseline data, this session familiarized participants
with the tests.
Intervention Session. Approximately 1 week after the
baseline session, participants attended the intervention ses-
sion at the National Institute of Health Research/Wellcome
Trust Clinical Research Facility at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. A
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel groups
design was used. Study sessions were scheduled at the same
time of the day (10 AM to 12 PM) to keep the testing time
standard. Before dosing, participants had their current mental
state assessed as well as a baseline blood pressure, electro-
cardiogram, urine drug screening, and assessment of breath
alcohol concentration. The assessments included the Fatigue
Severity Scale, visual analogue scales of feelings, anxiety
ratings (State and Trait Anxiety Inventory), and depressive
symptom ratings (MADRS). After the assessments, partici-
pants received modafinil (200 mg) or placebo. The modafinil
dose was selected on the basis of previous experimental
studies that reported procognitive effects (12,14). Cognitive
testing started 2 hours after dosing. Modafinil was shown to
reach its peak level in 2 to 4 hours, so the interval allowed us
to test the participants in a time window while modafinil had
peak plasma levels. Blood pressure and heart rate were
monitored every half hour after dosing. The participants spent
2 hours before the test administration in a quiet day room at
the Clinical Research Facility. All neuropsychological tests
were delivered by the first author, who is a trained psychiatrist.
Light lunches and snacks were provided with the exception of
caffeinated drinks.
At the intervention session, the CANTAB SWM task with
high levels of difficulty (up to 12 boxes) and the PAL test with
high levels of difficulty (up to 12 shapes) were administered.
One Touch Stockings (OTS), a challenging planning task, was
selected instead of the easier planning task, the SOC. Those
versions of the tasks in previously published studies have
been found to have greater sensitivity and to avoid ceiling
effects. The version of CANTAB RVIP used was the same in
both sessions. Primary and secondary cognitive measures are
listed in Table 2.
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed with version 21.0 of the SPSS
statistical software package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Sepa-
rate linear models were constructed for each neuropsycho-
logical outcome at the intervention session as dependent
variables. The groups (modafinil and placebo) were fixed
factors, and neuropsychological test scores at the baseline
were used as covariates to account for within-group variance
in preexisting cognitive performance. In the intervention ses-
sion, test versions with higher difficulty levels were used to
minimize learning effects. The statistical approach allowed us
to account for the cognitive level at baseline on performance
after the intervention without potential confounding effects
related to differential task difficulty. Additional covariates
(National Adult Reading Test, age, etc.) were selected if they
accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in linear
models. Sidak correction was applied for adjustment of multi-
ple comparisons. All p values reported are corrected for
multiple comparisons. Estimates of effect sizes are reported
as partial eta squared (ηp
2) values. Qualitative interpretations
of effect sizes as small, medium, and large correspond to ηp
2
values of .001, .059, and .138, respectively (25).
RESULTS
Randomization
Modafinil and placebo groups were well matched in terms of
age, gender, premorbid IQ, depressive symptom scores,
anxiety levels, clinical features, fatigue severity, psychosocial
functioning, and work functioning (Table 1). Baseline cognitive
test measures were comparable between the two groups
(Supplemental

S1).
The

 p 5 .19 [two sided]). The participants were asked at the end of
the test session whether they thought they were on modafinil or
placebo. In response, 40% of patients in the modafinil group
were able to guess that they received modafinil, whereas 26.6%
of patients in the placebo group correctly guessed that they
received placebo. Comparison of the two groups showed no
significant difference in the ability to correctly detect group
membership (χ2 5 1.200, p 5 .27 [two sided]). The ability to
guess the correct allocation was at chance level.
Effects of Modafinil on Physiological and Subjective
Measures
Modafinil had no effect on visual analogue scales of fatigue
(F 5 3.595, p 5 .06, ηp
2 5 .05). Similarly, self-reported feelings
for 15 dimensions (e.g., alert vs. drowsy, strong vs. feeble) as
measured by visual analogue scales were not significantly
different between groups (F values ranging between 0.004 and
1.459, p values ranging between .26 and .95).
Heart rate increased over time (F 5 6.620, p 5 .01, ηp
2 5 .10),
but there was no main effect of modafinil (F 5 0.84, p 5 .46,
ηp
2 5 .01). Over time, there was a significant decrease in
systolic pressure (F 5 2.935, p 5 .03, ηp
2 5 .04), whereas
the
decrease
in
diastolic
pressure
was
not
significant
(F 5 2.051, p 5 .08, ηp
2 5 .03). There was no effect of
modafinil on systolic (F 5 0.790, p 5 .49, ηp
2 5 .01) or
diastolic (F 5 1.496, p 5 .20, ηp
2 5 .02) pressure changes.
None of the participants had significant adverse events during
participation or within 24 hours after the study, confirmed by a
follow-up telephone call. In total, 10 patients reported mild
side effects: headache (placebo 5 1, modafinil 5 1), increased
anxiety (placebo 5 1, modafinil 5 1), drowsiness (modafinil 5
2), blurred vision (placebo 5 2), sleep disturbance on the night
of the study session (modafinil 5 2). Incidence of mild side
effects was not significantly different between groups.
Effects of Modafinil on Neurocognitive Testing
Episodic Memory (PAL). Modafinil significantly improved
performance as measured by fewer errors on the PAL test (F 5
6.199, p 5 .01, ηp
2 5 .10) (Figure 1). In addition to the total
number of errors, four secondary measures of errors were
assessed for PAL performance. The modafinil group had fewer
errors on PAL mean errors to success (F 5 9.935, p , .01, ηp
2
5 .26) (Table 3). Modafinil had marginal effects on first trial
memory score (F 5 3.883, p 5 .054, ηp
2 5 .06) and on mean
trials to success (F 5 3.771, p 5 .057, ηp
2 5 .06). To assess
whether the effect of modafinil was on encoding or learning, a
repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted based
on the number of trials to solve the PAL 12 shapes problem.
The main effect of learning was not significant for modafinil
(F 5 1.576, p 5 .20, ηp
2 5 .03).

 Working Memory (SWM). Patients on modafinil showed
a trend for fewer errors overall on the SWM task (F 5 3.023,
p 5 .08, ηp
2 5 .05). When means plot (Figure 2) was explored,
there was a marked difference at the 12 boxes stage. Analysis
of covariance revealed that patients in the modafinil group had
fewer errors in the 12 boxes stage of the SWM test (F 5 4.125,
p 5 .04, ηp
2 5 .06) (Figure 2). The strategy score was not
significantly different (F 5 0.984, p 5 .32, ηp
2 5 .01) (Table 3).
Planning (One Touch SOC). There was no effect of
modafinil on planning performance (F 5 1.057, p 5 .37,
ηp
2 5 .01). Modafinil did not have a significant effect on the
number of problems solved in minimum moves (F 5 1.744,
p 5 .19, ηp
2 5 .03). The modafinil group had longer mean
latencies to make a decision, although this difference was not
significant (F 5 1.198, p 5 .27, ηp
2 5 .02) (Table 3).
Attention (RVIP). There was no significant effect of mod-
afinil on target sensitivity index, RVIP A0 (F 5 1.544, p 5 .21,
ηp
2 5 .02), and response bias, RVIP B00 (F 5 0.127, p 5 .12,
ηp
2 , .01). RVIP mean latency was not significantly different
across groups (F 5 2.208, p 5 .14, ηp
2 5 .03) (Table 3).
There was no significant effect of age, subsyndromal
depressive symptoms, or anxiety scores on any of the
cognitive measures reported. There were no differential effects
of gender on cognitive test measures.
Figure 1. (Left) Episodic memory performance according to the difficulty level is shown. The repeated measures analysis of variance, which controlled for
baseline performance, demonstrated a main effect of modafinil (F 5 6.199, p 5 .01, ηp

Statistical values were obtained via general linear model–analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
aFor these measures, repeated measures ANCOVA was used with difficulty as the factor and relevant cognitive test scores at baseline as
covariate. For other measures, univariate ANCOVA with relevant covariates from baseline session were used. PAL test results were from 29
participants in each group due to loss of data related to technical problems.

 Correlations
The associations between cognitive functions at baseline and
clinical features, as well as measures of functionality, were
investigated using bivariate correlation analyses. Depressive
symptom severity was significantly associated with longer
response latency on the RVIP test (Spearman’s ρ 5 .33,
p , .01 [two tailed]). Other cognitive tests were not associated
with residual depressive symptoms. Age at onset, number of
previous episodes, and duration of remission were not sig-
nificantly associated with cognitive test measures.
Psychosocial functioning (Global Assessment of Function-
ing) was significantly associated with working memory per-
formance (SWM between errors) (ρ 5 2.31, p 5 .01 [two
tailed]) and attention performance (RVIP A0) (ρ 5 .35, p , .01
[two tailed]). Work functioning (Lam Employment Absence and
Productivity Scale) was not associated with cognitive test
performance.
Significant associations were found between baseline cog-

DISCUSSION
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study
in patients with remitted depression suggested that modafinil
could improve performance on episodic memory and working
memory tests. However, there were no effects on attention
and planning. It has been reported that modafinil can improve
forms of cognition in both healthy volunteers and people with
cognitive impairment owing to psychiatric conditions (11–15).
Findings from the current study indicate that modafinil can
also improve domains of cognition in those with remitted
depression. To our knowledge, this study is the first to
investigate the effects of modafinil in remitted depression.
The effects of modafinil on episodic memory were found to
be within the medium to large effect size range. In contrast,
previous studies did not find an improvement in episodic
memory with single-dose modafinil (11,12,14), although most
of these studies used an easier version of the PAL test. The
only study that used the new difficult version of the PAL test,
which was up to the 12 shapes level (12), reported possible
ceiling effects in their high-functioning healthy sample. An
alternative explanation for the improvement by modafinil in
episodic memory might be related to a possibly altered neural
circuit in patients with remitted depression. One of the
proposed neural mechanisms for cognitive dysfunction in
depression is impaired hippocampal function. This was sup-
ported by consistent findings of reduced hippocampal vol-
umes in people with a history of depression (26,27). Patients
with depression showed lower hippocampal activation in
functional imaging during an associative learning task (28).
The findings from the current study indicated that the effects
of modafinil were related to improvements at the initial
encoding stage rather than on the subsequent learning trials
of the PAL task. In a previously published imaging study by
our group, we demonstrated that the hippocampal formation
was primarily recruited in the encoding stage of the PAL task,
whereas parahippocampal structures were more activated in
retrieval (29). The activation was also associated with increas-
ing task difficulty. Episodic memory improvement observed in
this study could be associated with neurochemical changes
induced by modafinil in hippocampal areas, particularly via
glutamatergic mechanisms. Experimental studies indicate that
modafinil could induce glutamate release in the hippocampus
(30). Modafinil was shown to increase regional blood flow to
the hippocampus in healthy volunteers (31); therefore, this may
be the underlying mechanism of improved performance in the
PAL test.
The finding of working memory improvements at the high-
est level of difficulty was similar to that seen in a study of
healthy volunteers that used the high-functioning version of
Figure 2. (Left) Working memory performance according to the difficulty level is shown. Repeated measures analysis of variance, which controlled for
baseline performance, showed a trend effect of modafinil (F 5 3.023, p 5 .08, ηp
2 5 .05). (Right) The bar graph shows a significant difference between
modafinil and placebo groups at the Spatial Working Memory (SWM) 12 boxes stage after controlling for baseline performance (F 5 4.125, p 5 .04, ηp
2 5 .06).

 the CANTAB (12). Other studies using relatively easier versions
of the CANTAB SWM task did not show significant effects of
modafinil, again probably related to ceiling effects. The effects
of modafinil were evident only in the 12 boxes stage of SWM in
the current study. Previously, single-dose modafinil (200 mg)
was shown to improve working memory and altered frontal
activation in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers (32). In patients
with schizophrenia, modafinil administration was associated
with increased dorsolateral prefrontal activity (33). The actions
of modafinil on norepinephrine and dopamine in dorsolateral
prefrontal regions likely play a role in improved working
memory performance (34,35). It should also be noted that
working memory performance at baseline was associated with
psychosocial functioning as measured by the Global Assess-
ment of Functioning in our sample of remitted depressed
patients. This finding suggested that working memory is a
particularly critical domain for future studies as a potential
target to improve daily functioning (36).
Previous studies consistently reported improvements in
planning accuracy with single-dose modafinil in healthy vol-
unteers (10–14). However, modafinil did not have a significant
effect on planning accuracy or speed in the current study. The
effects of modafinil on OTS latency varied across studies.
Mean latency scores in the OTS in this study were noteworthy
because both groups took markedly longer times to correction
compared with those in previous studies (37,38). The lack of
improvement in RVIP performance was in line with previous
studies using single-dose modafinil (10–14). This study lends
further support to the conclusion that modafinil does not exert
its effects on domains of memory and executive function via
enhancing attention.
There are several limitations to the current study. First, this
study investigated the acute effects rather than long-term
effects of modafinil. Second, the majority of participants were
on regular antidepressant treatment. However, our study
accurately reflects the clinical population. The unmedicated
group and patients on specific types of antidepressants (e.g.,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin and norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitor) were not sufficiently large to run
separate analyses. Third, there was not a measure for
subjective cognitive complaints, although it appears that
subjective measures are more closely related to the mood
symptoms (39). The diagnoses were made on the basis of
clinical evaluation and previous clinical records, but a struc-
tured interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuro-
psychiatry) for ICD-10 diagnoses was not used. Last, this
proof-of-concept study investigated the cognitive effects of
modafinil on a number of domains, and the findings were
preliminary for future research.
Despite the growing evidence that cognitive dysfunction in
depression extends beyond the episodes, few studies have
sought to examine potential therapeutic interventions to
address those problems. Those including cognitive outcomes
currently focused on treatment of acute episodes along with
cognitive deficits (40). Cognitive deficits in remitted depression
have detrimental effects on life functioning and pose a risk for
relapse. Recurrent depression has been reported to increase
the risk for dementia (41). Recently, achievement of “cognitive
remission” has been proposed as a novel objective for treat-
ment of depression (42,43). Modafinil has been used in various
clinical populations, including depression. Augmentation with
modafinil could be a safe and effective option for acute
depressive episodes (9). This proof-of-concept study sug-
gested that modafinil could improve episodic and working
memory functions in remitted depressed patients. Further
research into the use of modafinil over a longer time period,
and in combination with psychological treatments on cognitive
dysfunction in depression, is warranted.
