Porphyromonas gingivalis infected mice with an established P. gingivalis-specific inflammatory immune response were protected
from developing alveolar bone resorption by therapeutic vaccination with a chimera (KAS2-A1) immunogen targeting the major
virulence factors of the bacterium, the gingipain proteinases. Protection was characterised by an antigen-specific IgG1 isotype
antibody and Th2 cell response. Adoptive transfer of KAS2-A1-specific IgG1 or IgG2 expressing B cells confirmed that IgG1-
mediated protection. Furthermore, parenteral or intraoral administration of KAS2-A1-specific polyclonal antibodies protected
against the development of P. gingivalis-induced bone resorption. The KAS2-A1-specific antibodies neutralised the gingipains by
inhibiting: proteolytic activity, binding to host cells/proteins and co-aggregation with other periodontal bacteria. Combining key
gingipain sequences into a chimera vaccine produced an effective therapeutic intervention that protected against P. gingivalis-
induced periodontitis.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting
tissues of the teeth that is associated with a polymicrobial biofilm
(subgingival plaque) accreted to the tooth which results in
destruction of the tooth’s supporting tissues including the alveolar
bone.1 From epidemiological surveys moderate to severe forms of
periodontitis affect one in three adults2 and the disease has been
linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain
cancers, preterm birth, rheumatoid arthritis and dementia related
to the regular bacteremia and chronic inflammation associated
with the disease.3–7 The global prevalence of severe periodontitis
has been estimated from 2010 epidemiological data to be 10.5–
12.0%8 and the global economic impact of dental diseases, of
which periodontitis is a major component, has been estimated to
be US$442 billion per year.9 The conventional therapy for
periodontitis involves scaling and root planing to remove plaque
microorganisms. Treatment can sometimes involve surgery to
improve access and/or to reduce pocket depth and can also
include the use of antibiotics and/or antimicrobials. However,
treatment outcomes are variable and heavily dependent on
patient compliance. Even in patients on a periodontal main-
tenance program involving regular professional intervention sites
continue to progress and teeth are lost.10
Although chronic periodontitis is associated with a polymicro-
bial biofilm, specific bacterial species of the biofilm such as
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella
forsythia as a complex or consortium have been closely associated
with clinical measures of disease.11,12 Recently the level of
P.
gingivalis
in
subgingival
plaque
above
threshold
levels
of 10–15% of the total bacterial load has been demonstrated to
predict imminent clinical attachment loss (42 mm in 3 months) in
a prospective clinical trial of chronic periodontitis patients on a
clinical maintenance program.10 These results are consistent with
previous studies showing high levels of P. gingivalis at refractory
sites, i.e., sites where disease continued to progress after
conventional scaling and root planing therapy.13–18
P. gingivalis is found at the base of deep periodontal pockets as
microcolony blooms in the superficial layers of subgingival plaque
adjacent to the periodontal pocket epithelium, which helps
explain the strong association with underlying tissue inflammation
and bone resorption at relatively low proportions (10–15%) of the
total bacterial cell load in the pocket.10,19–21 Furthermore, it has
been shown from studies using the mouse periodontitis model
that P. gingivalis is a keystone pathogen, which dysregulates the
host immune response to favour the polymicrobial biofilm
disrupting homeostasis with the host to cause dysbiosis and
disease.22 The mouse periodontitis model has also been used to
show that inflammation is essential to allow establishment of
P. gingivalis at the levels in plaque (10–15% or greater of total
bacterial cell load) necessary to produce dysbiosis and alveolar
bone resorption,23 which makes the mouse model consistent with
human disease.10,23
The extracellular Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases ‘gingipains’
(RgpA/B and Kgp) of P. gingivalis have been implicated as major
virulence factors that are critical for colonisation, penetration into
host tissue, dysregulation of the immune response, dysbiosis and
disease.20,22,24–28 The gingipains, in particular the Lys-specific
proteinase Kgp is essential for P. gingivalis to induce alveolar bone

 resorption in the mouse periodontitis model.29 The gingipains
have also been found in gingival tissue at sites of severe
periodontitis at high concentrations proximal to the subgingival
plaque and at lower concentrations at distal sites deeper into the
gingival tissue.20 This has led to the development of a cogent
mechanism to explain the keystone role played by P. gingivalis in
the development of chronic periodontitis.22,30
The role of P. gingivalis as a keystone pathogen in the initiation
and progression of chronic periodontitis suggests that a strategy
of targeting the major virulence factors of the bacterium, the
gingipains by vaccination may have utility in the prevention of
P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis. Indeed, studies using the
gingipains as a prophylactic vaccine that induces a high-titre
antibody response in naive animals before superinfection with the
pathogen
have
shown
protection
against
alveolar
bone
resorption.25,31,32 However, patients with P. gingivalis-associated
periodontitis harbour the pathogen at above threshold levels in
subgingival
plaque
and
exhibit
an
inflammatory
immune
response,33–37 hence it is possible that therapeutic vaccination
could exacerbate inflammation and bone resorption in these
patients.38 Here we show that therapeutic vaccination with a
chimera antigen targeting the gingipains protects against alveolar
bone resorption in P. gingivalis-associated experimental period-
ontitis and that this protection is mediated via a predominant Th2
anti-inflammatory response with the production of gingipain-
neutralising IgG1 antibodies.
RESULTS
Recombinant protein chimeras of the KAS peptide and KgpA1
domain of the RgpA–Kgp proteinase-adhesin complex are
effective as prophylactic vaccines in experimental periodontitis
We have previously identified antigens from the RgpA–Kgp
complex that protect against P. gingivalis-induced lesions and
alveolar
bone
resorption.25,31,39
We
hypothesised
that
a
recombinant
chimera
of
the
most
effective
antigens;
a
Lys-gingipain active site peptide (KAS) and a recombinant
Kgp-A1 adhesin sequence may exhibit enhanced protection
against
P.
gingivalis
induced
disease
by
neutralising
both
proteolytic
and
adhesin
functions
of
the
virulence
factor
(Supplementary Figure 1). On the basis of epitope mapping and
structural
modelling
of
the
Kgp
proteinase
and
adhesin
domain25,31 two chimera proteins were produced; KAS1-sA1
representing the minimal immunogenic sequences of KAS (Kgp-
cat, 432–454) and KgpA1 (759–989) and KAS2-A1, which extended
the minimal immunogenic sequences of KAS (Kgp-cat, 433–468)
and KgpA1 (751–1056) (Supplementary Figure 2).
Immunogenicity studies showed that KAS1-sA1 and KAS2-A1
antisera recognised KAS2 peptide, KgpA1(751–1056) and FK-
P. gingivalis W50 cells at comparable or higher levels when
compared with antisera generated to KAS2-DT, KgpA1(759–989),
KgpA1(751–1056) and FK-P. gingivalis W50 cells (Figure 1). Only
the recombinant chimera proteins were found to recognise all
three
(KAS2,
KgpA1
and
P.
gingivalis
W50
cells)
antigens
(Figure 1a). Western blot analysis showed that the KAS1-sA1 and
KAS2-A1 antisera recognised the Kgp proteinase and adhesin
domains (Figures 1b–d). Epitope mapping of the lysine proteinase
active site sequence (433–468) identified that the antigenic
epitopes for both KAS1 and KAS2 were around the His(444)
catalytic residue30,39 (Supplementary Figure 3). For KAS1 the major
epitopes were 444HGSETAWADPL4544434TGVSFANYTA443 and for
KAS2
447ETAWADPLL4554434TGVSFANYTA443 = 456TTSQLKAL463.
These
antigenic
epitopes
matched
those
induced
by
the
KAS2-DT
conjugate
indicating
that
the
KAS
epitope
in
KAS1-sA1
and
KAS2-A1
remained
antigenic
(Supplementary
Figure 3).
The recombinant proteins KAS1-sA1, KAS2-A1, KgpA1(759–989),
KgpA1(751–1056);
FK-P.
gingivalis
W50
and
the
RgpA–Kgp
complex were used to immunise BALB/c mice to determine their
efficacy as prophylactic vaccines against P. gingivalis-induced
alveolar bone resorption. Mice immunised with all of the
recombinant antigens, RgpA–Kgp complex and FK-W50 cells
exhibited significantly (Po0.001) less bone loss compared with
that of the PBS control group (Figure 2a). Both KAS2-A1 and
KAS1-sA1 immunised mice exhibited significantly less alveolar
bone resorption than the mice immunised with the RgpA–Kgp
complex. KAS2-A1 provided a greater level of protection (Po0.01)
than KgpA1(759–989), KgpA1(751–1056) or FK-P. gingivalis W50.
Prior to intra-oral challenge with P. gingivalis each mouse group
immunised with one of the immunogens had a high IgG antibody
titre to FK-P. gingivalis W50 cells with a predominant IgG1
antibody subclass and only weakly immunoreactive IgG2a, IgG2b
and IgG3 responses (Figure 2b). Post intra-oral challenge with
P. gingivalis W50 each of the protective immunogens retained a
predominant and significantly (Po0.05) higher IgG1 antibody
subclass response to P. gingivalis (Figure 2c). However, the PBS/IFA
immunised group had a predominant and significantly (Po0.05)
higher
IgG2b
antibody
subclass
response
to
P.
gingivalis
(Figure 2c). Based on the above data the KAS2-A1 chimera
was chosen as the lead vaccine candidate to be used in
subsequent studies.

 KAS2-A1 chimera prophylactic vaccine confers protection against
P. gingivalis-induced bone resorption at low antigen doses
The KAS2-A1 chimera was formulated with aluminium hydroxide
(alum) and BALB/c mice were immunised with 50 μg, 5.0 μg or
0.5 μg per dose (being adult human equivalent doses of 12, 1.2
and 0.12 mg40) (Figure 3). The KAS2-A1 formulated in alum
at all doses trialed conferred significant (Po0.01) protection
against P. gingivalis-induced bone loss (Figure 3a). There was no
significant difference in the level of bone loss for the positive
intervention (amoxicillin-treated), positive vaccination (RgpA–Kgp
complex/IFA) and all of the KAS2-A1/alum immunised groups
(Figure 3a).
Mice immunised with KAS2-A1/alum at each dose or the
RgpA–Kgp complex/IFA had a high IgG titre to FK-P. gingivalis W50
cells with a predominant IgG1 subclass (Figure 3b). The PBS/alum
immunised group and the infected control groups had a
predominant and significantly (Po0.05) higher IgG2b antibody
subclass response to P. gingivalis (Figure 3b).
To determine the cellular interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-4 cytokine
response for each group following P. gingivalis oral infection,
submandibular lymph node (SMLN) T cells and gingival tissue
lymphocytes were isolated and the number of P. gingivalis-specific
cytokine producing cells determined by ELISPOT (Figure 3c). The
PBS/alum treated and P. gingivalis-infected control groups had
significantly (Po0.05) higher numbers of IFNγ secreting SMLN
T
cells
and
gingival
lymphocytes.
Mice
immunised
with
KAS2-A1/alum at all doses had significantly (Po0.05) higher

characteristic of a Th2 predominant response.
Protective efficacy of the KAS2-A1 chimera in a therapeutic
vaccination periodontitis model
To develop a therapeutic vaccination model we first conducted a
time course study to determine the timing of a distinct
P. gingivalis-specific immune response post intra-oral challenge
(infection). Figure 4a shows that only challenge with viable
P. gingivalis W50 cells, and not formalin-killed (FK) P. gingivalis
cells,
induced
significant
(Po0.05)
bone
loss.
Infiltrating
gingival CD4+ T cells were significantly (Po0.05) higher in
numbers on days 8, 17, 28 and 56 in the viable P. gingivalis
infected group compared with the uninfected control and the
FK-P. gingivalis challenged group (Figure 4b). A significantly
(Po0.05) higher number of P. gingivalis-specific IFNγ and IL-17
secreting
T
cells
and
P.
gingivalis-specific
serum
antibody
responses were found on days, 17, 28 and 56 for the viable
P. gingivalis infected group compared with the uninfected control
and the FK-P. gingivalis challenged group (Figures 4c–f). The time
course study showed that only challenge with viable P. gingivalis
cells induced bone loss and that an antigen-specific immune
response was established from day 17 and onwards after
the first oral challenge. Hence, for the therapeutic vaccination

 protect against challenge and superinfection with all three species
(Figure 6). The P. gingivalis/T. denticola/T. forsythia challenged
animals exhibited a slightly higher level of bone resorption when
compared with the animals challenged with P. gingivalis alone at
the higher dose confirming bacterial synergy in bone loss with
these species.41 KAS2-A1 formulated in alum conferred significant
(Po0.01) protection against P. gingivalis/T. denticola/T. forsythia-
induced bone loss (Figure 6a). KAS2-A1 immunised animals had a
predominant P. gingivalis-specific IgG1 (Figure 6b) and IL-4
secreting T-cell response (Figure 6c). For both P. gingivalis/
T. denticola/T. forsythia and P. gingivalis infected control groups,
only a P. gingivalis-specific antibody, IgG2b dominant (Figure 6b),
and IFNγ secreting T-cell response (Figure 6c) was detected. No
significant immune responses were observed towards T. forsythia
or T. denticola.
Isolation and phenotyping of gingival CD69+ (early activated)
and CD25+ (activated/antigen stimulated) CD4+ T cells showed
that KAS2-A1 immunised animals had a significantly higher
population of CD25+ but not CD69+, CD4+ gingival T cells
compared with the non-infected (NC) animals. The P. gingivalis/
T. denticola/T. forsythia and P. gingivalis infected control groups
had a significantly higher population of CD25+ and CD69+,
CD4+ gingival T cells compared with the non-infected and
KAS2-A1 immunised animals. Taken together, the results indicate
that the KAS2-A1 immunised/infected groups had developed a
Th2
(IL-4
secreting)
antigen-stimulated
gingival
T-cell
population, whereas the P. gingivalis/T. denticola/T. forsythia and
P. gingivalis alone infected, control groups exhibited a Th1
(INFγ secreting) early and antigen activated gingival T-cell
population.

transferred into recipient mice (Ly5.2 C57Bl6 congenic mice). The
day following the adoptive transfer mice were orally infected with
P. gingivalis and bone loss determined. Mice that received
CD4+ T cells, IgG2 expressing B cells from KAS2-A1 immunised
mice or B cells from ovalbumin immunised mice developed
P. gingivalis-induced bone loss at a similar level to that in the

 infected control group and had a predominant IgG2a/b response
to P. gingivalis (Figures 7a and b). However, mice that received
IgG1 expressing B cells from KAS2-A1 immunised mice did not
develop P. gingivalis-induced bone loss and had similar alveolar
bone levels to that in the non-infected (NC) control group and a
predominant IgG1 response to P. gingivalis. Cellular phenotyping
of the gingival and SMLN lymphocytes showed that mice which
received IgG1 expressing B cells from KAS2-A1 immunised mice
had a higher percentage of CD19+/CD138+ plasma B cells in
SMLNs as well as being the only group to exhibit an increase in
these cells in the gingival lymphocyte population (Supplementary
Figure 4). These data indicate that B cells and not CD4+ T cells are
pivotal for protection against P. gingivalis-induced bone loss and
that antigen-specific IgG1, and not IgG2, is the critical IgG subclass
that mediates protection.
To investigate whether KAS2-A1-specific antibodies when
passively administered were able to facilitate protection against
bone loss in the periodontitis model, rabbits were immunised with
KAS2-A1 and polyclonal antibodies (pAb) purified using protein
A/G columns. The antigenicity of the purified pAb was confirmed
by ELISA and Western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure 5) and
used
prophylactically
or
therapeutically
in
the
respective
periodontitis models. In one treatment group, BALB/c mice were
injected (i.p.) with KAS2-A1-pAb (500 μg per mouse) one day
prior to (prophylactic model) or on day 19 post (therapeutic
model) oral challenge with P. gingivalis to evaluate whether
systemic administration could mediate protection. In a second

 KAS2-A1-pAb neutralisation of gingipain activities and binding to
P. gingivalis
Several studies have shown that the Lys-X and Arg-X proteolytic
activity, binding to oral epithelial cells, host matrix and blood
proteins and co-aggregation with T. denticola are activities by
which gingipains contribute to P. gingivalis virulence.24,29,41–47 We
investigated the ability of purified KAS2-A1-pAb compared with a
non-specific (NS, PBS/alum)-pAb to inhibit each of these gingipain
activities associated with the bacterium’s pathogenicity (Figure 8).
The KAS2-A1-pAb inhibited P. gingivalis whole-cell Lys-X proteo-
lytic activity within 30 min and the level of inhibition slightly
increased with incubation time (Figure 8a). Interestingly, the
KAS2-A1-pAb also inhibited P. gingivalis whole-cell Arg-X proteo-
lytic activity after 4 h of incubation and this increased at the 24 h
time point. The ability to inhibit both Lys-X and Arg-X proteolytic
activities can be attributed to the sequence similarity of the Kgp
and Rgp active sites and that the minimal antigenic sequence for
KAS2 (identified in Supplementary Figure 3) also occurs in the
Arg-proteinases; RgpA and RgpB. KAS2-A1-pAb was also found to
significantly inhibit P. gingivalis whole cells from binding to oral
(OKF6-TERT2) epithelial cells and from co-aggregation with
T. denticola (Figures 8b,c). The antibodies also significantly
inhibited RgpA–Kgp binding to the host proteins; fibronectin,
fibrinogen and haemoglobin (Figure 8d).
Further, the KAS2-A1-pAb was found to recognise all of thirteen
P. gingivalis strains representing the major laboratory strains,
serotypes A-D43,48 and clinical isolates (from different regions of
the World) tested at a similar antibody titre when compared with
RgpA–Kgp complex antibodies (Supplementary Figure 7). These
data suggest that the KAS2-A1 chimera should produce antibodies
that would cross-react with all currently known P. gingivalis strains.
DISCUSSION
The results of our study indicate that a chimera vaccine
comprising the active site sequence (KAS) and the A1 adhesin
domain of the Lys-specific gingipain Kgp when administered

pretreated with antibiotics and orally challenged with a total of four doses of 1.0 × 1010 total cells of P. gingivalis W50 or 1.0 × 1010 total cells of
P. gingivalis W50/T. denticola/T. forsythia or treated with PG buffer containing 2% CMC alone (non-challenged group N-C). Bacteria-induced

 therapeutically switched a predominant Th1/Th17 inflammatory
response to a predominant Th2 response generating gingipain-
neutralising IgG1 antibodies, which protected against P. gingivalis-
induced alveolar bone resorption. The vaccination prevented the
emergence of P. gingivalis in subgingival plaque above threshold
levels (10–15%) that cause dysbiosis and disease. The neutralising
ability of the chimera-generated antibodies was confirmed as the
antibodies
inhibited
RgpA/B
and
Kgp
proteolytic
activities,
inhibited binding of the RgpA–Kgp complex to host proteins,
inhibited
binding
to
oral
epithelial
cells
and
inhibited
co-aggregation with T. denticola. The abilities of P. gingivalis to
adhere to oral epithelial cells and co-aggregate with T. denticola
have been identified as key processes in colonisation and
pathogenicity; and the gingipains have been shown to have a
major role in these processes.24,29,41–47 The neutralisation of
gingipain activity would help explain the protective mechanism
of the antibodies in terms of preventing alveolar bone resorption
as the gingipains are essential for P. gingivalis virulence and have
been shown to be critical for colonisation, penetration into host
tissue,
dysregulation
of
the
immune
response,
chronic
inflammation, dysbiosis and alveolar bone resorption.20,22,24–28
The protection conferred by the chimera vaccine was also

P. gingivalis, T. denticola and T. forsythia confirming the key
pathogenic role of P. gingivalis. Recently, the targeting of keystone
bacterial pathogens in the diverse microbial communities of saliva
and the gut has been shown to not only result in the reduction in
the level of the keystone pathogen, but also in the level of
synergistic accessory pathogens and the promotion and restora-
tion of commensal species and homeostasis.49–51 The KAS-A1

 chimera-specific antibodies recognised all of the P. gingivalis
serotypes, laboratory-type strains and clinical isolates tested,
indicating high conservation of the gingipain active site and
A1 adhesin sequences.
The protection conferred by the chimera vaccine was mediated
by the gingipain-neutralising IgG1 antibodies generated as shown
by the adoptive transfer and passive administration (systemic and
topical) experiments. An interesting result from these experiments
was that the KAS2-A1 specific IgG2-expressing B cells were not
protective and did not home to the SMLN or gingiva as effectively
as the IgG1 expressing B cells. Also, the adoptive transfer of the
KAS2-A1 stimulated CD4+ T cells did not protect mice from
P. gingivalis induced bone resorption indicating that antigen-
specific
T
helper
cells
alone
are
insufficient
to
stimulate
production of specific gingipain antibodies and induce protection.
Th cells are nevertheless important in periodontitis as a protective
response to the chimera vaccine was characterised by a switch
from a Th1/Th17- to a Th2-biased response. This is consistent with
previous studies in mice and humans where periodontitis
progression has been associated with a predominant Th1/Th17
response
and
health/stability
has
been
associated
with
a
predominant Th2 response.33–37,52 In fact, Moutsopoulos et al.34
have shown that P. gingivalis, facilitated by the gingipain
proteinases induced Th17 cell activation and that these cells

 may have a major role in orchestrating chronic inflammation. Our
current data showing that Th17 cells are a major T-cell subset at
the onset of P. gingivalis-induced disease in mice corroborates
these findings. Hence, the ability of anti-KAS2-A1 antibodies to
inhibit P. gingivalis proteinase activity would help reduce the
activation of Th17 cells; thus ameliorating the inflammatory
immune response orchestrated by these cells.
T helper cells also have an important role as the Th immune bias
does effect antibody class switching as antigen-stimulated B cells
secrete IgG1 or IgG2a/b/G3 subclasses in the presence of IL-4 or
IFNγ, respectively.53,54 Antibody subclasses are known to con-
tribute to the progression of the immune response to a pathogen
and have substantial impacts on immunotherapeutic or immuno-
pathogenic outcomes.55,56 Phagocytosis of murine IgG1 opsonised
pathogens induces anti-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine secre-
tion, whereas, IgG2a/b/G3 opsonised pathogens stimulate an
inflammatory
cytokine/chemokine
response
upon
phagocytosis.53,54 We have previously shown in humans with a
high IgG4 (mouse IgG1 equivalent) response to P. gingivalis that
they are periodontally stable and recognise epitopes in the KgpA1
adhesin domain that are not recognised by periodontitis patients
with progressive disease who have a high IgG2 (mouse IgG2a/b
equivalent) response to P. gingivalis LPS.33 These A1 adhesin
epitopes (EP1–3 and ABM1–3, Supplementary Figure 1) have been
shown to be protective and are incorporated into the chimera
vaccine.
The KAS2-A1 chimera formulated in a regulatory approved
adjuvant ‘alum’ was an effective therapeutic vaccine against the
induction
of
periodontal
bone
loss
in
the
mouse
model
suggesting that it may have utility in the adjunctive treatment
to scaling and root planing for patients with chronic periodontitis
who have a pre-existing immune response to P. gingivalis. Several
clinical studies in humans support the concept of vaccination with
the gingipains and the generation of protective antibodies to
prevent P. gingivalis emergence in plaque and progression of
periodontitis.33,57,58
Booth
et
al.57
showed
that
subgingival
application of an anti-gingipain A1 adhesin monoclonal antibody
could prevent recolonisation of subgingival plaque by P. gingivalis.
This result was confirmed by Yokokama et al.58 using anti-
gingipain antibodies who showed a reduction in the plaque levels
of P. gingivalis and also a significant reduction in pocket depth and
bleeding on probing in the periodontitis patients who received
the specific antibodies. O’Brien-Simpson et al.33 showed that
subjects who had naturally developed a specific IgG4 response to
the gingipains did not exhibit progressive disease and appeared
stable compared with those subjects with predominant IgG2/IgG3
responses. These results are consistent with periodontitis in
humans
being
associated
with
an
inflammatory
Th1/Th17
response (high IgG3/IgG2), whereas periodontal health/stability
is more associated with an anti-inflammatory Th2 response (high
IgG4/IgG1) as discussed above.
In conclusion, the results suggest that vaccination of humans
with chronic periodontitis using the P. gingivalis gingipain chimera
as an adjunct to scaling and root planing should induce a switch
to a Th2 (less inflammatory) response generating gingipain
neutralising antibodies that should help prevent re-emergence
of P. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and thereby prevent
dysbiosis and disease progression. As chronic periodontitis is a
known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, sponta-
neous preterm birth and low-birth-weight infants, pancreatic
cancer and rheumatoid arthritis59–63 the vaccine may also have
broader health benefits.
