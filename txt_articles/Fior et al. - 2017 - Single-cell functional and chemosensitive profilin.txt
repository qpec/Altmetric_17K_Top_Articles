Cancer is as unique as the person fighting it. With the exception of
a few biomarker-driven therapies, patients go through rounds
of trial-and-error approaches to find the best treatment. Using
patient-derived cell lines, we show that zebrafish larvae xeno-
transplants constitute a fast and highly sensitive in vivo model for
differential therapy response, with resolution to reveal intratumor
functional cancer heterogeneity. We screened international colorec-
tal cancer therapeutic guidelines and determined distinct functional
tumor behaviors (proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis) and
differential sensitivities to standard therapy. We observed a general
higher sensitivity to FOLFIRI [5-fluorouracil(FU)+irinotecan+folinic
acid] than to FOLFOX (5-FU+oxaliplatin+folinic acid), not only be-
tween isogenic tumors but also within the same tumor. We directly
compared zebrafish xenografts with mouse xenografts and show
that relative sensitivities obtained in zebrafish are maintained in
the rodent model. Our data also illustrate how KRAS mutations can
provide proliferation advantages in relation to KRASWT and how
chemotherapy can unbalance this advantage, selecting for a minor
clone resistant to chemotherapy. Zebrafish xenografts provide re-
markable resolution to measure Cetuximab sensitivity. Finally, we
demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient samples to gen-
erate zebrafish patient-derived xenografts (zPDX) and provide proof-
of-concept experiments that compare response to chemotherapy and
biological therapies between patients and zPDX. Altogether, our re-
sults suggest that zebrafish larvae xenografts constitute a promising
fast assay for precision medicine, bridging the gap between genotype
and phenotype in an in vivo setting.

C
hemotherapy regimens are developed and approved according
to a demonstration of average efficacy and safety. However,
efficacy rates are averages of individual responses. As a result of
this “one-size-fits-all” approach, treatments may prove to be
successful for some patients but not for others. This is especially
relevant in the metastatic scenario where oncology therapy
guidelines reach branch points and clinicians face equivalent valid
compounds, i.e., with similar average response rates. Conse-
quently, many patients go through inefficient treatments, being
subjected to unnecessary toxicity.
The current gold standard in cancer biology for personalized
screening is direct primary tumor transplantation into immune-
compromised mice, also known as patient-derived xenografts
(PDX). PDX can generally maintain both interindividual and
genetic heterogeneity of original tumors, mimicking disease re-
sponses in patients and thus reflecting the uniqueness of each
patient (1). However, mouse PDX present two major drawbacks
for routine clinical assays: the amount of patient sample required
and the time frame for engraftment and expansion of colonies
(months), rendering them unviable for clinical practice.
Zebrafish xenografts offer speed, cellular resolution, and the
ability to perform large numbers of transplants (2–4). They also
allow evaluation of crucial hallmarks of cancer, such as meta-
static (5, 6) and angiogenic potentials (5, 7, 8). Even though drug
pharmacodynamics in zebrafish may differ from mammals, many
compounds have been shown to block disease in a similar way.
This has led to an increasing amount of compounds discovered
in zebrafish screens that are entering into human clinical trials
(2–4). However, for zebrafish xenografts to be used as clinical
assays, it is crucial that they provide sufficient resolution to reveal
intertumor and intratumor functional heterogeneity, including
differential response to therapy. Reliable methods to visualize
and quantify human cells and induced cell death upon treatment
and direct validation with mouse xenografts are also still lacking.
With the aim of testing zebrafish xenotransplants as a screening
platform for cancer therapy, we used a panel of patient-derived
human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to screen the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/European Society for
Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment guidelines for advanced
CRC. We selected independent cell lines to investigate intertumor
Significance
Despite advances in targeted cancer treatments, we still lack
methods to predict how a specific cancer will respond to a
given therapy. As a consequence, patients go through rounds
of trial-and-error approaches based on guidelines to find the
best treatment, often subjected to unnecessary toxicity. Using
cell lines, we used zebrafish larvae xenografts as sensors for
cancer behavior and therapy guideline screening. Our data
show not only sufficient resolution to distinguish functional
tumor behaviors in just 4 days but also differential sensitivity
to colorectal cancer therapy. As proof-of-principle, we provide
evidence for similar behavior response to therapies in patients
as in zebrafish patient-derived xenografts. Altogether, our re-
sults suggest zebrafish larvae xenografts as a promising in vivo
screening platform for precision medicine.

 heterogeneity and isogenic clones to examine intratumor heterogeneity.
In just 4 days, we could detect in vivo differential behaviors with
single-cell resolution, namely differential proliferation rates, met-
astatic and angiogenic potentials. These differences were present
not only in tumors derived from different patients but also be-
tween different clones from the same tumor, even when mixed
into a polyclonal tumor. We showed that early readouts of response
to treatment in zebrafish closely mirror the results obtained in mice.
We also found that the zebrafish xenograft model revealed a re-
markable sensitivity to detect differential responses to Cetuximab
treatment according to the KRAS mutational status.
Finally, as a proof-of-principle, we generated CRC zebrafish
PDX (zPDX) derived from surgery-resected human samples and
treated them with the same treatment administered to the patient.
Altogether, our results suggest that zebrafish xenografts are a fast
and highly sensitive assay that can be used to display multiple
biological tumor traits and assess tumor response to treatment.
We propose that this model can be used, not only in the research
setting, but also possibly in the future for precision medicine.
Results
Human CRCs Display Diverse Implantation and Proliferation Potentials
in Zebrafish Xenografts. Our strategy relies on the ability of zebrafish
xenotransplants to unravel intertumor and intratumor functional
heterogeneity. To address this question, we selected several hu-
man CRC cell lines isolated from different patients (intertumor
heterogeneity) and isogenic pairs (intratumor heterogeneity) de-
scribed in Table S1. SW480 was derived from the primary tumor
and SW620 from the lymph node metastasis (6 mo later) of the
same patient, illustrating a history of clonal selection (9). HCT116
KRASG13D tumor cells were isolated from a patient with colorectal
carcinoma. Hke3 cells were generated from HCT116 by a somatic
deletion of the KRASG13D allele, reverting the oncogenic KRAS
phenotype (10). This pair is considered isogenic and constitutes
an ideal setting to study phenotypic heterogeneity derived from
one single mutation (intratumor heterogeneity). Finally, HT29
cells were isolated from a well-differentiated metastatic tumor,
belonging to the goblet-like subtype (11), serving as an outgroup.
To determine the implantation potential of these five human
CRC cell lines, cells were labeled with a lipophilic dye (DiI) and
injected into the periviteline space (PVS) of 48-h-postfertilization
(hpf) zebrafish embryos (8). At 4 days postinjection (dpi), we
scored the efficiency of implantation (Fig. 1 A–E and Fig. S1).
With the exception of SW480 cells, we observed high implantation
efficiency in all cell lines (>70%) (Fig. S1).
One of the most fundamental hallmarks of cancer is the ca-
pacity to proliferate with no constrains (12). To measure pro-
liferation in vivo, we quantified mitotic figures and the Ki-67 index
(which specifically recognizes human cells, with no cross-reactivity
with zebrafish) (Fig. 1 F–J′′). We found that the Ki-67 and mitotic
index varied between cells derived from different patients (Fig. 1 Z
and Z′). Direct comparison between isogenic pairs (intratumor
heterogeneity) revealed that SW620 and HCT116 have higher
proliferation rates in relation to their isogenic pairs SW480 (Ki-67
P < 0.0001; mitosis P = 0.0063) and Hke3 (Ki-67 P < 0.0001; mitosis
P = 0.0003) (Fig. 1 Z and Z′). To further confirm that human CRC
cells are actively proliferating in the zebrafish host, we delivered a
2-h pulse of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) prior fixation, labeling
specifically cells that were undergoing DNA replication (Fig. 1 P–T).
EdU incorporation demonstrates that human cells can actively
proliferate in the zebrafish xenograft model.
We also investigated whether the immunohistochemical profile
and typical morphological features described for these cell lines
were maintained in the zebrafish xenografts (Fig. S2). As expected
for more-differentiated cells, HT29 formed tubular structures
(Fig. S2 E′, O, T, and T′), whereas tumors originating from the
other cell lines showed a solid pattern with rare tubule formation,
consistent with their “stem cell-like” character (11) (Fig. S2).
We next examined angiogenesis, another essential hallmark
of cancer (12). The five cancer cell lines were injected into
Tg(fli:eGFP) zebrafish line with GFP-labeled vasculature (13). At
4 dpi, xenografts were imaged by confocal microscopy to study
vessel 3D architecture (Fig. 1 U–Y). SW480, SW620, HCT116, and
Hke3 tumors showed a well-vascularized periphery, composed of
large vessels that generally do not infiltrate the tumor (Fig. 1 U–Y,
Z′′, and Z′′′ and Movies S1–S4). In contrast, HT29 are highly
vascularized tumors, with formation of a dense vessel network
that infiltrates into the core of the tumor (Fig. 1 Y, Z′′, and Z′′′
and Movies S5 and S6). This is consistent with HT29 expressing
high levels of VEGF and high angiogenic potential in other
models (14, 15).
Our data conclusively show that human CRC cells can sustain
proliferation in zebrafish and present different proliferation dy-
namics in CRC tumors derived from different patients and
isogenic tumors. In addition, human CRC cells maintain their
general cellular characteristics and angiogenic potential in the
zebrafish xenografts.
Isogenic Human CRC Cells Present Different Metastatic Potentials.
Another essential hallmark of cancer is the ability of cells to form
metastasis (12). At 4 dpi, we could detect several small groups of
cells in the brain, optic cup, gills, and skeletal muscle and in the
caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) region (Fig. 2 A–E). Cells in
the CHT often extravasate from vessels (Movie S7) and invade
adjacent tissues, frequently the muscle (Fig. 2D, arrows). This “hot
spot” region for tumor cell colonization provides an ideal location
for quantification of metastatic potential (6). Immunofluorescence
for HLA (anti-human MHC class I subunit) identifies unequivo-
cally cells of human origin and delineates the cellular architecture
of the micrometastasis (Fig. 2 K–O). Ki-67 positive cells and mi-
totic figures at 4 dpi suggest that colonization has been achieved
(Fig. 2 F–J and R).
Metastatic efficiency may vary and depends on whether a tu-
mor cell can detach from the primary tumor, enter and survive in
circulation, and go on to seed cells at distant sites. We designed a
simple assay to distinguish between early stages (invasion of sur-
rounding tissues and intravasation into blood vessels) and later
stages of the metastatic cascade (survival in circulation, extrava-
sation, and colonization) (16, 17) by comparing the micrometa-
stasis efficiency when cells were placed directly into circulation vs.
when not. For that, we injected CRC cell lines either into the PVS
alone (group_a) or directly into circulation (group_b) (Fig. 2P). At
4 dpi, we analyzed the number of xenografts that presented a tumor
cell mass (>20 cells) away from the PVS injection site (CHT).
For tumor cells in group_a to efficiently establish metastasis,
they would have to go through all of the metastatic steps (from
early to late steps), whereas cells in group_b only have to go
through the later-stage ones. Thus, considering that maximum
metastatic efficiency is achieved when cells are placed in circu-
lation (group_b), the reduction of colonization in group_a would
reflect the effort to undergo the early metastatic steps. There-
fore, we converted our frequency of CHT colonization into Early
Metastatic Potential (EMP) and Late Metastatic Potential (LMP)
(Fig. 2P and SI Materials and Methods).
Overall, our data show that tumors differed both in their EMP
(ANOVA P = 0.0044) and LMP (ANOVA P = 0.028) (Fig. 2Q).
When comparing isogenic lines, we observed that SW480 cells
have a higher EMP than SW620 (P = 0.004) even though they
exhibit similar LMP (Fig. 2Q). These results agree with previous
observations that SW480 cells are more invasive and migratory
than SW620 in vitro and show higher extravasation potential in
vivo (9, 18).
The isogenic pair HCT116/Hke3 showed different EMP (Fig.
2 H, I, and Q, ***P < 0.0001); i.e., in Hke3 KRASWT xenografts,
we could only find metastasis when cells were directly injected
into circulation (Fig. 2 I, N, and Q, P < 0.0001), highlighting the

 reported roles for activated KRAS in early metastatic events
(17–19).
Finally, HT29 cells showed high EMP and LMP, frequently
forming organized masses in the eye and CHT (Fig. 2 A, J, O,
and Q). This high metastatic potential is consistent with the one
observed in mouse xenograft models (20).
Our results show that it is possible to further discriminate the
cellular metastatic potential by comparing the efficiency of cells
in metastasizing when placed directly into circulation or not.
Importantly, we found that the measurement of metastatic po-
tential in our model matches that previously described.
Zebrafish Xenografts Discriminate Different Chemosensitivities in
4 days. To test whether zebrafish xenografts can measure responses
to therapy, we first assessed the main therapeutic options in ad-
vanced CRC guidelines: 5-fluorouracil(FU)+oxaliplatin+folinic
acid (FOLFOX) and 5-FU+irinotecan+folinic acid (FOLFIRI)
(ref. 19 and Table S2). These protocols are considered as balanced
alternatives, since both treatments have shown equivalent average
response rates (∼35%) in clinical trials performed on naïve pa-
tients (21).
To assess chemotherapeutic responses, all xenografts were ran-
domly distributed between treatment groups (control, FOLFOX,

Implantation and histological analysis of human CRC zebrafish-xenografts. Human CRC cells (SW480; SW620; HCT116; Hke3 and HT29) were labeled
with DiI dye (red) and injected into the PVS of 48-hpf zebrafish. At 4 dpi, the number of xenografts with a tumor implanted was quantified (A–E), and the
average (AVG) implantation rate was determined from at least three independent experiments. Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 in paraffin sections at 4-dpi
xenografts (F–J′). Images were obtained using a Zeiss AxioScan Z1, generating tiled images. Note that a fine line of agarose inclusion might be detected
around the xenograft due to the agarose embedding step prior to paraffin inclusion. Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining at 4 dpi, for Ki-67 (F′′–J′′).

 and FOLFIRI) at 24 h postinjection (hpi) and then treated for three
consecutive days. After 3 days of treatment (and 4 dpi), xenografts
were processed for microscopy and assessed for mitotic index, cell
death by apoptosis (activated caspase3), and tumor size (Fig. 3 P–R).
FOLFIRI treatment induced a significant reduction of mitotic
figures in all tumors (Fig. 3P). However, a significant induction
of apoptosis followed by a reduction of tumor mass was only
observed in HCT116 (apoptosis P < 0.0001; 59% tumor reduction
P < 0.0001) and SW620 (apoptosis P = 0.0021; 35% tumor re-
duction P = 0.0026) (Fig. 3 L, M, Q, and R). Remarkably,
SW620 and HCT116 are more sensitive than their respective
isogenic pairs. These results suggest differential sensitivities to
therapy throughout cancer progression (primary vs. metastasis)
and in heterogeneous tumor populations (KRAS subclones).
Only in HCT116, FOLFOX treatment resulted in significant
induction of apoptosis accompanied by a reduction of tumor size
(apoptosis P < 0.0001; 44% reduction P = 0.0018) (Fig. 3 H, Q,
and R). Strikingly, Hke3 (HCT116 isogenic pair) showed no
induction of apoptosis or reduction of tumor mass when treated
with FOLFOX (Fig. 3 I, Q, and R). These results are consistent
with KRAS mutations increasing sensitivity to 5-FU-induced
apoptosis (22). As for HT29, as previously reported in mouse
xenografts (23), we could observe a significant reduction of
mitotic figures (P < 0.0001) and increase in apoptosis upon
both FOLFIRI (P < 0.0001) and FOLFOX treatment (P <
0.0001) (Fig. 3 P and Q).
In general, our results are consistent with previous mouse in
vivo studies (23, 24), with the exception of SW620, which has been
reported to respond to FOLFOX (24). The differences observed
in our study are likely to reflect that our assay is designed to detect
fast strong responses, given its short time window (3 days). This is
particularly evident in the study by Van Schaeybroeck (24) where
HCT116 tumors stop growing as soon as FOLFOX treatment is
initiated, whereas SW620 shows a delayed response.
In summary, we show that zebrafish larvae xenografts have
enough resolution to measure interpatient and intrapatient het-
erogeneity in chemotherapy responses in just 4 days. These re-
sults highlight the heterogeneity of chemotherapeutic response
and the possibility of measuring this in a very short period in vivo.
To further confirm the HCT116 (KRASMUT) and Hke3 (KRASWT)
opposing chemosensitive profiles, we challenged them in the
same xenograft host. For that, we coinjected the two cell lines
(1:1), each labeled with a different lipophilic dye. Mixed xenografts
(HCT116+Hke3) were randomly distributed into FOLFIRI and
control groups. As expected, given their higher proliferative po-
tential, HCT116 KRASMUT cells outcompete Hke3 KRASWT and
become dominant in the mix, representing ∼80% of the tumor
(Fig. 3 S and U). However, upon FOLFIRI treatment, HCT116
significantly reduced its frequency (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3 T and U).
Consistent with the individual response to FOLFIRI treatment,
we observed a significant increase in apoptosis (P = 0.0023) and a
decrease in mitotic figures (P < 0.0001), accompanied by a signif-
icant decrease in HCT116 tumor size (∼56% reduction P < 0.0001)
(Fig. 3 V–X). In contrast, Hke3 clone size did not change upon
FOLFIRI treatment, remaining at similar levels to controls (Fig. 3X).
These results demonstrate the differential chemosensitive
profiles of both cell lines and how the KRAS mutation sensitizes
cells to chemotherapy (22). Our data also illustrate how, in hetero-
geneous tumors, KRAS mutations can provide a proliferation benefit,
and how chemotherapy may disrupt this advantage, selecting the
minor clone resistant to treatment, which then may be responsible
for relapses.
HCT116 and Hke3 Mouse Xenografts Show Similar Chemosensitive
Profile to Zebrafish Xenografts. To directly compare the HCT116
and Hke3 chemosensitive profile determined in zebrafish with
mouse xenografts, we generated HCT116/Hke3 double mouse
xenografts, controlling treatment efficacy and delivery in the
same animal (25). After 14 days, mice were randomly distributed
among treatment groups and treated with three cycles of che-
motherapy (Fig. 4).
Similarly to our zebrafish xenograft results, Hke3 mouse tumors
presented a reduced mitotic index upon FOLFIRI treatment but
not with FOLFOX (Fig. 4 D–F′ and G), and no significant differ-
ence in apoptosis was observed with both treatments (Fig. 4H). Also
in agreement with what we observed in zebrafish, both FOLFOX
and FOLFIRI induced a significant increase in apoptosis in
HCT116 cells (Fig. 4 A′–C′ and H) and reduced proliferation
(Fig. 4 G and H) albeit to a lesser extent in FOLFOX than in
FOLFIRI (FOLFOX vs. FOLFIRI: apoptosis P = 0.0017, mi-
totic figures P = 0.029), closely resembling the zebrafish results
(Fig. 3 P and Q).
However, we were unable to detect clear differences in tu-
mor size between control and treatment groups in our mouse
xenograft study (Fig. 4I). This contrasts not only with our zebrafish
xenograft results (Fig. 3R) but also with previous mouse studies,
where FOLFOX reduces the size of HCT116 tumors (24). The
inability to detect tumor reduction in mouse xenografts is likely to

 rely on different experimental designs (treatment initiation 3 days
vs. 14 days postinoculation) that may lead to different tumor growth
kinetics. Thus, with the exception of long-term tumor size decline,
our results in mouse xenografts show a higher response to treatment
in HCT116 than in Hke3 cells, closely matching zebrafish xenografts.
Differential Sensitivity to Cetuximab and Regorafenib in CRC Tumors
in Zebrafish Xenografts. Our results suggest that Hke3 KRASWT
tumors were refractory to FOLFOX and FOLFIRI standard
chemotherapy. CRC guidelines further recommend that KRASWT
patients should be treated with a combination of chemother-
apy and Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody anti-epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) (19, 26). KRASWT status is an established
biomarker for Cetuximab treatment (19, 26). Consequently, pa-
tients with metastatic CRC who present a mutated KRAS profile
(KRASMUT), such as in HCT116, are generally excluded from
Cetuximab treatment (19).
To test whether Cetuximab therapy could induce cell death
and reduce tumor mass in Hke3 tumors, we treated Hke3 KRASWT
and HCT116 KRASMUT xenografts (as a negative control) with
Cetuximab, with FOLFIRI, and with a combination of FOLFIRI
and Cetuximab. Surprisingly, Cetuximab alone could significantly

CRC xenografts show different sensitivities to standard chemotherapy. Human CRC zebrafish xenografts were treated in vivo with FOLFOX (F–J)
and FOLFIRI (K–O) compared with nontreated controls (A–E). Zebrafish were killed and fixed at 4 dpi, 3 days posttreatment (3 dpT). Mitotic index (P) (DAPI
in blue) and cell death by apoptosis (Q) (activated caspase3 in green) were analyzed and quantified. Average tumor size (number of DAPI cells), nor-
malized to respective controls, was also quantified to compare between different xenografts in different conditions (R). All pictures are at the same
magnification (A–O). Results in P–R are expressed as AVG ± SEM. Results are averages from at least three independent experiments, and the total number
of xenografts analyzed is indicated in the images; ns, nonsignificant; P values are indicated in the text, ***P < 0.001. HCT116 and Hke3 polyclonal xe-
nografts (1:1) were generated and randomly treated with FOLFIRI (T) and compared with untreated controls (S). Xenografts were fixed at 4 dpi, 3 dpT.
The percentages of each clone (U), cell death by apoptosis (V) (activated caspase3), mitotic index (W), and the size of each clone per xenograft (X), were
analyzed and quantified. Each dot represents a xenograft, Hke3_caspase3 **P = 0.041, Hke3_mitosis **P = 0.006, remaining P values are indicated in the

 induce apoptosis in both Hke3 and HCT116 tumors (Fig. 5 B, F,
and J). Combination of Cetuximab and FOLFIRI resulted in in-
creased sensitivity of individual treatments in HCT116 tumors
(Fig. 5 D, H, and J). This synergistic effect was also observed in
the reduction of mitotic figures, but not in the reduction of tumor
size (Fig. 5 I and K).
We were surprised to observe the effect of Cetuximab in
HCT116 (Fig. 5 I–K), given the status of KRASMUT. However, it was
recently reported that a proportion of patients with KRASG13D
mutations, but not with KRASG12V mutations, benefit from
treatment with Cetuximab (27). Thus, to further test the sensi-
tivity of our in vivo assay, we treated SW620 KRASG12V tumors
with Cetuximab (Fig. S3 E–G). In contrast to HCT116 KRASG13D,
but as expected for KRASG12V tumors, no significant effect was
observed with Cetuximab treatment in SW620 KRASG12V tumors
(Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that the zebrafish xenograft
assay has a remarkable resolution to detect sensitivity to Cetuximab
treatment, even in KRASG13D tumors.
Although Cetuximab treatment of Hke3 KRASWT tumors in-
duced apoptosis, this was not accompanied by a significant re-
duction of tumor mass (Fig. 5 J and K), suggesting that Cetuximab
is not very effective in Hke3 cells.
Regorafenib is a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor recom-
mended in refractory metastatic CRC, usually used as a last al-
ternative in the guidelines (19, 28). Regorafenib has been shown
not only to induce apoptosis (28) but also to have antiangiogenic
activity (29). Thus, to test whether regorafenib could be more
effective for Hke3 refractory and less proliferative tumors, xe-
nografts were treated with regorafenib for three consecutive
days. Although we could not observe changes in the mitotic
index of Hke3 (Fig. S4G), regorafenib was able to induce ap-
optosis in Hke3 cells (P < 0.0001) accompanied by a significant
reduction of tumor size (Fig. S4 A, B, H, and I, P = 0.0041).
These results highlight the possibility of detecting response to
therapy even in low proliferative and refractory tumors.
In addition, since regorafenib is also considered antiangiogenic,
we also examined this effect in HT29 xenografts (which we pre-
viously showed were highly angiogenic). We detected a reduction
on the total vessel density in HT29 tumors (Fig. S4 J, C′, and D′,
P < 0.0001) but not in Hke3 or SW620 (Fig. S4 J, A′, B′, E′,
and F′). Regorafenib also induces apoptosis in HT29 tumors;
however, this induction is not accompanied by a reduction of
tumor mass as in Hke3 (Figs. S4H, P = 0.0083, and I). These
results suggest that regorafenib is efficient as a third line of
treatment for Hke3 refractory tumors and that regorafenib is
also able to block tumor-derived neovascularization in highly
angiogenic tumors.
Overall, we show that it is possible to perform an in vivo
screening of the main current options of the international CRC
treatment guidelines from first to third line, by using the
zebrafish larvae xenograft model.
Zebrafish PDX Can Be Efficiently Established Using Human CRC
Primary Samples. Next, to test whether zebrafish larvae can be
efficiently used to generate zebrafish PDX (zPDX), we injected
cell suspensions derived from surgically resected human colon
tumors into zebrafish. We developed a protocol based on pro-
cedures for human CRC organoids derivation to maintain
stemness and cell viability during processing (30, 31) (SI Materials
and Methods and Table S4).
Selected primary tumors corresponded to adenocarcinomas of
diverse tumor stages (Table S3). We selected 24-hpi zPDX for
the presence of a DiI stained mass in the PVS and left them to
develop for three more days. At 4 dpi, percentage of implanta-
tion was scored as previously (Fig. 6F). We observed implanta-
tion rates ranging from 47% (zPDX#3) to 89% (zPDX#4) (Fig.
6 A–F). For large primary tumor samples (zPDX#2, zPDX#4
and zPDX#5), injections were repeated and gave rise to similar
engraftment rates (Fig. 6F), demonstrating the reproducibility of
the procedure.
The zPDX were processed for whole-mount immunofluo-
rescence to assess angiogenesis (Fig. 6 A′–E′), tumor size (Fig.
6G), mitotic figures (Fig. 6H), expression of CRC markers
(carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA), and human-associated antigens

 (MHC class I HLA and human mitochondria) (Fig. 6 I–L).
Confocal microscopy analysis allowed us to observe differential
vessel recruitment (Fig. 6 A′–E′) and tumor masses with high
cytomorphologic and architectural diversity (Fig. 6 A′′–E′′). In-
terestingly, even tumors with low cellularity induced vessel re-
cruitment (Fig. 6 C′ and G). Mitotic figures were present at 4 dpi
in all zPDX analyzed, albeit sparse and with low mitotic index
(Fig. 6 A′′′–E′′′ and H). We observed tubular structures with
luminal CEA staining (Fig. 6 K and L), as well as human HLA (to
variable levels) and human mitochondria stained cells (Fig. 6 I
and J). We also compared directly the zPDX histology with the
parental primary tumors with hematoxilin and eosin (H&E) (Fig.
S5). The zPDX derived from these tumors generally conserved
their original features. They formed multilocular mucin lakes (Fig.
S5 A′′, B′′, and C′′, black dashed lines delineate mucin lakes, and
red arrow heads denote mucin), circumscribed by epithelium
arranged as acinar structures with strips of cells or single cells (Fig.
S5 A′′, A′′′, and C′′, red dashed lines). Periodic acid−Schiff plus
diastase (PAS+D) staining was used to identify mucus in the lumen
of these structures (Fig. S6). Glandular structures accumulating
necrotic debris in the lumen were also frequently seen (Fig. S5 A′′
and B′′, black arrow heads), and were often CEA positive (Fig. 6 K
and L).
Comparison of zPDX Drug Treatment with Short-Term Patient
Treatment Responses. To test our model as a platform to study
response to treatment, we used available surgically resected CRC
samples derived from patients who were subjected to FOLFOX
adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce risk of disease relapse. At the
time of initial diagnosis, almost two thirds of patients with CRC
undergo resection with curative intent. However, 30 to 50% of
these patients relapse and die of their disease. The majority of
these recurrences occur during the first 2 y after surgery, and
most follow-up programs end 5 y after the primary treatment (32).
FOLFOX postoperative adjuvant treatment has been shown to
reduce chances of relapse, improving disease-free survival (33).

 Although not the ideal setting to study predictability, we
sought to test whether response to FOLFOX treatment in zPDX
would anticipate a delay in relapse in the matching patients, or
whether resistance to drug treatment in our model would asso-
ciate with tumor relapse.
We generated zPDX from five different tumors and treated
them with FOLFOX over 3 days. Of the five zPDX, we could only
observe response to FOLFOX treatment (induction of activated
caspase3) in two zPDX (Fig. 7A and Fig. S7). These zPDX cor-
respond to patients in whom, 6 mo after surgery, the levels of CEA
remain stable, with no indication of relapse. In contrast, of the
three zPDX in which we could not detect response to FOLFOX
treatment, two are already in relapse after 3 mo, with increasing
levels of CEA and clinical evidence of recurrence (Fig. 7 A and B
and Fig. S7). Thus, we could anticipate relapse/no relapse within
3 mo to 6 m after surgery in four out of five patients.
Our previous results on the sensitivity to Cetuximab treatment
in detecting responses in tumors with KRASG13D mutations
prompted us to test whether response to Cetuximab in zPDX
would correlate with genomic prediction of response to the
EGFR blocking therapy. As a proof of concept, to test this as-
sumption, we treated three zPDX with a combination of FOLFIRI
with Cetuximab and with FOLFIRI alone. In the three zPDX
generated, we could observe no added effect of Cetuximab in
combination with FOLFIRI, suggesting that the three tumors
tested showed resistance to Cetuximab (Fig. 7D and Fig. S7 F–H′
′). We later sequenced the corresponding tumors and observed
that all of them harbored mutations on either KRAS or BRAF
(Fig. 7E). All these mutations highly correlated to resistance to
Cetuximab (34). Thus, our results corroborated the genomic pre-
diction (Fig. 7F).
Even though we have not yet gathered sufficient patient
numbers to reach statistical significance, we performed proof-of-
concept experiments to set the groundwork for a future clinical
study to test the predictiveness of zPDX in the more suitable
neoadjuvant setting.
Discussion
Recent genome cancer profile studies exposed unanticipated tu-
mor heterogeneity. This heterogeneity has been observed not only
between cancers (intertumor) but also within each cancer (intra-
tumor) (35, 36). Even identical CRC clones that share the same
genome exhibit multiple functional profiles (including distinct
responses to therapies) (37), implying that the basis for hetero-
geneity is not only genetic. Most approved drugs lack known bio-
markers, and, even in biomarker-driven therapies, response rates
are not foolproof (36, 38). Thus, in the current scenario, we are
currently unable to securely forecast which patient is likely to re-
spond to a given therapy program.
Chemosensitivity tests are not a novel idea. However, the ac-
curacy of in vitro tests has not been robust enough to support its
use in oncology practice (39). Recently, Letai and colleagues
(40) showed a promising in vitro assay that bypasses serial pas-
sages and directly challenges tumor cells with therapeutic drugs,
using BH3 profiling as a proxy of cell death. In this assay, there is
a direct measurement of mitochondrial stress upon the applied
drug (40, 41). In addition, in vitro organoids constitute a major
technological breakthrough for the study of tumor biology, drug
discovery, and, possibly, personalized medicine (42).
Although promising, in vitro tests will always lack the com-
plexity of interactions of tumor cells with their microenviron-
ment in the in vivo setting. The current gold standard for in vivo
assessment of tumor heterogeneity and response to therapy is
mouse PDX (1). However, mouse PDX are not practical for
clinical advice due to the time it takes to implant tumors and
expand colonies, and the costs they entail. Here, we have taken
an intermediate approach—a fast in vivo assay with unprece-
dented cellular resolution—the zebrafish larvae xenograft model.
We set out to test whether the zebrafish larvae xenografts have
enough resolution to uncover functional cancer heterogeneity
to screen in vivo international treatment guidelines. Our study
shows that zebrafish xenografts are capable of discriminating, with
single-cell resolution, distinct proliferation dynamics and differ-
ential metastatic potentials, not only between tumors derived from
different patients but also between isogenic pairs.
Our ultimate goal was to screen the major therapeutic options
present in the international guidelines for advanced CRC (19)
using the zebrafish xenograft assay. We analyzed the response of
five zebrafish xenografts (cell line-derived) to the two most
common and equivalent chemotherapy options FOLFOX and
FOLFIRI (21) and observed an overall higher sensitivity to
FOLFIRI than to FOLFOX. This is in agreement with the study
by Sadanandam et al. (11) that found that 70% of stem-like
subtype tumors were associated with a clinical benefit with
FOLFIRI treatment. Remarkably, we could also observe a
clear differential response to therapy between isogenic tumors,
illustrating differential therapy responses between primary and
metastatic tumors (SW480/SW620) and subclonal tumor pop-
ulations (HCT116/Hke3). We also reproduced polyclonal tumor
scenarios and show differential responses to chemotherapy in the
same xenograft and how therapy can select for minor resistant
clones.
Following the next recommended therapy in the guidelines,
we tested for Cetuximab sensitivity. Cetuximab treatment is a
biomarker-driven therapy, recommended specifically for KRASWT
tumors. Although not effective in all patients with KRASWT tumors
(only ∼12.8%), the probability of response to Cetuximab treatment
is still significantly higher (26). To our surprise, Cetuximab was
effective on HCT116 KRASG13D. Consistent with our results, recent

The zPDX treatment response may predict relapse and correlate
with known genomic biomarkers of Cetuximab resistance. Five zPDX, cor-

 clinical reports revealed that a significant portion of patients with
KRASG13D mutations, but not KRASG12V, benefit from Cetuximab
treatment (27). Thus, our results suggest that zebrafish xenografts
can measure responsiveness to therapy of tumors with different
KRAS point mutations. Our study also illustrates the relevance
of functional assays even in biomarker-driven therapies to fur-
ther select the patients that may benefit from specific therapies,
specifically in ones that do not have 100% efficacy and are ex-
pensive or toxic.
Although Hke3 KRASWT tumors responded to Cetuximab treat-
ment, this was not accompanied by a reduction of tumor size. Thus,
we tested the third-line option for refractory metastatic CRC—
regorafenib. In contrast to previous treatments, Hke3 tumors now
responded to therapy with an induction of apoptosis accompanied
by reduction of tumor size. Our results illustrate the possibility of
screening treatment guidelines from first to third line.
We also validated our results obtained in zebrafish in mouse
xenografts. This study directly compares zebrafish and mouse
xenograft chemosensitivity. As in zebrafish, HCT116 responded
to both treatments, but FOLFIRI produced a significantly higher
induction of apoptosis than FOLFOX, and Hke3 seemed refractory
to both treatments. Our results suggest that using apoptosis and
reduction of mitotic index as a surrogate as a response to treatment
in zebrafish xenografts (4 days from injection to analysis) can be
used as a proxy of the response to treatment in mouse xenografts
(minimal 1 mo since injection to analysis). The disparity in time
between models is likely to reflect the difference in scale of the
models (>10,000 fold). On one hand, zebrafish larvae allow for
visualization of single cells and their response to treatment in multi-
ple xenografts, improving statistical power. In contrast, mouse PDX
generally rely on large palpable tumors, long treatments to visualize
responses, and multiple rounds of expansion to provide statistical
power. On the other hand, this longer assay permits the study of
tumor evolution, emergence of resistance clones, and overall progres-
sion of disease (1, 37). Thus, we envisage that zebrafish and mouse
xenograft models may complement each other: zebrafish as a fast
screening platform, and mouse xenografts to accompany tumor
evolution and relapse.
Lastly, we also demonstrate the feasibility of using primary
patient samples to generate zPDX with similar implantation
rates as tumor cell lines. We show that zPDX can form tumor
masses, induce vascularization, and present multilocular mucin
lakes, glandular structures, and CEA expression. As observed
with cell lines (SW480), patient samples (e.g., zPDX#3) also
vary in their engraftment efficiency (being as low as <50%). To
overcome possible low implantation rates, we may increase the
number of injected fish and use immune-compromised strains (43,
44) to dampen the possibility of rejection. As a proof of concept
experiments, we also treated zPDX with FOLFOX and were able
to anticipate relapse/no relapse within 3 m to 6 m after surgery in
four out of five patients. In addition, we sequenced tumors whose
matching zPDX did not respond to Cetuximab, and found that all
harbored mutations highly linked to Cetuximab resistance, cor-
roborating our zPDX results with genomic data.
In summary, we performed proof-of-concept experiments that
show that it is possible to screen the available therapeutic options
present in the international CRC guidelines by using zebrafish
xenografts. We show that zebrafish larvae xenografts constitute a
rapid model with high sensitivity to unravel human tumor func-
tional heterogeneity. We also performed proof-of-concept exper-
iments using patient samples to set the groundwork for a clinical
study to test the predictiveness of zPDX as a rapid in vivo screen-
ing platform for personalized cancer treatments.
Materials and Methods
Animal Care and Handling. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) casper, nacre, and Tg(fli1:eGFP)
fish were handled according to European animal welfare regulations and stan-
dard protocols.
Human Tissue. All samples used for zPDX establishment were obtained from
Champalimaud Hospital or Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca Hospital with
written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees
of both hospitals.
Cell Lines and Culture. Colon cancer cell lines, SW480, SW620, and HT29,
originally from American Type Culture Collection, were authenticated
through short tandem repeat profiling karyotyping isoenzyme analysis.
HCT116 and Hke3 isogenic cell lines were donated by Angela Relógio and
analyzed. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma. All cells were cultured
in DMEM (Biowest) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom) and 1%
Penicillin−Streptomycin (HyClone) in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Zebrafish Xenografts Injection. Dil-labeled cells were injected into the PVS of
anesthetized 48-hpf larvae (8). After injection, xenografts were transferred
to 34 °C until the end of experiments.
Zebrafish Xenograft Drug Administration. The 24-hpi zebrafish xenografts
with the same tumor size were randomly distributed in the treatment groups:
control E3 medium, FOLFIRI in E3, and FOLFOX in E3 (4.2 mM 5-FU, 0.18 mM
folinic acid, 0.08 mM irinotecan, 0.08 mM oxaliplatin) for three consecutive
days. Using, as a reference, the maximum patient’s plasma concentration
of each compound (Table S2), we determined the zebrafish maximum toler-
ated concentration. Cetuximab monoclonal antibody was added to the cell
suspension (20 μg/ml) at the time of injection and then to E3 medium at
100 μg/ml. Regorafenib was added to E3 to a final concentration of 40 mM.
