CDK4/6 inhibition substantially improves progression-free survival (PFS) for women with
advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, although there are no predictive bio-
markers. Early changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) level may provide early response
prediction, but the impact of tumor heterogeneity is unknown. Here we use plasma samples
from patients in the randomized phase III PALOMA-3 study of CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib
and fulvestrant for women with advanced breast cancer and show that relative change in
PIK3CA ctDNA level after 15 days treatment strongly predicts PFS on palbociclib and ful-
vestrant (hazard ratio 3.94, log-rank p = 0.0013). ESR1 mutations selected by prior hormone
therapy are shown to be frequently sub clonal, with ESR1 ctDNA dynamics offering limited
prediction of clinical outcome. These results suggest that early ctDNA dynamics may provide
a robust biomarker for CDK4/6 inhibitors, with early ctDNA dynamics demonstrating
divergent response of tumor sub clones to treatment.

irculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with cancer by iden-
tifying genomic aberrations. The levels of ctDNA fluctuate
with treatment during cancer therapy, broadly correlating with
disease response and relapse across a wide range of cancers and
treatments and offering the potential for non-invasive monitoring
of disease status in both the metastatic and early settings1–5.
Circulating tumor DNA is a surrogate for tumor biopsy in
assessment of driver mutations such as EGFR in lung cancer6 and
allows assessment of clonal evolution over time in patients with
multiple metastases7. There are now early data that suggest that
ctDNA dynamics in the early stages of treatment could be used to
predict treatment outcome before tumor response can be assessed
through the conventional means of size on imaging or a change in
clinical symptoms or signs. Early ctDNA dynamics predict out-
come on chemotherapy for colon cancer8, 9.
These studies have shown that early ctDNA dynamics could
potentially allow a real-time, individualized assessment of a
treatment’s efficacy, allowing treatment adaptation with either an
early switch away from an ineffective therapy or addition of
further therapy in a group identified early as being resistant to
therapy. However there are no data from large, homogenously
treated phase III trials10–13, that allow a robust determination of
clinical validity for ctDNA dynamics in assessing response to
targeted therapies.
The potential for ctDNA dynamics to predict long-term out-
come is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that a
fall in measured ctDNA corresponds to a functional effect of
treatment on the cancer, and that short-term effects of treatment
will predict long-term clinical outcome. The exact mechanisms by
which ctDNA enters the circulation are incompletely under-
stood14, but are likely in part a function of tumor cell death and
turn-over given the observed association between ctDNA and
tumor volume15, 16. Specific treatment effects on these processes
may be important in relating early ctDNA dynamics to clinical
outcome.
The second assumption is that an early measurement of
ctDNA can provide an adequate surrogate of the overall, aggre-
gate response of a patient’s cancer to treatment. Intra-tumoral
genetic heterogeneity presents a challenge to targeted therapy
response, as sub clones may have divergent response to therapy.
An example of this phenomenon is the occurrence of mutations
in the estrogen receptor gene, ESR1, in breast cancer that result in
constitutive activation of the estrogen receptor17,
18. ESR1
mutations evolve in response to prior aromatase inhibitor therapy
for advanced breast cancer in as many as a third of patients17, 19–
22. Prior data has suggested that ESR1 mutations may frequently
be sub clonal in the resistant cancer23, yet the extent to which this
sub clonality effects response to therapy is unknown. The selec-
tive estrogen degrader fulvestrant has activity in vitro against
cancers with ESR1 mutations, although higher concentrations are
required to inhibit mutant ER than wild-type ER and it is
unknown if the clinical schedules of fulvestrant achieve the doses
required to degrade mutant ER17.
We undertook an analysis of the PALOMA-3 trial to assess the
utility of early ctDNA dynamics in predicting outcome on CDK4/
6 inhibitors, and to investigate the implications of tumor het-
erogeneity. CDK4/6 inhibitors have substantial efficacy in the
treatment of advanced estrogen (ER) receptor-positive HER2-
negative breast cancer, the most common subtype of breast
cancer. Palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, increases progression-
free survival when added to the endocrine therapies letrozole24
and fulvestrant25, and ribociclib increases progression-free sur-
vival when added to letrozole26. The PALOMA-3 trial compared
palbociclib plus fulvestrant with fulvestrant plus placebo in a 2:1
ratio in advanced breast cancer that had previously progressed on
endocrine
treatment,
demonstrating
an
improvement
in
progression-free survival from 4.6 months to 9.5 months with the
addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant25. However, studies have
been unable to identify which ER-positive breast cancers benefit
from CDK4/6 inhibition27, and there is a pressing need to identify
biomarker approaches to identify which patients derive long-term
benefit.
Here we show that early ctDNA dynamics in the commonly
truncal mutations in PIK3CA predict sensitivity to palbociclib. In
contrast we show that ESR1 mutations are commonly sub clonal
and weak predictors of outcome, with early ctDNA dynamics
anticipating clonal selection of ESR1 mutations by therapy.
Results
Early plasma dynamics of PIK3CA mutations. Sequential
plasma samples were collected at baseline, cycle 1 day 15, and at
progression in the PALOMA-3 study to assess whether early
dynamic changes in ctDNA could predict progression-free sur-
vival (PFS) on palbociclib. Of the 521 patients recruited to the
study, 459 baseline samples were available for DNA extraction of
which 455 were analyzed with multiplex digital PCR assays for
hotspot mutations in exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA (E542K, E545K,
H1047R and H1047L) (Fig. 1a). This analysis identified 100 cases
(22.0%) with a PIK3CA mutation (Supplementary Fig. 1), a
similar proportion to that seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas for
these mutations in primary disease (22.1%)28, 29, PIK3CA muta-
tions being predominantly truncal events in breast cancer30–34.
Four cases in the PALOMA-3 set demonstrated two PIK3CA
mutations (4%), all of which featured an E545K clone, demon-
strating a sub clonal element of PIK3CA mutation (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2). Similarly, in TCGA data only 0.7% (1/152) of ER
+/HER2- PIK3CA mutant patients had double mutations detec-
ted among these PIK3CA mutations35.
Matched day 15 samples were available for 73 patients (Fig. 1a).
There was a statistically significant decline in copies/ml for both
mutant (median relative change 0.076, p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) and wild-type alleles (median relative change
0.542, p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) of PIK3CA (Fig. 1b).
Wild-type allele change reflected changes in total cell-free DNA,
with a substantially more marked fall for mutant PIK3CA as a
marker of ctDNA (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Fig. 1b,
see also Supplementary Fig. 3).
We defined the “circulating DNA ratio” (CDR) as the ratio of
mutation abundance (mutant copies/ml) on treatment relative to
baseline, CDR15 denoting the ratio of cycle 1 day 15 to baseline.
Patients randomized to palbociclib plus fulvestrant had a lower
PIK3CA CDR15 compared to fulvestrant plus placebo (p < 0.0001,
Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 1c) indicating larger reduction in
ctDNA abundance. All patients on palbociclib (52/73) had a
CDR15 < 1, indicating a fall in circulating tumor DNA. These data
demonstrate that the anti-proliferative effects of palbociclib result
in a rapid fall in ctDNA levels by day 15, and that PIK3CA CDR15
assessment anticipated the improved PFS seen with palbociclib in
the PALOMA-3 trial25. Reduction of wild-type copies was
predominantly in the palbociclib treatment group (median

 ESR1 (E380Q, S463P, L536R, Y537S, Y537C, Y537N, and D538G)
using multiplex droplet digital PCR assays. Baseline ESR1
mutations were identified in 114 (25.6%) patients (Fig. 2a), 33
(28.9%) of these were polyclonal, the majority of polyclonal
samples featuring a D538G mutation (29/33) (Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Of the 114 ESR1 mutant
baseline samples, matched day 15 was available in 65 patients
(Fig. 2a). As with PIK3CA, both the aggregate ESR1 mutant
copies (median relative change 0.022, p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) and wild-type allele (median relative change
0.21, p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were significantly
lower at day 15 (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 7) and significantly
lower with palbociclib (Fig. 2c; p = 0.034, Mann–Whitney test).
However, in the fulvestrant and placebo group, patients with
ESR1 mutations had substantially greater suppression of mutant
ESR1 ctDNA than patients with PIK3CA mutations (median
CDR15 ESR1 0.044 vs PIK3CA 0.82, p < 0.0001, Mann–Whitney
test; Fig. 2d), suggestive of a differential response. There was also
a non-significant trend towards greater suppression on palboci-
clib and fulvestrant (median CDR15 ESR1 0.014 vs PIK3CA 0.034,
p = 0.0532, Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 2e).
Early PIK3CA dynamics predict outcome on palbociclib. We
next investigated whether CDR15 assessment could predict long-
term outcome for patients treated with palbociclib, relating
PIK3CA and ESR1 CDR15 to PFS using a Cox proportional
hazards model. Patients with PIK3CA CDR15 above the median
value of 0.034 had inferior PFS compared to those below median
(hazard ratio 3.94, 95% CI 1.61–9.64, log-rank p = 0.0013;
Fig. 3a). In contrast, ESR1 CDR15 using the median failed to
identify a significant relationship with PFS (Fig. 3b). A single cut-
point for predicting PFS on palbociclib and fulvestrant using the
PIK3CA CDR15 was optimized using Harrell’s c-index, with
p values corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to
adjust for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 8). Using
this cut-point (Fig. 3b), patients with a high CDR15 had a median
PFS of 4.1 months (95% CI 3.6–5.5) and patients with a low,
suppressed, CDR15 had a median PFS of 11.2 months (95% CI
11.1–undefined), hazard ratio 4.92 (95% CI 1.98–12.26, log-rank
test p = 0.0002, q = 0.007). It was not possible to optimize a
statistically significant single cut-point in ESR1 CDR15 with
Harrell’s
c-index
(Supplementary
Fig.
9)
with
a
Benjamini–Hochberg correction (Fig. 3d; q = 0.15). Therefore,
PIK3CA ctDNA dynamics after two weeks of palbociclib and
fulvestrant predicted long-term clinical outcome on palbociclib,
while ESR1 ctDNA dynamics were less predictive.
Baseline ctDNA burden has been linked to prognosis in some
prior studies9. The baseline level of PIK3CA ctDNA did not
predict PFS on palbociclib and fulvestrant (above vs below
median HR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.606–2.43, log-rank p = 0.582), and
there was no correlation between baseline mutant copies/ml and
CDR15, (Supplementary Fig. 10. PIK3CA CDR15 remained
significant in a multivariable analysis of prognostic clinical and
pathological features on palbociclib (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Analysis of PIK3CA and ESR1 CDR15 in patients on fulvestrant
and placebo was performed but was limited by low patient
numbers (HR = 2.54, 95% CI 0.89–7.25, log-rank p = 0.07

 ESR1 mutant sub clones do not reflect outcome on fulvestrant.
The early ctDNA dynamics data suggested that ESR1 mutant
clones demonstrated greater suppression of CDR15 on fulvestrant,
potentially providing evidence that fulvestrant has potency
against ESR1 mutant tumors in the clinic36. However, this is at
odds with prior data that suggests that baseline ESR1 mutations
did not predict for improved PFS on fulvestrant21. We analyzed
the effect of baseline ESR1 mutation detection on outcome on
fulvestrant and placebo in an updated analysis of 151 patients21.
Patients with baseline ESR1 mutation detected had a statistically
significantly worse PFS compared to patients with baseline wild-
type ESR1 (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02–2.43, log-rank p = 0.04;
Fig. 4a). We subsequently investigated possible explanations for
this disconnect between the acute effects of fulvestrant on ESR1
CDR15 and the lack of long-term benefit assessed by PFS by
examining the clonal status of ESR1 mutations in this cohort.
Of the patients with ESR1 mutation at baseline, 35 also had a
PIK3CA mutation enabling clonal comparison within each
patient (Fig. 4b). Confidently determining whether a mutant
population is truncal is challenging in plasma due to great
variability in tumor purity and variation in the copy number
status of alleles. Nevertheless, the summed allele fraction of ESR1
mutations was lower than PIK3CA allele fraction in 77.1%
patients with both mutations (Fig. 4c), suggesting the ESR1
mutations were predominantly sub clonal, although this analysis
is limited by an incomplete analysis of the ESR1 gene. In the 25
patients with assessable CDR15 and dual PIK3CA and ESR1
mutations, the association in CDR15 was linear between two
mutations in the majority of samples, whereas solely the ESR1
mutant clone became undetectable in 32% (8/25) suggestive of
contrasting clonal dynamics of a sub clonal ESR1 mutation
(Fig. 4d). Although the ESR1 mutant clone becoming undetect-
able could in part be due to difference in level of detection
between PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations (Supplementary Figs. 14
and 15), ESR1 became undetectable at a higher rate than would be
expected by random sampling taking into account difference in

 level of detection (Supplementary Table 1). Baseline mutant
copies/ml was not associated with being undetectable at day 15
for ESR1 (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Taken together, these data are consistent with ESR1 mutation
representing a sub clone in a substantial fraction of patients with
advanced breast cancer, poorly representing the cancer overall.
This sub clone may show greater initial sensitivity to fulvestrant
combinations, evident in the early ctDNA dynamics, while other
sub clones may respond differently such that response of the
ESR1 mutant clone may not eventually determine clinical
outcome.
Early sub clonal dynamics predict clonal detection on relapse.
Our data suggested that evolved ESR1 mutations are frequently
sub clonal, and that these sub clones may show initial increased
sensitivity to fulvestrant, and to palbociclib, as assessed by CDR15.
We next assessed whether early clonal dynamics in ctDNA could
predict the clonal composition at relapse. Of the 113 samples
assessed for CDR15, with either a PIK3CA or ESR1 mutation or
both, 59 (52.2%) had an end of treatment plasma sample (Fig. 5a).
All except one of the cases positive for a PIK3CA mutation at
baseline had the same mutation detectable at the end of treatment
(1/37 undetectable, 2.7%), consistent with the probable truncal
nature of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer (Fig. 5b). In con-
trast, 8 of 31 patients (25.8%) with ESR1 mutation at baseline had
undetectable ESR1 mutation at the end of treatment, significantly
more than PIK3CA mutations (Fig. 5b; p = 0.005, two sample test
of proportions). We then investigated whether early clonal
dynamics anticipated loss of the ESR1 clone at subsequent
relapse. Five of the nine (55.6%) ESR1 mutant subjects with
undetectable ctDNA at day 15 had no detectable ESR1 at end of
treatment (Fig. 5c, d; p = 0.027, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting
early clonal dynamics predicted for clonal composition at pro-
gression. Four of the right cases with undetectable ESR1 mutation
at progression were also PIK3CA mutated at baseline and all of
these had PIK3CA mutation detected at the end of treatment,
indicating the observed loss of ESR1 mutation was not an artifact
of low tumor content. There was no evidence from the six cases
with polyclonal ESR1 mutations at baseline of favorable selection
of one ESR1 mutation over another (Supplementary Fig. 17).

 Clearance of ESR1 mutation at end of treatment was more fre-
quent in patients on palbociclib and fulvestrant than those on
fulvestrant and placebo (35.6% 7/20 v 9.1% 1/11, respectively)
though this was not a statistically significant result (p = 0.2,
Fisher’s exact test).
Discussion
In this analysis evaluating the predictive role of longitudinal
ctDNA assessment in the PALOMA-3 study, we show that early
circulating tumor DNA dynamics with truncal PIK3CA muta-
tions predict sensitivity to palbociclib in advanced hormone
receptor-positive breast cancer. The early dynamics of ESR1
mutations, commonly sub clonal, did not predict sensitivity, or at
best did not predict as strongly as the dynamics of PIK3CA
mutations. Evolved ESR1 mutant clones show an initial marked
decrease in abundance to both the combination of palbociclib and
fulvestrant and fulvestrant alone as assessed by early circulating
tumor DNA dynamics, but this does not associate with long-term
improvement in PFS on fulvestrant alone relative to patients with
wild-type ESR1. ESR1 mutations were more frequently unde-
tectable at the end of treatment than PIK3CA mutations, and
early clonal selection of ESR1 mutations can be detected after

 15 days treatment, anticipating clonal architecture at progression.
In combination these observations present a potential strategy to
address the impact of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity through
early assessment of ctDNA from truncal and sub clonal muta-
tions, giving an earlier indication of outcome and rapidly iden-
tifying sub clones that will not dictate long-term outcome. These
data also highlight the importance of understanding the clonal
status and functional significance of genetic alterations in ctDNA
when extrapolating between early ctDNA dynamics and clinical
end points.
Prior research has been unable to identify tumor-based bio-
markers of sensitivity to palbociclib in ER-positive breast cancer.
Neither PIK3CA nor ESR1 mutant status at baseline were found
to predict outcome on palbociclib and fulvestrant in previous
analyses of the PALOMA-3 trial21, 25. Amplification of CCND1,
the gene-encoding cyclin D1, and loss of p16 were assessed
prospectively in the PALOMA-1/TRIO-18 trial of palbociclib and
letrozole in first-line advanced, hormone receptor-positive breast
cancer, but neither criterion identified a subgroup of better
responders37. Functional retinoblastoma protein (Rb, encoded by
the RB1 gene) is a requirement for response to CDK4/6 inhibition
in vitro, but this has not been demonstrated in the clinic, possibly
in part as RB1 aberrations are rare in ER-positive breast cancer38.
Early on-treatment assessment of ctDNA dynamics represents the
first biomarker for predicting response to palbociclib (Fig. 3). Our
results here demonstrate that early suppression of ctDNA pre-
dicts long-term outcome substantially earlier than changes in
tumor size, when truncal mutations such as PIK3CA are tracked
in plasma, in the setting of palbociclib with fulvestrant in
advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
Our data demonstrates that early ctDNA changes may be
predictive for cytostatic therapies such as palbociclib. Cancer cells
predominantly undergo apoptosis as a result of a failure to
transition the S and M phases of the cell cycle. Our data suggest

 cancers with incomplete cell cycle arrest on palbociclib continue
to proliferate on treatment, undergoing apoptosis and/or necrosis
with ongoing release of tumor DNA in the circulation. In con-
trast, cancers with more complete G0/G1 cell cycle arrest to
palbociclib no longer undergo cell death and have more fully
suppressed ctDNA. Ensuring complete cell cycle arrest by CDK4/
6 inhibitor combinations is therefore shown to be key to main-
taining long-term disease control by therapy.
As PIK3CA mutation detection at baseline is not a predictive
biomarker for palbociclib and fulvestrant, in this analysis it likely
represents a functionally agnostic means of assessing the presence
of DNA released by the patients’ cancer cells, its truncal status
meaning it is found in all cancer cells within the patient. Our data
illustrate the importance of assessing clonality in using early
ctDNA dynamics to predict response to targeted therapies in
cancer. ESR1 mutant clones evolve in ER-positive advanced breast
cancer during aromatase inhibitor treatment, with ESR1 muta-
tions resulting in constitutively active ER17, 19–21. We show that
ESR1 mutations are frequently sub clonal, (Fig. 4c, d) with high
levels of polyclonality (Supplementary Fig. 6). ESR1 mutation sub
clonality means they are poorly representative of a patient’s
cancer overall, limiting the potential for their ctDNA dynamics to
predict clinical outcome (Fig. 3b, d; Supplementary Fig. 9). Fur-
thermore, though ESR1 mutant clones may be acutely sensitive to
fulvestrant or the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant
(Fig. 2d), this does not translate into improved PFS for patients
with ESR1 mutant cancers (Fig. 4a). In contrast to this we show
that patients with ESR1 mutations in their cancers have worse
outcome on fulvestrant alone. This discrepancy could potentially
be explained by cancers with ESR1 mutations detected in plasma
being genetically diverse and more likely to feature other resistant
sub clones not assessed here, highlighting the potential impor-
tance of understanding heterogeneity with non-invasive assays.
Previous studies of early ctDNA dynamics within the first 2 weeks
of treatment have not assessed sub clonality or explored func-
tionally distinct clones, using either a single gene or hetero-
geneous cohorts receiving a variety of treatments and measuring a
number of different genetic aberrations8, 9. That a colorectal study
in a heterogeneous cohort was able to show some clinically pre-
dictive value for early ctDNA dynamics may be because the
majority of the mutations that were assessed were probably
truncal, having been selected on the basis of prevalence in pri-
mary disease9. Relative early clonal dynamics could offer an
approach to tackle intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity, through
identifying differences in sensitivity to treatment early, and
anticipating changes in clonal composition at progression.
The early ctDNA dynamics of a truncal mutation approach
could be applied to other cancer treatments with no biomarker,
but a number of challenges remain. Palbociclib’s cytostatic effect
may be significant in generalizing this analysis to other treatments
which are not cytostatic. The optimal time point for comparative
assessment is also unknown. Further problems in generalizing
this approach include confident selection of a truncal mutation
and understanding the functional significance of sub clones, as
seen here with the contrasts between PIK3CA and ESR1. Tech-
nically the best method for measuring the tumor content of
plasma for early changes remains uncertain. The advantages of
digital PCR, speed, sensitivity and precision at very low con-
centrations with absolute quantification, could be challenged by
multi-region
sequencing
with
error-correcting
molecular
barcodes15, 39. This would also allow a broader range of truncal
and sub clonal aberrations to be assessed, providing an oppor-
tunity for a richer sub clonal analysis.
These results are exploratory and care must be taken with their
interpretation. Strengths of this analysis include samples and
outcome data being collected within a large phase III randomized
controlled trial of a relatively homogeneous cohort of patients,
with samples collected specifically to analyze the potential of
CDR15 to predict PFS. Heterogeneity of unselected cohorts on a
variety of treatments presents significant challenges for mean-
ingful studies of comparative clonal dynamics. A limitation of our
study is a degree of uncertainty concerning the true truncal or sub
clonal status of the PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations, which we infer
rather than directly assess with multiple region, multiple time
point biopsies. Data from archival primary tissue would be
helpful in supporting the hypothesis that the majority of the
PIK3CA mutations we observe are truncal. Analysis of TCGA
data confirmed that polyclonal PIK3CA mutations are rare in
primary disease, but the landscape of endocrine-resistant disease
is less well described. A small subset of the PIK3CA mutations
observed in the PALOMA-3 analysis may be sub clonal, as is
potentially the case for the patients observed to have an ESR1
mutation at higher allele fraction than their PIK3CA mutation.
Another limitation is the relatively modest amount of plasma we
were able to assess, although this did not substantially affect our
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 14). Importantly, we also lack an
independent clinical dataset to validate the PIK3CA cut-off for
CDR15; this would be required before this criterion could be
tested for use with clinical decision-making.
It is uncertain if these results would apply to other palbociclib
—hormone therapy combinations, and to other CDK4/6 inhibi-
tors. Relatively few patients had end of treatment samples, and
the frequency of loss of ESR1 mutations at end of treatment is
inaccurately estimated. Our analysis is specific to digital PCR
analysis, and separate cut-offs would need to be derived for
alternative ctDNA analysis techniques such as error-corrected
molecular barcode sequencing15, 39. A further consideration is
whether our optimized CDR15 cut-off would be too stringent for
clinical purposes, and whether a higher cut-off should be
employed, defined through deciding on a minimum clinically
acceptable median PFS benefit.
Following validation in an independent clinical cohort, these
data would support trials testing the hypothesis that a change in
treatment strategy based on early ctDNA dynamics may improve
outcome, by switching to another modality or adding additional
treatment for patients with inadequate ctDNA suppression. For
example, patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive
PIK3CA mutant breast cancer with inadequate ctDNA suppres-
sion on palbociclib and fulvestrant could benefit from early
introduction of a PI3-kinase inhibitor. Further clinical trials using
a validated cut-off for circulating DNA response will be required
to test this approach prospectively. It may be further possible to
translate this approach to allow early assessment of other treat-
ments, and individualize assessment of response to therapy.
Conceivably ctDNA response could also be used to screen agents
for signs of efficacy in early phase trials. Future trials examining
the early dynamics of circulating tumor DNA need to consider
the clonal status of the measured aberration, and whether it is
appropriate to group together aberrations that may be sub clonal
and functionally distinct.
Methods
Experimental study design. The PALOMA-3 study was an international, multi-
center, phase III, double-blind randomized controlled trial of palbociclib in women
with advanced, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer25, 40. Post-
menopausal patients were required to have received aromatase inhibitor therapy
previously, with disease relapse during or within 1 month of treatment for meta-
static disease, or during or within 12 months of completing adjuvant treatment.
Pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal women were required to have relapsed during
or within 1 month of endocrine treatment for metastatic disease, or during or
within 12 months of completing adjuvant tamoxifen. Pre-menopausal or peri-
menopausal women also received goserelin. The study enrolled 521 women, ran-
domizing in a 2:1 ratio to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus
placebo. Participants received either 125 mg daily of oral palbociclib for 3 weeks

 followed by a 7 day treatment break or matching placebo. All patients received 500
mg fulvestrant delivered intramuscularly every 2 weeks for three injections, fol-
lowed by every 4 weeks. The ctDNA study reported here was conducted on plasma
samples collected prospectively for ctDNA analysis. The primary aim of this study
was to assess ctDNA mutations and dynamics as a biomarker of progression-free
survival, and to compare the dynamics of PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations. Sample
size was determined by availability of samples from the clinical trial.
Plasma collection and processing. Plasma samples were collected at day 1, day
15, and end of treatment in EDTA blood collection tubes. Samples were processed
within 30 min of collection by centrifugation at 1500–2000 × g for 10 min. Plasma
was then separated and stored at −70 to −80 °C. Prior to DNA extraction plasma
samples were thawed and subjected to further centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min.
DNA extraction. The Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Cat No./ID: 55114) from
Qiagen® (Venlo, The Netherlands) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, plasma was incubated with proteinase K and ACL buffer with
added carrier RNA dissolved in AVE buffer for 30 min at 60 °C before ACB buffer
was added and the sample passed through a QiaAmp Mini Column. After washes
with ACW1, ACW2, and 100% ethanol the column was centrifuged at 20,000 × g
for 3 min, dried, and buffer AVE used for elution. The DNA was stored at −20 °C
until analysis. All subsequent analyses used the first elution.
Droplet digital PCR. DNA concentration was estimated in each sample by
assessment with a TaqMan™ Copy Number Reference Assay (4403326, Thermo
Fisher, Massachusetts,USA) against RPPH1, the gene-encoding RNAseP. Using the
Bio-Rad® AutoDG® automated droplet generator, samples were partitioned into
approximately 20,000 micelles in emulsion and PCR performed. The wells were
analyzed on a Bio-Rad® QX200 instrument for FAM and VIC signal in each
droplet. The Bio-Rad QuantaSoft® software package version 1.4.0.99 was used fit
the proportion of empty droplets to a Poisson distribution to calculate the original
concentration of FAM and VIC-binding template. Copies/ml and allele fraction
were calculated directly from this.
A PIK3CA multiplex droplet digital PCR assay was used to assess E542K (c.1624
G > A), E545K (c.1633 G > A), H1047R (c.3140 A > G), and H1047L
(c.3140 A > T). Samples were analyzed using either 0.25 ml plasma equivalent or
1.3 ng, whichever was the larger, the latter corresponding to approximately 400
wild-type alleles. A multiplex was called as mutation positive if there were at least
two FAM-positive droplets, at least one of these being FAM only. Samples were
only called as undetectable if there were at least 300 wild-type alleles detected. If
this criterion was not met then the sample was repeated or designated as failed if
there was insufficient material to repeat. Individual mutations were subsequently
confirmed by repeating the same plasma equivalent with a singleplex assay. As the
mutation had previously been identified in the multiplex a single FAM-positive
droplet was accepted as positive. All mutation assays were run with three separate
non-template controls, with no positive calls made above the control FAM signal.
ESR1 mutations were interrogated using two separate droplet digital PCR
multiplexes from Bio-Rad®, multiplex 1 (dHsaMDXE91450042) and multiplex 2
(dHsaMDXE65719815), updating and expanding a previous analysis21. Multiplex 1
assessed E380Q (c.1138 G > C), L536R (c.1607 T > G), Y537C (c.1610 A > G),
D538G (c.1613 A > G) and multiplex 2 assessed S463P (c.1387 T > C), Y537N
(c.1609 T > A), and Y537S (c.1610 A > C). Mutations were then confirmed in
singleplex as for the PIK3CA mutations.
Matched day 15 and end of treatment plasma samples were assessed for
mutations detected at baseline in PIK3CA and ESR1 with singleplex assays under
the same conditions as described above, with the same plasma equivalents tested as
previously for end of treatment but 0.5 ml equivalent/1.3 ng, whichever the larger,
for day 15. The same criteria was used as for the baseline samples for a sample
being called as undetectable. Given the increasing error in estimates from digital
PCR at very low concentrations of template, only those samples with four or more
FAM-positive droplets in the baseline mutation assay were taken forward for
longitudinal analysis.
The Cancer Genome Atlas. The Cancer Genome Atlas data for the PIK3CA
mutations E542K, E545K, H1047R, and H1047L and the ESR1 mutations E380Q,
L536R, Y537C, D538G, S463P, Y537N, and Y537S in breast cancer were accessed
electronically from cBioPortal28, 29 (http://cbioportal.org).
Statistical analysis. The “circulating tumor DNA response” was defined as the
ratio of mutant copies/ml of plasma at day 15 and day 1, subsequently denoted as
CDR15. Aggregate totals of PIK3CA and ESR1 mutation copies/ml were used where
a sample exhibited polyclonality for these mutations. Paired day 1 and day 15
copies/ml and allele fractions were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The
distribution of copies/ml between PIK3CA and ESR1 were compared using the
Mann–Whitney test. Comparisons of CDR15 distributions were treated similarly.
Harrell’s c-index was used to optimize the CDR15 cut-off. The test for an asso-
ciation between undetectable mutation at day 15 and end of treatment was con-
ducted with Fisher’s exact test. Proportions of patients with undetectable mutations
at the end of treatment for PIK3CA and ESR1 were compared with a two sample
test of proportions. For all analyses performed a p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
For analyses of PFS, Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted and groups compared
using the log-rank test. Hazard ratios and associated 95% CIs were obtained from
Cox proportional hazards regression models. In order to determine the optimal
cut-point for CDR15 in relation to PFS, separate models were fitted with data cut at
each observed value of CDR15 with the cut-point giving the highest Harrell’s c-
index considered optimal.
