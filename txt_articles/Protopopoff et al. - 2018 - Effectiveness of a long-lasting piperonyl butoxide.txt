Summary
Background Progress in malaria control is under threat by wide-scale insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. 
Two recent vector control products have been developed: a long-lasting insecticidal net that incorporates a synergist 
piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and a long-lasting indoor residual spraying formulation of the insecticide pirimiphos-
methyl. We evaluated the effectiveness of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets versus standard long-lasting insecticidal 
nets as single interventions and in combination with the indoor residual spraying of pirimiphos-methyl.
Methods We did a four-group cluster randomised controlled trial using a two-by-two factorial design of 48 clusters 
derived from 40 villages in Muleba (Kagera, Tanzania). We randomly assigned these clusters using restricted 
randomisation to four groups: standard long-lasting insecticidal nets, PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets, 
standard long-lasting insecticidal nets plus indoor residual spraying, or PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets plus 
indoor residual spraying. Both standard and PBO nets were distributed in 2015. Indoor residual spraying was 
applied only once in 2015. We masked the inhabitants of each cluster to the type of nets received, as well as field 
staff who took blood samples. Neither the investigators nor the participants were masked to indoor residual 
spraying. The primary outcome was the prevalence of malaria infection in children aged 6 months to 14 years 
assessed by cross-sectional surveys at 4, 9, 16, and 21 months after intervention. The endpoint for assessment of 
indoor residual spraying was 9 months and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets was 21 months. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02288637.
Findings 7184 (68·0%) of 10 560 households were selected for post-intervention survey, and 15 469 (89·0%) of 
17 377 eligible children from the four surveys were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 878 households 
visited in the two indoor residual spraying groups, 827 (94%) had been sprayed. Reported use of long-lasting 
insecticidal nets, across all groups, was 15 341 (77·3%) of 19 852 residents after 1 year, decreasing to 12 503 (59·2%) of 
21 105 in the second year. Malaria infection prevalence after 9 months was lower in the two groups that received 
PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets than in the two groups that received standard long-lasting insecticidal nets 
(531 [29%] of 1852 children vs 767 [42%] of 1809; odds ratio [OR] 0·37, 95% CI 0·21–0·65; p=0·0011). At the same 
timepoint, malaria prevalence in the two groups that received indoor residual spraying was lower than in groups 
that did not receive indoor residual spraying (508 [28%] of 1846 children vs 790 [44%] of 1815; OR 0·33, 95% CI 
0·19–0·55; p<0·0001) and there was evidence of an interaction between PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets and 
indoor residual spraying (OR 2·43, 95% CI 1·19–4·97; p=0·0158), indicating redundancy when combined. The 
PBO long-lasting insecticidal net effect was sustained after 21 months with a lower malaria prevalence than the 
standard long-lasting insecticidal net (865 [45%] of 1930 children vs 1255 [62%] of 2034; OR 0·40, 0·20–0·81; 
p=0·0122).
Interpretation The PBO long-lasting insecticidal net and non-pyrethroid indoor residual spraying interventions 
showed improved control of malaria transmission compared with standard long-lasting insecticidal nets where 
pyrethroid resistance is prevalent and either intervention could be deployed to good effect. As a result, WHO has 
since recommended to increase coverage of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets. Combining indoor residual spraying 
with pirimiphos-methyl and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets provided no additional benefit compared with PBO 
long-lasting insecticidal nets alone or standard long-lasting insecticidal nets plus indoor residual spraying.

Introduction
Long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying 
are the cornerstones of malaria control in sub-
Saharan Africa. Together with effective treatment, these 
interventions are estimated to have globally reduced 
malaria morbidity by 41% and mortality by 62% between 
2000 and 2015.1 Despite this public health success, 
recent wide-scale selec 
tion of insecticide resistance in the 
mosquito vectors across Africa threatens to reverse 
the present gains.2 Development and evaluation of new 
strategies and tools are needed to address the threat of 
resistance and will accelerate progress towards elimination.
The range of insecticides available for indoor residual 
spraying is limited. For long-lasting insecticidal nets, the 
range is particularly restricted because pyrethroids are 
the only class of insecticides recommended by WHO for 
nets. Evidence from indoor residual spraying programmes 
suggests that pyrethroid resistance can contribute to 
operational control failure—eg, in South Africa, control 
was only restored once the pyrethroid was replaced by an 
insecticide to which vectors were susceptible.3 By contrast, 
the negative effect of pyrethroid resistance on the 
effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets has been 
less clear and harder to quantify than indoor residual 
spraying.4 Although entomological evidence suggests that 
these nets are becoming less effective at killing 
mosquitoes in household conditions when resistance 
develops,5,6 the physical barrier provided by the net, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did two searches in PubMed with no language restrictions or 
specified dates. In the first search on long-lasting insecticidal 
nets treated with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), we used the search 
terms “malaria” and “long lasting insecticidal net” in 
combination with “piperonyl butoxide”, “Olyset Plus”, or 
“PermaNet 3.0”, which produced no references that were 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In a 2015 review of PBO 
long-lasting insecticidal nets, WHO concluded that although 
they appeared to have an increased efficacy the evidence was 
too inadequate to justify a switch from pyrethroid only to PBO 
nets across all settings. Because of the potential for an 
antagonistic effect between PBO and organophosphates, WHO 
also recommended that PBO nets should not be used in areas 
programmed for indoor residual spraying with 
pirimiphos-methyl capsule suspension.
In the second search on combined vector control 
interventions, we included the search term “malaria” with one 
or more of the following: “long lasting insecticidal net” or 
“insecticide treated net”, “indoor residual spraying”, “vector 
control”, “pirimiphos methyl”, and “combined interventions”. 
We identified three other RCTs that have examined combined 
intervention of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor 
residual spraying. The Gambian RCT, which used DDT 
(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) as the indoor residual 
spraying component showed no additional protection 
compared with long-lasting insecticidal nets alone. This 
finding could be explained by the high usage of nets or the 
properties of the sprayed insecticide used. In Benin, there was 
no advantage to combining indoor residual spraying and 
long-lasting insecticidal nets; however, suboptimal coverage 
of nets and the short residual effect of the spray used 
(bendiocarb) might have affected the effectiveness of the 
combination intervention. In an earlier Tanzanian study, 
where coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets was moderate 
and pyrethroid resistance present, two rounds of indoor 
residual spraying with bendiocarb combined with long-lasting 
insecticidal nets were more effective than long-lasting 
insecticidal nets alone.
Added value of this study
Our study is the first RCT to report that PBO-treated 
long-lasting insecticidal nets were more effective than standard 
pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets against malaria 
infection and transmission. It also provides the strongest 
evidence to date of the negative effect of high-level pyrethroid 
resistance on the use and efficacy of standard nets. This study is 
also the first RCT to provide evidence for the effect of long-term 
malaria control of the first long-lasting organophosphate 
formulation to be developed specifically for indoor residual 
spraying. The RCT provides new evidence on the added value 
and risks of combining indoor residual spraying and 
long-lasting insecticidal nets, particularly PBO nets.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides justification for the increase in deployment 
and use of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets. As a direct 
consequence of this trial, WHO revised its policy on long-lasting 
insecticidal nets in September, 2017, gave interim endorsement 
to pyrethroid-PBO nets as a new WHO class of vector control 
product, and recommended that PBO nets be deployed for 
prevention of malaria where vectors are resistant to pyrethroids 
provided that vector control coverage is not compromised. This 
endorsement would include many endemic areas in Africa where 
standard long-lasting insecticidal nets are currently used. 
The demonstration that long-lasting insecticidal nets with an 
appropriate change of active ingredient can continue to tackle 
transmission by pyrethroid-resistant vector populations will 
ensure the viability of this approach as well as justifies the 
continued investment and search for alternative insecticides for 
use on nets.
Finally, the organophosphate indoor residual spraying 
formulation is the first long-lasting, non-pyrethroid insecticide 
to provide malaria control for at least 9 months over 
two transmission seasons in the same year. This finding justifies 
the scale up and use of indoor residual spraying in 
sub-Saharan Africa and the 12-year investment into long-lasting 
alternatives to pyrethroid and DDT for indoor spraying between 
private and public sector organisations.

especially when new and intact, might mitigate some of 
the loss in bioefficacy due to resistance.7 Cohort studies 
have shown that long-lasting insecticidal nets remain 
protective against malaria infection in areas of moderate 
insecticide resistance in Malawi8 and Kenya,9 whereas no 
reduction in incidence was observed after the distribution 
of these nets in Uganda.10
Anticipating the possible failure of current control tools 
due to resistance, WHO has encouraged the industry to 
develop new types of long-lasting insecticidal nets and new 
insecticides for indoor residual spraying. One of these 
developments is a new long-lasting insecticidal net that 
uses piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO is a chemical 
synergist that acts by inhibiting enzymes involved in the 
natural defense mechanisms of insects, which results 
in pyrethroid not being detoxified in the insect and the 
pyrethroid on the long-lasting insecticidal net remaining 
potent against mosquitoes despite resistance. Such PBO-
pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets appear to 
have similar or better efficacy against resistant mosquitoes 
under controlled household conditions than standard 
long-lasting insecticidal nets that do not have PBO.11,12 
In September, 2015, a WHO expert group reviewed 
the evidence for PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets to 
de 
fine their deployment. Despite awaiting for more 
con 
clusive evidence from community randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) with epidemiological outcomes, 
WHO, nevertheless, has recommended a small rollout in 
specific situations.13
Although the range of insecticide classes suitable for 
indoor residual spraying use is wider than long-lasting 
insecticidal nets, few insecticides are effective for more 
than a few months when sprayed onto walls and this 
limitation has been a constraint on their adoption 
and use. The organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl is 
an exception, and the recently developed long-lasting 
formulation, Actellic 300CS (Syngenta, Switzerland), is 
effective for up to 10 months when used for indoor residual 
spraying.14 It is now being deployed in several African 
countries instead of carbamates.15
In attempts to accelerate malaria control progress, long-
lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying have 
been deployed together in several countries.1 The 
advantage of combined intervention has, however, been 
the focus of considerable debate because both observational 
and RCTs have produced contradictory evidence. In The 
Gambia and Benin, no difference in malarial outcomes 
were reported when both control strategies were deployed 
together compared with long-lasting insecticidal nets 
alone,16,17 whereas in Tanzania an increased effectiveness 
was observed when they were used in combination.18 On 
the basis of these data, the effect observed would seem to 
depend on the insecticide combination used, the vectors 
present, the coverage and quality of the intervention, and 
the level and type of insecticide resistance in the vectors.
To develop an improved strategy for control of malaria 
transmitted by pyrethroid-resistant mosquito vectors, 
we aimed to compare the effectiveness of PBO long-
lasting insecticidal nets with standard long-lasting 
insecticidal nets as single interventions and in combi-
nation with the long-lasting indoor residual spraying of 
pirimiphos-methyl.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a cluster RCT of four groups using a two-by-two 
factorial design. The RCT started on March 1, 2014. The 
post-intervention assessment period was initially planned 
for 18 months (from Jan 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016) and was 
subsequently extended on our request to the funding 
agency to 24 months (from Jan 1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2016) to 
enable further assessment of the PBO long-lasting 
insecticidal net (figure 1).
The study area was Muleba district of the Kagera region 
in northwest Tanzania, and comprised 40 villages. In 
2011, malaria infection prevalence in children was 23%.18 
Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis were the only 
vectors found in 2012. High levels of resistance to 
pyrethroids have been reported in A gambiae in the study 
area, and synergy bioassay tests done with PBO and 
pyrethroid together partially restored the toxicity of 
pyrethroids.19 All villages and hamlets with malaria 
prevalence more than 20% in 2011 were eligible for 
inclusion in the present trial. Our trial comprised 
48 clusters, each divided into an inner core area, which 
was used for the measurement of study outcomes, and an 
outer buffer zone of at least 300 m to reduce spill-over 
effects between clusters.20 Core and buffer areas of each 
cluster received the same intervention. All households in 
the core area with children aged 6 months to 14 years 
were eligible for malaria cross-sectional survey and 
mosquito surveillance. We excluded children who were 
severely ill. Village meetings were held with village 
leaders, hamlet representatives, community health 
agents, and villagers to inform them about the trial.
The trial was approved by the ethics review committees 
of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, 
the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and 
the Tanzanian Medical Research Coordinating Committee 
(NIMR/HQ/R.8a/VolIX/1803). A trial steering committee 
reviewed progress. Written informed consent from 
parents or guardians was obtained for each survey and 
entomology collection.
Randomisation and masking
We used restricted randomisation to allocate the 
48 clusters to the four study groups: standard long-lasting 
insecticidal nets, PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets, 
standard long-lasting insecticidal nets plus indoor 
residual spraying, and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets 
plus indoor residual spraying. We limited potential 
imbalance using three restriction variables: malaria 
infection prevalence in children aged 6 months to 
14 years, usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets, and

socioeconomic status, as recorded in the baseline sur-
vey between September and October, 2014. Of the 
200 000 random allocations, 29 478 met the restriction 
criteria of no more than 7% difference in mean malaria 
prevalence, 10% in mean usage of long-lasting insecticidal 
nets, and 10% of households in the lowest socioeconomic 
status tertile between study groups. After verifying that 
clusters were independently allocated to study groups, we 
randomly chose one of the eligible allocations.
We masked the inhabitants of each cluster to the type 
of long-lasting insecticidal nets received. The two types 
of nets were of similar colour and shape, and only 
distinguishable by label codes and coloured thread 
inserted during manufacture. Additionally, we masked 
field staff, who took blood samples in the cross-sectional 
surveys, to the study groups the clusters were assigned to. 
It was not possible to mask either the investigators or 
the participants to the treatment allocation of indoor 
residual spraying.
Procedures
We used the following vector control products: Olyset Net 
(Sumitomo Chemicals, Japan) containing 2% permethrin 
(standard long-lasting insecticidal net), Olyset Plus 
(Sumitomo Chemicals, Japan) containing 2% permethrin 
and 1% PBO (PBO long-lasting insecticidal net), and 
Actellic 300CS containing microencapsulated pirimiphos-
methyl (indoor residual spraying).
We georeferenced all houses in the study using hand-
held global positioning system units (Legend eTrex, 
Garmin, USA). The indoor residual spraying campaign 
was done once only in February, 2015, by the Research 
Triangle Institute funded by the President’s Malaria 
Initiative. In the two groups assigned to indoor residual 
spraying intervention, Actellic 300CS was sprayed to the 
interior walls and ceilings of each dwelling at the 
recommended dosage of 1 g/m². The residual decay of 
Actellic 300CS was monitored by a laboratory technician 
 
every 3 months on representative wall surfaces in several 
houses using WHO Cone bioassay tests (Universiti Sains 
Malaysia, Malaysia) and a reference strain of susceptible 
A gambiae. The permethrin and PBO contents of the 
long-lasting insecticidal nets were determined by high-
performance liquid chromatography at yearly intervals 
for 2 years.
Distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets and health 
education communication on net usage were done in each 
cluster by the Tanzania Communication and Development 
Centre. On the basis of census data, each household 
received one net per two people. Altogether, 45 000 standard 
long-lasting insecticidal nets and 45 000 PBO long-lasting 
insecticidal nets were distributed in February, 2015. 
Nets already owned were not removed but householders 
were requested to use the study nets provided.
Cross-sectional household and malaria infection 
prevalence surveys were done by project field assistants 
and nurses at baseline in September and October, 2014, 
and after intervention at the end of each malaria 
transmission season (June to July and November to 
December) in 2015 and 2016 (figure 1). During each 
survey, we randomly sampled 55 households with children 
aged 6 months to 14 years from the core area of each 
cluster using the census lists. We then selected up to 
three eligible children per house at random and recorded 
information about the number of residents, household 
assets, house structure, educational status, and use of 
malaria preventive measures (long-lasting insecticidal 
nets or other). The minimum target was 80 children per 
cluster. Enrolled children reported to the clinical team the 
next day and were tested for mal 
aria using a rapid 
diagnostic test (CareStart Malaria HRP2/pLDH(pf/PAN) 
Combo, DiaSys, UK) and for haemoglobin concentration 
using HemoCue Hb 201+ (HemoCue AB, Sweden). 
Children diagnosed as malaria positive by the rapid 
diagnostic test were treated with artemether-lumefantrine 
according to national guidelines. Any child presenting 
with illness during the surveys was treated or referred to 
the nearest health facility if symptoms were severe.

Mosquito surveillance was done from March, 2015, to 
December, 2016, in each cluster by a project field assistant 
for one night per month in seven randomly selected 
houses per cluster using CDC Miniature Light Trap Model 
512 (John W Hock Company, USA) as a proxy for human 
biting rates.17 We morphologically identified the collected 
anophelines to species level21 and tested a subsample for 
Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein.22 PCR 
TaqMan assay23 was used to distinguish the two sibling 
species (A gambiae and A arabiensis) and to identify 
mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc-1014F 
and Vgsc-1014S) associated with resistance to pyrethroids.24 
Using wild caught A gambiae and Anopheles funestus of 
unknown age, the frequency of pyrethroid resistance was 
determined using 0·75% permethrin papers in WHO 
cylinder tests. We determined resistance intensity using 
CDC bottle bioassays and probit analysis to estimate the 
ratio of the permethrin concentration needed to kill 
50% of wild mosquitoes relative to the susceptible strain.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the prevalence of Plasmodium 
spp infection measured by the rapid diagnostic test in 
children aged 6 months to 14 years assessed by the cross-
sectional surveys. The trial was initially funded for 
18 months after intervention. Although this period could 
have been chosen as the endpoint, it was not known for 
how long the PBO and pyrethroid active ingredients in 
the long-lasting insecticidal nets would last. This effect 
needed to be monitored every transmission season. We 
subsequently secured extension from the funding agency 
for 24 months. WHO then reset the policy agenda

declaring that new types of long-lasting insecticidal nets 
(such as the PBO net) should be effective for at least 
two transmission seasons or 2 years. The primary 
endpoint for the indoor residual spraying was 1 year, 
based on reports of duration of residual activity. Be-
cause the two intervention products were being assessed 
separately and in combination, the main endpoint for 
assessment of the indoor residual spraying was 9 months 
and the PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets was 9 months 
and then 21 months.
The secondary main outcome was malaria trans-
mission or entomological inoculation rate, defined as 
the mean number of infective mosquito bites per 
household per month, during the first year and second 
year after intervention. Other secondary endpoints were 
the proportion of children with moderate-to-severe 
anaemia (defined as haemoglobin <8 g/dL), the 
sporozoite rate (the proportion of anopheline mosquitoes 
collected that were infected with malaria sporozoites), 
and anopheline population density.
Statistical analysis
This study had 80% power25 to detect a relative reduction in 
prevalence of infection of at least 28% (prevalence ratio 
0·72) for each of the two main effects (ie, indoor residual 
spraying vs no indoor residual spraying, and PBO long-
lasting insecticidal nets vs no PBO long-lasting insecticidal 
nets) and a 40% difference between any of the individual 
groups, with 24 clusters of 80 individuals per cluster being 
tested in each of these comparisons, and assuming a mean 
prevalence of 20% in the reference groups and a coefficient 
of variation of 0·3 (based on data from the earlier study).18
Statistical analysis was done using Stata (version 12). All 
statistical inferences allowed for within-cluster correlation 
of responses by use of a robust variance estimator to 
calculate SEs. No allowance was made for multiplicity of 
testing in the analyses. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 
logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) 
of the effect of each of the two interventions (PBO long-
lasting insecticidal nets vs standard long-lasting insecticidal 
nets, and indoor residual spraying vs no indoor residual 
spraying) on prevalence of infection and prevalence of 
anaemia. We estimated interaction between the two main 
effects by including an appropriate term in the model. We 
also examined the effect of each intervention (PBO long-
lasting insecticidal nets, combination of standard long-
lasting insecticidal nets plus indoor residual spraying, and 
combination of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets plus 
indoor residual spraying) compared with the control group 
(standard long-lasting insecticidal net). Effects were 
interpreted in relation to a postulated minimum difference 
of 28% for factorial analysis and 40% for the analysis 
of each intervention. Analysis of anaemia was restricted 
to children aged 6 months to 4 years. The per-protocol 
analysis is available in the appendix.
Vector density and entomological inoculation rate 
were analysed with negative binomial regression, after 
adjusting for baseline. Entomological inoculation rate was 
estimated as the mean number of sporozoite-infected 
Anopheles per house per night26 and weighted to account 
for the proportion of collected Anopheles processed for 
sporozoites. 
The 
proportion 
of 
sporozoite-infected 
mosquitoes (the sporozoite rate) was compared using 
logistic regression.

Results
The study area comprised 29 365 households and a 
population of 135 900. Of the 10 560 households sel 
ected 
for 
post-intervention 
survey, 
7184 
(68·0%) 
were 
in 
cluded whereas 1127 (10·7%) were ineligible (no 
children younger than 15 years), 150 (1·4%) refused, 
1543 (14·6%) were absent, and 556 (5·3%) were un-
visited. Of the 17 377 eligible children selected, 
15 492 (89·2%) attended for testing (figure 2). Pre-
intervention household and demographic character 
istics, 
as well as coverage and usage of long-lasting insecticidal 
nets were similar between study groups (table 1). Malaria 
infection prevalence was reported in 2499 (65%) of 
3861 children at baseline, and any difference between 
groups were within the tolerances set for the cons-
trained randomisation. The average indoor Anopheles 
density was 27·6 per house per night and the 
proportion of mosquitoes with sporozoites was 4·5%. 
Of 
the 
13 689 
Anopheline 
mosquitoes 
collected, 
13 106 (95·7%) were A gambiae sensu lato and 
510 (3·7%) were A funestus. Of the 990 A gambiae sensu 
lato identified to species, 946 (95·6%) were A gambiae 
sensu stricto and 44 (4·4%) were A arabiensis.
Between baseline and the first cross-sectional sur-
vey 4 months after intervention, long-lasting insecti 
cidal 
net ownership (≥one net per household) increased to 
1690 (97·6%) of 1732 households, access (household with 
enough long-lasting insecticidal net per sleeping place) 
increased to 1550 (89·6%) of 1730, and long-lasting 
insecticidal net use increased to 7807 (76·9%) of 10 152 
(appendix). Long-lasting insecticidal net usage was 
similar between groups and between surveys during the 
first year. In the second year, 21 months after intervention, 
access decreased to 1291 (70·2%) of 1839 households and 
usage to 5905 (56·0%) of 10 551 residents. Most long-
lasting insecticidal nets observed were those deployed 
from this study. In the standard long-lasting insecticidal 
net (Olyset Net), permethrin concentration at 0 months 
of use was 21·4 g/kg and 21·5 g/kg after 12 months of 
use and decreased to 16·7 g/kg after 21 months of use. 
For the PBO long-lasting insecticidal net (Olyset Plus), 
permethrin concentration at 0 months of use was 
20·9 g/kg, which decreased to 14·7 g/kg after 12 months 
and to 12·2 g/kg after 21 months, while PBO 
concentration on Olyset Plus also decreased from 
9·5 g/kg at 0 months to 2·9 g/kg after 12 months and to 
1·6 g/kg after 21 months of use.
827 (94%) of 878 households selected for the survey 
received indoor residual spraying in the two groups 
assigned to this intervention. The insecticide residues 
on sprayed walls decayed gradually over the year; mosquito 
mortality in WHO cone bioassays was 99% (566 of 
570 exposed mosquitoes died, 95% CI 97·9–100) 
shortly after spraying, 82% (356 of 432, 75·4–89·5) 
after 9 months, and 59% (495 of 840, 51·4–66·4) after 
12 months.
In the intention-to-treat factorial analysis for the 
prevalence of malaria infection, the effect of indoor 
residual spraying versus no indoor residual spraying 
was evident at 4 months (OR 0·50, 95% CI 0·31–0·82; 
p=0·0071) whereas there was no evidence of a difference 
between PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets and

standard long-lasting insecticidal nets (0·68, 0·39–1·18; 
p=0·1630; table 2). A clear effect was observed 9 months 
after intervention for indoor residual spraying versus no 
indoor spraying (OR 0·33, 95% CI 0·19–0·55; p<0·0001) 
and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets versus standard 
nets (OR 0·37, 0·21–0·65; p=0·0011). During the second 
year, the prevalence of malaria infection in the PBO 
long-lasting insecticidal net groups remained less than 
in the standard long-lasting insecticidal net groups 
(OR 0·47, 95% CI 0·26–0·87; p=0·0173 after 16 months 
of intervention; and 0·40, 0·20–0·81; p=0·0122 after 
21 months of intervention), whereas the effect of the 
single round of indoor residual spraying applied 
previously waned over time (OR 0·59, 95% CI 0·34–1·04 
after 16 months; and 0·58, 0·29–1·14 after 21 months; 
table 2). The only significant interaction was at 9 months 
(OR 2·43, 95% CI 1·19–4·97; p=0·0158), suggesting that 
at this point in time the combined effect of indoor 
residual spraying and PBO long-lasting insecticidal net 
was less than the additive effect of each of the two 
effects alone.
In the analysis of the individual group comparisons, 
the difference in malaria infection prevalence between 
the reference group (standard long-lasting insecticidal 
net) and the PBO long-lasting insecticidal net group or 
the combination of the standard net plus indoor residual 
spraying group was greater than that observed in the 
factorial analysis at every timepoint between PBO nets 
and non-PBO nets or between indoor residual spraying 
and no indoor spraying (table 2). The individual group 
comparison also provides information about the effect of 
the PBO long-lasting insecticidal net plus indoor residual 
spraying intervention.
Prevalence of severe-to-moderate anaemia was lower 
for the groups receiving PBO long-lasting insecticidal net 
compared with their standard long-lasting insecticidal 
net reference groups, and was also lower in the groups 
receiving indoor residual spraying than in the non-
indoor residual spraying reference groups in the surveys 
after 9 months and 16 months intervention (table 3). 
Results of the per-protocol analyses of malaria infection 
and anaemia were similar to that of the intention-to-treat 
analyses (appendix).
A total of 16 371 vector mosquitoes were collected in 
5756 indoor light-trap collections over the 2 years. In the 
first year, vector densities, sporozoite rates, and ento-
mological inoculation rates were lower in the PBO long-
lasting insecticidal net groups than in the standard 
long-lasting insecticidal net groups (table 4), but only 
entomological inoculation rate was significantly lower in 
the indoor residual spraying groups than in the non-
indoor residual spraying groups. In the second year, the 
entomological inoculation rate in the PBO long-lasting 
insecticidal groups remained lower than in the standard 
long-lasting insecticidal net groups but the effect of indoor 
residual spraying on entomological inoculation rate had 
largely diminished by this time compared with the 
entomological inoculation rates of 2015.

8·8% (95% CI 5·3–12·3; n/N=54/613) for A gambiae 
sensu lato and 54·5% (36·8–76·2; n/N=59/108) for 
A funestus. The lethal concentration required to kill 
50% of the wild A gambiae sensu lato was 38-times higher 
and of wild A funestus was 34-times higher than for the 
susceptible reference mosquitoes. The Vgsc gene 
mutation was found in all tested A gambiae with co-
occurrence of Vgsc-1014F and Vgsc-1014S in 22 (9%) of 
234 A gambiae mosquitoes. No mutation was found in 
the 247 A arabiensis tested.
Discussion
This trial showed that long-lasting insecticidal nets 
incorporating the synergist PBO (Olyset Plus) were more 
effective than the standard pyrethroid long-lasting 
insecticidal net (Olyset Net) in reducing malaria infection 
prevalence in an area of high usage of these nets and high 
pyrethroid resistance in the primary vectors. The additional 
effect of the PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets on malaria 
prevalence was evident at the end of the first year with a 
44% protective efficacy and at the end of the second year 
with a 33% protective efficacy compared with the standard 
long-lasting insecticidal nets. These findings were 
supported by the entomological outcomes, which showed 
a significant reduction in malaria transmission, with 
entomological inoculation rates being reduced by 
87% during the first year and 67% during the second year 
in areas receiving PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets 
compared with standard long-lasting insecticidal nets. 
At 9 months, the addition of pirimiphos-methyl indoor 
residual spraying to the standard long-lasting insecticidal 
nets 
provided 
similar 
protection 
against 
malaria 
(44% protective efficacy) relative to the standard nets alone, 
whereas the addition of indoor residual spraying to PBO 
long-lasting insecticidal nets did not significantly improve 
protection based on the interaction observed when both 
indoor spraying and PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets 
effect were at their strongest. The impact of indoor residual 
spraying on the entomological inoculation rates was more 
than 95% in the first year. This effect on malaria 
transmission occurred shortly after implementation of 
indoor residual spraying whereas the effect of PBO long-
lasting insecticidal nets took longer. This rapid impact of 
indoor residual spraying is one reason why this 
intervention is sometimes more favoured than long-lasting 
insecticidal net distribution during malaria epidemics, 
although there has been a paucity of evidence to justify this 
advice.27 Our cluster RCT would support this recom-
mendation, provided high indoor residual spraying 
coverage can be quickly achieved. Residual insecticidal 
activity of pirimiphos-methyl on the sprayed walls was 
observed up to 12 months after a single round of spraying. 
Following the decay in residual activity during the second 
year when no spraying was done, the effect of indoor 
residual spraying on entomological inoculation rates 
diminished and malaria prevalence increased but not to 
the level observed in the standard long-lasting insecticidal 
net control group, which had not received indoor residual 
spraying in year 1. A sustained effect on malaria 
transmission would require recurrent annual campaigns 
of indoor residual spraying.
This trial is the first to provide evidence to suggest that 
incorporation of the synergist PBO to long-lasting 
insecticidal nets provides improved community pro-
tection compared with standard pyrethroid-only nets 
against malaria transmission by pyrethroid-resistant 
vector populations. Previous small-scale experimental hut 
studies of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets measured 
entomological outcomes such as mosquito mortality and 
biting rates. In Benin, these studies showed that Olyset 
Plus was more effective than standard Olyset Net against 
pyrethroid-resistant A gambiae, both before and after 
multiple washing of the nets.12 In Tanzania where 
A gambiae was still susceptible to pyrethroids, the 
differential effect between Olyset Plus and standard 
Olyset Net was less evident.28 Parallel studies with a 
different type of PBO long-lasting insecticidal net 
(PermaNet 3.0) showed improved outcomes with the

unwashed PBO net compared with the standard long-
lasting insecticidal net, but in some studies the efficacy 
was lost after several washes.29 Although these small-scale 
studies11,12,28,29 indicate the potential of PBO nets, they 
could not capture the full effect of this new class of net on 
transmission, which is only understood at high coverage 
levels and in community randomised trials because of the 
additional community protection that arises from the 
reduction in mosquito life-span and population density, 
often called the vectorial mass effect.27 With the relatively 
high coverage and usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets 
achieved in the present trial (77% usage in the first year 
and 60% in the second year), we were able to observe a 
mass effect of the PBO nets on transmission, with 
concomitant reductions in mosquito density, sporozoite 
rate, and entomological inoculation rates.
Despite the 83% loss in PBO content after 21 months, 
the PBO and permethrin retained on the net remained 
highly effective against malaria infection and entomo-
logical inoculation rates throughout. By contrast, the loss 
of residual activity of the single round of indoor residual 
spraying of Actellic 300CS led to resumption of trans-
mission and to increasing entomological inoculation rates 
and malaria prevalence in the second year. The PBO nets 
will be monitored during a third year to assess whether 
effectiveness is maintained at low PBO content. There 
was also a 42% loss of permethrin content in Olyset Plus 
and 22% in Olyset Net over the two years. The differential 
release rate of permethrin in the two nets has been 
observed in other studies, and it has been suggested in an 
earlier WHO review of Olyset Plus that the more effective 
performance of the PBO net is due to the higher release 
rate and surface concentration of permethrin in this net 
compared with Olyset Net.28 Although this argument 
cannot be completely refuted by our data, the A gambiae 
and A funestus vectors in the Muleba area are highly 
resistant to pyrethroid and any difference in surface 
permethrin between Olyset Plus and Olyset Net in our 
trial is unlikely to result in differential mortality rate. A 
study has shown that under household conditions a 
20-times increase in the surface content of permethrin on 
hand-treated nets causes no increase in mortality to free-
flying pyrethroid-resistant A gambiae.30 Furthermore, 
synergy tests with PBO showed that pyrethroid-resistant 
A gambiae from our study area are killed by a permethrin 
concentration they would normally survive if it were not 
mixed with PBO.19
The more effective performance of PBO long-lasting 
insecticidal nets compared with standard long-lasting 
insecticidal nets in reducing the prevalence of malaria 
infection, together with no change in prevalence following 
the initial distribution and high usage of standard nets, 
suggests that insecticide resistance of the magnitude 
reported is compromising the effectiveness of standard 
pyrethroid nets in northwest Tanzania. A recent study in 
neighbouring Uganda reported no change in incidence of 
malaria before and after the distribution of standard long-
lasting insecticidal nets.10 Other studies have reported the 
failure of these nets to reduce entomological indicators 
after the standard long-lasting insecticidal nets developed 
holes.5,6 From our study design, it is not clear whether the 
standard nets still provide some degree of protection. 
Although a previous study in Muleba done in 2012 showed 
that users of standard long-lasting insecticidal nets 
were slightly better protected (OR 0·83) against malaria 
infection prevalence than non-users of nets,31 this finding 
should be contrasted with the much larger effect of PBO 
long-lasting insecticidal nets versus standard nets 
(OR 0·37) in the present study. In areas with more 
moderate levels of pyrethroid resistance, standard nets still

provide personal protection. A study in Malawi, for 
example, showed that standard nets reduced malaria 
incidence by 30% in children in an area where pyrethroid-
resistant A funestus was the main vector.8 In Kenya, the use 
of standard nets provided 45% protection against the 
incidence of malaria infection as compared with those not 
using long-lasting insecticidal nets, but incidence still 
remained high in net users.9 The strength or intensity of 
resistance in the local primary vector species might be the 
factor defining the level of protection to be derived from 
standard long-lasting insecticidal nets.
Our study provides further insight into the question of 
whether indoor residual spraying and long-lasting 
insecticidal nets should be combined to accelerate the 
control of malaria. In a previous cluster RCT in Muleba, 
where conditions of high pyrethroid resistance and 
moderate usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (50%), 
indoor residual spraying with the carbamate bendiocarb 
provided an added benefit (OR 0·43).18 In the present 
study, a single round of indoor residual spraying with the 
long-lasting pirimiphos-methyl capsule suspension in 
combination with standard nets was sufficient to give long-
term additional protection over two transmission seasons 
(OR 0·33), whereas the bendiocarb required two rounds to 
achieve an effect of similar size, owing to its shorter 
residual activity on walls.
The combination of indoor residual spraying of 
pirimiphos-methyl and PBO long-last insecticidal nets 
have been suggested to be antagonistic.13 This concern 
arose because pirimiphos-methyl requires oxidation by 
cytochrome P450 enzymes within the mosquito before it 
becomes toxic. Uptake of PBO from previous contact with 
Olyset Plus nets might potentially inhibit this activation 
process. Although the present cluster RCT neither 
confirmed nor disproved any antagonistic effect, it showed 
there was limited benefit to be gained from adding this 
indoor residual spraying product to PBO nets. Whether 
another indoor residual spraying insecticide, which does 
not require activation by cytochrome P450s, would prove 
an effective partner to PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets is 
not known. The present cluster RCT also implies that 
where indoor spraying with pirimiphos-methyl is being 
applied annually, the substitution of PBO nets for standard 
nets would provide little or no additional benefit. 
Considering the focal coverage of indoor residual spraying 
compared with the much wider coverage of long-lasting 
insecticidal nets in Africa, an important question from a 
public health standpoint is which strategy should be 
adopted in areas where standard long-lasting insecticidal 
nets might be losing effectiveness because of high intensity 
of pyrethroid resistance in the local vector? The substitution 
of PBO long-lasting insecticidal nets in such areas would 
provide a substantial benefit, similar to that which annual 
indoor residual spraying campaigns might provide.
This trial has several potential limitations. Buffer areas 
of 300 m were small compared with what has been used in 
other trials,17,18 which might not have totally prevented 
contamination. However, any spill-over would have 
lessened rather than increased the effect size between 
intervention groups. Additionally, the community was not 
masked to the indoor residual spraying allocation, which 
might have led to reduced child attendance at clinic 
sessions. However, such bias has not been observed and 
attendance was similar across all intervention groups. 
Furthermore, we used vector density in CDC light trap 
collections as a proxy to estimate entomological inoculation 
rate, rather than vector biting rate in human landing 
catches. The light trap approach is becoming more 
common in trials for pragmatic and ethical reasons; and 
although it could have led to error in the estimation of 
transmission intensity, it would not have affected the 
relative difference in entomological inoculation rates 
observed between the study groups. Finally, our trial was 
not powered to detect interactions.
In conclusion, this trial shows the residual efficacy of 
indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl for 
malaria control of over 1 year, and provides strong 
evidence for increasing the coverage of PBO long-lasting 
insecticidal nets over standard long-lasting insecticidal 
nets of pyrethroid to meet the increasing challenge of 
pyrethroid resistance and to improve personal and 
community protection from malaria, particularly in areas 
of intense pyrethroid resistance. As a consequence of the 
trial, WHO has made this policy recommendation.32
