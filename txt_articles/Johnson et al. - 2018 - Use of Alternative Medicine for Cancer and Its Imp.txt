Abstract
There is limited available information on patterns of utilization and efficacy of alternative medicine (AM) for patients with
cancer. We identified 281 patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer who chose AM, administered as
sole anticancer treatment among patients who did not receive conventional cancer treatment (CCT), defined as chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, surgery, and/or hormone therapy. Independent covariates on multivariable logistic regression associated with
increased likelihood of AM use included breast or lung cancer, higher socioeconomic status, Intermountain West or Pacific
location, stage II or III disease, and low comorbidity score. Following 2:1 matching (CCT ¼ 560 patients and AM¼ 280 patients) on
Cox proportional hazards regression, AM use was independently associated with greater risk of death compared with CCT overall
(hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.88 to 3.27) and in subgroups with breast (HR¼ 5.68, 95% CI ¼ 3.22 to
10.04), lung (HR¼ 2.17, 95% CI¼ 1.42 to 3.32), and colorectal cancer (HR¼ 4.57, 95% CI¼ 1.66 to 12.61). Although rare, AM utilization
for curable cancer without any CCT is associated with greater risk of death.
Delay or refusal of conventional cancer treatment (CCT), when
done in favor of alternative medicine (AM), may have serious
survival implications for cancer patients (1–7). However, there is
limited research evaluating the use and effectiveness of AM,
partly due to data scarcity or patient hesitance to disclose non-
medical therapy to their providers (8,9). To address this knowl-
edge gap, we used the four most prevalent cancers (breast,
prostate, lung, and colorectal) in the United States (10) from the
National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2013 to identify the
factors associated with AM selection and compared survival
outcomes between AM and CCT.
Patients who underwent AM were identified as those coded
as “other-unproven: cancer treatments administered by non-
medical personnel” and who also did not receive CCT, defined
as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and/or hormone ther-
apy. Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis, stage IV dis-
ease based on the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC)
staging system (11), receipt of upfront treatment with palliative
intent, and unknown treatment status or clinical or demo-
graphic characteristics were excluded.
Demographic and clinical factors were evaluated using the
chi-square test and the t test for categorical and continuous var-
iables, respectively. Independent associations with AM use (vs
CCT alone) were identified using multivariable logistic regres-
sion. Two-to-one nearest-neighbor propensity score matching
without replacement was performed to compare overall sur-
vival (OS). Univariate survival analyses were completed using
the Kaplan-Meier estimator, log-rank test, and Cox proportional
hazards regression. Variables with P value of .10 or less on uni-
variate analyses were entered into a multivariable Cox propor-
tional hazards survival model using forced entry for the 2:1
matched sample. The assumption of proportionality was veri-
fied graphically using log-log survival plots. All statistical tests
were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered
statistically significant.
We identified 281 cancer patients who chose AM in lieu of
CCT. Patient characteristics between AM and CCT are shown in
Supplementary Table 1 (available online). Notably, patients in
the AM group were more likely to be younger, to be female, to
have a lower Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Score (CDCS), and to

factors, patients undergoing AM were more likely to have breast

 95% CI = 31.1% to 51.2%, P < .001; HR ¼ 2.17, 95% CI = 1.42 to 3.32),
and colorectal cancer (32.7%, 95% CI = 15.8% to 50.8%, vs 79.4%,
95% = CI 66.3% to 87.8%, P < .001; HR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.66 to
12.61), but not for prostate cancer (86.2%, 95% CI = 73.9% to 92.9%,
vs 91.5%, 95% CI = 84.7% to 95.4%, P = .36; HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 0.68
to 4.17) (Figure 1, B–E) on univariate and multivariable analyses.
Patients who initially chose AM for treatment of curable
cancer in lieu of CCT were rare and had statistically signifi-
cantly worse survival. After controlling for sociodemographic
and clinical factors, the magnitude of difference was largest
for breast cancer because women who used AM as initial
treatment without CCT had more than a fivefold increased
risk of death. Patients with colorectal and lung cancer had a
more than fourfold and twofold increase in risk of death, re-
spectively. Notably, there was no statistically significant as-
sociation between AM use and survival for patients with
prostate cancer. This is not unexpected, given the long
natural history of prostate cancer and the short median
follow-up in this study. Among our study population, approx-
imately
74.6%
of
prostate
cancer
patients
had
low-
to
intermediate-risk disease, a subgroup with level 1 evidence
showing no difference in risk of death when comparing obser-
vation with surgery or radiotherapy and hormone therapy at
10 years (12).
It is important to note that complementary and integrative
medicine are not the same as AM as defined in our study (13).
Whereas complementary and integrative medicine incorporate
a wide range of therapies that complement conventional medi-
cine, AM is an unproven therapy that was given in place of con-
ventional treatment. As there is limited evidence of patients
who chose AM as the primary treatment for their cancer, accu-
rate comparisons between our cohort and other studies remain
difficult. However, there are several important similarities be-
tween AM use characteristics and those who seek complemen-
tary cancer therapies, including younger age, breast cancer,
higher education and income, Pacific region, and more ad-
vanced stage (9,14–16).
One important limitation of our analysis is its observational
nature, which may have underascertained the use of CCT for
patients who received treatment at another facility or patients
who initially received AM prior to presenting to a data-collect-
ing facility. However, these underreported or late presenta-
tions would have likely biased our study toward the null (ie,
lack of survival difference), making our findings potentially
more clinically meaningful. Other limitations of the data in-
clude unmeasured confounders or selection bias that could
impact survival. However, because patients receiving alterna-
tive medicine were more likely to be younger, more affluent,
more well-educated, and less burdened with comorbidities,
this would not likely account for the observed survival differ-
ences. Last, we lack information regarding the type of alterna-
tive therapies delivered, though there is limited to no available
evidence that specific AM therapies have been shown to im-
prove cancer survival.
In conclusion, we found that cancer patients who initially
chose treatment with AM without CCT were more likely to die.
Improved communication between patients and caregivers and
greater scrutiny of the use of AM for the initial treatment of can-
cer is needed.
