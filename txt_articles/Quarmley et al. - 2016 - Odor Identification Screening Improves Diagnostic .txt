Abstract
Background—Measurements of olfaction may serve as useful biomarkers of incipient dementia. 
Here we examine the improvement in diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) when assessing both cognitive functioning and odor identification.
Objective—To determine the utility of odor identification as a supplementary screening test in 
incipient AD.
Methods—Sniffin’ Sticks Odor Identification Test (SS-OIT) and the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) were administered in 262 AD, 174 MCI [150 amnestic (aMCI), and 24 non-
amnestic (naMCI)], and 292 healthy older adults (HOA).
Results—Odor identification scores were higher in HOA relative to MCI or AD groups, and MCI 
outperformed AD. Odor identification scores were higher in aMCI single domain than aMCI 
multiple domain. Complementing MoCA scores with the SS-OIT significantly improved 
diagnostic accuracy of individuals with AD and MCI, including within MCI subgroups.
Discussion—Odor identification is a useful supplementary screening tool that provides 
additional information relevant for clinical categorization of AD and MCI, including those who are 
at highest risk to convert to AD.

 INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause 
of disability in old age [1]. Early identification of individuals likely to develop AD dementia 
is crucial for preventative or mitigating interventions. Current research efforts are focused on 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a cognitive syndrome enriched in individuals with 
prodromal AD [2]. Individuals with MCI, in particular those with amnestic MCI, are at 
heightened risk for developing dementia [3], with annual conversion rates to AD between 
8-15%, with most conversions within three years of presentation [4].
Early and accurate detection of cognitive and other neurological or psychiatric impairments 
in MCI that are indicative of a risk for progression to dementia can enhance clinical 
management as well as lead to better understanding of individual differences in disease 
progression. To this effect, recent studies of cognitive function in MCI are aimed at early 
detection and prevention strategies. Recent work [5] confirms and extends prior findings on 
the diagnostic utility of detailed neuropsychological inventories and cognitive screens in AD 
and MCI. However, challenges remain in efficiently identifying the prodromal stages of MCI 
that lead to AD. Poor differentiation is likely due to several factors including: 1) 
heterogeneity of the MCI diagnosis; 2) variable progression rates from MCI to AD; 3) 
sensitivity and specificity of cognitive tests; and 4) the limited use of non-cognitive 
screening measures to capture other dimensions of neurodegeneration. The last point should 
not be minimized as other neurological domains are affected in AD and MCI (e.g., motor 
function, olfactory function). In fact, sensory deficits may prove useful in the early detection 
of dementia and may contribute to the functional decline of AD [6, 7].
Measurements of olfaction may serve as useful biomarkers of incipient dementia [6, 8, 9]. 
Olfactory deficits in AD and MCI are reliably observed in multiple olfactory domains, 
including odor detection threshold, identification, and recognition [10]. Olfactory deficits 
precede the onset of illness [11], distinguish patients with prodromal symptoms from healthy 
older adults [12, 13], and may predict which vulnerable individuals go on to develop frank 
dementia [2, 11, 12]. Impaired odor identification and detection is found in AD [14] and 
MCI amnestic type [13]. In fact, combining olfactory testing with cognitive screening (e.g., 
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) leads to improved diagnostic classification 
[14]. Moreover, a recent, prospective population-based study found olfactory impairment is 
associated with incident amnestic MCI and with progression from amnestic MCI to AD 
dementia [15]. Odor identification was also found to be superior to episodic memory deficits 
in predicting cognitive decline in cognitively intact individuals [16].
Given the cumulative evidence implicating abnormal olfactory function and structure in the 
pathogenesis of dementia, we propose that olfactory screening, when combined with well-
validated cognitive screening, can improve the clinical specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 
individuals with MCI and AD, and specifically those at highest risk for conversion to AD. 
Here, we tested the hypotheses that: 1) AD and MCI have lower odor identification scores 
than healthy older adults; 2) amnestic MCI individuals have lower odor identification scores 
than other MCI subgroups; and 3) odor identification scores improve diagnostic 
classification of individuals with MCI above and beyond cognitive screening.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subject selection
Participants were recruited from the Penn Memory Center and Clinical Core of the 
University of Pennsylvania’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center between 2005-2015. Participants 
consisted of 262 individuals with expert consensus clinical diagnoses of AD, 174 individuals 
with MCI [80 amnestic MCI single domain (aMCIsd), 70 amnestic MCI multiple domain 
(aMCImd), 24 non-amnestic (naMCI)], and 292 healthy older adults (HOA). Recruitment 
and subject assessment procedures were described previously [5]. Briefly, diagnostic 
assessments included medical history and physical and neurologic examinations conducted 
by experienced clinicians, including the review of neuroimaging, neuropsychological 
testing, and laboratory data. A consensus diagnosis was established using established 
clinical criteria for AD, MCI, or other neurologic or psychiatric conditions presenting with 
cognitive impairment [5]. All tests were administer by a trained technician or clinician.
Three subtypes of MCI are defined: 1) naMCI: those without objective memory impairment; 
2) aMCIsd: those with isolated memory impairment; and 3) aMCImd: those with 
impairments in other cognitive domains beyond memory. Amnestic individuals [17, 18], in 
particular individuals with aMCImd [19, 20], are most likely to progress AD. Subtypes of 
MCI were determined according to the Petersen criteria [21] and psychometric testing as 
described by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Dataset 
(UDS2) [22, 23]. HOA were recruited and assessed identically to the patients. Informed 
consent was obtained from all persons, in accord with University of Pennsylvania 
institutional review board.
Cognitive screening for dementia
Most, but not all, participants completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [24]. 
In the case of missing MoCA scores, but a valid MMSE score, MoCA scores were generated 
using the previously published MMSE to MoCA conversion [5]. MoCA scores can range 
from 0-30 and mean MoCA scores are presented for each diagnostic group in Table 1. 
Typically, the MoCA takes 10-15 minutes to administer. We acknowledge that this can be a 
significant burden on the clinician. Thus, we recently published a valid brief version of the 
MoCA, called the s-MoCA [25]. This brief version is 8 questions long and takes 
approximately 5 minutes to administer.
Olfactory testing
Olfaction was measured using the Sniffin’ Sticks Odor Identification Test (SS-OIT) [26]. 
The SS-OIT is a commercially available test with highly reproducible results [27]. During 
this task, the subject is presented with 16 odors via felt-tipped pen dispensers. For each odor, 
the subject is asked to identify the odor from four given choices. SS-OIT scores can range 
from 0-16 and mean SS-OIT scores are presented for each diagnostic group in Table 1. 
Administration of the SS-OIT takes between 5-8 minutes.

 Statistical analyses
Demographic characteristics were compared across diagnostic groups using Pearson χ2 or 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs) with post-hoc t-tests. Odor identification across 
diagnostic groups was evaluated using a one-way ANOVA with sex, race, education years, 
and age included in the model. Post-hoc t-tests were performed and were corrected for 
unequal variance using the Welch approximation. Pearson correlation coefficients were 
calculated for the overall sample, and each diagnostic subsample, to show the relationship 
between MoCA score and the SS-OIT. Statistical significance was defined as an alpha level 
less than 0.05.
Overall accuracy of the SS-OIT to differentiate diagnoses was assessed using the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) was also 
determined for the SS-OIT. Classification accuracy of the MoCA and SS-OIT was calculated 
by establishing a cut-off score for each measure that best differentiated diagnostic group, 
determined using the Youden Index [28], which maximizes the tradeoffs between sensitivity 
and specificity. This cut-off was then applied to the data to obtain diagnostic classification 
accuracy.
We used a two-stage analysis to determine if SS-OIT improved diagnostic accuracy above 
and beyond the MoCA. In Stage 1, the previously generated MoCA cut-off scores from 
Roalf et al. [5] were used to differentiate AD from HOA (MoCA = 23); AD from MCI 
(MoCA = 19), including all subtypes; and MCI from HOA (MoCA = 25). Individuals 
incorrectly classified by their MoCA scores were then identified. In Stage 2, the olfactory 
cut-off score generated using the SS-OIT was then applied to individuals misclassified by 
their MoCA score and diagnostic classification was determined on this subset. All correctly 
identified individuals (true positive or true negative using either MoCA or SS-OIT) are 
reported. Multinomial ROC analyses and Delong’s tests for two ROC curves were used to 
compare overall models. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.0.2) 
software.
RESULTS
Participant characteristics
Participant characteristics are displayed by diagnosis (AD, MCI, HOA) in Table 1A. Groups 
differed by age [F(2,433.5)=17.46, p < 0.0001], years of education [F(2,413.3)=13.36, p < 
0.0001], sex [χ2 = 13.01, p = 0.001], and race [χ2 = 32.39, p < 0.0001]. Group specific 
comparisons are detailed in Table 1A and in the Supplementary Material.
Olfactory performance in AD, MCI, and HOA
Odor identification (SS-OIT) differed between diagnostic groups [F = 230.1, p < 0.0001], 
after controlling for sex, race, age, and education (Fig. 1A). SS-OIT performance was better 
in HOA relative to MCI [t(295.2)=8.60, p < 0.0001] and AD [t(473.7)=17.72, p < 0.0001]. 
SS-OIT performance was better in MCI as compared to AD [t(383.4)=6.46, p < 0.0001]. 
There was a significant, but small correlation between MoCA and SS-OIT in HOA [r = 0.14,

 n = 292, p = 0.013], AD individuals [r = 0.30, n = 230, p < 0.0001], and MCI individuals [r 
= 0.16, n = 109, p = 0.03].
Olfactory performance in MCI subgroupings
Performance across MCI subgroups was measured in an exploratory analysis. Participant 
characteristics of MCI individuals are displayed by diagnostic subgroup (aMCImd, aMCIsd, 
naMCI) in Table 1B. naMCI attained higher education than aMCImd [t(47.3)=2.37, p < 
0.022].
MCI subgroups did not differ in MoCA score. aMCIsd had higher SS-OIT than aMCImd 
[t(147.6)=2.31, p < 0.023] (Fig. 1B). naMCI performance was intermediate between aMCIsd 
and aMCImd, and did not statistically differ from either. MoCA and SS-OIT performance 
was correlated in aMCIsd [r = 0.24, n = 80, p = 0.031], but not naMCI [r = 0.07, n = 24, p = 
0.74] or aMCImd [r = 0.07, n = 70, p = 0.55].
ROC analyses of odor identification
Diagnostic classification using odor identification scores alone—ROC analyses 
were performed using the SS-OIT to determine optimal cut-off scores for diagnostic 
classification accuracy (Fig. 2). SS-OIT best differentiated AD from HOA individuals [AUC 
= 0.855], then HOA from MCI [AUC = 0.731], and then MCI from AD individuals [AUC = 
0.67]. Details are presented in Fig. 2E.
Multinomial ROC analysis—Overall, using both MoCA and SS-OIT to classify 
individuals was significantly better for differentiating MCI from HOA [Z = 2.65, p = 0.008], 
marginally better for differentiating AD from HOA [Z = 1.90, p = 0.057], but no better than 
the MoCA alone for differentiating AD from MCI [Z = 1.46, p = 0.143]. Details are 
presented in Fig. 2E.
Diagnostic classification combining MoCA and odor identification scores—In 
practice, diagnostic cut-off scores are more useful than continuous scores. Thus, we used 
previously established cut-off scores [5] for the MoCA and the newly derived SS-OIT (see 
above) cut-offs to determine the percent improvement of diagnostic classification when the 
SS-OIT is used to complement the MoCA (Fig. 3 & Supplementary Material).
AD versus HOA—The use of both the MoCA and SS-OIT cut-off scores resulted in 
correct classification of 96% of AD and 99% of healthy individuals (Fig. 3A), an 
improvement of 1% and 8% over the MoCA alone, respectively.
MCI versus HOA—The use of both the MoCA and SS-OIT resulted in correct 
classification of 87% of MCI and 95% of healthy individuals (Fig. 3B), an improvement of 
12% and 17% over the MoCA alone, respectively.
MCI versus AD—The use of both the MoCA and SS-OIT resulted in correct classification 
of 89.1% of MCI and 85% of AD individuals (Fig. 3 C), an improvement of 9.8% and 14% 
over the MoCA alone, respectively.

 MCI subtypes—The MoCA had moderate classification accuracy for differentiating MCI 
subgroups from HOA, misclassifying 23.8% (19 of 80) aMCIsd, 18.6% (13 of 70) aMCImd, 
and 46% (11 of 24) naMCI. Subsequent use of SS-OIT scores correctly classified 31.6% (6 
of 19) aMCIsd, 69.2% (9 of 13) aMCImd, and 45.6% (5 of 11) naMCI. Thus, the use of both 
the MoCA and SS-OIT resulted in correct classification of 84% aMCIsd, 94% aMCImd and 
75% naMCI (Fig. 3D), an improvement of 8%, 13%, and 21%, respectively.
Olfactory screening in healthy older adults with worrisome MoCA scores—We 
considered, in an exploratory manner, that HOAs with worrisome MoCA scores might 
exhibit more olfactory deficits than those with no appreciable MoCA deficits. Thus, we 
determined the odor identification scores of HOA with MoCA scores at or above the 
reported MCI versus HOA cut-off (25). Normal MoCA performers were grouped in High 
(29-30), Middle (27-28), and Low (25-26) performers. The overall effect of MoCA 
performance group on odor identification was significant [F(2,225)=3.056, p < 0.05]. 
Pairwise comparisons indicated that High MoCA performers [mean(sd): 13.38 (1.63), n = 
44] had significantly better SS-OIT score than Middle MoCA [mean(sd): 12.27 (2.54), n = 
96; p = 0.04)]performers and marginally better performance than Low MoCA performers 
[mean(sd): 12.53 (2.76), n = 88; p = 0.09]. Furthermore, more Low and Middle MoCA 
performers performed below the SS-OIT cut-off score of 11 : 16% of Low MoCA 
individuals, 20% of Middle MoCA individuals, but only 7% of High MoCA individuals 
performed below this score (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we report clinically useful cut-offs for a popular, simple-to-administer odor 
identification test; and we confirm recent reports of the utility of odor identification as a 
useful marker for incipient dementia that should be used for clinical screening in 
conjunction with traditional cognitive screening. In a clinically ascertained sample, poorer 
odor identification performance was associated with AD and MCI, particularly in the 
amnestic multiple domain subtype of MCI. Odor identification alone was a significant 
predictor of clinical status. When combined with the MoCA—a common screen of global 
cognitive functioning—identification of individuals with AD and MCI improved 
significantly. Determination and use of clinically valid cut-off scores for the SS-OIT indicate 
that using this psychophysical olfactory test as a supplementary measure to the MoCA 
improves diagnostic accuracy in incipient dementia, particularly in patients with aMCImd 
subtype, those most likely to transition to AD dementia.
We confirm previous work indicating olfactory impairment is a regular feature of AD 
dementia and MCI [13, 16]. Notably, we extend these findings by providing useful clinical 
cut-offs for the SS-OIT. SS-OIT scores below 10 were indicative of AD as compared to 
HOA, scores under 11 were associated with MCI as compared to HOA, while scores below 
9 were indicative of AD as compared to MCI. However, olfactory scores alone were not as 
robust as the MoCA for clinical categorization. Given the small range of cut-off scores 
between frank dementia and MCI, the prodromal stage of AD, we used odor identification 
scores as a supplementary screening measure to the MoCA. Multinomial analyses indicated 
improved clinical classification when olfactory scores were considered with MoCA scores,

 an effect that was more robust in MCI than AD. The minimal correlation between SS-OIT 
and MoCA scores argues that each of these tests is tapping unique variance in these 
disorders, and the improvement in clinical classification bolsters support for the addition of 
olfactory testing as a screening measure. That is, it appears that the use of a supplemental 
olfactory assessment can hone in on a comorbid sensory deficit that goes undetected with the 
use of traditional cognitive screening measures. Importantly, olfactory screening is routine 
[29], reliable [30], and quick and easy to administer [31]. Moreover, our findings are 
consistent with recent work by Devanand et al. [16] suggesting superiority of olfactory 
testing over an episodic verbal memory test in predicting cognitive decline. Finally, our 
findings corroborate those of Velayudhan et al. [14] who report a 10% increase in diagnostic 
accuracy of AD versus HOA when using both the University of Pennsylvania Smell 
Identification Test (UPSIT) and the MMSE.
More specifically, our use of derived clinical cut-off scores for the MoCA and SS-OIT 
significantly improved both sensitivity and specificity. In the comparison of AD and HOA, a 
large number of HOA individuals misclassified by MoCA scores were correctly identified 
by SS-OIT scores, but relatively few AD patients were reclassified using the supplementary 
SS-OIT score. In the comparison of MCI and HOA, more MCI and HOA individuals were 
subsequently reclassified correctly after considering their olfactory scores. When 
differentiating MCI and AD, a moderate number of MCI and AD individuals were 
subsequently reclassified correctly after considering their olfactory scores. Importantly, we 
also find that HOAs with imperfect cognitive screening scores are more likely to exhibit 
olfactory deficits. This further underscores the potential utility of olfactory testing in the 
screening of individuals at potential risk very early on for developing dementia. As 
suggested by Roberts et al. [15], we show that the combination of olfactory and cognitive 
testing is useful in screening individuals for early cognitive decline that may lead to AD.
The heterogeneity of MCI makes early identification difficult. To this effect, understanding 
the disease course of distinct MCI subtypes may aid in early identification of those at 
highest risk for developing AD compared to those for whom stability is predicted. Not only 
do we find olfactory impairment in the general MCI cohort, we find significantly more 
impairment in individuals with amnestic multiple domain MCI as compared to those with 
MCI amnestic single domain. This deficit is consistent with prior findings in the literature 
[13, 15] and suggests that when the disease burden includes other domains beyond memory, 
the relevance of odor identification deficits increases. Moreover, this suggests a distributed 
neuropathological state in those where deficits extend to multiple domains and is in 
agreement with studies finding higher conversion rate to AD in this MCI subtype [32, 33].
Our use of derived clinical cut-off scores for SS-OIT to correctly classify individuals 
misclassified by MoCA scores improved classification of all MCI subgroups. In the 
comparison of MCI subgroups, a higher percentage of aMCImd individuals were 
subsequently reclassified correctly after considering their olfactory scores. This suggests that 
utilizing SS-OIT cut-off scores as a supplement to MoCA is most useful as a clinical tool for 
those at highest risk for converting to AD. Olfactory deficits were similar between a small 
sample of non-amnestic and single and multiple domain amnestic individuals in agreement 
with limited previous work [13, 34], further indicating that MCI is etiologically a

 heterogeneous group. Finally, longitudinal studies with larger samples should further 
examine olfactory ability within this subtype. Deficits in olfactory performance denote 
fundamental neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic abnormalities that are specific to the 
peripheral olfactory system [8, 35], olfactory bulb and/or primary olfactory cortices [36]. 
Olfactory dysfunction is correlated with the global level of AD pathology on postmortem 
examination [1], biopsy of the olfactory epithelium indicates the presence of AD pathology 
(e.g., amyloid-β, tau) in pathologically verified AD patients [37], and the presence of tau 
protein has been reported in nasal secretions of AD individuals with olfactory deficits [38]. 
Finally, poorer olfactory ability is associated with structural brain changes in the 
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, two regions prominently affected in early stages of AD 
[39–41]. Thus, the olfactory deficits in AD may arise throughout the olfactory system. 
Additional work remains necessary to elucidate the sequential neurobiological mechanisms 
responsible for olfactory deficits in MCI and AD dementia.
We note a few limitations to the current study. First, as is common among olfactory studies, 
only odor identification was measured. Other studies have identified deficits in odor 
detection threshold and odor recognition memory in MCI [9, 42], and the utility of these 
measures of olfactory functioning also warrant further investigation. The study also only 
utilized one form of odor identification testing, the SS-OIT; however, this test is a reliable 
clinical assessment tool with large normative basis [30] that can be performed quickly given 
the few number of items. We acknowledge that there is the need for adequate and effective 
cognitive and sensory screening given the rapid growth of the elderly population. As such, 
adding additional tests comes at some time cost to clinicians. Here we report data from both 
the full MoCA and SS-OIT, which in total, take between 15-25 minutes. However, we 
recently published a short version of the MoCA (s-MoCA) that only takes 5 minutes to 
administer [25]. Additionally, short, nonforced choice versions of the SS-OIT are available 
and validated for clinical use; however, more work needs to be done to validate this in AD 
and MCI samples. Furthermore, similar results are found utilizing the B-SIT [15], UPSIT 
[8], and the Motol Hospital Smell Test [13]. The cross-sectional design of the study did not 
allow us to make precise conclusions about the conversion and disease trajectory of our MCI 
patients; however, follow-up studies are planned. ROC classification analyses were not 
performed in the MCI subtypes due to relatively small sample sizes.
We conclude that odor identification deficits are evident in AD and MCI subtypes. 
Importantly, the SS-OIT is a useful classification tool for MCI, and more specifically 
aMCImd, when used in conjunction with the MoCA.

Classification accuracy of MoCA and SS-OIT scores by diagnosis. The bottom portion of 
each bar represents the number of individuals correctly classified by the optimal MoCA 
score (M). The middle portion of each bar indicates the number of individuals that were 
misidentified by MoCA score, but correctly identified by SS-OIT score (O). The top portion 
of each bar represents the number of individuals misidentified by both MoCA and SS-OIT 
score (X).

likely to perform poorly on odor identification.

††HOA, MCI, and AD: HOA and MCI were younger and attained higher levels of education than AD. The proportion of females was higher in the 
HOA than in the MCI group. HOA, AD, and MCI groups included more Caucasians than African Americans and more African Americans than 
other races. As expected, there were systematic group differences in overall neuropsychological function and clinical ratings: CERAD-NB, MoCA, 
CDR, FRS, and GDS. In addition, the CDR, FRS, and GDS were administered to many individuals.
