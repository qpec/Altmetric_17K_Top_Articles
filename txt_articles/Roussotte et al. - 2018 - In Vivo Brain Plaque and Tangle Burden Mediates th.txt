Objective: Growing evidence supports an association between increased blood pres-
sure and:(a) poor cognitive performance in older adults, and (b) various biomarkers
of increased Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology.The objective of this study was
to determine whether systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
were significantly associated with cognitive functioning in non-demented adults, and
to examine in vivo AD pathology as a possible mediator of this association. Methods:
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans with 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)
amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) provide in vivo measure-
ments of plaque and tangle burden.A total of 101 non-demented older subjects with
blood pressure data and FDDNP-PET scans were drawn from a larger study of pre-
dictors of cognitive decline. A neuropsychological test battery was used to compute
“global cognitive scores”(averaged across five key domains), which served as an index
of general cognitive functioning. Results: Higher DBP (but not SBP) was signifi-
cantly associated with lower cognitive scores, controlling for age, sex, antihypertensive
medication use, and ApoE genotype (η2 = 0.06). However, this relationship was no
longer significant after introducing FDDNP-PET binding as an additional covariate
in the statistical models. In vivo plaque and tangle burden accounted for over 30%
of the observed association between higher DBP and poorer cognitive performance.
Conclusions: By suggesting a mediation of the relationship between DBP and cog-
nitive functioning by FDDNP-PET binding, this study advances our understanding of
some potential predictors of cognitive decline in non-demented adults, and under-
scores the importance of devising early multimodal interventions to more effectively
combat degenerative brain disorders. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2017; ■■:■■–■■)

Article Highlights
• Diastolic (but not systolic) blood pressure is significantly associated with cognitive
functioning in nondemented middle-aged and older adults.
• Higher diastolic blood pressure is associated with poorer cognitive performance, in-
dependently of age, sex, use of antihypertensive medications, and ApoE genotype.
• This association is no longer significant after introducing FDDNP-PET binding as an
additional covariate in the statistical models.
• The relationship between higher diastolic blood pressure and poorer cognitive per-
formance may be mediated by increased in vivo plaque and tangle burden.
INTRODUCTION
Epidemiologic and clinicopathologic data demon-
strate considerable overlap between cerebrovascular
disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) and indicate that
vascular and AD-type pathologies are leading causes
of cognitive impairment in the elderly.1 The main neu-
ropathologic hallmarks of AD are senile plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles. β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides can
aggregate to form insoluble fibers that are resistant to
degradation. Plaques result from the accumulation of
amyloid fibrils between neurons, whereas tangles are
intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau
protein. Human autopsy studies indicate that plaques
and tangles accumulate in a predictable spatial pattern
in aging and AD.2,3 These changes may begin before
age 304 and gradually increase in prevalence with
age.
Recently developed positron emission tomogra-
phy (PET) ligands allow in vivo measurement of AD
pathology in the brain. Notably, our group devel-
oped a small molecule, 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)
(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononi-
trile (FDDNP), for use as an in vivo chemical marker
of cerebral aggregates of Aβ and tau proteins.4 FDDNP-
PET is the first and only method to provide a measure
of both plaque and tangle binding levels in the living
human brain, and the in vivo distribution of FDDNP
in the brain follows patterns of plaque and tangle dis-
tribution seen at autopsy.5
Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
have demonstrated associations between vascular
pathology6–8 and cognitive decline and indicated syn-
ergistic relationships between Aβ burden and
cerebrovascular disease on cognitive impairment.9 Con-
tributors to vascular risk, such as diabetes,10 smoking
status,11 and hyperhomocysteinemia12 have been as-
sociated with cognitive deficits and elevated risk of
developing dementia. Converging evidence from
autopsy, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid
biomarker studies indicates that vascular and AD-
type pathologies exert additive or synergistic effects
on cognitive decline, but the relationships between in-
dividual vascular factors and plaque/tangle burden
remain unclear.1
Although early reports found no relationship
between blood pressure and cognitive functioning,13,14
growing evidence supports an association between in-
creased
blood
pressure
and
lower
cognitive
performance in older adults.15 Recent studies also
suggest a link between elevated blood pressure and
various biomarkers of increased plaque and tangle
load.16 However, to our knowledge, no previous study
has examined in vivo AD pathology as a potential me-
diator of the association between blood pressure and
cognitive performance in pre-dementia states.
To address this knowledge gap, we first deter-
mined whether systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly as-
sociated with cognitive functioning in our sample of
101 nondemented middle-aged and older adults, con-
trolling for age, sex, use of antihypertensive
medications, and ApoE genotype. We also tested the
hypothesis that our cross-sectional study may point to
in vivo plaque and tangle burden as a possible medi-
ator of the relationship between higher DBP and poorer
cognitive functioning.

Increased Blood Pressure and Poor Cognitive Performance in Older Adults
 METHODS
Subjects
A total of 101 nondemented subjects who had com-
plete neuropsychological testing, blood pressure data,
and FDDNP-PET scans were drawn from a larger study
of predictors of cognitive decline.17,18 Data were col-
lected between September 1998 and February 2016.
Briefly, volunteers from the community were re-
cruited through advertisements, media coverage of the
study, and referrals by physicians and families.
Members of the research staff screened potential vol-
unteers via telephone interviews. All subjects
underwent FDDNP-PET scans and clinical and cog-
nitive assessments performed blinded to the results of
FDDNP-PET scans. Written informed consent was ob-
tained in accordance with the University of California,
Los Angeles Human Subjects Protection Committee
procedures. Cumulative radiation dosimetry for all
scans was below the mandated maximum annual dose
and in compliance with state and federal regulations.
Exclusion criteria included MRI intolerance, evi-
dence of stroke or brain tumor on MRI, traumatic brain
injury, cognitively altering medications, and exces-
sive head motion during scanning. For the purpose of
the current study, which focused on nondemented
adults, participants with a diagnosis of AD or other
dementias were also excluded, leaving a total of 101
nondemented subjects for the current analyses.
Neuropsychological Testing
A neuropsychological test battery was adminis-
tered to assess five specific cognitive domains: (1)
memory, which included the Wechsler Memory Scale,
Third Edition logical memory (delayed score), Buschke
selective reminding (total score), and Rey-Osterrieth
complex figure recall (3-minute delayed recall score);
(2) language, which included the Boston naming test,
and letter (F.A.S.) and category (Animal naming test)
fluency; (3) attention and information-processing speed,
which included the Trail-Making Task A, Stroop Color
Naming (Kaplan version), and Wechsler Adult Intel-
ligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) digit symbol;
(4) executive functioning, which included the Trail-
Making Task B and Stroop Interference (Kaplan
version); and (5) visuospatial ability, which included
the WAIS-III block design and Rey-Osterrieth complex
figure copy. We converted raw test scores to z scores
by standardizing them to a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1. We computed domain z scores by av-
eraging those z scores belonging to the cognitive tests
in that domain. Because this study focused on partici-
pants’ overall cognitive functioning and its association
with blood pressure measures (in the absence of a priori
hypotheses about specific cognitive domains), we ob-
tained global cognitive scores by averaging the five
domain z scores.
Demographic, Blood Pressure, and Genetic Data
During study intake for each subject, gender and age
were recorded and medical history obtained to deter-
mine use of antihypertensive medications. Right arm
blood pressure was measured once by a registered
nurse with the subject seated, following standard clin-
ical protocols. In most cases, a single blood pressure
measurement was recorded. However, for partici-
pants who expressed that an activity or emotional state
was affecting them or if a significantly abnormal blood
pressure (per subject report) was measured, partici-
pants were requested to rest for at least several minutes
before another reading was obtained. In these in-
stances only the second measurement was recorded.
All DNA was obtained from blood samples. The ApoE
genotypes were determined using standard tech-
niques as previously described.19
Imaging Methods
Global plaque and tangle load from an FDDNP-
PET scan was the single pathology score used for each
subject in this study. Global FDDNP-PET binding was
calculated by averaging the load from five brain regions
of interest (ROIs) known to accumulate pathology in
AD (medial temporal, lateral temporal, posterior cin-
gulate, parietal, and frontal cortices). Global load was
the average over all ROIs.
FDDNP was prepared at very high specific activi-
ties (>37 GBq/mol), as described in detail elsewhere.20
All scans were performed with the ECAT HR or
EXACT HR + tomograph (Siemens-CTI, Knoxville,
TN) with subjects supine and the imaging plane
parallel to the orbitomeatal line. A bolus of FDDNP
(320–550 MBq) was injected via an indwelling venous
catheter, and consecutive dynamic PET scans were

 performed for 2 hours. Scans were decay corrected
and reconstructed using filtered back-projection (Hann
filter, 5.5-mm full width at half maximum) with
scatter and measured attenuation correction. The re-
sulting images contained 47 contiguous slices with
plane separation of 3.37 mm (ECAT HR) or 63 contig-
uous slices with plane separation of 2.42 mm (EXACT
HR+). Determinations of data reproducibility were
performed when the new scanner was introduced in
the Nuclear Medicine clinic using phantoms and
comparing results between scanners. Nonparametric
Wilcoxon two-sample tests found no significant dif-
ferences in regional FDDNP signals between the two
PET scanners.
All subjects received MRI scans that were co-
registered to PET scans for determination of ROIs.
These anatomic brain scans were obtained using either
a 1.5-T or 3-T magnet (General Electric-Signa, Milwau-
kee, WI) scanner. Fifty-four transverse planes were
collected throughout the brain, superior to the cere-
bellum, using a double-echo, fast-spin echo series with
a 24-cm field of view and 256 × 256 matrix with
3 mm/0 gap (TR = 6000 [3 T] and 2000 [1.5 T]; TE = 17/
85 [3 T] and 30/90 [1.5 T]). Rules for ROI drawing were
based on the identification of gyral and sulcal land-
marks with respect to the atlas of Talairach and
Tournoux.21 All PET and MRI scans were read, and the
ROIs were drawn by investigators blind to clinical as-
sessments. Previous inter-rater reliability studies have
confirmed high consistency and reliability using this
method.22
FDDNP-PET binding levels were quantified as pre-
viously described.17 Briefly, we performed Logan
graphical analysis with the cerebellum as the refer-
ence region for time points between 30 and 125
minutes.23 The slope of the linear portion of the Logan
plot is the relative distribution volume (DVR), which
is equal to the distribution volume of the tracer in an
ROI divided by that in the reference region. We gen-
erated DVR parametric images and analyzed them
using gray matter ROIs drawn manually on the
FDDNP-PET image obtained in the first 5 minutes after
injection (the perfusion image). This image shows the
perfusion pattern and has sufficient anatomic infor-
mation to identify the cerebellum and cerebellar gray
matter. ROIs were drawn bilaterally on the medial tem-
poral
(containing
limbic
regions,
including
hippocampus, parahippocampal, and entorhinal areas),
lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal,
and cerebellar regions, as previously described.24 Each
cerebral regional DVR or binding value was expressed
as an average of left and right regions, and global DVR
values were calculated as averages of the values for all
these regions.
Statistical Analyses
Data were screened for outliers, whose values may
fall beyond 2.5 standard deviations from the mean,
for all variables included in these analyses. We used
general linear models to examine associations between
blood pressure and global cognitive scores in our
sample of 101 nondemented middle-aged and older
adults. Separate general linear models were used to
determine if SBP and DBP were significantly associ-
ated with global cognitive scores, controlling for
age, sex, use of antihypertensive medications, and
ApoE genotype, and whether these associations re-
mained significant after including global FDDNP-
PET binding as an additional covariate in the statistical
models.
Simple mediation analyses were conducted using
Andrew Hayes’s PROCESS Procedure (v2.15) for SPSS
23.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). We obtained path co-
efficients (a, b, c, and c′) representing the linear
regression coefficients for each path in the mediation
model. We standardized all variables to facilitate the
interpretation of path coefficients, now bounded by −1
and 1 across all measures. The a-path represents the
association between the predictor and mediator vari-
ables. The b-path denotes the relationship between the
mediator and outcome variables, while also control-
ling for the predictor variable. The c′-path (also called
“direct effect”) and the c-path (also known as “total
effect”) represent the associations between the pre-
dictor and outcome variables including and excluding
the mediator variable, respectively. If the difference
between c and c′ is statistically significant, then there
is a significant mediation effect. It has been shown that
a × b = c - c’;25 therefore, we tested the significance of
a × b (also known as “indirect effect”) using
bootstrapped confidence intervals with 1,000 simu-
lated samples.26 If the 95% confidence interval for a × b
does not include 0 and the association between the pre-
dictor and outcome variables including the mediator
variable (i.e., the c′-path) is no longer significant, then
a significant (p < 0.05) mediation has occurred. We used
percent mediation as a measure of effect size.27,28

Increased Blood Pressure and Poor Cognitive Performance in Older Adults
 RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the
Sample
This cohort of nondemented middle-aged and older
adults included a higher proportion of women (55%)
(Table 1). Most participants (80%) were not under an-
tihypertensive therapy at time of the study. Forty-
five subjects carried at least one ApoE-ε4 allele (45%).
All continuous variables examined in this study ap-
peared to be normally distributed. All individual values
fell within 2.5 standard deviations from the mean for
all variables included in these analyses. Descriptive sta-
tistics are provided in Table 1.
Associations Between Blood Pressure and
Cognitive Functioning
Multiple regression analyses revealed that higher SBP
was not significantly associated with lower global cog-
nitive scores, when controlling for age, sex, ApoE
genotype, and blood pressure medication status.
F-statistics followed by degrees of freedom in paren-
theses and p-values for all variables in the models are
reported in Table 2. Similar results were observed when
global FDDNP-PET binding was included as an addi-
tional covariate in the statistical models (Table 2). Unlike
SBP
, higher DBP was significantly associated with lower
global cognitive scores, controlling for age, sex, ApoE
genotype, and blood pressure medication status
(Table 2). The partial eta-squared (η2 = 0.06) suggested
a small to medium effect size. However, this associa-
tion was no longer significant after introducing global
FDDNP-PET binding as an additional regressor
(Table 2). In this model, higher global FDDNP-PET
binding showed a significant association of moderate
effect size (η2 = 0.07) with lower global cognitive scores,

 suggesting that the relationship between higher DBP and
poorer cognitive performance may be mediated by in-
creased plaque and tangle load.
Mediation Analyses
Further analyses confirmed a statistical non-
independence of effects. We observed a statistical
mediation of the association between higher DBP and
poorer cognitive functioning by increased in vivo plaque
and tangle burden. Our results were consistent with
a mediational model and revealed a significant indi-
rect effect of DBP on global cognitive scores through
global FDDNP-PET binding, with age, sex, blood pres-
sure medication status, and ApoE genotype included
as covariates (a × b = −0.06). The association between
DBP and cognitive functioning with global FDDNP-
PET binding included as a mediator (i.e., the c′-path)
was no longer significant. The mediator accounted for
about 31% of the total effect (Figure 1, Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This report provides evidence that DBP (but not SBP)
is significantly associated with global cognitive
functioning, independently of age, sex, use of antihy-
pertensive medications, and ApoE genotype in middle-
aged and older adults without dementia. For the first
time in this study, we also address a possible mech-
anism through which DBP affects cognitive decline in
this population. Notably, our results suggest that in-
creased in vivo plaque and tangle load may mediate
the association between higher DBP and poorer cog-
nitive performance, controlling for age, sex, blood
pressure medication status, and ApoE genotype, in
nondemented middle-aged and older adults.
Our findings that, unlike DBP, SBP is not signifi-
cantly associated with general cognitive functioning
in our study sample are consistent with those from
three earlier reports29–31 but are discordant with find-
ings from two prior studies, which reported that higher
SBP (and not DBP) were related to cognitive decline.32,33
Demographic and clinical differences between study
samples, varying measures of cognitive functioning,
and a range of covariates included in the statistical
models may account for these discrepant results. Al-
though the relationships between blood pressure and
cognitive outcomes are intricate and still debated,34 two
longitudinal studies in very large multiethnic samples
support long-term associations between elevated DBP35
and SBP in midlife36 and cognitive impairment in old
age.
Our analyses revealed a statistical mediation of the
relationship between higher DBP and poorer cogni-
tive performance by increased in vivo plaque and tangle
burden in our study sample, consistent with pub-
lished autopsy reports, which have provided strong
evidence for an association between higher blood pres-
sure and increased AD pathology. An early study
showed that nondemented individuals with high blood
pressure had increased incidence of both senile plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting that “hyper-
tension may be a neuropathologic forerunner to
AD.” (p. 167)37 Of particular relevance to the present
study, another neuropathology report found that higher
DBP in midlife was associated with greater numbers
of tau tangles in the hippocampus at autopsy.38

higher DBP and increased in vivo plaque and tangle

 burden are consistent with some earlier reports but con-
tradict other prior studies. One Pittsburgh Compound
B–PET study (PIB-PET)– an imaging method that pro-
vides a measure of in vivo Aβburden – reported an
association between higher DBP (but not SBP) and
more pronounced Aβ deposition in elderly subjects.39
On the other hand, another PIB-PET study found a pos-
itive correlation between SBP (but not DBP) and Aβ
burden in healthy late middle-aged adults.40 Like-
wise, while a study showed that DBP was correlated
with plasma levels of Aβ in older adults,41 other reports
(which classified very elderly participants as Aβ-
positive or Aβ-negative based on PIB-PET imaging)
found that SBP (but not DBP) was associated with Aβ
status at baseline,42 and that neither measure was higher
among Aβ-positive subjects at 2-year follow-up.43 These
discrepancies probably relate to the vast methodolog-
ical differences between studies, including the
demographic and clinical characteristics of the samples,
the use of amyloid-specific or non-specific probes, con-
tinuous versus dichotomous measures of Aβ pathology,
and the tissues examined (i.e., plasma or brain). None-
theless, the extant literature illustrates the complexity
and scope of existing knowledge in this area.
Despite the fact that we did not measure vascular
pathology in this sample, the present findings suggest
a direct relationship between DBP and the in vivo dis-
tribution of FDDNP in the brain, which, as we
previously demonstrated, follows the patterns of plaque
and tangle distribution seen at autopsy.5 Prior studies
have proposed that higher DBP may be associated with
compromised vascular integrity, resulting in im-
paired Aβ clearance and increased phosphorylation of
tau,38,44 which may provide a possible explanation for
our findings. Although the precise mechanisms un-
derlying these associations remain unclear, some
studies have elucidated a few of the mechanistic links
between impaired vascular integrity and AD pathol-
ogy. Notably, a review of the literature indicates that
vascular injury reduces Aβ clearance at the blood–
brain barrier and increases Aβ production from Aβ
precursor protein, leading to Aβ accumulation. This ac-
cumulation in turn amplifies neuronal dysfunction,
accelerates neurodegeneration, and can induce

Notes: In the “Model Summary” column, F-statistics are followed by degrees of freedom in parentheses. In the “Path Coefficient” column,
t-statistics are followed by degrees of freedom in parentheses. Path coefficients (denoted by “b”) are provided for all four paths in the simple
mediation analysis using the PROCESS Procedure for SPSS.
The a-path represents the association between DBP and global FDDNP-PET binding (controlling for age, sex, blood pressure medication
status, and ApoE genotype). The b-path denotes the relationship between global FDDNP-PET binding and global cognitive scores, while
also controlling for DBP (in addition to age, sex, blood pressure medication status, and ApoE genotype). The c’-path and the c-path repre-
sent the associations between DBP and global cognitive performance (controlling for age, sex, blood pressure medication status, and ApoE
genotype) with and without global FDDNP-PET binding included as a mediator, respectively. As a × b = c - c’, the 95% confidence interval
for a × b indicates that a significant medication has occurred when it does not include 0 and the c′-path is no longer significant. Percent me-
diation is a measure of effect size computed as (a × b)/(c′ + a × b).

 hyperphosphorylation of tau, leading to neurofibril-
lary tangle formation.45
We found that DBP was significantly associated with
cognitive functioning, controlling for blood pressure
medication status. Nonetheless, the identification of
global FDDNP-PET binding as a possible mediator of
the relationship between higher DBP and poorer cog-
nitive performance in nondemented middle-aged and
older adults highlights the need for additional re-
search into pharmacologic and behavioral interventions
aimed at controlling blood pressure and/or reduc-
ing plaque and tangle burden early in life. Although
some studies have shown that blood pressure control
in middle-aged adults may help delay or stop the pro-
gression of cognitive decline in the elderly,46 results from
randomized trials of antihypertensive therapy for the
prevention of dementia remain inconclusive.16 Similar
discrepancies exist in the postmortem literature, with
conflicting reports about the effects of blood pres-
sure medication status on plaque and tangle
pathology.37,47 This may be because key unmeasured
genetic and/or physiologic factors may play impor-
tant roles in the effect of antihypertensive therapy on
AD pathology and cognitive functioning – future clin-
ical trials should therefore benefit from stratifying
participants accordingly. Moreover, because of its plu-
ripotent effects on the vasculature, including the
regulation of vascular tone, cerebral blood flow, en-
dothelial function, microvascular recruitment, energy
metabolism, and insulin actions on the vessel (all of
which are important for brain health), physical exer-
cise may be a promising behavioral intervention for
mitigating the association between increased blood
pressure and decreased cognitive performance.
Methodologic limitations should be noted. First, this
is a cross-sectional, observational study, which cannot
infer temporality and cannot exclude the role of re-
sidual confounding. These findings will thus need to
be replicated in independent data sets, and using lon-
gitudinal designs to establish an association between
the primary predictor and changes in the mediator,
above and beyond the effect of prior mediator values
and confounders. Moreover, we focused on systolic and
diastolic values because they are generally obtained in
standard clinical situations. In most cases, a single blood
pressure measurement was recorded. In some in-
stances, a second reading was obtained, and only the
second measurement was reported, as detailed above.
Therefore, it will be important for future studies to
include more rigorous assessments of vital signs, such
as evaluations of blood pressure measurement repro-
ducibility. Future research should also examine how
the pulsatile and steady components of blood pres-
sure (i.e., pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure)
relate to cognitive functioning and AD pathology, es-
pecially given the emerging evidence supporting an
association between pulse pressure and Aβ deposi-
tion in the aging brain.40,48 An additional limitation to
this study may be that ambulatory blood pressure mea-
surements were not recorded. Although some prior
work showed that repeated ambulatory, but not clinic-
based, SBP measures predicted cerebrovascular
pathology, the authors did not seem to include DBP
in their analyses.49 Finally, while the current
study focused on blood pressure, additional research
will be necessary to determine how other vascular
risk factors (such as diabetes, central obesity, and
hyperhomocysteinemia) interact with each other and
with plaque and tangle load to affect cognitive func-
tioning in nondemented middle-aged and older adults.
Future investigations will also benefit from the use
of innovative approaches derived from systems biology
to incorporate the roles of multiple cell types that
support the function of neural tissue, and the influ-
ence of various genetic factors into the science of
vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and AD
pathology, in order to develop more targeted and per-
sonalized treatment and prevention strategies.
Nonetheless, by suggesting that in vivo plaque and
tangle burden may mediate the association between
higher DBP and poorer cognitive functioning, this
study advances our understanding of some possible
predictors of cognitive decline in nondemented middle-
aged and older adults, and underscores the importance
of devising early multimodal interventions (e.g., com-
bining antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with Aβ or
tau inhibition) to more effectively combat degenera-
tive brain disorders.
