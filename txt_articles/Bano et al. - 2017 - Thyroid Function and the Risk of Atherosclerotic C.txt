A
therosclerosis progresses insidiously from a subclini-
cal condition to the clinical onset of vascular events to 
death.1 Despite advances in prevention and treatment, athero-
sclerotic disease remains a leading cause of death, with a con-
siderable clinical and economic burden worldwide.2 Hence, 
the identification of additional modifiable risk factors for ath-
erosclerosis is of major importance.

Thyroid function has a complex relation with various contribu-
tors to atherogenesis. Higher thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations 
have commonly been linked with systolic hypertension3,4 and hy-
percoagulation,5 whereas lower circulating TH levels can instigate 
hyperlipidemia and inflammation.6 Although atherosclerosis is a 
continuous process, prospective epidemiological studies to date 
have mainly focused on the relation between specific ranges of thy-
roid function and distinct atherosclerotic events, such as coronary 
heart disease (CHD) or stroke.7–12 Results have been inconsistent, 
including studies that find no association between thyroid function 
and atherosclerotic outcomes,8,12 as well as other studies reporting

Rationale: Thyroid hormones have been linked with various proatherogenic and antiatherogenic processes. 
However, the relationship of thyroid function with manifestations of atherosclerosis remains unclear.
Objective: To investigate the association of thyroid function with atherosclerosis throughout its spectrum; that is, 
subclinical atherosclerosis, incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular (ASCV) events, and ASCV mortality.
Methods and Results: This population-based study was embedded within the Rotterdam Study. The risk of 
atherosclerosis was evaluated by measuring (1) presence of subclinical atherosclerosis, assessed by coronary artery 
calcification score >100 AU; (2) ASCV events, defined as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, other coronary 
heart disease mortality, or stroke; (3) ASCV mortality, defined as death because of coronary heart disease and 
cerebrovascular or other atherosclerotic diseases. Associations of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine 
with the outcomes were assessed through logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for 
potential confounders, including cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 9420 community-dwelling participants 
(mean age±SD, 64.8±9.7 years) were included. During a median follow-up of 8.8 years (interquartile range, 
4.5–11.8 years), 934 incident ASCV events and 612 ASCV deaths occurred. Free thyroxine levels were positively 
associated with high coronary artery calcification score (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–4.02) and 
incident ASCV events (hazard ratio, 1.87; confidence interval, 1.34–2.59). The risk of ASCV mortality increased in 
a linear manner with higher free thyroxine levels (hazard ratio, 2.41; confidence interval, 1.68–3.47 per 1 ng/dL) 
and lower thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (hazard ratio, 0.92; confidence interval, 0.84–1.00 per 1 logTSH). 
Results remained similar or became stronger among euthyroid participants.
Conclusions: Free thyroxine levels in middle-aged and elderly subjects were positively associated with atherosclerosis 
throughout the whole disease spectrum, independent of cardiovascular risk factors.

an increased risk of atherosclerotic outcomes with either lower7,10 or 
higher thyroid function.9,11,13 Differences in study designs, follow-up 
period, and age range of participants may partly explain the incon-
sistencies across studies. In addition, these inconsistencies can also 
stem from the heterogeneity in the assessment of atherosclerosis. 
To date, a comprehensive investigation exploring the link between 
the full range of thyroid function and atherosclerosis throughout its 
spectrum, from subclinical atherosclerosis to overt atherosclerosis 
to atherosclerotic mortality, within the same cohort is lacking.
Therefore, in a large population-based cohort study of 
middle-aged and elderly individuals, we examined the asso-
ciation of thyroid function with atherosclerosis throughout its 
spectrum, including coronary artery calcification (CAC; as a 
well-documented marker of subclinical atherosclerosis),14 ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular (ASCV) events (as a measure of 
clinical atherosclerosis), and ASCV mortality.
Methods
Study Population
This study was embedded within the Rotterdam Study—a prospec-
tive population-based cohort study that investigates the determinants, 
occurrence, and progression of chronic diseases in the middle-aged 
and elderly. The objectives and study design have been described in 
detail previously.15 The Rotterdam Study was initiated in 1989, includ-
ing 7983 participants aged ≥55 years (RSI) residing in Ommoord dis-
trict of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In 2000, the study was extended 
with a second cohort of 3011 subjects (RSII). In 2006, a third cohort 
of 3932 subjects aged ≥45 years was added (RSIII). Study participants 
undergo extensive follow-up medical examinations every 3 to 5 years.
Baseline measurements for our study were performed during the 
third visit of the first cohort (n=4797) and the first visit of the sec-
ond (n=3011) and third (n=3932) cohorts of the Rotterdam Study. 
Complete data on thyroid function and incident events were available 
in 9420 participants from these visits. Detailed information on the 
selection of study participants is provided in Methods in the Online 
Data Supplement and Online Figure I.
The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the Medical Ethics 
Committee of the Erasmus University and by the Ministry of Health, 
Welfare, and Sport of The Netherlands, implementing the Population 
Study Act Rotterdam Study. All participants have given written in-
formed consent.
Assessment of Thyroid Function
Thyroid function was assessed at baseline in 3 study cohorts using 
the same method and assay. Measurements of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid peroxidase anti-
bodies (TPOAb) were performed in baseline serum samples stored 
at −80°C using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ECLIA 
Roche. The reference ranges of serum TSH (0.40–4.0 mIU/L) and 
serum FT4 (0.86–1.94 ng/dL; equivalent to 11–25 pmol/L) were 
determined based on national guidelines and our previous studies.16
Assessment of CAC, ASCV Events, and ASCV 
Mortality
The risk of atherosclerosis was evaluated by measuring CAC, ASCV 
events, and ASCV mortality. Hard outcomes were included to avoid 
misclassification bias.
CAC measurements were performed at baseline in a random sample 
of 1999 participants, during the third visit of the first cohort and the first 
visit of the second cohort. CAC was measured by electron beam computed 
tomographic scans (C-150 Imatron GE) of the coronary arteries.15 CAC 
score of ≥100 AU suggests clinically significant atherosclerotic plaque2 
and has been used in past consensus statements.17 Therefore, we grouped 
participants into CAC score <100 AU and CAC score of ≥100 AU.
ASCV events were defined as fatal and nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, other CHD mortality, or stroke, as described previous-
ly.18 Prevalent ASCV disease was defined as history of myocardial

Novelty and Significance
What Is Known?
• Atherosclerosis progresses from a subclinical condition to the clinical 
onset of vascular events to death.
• Previous studies have mainly investigated the association between 
thyroid function and distinct atherosclerotic events, with inconsistent 
results.
What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
• This study investigated the relationship of thyroid function with athero-
sclerosis throughout its spectrum, from subclinical atherosclerosis to 
atherosclerotic events to atherosclerotic mortality.
• Higher circulating free thyroxine levels were associated with an in-
creased risk of subclinical and clinical atherosclerosis, even within the 
euthyroid range.
Thyroid hormones have been linked with various proatherogenic 
and antiatherogenic processes. However, the relationship between 
thyroid function and atherogenesis remains unclear. In a large pro-
spective population-based cohort study, we investigated the relation-
ship between thyroid function and atherosclerosis at different stages 
of progression; from subclinical atherosclerosis to atherosclerotic 
events to atherosclerotic mortality. We found that higher FT4 lev-
els are associated with an increased risk of subclinical and clinical 
manifestations of atherosclerosis, independent of cardiovascular risk 
factors. The association was consistent even among euthyroid sub-
jects. Our study suggests the value of FT4 as a potential marker for 
predicting atherosclerotic morbidity and mortality. Moreover, our re-
sults underscore the importance of identifying the modifiable media-
tors of the association between thyroid function and atherogenesis. 
Preventive strategies targeting thyroid function or certain mediators 
could further lead to a reduction in atherosclerotic events.

infarction, stroke, and coronary or other arterial revascularization.18,19 
Prevalent ASCV disease at baseline was assessed through interview 
and verified in medical records.
ASCV mortality was defined as death because of CHD, cerebrovas-
cular disease, or other atherosclerotic diseases, as described previous-
ly.18,20 Non-ASCV mortality was defined as death because of causes other 
than atherosclerotic disease. In the Online Data Supplement, we provide 
extensive information on CAC assessment, ASCV events ascertainment, 
and evaluation of medical history, medication use, smoking, alcohol in-
take, glucose and lipid levels, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, 
diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure (HF).
Statistical Analysis
The association of thyroid function with atherosclerosis spectrum 
was assessed by using logistic regression and Cox proportional 
hazard models. We used logistic regression models to investi-
gate the cross-sectional association of thyroid function with the 
risk of having CAC score of ≥100 AU, among participants who 
were free of ASCV disease. The association of thyroid function 
with incident ASCV events was prospectively investigated through 
Cox proportional hazard models. The analysis on incident ASCV 
events comprised individuals who were free of any ASCV event 
at baseline, and only first events during follow-up were analyzed. 
The association of thyroid function with ASCV mortality was also 
examined through Cox proportional hazard models. We further 
compared the hazard ratios (HR) of ASCV mortality with those 
of non-ASCV mortality. To account for multiple comparisons, the 
analyses investigating the association of TSH or FT4 with subclini-
cal atherosclerosis, incident ASCV events, and ASCV mortality 
were additionally corrected for the false discovery rate using the 
Benjamini and Hochberg method.21
Analyses were stratified by sex (men versus women) and age. The 
latter was grouped based on the cutoff of 65 years, which is closer to 
the mean and median age of our population.
Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders that were se-
lected based on biological plausibility and previous literature. Model 
1 was adjusted for age, sex, and cohort. Model 2 was additionally 
adjusted for smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI, total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, prevalent diabetes mellitus, and 
use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. The analyses 
of ASCV mortality were additionally adjusted for presence of preva-
lent ASCV disease. Detailed descriptions of the research methods are 
provided in the Appendix.
Sensitivity Analyses
We performed several sets of sensitivity analyses to explore the 
robustness of our findings: (1) we limited the study participants to 
only those with thyroid function within the reference range, with-
out history of thyroid disease and not using thyroid medications; 2) 
thyroid function–altering medications, physical activity, and estimat-
ed glomerular filtration rate can influence the metabolism of THs. 
Therefore, we excluded participants using thyroid function–altering 
medications, such as thyroid medications, analgesics (including 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, and muscle re-
laxants), corticosteroids, or amiodarone. Besides, we additionally 
adjusted our analyses for physical activity or estimated glomerular 
filtration rate; (3) we restricted the analyses to participants without 
history of AF and censored the incident AF cases during follow-up; 
(4) we restricted the analyses to participants without history of HF at 
baseline and censored the incident HF cases during follow-up; (5) to 
account for possible reverse causation, we investigated the associa-
tion of thyroid function with incident ASCV events and ASCV mor-
tality, after excluding the events that occurred during the first 2 years 
of follow-up; (6) we investigated the association of thyroid function 
with CAC score as a continuous variable, among participants who 
were free of ASCV disease. Because of its skewed distribution, CAC 
score was log transformed after adding 1 (ln[CAC+1]; and (7) to ex-
plore the role of thyroid autoimmunity on atherosclerotic outcomes, 
we investigated the association of TPOAb levels with the risk of inci-
dent ASCV events and ASCV deaths.
Results
We included 9420 participants with a maximum follow-up 
time of 14.7 years and a median of 8.8 years (interquartile 
range, 4.5–11.8 years). Baseline characteristics are presented 
in Table 1. The mean age of participants was 64.8 (±9.7) years, 
and 56.7% were women (Table 1). A total of 934 incident 
ASCV events (incidence rate, 12.6 per 1000 person-years) and 
612 ASCV deaths (incidence rate, 7.9 per 1000 person-years) 
occurred during follow-up. Results did not change substan-
tially after primary and additional adjustments for potential 
confounders; therefore, we further report the most adjusted 
model (model 2).
The characteristics and determinants of thyroid function 
in the Rotterdam Study population have been described in de-
tail previously.22 In brief, the main determinants of FT4 in the 
Rotterdam Study population are age, BMI, sex, and TPOAb 
levels, whereas the main determinants of TSH are age, smok-
ing, and TPOAb levels.
Thyroid Function and CAC Score
Increasing FT4 levels were associated with higher odds of hav-
ing CAC score of ≥100 AU (odds ratio [OR], 2.28; confidence 
interval [CI], 1.30–4.02 per 1 ng/dL; Table 2). The association 
remained statistically significant after controlling for the false

Table 2). However, TSH levels were not associated with hav-
ing a CAC score of ≥100 AU (OR, 0.94; CI, 0.84–1.05 per 1 
logTSH; Table 2). No evidence of nonlinearity was observed 
(P for nonlinearity for FT4 and TSH, 0.8 and 0.6, respectively; 
Online Figure II). Restricting the analyses to participants with 
thyroid function within the reference ranges resulted in simi-
lar or increased point estimates, with wider CIs (OR, 2.43; 
CI, 1.14–5.16 per 1 ng/dL FT4; OR, 0.91; CI, 0.72–1.16 per 1

CAC score as a continuous variable (β, 0.54; CI, 0.01–1.08 
per 1 ng/dL FT4; β, 0.01; CI, −0.10 to 0.12 per 1 log TSH; 
Online Figure II). Furthermore, we found no association of 
TPOAb with the odds of having CAC score of ≥100 AU (OR, 
0.85; CI, 0.63–1.15; Online Table I). In the analyses of CAC 
score, the interaction terms between the exposure (TSH or 
FT4) and each covariate in the most adjusted model were not 
statistically significant. In particular, there were no significant 
sex or age differences (P for interaction of TSH and FT4 with 
sex [men versus women], 0.96 and 0.88, respectively; p for 
interaction of TSH and FT4 with age [<65 versus ≥65 years], 
0.88 and 0.67, respectively; Online Table IV).
Thyroid Function and Incident ASCV Events
There was a positive association of FT4 levels with the risk 
of incident ASCV events (HR, 1.87; CI, 1.34–2.59 per 1 ng/
dL), which remained statistically significant after controlling 
for the false discovery rate (false discovery rate-corrected P 
value, 0.0006; Table 3). There was no association of TSH lev-
els (HR, 0.96; CI, 0.89–1.03 per 1 logTSH) with the risk of 
incident ASCV events (Table 3). No evidence of nonlinear-
ity was observed (P for nonlinearity for FT4 and TSH, 0.6 
and 0.8, respectively; Online Figure II). Restricting the analy-
ses to participants with thyroid function within the reference 
ranges resulted in similar or increased point estimates, with 
wider CIs (HR, 2.50; CI, 1.58–3.94 per 1 ng/dL; HR, 0.96; 
CI, 0.82–1.11 per 1 logTSH; Table 3). This corresponds to a 
2.70× higher risk of incident ASCV events, for a participant

with an FT4 in the higher limit of the reference range (1.94 
ng/dL), compared with a participant with an FT4 in the lower 
limit of the reference range (0.86 ng/dL). The associations 
became slightly stronger after excluding participants using 
thyroid function–altering medications and slightly attenuated 
after censoring the analyses at the time of incident AF (Online 
Table II). The associations remained similar after censoring 
the analyses at the time of incident HF or after additionally 
adjusting for physical activity or estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate. Results did not change substantially after exclud-
ing events that occurred during the first 2 years of follow-up 
(Online Table III). Furthermore, we found no association of 
TPOAb with the risk of incident ASCV events (HR, 0.95; CI, 
0.78–1.16; Online Table I). In the analyses of incident ASCV 
events, the interaction terms between the exposure (TSH or 
FT4) and each covariate in the most adjusted model were not 
statistically significant. In particular, there were no significant 
sex or age differences (P for interaction of TSH and FT4 with 
sex [men versus women], 0.92 and 0.62, respectively; P for 
interaction of TSH and FT4 with age [<65 and ≥65 years], 0. 
30 and 0.34, respectively; Online Table IV).
Thyroid Function and ASCV Mortality
Higher FT4 levels were associated with a higher risk of ASCV 
mortality (HR, 2.41; CI, 1.68–3.47 per 1 ng/dL Table 4). The 
association remained statistically significant after controlling 
for the false discovery rate (false discovery rate-corrected P 
value, <0.0001; Table 4). In line, higher TSH levels were as-
sociated with a lower risk of ASCV mortality (HR, 0.92; CI, 
0.84–1.00 per 1 logTSH), although the association was bor-
derline significant (Table 4). No evidence of nonlinearity was 
observed (P for nonlinearity for FT4 and TSH, 0.8 and 0.8, 
respectively; Online Figure II).
In the analysis of ASCV mortality, we found statistically 
significant differences by prevalent ASCV disease at baseline 
and by sex (P for interaction of FT4 with prevalent ASCV 
disease [present versus absent], 0.002; P for interaction of 
TSH and FT4 with sex [men versus women], 0.03 and 0.002, 
respectively) but no statistically significant age differences 
(P for interaction of TSH and FT4 with age [<65 versus ≥65 
years], 0.35 and 0.78, respectively; Figure; Online Table 
IV). The association of FT4 with atherosclerotic mortality 
was more pronounced among participants with ASCV dis-
ease (HR, 5.59; CI, 2.90–10.80 per 1 ng/dL) and among 
men (HR, 4.63; CI, 2.70–7.94 per 1 ng/dL; Figure; Online 
Table IV). Within the strata of prevalent ASCV disease (ab-
sent versus present), none of the interaction terms of TSH 
or FT4 concentrations with sex or age were statistically sig-
nificant (P for interaction, >0.05; Figure). Within the strata 
of sex (men versus women), none of the interaction terms of 
TSH or FT4 concentrations with prevalent ASCV disease or 
age were statistically significant (P for interaction, >0.05). 
Among euthyroid participants, none of the interaction terms 
between the exposure (TSH or FT4) and prevalent ASCV 
disease (absent versus present), sex (men versus women), or 
age (<65 versus ≥65 years) were statistically significant (P 
for interaction, >0.05).
The association of thyroid function with ASCV mortal-
ity became slightly stronger after restricting the analyses to 
participants with thyroid function within the reference rang-
es (HR, 3.84; CI, 2.23–6.60 per 1 ng/dL FT4; HR, 0.80; CI, 
0.67–0.96 per 1 logTSH; Table 4; Figure). This corresponds to 
a 4.15× higher risk of ASCV mortality, for a participant with 
an FT4 in the higher limit of the reference range (1.94 ng/dL), 
compared with a participant with an FT4 in the lower limit of 
the reference range (0.86 ng/dL). The associations remained 
similar after excluding participants using thyroid function–
altering medications, after censoring the analyses at the time 
of incident HF or after additionally adjusting for physical ac-
tivity or estimated glomerular filtration rate. The associations 
slightly attenuated after censoring the analyses at the time of 
incident AF (Online Table II). Results did not change substan-
tially after excluding events that occurred during the first 2 
years of follow-up (Online Table III). The magnitude of as-
sociation for ASCV mortality was larger than for non-ASCV 
mortality (Table 5). Furthermore, we found no association of 
TPOAb with the risk of ASCV mortality (HR, 0.99; CI, 0.77–
1.27; Online Table I).

Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study, higher FT4 levels 
were associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, in-
dependent of cardiovascular risk factors. The association was 
consistent throughout the spectrum of atherosclerosis, from 
subclinical atherosclerosis to overt atherosclerosis to athero-
sclerotic mortality.
Various cardiovascular risk factors have been implicated 
in the pathways linking thyroid function to atherosclerosis. 
Low thyroid function has been associated with unfavorable 
levels of blood lipids and BMI,6 whereas high thyroid function 
has been associated with an increased prevalence of AF.16 Our 
study suggests that the association of thyroid function with 
atherosclerosis is independent of these cardiovascular risk fac-
tors because our results remained statistically significant after 
accounting for serum lipid levels, BMI, and AF. Thyroid auto-
immunity has been suggested as another potential contributor 
to atherogenesis. Thus far, it has been speculated that thyroid 
autoantibodies may target the arterial wall and ultimately en-
hance the development of atherosclerotic plaque.23,24 However, 
we found no association between TPOAb positivity and ath-
erosclerotic outcomes. Taken together, these data suggest that 
the link between thyroid function and atherosclerosis could 
be explained by yet unexplored cardiovascular risk factors,

alternative markers of thyroid autoimmunity (eg, TSH recep-
tor antibodies), or other pathways.
Plausible mechanisms that can link high thyroid func-
tion to atherosclerosis include endothelial damage, hemo-
stasis, thrombosis, and hemodynamic changes. First, excess 
TH concentrations can increase the production of reactive 
oxygen species that further induce the expression of adhe-
sion molecules on endothelial cells.25 Hence, hyperthyroidism 
has been commonly associated with early atherosclerosis and 
markers of endothelial dysfunction, such as E-selectin, intra-
cellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell-adhesion mol-
ecule.26 Second, TH regulates the synthesis of procoagulant 
proteins.27 Excess FT4 levels have been linked with increased 
concentrations of various procoagulant proteins, namely von 
Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and factors VIII and IX, that 
can accelerate plaque vulnerability and rupture.5 Third, high 
levels of TH can generate increased cardiac contractility and 
workload, augmenting myocardial oxygen demand that could 
eventually precipitate ischemic events and death.3 These del-
eterious effects of high thyroid function may also be extended 
to the high-normal range of thyroid function.11 Future research 
should pinpoint the exact mechanisms underlying the associa-
tion of thyroid function with atherogenesis.
Our large cohort study sought to disentangle the asso-
ciation of thyroid function with atherosclerotic and non-
atherosclerotic mortality. The effect of thyroid function on 
atherosclerotic mortality was greater compared with nonath-
erosclerotic mortality, indicating that atherosclerosis plays a 
major role in the pathways linking high thyroid function to 
increased mortality risk.
Previous cohort studies among middle-aged and el-
derly subjects have mainly reported an increased mortality 
risk with higher thyroid function.28–31 In an attempt to iden-
tify potential subgroups at risk, prior research has suggest-
ed that the effect of thyroid function on mortality might be 
age28–31 or sex dependent.29,30 Generally, studies performed 
in older participants have reported an increased risk of mor-
tality with higher FT4 levels,29,30 whereas studies including 
younger participants have failed to show an association.32,33 
Additional studies have reported an association of thyroid 
function with mortality risk exclusively in men34 or women.7 
Our data on atherosclerotic mortality revealed stronger risk 
estimates among participants with preexisting atherosclerotic 
disease and among men. Prevalent atherosclerotic disease 
and sex might, therefore, be effect modifiers of the associa-
tion between thyroid function and atherosclerotic mortality. 
However, these results should be interpreted with caution be-
cause the differences by atherosclerotic disease and sex were 
not statistically significant after restricting the analyses to the 
euthyroid participants.
Alternatively, one might argue that TH is not a contributor 
but rather a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis or a marker 
of increased mortality in the setting of chronic atherosclero-
sis. In particular, it could be hypothesized that health prob-
lems underlying atherosclerotic disease can affect thyroid 
parameters. This condition, known as nonthyroidal illness, 
is typically characterized by normal serum TSH levels com-
bined with low serum triiodothyronine and FT4 levels.35 In 
contrast, we found an association of higher rather than lower 
FT4 levels with an increased risk of atherosclerotic manifesta-
tions. Additionally, nonthyroidal illness occurs mainly in criti-
cally ill patients, whereas our population consists of relatively 
healthy community-dwelling adults. Furthermore, our study 
showed that higher FT4 levels among participants without 
preexisting atherosclerotic disease were associated with high-
er risk of atherosclerotic events and atherosclerotic mortality. 
We took reverse causation into account by excluding events 
that occurred during the first 2 years of follow-up and results 
remained similar. Overall, these data suggest that it is more 
likely that thyroid function affects atherosclerotic manifesta-
tions than vice versa.
Variations of thyroid function within the reference range 
markedly affected the risk of atherosclerotic morbidity and 
mortality in our participants. In line with these results, a re-
cent individual participant data analysis reported a positive as-
sociation between thyroid function within the reference range 
and the risk of stroke.9 However, another analysis from the 
same collaboration failed to show an association between thy-
roid function within the reference range and the risk of CHD,8 
although this could be because of the relatively low proportion 
of CHD deaths (3.3%). We observed larger risk estimates after 
restricting the analyses to participants with TSH and FT4 lev-
els within the reference ranges, although one would expect a 
higher outcome risk within the full range of thyroid function. 
However, euthyroid participants are known to have a small 
intraindividual variation of thyroid function.36 In contrast, 
participants with thyroid dysfunction are prone to treatment 
during follow-up, which could eventually reduce their risk for 
atherosclerotic morbidity and mortality over time. This can 
explain the increased atherosclerotic risk after we excluded 
the users of thyroid function–altering medications from the 
analyses. Future interventional studies, however, can provide 
more insight into the impact of thyroid function–altering med-
ications on the risk of atherosclerosis. Finally, our data pro-
vide supporting evidence for a reevaluation of TSH and FT4 
reference ranges, which are currently based on arbitrary statis-
tical approaches (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) rather than on 
clinical outcomes. Previous prospective studies have also re-
ported that variations in thyroid function within the reference 
range are associated with an increased risk of various adverse 
outcomes.9,11,16 Thus, the challenge for future research will be 
to integrate the associated risk of relevant adverse outcomes, 
to eventually define the clinically relevant normal range of 
thyroid function.
In our study population, there was a positive association 
between FT4 levels and atherosclerotic outcomes. Although 
the association between TSH levels and atherosclerotic 
outcomes was in the expected opposite direction of FT4, it 
sometimes did not reach statistical significance. Similar ob-
servations have been also reported by studies investigating 
the relationship of thyroid function with various clinical end 
points.9,29 Serum FT4 levels are tightly regulated by the hy-
pothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis, with a different set point 
for each individual. This might explain why FT4 levels are 
associated with various clinical end points, especially with-
in the euthyroid range, which is generally defined by TSH. 
Alternatively, these results may reflect a slight shift in the 
TSH-FT4 set point, which may be because of aging.37

To our knowledge, this is the first population-based co-
hort study that investigates the relationship of thyroid function 
with atherosclerosis throughout its spectrum, from subclini-
cal atherosclerosis to overt atherosclerosis to atherosclerotic 
mortality. Thyroid function measurements were performed 
before the occurrence of atherosclerotic events. Another ma-
jor strength is the long-term follow-up (maximum follow-up 
time was almost 15 years). Moreover, we included a large 
number of participants with extensive data on covariates and 
outcomes. Our large numbers further allowed us to perform 
multiple sensitivity analyses, which provided consistent find-
ings. Also, we were able to account for the main determinants 
of thyroid function in the Rotterdam Study population.
Several limitations should also be considered. Thyroid 
function was measured only at baseline, and we had no in-
formation on its fluctuations over time. Nevertheless, because 
of the intraindividual variability of TSH and FT4 levels, the 
lack of repeated measurements would tend to underestimate 
the association between thyroid function and atherosclerotic 
outcomes rather than generate spurious findings.38 In addition, 
our results were consistent within the normal range of thyroid 
function, which is considered to be stable with small intrain-
dividual variability.36 We lacked information on serum triiodo-
thyronine levels. However, TSH and FT4 represent the most 
relevant measurements of thyroid function in clinical practice. 
Given that our study comprised mainly white middle-aged and 
older adults, the generalizability of our findings to nonwhite 
and younger populations remains to be investigated. Lastly, 
the possibility of residual confounding in an observational 
study design cannot be entirely ruled out.
Conclusions
Higher FT4 levels in middle-aged and elderly subjects were 
associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic morbid-
ity and mortality, independent of cardiovascular risk factors. 
These findings suggest that FT4 measurement can be a pre-
dictive marker of atherosclerotic mortality. Furthermore, our 
findings underscore the importance of identifying the modi-
fiable mediators of the association between thyroid function 
and atherogenesis. Preventive strategies targeting thyroid 
function or certain mediators could further lead to a reduction 
in atherosclerotic events. Lastly, our findings provide support-
ing evidence for a reevaluation of the current reference ranges 
of TSH and FT4 tests, which are based on arbitrary statistical 
approaches rather than on clinical outcomes, such as athero-
sclerotic morbidity and mortality.
