IMPORTANCE Previous studies have shown that, despite the higher risk of bleeding, the
elderly still benefit from taking anticoagulants if they have a stringent indication. However,
owing to the relatively low number of patients older than 90 years in these studies, it is
unknown whether this benefit is also seen with the eldest patients.
OBJECTIVE To determine how the risk of bleeding and thrombosis is associated with age in
patients older than 70 years who were treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A matched cohort study was conducted of patients at
a thrombosis service who were treated with a VKA between January 21, 2009, and June 30,
2012. All 1109 patients 90 years or older who were treated with a VKA were randomly
matched 1:1:1 with 1100 patients aged 80 to 89 years and 1104 patients aged 70 to 79 years
based on duration of VKA treatment. Data analysis was conducted from April 2015 to
April 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of clinically relevant
nonmajor and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included thromboses and quality of VKA
control.
RESULTS During 6419 observation-years, 713 of the 3313 patients (1394 men and 1919
women) had 1050 bleeding events. The risk of bleeding was not significantly increased in
patients aged 80 to 89 years (event rate per 100 patient-years [ER], 16.7; hazard ratio [HR],
1.07; 95% CI, 0.89-1.27) and mildly increased in patients 90 years or older (ER, 18.1; HR, 1.26;
95% CI, 1.05-1.50) compared with patients aged 70 to 79 years (ER, 14.8). The point
estimates for major bleeding (including fatal) were comparable for patients aged 80 to 89
years (ER, 1.0; HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.60-1.98) and those 90 years or older (ER, 1.1; HR, 1.20;
95% CI, 0.65-2.22) compared with those aged 70 to 79 years (ER, 0.9). The increase in
bleeding risk was sharper in men than in women. Eighty-five patients (2.6%) developed a
thrombotic event. Risk of thrombosis was higher for patients in their 90s (HR, 2.14; 95% CI,
1.22-3.75) and 80s (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.002-3.05) than for patients in their 70s. Vitamin K
antagonist control became significantly poorer with rising age, which partly explained the
increased bleeding risk in patients 90 years or older, but most of the increased risk of
thrombosis was not mediated by VKA control.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These clinical practice data of patients considered eligible for
anticoagulation show that the bleeding risk with a VKA only mildly increases after the age of
80 years, while there is a sharp increase in the risk of thrombosis in the same age group.

V
itamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective in the pre-
ventionofvenousandarterialthrombosis,buttheirma-
jor complication is bleeding.1,2 Several studies have
shown that the risk of bleeding among patients taking a VKA
increases with age.3-5 This increased risk might be partly ex-
plained by poorer control of the VKA.6-8 Other possible expla-
nations are the increased comorbidities, comedications, fall
risks, and susceptibility for gastrointestinal bleeding with in-
creasing age.9
The higher bleeding risk in the elderly makes physicians
reluctant to prescribe VKAs.10,11 However, the clinical deci-
sion to initiate anticoagulation should be modeled as a bal-
ance between the risks of bleeding and thrombosis. As the risk
ofthrombosisishigherintheelderly,12morethromboticevents
can be prevented by the use of anticoagulants. Consequently,
it could be that a higher risk of bleeding should be accepted in
favor of fewer thrombotic events.
The Computerized Registry of Patients with Venous
Thromboembolism (RIETE) study showed that patients older
than 80 years with venous thromboembolism (VTE) have a
higher risk of death from recurrent VTE than from fatal bleed-
ing while taking a VKA.13 Moreover, the Birmingham Atrial Fi-
brillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) trial demonstrated
that patients older than 75 years with atrial fibrillation still ben-
efit from anticoagulant treatment.14 These data confirm that
elderly patients should be treated with anticoagulants if they
have a stringent indication. However, it is unclear whether
these recommendations can be extrapolated to patients older
than 90 years as well, as such patients were still underrepre-
sented in these studies. Therefore, it is essential to know how
the risk of bleeding and thrombosis during VKA therapy de-
velopsaftertheageof70years.Thisriskwasanalyzedinalarge
cohort study of patients treated with VKAs at Certe Thrombo-
sis Service Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.
Methods
Study Design
From the patients treated at Certe Thrombosis Service Gron-
ingen between January 21, 2009, and June 30, 2012, we
selected all patients 90 years or older. This thrombosis ser-
vice managed VKA therapy for all noninstitutionalized
patients and the patients of many nursing homes in the area
of Groningen. All referred patients were actually being
treated with VKAs; thus, there was no selection bias as the
thrombosis service had no role in screening or selecting
patients. Blood was drawn for international normalized ratio
(INR) measurements by thrombosis service personnel at a
local laboratory or at patients’homes for those with mobility
issues. Vitamin K antagonist doses were determined using a
computerized algorithm. Dosing cards and follow-up
appointments were sent by postal mail or email. The location
where blood was drawn did not influence the frequency,
intensity, or nature of medical care.
We formed 2 cohorts: 1 of newly referred patients (incep-
tion cohort) and 1 with all other patients (long-term cohort).
We used a matched cohort design to include all information
of the patients 90 years or older while limiting the total num-
ber of patients to enable thorough adjudication of end points.
Every patient 90 years or older was randomly matched to 1 pa-
tient aged 80 to 89 years and 1 patient aged 70 to 79 years.
Matching was based on whether the patient belonged to the
inception or long-term cohort, as previous research has shown
that the risk of bleeding is highest during the beginning of
treatment.15 To equalize the potential follow-up time, we also
matched patients on the date that the study follow-up started
for that individual patient. To select a group of patients rep-
resentativefortheiragegroup,wedidnotmatchonotherchar-
acteristics. There were no exclusion criteria to optimize gen-
eralizability.
Data Collection
Patient and treatment characteristics were collected from
the computerized records of the thrombosis service. The
physicians of the thrombosis service prospectively regis-
tered all bleeding events, thrombotic events, permanent
treatment discontinuations at Thrombosis Service Gronin-
gen (including patients who migrated and left the service to
be treated elsewhere), and deaths. Also, additional informa-
tion was routinely requested from the general practitioner in
case of death or if there was any indication of stroke or major
bleeding. Subsequently, strokes were classified into hemor-
rhagic, ischemic, or unspecified. In addition, it was regis-
tered if death was caused by bleeding, VTE, stroke, or myo-
cardial infarction. The therapeutic INR range for atrial
fibrillation and VTE was 2.0 to 3.5, as routinely applied in
the Netherlands.16 Individual patients could have a thera-
peutic INR range of 2.5 to 4.0 if they were being treated for
another indication.
As this study concerns retrospective research, no institu-
tional review board approval or patient consent was needed
according to Dutch law. Protection of the patients’identity was
guaranteed by assigning study-specific unique patient num-
bers as deidentifiers.
Outcome Definition
The primary end point was a composite of clinically relevant
nonmajor and major bleeding. The secondary end points were
major bleeding, including hemorrhagic stroke, death related
Key Points
Question Are risk of bleeding and thrombosis associated with age
in patients older than 70 years who were treated with a vitamin K
antagonist?
Findings In this cohort study of 3313 patients using a vitamin K
antagonist, the bleeding risk only mildly increased in patients 90
years or older, and the increase was more pronounced in men than
in women. There was a profound increase in the risk of thrombosis
among patients 90 years or older.
Meaning Our data suggest that the recommendations to use
anticoagulants in patients older than 80 years can be safely
extrapolated to the eldest patients as well, but evidence is
stronger for women than for men.

the INRs but also the variability of the INRs determine the risk
of bleeding and thrombosis while using a VKA.6 Variability—
the degree to which INRs differ from the previous INR—was de-
termined by the formula of Cannegieter.7
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted from April 2015 to April 2016. We
described the baseline characteristics stratified by age group.
The association of age with the time to first event was ana-
lyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, with pa-
tients aged 70 to 79 years as the reference group. We checked
visually for violations of the Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion assumption and found none. Follow-up ended at perma-
nent discontinuation of treatment, death, or June 30, 2012,
whichever came first. For all end points, subgroup analyses for
the inception and long-term cohort were performed. For the
primary end point, subgroup analyses with respect to the in-
dication for VKA (atrial fibrillation and VTE), sex, and the tar-
get INR range were also performed. These predefined sub-
group analyses were chosen based on literature and clinical
experience. We performed a sensitivity analysis using the ro-
bustsandwichmethodtodeterminewhetheramatchedanaly-
sis would have led to different findings and found highly com-
parable results.
Differences between age groups in quality of VKA control
were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance or the Krus-
kal-Wallis test. In addition, we determined whether the po-
tential association between age and the risk of bleeding and
thrombosis was mediated by VKA control.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Of the 26 089 patients who were treated between January 21,
2009, and June 30, 2012, at Certe Thrombosis Service Gron-
ingen, 1109 were 90 years or older. Of these patients, 385
(34.7%) belonged to the inception cohort and 724 (65.3%) to
the long-term cohort. The long-term patients in their 70s
(n = 1104), 80s (n = 1100), and 90s had a median treatment du-
ration at the start of the study of 4.4, 4.8, and 5.0 years, re-
spectively. As expected, with rising age, the proportion of
women increased (Table 1). Atrial fibrillation was the most
prevalent indication for all ages.

Comparison of Bleeding Events Between Age Groups
The 713 patients (21.5%) with at least 1 bleeding event had a
total of 986 clinically relevant nonmajor and 64 major bleed-
ing events (Table 2). The event rate per 100 patient-years was
based on all 1050 bleeding events and was lowest for the pa-
tients aged 70 to 79 years (14.8), followed by the patients aged
80 to 89 years (16.7), and was highest in the patients 90 years
or older (18.1) (Table 2). Bleeding was most often localized
at the skin (327 events [31.1%]), nose (216 events [20.6%]),
urogenital tract (185 events [17.6%]), and gastrointestinal tract
(172 events [16.4%]), which was the same for all ages. In the
inception cohort, a disproportional number of bleeding events
(32 of the 270 bleeds [11.9%]) occurred in the first 30 days,
which accounted for only 7% of the total follow-up time (1221
observation-years).
Patients 90 years or older had a mildly increased risk of
bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.50) com-
pared with patients aged 70 to 79 years (Figure 1). The risk of
bleeding for patients aged 80 to 89 years (HR, 1.07; 95% CI,
0.89-1.27) was comparable with that for the patients in their
70s. Outcomes of several subgroup analyses regarding indi-
cation, treatment duration, and target range did not differ es-
sentially from the main analysis. We observed a sharper in-
crease in risk of bleeding for men than women with rising age
(Figure 2). We also found that there was a slightly increased
risk of bleeding (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39) in men overall.
Of the 1394 men, 340 (24.4%) had at least 1 bleeding event,
while373ofthe1919women(19.4%)developedatleast1bleed-
ing event.
The event rate (per 100 patient-years) of major bleeding
was 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1 for patients in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, re-
spectively (Table 2). The occurrence of major bleeding was not
significantly higher in patients 90 years or older (HR, 1.20; 95%
CI, 0.65-2.22) or those between 80 and 89 years (HR, 1.09; 95%
CI, 0.60-1.98) than in patients aged 70 to 79 years, and there
was no interaction between age and sex. The risk of fatal bleed-
ing was also not increased in patients in their 90s (HR, 1.32;
95% CI, 0.58-3.01). Bleeding events led more often to discon-
tinuation of the VKA in patients in their 80s (HR, 2.07; 95%
CI, 0.97-4.42) and 90s (HR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.34-5.95) than in pa-
tients in their 70s.
Comparison of Thrombotic Events Between Age Groups
Eighty-five patients (2.6%) had a thrombotic event; no pa-
tienthadmultiplethromboses.Theeventrate(per100patient-
years) was 0.8, 1.5, and 1.8 for patients in their 70s, 80s, and
90s, respectively (Table 2). The risk of developing a thrombo-
sis was higher for patients in their 90s (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.22-
3.75) and 80s (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.002-3.05) than for patients
in their 70s. The subgroup analyses showed a more pro-
nounced risk in the inception cohort (HR, 5.57; 95% CI, 1.22-
25.4 and HR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.10-22.8, respectively) than in the

The risk of bleeding in patients
90 years and older is mildly increased
compared with patients aged 70 to
79 years. Patients in their 80s have a
risk of bleeding comparable with that
of patients in their 70s.

long-termcohort(HR,1.74;95%CI,0.93-3.25andHR,1.38;95%
CI, 0.74-2.55, respectively). We found no interaction between
age group and sex.
When focusing on the thrombotic events for which VKAs
are most effective (VTE and stroke), the risk estimates of pa-
tients 90 years or older (HR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.66-7.18) and those
aged 80 to 89 years (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.82-3.92) did not es-
sentially change. Again, this risk was more pronounced in the
inception cohort (HR, 9.93; 95% CI, 1.26-78.4 and HR, 7.00;
95% CI, 0.86-56.9, respectively) than in the long-term cohort
(HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.21-6.12 and HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.49-2.94,
respectively). The risk of thrombosis-related death was also in-
creased in patients 90 years or older (HR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.94-
10.5) compared with those aged 70 to 79 years.
Comparison of VKA Control Among Age Groups
Thecontrolofindividualtimeinthetherapeuticrangeandvari-
ability of the INRs became significantly worse with rising age
(Table 3). A higher perceived risk of bleeding in the eldest pa-
tients could have led to a more cautious anticoagulant treat-
ment with a lower target INR and consequently more under-
anticoagulation. However, the time under and above the target
INR range remained well balanced, and the mean INR was
highly comparable for all ages.
Asexpected,poorerVKAcontrolwasassociatedwithworse
clinical outcome (eTable in the Supplement). Adding variabil-
ity of the INRs and individual time in the therapeutic range to
the bleeding model reduced the HR of the patients 90 years
or older from 1.26 to 1.11 (95% CI, 0.92-1.33). Hence, part of the
increased bleeding risk was mediated by poorer VKA control.
In contrast, most of the increased risk of thrombosis was not
mediated by VKA control, as the HR remained 1.85 (95% CI,
CI 1.04-3.27) for patients 90 years or older and 1.64 (95% CI,
0.94-2.87) for patients aged 80 to 89 years after adding VKA
control to the Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Discussion
This large cohort study showed that the frequency of bleed-
ing events was not significantly increased in patients aged 80
to 89 years and only mildly increased in patients 90 years or
oldercomparedwithpatientsintheir70s.Thesubgroupanaly-
ses showed that the risk of bleeding increased more with age
in men than in women. The severity and location of bleeding
were the same for patients of all ages. The risk of thrombosis
of patients in their 90s and 80s was higher and more often fa-
tal than in patients aged 70 to 79 years, especially in patients

who just started VKA treatment. Additional analyses regard-
ing the role of VKA control showed that the increased risk of
bleeding in patients 90 years or older was partly explained by
poorer VKA control. In contrast, the increased risk of throm-
bosis was mostly independent of VKA control.
The rate of nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding was com-
parable with that in the Italian Study on Complications of Oral
Anticoagulant Therapy (ISCOAT).4 The rate of major bleeding
events was relatively low in our study, which could be ex-
plained by the inclusion of a large proportion of patients with
long-term VKA use and the relatively broad criteria for major
bleeding in some of the other studies.4,5,13,14
We compared 3 well-defined age groups and showed that
the risk of bleeding stabilized in patients aged 80 to 89 years
and subsequently only mildly increased above the age of 90
years. This result was in line with the findings by Poli and
colleagues,5 but they compared only 2 age groups. Many other
studies compared patient groups with wide ranges of age13,19
or had too few patients within the age strata.14
The higher risk of bleeding in patients 90 years or older
compared with that of patients aged 70 to 79 years became
nonsignificant after adjustment for quality of VKA control.
Thus, the higher risk seemed to be partly associated with
poorer VKA control and partly with age-associated fragility.
The increased risk of thrombosis in patients in their 90s and
80s persisted after adjustment. It is unlikely that this high
risk of thrombosis was caused by a general lack of efficacy of
VKAs.14 Thus, physicians probably prescribed VKAs to a
selection of patients older than 80 years with a relatively
high risk of thrombosis.
One of the limitations of this study was that patients who
were considered to have too high of a risk of bleeding to use
anticoagulants were not included in our study. However, this
risk might only have been a problem if physicians could pre-
dict the bleeding risk. This issue can be questioned, as the pre-
dictive value of classic risk factors, such as history of bleed-
ing or falls, proved very limited within the group of elderly
patients.20 However, we cannot rule out that clinical factors
not included in the stratification models of risk of bleeding,
such as cognitive function, are related to the risk of bleeding.
If so, and if these factors influenced the decision of the phy-
sician to start anticoagulation therapy, the presented risks of
bleeding only apply to patients considered eligible for antico-
agulation therapy. Second, patients who started VKA therapy
but died before their first appointment at the thrombosis ser-
vice were not included in this study, which could have led to
an underestimation of the bleeding risk. Third, the cause of
some strokes remained unspecified despite thorough prospec-
tive adjudication. In line with common practice, the unspeci-
fied strokes were assumed in the analyses to be ischemic. Fur-
thermore, the relatively low number of major bleeding events
resulted in wide 95% CIs, which leaves some uncertainty re-
garding the true relative risk. On the other hand, the low num-
ber of major bleeding events is reassuring in itself. Moreover,
minor bleeding alerts clinicians for subsequent major bleed-
ing and therefore reflects the general tendency of the patient
to experience bleeding events.21 In this large cohort study, we
found no indications that bleeding severity increased with age,
while the frequency increased only mildly.
The strengths of this study included the real-life data, the
thorough adjudication of end points, the lack of exclusion cri-
teria, and the large cohort size. The latter enabled us to per-
form separate analyses in the inception and long-term co-
hort. In this way, we could analyze the effect of age in 2
situations: in elderly patients who started to use VKAs and in
aging patients who were already using VKAs. Moreover, the in-
ception cohort enabled us to estimate the risk of bleeding as-
sociatedwithinitiationofVKAswithoutsurvivorbias.Thelack
of exclusion criteria and the comparable findings in most of
the additional subanalyses endorse the generalizability of our
findings.
Although physicians may believe that the risk of bleeding
keeps rising with age, we found that the risk stabilized in pa-
tients aged 80 to 89 years and only mildly increased above 90
years. One of the possible explanations is that risk of bleeding
rises steadily with age within patients but that the eldest pa-
tients are a natural selection of less frail individuals: a survi-
vorscohort.Ourdatasuggestthatthisselectionresultsinfewer
frail women than men, as the bleeding risk rises more sharply
with age in men. The sex difference could also be explained
by more extreme worsening of VKA control with age in men,
but this possibility is not supported by our data. Last, the sex
difference could also be a chance finding because we are not
aware of any other study supporting this finding.
As men had a higher absolute bleeding risk, the large pro-
portion of women in the eldest group could also partly ex-
plain the relatively low risk of bleeding in that group. An-

Conclusions
Irrespective of the underlying mechanism, our data on pa-
tients considered eligible for anticoagulation therapy suggest
that the recommendations to use anticoagulants in patients
older than 80 years can be safely extrapolated to the eldest
women as well. The stronger increase in risk of bleeding in the
eldest men makes us more cautious to draw final conclusions
for this group of patients.
