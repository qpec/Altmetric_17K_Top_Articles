Medulloblastoma is the most common solid primary brain tumor in children. Remarkable advancements in the
understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of these tumors have informed their recent molecular classifica-
tion. However, the genotype/phenotype correlation of the subgroups remains largely uncharacterized. In particular,
the metabolic phenotype is of great interest because of its druggability, which could lead to the development of novel
and more tailored therapies for a subset of medulloblastoma. p73 plays a critical role in a range of cellular metabolic
processes. We show overexpression of p73 in a proportion of non-WNT medulloblastoma. In these tumors, p73
sustains cell growth and proliferation via regulation of glutamine metabolism. We validated our results in a xeno-
graft model in which we observed an increase in survival time in mice on a glutamine restriction diet. Notably,
glutamine starvation has a synergistic effect with cisplatin, a component of the current medulloblastoma chemo-
therapy. These findings raise the possibility that glutamine depletion can be used as an adjuvant treatment for p73-
expressing medulloblastoma.

Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common primary pedi-
atric brain tumor and is a major cause of mortality and
morbidity in pediatric oncology (Louis et al. 2007). Cur-
rent treatment strategies include a combination of sur-
gery,
radiotherapy,
and
chemotherapy,
which
have
achieved 70%–80% 5-yr survival rates; however, recur-
rence is common and often proves fatal (Hill et al. 2015).
In addition, both the brain exposure to ionizing radiation
and the systemic exposure to chemotherapy agents can in-
duce severe side effects, leading to mental and physical
disability of the affected children.
MB is a heterogeneous tumor with molecularly defined
subgroups that arise from different cerebellar progenitor
cells, albeit often showing rather similar histological fea-
tures (Corno et al. 2012). MBs have been classified recent-
ly into four molecular groups; namely, the WNT group,
the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) group, group 3 (G3), and group
4 (G4) (Taylor et al. 2012). The discovery that mutant
TP53 plays an important role in SHH MB pathogenesis
led to the further dissection of the SHH group into TP53
wild-type and TP53 mutant subgroups, the latter being as-
sociated with a poor outcome (Ramaswamy et al. 2015).
Emerging evidence suggests that each group may require
specific therapeutic strategies (Northcott et al. 2012),
and recent studies demonstrated that WNT MB have
anomalous vascularization and show increased hemor-
rhaging (Phoenix et al. 2016).
The p53 family comprises three members (p53, p63, and
p73) (Boominathan 2010), and its role in promoting cell

 death and senescence has been described extensively. Im-
portantly, p63 plays a particular role in the development
of the epidermis (Vanbokhoven et al. 2011), and p73 is es-
sential for the development of the central nervous system
(CNS) (Yang et al. 2000). Indeed, p73 is highly expressed in
the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum during embry-
onic stages of CNS development; its expression then de-
creases after birth and is restricted to the neural stem
cell (NSC) niches in the adult brain (Pozniak et al. 2002).
p73-deficient mice show prominent brain malformations
and reduced NSC proliferation (Talos et al. 2010). Unlike
p53, p73 is not lost but rather is frequently overexpressed
in cancer. Accordingly, p73 is overexpressed in MB tu-
mors and cell lines even though its role in these tumors
is still unclear (Zitterbart et al. 2007).
At the molecular level, p73 is transcribed from two dif-
ferent promoters into proteins that either retain (TAp73)
or lack (ΔNp73) the transactivation domain. TAp73 is
able to activate p53-responsive genes and induce apopto-
sis (Zhu et al. 1998), although TAp73 also has distinct
transcriptional targets (Allocati et al. 2012). In contrast,
ΔNp73 displays an anti-apoptotic effect (Dulloo et al.
2010). Recent studies have shown that p73 plays an impor-
tant role in the regulation of metabolic pathways. TAp73
enhances the pentose phosphate pathway flux (Jiang et al.
2013), activates serine biosynthesis (Amelio et al. 2014b),
and controls glutaminolysis (Velletri et al. 2013). TAp73
regulates the mitochondrial respiration by inducting cyto-
chrome c oxidase (Rufini et al. 2012), and its depletion re-
sults in decreased oxygen consumption and ATP levels
with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. p73
is also a major transcriptional regulator of autophagy
(He et al. 2013) and is activated when mTOR is inhibited
(Rosenbluth and Pietenpol 2009). Consistent with these
data, TAp73 knockout mice show premature aging and
senescence (Rufini et al. 2012).
Metabolic adaptation has emerged recently as a hall-
mark of cancer and a promising therapeutic target (Hana-
han and Weinberg 2011). Accordingly, highly proliferating
cancer cells must adapt their metabolism in order to pro-
duce enough energy and mass to replicate. The first step of
adaptation is through enhanced aerobic glycolysis, which
allows cells to metabolize glucose to lactate instead of py-
ruvate (Warburg 1956). Aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells
is essential for tumor progression and, in MB, has been es-
timated to account for 60% of ATP production (Moreno-
Sanchez et al. 2009).
In addition to the dependency on aerobic glycolysis,
cancer cells exhibit other metabolic characteristics such
as increased fatty acid synthesis and addiction to gluta-
mine. Some cancer cells show glutamine addiction regard-
less of the fact that glutamine is a nonessential amino acid
and one that can be synthesized from glucose (DeBerardi-
nis and Cheng 2010). Glutamine is used by the cancer
cells to synthetize amino acid precursors and in maintain-
ing activation of TOR kinase (Ahluwalia et al. 1990).
Moreover, glutamine is the primary mitochondrial sub-
strate and is required to maintain mitochondrial mem-
brane potential and support the NADPH production
needed for redox control and macromolecular synthesis
(Wise and Thompson 2010). Importantly, MB metabolism
exhibits a high dependency on aerobic glycolysis and lipo-
genesis through the activation of hexokinase 2 and fatty
acid synthase (Gershon et al. 2013; Tech et al. 2015). Ad-
ditionally, MBs limit protein translation through activa-
tion of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase to restrict
energy expenditure (Leprivier et al. 2013). This difference
between cancer and normal cells suggests that targeting
metabolic dependence could be a selective approach to
treat cancer patients.
In this study, we set out to investigate the metabolic
pathways regulated by p73 in MB by means of genome-
wide transcriptome and metabolome analysis in MB cell
lines and patient-derived MB cells with subsequent bio-
chemical and functional validation in vitro and in vivo
in a xenograft mouse model.
Results
TAp73 is overexpressed in MB and controls proliferation
in MB cell lines and patient-derived primary cells
p73 was reported to be overexpressed in MB (Zitterbart
et al. 2007), although it was unclear which p73 isoforms
were expressed. To clarify this, we analyzed RNA se-
quence data derived from 240 clinically characterized hu-
man MBs. Significant overexpression of TAp73α was
found in G4 and G3 MBs as compared with normal cerebel-
la, with high expression levels found in SHH MBs and very
low levels found in WNT MBs (Fig. 1A). TAp73β, ΔNp73α,
and ΔNp73β isoforms were not significantly expressed in
MB (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Next, we looked at the ex-
pression of p75NTR and GLS-2, two well-characterized
TAp73 target genes important for brain development and
glutamine metabolism, respectively (Niklison-Chirou
et al. 2013; Velletri et al. 2013). Consistent with the
TAp73 levels, significant up-regulation of GLS-2 was
found in the G4 MBs, while the highest expression of
p75NTR was detected in SHH MBs (Fig. 1A). Overall, these
analyses demonstrate that the most aggressive subgroups
of MB express high levels of TAp73 mRNA.
Next, we analyzed the expression of p73 in a range of
human patient-derived primary MB cells and cell lines.
We found the highest level in lCb-1299 (primary human
G4 MB) and intermediate levels in primary SHH MB cells
(m137 and m692) and the DAOY cell line, with no expres-
sion detected in the UW228-2 cell line (Supplemental Fig.
S1B). We show at the RNA and protein levels that the only
isoform expressed in MB cells is TAp73, as a single band of
75 kDa was detected in the Western blot (Supplemental
Fig. S1B,C). RT–PCR analysis of TAp73, p75NTR, and
GLS-2 in lCb-1299, m137, m692, DAOY, and UW228-2
cells revealed up-regulation of all genes in MB cells ex-
pressing p73 (Supplemental Fig. S1D–F), in keeping with
the results of the genome-wide analysis on human prima-
ry tumors (Fig. 1A).
To explore the role of TAp73 in MB, we transiently
knocked down p73 (p73KD) in DAOY, m137, and ICb-
1299 cells. Western blot and RT–PCR confirmed p73KD
in all cells (Supplemental Fig. S1G,H) and showed

 that the levels of the other p53 family members (p53 or
p63) were not affected (Supplemental Fig. S1G). Silencing
p73 strongly reduced cell growth in DAOY, m137, and
ICb-1299 (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we observed a 30% reduc-
tion in cell proliferation in ICb-1299 cells, where only a
partial (44% of p73 levels) knockdown could be obtained
(Fig. 1C,D).
These results show that p73 is essential for MB cell
growth and proliferation.
TAp73 regulates GLS-2 in MB cells
p73 regulatesthe expression of many target genes involved
in cell metabolism, DNA repair, or apoptosis. To dissect
the molecular pathways mediating p73’s role in MB, we
performed a differential gene expression analysis in
DAOYcomparingp73KD cells with control cells at48 h af-
ter silencing. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis re-
vealed
that
a
large
number
of
genes
involved
in
metabolism and/or stress pathways were differentially ex-
pressed upon p73KD, and unsupervised hierarchical clus-
tering (HCL) demonstrated that DAOY p73KD cluster
apart from control cells, suggesting that a distinct tran-
scriptome-wide gene signature was associated with the si-
lencing of p73 (Fig. 1E, genes involved in metabolism;
Supplemental Fig. S1I, genes involved in stress pathways).
Because we were interested in identifying genes that
are specifically transactivated by p73, we focused our at-
tention on genes that are down-regulated in the absence
of p73.
We selected 14 genes (>1.5 fold change; P < 0.05) for val-
idation as p73 target genes: GADD45B, GLS-2, ASL, SFN,
PFKM, ACO2, NOS2, PHKA1, NBN, ENO, AKT2, SDHA,
CS, and RAD50 (Fig. 1E; Supplemental Fig. S1I,J). p73KD
was repeated in DAOY cells, and expression of the target
genes was analyzed at three different time points: 10, 24,
and 48 h after silencing. We detected an early down-regu-
lation (10 h after knockdown) of GADD45B, GLS-2, and
ASL (Fig. 1F; Supplemental Fig. S1K). To assess whether
this molecular convergence was retained in patient-de-
rived primary MB cells expressing p73, the expression of
GADD45B, GLS-2, and ASL was assessed in lCb-1299
and m137 after p73KD. In agreement with our previous re-
sults, we observed an early down-regulation of GLS-2 in
both cell lines upon p73KD (Fig. 1F). GADD45B and ASL
were down-regulated only in lCb-1299. Importantly, re-ex-
pression of a mouse TAp73 rescued the effect of p73KD on
the expression levels of GADD45B, GLS-2, and ASL, con-
firming that they were primary p73 targets in DAOY cells
(Fig. 1G). Down-regulation of GLS-2 after p73KD was con-
firmed at the protein level in DAOY cells (Fig. 1H).
These results show that GLS-2 is a conserved TAp73
target gene in MB cells derived from non-WNT MB
subgroups.
TAp73 is a critical cellular component for mitochondrial
bioenergetics in MB cells
The importance of glutamine as a nutrient in cancer re-
lies on its suitability as a substrate for the mitochondrial
TCA cycle (Hensley et al. 2013). Since we observed a
strong reduction of GLS-2 after p73KD, we measured
the mitochondria oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as an
indicator of the mitochondrial function. A functional bio-
energetics profile of DAOY p73KD as compared with
control cells is shown in Figure 2A. We measured the
OCR in response to sequential treatment with oligomy-
cin, carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydra-
zone (FCCP), and rotenone/antimycin A. We observed a
strong decrease in the basal respiration, ATP production,
and spare respiratory capacity upon p73KD, which sug-
gested profound respiratory defects after p73KD (Fig.
2A). Similar results were obtained after GLS-2KD (Fig.
2A; Supplemental Fig. S2A). These findings were validat-
ed in patient-derived primary MB cells (m137 and ICb-
1299), where similar results were obtained (Supplemental
Fig. S2B,C).
Next, we performed a stable p73KD (p73sKD) with two
different shRNAs: p73sKD∗3 and p73sKD∗5. The re-
duction of p73 protein levels in steady state was con-
firmed by immunoblotting (Supplemental Fig. S2D).
Importantly, re-expression of GLS-2 in a p73sKD setting
(p73sKD∗5) rescued the OCR levels (Supplemental Fig.
S2E–G).
While assessing whether p73KD induces mitochondrial
dysfunction, we observed a strong mitochondrial hyperpo-
larization in DAOY cells upon p73KD (Supplemental Fig.
S2H). Because mitochondrial hyperpolarization has been
related to ROS production (Giovannini et al. 2002) and
because glutamine is a precursor of glutathione synthesis
(GSH; the major antioxidant within the cells), we mea-
sured the redox status of DAOY cells upon p73KD or in
our stable p73sKD∗3 or p73sKD∗5 or after GLS-2KD as as-
sessed by the GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig. 2B). A decreased ratio
of reduced glutathione to glutathione disulfide was ob-
served after p73KD or p73sKD or after siGLS-2, confirm-
ing that after p73KD or GLS-2KD, DAOY cells are under
oxidative stress. Importantly, this effect was completely
rescued after GLS-2 overexpression (Fig. 2B), indicating
that GLS-2 is an important p73 target gene for balancing
the redox status of the cells.
Since 60% of ATP production in MB cells is generated
by aerobic glycolysis (Moreno-Sanchez et al. 2009), we
measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in
DAOY cells upon p73KD (Fig. 2C). The results show a ro-
bust decline (50%) in lactate production after p73KD com-
pared with control cells in response to oligomycin
treatment, suggesting a reduced ability to increase glyco-
lytic flux under conditions of increased ATP demand.
Next, we set out to confirm these results by measuring
the kinetics of glucose uptake and lactate production in
DAOY upon p73KD at different time points. In control
cells, the levels of glucose decreased steadily over time,
with an increased lactate production observed in parallel,
whereas an inhibition of glucose uptake and production of
lactate was observed after 20 h in DAOY p73KD (Fig. 2D,
E). Importantly, glucose levels increased in DAOY p73KD,
indicating that the lack of TAp73 induced gluconeogene-
sis in the longer term. Gluconeogenesis is a common pro-
cess in tumor cells in which cells can derive energy from

 ketone bodies, which are converted to acetyl-CoA and
shunted into the TCA cycle.
Because oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycoly-
sis are the two main sources of cellular energy, we mea-
sured ATP levels in DAOY, m137, and lCb-1299 cells.
In line with our previous results, a strong reduction in
the ATP levels was observed upon p73KD in DAOY,
m137, and ICb-1299 cells (Fig. 2F; Supplemental Fig.
S2I). Similar results were observed upon GLS-2KD (Sup-
plemental Fig. S2I).
Taken together, these data suggest that p73 is essential
for the major energy-producing pathways and for mainte-
nance of the redox balance of the cells through the gener-
ation of glutathione via the regulation of GLS-2.
p73 sustains activation of the mTOR pathway
by inhibiting AMPK activation in MB
AMPK plays a role as a master regulator of cellular energy,
is activated when cellular ATP levels drop, and initiates a
cellular reprogram that allows the cell to adapt to the en-
ergetic stress (Hardie et al. 2012). We observed a robust ac-
tivation of AMPK, as assessed by phosphorylation of its
direct target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), in DAOY af-
ter p73KD (Fig. 2G). An important mediator of the AMPK
response is the mTOR pathway, which is inhibited by
AMPK (Liu et al. 2012). We show here inhibition of the
mTOR pathway, as shown by reduced phosphorylation
of its downstream targets, the protein S6 kinase (S6K)

 and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF-2),
upon p73KD (Fig. 2G). mTOR is a nutrient sensor, by
which glutamine and leucine levels stimulate protein syn-
thesis via signaling through the mTOR complex. Con-
versely, mTOR inhibition leads to reduction in the rate
of the global protein production (Zhao et al. 2015). In order
to determine whether p73 supports protein synthesis in
DAOY cells, we silenced p73 in DAOY cells and then
treated the cells for 1 h with puromycin. The incorpora-
tion of puromycin in the newly synthesized proteins
was assessed with an anti-puromycin antibody. We found
reduced protein synthesis of ∼50% in DAOY p73KD (Fig.
2H; Supplemental Fig. S2J). These data suggest that
p73 modulates mTOR activation through reduction in
AMPK activity in MB cells.
Profound metabolic changes in MB cells after p73KD
Cellular metabolism is characterized by many parame-
ters, including nutrient uptake or metabolite secretion
rates (Buescher et al. 2015). We measured amino acid lev-
els in the medium of DAOY p73KD as compared with
controls 48 h after silencing. We show that the lack of
p73 reduces the levels of 14 amino acids and increases
the levels of four. Alanine, glutamine, and glutamate are
the most noticeably reduced amino acids (Fig. 3A). Inter-
estingly, the main source of carbon skeletons used for glu-
coneogenesis are lactate and the amino acids alanine and
glutamine; thus, these data are in agreement with our pre-
vious observation that p73KD induces gluconeogenesis
(Fig. 2D).
The four amino acids augmented in the medium are ser-
ine, glycine, ornithine, and proline (Fig. 3A). Serine and
glycine are biosynthetically linked and are essential for
one-carbon metabolism (Amelio et al. 2014a). Since these
amino acids show increased levels in the absence of the
p73, it is likely that this represents a compensatory effect
not directly linked to p73. We confirmed these results by
measuring the kinetics of serine and glycine production
(Supplemental Fig. S3A,B); we observed a significant in-
crease in serine/glycine synthesis after 20 h of p73KD. Im-
portantly, serine can be used by cancer cells for the de
novo synthesis of ATP (Maddocks et al. 2016).
Next, we measured the expression of pyruvate kinase
isozyme M2 (PKM2), an enzyme characterized by a low af-
finity to its substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which
is almost inactive at physiological PEP concentrations.
High RNA level of PKM2 was observed in DAOY cells
after 24 and 48 h of p73KD (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the pres-
ence of PKM2 induces accumulation of glycolytic inter-
mediates above pyruvate kinase and therefore increases
the synthesis of serine/glycine or the pentose phosphate
pathway flux.
Following this, we used liquid chromatography hyphen-
ated to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS)-
based untargeted metabolite profiling to study potential
differences in the intracellular polar metabolome (endog-
enous molecules with a molecular weight >1000 Da) in
DAOY p73KD as compared with controls 48 h after silenc-
ing. A clear difference between the two conditions was
found (Fig. 3C,D), indicating that silencing of p73 induces
a strong difference in the polar metabolites of the cells.
The absence of p73 in DAOY cells induces a significant re-
duction of adenosine, malic acid, and choline as well as
several phospholipids. The reduction in adenosine ob-
served is in agreement with the reduction in ATP levels
observed after p73KD (Fig. 2F; Supplemental Fig. S2I). Im-
portantly, we observed a strong reduction in choline and
phospholipids (Fig. 3E), both of which can function as an
energy source since they can be degraded to produce ace-
tyl-CoA, and the reduction in malic acid is in line with
our observation that the activity of the TCA cycle was re-
duced after p73KD.
Importantly, the levels of cytidine, guanine, guanosine,
hypoxanthine, inosine, uridine, phenylalanine, indoleace-
tic acid, N-formyl-L-methionine, 4-phosphopantohenoyl-
cysteine, and pyruvic acid were significantly (P < 0.05) up-
regulated (Fig. 3E). We performed a pathway analysis using
the Web-based software MetaboAnalyst (http://www.
metaboanalyst.ca). We found that several metabolites
were related and observed an up-regulation of purine me-
tabolism. These data are in line with our observation that
after p73KD, there is an increase in serine/glycine synthe-
sis, whereby serine can contribute to the purine metabo-
lism by providing one-carbon units (Maddocks et al. 2016).
During gluconeogenesis, lactate and alanine are con-
sumed to produce pyruvate—hence the strong reduction
in alanine and the increased levels of pyruvate that we ob-
served in DAOY p73KD. Pyruvate is oxidized to feed into
the gluconeogenic pathway (Supplemental Fig. S3C).
In summary, silencing of p73 in DAOY cells induces a
profound metabolic alteration in which the cells try to
compensate for the lack of energy due to reduced gluta-
mine metabolism through a compensatory mechanism.
Instead, lactate and pyruvate intermediates are used to
feed into the gluconeogenic pathway. This process allows
the cells to produce large amounts of serine/glycine and
synthetize intermediates of the purine pathways and nu-
cleosides, probably to synthetize ATP de novo.
TAp73 expression is a biomarker of glutamine addiction
in MB cells
Glutamine is an abundant and versatile nutrient that par-
ticipates in energy formation, redox homeostasis, and
macromolecular synthesis in cancer cells (Altman et al.
2016). These characteristics make glutamine metabolism
an appealing target for new clinical strategies. Important-
ly, some cancers display addiction to glutamine despite
the fact that glutamine is a nonessential amino acid
(Wise and Thompson 2010).
Nutrient deprivation is a strong stress with dire conse-
quences on cell viability and energy status (Leprivier
et al. 2013). Therefore, we investigated whether removal
of the amino acid glutamine or serine/glycine or glucose
induced a differential response between MB cells express-
ing p73 and those without p73. First, we measured the im-
pact on cell growth after glucose, glutamine, and serine/
glycine
starvation.

 as examples of a p73-expressing and non-p73-expressing
line, respectively. In DAOY cells, we observed prolifera-
tion arrest under glucose starvation, a significant reduc-
tion of the cell number under glutamine starvation,
and no significant effect under serine/glycine starvation
(Fig. 4A). Likewise, the three starvation conditions were
able to stop cell proliferation of UW228-2 cells (Fig. 4A).
Because we observed a reduction in cell number in
DAOY cells after glutamine starvation, we hypothesize
that this could be due to cell death. To validate these re-
sults, we measured cell proliferation of DAOY and
UW228-2 cells under the three starvation conditions.

 We found that only glutamine starvation induces a
robust inhibition of cell proliferation in DAOY cells after
15 h of treatment, as assessed by EdU incorporation (Fig.
4B,C).
It was reported that nutrient deprivation induces
autophagy (Filomeni et al. 2015); therefore, we measured
the levels of LC3-II by FACS analysis in DAOY and
UW228-2 cells in control medium and after 24 h under
glucose, glutamine, or serine/glycine starvation. No in-
crease in LC3-II levels was observed (Supplemental Fig.
S4A).
Next, we assessed whether glucose, glutamine, or ser-
ine/glycine was essential for ATP production in DAOY
and UW228-2 cell lines. Cells were subjected to starvation
for 24 h followed by measurement of the ATP levels (Fig.
4C). We show a 96% reduction in the ATP levels in DAOY
cells after glutamine starvation, while no changes were
seen in UW228-2, suggesting that the cell line expressing
p73 had a glutamine addiction phenotype (Fig. 4D).p73
protein levels are usually maintained low by rapid protea-
some degradation; however, DNA damage and different
stress signals may trigger the stabilization of p73. There-
fore, we measured p73 levels in DAOY cells after 18 h un-
der the three starvation conditions (Fig. 4E). We observed
up-regulation of p73 only under glutamine starvation. Im-
portantly, glutamine starvation of DAOY cells for 4, 6,
and 8 h concomitantly with MG132, a proteasome inhib-
itor that reduces the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated
proteins, induced enhancement of the p73 stabilization
(Supplemental Fig. S4B). Since increased levels of p73
can induce apoptosis (Asher et al. 2005), we measured ap-
optosis with Annexin/PI in DAOY and UW228-2 cells un-
der the different starvation conditions. After 36 h of
starvation, only DAOY cells under glutamine starvation
show
a
strong
apoptosis
response
(Fig.
4F),
while
UW228-2 did not show apoptosis under the three starva-
tion conditions (Supplemental Fig. S4C).
Next, we challenged DAOY, UW228-2, and the primary
G4 cells (lCb-1299) with glutamine starvation or gluta-
mine starvation plus MG132. We show a strong synergis-
tic effect in inducing cell death in DAOY and lCb-1299
after glutamine starvation plus MG132, while no effect
was observed in UW228-2 cells (Fig. 4G).
Subsequently, we analyzed the kinetics of glucose up-
take and lactate production in DAOY cells in control me-
dium and under glutamine starvation. We observed that
glucose levels decreased steadily over time in DAOY cells
in control medium, with an increased lactate production
observed in parallel; an inhibition of glucose uptake and
production of lactate was observed after 20 h in DAOY
under glutamine starvation (Supplemental Fig. S4D,E).
Importantly, we were unable to detect the induction of
gluconeogenesis under glutamine starvation conditions.
Therefore, we measured serine and glycine levels in the
medium of DAOY cells in control medium or under gluta-
mine starvation conditions (Supplemental Fig. S4F,G). We
observed an initial drop in serine and glycine levels, but, at
a later time point (40 h), the levels were equal to control.
These data suggest that under glutamine starvation condi-
tions, DAOY cells are not able to induce a metabolic re-
programming to allow them to adapt and survive under
glutamine starvation.
These data strongly support our hypothesis that expres-
sion of p73 predicts a phenotype of glutamine addiction in
MB cells.
Synergistic effect of glutamine starvation and cisplatin in
MB cells expressing p73
Cisplatin and etoposide are effective in MB patients
(Evans et al. 2009); therefore, we treated DAOY cells
with glutamine starvation in conjunction with two dif-
ferent concentrations of cisplatin or etoposide for 18
h. Importantly, we found a strong enhancement of the ap-
optotic effect after glutamine starvation plus cisplatin,
while no effect was seen with the glutamine starvation
plus etoposide treatment (Fig. 5A).
Next, weevaluated theimpact oncell proliferation asas-
sessed by EdU incorporation in lCb-1299 primary cells
treated with glutamine starvation or compound 968 with
or without cisplatin for 18 h. Compound 968 is a cell-per-
meable inhibitor of GLS-2 that mimics a condition of glu-
tamine starvation. We observed that glutamine starvation
or compound 968 alone induced 25% or 30% inhibition in
cell proliferation, respectively (Fig. 5B; Supplemental Fig.
S5A). Importantly, the combinations of glutamine starva-
tion plus cisplatin or compound 968 plus cisplatin induced
a strong synergic effect of 45%–80% inhibition in cell pro-
liferation (Fig. 5B; Supplemental Fig. S5A).
To assess whether p73 was mediating the apoptotic re-
sponse upon glutamine starvation, we performed a stable
p73 knockdown (p73sKD∗3 and p73sKD∗5). A robust apo-
ptosis was observed in DAOY cells after glutamine starva-
tion or glutamine starvation plus cisplatin after 30 h of
treatment (Fig. 5C). Importantly, no effect was observed
under glutamine starvation in both p73sKD cells, with
only negligible apoptosis observed under glutamine star-
vation plus cisplatin in both p73KD cells. Furthermore,
a strong reduction in ATP levels was observed in control
DAOY cells after glutamine starvation or glutamine star-
vation plus cisplatin, but the effect was abolished in
DAOY p73sKD (Fig. 5D). These data support the conclu-
sion that p73 is an important element to mediate apopto-
sis in MB cells under glutamine starvation.
To confirm the “glutamine addiction phenotype” in
MB primary cells, we evaluated the cell number and
ATP levels after treatment with glutamine starvation, cis-
platin, glutamine starvation plus cisplatin, 6-diazo-5-oxo-
L-norleucine (DON; a glutamine antagonist), or DON
plus cisplatin in m137 and lCb-1299 human primary cells.
We demonstrated a synergistic effect resulting in a reduc-
tion of cell number only when cells expressing p73 were
treated with the combination of glutamine starvation
plus cisplatin or DON plus cisplatin (Fig. 5E). Instead, a
strong reduction of ATP levels was observed already under
glutamine starvation or DON treatment (Supplemental
Fig. S5B), in keeping with MB cells expressing p73 using
glutamine as a primary source of energy.
These results confirm the glutamine addiction pheno-
type of MB cells expressing p73.

 Glutamine starvation induces ROS and DNA damage
in MB cells expressing p73
Nutrient deprivation induces ROS (Wu et al. 2013); there-
fore, we asked whether glucose, glutamine, or serine/gly-
cine starvation could induce the accumulation of ROS
with subsequent induction of DNA damage. We starved
DAOY and UW228-2 cells of glucose, glutamine, or ser-
ine/glycine for 12 h followed by ROS assessment with
the probe H2DCFDA. We observed that under the three
starvation conditions, DAOY and UW228-2 cells under-
went a redox imbalance reflected by increased ROS levels

 cells (Fig. 6C,D). Similar findings were not observed after
glucose or serine/glycine starvation treatment. Further-
more, the combination of glutamine starvation plus cis-
platin induced an accumulation of foci in the nuclei at
10 h that was comparable with glutamine starvation alone
after 24 h. These results suggest that cisplatin treatment
induces a synergistic effect with glutamine starvation.
Next, we measured the redox status with the GSH/
GSSG ratio as a marker for oxidative stress in DAOY
and UW228-2 cells in control medium, glucose starvation,
glutamine starvation, or serine/glycine starvation. We
found that the levels of the GSH/GSSH ratio dropped sig-
nificantly in DAOY cells under glutamine starvation, less
so under serine/glycine starvation, and not significantly
under glucose starvation (Fig. 6E). Importantly, no effect
on the GSH/GSSH ratio was observed in UW228-2 cells.
To confirm this result, we measured NADH levels in
these cells under the different starvation conditions
because NADH levels are a well-recognized indicator for
cellular metabolic homoeostasis. In fact, increased ROS
levels and reduced NADH levels represent a status of met-
abolic imbalance (Li et al. 2016). We show a significant re-
duction of the NADH levels under glutamine starvation
in DAOY cells, while no effect was observed in UW228-
2 cells (Fig. 6F).
Together, these results suggest that MB cells that ex-
press p73 show a glutamine addiction phenotype at least
in part by maintaining an oxidant detoxification capacity.
Glutamine restriction diet reduces MB tumor growth
We next set out to validate our in vitro results in an in vivo
mouse model of MB. First, we show that chronic depletion
of nonessential amino acid glutamine (glutamine restric-
tion diet) is well tolerated in vivo (Supplemental Fig.
S7A). Subsequently, ion-exchange chromatography con-
firmed a significant drop in the levels of glutamine and
glutamate, but not other amino acids, in the cerebellum
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice treated with a gluta-
mine restriction diet (Fig. 7A,B; Supplemental Fig. S7B–
D). Importantly, high levels of serine were observed in nor-
mal cerebellar tissue after a glutamine restriction diet
(Fig. 7A), suggesting that normal cells could use serine me-
tabolism for de novo ATP synthesis and survive under a
glutamine restriction diet. Injection of ICb-1299 in the
cerebellum of newborn NOD-SCID mice rapidly induced
tumors with histological and immunohistochemical fea-
tures of MB (Supplemental Fig. S7E). Animals fed with a
glutamine restriction diet displayed a significant increase
in survival time compared with those mice fed a control
diet (Fig. 7C). Importantly, the combination of glutamine
restriction diet with cisplatin (two and three doses) in-
duced a significant synergic effect and extended the sur-
vival time (Fig. 7C). Indeed, we detected a significant
reduction in cell proliferation (Ki67 staining) with a strong
increase in apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) in the animals
fed a glutamine restriction diet while being treated with
cisplatin as compared with control mice (Fig. 7D).
These results are in agreement with our in vitro data, in
which glutamine starvation leads to reduced proliferation
and increased apoptosis in synergism with cisplatin in MB
cells expressing p73.
Discussion
MB represents a heterogeneous group of brain tumors
with distinct molecular and pathological features. Cur-
rent treatments for MB include surgery, radiotherapy,
and chemotherapy, which induce severe side effects in a
substantial proportion of patients. We focused on eluci-
dating the metabolic vulnerabilities of MB for the devel-
opment of a new therapeutic strategy to minimize the
adverse effects of the current therapy.
We show here that TAp73α is overexpressed in a propor-
tion of MBs, including aggressive subgroups, a finding that
confirms and further extends the original description of
p73 protein overexpression in MB (Zitterbart et al. 2007).
Numerous evidence suggests that p73 has a well-de-
fined role in cell metabolism and brain development
(Agostini et al. 2016). However, because of the existence
of numerous splice variants as well as the regulation of
protein stability by proteasomal degradation and micro-
RNA, its precise effect on cellular metabolism is currently
ill defined.
We set out to assess whether p73 regulates any aspect of
cell metabolism in human MB and characterize the rela-
tionship between p73 status and the sensitivity to gluta-
mine restriction treatment. Therefore, we silenced p73
in MB cell lines and patient-derived MB cells and assessed
metabolic changes by genome-wide transcriptome and
global metabolite profiling. The global metabolite profil-
ing is a novel and powerful approach to gain a comprehen-
sive analysis of small endogenous metabolites (Nicholson
et al. 1999). Such data can be used to form a hypothesis de-
scribing possible metabolic alternations due to perturba-
tion of the cellular system (Haggblad Sahlberg et al.
2017). Overall, our study shows for the first time that
TAp73 is essential for accurate mitochondrial bioener-
getics at least in part by modulating GLS-2 expression,
in agreement with previous data in a nonneoplastic con-
text (Velletri et al. 2013).
The role of GLS-2 in tumorigenesis is context-specific
and regulated by factors that are still incompletely charac-
terized (Hensley et al. 2013). GLS-2 is a mitochondrial pro-
tein that hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamate. Following
this, glutamate is used in the cells as a substrate in the
TCA cycle or for glutathione synthesis. We show that
p73KD induced growth inhibition in MB and is directly
linked to reduced mitochondria respiration rates and gly-
colytic capacity. Notably, our data suggest that MB cells
expressing p73 may be more dependent on mitochondrial
respiration for ATP production. Taken together, these
data suggest that TAp73 plays an essential role in the
maintenance of MB cell energy.
Cells regulate energy levels through AMPK, which acts
as a sensor of the ATP/ADP ratio (Hardie et al. 2012).
AMPK activation induces metabolic changes leading to
ATP renewal with inhibition of ATP consumption (Wu
et al. 2013). The changes in ATP levels trigger the

 activation of the energetic stress responses (Mihaylova
and Shaw 2011). The function of AMPK is partly mediated
by mTOR, which lies at the heart of a nutrient-sensing sig-
naling network that controls cellular metabolism (Liu
et al. 2012). After p73KD, we observed a strong activation
of AMPK with a robust inhibition of mTOR, suggesting
that p73 maintains the activation of the mTOR pathway
through modulation of AMPK activity.
We demonstrate that p73KD induces a robust repro-
graming of metabolic processes, including de novo glu-
cose synthesis, also called gluconeogenesis. This process
allows cells to synthetize serine/glycine and pentose
phosphate pathway components from glycolytic interme-
diates. The role of serine in one-carbon metabolism to
support the methionine cycle is well documented (Meiser
et al. 2016) and was also implicated recently in de novo
ATP synthesis (Maddocks et al. 2016). After p73KD, we
observed enhanced rates of de novo purine synthesis and
nucleoside, which may hint at an enhanced contribution
to RNA and DNA synthesis. However, because p73KD in-
duces inhibition of cell proliferation, it is most likely that
the cells are using the serine/glycine pathway for ATP
generation after p73 silencing, as demonstrated previously
in colon cancer (Maddocks et al. 2016).
Over the past 40 years, it has become increasingly clear
that tumor cells exhibit specific amino acid dependency,
and cells from different tumors were shown to die quickly
in vitro following arginine, cysteine, or glutamine depri-
vation, while normal cells survived (Liu et al. 2015).
p53-deficient tumors are vulnerable to serine/glycine star-
vation (Maddocks et al. 2013), although current therapies
do not fully exploit this major difference between cancer
cells and nonneoplastic cells.
Here, we demonstrate that MB cells expressing p73 are
“glutamine-addicted.” Glutamine plays an important
role in supporting tumor growth, as it is essential for
the synthesis of glutathione, an important mitochondrial
antioxidant (Amores-Sanchez and Medina 1999). Gluta-
thione is capable of preventing damage of different cellu-
lar components caused by ROS, such as free radicals,
peroxides, or lipid peroxides (Mari et al. 2009). MB growth
in vitro is inhibited in p73-expressing cells under gluta-
mine starvation and is associated with an abrupt deple-
tion of intracellular ATP. Importantly, MB cells under
glutamine starvation show DNA damage even though
all three starvation conditions induce overproduction
of ROS. A wealth of literature supports the role of p73
in inducing apoptosis after DNA damage (Allocati et al.
2012). We show that only glutamine starvation induces
TAp73 stabilization. Indeed, the combination of gluta-
mine starvation with cisplatin (a chemotherapy agent of
choice in MB therapy) induced a dramatic apoptotic re-
sponse, possibly because of a mitochondria ROS response
known to be triggered by cisplatin (Marullo et al. 2013).
In keeping with this interpretation, treatment with eto-
poside did not elicit a similar effect. We validated p73’s
role in inducing apoptosis following glutamine starvation
through the use of a stable p73 knockout. Crucially, these
cells became refractory to glutamine starvation. This sug-
gests that any drug inducing p73 stabilization or DNA
damage will have a synergistic effect with glutamine
starvation.
To validate these results in an in vivo mouse model of
MB, we generated orthotropic xenografts of patient-
derived MB cells expressing p73 in NOD-SCID mice.
Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that a glutamine restric-
tion diet induces a significant increase in the overall sur-
vival rate of the xenografted mice, with a significant
reduction in cell proliferation (Ki67) and increase in apo-
ptosis (cleavage caspase-3). Importantly, we observed a
synergic effect between a glutamine restriction diet and
cisplatin treatment, raising the possibility that glutamine
restriction diets could be used as an adjuvant treatment
for p73-expressing MB.
In summary, we show that p73 supports mitochondria
respiration in MB via regulation of glutamine metabolism.
Importantly, we validate the susceptibility of p73-express-
ing MB to a glutamine restriction diet in a xenograft mod-
el. The findings presented here support the notion that
p73 is a marker of glutamine addiction in MB tumors
and raise the possibility that a glutamine restriction diet
could be implemented to maximize MB growth control
while minimizing treatment toxicity.
Material and methods
LC-HRMS-based metabolite profiling
The analysis was performed using an Acquity UPLC
I-class system from Waters coupled to a G2S Synapt
Q-TOF equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI)
source (Waters). The sample separation was performed
on a HILIC-Amide column (1.7-µm inner diameter, 2.1 ×
50 mm) from Waters, and the column temperature was
kept at 40°C.
Extracellular amino acid measurement
The medium and cerebellar extracts were centrifuged, and
the supernatant was analyzed. For CFS, at least 1 µL of
CFS per animal was extracted. Next, 1 µL of CSF was di-
luted to 500 µL with deionized water and analyzed. Anal-
ysis was performed by ion-exchange chromatography,
post-column derivatization with ninhydrin, and photo-
metric detection.
Extracellular glucose and lactate measurement
Media from DAOY control and sip73 cells were collected
at different time points. The medium was centrifuged, and
the supernatant was analyzed with an AccutrendPlus sys-
tem (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurement of intracellular ROS
The DAOY and UW228-2 cells were incubated with 5 µM
C-DCDHF-DA-AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min. ROS fluores-
cence (emission ∼530 nm) was measured by a 200-msec
exposure (excitation ∼480 nm).

 Xenograft mouse models
All procedures had Home Office approval (Animals Scien-
tific Procedures Act 1986, PPL:70/7275). NOD-SCID mice
were divided randomly into two groups (control diet or
glutamine restriction diet), each group consisting of 10
mice.
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean values ±SD or ±SEM of at
least three independent experiments. The unpaired Stu-
dent’s t-test and analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA)
were used to assess significant differences between
results. P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
