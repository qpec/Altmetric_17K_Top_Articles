 Impact of the Australian National Cervical
Screening Program in women of different ages
Megan Smith1,2, Karen Canfell1,2
The known Following the 1991 introduction of the Australian
National Cervical Screening Program, the incidence of cervical
cancer declined, but trends for histological types in different
age groups have not been reported.
The new Squamous cell cancer rates in women aged 25 years
or more fell by more than 50%, but have now plateaued
among women aged 25e69 years. Screening has had little
impact on adenocarcinoma rates in any age group, and there
was no decline in cervical cancer rates for 20e24-year-old
women.
The implications Our findings support the planned 2017
transition to HPV-based screening starting at age 25, which
may also reduce adenocarcinoma incidence.
T
he National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) has been
very successful in reducing the overall burden of cervical
cancer in Australia by facilitating the detection and
treatment of pre-cancerous lesions.1 However, in response to new
evidence about the optimal age range for screening, new tech-
nologies, and the implementation of a successful national human
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program, a major review of
national cervical screening policy (the “renewal”) was recently
undertaken.2 Recommended changes to the NCSP include a
change from cytology-based screening every 2 years to primary
HPV testing every 5 years (including partial HPV genotyping
and the referral of HPV 16/18-positive women to colposcopy)
and raising the age for starting screening from 18e20 years to
25 years.3,4
Concerns have been expressed about the safety of raising the
screening age,5 although the change is consistent with inter-
national guidelines6 and with evidence that screening is of
limited effectiveness in women under 25 years of age.7 It
should also be noted that this change to the starting age is
being undertaken in the context of high HPV vaccination
coverage in young women in Australia, and of observed re-
ductions in the rates of both high grade cervical abnormalities
and of vaccine-included type infections (ie, infections with
HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18), including in women who are potentially
at higher risk.8-11
Earlier studies have examined how overall rates of cervical cancer
have changed in Australia since the introduction of the NCSP,12
but no Australian study has analysed the effect by age group
and histological subtype of cancer. Routine screening reports
include incidence data classified according to either age or his-
tological type, but not both, and do not include statistical analyses
of trends.1 The aim of our study was to examine changes in the
incidence of cervical cancer in Australia since the introduction of
the current NCSP, taking both age and histological subtype of
cervical cancer into account, in order to characterise the impact of
the current program before the proposed changes to the NCSP are
introduced.
Methods
Data sources
National cervical cancer incidence data for the period 1982e2010
were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
Age-specific rates were calculated, using population estimates
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.13 Three-year average rates
were calculated for cervical cancer overall and separately for his-
tological subtypes. The main analyses focused on squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, but trends for rarer sub-
types (adenosquamous and other cancers) were also explored.
Statistical analysis
Standardised rate ratios (SRRs) compared the incidence in each
overlapping 3-year period after the introduction of the NCSP with
the
3-year
average
immediately
preceding
its
inception
(1988e1990). SRRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated by standard methods14 across all ages, for the target
Abstract
Objectives: The Australian National Cervical Screening Program
(NCSP) will transition in 2017 from cytology-based screening
every two years, starting from age 18e20 years, to HPV-based
screening every 5 years, starting from age 25. To examine the
impact of the program before this transition we analysed trends
in the incidence of cervical cancer, by age and histological
subtype.
Design, setting and participants: National cervical cancer
incidence data, 1982e2010.
Main outcome measures: Standardised rate ratios (SRR) for
3-yearly average cervical cancer incidence, relative to the rate
during 1988e1990, by age group and histological type.
Results: Between 1988e1990 and 2008e2010, cervical cancer
incidence fell substantially in women aged 25e49 (SRR, 0.55;
95% CI, 0.51e0.59), 50e69 (SRR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.42e0.51) and
70 years or more (SRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.43e0.58), but not in
women aged 20e24 years (SRR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46e1.05).
These declines were primarily driven by drops in squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) in women aged 25e49 (SRR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.46e0.55), 50e69 (SRR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.35e0.45) and more
than 70 years (SRR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36e0.51). However, rates
have now plateaued in women aged 25e69 years. The incidence
of adenocarcinoma did not consistently decline across the
program period in any age group. The incidence of neither SCC
(SRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.55e1.51) nor adenocarcinoma (SRR, 0.91;
95% CI, 0.35e2.40) declined in women aged 20e24 years.
Conclusion: Although women aged 20e24 years have been
included in the NCSP since its inception, no significant impact on
cervical cancer incidence was observed in this age group. The
NCSP has had a substantial impact on SCC and overall cervical
cancer incidence in women aged 25 years and over. Its impact
on the incidence of adenocarcinoma, in contrast, has been
limited.

 screening group (20e69-year-old women), and for the age groups
25e49, 50e69 and � 70 years. Incidence rate ratios were calculated
for the 20e24 years age group (as a single [non-composite] age
group it could not be standardised). Joinpoint regression was un-
dertaken to assess whether trends had been consistent over time
and to estimate the annual percentage change in incidence. Join-
point analysis fits the simplest trend model (fewest changes in
trends) consistent with the data. To avoid overfitting, we restricted
analyses to a maximum of two joinpoints (three trends) across the
study period, with the a priori hypothesis that rates declined after
the beginning of the NCSP, but allowing for the possibility that this
decline had slowed during the second decade of the program, as
suggested by visual inspection of the overall rates.
Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute) and
Joinpoint 4.2.0.2 (Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer
Institute [USA]).
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was not required for the study, as only aggregated
data were analysed.
Results
During 1982e2010, 26 236 cases of cervical cancer were registered
in Australia (SCC, 18 626; adenocarcinoma, 4460; adenosquamous,
1080; other types, 2070). Since 1988e1990, the incidence of cervical
cancer has declined, both overall and in all age groups examined,
except for women aged 20e24 years. The reductions in incidence
between 1988e1990 and 2008e2010 were primarily driven by de-
clines in the rates of SCC (by 50%, 61% and 57% in women aged
25e49, 50e69 and 70 years or more respectively) (Box 1).
Joinpoint analysis indicated that the reduction in the incidence of
SCC in women aged 25e49 years occurred mostly during the
period 1990e2002 (Box 2, Box 3), without significant change
outside this period. For women aged 50e69 years, SCC incidence
was dropping prior to the introduction of the NCSP, with a
stronger decline between 1994 and 2004, but without change from
2005 (Box 2, Box 3). The change from a decline to a plateau in the
incidence of SCC around 2002e2004 was statistically significant for
both age groups (P < 0.001). For women aged 70 years or more, the
incidence of SCC declined before the introduction of the NCSP, but
more rapidlyfrom 1995(Box 2, Box3). For womenaged 50e69or 70
years or more, SCC incidence was thus dropping before the NCSP,
but the subsequent rates of decrease were greater; these changes in
trend were statistically significant (P < 0.001). There were no sig-
nificant trends in SCCincidence in womenaged 20e24 years before
the inception of the NCSP, although point estimates suggest an
increase until 1986, followed by a decline from 1987 to 1992, then a
small, non-significant increase in SCC incidence from 1993. There
were similarly no statistically significant trends in the overall
incidence of cervical cancer in women aged 20e24 years before or
after the start of the NCSP.
The incidence of adenocarcinoma across all ages was 18% lower in
2008e2010 than during 1988e1990. The difference was statistically
significant for women aged 25e49 years, but not for other age
groups (Box 1). However, there was no consistent downward trend
for any age group (Box 4).
Rates of adenosquamous cancer were low, but the relative reduc-
tion and timing of the change in its incidence since 1988e1990 were
similar to those for SCC in women aged 25e49 and 50e69 years
(Appendix, Figures 1 and 2); case numbers among women aged
20e24 years were too small for analysis. The rate of other cervical
cancer types appeared to decline across the entire period
1982e2010, without any change that could be related to the
beginning of the NCSP, although absolute rates were small and the
decline was not significant for women aged 20e24 or 70 years or
more (Appendix, Figure 1 and Table 1). Prior to the start of the
NCSP, other cervical cancers comprised a larger proportion of
cervical cancers in women aged 20e24 years than for other age
groups, although their incidence was still very low; they are now
extremely rare in this age group (Appendix, Tables 2 and 3).
Discussion
Our analysis confirmed that SCC and overall cervical cancer rates
have declined dramatically in women aged 25 years and over since
the inception of the NCSP in Australia, but neither has declined in
women aged 20e24 years. The overall decline among women aged
70 years or more, who are outside the target age range for
screening, was understandably delayed compared with those for
women aged 25e49 and 50e69 years, but the overall reduction is
now comparable with that in the two younger age groups. While
some women continue to be screened after age 69, their number is
much smaller than for women in the target age range,1 and
screening seems unlikely to explain a reduction in incidence of the
magnitude measured. This suggests that the benefits of screening

 have extended beyond the screening end age in Australia, consis-
tent with caseecontrol data from England and Wales.15
Trends in the incidence of adenocarcinoma since the introduction
of organised screening have been less uniform, consistent with
findings in other settings of a limited impact of cytology-based
cervical screening on adenocarcinoma rates.16,17 This difference
has been attributed to the facts that cells from precursor lesions in
the endocervical canal are more difficult to sample, and that
glandular cells are more difficult to interpret than squamous cells.1
A reduction in the incidence of types of cervical cancer other than
SCC was also observed, but appears unconnected with the NCSP,
as it occurred throughout the entire study period. It could reflect

 improvements in clinical follow-up that may have led to improved
identification of endometrial cancer that might previously have
been misclassified as cervical cancer.
Our findings are timely, given the renewal of the NCSP and the
changes in screening policy that will take effect in 2017. After
considering the balance of benefits and harms, as recommended by
the Australian Screening Framework,18 the Medical Services
Advisory Committee (MSAC) recommended that from 2017
women under 25 years of age no longer be screened.3 Our findings
support this recommendation: although women aged 20e24 years
have been included in the NCSP for more than 20 years, there has
been no significant impact on the incidence of either SCC
or of cervical cancer overall in this age group. These
women also now have a substantially lower risk of
cervical cancer because of HPV vaccination. Women
under 25 years of age in 2017 will have been offered HPV
vaccination at school before they were 15 years old, and
the three-dose vaccine uptake rate in these women
exceeds 70%.19 The prevalence of vaccine-included HPV
types is already very low among women under 25, even
among unvaccinated women and woman at potentially
higher risk.9-11 High grade cytological abnormality rates
have fallen in this age group,8 even though uptake of
vaccination in cohorts where this reduction has already
been reported was less than 70%, and its efficacy may
have been reduced by prior exposure to the virus
because these women were vaccinated as young women
or older adolescents. Both direct protection and indirect
protection for unvaccinated women via herd immunity
is likely to be even greater in younger birth cohorts:9
direct
protection
because
females
vaccinated
as
younger adolescents have higher vaccination coverage
and lower rates of HPV exposure prior to vaccination;
indirect protection because more of the population has
since been vaccinated, and because boys are now offered
vaccination.20
While screening women under 25 years of age does not appear to
substantially affect the incidence of cervical cancer among 20e24-
year-old women, it is possible that it might reduce cancer rates
among women aged 25e29 years by detecting and treating pre-
cancerous lesions before the age of 25. This possibility could not
be directly assessed in our study, but data from a UK caseecontrol
study suggest that being screened between the ages of 22 and 24
years does not reduce the risk of cancer for women aged 25e29
years.7 An important change to the NCSP from 2017 is that women
will receive explicit invitations to attend screening, receiving the
first close to their 25th birthday. A switch from a reminder-based to
an invitation-based program was a key recommendation of the

 MSAC,3 and modelling indicates this change will have an impor-
tant impact on the effectiveness of the program in young women,
and on the program overall.21 A wide range of program designs
were modelled, and it was estimated that inviting women at age 25
would reduce cervical cancer incidence across all ages by about
2% compared with an otherwise identical program without in-
vitations (in which case screening would probably commence
more gradually between the ages of 25 and 29 years).21
An alternative explanation for our finding that the incidence of
SCC and of cervical cancer overall in women aged 20e24 years did
not decrease after the start of the NCSP is that the impact of the
program has been limited by falling screening participation in this
age group. However, while their 2-year participation rates have
fallen since reporting began (1996e1997), there have been similar
falls in participation rates for women aged 25e29 and 30e34 years,
among whom cancer rates have declined.22 Additionally, partici-
pation by women aged 20e24 years has mainly fallen since
2006e2007, and this would be unlikely to have affected our find-
ings, because the reductions in cancer incidence in other age groups
predominantly occurred within the first 10e15 years of the
organised screening program, with little change in rates in recent
years.
Another possibility is that screening women aged 20e24 years
has suppressed a rise in cervical cancer that would otherwise have
followed a hypothetical increase in risk behaviour among young
women (eg, first intercourse or more sexual partners at a younger
age). The results of sexual behaviour surveys are inconclusive as
to whether such an increase has occurred, and therefore about
whether it would affect our findings. Data from a national
population-based survey of sexual behaviour indicate that the
median age at first vaginal intercourse was the same for women
aged 20e24 years before and immediately after the start of the
NCSP (ie, women born 1965e1974) as it was for women who were
20e24 years old during the remainder of period covered by our
analysis (ie, women born 1975e1990).23 However, this study also
reported a difference between these cohorts in the proportion of
women who reported first intercourse before the age of 16 years (a
rise from 12.7% to 18.2%).23 There are no data on the number of
sexual partners before the age of 20 years that would allow a
comparison of these cohorts. Although we cannot exclude an in-
crease in risk behaviour, it seems unlikely that it would fully
explain the observed stable incidence of cervical cancer among
20e24-year-old women because, given the magnitude of the re-
ductions in rates in other age groups, it presupposes that a major
increase in risk behaviour coincided with the period of the NCSP.
A limitation of our analysis is that cervical cancer incidence rates
reported here were not adjusted for hysterectomy rates, as data for
this factor were not available for the entire study period. This
limitation is common to all routine reports on cervical cancer
incidence in Australia,8 but it means that the denominator does not
perfectly reflect the true population at risk of cervical cancer. We
may therefore haveunderestimated the incidence ofcervical cancer
in older women. However, this limitation would not affect our
findings for women aged 20e24 years, and would probably have
only a small impact on our findings for those aged 25e49 years.
Reductions in rates for older women may have been overestimated
if part of the drop was attributable to rates of hysterectomy
increasing since the mid-1990s, but survey data suggest that they
did not.24,25 Further, as the overall reductions in cancer incidence
were substantial, they are unlikely to be fully explained by changes
in hysterectomy rates.
The current NCSP has been highly successful in reducing the
incidence of squamous cervical cancer in Australia, by at least
50% in women aged 25 years or more. However, its effectiveness
has been limited among women under 25, and in reducing
adenocarcinoma rates. Further, as participation in screening has
plateaued (and is falling in some age groups), cervical cancer
incidence also appears to have plateaued, if at a lower level than
before the program. The National HPV Vaccination Program and
the renewed NCSP have the potential to mitigate these limitations.
HPV vaccination will provide protection for younger women,
while both HPV vaccination and HPV-based screening are
expected to reduce adenocarcinoma rates.26 It is estimated that the
renewed NCSP will reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality
by at least a further 20%,3,4,21 assuming that active invitations and
recalls are effective in achieving high participation rates. In the
longer term, the combination of HPV vaccination and the renewed
NCSP is predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence by about
70% below what would have been expected without program
change and vaccination,4 and will therefore further reduce the
burden of cervical cancer among women in Australia.
