Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in low-incidence countries in Europe is more prevalent
among migrants than the native population. The impact of the recent increase in migration to EU and
EEA countries with a low incidence of TB (<20 cases per 100 000) on MDR-TB epidemiology is unclear.
This narrative review synthesizes evidence on MDR-TB and migration identified through an expert panel
and database search. A significant proportion of MDR-TB cases in migrants result from reactivation of
latent infection. Refugees and asylum seekers may have a heightened risk of MDR-TB infection and worse
outcomes. Although concerns have been raised around ‘health tourists’ migrating for MDR-TB treatment,
numbers are probably small and data are lacking. Migrants experience significant barriers to testing and
treatment for MDR-TB, exacerbated by increasingly restrictive health systems. Screening for latent MDR-
TB is highly problematic because current tests cannot distinguish drug-resistant latent infection, and
evidence-based guidance for treatment of latent infection in contacts of MDR patients is lacking.
Although there is evidence that transmission of TB from migrants to the general population is lowdit
predominantly occurs within migrant communitiesdthere is a human rights obligation to improve the
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of MDR-TB in migrants. Further research is needed into MDR-TB and
migration, the impact of screening on detection or prevention, and the potential consequences of failing
to treat and prevent MDR-TB among migrants in Europe. An evidence-base is urgently needed to inform
guidelines for effective approaches for MDR-TB management in migrant populations in Europe.

Introduction
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an urgent public
health priority in Europe, with significant health and cost impli-
cations associated with the expensive and prolonged treatment
often required [1]. Migration to and within Europe has increased
dramatically in recent years [2,3], and in many European Union
(EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries with a low
incidence of TB (e.g. <20 cases per 100 000 [4]), rates of MDR-TB
have been shown to be higher among migrants (‘foreign-born’)
than the general population [5e7]. There is evidence both for MDR-
TB being imported to Europe by migrants [8] and for MDR-TB being
acquired or transmitted within Europe [9,10]. Although surveil-
lance data demonstrate that rates of drug resistance in most
western European countries remain low (<3% in new cases) [11],
this may increase with migration from countries with a high MDR-
TB burden, particularly those in eastern Europe with the highest
risk of MDR-TB among TB cases [12].

 The diverse migrant population in Europe, including forced
migrants (asylum seekers and refugees), undocumented migrants
residing in Europe without legal status, or those migrating for
reasons of family, work, or study, is estimated to include over 30
million individuals born outside the EU, and more than 17 million
migrants from other EU Member States [13]. In 2015 alone, more
than 1 million migrants entered Europe during the migrant crisis
[14]. A cohesive evidence-base on the impact of migration on MDR-
TB in Europe is essential to guide policy and practice around the
identification and treatment of MDR-TB.
This narrative review examines the relationship between MDR-
TB and migration in low-incidence EU countries. We consider the
implications of MDR-TB for individual migrants and their commu-
nities, and for public health policy and practice.
Methods
In this paper, we systematically identified evidence on MDR-TB
and migration through a database search including Embase, Med-
line, Global Health and Google Scholar, as well as an expert panel,
which contributed to the identification of relevant research, inte-
grating diverse views to reduce bias.
Epidemiology of migration and MDR-TB
MDR-TB is widespread globally, with an estimated 480 000
cases in 2014 [15] and significant disparities between countries and
regions. In Russia, Bangladesh and China, the proportion of previ-
ously treated TB cases that are multidrug-resistant is 49%, 29% and
26%, respectively [15]. In eastern Europe, the proportion of previ-
ously treated TB cases that are multidrug-resistant is 69.0% in
Belarus, 62.0% in Moldova and Estonia, 56.0% in Ukraine, 49.0% in
Lithuania, 30% in Latvia and 23.0% in Bulgaria [16,17]. Many of these
countries also have high rates of MDR-TB in new cases, for example
Belarus (34%), Moldova (24%), Ukraine (22%) and Estonia (19%) [15].
The high rates of MDR-TB in these countries are in part due to
disparities in the availability of high-quality treatment [17].
Countries in Europe with a low incidence of TB are receiving
increasing numbers of migrants from high-incidence countries,
who are over-represented among MDR-TB cases. Across the EU and
EEA Member States, reported surveillance data suggest that 73.4%
of MDR-TB cases are in migrants (born outside the reporting
country) [18], among whom, 51.7% of MDR-TB cases occur in mi-
grants originating from the EU [19]. In Germany, migrants comprise
94.0% of MDR-TB cases, but only 58.7% of TB cases. Similarly, in the
UK migrants comprise 90.4% of MDR-TB cases, but only 69.1% of TB
cases, and in France migrants account for 89.2% of MDR-TB in-
fections, but only 55.6% of TB cases (Table 1).
The proportion of the population in a selection of European
countries that is foreign born, as well as the proportion of notified
cases of TB and MDR-TB that occur in migrants, are shown in Fig. 1.
This figure illustrates that in much of north and western Europe,
migrants are over-represented among cases of TB, and particularly
MDR-TB, given their distribution in the general population. The
figure also points to disparities between western and eastern
Europe, with migrants comprising a low proportion of TB and MDR-
TB cases in Lithuania and Romania, which can be attributed both to
the low rates of migration and the high incidence of TB (and
particularly MDR-TB). Other research and surveillance data also
highlight disparities in rates of TB and MDR-TB within Europe [20].
A significant proportion of cases of MDR-TB in migrants in low-
incidence countries are likely to result from reactivation of latent
infection acquired before migration [21]. Reactivation of latent TB
most often occurs in the first 2e5 years following migration [22],
which may be partly attributed to poor living conditions and bar-
riers to accessing health services [6,23]. This increased risk may
persist in migrants in comparison to the general population [24].
There is some evidence that a significant proportion of TB cases
(new infection or re-infection) among migrants result from re-
exposure during return visits to their home countries, often to
visit friends or relatives [25], yet data on MDR-TB infection acquired
by this route are lacking. It is important to note that migrant
communities often cluster together in host countries, and disease is
therefore more likely to spread within their own communities,
rather than to the surrounding host population [26,27].
Migrants at high risk of MDR-TB
Migrants fleeing conflict or other violence (e.g. the current
influx of asylum seekers entering Europe from the Middle East and
Africa), may be at increased risk of TB and MDR-TB [24] because of
the collapse of health service infrastructure in the context of con-
flict. The breakdown of health systems has been shown to
contribute to an increase in TB incidence, and may also be a risk
factor for the development of MDR-TB [28,29]. Some migrant
groups including refugees, refused asylum seekers, victims of
trafficking and undocumented migrants may be at particularly high
risk of MDR-TB due to exposure to destitution, poor social condi-
tions (e.g. overcrowding, poor living conditions, incarceration or
detention, and homelessness), exposure to other migrants from
high-incidence countries during their migration trajectory, or co-
infection
(e.g.
with
human
immunodeficiency
virus).
These
migrant groups may also be excluded from health services or be
fearful of accessing services due to their legal status, preventing
them from accessing free screening, diagnosis, or treatment [30].

 However, empirical evidence on the risk of MDR-TB in these groups,
or their general health needs, are insufficient.
There is also a relatively small groupdin the context of the
current mass movement of populationsdof ‘health tourists’, who
migrate or travel with the specific aim of seeking treatment for
MDR-TB [31]. These individuals may have previously received
treatment, but failed multiple courses of therapy in their home
countries, and migrate to access better treatment options [8].
Within this group, there is a small proportion of relatively affluent
patients able to pay for treatment. Recently concerns have been
raised around the implications of health tourism for European
health services and the wider public health [32,33]. Disparities in
rates of TB and MDR-TB between low-incidence countries in Europe
and high-incidence countries globally, and inequalities in the dis-
tribution of resources (including in the availability and affordability
of treatment) may be drivers of this, and have been particularly
highlighted between western and eastern Europe [17]. Overall,
however, data on patterns of health tourism are lacking.

 Diagnosis of MDR-TB and screening strategies
There are significant challenges to drug susceptibility testing to
diagnose MDR-TB and the accurate collection of surveillance data
on MDR-TB globally. Despite the rollout of rapid molecular di-
agnostics including Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/
rifampicin) and line probe assays [34,35], diagnostic delays are
common and only 123 000 cases with MDR-TB were notified
globally in 2014 [36]. In many high-incidence countries, access is
limited to culture-based phenotypic drug sensitivity testing for
first-line and second-line drugs (which takes weeks), although the
second-line Hain line probe assay was recently recommended by
WHO as the initial test for detection of resistance to fluo-
roquinolones and second-line injectable drugs [37]. Migrants from
high-incidence countries may therefore have a high risk of previ-
ously undiagnosed or incorrectly diagnosed drug resistance.
Most low-incidence countries have policies to systematically
screen migrants from countries where TB is endemic for active TB
[38], with a limited number of countries in Europe also imple-
menting screening for latent TB infection [39]. There is conflicting
evidence on the most effective and cost-effective strategy for
migrant TB screening, and there is significant variation in national
approaches to screening [38e41], which can be explained by the
weak evidence-base on the effectiveness of migrant TB screening as
well as heterogeneous political environments [26]. Furthermore,
though screening may be implemented, there is a lack of systematic
follow-up procedures for migrants across Europe [39], which are
necessary for adequate care and efforts to eliminate TB.
Yield of screening for active TB often corresponds to the
epidemiology in the country of origin. However, large variations
may occur due to differences in the profile of sub-populations of
migrants, as well as varying risk of TB transmission and progression
during the migration process [40,42]. This is likely to be true also
for the proportion of patients with MDR-TB. However, very few data
have been reported specifically on yield of MDR-TB. Of 15 screening
studies included in a recent systematic review on pre-entry
screening programmes for TB in migrants to low-incidence coun-
tries, only three reported data on the number of cases of MDR-TB
identified within culture-confirmed cases of active TB [42]. Due
to the lack of screening outcome data from surveillance systems
[40,42], as well as very limited specific research on MDR-TB in the
context of migrant screening, the potential impact on early detec-
tion and interruption of MDR-TB transmission remains largely
unknown. However, transmission of TB from migrants to the gen-
eral population typically is low in host countries with good health-
care access for migrants [26,43e46].
Screening for latent MDR-TB is highly problematic because
current tests (tuberculin skin test and interferon-g release assays)
cannot distinguish between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant
TB, and cannot predict risk of reactivation. Moreover, the best
chemoprophylaxis for individuals with suspected latent MDR-TB
has not yet been established. There are extremely limited data on
the effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis for suspected MDR-TB
[47,48]. Furthermore, WHO did not recommend systematic pro-
phylaxis with second-line TB drugs in contacts of patients with
MDR-TB in its recent guidelines [49]. Clinical trials are needed to
inform any future recommendations.
Treatment outcomes in migrants
Globally, only 50% of MDR-TB patients successfully complete
treatment, with 24% lost to follow up or without outcome infor-
mation [15]. For extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), only 26% of
patients successfully complete treatment, with 25% lost to follow
up or without outcome information [15]. This gap is greater in
countries with a higher prevalence of drug-resistance [15], and is
relevant to low-incidence countries in the context of migration.
Some data suggest that migrants treated in low-incidence Eu-
ropean countries are less likely to have successful treatment out-
comes for MDR-TB than host populations. In a cohort study on
treatment outcomes for MDR-TB patients in the UK, 72.3% of mi-
grants had a successful treatment outcome, compared with 90% of
UK born (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.08e1.01; p 0.026) [50]. This may be
attributed to formal and informal barriers to testing and treat-
mentdincluding fears relating to legal status or government, lan-
guage and health literacy, lack of entitlement to services, and
inability to paydresulting in delays in presentation and poor
treatment outcomes. Such barriers are likely to be exacerbated by
increasingly restrictive health systems across Europe [2]. The
intensive, complex and lengthy treatment, and high pill burden, as
well as contextual factors like alcohol or drug use, homelessness
and social stigma, may further impact on treatment uptake and
adherence
for
TB
and
MDR-TB.
These
factors
undoubtedly
contribute to the acquisition of drug resistance [6,23,24,40,51].
However, the migration status of patients is often not recorded,
and research findings are inconsistent [52]. The limited data on
treatment outcomes for MDR-TB in migrants in low-incidence
countries in Europe point to the need for further research in
these communities, as well as the need for strategies to improve the
identification and treatment of MDR-TB in these hard-to-reach
groups. This is particularly pertinent in light of the shorter MDR-
TB regimen now recommended by WHO [53], which may help to
improve treatment completion and cure, although further trial data
are awaited.
Resource implications of treating and preventing MDR-TB in
migrants
Less than 25% of MDR-TB patients globally have been started on
treatment, yet it is unclear how many of these patients are migrants
residing in low-incidence countries in Europe [54]. A recent sys-
tematic review reported that the costs of treating MDR-TB (from
the provider perspective) were between US $1218 and $83,365 (in
low-income to high-income countries) in comparison to between
US $258 and $14,659 for drug-sensitive TB [55]. The highest pro-
portion of costs incurred is due to hospitalization (which is often
extensive in some high MDR-TB burden settings such as Russia),
followed by drugs and clinic visits.
Given the potential costs for host country health systems asso-
ciated with the identification and treatment of TB among migrants,
there may be advantages in supporting MDR-TB control efforts in
countries with high MDR-TB incidence. A decision analysis sug-
gested that it may be cost saving for low-incidence countries to
support improved TB care and prevention in high-incidence source
countries for migrants [56]. Such strategies may be particularly
effective for MDR-TB, given the increased costs associated with
MDR-TB treatment, and should be further investigated.
A cost-effectiveness analysis has shown that outpatient-based
models could lower costs per disability-adjusted life-year by as
much as 54% compared with inpatient-based models [57]. How-
ever, in low-incidence countries there may be an emphasis on the
hospitalization of patients with MDR-TB, and isolation within the
hospital context to prevent spread of disease, leading to increased
costs. Migrants are particularly vulnerable to the social and eco-
nomic consequences of TB and MDR-TB and costs associated with
treatment, and so specific social and financial support may be
needed to facilitate screening and treatment in these communities
[58]. Technology-based interventions including video-observed
therapy, mobile phone communication, or social-media-based
health literacy may help to overcome barriers to screening and

 treatment adherence in migrants [59]. The effectiveness of existing
protocols (e.g. risk assessments for low treatment adherence car-
ried out by TB services, and how this informs decisions about
treatment options) should also be assessed.
Further research into effective and cost-effective strategies to
increase the detection and treatment of MDR-TB in hard-to-reach
migrant populations in low-incidence countries is needed to pro-
vide more insight into the trade-offs between intensified screening,
investment in accessible and effective clinical care, and social
support for at-risk migrant groups to facilitate engagement with
services. Although these strategies may be costly, it is essential to
prioritize the availability and accessibility of care. Screening cannot
be meaningful without linkage to high-quality care, which ulti-
mately is necessary to reduce migrant mortality and morbidity, as
well as transmission to the wider population.
Conclusions and action points
Multidrug-resistant TB is more prevalent in migrant populations
in low-incidence countries in Europe than in host populations. At a
time when large numbers of migrants from high-incidence coun-
tries are migrating to Europe, there are insufficient data on the
prevalence of MDR-TB among migrants, or the impact on incidence
in receiving countries. MDR-TB may be acquired before, as well as
during or following migration, because of barriers to accessing
services, low treatment adherence, or increased risk of infection
due to social conditions in transit or in host countries. Although
transmission predominantly occurs between migrants, there is a
risk of transmission for both migrants and the native population.
Key findings and points of action are summarized in Table 2.
There is a clear imperative to optimize the quality of diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of MDR-TB in migrants. Barriers to care
include restrictions on access to health care for migrants as well as
informal barriers to service uptake. In some instances, disparities in
the availability of services (e.g. between eastern and western Eu-
ropean countries) may lead to health tourism. Compounding these
challenges is the lack of a diagnostic test to detect latent MDR-TB
and to predict the risk of disease re-activation, and high-quality
evidence for an effective prophylactic drug regimen.
Key research gaps include a lack of data on effective screening
strategies for MDR-TB or how routine practice should be adapted
across diverse health systems in Europe to improve treatment
outcomes in migrants at risk of low adherence to TB treatment or
with MDR-TB. There are also insufficient data on specific risk factors
for MDR-TB, patterns of acquisition and transmission, and treat-
ment outcomes in migrants in low-incidence countries in Europe.
The limited evidence-base means that there are currently shortfalls
in the delivery of effective and cost-effective screening and treat-
ment strategies in migrants. Improved routine public health sur-
veillance, as well as further research, is undoubtedly needed to
better understand the relationship between MDR-TB and migra-
tion, the impact screening may have on early detection or pre-
vention, and to quantify the consequences associated with a failure
to treat and prevent MDR-TB among migrants in Europe.
Improving the detection and treatment of infectious diseases in
migrants is essential to improve the health status of migrants, and
host countries must acknowledge their obligation to migrants'
human right to health. Specifically, there should be an emphasis on
targeting migrants from countries with a high incidence of TB to
improve the detection of MDR-TB (e.g. routinely testing all migrants
with TB for drug resistance), and facilitating access to treatment
(e.g. free MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment in any EU country, and
culturally competent care [60]). The development of coherent
guidelines is also a crucial next step to ensure the roll out of
effective and cost-effective approaches to the management and
prevention of MDR-TB in migrant populations in low-incidence
countries in Europe.
