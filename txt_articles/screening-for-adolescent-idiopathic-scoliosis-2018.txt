 Screening for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
US Preventive Services Task Force
Recommendation Statement
US Preventive Services Task Force
T
he US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes
recommendations about the effectiveness of specific
preventive care services for patients without obvious
related signs or symptoms.
It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the
benefits and harms of the service and an assessment of the bal-
ance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a ser-
vice in this assessment.
The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more
considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand
the evidence but individualize decision making to the specific
patient or situation. Similarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and
coverage decisions involve considerations in addition to the evi-
dence of clinical benefits and harms.
Summary of Recommendation and Evidence
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adoles-
cent idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18
years (I statement) (Figure 1).
Rationale
Importance
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine of
unknown cause with a Cobb angle (a measure of the curvature of
IMPORTANCE Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, a lateral curvature of the spine of unknown
cause with a Cobb angle of at least 10°, occurs in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years.
Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form and usually worsens during adolescence before
skeletal maturity. Severe spinal curvature may be associated with adverse long-term health
outcomes (eg, pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic
issues, and reduced quality of life). Early identification and effective treatment of mild
scoliosis could slow or stop curvature progression before skeletal maturity, thereby improving
long-term outcomes in adulthood.
OBJECTIVE To update the 2004 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommendation on screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents.
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of
screening for and treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
FINDINGS The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent idiopathic
scoliosis and health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found
inadequate evidence on treatment with exercise and surgery. It found adequate evidence
that treatment with bracing may slow curvature progression in adolescents with mild or
moderate curvature severity (Cobb angle <40° to 50°); however, evidence on the association
between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in
adulthood is inadequate. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of
treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and
that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
cannot be determined.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is
insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic
scoliosis in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. (I statement)

I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.

of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

 Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment
The USPSTF found no direct evidence regarding the effect of
screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on patient-centered
health outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the
treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle <50° at diagnosis) in
adolescents with exercise (2 small studies) or surgery (no studies)
or its effects on health outcomes or the degree of spinal curvature
in childhood or adulthood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence
(5 studies) that treatment with bracing may decrease curvature
progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature sever-
ity (an intermediate outcome). However, it found inadequate evi-
dence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature
in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood.
Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment
The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening,
such as psychological harms or harms associated with confirmatory
radiography. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine
the harms of treatment.
USPSTF Assessment
TheUSPSTFconcludesthatthecurrentevidenceisinsufficientand
that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent
idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.
Clinical Considerations
Patient Population Under Consideration
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and ado-
lescents aged 10 to 18 years (Figure 2). This recommendation does
not apply to children and adolescents presenting for evaluation of
back pain, breathing difficulties, abnormal radiography findings or
other imaging studies, or obvious deformities in spinal curvature.
Screening Tests
Most screening tests for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are non-
invasive. Screening is usually done by visual inspection of the
spine to look for asymmetry of the shoulders, shoulder blades,
and hips. In the United States, the forward bend test is commonly
used to screen for idiopathic scoliosis. First, a clinician visually
inspects the spine of a patient while the patient is standing
upright. Next, the patient stands with feet together and bends
forward at the waist with arms hanging and palms touching.
The clinician repeats the visual inspection of the spine.1,4 A scoli-
ometer, which measures the angle of trunk rotation, may be
used during the forward bend test. An angle of trunk rotation of
5° to 7° is often the threshold for referral for radiography.1 Other
screening tests include a humpometer, the plumb line test, and
Moiré topography (creating a 3-dimensional image of the surface
of a patient’
s back) (Table).
If idiopathic scoliosis is suspected, radiography is used to con-
firmthediagnosisandtoquantifythedegreeofcurvature(ie,theCobb
angle) and the Risser sign (the stage of ossification of the iliac
apophysis).1 US organizations that advocate screening recommend
the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement.
Treatment
Thegoaloftreatmentistodecreaseorstopprogressionofspinalcur-
vature during the period of adolescent growth prior to skeletal ma-
turity. Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is determined by
the degree of spinal curvature and the potential for further growth
and generally includes observation, bracing, surgery, and exercise.1
Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement
Potential Preventable Burden

toms.Generally,smallerspinalcurvaturesremainstable,whilelarger
curvatures tend to progress in severity.

This recommendation does not apply to children and adolescents presenting for evaluation of back pain or obvious deformities
in spinal curvature.
Adequate evidence indicates that currently available screening tests can accurately detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis when
used in combination. Radiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and also to quantify the degree of curvature (ie, the Cobb angle);
the Risser sign (the stage of ossification of the iliac apophysis) is used to monitor curve progression. 
Information about the benefits or harms of treatment of screen-detected adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is inadequate.
Treatment is determined by the degree of spinal curvature and the potential for further skeletal growth, and may include
observation, exercise, bracing, or surgery.

ence of back pain does not necessarily correlate with the degree of
spinalcurvatureinadulthood.Adultswithadolescentidiopathicsco-
liosis may have poor self-reported health, appearance, and social in-
teractions. Mortality is similar to that among unaffected adults.1
Potential Harms
Evidence on the harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic sco-
liosis is limited. False-positive results are an important potential
harm, with rates ranging from 0.8% to 21.5%.1,5,6 However, the
direct harms of screening are unclear. Potential harms of false-
positive results include unnecessary follow-up visits, increased can-
cer risk attributable to radiation exposure, overtreatment with
bracing, or psychosocial effects associated with the diagnosis of
clinically nonsignificant scoliosis.1
Current Practice
Various organizations have recommended routine screening for
scoliosis in children and adolescents since the 1980s.1,4 More than
half of US states either mandate or recommend school-based
screening for scoliosis.1,4,7 Children and adolescents are usually
screened with the forward bend test, with or without scoliometer
measurement.1,4
In general, patients with a Cobb angle of less than 20° are ob-
served without treatment; however, exercise may be recom-
mended at this time. Patients with a Cobb angle greater than 30°
or a Cobb angle of 20° to 30° that progresses 5° or more over 3 to 6
months are treated with bracing. Patients with a Cobb angle of 40°
to 50° may be treated with bracing or surgery, while those with a
Cobb angle greater than 50° typically require surgery.1
Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
The USPSTF identified several research gaps. Prospective, con-
trolled screening studies that allow for comparison of screened and
nonscreened populations and different screening settings, person-
nel, and procedures are needed. Good-quality studies with pro-
spective identification of cohorts at the time of diagnosis (eg, from
geographical areas with and without routine screening for adoles-
cent idiopathic scoliosis) or treatment (eg, treated vs observed
cohorts) for the purpose of long-term follow-up are important.
High-quality studies on the potential harms of screening and treat-
ment are also needed. Additional studies to help determine
whether individual characteristics (eg, body mass index) may influ-
ence response to bracing treatment would be helpful. Studies on
long-term outcomes are needed and should stratify results by
degree of spinal curvature at diagnosis and at skeletal maturity.
Better information on long-term outcomes such as pulmonary dis-
orders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues,
and quality of life would be helpful. Good-quality studies on treat-
ment with exercise, bracing, and surgery among screen-detected
patients are needed. Studies conducted in primary care settings are
also needed.
Discussion
Burden of Disease
The prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (defined as
a Cobb angle �10°) ranges from 1% to 3% among children and
adolescents aged 10 to 16 years.1,2 Cumulative incidence estimates
for spinal curvature of greater severity are 1.0% (Cobb angle
�20°) and 0.4% (Cobb angle �40°). Prevalence varies by sex,
ranging from 0.15% to 0.66% in boys and from 0.24% to 3.10% in
girls.1 Prevalence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 10° is similar
among girls and boys, but girls are 10 times more likely than boys
to progress to a Cobb angle of 30° or greater. Girls are also 5 times
more likely than boys to have a Cobb angle of 20° or greater.1 The
adverse effects of progressive scoliosis vary depending on its
severity and include treatment costs, cosmetic deformity, reduced
quality of life, disability, chronic back pain, social and psychological
effects, functional limitations, and pulmonary disorders.1

Table. Screening Tests for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
Screening Test
Description
Forward bend test
The child bends forward at the waist until the spine is parallel to the horizontal plane. The examiner checks the child’
s back
for rib humps or other spinal asymmetries. This test is commonly used in school-based scoliosis screening programs,
with or without a scoliometer.
Scoliometer
A noninvasive, handheld instrument used to measure the angle of trunk rotation. The examiner places the instrument on the
child’
s spine during the forward bend test and reads the angle. An angle of trunk rotation of 5° to 7° is the recommended threshold
for referral to radiography.
Humpometer
A series of movable strips are placed along the child’
s back perpendicular to the spine. The examiner locks the strips into place,
transfers the contour lines to graph paper, adds the size of rib humps and depressions, and obtains a measure of back deformity.
A back deformity of ≥5 mm may indicate a positive screening result.
Plumb line test
The examiner holds a plumb line at the child’
s C7 vertebra (in the neck) while the child is standing upright and allows the line
to hang below the hips. The amount to which the plumb line moves from the center of the spine is measured.
Moiré topography
A specialized device projects contour lines, called Moiré fringes, on the child’
s back. The examiner takes a photograph
of this projection and counts the number of asymmetric contour lines. A child with ≥2 asymmetric Moiré fringes is usually
referred to radiography.

Sensitivity and Specificity
Screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliom-

tivity (93.8% [95% CI, 93.3%-94.3%]) and specificity (99.2%
[95% CI, 99.2%-99.2%]).9-11 The forward bend test combined
with scoliometer measurement had lower screening accuracy
(71.1% sensitivity [95% CI, 54.1%-84.6%] and 97.1% specificity
[95% CI, 96.3%-97.7%]).5 The forward bend test alone had 84.4%
sensitivity (95% CI, 67.2%-94.7%) and 95.2% specificity (95% CI,
94.3%-95.9%), the humpometer had 93.8% sensitivity (95%
CI, 79.2%-99.2%) and 78.5% specificity (95% CI, 76.9%-80.0%),
the scoliometer had 90.6% sensitivity (95% CI, 75.0%-98.0%)
and 80.7% specificity (95% CI, 79.1%-82.1%), and Moiré topogra-
phy had 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 84.2%-100%) and 85.4%
specificity (95% CI, 84.0%-86.7%).6
False-Positive and False-Negative Results
One study evaluated screening with a combination of the for-
ward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moiré topography
and reported a low false-negative rate (6.2%) and the lowest
false-positive rate (0.8%).1,6,11 One study of the forward bend test

(ie, humpometer or the forward bend test alone).1,6
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Intervention
or Treatment
Bracing
The USPSTF found 7 studies on the effectiveness of treatment of
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Five studies (n = 651) evaluated the
effectiveness of 3 different types of braces. The 5 studies included
3 trials (1 fair-quality randomized clinical trial [RCT] and 1 fair-quality
and 1 good-quality controlled clinical trial [CCT] [n = 347])15-18 and 2
observational studies (1 good-quality prospective observational
study and 1 fair-quality retrospective observational study
[n = 304]).19,20 Two trials were stopped early for observation of
benefit. The good-quality CCT began as an RCT but was changed to
a patient preference controlled trial to boost enrollment after low
acceptance of random assignment.1,17,18

(95% CI, 26%-82%).1,3,18 BrAIST was the only study that reported
quality-of-life outcomes associated with bracing; outcomes were
similar between treatment groups.
One study, the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) bracing co-
hort, assessed Cobb angle in adulthood.19,20 Of the original 106
participants enrolled at 2 centers in the SRS bracing cohort, 77
were re-evaluated as adults (mean age, 32 years). The study dem-
onstrated that the average Cobb angle at skeletal maturity was
similar in the observed and treated groups (30.6° vs 27.7°, respec-
tively; P = .067). At follow-up in adulthood, the average Cobb angle
had increased by an average of 4.4° (SD, 4.1°) in observed partici-
pants and by 6.4° (SD, 5.8°) in treated participants. Only 7.5% of
observed participants and 5.4% of treated participants had curva-
ture progression past 45° at the time of follow-up (P > .99).1,3
Exercise
Two Italian trials (n = 184) evaluated the effectiveness of exer-
cise treatment (tailored physiotherapeutic, scoliosis-specific
exercise).21,22 The trials used control groups in which participants
were assigned to an exercise program not designed to specifically
treat scoliosis. Trial participants had a Cobb angle ranging from
10° to 25°; skeletal maturity ranged from a Risser sign of 0 to 3.
Patients were older than 10 years.1
In the good-quality RCT (n = 110)21 and the fair-quality CCT
(n = 74),22 the intervention group showed significant improve-
ment compared with a generic exercise control group at the
12-monthfollow-up.IntheRCT,interventiongroupparticipantshad
a Cobb angle reduction of 4.9°, compared with an increase of 2.8°
in the control group (P < .001).1,3,21,22 Quality-of-life measures im-
proved at 12 months in the intervention group compared with mar-
ginal improvements or unchanging measures in the control group.
At the end of the 12-month treatment period in the CCT, the inter-
vention group had a decrease of 0.67° in average magnitude of all
spinal curvatures compared with an increase of 1.38° in the control
group (P < .05).1,3,21,22
Surgery
The USPSTF found no studies of surgical treatment in screening-
relevant populations that met inclusion criteria.
Association Between Adolescent Spinal Curvature Severity and
Adult Health Outcomes
The USPSTF found no studies that directly addressed whether
changes in the severity of spinal curvature in adolescence results in
changesinadulthealthoutcomes.TheUSPSTFfoundnostudiesthat
reported health outcomes stratified by degree of spinal curvature
at skeletal maturity. Two fair-quality studies provided data on adult
health outcomes, stratified by the type of treatment received in
adolescence.1,3,23-25
The USPSTF considered 2 fair-quality retrospective observa-
tional long-term follow-up analyses (n = 339) of adults diagnosed
with idiopathic scoliosis in adolescence.1,3,23-25 Adult outcomes
were stratified by the type of treatment received in adolescence
(bracing or surgery). Quality of life, as measured by the Scoliosis
Research Society 22 (SRS-22) Patient Questionnaire or the
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, was not significantly different
between observed and treated participants at follow-up in adult-
hood. No significant differences were found between braced and
surgically treated participants in the Oswestry Disability Index or in
general well-being, self-esteem, and social activity. Pulmonary and
pregnancy outcomes were also not significantly different between
braced and surgically treated participants. However, braced partici-
pants rated their body appearance as more distorted than did
untreated participants and reported more negative treatment
experiences than those treated with surgery.1,3,23-25
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening for
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. False-positive rates ranged from
0.8% for the forward bend test combined with scoliometer mea-
surement and Moiré topography to 21.5% for hump assessment
alone. Potential harms associated with false-positive results include
psychological harms, chest radiation, and other harms of unneces-
sary treatment.
Potential harms of bracing include skin problems, body pain,
physical limitations, anxiety, and depression. Complications of sur-
gery include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and death. The
USPSTF found no studies that assessed the harms of treatment
with surgery or exercise. Harms of bracing were reported in 1 good-
quality study (n = 242).17,18 In this RCT, intervention group partici-
pants were more likely to experience skin problems under the
brace than control group participants (12/146 vs 0/96, respec-
tively). Intervention group participants more commonly reported
nonback body pain than control group participants (12/146 vs 2/96,
respectively). The study reported low rates of anxiety and depres-
sion. Three of 146 participants in the intervention group reported
anxiety and depression compared with 1 of 96 participants in the
control group. One of the intervention group participants reported
a serious adverse event (anxiety and depression requiring hospital-
ization), compared with no participants in the control group. The
intervention and control groups had similar rates of abnormal
breast development, neurologic symptoms, and gastrointestinal or
respiratory symptoms.17,18
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent
idiopathic scoliosis and health outcomes. The USPSTF found
adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can
detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis but no evidence on the
harms of screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on
treatment with exercise and surgery; it found adequate evidence
that treatment with bracing may slow curvature progression in
adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity. However,
the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association
between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-
term health outcomes in adulthood. The USPSTF found inadequate
evidence on the harms of treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF con-
cludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance
of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scolio-
sis cannot be determined.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Mild or moderate idiopathic scoliosis (ie, Cobb angle of <40°
to 50°) is often asymptomatic in adolescence. In addition, the
majority of cases of scoliosis will not substantially progress during

 adolescence. The likelihood of progression in adulthood is small for
persons with a spinal curvature of less than 30° at skeletal maturity.
However, there is no validated way to easily identify which cases of
asymptomatic scoliosis will worsen during adolescence and lead to
poor long-term outcomes.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for
public comment on the USPSTF website from May 30 to June 26,
2017. Many comments expressed concern about the change in let-
ter grade (from a D grade to an I statement). In response, the
USPSTF added language in the “Update of Previous USPSTF Rec-
ommendation”section to explain the change in grade. Some com-
ments sought clarification of who the recommendation applies to.
The USPSTF clarified this in the “Patient Population Under Consid-
eration”section. Other comments expressed concern that the evi-
dence needed to change the recommendation grade is unattain-
able. The USPSTF added language to address this in the “Research
Needs and Gaps”section.
Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation
This recommendation updates the 2004 USPSTF recommen-
dation, in which the USPSTF recommended against routine
screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents
(D recommendation).8 In 2004, the USPSTF found fair evidence
that treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis leads to health
benefits (ie, decreased pain and disability) in a small proportion of
persons. The USPSTF bounded the harms of treatment as moder-
ate (eg, unnecessary brace wear or unnecessary referral to spe-
cialty care). Therefore, at that time, the USPSTF concluded that
the harms of screening exceeded the potential benefits.8
To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned
a systematic review of the evidence. Because of new research,
the USPSTF determined that it no longer has moderate certainty
that the harms of treatment outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF
found no direct evidence of a benefit of screening for adolescent
idiopathic scoliosis on health outcomes. A growing body of evi-
dence suggests that brace treatment can interrupt or slow scolio-
sis progression; however, evidence on whether reducing spinal
curvature in adolescence has a long-term effect on health in
adulthood is inadequate. Evidence on the effects of exercise and
surgery on health or spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood is
insufficient. Although the USPSTF previously found that treat-
ment has moderate harms, a change in the analytic framework,
outcomes, and applicability of older evidence resulted in the
USPSTF assessing the evidence on harms of treatment as inad-
equate. As a result, the USPSTF has determined that the current
evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and
harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, leading the
USPSTF to issue an I statement.
Recommendations of Others
Several national specialty groups have published statements in
support of screening. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Sur-
geons, the Scoliosis Research Society, the Pediatric Orthopaedic
Society of North America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics
advocate screening for scoliosis in girls at 10 and 12 years and once
in male adolescents at 13 or 14 years as part of medical home pre-
ventive services, if screening is performed by well-trained screen-
ing personnel.26 The UK National Screening Society does not rec-
ommend screening for scoliosis, given the uncertainty surrounding
the effectiveness of screening and treatment.27 However, the Inter-
national Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treat-
ment recommends screening for idiopathic scoliosis through
school-based programs, and that screening should be performed
by clinicians who specialize in spinal deformities.28
