SUMMARY 
Background: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of EPA and DHA supplementation on the Omega-3 
Index (O3I) in men and women with abdominal obesity and subclinical inflammation.  
Methods: In a double-blind controlled crossover study, 48 men and 106 women were randomized to a sequence of three 
treatment phases: 1- 2.7 g/d of EPA, 2- 2.7 g/d of DHA, and 3- 3 g/d of corn oil. The 10-week treatment phases were 
separated by nine-week washouts.  
Results: The increase in the O3I after DHA (+5.6% vs. control, P<0.0001) was significantly greater than after EPA (+3.3% 
vs. control, P<0.0001; DHA vs. EPA, P<0.0001).  
Conclusions: The increase in the O3I is greater with high dose DHA than with high dose EPA. The extent to which such 
differences between EPA and DHA in increasing the O3I relates to long-term cardiovascular risk needs to be investigated in 
the future.

ABSTRACT 
Background: Recent studies suggest that eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids have distinct effects 
on cardiometabolic risk factors. The Omega-3 Index (O3I), which is calculated as the proportion of EPA and DHA in red 
blood cell (RBC) membranes, has been inversely associated with the risk of coronary heart diseases and coronary mortality. 
The objective of this study was to compare the effects of EPA and DHA supplementation on the O3I in men and women 
with abdominal obesity and subclinical inflammation.  
Methods: In a double-blind controlled crossover study, 48 men and 106 women with abdominal obesity and subclinical 
inflammation were randomized to a sequence of three treatment phases: 1- 2.7 g/d of EPA, 2- 2.7 g/d of DHA, and 3- 3 g/d 
of corn oil (0 g of EPA+DHA). All supplements were provided as 3x1 g capsules for a total of 3 g/d. The 10-week treatment 
phases were separated by nine-week washouts. RBC membrane fatty acid composition and O3I were assessed at baseline 
and the end of each phase. Differences in O3I between treatments were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures.  
Results: The increase in the O3I after supplementation with DHA (+5.6% compared with control, P<0.0001) was 
significantly greater than after EPA (+3.3% compared with control, P<0.0001; DHA vs. EPA, P<0.0001). Compared to 
control, DHA supplementation decreased (-0.8%, P<0.0001) while EPA increased (+2.5%, P<0.0001) proportion of 
docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in RBCs (DHA vs. EPA, P<0.0001). The baseline O3I was higher in women than in men 
(6.3% vs. 5.8%, P=0.011). The difference between DHA and EPA in increasing the O3I tended to be higher in men than in 
women (+2.6% vs. +2.2% respectively, P for the treatment by sex interaction = 0.0537).

Conclusions: The increase in the O3I is greater with high dose DHA supplementation than with high dose EPA, which is 
consistent with the greater potency of DHA to modulate cardiometabolic risk factors. The extent to which such differences 
between EPA and DHA in increasing the O3I relates to long-term cardiovascular risk needs to be investigated in the future.

INTRODUCTION 
Considerable research has been conducted to determine the association between long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty 
acids (LCn3-PUFAs) consumption and cardiovascular risk. LCn3-PUFAs modulate a variety of cardiometabolic risk factors 
such as blood lipids, blood pressure, thrombosis and inflammation.1 Fatty fish and supplements, often combining 
eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA), are the main dietary sources of LCn3-PUFAs. There is 
emerging evidence suggesting that EPA and DHA exert different effects on blood lipids and inflammation markers.2,3 
However, such evidence is limited, most studies to date having assessed these effects using a mixture of EPA and DHA in 
different forms and proportions. Little is known with regard to the specific effects of EPA and DHA on metabolic pathways 
and biological processes underlying cardiometabolic health in humans.  
The fatty acid composition of cell membranes influences their physico-chemical properties and, ultimately, organ 
functions.1,4 The Omega-3 Index (O3I), which is calculated as the relative content of red blood cell (RBC) membranes as 
EPA plus DHA, reflects the phospholipid LCn3-PUFA composition of major organs,4 including cardiac tissue.4,5 A high O3I 
(8-12%) has been associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and coronary mortality in epidemiological 
studies.6,7 Supplementation with EPA+DHA is recommended by various health agencies including the American Heart 
Association for secondary CHD prevention or management of plasma triglycerides (TG).8 Yet, whether EPA and DHA have 
  
 
8 
distinct effect on the O3I is currently unknown. Considering that the O3I is modifiable by diet,5 studies are required to 
compare the effects of different LCn3-PUFAs on this promising clinical tool for the management of diet-related CHD risk.  
The objective of this study was to compare the effects of high doses of re-esterified EPA and DHA on the O3I using a 
randomized double-blind controlled crossover study design, in men and women with abdominal obesity and subclinical 
inflammation. We hypothesized that the O3I increases more with DHA than with EPA. Based on previous studies of fatty 
acid metabolism in men and women,9 we also hypothesized that the increase in the O3I with both EPA and DHA is greater 
among women than among men.   
PATIENTS AND METHODS  
Study design: This analysis is based on data from a double-blind randomized, controlled crossover study with three 
treatment phases (1- EPA, 2- DHA and 3- corn oil as control), for which the primary outcome was the change in C-reactive 
concentrations (CRP) concentrations. Details of the study design and results of primary analyses have been published 
previously.10 Briefly, each treatment phase had a median duration of 10 weeks and were separated by a nine-week washout. 
Randomization of participants to one of six treatment sequences was performed using an in-house computer program and 
was stratified by sex. Participants were supplemented with three identical 1 g capsules of >90% purified LCn3-PUFA per 
day providing either 2.7 g/d EPA or 2.7 g/d DHA. Corn oil was used as a control (0 g/d EPA+DHA). LCn3-PUFA 
supplements were formulated as re-esterified TG and provided by Douglas Laboratories. Participants were instructed to 
  
 
9 
maintain a constant body weight during the course of the study. They were also counseled on how to exclude fatty fish 
(including salmon, tuna, mackerel, and herring), other LCn3-PUFA supplements, flax products, walnuts, and LCn3-PUFA-
enriched products during the three study phases.  
Study population: Primary eligibility criteria were to have abdominal obesity based on the International Diabetes Federation 
sex specific cut-offs (80 cm for women, 94 cm for men)11 in combination with a screening plasma CRP concentration >1 
mg/L but <10 mg/L. Subjects had to be otherwise healthy. Adult subjects (18 and 70 years of age) were recruited at the 
Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (INAF). Body weight had to be stable for at least three months prior to 
randomization. Exclusion criteria were plasma CRP >10 mg/L at screening, extreme dyslipidemias such as familial 
hypercholesterolemia, having a personal history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (CHD, cerebrovascular disease or 
peripheral arterial disease), taking medications or substances known to affect inflammation (e.g. steroids, binging alcohol), 
and use of LCn3-PUFA supplements within two months of study onset. All participants signed an informed consent 
document approved by local Ethics Committees at the beginning of the study and the study protocol was registered March 4, 
2013 at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01810003).  
Anthropometry: Anthropometric measures including waist and hip circumferences were obtained according to standardized 
procedures.12 Body composition was measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI). 
  
 
10 
Dietary habits: Food intakes during each phase was monitored using a validated quantitative web-based, self-administered 
food frequency questionnaire at the end of each treatment phase.13 
Risk factor assessment: Serum total cholesterol (C), TG and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C were assessed on a 
Roche/Hitachi Modular (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s specifications and using 
proprietary reagents. Plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C concentrations were calculated using the Friedewald 
Equation. Total C, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG were measured twice on consecutive days at the end of each treatment. The 
mean of the two measurements were used in the analyses. Treatment-specific baseline values were measured once. All 
personnel involved in the measurements of the study outcomes were blinded to treatments. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was 
defined using the International Diabetes Federation criteria.11 
RBC membrane fatty acids measurements: RBC membrane fatty acid composition was measured at baseline and at the end 
of each treatment phase. RBC membrane was analyzed by OmegaQuant Analytics, LLC, (Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United 
States) according to the Omega-3 Index® methodology as modified from Harris et al.14 Fatty acid methyl esters were 
generated from erythrocytes by transesterification with boron trifluoride and analyzed by gas chromatography. Fatty acids 
were identified by comparison with a standard mixture of fatty acids characteristics of RBCs. Each fatty acid is expressed as 
a weight percent of total identified fatty acids after a response factor correction (based on calibration curves) was applied to 
each fatty acid. The O3I represents the sum of EPA and DHA expressed as a percent of total RBC fatty acids.14 The RBC 
  
 
11 
composition at baseline and after each phase is presented in Supplemental Table 1. Baseline RBC composition for men and 
women is presented in Supplemental Table 2. 
Gene expression of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism: Fasting fresh blood was collected in PAXgene Blood RNA 
tubes (Becton Dickinson, Canada) after each treatment in a subsample of 44 randomly selected participants for gene 
expression analyses. RNA was isolated using a PAXgene RNA-kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, 
Canada). Quantity of total RNA was measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, 
Wilmington, DE, USA) and total RNA quality was assayed on an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was performed on 1.5-2 µg total RNA. cDNA corresponding to 20 ng of total RNA 
was used to perform fluorescent-based Realtime PCR quantification using the LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, 
Mannheim, DE). The genes targeted were ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 and 5 (ELOVL2 and ELOVL5) and fatty acids 
desaturase 2, delta-5 and delta-6 (FADS1 and FADS2). Sequence primers and gene description are available in the 
Supplemental Table 3. Values were normalized to expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 
Statistical analyses: Differences in RBC membrane fatty acid composition between treatments were assessed using the 
MIXED procedure for repeated measures in SAS (v9.3, Cary, NC), with treatment as fixed effect and a compound symmetry 
or autoregressive covariance matrix to account for within-subject correlations. The change vs. the control treatment (post 
  
 
12 
treatment EPA minus control and post treatment DHA minus control) was used as the dependent variable in all analyses.15 
To be included in the analyses, subjects had to have completed the control phase plus at least one of the two treatment 
phases. Using this approach, the main treatment effect in the models reflected the direct comparison of EPA and DHA. 
Adjustment for multiple comparisons was not necessary as the main treatment effect had only two levels. In the same model, 
the change vs. control for each treatment was tested against the null hypothesis by the LSMEANS statement in the MIXED 
procedure. Potential confounders of the outcome measure response to treatment, mainly body mass index, age, sex, energy 
intake were added to models and results from analyses based on the most parsimonious models (i.e. retaining only the 
variables that contributed significantly to variations in any given study outcome) are shown. We considered sex, sequence of 
treatments and baseline values interaction by adding interaction terms with the main treatment effect into the model 
statement in the MIXED procedure. The skewness in the distribution of model residuals was considered and data were log-
transformed when required. Correlations were tested using Pearson’s correlations coefficients.

RESULTS 
Subjects’ characteristics: Of the 173 eligible men and women, 154 were randomized to treatment sequences. Characteristics 
of the 154 randomized participants at screening are shown by sex in Table 1. A total of 123 participants have completed 
both the DHA and the control phases, and 121 participants have completed both the EPA and the control phases.  
Fatty acid composition of RBC membranes: Figure 1 shows the individual O3I response to EPA and DHA 
supplementation. The O3I increased with EPA and DHA in all but one participant. Self-reported compliance for this 
participant was high (93%). Both EPA (+3.3%, P<0.0001) and DHA supplementation (+5.6%, P<0.0001) significantly 
increased the O3I in RBC membranes compared with control (Table 2). DHA led to a greater increase in the O3I than EPA 
in all participants (Figure 1). Thus, the increase in the O3I with DHA was significantly greater than with EPA (P<0.0001). 
The correlation between the change in O3I with EPA and with DHA (vs. control) was r=0.65 (P<0.0001). DPA levels in 
RBC increased after EPA (+2.5%, P<0.0001) but decreased after DHA (-0.8%, P<0.0001) compared with control (EPA vs. 
DHA, P<0.0001, Table 2).  
The increase in O3I was not statistically different between men and women after EPA (+3.1% and +3.4% respectively) and 
after DHA (+5.7% and +5.6% respectively) (Figure 2). However, the difference between DHA and EPA in increasing the 
O3I tended to be higher in men than in women (+2.6% vs. +2.2% respectively, P for the treatment-by-sex interaction = 
  
 
14 
0.054). This apparent difference between men and women was independent of baseline EPA (P=0.11) and DHA (P=0.19) 
levels as well as of the baseline O3I (P=0.12, not shown).  
The change in the O3I was inversely correlated with the corresponding change in TG after both EPA and DHA (r=-0.21, 
P=0.017 and r=-0.24, P=0.0076 respectively) and correlated positively with the change in LDL-C after DHA only (r=0.19, 
P=0.039 for DHA and r=-0.02, P=0.86 for EPA). Changes in the O3I with EPA and DHA did not correlate significantly with 
changes in other biomarkers, including inflammation markers. Finally, there was no carryover effect of any treatment on the 
O3I (not shown). 
Gene expression of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism: There was no significant difference in the expression of 
ELOVL2 and ELOVL5 and FADS1 and FADS2 in whole blood cells between EPA and DHA (Table 3). EPA 
supplementation increased the expression of ELOVL2 by 24% compared with control (P=0.0084).

DISCUSSION 
A high O3I, which reflects a relatively high content of EPA and DHA in the membranes of RBCs, has been associated with a 
lower risk of CHD and mortality in observational studies.6,7 While there is emerging evidence suggesting that DHA may be 
more potent than EPA in modifying cardiometabolic risk,2,3 their respective impacts on the O3I have not been thoroughly 
examined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized double-blind controlled crossover trial to show that the 
increase in O3I is significantly greater after supplementation with high dose DHA (2.7 g/d) than with a comparable dose of 
EPA.  
Grimsgaard et al.16 found in a parallel study that the increase in serum phospholipid EPA (+4.7%) was greater after 
supplementation with 3.8 g/d of ethyl ester EPA for 7 weeks than the corresponding increase of serum phospholipid DHA 
(+3.2%) after a supplementation of with 3.6 g/d of ethyl ester DHA. More recently, Tsunoda et al.17 have shown than the 
increase in EPA (+1.9%) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after supplementation with 1.8 g/d of EPA compared to an 
olive oil control was similar to the corresponding increase in DHA (+2.0%) after 1.8 g/d of DHA supplementation. Authors 
of these two studies did not report the changes in O3I with EPA and DHA supplementation. Our data further indicated that 
the relative content of DPA in RBC was increased after EPA and reduced after DHA compared with control. This is 
consistent with results from Tsunoda et al.17 This increase in DPA levels after supplementation with EPA was also 
consistent with the observed increase in the expression of ELOVL2, which catalyzes the elongation of EPA to DPA. Since 
  
 
16 
DPA is not accounted for in the calculation of the O3I, “disappearance” of EPA in RBC through in vivo elongation to DPA 
does in large part explain the smaller increase in O3I with EPA compared with DHA in our study. In fact, an index based on 
the sum of EPA, DPA and DHA in RBCs would have increased more after high dose supplementation with EPA than after 
supplementation with a corresponding dose of DHA (+5.8% vs. +4.8% respectively, P<0.0001, not shown). 
Levels of DPA in RBCs have been inversely associated with TG and CRP concentrations in healthy adults following 
supplementation with LCn3-PUFAs (EPA+DPA+DHA),18 suggesting that DPA may also be partly responsible for some of 
the biological and cardioprotective effects attributed to LCn3-PUFA.19 Lower levels of DPA in serum or plasma have been 
associated with greater risk of acute myocardial infarction,20 total mortality,21 cardiovascular mortality21 and nonfatal 
myocardial infarction.22 DPA concentrations in different tissues (total plasma lipids, plasma or RBC phospholipids and 
adipose tissue) have also been inversely associated with fatal coronary heart disease in a recent meta-analysis of 19 
epidemiological studies (total N=45,637).23 On the other hand, data from the present study indicate that the correlation 
between the O3I based on EPA and DHA and the sum of EPA+DPA+DHA in RBC is 0.97 after DHA supplementation, 0.93 
after EPA supplementation and 0.92 after the control (not shown, P<0.0001 for all). Such strong correlations suggest little 
added contribution of DPA to the predictive value of the O3I. Consistent with this, addition of DPA did not significantly 
improve the mortality risk prediction of the O3I in the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study.24 Although a growing 
body of evidence suggests that DPA may be a highly bioactive compound, studies are needed to dissect out its contribution 
to CHD risk from that of EPA and DHA, which are also strongly correlated with CHD risk.25   
  
 
17 
ELOVL and FADS are the enzymes responsible of the elongation of EPA to DPA and DPA to DHA. Grimsgaard et al.16 
estimated the change in the activities of the FADS1 and FADS2 after seven weeks of DHA (3.6 g/d), EPA (3.8 g/d) or corn 
oil (4 g/d) supplementation, using ratios of phospholipid fatty acids proportions in serum. Estimated FADS2 activity was 
increased while estimated FADS1 activity was decreased after DHA supplementation compared with baseline. 
Supplementation with EPA increased estimated FADS1 activity but had no impact on FADS2 activity compared with 
baseline.16 In our study, supplementation with high dose EPA or DHA had no significant impact on either FADS1 or FADS2 
gene expression in whole blood cells compared with the control corn oil treatment. It is not entirely surprising that estimated 
FADS1/2 activities based on fatty acids ratios and analysis of gene expression of these enzymes in whole blood cells yielded 
inconsistent results among existing studies, considering the complex relationship with actual activities of the corresponding 
enzymes. 
EPA levels in RBC increased significantly after high dose supplementation with DHA. This is consistent with data having 
demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship between EPA levels in blood and the dose of supplemented DHA, which most 
likely attributable to retro-conversion of DHA into EPA.26 The fatty acid content of RBC are expressed as a relative weight 
of all identified fatty acids. It is therefore difficult to assess if the reduction in the proportion of DPA after DHA 
supplementation is due to further retro-conversion to EPA, or to an increase in the proportion of other fatty acids. 
  
 
18 
In vivo conversion rate of ALA to EPA and to DHA is estimated at 8-20% and 0.5-9% respectively,27 with higher rates 
among women of reproductive age than among men.9 The regulatory effect of estrogens combined with a lower muscle mass 
may result in a smaller proportion of ALA being channelled towards beta-oxidation in women, and thus a greater proportion 
of ALA being converted into EPA and DHA.9 This suggests potential sex-dependent difference in the response to dietary 
LCn3-PUFA. While the effects EPA and DHA supplementation on DPA and DHA levels were similar among men and 
women in the present study (not shown), women compared with men accumulated more EPA in their RBC after 
supplementation with EPA (+4.0% vs. +3.5%, respectively, P=0.0002, not shown). Our study further showed that the 
increase in the O3I with EPA and DHA tended to be higher in men than in women. Self-reported fish consumption and 
compliance were similar between men and women (not shown) and thus differences in the O3I response to EPA and DHA 
are unlikely to be explained by these factors. This apparent sex-dependent difference in the response to EPA and DHA 
supplementation and consequences in terms of cardiovascular risk in men and women needs further investigation.  
Albert et al.7 have shown that men in the top quartile of the whole blood EPA+DPA+DHA distribution in the Physicians’ 
Health Study (corresponding to an average O3I of 6.9%)6 had a 90% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than men in the 
lowest quartile (corresponding to an average O3I of 3.8%)6. In the present study, the O3I after DHA was 2.3% greater than 
after EPA supplementation. Data from epidemiological studies would therefore suggest a greater benefit of DHA compared 
with EPA on risk of CVD.10,28,29 However, the greater increase in LDL-C concentrations with high dose DHA compared to 
EPA also needs to be factored in when assessing the impact of LCn3-PUFA on CVD risk.30 We have shown that the 
  
 
19 
reduction in serum TG, interleukin-18 and the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, as well as the increase in serum HDL-C, 
adiponectin and LDL-C were significantly more important after high dose supplementation with DHA than after EPA 
supplementation.10 The extent to which the greater improvements in inflammation markers and in HDL-C with DHA 
compared with EPA counterbalances the potential risk associated with higher LDL-C is uncertain.10 While changes in the 
O3I predicted concurrent changes in TG after both DHA and EPA, this was not the case for the change in LDL-C, which 
correlated with changes in the O3I only after DHA. Correlation analyses also revealed that the change in the O3I was a poor 
predictor of the response of other cardiometabolic risk factors to EPA and DHA. Very few studies thus far have assessed and 
compared the individual contributions of EPA and DHA to the association between the O3I and CVD risk, as well as to its 
overall predictive value. Additional intervention studies are therefore needed to determine potential benefits of a long term 
DHA vs. EPA supplementation on the O3I as it relates to cardiovascular outcomes.  
Our use of a crossover study design had many advantages including attenuation of residual confounding and increase in 
statistical power. The large sample size of this carefully controlled randomized trial also provided power to detect small 
changes in RBC composition. The composition of RBCs tracked well with each supplementation phase, reflecting high 
compliance to treatments and high quality data. One risk of crossover design studies pertains to potential carryover effects of 
treatments. However, we found no evidence of carryover effects on changes in the O3I after EPA and DHA 
supplementation, indicating that washout plus intervention periods were of sufficient duration to eliminate the effect of 
preceding treatments (data not shown). The effects of EPA and DHA on the O3I were compared to 3 g of corn oil as control, 
  
 
20 
which slightly decreased EPA and DPA relative content in RBC (-0.07% and -0.11% respectively, P<0.05, not shown), but 
had no effect on DHA content (+0.15%, P=0.16, not shown) and on the O3I (+0.01%, P=0.66, not shown) compared with 
baseline. Most previous controlled studies on LCn3-PUFA have also used low doses of vegetable oils as a control and to that 
extent, our study design is similar to previous ones on this topic.3  
CONCULSIONS 
Data from this randomized double-blind crossover study shows that the increase in the O3I is numerically greater after 
supplementation for 10 weeks with 2.7 g/d of DHA than after 2.7 g/d of EPA. This difference may simply reflect the fact 
that a proportion of EPA is elongated into DPA, which is not included in the O3I calculation. Data also suggested that the 
O3I may increase slightly more in men than in women after DHA supplementation. Additional studies are needed to better 
understand how such differences in the net change in O3I after supplementation with high dose DHA compared with EPA 
relate to the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.

Figure 1. Individual variation in changes of the Omega-3 Index (O3I) after EPA and DHA supplementation, vs. 
control. Each bar represents the change (%) in the O3I after EPA or DHA supplementation for one study participant. Data 
are sorted to show the range of variation and both EPA (grey) and DHA (black) are presented in the same column for one 
subject. The O3I increased more with DHA than with EPA in all individuals. Data of two participants were not presented 
here because having both completed the DHA phase only.   
Figure 2. Difference in change of Omega-3 Index (O3I) after EPA and DHA supplementation, vs. control in men and 
women (%).  Values are means ± SEM. * P <0.0001 for the treatment-specific effect vs. control for EPA and DHA. The 
increase in O3I was higher after DHA than after EPA supplementation for both men and women. We found no difference 
between men and women response to EPA and DHA supplementation.
