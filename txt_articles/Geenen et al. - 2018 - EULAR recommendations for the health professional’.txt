AbstRAct
Pain is the predominant symptom for people with 
inflammatory arthritis (IA) and osteoarthritis (OA) 
mandating the development of evidence-based 
recommendations for the health professional’s approach 
to pain management. A multidisciplinary task force 
including professionals and patient representatives 
conducted a systematic literature review of systematic 
reviews to evaluate evidence regarding effects on 
pain of multiple treatment modalities. Overarching 
principles and recommendations regarding assessment 
and pain treatment were specified on the basis of 
reviewed evidence and expert opinion. From 2914 
review studies initially identified, 186 met inclusion 
criteria. The task force emphasised the importance 
for the health professional to adopt a patient-centred 
framework within a biopsychosocial perspective, to have 
sufficient knowledge of IA and OA pathogenesis, and 
to be able to differentiate localised and generalised 
pain. Treatment is guided by scientific evidence and 
the assessment of patient needs, preferences and 
priorities; pain characteristics; previous and ongoing 
pain treatments; inflammation and joint damage; 
and psychological and other pain-related factors. 
Pain treatment options typically include education 
complemented by physical activity and exercise, orthotics, 
psychological and social interventions, sleep hygiene 
education, weight management, pharmacological and 
joint-specific treatment options, or interdisciplinary 
pain management. Effects on pain were most uniformly 
positive for physical activity and exercise interventions, 
and for psychological interventions. Effects on pain for 
educational interventions, orthotics, weight management 
and multidisciplinary treatment were shown for particular 
disease groups. Underpinned by available systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses, these recommendations 
enable health professionals to provide knowledgeable 
pain-management support for people with IA and OA.
IntRoductIon
Pain is the predominant symptom in the majority of 
people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) and osteo-
arthritis (OA) which both broadly contribute to the 
global burden of rheumatic and musculoskeletal 
conditions.1–5 Knowledgeable pain-management 
support can reduce pain, increase functioning and 
well-being, and reduce individual and societal costs.6 
Therefore, practitioners in all healthcare settings 
should have the knowledge and skills required to 
help people with IA and OA to better manage their 
pain. Rheumatology health professionals are ideally 
placed to provide comprehensive, evidence-based 
and patient-centred care.7 
Pain is a complex and multifaceted experience. 
Besides pathological processes such as inflamma-
tion and tissue damage, multiple individual factors 
influence pain, for example, illness beliefs, mood, 
avoidance behaviour, obesity, sleep disturbance, 
and the pattern of rest and activity throughout the 
day.8–13 These factors are commonly mentioned in 
educational materials and are part of the pain-man-
agement approach by health professionals in rheu-
matology.9 14 15
Meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) have, for instance, been performed with 
respect to pharmacological pain treatment in OA,16 17 
aerobic exercise in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
OA,18 19 activity pacing in chronic pain,20 and broad 
education and self-management approaches in rheu-
matic diseases.15 21 Evidence regarding pain-man-
agement support in IA and OA ranges from RCTs 
to expert reports, but as yet the effect of pain-man-
agement options on pain have not been studied in 
a comprehensive way for multiple pain treatment 
modalities. The aim of this review was to evaluate 
the existing scientific evidence associated with the 
benefits of the health professional’s approach to 
pain management for people with IA and OA, and 
to use this evidence and expert opinion to provide 
recommendations that enable health professionals to 
provide knowledgeable pain-management support.
Methods
The standardised operating procedures for Euro-
pean League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)-en-
dorsed 
recommendations 
were 
followed,22 
including a systematic literature review and defini-
tion of the strength of recommendations by a task 
force of experts. In the current article, the recom-
mendations regarding management options mostly 
include advice with sufficient data-driven evidence, 
whereas the overarching principles and recommen-
dations regarding assessment are based on expert 
opinion because they could not be substantiated 
with evidence from systematic reviews.

Recommendation
task force
The task force that included 18 members (16 from Europe and 
2 from the USA) from 12 countries consisted of patient repre-
sentatives, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists, rheumatolo-
gists, a general practitioner, an occupational therapist, a clinical 
epidemiologist and a research fellow. The executive committee 
of the task force consisted of a convener (RG), methodologist 
(RC) and research fellow (CLO). During the first of two task 
force meetings, the research questions, scope of the project and 
pain-management options were defined.
scope
Definition of the scope and framing of questions addressing 
management options in systematic reviews helped the task force 
to achieve focused recommendations. This process was guided 
by PICO which specifies the patient Population, Interventions, 
Comparator and Outcomes of interest.23
The target users of the recommendations are health profes-
sionals in the field of rheumatology including rheumatologists. 
The target population for these recommendations are patients 
with OA and patients with the following types of IA: RA, spon-
dyloarthritis (SpA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
It was decided that recommendations should cover core 
general pain management that virtually any health professional 
should be able to give including the appraisal of treatment 
options which require referral to specialised pain treatment. 
These options requiring referral included in the recommenda-
tions should be readily available to most healthcare practitioners. 
Moreover, it was decided to exclude general pharmacolog-
ical and joint-specific medical and surgical treatments such as 
arthroplasty and glucocorticoid injections from the systematic 
literature review because these are better covered by the existing 
EULAR task force recommendations for the management of IA 
and OA.16 17 24–29
To restrict the systematic literature review to pain-manage-
ment strategies, the target outcome of our systematic review 
was pain. However, consistent with other expert groups,30 31 
the task force unanimously endorsed that, besides pain, phys-
ical functioning (eg, activity) and psychological functioning (eg, 
emotional well-being and participation) are core domains of 
any management intervention in rheumatic care. This focus on 
pain as an outcome but also the multiple management options 
that are reviewed and the broad group of patients to which this 
study is relevant, differentiates our study from studies with a 
more general focus on education in IA,21 or non-pharmacolog-
ical management of OA.15
systematic literature review
The bibliographic databases Cochrane, Embase, PsycINFo, 
PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched with the name 
of one or more of the diseases of interest in the title and the word 
‘pain’ and a word referring to a mode of intervention or care in 
the title, abstract or keywords (search date: 19 October 2015). For 
efficiency in answering the broad question of the literature review 
and to benefit from the work that was done previously, the search 
was limited to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, (practice) guide-
lines and recommendations. If no systematic reviews were avail-
able, we searched for RCTs. No time or language restrictions were 
applied in the initial search. Thus, included in the literature search 
were systematic reviews in one of the selected diseases (RA, SpA, 
PsA, OA) with pain as an outcome measure. Excluded were studies 
involving general pharmacological and joint-specific medical and 
surgical treatment.
All abstracts were independently read and judged on 
their suitability for inclusion by two reviewers. Results were 
compared and, in case of discrepancy, discussed until consensus 
was reached. Excluded were duplicate articles, articles that 
were withdrawn, those not written in English, animal studies, 
conference abstracts, articles including (practice) guidelines or 
recommendations without a systematic review or meta-analysis 
included, previous versions of reviews and meta-analyses (eg, 
Cochrane reviews), articles that did not have pain as a reported 
outcome measure or did not report outcomes for OA, RA, SpA 
or PsA, articles not reviewing the effect of one or multiple 
modes of intervention or care, and articles that only reviewed 
the effects of pharmacological treatments, surgical treatments, 
complementary medicine, herbs or nutraceuticals. Reference 
lists of the selected articles were hand-searched for additional 
relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The detailed 
search keys and exclusion criteria are shown in online supple-
mentary file 1 .
evaluating the evidence
The evidence for OA was divided into evidence for OA in 
general; OA of the knee, hip or knee and hip; OA of the hand/
wrist and OA of the foot/ankle. The systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses commonly included a mean effect size for pain. 
For every treatment option and per disease subgroup, the effect 
found by the included articles was recorded and effect categories 
were distinguished: ‘positive effect’ (ie, articles (unanimously) 
state positive effects of the treatment option on pain), ‘no effect’ 
(ie, articles state the treatment option has neither positive nor 
negative effects), ‘unclear effect’ (ie, articles state both no effects 
and positive effects) or a combination thereof meaning that 
articles were divided in their conclusions on the effect of the 
treatment option (eg, some state unclear effects and others only 
positive effects). ‘Negative effect’ could have been a category but 
none of the included studies stated harmful overall effects of the 
examined treatment options.
Our systematic review protocol was developed as a review of 
reviews including systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs. 
Therefore, the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine ‘level 
of evidence’ for all recommendations was 1A (from meta-analysis 
or RCTs) or occasionally 1B (when only one RCT was available).22 
The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation system was used to rate the overall quality of evidence 
of the reviews and meta-analyses.32 T
wo assessors independently 
graded the quality of the available evidence as high, moderate, low 
or very low. In case of discrepancy, the quality was discussed until 
consensus was reached.33 ‘Strength of recommendation’ was deter-
mined for the recommendations. These scores vary from A (‘cate-
gory of evidence’ 1A: meta-analysis of RCTs) to D (‘category of 
evidence’ 4 from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clin-
ical experience of respected authorities or extrapolated recommen-
dation from ‘category of evidence’ 2 or 3 from non-randomised 
experimental, correlation or descriptive studies).22
developing recommendations
During the second and last task force meeting, the results of 
the systematic literature were presented and discussed, and the 
wording of recommendations was started. Treatment recommen-
dations were supported by findings in the systematic literature 
review. Overarching principles and assessment recommendations 
were mostly based on expert opinion in the task force. After this 
meeting, the wording was finished through email, and each task 
force member indicated the ‘level of agreement’ on a numerical

Results
Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the systematic literature review. 
The 2914 selected titles reduced to 214 after exclusion of dupli-
cates and check of exclusion criteria. Full texts of 17 articles 
could not be obtained. T
wo assessors read 197 articles in full-text. 
Another 13 articles were excluded for being a narrative (non-sys-
tematic) review (3x), guideline without systematic review (1x) 
or duplicate (2x), not having pain as an outcome (4x) or treat-
ment effects on pain as an aim (2x) or involving only results of 
pharmacological treatment (1x). T
wo additional meta-analyses 
were included after scanning the reference list of the selected 
articles. In total, 186 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were 
included, and their content was assessed for the following infor-
mation: population, types of intervention, effects and level of 
quality. This information is provided in online supplementary 
files 2, 3 and 4 for all included studies.
evaluation of effects on pain (systematic literature review)
No studies were found that systematically reviewed effects on 
pain for PsA. Moreover, it was found that of the included treat-
ment options, sleep interventions and most assistive devices 
were not evaluated for their effect on pain in systematic reviews. 
Studies were heterogeneous with respect to intervention and 
comparator conditions. For example, comparisons of exercise 
included land-based versus water-based, strengthening versus 
aerobic, group versus individual, supervised versus home-based, 
multimodal versus unimodal, progressive versus non-progressive 
and one or various exercises versus standard care, sham or medi-
cation. The reviewed studies, direction of effects and level of 
quality are shown in tables 1 and 2 for the treatment modalities

Recommendation
that were included in the recommendations and in table 3 for 
miscellaneous treatment modalities.
Education and self-management
The reviewed review studies on education and self-management 
programmes generally concluded that available studies showed 
‘positive effects’ (n=8) or showed both ‘no effects’ and ‘positive 
effects’ (n=14), but for SpA and OA of the hand/wrist, single 
meta-analyses observed ‘no effect’ on pain (table 1).
Physical activity and exercise
Of all treatment options, the effects of physical exercise have 
been studied most extensively (table 2). For general exercise, 
aerobic exercise, and strength and resistance training, the quality 
of studies was low to moderate and effects on pain were mostly 
‘positive’ in IA and OA, with some reviews observing ‘no effects’. 
For tai chi, yoga, qigong and whole body vibration, the quality 
of studies was low to very low, and it was unclear whether there 
were positive effects on pain. Table 2 can be used as a guide for 
choosing an appropriate intervention; for instance, strength and 
resistance training is more relevant and more extensively studied 
for OA of the knee than for other conditions. Reviews do not 
answer the question whether high-intensity exercise is as safe as 
low-intensity exercise which is an ongoing issue of debate.34 35
Orthotics
In mostly low quality studies, ‘positive effects’ of orthotics on 
pain have been consistently observed for orthopaedic shoes in 
RA and OA of the knee, splints in OA of the hand, and sleeves 
and elastic bandages in OA of the knee and less consistently for 
other orthotics (table 1). Except for use of a cane,16 no system-
atic reviews evaluated daily living aids such as a tin-opener or 
assistive devices using pain as an outcome. Although several 
orthotics can be recommended based on positive effects on pain, 
there is not enough evidence to give recommendations regarding 
design or materials.
Psychological and social interventions
In very low to moderate quality studies, effects of psychological 
interventions (eg, cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), mind-
fulness-based interventions, stress management training) on pain 
as summarised in reviews were ‘positive’ with the exception of 
reviews showing ‘no effect’ on pain of CBT in SpA and biofeed-
back in OA (table 1).
Weight management
In very low to moderate quality studies, effects of weight 
management have been frequently reviewed for OA of the knee; 
‘no effects’ and ‘positive effects’ were observed. For RA and SpA, 
‘positive effects’ were observed in three reviews (table 1).
Sleep interventions
It has been proposed that sleep disturbance should be systemat-
ically assessed and managed in patients with IA and OA.13 36–38 
Our systematic review did not extract systematic reviews that 
evaluated effects of sleep interventions on pain in OA or IA, but 
randomised trials examined the effects of CBT for insomnia in 
OA. CBT was observed to improve sleep and pain in one study.39 
In another study, both CBT and a placebo condition resulted 
in improved sleep and comparable reductions of pain over 6 
months, but the CBT group had significantly greater reductions 
in wake after sleep onset which predicted subsequent decreases 
in clinical pain.40 Outside the field of rheumatic diseases, 
meta-analyses support the effectiveness of behavioural, including 
self-help, interventions on sleep outcomes.41 42 Face-to-face 
treatments of at least four sessions seem to be more effective 
than self-help interventions.43 In meta-analyses, small but signif-
icant effects of sleep interventions on pain have been observed in 
people with varied chronic medical conditions.44 45
Pharmacological treatment
Pharmacological treatment is a core ingredient of pain manage-
ment in IA and OA. It includes analgesics (eg, paracetamol, 
codeine and other opiate-like drugs); oral or topical non-ste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); intra-articular injec-
tions, for example, with glucocorticoids; and occasionally also 
agents for neuropathic pain. The evidence for pharmacological 
pain treatment was not part of the current review but has been 
evaluated by other task forces.16 17 24–29 46–50 In brief, previous 
task forces recommended paracetamol as first-line treatment, 
with topical agents such as topical NSAIDs and capsaicin also 
recommended for specific joints, for patients with OA,17 26 29 and 
consideration of intra-articular injections for specific joints in 
OA and IA.17 24–26 28 29 Existing EULAR recommendations should 
be consulted regarding the safe use of NSAIDs.17 26 29 46
Miscellaneous therapies
Table 3 shows an overview of less commonly available thera-
pies in rheumatological clinical practice that were therefore not 
included in the recommendations. If a patient shows interest in 
one of these therapies, and skilled professionals are available to 
administer them, then this overview can be used as a quick guide 
to the appropriate meta-analyses. These therapies have espe-
cially been studied in OA of the knee with positive effects on 
pain of acupuncture and ‘balneotherapy and massage’ and less 
clear effects of ‘electrical’ therapies.
Psoriatic arthritis
Pain is as high or higher in PsA than in RA,51 and patients have an 
educational need to manage their pain.52 Nevertheless, none of 
the extracted studies reviewed the health professional’s approach 
in PsA for effects on pain. Given the lack of specific knowledge, 
the health professional may use pain treatment options in RA to 
guide pain treatment in PsA.
overarching principles (expert opinion)
The task force defined overarching principles based on expert 
opinion (box 1).
First, patient-centred care was considered important. Care 
that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient pref-
erences, needs and values, and ensures that patient values guide 
clinical decisions,53 may improve adherence and persistence with 
treatment.21 54–57 Validation of the patient’s pain experience is 
considered a prerequisite for trust, communication and engage-
ment in treatment.
Second, a biopsychosocial model of pain was recommended. 
Relationships between all factors of this model are recognised to 
be interactive and reciprocal with mutually influencing pathways 
similar to a hanging mobile toy in which movement of one part 
causes movement of other parts. The importance of the distinct 
factors differs between individuals.
Third, in order to achieve pain control, it is crucial to treat 
disease activity and to prevent tissue damage. To meet that aim, 
the health professional should have basic knowledge of IA and 
OA. Common treatment goals in rheumatic diseases are to opti-
mise control of inflammation, decrease disease activity, improve

function and well-being, and to reduce pain and other disease-re-
lated symptoms.15–17 21 24–29
Fourth, the ability to differentiate between types of pain helps 
the health professional to direct the optimal pain-management 
strategy. Pain localised in a specific region of the body might 
be due to peripheral nociceptive input such as inflammation or 
damage. Generalised pain is more often non-specific with regard 
to pathological findings and can be due to a dysfunction in the 
regulation of pain pathways. Pain is commonly regarded as 
generalised or widespread when pain is present in both sides of 
the body, above and below the waist and in axial body regions. 
In IA, generalised pain may remain despite good inflammatory 
control. Such pain requires comprehensive pain-management 
strategies.58 59
Not all health professionals may currently have the required 
knowledge and skills to apply these principles. For those health 
professionals who have identified that they require further 
education in this area, the overarching principles can be used to 
direct their learning. This may involve work-based supervision 
with another health professional or undertaking an educational 
course that addresses some or all of these principles.
Recommendations (systematic literature review and expert 
opinion)
Table 4 shows the recommendations. Proper assessment is a 
prerequisite for proper pain treatment. Recommendations 1 
(assessment) and 2 (personalised treatment plan) were based on 
expert opinion in the task force. Treatment recommendations 
3–10 were based on the systematic literature review summarising 
effects on pain. Specific considerations regarding application of 
these treatment options (indicated with an asterisk in table 4) 
were based on expert opinion of the task force.
Assessment
The extent of assessment depends on many factors such as available 
time. A first step in ensuring that pain management is patient-cen-
tred is to invite patients disclosing the impact of pain on their daily 
functioning, to assess their ideas and concerns regarding the cause 
of their pain and the perceived control over pain episodes, and to 
take account of their expectations and preferences for treatment. 
It is deemed important to establish the patient’s functional and 
valued life goals, that is, what it is that they cannot currently do as 
well as they would wish to. Research shows that individuals differ 
widely in terms of management needs.21 54 60 61
Second, assess pain severity using a numerical or visual 
analogue pain rating scale,62 and the onset, duration, location 
and spread (pain manikin), quality, interference, triggers and 
progression of pain. Furthermore, appraise the type of pain 
(localised or generalised) and whether referral is needed to a 
pain specialist to evaluate the type of pain, current treatment or 
current medication (safe use, interactions with other medication, 
side effects). Generalised pain can be recognised in a clinical 
interview and by the use of a pain manikin such as the Michigan 
body map.63 Use validated questionnaires to assess the potential 
presence of neuropathic pain.62 64–66
Third, assess ongoing pharmacological and non-pharmaco-
logical treatments, previous treatments tried and the effects and 
side effects of these treatments, patient beliefs about the ability 
to control and overcome pain and its consequences, and willing-
ness of the patient to engage in additional treatment if deemed 
necessary.
Fourth, assess current inflammation and joint damage as sources 
of pain following the most recent recommendations.67 68 In case 
of poorly controlled inflammation, optimise disease control or 
refer to a rheumatologist for treatment according to recommen-
dations.25 27 48 In case of localised (nociceptive) pain relating to 
OA, consider (to refer to) joint-specific treatments in line with 
recommendations.16 69
Fifth, assess pain-related biological, psychological and social 
factors that might need attention, specifically:
 
►
The nature and extent of disability: physical activity, mobility, 
activities of daily living, social participation, general phys-
ical fitness (aerobic capacity, muscle strength, endurance), 
pain-related fear and avoidance of activities, balance of 
activities and rest (pacing).
 
►
Beliefs and emotions about pain and pain-related disability: 
the psychological response to pain and psychological vulner-
ability factors, psychological distress, psychiatric comor-
bidity and cognitions such as catastrophising (rumination, 
magnification and helplessness),70 fear of movement-related 
pain,71 catastrophising and pain self-efficacy.72
 
►
Social factors related to pain and its consequences: the 
way family members and other significant others react to 
patient’s pain or pain-related disability; work; family and 
friends; economic problems; housing.
 
►
Sleep problems: the quantity and quality of sleep, including 
whether the patient feels refreshed on waking and sleep 
hygiene habits such as regular exercise during the day, stress 
management, noise, sleep timing and avoidance of caffeine, 
nicotine, alcohol and daytime napping.73
 
►
Presence of obesity.74
 
►
Other factors that might influence pain or pain management, 
such as dependence on tobacco, alcohol or drugs.75
Treatment
Tables 1–3 offer an overview of the number of the reviewed reviews 
and meta-analyses, the observed effects of specific treatments on 
pain and the quality of evidence of the studies.
Through shared decision-making, treatment is guided by the 
expressed needs of the patient, the health professional’s assessment 
and evidence-based treatment options. A stepped-care approach is 
recommended including education and self-management support 
in step 1 (recommendation 3), one or more treatment options by a 
specialist if indicated in step 2 (recommendations 4–9) or multidis-
ciplinary treatment in step 3 (recommendation 10).
box 1 overarching principles
 
► The assessment and treatment process should be guided by a 
patient-centred framework.
 
► The health professional should understand that (any type 
of) pain encompasses multiple and mutually interacting 
biological, psychological and social factors that include but 
are not limited to pain severity, peripheral (inflammation 
and joint damage) and central neurophysiological processes, 
physical (dis)ability, resilience and vulnerabilities (emotions, 
cognitions, behaviour, lifestyle), social factors (work, support, 
facilities, economic), sleep quality, obesity and other health 
risks (eg, smoking, alcoholism).
 
► The health professional should have basic knowledge of the 
pathology, treatment and sequelae of inflammatory arthritis 
and osteoarthritis.
 
► The health professional should be able to differentiate 
between localised and generalised pain and should know 
that these types of pain may coexist.

Recommendation
The choice for a specific intervention is not only determined 
by effects on pain but also by effects on functioning, social 
participation and well-being. Moreover, evidence for effects of 
specific pain treatments differ for specific diseases. The ‘strength 
of recommendation’ for recommendations 3–10 (table 4) holds 
for specific diseases in which uniform positive effects on pain 
(excluding studies with ‘very low’ quality of evidence) were 
observed.

‘Level of evidence’ and ‘Strength of recommendation’ for treatment modalities refer to specific diseases in which uniform positive effects on pain (excluding studies with ‘very low’ quality of 
evidence) were observed (tables 1 and 2). Overarching principles and recommendations regarding assessment are based on expert opinion.
Level of evidence: 1A, from meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials; 1B, from at least one randomised controlled trial; 2A, from at least one controlled study without randomisation; 
2B, from at least one other type of quasi-experimental study; 3, from descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies or case–control studies; 4, from expert committee 
reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities.
Strength of recommendations is a combination of the information from the systematic literature review and expert opinion: A, category I evidence; B, category II evidence or extrapolated 
recommendations from category I evidence; C, category III evidence or extrapolated recommendation from category I or II evidence; D, category IV evidence or extrapolated recommendation 
from category II or III evidence.22

Recommendation
 
►
Education had a uniform positive effect on pain in OA (hip/
knee, knee).
 
►
Physical activity and exercise showed uniform positive 
effects on pain for general exercise in SpA and OA (general, 
hip/knee, knee, foot/ankle), aerobic exercise in OA (general, 
knee), and strength and resistance training in OA (general, 
hip/knee, hip, knee).
 
►
Orthotics showed small but consistent positive effects on 
pain for orthopaedic shoes in RA and OA of the knee, splints 
in OA of the hand and knee orthoses (especially sleeves, 
elastic bandages) in OA of the knee.
 
►
Psychological and social interventions showed a uniform 
positive effect on pain for CBT in RA and OA (general), 
psychosocial and coping interventions in OA (general), 
biofeedback in RA and relaxation interventions in OA 
(general, hip/knee).
 
►
There was no meta-analysis that evaluated effects of sleep 
interventions on pain in IA or OA but small effects of sleep 
interventions on pain were observed in meta-analyses in 
people with varied chronic medical conditions.
 
►
Weight management showed a uniform positive effect on 
pain in RA, SpA and OA of the hip/knee.
 
►
Multidisciplinary treatment is cautiously recommended 
considering the absence of studies examining the added 
effect on pain of multidisciplinary treatment to monodis-
ciplinary therapies and considering that meta-analyses on 
multimodal treatment did not observe effects on pain.
dIscussIon
Results and conclusions derived from 186 systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses were reviewed to identify the evidence asso-
ciated with the benefits of the health professional’s approach to 
pain management for people with IA and OA. Effects on pain 
were most uniformly positive for physical activity and exercise 
interventions, and for psychological interventions. Effects on 
pain for educational interventions, orthotics, weight manage-
ment and multidisciplinary treatment were shown for partic-
ular disease groups. Recommendations for patient-centred pain 
management were guided by this scientific evidence and by clin-
ical expert opinion.
The task force unanimously endorsed that in rheumatic care, 
besides pain severity, physical functioning and psychological 
functioning are major outcomes of any management interven-
tion by health professionals, in agreement with other expert 
groups.30 31 Although pain was selected as the target outcome, 
our systematic literature review also included interventions that 
were not aimed at alleviating pain but, for instance, at increasing 
muscle strength, physical activity or emotional functioning. 
Nevertheless, our study showed that many evaluations of treat-
ment options—especially physical activity and psychological 
interventions—showed a reduction of pain in most patient 
groups. This included treatment options in which pain reduction 
was not the primary goal.
Box 2 presents questions for the future research agenda. Our 
systematic review showed that there is ample evidence for specific 
pain treatment options in specific groups. Nevertheless, there 
are several omissions in our knowledge with respect to effects of 
pain management on pain, especially in PsA, sleep interventions, 
assistive devices and multidisciplinary treatment. Moreover, it 
is inherent to the multifaceted nature of pain, the heterogeneity 
of the group of patients with IA and OA, and specific needs of 
individual patients that pain-management options of choice will 
differ among patients. From a clinical point of view, a multi-
modal approach will likely result in the best outcome, but from 
a scientific point of view, it would be more fruitful to learn 
whether a single treatment option is able to bring about change 
in pain and other outcomes. Thus, a main challenge in future 
research is to examine in which patient subgroups each specific 
treatment option causes a reduction of pain. Moreover, most 
studies pertain to systematic interventions in groups, but the 
most frequent clinical intervention is patient-customised educa-
tion and advice given during a consultation, handing a brochure 
or offering information through the internet. The effects of these 
minimal interventions should be investigated as well.
As pain is the predominant symptom and burden in IA and 
OA,1–5 clinical training of rheumatology health professionals in 
pain management is essential. To ensure patient-centred pain 
management, health professionals need knowledge, confidence, 
communication skills and skills to support patients to translate 
intentions into action plans, which should be part of educational 
programmes.76–78 It has been demonstrated that training of 
professionals helps to improve pain management of OA.79 Health 
professionals can use the handout shown in figure 2 as a guide 
in their work, while the more detailed findings and recommen-
dations can be used to fine-tune treatment. Further, knowledge 
and skills indicated in the overarching principles and recommen-
dations should be used when reviewing pain curricula in higher 
education and in postgraduate clinical education.76 Within 
EULAR, the current recommendations can be included in the 
‘EULAR online course for health professionals’ which comprises 
specific diseases such as RA and OA as well as broader modules: 
box 2 Research agenda
 
► To examine omissions in knowledge such as effects of 
treatment options on pain in psoriatic arthritis, the effects 
of sleep interventions on pain in inflammatory arthritis (IA) 
and osteoarthritis (OA), and pain as an outcome measure in 
studies of assistive devices such as a cane or rollator in more 
diseases than OA of the knee alone.
 
► To examine in meta-analyses the effects of multidisciplinary 
treatment on pain.
 
► To improve the methodological quality of treatment outcome 
studies.
 
► To conduct an analysis examining effect sizes for more 
specific treatment modalities that are now merged into 
comprehensive treatment packages.
 
► To examine moderators of treatment effects (eg, in which 
patient subgroups each specific treatment option causes a 
reduction of pain).
 
► To examine mediators of outcome, that is, how pain 
treatments work in IA and OA.
 
► To examine the effects on pain of minimal interventions 
such as advice during a consultation, use of brochures and 
e-health psychoeducation.
 
► To examine whether combined pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological pain management is more effective 
than monotherapy.
 
► To contribute to personalised medicine by analysing 
customised pain treatments; for example, using replicated 
single-case experimental designs with idiosyncratic outcome 
measures.
 
► To examine in which way healthcare could best be organised 
to be able to provide the best possible and knowledgeable 
pain-management support for people with IA and OA.
