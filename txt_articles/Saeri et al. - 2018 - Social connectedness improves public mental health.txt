Social connectedness is critical for good health. People 
with limited social connectedness have poorer mental and 
physical health, including increased depression (Cruwys 
et al., 2014a), and die earlier than those with strong social 
connectedness (for a meta-analysis, see Holt-Lunstad et al., 
2010). There is widespread consensus in the public health 
and epidemiology literatures that social connectedness 
causally protects and promotes mental health (Kawachi and 
Berkman, 2001; Perkins et al., 2015). However, models 
that specify the reverse causal relationship are also com-
mon among clinicians; the loss of social connectedness is 
frequently described as a consequence of mental illness. 
Indeed, a key diagnostic criterion of major depressive dis-
order is that symptoms ‘cause clinically significant distress 
or impairment in social, occupational or other important 
areas of functioning’ (emphasis added, p. 161, American 
Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). This tension between 
the two perspectives remains unresolved despite an 
emerging body of longitudinal work, partly due to the lack 
of a simultaneous test of the bidirectional relationships to 
robustly demonstrate the direction of the causal effect 
between social connectedness and mental health.1 In this 
paper, we address this tension, testing whether social con-
nectedness is the better predictor of mental health over time 
than the converse.

Abstract
Background: The importance of social connectedness in supporting public mental health is well established. However, 
the reverse causal pathway (that psychological ill-health leads to reduced social connectedness) remains a dominant 
perspective among mental health practitioners. Our analysis aimed to provide a rigorous test of the directionality of this 
relationship.
Method: A cross-lagged panel analysis of a large longitudinal national probability sample (N ≈ 21,227), the New Zealand 
Attitudes and Values Survey, was used to assess the bidirectional longitudinal relationship between social connectedness 
and mental health, controlling for baseline levels of both variables and demographics.
Results: Social connectedness was found to be a stronger and more consistent predictor of mental health year-on-year 
than mental health was of social connectedness.
Conclusion: These results further demonstrate how the psychological resources conferred by social connectedness 
can act as a ‘social cure’ for psychological ill-health, and provide the strongest evidence to date for the direction of this 
relationship in the general community.

Social connectedness and mental 
health
The focal emphasis of research on social connectedness 
and mental health has differed somewhat between public 
health scholars, who have tended to emphasise social deter-
minants of health (Almedom, 2005), and mental health 
researchers, especially clinical psychologists (Hirschfeld 
et al., 2000), who have tended to emphasise the conse-
quences of mental ill-health (e.g. depression) for social 
functioning. In this section, we review each of these per-
spectives in turn.
Social connectedness as a protective and 
curative factor in mental health
Social capital is a multidimensional concept that includes 
both structural (‘objective’) and cognitive (‘subjective’) 
components (Berry and Welsh, 2010). As a social determi-
nant of health, structural social capital (e.g. frequency of 
social participation, marital status) refers to material indi-
cators of adequate social relationships. Much work has 
investigated its influence on both physical and mental 
health (e.g. Ding et al., 2015; Helliwell and Barrington-
Leigh, 2012; Stafford et al., 2008). However, mounting evi-
dence suggests that subjective appraisals of social 
relationships (which are our focus in this paper, e.g., self-
reported social support or belonging), or ‘complex’ opera-
tionalisations of social capital (where both structural and 
cognitive elements are present), are more strongly associ-
ated with psychological health than purely objective meas-
ures (e.g. whether a person lives alone; Holt-Lunstad et al., 
2010).
Many of the studies exploring the relationship between 
social connectedness and health have utilised controlled 
longitudinal designs in large, representative samples. For 
example, Luo et al. (2012) found that the subjective experi-
ence of loneliness (as distinct from objective social isola-
tion) robustly predicted later onset of depressive symptoms 
and early mortality in a large nationally representative sam-
ple of older US adults. In a longitudinal study of Californian 
adults, Patterson and Veenstra (2010) found that chronic 
loneliness was associated with early mortality, which they 
argued could be explained by increased depression and 
maladaptive health behaviours. Yu et al. (2015) measured 
both cognitive and structural social capital and found that 
both predicted subsequent mental health in a multilevel 
cross-lagged longitudinal structural equation model. 
Finally, in a longitudinal study, Cruwys et al. (2013) found 
that older adults who made new social connections (by 
joining new groups) over 2 years were more likely to 
recover from depression (if initially depressed), and were 
less likely to develop depression (if initially not depressed).
A smaller number of experimental studies have also 
found 
that 
interventions 
which 
aim 
to 
improve 
social connectedness have benefits for mental health. For 
example, people with mental illness who joined recrea-
tional and therapy groups which target social isolation 
experienced clinically significant reductions in depression 
and anxiety symptoms (Cruwys et al., 2014b; Haslam et al., 
2016).
In addition to the strong empirical case for the causal 
link from social connectedness to mental health, several 
theoretical frameworks also argue for this relationship. 
These include models which posit that social relationships 
fulfil a fundamental psychological need for belonging (e.g. 
Baumeister and Leary, 1995) and, more recently, the social 
identity approach to health (or the ‘social cure’ perspective, 
Jetten et al., 2012). This model states that our social rela-
tionships (and in particular, our social group relationships) 
act as psychological resources that protect one’s health, 
particularly in times of adversity (see, for example, Praharso 
et al., 2017; Seymour-Smith et al., 2017).
To summarise, the dominant public health and epidemi-
ological perspective on social connectedness is that it is a 
resource (a form of capital) that an individual can draw 
upon in times of need, and which will protect their mental 
health.
Poor social functioning as a consequence of 
mental illness
In the clinical literature, however, social connectedness is 
usually operationalised as social functioning. This is an 
individual-level skill (or deficit): ‘the degree to which a 
person is able to fulfil various roles in different social envi-
ronments’ (p.2913, Renner et al., 2014; Segrin, 2000). 
Social functioning is often explicitly specified as either a 
consequence of mental illness, or as a symptom of the con-
dition itself. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) specifies that a key 
criterion of depression is withdrawal from social situations, 
as well as a lack of interest or engagement in important 
social roles such as work or close relationships (APA, 
2013). In a review of social functioning and depression, 
Hirschfeld et al. (2000) described the ‘enormous personal, 
social, and economic impact of depression, due in no small 
part to the associated impairments in social functioning, is 
often underappreciated’ (p. 268). Many other disorders are 
also formally described as impairing social functioning, 
including anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders 
and autism-spectrum disorders (APA, 2013). The implica-
tion of such diagnostic criteria is that reduced social con-
nectedness is an outcome of the disorder (rather than, say, a 
risk factor).
The task of determining the direction of the causal rela-
tionship between mental health and social connectedness is 
further complicated by the use of social functioning as an 
indicator of successful remission from mental illness. For 
instance, Renner et al. (2014) found that social functioning 
 Saeri et al. 
367
Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 52(4)
improved in people with major depressive disorder after the 
administration of psychotherapy. Even when impaired 
social functioning has been found to predate clinical diag-
nosis, clinical researchers have often framed this as a pre-
morbid (i.e. prodromal) symptom; an early warning sign of 
the onset of mental illness (particularly for schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorders; Addington et al., 2008; Cornblatt 
et al., 2007), rather than as a risk factor per se.
From a clinical perspective, then, social functioning is 
impaired by mental illness, is sometimes an early symptom 
of mental illness onset, and recovers as a consequence of 
effective treatment targeting the psychological disorder. 
The conceptualisation of social functioning as a criterion 
for recovery or remission (Zimmerman et al., 2006), how-
ever, makes it difficult to determine whether the catalyst in 
such studies is improvement in social connectedness or 
improvement in mental health.
Reciprocal relationships between social 
connectedness and mental health
In their systematic review of social capital and mental ill-
ness, De Silva et al. (2005) raised the possibility of a 
reciprocal relationship between the two constructs, high-
lighting the limitations of the predominantly cross-sec-
tional evidence purporting a causal link and recommending 
further longitudinal research. To our knowledge, though, 
there are only two extant systematic investigations of the 
possible reciprocal relationships between social connect-
edness and mental health. Ding et al. (2015) conducted a 
lagged fixed effects regression analysis in Australian 
adults using the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics 
in Australia Survey (HILDA). They found that structural 
social capital (operationalised as community participa-
tion) and mental wellbeing were positively and recipro-
cally related. Yu et al. (2015) conducted a multilevel 
cross-lagged structural equation analysis of mental and 
physical health and social capital (operationalised as lone-
liness, social participation and social networks) in British 
adults using the British Household Panel Survey. Their 
analysis found that social participation (membership in 
community groups and other organisations) was posi-
tively and reciprocally associated with mental health. 
Furthermore, reported loneliness was negatively, but not 
reciprocally, associated with mental health. In other 
words, Yu et al. (2015) found some evidence that subjec-
tive social capital (loneliness) was a stronger predictor of 
mental health than the converse. While both are strong 
studies, neither completely accounts for the bidirectional 
relationships between social connectedness and mental 
health. The study conducted by Ding et al. (2015) did not 
have a measure of wellbeing available at each wave of 
data, and so could not use a full crossover design at each 
timepoint. Furthermore, Yu et al. (2015) used general 
measures of wellbeing rather than clinically validated 
scales for assessing mental health in the general popula-
tion. Most importantly, neither study was specifically 
designed to directly compare the strength of each direc-
tional relationship, which may limit their persuasiveness 
for sceptical clinicians.
The current research
In this study, we perform a robust test of the relationship 
between social connectedness and mental health in both 
directions, that is, (1) Does a lack of social connectedness 
lead to poorer mental health? and (2) Does poorer mental 
health lead to a lack of social connectedness? We extend 
previous work on bidirectional relationships between these 
constructs, proposing that both statements are true, but that 
social connectedness may be a stronger longitudinal predic-
tor of mental health than mental health is of social connect-
edness. We made this prediction based on both on the 
emerging empirical evidence (e.g. Cruwys et al., 2013; Yu 
et al., 2015) and on the strength of theoretical models of 
this relationship, which have developed substantially in 
recent years (for a review, see Haslam, 2014). However, 
given the lack of comprehensive past comparisons, this was 
a tentative prediction.
We utilise the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Survey 
(NZAVS), which is a longitudinal survey of New Zealand 
residents that commenced in 2009. We chose this dataset 
due to its large size (N = 21,227 with at least two usable 
waves of data) and excellent wave-to-wave retention; for 
its inclusion of suitable measures of social connectedness 
(e.g. ‘I know that people in my life accept and value me’; 
included from Wave 1) and mental health (operationalized 
as distress using Kessler-6, e.g., ‘In the past 30 days, how 
often did you feel so depressed that nothing could cheer you 
up?’, included from Wave 2 (Kessler et al., 2003). We con-
ducted a fully cross-lagged panel analysis of social con-
nectedness and mental health for Waves 2–5 of the NZAVS, 
controlling for age, sex and local area socioeconomic dep-
rivation (NZDep2006, Salmond et al., 2007). Constraints 
imposed on regression paths in this analysis allow us to test 
specific hypotheses regarding the relative strength of the 
longitudinal pathways between social connectedness and 
mental health.
Our specific hypotheses are as follows:
H1. Social connectedness at each wave will positively pre-
dict mental health at the following wave, consistent with 
the public health and epidemiological perspective
H2. Mental health at each wave will positively predict 
social connectedness at the following wave, consistent with 
the clinical perspective
H3. The relationship between social connectedness and 
lagged mental health will be stronger than the relationship 
between mental health and lagged social connectedness.

Method
Sample
The data were drawn from four consecutive waves (Wave 
2, 2010, to Wave 5, 2013) of the NZAVS. The NZAVS is a 
nationally representative 20-year study of New Zealand 
adult residents that commenced in 2009, with participants 
randomly selected from the electoral roll. For Waves 2 to 5, 
wave-to-wave retention was approximately 80% (Dalby 
et al., 2015; Sibley, 2014a). A total of 21,227 unique par-
ticipants had data from at least two waves available, which 
was our N for pooled effects (Sibley and Greaves, 2014).
Measures
Social connectedness. Social connectedness was modelled 
as a latent variable and measured with three manifest items, 
adapted from Cutrona and Russell (1987). Participants 
were asked how accurately these statements described 
them: ‘I know that people in my life accept and value me’, 
‘I know that people around me share my attitudes and 
beliefs’, ‘I feel like an outsider’ (reversed). The response 
range was 1, very inaccurate, to 7, very accurate. Higher 
scores on the variable indicate feeling more socially 
connected
Mental health. Mental (ill-)health was operationalised as 
distress, and modelled as a latent variable and measured 
with six manifest items from the Kessler-6 scale (Kessler 
et al., 2003). The Kessler-6 scale is a set of six questions 
that were developed to screen for serious mental illness in 
the general population. The question stem ‘In the past 
30 days, how often did …’ prefaced items about distress, 
e.g., ‘you feel so depressed that nothing could cheer you 
up?’, ‘you feel worthless?’. The response range was 0, none 
of the time, to 4, all of the time. Higher scores on this vari-
able represent a greater degree of distress.
Control variables. Participant age in years at Wave 2, sex 
(0 = female, 1 = male), and socioeconomic status were 
included as time-invariant covariates in the main analysis. 
Participant socioeconomic status was derived from the 
average 2006 New Zealand Socioeconomic Deprivation 
Index score for all waves in which participants provided 
data (1 = most affluent, 10 = most impoverished, Salmond 
et al., 2007). This score is derived from aggregate census 
information about the relative affluence of each sub-neigh-
bourhood geographic area (a ‘meshblock’ of approximately 
80 people, Sibley, 2014b).
Statistical analyses
We conducted fully cross-lagged panel analysis to investi-
gate the reciprocal causal relationship between social con-
nectedness and mental health. Following Cole and Maxwell 
(2003) and Martens and Haase (2006), we conducted the 
analyses in several steps. First, we constructed and tested 
measurement models for each wave to confirm that social 
connectedness and mental health were empirically distinct 
constructs. Second, we tested autoregressive models sepa-
rately for social connectedness and mental health, where the 
latent focal variable at each wave was regressed on the latent 
focal variable at the previous wave. The test of autoregres-
sive models demonstrates the stability of the focal constructs 
across time. Third, we constructed a full cross-lagged model 
that combines both autoregressive models and adds cross-
lagged paths between social connectedness and mental 
health. The fully cross-lagged model represents all recipro-
cal relationships across time and offers a test of H1 and H2. 
Finally, as a test of H3, we compared the fit of the fully 
cross-lagged model to an alternative model in which the 
bidirectional relationships were constrained to be equal.
Missing data, estimation and model fit. We used Full Informa-
tion Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation for the focal 
structural equation analyses. FIML maximises the informa-
tional value of observed data including incomplete cases, 
which are common due to wave-to-wave attrition and 
booster sampling in longitudinal panel surveys such as the 
NZAVS. The FIML method produces less biased parameter 
and standard error estimates than listwise deletion or expec-
tation maximisation (Enders and Bandalos, 2001), espe-
cially when the data are not missing completely at random, 
or a substantial proportion of the dataset is considered miss-
ing. FIML is as effective as multi-step methods such as mul-
tiple imputation (Newman, 2003; Wothke, 2000).
To evaluate and compare model fit, we used the chi-
square goodness-of-fit statistic, the comparative fit index 
(CFI), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) 
and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) 
and, as is convention for RMSEA, its 90% confidence inter-
val (CI). For large and complex data sets, the chi-square sta-
tistic is less useful for evaluating fit due to the very high 
power to detect minor perturbations away from exact fit, but 
it is included here as convention. A CFI value above 0.95 
indicates excellent fit compared to the null model, a SRMR 
value below 0.08 indicates excellent fit (Hu and Bentler, 
1999), and an RMSEA value below 0.05 indicates good fit, 
where the 90% CI lower and upper bounds fall below 0.05 
and 0.10, respectively (Chen et al., 2008).

Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics for focal variables of distress and 
social connectedness, and correlations between summary 
measures of each variable, are presented in Table 1. At the 
whole-sample level, distress and social connectedness were 
descriptively stable across time. At Wave 2, participants’ 
 Saeri et al.

average age was 44.67 years old (standard deviation 
[SD] = 14.66), and 62.04% (N = 14,273) described their 
gender as female. The average socio-economic deprivation 
for the sample was 4.90 (SD = 2.77).
Measurement and autoregressive models
A series of confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to 
evaluate and compare two possible measurement models 
for each occasion. The first model included two co-varying 
latent variables for each occasion: distress, manifested in 
the six observed variables, Kessler-1...Kessler-6 and social 
connectedness, manifested in the three observed variables, 
Social connectedness-1...Social connectedness-3. The sec-
ond model for each occasion had a single latent variable, 
wellbeing, manifested in all nine observed variables. Across 
every wave, the two-factor model fit the data significantly 
better than the one-factor model, χ2difference(df = 1) = 462.65–
1804.70, ps < 0.001.
An autoregressive model for distress regressed the latent 
variable of distress on each previous wave. The loading of 
each observed variable on the latent variable were constrained 
to be equal across the four waves (i.e. time-invariant factor 
loadings). The autoregressive model fit the data well, 
χ2(21516, df = 228) = 5286.63, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.96, SRMR = 
0.07, RMSEA = 0.0321 (90% CI = [0.0314, 0.0329]). Standar-
dised factor loadings ranged from 0.53 to 0.80. Standardised 
stability estimates ranged from 0.76 to 0.80.
An autoregressive model for social connectedness 
regressed the latent variable of social connectedness on 
each previous wave. As with mental health, factor loadings 
were constrained to be equal across waves. The autoregres-
sive model fit the data well, χ2(21547, df = 39) = 182.14, 
p < 0.001, CFI = 0.995, SRMR = 0.06, RMSEA = 0.0131 
(90% CI = [0.0112, 0.0150]). Standardised factor loadings 
ranged from 0.48 to 0.73. Standardised stability estimates 
ranged from 0.86 to 0.91. The good fit of the autoregressive 
models demonstrates the stability of each latent construct 
across time.
Cross-lagged models
Two fully cross-lagged models were tested. The first model 
(‘non-stationary model’) did not constrain the weighting of 
the structural paths over time, which allowed the magni-
tude of the bidrectional relationships between distress and 
social connectedness to vary across time. The second model 
(‘stationary model’) constrained lagged structural paths to 
be equal, to test whether the cross-lagged relationships 
between distress and social connectedness were invariant 
across time. Both models fit the data well (Table 2). A χ2 
test revealed that constraining structural paths to be equal 
led to a small, but significant loss of fit, χ2difference(df = 8) = 
34.14, p < 0.001, indicating that the reciprocal relationships 
between distress and social connectedness were not station-
ary over time. Thus, in order to demonstrate a robust test of 
H3, which also imposes additional path constraints, we sum-
marise the path estimates of both models below.
Figure 1 provides an overview of the relationships in the 
non-stationary model. Social connectedness predicted 
decreased distress at every subsequent wave (BW2-W3 = −0.157, 
SE = 0.026, 95% CI = [−0.208, −0.107], BW3-W4 = −0.115, 
SE = 0.022, 95% CI = [−0.158, −0.072], BW4-W5 = −0.167, 
SE = 0.014, 95% CI = [−0.194, −0.140]) consistent with H1. 
Distress predicted decreased social connectedness at two of 
the three subsequent waves (BW2-W3 = −0.067, SE = 0.033, 95% 
CI = [−0.133, −0.002]; BW3-W4 = 0.013, SE = 0.029, 95% 
CI = [−0.045, 0.070]; BW4-W5 = −0.080, SE = 0.020, 95%

CI = [−0.119, −0.041]) broadly consistent with H2. The model 
fit well (Table 2), and the pattern of relationships did not 
change when covariates of gender, sex, and deprivation were 
excluded from the model. To test H3, we tested a model in 
which the bidirectional relationships were constrained to be 
equal. This model had worse fit than the unconstrained model, 
χ2difference(df = 3) = 32.57, p < 0.001, suggesting that the recipro-
cal relationships between distress and social connectedness 
differed in magnitude.
Figure 2 illustrates the stationary model. Social connect-
edness predicted decreased distress at a one-year lag 
(B = −0.155, SE = 0.011, 95% CI = [−0.175, −0.134]) con-
sistent with H1. Distress predicted decreased social con-
nectedness at a one-year lag (B = −0.045, SE = 0.013, 95% 
CI = [−0.070, −0.020]) consistent with H2. The pattern of 
significant and non-significant relationships did not change 
when covariates of gender, sex and deprivation were 
excluded from the model. A model in which the bidirec-
tional relationships were constrained to be equal fit worse 
than the unconstrained model, χ2difference (df = 1) = 37.31, 
p < 0.001, supporting H3 which stated that the reciprocal 
relationships are different in magnitude.

Discussion
We investigated and compared the bidirectional relation-
ships between social connectedness and mental health 
using a longitudinal nationally representative survey of 
New Zealand adult residents. The public health and epide-
miological literatures state that social connectedness (usu-
ally operationalized with particular emphasis on subjective 
connection with others) promotes mental health, and thus 
we hypothesised (H1) that social connectedness would be 
positively associated with mental health (measured as lack 
of distress) one year later. In contrast, some clinical psy-
chology and psychiatric literatures state that mental illness 
leads to reduced social connectedness (usually operational-
ised as impaired social functioning), and thus, we hypoth-
esised (H2) that mental health would be positively 
associated with social connectedness at the following 
observation. Finally, drawing from the emerging work on 
social identity and health (Cruwys et al., 2013; Jetten et al., 
2012), we tentatively hypothesised (H3) that social con-
nectedness would be more strongly associated with subse-
quent mental health compared than the reverse.
All three hypotheses were supported: A cross-lagged 
panel analysis of Waves 2–5 of the NZAVS revealed that 
social connectedness and mental health were positively and 
reciprocally associated across time, and that social connect-
edness predicted subsequent mental health more strongly 
than mental health predicted subsequent social connected-
ness. Together, these results support a growing body of evi-
dence that has demonstrated the importance of social 
connectedness in promoting and maintaining mental health 
in the general population (Cacioppo et al., 2006; Cruwys 
et al., 2014a; De Silva et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2015).
Implications for theory and practice
One barrier to advancing understanding of social connected-
ness (and its link to health) has been great diversity in the 
way this construct is conceptualised and measured. For 
instance, epidemiological research has often focused on 
more included both subjective and structural components of 
social relationships (e.g. Almedom, 2005; Ding et al., 2015), 
whereas clinical research has typically focused on self-
reported impairment in one’s capacity to connect with oth-
ers (APA, 2013; Evans et al., 2014). In the current paper, we 
measured social connectedness as the subjective appraisal 
of the quality and quantity of social relationships available 
to a person (consistent with Cruwys et al., 2014a). This was 
based on a constellation of recent work demonstrating that 
(1) it is the subjective experience of disconnection to others, 
not actual amount of contact with others, that is most debili-
tating for health (e.g. Luo et al., 2012; Sani et al., 2012); (2) 
recent large longitudinal analyses of similar research ques-
tions have focused on structural capital such as community 
participation (e.g. Ding et al., 2015); (3) the cognitive and 
structural components of social capital may be only weakly 
correlated (Giordano and Lindstrom, 2010); and (4) com-
plex (multi-component) measures of social capital better 
predict health outcomes than structural measures alone 
(Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). Nevertheless, it is possible that 
measures of social connectedness which aligned more 
closely with conceptualizations of social functioning or 
social capital may have led to different results.
Our conceptualisation of social connectedness is also 
consistent with theoretical work which has proposed that it 
is the subjective sense of connectedness to a group that is 
the ‘active ingredient’ in social relationships. This is what 
gives social relationships their power to promote and 
maintain mental health in depressed individuals (Cruwys 
et al., 2013), in the general population (Greenaway et al., 
2015; Helliwell and Barrington-Leigh, 2012), and among 
people experiencing stressful life transitions such as retire-
ment (Steffens et al., 2016). Furthermore, these results 
underline the point that it is subjective psychological 
appraisals that make social connectedness work to support 
and promote mental health in a community – simply 
‘showing up’ at social and recreational events is unlikely 
to be sufficient to benefit wellbeing (Cruwys et al., 2014b). 
From this, we might infer that public health policies must 
target more than social participation in order to promote 
trust and social cohesion within a community (Giordano 
and Lindstrom, 2010).
The relationship between social connectedness and men-
tal health has been discussed in the public health epidemiol-
ogy literature several decades (for an interdisciplinary 
review, see Almedom, 2005; for a systematic review, see De 
et al., 2005). In some nations, public health policy has begun 
to incorporate lessons from this work by emphasising the 
importance of social relationships and social support for

mental health and wellbeing (e.g. National Mental Health 
Commission, 2014). In medical and psychiatric settings, 
however, social functioning is often explicitly conceptual-
ised as an outcome or indicator of mental ill-health, and thus 
is rarely considered a primary point of intervention or per-
sisting risk factor for relapse (Backs-Dermott et al., 2010).
The tension between public health researcher and clini-
cal practitioner perspectives on social connectedness and 
mental health may undermine efforts to create and promote 
effective mental health policy, and impede investigation of 
effective treatment for psychological disorders. The find-
ings of the current paper move the field forward by demon-
strating that while the relationship between social 
connectedness and mental health is reciprocal, social con-
nectedness is particularly important in promoting mental 
health over time. These findings also support a growing 
movement in social psychiatry to attend to ‘horizontal epi-
demiology’, or the risk factors that are common across psy-
chological disorders, rather than merely the (sometimes 
arbitrary) categorical boundaries between conditions (Cieza 
et al., 2015; Haslam, 2003). Interventions which focus on 
improving social connectedness, as an example of one 
‘transdiagnostic’ risk factor, are likely to improve mental 
health now and in the future, regardless of current mental 
health status (see, for example, Haslam et al., 2016).
Strengths, limitations, and future directions
Methodologically, a strength of this paper is in its use of the 
NZAVS, a large national probability sample of New Zealand 
adults. Other work that has investigated social connected-
ness and health in panel and longitudinal data have employed 
subscales of the General Health Questionnaire (Yu et al., 
2015) or items from the Medical Outcomes Study Short 
Form (Ding et al., 2015). In the current study, we assessed 
mental health using a validated measure of distress, the 
Kessler-6 scale (Kessler et al., 2003) and a measure of social 
connectedness that has its provenance in the psychological 
literature on belonging (Cutrona and Russell, 1987). Of 
course, it is possible that a measure of mental health that 
relied on strict diagnostic criteria may have yielded different 
patterns. However, previous studies have suggested that the 
pathway from social connectedness to mental health may be 
even stronger among vulnerable groups. For instance, 
Cruwys et al. (2013) found that joining social groups was 
particularly beneficial for people who had depression symp-
toms in the clinical range. Future work should test associa-
tions between social connectedness and diagnosed mental 
health conditions over time.
An additional possible limitation is suggested by the 
finding that the relationships between social connectedness 
and mental health may be non-stationary: when we con-
strained the cross-lagged relationships to be equal year-on-
year, this led to a loss of model fit. One possibility that 
might explain the model instability is unmeasured 
exogenous variables. For instance, between Wave 2 (2010) 
and Wave 3 (2011), a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck New 
Zealand South Island’s largest city of Christchurch, killing 
185 people and causing widespread property damage, dis-
placement and psychological trauma among residents 
(Osborne and Sibley, 2013). Although there were no mean 
differences in mental health or social connectedness across 
the whole sample between Waves 2 and 3, it is possible that 
the magnitude and direction of the relationship between 
social connectedness and mental health could have been 
affected by such a disaster.
Conclusion
In sum, this study provides the strongest evidence to date 
that social connectedness is a stronger predictor of subse-
quent mental health than the reverse. We investigated these 
reciprocal relationships over time in a nationally represent-
ative dataset of New Zealand adults (N ≈ 21,227). The find-
ings speak to the value of interventions to improve social 
connectedness, such as facilitating engagement with exist-
ing group memberships and building new group member-
ships, for mental health. Furthermore, these results 
challenge mental health practitioners to conceptualise the 
social deficits in their patients as precursors, as well as 
symptoms or consequences of, mental illness.

Note
1. 
Debate about appropriate terminology has been one barrier to 
advancing research in this area. Here, we follow Cruwys et al. 
(2014a) in using social connectedness as an umbrella term to 
refer to subjectively experienced connection to others (e.g. 
involving social support, belongingness, the absence of lone-
liness), while aiming to provide enough detail in our review 
of the literature about what specific construct other research-
ers have measured so that the differences in conceptualisation 
are not lost.
