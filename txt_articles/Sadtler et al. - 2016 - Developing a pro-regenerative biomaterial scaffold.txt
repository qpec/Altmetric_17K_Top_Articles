Immune-mediated tissue regeneration driven by a biomaterial scaffold is emerging as an
innovative regenerative strategy to repair damaged tissues.We investigated how biomaterial
scaffolds shape the immune microenvironment in traumatic muscle wounds to improve tissue
regeneration.The scaffolds induced a pro-regenerative response, characterized by an mTOR/
Rictor-dependent T helper 2 pathway that guides interleukin-4–dependent macrophage
polarization, which is critical for functional muscle recovery. Manipulating the adaptive immune
system using biomaterials engineering may support the development of therapies that promote
both systemic and local pro-regenerative immune responses, ultimately stimulating tissue repair.
I
mmune homeostasis is indispensable to tis-
sue development, regeneration, and repair (1).
Traumainitiatesacascadeoflocalandsystemic
immune events that trigger the mobilization
of cells into the damaged site to initiate host
defense and tissue repair. The limited success
achieved to date in rebuilding human tissues may
be due in part to the tendency for therapeutic
strategies to target laterprocesses in wound healing
and regeneration, such as stem cell differentiation.
Conversely, the immune system is a highly flexible
network that serves as a guardian of tissue integrity
and is adapted to the nature of the local microen-
vironment (2). The immune system participates in
tissue repair by scavenging debris and dead cells
(3), recruiting and supporting the proliferation of
tissue progenitor cells (4), and inducing vascular-
ization (5). Previously, immune responses to bio-
materials were related to rejection (6–8); however,
subsets of innate immune cells have been identi-
fied as important mediators of scaffold remodeling
(9–11) and can be targeted for immune-mediated
tissueregeneration.Weexploredtheroleofadaptive
immunity in tissue regeneration, identifying
TH2 responses as critical in driving the repair
of traumatic tissue injury.
To model a traumatic wound, we surgically
excised a portion of the quadriceps muscle group
in C57BL/6 mice, provoking an irreversible volu-
metric muscle loss (VML) injury (12). Based on
the regenerative potential and clinical use of
tissue-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) scaf-
folds (10, 11), we screened and selected bone-
and cardiac muscle–derived tissue ECM scaffolds
(B-ECM and C-ECM) for their immunomodula-
tory properties [fig. S1 (13)]. The presence of scaf-
folds in damaged muscle significantly increased
the number of myeloid cells (F4/80+ macrophages
and CD11c+ dendritic cells; P < 0.0001) and lym-
phocytes (CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cells; P < 0.05)
present at the injury site as compared to a saline-
treated control after 1 and 3 weeks (Fig. 1A and
fig. S2). At 1 week, collagen-treated wounds re-
cruited the highest number of immune cells into
the defect region (36.0% of total live cells, 13.6
million cells) followed by B-ECM– and C-ECM–
treated wounds (39.3%, 5.32 million; and 45.4%,
5.44 million cells), with saline-treated wounds
containing significantly fewer cells (36.4%, 0.97
million). The proportion of myeloid cells in the
damaged muscle peaked at 1 week after injury,
and the T cell fraction, consisting of both CD4+
and CD8+ cells, peaked in all treatment groups at
3 weeks after injury. In the muscle wound, bio-
material scaffolds skewed the ratio of CD4:CD8
T cells toward a higher fraction of CD4+ helper
T cells (~70% in scaffold-treated, versus ~50% in
saline-treated wounds) at 1 week after injury (Fig.
1B). CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells were also present
at low levels and increased over time (fig. S3).
The expression of interleukin 4 (Il4), a gene
encoding a canonical type 2 helper T cell (TH2)
cytokine that is also important in muscle healing
(14–17), increased in the presence of the scaffold
(Fig. 1C). Therefore, we sought to understand the
role of cells of the adaptive immune system on
the formation of the regenerative immune micro-
environment.
Scaffolds were implanted into
B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J (Rag1−/−) mice, which lack
mature T and B cells. In Rag1−/− mice, scaffold-
mediated Il4 up-regulation was lost, suggesting a
TH2-driven scaffold immune microenvironment.
CD3+ cells were sorted out of muscle injuries at
1 week after injury for detailed gene expression
analysis (Fig. 1D, fig. S4, and table S1). Scaffolds
induced a TH2-type gene expression profile as
characterized by increased Il4 expression and
decreased expression of Ifng and Tbx21 (TH1 ca-
nonical genes). In addition, Jag2, which encodes
the Notch ligand Jagged 2, was elevated. Jagged2
helps direct TH differentiation away from TH1
and toward TH2 (18). Il10, which encodes a gen-
eral anti-inflammatory cytokine that is not TH-
specific, was also up-regulated. Other genes that
are more selectively expressed by TH1 cells, such
as Fasl and Cd28 (the costimulatory receptor for
CD86), were likewise down-regulated.
The regenerative outcome of tissue-derived ECM
scaffolds in animals and humans is correlated
with an immunoregulatory M2 macrophage phe-
notype during remodeling (9–11). Biomaterials
increased the expression of genes associated with
a pro-regenerative type 2 immune response, in-
cluding hallmark genes of M2 myeloid cells, more
specifically macrophages that are stimulated by
IL-4, known as M(IL-4) macrophages (fig. S5)
(19). As with Il4 expression, induction of these
M(IL-4) markers was almost completely lost in
Rag1−/− mice (fig. S5). In the presence of adaptive
immune cells, biomaterial scaffolds inhibited ma-
crophage CD86 up-regulation (a costimulatory
molecule expressed at high levels by classical
M1 macrophages) at 3 weeks after surgery (Fig.
2A and fig. S6H). In Rag1−/− mice, however, down-
regulation of CD86 expression was mitigated, and
ECM scaffold–treated wounds returned to a ma-
crophage polarization profile resembling that of
saline-treated control animals (Fig. 2A). On the
other hand, CD206 expression (a mannose re-
ceptor and classical M2 marker) was similar be-
tween ECM scaffold–treated and saline-treated
mice at 1 week after implantation, with increased
expression at 3 weeks (Fig. 2B). However, this
increase in CD206 was ablated in Rag1−/− mice in
both scaffold- and saline-treated wounds, suggest-
ing that the adaptive immune system also has a
scaffold-independent role in shaping the wound
healing response. Moreover, this CD206 up-
regulationwas alsoimpairedin B6.129S2-Cd4tm1Mak/
J (Cd4−/−) mice, which maintain B cells and CD8+
T cells but lack CD4+ helper T cells (fig. S6A).
Additionally, in Cd4−/− mice, the recruitment of
B cells (a commonly TH2-driven adaptive effector
cell) was diminished (fig. S6G).
To further elucidate the role of CD4+ T cells,
and more specifically TH2 T cells on the polari-
zationofmyeloidcells,weevaluatedmyeloidCD206
expression in Rag1−/− mice that were repopulated
with either wild-type (WT) CD4+ T cells or Rictor−/−
CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2, C and D, and fig. S7). Rictor is
a critical component of the mTORC2 complex
that integrates signals from the environment
and drives the polarization of TH2 cells (20).
Myeloid cells in Rag1−/− mice expressed lower
levels of CD206 as compared to WT mice; how-
ever, when repopulated with WT CD4+ T cells
(T-WT cells), this phenotype was rescued. When

 mice received TH2-deficient T cells (T-Rictor−/−
cells), CD206 expression was not rescued, proving
that TH2 T cells, dependent on mTORC2 signal-
ing, are necessary for pro-regenerative myeloid
polarization. To confirm the role of IL-4 in TH2-
dependent myeloid polarization, we character-
ized the phenotype of macrophages in BALB/
c-Il4ratm1Sz/J (Il4ra−/−) mice that cannot receive
signals from IL-4 (Fig. 2, C and D). Compared to
WT controls, myeloid cells in Il4ra−/− wounds ex-
pressed far lower levels of CD206, suggesting that
the macrophage activation was controlled by IL-4,
and verifying that the pro-regenerative profile is
associated with M(IL-4) cells.
The pleiotropic nature of immune responses
typically results in complex expression profiles
beyond stereotypical M1 versus M2 “poles” (19).
The expression of CD86 and the expression of
CD206 on macrophages (classically M1 versus
M2) were not mutually exclusive; however, these
scaffold-associated macrophages also up-regulated
the expression of genes encoding Arg1 and Retnla
(encoding Fizz1), similar to the results from quan-
titative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses of the whole wound
(Fig. 2E and fig. S5). Additionally, Cebpb, and
Timp1 were up-regulated, whereas Mmp16 and
Mmp9 were down-regulated, further suggest-
ing a pro-regenerative function of the scaffold-
associated macrophages (21–23). In Rag1−/− mice,
which cannot mount a TH2 immune response,
scaffold-associated macrophages lost their pro-
regenerative transcriptome (Fig. 2F, fig. S8,
and table S2). Several genes directly implicated
in muscle regeneration such as Igf1 (insulin-like
growth factor-1) (24–26) and Vegfa (vascular
endothelial growth factor) (27) decreased signif-
icantly in Rag1−/− mice. Gene ontology enrichment
analysis of genes differentially expressed in Rag1−/−
versus WT macrophages shows enrichment in
programs associated with morphogenesis and
differentiation, suggesting a reliance on the adapt-
ive immune system for up-regulation of develop-
mentally active immune genes (fig. S9).
The detection of a local scaffold-associated
TH2 polarization led us to investigate the poten-
tial systemic T cell response (28). Subcutaneous

 injury, repopulation of Rag1−/− mice with WT T cells
rescued their functional capacity, and the animals
could run greater distances as compared to mice
lacking the CD4 subset (Fig. 4B; 91.11 ± 3.83 versus
60.06 ± 9.69, P = 0.0032). Furthermore, Rag1−/−
mice repopulated with WT CD4 T cells performed
better than those repopulated with Rictor−/− CD4+
T cells (72.31 ± 7.40, P = 0.0368), confirming
the role of TH2 CD4+ T cells in functional muscle
regeneration.
Muscle structure correlated with the differences
in functional capacity. Histologically, at 6 weeks
after injury, the quadriceps muscle treated with
the C-ECM scaffold appeared similar to that of
healthy controls, with minimal scaffold visible
and repair tissue fully integrated within the sur-
rounding musculature. A large region of fibrous
tissue with active inflammation was present in
muscles treated with the collagen scaffold (Fig.
4C and fig. S11). Rag1−/− mice displayed increased
adipose deposition, fibrosis, scaffold persistence,
and smaller-diameter muscle fibers than their
WT counterparts. At 3 weeks after injury, central-
ly nucleated muscle fibers, which are indicative of
active regeneration or recovery from injury, were
present within the biomaterial scaffold and around
the defect site (Fig. 4D and fig. S12). WT mice
produced muscle with larger, more rounded
fibers, whereas Rag1−/− mice muscles contained
smaller, irregularly shaped fibers, indicating a
defect in muscle regeneration. In addition, the
pathologic Rag1−/− histomorphology was recapit-
ulated in Cd4−/− mice, confirming the role of CD4+
T cells in fibro-adipogenic lineage commitment
(Fig. 4D). Increased gene expression of Adipoq
(adiponectin) confirmed ectopic adipogenesis in
Rag1−/− whole muscle. Similarly, the expression
of Col1a1 (type I collagen) increased in Rag1−/−
mice muscles, highlighting increased fibrosis (Fig.
4E and fig. S13). Although scaffold treatment
reduced fibro- and adipogenesis markers in WT
animals, this benefit was lost in Rag1−/− mice.
We have demonstrated that tissue-derived bio-
material scaffolds enhance the development of a
pro-regenerative immune environment and have
implicated adaptive immune cells, specifically
mTORC2-dependent CD4+ TH2 T cells, in the
process of functional tissue restoration (fig. S14).
Just as cancer research has made great strides in
T cell therapies, these concepts can be translated
to biomaterials design to improve tissue repair and
regeneration (30–33).
