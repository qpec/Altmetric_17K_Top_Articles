IMPORTANCE Registry data show that maternal panic disorder, or anxiety disorders in general,
increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, diagnoses from registries may
be imprecise and may not consider potential confounding factors, such as treatment with
medication and maternal substance use.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in
pregnancy, or medications used to treat these conditions, are associated with adverse
maternal or neonatal pregnancy outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study conducted between July 1, 2005, and
July 14, 2009, recruited women at 137 obstetric practices in Connecticut and Massachusetts
before 17 weeks of pregnancy and reassessed them at 28 (±4) weeks of pregnancy and 8 (±4)
weeks postpartum. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by answers to the World Mental
Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Assessments also gathered information
on treatment with medications and confounding factors, such as substance use, previous
adverse birth outcomes, and demographic factors.
EXPOSURE Panic disorder, GAD, or use of benzodiazepines or serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Among mothers: preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and
hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. Among neonates: low birth weight, use of minor
respiratory interventions, and use of ventilatory support.
RESULTS Of the 2654 women in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 31.0 [5.7] years), most
were non-Hispanic white (1957 [73.7%]), 98 had panic disorder, 252 had GAD, 67 were
treated with a benzodiazepine, and 293 were treated with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
during pregnancy. In adjusted models, neither panic disorder nor GAD was associated with
maternal or neonatal complications of interest. Most medication exposures occurred early in
pregnancy. Maternal benzodiazepine use was associated with cesarean delivery (odds ratio
[OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.36-4.40), low birth weight (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.61-7.26), and use of
ventilatory support for the newborn (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.2-6.9). Maternal serotonin reuptake
inhibitor use was associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (OR, 2.82; 95% CI,
1.58-5.04), preterm birth (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02-2.38), and use of minor respiratory
interventions (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.39-2.37). With maternal benzodiazepine treatment, rates of
ventilatory support increased by 61 of 1000 neonates and duration of gestation was
shortened by 3.6 days; with maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, gestation was
shortened by 1.8 days, 152 of 1000 additional newborns required minor respiratory
interventions, and 53 of 1000 additional women experienced hypertensive diseases of
pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Panic disorder and GAD do not contribute to adverse
pregnancy complications. Women may require treatment with medications during
pregnancy, which can shorten the duration of gestation slightly. Maternal treatment with a
serotonin reuptake inhibitor is also associated with hypertensive disease of pregnancy and
cesarean delivery.

uring pregnancy, up to 5% of women have panic dis-
order and as many as 10% have generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD).1 Although the impact of a maternal
major depressive episode (MDE) has been explored exten-
sively with regard to adverse birth outcomes,2 attention
devoted to anxiety disorders has been sparse. Several
population-based registry studies show associations
between panic disorder and adverse birth outcomes, such as
delivery of a small for gestational age3 or preterm infant.3,4
A small study found that pregnant women with panic disor-
der had smaller babies and shorter gestations than women
without either any psychiatric illness or GAD specifically.5
The presence of any anxiety disorder, as determined by
medical record review, has also been linked to risk of pre-
term birth and delivery by cesarean section.6
The investigations reported above have not considered
possible confounding effects from maternal medication use
and other factors. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs),
which are used to treat panic disorder and GAD in preg-
nancy, are associated with some adverse birth outcomes.
A previous study showed that neonates exposed to an SRI in
pregnancy are more likely to be born preterm than are unex-
posed neonates,7 a finding in line with most research,8,9
including work that used rigorous methods to control for
confounding.10 Use of an SRI in pregnancy has also been
associated with delivery of a low-birth-weight baby in
some11,12 but not all13,14 studies. Mild and time-limited
respiratory problems have also been found in neonates
exposed to SRIs in utero.15 Maternal complications linked
with SRI use include gestational hypertension,16-18
preeclampsia,12,18,19 and cesarean delivery.20,21 Benzodiaz-
epines, also used to treat anxiety disorders, can confound
associations between birth outcomes and SRI use22 or anxi-
ety disorders. They have been implicated in the risk of pre-
term birth,22-25 delivery of a low-birth-weight infant,25 and
neonatal respiratory distress.22,25
In this report, we extend prior work7,26 and specifically
probe the association between exposures of panic disorder,
GAD that endured 1 month rather than 6 months, SRI
and benzodiazepine treatment, and a broader array of
outcomes that include several maternal and neonatal preg-
nancy complications, including (1) hypertensive diseases of
pregnancy (gestational hypertension or preeclampsia),
(2) cesarean delivery, (3) preterm birth, (4) delivery of a low-
birth-weight infant, (5) minor neonatal respiratory interven-
tions, and (6) neonatal ventilatory support. We included
interactions between an MDE and anxiety disorders given
a prior finding that an MDE moderates the effect of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the risk of preterm
birth.26 We hypothesized that panic disorder but not
GAD would increase the risk of preterm or low-birth-weight
delivery. We also hypothesized that benzodiazepine
use would increase the risk of preterm birth, cesarean
delivery, and the use of neonatal ventilatory support,
and that SRI use would be associated with cesarean delivery
and hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. A previous
study showed an association between SRI use and preterm
birth.7
Methods
Study Design
Details of the study have been reported.7 Briefly, this was a co-
hort study conducted between July 1, 2005, and July 14, 2009,
at the Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Con-
necticut, and 137 collaborating hospitals and private prac-
tices throughout Connecticut and southern Massachusetts. All
delivery hospitals provided human participants approval; a
complete list is given in the eAppendix in the Supplement. In
addition, participants provided verbal consent for screening
and written consent for interviews.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Women were eligible if they were at least 18 years of age and
had not yet reached 17 weeks of pregnancy. They were ineli-
gible if they had a known multifetal pregnancy, were receiv-
ing insulin treatment for diabetes, did not speak English or
Spanish, did not have access to a telephone, or had plans to
relocate or voluntarily terminate their pregnancy.
Recruitment and Assessment Procedures
The aim of the parent study was to assess birth outcomes
among women with an MDE or a trauma history or who were
undergoingantidepressanttreatment.Womenweregivenalet-
ter at their usual obstetrical visit and invited to participate in
a study of pregnancy and health. Possible participants pro-
videdasignatureandtelephonenumber,andstudystaffcalled
possible participants and screened them for an MDE or trauma
or use of antidepressant agents. All women who screened posi-
tive for these exposures during a telephone interview were of-
fered participation. We also included a randomly selected non-
exposed comparison group.
Afterscreening,participantswereinterviewedathomeprior

Key Points
Question What is the possible association of anxiety disorders
with maternal and fetal outcomes?
Results In this cohort study of 2654 pregnant women followed up
through pregnancy and the postpartum period, neither panic
disorder nor generalized anxiety disorder was associated with
maternal or neonatal outcomes of interest. With maternal
benzodiazepine treatment, rates of ventilatory support increased
by 61 of 1000 neonates and duration of gestation was shortened
by 3.6 days; with maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor use,
gestation was shortened by 1.8 days, 152 of 1000 additional
newborns required minor respiratory interventions, and 53 of
1000 additional women experienced hypertensive diseases of
pregnancy.
Meaning Neither panic disorder nor generalized anxiety disorder
increased adverse birth outcomes in this analysis; although
antidepressant and benzodiazepine treatment increased some
adverse outcomes, the rate for most events was modest.

 offered treatment referrals or, if there was a question of safety,
we emergently conducted a psychiatric assessment.
Interviewers received a minimum of 4 days of training in
the administration of the interview and completed at least 6
practice interviews and 4 supervised interviews. Interviews
were taped and a subset was reviewed for quality control.
Exposure and Outcome Measures
At each interview, we administered the World Mental Health
Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 2.1, to
identify likely diagnoses of an MDE, GAD, and panic disorder.
This valid, reliable, and fully structured lay interview27 has
been administered to more than 150 000 people from 28 coun-
tries, including pregnant women.28,29 It is reliable when ad-
ministered via the telephone.30 We required a minimum of 1
month, rather than 6 months, of symptoms to meet the crite-
ria for GAD in pregnancy since the interval of follow-up was
short. Previous work showed that this duration is associated
with substantial functional impairment.31 We excluded a di-
agnosis of panic disorder if women had a medical condition
that could account for panic attacks (eg, asthma attacks). We
assessedPTSDwithamodulefromtheMini-InternationalNeu-
ropsychiatric Interview.32 All women were administered the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS),33 which in-
cludes an anxiety subscale.34
Pregnancy dating used an algorithm that prioritized ul-
trasonography results prior to 18 weeks and, if unavailable,
used the last menstrual period. A birth was designated as pre-
term if it occurred before 36 completed weeks of gestation (36
weeks and 6 days). Birth weight and delivery mode were ab-
stracted from the medical record. Low-birth-weight deliver-
ies were designated as those less than 2500 g. Hypertensive
diseases of pregnancy were operationalized as incident hy-
pertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy (and after exposure
to illness or medication for those exposed) or preeclampsia as
designated in the medical record. Minor neonatal respiratory
interventions included delee suction or tracheal suction and
oxygen administration; ventilatory support included use of a
ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure.
Potential Confounding Variables
At the home interview, we obtained information about height,
participant-reported race/ethnicity, prepregnancy weight, and
precedingpregnancyoutcomesaswellcurrentmedicalcompli-
cations,suchasasthma,hyperemesis,hyperthyroidism,andpre-
existing hypertension and use of any substances or prescribed
medications. This information was obtained at each follow-up
interview.Afterdelivery,dataonmaternalillnessesinpregnancy
were also abstracted from medical records.
Possibleconfoundingvariableswereoperationalizedasfol-
lows: heavy alcohol use was defined as 4 or more drinks per
week or 3 or more drinks in 1 sitting any time in pregnancy;
illicit substance use as any use in pregnancy; previous preg-
nancy outcomes were coded as a 2-level categorical variable
(previous preterm birth vs term births only or no previous live
births); age was categorized (<25, 25-34, and ≥35 years); race/
ethnicity included Hispanic, black, white, and other; educa-
tional level was categorized (<12, 12, 13-15, and ≥16 years); and
body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared.
Statistical Analysis
Weadoptedseveralconventionsformissingdata.Ifawomanmet

tialdata(eg,missed1or2interviews)andwasnegativeforadis-
order,weconsideredhernegativeforthatdisorderduringpreg-
nancy. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis using complete
cases. Rates of missing data by visit are in the Figure.
To estimate associations between exposures and out-
comes, we used logistic regression and built separate unad-
justed and adjusted models for each outcome. All adjusted
models included main exposures (panic disorder, GAD, ben-
zodiazepine use, and SRI use) and possible confounders (age,
race/ethnicity,andeducationallevel,aswellassmoking,heavy
drinking, illicit drug use, MDE, and PTSD during pregnancy,

 and minor neonatal respiratory interventions. When model-
ing preterm birth and low birth weight, we adjusted for pre-
vious preterm birth. For the cesarean delivery outcome,
previouscesareandeliverywasincludedasanexplanatoryvari-
able. For all models, the interaction between illness (panic dis-
order, GAD, and MDE) and SRI or benzodiazepine use, as well
as between SRI and benzodiazepine use, was tested to deter-
mine moderating effects of illness or medication. Adjusted risk
differences were calculated using the modified ordinary least
squares method by Cheung.35 We used SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc) for analyses. P < .05 (2-sided) was consid-
ered significant.
Results
Study Enrollment
We screened 9525 women and invited 3517 to participate
(women with an MDE in the past 5 years, with PTSD, or un-
dergoing SRI treatment, as well as randomly selected nonex-
posed participants). In this secondary analysis, exposure
groups were recoded to include panic disorder, GAD, SRI use,
or benzodiazepine treatment. Of the women invited to par-
ticipate, 2793 underwent at least a home interview. This analy-
sis includes 2654 singleton live births.7 Data on birth out-
comes were available for 2634 of the 2654 singleton births
(99.2%). A figure for participant flow is provided in a previ-
ous publication26 and the the eFigure in the Supplement.
Exposure Rates
The Figure shows the proportion of women in the cohort
who met criteria for panic disorder (98 [3.7%]) or GAD (252
[9.5%]) during pregnancy. Rates were highest in the first tri-
mester (61 [2.3%] for panic disorder and 173 [6.5%] for
GAD). At any point in pregnancy, 67 women underwent ben-
zodiazepine treatment, including 56 in the first trimester, 15
in the second trimester, and 11 in the third trimester. A total
of 293 women used SRIs at some point during pregnancy.
More women used SRIs during the first (n = 257) compared
with the second (n = 157) and third (n = 147) trimesters.
Participant Characteristics
Participant characteristics by exposure group are in Table 1.
Most participants were 25 to 34 years of age (1509 [56.9%]),
white(1957[73.7%]),andnon-Hispanic(2271[85.6%]).Women
undergoing treatment with medications were likely to have
multiple psychiatric conditions and to use illegal substances
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Illness severity according to the
EPDS33 and maternal and neonatal outcomes are in eTables 2-5
in the Supplement.

Exposure to a benzodiazepine resulted in the following as-

GAD,andSRIuse:riskofcesareandelivery(oddsratio[OR],2.45;
95% CI, 1.36-4.40) (Table 2), delivery of a low-birth-weight in-
fant (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.61-7.26), and neonatal ventilatory sup-
port(OR,2.85;95%CI,1.17-6.94)(Table3).Estimatedprobabili-

tilatory support per 1000 births (95% CI, 46-76).
We reran these analyses using complete cases and found
similar significant associations. However, the association be-
tween panic disorder and neonatal ventilatory support be-
came significant, and the association between benzodiaz-
epine use and this outcome lost significance.
To better understand the correlation between benzodiaz-
epine use and fetal growth, we conducted a post hoc logistic
regression analysis adjusted for all covariates and used deliv-
ery of small for gestational age infant as the outcome (this out-
come considers size for birth age rather than low birth weight
at any age). The association was not significant (OR, 0.85; 95%
CI, 0.35-2.10). Similarly, because benzodiazepine use in preg-
nancy was marginally associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.98;
95% CI, 0.97-4.04), we used a multiple linear regression model
to test the difference in mean duration of gestation in days be-
tween those using and not using benzodiazepines adjusted for
the same potential confounders included in the preterm birth
model.Exposuretobenzodiazepinesshortenedgestationaldu-
ration by 3.6 days (β = –3.6, SE = 1.7; P = .03).
Use of an SRI was associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.56;
95% CI, 1.02-2.38) (Table 2) as previously reported,7 as well as
theneedforminorneonatalrespiratoryinterventions(OR,1.81;
95% CI, 1.39-2.37) (Table 3). In addition, SRI exposure was as-
sociated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (OR, 2.82;
95% CI, 1.58-5.04) (Table 2). Gestation was 1.8 days shorter in
women who received SRIs during pregnancy compared with
those who did not. Estimated probabilities were 43 addi-
tional preterm births per 1000 births (95% CI, 35-51), 152 ad-
ditionalnewbornsneedingminorrespiratoryinterventionsper
1000 births (95% CI, 47-158), and 53 additional cases of ma-
ternal hypertension per 1000 births (95% CI, 46-60). Sensi-
tivityanalysesthataddedtheanxietysubscaleoftheEDPSwere
consistent with the models presented above.

 diagnosed 252 women as having GAD, but we shortened the re-
quiredsymptomaticperiodfrom6monthsto1month,andwom-
en may have been mildly afflicted in this length of time. Prior
workhasfoundthatcasestatusisnotsubstantiallydifferentfor
GAD that endures 1 vs 6 months.36
Theliteratureonbenzodiazepineuseinpregnancyisdomi-
nated by reports on the risk of fetal malformations. However,
some work25,37 has found that neonates exposed to benzodiaz-
epines in utero are more likely to have respiratory difficulties,
particularlyifexposureislateingestation.Thisfindingalignswith
ourfindingofincreasedneedforventilatorysupportamongneo-
natesexposedtobenzodiazepines,althoughitwasuncommon.
Several reports show an association between preterm birth
and benzodiazepine treatment in pregnancy22,23,38 although
there are inconsistencies.39 Calderon-Margalit et al22 reported
thattheriskofpretermbirthisgreaterifwomenweretreatedlater
rather than earlier in pregnancy. Women in our cohort had pre-
dominantly early exposures to benzodiazepines, and the dura-
tion of gestation was shortened by only 3.6 days.
Confoundingbyindicationmayexplainthelinkageinother
studies between late benzodiazepine use and the risk of pre-
term birth. Women who had pregnancy complications may
have been prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety related to
obstetrical risks. Alternatively, benzodiazepine treatment
proximal to delivery may be more problematic than early treat-
ment in terms of the risk of preterm delivery. γ-Amino bu-
tyric acid agonists can trigger apoptosis,40 which could theo-
retically weaken fetal membranes, but the finding of apoptosis
was in the central nervous system and it is not clear whether
this finding extends to fetal membranes.
Other studies have found that maternal benzodiazepine
use is linked with delivery of a low-birth-weight infant,22,25 but
these investigations showed that the infants were appropri-
ately sized for gestational age.
The associations we found for SRI use in pregnancy (risk
ofpretermbirth,minorneonatalrespiratoryinterventions,and
hypertension diseases of pregnancy) have also been reported
by others.8,17,18,41-43 We found that the absolute difference in
the duration of gestation among women who were or were not
treated with an SRI was only 1.8 days.
Several maternal and neonatal outcomes can be influ-
enced by illness severity and unmeasured confounding fac-
tors. An earlier report investigated the role of illness severity
(early onset of depression, hospitalization, and suicidal ide-
ation) on the risk of preterm birth among women treated with
SRIs in pregnancy.7 The association was attenuated only
slightly. As shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement, the mean
EPDSscorewasnothigherforwomentreatedwithSRIsinpreg-

not confound associations with this exposure.

Often, mothers have the clearest sense of their risk of relapse if
