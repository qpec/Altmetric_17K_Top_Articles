Since the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), reports of microcephaly have increased
considerably in Brazil; however, causality between the viral epidemic and malformations
in fetal brains needs further confirmation. We examined the effects of ZIKV infection
in human neural stem cells growing as neurospheres and brain organoids. Using
immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy, we showed that ZIKV targets
human brain cells, reducing their viability and growth as neurospheres and brain
organoids. These results suggest that ZIKV abrogates neurogenesis during
human brain development.
P
rimary microcephaly is a severe brain mal-
formation characterized by the reduction
of the head circumference. Patients dis-
play a heterogeneous range of brain im-
pairments that compromise motor, visual,
hearing, and cognitive functions (1).
Microcephaly is associated with decreased
neuronal production as a consequence of pro-
liferative defects and death of cortical progenitor
cells (2). During pregnancy, the primary etiology
of microcephaly varies from genetic mutations
to external insults. The so-called TORCHS fac-
tors (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus,
herpes virus, and syphilis) are the main con-
genital infections that compromise brain devel-
opment in utero (3).
An increase in the rate of microcephaly in
Brazil has been associated with the recent out-
break of Zika virus (ZIKV) (4, 5), a flavivirus that
is transmitted by mosquitoes (6) and sexually
(7–9). So far, ZIKV has been described in the
placenta and amniotic fluid of microcephalic
fetuses (10–13) and in the blood of microcephalic
newborns (11, 14). ZIKV had also been detected
within the brain of a microcephalic fetus (13, 14),
and recently, direct evidence has emerged that
ZIKV is able to infect and cause the death of
neural stem cells (15).
We used human induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells cultured as neural stem cells (NSCs),
neurospheres, and brain organoids to explore
the consequences of ZIKV infection during neu-
rogenesis and growth with three-dimensional
culture models. Human iPS-derived NSCs were
exposed to ZIKV [multiplicity of infection (MOI),
0.25 to 0.0025]. After 24 hours, ZIKV was de-
tected in NSCs (Fig. 1, A to D); viral envelope
protein was evident in 10.10% (MOI, 0.025) and
21.7% (MOI, 0.25) of cells exposed to ZIKV (Fig.
1E). Viral RNA was also detected in the super-
natant of infected NSCs (MOI, 0.0025) by quan-
titative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 1F), providing evidence
of productive infection.
To investigate the effects of ZIKV during
neural differentiation, mock- and ZIKV-infected
NSCs were cultured as neurospheres. After
3 days in vitro (DIV), mock-infected NSCs gen-
erated round neurospheres. However, ZIKV-
infected NSCs generated neurospheres with
morphological abnormalities and cell detach-
ment (Fig. 2B). After 6 DIV, hundreds of neu-
rospheres grew under mock conditions (Fig. 2,
C and E). In ZIKV-infected NSCs (MOI, 2.5 to
0.025), only a few neurospheres survived (Fig.
2, D and E).
Mock-infected neurospheres presented the
expected ultrastructural morphology of the nu-
cleus and mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Viral particles
were present in ZIKV-infected neurospheres,
similar to those observed in murine glial and
neuronal cells (16). ZIKV was bound to the mem-
branes and observed in mitochondria and ves-
icles of cells within infected neurospheres
(arrows in Fig. 3, B and F). Apoptotic nuclei,
a hallmark of cell death, were observed in all
ZIKV-infected neurospheres that we analyzed
(Fig. 3B). ZIKV-infected cells in neurospheres
presented smooth membrane structures (Fig. 3,
B and F), similar to other cell types infected
with dengue virus (17). These results suggest
that ZIKV induces cell death in human neural
stem cells and thus impairs the formation of
neurospheres.
To further investigate the impact of ZIKV
infection during neurogenesis, human iPS-
derived brain organoids (18) were exposed
to ZIKV and observed for 11 DIV (Fig. 4). The
growth rates of 12 individual organoids (six
mock- and six ZIKV-infected) were measured
during this period (Fig. 4, A to D). As a result
of ZIKV infection, the average growth area
of ZIKV-exposed organoids was reduced by
40% compared with brain organoids under
mock conditions [0.624 ± 0.064 mm2 for ZIKV-
exposed organoids versus 1.051 ± 0.1084 mm2
for mock-infected organoids (normalized);
Fig. 4E].

 We used cells infected with dengue virus 2
(DENV2), a flavivirus with genetic similarities
to ZIKV (11, 19), as a second control group in
addition to the mock infection group. One day
after viral exposure, DENV2 infected human
NSCs at a similar rate as that of ZIKV (fig. S1,
A and B). However, after 3 DIV, there was no
increase in caspase 3/7–mediated cell death
induced by DENV2 at the same MOI of 0.025
that was used for ZIKV infection (fig. S1, C
and D). In contrast, ZIKV induced caspase 3/
7–mediated cell death in NSCs, consistent with
the results described by Tang and colleagues
(15). After 6 DIV, cell viability significantly dif-
fered between ZIKV-exposed NSCs and DENV2-
exposed NSCs (fig. S1, E and F). In addition,
neurospheres exposed to DENV2 displayed a
round morphology similar to that of uninfected
neurospheres after 6 DIV (fig. S1G). Last, there
was no reduction of growth in brain organoids
that were exposed to DENV2 for 11 days, relative
to those grown under mock conditions [1.023 ±
0.1308 mm2 for DENV2-infected organoids versus
1.011 ± 0.2471 mm2 for mock-infected organoids
(normalized); fig. S1, H and I]. These results sug-
gest that the deleterious consequences of ZIKV
infection in human NSCs, neurospheres, and
brain organoids are not a general feature of the
flavivirus family. Neurospheres and brain organ-
oids are complementary models for studying
embryonic brain development in vitro (20, 21).
Whereas neurospheres present the very early
characteristics of neurogenesis, brain organoids
recapitulate the orchestrated cellular and molecu-
lar early events comparably to the first-trimester
fetal neocortex, including gene expression and
cortical layering (18, 22). Our results demon-
strate that ZIKV induces cell death in human
iPS-derived NSCs, disrupts the formation of neu-
rospheres, and reduces the growth of organoids
(fig. S2). These models mimic the first trimester
of brain development, indicating that ZIKV infec-
tion during this developmental time window
may result in severe damage. Other studies are
necessary to further characterize the consequences
of ZIKV infection during different stages of fetal
development.
Cell death that impairs brain enlargement,
calcification, and microcephaly are well described
in congenital infections with TORCHS factors
(3, 23, 24). Our results, together with recent
studies showing brain calcification in micro-
cephalic fetuses and newborns infected with
ZIKV (10, 14), reinforce the growing body of evi-
dence connecting the ZIKV outbreak to the in-
creased reports of congenital brain malformations
in Brazil.
