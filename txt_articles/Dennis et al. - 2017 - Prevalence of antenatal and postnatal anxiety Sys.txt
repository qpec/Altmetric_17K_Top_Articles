 Perinatal mental health is a leading public health issue because of
its negative effect on both maternal and child outcomes and its
significant economic cost to society if left untreated.1,2 A common
mental health problem women experience during the perinatal
(pregnancy and postpartum) period is anxiety3 and despite it
being a frequent comorbidity with depression,4 it has received
limited attention from researchers and health professionals. This
is an important clinical omission given the ever-growing evidence
indicating maternal anxiety both antenatally and postnatally may
lead to serious negative outcomes. Maternal antenatal anxiety has
been associated with increased childbirth fear,5 a preference for
Caesarean section delivery,6 decreased effective coping strategies,7
higher rates of eating disorders8 and an increased risk for suicide.9
It also has important neonatal implications as it has been linked
to increased preterm birth rates,10,11 lower Apgar scores12 and
decreased birth length.13 Further, antenatal anxiety is a risk
factor for poor child developmental trajectories.14 In a study
conducted
in
the
Netherlands,
antenatal
anxiety
early
in
pregnancy significantly increased the risk for cognitive disorders
in children at 14 and 15 years of age.15 In the same population,
hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that maternal
anxiety at 12–22 weeks’ gestation explained 22%, 15% and 9%
of the variance in cross-situational attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder symptoms, externalising problems and self-reported
anxiety, respectively, among Dutch children aged 8 and 9 years.16
The link between antenatal anxiety and behavioural/emotional
problems in children at 4 years of age after adjusting for covariates
has also been reported in a UK study.17 More recently, maternal
antenatal anxiety was associated with an increased risk of
child attention problems after accounting for confounders.18
Similar adverse effects have been found for maternal postnatal
anxiety, which has been associated with negative and disengaged
parenting19–21 and overcontrolling maternal behaviours that
increase
the
likelihood
of
internalising
and
externalising
difficulties in the child.20,22,23 The emergent evidence highlights
the need for early identification of maternal anxiety across the
perinatal
period
and the
provision
of
effective
treatment.
However, reliable estimates of maternal anxiety to guide clinical
interventions are unknown because of widely varying published
prevalence rates. The aim of this systematic review was to establish
summary estimates for the prevalence of maternal anxiety in the
antenatal and postnatal periods.
Method
Search strategy and study eligibility
The protocol and reporting of the results of this systematic
review and meta-analysis were based on PRISMA guidelines.24
Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE,
Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, ResearchGate and
Google Scholar from 1950 until 13 January 2016 using predefined
key terms (online Table DS1) such as (postpartum OR puerperium
OR pregnancy OR gestation OR postbirth OR post-birth OR
antenatal OR prenatal OR postnatal) AND (mood disorders OR
depressive disorder OR depression OR depressive symptoms
OR anxiety disorders OR anxiety). We used MeSH terms and
key words in MEDLINE and Emtree terms and key words in
Embase. The titles and abstracts of all identified citations were
screened for relevance and the full text of potentially relevant
articles were obtained and assessed for eligibility. In addition,
the reference lists of relevant articles were hand searched.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they: (a) included women
who were 16 years or older; (b) assessed for antenatal or postnatal
anxiety using a validated diagnostic or self-report instrument;

Prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety:
systematic review and meta-analysis
Cindy-Lee Dennis, Kobra Falah-Hassani and Rahman Shiri
Background
Maternal anxiety negatively influences child outcomes.
Reliable estimates have not been established because of
varying published prevalence rates.
Aims
To establish summary estimates for the prevalence of
maternal anxiety in the antenatal and postnatal periods.
Method
We searched multiple databases including MEDLINE, Embase,
and PsycINFO to identify studies published up to January
2016 with data on the prevalence of antenatal or postnatal
anxiety. Data were extracted from published reports and any
missing information was requested from investigators.
Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses.
Results
We reviewed 23 468 abstracts, retrieved 783 articles and
included 102 studies incorporating 221 974 women from 34
countries. The prevalence for self-reported anxiety symptoms
was 18.2% (95% CI 13.6–22.8) in the first trimester, 19.1%
(95% CI 15.9–22.4) in the second trimester and 24.6% (95% CI
21.2–28.0) in the third trimester. The overall prevalence for
a clinical diagnosis of any anxiety disorder was 15.2%
(95% CI 9.0–21.4) and 4.1% (95% CI 1.9–6.2) for a generalised
anxiety disorder. Postnatally, the prevalence for anxiety
symptoms overall at 1–24 weeks was 15.0% (95% CI
13.7–16.4). The prevalence for any anxiety disorder over the
same period was 9.9% (95% CI 6.1–13.8), and 5.7% (95% CI
2.3–9.2) for a generalised anxiety disorder. Rates were higher
in low- to middle-income countries.
Conclusions
Results suggest perinatal anxiety is highly prevalent and
merits clinical attention. Research is warranted to develop
evidence-based interventions.

Review article
 (c) reported the results of peer-reviewed research based on cross-
sectional or cohort studies; and (d) provided data in order to
estimate the prevalence of anxiety. Studies were excluded if they:
(a) were conducted among self-selected volunteers; (b) recruited
high-risk women; (c) reported results for only a subsample of a
study population; (d) reported duplicate data from a single
database; (e) reported only mean data; (e) reported combined
prevalence for depression and anxiety; or (f) did not report a
cut-off point for anxiety. We contacted over 70 authors for
additional information, particularly those who reported only
mean data, no cut-off data or had missing information, with
approximately a third providing us with additional results. For
studies with duplicate data from a single database, we selected
the study with the larger sample size.
Data extraction and quality assessment
We extracted individual details of the included studies such as year
of publication, study population, recruitment method, sample size
used in the analysis, measure of anxiety, cut-off points, timing of
assessments and prevalence of anxiety variously defined. The risk
of bias in the included studies was independently rated by two
reviewers (K.F.-H. and R.S.) using criteria adapted from the
Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool
for observational studies.25 Three domains were assessed: selection
bias, detection bias and attrition bias. Selection bias was classified
as: (a) low: likely to be representative of the target population or
subgroup of the target population (i.e. specific age group or
geographic area) and response rate was 80% or higher; (b)
moderate: likely to be somewhat representative of the target
population or a restricted subgroup of the target population
and response rate was 60–79%; or (c) high: target population
was self-referred/volunteers, or response rate was less than 60%.
Detection bias was classified as follows: (a) low: the outcome
was defined by clinical diagnosis; (b) moderate: the outcome
was assessed by a validated questionnaire; or (c) high: the outcome
was self-reported. Finally, attrition bias was classified as follows:
(a) low: follow-up participation rate was more than 80% or missing
data was less than 20%; (b) moderate: follow-up participation rate
was 60–79% or missing data was 20–40%; or (c) high: follow-up
participation rate was less than 60% or missing data was more
than 40%. Any disagreements in quality ratings were resolved by
discussion (K.F.-H., R.S.), and if necessary with the involvement
of another author (C.-L.D.).
Data synthesis and analysis
Many studies reported an estimate for the prevalence of antenatal
or postnatal anxiety for more than one time point for the same
participants. In order to include each study with multiple time-
points only once in a specific meta-analysis, an overall prevalence
of antenatal or postnatal anxiety was estimated using an average
sample size and an average number of events (for example
estimate for the 1–24 weeks’ postnatal anxiety symptoms). The
prospective cohort studies included in the current meta-analysis
determined the prevalence of anxiety rather than the incidence
of anxiety. We therefore combined both cross-sectional and cohort
studies in a single analysis. Anxiety was assessed using diverse
measures, cut-off scores and perinatal time periods. We performed
meta-analyses based on the following anxiety categories: (a) self-
reported state anxiety symptoms, (b) self-reported trait anxiety,
(c) clinical diagnosis of any anxiety disorder, and (d) clinical
diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder. We further performed
analyses according to pregnancy trimester and postpartum time
period. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to combine the
estimates of different studies.26 The presence of heterogeneity
across the studies was assessed using the I 2-statistic.27 An
I 2-statistic less than 25% indicates small inconsistency and more
than 50% indicates large inconsistency.27 We used meta-regression
to assess the differences between subgroups.26 We performed
subgroup analyses according to year of publication (52009 v.
42010), income of study country based on World Bank categories
(low to middle income v. high income), selection bias and
attrition bias. Stata (version 13) was used for the meta-analyses.
Results
Study characteristics
The study selection process is presented in Fig. 1. The literature
search yielded 23 468 unique references, of which 22 685 were
excluded following title and abstract screening. Overall, 783 full
papers were retrieved and assessed. Of these, 183 papers were
relevant following full-text screening: 174 were identified from
searches of electronic databases and 9 from hand searches of
references. From these 183 studies, a further 81 were excluded
primarily for only having mean anxiety scores (n = 35) and
volunteer samples (n = 18). In total, 102 studies on antenatal or
postnatal anxiety were included in the meta-analyses with
assistance from 26 authors who were contacted and provided
additional information to allow their studies to be incorporated
(see Acknowledgements).
Characteristics of the included studies are provided in online
Table DS2. In total, 70 studies provided data on the prevalence
of antenatal anxiety and 57 studies provided data related to
postnatal anxiety. The studies were conducted in 34 different
countries spanning six continents and included 221 974 women.

 Prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety
The countries with the largest number of included studies
comprised the USA (n = 19), Australia (n = 11), Brazil (n = 9),
Canada (n = 8), France (n = 4), Netherlands (n = 4), Norway
(n = 4), UK (n = 4), Germany (n = 3) and Sweden (n = 3). Ten
countries from the Asian continent provided data (Bangladesh,
China, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore and Vietnam) as did four countries from Africa
(Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania). In total, there were
24 countries classified as low to middle income using World Bank
categories. The majority of studies used the self-report State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to measure state anxiety symptoms
(n = 51) or trait anxiety (n = 24). The most common diagnostic
interviews to assess for any anxiety disorders or generalised
anxiety disorder were the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (n = 6), Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(n = 5) and Structural Clinical Interview for DSM (n = 5). When
evaluated by the modified Effective Public Health Practice Project
Quality Assessment Tool, eight studies were rated as having low
risk of selection bias, 69 as having moderate risk and 25 studies
as having high risk (Table 2). In total, 17 studies were rated as
having low risk of detection bias, 85 as having moderate risk,
and none as having high risk. For attrition bias, 77 studies were
rated as low risk, 17 as moderate risk and 8 as high risk.
Prevalence of antenatal anxiety
Meta-analytic pooling of the estimates yielded the prevalence of
self-reported anxiety symptoms to be 18.2% (95% CI 13.6–22.8,
10 studies, n = 10 577)6,12,28–35 for the first trimester, 19.1%
(95% CI 15.9–22.4, 17 studies, n= 24 499)10,12,29,31,32,34–45 for
the second trimester and 24.6% (95% CI 21.2–28.0, 33 studies,
n = 116 720)3,5,7,12,13,29–32,34,35,37,40,43,44,46–63 for the third trimester
(Table 1 and Fig. 2). The overall pooled prevalence for self-reported
anxiety symptoms across the three trimesters was 22.9% (95% CI
20.5–25.2, 52 studies, n= 142 833). The prevalence for self-
reported trait anxiety was 29.1% (95% CI 11.7–46.4, 4 studies,
n = 2388) for the first trimester, and 32.5% (95% CI 27.6–37.4,
12 studies, n= 5568) for the third trimester. The prevalence for
a clinical diagnosis of any anxiety disorder was 18.0% (95%
CI 15.0–21.1, 2 studies, n= 615) for the first trimester, 15.2%
(95% CI 3.6–26.7, 4 studies, n= 3002) for the second trimester
and 15.4% (95% CI 5.1–25.6, 4 studies, n= 1603) for the third
trimester. The prevalence of a clinical diagnosis of a generalised
anxiety disorder was 5.3% (95% CI 1.5–9.1, 3 studies, n= 3338)
for the first trimester, 0.3% (95 CI % 0.1–0.6, 2 studies,
n = 1862) and 4.1% (95% CI 1.0–7.2, 4 studies, n= 1455) for the
second and third trimester, respectively. Overall, the prevalence
of any anxiety disorder across the three trimesters was 15.2%
(95% CI 9.0–21.4, 9 studies, n= 4648, Table 1 and online Fig.
DS1) and that of a generalised anxiety disorder was 4.1% (95%
CI 1.9–6.2, 10 studies, n= 6910, Table 1 and online Fig. DS2).
Prevalence of postnatal anxiety
The prevalence of self-reported anxiety symptoms was 17.8% (95%
CI 14.2–21.4, 14 studies, n= 10 928) at 1–4 weeks postpartum,
14.9% (95% CI 12.3–17.5, 22 studies, n= 19 158) at 5–12 weeks
postpartum, 15.0% (95% CI 13.7–16.4, 39 studies, n= 145 293)
at 1–24 weeks postpartum, and 14.8% (95% CI 10.9–18.8, 7
studies, n= 11 528) at >24 weeks postpartum (Table 2 and online
Fig. DS3). The prevalence of having a clinical diagnosis of any

2 and online Fig. DS1).The prevalence of a generalised anxiety dis-
order was 6.7% (95% CI 0.6–12.7, 4 studies, n= 1979) at 5–12
weeks postpartum, 5.7% (95% CI 2.3–9.2, 6 studies, n= 2667) at
1–24 weeks postpartum, and 4.2% (95% CI 1.5–6.9, 4 studies,
n = 1950) at >24 weeks postpartum (Table 2 and online Fig. DS2).
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
Excluding studies with high risk of selection or attrition bias did not
change markedly the estimates for the prevalence of antenatal and
postnatal anxiety symptoms, any anxiety disorder or a generalised
anxiety disorder (Tables 1 and 2). The prevalence of antenatal and
postnatal anxiety symptoms as well as that of antenatal and post-
natal anxiety disorder did not differ with regard to year of publication
(42010 v. 52009), selection bias and attrition bias (Table 3).
However, the prevalence of antenatal anxiety symptoms across all
trimesters was significantly higher in low- to middle-income
countries (34.4%, 95% CI 25.0–43.8, 13 studies, n= 5089) in
comparison with high-income countries (19.4% 95% CI 17.0–21.8,
39 studies, n= 137 744). The prevalence of postnatal anxiety symp-
toms across the first 6 months postpartum was also significantly
higher in low- to middle-income countries (25.9%, 95% CI 13.7–
38.1, 5 studies, n= 2159) in comparison with high-income countries
(13.7%, 95% CI 12.3–15.0, 34 studies, n= 143 134) (Table 3). Studies
with moderate or high risk of selection bias may have overestimated
the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety symptoms.
Discussion
Main findings
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate
the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety. Included were
102 studies involving 221 974 women from 34 countries with 26
study authors providing additional information to promote the
comprehensiveness and generalisability of the meta-analytic
results. Overall, the prevalence rate for self-report anxiety
symptoms in the first trimester was 18.2% increasing as the
pregnancy progressed to 24.6% in the third trimester. The
prevalence of anxiety symptoms across the three trimesters was
22.9%. Postnatally, 17.8% of women experienced significant
anxiety symptoms in the first 4 weeks following childbirth but
rates stabilised to approximately 15% thereafter. When diagnostic
interviews were employed, the prevalence rate for any anxiety
disorder during the first trimester was 18% decreasing marginally
to approximately 15% in the final two trimesters of pregnancy.
The prevalence of any anxiety disorder continued to decrease
postnatally and ranged from 9.3 to 9.9% across the first year. As
expected, rates for a generalised anxiety disorder were lower at
4% across the pregnancy and increased slightly to 4.2–5.7%
postnatally. Overall, our findings demonstrate anxiety is a
common mental health problem among pregnant and postpartum
women internationally and that rates are significantly higher in
this maternal population than in the general adult population.64,65
In interpreting the results, it is important to note that the
majority of studies assessed anxiety using self-report instruments
that measured anxiety symptoms rather than gold-standard
diagnostic clinical interviews for various anxiety disorders.
Although the sensitivity and specificity of these self-report
instruments vary substantially, the most frequently used measure
in this review was the STAI, a finding consistent with previous
research.66 Self-report measures do have limitations, such as
potentially inflated prevalence estimates, but they also have high
clinical utility in obstetric/midwifery, public health and primary
care practices, where the majority of perinatal mental health

problems are managed. Health professionals in these settings often
have limited clinical expertise and time for diagnostic interviews
and with research clearly suggesting informal surveillance misses
at least 50% of cases,67 self-report measures are crucial for
systematic case identification. To reflect the heterogeneity of the
measures included in this meta-analysis, a range of prevalence
estimates was reported in addition to a single estimate.
Prevalence rates in different countries
The varying prevalence rates between the included studies may
further be attributed to diverse settings, recruitment strategies,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, data-collection methods and
follow-up time periods. Language or translation complexities
and variations in conveying psychiatric symptoms are other
potential methodological issues.68 However, there might also be
real differences in prevalence rates because of cultural influences.
This may partially explain the significantly higher self-reported
anxiety rates found both antenatally and postnatally between
low- to middle-income countries and high-income countries in
this review. Whereas genetic and neurobiological determinants
are probably evenly distributed among all women and are relevant
aetiological factors,68 the distribution of anxiety may be different
across cultures, supporting environmental influences in the
aetiology of perinatal anxiety. Our results are consistent with
another systematic review that found rates of ‘common perinatal
mental disorders’ among World Bank categorised low- and
middle-income countries were significantly greater than those
reported in high-income countries.69 Together, these findings
challenge the idea that women’s mental health is protected by
culturally prescribed traditional postpartum rituals. There is also
growing evidence that many risk factors for perinatal mental
health in low- and middle-income countries may be influenced
by conditions that transcend the woman’s control. These risk
factors include gender-based issues such as bias against female
infants, restricted housework and infant care roles, and excessive
unpaid workloads especially in multigenerational households.69
Perinatal mental health in low- and middle-income countries
has only recently started to receive attention partially because
of previous priorities targeting maternal mortality. As such, in
this review there were considerably more studies conducted in
high-income countries than in low- to middle-income countries.
High-quality research addressing perinatal mental health in
low- and middle-income countries is warranted to guide clinical
interventions and policies.
Prevalence rates over time
Although the media often portrays an increase in anxiety
prevalence rates, there is no reliable evidence to support the
notion that mental disorders in general are rising.70,71 This is
consistent with our results where we found no difference in
prevalence rates for anxiety symptoms or disorders between
studies published before 2010 and those published afterwards.
However, rates of mental health treatment seeking have increased
and may be the reason for the general perception that anxiety is
more prevalent.68 Despite improvements in treatment, anxiety
remains undetected and untreated in the general population72
and in perinatal women. To date, perinatal mental health research
and clinical practice has disproportionately targeted depression

 Prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety
with limited attention on anxiety. This is an important omission
given a recent review indicating clinically relevant associations
between antenatal anxiety and adverse child outcomes, with a
10 to 15% attributable risk of child behavioural problems related
to antenatal anxiety and stress.14
Comorbid maternal depression and anxiety
The importance of comorbid maternal depression and anxiety has
been highlighted in several studies. An Australian study found that
a third of pregnant and postnatal women with major depression
had
comorbid
anxiety.73
In
a
US
population-based
study
incorporating 4451 postpartum women, a third of women with
anxiety symptoms also reported depressive symptoms.74 Assessing
comorbidity is important because research with non-postnatal
populations has shown that comorbid depression and anxiety
manifests into more severe symptoms with poorer acute and
long-term outcomes,75 is more difficult to treat than each disorder
alone,76 increases the risk for suicide77 and requires specific
treatment strategies for both sets of symptoms.75 The US Task
Force for Prevention Screening now endorses screening for
perinatal depression,78 however, not identifying anxiety symptoms
as well underestimates the prevalence of mental health disorders
and the need for perinatal mental health services. Matthey et
al79 suggests there is a ‘hierarchical diagnostic custom’ where
depression takes precedence in clinical practice even when anxiety
symptoms are a prominent feature. This focus on depression can
result in individuals with anxiety (but without depression) being
undetected and untreated.
Trait anxiety
Finally, trait anxiety, a condition clinically different from state
anxiety symptoms, refers to the tendency to report negative
emotions such as fears and worries across situations and is
characterised by a stable perception of environmental stimuli as
threatening. In this review, trait anxiety was high with prevalence
rates ranging from 29 to 33% antenatally and decreasing to 23%
postnatally. Although rarely examined, antenatal trait anxiety
has been associated with increased risk for preterm birth among
African American women.80 If trait anxiety is an enduring
maternal characteristic then its impact on the child is also likely
to continue postnatally. This notion is supported in several
studies. In a prospective US study with pregnant women,
increasing trait anxiety was associated with poorer overall infant
cognition.81 In an Australian study, trait anxiety was a predictor
of maternal report of difficult infant temperament at 4–6 months
postpartum.82 Further, a German study found trait anxiety was
significantly correlated with impaired maternal bonding.49 These
results suggest that maternal trait anxiety may be as important
as state anxiety symptoms or disorders and warrants further
investigation. Antenatal psychological treatment interventions
such as cognitive behavioural therapy may optimise child
outcomes.82 Further, treating maternal trait anxiety may be an
important step to determine whether reducing trait anxiety has
a direct effect on preterm birth risk.80
Implications
The prevalence of maternal anxiety in the antenatal and postnatal
periods were estimated among 221 974 women from 34 countries.
Results suggest anxiety across the perinatal period is highly
prevalent and merits clinical attention similar to that given to
perinatal depression. Prevalence rates were significantly higher
in low- to middle-income countries possibly indicating cultural
influences. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease
paradigm
(DOHaD)83
suggests
that
human
health
and
development have their origin in early life from conception to
early childhood. During this period, the interplay between
maternal and environmental factors programme fetal and child
development through physiological changes that have long-lasting
consequences on later health. Research to develop evidence-based
interventions to reduce fetal and child exposure to risk factors
such as perinatal anxiety is warranted in order to promote healthy
child development.
