ORIGINAL ARTICLE
Background: Biomass burning is an important source of ambient 
fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) in many regions of the world.
Methods: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study of 
ambient PM2.5 and hospital admissions for myocardial infarction 
(MI) in three regions of British Columbia, Canada. Daily hospital 
admission data were collected between 2008 and 2015 and PM2.5 
data were collected from fixed site monitors. We used conditional 
logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) describing 
the association between PM2.5 and the risk of hospital admission for 
MI. We used stratified analyses to evaluate effect modification by 
biomass burning as a source of ambient PM2.5 using the ratio of levo-
glucosan/PM2.5 mass concentrations.
Results: Each 5 µg/m3 increase in 3-day mean PM2.5 was associ-
ated with an increased risk of MI among elderly subjects (≥65 
years; OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08); risk was not increased 
among younger subjects. Among the elderly, the strongest asso-
ciation occurred during colder periods (<6.44°C); when we strati-
fied analyses by tertiles of monthly mean biomass contributions 
to PM2.5 during cold periods, ORs of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.36), 
1.08 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.09), and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.06) were 
observed in the upper, middle, and lower tertiles (Ptrend = 0.003), 
respectively.
Conclusion: Short-term changes in ambient PM2.5 were associated 
with an increased risk of MI among elderly subjects. During cold 
periods, increased biomass burning contributions to PM2.5 may mod-
ify its association with MI.

A
mbient fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) has a strong 
adverse association with cardiovascular health.1,2 How-
ever, relatively few epidemiologic studies have specifically 
evaluated the cardiovascular health impacts of PM2.5 from 
biomass burning3,4 and further evaluation is needed.5
Biomass burning is an important source of ambient air 
pollution in many regions of the world and has been shown 
to be associated with inflammation, coagulation, and lipid 
peroxidation, which are important factors in the development 
of cardiovascular disease.3,6 Moreover, exposure to wildfire 
smoke has been associated with increased systemic inflam-
mation7,8 and in controlled exposure settings short-term 
exposures to dilute wood smoke have been associated with 
increased arterial stiffness and decreased heart rate vari-
ability.9 In addition, exposure to PM2.5 from bush fires has 
been associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.10,11 Fur-
thermore, recent evidence suggests that PM2.5 from biomass 
burning may have increased oxidative potential12,13 and may 
contribute to cardiovascular mortality.14 However, other stud-
ies have failed to observe significant associations between 
short-term exposures to wood smoke and cardiac arrhyth-
mia15 or biomarkers of systemic inflammation.16 Likewise, 
some studies have reported null associations between forest 
fire smoke exposure and physician visits/hospital admissions 
for cardiovascular outcomes.17
In this study, we examined the association between 
short-term changes in ambient PM2.5 and hospital admissions 
for myocardial infarction (MI) in three regions of British 
Columbia, Canada impacted by biomass burning including 
residential wood burning (winter), forest fires (summer), and 
burning for land clearing (spring and autumn). In addition, 
we explored potential effect modification by biomass burn-
ing as a source of ambient PM2.5 using the cellulose combus-
tion product levoglucosan as a source-specific marker.

METHODS
Study Design and Population
A time-stratified case-crossover design18 was used to esti-
mate the association between daily variations in ambient PM2.5 
and hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Code I21) in 
three regions of British Columbia, Canada impacted by biomass 
burning: Prince George (population: 72,000), Kamloops (popu-
lation: 85,000), and Courtenay/Comox (population: 50,000). 
Cases occurring between 1 January 2008 and 31 March 2015 
were extracted from the Discharge Abstract Database main-
tained by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) 
along with demographic information to describe the case popu-
lation. Ambient PM2.5 data for Kamloops and Courtenay were 
available beginning in 2010 and 2011, respectively; therefore, 
cases in these cities were excluded if they occurred before the 
start of PM2.5 monitoring. All MI cases with residential three 
digit postal codes corresponding to these cities at the time of 
admission were eligible to be included in the analyses. Health 
Canada’
s Research Ethics Board approved this study.
Prospective Fixed Site Monitoring of 
Levoglucosan in PM2.5
Daily mean levoglucosan data were collected prospec-
tively in each city over a 1-year period to characterize tempo-
ral trends in the contribution of biomass burning to ambient 
PM2.5. These data were used to estimate monthly mean bio-
mass burning contributions to ambient PM2.5 (i.e., levoglu-
cosan/PM2.5). Twenty-four-hour mean PM2.5 concentrations 
(for levoglucosan analyses) were monitored in each location 
between 1 January 2014 and 31 March 2015 using Thermo 
Partisol 2025i monitors (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) 
located at the same provincial monitoring sites where PM2.5 
measurements were collected. Samples were collected 
between 7:00 am and 7:00 am to facilitate technician visits 
to each site. All PM2.5 filters underwent gravimetric analyses 
and were subsequently analyzed for levoglucosan by ion chro-
matography to provide an estimate of the daily contribution 
(levoglucosan/PM2.5) of biomass burning to ambient PM2.5.19
Daily mean PM2.5 data from provincial fixed site moni-
tors (one site in each city) were compiled for the entire study 
period (Prince George: 2008–2015; Kamloops: 2010–2015; 
Courtenay: 2011–2015) along with daily meteorological 
data and these data were used for case-crossover analyses 
(described below). In Prince George, PM2.5 data were collected 
using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), 
whereas BAM (Beta-Attenuation Monitor) 1020 instruments 
were used in Kamloops and Courtenay. Daily data for ambi-
ent NO2 and O3 were also compiled for use in two-pollutant 
models as sensitivity analyses.
Spatial Monitoring of Levoglucosan in PM2.5
Small-scale spatial monitoring studies were conducted 
in each city to characterize spatial variations in wood smoke 
contributions to PM2.5 across each region. Specifically, two 
weekly samples of PM2.5 and levoglucosan were collected 
each month at eight sites located across each community 
between September 2014 and March 2015 using cascade 
impactors at a flow rate of 5 L/minute. These data were used to 
develop linear regression models (described below) to adjust 
central-site measurements of PM2.5 (from provincial moni-
tors) and levoglucosan (from Thermo Partisol 2025i monitors 
colocated with provincial monitors) to more accurately reflect 
spatial variations across each region. This is an important con-
sideration as wood smoke is known to exhibit large spatial 
variations.20
The locations of spatial monitoring sites were selected 
based on the spatial distribution of cases mapped across each 
region. Specifically, while we did not have access to six-digit 
postal codes (which represent approximately one city block), 
CIHI provided anonymous maps of the geographic centroids 
of six-digit postal codes of cases which allowed us to position 
monitors to capture regions in which the cases lived. More-
over, using the geographic coordinates of each spatial moni-
toring site, CIHI identified the monitor closest to the residence 
of each case; therefore, spatial corrections for PM2.5 and levo-
glucosan were based on the monitor closest to each subjects’ 
residence. The median (interquartile range, IQR) distance 
between spatial monitoring sites and the centroids of six-digit 
postal codes was 1040 m (IQR = 623–2006 m).
Statistical Analysis
Spatial Adjustment Models for Levoglucosan  
in PM2.5
We used linear regression models to describe the 
relationship between mean levoglucosan concentrations at 
each of the spatial monitoring sites in each city and values 
measured at the central monitoring site (city-specific linear 
regression models are available in eTable 1; http://links.lww.
com/EDE/B172). These models were used to adjust central-
site measurements in each city to reflect spatial differences 
across each region. For levoglucosan, spatial adjustments 
were based only on the slopes of linear regression models 
(i.e., intercepts were assumed to be zero) as the imprecise 
nature of model intercepts often resulted in negative or unre-
alistically large values for levoglucosan compared with fixed 
site values. In nearly all levoglucosan models, 95% con-
fidence interval estimates for intercept values included the 
null; therefore, linear regression slopes were used as scaling 
factors to account for spatial differences in levoglucosan con-
centrations across each region.
Case-crossover Analyses
We used conditional logistic regression models to esti-
mate odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) describing the 
relationship between ambient PM2.5 and the risk of MI adjusted 
for mean ambient temperature. We pooled data from all three 
cities and a cluster variance estimator was used to account for

within-city correlations. We included mean temperature as a 
linear term in all models using the same lag times as for PM2.5 
(i.e., lag-0 or 3-day mean). We also examined nonlinear forms 
(i.e., restricted cubic splines with three knots) for temperature 
but they did not improve model fit (based on Akaike infor-
mation criterion values) or meaningfully change point esti-
mates (analyses using restricted cubic splines for temperature 
are shown in eTable 2; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B172, the 
linear relationship between 3-day mean temperature and MI 
is shown in eFigure 1; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B172). We 
also considered relative humidity as a possible covariate but it 
did not change model coefficients for PM2.5 or improve model 
fit and thus we excluded it from the models we report.
The exposure periods of interest in this study included 
the same day as hospital admission for MI (lag 0) and the 
3-day mean exposure preceding hospital admissions (includ-
ing the day of admission). As the case-crossover design com-
pares cases to themselves at different points in time it adjusts 
for factors that do not vary within individuals over short time-
periods (e.g., age, smoking status, body mass index). In this 
study, matched sets consisted of the case period (the day of 
myocardial infarction) and referent periods selected on the 
same day of the week in the same month and year as the case 
period (i.e., three to four referent periods per case). This time-
stratified approach to referent selection has been shown to 
result in unbiased conditional logistic regression estimates in 
case-crossover studies.18
We first examined the relationship between PM2.5 and 
MI for the population as a whole followed by analyses strati-
fied by age (above or below the median value) and sex. As 
prospective daily levoglucosan data were only available for a 
single year, we did not have enough cases to use daily levo-
glucosan data in the main analyses. Instead, we used prospec-
tive levoglucosan data to estimate monthly mean biomass 
contributions to ambient PM2.5 (i.e., levoglucosan/PM2.5) and 
conducted stratified analyses across tertiles of this parameter. 
We evaluated potential effect modification by biomass burn-
ing as a source of ambient PM2.5 by including a first-order 
interaction term between PM2.5 and an indicator variable for 
tertiles of monthly mean biomass contributions to PM2.5. We 
did not conduct stratified analyses by heating/nonheating sea-
son as there are important sources of biomass burning during 
the summer months in these locations (e.g., forest fires, burn-
ing brush). All odds ratios are expressed per 5 µg/m3 increase 
in ambient PM2.5 concentrations as this interval was approxi-
mately equal to the interquartile range of the mean difference

in 3-day mean PM2.5 concentrations between case and control 
periods. We generated concentration–response plots using 
restricted cubic splines with three equally spaced knots. All 
statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 13 
(Statacorp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
In total, we included 2,881 cases of MI in our analyses 
including 504 cases from Courtenay, 885 cases from Kam-
loops, and 1,492 cases from Prince George. Cases were pre-
dominantly male (68%) with a median age of 65 years. On 
average, ambient PM2.5 concentrations tended to be low in 
all three cities (i.e., <10 µg/m3), with higher concentrations 
observed during colder portions of the year (Table 1). Daily 
mean ambient temperatures were weakly correlated with 
PM2.5 (r = −0.27) and levoglucosan/PM2.5 (r = −0.38). Daily 
mean PM2.5 was positively correlated with NO2 (r = 0.51) and 
inversely correlated with O3 (r = −0.49); NO2 and O3 were 
also inversely correlated (r = −0.43). The ratio of daily mean 
levoglucosan/PM2.5 was not correlated with NO2 (r = 0.05) 
but was weakly correlated with O3 (r = −0.30). Correlations 
for 3-day mean values were similar to daily mean correlations 
(data not shown).
Monthly mean levoglucosan/PM2.5 values are shown in 
Figure 1. In general, biomass burning contributions to PM2.5 
were higher during colder months in all three cities, consis-
tent with residential wood burning. Courtenay had the largest 
biomass contributions to ambient PM2.5 and seasonal differ-
ences in ambient PM2.5 concentrations were most apparent in 
this city (Table 1). Evidence of biomass burning contributions 
to PM2.5 was also apparent in Kamloops and Prince George 
during the summer months (primarily July and August) likely 
owing to forest fires.
City-specific linear regression models used for spatial 
adjustments in ambient PM2.5 and levoglucosan concentra-
tions are shown in eTable 1 (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B172). 
Overall, strong positive slopes were apparent for PM2.5 and 
levoglucosan samples collected using cascade impactors colo-
cated with provincial fixed site monitors (PM2.5 slope = 0.78, 
95% CI: 0.70, 0.86; R2 = 0.57; levoglucosan slope = 1.03, 95% 
CI: 0.92, 1.15; R2 =0.52). In general, the fixed site monitor in 
Courtenay was less representative of spatial variations across 
the region than monitors located in Prince George and Kam-
loops where R2 values generally exceeded 0.7 for both PM2.5 
and levoglucosan (eTable 1; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B172).
Odds ratios describing the relationship between ambient 
PM2.5 and hospital admissions for MI are shown in Table 2. 
Each 5 µg/m3 increase in lag-0 or 3-day mean PM2.5 concen-
tration was associated with an increased risk of MI among 
elderly subjects (≥65 years) with slightly stronger associations

observed for 3-day mean concentrations. Short-term changes 
in ambient PM2.5 were not associated with MI among younger 
subjects (interaction P value = 0.032). The concentration–
response relationship between 3-day mean PM2.5 and hos-
pital admissions for MI among elderly subjects is shown in 
Figure 2.
In general, odds ratios based on PM2.5 data corrected 
for spatial variations across each region were slightly stron-
ger than for uncorrected data (Table 2). This was particularly 
true in Courtenay where the fixed site monitor was least rep-
resentative of regional variations in PM2.5. Each 5°C increase 
in 3-day mean ambient temperature was also independently 
associated with hospital admissions for MI among elderly 
subjects (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.14); a smaller increased 
risk was observed among younger subjects (OR = 1.05, 95% 
CI: 0.98, 1,12).
Odds ratios describing the relationship between 3-day 
mean PM2.5 concentrations and hospital admissions for MI 
are shown in Table 3 across tertiles of monthly mean bio-
mass contributions to PM2.5. For the population as a whole, 
the strongest association between PM2.5 and MI was observed 
in the highest tertile of biomass contributions to PM2.5; how-
ever, the trend across tertiles was not statistically significant 
(P = 0.519). Among elderly subjects, the strongest associa-
tion between PM2.5 and MI also occurred in the highest tertile 
of biomass contributions to PM2.5 but the trend across tertiles 
was not statistically significant (P = 0.11).
As sensitivity analyses, we repeated the analysis for 
elderly subjects (≥65 years) in Table 3 excluding Courtenay 
given that this city had much higher values for the propor-
tion of levoglucosan in PM2.5 compared with Kamloops and 
Prince George. Excluding Courtenay did not change the trend 
of results across strata of biomass contributions to PM2.5 using 
the same tertile cut points as in Table 3 (high: OR = 1.12, 95% 
CI: 0.97, 1.28; mid: OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.04; low: OR = 
1.04, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.04). We also recalculated tertiles based 
on the distribution of monthly mean biomass contributions to 
PM2.5 in Prince George and Kamloops and repeated the anal-
yses among the elderly excluding Courtenay and observed 
a similar trend (high: OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.30; mid: 
OR = 1.00, 0.96, 1.04; low: OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09).
Including 3-day mean NO2 or O3 in the models did not 
dramatically change the results across tertiles of biomass 
contributions to PM2.5 in Table 3. For example, the odds ratio 
among elderly subjects in the highest tertile of biomass contri-
butions to PM2.5 increased to 1.17 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.42) when 
NO2 was included in the model and decreased to 1.12 (95% 
CI: 1.01, 1.24) when O3 was included in the model (NO2 and 
O3 were not associated with an increased risk of MI in these 
models).
When analyses were examined across temperature 
strata (above/below the median 3-day mean temperature) the 
positive association between 3-day mean PM2.5 and hospital 
admissions for MI among elderly subjects was limited to the 
cold season (Table 3). Therefore, to determine if the risk pat-
tern across tertiles of biomass contributions to PM2.5 may be 
explained by temperature, we restricted our analyses to the 
cold period (i.e., <6.44°C) and again examined trends across

tertiles of biomass contributions to PM2.5. The results of these 
analyses are shown in Table 4 and indicate increased MI risks 
with increasing biomass contributions to ambient PM2.5. For 
elderly subjects, ORs of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.36), 1.08 (95% 
CI: 1.06, 1.09), and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.06) were observed 
for the high, middle, and lower tertiles of biomass contribu-
tions to PM2.5 (interaction P value = 0.003), respectively. 
Moreover, 3-day mean PM2.5 concentrations (low: 6.29 µg/
m3; middle: 7.58 µg/m3; high: 7.77 µg/m3) and SDs of mean 
differences between case and control days (low: 4.85 µg/m3; 
middle: 4.34 µg/m3; high: 4.79 µg/m3) were similar across cat-
egories of biomass contributions to PM2.5. We also observed 
increased risks with increased biomass contributions for 
younger subjects (<65 years) and for the population as a whole 
(interaction P values < 0.001); however, inverse associations 
were observed between PM2.5 and MI in the low and middle 
tertiles for these analyses. Concentration response curves for 
3-day mean PM2.5 concentrations and emergency room visits 
for MI are shown in Figure 3 for the bottom (<25th percentile) 
and top quartiles (≥75th percentile) of biomass contributions 
to PM2.5 for elderly subjects during the cold period.
As sensitivity analyses, we re-examined the models in 
Table 4 for elderly subjects removing individual years from 
the analyses. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate if 
extreme events in a given year (e.g., large forest fires) may 
have impacted our results. These analyses are shown in eTable 
3 (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B172); removing individual 
years did not change the pattern observed in Table 4 as the 
greatest risks were repeatedly observed in the highest cate-
gory of biomass contributions to PM2.5.

Including 3-day mean ambient NO2 or O3 in conditional 
logistic regression models did not have a meaningful impact 
on the magnitude of associations across strata of biomass con-
tributions to PM2.5. For example, adding 3-day mean O3 to 
the model for elderly subjects in Table 4 increased the odds 
ratio slightly in the highest tertile of biomass contributions to 
PM2.5 (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08,1.25). A similar pattern was 
observed when 3-day mean NO2 was added to the model (OR 
= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.55). The pattern of increased risk with 
increased biomass contributions to PM2.5 also remained when 
NO2 or O3 were included in the models (Ptrend < 0.001).
Finally, in an effort to confirm the pattern of results 
observed using estimated monthly mean biomass contribu-
tions to PM2.5, we conducted stratified analyses using prospec-
tive daily levoglucosan data (with strata based on the median 
value of 3-day mean levoglucosan/PM2.5 during prospective 
monitoring). In this analysis, an odds ratio of 1.04 (95% CI: 
0.98, 1.11) was observed for the lower category of biomass 
contributions to PM2.5 whereas an odds ratio of 1.09 (95% CI: 
0.99, 1.20) was observed for the upper category. This pattern 
is consistent with that observed for monthly data with a stron-
ger association observed with higher biomass contributions 
to PM2.5; however, risk estimates were imprecise owing to the 
small number of cases (n = 700) available during prospective 
monitoring.
DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that short-term changes in ambi-
ent PM2.5 are associated with an increased risk of hospital 
admission for myocardial infarction among elderly subjects 
in areas impacted by biomass burning. Moreover, our results 
indicate that biomass burning contributions to ambient PM2.5 
may modify its association with myocardial infarction, with 
the largest risks occurring when biomass contributions are 
greatest.
Few other studies have specifically evaluated the acute 
cardiovascular health effects of exposure to PM2.5 from bio-
mass burning. Recently, two Australian studies reported 
positive associations between PM2.5 from forest fires and out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest.10,11 Moreover, consistent with our 
findings, one of these studies also reported positive associa-
tions between ambient PM2.5 and hospital admissions for MI 
and ischemic heart disease with stronger associations observed 
among older adults (≥65 years).11 Similarly, exposure to wild-
fire smoke from a peat bog fire in North Carolina was associ-
ated with increased emergency room visits for heart failure21 
and a time-series study in Seattle noted a positive association 
between potassium in PM2.5 (a marker of biomass) and cardio-
vascular mortality during the cold season.22 Likewise, studies 
in Chile23 and New Zealand24 reported positive associations 
between ambient PM10 and hospital admissions for cardiovas-
cular causes in areas impacted by biomass burning. However, 
at least one Canadian study did not observe an association 
between exposure to forest fire smoke and physician visits or 
hospital admissions for cardiovascular outcomes17 and other 
studies have reported null associations between short-term 
changes in PM2.5 and risk of myocardial infarction.25,26 Rea-
sons for these discrepancies are not clear but may relate to 
different sources of biomass (i.e., residential wood burning 
vs. forest fires) or differential impacts of exposure measure-
ment error. In general, while the current literature is somewhat 
inconsistent with respect to the cardiovascular health effects 
of PM2.5 from biomass burning, our results suggest that these 
emissions are positively associated with risk of MI among 
elderly subjects. However, our finding of increased MI risk 
with increased biomass contributions to PM2.5 requires fur-
ther replication as the underlying biological plausibility of this 
observation remains unclear.
We recently reported that glutathione-related oxida-
tive potential may modify the association between PM2.5 and 
emergency room visits for MI with stronger associations 
observed in cities with PM2.5 containing higher oxidative 
potential.27 Therefore, one explanation for the observed trend 
of increased MI risk across tertiles of biomass contributions to 
PM2.5 may be that the oxidative potential of PM2.5 is increased 
when biomass contributions are greater. Indeed, at least two 
recent studies support this hypothesis. Specifically, Bates et 
al.12 noted that biomass burning was a strong contributor to 
the oxidative potential of PM2.5 using the dithiothreitol assay 
and also reported that dithiothreitol activity was more strongly 
associated with emergency room visits for congestive heart 
failure than PM2.5. In addition, Kurmi et al.13 reported that 
wood smoke particle extracts were capable of depleting the 
antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione in a synthetic respira-
tory tract lining fluid (the same assay used above by Weichen-
thal et al.27). The specific chemical components explaining the 
increased oxidative potential of PM2.5 from biomass burning 
have yet to be thoroughly characterized; however, Kurmi et 
al.13 noted that metal chelators did not inhibit ascorbic acid 
depletion in the synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid (they 
did not examine the impact of metal chelators on glutathione 
depletion) and others have reported that semivolatile28 or polar 
organic components29 may play an important role in the oxida-
tive potential of wood smoke particles. Moreover, differences 
in particle aging and/or burning conditions may also influence 
wood smoke particle composition and toxicity.30 Unfortu-
nately, we did not collect data on the oxidative potential or 
composition of PM2.5 samples in this study and future studies 
should evaluate this question further. Indeed, our findings sug-
gest that levoglucosan is likely only a marker for the compo-
nents/characteristics of interest as the trend of increased risk 
with increased biomass contributions to PM2.5 remained when 
Courtenay (the location with the highest levoglucosan concen-
trations) was removed from the analyses.
Although this study had a number of important advan-
tages, including prospective monitoring of daily levogluco-
san concentrations and spatial studies to correct for regional 
differences in PM2.5 and levoglucosan concentrations, it is

important to note several limitations. First, daily levogluco-
san data were limited to a 1-year period and thus the main 
analyses relied on estimated monthly mean biomass contribu-
tions to PM2.5. While existing evidence suggests that the use 
of wood for heating (and the amount of wood used per house-
hold) has remained stable in British Columbia31 over the past 
decade, use of monthly estimates (as opposed to daily values) 
likely contributed to uncertainty in our effect estimates. This 
error likely contained components of both classical and Berk-
son-type measurement error. Specifically, classical measure-
ment error likely impacted our assessment of monthly mean 
levoglucosan/PM2.5 values (i.e., measured values distributed 
around the true monthly mean), whereas Berkson-type error 
likely resulted from the use of monthly mean values instead 
of daily levoglucosan data (i.e., true daily values distributed 
around monthly mean estimates). Nondifferential misclassifi-
cation of cases across tertiles of monthly mean biomass contri-
butions to PM2.5 could bias effect estimates in either direction 
depending on the pattern of misclassification across catego-
ries; however, this is not a likely explanation of the observed 
trend in MI risk across tertiles. Alternatively, we cannot rule 
out the possible influence of unmeasured confounding factors 
that may be correlated with both PM2.5 concentrations (more 
specifically the mean difference in PM2.5 concentrations 
between case and control days) and MI; however, this factor 
would also have to be correlated with the proportion of levo-
glucosan in PM2.5 to explain the trend in MI risk across tertiles 
of biomass contributions.
An additional component of exposure measurement 
error in our study relates to indoor exposure to PM2.5 from 
biomass burning owing to direct emissions into the home 
when starting the fire or when refueling. In some cases, indi-
vidual personal exposures may differ substantially from ambi-
ent PM2.5 concentrations owing to indoor exposures and this 
likely also biased effect estimates toward the null.
Finally, as a relatively small number of cases were avail-
able, within-city effect estimates were imprecise and detailed 
stratified analyses within cities were not possible. However, 
the pattern of risk estimates across cities was consistent with 
the overall results as the relationship between PM2.5 and MI

was strongest in Courtenay which also had the largest biomass 
contributions to PM2.5.
In summary, our findings suggest that short-term 
changes in ambient PM2.5 concentrations are associated with 
hospital admissions for MI among elderly subjects in areas 
impacted by biomass burning. Moreover, our results indicate 
that the magnitude of biomass contributions to PM2.5 may 
modify the association between PM2.5 and MI.
