BACKGROUND: Optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies 
on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular testing, but 
there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional 
testing.
METHODS: In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for 
Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pretest 
probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned 
to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress 
echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-
based diagnostic test reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or 
severely abnormal. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or 
unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.
RESULTS: Both the prevalence of normal test results and incidence rate of events 
in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned 
to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing 
(33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both P<0.001). In 
CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD 
(1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia 
was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar 
prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 
3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, 
or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in comparison with normal tests 
increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all P<0.001) but not for 
corresponding functional testing categories (0.94 [P=0.87], 2.65 [P=0.001], 3.88 
[P<0.001]). The discriminatory ability of CTA in predicting events was significantly 
better than functional testing (c-index, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68–0.76 versus 0.64; 
95% CI, 0.59–0.69; P=0.04). If 2714 patients with at least an intermediate 
Framingham Risk Score (>10%) who had a normal functional test were reclassified 
as being mildly abnormal, the discriminatory capacity improved to 0.69 (95% CI, 
0.64–0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Coronary CTA, by identifying patients at risk because of 
nonobstructive CAD, provides better prognostic information than functional 
testing in contemporary patients who have stable chest pain with a low burden of 
obstructive CAD, myocardial ischemia, and events.

E
valuation of chest pain is a fundamental element 
of cardiology patient care. On a daily basis, many 
physicians experience the clinical pressures to ac-
curately rule out obstructive coronary artery disease 
(CAD) or myocardial ischemia as a cause of chest 
pain, while limiting the performance of unnecessary di-
agnostic testing. This difficulty is compounded by the 
fact that presenting symptoms are often unspecific, 
and traditional risk factors, while associated with CAD 
and myocardial ischemia, do not alone permit accu-
rate diagnosis in the vast majority of patients. Hence, 
knowledge about the prognostic implications of imag-
ing-based findings is imperative to properly assess, 
prognosticate, and treat these patients. In this climate, 
functional cardiac testing (exercise electrocardiogra-
phy, stress nuclear single-photon emission computed 
tomography, stress echocardiography) has been the 
traditional way (>4 million patients each year in the 
United States) to assess stable outpatients with sus-
pected but not previously diagnosed CAD.1,2 However, 
major changes in referral patterns, improvements in 
lifestyle, and preventive medical therapy over the past 
40 years have contributed to decreasing rates of func-
tional tests positive for myocardial ischemia3 and lower 
cardiovascular event rates.4,5 With fewer patients dem-
onstrating classical findings of myocardial ischemia in-
dicating the need for interventional therapy, the latest 
American Heart Association/American College of Car-
diology guidelines recommend stress electrocardiogra-
phy or stress imaging for patients with intermediate to 
high likelihood of CAD and emphasize the importance 
of prognostic assessment by cardiovascular imaging to 
predict future cardiovascular events and to guide medi-
cal therapy.6
Observational studies and registries provide ample 
evidence that traditional assessment with functional 
testing, especially the detection of myocardial ischemia 
using echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imag-
ing, provides excellent prognostic value to predict future 
cardiovascular events. Historically, such findings were 
associated with a 5- to 10-fold increase in risk for cardio-
vascular events.5,7–18 Coronary computed tomography 
angiography (CTA) is a relatively new test that enables 
direct and noninvasive visualization of the presence and 
extent of coronary plaque and stenosis. Consistent with 
previous studies in invasive coronary angiography, a 
finding of obstructive CAD in coronary CTA is associated 
with a significant (6- to 12-fold) increase in the risk of 
future cardiovascular events, independent of traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors.19,20 In addition, the absence 
of CAD carries a nearly perfect negative predictive value 
(>99%).21–25 These data suggest that both anatomic (cor-
onary CTA) and functional assessment provide excellent 
risk prediction for cardiovascular events. However, the 
number of diagnostic tests that are positive for myocar-
dial ischemia or obstructive CAD is relatively low in con-
temporary practice (10%–15%).3 Instead, the detection 
of nonobstructive CAD defined as coronary atheroscle-
rosis causing between 1% and 69% luminal narrowing 
has emerged as a significant and frequent finding that, 
although often not associated with myocardial ischemia, 
carries a substantial risk for major adverse cardiovas-
cular events (MACE) in comparison with patients without 
any CAD.19,26
Moreover, a randomized comparison of the ability of 
anatomic and functional testing to correctly classify risk 
in symptomatic patients has not been performed. To ac-
complish this, we performed a prespecified secondary 
analysis of the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter 
Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), comparing 
the prognostic value of an anatomic versus a functional 
testing strategy in stable symptomatic patients with sus-
pected CAD.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This was a large (N>9000) randomized compari-
son of the prognostic value of anatomic imaging by 
coronary computed tomography angiography with 
functional stress testing in patients with stable chest 
pain.
• Contemporary chest pain populations referred for 
testing have a low burden of obstructive coronary 
artery disease and myocardial ischemia, and both 
findings have similar prognostic value.
• Coronary computed tomography angiography, by 
visualizing nonobstructive coronary artery disease, 
identifies additional at-risk patients and imparts bet-
ter prognostic and discriminatory information than 
functional testing.
• Consideration of the Framingham Risk Score 
as an accepted, global risk estimation signifi-
cantly improves the prognostic value of functional 
assessment.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This study provides generalizable comparative 
evidence on the relative prognostic value of the 
diagnostic tests most commonly used to evaluate 
patients with stable chest pain.
• This may improve the use of this information to 
guide management of these patients.
• Given the low prevalence of myocardial ischemia 
and obstructive coronary artery disease in con-
temporary chest pain populations, the detection of 
nonobstructive coronary artery disease identifies 
additional at-risk patients.
• A normal functional test result, including information 
on exercise and symptoms, has moderate prognos-
tic value, and consideration of the Framingham Risk 
Score improves risk stratification.

METHODS
Study Design and Population
PROMISE (URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: 
NCT01174550) is a pragmatic comparative effectiveness 
trial that enrolled 10 003 patients at 193 sites in North 
America which had expertise in the fields of cardiology, 
primary care, radiology, and anesthesia and represented 
both community practices and academic medical centers. 
Details regarding the PROMISE study population, selection 
criteria, design, and primary results have been described 
elsewhere.27,28 In brief, the study participants were stable 
symptomatic outpatients without known CAD who were 
referred to noninvasive cardiovascular testing for further 
evaluation. Local or central institutional review boards 
approved the study at the coordinating centers and each of 
the 193 enrolling sites in North America.
For this analysis, we included patients who received the 
initial diagnostic test as randomly assigned. We excluded 
subjects who received other tests as their first test, did not 
undergo any diagnostic test, or received noncontrast CTA 
only. In addition, we excluded patients whose test results 
could not be assigned to prespecified test strata because of 
indeterminate test results, including patients who underwent 
functional testing with exercise but achieved <75% of maxi-
mum predicted heart rate. The flow of patients is described 
in Figure 1.
Study Procedures 
After providing written informed consent, participants were 
randomly assigned to either the CTA group or the functional 
testing group, with stratification according to study site and 
according to the choice, as indicated before randomization by 
the site clinician, of the intended functional test if the patient 
were to be assigned to that study group.28 Enrollment began 
July 27, 2010, and was completed on September 19, 2013. 
Tests were performed and interpreted by local physicians who 
made all subsequent clinical decisions. Appropriate medical 
therapy was encouraged, and guideline-based educational 
materials were provided to patients and providers. Follow-up 
visits were performed at 60 days at the study sites and cen-
trally by means of telephone or mail at 6-month intervals after 
randomization, for a minimum of 1 year until October 31, 
2014. Diagnostic testing was performed in compliance with 
professional society guidelines. Functional testing included 
exercise electrocardiography, exercise or pharmacological 
nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, and exercise or phar-
macological stress echocardiography. Coronary CTA was 
performed with at least 64-slice multidetector computed tomo-
graphic technology.
Diagnostic Test Results 
Site-reported test results were prospectively classified as 
normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. Broadly, 
for coronary CTA, we defined nonobstructive CAD (stenosis 
of 1%–69% for primary and 1%–49% for secondary analysis) 
as mildly abnormal, single-vessel obstructive CAD as moder-
ately abnormal (stenosis of >70% for primary and >50% for 
secondary analysis), and multivessel or proximal left ante-
rior descending (>70%) or left main obstructive CAD >50% 
as severely abnormal. For functional testing, late positive 
treadmill or abnormal electrocardiography in the absence of 
reversible ischemia was defined as mildly abnormal, inducible 
ischemia, or mixed defect with perfusion or wall motion in one 
coronary territory for myocardial perfusion imaging and stress 
echocardiography, respectively, or early positive treadmill was 
defined as moderately abnormal, and multivessel, large terri-
tory inducible ischemia or mixed defect was defined as severe. 
A more detailed description of the classification of test results 
can be found in Table 1.

Cardiovascular Risk Factors 
Patient demographics and traditional cardiovascular risk fac-
tors were assessed and documented in a standard fashion at 
the time of enrollment into the PROMISE trial.27
Study End Points 
The primary end point was a composite of time to MACE 
including death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or hos-
pitalization for unstable angina. The secondary end point was 
defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina, and the ter-
tiary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death or 
myocardial infarction. An independent clinical events commit-
tee adjudicated all primary and secondary end point events 
in a blinded fashion on the basis of standard, prospectively 
determined definitions.27,28

percentages of patients for categorical variables. The Cox pro-
portional hazards regression model was used to assess the 
relationship of test results to the time to the first clinical event 
(or censoring) for each composite end point.29 To appropri-
ately account for heterogeneity among the subjects, analyses 
were adjusted for a prespecified set of baseline covariates, 
including age, sex, CAD risk equivalent (history of either dia-
betes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, or cerebrovascular 
disease), and the prespecification of the intended functional 
test (if randomly assigned to the functional testing arm). For 
each testing strategy, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using Cox models to 
characterize the relative risks of patients with normal versus 
mildly, moderately, and severely abnormal test results.29 For 
secondary analyses, we reclassified patients with at least an 
intermediate Framingham Risk Score (>10%) who had a nor-
mal functional test as mildly abnormal. In addition, we com-
pared the predictive value of the absence (normal and mildly 
abnormal) and presence (moderately and severely abnormal) 
of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia. Cumulative event 
rates based on test results were computed for each testing 
strategy (CTA and functional testing) using the method of 
Kaplan and Meier.30 On the basis of the test results, the abil-
ity of each testing strategy to discriminate between patients 
who subsequently experienced an event versus those who did 
not was assessed by using the C statistic.31 The C statistic 
was calculated based on the predicted probability of 26-month 
risk from the Cox regression model. Data from each testing 
strategy were analyzed separately using the Cox model. A 
C-statistic comparison between the 2 testing strategies (ana-
tomic versus functional) was based on z statistics. Analyses 
were performed for the primary end point and for the second-
ary and tertiary end points. All P values are 2-sided, and were 
considered significant if <0.05. All analyses were performed 
using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
Study Population
Overall, 91% of all patients enrolled in the PROMISE 
trial were eligible for this analysis (n=9102/10 
003). 
Major reasons for exclusion were receiving no test or 
a test other than the randomized test (Figure 1). The 
demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cardio-
vascular event rates were similar between patients in-
cluded in this analysis and those excluded (online-only 
Data Supplement Table I). Of the patients included, 4500 
were randomly assigned to and received coronary CTA, 
and 4602 were randomly assigned to functional testing. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in base-
line patient demographics, cardiovascular risk, medica-
tion, or clinical presentation between coronary CTA and 
functional testing (Table 2). Overall, patients were on 
average 61 years of age, 53% were women, 78% were 
white, >90% had an intermediate or high Framingham 
Risk Score, about half were on at least 1 preventive 
medication, and the majority had atypical chest pain at 
presentation.

Outcomes
During the median follow-up of 26.1 months (interquar-
tile range: 18.0–34.4), event rates were similar in the 
anatomic and functional arms: overall, 137 (3.1%) ver-
sus 132 (3.0%); death, 62 (1.4%) versus 66 (1.4%); 
myocardial infarction, 26 (0.6%) versus 31 (0.7%); and 
unstable angina, 52 (1.2%) versus 41 (0.9%).
Test Results
The distribution of test results was significantly differ-
ent between coronary CTA and functional testing. There 
were twice as many patients who had completely normal 
functional testing in comparison with a normal coronary 
CTA (78.0% versus 33.4%; P<0.001).
HRs for events increased proportionally for mildly, 
moderately, and severely abnormal CTA results in com-
parison with normal CTA tests (HRs, 2.94, 7.67, 10.13; 
all P<0.001) (Table 3). In contrast, the increase in risk for 
functional testing is only significant in moderately and se-
verely abnormal categories (HRs, 2.65 [P=0.001], 3.88 
[P<0.001]), with no difference in risk between normal 
and mildly abnormal test results (HR, 0.94 [P=0.87]). 
The discriminatory ability of CTA in predicting events was 
significantly better than functional testing (c-index, 0.72; 
95% CI, 0.68–0.76 versus 0.64; 95% CI, 0.59–0.69; 
P=0.04) (Figure 2). The results were similar for second-
ary analyses in which nonobstructive CAD was defined 
as 1% to 49% (online-only Data Supplement Table II; c-in-
dex, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69–0.78; P=0.01). The better dis-
crimination of events by coronary CTA was the result of 
the ability to define a very low risk group using a normal 
CTA which nearly excluded events (14 of 137 events; 
10.2% of all events), corresponding to an incidence 
rate of 0.93% over 2 years. In contrast, the majority of 
events in the functional arm (75 of 132 events; 56.8% of 
all events), corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.09%, 
occurred in those with completely normal functional 
tests (including no reversible or irreversible ischemia, 
normal electrocardiography, normal duration of exercise 
without symptoms). A second reason was that detection 
of nonobstructive CAD by coronary CTA identified an at-
risk group of patients (62.1% of CTAs; n=2461/3966), 
in which the majority of events in the CTA arm occurred 
(54%, n=74/137; 3.0% event rate). If nonobstructive 
CAD was defined as 1% to 49% luminal stenosis, a still 
significant 33.6% of the events (n=46/137) occurred 
in this group (online-only Data Supplement Table II). In 
contrast, very few patients had mildly abnormal tests in 
the functional arm (9.4%, n=432/4602). Similar results 
were seen for the secondary end points of cardiovas-
cular death/myocardial infarction/unstable angina and 
tertiary end points of cardiovascular death and myocar-
dial infarction (Table 2 and online-only Data Supplement 
Table II).
Important from a clinical management standpoint, 
when we compared anatomic versus functional binary 
test results (absence or presence of ≥50% left main or 
≥70% stenosis elsewhere versus presence or absence 
of reversible myocardial ischemia in any segment), we 
found that both the prevalence (obstructive CAD: 11.9% 
[n=534/4500] versus myocardial ischemia: 12.6% 
[n=582/4602]; P=0.257) and the event rates (9.2% ver-
sus 8.2%, respectively; P=0.58) were similar. Thus, ob-
structive CAD and reversible myocardial ischemia were 
each associated with a similarly significantly increased 
relative risk for cardiovascular events for the primary 
end point (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 2.60–5.39 versus HR, 
3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99; P<0.0001 for both) (Table 
4), and with a similar discriminatory ability in predicting 
the primary end point, as well (c-index, 0.65; 95% CI, 
0.60–0.69 versus 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60–0.69, respec-
tively; P=0.946; online-only Data Supplement Figure I).

The data demonstrate that only 10.1% of patients under-
went exercise treadmill testing, whereas the vast major-
ity (67.8%) underwent nuclear perfusion stress testing. 
The observed event rate was much lower in the patients 
undergoing exercise treadmill testing (n=6/467; 1.3%) 
in comparison with those undergoing either stress echo-
cardiography (n=20/1019; 2%) or stress nuclear testing 
(n=106/3116; 3.4%), most likely reflecting the fact that 
physicians very appropriately referred patients at lowest 
risk to exercise treadmill testing and those at highest to 
stress nuclear testing. Last, only a minority of events oc-
curred in those with normal or mildly abnormal exercise 
treadmill testing (n=4, 3, and 2 for the primary, second-
ary, and tertiary end points, respectively).
Stress Nuclear Perfusion Testing Versus 
Coronary CTA 
Although we used an aggregate of the functional tests 
as the primary approach to compare the prognostic 
value of an anatomic versus a functional strategy, online-
only Data Supplement Table IV provides a comparison 
of nuclear stress testing with coronary CTA based on 
the prerandomization intended functional test. In that 
analysis, only patients whose prerandomization intended 
functional test was nuclear were included in the analy-
sis in both arms. In brief, the data demonstrate that the 
HRs for coronary CTA are higher than for functional test-
ing across test result categories and end points, with 
differences being higher in comparison with the overall 
cohort.
Functional Testing Plus Risk Factors
Given the large number of normal functional tests and 
the importance of pretest probability in interpreting test 
results, we performed a secondary analysis in which 
we reclassified patients with at least an intermediate 
Framingham Risk Score (>10%) who had a normal 
functional test as being mildly abnormal. As a result, 
2714 patients were reclassified from normal to a mildly 
abnormal functional test, whereas only 874 patients

remained in the normal category. This reclassification 
resulted in stronger association of functional test strata 
with clinical outcomes in comparison with test results 
only, although there was still no significant difference in 
event rates between normal and mildly abnormal test 
results with the new classification for functional imag-
ing (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.75–3.45; P=0.22) (online-only 
Data Supplement Table V and Table 5). The discrimina-
tory value of functional testing strata improved from a 
c-index of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.59–0.69) using test data 
only to a c-index of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64–0.74) using 
the Framingham Risk Score for reclassification. The in-
clusion of Framingham Risk Score to stratify functional 
testing results rendered no significant difference in dis-
criminatory capacity between anatomic and functional 
testing (c-index for CTA, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68–0.76; ver-
sus c-index for functional testing including the Framing-
ham Risk Score, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.64–0.74; P=0.29) 
(Figure 2C).
DISCUSSION
Overall, our study provides comparative evidence on 
the prognostic value of findings of the most commonly 
performed diagnostic tests, including presence and 
extent of myocardial ischemia and CAD and the asso-

ciated absolute and relative risks for future cardiovas-
cular events in a contemporary patient stable chest 
pain population at intermediate risk for CAD using the 
PROMISE randomized trial data from 193 North Ameri-
can sites. Our results may contribute to a better un-
derstanding of how to use information from these tests 
to guide management of this large group of patients. 
We found that anatomic assessment with coronary CTA 
provided significantly better prognostic information than 
functional testing (c-index: 0.72 versus 0.64; P=0.04), 
which was a result of the detection of an at-risk group 
of patients with nonobstructive CAD by coronary CTA 
and the indiscriminatory nature of a normal functional 
test. Adding the Framingham Risk Score to functional 
test results significantly improved the prognostic value 
of functional testing.
The strengths of this study include the following: (1) 
this is the first large (N>9000) prospective randomized 
comparison of the prognostic value of anatomic imaging 
by coronary CTA with functional exercise- or stress-based 
testing results in patients with stable chest pain; (2) this 
uniquely allows for a direct comparison of test findings 
of anatomic and functional testing, and the understand-
ing of which particular diagnostic findings are differential 
between the strategies in their ability to identify patients 
at risk for MACE; and (3) the multicenter nature of this 
study recruiting patients at 193 North American sites 
provides generalizable data from a contemporary stable 
chest pain population. One of the insights from the data 
is the low prevalence of obstructive CAD (11.9%) and 
myocardial ischemia (12.6%), which only 2 decades 
ago was between 30% and 40% in patients undergoing 
nuclear stress perfusion imaging.3 A related important 
observation is that the majority of clinical events over 
a 2-year follow-up occurred in patients without obstruc-
tive CAD or myocardial ischemia, indicating a significant 
risk burden undetected by conventional measures of test 
positivity. For coronary CTA, our data demonstrate that a 
finding of nonobstructive CAD identifies a large additional 
group of at-risk patients, in which the majority of events 
occurred (n=74/137, 54.0%) with similar observations 
made in smaller studies from Japan.16,19,32–35 In contrast, 
parameters from the exercise portion of functional tests 
(symptoms and duration of exercise, and electrocardi-
ography changes, as well) and imaging findings, such as 
fixed defects without ischemia, did not identify patients 
at risk for events. Mechanistically, these data corrobo-
rate many years of research in interventional cardiology, 
suggesting that at least one-third, in the context of ag-
gressive medical therapy, or up to two-thirds of future 
cardiovascular events occur at locations in the coronary 
artery tree where previously no obstructive CAD was 
present.34–36 Thus, in an era of imaging patients with a 
relatively low burden of demonstrable myocardial isch-
emia or obstructive CAD, the relative importance of 
detecting subclinical atherosclerotic disease becomes 
substantially greater and is an important consideration 
for test choice.37
Our results further emphasize the importance of car-
diovascular risk profile in contemporary populations with 
stable chest pain, especially in those patients with com-
pletely normal functional testing. We demonstrate that 
addition of the Framingham Risk Score, as an accepted 
global risk estimation tool, improved the discriminatory 
capacity of functional assessment (c-index, 0.64–0.69), 
which rendered the comparison with anatomic testing 
nonsignificant (P=0.29).
Another important implication of our study is that 
a normal CTA, in contrast to a completely normal 
functional test, is highly unlikely to be associated with 
MACE for at least 2 years. Because similar findings 
have been reported in the acute chest pain setting,38

this determination of a warranty period is an impor-
tant additional benefit of coronary CTA for patients 
and providers.
Our results confirm evidence from observational stud-
ies that both findings of obstructive CAD and reversible 
myocardial ischemia are associated with significantly in-
creased relative risk for future MACE,14,16–18,32,33 but we 
extend these studies by demonstrating that the prog-
nostic power of both findings is essentially equivalent 
in identifying patients with a substrate that can explain 
symptoms (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 2.60–5.39 versus HR, 
3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). The primary results of the 
PROMISE trial demonstrated that the aggregate of ac-
tions taken by physicians and patients based on a strat-
egy of either initial anatomic or functional testing did not 
yield a difference in clinical outcomes.28 In contrast, this 
prespecified secondary analysis is the first to report on 
the ability of diagnostic test results to accurately dis-
tinguish patients who subsequently experience a clinical 
event from patients who do not. Although this is presum-
ably related to events, it represents a different, relevant 
clinical question.
Our study has limitations. Although the PROMISE trial 
was designed to compare 2 fundamentally different ap-
proaches to the management of patients with stable 
chest pain, anatomic versus functional testing, we ac-
knowledge that the sensitivities, specificities, predictive 
values, and prognostic values can vary between different 
functional testing modalities and by age, sex, and other 
patient characteristics (eg, body mass index). We fur-
ther acknowledge that the choice of functional test was 
dictated by physician preferences and patient presenta-
tion, and thus will vary by individual clinician choices. 
However, because physicians in the PROMISE trial had 
to prespecify before randomization their preference for 
which functional test the patient should undergo if he 
or she were randomly assigned to the functional arm, 
we were able to perform a matched comparison of CTA 
with nuclear testing, which demonstrated results similar 
to results seen for the entire population. Unfortunately,

the much smaller numbers of patients receiving treadmill 
exercise or stress echocardiography precluded a valid 
subanalysis for these 2 modalities.
It is further important to note that treatments based 
on imaging results were not accounted for in our analy-
sis, but may have affected the cardiovascular outcomes 
assessed. However, one could argue that, based on the 
intention of the trial as a strategy comparison, it may be 
desirable to include the effects of medical treatments or 
interventions and their effect on prognosis as a result 
of the study. Indeed, in keeping with the results of this 
analysis, it has been shown that the prognostic impor-
tance of coronary anatomic information is maintained 
and that of functional testing is lost or markedly attenu-
ated when aggressive medical therapy and either elective 
or as-needed revascularization is pursued.39
Our study had a relatively small number of events and 
a short median follow-up of 26 months. In addition, we 
stratified test results for functional testing and coronary 
CTA based on site reads collected on case report forms 
to identify abnormal and normal tests. Further, the study 
excluded patients with abnormal left ventricular function 
or a history of myocardial infarction, and hence the prog-
nostic value of diagnostic hallmarks of functional testing 
such as left ventricular function or fixed perfusion de-
fects could not be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS
Contemporary stable chest pain populations present 
with a low prevalence of myocardial ischemia and ob-
structive CAD. In this population, the detection of non-
obstructive CAD identifies additional at-risk patients, 
whereas consideration of the Framingham Risk Score is 
important for proper risk stratification of patients with 
normal stress testing. These results may contribute to 
a better understanding of how to use this information to 
guide management of these patients.
