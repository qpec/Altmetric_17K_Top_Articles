Background: Experiencing victimization in early life has 
been repeatedly shown to be associated with the emergence 
of psychotic symptoms in childhood. However, most vic-
timized children do not develop psychotic symptoms and 
why this occurs is not fully understood. This study inves-
tigated which individual, family-level, and wider commu-
nity characteristics were associated with an absence of 
psychotic symptoms among children at risk for psychosis 
by virtue of their exposure to multiple victimization expe-
riences (poly-victimization).  Methods: Participants were 
from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, a 
nationally representative cohort of 2232 UK-born twins. 
Exposure to maltreatment, bullying and domestic violence 
prior to age 12 was determined from interviews with moth-
ers, children, and observations by research workers at ages 
5, 7, 10, and 12. Children were interviewed about psychotic 
symptoms at age 12. Protective factors were measured at 
ages 5, 7, 10, and 12.  Results: Childhood poly-victim-
ization was associated with age-12 psychotic symptoms 
(OR = 4.61, 95% CI 2.82–7.52), but the majority of poly-
victimized children did not report symptoms (80.7%). 
Having a relatively high IQ, more positive atmosphere at 
home, and higher levels of neighborhood social cohesion 
were found to be protective against childhood psychotic 
symptoms among poly-victimized children and also in the 
whole sample. However, “protected” poly-victimized chil-
dren displayed elevated levels of other mental health prob-
lems compared to nonvictimized children.  Conclusions: 
Children’s characteristics, family context, and the wider 
community were all found to protect children from devel-
oping early psychotic symptoms, even when they were vic-
timized multiple times. These findings indicate targets for 
multilevel preventive interventions.

Introduction
Recent literature has highlighted the presence of psychotic 
symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, in non-
clinical populations,1,2 with around 1 in 20 children from 
the general population reporting them at 12 years of age.3 
Such early experiences of psychotic symptoms have been 
shown to not only be distressing for children4 but also to 
increase the risk for engaging in suicidal behaviors,5 and 
for the development of schizophrenia and other psychiat-
ric disorders in adulthood.6,7 It is, therefore, important to 
identity factors that confer protection against the mani-
festation of psychotic symptoms in childhood.
The vast majority of research to date has focused upon 
those who develop psychotic symptoms, in order to inves-
tigate associated risk factors. Adverse childhood experi-
ences, such as physical or sexual abuse, neglect, bullying 
by peers, and witnessing domestic violence, appear to be 
a significant risk factor for the development of psychotic 
symptoms in childhood.8–10 For instance, our group pre-
viously reported on the association between different 
individual types of victimization, including maltreat-
ment by an adult and bullying by peers, and the presence 
of psychotic symptoms in children aged 12.8 Exposure 
to more than one type of adversity in childhood (poly-
victimization) has been associated with an even greater 
risk of developing psychotic symptoms.8,11 While poly-
victimization has been implicated as a major risk factor, 
current research in this area does not address the fact that 
the majority of victimized children will not develop psy-
chotic symptoms.8 Furthermore, it does not consider that 
“protective” factors could have a buffering role. Research 
on those who do not develop psychotic symptoms would 
provide valuable insights that could be harnessed to 
inform both the development and implementation of 
preventive interventions, particularly among chidren at 
risk for psychosis by virtue of their exposure to multiple

victimization experiences (poly-victimized).12 Therefore, 
this article aims to identify individual-, family-, and com-
munity-level protective factors that are associated with 
a reduced likelihood of psychotic symptoms developing 
during childhood among poly-victimized children.
Given the lack of research exploring protective factors 
for psychotic symptoms, here we draw partly on the risk 
literature to hypothesize about factors whose absence or 
inverse may serve to be protective. In terms of individual-
level protective factors, cognitive functioning and person-
ality characteristics are potential candidates. It has been 
well-documented that children in the general population 
who report psychotic symptoms have a lower IQ3,13 and 
also that IQ declines in childhood have been associated 
with psychotic symptoms in adulthood.14 These findings 
suggest that lower IQ may be an expression of a general 
neurodevelopmental impairment on the pathway to psy-
chosis.15 Hence, relatively high IQ levels may be protective 
against the development of psychotic symptoms. We have 
also previously found that poor executive functioning is 
associated with an increased risk of psychotic symptoms 
in children,3 and thus, average or higher levels of this type 
of cognitive functioning might be protective.
Personality characteristics, such as being shy and fear-
ful (high harm avoidance), low cooperativeness, and a 
lack of ability to adapt to situations (low self-directed-
ness), have been shown to be associated with psychotic 
experiences through to clinical disorder.16–19 It is, there-
fore, possible that the opposite personality traits, for 
example being talkative, engaging in social situations, 
and having natural confidence in novel situations, may be 
protective against the development of psychotic phenom-
ena. Indeed, healthy adults were found to have higher 
persistence (eagerness and ambition) and cooperative-
ness (social acceptance and empathy) than patients with 
schizophrenia.18 These traits may help individuals to over-
come adverse experiences, by resisting tendencies toward 
social withdrawal and increasing the likelihood of seeking 
help from others, thus protecting them from developing 
severe mental health problems. Although these findings 
were not replicated in a childhood sample.19 Additionally, 
social behaviors in childhood such as solitary play and 
social anxiety20,21 have been established as risk factors 
among those with a later diagnosis of schizophrenia in 
adulthood. It is, therefore, plausible that children who 
show a natural affinity for social interaction and pro-
social behaviors may be less likely to develop psychotic 
symptoms as this may enable them to make stable friend-
ships and develop their own supportive social networks.
Potential protective factors may also be present within 
the home environment in which children are brought up. 
A previous study conducted by our group reported that 
maternal warmth, sibling warmth, and a positive atmo-
sphere at home were protective against internalizing and 
externalizing problems among children who had been 
bullied.22 It is possible that good relationships with family 
members and growing up in a nurturing and predictable 
environment may also be protective against psychotic 
symptoms among victimized children.
Community factors, outside of the home environment, 
such as low neighborhood social cohesion23 have previ-
ously been associated with psychotic symptoms emerging 
in both clinical and non-clinical populations, particularly 
in the context of victimization exposure.24 Therefore, liv-
ing in an area where neighbors trust and get along with 
each other might be protective against psychotic symp-
toms emerging, particularly among victimized children 
perhaps because it increases the likelihood of others 
intervening if they witness maltreatment or provides 
more opportunities for victimized children to obtain help.
Reduced levels of social support25 have also previously 
been associated with the development of early psychotic 
symptoms, while having more close relationships has 
been suggested to protect against psychosis in adult-
hood.26 Therefore, having someone to turn for support 
following victimization could also be protective against 
the emergence of childhood psychotic symptoms.
This article utilizes prospectively collected data from 
a large, nationally representative cohort of UK children 
to explore whether individual (IQ, executive functioning, 
prosocial behavior, and temperament), family (atmo-
sphere at home, maternal warmth, and sibling warmth), 
community (social cohesion), or cross-level (supportive 
adults) factors are associated with a reduced likelihood 
of developing psychotic symptoms among poly-victim-
ized children. Given that poly-victimization has been 
associated with a range of mental health problems,27 
we also investigated whether protected children (those 
exposed to poly-victimization but without childhood psy-
chotic symptoms) were resilient to other mental health 
problems.
Methods
Study Cohort
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk 
(E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the 
development of a nationally representative birth cohort 
of 2232 British twin children born in England and Wales 
in 1994–1995. Full details about the sample are reported 
elsewhere28 and in the Supplementary Material. Briefly, 
the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999–2000, when 
1116 families with same-sex 5-year-old twins (93% of 
those eligible) participated in home-visit assessments. 
Families were recruited to represent the UK population 
of families with newborns in the 1990s, based on residen-
tial location throughout England and Wales and moth-
ers’ age. Teenaged mothers with twins were over-selected 
to replace high-risk families who were selectively lost to 
the register through nonresponse. Older mothers having 
twins via assisted reproduction were underselected to 
avoid an excess of well-educated older mothers. E-Risk

Protective Factors for Child Psychotic Symptoms
families are representative of UK households across the 
spectrum of neighborhood-level deprivation (see online 
Supplementary Material). The sample comprised 56% 
monozygotic and 44% dizygotic twin pairs, and sex was 
evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male). Follow-up 
home-visits were conducted when children were aged 7, 
10, and 12 (participation rates were 98%, 96%, and 96%, 
respectively). The Joint South London and Maudsley and 
the Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee 
approved each phase of the study. Parents gave informed 
consent and children gave assent.
Measures
Childhood Psychotic Symptoms.  E-Risk families were 
visited by mental health trainees or professionals when 
children were aged 12.3 Each child was privately inter-
viewed about seven psychotic symptoms pertaining to 
delusions and hallucinations. Items and interviewer notes 
were assessed by a psychiatrist expert in schizophre-
nia, a psychologist expert in interviewing children, and 
a child and adolescent psychiatrist to verify the valid-
ity of the symptoms. This interview and coding pro-
cedure has been described in detail previously3 and in 
Supplementary Material. At age 12, the majority of chil-
dren in the sample had complete data on psychotic symp-
toms (N = 2127/2146, 99.1%). A total of 5.9% of children 
reported experiencing at least one definite psychotic 
symptom (N = 125). This is similar to the prevalence of 
psychotic symptoms in other community samples of chil-
dren and adolescents.2,15,29,30
Other Mental Health Problems. At age 12, children 
completed the 10-item version of the Multidimensional 
Anxiety Scale for Children.31 Those who scored at or 
above the 95th centile (raw score of 13 or more) consti-
tuted the “extreme” anxiety group. We used scores of 20 
or more on the Children’s Depression Inventory32 com-
pleted by children at age 12, to indicate clinically-signif-
icant depressive symptoms.33 We derived diagnoses of 
conduct disorder at age 12 on the basis of mothers’ and 
teachers’ reports of children’s behavior problems using 
the Achenbach family of instruments and additional 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fourth Edition, items assessing conduct disorder which 
have previously been described.34
Childhood Poly-victimization.  Exposure to several 
types of victimization was assessed repeatedly when the 
children were 5, 7, 10, and 12 years of age and dossiers 
have been compiled for each child with cumulative infor-
mation about exposure to domestic violence between the 
mother and her partner, frequent bullying by peers, phys-
ical maltreatment by an adult, sexual abuse, emotional 
abuse and neglect, and physical neglect. Each form of 
victimization was rated by coders as “0” not present; “1” 
probable harm, occasionally present, or evidence of only 
minor incidents; or “2” definite harm, frequently pres-
ent, or evidence of severe incidents. Poly-victimization 
was defined as experiencing two or more types of victim-
ization that were coded as “2” before age 12 (N = 140, 
6.6%) compared to only one type or none (N = 1986, 
93.4%). We utilized a conservative cut-off of “2” in order 
to increase the likelihood that we were capturing “true” 
incidences of victimization (rather than occasional teas-
ing or minor forms of punishment such as being smacked 
on the bottom), because more severe incidences of vic-
timization have been suggested to be more likely to be 
recalled accurately.35 Moreover, severe victimization 
has been associated with the highest risk of later men-
tal health problems.36 Details about these measurements 
have been reported previously37,38 and are provided in 
Supplementary Material.
Individual-Level Protective Factors.  The Wechsler 
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Revised 
(WPPSI)39 was used to assess IQ at age 5. Children 
were administered two subtests (Vocabulary and Block 
Design), and IQ scores were prorated following proce-
dures described previously40 and then standardized with 
a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.
Executive function was measured at age 5 as the mean 
score of three separate tasks: Mazes,41 a WPPSI subtest; 
Day-Night,42 a nonverbal analog of the Stroop task; and 
Sentence Working Memory, based on the Baddeley model 
of working memory;43,44 after converting each scale to a 
common metric. The resulting combined score was stan-
dardized with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.
After the age-5 home visits, research workers rated 
each twin on 25 different behavioral characteristics that 
assessed children’s style of approach and response to 
the testing session. The behavioral characteristics were 
derived from scales initially used to rate children enrolled 
in the American Collaborative Study on Cerebral Palsy, 
Mental Retardation, and Other Neurological Disorders 
of Infancy and Childhood45 and were modified for use in 
the Dunedin Health and Development Study.46,47 The cur-
rent study used the measure for “Approach” as it captures 
contrasting traits to those associated with the broader 
psychosis phenotype.19 This temperament measure was 
made up of six items including quick adjustment, friend-
liness, self-confidence, talkativeness, easy separation, and 
smiling and laughter (internal consistency: α = 0.90).
Prosocial behavior was derived using 10 items from the 
Revised Rutter Parent Scale for School-Age Children48 to 
extract a prosocial score where the items were summed49 
for children at age 5 (internal consistency: α = 0.77). 
Items included “considerate of other people’s feelings,” 
“kind to younger children,” and “shares out treats with 
friends.” Questionnaires were completed by both moth-
ers and teachers; the total scores were combined and then 
averaged to provide a single score.

Family-Level Protective Factors.  Maternal warmth was 
assessed using procedures adapted from the Five-Minute 
Speech Sample method.50 Mothers were asked to speak 
for 5 min about each of their children when they were aged 
5 and again at age 10. Warmth was coded on a six-point 
scale from no warmth (complete absence of warmth) to 
high warmth (definite warmth, enthusiasm, interest in, 
and enjoyment of the child). Two trained raters, blind to 
all other E-Risk Study data, coded the tapes of the moth-
ers’ speech sample (inter-rater agreement: r = 0.90). The 
maternal warmth scores at ages 5 and 10 were combined, 
as they were significantly correlated (r = 0.37, P < .001), 
and then averaged to provide a single score.
Mothers were asked a series of questions about the qual-
ity of their children’s relationship with one another when 
the children were aged 7 and 10.51 Mothers responded on 
a three-point scale to six questions (eg, “do your twins 
love each other,” “do both your twins do nice things for 
each other”). The internal consistency reliability score at 
age 7 was 0.77 and at age 10 was 0.80. The sibling warmth 
scores at ages 7 and 10 were combined, because they were 
significantly correlated (r = 0.57, P < .001), and then 
averaged to provide a single score.
The creation of the atmosphere at home measure has 
been previously documented.52 It was derived from the 
Coder’s Impression Inventory, which is based on the Home 
Observation for Measurement of the Environment53 
and the University of Washington Parenting Clinic 
Questionnaire 
(Parent–Child 
Observations).54 
The 
Coder’s Impression Inventory was rated immediately fol-
lowing the study visit at ages 7 and 10 by interviewers 
who had undergone 4-day training. This measure com-
prised items representing the state of the home (eg, “Are 
visible rooms of the house clean?”), stimulation (eg, “Is 
the children’s art displayed in the home?”), happiness (eg, 
“Is this a happy home?”) and chaos (eg, “Is the house 
chaotic or overly noisy?”). The internal consistency at age 
7 was α = 0.77 and α = 0.79 at age 10. The average of 
the overall atmosphere at home scores at ages 7 and 10 
was used for analysis because they were significantly cor-
related (r = 0.64, P < .001). The four subscales were also 
examined separately using an average of the scores at 7 
and 10.
Community-Level Protective Factors.  We assessed 
social cohesion55 when children were aged 5 by asking 
mothers five questions, including whether their neighbor-
hood was closeknit, whether neighbors shared values, 
and whether neighbors trusted and got along with each 
other. We derived a total score by summing the answers 
to all five questions (internal consistency: α = 0.83), with 
higher scores indicative of greater social cohesion.
Cross-Level Protective Factors. The presence of a sup-
portive adult was assessed at age 12 when children were 
asked questions about whether they had a stable adult 
figure to rely on for basic needs and support (eg, “there is 
an adult who I can tell almost anything to,” “there is an 
adult who I can go to if I am in trouble”). Participants 
answered not true (0), sometimes true (1), or true (2). We 
derived a total score by summing responses to 13 items 
(internal consistency: α = 0.85). The questions did not 
ask the child to specify who the adult was, and thus, 
this could have been someone within or outside of their 
family.
Family-Level Confounders.  Family socioeconomic 
status (SES) was measured via a composite of parental 
income (total household), education (highest for mother/
father), and occupation (highest for mother/father) when 
children were aged 556 and was categorized into tertiles 
(ie, low-, medium-, and high-SES). Family psychiatric 
history was assessed when children were aged 12. In pri-
vate interviews, mothers reported on family history of 
DSM disorders,57 which was converted to a proportion 
(0–1.0) of family members with a history of psychiatric 
disorder.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted in STATA 11.2 (Stata-Corp, 
College Station, TX). Because each study family contains 
two children, all statistical analyses were corrected con-
servatively for the nonindependence of twin observations 
by using tests based on the Huber/White variance estima-
tor.58 Application of this technique allows for the relax-
ation of the assumption of independence of observations 
by penalizing estimated standard errors and therefore 
accounting for the dependence in the data due to analyz-
ing sets of twins. We used binary logistic regression to test 
the associations between (i) childhood poly-victimization 
and age-12 psychotic symptoms in the whole sample; and 
(ii) individual-, family-, and community-level protective 
factors and age-12 psychotic symptoms in the poly-vic-
timized group. We also tested for interactions between 
significant protective factors and poly-victimization in 
the whole sample using logistic regression to examine 
whether these factors were specifically protective in rela-
tion to poly-victimization exposure. All of these analyses 
were adjusted for gender, family SES and family psy-
chiatric history. Additionally, we examined whether the 
poly-victimized children who did not develop psychotic 
symptoms were more likely to have anxiety, depression, 
or conduct disorder at age 12, using binary logistic regres-
sion and controlling for gender and family SES.

of victimization than in those who were not poly-vic-
timized (19.3% vs 4.9%, respectively; OR = 4.61, 95% 
CI 2.82–7.52, P < .001). This association remained after 
controlling for family SES (OR = 4.22, 95% CI 2.50–7.10, 
P < .001) and family history of mental health problems 
(OR = 3.72, 95% CI 2.20–6.29, P < .001) and did not 
significantly differ for boys and girls (interaction: OR = 
1.72, 95% CI 0.63–4.67, P = 0.286), and therefore, all fur-
ther results will be presented for both sexes together.
Among poly-victimized children (N = 140), those who 
did and did not develop psychotic symptoms were compa-
rable in terms of the total number of victimization expe-
riences they encountered (χ2(3) = 5.807, P = .121). The 
two groups were also statistically comparable in terms of 
the types of victimization they experienced (emotional 
abuse and neglect: psychotic symptoms absent 41% vs 
present 44%, χ2(2) = 0.141, P = .932; physical abuse: 60% 
vs 56%, χ2(2) = 0.355, P = .837; physical neglect: 27% vs 
26%, χ2(2) = 1.567, P = .457; sexual abuse: 4% vs 15%, 
χ2(2) = 4.058, P = .131; bullying: 45% vs 59%, χ2(2) = 
2.703, P = .259; domestic violence: 78% vs 59%, χ2(2) = 
4.748, P = .093).
Are Individual, Family, and Community-Level Factors 
Associated With the Absence of Age-12 Psychotic 
Symptoms Among Poly-victimized Children?
We first explored whether the potentially protective fac-
tors were operating in the context of exposure to poly-
victimization. A relatively high IQ and more positive 
atmosphere at home were found to be associated with 
a reduced likelihood of psychotic symptoms emerging 
among children exposed to poly-victimization (indicated 
by OR < 1; table 1). Higher levels of neighborhood social 
cohesion showed a protective trend but fell short of statis-
tical significance (P = .090). The associations were almost 
identical and remained statistically significant when con-
trolling for each other (IQ: OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.93–1.00, 
P = .043; atmosphere at home: OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.87–
1.00, P = .041), indicating that their effects were indepen-
dently protective against childhood psychotic symptoms 
in the context of poly-victimization. In terms of the 
atmosphere at home subscales, only the physical state of 
the home (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.70–1.00, P = .044) was 
found to be independently protective against psychotic 
symptoms, after controlling for IQ. The subscales relating 
to the stimulating nature (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.73–1.07, 
P = .208), happiness (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.59–1.02, P = 
.070), and predictability and calmness (OR = 0.80, 95% 
CI 0.60–1.06, P = .120) of the home environment were 
not found to be independently protective. None of the 
other individual-, family-, or community-level factors 
appeared to be significantly protective in this subsample 
(table 1).
Are Poly-victimized Children Who Do Not Develop 
Psychotic Symptoms Also Protected Against Other 
Mental Health Problems at Age 12?
In the group of children who did not develop age-12 psy-
chotic symptoms (N = 2002), poly-victimized children 
were more likely than those who were not poly-victimized 
to have conduct disorder (24.8% vs 4.1%, respectively; 
OR = 3.94, 95% CI 2.02–7.67, P < .001), clinically-rele-
vant depression (10.6% vs 2.3%; OR = 3.79, 95% CI 1.71–
8.36, P = .001), and extreme levels of anxiety (11.5% vs 
5.0%; OR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.19–4.86, P = .015) at age 12. 
Thus, indicating that poly-victimized children who were

protected against psychotic symptoms were not resilient 
more broadly to other mental health problems.
Are These Protective Factors Specific to Poly-victimized 
Children?
We further tested for interaction effects to understand 
whether the factors identified were particularly protective 
in relation to poly-victimization exposure. We did not find 
any of these interactions to be significant: IQ (interaction 
OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.95–1.02, P = .520), positive atmo-
sphere at home (interaction OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.93–1.06, 
P = .847), or social cohesion (interaction OR = 0.98, 95% 
CI 0.84–1.14, P = .786). Indeed, having a relatively high 
IQ, more positive atmosphere at home, and also higher 
levels of neighborhood social cohesion were also associ-
ated with a reduced likelihood of psychotic symptoms in 
the whole sample (table 2). All three of these associations 
held after controlling for the other significant factors, 
suggesting that higher IQ (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–0.99, 
P = .001), a more positive atmosphere at home (OR = 
0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.98, P = .003), and increased social 
cohesion (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.98, P = .012) were 
all independently associated with a reduced likelihood of 
childhood psychotic symptoms in the whole sample. In 
terms of the atmosphere at home subscales, the physical 
state (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.75–0.91, P < .001), stimu-
lating nature (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–0.99, P = .028), 
and predictability and calmness (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 
0.65–0.86, P < .001) of the home environment were all 
found to be independently associated with a reduced like-
lihood of psychotic symptoms, after controlling for IQ 
and social cohesion. The subscale relating to happiness 
within the home (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.74–1.03, P = .114) 
was not found to be independently associated.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate 
individual-, family-, and community-level factors that 
may protect children from developing psychotic symp-
toms. Having a relatively high IQ and more positive 
atmosphere at home were associated with a reduced like-
lihood of reporting psychotic symptoms at age 12, even 
when children had been victimized in multiple ways. We 
also found strong protective trends for children who lived 
in areas with higher levels of neighborhood social cohe-
sion in the poly-victimized group.
First, in terms of individual-level protective factors, 
our findings suggest that a relatively high IQ was associ-
ated with a reduced likelihood of developing psychotic 
symptoms, both in the high-risk group exposed to poly-
victimization and in the whole sample. This may indicate 
that such children do not manifest early neurodevelop-
mental impairments that have previously been linked to 
development of schizophrenia in adulthood.21 In terms 
of potential mechanisms, it is possible that a relatively 
high IQ could facilitate the development of effective 
coping styles that have previously been found to bolster 
resiliency against mental health problems,59,60 and there-
fore, might also be protective against the onset of psy-
chotic symptoms. Higher IQ may also promote cognitive 
flexibility that has been associated with an absence of 
psychopathology.61
A more positive atmosphere at home was also found 
to be protective in the poly-victimized group and among 
the general population, which is consistent with prior 
research that has highlighted the protective effects of fam-
ily stability in the context of adversity,62 and how more 
chaotic living situations can increase the risk of early psy-
chotic symptoms63 and adult psychosis.64 Given that some 
types of victimization that children are exposed to may 
take place outside of the home, the home environment 
may provide children with a safe, nurturing environment 
that acts as a refuge, which, in turn, may lessen the harm-
ful effects of their experiences on cognitive and emotional 
processes.65 Even for children where victimization does 
take place within the home, if there are other positive 
aspects to the environment, then children may be able to 
benefit from these, perhaps by buffering their overall stress 
response.66 Our atmosphere at home measure captured 
both physical (eg, noise, cleanliness and child-focused 
stimulation) and emotional (ie, whether the home felt like

Protective Factors for Child Psychotic Symptoms
a happy environment) aspects of the home environment 
and secondary analyses suggested that the physical attri-
butes were more protective. It would be useful for future 
studies to investigate further which specific elements are 
protective in order to inform prevention strategies.
In terms of community factors, higher levels of neigh-
borhood social cohesion were shown to have a protec-
tive trend in relation to childhood psychotic symptoms in 
the poly-victimized group and also independently among 
the general population. This is in keeping with previous 
studies that have found supportive relationships between 
neighbors promote positive parenting practices and may 
protect against the adverse effects of maltreatment.67,68 
Moreover, general perceptions of a supportive environ-
ment may facilitate children to more quickly obtain help 
with any distress they are experiencing and cope with 
it better,69 as well as potentially accessing normalizing 
explanations for their anomalous experiences that may 
reduce the likelihood of developing clinically-relevant 
psychotic symptoms.70
Our finding that having a higher IQ and more posi-
tive atmosphere at home (and to a nonsignificant degree, 
higher social cohesion) were protective in the context of 
poly-victimization is important because such children 
are at much higher odds of developing psychotic symp-
toms.8,11 Furthermore, this poly-victimized subgroup 
represent a much smaller number of individuals which 
is more practical in terms of targeting interventions. 
Assuming that our results are replicated in other cohorts, 
our findings could be utilized to inform which individu-
als should be targeted with preventive interventions, as 
well indicating the content or focus of such interventions, 
eg, engaging with families and educating parents on the 
importance of a structured positive home environment.
Notably, we also found that poly-victimized children in 
this sample who did not develop psychotic symptoms could 
not be considered to be broadly “resilient” to other mental 
health problems because they had higher rates of conduct 
disorder, depression, and anxiety symptoms compared to 
their peers who were not exposed to multiple types of vic-
timization. Given that poly-victimization is associated with 
a range of mental health problems,27 it is not surprising 
that the poly-victimized group showed elevated levels of 
other types of psychopathology. Our findings suggest that 
there may be different protective factors operating in rela-
tion to different mental health problems. A prior study22 in 
our cohort found sibling and maternal warmth to be pro-
tective in relation to emotional and behavioral problems at 
age 12 among children exposed to bullying victimization, 
whereas the current study did not find either factor to be 
protective against psychotic symptoms in the context of 
poly-victimization. Further research is required to estab-
lish which factors protect vulnerable children against a 
wider range of mental health problems.
All factors found to be protective in our poly- 
victimized 
group were also found to be associated with a reduced 
likelihood of age-12 psychotic symptoms in the whole 
sample. While it is interesting that factors continued to be 
protective among children at high risk, these factors were 
not unique or disproportionately protective in the con-
text of poly-victimization, as demonstrated by a lack of 
significant interaction effects. In the absence of any other 
studies in this area, we would welcome replication of our 
findings in order to establish whether other cohorts find 
similar results.
Limitations
Some limitations warrant consideration. First, despite 
this being a reasonably large cohort, the numbers of poly-
victimized children was fairly small and this may have 
limited our ability to detect some associations between 
the proposed protective factors and a reduced likeli-
hood of developing psychotic symptoms. These analyses 
thus warrant replication in even larger population-based 
cohorts. Second, we only focused on childhood psychotic 
symptoms and therefore cannot be certain whether chil-
dren unaffected at this age develop psychotic symptoms 
later. Thirdly, while this study was able to identify spe-
cific individual-, family-, and community-level factors 
that were associated with a reduced likelihood of child-
hood psychotic symptoms, we were not able to investi-
gate whether specific levels or ranges of these factors were 
associated with the lowest likelihood of psychotic symp-
toms emerging given the size of the poly-victimized group. 
However, this study does provide a useful starting point 
for future research to consider the relationships between 
different levels of each protective factor and the absence 
of psychotic symptoms among poly-victimized children. 
Fourth, childhood psychotic symptoms are associated 
not only with later development of schizophrenia but also 
other mental health problems,6,7 and thus, the findings 
cannot specifically be generalized to clinically-relevant 
psychosis in adults. Fifth, we were not able to account 
for the specific timings of victimization exposure71 nor 
was information available regarding attachment style,72,73 
and thus, we were unable to explore the potential role of 
these factors in our analyses. We also used a conservative 
cutoff to indicate the presence of victimization, which 
may have resulted in an underestimation of the true poly-
victimization rates. Finally, the E-Risk cohort comprises 
twins, and whether findings from twin studies generalize 
to singletons is sometimes contested. However, the chil-
dren in our study are representative of singletons for the 
prevalence of psychotic symptoms2,15,28,29 and representa-
tive of UK families in terms of geographic and socioeco-
nomic distribution.74
Conclusion
A relatively higher IQ, a more positive atmosphere at 
home, and higher neighborhood social cohesion were 
found to be associated with an absence of psychotic

symptoms at age 12 in this general population sample, 
even among those exposed to multiple forms of victimiza-
tion. In terms of practical implications, these findings sug-
gest we should aim to target prevention efforts toward the 
smaller “higher risk” group of poly-victimized children 
given that resources are often severely limited. If these 
findings are replicated in other large population-based 
cohorts, then it would be useful for clinicians, educators, 
and community workers to develop and test interven-
tions that could improve children’s home and community 
environments and support their cognitive development to 
hopefully increase their resiliency to childhood psychotic 
symptoms.
