Abstract
BACKGROUND—On the basis of data from a phase 2 trial that compared the checkpoint 
inhibitor ipilimumab at doses of 0.3 mg, 3 mg, and 10 mg per kilogram of body weight in patients 
with advanced melanoma, this phase 3 trial evaluated ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram 
in patients who had undergone complete resection of stage III melanoma.
METHODS—After patients had undergone complete resection of stage III cutaneous melanoma, 
we randomly assigned them to receive ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram (475 patients) 
or placebo (476) every 3 weeks for four doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years or until 
disease recurrence or an unacceptable level of toxic effects occurred. Recurrence-free survival was 
the primary end point. Secondary end points included overall survival, distant metastasis–free 
survival, and safety.
RESULTS—At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the 5-year rate of recurrence-free survival was 
40.8% in the ipilimumab group, as compared with 30.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for 
recurrence or death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001). The rate of overall 
survival at 5 years was 65.4% in the ipilimumab group, as compared with 54.4% in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio for death, 0.72; 95.1% CI, 0.58 to 0.88; P = 0.001). The rate of distant 
metastasis–free survival at 5 years was 48.3% in the ipilimumab group, as compared with 38.9% 
in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death or distant metastasis, 0.76; 95.8% CI, 0.64 to 0.92; P = 
0.002). Adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 54.1% of the patients in the ipilimumab group 
and in 26.2% of those in the placebo group. Immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 
occurred in 41.6% of the patients in the ipilimumab group and in 2.7% of those in the placebo 
group. In the ipilimumab group, 5 patients (1.1%) died owing to immune-related adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS—As adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage III melanoma, ipilimumab at a dose of 
10 mg per kilogram resulted in significantly higher rates of recurrence-free survival, overall 
survival, and distant metastasis–free survival than placebo. There were more immune-related

 adverse events with ipilimumab than with placebo. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00636168, and EudraCT number, 2007-001974-10.)
IPILIMUMAB, A FULLY HUMAN MONOCLONAL antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to augment anti-tumor immune responses, was approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency in 2011 at a 
dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight for the treatment of advanced melanoma.1,2 On 
the basis of data from a phase 2 trial that indicated the potential for a dose of 10 mg per 
kilogram to have higher efficacy than the dose of 0.3 mg or 3 mg per kilogram in patients 
with advanced melanoma, although at a cost of more toxic effects,3,4 we conducted a phase 
3 trial (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] 18071) of 
ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram in patients who had resected regional lymph 
node–positive (stage III) melanoma with a high risk of recurrence.
The likelihood of systemic metastatic disease among patients with stage III melanoma 
correlates closely with microscopic versus palpable nodal disease and with the number of 
positive nodes.5–7 The population of patients with stage III melanoma is heterogeneous, with 
disease-specific survival rates of 78% among patients with stage IIIA disease, 59% among 
those with stage IIIB disease, and 40% among those with stage IIIC disease.5–7 Even within 
the population of patients who have sentinel node–positive cancer, heterogeneity is 
remarkable and correlates closely with tumor load in the sentinel node (as defined by the 
Rotterdam criteria; see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org).8–10 Patients with a metastasis of more than 1 mm in the greatest 
dimension have a significantly higher risk of recurrence or death than those with a 
metastasis of 1 mm or less in the greatest dimension.8–10
We previously reported the primary results of the EORTC 18071 phase 3 trial in which we 
compared adjuvant ipilimumab with placebo in patients with resected stage III melanoma.11 
At a median follow-up of 2.7 years, adjuvant ipilimumab was associated with significantly 
prolonged recurrence-free survival, the primary end point, as compared with placebo (hazard 
ratio, 0.75; P = 0.001). The results on the global health scale, which was the primary health-
related quality-of-life end point, were not affected by ipilimumab.12 Approval from the FDA 
was granted in 2015 on the basis of the results of this trial. The effect of ipilimumab on 
overall survival and distant metastasis–free survival is important, given that the only other 
approved systemic therapy in the context of adjuvant therapy, interferon alfa, has a marginal 
effect on overall survival.13–15 Here, we report, at a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the 
efficacy of adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab on all survival end points in patients with high-
risk stage III melanoma after complete lymph-node dissection.
METHODS
PATIENTS
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed cutaneous 
melanoma that was metastatic to regional lymph nodes. According to the American Joint 
Committee on Cancer 2009 classification, patients had stage IIIA melanoma (patients with 
N1a cancer [i.e., only one node involved with micrometastasis] had to have at least one

 metastasis measuring >1 mm in the greatest dimension) or stage IIIB or IIIC melanoma with 
no in-transit metastases (i.e., growing >2 cm away from the primary tumor but before 
reaching the nearest lymph node).2 Complete regional lymphadenectomy was required 
within 12 weeks before randomization. Exclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of more than 1 (on a scale from 0 to 5, 
with higher numbers indicating greater disability), autoimmune disease, uncontrolled 
infection, substantial cardiovascular disease (New York Heart Association functional class 
III or IV), a lactate dehydrogenase level of more than 2 times the upper limit of the normal 
range, use of systemic glucocorticoids, and previous systemic therapy for melanoma.
TRIAL DESIGN AND REGIMEN
In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were enrolled at 99 centers in 19 
countries. Registration was done centrally at the EORTC headquarters. A central interactive 
voice-response system was used for randomization and was based on a minimization 
technique.16 Randomization was stratified according to disease stage (stage IIIA vs. stage 
IIIB vs. stage IIIC with one, two, or three positive nodes vs. stage IIIC with four or more 
positive nodes) and geographic region (North America, Europe, or Australia). Local 
pharmacists, who were aware of the trial-group assignments, performed the randomization. 
Clinical investigators and persons collecting or analyzing the data were unaware of the trial-
group assignments.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an intravenous infusion of 
ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses, then 
every 3 months for up to 3 years or until disease recurrence, an unacceptable level of toxic 
effects, a major protocol violation, or withdrawal of consent (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The rules regarding the withholding of a dose of ipilimumab or placebo and the 
management of immune-related adverse events are detailed in the full trial protocol, 
available at NEJM.org.
The primary end point was recurrence-free survival. The secondary end points included 
overall survival, distant metastasis–free survival, safety, and health-related quality of life.
ASSESSMENTS
Patients in the two trial groups were assessed for recurrence and distant metastases every 3 
months during the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter. Physical examination and 
radiography of the chest, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or other 
imaging techniques were performed if indicated. Recurrence or metastatic lesions had to be 
histologically confirmed whenever possible. The first date when recurrence was observed 
was used in the analysis, regardless of the method of assessment.
Recurrence-free survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of first 
recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death from any cause. Overall survival 
was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. Distant metastasis–
free survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first distant 
metastasis or death from any cause.

 Data on adverse events were collected for each group with the use of the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Immune-related adverse events were 
determined programmatically from a prespecified list of terms from the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), which was updated according to each new version of 
MedDRA.
Resolution of an immune-related adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was defined as an 
improvement to grade 1 or less. The grade 3 or 4 event with the longest time to resolution 
was selected for inclusion in the analysis. If the grade 3 or 4 event did not resolve, follow-up 
was censored at the last known date that the patient was alive. Similar analyses were 
repeated for immune-related adverse events of grade 2 through 5.
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
The trial protocol was approved by the EORTC protocol-review committee and by 
independent ethics committees. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice guidelines as defined by the International 
Conference on Harmonisation. All the patients provided written informed consent.
The trial was funded and sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The trial was designed by the 
writing committee (the trial coordinator [the first author], the EORTC headquarters team, 
and a representative of the sponsor). Data were collected and computerized at the EORTC 
headquarters and were copied to the sponsor after the database lock. Data were analyzed 
independently at the EORTC headquarters and by the sponsor. The manuscript was written 
by two of the academic authors (the first and penultimate authors), all the coauthors 
commented on it, and editorial assistance was provided by professional medical writers paid 
by the sponsor. The two specified academic authors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication, with the consent of all the other authors. The authors vouch for 
accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and confirm the adherence of the trial to 
the protocol.
An independent review committee, whose members were unaware of the trial-group 
assignments, assessed disease status and date of recurrence. An independent data and safety 
monitoring board assessed the safety and efficacy data every 6 months, without formal 
interim analyses. Only at the time of the final analysis of recurrence-free survival were 
interim analyses of overall survival and distant metastasis–free survival performed by an 
independent statistician, and the results were forwarded to members of the data and safety 
monitoring board. On-site source-data verification was provided by a clinical research 
organization.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We planned for the trial to include 950 patients. In the initial protocol, we calculated that a 
total of 491 deaths would be required in order to provide the trial with 85% power to detect a 
difference in the 4.5-year overall survival rates of 42.3% in the placebo group and 52.0% in 
the ipilimumab group, corresponding to a hazard ratio for death of 0.76. Owing to an 
improvement in outcomes after recurrence (because of a change in the treatment landscape 
for patients with melanoma), it was decided, by means of a protocol amendment, to perform

 the final analyses for overall survival and distant metastasis–free survival at the same time. 
Given the 506 events of distant metastasis or death and 376 deaths at the clinical cutoff date 
(January 31, 2016), it was recomputed (with the use of a Lan–DeMets alpha-spending 
function) that the final analyses of overall survival and distant metastasis–free survival be 
performed at two-sided alpha levels of 0.049 and 0.042, respectively, so the confidence 
interval for the hazard ratio of the group comparison regarding these end points was set at 
95.1% and 95.8%, respectively; the statistical power was 75.8% and 89.4%, respectively. 
The statistical analysis plan (available with the trial protocol) indicated that in order to 
preserve the alpha error, a hierarchical-testing approach would be applied after the analysis 
of the primary end point of recurrence-free survival. Overall survival was tested first, 
followed by distant metastasis–free survival. For the subgroup analysis, the estimated hazard 
ratio was plotted along with its 99% confidence interval.
The main analyses of the efficacy end points included all the patients who had undergone 
randomization, according to the intention-to-treat principle. The safety profile was assessed 
in patients who received at least one dose of the randomly assigned regimen. Details of the 
statistical methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
RESULTS
PATIENTS AND TRIAL REGIMEN
From July 2008 through August 2011, a total of 951 patients underwent randomization: 475 
patients were assigned to the ipilimumab group and 476 to the placebo group. The 
characteristics at baseline were similar between the two randomized groups (Table 1).
Six patients (4 patients in the ipilimumab group and 2 in the placebo group) did not start the 
randomly assigned regimen (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median number 
of doses that were received was 4 doses (interquartile range, 3 to 8) in the ipilimumab group 
and 8 (interquartile range, 4 to 16) in the placebo group. At least 1 maintenance dose (dose 5 
and beyond) was received by 198 of 471 patients (42.0%) in the ipilimumab group and by 
332 of 474 (70.0%) in the placebo group.
Of 471 patients who started ipilimumab, 251 (53.3%) discontinued treatment owing to an 
adverse event (including 182 patients [38.6%] who discontinued within 12 weeks after 
randomization); in 240 patients (51.0%), the event was considered by the investigators to be 
drug-related. Among 474 patients who received placebo, 22 (4.6%) discontinued treatment 
owing to an adverse event. A total of 135 patients (28.7%) in the ipilimumab group 
discontinued treatment because of disease recurrence, as compared with 282 (59.5%) in the 
placebo group. A total of 63 patients (13.4%) in the ipilimumab group and 143 (30.2%) in 
the placebo group completed the 3-year treatment period (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
The overall median follow-up was 5.3 years. The median follow-up was 5.3 years in the 
ipilimumab group and 5.4 years in the placebo group.

 EFFICACY AND POSTPROTOCOL TREATMENT
In this updated analysis, the rate of recurrence-free survival at 5 years was 40.8% in the 
ipilimumab group, as compared with 30.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for 
recurrence or death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). 
The overall significant prolongation of recurrence-free survival that was due to adjuvant 
ipilimumab appeared to be consistent across subgroups (Fig. S3A in the Supplementary 
Appendix), but the trial was not powered to provide robust subgroup analysis. Ipilimumab 
appeared to be helpful in patients with microscopic involvement (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 
0.68) and in patients with macroscopic involvement (hazard ratio, 0.84) (Fig. S3B and S3C 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Among the 264 patients in the ipilimumab group who had recurrence or died, 194 had 
received at least one postprotocol treatment (Table 2). These treatments included ipilimumab 
(24 patients), anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy (24 patients), and a BRAF inhibitor 
(63 patients). Among the 323 patients in the placebo group who had recurrence or died, 250 
received postprotocol treatment: ipilimumab (76 patients), anti–PD-1 therapy (30 patients), 
and a BRAF inhibitor (88 patients). Overall survival after disease recurrence was similar in 
the two trial groups (hazard ratio for ipilimumab vs. placebo, 0.89), which suggests that the 
difference in recurrence-free survival would persist in terms of overall survival.
The overall survival rate at 5 years was 65.4% (95% CI, 60.8 to 69.6) in the ipilimumab 
group, as compared with 54.4% (95% CI, 49.7 to 58.9) in the placebo group. Overall 
survival was significantly longer in the ipilimumab group than in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio for death from any cause, 0.72; 95.1% CI, 0.58 to 0.88; P = 0.001) (Fig. 1B). The 
prolongation of overall survival with ipilimumab was generally consistent across subgroups 
(Fig. 2, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of distant metastasis– free 
survival at 5 years was higher in the ipilimumab group than in the placebo group (48.3% vs. 
38.9%; hazard ratio for distant metastasis or death, 0.76; 95.8% CI, 0.64 to 0.92; P = 0.002) 
(Fig. 1C).
SAFETY
Among the 471 patients who received ipilimumab, 465 (98.7%) had an adverse event of any 
grade, with grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in 255 patients (54.1%); among the 474 
patients who received placebo, 432 (91.1%) had an adverse event of any grade, with grade 3 
or 4 adverse events occurring in 124 (26.2%) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Immune-related adverse events during the trial were more frequent with ipilimumab than 
with placebo (Table 3). Immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 41.6% of 
the patients in the ipilimumab group and in 2.7% of those in the placebo group. The most 
common immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 in the ipilimumab group were 
gastrointestinal (in 16.1% of the patients), hepatic (in 10.8%), and endocrine (in 7.9%). The 
median time to the onset of immune-related adverse events of grade 2 through 5 during the 
trial ranged from 4.0 weeks (skin immune-related adverse events) to 13.1 weeks (neurologic 
immune-related adverse events) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Endocrine 
immune-related adverse events of grade 2 through 5 resolved in 51.5% of the patients, and 
the median time to resolution was 54.3 weeks. The majority (82 to 97%) of all other

 immune-related adverse events of grade 2, 3, or 4 resolved, and the median time to 
resolution ranged from 4.0 to 8.0 weeks.
Five patients (1.1%) died owing to adverse events that were attributed to ipilimumab: three 
patients died from colitis (two patients with intestinal perforation), one patient from 
myocarditis, and one patient from multiorgan failure that was associated with the Guillain–
Barré syndrome. These deaths occurred before the start of maintenance therapy. Of these 
patients, four had received glucocorticoids and one anti–tumor necrosis factor antibodies.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients with resected, high-risk stage III 
melanoma, ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram significantly prolonged overall 
survival and distant metastasis–free survival as compared with placebo. The risk of death 
was 28% lower with ipilimumab than with placebo, and the risk of distant metastasis or 
death was lower by 24%. At 5 years, ipilimumab treatment was associated with rates that 
were approximately 10 percentage points higher than the rates with placebo for all end 
points: recurrence-free survival (40.8% vs. 30.3%), overall survival (65.4% vs. 54.4%), and 
distant metastasis–free survival (48.3% vs. 38.9%). The results show that at the cost of 
substantial toxic effects, the previously observed prolongation of recurrence-free survival 
with ipilimumab is confirmed in the current updated analysis and that it translated into a 
prolongation in overall survival and distant metastasis–free survival.
Despite successful treatment with surgery (followed by adjuvant therapy in patients at high 
risk for disease recurrence), only approximately 45% of patients with stage III melanoma 
will be disease-free after 4 years; less than 40% of patients who have surgery alone will be 
disease-free after 4 years.17 Interferon alfa is currently approved in both the United States 
and the European Union for the treatment of stage III melanoma after surgery. In a literature-
based meta-analysis of 17 randomized, controlled trials involving 8122 patients with high-
risk cutaneous melanoma, interferon alfa prolonged the time to recurrence (hazard ratio for 
disease recurrence with interferon alfa vs. observation, 0.82).15 Owing to the marginal 
benefit in overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.89) and the considerable toxic effects, 
interferon alfa is not widely used as an adjuvant therapy.18 Although the benefit–risk profile 
of interferon alfa as compared with ipilimumab remains unclear, a phase 3 trial (ECOG 
1609) that directly compares interferon alfa with ipilimumab at a dose of 3 or 10 mg per 
kilogram in patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT01274338). In our trial (EORTC 18071), patients were treated for up to 3 
years, but only 13.4% of the patients completed this treatment period and 40% had stopped 
ipilimumab treatment at the end of the first four doses over the first 3 months. Thus, the 
EORTC 18071 trial cannot address whether maintenance treatment is necessary.
In the current trial, the survival benefit of ipilimumab over placebo was generally consistent 
across subgroups. This benefit was observed not only in patients with microscopic 
involvement only (sentinel node–positive) but also in patients with macroscopic or palpable 
nodes. In contrast, in previous EORTC trials of adjuvant therapy in patients with 
melanoma,17,19–22 a significant benefit with interferon alfa was observed only in patients

 with microscopic involvement. Similarly, in contrast to interferon alfa, for which ulceration 
is the overriding determinant of activity,13,17,20–23 ipilimumab prolonged survival among 
patients with nonulcerated melanoma and among those with ulcerated melanoma.
The rate of adverse events with ipilimumab in the context of adjuvant therapy was 
substantial and led to the discontinuation of treatment in approximately 40% of the patients 
by the end of the initial dosing period (i.e., before maintenance therapy). This frequency is 
higher than that observed with the same dose in the pooled analysis involving patients with 
advanced melanoma.2–4 The vast majority of immune-related adverse events of grade 2, 3, 
or 4 resolved within 4 to 8 weeks with the use of established management guidelines. 
However, for endocrinopathies, the median time to resolution was 54 weeks, and 48.5% of 
the patients who had endocrinopathy continue to take hormone-replacement therapies. In 
this trial, adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab was associated with a higher risk and greater 
degree of diarrhea, insomnia, and fatigue than placebo during the induction period, but 
ipilimumab did not have a negative effect on the global health scale of health-related quality 
of life.12
Of concern are the five patients (1.1%) in the ipilimumab group who died owing to drug-
related adverse events. In the context of adjuvant therapy, the benefit–risk profile is 
particularly important in view of the prognostic heterogeneity observed in patients with 
stage III melanoma.
In conclusion, adjuvant ipilimumab was associated with clinical improvements and 
significantly prolonged overall survival and distant metastasis–free survival, as compared 
with placebo, among patients with high-risk stage III melanoma, thus extending previous 
findings of a prolongation of recurrence-free survival. Adverse events were common but 
mostly transient. Some adverse events were serious, and even death from treatment occurred 
despite the use of established treatment algorithms.

 Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Recurrence-free Survival (RFS), Overall Survival, and 
Distant Metastasis– free Survival (DMFS)
Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimate of recurrence-free survival according to the 
independent review committee. In the ipilimumab group, local or regional recurrence was 
reported in 96 patients, distant metastasis or death due to melanoma in 157, and death due to 
another cause or an unknown cause in 11. In the placebo group, local or regional recurrence 
was reported in 114 patients, distant metastasis or death due to melanoma in 204, and death 
due to another cause or an unknown cause in 5. All the statistical comparisons shown here 
were stratified according to the disease stage as provided at randomization. In the

 comparison that was stratified according to the disease stage as given on case-report forms, 
the hazard ratio for recurrence or death was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.90; P = 0.001). In a per-
protocol analysis of the comparison that was stratified according to the disease stage as 
given at randomization, the hazard ratio was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.91; P = 0.002). Panel B 
shows the Kaplan–Meier estimate of overall survival. Because the number of patients with a 
follow-up of more than 7 years was too small, the estimated median overall survival was 
either unreliable or not reached. In the comparison that was stratified according to the 
disease stage as given on case-report forms, the hazard ratio for death was 0.73 (95.1% CI, 
0.60 to 0.90; P = 0.003). In a per-protocol analysis of the comparison stratified according to 
the disease stage as given at randomization, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95.1% CI, 0.58 to 
0.89; P = 0.002). Panel C shows the Kaplan–Meier estimate of distant metastasis–free 
survival according to the independent review committee. In the comparison that was 
stratified according to the disease stage as given on the case-report forms, the hazard ratio 
for distant metastasis or death was 0.77 (95.8% CI, 0.65 to 0.93; P = 0.004). In a per-
protocol analysis of the comparison stratified according to the disease stage as given at 
randomization, the hazard ratio was 0.76 (95.8% CI, 0.63 to 0.91; P = 0.003).

 Figure 2. Forest Plot for Overall Survival, According to Trial Group
Results are expressed as unstratified hazard ratios for the risk of death in the ipilimumab 
group as compared with the placebo group with 95% confidence intervals for the analysis of 
the total group and with 99% confidence intervals for all the subgroup analyses. The size of 
the box is proportional to the total number of deaths reported in each subgroup, the diamond 
is centered on the overall hazard ratio for death and covers its 95% confidence interval, and 
the dashed line represents the overall hazard ratio for death. The P value for the univariate 
analysis that included all patients was provided by the unstratified log-rank test. The P value 
for the analysis of heterogeneity between the hazard ratios computed within the subgroups 
of a given variable was provided by the test of heterogeneity (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). The disease stage, according to the case-report forms, was determined with the 
use of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 2002 criteria. The number of positive 
lymph nodes was determined by means of pathological testing. Additional information is 
provided in Figure S4A in the Supplementary Appendix.

*The safety analysis included all the patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of ipilimumab or placebo (945 patients). Immune-related adverse events that occurred in at least 
10% of the patients are reported. Patients may have had more than one event. In the ipilimumab group, 5 patients died because of drug-related adverse events; 3 patients died from colitis (2 patients with 
gastrointestinal perforation), 1 from myocarditis, and 1 from multiorgan failure associated with the Guillain–Barré syndrome.
†Gastrointestinal perforation occurred in seven patients (1.5%) in the ipilimumab group (all such events were considered to be related to ipilimumab) and in three patients (0.6%) in the placebo group (none 
of these events were considered to be related to placebo).
‡In the ipilimumab group, 26 patients had a grade 3 or 4 lipase level, 4 had a grade 3 or 4 immune-system disorder (hypersensitivity, auto-immune disorder, anaphylactoid reaction, or drug hypersensitivity), 
4 had grade 3 lung infiltration, pneumonitis, or interstitial lung disease, 1 had arthritis, and 1 had uveitis.
