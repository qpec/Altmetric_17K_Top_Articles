Summary
Background Global estimates of unsafe abortions have been produced for 1995, 2003, and 2008. However, 
reconceptualisation of the framework and methods for estimating abortion safety is needed owing to the increased 
availability of simple methods for safe abortion (eg, medical abortion), the increasingly widespread use of misoprostol 
outside formal health systems in contexts where abortion is legally restricted, and the need to account for the multiple 
factors that affect abortion safety.
Methods We used all available empirical data on abortion methods, providers, and settings, and factors affecting 
safety as covariates within a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the global, regional, and subregional distributions 
of abortion by safety categories. We used a three-tiered categorisation based on the WHO definition of unsafe abortion 
and WHO guidelines on safe abortion to categorise abortions as safe or unsafe and to further divide unsafe abortions 
into two categories of less safe and least safe.
Findings Of the 55· 7 million abortions that occurred worldwide each year between 2010–14, we estimated that 
30·6 million (54·9%, 90% uncertainty interval 49·9–59·4) were safe, 17·1 million (30·7%, 25·5–35·6) were less safe, 
and 8·0 million (14·4%, 11·5–18·1) were least safe. Thus, 25·1 million (45·1%, 40·6–50·1) abortions each year 
between 2010 and 2014 were unsafe, with 24·3 million (97%) of these in developing countries. The proportion of 
unsafe abortions was significantly higher in developing countries than developed countries (49·5% vs 12·5%). When 
grouped by the legal status of abortion, the proportion of unsafe abortions was significantly higher in countries with 
highly restrictive abortion laws than in those with less restrictive laws.
Interpretation Increased efforts are needed, especially in developing countries, to ensure access to safe abortion. 
The paucity of empirical data is a limitation of these findings. Improved in-country data for health services and 
innovative research to address these gaps are needed to improve future estimates.

Introduction
Despite scientific advances that enable the provision of 
safe abortion at the primary care level, unsafe abortions 
persist and result in a high burden of complications; 
maternal death; and substantial costs to women, families, 
and health systems.1–3
WHO defines unsafe abortion as a procedure for 
termination of a pregnancy done by an individual who 
does not have the necessary training or in an environment 
not conforming to minimal medical standards. However, 
abortions done in accordance with these standards are 
considered safe and the risk of severe complications or 
death is minimal.4 The people, skills, and environment 
needed to meet medical standards are outlined in WHO 
guidelines, which are updated periodically.5,6 In the 
25 years since unsafe abortion was defined, evidence has 
evolved and simple technologies, such as manual vacuum 
aspiration and medical abortion (with mifepristone and 
misoprostol, or misoprostol alone if mifepristone is 
unavailable), have made the provision of safe abortions 
possible at the primary care level and by health workers 
other than doctors.5,6 The conditions leading to a safe 
abortion are in turn affected by numerous factors, 
including the laws and policies on abortion (ie, legal 
context), the socioeconomic conditions, the availability of 
safe abortion services, and the stigma surrounding 
abortion. Stigma related to seeking or provision of 
abortion is increasingly being recognised as having an

effect on how and where women access care and who 
provides care.7
Estimates of the magnitude of unsafe abortion have 
been periodically produced since 1995. Because of the 
paucity of data, previous estimates relied on the legality of 
abortion in a given setting and a qualitative assessment of 
the country context as the primary basis for distinguishing 
safe from unsafe abortions.8,9 This approach to classification 
was a reasonable proxy for safety in an era when only 
facility-based surgical abortions met medical standards of 
safety and when unsafe abortions in legally restricted 
contexts were usually done with dangerous and invasive 
methods. However, the increasingly widespread sub-
stitution of such dangerous methods with misoprostol 
outside formal health systems necessitates reconceptual-
isation of how we categorise abortion safety to capture the 
spectrum of situations that constitute unsafe abortion and 
the continuum of risk they represent.4,10
About 55·7 million abortions took place worldwide 
every year during the period of 2010–14, the most recent 
period for which information about abortion incidence is 
available.11 Here, we present a new theoretical framework 
within a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate cross-
sectional estimates of the global, regional, and subregional 
distributions of these abortions by safety categories. In 
doing so, we replace the dichotomous classification of 
abortion safety that has been used since 1990 with a 
three-tiered classification underpinned by WHO recom-
mendations for safe abortion.
Methods
Study design
We analysed data from 182 countries and regions listed 
by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs 
(UN DESA), Population Division.12 We excluded 
small countries with populations of fewer than 
100 000 inhabitants because of insufficient information 
about covariates. Figure 1 is a schematic rep 
resentation 
of the analysis framework.
We systematically searched PubMed, POPLINE, and 
Embase without language filters; LILACS and SciELO 
for 
Spanish-language 
and 
Portuguese-language 
articles; BDSP and INEDOC for French-language 
studies; Panteleimon for Russian-language studies; 
and

OpenThesis dissertation database, did snowball 
searches of websites of non-governmental organ-
isations, canvassed relevant online discussion groups 
and experts in the field, and hand searched references 
cited in identified studies. We searched for data from 
Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2015. For the purpose of this 
analysis, we used the subset of the search results for 
2010–14. We first included national data for 2010–14; 
for countries without such data, we included national 
data for 2008–09 if available and, in the absence of 
both, we considered subnational data on a case-by-case 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
From 1990 to 2008, WHO used indirect estimation techniques to 
determine the incidence of abortion in countries with restrictive 
laws and in countries with more permissive laws but where a 
large number of abortions took place illegally. These abortions 
were labelled as unsafe, and these estimates were integrated with 
estimates of the incidence of legal abortion worldwide, developed 
by the Guttmacher Institute. Such global, regional, and 
subregional estimates of safe and unsafe abortions have been 
produced for 1995, 2003, and 2008. The most recent estimates 
were published in The Lancet in 2012 and concluded that 
21·6 million (49%) of 43·8 million abortions in 2008 were unsafe. 
However, to date, categorisation of safety based on the actual 
characteristics of abortion has never been attempted.
Added value of this study
The new approach used in this study represents a significant 
advance compared with previously published estimates for 
several reasons. First, this study is the first to explicitly align the 
operational estimation of safety categories with the conceptual 
definition of unsafe abortion used by WHO and with the technical 
standards of care outlined in WHO guidelines. Second, use of a 
model-based approach allowed for consideration of multiple 
factors affecting abortion safety in a systematic way. 
Third, replacement of the dichotomous division of safety with a 
three-tiered classification (safe, less safe, and least safe) permitted 
a more nuanced description of the spectrum of varying situations 
that constitute unsafe abortion and the increasingly widespread 
substitution of dangerous, invasive methods with use of 
misoprostol outside formal health systems in some legally 
restricted contexts to be accounted for. Fourth, this study is the 
first to include uncertainty bounds around the estimates.
Implications of all the available evidence
The three-tiered categorisation of safety in this paper replaces the 
previous dichotomous classification of safety. Although simple 
and safe primary care interventions for safe abortion exist, about 
25·1 million unsafe abortions took place worldwide each year 
between 2010 and 2014, of which 24·3 million (97%) were in 
developing countries. The findings call for the need to ensure 
access to safe abortion to the full extent of the law, particularly in 
low-income regions of the world. Efforts are also needed to 
replace the use of unsafe methods with safe methods. The study 
also highlighted the need for routine collection of monitoring 
data within health systems and development of innovative 
research methods to address data gaps to improve future 
estimates.

basis. We excluded clinical trials and data limited to 
specific age subgroups (eg, adolescents) or occupation-
related sub 
groups (eg, sex workers). We assessed the 
remaining sources for quality of reporting with five 
criteria adapted from items within the Strengthening 
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
(STROBE) statement: eligibility criteria for study 
sample clearly defined, methods of measurement of 
each variable of interest defined, characteristics of 
study participants provided, clear numerator and 
denominator information included, and inclusion of a 
discussion of sources of bias in the results. Reports 
and papers not meeting at least three of the five criteria 
were excluded. The included studies used different 
designs and included population-based surveys with 
reports from women on abortion care-seeking, indirect 
data based on surveys of health professionals, and 
nationally or subnationally rep 
resentative data on 
abortion management at the facility level.
Theoretical framework
We used the WHO definition of unsafe abortion and 
recommendations within WHO guidelines on safe 
abortion4–6 to conceptualise abortion safety as falling into 
three categories: safe, less safe, and least safe. The less-safe 
and least-safe categories together reflect the spectrum of 
unsafe abortions. We classified abortions as safe if they 
were done with a method recommended by WHO (medical 
abortion, vacuum aspiration, or dilatation and evacuation) 
that was appropriate to the pregnancy duration and if the 
person providing the abortion was trained. We classified 
abortions as less safe if only one of the two criteria were 
met—ie, either the abortion was done by a trained provider 
but with an outdated method (eg, sharp curettage) or a safe 
method of abortion (eg, misoprostol) was used but without 
adequate information or support from a trained individual. 
We classified abortions as least safe if they were provided 
by untrained individuals using dangerous methods, such 
as ingestion of caustic substances, insertion of foreign 
bodies, or use of traditional concoctions.
From a review of the literature and expert group 
discussions, we identified factors affecting abortion safety 
at the country level. We organised these factors into five 
conceptual domains: (1) the abortion service-delivery 
environment, which encompasses the availability of safe 
methods, trained providers, and facilities equipped to 
provide safe abortion; (2) financial access to services, 
which refers to a woman’s ability to pay for safe abortion 
services within or outside her country of residence; 
(3) abortion stigma, which reflects attitudes toward 
abortion and is associated with gender inequality regarding 
women’s empowerment, autonomy, and agency;7 (4) legal 
context, which accounts for the legal grounds for abortion, 
associated laws and policies, and their interpretation and 
implementation; and (5) development, which includes the 
overall development level of health services and health 
infrastructure.
Model inputs
We used our theoretical framework to categorise the 
available empirical data into three catergories of safety. 
Sources did not typically include data on all three 
characteristics (methods, providers, and settings); thus 
we mainly relied on data related to methods used to 
induce abortion (available in 132 [88%] of the included 
sources) to categorise abortions as safe, less safe, or least 
safe. Given the absence of standardised reporting among 
the data sources, this characteristic was also the simplest 
to interpret in relation to WHO recommendations. For 
14 (9%) sources, for which information about methods 
was not available, we relied on data describing the types 
of providers from whom services were obtained, and, 
for four (3%) sources, for which neither of these 
characteristics were available, we used data on the setting 
where abortion took place.
Data were used as point estimates if they were 
representative of a cross-section of women nationally or

Theoretical framework 
We used the WHO definition of unsafe abortion and WHO technical guidelines 
to create a three-tiered classification of abortion:
• Safe abortion: provided by health-care workers and with methods 
 recommended by WHO
• Less-safe abortion: done by trained providers using non-recommended 
 methods or using a safe method (eg, misoprostol) but without adequate 
  information or support from a trained individual 
• Least-safe abortion: done by untrained people using dangerous, 
 invasive methods
We organised factors affecting safety of abortion into five conceptual domains:
• Availability of safe methods, trained providers, and facilities
• Legal context of abortion
• Financial access to services
• Abortion stigma
• Overall development of health services and infrastructure
Model inputs
We identified 150 pieces of empirical data on methods, providers, or settings 
from surveys, national statistics, and specialised studies to establish safety 
categories
We identified covariates from the five conceptual domains*:
• Number of years that mifepristone had been registered in the country
• Registration of misoprostol
• Proportion of the population living in urban areas
• Gender inequality index 
Modelling
We used a Bayesian model with two hierarchical regression submodels:
• Regression model 1: probability (safe abortion) = function (covariate set)
• Regression model 2: probability (least-safe abortion among unsafe 
 abortions) = function (covariate set)
Outputs 
With regression model 1, we estimated the proportions of safe and unsafe 
abortions
With regression model 2, we estimated the proportions of less-safe and 
least-safe abortions

subnationally. When not representative of a cross-
section of women, data were used to represent a 
maximum upper limit of the proportion of safe 
abortions or a minimum lower limit for the proportion 
of least-safe abortions (appendix). For 18 countries for 
which data on the distribution of abortions by methods 
were available from official statistics for multiple years 
in the study period, we averaged the data across the 
available years. Further detail for the data sources is 
available in the appendix.
Within the five conceptual domains, we listed potential 
plausible covariates and shortlisted those for which 
systematic information for the reference period was 
available for at least 85% of the countries. We assessed 
potential covariates for availability of data and ease of 
interpretation and chose those that were conceptually the 
strongest. Details of the covariates used or considered 
can be found in the appendix.
Our final set of covariates for estimating the proportion 
of safe abortions included the number of years that 
mifepristone had been registered in the country; the 
proportion of the population that lived in urban areas; 
and the gender inequality index (GII), which is a 
composite measure that includes indicators of repro-
ductive health (measured as the maternal mortality ratio 
and adolescent birth rates), empowerment (measured as 
proportion of parliamentary seats occupied by women 
and proportion of adult women and men aged 25 years 
or older with at least some secondary education), and 
economic status (measured as labour force participation 
of women and men aged 15 years or older).13 Additionally, 
the registration status of misoprostol (for any indication) 
was used as a covariate to distinguish abortions using 
misoprostol outside of health systems from the least-
safe abortions. Although considered, the legal grounds 
for abortion and the gross national income (GNI) were 
not used in the final model because these covariates 
did not improve model fit. Additionally, not using 
these covariates in the model allowed presentation of 
results for countries grouped by legal status and by 
economic levels.
We used time-matched covariates to fit the model; 
however, we used 2012 values for covariates to calculate 
estimates for 2010–14. Country point estimates for the 
three safety categories were based on rescaled median 
posterior estimates for each country. Rescaled median 
values were used as point estimates to ensure that the sum 
of the estimated proportions was equal to one. Country-
level proportions of abortions in each safety category, 
estimated with the model, were weighted on the basis of 
available, modelled estimates of abortion incidence in each 
country and aggregated to the subregional, regional, and 
global levels with the UN DESA classification of countries. 
We calculated 90% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the 
aggregate outcomes using the highest posterior density 
intervals for the respective posterior samples for these 
outcomes. We limited the presentation of results to the 
subregional level as the lowest level of disaggregation 
given the paucity of data at the country level.
We examined the distribution of safety categories for 
countries grouped together on the basis of the legal 
grounds on which abortion was allowed. We used the 
existing UN DESA classification of countries according to 
abortion law14 to group countries into three broad 
categories: countries where abortion on request was 
allowed, countries where abortion on request was not 
allowed but where the legal grounds included preservation 
of a woman’s mental health or socioeconomic reasons, 
and countries that did not allow abortion or only allowed it 
to save the life or physical health of a woman. We also 
examined the distribution of safety categories when 
countries were grouped on the basis of their per-head 
income with the standard World Bank classification.15
We did not directly estimate abortion-related deaths in 
our analysis. However, to examine the association between 
abortion safety and abortion-related mortality, we did a 
secondary analysis to calculate subregional case fatality 
rates. We computed case fatality rates using available 
information about the proportion of maternal deaths that 
were due to abortion for the period of 2003–09, the latest 
period for which such data were available; 2012 estimates 
of the number of maternal deaths; and estimates of 
abortion incidence for the period of 2010–14.2,11,16 We 
examined the subregional distribution of unsafe abortion 
and case fatality.

categories (further details of the model are provided in the 
appendix). The statistical model included two hierarchical 
regression submodels: one for estimation of the proportion 
of safe abortions and one for division of the remaining 
unsafe abortions into two categories of less safe and least 
safe. The two submodels combined provided estimates for 
the three safety categories.
In the first regression submodel, the logit-transformed 
probability of a safe abortion was estimated with a country-
specific intercept and the (regression-coefficient) weighted 
sum of the predictors of abortion safety. The model was 
fitted to the country-specific data on the proportion of 
abortions that was considered safe. Country intercepts 
were estimated with a hierarchical model based on 
regional groupings (ie, to represent geographical regions), 
such that intercepts for countries with no or uncertain 
data were informed by estimates for other countries in the 
region. Similarly, in the second reg 
ression submodel, 
we used a model with country-specific intercepts and 
covariates to estimate the proportion of unsafe abortions 
that were less safe and those that were least safe.
We created progressively increasing uncertainty levels 
on the basis of our confidence in the different data sources 
(from most confident to least confident): national data 
with categorisation based on methods of abortion, national 
data with categorisation based on providers, national data 
with categorisation based on setting, and subnational data 
with categorisation based on any of these factors.
Based on the theoretical framework, we included four 
covariates (registration of mifepristone, registration of 
misoprostol, proportion of the population living in urban 
areas, and the GII) in the model. We explored whether 
covariates referring to the legal grounds for abortion and 
the GNI improved model fit. We used an initial in-sample 
measure of goodness of fit to assess model performance 
and out-of-sample validation exercises to select the final 
model from among the models of best fit that fulfilled 
both conceptual and statistical criteria (appendix). Given 
the similar validation results across models, we selected 
the most parsimonious model for use in this study.
We estimated the posterior distributions of the out-
comes of interest with a Markov chain Monte Carlo

Results
We included 150 pieces of empirical data from 
61 countries (figure 2), including 131 (87%) pieces of 
national-level data. Empirical data were available for 
23 (54%) of 43 developed countries and for 38 (27%) of 
139 developing countries (appendix). Data came from 
routinely collected national statistics on reported 
abortions (23 countries), from Demographic and Health 
Surveys and Reproductive Health Surveys (including 
data on women’s reports of abortion care-seeking; 
15 countries), and from national and subnational studies 
(24 countries).
During 2010–14, 55 ·7 million abortions occurred 
annually worldwide, of which 30·6 million (54·9%, 
90% UI 49·9–59·4) were safe. Almost all abortions in 
developed countries (87·5%, 81·9–89·6), and roughly 
half of those in developing countries (50·5%, 45·2–55·9), 
were safe (table 1).
We estimated that 17 ·1 million (30·7%, 90% UI 
25·5–35·6) abortions worldwide for 2010–14 were less safe 
and that 8·0 million (14·4%, 11·5–18·1) abortions were 
least safe. Thus, combining the less-safe and least-safe 
categories, 25·1 million (45·1%, 40·6–50·1) abortions were 
done in unsafe circumstances each year (table 1, figure 3).
The distribution of abortions across safety categories 
was similar across developed subregions, with the 
exception of eastern Europe, where the proportion of safe 
abortions was marginally lower than for other subregions 
in Europe (figure 4). Among developing regions, eastern 
Asia (including China) had a safety distribution similar to 
that of developed countries. Only in three other developing 
subregions (southeastern Asia, western Asia, and 
southern Africa) did the proportion of safe abortions 
exceed 50%. Other than for southern Africa, the proportion 
of safe abortions was 25% or less in all of Africa and 
throughout Latin America. However, in Latin America, 
most unsafe abortions were categorised as less safe, 
whereas, in Africa, almost all unsafe abortions were 
categorised as least safe. The highest proportion of least-
safe abortions occurred in middle Africa, followed by 
western Africa and eastern Africa.
Given that the number of abortions in the subregions of 
Micronesia, Polynesia, and Melanesia were small, we did 
not separate Oceania into its subregions. Thus, the results 
for Oceania reflected a mix of safety scenarios. When the 
Australia–New Zealand subregion was considered on its 
own, 92·3% (90% UI 89·3–95·4; data not shown) of 
abortions were safe, similar to the pattern in other 
developed regions.
When the distribution of abortion safety was considered 
by the legal status of abortion, 87·4% (90% UI 79·2–92·0) 
of all abortions in the 57 countries in which abortion was 
available on request were safe compared with 25·2% 
(14·5–41·0) in the 62 countries where abortion was 
completely banned or allowed only to save the woman’s life 
or to preserve her physical health (table 2, figure 5). In such 
legally restrictive settings, nearly a third of abortions 
(31·3%, 90% UI 21·0–41·9) were categorised as least safe. 
A direct association was also seen between abortion safety 
and country income level; most abortions in upper-middle-
income countries (67·1%, 58·7–75·7) and high-income 
countries (82·2%, 75·8–85·7) were safe compared with 
about one in five abortions (21·8%, 17·4–30·7) in low-
income countries (table 2, figure 6). The proportion of 
abortions that were least safe was also significantly higher 
in developing countries with the most restrictive laws than 
in developed countries with similarly restrictive laws 
(31·3% vs 0·3%; data not shown).
No clear association was observed between the 
incidence of abortion in UN DESA subregions and the 
distribution of safe abortions. However, the three regions 
with incidences of fewer than 30 per 1000 women 
(northern America, northern Europe, and western

Europe) also had the highest proportions of safe abortions 
(figure 7). Similarly, no clear association was observed 
between the proportions of unsafe abortions by subregion 
and case fatality rates (data not shown). However, an 
association was seen between the proportions of least-
safe abortions by subregion and the case fatality rates; 
most subregions with a high proportion of least-safe 
abortions had high case fatality rates (figure 8).
Discussion
The results showed a disparity in abortion safety between 
developed and developing regions. In 2010–14, almost all 
abortions in developed countries were safe, although a 
small proportion of less-safe abortions was also seen—
notably in eastern Europe—probably due to the persistence 
of outdated medical practices such as sharp curettage. In 
eastern Europe, as in many parts of Asia, development of 
evidence-based national standards and guidelines and 
training of providers could result in substantial 
improvements in the safety and quality of abortion care.
The subregions with the highest proportions of safe 
abortions (northern Europe and northern America) also 
showed the lowest incidence of abortion. Most countries 
in these two subregions have less restrictive laws on 
abortion, high contraceptive use, high economic 
development, high levels of gender equality, and well 
developed 
health 
infrastructures, 
suggesting 
that 
achievement of both low incidence of abortion and high 
safety in such contexts is possible.
Although eastern Asia was similar to developed regions, 
fewer than one in two abortions in south-central Asia and 
about one in four abortions in Africa were safe. Most 
abortions in Africa were characterised as least safe, 
suggesting that use of dangerous invasive methods by 
untrained individuals is common. Although the estimates 
of case fatality rates should be interpreted with caution 
because they were calculated with information from 
several different estimates and various time periods, our 
results suggested that the subregions with the highest 
proportions of least-safe abortions also had the highest 
case fatality rates. This finding might be due to the more 
serious complications arising from least-safe abortions 
and the poor health infrastructure to treat complications 
when they occur. Multifaceted interventions addressing 
legal, policy, and health system barriers; health-worker 
shortages; provider attitudes; gender inequality; and 
abortion stigma are needed.
Only about one in four abortions in Latin America were 
safe, although most unsafe abortions were categorised as 
less safe, reflecting the transition of use of dangerous 
methods to use of misoprostol outside formal health 
systems in this region.19 Such abortions might result in 
fewer complications than abortions done using dangerous 
methods, as shown by the lower case fatality rates in 
regions with a high proportion of less-safe abortions than 
in regions with a high proportion of least-safe abortions. 
However, these regions also have better functioning health 
systems and better access to care to treat complications 
when they occur. Self-management of medical abortion in 
early pregnancy is an evidence-based option in WHO 
guidelines,6 however the use of misoprostol outside of the 
formal health system, often without access to appropriate 
information and a trained health-care worker if needed,

does not represent a standard of care, but rather an absence 
of safe options. Thus, despite lower case fatality rates, these 
abortions are considered less safe and structured health 
systems interventions that address access to information, 
medications, and support to women are needed.
The analysis showed a positive association between safe 
abortions and less restrictive laws. Such laws might 
promote an enabling environment for trained providers 
and improve access to safe methods. The highest 
proportions of safe abortion were seen in developed 
countries with less restrictive laws, suggesting that both 
the legal grounds and overall development of a country 
have a part in abortion safety.
Scarcity of data for the period before 2010–14 did not 
allow for a trend analysis with this model. Comparisons 
with previously published estimates of the proportions of 
safe and unsafe abortions cannot and should not be made 
because the theoretical framework, the data used, and the 
analytical approaches are different.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to 
align the measurement of abortion safety with WHO’s 
definition4 of unsafe abortion and to link the categorisation 
of safety to current technical standards in WHO 
guidelines.5,6 Furthermore, the three-tiered classification 
allowed for a more nuanced gradation of safety that 
distinguished the least-safe abortions from other types of 
unsafe abortion. The use of a model-based approach 
resulted in a systematic consideration of multiple factors 
that affect the conditions under which abortions take 
place and allowed, for the first time, the construction of 
uncertainty bounds around the estimates.
The analysis had several limitations due to the paucity 
of data. Empirical data in the model were scarce, 
particularly from countries where abortion was legally 
restricted and stigma was likely to be common. Data on 
abortion are likely to be under-reported or misclassified 
and, even in countries where abortion is legally available, 
the increasing privatisation of abortion care and a shift 
towards outpatient services with medication pose new 
challenges to the representativeness of data collected 
through health systems.20–22 Variations in outcome 
definitions and reporting made it difficult to standardise 
data inputs.
We were also unable to fully represent all the conceptual 
domains in the statistical model because systematic, 
standardised data on covariates representing some 
domains did not exist. Information about the extent to 
which misoprostol was used in countries where abortion 
access was restricted was largely anecdotal, misoprostol-
sales data collected by the pharmaceutical industry were 
not available for all countries, and misoprostol 
regulations within countries did not necessarily correlate 
with actual availability and sales in the formal and 
informal markets. Stigma related to both seeking and 
provision of abortion is increasingly recognised as having 
an effect on how and where women access care and who 
is willing to provide care.7 Although the GII was used as 
a partial proxy of abortion stigma, more direct measures 
do not exist. The possibility of prosecution for seeking an

abortion might also lead women to unsafe options; 
however, we were unable to quantify this risk for use as a 
covariate. Additionally, although abortions in both the 
first trimester and later are safe if done according to 
WHO standards, the risk of complications does increase 
with increasing duration of pregnancy.23 However, we 
were unable to account for this in the model because of 
data constraints.
Innovative research to address these gaps is urgently 
needed, especially in contexts where many abortions 
occur outside formal health systems.23–25 Where legal 
grounds for provision of an abortion exist, increased 
commitment to collection and standardised reporting of 
routine data with monitoring indicators recommended 
by WHO are needed.5 Improvements in data would 
also allow future estimates to be disaggregated to the 
country level; for inequalities related to age, marital 
status, and economic conditions to be examined; and for 
national-level progress in increasing access to safe 
abortion to become visible.
In conclusion, this analysis suggested that unsafe 
abortion is still a major problem in developing countries 
and that progress towards safer abortion is needed, even 
in some developed countries. Although efforts to increase 
the availability, accessibility, and affordability of con-
traception can reduce the incidence of unintended 
pregnancies and, therefore, abortions,11 it is essential to 
combine this strategy with interventions to ensure access 
to safe abortion. Both strategies are needed to eliminate 
unsafe abortion and to fulfil the global commitment to 
the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to 
sexual and reproductive health.26
