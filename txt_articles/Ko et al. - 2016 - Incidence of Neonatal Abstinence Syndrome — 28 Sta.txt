Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a postnatal drug 
withdrawal syndrome that occurs primarily among opioid-
exposed infants shortly after birth, often manifested by central 
nervous system irritability, autonomic overreactivity, and 
gastrointestinal tract dysfunction (1). During 2000–2012, the 
incidence of NAS in the United States significantly increased 
(2,3). Several recent publications have provided national 
estimates of NAS (2,3); however, data describing incidence at 
the state level are limited. CDC examined state trends in NAS 
incidence using all-payer, hospital inpatient delivery discharges 
compiled in the State Inpatient Databases of the Healthcare 
Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) during 1999–2013. 
Among 28 states with publicly available data in HCUP dur-
ing 1999–2013, the overall NAS incidence increased 300%, 
from 1.5 per 1,000 hospital births in 1999, to 6.0 per 1,000 
hospital births in 2013. During the study period, significant 
increases in NAS incidence occurred in 25 of 27 states with at 
least 3 years of data, with annual incidence rate changes rang-
ing from 0.05 (Hawaii) to 3.6 (Vermont) per 1,000 births. In 
2013, NAS incidence ranged from 0.7 cases per 1,000 hospital 
births (Hawaii) to 33.4 cases per 1,000 hospital births (West 
Virginia). The findings underscore the importance of state-
based public health programs to prevent unnecessary opioid 
use and to treat substance use disorders during pregnancy, as 
well as decrease the incidence of NAS.
NAS is a postnatal withdrawal syndrome that comprises 
a constellation of symptoms in newborns, including central 
nervous system irritability (e.g., tremors, increased muscle tone, 
high-pitched crying, and seizures), gastrointestinal dysfunction 
(e.g., feeding difficulties), and temperature instability (1). 
Although other substances have been implicated, NAS is most 
often attributed to in utero opioid exposure. This exposure 
can result from maternal prescription opioid use, which has 
increased nationally in recent years (2,4), nonmedical opioid 
use, or medication-assisted treatment, which is long-term 
treatment with a longer acting but less euphoric opioid under 
medical supervision for opioid use disorder. Data on long-term 
developmental outcomes related to opioid exposure during 
pregnancy and NAS are limited.
The State Inpatient Databases include de-identified admin-
istrative data from all hospital inpatient discharges in a given 
state, regardless of payer. Data from State Inpatient Databases 
are compiled by state partners and then translated into a 
uniform format as part of HCUP
, which is sponsored by the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This analysis 
includes data from 28 states* whose data for 1999–2013 
were publicly available on HCUP’s online central distribu-
tor (https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/centdist.jsp). 
Consistent with previous methodology (2,3), in-hospital births 
were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 
V30.X–V39.X ending in 00 or 01 (indicating single or multiple 
live born infants), among all hospital discharge records during 
1999–2013. Discharge records that did not have a principal or 
secondary diagnosis code indicating a hospital birth, or that 
indicated a transfer from another acute care hospital or health 
care facility, were excluded. Cases of NAS were identified 
with ICD-9-CM code 779.5 (drug withdrawal syndrome in a 
newborn). Cases of possible iatrogenic withdrawal, resulting 
from complications related to prolonged neonatal intensive care 
stay and not exposure during the antenatal period (ICD-9-CM 
codes: 765.01–765.05, 770.7, 772.1X, 779.7, 777.5X, 777.6), 
were excluded from the numerator.
Total incidence rates of NAS (cases per 1,000 births) were 
calculated for 1999 and 2013, using data available from 14 
and 21 states, respectively. In addition, incidence rates of NAS 
were calculated for each state and year with available data 
during 1999–2013. Linear trends were assessed using logistic 
regression with NAS incidence as the outcome variable and 
infant birth year as the independent variable for the 27 states 
with at least 3 years of data. Annual incidence rate changes, 
which reflect average annual change in the incidence rate of 
NAS over time, were calculated from the beta coefficient of 
the infant’s birth year with a state-specific intercept for states 
with significant linear trends. P-values <0.05 were considered 
to be statistically significant.
During 1999–2013, among 29,944,574 hospital births that 
occurred in the 28 states included in this report, 74,576 NAS 
cases occurred, reflecting an overall incidence rate of 2.5 cases per 
1,000 hospital births. In 1999 (the first year), 2,419 NAS cases 
were identified among 1,610,733 births in 14 reporting states 
(1.5 per 1,000 births). In 2013, 8,270 NAS cases were identi-
fied among 1,385,371 births in 21 states (6.0 per 1,000 births). 
Data for at least 5 consecutive years were available for 
27 states (Table). In 1999, NAS incidence ranged from

0.3 per 1,000 births in Iowa to 7.6 per 1,000 births in 
Maryland. In 2013, NAS incidence ranged from 0.7 per 1,000 
births in Hawaii to 33.4 per 1,000 births in West Virginia. 
During 2012–2013, three of 25 states (Maine, Vermont, and 
West Virginia), reported NAS incidence rates >30 per 1,000 
hospital births (Figure). From 1999 to 2013, the incidence of 
NAS significantly increased in 25 of the 27 states with at least 
3 years of data included in this report (Table). NAS incidence 
rates did not change significantly in California and South 
Dakota during 1999–2013. The annual incidence rate change 
over 1999–2013 was lowest in Hawaii (0.05 per 1,000 births) 
and highest in Vermont (3.6 per 1,000 births).
Discussion
The overall incidence of NAS in the states included in this 
report has increased almost 300% during 1999–2013, from 
1.5 to 6.0 cases per 1,000 hospital births. This increase in NAS 
incidence is consistent with that reported by other studies,

which have described a national increase in incidence of 383% 
(from 1.2 cases per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 5.8 cases 
per 1,000 hospital births in 2012)(2,3). Substantial variation 
in NAS incidence and trends by state exist, with incidences in 
2013 ranging from 0.7 (Hawaii) to 33.4 per 1,000 births (West 
Virginia). Differences in NAS incidence might be caused by 
variations across states in opioid prescribing rates (5), prevalence 
of illicit opioid use, or use of the ICD-9 code that identifies NAS.
State governments partially finance and fully administer 
Medicaid programs, direct block-grant funds relevant to treat-
ment of substance use disorders and maternal and child health 
programs, and license health care professionals. Previous research 
indicates that Medicaid programs were financially responsible 
for approximately 80% of the estimated $1.5 billion in NAS-
related annual hospital charges in 2012 (3). Taken together, 
these factors make state-specific NAS estimates important to 
the formulation of public health plans to improve the health of 
mothers and infants affected by opioid use.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. 
First, the State Inpatient Databases include de-identified admin-
istrative data, and counts of NAS cases are based on information 
collected at the delivery hospitalization. In this analysis, only 
cases at the originating hospitals were counted. Cases identified 
as transfers from another hospital were not counted, to minimize 
possible duplication of counts and thus, overreporting of infants 
with NAS who might need a higher level of care. However, these 
rates are likely underestimates, as hospital administrative data iden-
tify fewer cases of NAS than does clinical reporting (6). Second, 
these estimates are not generalizable to births that occur outside of 
the hospital; however, out-of-hospital deliveries represented only 
1.5% of births in 2014 (7). Third, although statistically significant 
annual changes in incidence rates were observed, these changes 
might not represent large increases in actual numbers of affected 
infants, depending on the birth population in each state. Finally, 
data are not generalizable to the entire United States, but only to 
the 28 states included in this report.
Primary prevention measures are important in curbing the 
incidence of NAS. In 2016, CDC released the Guideline for 
Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, which recommends that 
clinicians 1) consider nonopioid pharmacologic therapy for 
chronic pain management, 2) discuss family planning and how 
long-term opioid use might affect future pregnancies before 
initiating opioid therapy in reproductive-aged women, and 
3) prescribe the lowest effective dose when opioids are started 
(8). Individual states have implemented strategies to address 
the opioid epidemic and NAS. Prescription drug monitoring 
programs are operational or will be implemented in 49 states 
and the District of Columbia (www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/
pdmp) to track prescribing and dispensing of controlled pre-
scription drugs; these programs have been shown to reduce 
inappropriate prescribing and overdose deaths (9). In addi-
tion, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee have made 
NAS a reportable condition to state health departments to 
improve public health surveillance. Implementation of this 
type of passive surveillance of NAS can help states success-
fully target prevention and treatment measures, including 
access to medication-assisted treatment, the standard of care 
recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists for pregnant women with opioid use disorders 
(10). As part of the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015,† 
CDC continues to provide technical assistance to states and 
American Indian tribes to improve NAS surveillance and to 
support implementation of effective public health measures.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a postnatal drug 
withdrawal syndrome in newborns caused primarily by in utero 
exposure to opioids. In the United States, the incidence of NAS 
increased 383% during 2000–2012, and an estimated 80% of 
hospital charges for NAS are covered by state Medicaid programs.
What is added by this report?
During 1999–2013, state-specific NAS incidence rates increased 
significantly in 25 of 27 states with at least 3 years of data, with 
annual changes in incidence rates ranging from 0.05 (Hawaii) to 
3.6 (Vermont) per 1,000 hospital births. In 2013, NAS incidence 
ranged from 0.7 (Hawaii) to 33.4 cases (West Virginia) per 1,000 
hospital births.
What are the implications for public health practice? 
Prevention efforts, such as promotion of effective use of 
prescription drug monitoring programs, are needed to reduce 
inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of opioids. Clinicians 
should follow recommended guidelines on appropriate 
prescribing of opioid medications and provide screening and 
treatment for opioid use disorder among pregnant and 
nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Monitoring state-
specific NAS incidence rates is important to ensure that 
adequate treatment and resources exist to address the effects 
of maternal opioid use and NAS within jurisdictions.
