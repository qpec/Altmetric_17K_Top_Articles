SUMMARY
Insufficient sleep is a serious problem in adolescents and school start
time is thought to be a key contributor. This study provided the first
comprehensive assessment of school start times across Canada and
examined whether school start times were associated with sleep duration
and tiredness among adolescents. We collected information on school
start times from 362 schools that participated in the 2013/2014 Health
Behaviour in School-aged Children study. We calculated sleep duration
from weekday bedtime and wake time reported by 29 635 students (aged
10–18 years). We classified weekday sleep as sufficient if it met national
recommendations, and used data on self-reported tiredness at school in
the morning. Random-effects regression models estimated the associ-
ation of school start time with sleep duration, sleep sufficiency and
tiredness. On average, schools started at 08:43 hours. Students slept an
average of 8:36 h on weekdays and 69% met sleep duration recom-
mendations, but 60% reported feeling tired in the morning. Every 10-min
delay in school start time corresponded with 3.2 [95% confidence interval
(CI): 2.0, 4.5] additional minutes of sleep, a 1.6% (95% CI: 0.5, 2.8)
greater probability of sufficient sleep and a 2.1% (95% CI: 1.0, 3.2)
smaller probability of feeling tired at school in the morning. Students from
schools that started later slept longer, were more likely to meet sleep
recommendations and were less likely to report feeling tired in the
morning. The study adds weight to the mounting evidence that delaying
school start time benefits adolescent sleep.
INTRODUCTION
Insufficient sleep is an emerging health problem in North
American adolescents (Basch et al., 2014; Eaton et al.,
2010; Matricciani et al., 2012). The evidence indicates that
at least one-third of adolescents do not meet the minimum
sleep recommendations of 8–9 h (Tremblay et al., 2016) on
weeknights (Basch et al., 2014; Chaput and Janssen, 2016;
Eaton et al., 2010; Gibson et al., 2006), and the majority feel
tired when they go to school in the morning (Chaput and
Janssen, 2016; Gibson et al., 2006). Adolescents that do not
get enough sleep do worse academically (Dewald et al.,
2010), are more likely to develop mental health problems
such as depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts (Baum
et al., 2014; Winsler et al., 2015) and physical health
problems such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure
(Cappuccio et al., 2008; Javaheri et al., 2008), and are more
likely to suffer injuries and become involved in car accidents
(Danner and Phillips, 2008; Milewski et al., 2014). The health
consequences of insufficient sleep impact significantly upon
the educational attainment, work achievement and life
opportunities of young people.
In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics recognized
insufficient sleep in adolescents as a critical public health
issue and identified school start time as a key determinant
(Au et al., 2014). The American Thoracic Society followed
suit in 2015 (Mukherjee et al., 2015). Central to the problem
is a mismatch between adolescent sleep biology and early
school start time. Biological changes during puberty delay the
circadian cycle by up to 2 h, resulting in a natural sleep
period between 23:00 and 08:00 hours or later (Gradisar
et al., 2011). Early school start time is hypothesized to
conflict with the delayed circadian rhythms of adolescents,
resulting in less sleep. Studies from the United States dating
back to 1994 have shown consistently that early school start
times correlate with shorter sleep duration in students

School start times and sleep
 (Wheaton et al., 2016). In response to these findings, and
with pressure from advocacy groups, several American
education institutions changed their school schedules to a
later start time (Owens et al., 2014). In their 2014 policy
statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recom-
mended that middle and high schools delay school start time
to 08:30 hours or later (Au et al., 2014).
The issue of sleep and school start time has received much
less attention in Canada. The Canadian Paediatric Society
has not made a recommendation on school start time,
although talks on the topic were featured for the first time at
the Society’s 2015 annual conference (2015). While some
Canadian schools have recognized the problem and taken
action by delaying school start times (Rushowy, 2011), others
have advanced start time as measure to reduce school
bussing costs (Nolan, 2012; Outhit, 2013). Political discus-
sions may be limited by the lack of knowledge regarding
school start times across Canada and insufficient sleep in the
Canadian context. Most of the evidence is based on
American studies, and may not be applicable to Canada.
For example, cultural and climatological differences between
Canada and the United States may influence sleep patterns
(Gradisar et al., 2011; Walch et al., 2016).
Changing school start time is a complex undertaking that
involves consultation with several stakeholders and consider-
ations of logistic issues (e.g. transportation), human resources
and costs—challenges which have been detailed elsewhere
(Kirby et al., 2011) and that can be overcome successfully
(Owens et al., 2014). A key to this success is timely and
contextually relevant data that can inform dialogue and moti-
vate stakeholders and community members to act. The aim of
the paper is therefore to provide current information on school
start time in a representative sample of Canadian schools and
its association with sleep in Canadian adolescents. We
hypothesized that early school start time would relate to shorter
sleep duration and more tiredness on weekdays.
METHODS
Participants
Data on sleep were collected from the 2013/14 Canadian
Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey.
The HBSC surveyed 30 117 students in grades 6–10 (1320
classes in 367 schools) from all provinces and territories in
Canada. The HBSC selected a cluster sample of students by
grade and school through weighted probability methods in
order to obtain a balanced representation of school popula-
tion characteristics such as religion, community size, school
size and language of instruction. Private schools,1 special
needs schools and schools for youth in custody were
excluded from the survey. The HBSC protocol stipulated a
standard questionnaire format, item order and testing condi-
tions. Teachers or trained interviewers distributed the ques-
tionnaires in classroom settings. The Canadian HBSC was
approved by the Queen’s University General Research
Ethics Board. Consent was obtained from the participating
school boards, individual schools, parents and students.
Student participation was voluntary. For this study, we
excluded students from grades 5 (n = 25), 11 (n = 294)
and 12 (n = 5), as they were not the focus of the HBSC and
survey weights were unavailable, children younger than
10 years (n = 12), as the focus of the study was on
adolescents, and students from three schools where start
time was unavailable because the schools were permanently
closed (n = 132) and from two schools that had no specific
start time (n = 5). The final sample included 29 635 students
between the ages 10 and 18 years from 362 schools.
Measures
The HBSC survey asked students what time in the past week
they usually turned out the lights and went to sleep and what
time they usually awoke on school days and at weekends.
We calculated the average sleep duration from the reported
bedtimes and wake times. This approach correlates highly
with objective sleep measures in children (Matricciani, 2013).
We excluded values greater than 3 standard deviations (SD)
from the mean (school days: n = 408; weekends: n = 406).
Results were unchanged when we included outliers in
sensitivity analyses. We classified children as having a sleep
duration that was sufficient if they met the sleep requirement
based on the 2016 Canadian 24-h Movement Guidelines
(5–13-year-olds: 9–11 h; 14–17-year-olds: 8–10 h) (Tremblay
et al., 2016). Students were also asked how much they
agreed with the statement: ‘I am usually tired when I go to
school in the morning’. We considered students to experi-
ence tiredness when going to school if they ‘agreed’ or
‘strongly agreed’ with this statement.
We defined school start time as the start of the first
morning class. Information was obtained for all schools
through school websites or by contacting school officials
directly.
We further included variables that could confound the
association between school start time and sleep, including
the school grade and family affluence of adolescents and the
neighbourhood characteristics, rurality, latitude and province
of the schools. Family affluence could affect the choice of
school and the associated start time to which students were
exposed. The Family Affluence Scale III (Torsheim et al.,
2016) asks participants to report on six common indicators of
family wealth. Responses were summed (score range: 6–19).
A subsample of school administrators (n = 304) were asked
about seven neighbourhood problems around their school
(racial/ethnic/religious tensions; garbage; drugs or alcohol;
gangs; heavy traffic; crime). We counted the number of items

wick) and 12.6% (Quebec) of school-aged children were
enrolled in private schools in 2013 (Van Pelt et al. 2015).

 reported to be a problem (minor/moderate/major problem
versus no problem) as a proxy for school neighbourhood
conditions that could influence start time. We identified
schools from rural areas based on their alphanumerical
postal code (Post Canada, 2016) and obtained information
on school latitude by geocoding schools using publicly
available
geospatial
data
(http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/
geocoder). We further collected information on potential
effect modifiers of the relationship between school start time
and sleep, including gender, age and grade of participants,
travel time to school (<5, 5–15, 16–30, 31–60 or >60 min,
based on HBSC response categories) and season of survey
(spring: April–June; autumn: September–December; winter:
January–March). Fewer students were surveyed during the
early autumn months (September: n = 0; October: n = 89;
November n = 1334; December: n = 1909; total n = 3332)
than
during
the
winter
(January:
n = 2744;
February:
n = 4715; March: n = 3112; total n = 10 571) and spring
months (April: n = 4483; May: n = 8575; June: n = 2674;
total n = 15 732).
Statistical analysis
We conducted descriptive analyses of the sample. We then
fitted school-level random-effects generalized models of
school start time separately for sleep duration, sleep suffi-
ciency and morning tiredness as outcomes. We used a linear
model for sleep duration and a modified Poisson method for
sleep sufficiency and morning tiredness, because these
outcomes were common (Petersen and Deddens, 2008).
Models were adjusted for grade and family affluence of
participants and geographical characteristics of the schools
(rurality, latitude, province). We modelled school start time
using fractional polynomial modelling to check for non-
linearity. We chose to use the linear term for simplicity, as
results
were
almost
identical
to
fractional
polynomials
(Table S1). We presented the predicted sleep duration (from
the linear model) and predicted probabilities (from the
Poisson models) for the available range of school start time
using the margins commands in Stata. Full information on
covariates was available, except for sleep duration (12%
missing data), morning tiredness (7%) and family affluence
(12%). In sensitivity analysis, missing values were imputed
using multiple imputation by chained equations using the mi
command. Because information on the neighbourhood envi-
ronment of schools was collected from only a subsample of
school administrators, we adjusted for this variable in a
sensitivity analysis. We examined potential effect modifiers of
school start time by testing interaction terms in the main
model using the Wald test, separately for gender, grade, age,
rurality of school, travel time to school and season, and then
estimated the average marginal effect of school start time for
each value of the effect modifier. In additional analyses, we
used bedtime as the outcome in the main regression model
to examine its association with school start time and
calculated the predicted sleep–wake cycle associated with
different school start times. All analyses were weighted using
post-stratification weights to ensure that results were repre-
sentative of public school students in Canada. Statistical
analyses were conducted in Stata (version 14.1; Stata Corp,
College Station, TX, USA). Survey weights and school-level
clustering were handled using Stata’s complex survey (svy)
commands.
RESULTS
The mean school start time was 08:43 hours (SD: 0:17) and
ranged from 07:57 to 09:37 hours. Characteristics of HBSC
participants are presented in Table 1. Students slept an
average of 8:36 h (SD: 1:16) on weeknights, with an
average bedtime of 22:20 hours (SD: 1:08) and wake time
of 06:56 a.m. (SD: 0:39). Approximately two-thirds
of
participants (69%) met the minimum sleep recommendation,
but 60% reported feeling tired when going to school in the
morning. Students went to bed later, woke up later and slept
longer on weekends (Table 1). Sleep characteristics by
potential effect modifiers are presented in Table S2. The
average sleep duration was related inversely to age, grade
and travel time to school. Age and grade related to later

 bedtimes, while travel time to school related to early wake
times. Sleep duration and early bedtimes related to rurality of
the schools and season of survey. No gender differences
were found in sleep patterns.
Table 2 shows predicted sleep duration, probability of
getting sufficient sleep and probability of feeling tired when
going to school in the morning across the range of school
start times in the study (results from the regression models
are available in Tables S3–S5). These analyses suggest that
students who attended a school with an 09:30 hours start
time compared with an 08:30 hours start time slept an
additional 19 min [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.8, 26.7],
had a 7% (95% CI; 2.1, 12.3) higher probability of getting
sufficient sleep (75 versus 67%) and a 7% (95% CI: 3.7, 10.7)
lower probability of feeling tired when going to school in the
morning (61 versus 54%). Every 10 min added to school start
time was associated with 3.2 (95% CI: 2.0, 4.5) additional
minutes of sleep. The findings were robust to imputed values
for missing data (3.3 min, 95% CI: 2.0, 4.5) and remained
after adjusting for school neighbourhood problems (3.4 min,
95% CI: 2.0, 4.8).
Associations between school start times and sleep dura-
tion did not differ significantly by gender, grade, age, rurality,
travel time to school and season (Table 3). However, point
estimates suggested that students in grades 9–10 and
students surveyed in the autumn had the greatest sleep gain
from delayed school start time compared to lower grades and
students surveyed in the winter and spring, respectively,
whereas students from rural areas and students who
travelled for more than an hour to get to school benefited
less from a later start time. In additional analyses, we found
that later school start time was associated with later school
day bedtime (1.9 min for every 10-min delay in school start
time, 95% CI: 0.8, 2.9). The average predicted sleep period
was 22:29–07:23 hours for students who started school at
09:30 a.m. and 22:17–06:52 hours for those who started at
08:30 a.m. (Table S6).
DISCUSSION
This study examined the association between school start
time and adolescent sleep in the Canadian context. Results
from a large representative sample of students show that
insufficient sleep was a common problem in Canadian
students and that approximately one-third did not meet
national sleep recommendations, in similar proportions to the
United States (Basch et al., 2014; Eaton et al., 2010).
Evidence from this study supports the notion that later school
start time is associated significantly with longer sleep
duration and fewer students reporting tiredness going to
school, in line with previous research from the United States,
Australia, Europe and Asia (Short et al., 2013; Wheaton
et al., 2016). Findings suggest that even a small shift in
school start time may have a large impact upon the sleep of
adolescents at the population-level. Later school start times
related to better sleep outcomes regardless of gender, age,
grade, travel time to school, rurality of schools and season.
The average school in the study started at 08:43 hours, much
later than 08:03 hours that was reported recently for schools
in the United States (Wheaton et al., 2015), but results
indicate that delaying start time even further would benefit
adolescents in significant ways.
School start time was associated linearly with sleep
duration in the sample and suggest that each 10-min delay
in start time was associated with an additional 3.2 min of
sleep. Although it is reasonable to assume that the benefits of
delaying school start time will diminish at a certain point, we
found no evidence of a flattening of effect within the range of
start times in the study, which varied from approximately
08:00 to 9:30 hours. Indeed, our analyses suggest that the
latest 09:30 a.m. start time would benefit adolescents the
most by allowing the majority to meet sleep recommenda-
tions. Later school start time was also associated with fewer
students feeling tired when going to school in the morning.
Tiredness could be a reflection of insufficient sleep, but may

 also be attributed to the circadian-mediated lack of alertness
when students are asked to wake and function during times
that conflict with their circadian cycle. This might explain
partly why fewer than one-third of students did not meet sleep
requirements while twice as many (60%) reported being tired
in the morning. In this study, the sleep pattern associated with
an 09:30 hours school start time mapped onto the natural
sleep period of adolescents—typically between 23:00 and
08:00 hours (Gradisar et al., 2011)—better than the sleep
pattern associated with an 08:30 a.m. start time. These
results lend support to the statement from the American
Academy of Pediatrics that schools should aim to start
classes no earlier than 08:30 hours (Au et al., 2014) and to
reports from schools in Canada (Rushowy, 2011) that find
significant benefits from starting class as late as 10:00 hours.
Our study found a delayed bedtime with later school start
times, but that was not enough to offset total sleep gains. In
contrast, previous studies found no association between later
school start time and later bedtime (Lufi et al., 2011; Wolfson
et al., 2007), and some actually found adolescents went to
bed earlier (Owens et al., 2010; Vedaa et al., 2012), although
school start times from these studies were often earlier
(07:30–08:30 hours) than those in this Canadian sample.
The benefits of later school start time on adolescent
sleep extended across different subgroups; however, stu-
dents in grades 9 and 10 seemed to gain more sleep from
later school start time than those in lower grades (6–8). A
similar
effect
modification
by
age
was
not
observed.
Danner and Phillips (2008) also reported greater sleep
gains from a 1-h delay in school start time for students in
higher compared to lower grades (grade range: 9–12).
Additional academic pressure and a heavier homework
load could be factors delaying bedtime for students in
grades 9 and 10, who might therefore gain more sleep from
later school start time compared with lower grades. Rural
students in our sample benefited from later school start
times less than non-rural students. Paksarian et al. (2015)
found similar results for adolescent boys from the US
National Comorbidity Survey. Our results and those of
others (Pereira et al., 2010) suggest that adolescents from
rural areas go to bed earlier and sleep longer than those
from urban areas, supporting an environmental component
to sleep patterns. Students who travelled more than an
hour to get to school woke up earlier and gained less sleep
from later school start time compared to those with shorter
travel
times,
implying
that
transportation
early
in
the
morning might impede sleep gains from later school start
time. Finally, students surveyed in late autumn went to bed
earlier and gained more sleep from delayed school start
time than those surveyed in the winter and spring. The
reduced daylight hours in late autumn are thought to
lengthen the sleep period, resulting in earlier bedtime and
later wake time (Wehr, 1991), which might be accommo-
dated
better
with
later
school
start
time.
The
same
observation can be expected in early winter, but students
surveyed in January might have reported past-week sleep
patterns associated with their winter break (from approxi-
mately 20 December 2013 to 6 January 2014), rather than
with their regular school schedule.
The study is the first, to our knowledge, to provide
information on school start time and its association with
adolescent sleep problems specifically in the Canadian
context. The study is strengthened by data from a large
representative sample of schools and students from across
Canada, use of a random-effects model to account carefully
for the correlation between students from the same school
and sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of the
results. The study also has some limitations. Sleep duration

The marginal predicted mean minutes were estimated from a
school-level random-effect regression model adjusted for grade
and family affluence of participants and geographic characteristics
of the schools (rurality, latitude, province), and weighted using
survey weights. P-value of interaction term estimated from Wald
test.
*The analysis was conducted for ages 11–16 only because other
age groups had small sample sizes (n = 34 for age 10; n = 117 for
age 17; n = 22 for age 18). The regression model excluded grade
to avoid collinearity.

School start time and sleep in Canada

 was estimated from self-reported bedtime and wake time.
Latency in sleep onset and night-time awakenings were not
measured, which may have led to an over-estimation of sleep
duration (Matricciani, 2013). Because the sample included
students from grades 6–10, results may not be generalizable
to
higher
grades.
The
study
was
cross-sectional
and
causality cannot be inferred, although school start time may
be considered largely exogenous to the sleep patterns
of students. Cluster randomized control trials and quasi-
experimental study designs could provide more valid infer-
ences. It is noteworthy, however, that prior studies examining
the influence of policy changes (Danner and Phillips, 2008)
and interventions (Boergers et al., 2014; Vedaa et al., 2012)
have reported results that are consistent with ours.
Insufficient sleep is an important issue among Canadian
adolescents. This study provides evidence that students from
schools that started later slept longer, were more likely to
meet sleep recommendations and fewer were to report
feeling tired in the morning than those from schools that
started earlier. Similar and consistent evidence has been
reported in the United States and elsewhere, and now
extends to Canada. School-based sleep promotion pro-
grammes and other group-based interventions have been
proposed to address sleep problems in adolescents, albeit
with limited effectiveness (Cassoff et al., 2013). The delay of
school start time may be an additional modifiable factor that
has the potential to benefit large groups of adolescents.
Although changes in school schedule are often complex and
challenging (Kirby et al., 2011), policymakers and stakehold-
ers are encouraged to consider delaying the start time of
schools when addressing sleep problems in youth. Future
intervention studies are recommended for specific policy
recommendations.
