Abstract
Background: Communication about physical activity (PA) frames PA and influences what it means to people,
including the role it plays in their lives. To the extent that PA messages can be designed to reflect outcomes that
are relevant to what people most value experiencing and achieving in their daily lives, the more compelling and
effective they will be. Aligned with self-determination theory, this study investigated proximal goals and values that
are salient in everyday life and how they could be leveraged through new messaging to better support PA
participation among women. The present study was designed to examine the nature of women’s daily goals and
priorities and investigate women’s PA beliefs, feelings, and experiences, in order to identify how PA may compete
with or facilitate women’s daily goals and priorities. Preliminary recommendations are proposed for designing new
PA messages that align PA with women’s daily goals and desired experiences to better motivate participation.
Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted with White, Black, and Hispanic/Latina women aged 22–49, stratified
by amount of self-reported PA (29 low active participants, 11 high active participants). Respondents discussed their
goals, values, and daily priorities along with beliefs, feelings about and experiences being physically active. Data
were collected, coded, and analyzed using a thematic analysis strategy to identify emergent themes.
Results: Many of the goals and values that both low and high active participants discussed as desiring and valuing
map on to key principles of self-determination theory. However, the discussions among low active participants
suggested that their beliefs, feelings, experiences, and definitions of PA were in conflict with their proximal goals,
values, and priorities, also undermining their psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
Conclusions: Findings from this study can be used to inform and evaluate new physical activity communication
strategies that leverage more proximal goals, values, and experiences of happiness and success to better motivate
PA among ethnically diverse low active women. Specifically, this research suggests a need to address how women’s
daily goals and desired experiences may undermine PA participation, in addition to framing PA as facilitating rather
than competing with their daily priorities and desired leisure-time experiences.

 Background
Engaging in regular physical activity (PA) is critical for
fostering health and well-being and preventing a variety
of conditions and illnesses including overweight and
obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and several cancers [1, 2].
Women are less physically active than men and as they
age their PA participation decreases [1, 3]. Furthermore,
in the U.S., compared to whites, African American and
Latina women are disproportionately inactive [1] and at
greater risk of many chronic illnesses [4]. Thus, a public
health priority is to increase and maintain levels of PA
over the life course among ethnically diverse women. PA
public health messaging and social marketing frame phys-
ical activity and influence what it means to people, includ-
ing their PA beliefs, perceptions, and definitions and the
role it plays in their lives [5].
To date most messages promoting PA—from public
service announcements to patient-provider communica-
tion to apps—have been developed based on the as-
sumptions that (a) people value their health and (b) this
value is compelling enough to motivate daily decisions
and behavior. These messages have framed health behav-
iors like PA primarily as a means to achieve health-
related goals such as weight loss, disease prevention, and
healthy aging [6]. In fact, individuals frequently report
being active specifically to achieve better health and dis-
ease prevention goals [7]. However, recent research sug-
gests that the health benefits of PA that are commonly
featured in public health communication and promotion
actually predict less participation than more immediately
experienced emotional benefits from PA such as im-
proved mood and enjoyment [8–10]. Furthermore, des-
pite decades of research on barriers and facilitators of
physical activity, most interventions do not promote in-
creased physical activity that is sustained. Thus, there is
a need to investigate how to make physical activity more
relevant and meaningful so individuals will be more
compelled to sustain it. To the extent that public health
messages can be designed to better reflect people’s daily
priorities and desired experiences the more relevant and
effective such promotions will be [5, 11].
Several behavioral theories address goals and values
but researchers have rarely leveraged these principles to
study and promote health behaviors such as PA. Self-
Determination Theory (SDT), however, is one such the-
ory that uses these principles to investigate health behav-
iors. SDT is a broad theory of human motivation that
addresses the intersection of (1) motivational quality
(i.e., the extent to which individuals engage in behaviors
primarily because of external or internal pressures, a
sense of congruency between the behavior and their
identity, and/or the behavior is inherently valuable in its
own right), (2) the role of the social environment in sup-
porting or thwarting the basic psychological needs that
cultivate higher-quality, internalized motivation, and (3)
the impact of individuals’ goals, priorities, and values in
supporting sustained behavioral engagement [12, 13].
To date, much of the research applying SDT to health
and health behavior change has focused on motivational
quality and the social environment in promoting behav-
ioral initiation and maintenance. This body of research
has demonstrated that when individuals have higher-
quality, internalized motivation for behaviors like PA,
they are more likely to engage in those behaviors, per-
sisting
through
failures,
and
maintaining
behavior
change over time [14–16].
SDT-based interventions have been designed to create
social environments within the intervention context that
facilitate the internalization of motivation by supporting
psychological needs for autonomy (i.e., the need to self-
direct behavior change), competence (i.e., the need to
feel capable of achieving desired outcomes), and related-
ness (i.e., the need to feel that others understand and are
empathetic toward the challenges inherent in behavior
change). Across a range of behaviors including tobacco
cessation, physical activity, weight management, medica-
tion adherence, dietary change, and oral health, SDT-
based interventions have demonstrated efficacy for sup-
porting psychological needs, facilitating internalization
of motivation, and eliciting both short-term and sus-
tained behavior change [17–19].
In general, SDT has identified broad goals and values
relevant to health behavior change (e.g., health, social
connection, image and appearance, fame), and to date a
handful of SDT studies have examined the role of these
broader goals in health behavior [8, 20, 21]. Yet, SDT re-
search has not examined more proximal goals and prior-
ities (e.g., items on the daily “to do” list) that are salient in
everyday life nor how best to leverage these daily goals
and priorities in PA communication strategies to support
behavior change. Thus, there is a need to conduct forma-
tive, qualitative research to explore these issues.
The present qualitative study employed focus groups
designed to (1) examine the nature of women’s goals and
daily priorities and (2) examine women’s beliefs and feel-
ings about and experiences with PA, and how they may
compete with or facilitate their daily goals and priorities.
Based on the findings, we propose preliminary recom-
mendations about how women’s more proximal goals,
priorities, and desired experiences could be integrated
into public health messaging to better foster the intern-
alization of the value of PA and motivate physical activ-
ity among ethnically diverse women.
Methods
Sample and recruitment
Participants were recruited from August to October of
2014 in the greater Washington DC area using fliers,
Segar et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:462 
Page 2 of 13
 Craigslist (i.e., classified advertisements website), news-
paper advertisements, recruiting databases, and web and
social media outlets such as GoogleAds, Facebook adver-
tisements, and blog sites. Interested participants were
screened over the telephone to determine eligibility
based on gender (female only), age (between 20 to 50),
race/ethnicity, and days and minutes of self-reported PA
per week. Minutes of PA was assessed with the ques-
tions, “Physical activity is activity where you move and
increase your heart rate above its resting rate, and in-
cludes things such as using gym equipment, walking,
swimming, or biking. During a typical week, how many
days are you physically active?” and “When you are
physically active, about how many minutes do you spend
being active?” Participants were categorized as ‘low ac-
tive’ if they reported being physically active less than
three times a week or for less than 120 min in a week
and ‘high active’ if they reported more than that. The
sampling strategy over-sampled participants in the low
active category as those are the individuals for whom
public health messaging could be better targeted and for
whom other goals and values may be more salient than
health and/or PA. Because our primary goal was to
understand the beliefs and goals of women who were
not regularly physically active, our criterion for this cut
off was based on past physical activity guidelines (e.g.,
3 days per week) to ensure that these participants were
actually ‘low actives” and not on the cusp of being ‘high
actives.’
We recruited based on race/ethnicity to ensure a more
representative sample, and we further stratified the low
active groups by race/ethnicity because focus groups tend
to yield more candid responses when they are matched on
demographic and other characteristics. Given the small
number of high-active women recruited, these women
participated in one of two groups that were not stratified
by race/ethnicity. Each focus group had 4–7 participants,
with 40 women participating in total (29 low active and 11
high active). Characteristics of participants are presented
in Table 1, stratified by PA level as reported during the
screening. Participants were on average 36 years old with
an average BMI of 30.1. Not surprisingly, high active par-
ticipants had lower mean BMI’s (26.1) than low active par-
ticipants (31.7). Over 95% of participants had at least
some

with

White,

pensated $30 for focus group participation. Each focus
group lasted approximately 90 min.

 Focus groups process
Eight focus groups were held in October 2014. Seven
were held at a focus group test facility in Rockville,
Maryland, and one was held at a church in a Latino
community (Langley Park, MD) in an effort to recruit
Latina women. All focus groups were led by one of three
trained moderators selected to match the ethnicity and
activity levels of each focus group participants. At the
start of each focus group, participants provided informed
consent. Next, participants completed a short question-
naire to record demographic information (i.e., height,
weight, race/ethnicity, and education) and PA levels. PA
was assessed with the items modified from HINTS
measures (i.e., Health Information National Trends
Survey) [22], “In a typical week, how many days do
you do any PA or exercise of at least moderate inten-
sity, such as brisk walking, bicycling at a regular pace,
and swimming at a regular pace?” and “On the days
that you do any PA or exercise of at least moderate
intensity, how long do you typically do these activ-
ities?” Moderators followed a focus group guide and
engaged participants in approximately 90-min discus-
sions. Each focus group was audio-taped (with partici-
pant
permission)
and
transcribed.
The
study
was
approved by The Office for Human Research Protec-
tions #12257.
Focus group guide
The focus group guide aimed to elicit (1) Experiences
from and aspects of daily life that drive happiness
and success; (2) PA beliefs, feelings, and experiences;
and (3) the ways in which PA beliefs, feelings, and
experiences interact with, support, and/or undermine
the drivers of happiness and success. While there are
several different ways to characterize people’s goals
and values, for this study our questions focused on
the immediate goals and priorities related to women’s
daily lives, and operationalized them as the things
that contribute to daily feelings of happiness and suc-
cess. This is consistent with the extant literature that
has characterized these experiences and outcomes as
common core values and goals toward which most
people aspire and are often used by industry to mar-
ket products and services [23–28].
The focus groups started broadly with questions about
what contributes to participants’ happiness (e.g., What
in your life makes you happy? If you could experience
your perfect day, what would it look like?) and success
(e.g., What in your life makes you feel successful?). Fol-
lowing this first set of questions, the moderator inquired
about participants’ PA beliefs, feelings, definitions, and
barriers (e.g., When you think about exercising or being
physically active, what is the first thing that pops into
your mind? What counts as PA?). Participants were also
asked about their prioritization of PA (If you were going
to prioritize exercise/PA in your life, where would it sit
on your list of priorities? Why?).
Analyses
Coding for themes that emerged in the data [29], two in-
vestigators (MS and JT) independently examined the
data to identify commonalities and meaning within each
of the following question areas: Experiences from and
aspects of daily life promoting 1) happiness, 2) success,
and 3) PA beliefs, feelings, definitions, and barriers. The
two coders discussed their perspectives on the meaning
of participants’ comments within each question area
(e.g., ‘Beliefs and Feelings about PA”). Through consen-
sus, they categorized similar comments into micro-level
themes (e.g., negative thoughts about exercise before
going, memories about negative experiences from past
exercise). The micro-themes were then evaluated for po-
tential high-level interconnections and meanings in
order to aggregate them into the final higher-order
themes (e.g., negative affective recall and forecasting)
that are discussed in this paper. This process was itera-
tive and involved moving back and forth between the
raw data and micro-themes multiple times to ensure
that the participants’ experiences were accurately cap-
tured. Any differences between participants in the low
and high active focus groups were also noted during
coding and analysis, and are relayed in the paper.
Results
The results are organized by the question categories
used to collect and analyze data and describe the higher-
order themes within each. The first section reports find-
ings related to what participants reported made them
feel happy. The second section reflects participants’ re-
sponses to what makes them feel successful, and the
third section contains findings related to participants'
PA beliefs, feelings, definitions, and experiences. Al-
though no differences emerged between low active and
high active groups regarding happiness and success there
were some differences regarding PA beliefs, feelings, and
experiences that are noted.
Happiness
Four themes emerged characterizing
women’s daily
sources of happiness: (1) Connecting with others, (2) Be-
ing of service to others, (3) Participating in leisure activ-
ities and hobbies, and 4) Feeling relaxed and free from
daily pressures.
Connecting with others
The connecting with others theme related to relation-
ships and spending time with family, friends, and even
pets.
Discussions

 physically, (e.g., “doing activities with family”), the im-
portance of the relationship itself (e.g., “I am a newly-
wed. Just being married is a total[ly] different experience
for me, it's making me happy”), and the need to feel close
to and connected with others (e.g., “Connecting is very
important. If I don't see my roommates or my boyfriend,
or talk to my mom all day, I feel like something is miss-
ing”). Only one participant mentioned that connecting
online with others through social media was a source of
happiness.
Being of service
Participants reported deriving daily happiness through
the experience of helping and serving others in different
aspects of their lives. Examples included providing for
their families financially or contributing to their chil-
dren’s success (e.g., “What makes me happy on a daily
basis is providing for my family. I love seeing the smile
on their faces [when] I cook”), as well as volunteer work,
and paid work.
Participating in leisure activities and hobbies
Participants mentioned feeling happy when participating
in a variety of leisure activities and hobbies (e.g., shop-
ping, cooking, reading). Some talked about these activ-
ities as a conduit for relaxation while others talked
about them as energizing (e.g., listening to music). In
addition, being physically active was frequently men-
tioned as an enjoyable leisure activity, including walking,
playing volleyball, or working out among high and low
active participants.
Feeling relaxed and free from pressures
When they felt relaxed and free from pressures partici-
pants said they felt happy. They emphasized their need
to relax and recover from their daily demands and busy
lives:
“Getting to just relax. Not worry about time, schedules
or anything, because we are constantly on a schedule.”
Relaxation included specific activities such as taking
naps, meditating, and simply having time off. For ex-
ample, one participant said “unwinding at the end of the
day” makes her happy while another one said “long
weekends make me happy, with no work.” Others noted
alone time as a way to relax: “Probably after all my kids
have gone to school, and I come home and I just have si-
lence for a couple of hours...”
Getting relief from pressures that are associated with
daily roles and responsibilities was a key aspect of relax-
ing. Participants mentioned a perfect day would consist
of waking up late, not worrying about a schedule, and
not having to do their typical daily responsibilities, such
as laundry and cooking.
In sum, happiness appears to be generally derived
from experiences related to spending time in activities
that women autonomously choose to do, especially those
that deliver relaxation and a respite from daily demands,
as well as connecting with others and being of service.
Success
Three themes arose concerning contributors to success:
(1) Contributing to the success and happiness of others,
(2) Accomplishing goals, and (3) Professional achieve-
ment. Across these themes, feelings of success generally
came
from
helping
others
accomplish
their
goals,
accomplishing their own goals, and from seeing the im-
pact of their efforts on others.
Contributing to the success and happiness of others
Respondents discussed contributing to the improvement
of others’ lives, including serving different people, often
their children:
“..that my kids are doing well. One's already graduated
from the university, and he is engaged to be married.
That they are on a good path makes me feel successful.”
Accomplishing goals
Many participants discussed feeling successful through
accomplishing goals, including longer-term goals like
having a family or increased education as well as short-
term goals related to their daily roles:
“…what makes me feel successful would be, daily goals,
like making a list and following through. Even, if it is
simple as getting some fruit at the store.”
Professional achievement
In addition, their own professional achievement was fre-
quently mentioned as leading to feelings of success.
Some participants felt successful because others trust
and depend on them, their work was recognized by
others, or they are achieving goals such as getting good
grades in school. Having sufficient financial resources to
meet basic needs and feel secure was also mentioned:
“One of the things that makes me feel successful is
when all of my needs are met and all of my daughter's
needs are met. Nobody's going hungry, nobody's walking
around naked, and we all got shoes on.”
While in general, experiences from connecting with
others and engaging in preferred or self-selected activ-
ities contributed to daily feelings of happiness, success
seemed to derive from the outcomes of their actions.
In other words, participants felt successful when they
felt competent and effective in their daily roles and re-
sponsibilities, especially making a difference in the
lives of others. Notably, although participants identified
success as coming from accomplishing broader goals,
accomplishing mundane daily goals, like getting what
Segar et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:462 
Page 5 of 13
 they needed at the grocery store, also led to feeling
successful.
Beliefs and feelings about PA
Across the discussions related to PA specifically, five
primary themes emerged: (1) Narrow definitions of PA,
(2) Feeling pressured, (3) Negative affective recall and
forecasting, (4) Positive experiences, and (5) PA is a
lower priority than family and work. Beliefs and feelings
about PA are where the clearest and most consistent
differences
emerged
between
low
and
high
active
participants.
Narrow definitions of PA
When asked “what counts” as PA, low active participants
tended to define PA in ways using a specific and narrow
set of standards that traditional PA recommendations
have used to educate people about PA, such as signs that
they were exerting themselves in high-intensity exercise
(e.g., increased heart rate and/or sweating, or feeling
“like you’re burning something”) and for the “right”
amount of time (e.g., 30 min). Low active participants
also described feeling pressured by these criteria and not
able to achieve them:
“You have to do this at this time, and you have to com-
mit to these hours. You have to do this activity. You have
to be so good. I feel like it's a lot of pressure for me, with
exercise, to perform and do well and commit to that
schedule. I can't commit.”
Women in the low active groups noted that the loca-
tion, cost, and the hassles of parking at a gym were other
barriers to PA, suggesting the belief that PA needs to
occur at specific, formal exercise places like gyms. One
low active participant said that walking her dog was a
barrier to being active, which implied that she did not
believe dog-walking counted as valid PA.
High active women were much less likely to make
comments that were categorized in this theme.
Feeling pressured
In general, low active participants, as well as some partici-
pants in one of the two active groups, expressed that they
were not exercising as much as they should, want to, or
used to. There was a clear sense that they experienced in-
ternal pressures related to the idea of being physically ac-
tive. These participants commonly expressed that they
should or need to engage in PA. Statements reflecting this
pressure were often linked to a desire to obtain appear-
ance, weight, or health benefits. For example:
“I really need to discipline myself and lose the weight
again. It's been fluctuating, going up and down, up and
down.”
Losing weight was more frequently discussed as a way
to improve their appearance than benefit their health.
Both low and high active participants often compared
themselves to smaller women or to the size they used to
be, indicating discrepancies between their current vs.
ideal body weight:
“Before my kids I was size six, size eight. I used to do a
lot of sports. Since we moved to this country, life changed
a little bit for us….I say that's one of the things I want to
work on, on my weight.”
However, striving to lose weight through PA seemed
to be more stressful than motivating, as it was accom-
panied by self-judgment, ambivalence and negativity to-
ward being physically active:
“It makes me really resentful when I'm like, "OK, this is
you. No one has put weight bags on your body. This is ac-
tually your extra weight…when I do exercise now, I have
such a bad attitude.”
Negative affective recall and forecasting
Many low active participants acknowledged some degree
of anticipated negative affect about being physically ac-
tive. Negative affect was anticipated across all phases of
PA: (1) before (e.g., just thinking about exercising was
stressful), (2) during (e.g., feeling self-conscious, cranky,
bored, hot, or sweaty), and (3) following PA (e.g., feeling
soreness, pain, or fatigue). This negativity was apparent
through the language used, such as “dreading” exercise,
feeling “resentful,” and “feeling like you’re going to die by
the end of [an exercise class].” In particular, participants
in the low active groups talked about experiencing phys-
ical discomfort and/or fatigue when they are active, often
because of excess weight:
“I'm not sure because of the age, or because I'm gaining
weight. I feel tired just to think about [going] to the
gym… that is not fun.”
Some low active participants discussed that they didn’t
want to be physically active because it didn’t deliver the
relaxation benefits they desired:
“When I am already tired, you want to go home and
relax, and exercise has nothing to do with relaxation.”
Positive experiences
Although women expressed negative affective associa-
tions with PA—particularly those in the low active
groups—both low and high active participants also noted
positive experiences derived from PA, including factors
that motivated and facilitated PA. Being active with
others was a key ingredient for positive experiences, and
was described as creating a sense of community, making
it more fun, and providing mutual support and account-
ability. One high active participant noted that being ac-
tive with her family is a happiness-generating activity for
everyone:
“Incorporating it in a fun way really helped me out.
[My kids] rode their bikes and I ran behind them. That
Segar et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:462 
Page 6 of 13
 helps big time because it feels like a family. It's good for
me. It's good for them. That has actually got me doing it
pretty much every day…I feel happier. I think my kids
are happier… as much as I am.”
In addition, contextual factors, such as being active
outside on a nice day and/or listening to music, were
noted as enhancing the enjoyment of PA. Some partici-
pants in both groups discussed PA as leading to more
general positive outcomes (e.g., having energy, feeling
motivated, and having sense of accomplishment). Others
noted specific immediately experienced affective rewards
from being active, such as helping to “release stress,”
and providing “inner peace” and “a jolt of energy.”
Interestingly, participants in the low and high active
groups tended to speak of the positive experiential bene-
fits differently. The low active participants talked about
the potential energizing effects of PA as hypothetical in
nature in that they did not seem sufficiently motivated
to seek them out (“I know I would be healthier and prob-
ably happier and less tired if I exercised. Honestly, right
now in my life, I’d rather take a nap.”). In contrast, par-
ticipants in the high active groups described feelings of
success that came from having already completed a
workout (“You feel accomplished… You’re breathing a
little bit better. It seems like you’re standing a little
taller.”)
PA is a lower priority than family and work
Across all focus groups, most reported that their highest
priorities were providing for their family, spending time
with family, work or school, and meeting financial obli-
gations, the very factors they had previously noted as
contributing to their happiness and success:
“If he [spouse/partner] needs something, if they [children]
need something, if my clients need something, all those
things come first....Those things are higher priority.”
As could be expected, the issue of where PA was prior-
itized differed between low and high active focus groups.
Participants in low active groups frequently noted that if
they were physically active it would cut into their family
time. A few even noted feeling guilty or selfish about
taking time away from their families to engage in PA or
“me time”:
“It would be selfish or perceived as selfish if I took the
time and [did] not sit down with my family for the din-
ner time. If I went and did something else and took time
for my exercise class or my routine. It's picking your fam-
ily over time for you.”
Interestingly, among some low active participants,
PA as a means to lose weight or improve health was
discussed as a low priority, while for others, it was
reported as a top priority. However, those who re-
ported PA for weight loss as a high priority tended to
speak about PA using future and conditional language
(e.g., “I would”) or what they did in the past rather
than what they were currently doing. In fact, one low
active participant who was a cancer survivor, noted
that although she engaged in regular PA right after
her diagnosis, she now (five years later) felt guilty
about not taking care of herself or prioritizing PA as
much as she used to. Comments about the health
benefits from being active suggested a gap between
knowing about the health benefits from PA and actu-
ally being motivated by them:
“…[exercising is] a high priority, just because I know
my family history and my genes and all that stuff. It's
there telling me that I should do something, but it's not a
high enough priority for me to actually....[trails off].”
Some participants in high active focus groups reported
that nothing interfered with their PA because it was in-
tegrated into their daily routine. But comments from
other high active participants suggested having a more
flexible mindset about the role of PA within their daily
priorities, noting that some days they will exercise and
some they will not, and “it’s not the end of the world” if
they do not do it on any given day. PA was discussed by
these high active participants as a “middle” priority
(instead of a top one) permitting compromise and flexi-
bility on any given day.
“If we have to spend the long nights [helping] my son
on a homework assignment, the workout needs to go on
the wayside, and so be it….you have give and take…”
It is also important to note what was not discussed
during the conversations about participants’ priorities.
Only one participant in all of the groups spoke about
where she prioritized herself, noting that PA ranks low
because she prioritizes herself at the bottom.
Discussion
This is the first study we know of that qualitatively in-
vestigated women’s more proximal goals, values, and pri-
orities and the ways in which universal goals such as
happiness and success intersect with PA. Many of the
concepts that both low and high active participants dis-
cussed in this study map on to key principles of SDT, al-
though
in
different
ways
for
low
vs.
high
active
participants when it came to PA. Interestingly, SDT’s
posited psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness,
and competence [12] appear to underlie feeling happy
and successful, as well as being intertwined with and in-
fluencing whether physical activity supports or detracts
from happiness and success among participants. The
discussion is organized around 1) happiness and success;
2) PA in relation to happiness and success; and 3) impli-
cations for PA messages and communication strategies.
At the end of this discussion, we propose preliminary
recommendations about how women’s proximal goals,
priorities, and desired experiences could be integrated

 into new PA messages to better foster women internaliz-
ing the value of PA and motivate participation.
Happiness and success
Participants reported feeling happy when they connected
to and were of service to others, were free from daily
pressures, felt relaxed and participated in leisure activ-
ities they chose to do. This finding aligns with SDT’s
contention that autonomy is a primary psychological
need and freedom is a core human value [12, 25]. They
also described success as being due to effectively per-
forming, meeting goals, and accomplishing daily tasks,
suggesting a central need for competence and effectance
in their daily lives, as research has suggested [12, 30, 31].
For both happiness and success, participants described
connecting with and contributing to the lives of others,
reflecting a primary way in which their psychological
needs for relatedness are met [32]. This finding aligns
with research suggesting that relationships constitute a
deeply meaningful and influential aspect of living
[32–34], and that feeling related is a fundamental hu-
man need and a requisite for well-being [12, 35]. Re-
lationships and connecting with others were the only
issues participants reported that fostered both happi-
ness and success.
Physical activity in relation to happiness and success
Interestingly, although both low and high active groups
noted similar factors that contribute to feelings of happi-
ness and success, low active and high active participants
described notably different beliefs and feelings about PA.
High active participants discussed PA as being more
congruent with their goals and values, as research sug-
gests is important for goal attainment [36]. The com-
ments from high active participants also suggested that
PA supports their psychological needs for autonomy
(e.g., flexibility to shift PA to lower priority on days
when other demands are high), competence (e.g., experi-
encing a sense of accomplishment from being physically
active), and relatedness (e.g., viewing PA as a way to
connect and spend time with important others) [12].
Women in the high active groups were less likely to en-
dorse narrow definitions of PA (i.e., as all-or-none prop-
ositions) and have more flexible strategies, which may be
indicative of having more internalized motivation toward
PA [37] and contribute to the successful self-regulation
of health behaviors [18].
In contrast to the high active participants, low active
participants’ PA beliefs, feelings, and experiences ap-
peared to conflict with and be incongruent with the very
goals and experiences that make them feel happy and
successful, in addition to thwarting their autonomy, re-
latedness, and competence. Five specific inconsistencies
between happiness/success and PA were identified and
are highlighted in Fig. 1, and the primary incongruences
are discussed in detail below.
Physical activity does not support connection and family
Whereas connecting with and contributing to the suc-
cess and happiness of others were described as fostering
feelings of happiness and success among participants,
PA was often described by low active participants as be-
ing selfish and taking away from providing for one’s fam-
ily. This perceived cost of being active could be viewed
as thwarting the need for relatedness and likely influ-
ences women’s choice to not engage in PA [27]. While
some participants noted that they felt successful when
they were able to meet their family’s basic needs related
to clothing, food, and shelter, these types of basic sur-
vival needs are often not considered in PA messaging.
When
women
are
concerned
about
meeting
their
family’s needs (basic and otherwise), PA messages that
do not explicitly address these core concerns may make
PA irrelevant to them.
Physical activity undermines how women want to feel
Although many participants described happiness from
experiencing states of relaxation and recovery, they
often described PA as the opposite: requiring high
levels of exertion, thus thwarting their sense of auton-
omy toward being physically active. Participants also
tended to describe PA as leading to energization ra-
ther than the relaxed states they desired. Many low
active
participants
also
anticipated
negative
affect
from being active, such as dread, fatigue, or pain.
This negativity is likely very influential in decisions
not to participate in PA given that anticipated affect
has strong motivational properties [38, 39] and shapes
behavioral choice [40].
Furthermore, whereas participants desired time to be
free from pressures, especially of daily responsibilities
and schedules, low active participants often discussed
feeling pressured by the need to meet the standards of
exertion and duration needed for what they perceived to
be valid PA. PA was perceived by many low active par-
ticipants as a chore, something they should do, and as a
source of guilt that they did not do it, reflecting a con-
trolled, non-optimal form of regulation. Pressured feel-
ings about PA may be further exacerbated by low active
participants’ general view that they should be physically
active in order to lose weight and improve their health
(e.g., introjects), often negatively comparing themselves
to other women and themselves when they were thinner
[37, 41]. Given that women have limited time to partici-
pate in leisure activities [42], PA that is experienced as
pressurizing, associated with poor body image, or gener-
ates negative affect is an unlikely candidate for low ac-
tive women’s cherished “off time” [43]. Nor is it likely to

 motivate the consistent self-regulation needed for sus-
tainable PA [18].
Physical activity criteria make it too hard to successfully
fit in
Participants stated that accomplishing goals led to feel-
ings of success. Yet the narrow ways in which low active
participants defined PA not only pressured them, they
undermined the likelihood of successful feelings from
being physically active because they reported not having
sufficient time or energy to achieve those specific criteria
[42], likely thwarting their need for competence. These
data suggest that the last 20 years of public health mes-
saging about PA may have failed to effectively convey the
value of activities of daily living (e.g., dog-walking, taking
the stairs) and more moderate-intensity PA. Indeed, a
large nationally representative survey showed that less
than 1% of American adults understand the current, more
moderate-level PA recommendations [44].
Implications for PA messages and communication
strategies
These findings offer new insights into specific ways
women’s more proximal goals and priorities can be inte-
grated into physical activity messaging to better foster
the internalization of the value of PA and motivate par-
ticipation among low-active ethnically diverse women.
Supporting other research among women [42], these
findings suggest a need to address the expectations and
pressures that women experience which undermine PA
participation. In addition, new messages should help
women understand that PA can facilitate rather than
compete with their daily roles, priorities, and desired
positive affective experiences [45]. These findings further
suggest the need to expand both the role and definition
of valid PA so women can feel more able and competent
fitting it into their complex lives. The last column in
Fig. 1 highlights specific ways in which PA messages
could become more congruent with women’s daily
goals and values, particularly the experiences from
which they derive a sense of happiness and success.
Below are four overarching preliminary suggestions to
consider in future PA communication research and
evaluation.
Promote PA as a way to connect with others
Connecting with others was the only factor participants
described as facilitating both success and happiness,
suggesting it has potential to be a compelling benefit
from and motivator for PA. This finding is consistent
with research showing that being connected to others
is associated with happiness and meaning [33, 34],
and with SDT’s identification of relatedness as a key
psychological need [12]. Furthermore, being active
with others was specifically noted by participants as
making PA a positive experience. Thus, not only
might being active with others satisfy needs for re-
latedness, research suggests relational motivation is
important for PA [46], especially among women [47].
Interestingly, only one person in all of the focus
groups mentioned feeling happy from connecting with
others online. Given the recent emphasis on using
online communities and social networking to motivate
physical activity [48, 49], it is important to study
whether in-person compared to online connections
have similar or different relational benefits and how
best to leverage these different types of connections
to foster PA motivation and participation.
Reframe PA as congruent with women’s roles and
responsibilities
Low active participants especially reported PA as a low
priority and often felt guilty and selfish about taking
time away from their family duties to be physically
active. Multiple roles and responsibilities combined
with an ethic of care creates role strain, and is a sig-
nificant barrier to PA for women [42]. Therefore,
messaging that emphasizes that time spent in PA can
contribute to, rather than detract from, family and
work responsibilities [50] may help PA be viewed as
facilitating women’s top daily priorities and goals (i.e.,
goal
facilitation)
[51].
In
addition,
messages
that
frame engaging in acts of self-care, like PA, as a way
to better equip women to deal with the various other
demands in their lives (e.g., having more energy for
work, resiliency in the face of challenges) may help
low active women more easily give themselves per-
mission to take time to be physically active [50, 52].
Having messages align PA with women’s most salient
goals and priorities should foster self-congruence and
thus support women better internalizing the value of
being physically active; resulting in more internalized
forms of motivation and greater self-regulatory per-
sistence in the face of barriers [18, 36, 53].
Emphasize PA as a way to generate positive affect
Participants reported wanting experiences that are relax-
ing and time that is free from pressure. Given this, they
might be more likely to view PA as contributing to, ra-
ther than in conflict with, these desired experiences if
they believed that PA will generate positive and restora-
tive experiences [54]. Thus, new PA messages could
provide clearer guidance on self-determined exercise in-
tensity for low active women, recommending that they
start at intensities that generate immediate positive
affect for them. This strategy should make PA more
pleasurable [55], intrinsically motivating [56], and also
support women’s needs for autonomy and choice over
Segar et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:462 
Page 10 of 13
 PA [15], all of which, should increase the likelihood that
they will internalize the value of being physically active
and become more physically active [12, 57–59]. Further-
more, because inactive individuals also tend to anticipate
less positive affect from PA than active individuals [60],
increasing expectations of positive feelings from exercise
is likely to foster greater post-exercise positive affect and
intentions to exercise [54].
In addition, participants in both groups felt generally
pressured about being active, especially in relation to
their current size and desire to lose weight, and to im-
prove their health. Given that motives related to ap-
pearance and weight are associated with greater self-
objectification, controlled regulation, negative affect,
and less participation than non-weight/appearance re-
lated motives [61–63], it might be especially important
for new messages targeting women to reframe the pur-
pose of PA away from weight and appearance to posi-
tive affect and daily well-being [64]. Similar to other
research [65], it is important to note that while partic-
ipants knew about the health benefits from PA, this
knowledge did not actually motivate them to be phys-
ically active.
More effectively communicate a broad continuum of
physical activity
Low active participants defined PA using a narrow set of
criteria that emphasized the need to be active at high in-
tensities and for longer durations that reflected older PA
recommendations (e.g., 45 min). Yet, similar to what has
been found in previous research [42], they reported be-
ing unable to achieve these criteria due to time con-
straints and low energy levels. Furthermore, most did
not discuss or endorse more moderate-level activities of
daily living as valid PA options. These findings suggest a
need for public health communicators to better convey
the
value
of
lifestyle,
lower-intensity,
and
shorter-
duration bouts of activity, especially to women [42].
Thus, messages emphasizing the accumulation of life-
style bouts of movement might make PA feel less like a
competing priority because shorter bouts can be more
seamlessly integrated within the natural spaces that exist
in their daily lives.
Lack
of
competence/self-efficacy
toward
PA
is
a
known barrier to participation among women [66].
Therefore, promoting a broader continuum of PA en-
courages women to move whenever they can and should
foster competence and feelings of success whenever they
participate in any physical movement. In addition, some
participants identified success as coming from accom-
plishing mundane daily goals, such as getting what they
needed at the grocery store. Similarly, helping women
believe in the value of doing small bouts of activity
should foster feelings of success and be self-reinforcing.
This new messaging strategy suggestion also supports
autonomy because it gives women permission to engage
in PA in flexible ways [18] that works for them at any
given moment.
This new message advocating women move more
during the day in shorter, more convenient bouts is
supported by research showing that sitting leads to
the precursors of diseases like diabetes [67] and that
the physiological health benefits of movement quickly
decline [68], underscoring the importance of moving
consistently and frequently throughout the day. If PA
promoters can help low active women learn that
“everything counts,” and that any movement is better
than no movement, they might start to seek out easy-
to-integrate bouts of movement in their daily lives.
This might also help PA become a more automatic
behavior.
Limitations and strengths
Limitations of the study include the small sample
size. However, because there were three times as
many low active as high active participants, the find-
ings about differences between these groups are tenta-
tive and in need of additional support. Despite this,
the discussions suggested that differences existed be-
tween low and high active groups regarding their PA
beliefs, feelings, and definitions. In addition, our study
participants were more highly educated than the gen-
eral population. Future studies can use ethnographic
observations to help identify potential spaces and
windows
of
opportunities
to
move
that
exist
in
women’s days.
This study also has strengths. These data come
from an ethnically diverse sample of women. Further,
this is the first study we know of that has conducted
qualitative research about physical activity within the
context of women’s daily goals, values, and priorities
to identify the ways in which PA supports and/or
thwarts these goals and values. Thus, this is an im-
portant formative step toward understanding how to
develop more compelling and persuasive PA commu-
nication strategies for women.
Conclusions
People’s beliefs, goals, and priorities derive out of culture
norms and are an expression of the self; they strongly in-
fluence people’s daily behavioral choices [12, 30]. Striv-
ing towards goals that are personally meaningful and
self-congruent is associated with high-quality motiv-
ation, persistence in the face of challenges, and well-
being. This study provides interesting new insights about
women’s salient goals, priorities, and desired leisure-time
experiences and the ways in which they support and are
in conflict with being physically active. Interestingly,
Segar et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:462 
Page 11 of 13
 although both low and high active participants noted
similar goals and experiences related to happiness and
success, they described notably different beliefs and feel-
ings about PA. In general, low active participants’ beliefs
and feelings about and definitions of PA reflected the
opposite of and were incongruent with the factors that
delivered happiness and success. PA messages influence
women’s perceptions about what PA means and the role
it
plays
in
their
lives
[5].
Therefore,
rather
than
emphasize the goals public health professionals value,
messages should align PA with the experiences, goals,
and priorities that women care most about [69] in order
to get their attention in the crowded communications
environment [11] and make PA more relevant, pleasur-
able, and easier to integrate into their daily lives [70, 71].
These insights suggest fertile ground to investigate more
strategic and persuasive approaches to communicate
about
PA
in
ways
that
can
better
motivate
the
prioritization of PA participation and improve public
health.
