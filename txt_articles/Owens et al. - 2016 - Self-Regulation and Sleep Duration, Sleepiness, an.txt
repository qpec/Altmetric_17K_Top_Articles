OBJECTIVE: To determine whether shorter school-night sleep duration, greater daytime 
sleepiness, and greater eveningness chronotype were associated with lower self-regulation 
among adolescents.
METHODS: An online survey of 7th- to 12th-grade students in 19 schools in Fairfax County, 
Virginia Public Schools was conducted in 2015. Self-regulation was measured with the 
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, 2nd edition, Screening Self-Report Form. 
Sleep measures included school night-sleep duration (hours between usual bedtime and 
wake time), daytime sleepiness (Sleepiness Scale in the Sleep Habits Survey, tertiles), and 
chronotype (Morningness–Eveningness Scale for Children, continuous score and tertiles). 
Sociodemographic factors and mental health conditions were analyzed as potential 
confounders.
RESULTS: Among 2017 students surveyed, the mean age was 15.0 years (range, 12.1–18.9 
years), and 21.7% slept <7 hours on school nights. In regression models adjusted for 
confounders, there was a significant independent association between self-regulation and 
both chronotype (P < .001) and daytime sleepiness (P < .001) but not sleep duration (P = 
.80). Compared with those in the lowest tertile of daytime sleepiness, those in the highest 
tertile had lower (0.59 SD units; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.71) self-regulation, as did 
those in the eveningness tertile of chronotype compared with those in the morningness 
tertile (0.35 SD units lower; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adolescents, greater daytime sleepiness and greater eveningness 
chronotype were independently associated with lower self-regulation, but shorter sleep 
duration was not. Aspects of sleep other than school-night sleep duration appear to be more 
strongly associated with self-regulation.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Chronic sleep 
loss in adolescents has been linked to impaired self-
regulation and increased risk of adverse health and 
functional outcomes. However, less is known about 
how self-regulation is related to daytime sleepiness 
and circadian phase preference (chronotype).
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among adolescents, daytime 
sleepiness and a more “eveningness” chronotype (ie, 
tendency for later sleep onset and offset and timing 
of activity patterns) are both stronger predictors 
of poor self-regulation than is short nighttime sleep 
duration.

for children’s health, including the 
American Academy of Pediatrics,

Impaired self-regulation may be 1 
mechanism by which insufficient 
sleep leads to adverse effects 
on health and functioning. Self-
regulation is the “act of managing 
cognition and emotion to enable goal-
directed actions such as organizing 
behavior, controlling impulses, and 
solving problems constructively.” 
36 
Three interrelated domains are 
involved in self-regulation: cognitive 
(eg, executive functioning and goal 
setting), emotional (eg, emotional 
awareness and management), and 
behavioral (eg, impulse control and 
delay of gratification). Self-regulation 
is governed by a number of brain 
regions such as the prefrontal cortex, 
amygdala, and ventral striatum, 
which are undergoing profound 
developmental changes during 
adolescence 
37, 
 
38 and whose function 
is adversely affected by insufficient 
sleep. 
39– 
41
Short-term experimental sleep 
manipulation in young children, 
 
42, 
 
43 
school-age children, 
 
44, 
 
45 and 
adolescents46 acutely affects self-
regulation and the performance 
of complex tasks. Although 
impaired self-regulation has also 
been observed in the context of 
“naturalistic” chronic sleep loss, 
on a level experienced by many 
adolescents, there is some evidence 
that the relationship between sleep 
and functional impairments related 
to poor self-regulation involves 
more than insufficient sleep. For 
example, chronotype, or circadian-
based morningness–eveningness 
preference (ie, the tendency to be 
a “morning lark” or “night owl”) is 
another aspect of sleep regulation 
that may independently influence 
self-regulation. A pronounced shift to 
a more evening chronotype coincides 
both with increased age and pubertal 
development in adolescents. 
47 
 
– 
50 
Given that evening types cannot 
easily fall asleep earlier at night and 
must still meet societal demands 
to wake up and function early in 
the morning, this often results in a 
sleep duration that is insufficient to 
meet sleep needs. Moreover, timing 
of activity and alertness patterns 
during the day are also shifted later 
in these people. This misalignment 
of circadian biology and societal 
demands has been called “social jet 
lag.”51, 
 
52 Eveningness is also a risk 
factor in adolescents for a number 
of conditions that have also been 
associated with poor self-regulation: 
emotional and behavioral 
problems, 
 
53 
 
–56 substance abuse, 
 
57 
obesity, 
 
58 health risk behaviors, 
 
52, 
 
59, 
60 
and lower school performance. 
61 
 
– 
64 
These findings suggest that a broader 
conceptualization of deficient sleep in 
adolescents that involves problematic 
timing and duration of sleep may be 
a useful construct in assessment of 
functional outcomes such as impaired 
self-regulation.
Finally, 2 cross-sectional studies 
of adolescents found that self-
regulation was associated with 
daytime sleepiness (an increased 
propensity to fall asleep in 
inappropriate circumstances and 
difficulty maintaining alertness, 
which interferes with activities of 
daily living) but not nighttime sleep 
duration. 
65, 
 
66 However, neither 
study examined the contribution of 
chronotype to self-regulation.
The purpose of this study was to 
determine whether 3 distinct aspects 
of sleep, nighttime sleep duration, 
daytime sleepiness, and chronotype, 
were independently associated with 
self-regulation in a large community-
based sample of middle and high 
school students. We secondarily 
examined the relationship between 
these dimensions of sleep and 3 
domains of self-regulation: cognitive, 
emotional, and behavioral.
METHODS
To determine how nighttime sleep 
duration, daytime sleepiness, and 
chronotype predict self-regulation, 
we used data from an online survey 
of students (grades 7–12) and 
parents, which was conducted 
between March and June 2015 in 
Fairfax County Public Schools. Fairfax 
is the 11th largest school district in 
the United States, serving a diverse 
community in the northern Virginia 
suburbs of Washington, District of 
Columbia.
Survey Design
The survey was made available to 
all students (and their parents) 
in 19 schools: 8 of 23 middle 
schools (grades 7–8), 8 of 24 high 
schools (grades 9–12), and all 3 
secondary schools (grades 7–12). 
The 19 schools were selected to 
be representative of the entire 
district with regard to student race 
and ethnicity and family income. 
The survey design addressed the 
need to protect class time (no 
in-class administration), minimize 
disruptions (no direct e-mail or 
cell phone contact with students 
by the research team), and obtain 
parent consent. Parents (or primary 
caregivers) at each of the study 
schools received an initial invitation 
to participate in the study via a 
district-sponsored e-mail, followed 
by 3 reminders. Parents were asked 
to grant electronic consent for their 
child to participate and to complete 
an online parent survey. Students 
with parental consent were sent a 
link via e-mail to a separate online 
student survey. Upon completion of

the survey, students were given a $5 
gift card to Amazon.
We received 2020 complete student 
surveys from the ∼34 800 students 
enrolled in the 19 schools (6%). We 
excluded from our analysis 1 student 
age <12.0 years and 2 students >19.0 
years, leaving a final sample of 2017 
students. Compared with the overall 
population of students in grades 7 to 
12 in the district, those in our sample 
were more often non-Hispanic white 
(60.7% vs 42.1%) and less often 
receiving free or reduced-price 
school meals (8.1% vs 27.4%). Study 
procedures were approved by the 
school district’s Research Screening 
Committee and the institutional 
review boards at the Children’s 
National Medical Center and Temple 
University.
Self-Regulation
Self-regulation, our study outcome, 
was measured with the validated 
Behavior Rating Inventory of 
Executive Function, second edition, 
Screening Self-Report Form, 
consisting of 12 statements about 
behaviors. 
67 Students were asked 
whether they “had problems with 
these behaviors over the last 6 
months” and were given the response 
options of “never” (1), “sometimes” 
(2), or “often” (3). In addition to a 
total self-regulation score (Executive 
Function Screening score), 3 
distinct subscores were generated: 
cognitive self-regulation, which 
has 6 items dealing with the facets 
of working memory (eg, “I forget 
instructions easily”), task completion 
(eg, “I have difficulty finishing a 
task on my own”), and planning or 
organizing (eg, “I don’t plan ahead 
for school assignments”); emotional 
self-regulation, which has 4 items 
dealing with the facets of shifts (eg, 
“It bothers me when I have to deal 
with changes”) and control (eg, “I 
get upset over small events”); and 
behavioral, which has 2 items dealing 
with the facet of inhibition (eg, “I 
am impulsive”). 
67 Item scores were 
reverse-coded so that higher scores 
reflected greater self-regulation. The 
total score and the 3 subscores, each 
with a possible range from 1 to 3, 
were calculated by adding across the 
constituent items and dividing by 
the number of items. In our sample, 
the internal consistency measures 
(Cronbach’s α) of the total score 
and the cognitive, emotional, and 
behavioral subscores were 0.85, 0.80, 
0.71, and 0.65, respectively. The total 
self-regulation score and 3 subscores 
had statistically normal distributions.
Sleep Duration
Nighttime sleep duration on school 
nights was calculated from student 
responses to separate questions 
about usual bedtime on school 
nights and wake time on school days. 
Sleep duration was calculated as the 
difference in hours between these 
times after we excluded 27 cases 
with either implausible bedtimes 
(<7 PM or >3 AM), wake times (<3 AM or 
>8:30 AM), or calculated duration (<4 
or >12 hours). Sleep duration (hours) 
had a statistically normal distribution 
and was used in our primary analysis 
as a continuous variable.
Chronotype
Chronotype was assessed with the 
10-item Morningness–Eveningness 
Scale for Children. 
50 The scale, 
adapted from circadian rhythm 
questionnaires for adults, 
 
68 
– 
70 is 
designed to assess the phase of 
the day, on a continuum from 
morningness to eveningness, in 
which adolescents prefer to engage 
in various cognitive and physical 
activities. The scale generates 
possible scores from 10 to 43, with 
higher scores indicating greater 
morningness. In our sample, the 
Cronbach’s α of the scale was 
0.79. The chronotype scores had a 
statistically normal distribution, and 
the score was used in our primary 
analysis as a continuous variable. 
There are no established cutoff 
points for defining morningness 
or eveningness on this scale.71 
To facilitate the interpretation of 
our findings, additional analyses 
were conducted with the scores 
divided into tertiles: morningness 
(>28), intermediate (25–28), and 
eveningness (<25).
Daytime Sleepiness
Self-reported daytime sleepiness was 
assessed with a modified version of 
the 10-item Sleepiness Scale in the 
Sleep Habits Survey. 
72 
– 
74 Students 
were asked whether, during the 
last 2 weeks, they had “struggled to 
stay awake or fallen asleep” in 10 
situations. We replaced 2 situations 
(“traveling in a bus, train, plane or 
car” and “attending a performance”) 
with 2 others (“during a study hall 
or free period” and “during lunch 
at school”). Our modified response 
options were “never” (0), “Yes, I 
struggled to stay awake” (1), and 
“Yes, I fell asleep” (2). Students could 
also indicate that the situation did 
not apply to them during the last 2 
weeks. A total possible score between 
0 and 2 was calculated by summing 
across the items (situations) and 
dividing the number of items and 
situations that applied to the student. 
Higher sleepiness scores meant 
greater daytime sleepiness. The 
Cronbach’s α of the modified scale 
was 0.77. Responses on the scale 
were skewed toward low sleepiness, 
with 28.1% scoring 0 (never sleepy 
during any of the situations). 
Therefore, scores were divided into 3 
tertiles of sleepiness: low (0 to ≤0.1), 
medium (>0.1 to <0.4), and high 
(≥0.4).
Covariates
Data were obtained on potential 
confounding variables from the 
student survey, the parent survey, 
and electronic administrative records 
from the school district. Students 
reported their race and Hispanic 
ethnicity in separate questions. These 
data were merged into a 5-category 
race/ethnicity variable. Those 
3

OWENS et al 
reporting >1 race were placed in the 
“other” category, and those reporting 
Hispanic ethnicity, regardless of 
race designation, were classified as 
Hispanic. Students also reported 
whether they had any “disabilities 
or chronic illnesses, 
” including 2 
mental health conditions: depression 
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder. Students could also name 
other disabilities or chronic illnesses. 
Those naming anxiety disorders (eg, 
posttraumatic stress disorder) or 
other mood disorders (eg, bipolar 
disorder) were grouped, along with 
those reporting depression, into a 
single group called “anxiety and/
or mood disorder.” Each parent 
respondent provided information on 
his or her own educational level and 
that of his or her spouse or partner. 
The school district provided data 
(yes/no) on student qualification for 
free or reduced-price school meals 
(household income ≤185% of the 
federal poverty guideline 
75), sex, and 
birth date (used to calculate age).
Data Analysis
Correlation coefficients were used 
to examine bivariate relationships 
between the 3 exposures 
(sleep duration, sleepiness, and 
chronotype). Each self-regulation 
measure was used as a dependent 
variable in multivariable linear 
regression analyses. Missing data 
were imputed for all study variables, 
and no systematic patterns of missing 
data were identified. 
76 In Stata (Stata 
Corp, College Station, TX), 
 
77 we used 
sequential regression imputation 
78 
to create 20 imputed data sets, each 
with 2017 cases. 
79 Our imputation 
model included all 7 covariates, along 
with the self-regulation outcomes 
and key exposures (sleep duration, 
sleepiness, and chronotype). We 
then ran linear regression models 
on the imputed data sets, and the 
reported model parameters were 
aggregated across data sets.80 All 
3 sleep variables were examined 
together in each model to determine 
their independent association 
with self-regulation, both with and 
without adjustment for all covariates. 
In models containing all covariates, 
we evaluated 2-way and 3-way 
interactions between the 3 sleep 
variables and between age and each 
sleep variable. Because multiple 
interactions were evaluated for each 
self-regulation outcome, a P value of 
<.01 was considered a statistically 
significant interaction.
RESULTS
The mean age of the 2017 students 
was 15.0 (range 12.1–18.9) years, 
and 54.4% were in grades 9 to 12. 
Nearly 90% of students had at least 
1 parent or primary caregiver who 
had completed college, and <10% 
qualified for free or reduced-price 
school meals ( 
Table 1). In contrast 
to the 2016 American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine consensus 
recommendations for optimal sleep 
duration in 13-18 year olds (8-10 
hours), 
 
81 21.7% reported a usual 
school-night sleep duration <7 hours.
Correlations between sleep duration, 
sleepiness, and chronotype were all 
statistically significant (P < .001), 
reflecting greater daytime sleepiness 
among those with shorter sleep 
duration (Spearman r = −0.42) and 
those with greater eveningness 
preference (or lower chronotype 
score) (Spearman r = −0.44). 
Students with greater eveningness 
preference had shorter sleep 
duration (Pearson r = 0.34).
In linear regression models with 
self-regulation measures as the 
dependent variables and adjustment 
for all covariates, both sleepiness 
and chronotype were statistically 
significant (P ≤ .001) independent 
predictors of self-regulation ( 
Table 
2). However, in none of these models 
was sleep duration (in hours) 
significantly associated with self-
regulation after we controlled for 
sleepiness and chronotype. This 
was also true when sleep duration

was modeled as a binary (<7 and ≥7 
hours) or 4-category (<7, 7 to <8, 8 
to <9, and ≥9 hours) variable. The 
difference in total self-regulation 
score, expressed in SD units, between 
those with high and low sleepiness 
was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 
0.48–0.71), after we adjusted for 
covariates, chronotype score, and 
sleep duration (in hours). The 
difference in standardized total 
self-regulation score between those 
with eveningness and morningness 
chronotype was 0.35 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.24–0.46), after 
we adjusted for covariates, level of 
sleepiness, and sleep duration (in 
hours).
When interaction terms were added 
to our regression models, none of 
the interactions were statistically 
significant. Specifically, the 
relationship between self-regulation 
and each of the sleep variables did not 
significantly differ by age. In groups 
with either shorter (<7 hours) or 
longer (≥7 hours) sleep duration, the 
relationship between self-regulation 
and sleepiness ( 
Fig 1) was similar, as 
was the relationship between self-
regulation and chronotype ( 
Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this is the first 
study to examine sleep duration, 
sleepiness, and chronotype in 
relation to self-regulation in a 
large community-based sample 
of adolescents. Our findings 
suggest that eveningness 
chronotype and increased daytime 
sleepiness are associated with 
self-regulation but that short sleep 
duration is not.
These findings contrast with those 
from short-term experimental 
studies in adolescents showing 
that sleep restriction impairs 
self-regulation. 
82 
 
 
– 
87 However, 
those studies differ from larger 
epidemiologic studies, such as ours, 
which assessed the relationship 
between self-regulation and chronic 
sleep loss, based on usual nighttime 
sleep duration. Our findings are 
consistent with the only 2 other 
epidemiologic studies on this 
topic, both of which also showed 
no significant association among 
adolescents between sleep duration 
and aspects of self-regulation. 
Among 236 US adolescents, daytime 
sleepiness, but not nighttime sleep 
duration, predicted parent-reported 
deficits in executive function 
65; 
among 1194 Argentinian adolescents, 
sleep duration was not significantly 
associated with attention after 
accounting for daytime sleepiness. 
66 
However, neither study examined the 
role of chronotype.
An emerging literature suggests that 
eveningness chronotype (circadian 
preference) is associated with 
behaviors involving impaired self-
regulation, such as drug and alcohol 
use, and unsafe behaviors and sexual 
practices. 
26, 
 
88 Eveningness is also 
associated with risk taking in the 
domains of financial, ethical, and 
recreational decision-making. 
89 
Furthermore, associations between 
chronotype, health risk behaviors, 
and well-being are strongest in 
adolescents and young adults.

All models are based on a sample size of 2017, with multiple imputation used to account for missing data. Higher self-
regulation scores indicate greater self-regulation. Sleep duration is modeled in hours (continuous); chronotype is 
modeled as a score (continuous), with higher scores indicating greater morningness preference; sleepiness is modeled 
as categories (tertiles), with lowest tertile (low sleepiness group) omitted.
a Model 1 contains the 3 sleep variables but no covariates.
b Model 2 is adjusted for 7 covariates: age, sex, race or ethnicity, highest parental education, receipt of free or reduced-
price meals, anxiety or mood disorder, and attention-defi
 cit/hyperactivity disorder.

There are several possible 
explanations for this association. 
One is that evening types sleep less 
because of their later bedtimes and 
social and environmental demands 
necessitating early morning wake 
times. These people are also forced to 
awaken and function at a time of day 
that, for them, occurs during their 
biological lowest level of alertness 
(circadian nadir). Evening types are 
also more likely to be exposed to 
environmental factors (eg, increased 
late evening light and decreased 
morning light), which exacerbate 
the biologically based eveningness 
preference. In addition, throughout 
the day, circadian-based peaks and 
troughs of alertness in evening types 
may not coincide (or synchronize) 
with timing of environmental 
demands (eg, test taking and 
homework times). 
47, 
 
90, 
 
91 Thus, 
among evening-type adolescents 
the misalignment of environmental 
expectations with circadian biology 
may contribute to actual and 
perceived impairment in 
self-regulation. Furthermore, when 
given the opportunity on weekends 
and non–school or work days, 
evening types tend to revert to their 
normal sleep pattern of late bedtimes 
and wake times, which typically 
results in variability in sleep patterns 
over the course of an average 
week. All these factors are thought 
to contribute to the phenomenon 
of social jet lag or circadian 
misalignment.
Independent of chronotype, 
sleepiness was also associated with 
lower self-regulation. In adolescents, 
sleepiness may be a more accurate 
indicator than sleep duration 
of insufficient sleep because it 
reflects the person’s perception of 
sleep-related impairment. Sleepiness 
is probably influenced by factors 
other than sleep duration that have 
yet to be elucidated. One of those 
factors may be chronotype, which 
we found explained variability in 
self-regulation, independent of 
sleepiness or sleep duration. We 
also found that the negative 
impacts of increased sleepiness and 
eveningness chronotype on self-
regulation were of similar magnitude 
regardless of sleep duration. Our 
findings suggest that clinicians may 
want to assess daytime sleepiness 
in adolescents by using existing 
tools 
92, 
 
93 and consider whether 
sleepiness, not just sleep duration, 
may be a factor in assessing the 
adequacy of adolescents’ sleep. 
Researchers should examine the 
etiology of sleepiness among 
adolescents, especially among those 
sleeping ≥8 hours each night, and the

contribution of sleepiness to health 
and functioning.
Greater self-regulation in childhood 
is associated with a variety of 
positive adult outcomes, such 
as better physical health, more 
financial security, less criminality, 
and less substance use, 
 
94 and it is 
possible that improving early self-
regulation may promote health and 
functioning over the life course. 
Our data suggest that sleep-related 
variables contribute to better self-
regulation, and future research 
should prospectively evaluate the 
impact of multiple dimensions of 
sleep on the development of self-
regulation. Although it is possible 
that poor self-regulation could 
contribute to unhealthy sleep 
practices that in turn result in sleep 
deficits, reverse causality would not 
be consistent with experimental 
studies in children showing that 
short-term manipulation of sleep 
alters self-regulation. Our results 
also have policy implications. For 
example, both genetic variations 
in clock genes and environmental 
influences contribute to the 
distribution of chronotypes in a given 
population. 
95 Thus, there may be 
remediable environmental factors 
that potentially contribute to chronic 
sleep loss, circadian misalignment, 
and increased daytime sleepiness 
in adolescents. In particular, early 
(before 8:30 AM) school start times, 
which have been associated with 
chronic insufficient sleep, increased 
daytime sleepiness, and social jet lag, 
especially in eveningness students, 
may have long-term detrimental 
effects on adolescent health and 
functioning. 
13, 
 
96
There are limitations to this study. 
Because of the cross-sectional 
nature of the design, we cannot infer 
any causal relationships between 
variables, nor can we exclude the 
possibility that poor self-regulation 
impairs sleep. All our data were self-
reported, which may lead to common 
rater bias. The results related to 
behavioral self-regulation should be 
interpreted cautiously because this 
subscore was derived from 2 items, 
which may also explain the low 
internal consistency of the measure. 
Our sample was not representative 
of the student population from which 
it was drawn, and this limitation 
may reduce the generalizability 
of the results. However, it is often 
unnecessary to have representative 
samples to make valid assessment of 
the associations between exposures 
and outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
Self-regulation in adolescents 
contributes to a range of positive 
health and functioning outcomes 
that have potential long-term 
implications. The development of 
self-regulation during adolescence 
may be adversely affected by 
exposure to sleep-related stressors, 
such as the circadian misalignment 
associated with evening chronotype 
and increased sleepiness, both of 
which may be related to the timing 
and duration of nighttime sleep. 
Efforts to optimize adolescents’ 
nighttime sleep, including 
implementation of healthy school 
start times and education on healthy 
sleep habits, may mitigate these 
effects.
