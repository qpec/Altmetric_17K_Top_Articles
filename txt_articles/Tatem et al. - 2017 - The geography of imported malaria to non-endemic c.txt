countries: a meta-analysis of nationally reported statistics

Summary
Background Malaria remains a problem for many countries classifi
 ed as malaria free through cases imported from 
endemic regions. Imported cases to non-endemic countries often result in delays in diagnosis, are expensive to treat, 
and can sometimes cause secondary local transmission. The movement of malaria in endemic countries has also 
contributed to the spread of drug resistance and threatens long-term eradication goals. Here we focused on quantifying 
the international movements of malaria to improve our understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the design of 
mitigation strategies.
Methods In this meta-analysis, we studied the database of publicly available nationally reported statistics on imported 
malaria in the past 10 years, covering more than 50 000 individual cases. We obtained data from 40 non-endemic 
countries and recorded the geographical variations.
Findings Infection movements were strongly skewed towards a small number of high-traffi
  c routes between 2005 and 
2015, with the west Africa region accounting for 56% (13 947/24 941) of all imported cases to non-endemic countries 
with a reported travel destination, and France and the UK receiving the highest number of cases, with more than 
4000 reported cases per year on average. Countries strongly linked by movements of imported cases are grouped by 
historical, language, and travel ties. There is strong spatial clustering of plasmodium species types.
Interpretation The architecture of the air network, historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria endemicity 
contribute to highly heterogeneous patterns of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites transported. 
With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, malaria control altering local transmission, and the 
threat of drug resistance, understanding these patterns and their drivers is increasing in importance.

Introduction
Tackling malaria remains a high priority internationally, 
with elimination and eradication back on the global 
agenda.1 In the past century, more than 50 countries have 
succeeded in eliminating the disease. Nevertheless, 
although malaria is no longer endemic in these nations, 
increasing travel to endemic areas in recent decades 
means that the malaria-endemic world is becoming 
increasingly connected by population movements,2 and 
that imported malaria cases remain common.3 Such 
cases continue to pose challenges for diagnosis and 
management, with malaria remaining an infrequently 
encountered disease for many physicians in non-
endemic areas,4 where it can be expensive to treat5 and 
result in high mortality.6 Moreover, with anopheles 
vectors still present in many non-endemic countries, 
imported cases can also cause secondary transmission,7 
although the chances of resumption of endemic 
transmission are very small.8 Finally, although the eff
 ects 
of imported malaria on malaria-free countries are 
problematic, data on the features of imported cases can 
also provide valuable information about both the 
epidemiology of malaria in endemic regions where 
surveillance systems are weak, and on how malaria 
moves around the world.2
The timing, number, and origin of imported malaria 
cases into non-endemic regions vary by country and are a 
function of several factors including the transmission 
intensity of the origin location, the number of people 
visiting that location, the activities undertaken in the 
location, and prophylaxis availability and adherence.3,9–11 
Depending on the country, some demographic groups 
have substantially higher infection rates. For instance, 
malaria imported to Europe is often reported in travellers 
returning from (or migrants coming from) endemic 
areas and migrants living in Europe returning from 
visiting friends and relatives, with children who are 
visiting friends and relatives being particularly at risk.12
Information about imported malaria is to an extent 
captured by national authorities where, for most 
high-income countries, malaria is a notifi
 able disease. 
However, under-reporting is probably common; for 
instance, WHO reported that 6244 cases of malaria were 
imported to Europe in 2010, but the true number might be 
six times higher.13 Such defi
 ciencies have prompted the 
initiation of surveillance networks such as GeoSentinel14

and EuroTravNet,15,16 which now play a key part in the 
surveillance of imported malaria, in the identifi
 cation of 
changing trends in malaria importation, in tracking 
drug-resistance patterns, and in establishing the changing 
profi
 le of malaria risk at traveller destinations. Nevertheless, 
nationally reported data continue to be widely collected and 
still provide valuable information about the trends, 
composition, and drivers of imported malaria for most 
non-endemic countries, with annual data compilations and 
analyses of statistics providing the main source of 
information guiding national policies on imported malaria. 
However, a contemporary global assembly of such 
nationally reported data, and assessment of patterns and 
variations has not previously been undertaken.
Here, we describe the fi
 rst global assembly of 
nationally reported imported malaria data in 20 years,11 
and the geographic analysis of these data from 
40 non-endemic countries in the past 10 years. We map 
the 
system 
of 
transmission 
from 
endemic 
to 
non-endemic areas to provide insights into the 
underlying dynamics of the system. Exploration of the 
driving factors behind these patterns is beyond the scope 
of this study. We examine the rates of fl
 ow of cases from 
endemic to non-endemic countries and their inherent 
spatial patterns. Moreover, we map the species 
composition of cases by sending and receiving regions. 
Finally, we discuss candidate factors that shape the 
recorded patterns and likely future trends.
Methods
Full details of the process of constructing a library of 
imported malaria statistics and data extractions are 
provided in appendix (pp 2–8). Here we provide brief 
details of the steps taken in assembly and analysis of 
the data.
National imported malaria statistics
Most non-endemic countries compile their notifi
 ed 
cases of malaria into annual summary reports. These 
reports were assembled from the national laboratories 
and agencies that compile imported malaria statistics for 
as many years as available (appendix). We complemented 
these data with searches on PubMed, Web of Science, 
Google Scholar, and standard Google search for 
“imported malaria” and the name of the non-endemic 
country in question, in both English and the primary 
language of the country where this was not English. 
These searches identifi
 ed a set of additional academic 
papers and reports documenting imported cases. For 
each country, where available, we extracted data on the 
numbers of confi
 rmed cases reported, the year, their 
likely origin regions or countries, the species of parasite, 
and the method of diagnosis.
Data processing
We constructed a set of broad rules to facilitate data 
summarisation, exclusion, and processing. These were 
based on achieving a balance between maintaining a 
wide representation of data from several countries, time 
periods, and sources, and implementing some quality 
control to ensure comparability between datasets and 
avoid double-counting. We minimised double-counting 
through examination of data obtained from academic 
publications—if they were obtained from nationally 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The rise of air travel in the past century has resulted in a highly 
interconnected world, where geographical distance is becoming 
less of a barrier to pathogen dispersal. Malaria-free countries 
that were once endemic to the disease still report thousands of 
cases every year through importation, resulting in deaths,  
health system burden, and occasional secondary transmission. 
The disease is notifi
 able in most high-income countries, 
providing data on case numbers and characteristics to direct 
mitigation strategies. Multiple individual studies at national 
scales over the past decade have highlighted the substantial 
heterogeneities in imported malaria numbers, rates, and risks 
that exist across geographies, demographics, and malaria 
species, but have not been brought together in a single study.
Added value of this study
This study reports the fi
 rst global collection of nationally 
reported imported malaria statistics in 20 years. Moreover, it 
presents the fi
 rst global assessment of the geographical 
features of imported malaria, including patterns of fl
 ows, 
connectivity, species distributions, and diagnostic capacities. 
Our fi
 ndings show how limits to malaria dispersal remain and 
how clear patterns in movements exist that have never been 
quantifi
 ed before, with the architecture of the air network, 
historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria 
endemicities all contributing to highly heterogeneous patterns 
of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites 
transported.
Implications of all the available evidence
With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, 
the threat of spreading drug resistance, and the continued 
burden of imported cases to non-endemic countries, 
understanding and measuring the patterns of malaria 
connectivity and their drivers is increasing in importance for 
designing mitigation, control, and elimination strategies. 
Prioritising surveillance and control eff
 orts to high-traffi
  c 
routes and highly connected locations, as well as coordinating 
elimination eff
 orts around highly connected regional 
groupings of countries is likely to be the most eff
 ective and 
effi
  cient approach.

reported statistics covering the same period as already 
extracted from national laboratory reports, then the data 
were not included in analyses. Throughout, we prioritised 
statistics from national agencies over academic papers, 
which were used as supplemental data sources to cover 
missing periods. We did diff
 erent hierarchies of analysis 
to enable presentations of outputs where data inclusion 
criteria were relaxed to enable comparisons across many 
countries, and criteria were tightened or data were 
aggregated to facilitate the production of more robust, 
but less detailed, conclusions. 
Although the datasets assembled extended from 1960 
to the end of 2015, to obtain a contemporary picture 
while still including a large number of countries and 
regions, analyses were undertaken only for the most 
recent 10 years of data. Therefore, data were restricted to 
2005–15, using an annual mean of cases across the full 
10 years when available, although for some countries, 
data were only available for less than 5 years of this 
period. For each endemic exporting country, we 
aggregated all reported annual mean case numbers 
exported to non-endemic reporting countries to obtain 
estimates of the proportions of each parasite species (or 
mixed infections, when documented as such) exported. 
Although this averaging masked temporal trends in the 
data, clear trends over time were not apparent for most 
countries, and in view of the gaps in publicly available 
data (appendix), this time window facilitated the 
inclusion of many more countries than a more 
constrained one. We constructed origin–destination 
matrices for the average number of cases per year 
imported from endemic to non-endemic countries. Many 
data sources reported exported cases only by large 
regions, therefore we also constructed a regional version 
of this matrix to enable the inclusion of more data and 
thus identify geographical patterns more robustly. We 
also analysed these data to estimate the aggregate malaria 
species compositions being exported from endemic 
countries and imported to non-endemic countries. 
Where species breakdowns of imported cases were 
reported, they were aggregated and summarised across 
the reporting period.17 Similar to the origin–destination 
matrices, data for species composition for many 
countries were reported only by origin region; thus data 
were also aggregated by region to provide larger sample 
sizes and thus more confi
 dence in estimates of 
diff
 erences between regions by composition.
Network community detection
Communities in a network refl
 ect a group of nodes that 
are densely connected and separated from the other 
nodes in the network, and thus they share common 
properties and have similar roles within the network. By 
mapping communities on the imported malaria network 
defi
 ned here, we aimed to identify groups of countries 
that show strong links in terms of movements of infected 
travellers. Newman and Girvan17 defi
 ne a modularity 
score, which is a measure of the strength of a division of 
a network into communities (groups of countries in this 
case). The analysis uses a multilevel algorithm for 
community detection,18 which uses an iterative approach 
that merges communities to maximise the modularity.
Additional datasets
The construction of modelled global Plasmodium 
falciparum19 and Plasmodium vivax20 parasite prevalence 
maps enabled simple comparisons to be made with the 
imported malaria statistics. The datasets were obtained 
from the Malaria Atlas Project and summarised to a 
national level using gridded population data from the 
WorldPop project and the Global Rural Urban Mapping 
Project to produce a population-weighted mean 
P falciparum and P vivax prevalence for each country. 
Additionally, we obtained bilateral data21 for migrations 
between each pair of endemic and non-endemic 
countries to enable further comparisons to be made with 
the number of cases of imported malaria.

Results
The movement of people with malaria in 2005–15 followed 
specifi
 c routes (fi
 gure 1). Of those cases with origin 
location recorded between 2005 and 2015, more cases 
were reported in France (2169 cases per year on average) 
and the UK (n=1898) than any other country (fi
 gure 1A), 
with the USA (n=1511), Italy (n=637), and Germany 
(n=401) close behind. Most (22 946/24 941 [92%]) exported 
cases to non-endemic countries originate in west Africa 
(13 947 [56%]), India (4988 [20%]), east Africa (3242 [13%]), 
and Papua New Guinea (748 [3%]; fi
 gure 1A). Figure 1B 
shows that the connections between the UK and west 
Africa, and between France and west Africa are the 
strongest in terms of annual average numbers of cases 
moving from endemic to non-endemic countries 
(2492 cases on average per year, 2005–15), but that many 
other routes produce an annual average of more than 
50 cases reported in non-endemic countries. These 
include the movements between the USA and India 
(149 cases per year on average), the USA and west Africa 
(n=716), the USA and Haiti (n=52), Australia and Papua 
New Guinea (n=97), and the UK and Pakistan (n=69). By 
defi
 ning the origin–destination pairs of endemic–non-
endemic countries and the cases originating and reported 
in each as a weighted network, the community detection 
analyses identifi
 ed sections of this global imported 
malaria fl
 ow matrix that were more strongly connected 
than others. Although the matrix is incomplete, with

non-endemic countries, it is clear that the structure of 
these mapped network communities is not mainly 
geographically determined (fi
 gure 2), with historical, 
economic, language, and cultural ties evident. For 
example, the UK community includes the English-
speaking African nations connected to the UK that were 
its former colonies (including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, 
Uganda, and The Gambia), and French colonial ties are 
also evident (including Mali, Niger, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, 
Burkina Faso, Benin, Togo, and Madagascar).
Clear associations exist between the average annual 
number of outgoing P falciparum cases from endemic to 
non-endemic countries, P falciparum prevalence in the 
endemic countries, and the migration fl
 ows to non-
endemic countries (fi
 gure 3). Moreover, the countries with 
the most migrants residing in non-endemic countries 
(eg, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria) typically fall further 
towards the upper-left side of the plot, as larger numbers of 
travellers (particularly those visiting friends and relatives in 
endemic countries) are related to larger numbers of 
imported cases to non-endemic countries. Although there 
are associations between the numbers of cases and both 
malaria prevalence in endemic countries and numbers of 
migrants in non-endemic countries, many other factors 
play a part, including demographics, levels of prophylaxis 
and protection use, and travel activities.
We analysed the species compositions of cases reported 
in non-endemic countries by region (fi
 gure 4) and nation

(fi
 gure 5 and table). Reports of cases in non-endemic 
countries often present species type broken down by 
origin region rather than country, thus initially we did 
the species composition analyses at pooled regional level 
to ensure larger and more stable sample sizes (fi
 gure 4). 
The results emphasise the large variation in the species 
composition of malaria cases travelling between the 
diff
 erent regions of the world. Although these outputs 
represent a pooling of data of varying numbers, time 
periods, treatment-seeking behaviours, and diagnostic 
capacities, the clear and geographically consistent 
patterns suggest a robustness in the outputs. The 
dominance of P falciparum from African and Caribbean 
sources (mean percentage of cases across regions 74·4%) 
compared with those originating in Central and South 
America (13·1%) and Asia and Oceania (17·6%) is clear, 
although no single species in any region has total 
dominance. This fi
 nding is also refl
 ected at national 
levels (fi
 gure 5), with strong geographically coherent 
patterns recorded, but also a mixed picture in many 
places, especially in southeast Asia and central America. 
The species compositions of cases received in each 
non-endemic country (fi
 gure 4 and table) are indicative 
of each country’s connections to endemic regions. For 
example, the high P falciparum percentage for France 
results from its strong ties to west Africa (fi
 gure 1). 
European proximity and ties to Africa result in more 
cases of P falciparum (mean percentage of cases of 
65·8%) than in the Americas (41·7%) or the Asia-Pacifi
 c 
region (32·9%), although a divide is clear, with higher 
proportions of P vivax in eastern compared with western 
Europe evident (fi
 gure 4). Finally, analyses of diagnostic 
capacities in European countries (appendix pp 9, 10) 
highlight the growth in capacities in the past decade, 
with an increasing use of PCR and rapid tests. However, 
substantial geographical diff
 erences remain, with the 
range of methods and their reporting higher in western 
Europe than eastern Europe.
Discussion
The substantial growth in the reach and rates of human 
travel, in particular the air traffi
  c network, in recent 
decades, has had a major eff
 ect on global disease 
epidemiology, including malaria.9 Rising rates of travel to 
and from endemic areas has resulted in imported malaria 
being frequently reported in malaria-free countries, with 
occasional secondary transmission.7 However, this travel 
expansion has not been ubiquitous, with historical and 
economic ties driving growth along certain routes far 
more than others, and resulting in uneven malaria 
movement.2 Moreover, substantial investment in malaria 
control in recent decades has resulted in overall decreased 
prevalence in endemic areas, with some areas noting 
especially large decreases,22 further contributing to 
variations in importation to non-endemic countries. 
Here, we have presented unique analyses of a global 
assembly of publicly available contemporary data for the 
national reporting of imported malaria to capture these 
variations and quantify the broad geographic features.
We noted clear and consistent patterns despite 
diff
 erences in data quality, completeness, and temporality, 
and data being indicative of the diff
 erent surveillance 
systems and diagnostic capacities of the reporting 
countries (appendix pp 9, 10). Our results underline the 
substantial geographical heterogeneities that exist in 
reported malaria case numbers and compositions in 
non-endemic countries. Moreover, certain routes from 
endemic to non-endemic countries carry substantially 
more infections than others, with evidence of tight 
couplings that refl
 ect historical ties. These communities 
of countries can serve to guide surveillance, develop 
mitigation strategies, and highlight likely routes of drug-
resistant malaria movement.23 The tight coupling of 
locations also highlights risks for secondary transmission 
following imported cases, such as through immigrant 
labour in the Middle East24 or Chinese labourers 
returning from Africa.25 Further, the species compositions 
highlight P vivax, P ovale, and Plasmodium malariae as 
potential malaria parasites in areas of the world where 
they are rarely considered, such as much of Africa. 
Coupled with policy shifts towards species-specifi
 c 
Figure 2: Results of community detections on the network of malaria 
endemic–non-endemic imported malaria pairs
Countries mapped in the same colour belong to a unique community, with 
imported malaria case movements being larger within the communities than 
between them. Fewer cases in Asia and the Americas had origin–destination 
information available, making the community detection results less robust. 
Moreover, with substantially fewer non-endemic countries outside of Europe 
with strong reporting, analyses simply show the regions as homogeneous single 
communities.

diagnostics and reporting, this fi
 nding could prompt a 
robust assessment of the more neglected non-falciparum 
parasites that can still cause severe clinical illness and 
require specifi
 c control interventions.
We have endeavoured to minimise the uncertainties 
and errors that arise through the analysis of data from 
such a large range of sources. However, many factors, 
including the opportunistic and highly varied nature of 
the available data, aff
 ect our ability to compare between 
countries and draw precise conclusions. First, the data 
represent a small proportion of a possibly larger pool of 
cases, with some estimates suggesting that national 
statistics might capture just one-sixth of all imported 
cases.13 
Variations

mechanisms and diagnostic capacities between countries 
also probably mean that some countries capture more 
cases than others, some cities and regions within 
countries capture more than others, and some countries 
have a greater capacity to undertake reliable speciation 
through using PCR or having more experienced and well 
trained microscopists. Microscopic examination is widely 
available in most non-endemic countries (appendix pp 9, 
10); however, misdiagnoses or late diagnoses can still be 
common because of the failure of medical personnel to 
relate the febrile symptoms to a disease that is rarely 
reported in their region. Malaria symptoms are non-
specifi
 c and cannot easily be distinguished from other 
febrile disorders on clinical grounds alone. Moreover,

Microscopic diagnosis is often slow and inaccurate in 
non-specialised laboratories.26,27 In some cases, molecular 
assays can become insuffi

diagnosis, especially to detect all species in mixed 
infections or in cases when parasitaemia is low, which is 
often the case in non-immune patients who complied 
with chemoprophylaxis.
Moreover, one or more species in mixed species 
infections are easily overlooked, and some species are 
more diffi

morphological similarities between P vivax and P ovale 
potentially a source of misclassifi

studies depending on the method used to detect the 
infection. The large percentages of unknown malaria 
types for some countries are likely to be indicative of a 
lack of diagnostic capacity. National health statistics often 
do not report the techniques used, and therefore it is 
necessary to refer to the academic publications describing 
the summarised national data in which this information 
is provided to assess the overall precision of the diagnosis 
at the country level. Finally, intervention scale-up,22 
urbanisation,29 changing wealth,30 and improved health 
systems are all likely to have aff
 ected the prevalence and 
species composition of malaria in endemic regions in the 
past decade, subsequently aff
 ecting the comparability of 
imported case data in non-endemic regions between 
years. Nevertheless, the clear, consistent, and coherent 
patterns we recorded within regions and between 
countries and the congruence with results through 
dedicated surveillance networks,3,14–16 suggest that the data 
presented here form a representative sample.
Second, several factors relating to diff
 erences in 
traveller type and activity between countries contribute to 
the representativeness, comparability between nations, 
and uncertainties in outputs. Rates of chemoprophylaxis, 
prescription, use, and antimalarial adherence vary by 
country and by demographic group,31,32 as does the use of 
protective measures while travelling.33 Further, the 
demographics and ethnic composition of traveller groups 
vary by country; for example, nations that have large 
migrant populations originating from endemic countries 
probably contribute to more cases arising from those 
visiting friends and relatives.6 The proportion of imported 
malaria cases due to migrants in Europe has increased in 
the past 15 years,34 with those visiting friends and relatives 
travelling to endemic areas of Africa more than eight 
times more likely to be diagnosed with malaria compared 
with tourists,35 and their children being especially at 
risk.36 Activities in endemic regions might also contribute 
to diff
 erences recorded; for instance, people travelling to 
urban areas and staying in hotels are likely to be at lower 
risk. Diff
 erences in demographics and health systems 
also translate to diff
 erences in treatment seeking as well 
as whether case importation occurs principally through 
visitors or travelling residents. Some demographic 
groups are more likely to seek treatment than others for 
travel-related health issues.34
Our study is an ongoing eff
 ort. Summaries of national 
malaria surveillance data are not made publicly available 
for all countries and years and many additional relevant 
datasets probably remain unpublished, so we welcome 
input from those who have access to datasets not included 
here to enable continual updates. Our study provides a 
global picture of malaria importation to non-endemic 
countries, but does not extend to exploration of the 
driving factors behind these patterns. However, our 
future work will focus on building datasets and a 
modelling framework for understanding what drives the 
patterns noted here.
The associations with malaria endemicity and migration 
fl
 ows suggest two key drivers, but further data for travel 
patterns and volumes, malaria transmission, demo-
graphics, health system effi
  ciency, diagnostic capacities, 
treatment-seeking behaviours, and prophylaxis compliance 
and availability, among other factors, need to be collated to 
better explain and model the malaria importation patterns 
recorded, with a goal of predictive modelling. Further, such 
analyses could be extended to other commonly imported

infectious diseases3,9,37 and the eff
 ects of seasonal variations 
in these drivers could be incorporated.38,39 We have focused 
on broad comparisons through pooling across years to 
provide suffi
  cient data. This approach has probably ignored 
changes that have occurred across time, and future work 
will have to focus on augmenting and breaking these data 
down to explore temporal trends. Finally, our results match 
closely those found through analysis of data collected 
by surveillance networks such as GeoSentinel14 and 
EuroTravNet,15,16 but future work should focus on 
undertaking quantitative comparisons.
As many countries move towards national malaria 
elimination, 
global 
eradication 
moves 
up 
the 
international agenda,1 and the threat of spreading drug 
resistance grows,23 there is an increasing focus on 
malaria importation and the vulnerability of countries to 
resurgence.40 This study forms part of wider eff
 orts to 
understand patterns of human and malaria parasite 
movement and how such information can guide control 
and elimination eff
 orts. Malaria parasites do not respect 
national borders, and with human mobility continuing to 
increase in its volumes and reach, increasing global 
connectivity,2 control, and treatment strategies should 
account for the continued globalisation of malaria.
