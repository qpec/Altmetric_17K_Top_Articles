Abstract:  
30 
Alcohol-based hand rubs are international pillars of hospital infection control, restricting 
31 
transmission of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Despite this success, health care 
32 
infections caused by Enterococcus faecium (Efm) - another multidrug resistant pathogen - are 
33 
increasing. We tested alcohol tolerance of 139 hospital Efm isolates, obtained between 1997 and 
34 
2015 and found Efm post-2010 were 10-fold more tolerant to alcohol killing than older isolates. 
35 
Using a mouse infection control model, we then showed that alcohol tolerant Efm resisted standard 
36 
70% isopropanol surface disinfection and led to gastrointestinal colonization significantly more 
37 
often than alcohol sensitive Efm.  We next looked for bacterial genomic signatures of adaptation. 
38 
Tolerant Efm have independently accumulated mutations modifying genes involved in carbohydrate 
39 
uptake and metabolism. Mutagenesis confirmed their roles in isopropanol tolerance. These findings 
40 
suggest bacterial adaptation and complicate infection control recommendations. Additional policies 
41 
and procedures to prevent Efm spread are required.

Introduction: 
45 
Enterococci are members of the gastrointestinal microbiota with low virulence but they have 
46 
nevertheless emerged as a major cause of healthcare associated infections (1).  Enterococci now 
47 
account for approximately 10% of hospital acquired bacteraemia cases globally, and they are the 
48 
fourth and fifth leading cause of sepsis in North America and Europe respectively (2). Hospital 
49 
acquired enterococcal infections are difficult to treat because of their intrinsic and acquired 
50 
resistance to many classes of antibiotics (3). The difficulties associated with treatment, coupled with 
51 
the risk of cross transmission to other patients, make enterococcal infections an increasingly 
52 
important hospital infection control risk (4).  
53 
 
54 
Among the medically important enterococci, Enterococcus faecium (Efm) in particular has become 
55 
a leading cause of nosocomial infections (5). E. faecium population analysis has revealed the 
56 
emergence of a rapidly evolving lineage referred to as Clade-A1 and includes clonal complex 17 
57 
(CC17), comprising strains associated with hospital infections across five continents (6, 7). These 
58 
hospital strains are resistant to ampicillin, aminoglycosides and quinolones, and their genomes 
59 
contain a high number of mobile genetic elements and are enriched for genes encoding altered 
60 
carbohydrate utilization and transporter proteins that distinguish them from community-acquired 
61 
and non-pathogenic Efm strains (6). 
62 
 
63 
A recent Australia-wide survey demonstrated that Efm caused one third of bacteraemic 
64 
enterococcal infections, and 90% of these were ampicillin-resistant clonal complex 17 strains, of 
65 
which 50% were also vancomycin-resistant (8). Costs associated with the management of 
66 
vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) colonised patients are high because of the need for 
67 
isolation rooms, specialised cleaning regimes and the impact on staff, bed flow and other resources. 
68 
Treatment of invasive VRE infections requires higher-cost antibiotics, with patients experiencing 
69 
side effects and treatment failure due to further acquired resistance (8).

71 
Alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) and associated hand hygiene programs are a mainstay of 
72 
infection control strategies in healthcare facilities worldwide and their introduction is aligned with 
73 
declines in some hospital-acquired infections, in particular those caused by hospital-adapted 
74 
multidrug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The compositions of hand hygiene 
75 
solutions typically contain at least 70% (v/v) isopropyl or ethyl alcohol (9-11). The application of 
76 
ABHR for 30 seconds has better disinfection efficacy than traditional approaches with soap and 
77 
water, with greater than 3·5 log10 reduction in bacterial counts considered effective (12). The 
78 
presence of alcohol in ABHR is responsible for rapid bacterial killing at these concentrations 
79 
although some species are capable of surviving alcohol exposure at lower concentrations (9, 13). 
80 
The ability to withstand the addition of a certain percentage of alcohol is referred to as alcohol 
81 
tolerance, and this phenomenon has been described across several genera (13, 14). 
82 
 
83 
To control VRE many healthcare facilities perform active surveillance cultures (ASC) on all 
84 
patients and then employ contact precautions that involve the use of gowns, gloves and single room 
85 
isolation for patients colonised (15). However, this approach is expensive and cumbersome, 
86 
particularly when VRE endemicity is high. Due to the relatively low virulence of VRE, other 
87 
facilities rely on standard precautions, predominantly ABHR usage, and only selectively perform 
88 
ASC in high-risk areas such as Haematology and ICU (15).  At Austin Health and Monash Medical 
89 
Centre, two university teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, patients are screened for VRE 
90 
rectal colonization on-admission and weekly for all inpatients in defined high-risk clinical areas. 
91 
VRE-colonized patients are cohorted and contact precautions (including strict adherence to ABHR 
92 
guidelines) are used routinely (16).

In this current study, motivated by our observation that successive waves of new Efm clones that 
95 
were driving increasing clinical infection, we commenced an investigation into the tolerance of 
96 
more recent Efm isolates to the short chain alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) used in ABHR.  
97 
 
98 
Results: 
99 
Increasing isopropanol tolerance among hospital Efm isolates over time 
100 
ABHR was systematically introduced to Australian health care facilities beginning at Austin Health 
101 
in December 2002 (17-19). One consequence of this changed practice has been the substantial 
102 
increase in the volume of ABHR products used by institutions. For instance, the volume of ABHR 
103 
increased at Austin Health from 100L/month in 2001 to 1000L/month in 2015. We tested the 
104 
hypothesis that Efm isolates are adapting to this changed environment and becoming more tolerant 
105 
to alcohol exposure than earlier isolates.  We assessed the isopropanol tolerance of 139 Efm isolates 
106 
collected from two major Australian hospitals over 19 years. There was considerable variation in 
107 
isopropanol tolerance, with a range of 4·7-log10 between isolates. These differences were 
108 
independent of Efm sequence type (Data file S1), but we noticed that later isolates were more likely 
109 
to be tolerant to isopropanol killing than earlier isolates (Fig. 1A), an observation that was 
110 
supported by significantly different population mean tolerance when comparing pre-2004 with post-
111 
2009 isolates (0.97-log10 mean difference, p<0·0001, Fig. 1A). There was genetic diversity among 
112 
the Efm population across this time-period (discussed in more detail later) with two dominant CC17 
113 
MLST types (ST17, and ST203) that each incrementally displayed increasing isopropanol tolerance 
114 
(Fig. 1B,C). Isolates representing the most recently emerged clone (ST796) exhibited uniformly 
115 
high isopropanol tolerance (n=16, median: 1·14-log10 reduction, Data file S1, Fig. 1D). There was 
116 
no relationship between acquired vancomycin resistance and isopropanol tolerance. Exposure of a 
117 
selection of Efm isolates to ethanol showed similar tolerance patterns as isopropanol, with ST796 
118 
also significantly more ethanol tolerant compared to representatives of the other dominant Efm 
119 
sequence types (fig. S1).

Alcohol tolerance is a clinically relevant phenotype 
123 
Our tolerance assay was based on exposure to 23% (v/v) isopropanol, as this concentration provided 
124 
a discriminating dynamic range among the Efm isolates (refer methods). To assess the clinical 
125 
relevance of these tolerance differences, we established an Efm contaminated surface transmission 
126 
model, and compared the impact between two VREfm isolates on transmission of an intervention

using 70% isopropanol impregnated surface wipes of a contaminated surface. We employed a 
128 
mouse gastrointestinal tract (GIT) colonisation model, first establishing that the colonising dose-50 
129 
(CD50) among the four Efm isolates was not significantly different (Fig. 2). We selected a 2012, 
130 
alcohol tolerant isolate (Ef_aus0233, 0.45-log10) and a 1998, reduced tolerance isolate (Ef_aus0004, 
131 
4.34-log10). Groups of six BALB/c mice, pre-treated for seven days with vancomycin, were dosed 
132 
by oral gavage with decreasing doses of each isolate. The CD50 for each isolate was low and not 
133 
significantly different (Ef_aus0004: 14 CFU, 95% CI 6-36 CFU, compared to Ef_aus0233: 3 CFU, 
134 
95% CI 1-6 CFU) (Fig. 2A, B). We then coated the floor of individually vented cages (IVC) with 
135 
approximately 3 x 106 CFU of each Efm isolate and subjected each cage to a defined disinfection 
136 
regimen wiping with either water or a 70% v/v isopropanol solution. Groups of six BALB/c mice 
137 
were then released into the treated IVCs for one hour, before being rehoused in individual cages for 
138 
seven days and then screened for Efm gastrointestinal colonisation. Across three independent 
139 
experiments, we then assessed the percentage of mice from each experiment colonised by Efm. The 
140 
alcohol tolerant Efm isolate (Ef_aus0233) was significantly better able to withstand the 70% 
141 
isopropanol disinfection and colonise the mouse GIT than the more alcohol susceptible, Ef_aus0004 
142 
(p<0.01, Fig. 3C). We then repeated the experiment, but this time using a pair of VSEfm isolates 
143 
(Ef_aus0026 and Ef_aus0099) also with opposing alcohol tolerance phenotypes, but a much closer 
144 
genetic association than the first pair (see below for selection criteria). Each isolate had a low CD50 
145 
(Ef_aus0026: 19 CFU, 95% CI 9-41 CFU, compared to Ef_aus0099: 12 CFU, 95% CI 3-62 CFU) 
146 
(Fig. 3B). Ef_aus0099 was 4.4-fold more isopropanol tolerant than Ef_aus0026 with a core genome 
147 
difference of only 29 SNPs (Data file S2). Across four independent experiments, a significantly 
148 
greater number mice were colonized by the isopropanol tolerant Efm isolate (Ef_aus0099) than the 
149 
more susceptible, Ef_aus0026 (p<0.01, Fig. 3C).

Population structure of Efm  
152 
To look for signatures of genetic adaptation that associated with alcohol tolerance we first 
153 
compared the genomes of 129 of the 139 Efm isolates (10 isolates failed sequencing). A high-
154 
resolution SNP-based phylogeny was inferred from pairwise core-genome comparisons and 
155 
Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS) that stratified the population into seven distinct 
156 
genetic groups coinciding with previous MLST designations (Fig. 3A). The population had a 
157 
substantial pan-genome, comprising 8739 protein coding DNA sequences (CDS) clusters, 
158 
underscoring the extensive genetic diversity of this Efm population (fig. S2). There was also a 
159 
temporal pattern to the appearance of each genetic group. Beginning with the previously described 
160 
displacement of ST17 with ST203 in 2006 through to the emergence of ST796 in 2012, we 
161 
observed the introduction to the hospital at different times of distinct Efm clones, with each clone 
162 
exhibiting increasing alcohol tolerance (Fig. 1).

hypothesis (no difference between sensitive vs tolerant isopropanol) was rejected for p<0.05, unpaired t-
test with Welch’s correction.

Identifying bacterial genetic factors linked to alcohol tolerance  
164 
High tolerance was observed within distinct Efm lineages, suggesting that multiple genetic events 
165 
have occurred leading to isopropanol tolerance (Fig. 3). We began the search for the genetic basis 
166 
of tolerance by evolutionary convergence analysis, to identify regions of the Efm genome that are 
167 
potentially harbouring genes or mutations linked to alcohol tolerance. We identified pairs of Efm

tolerance is a polygenic trait. (A) Population structure of the 129 Efm isolates subjected to WGS and 
alcohol tolerance testing in this study. The phylogeny was inferred using maximum likelihood with 
RaxML and was based on pairwise alignments of 18,292 core genome SNPs against the Ef_aus0233 
reference genome (filtered to remove recombination). Previous MLST designations are indicated. A 
heat map summary of the log10 kill values is given for each taxon, with green least tolerant and red 
most tolerant. (B) Analysis of convergent SNP differences among phylogenetically-matched pairs.

isolates that exhibited greater than 1.5-fold alcohol tolerance difference, and with less than 1,000 
169 
core genome SNP differences. With these criteria, there were 19 pairs identified across the 129 
170 
isolates (Fig. 3A, Data file S2). 
171 
  
172 
We then searched for core genome mutations that occurred in different pairs but at the same 
173 
chromosome nucleotide position and in the same direction of change (i.e. homoplasies). After 
174 
applying these criteria, three loci were identified (Fig. 3B). One of these loci was the rpoB gene, 
175 
encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. The H486N/Y RpoB substitution seen in three pairs 
176 
was associated with reduced alcohol tolerance (Fig. 3). Mutations in this region of rpoB are known 
177 
to cause resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin, and it is exposure to this drug rather than an 
178 
evolutionary response to alcohol, that likely selects these mutations. Nevertheless, the rpoB 
179 
mutations serve as additional support for the approach and its capacity to detect homoplasic 
180 
mutations associated with a changed alcohol tolerance phenotype.  The two additional loci detected 
181 
spanned an amino acid substitution in a putative symporter in three Efm pairs at chromosome 
182 
position 519,608 and two mutations in six Efm pairs in a putative phage region (around position 
183 
2,396,698) (Fig. 3A,B). 
184 
 
185 
In addition to SNP variations, we also compared the presence/absence patterns of CDS between 
186 
sensitive and tolerant Efm isolates in each of the 19 pairs. Here, we first used a supervised statistical 
187 
learning approach called Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) to build a 
188 
predictive model and identify CDS that contribute to the separation of pairs based on their 
189 
isopropanol tolerance values. Using only the first 25 principal components, the model showed good 
190 
separation of sensitive and tolerant isolates, with the resulting loading values used to guide the 
191 
ranking of CDSs that associated with the alcohol tolerant phenotype (Data file S3). This analysis 
192 
suggested that there is a genetic basis for the tolerance phenotype, with significant separation of the 
193 
alcohol tolerant/sensitive populations (Fig. 3C). We then ranked CDS according to (i) their 
194

contribution to DAPC separation of the phenotypes, (ii) the frequency of CDS presence/absence 
195 
among the 19 pairs and (iii) the direction of the CDS presence/absence (i.e. always present in 
196 
tolerant isolates, Data file S3). This analysis identified two high-scoring loci, a copy of ISEfa8 
197 
inserted adjacent to a putative prophage region around chromosome position 953,094 and a 70kb 
198 
region of a 197kb plasmid that spans CDS encoding several hypothetical proteins, a predicted 
199 
LPXTG-motif cell wall protein and two PTS systems, named PTS-1 and PTS-2 (Fig. 4A).  
200 
 
201 
Validation of bacterial genetic factors linked to alcohol tolerance  
202 
To test the validity of the predictions based on convergence analysis and DAPC, we used allelic 
203 
exchange to make targeted mutants in the isopropanol tolerant ST796 reference isolate, 
204 
Ef_aus0233. Given the reported role of PTS systems in solvent tolerance (20), we focused first on 
205 
one of the plasmid associated PTS regions, deleting a 6.5kb region of PTS-2, a putative glucoside-
206 
specific PTS (Fig. 4A). We also made a deletion mutant of the CDS (locus_tag 00501) encoding a 
207 
putative galactoside symporter (Fig. 4B), where there was a specific V264A aa substitution 
208 
associated with isopropanol tolerance. An rpoB mutant (H486Y) was also made, as this locus was 
209 
also identified in the genome convergence analysis and so should present an altered tolerance 
210 
phenotype. An absence of unintended second-site mutations was confirmed by WGS, and the PTS 
211 
and 00501 mutations were also repaired. Screening these three mutants and their repaired versions 
212 
by our isopropanol exposure killing assay showed no change in tolerance (Fig. 4C). To further 
213 
explore the sensitivity of the two mutants to isopropanol we also conducted growth curve assays in 
214 
the presence of 3% isopropanol, a concentration we determined provided useful discrimination 
215 
among our Efm collection. All mutants showed significant increases in their doubling time 
216 
compared to wild type, a phenotype restored in the repaired mutants (Fig. 4C). The mutants showed 
217 
no growth defect in the absence of isopropanol (fig. S3). These experiments confirm predictions 
218 
from convergence testing and DAPC that these loci are involved in promoting isopropanol 
219 
tolerance. Loss of individual loci however did not impact sensitivity to isopropanol killing,

Discussion  
224 
In 2005, we published a 3-year study describing a progressive decline in rates of hospital 
225 
acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus and Gram-negative infections following the introduction 
226 
and promotion of ABHR (21). Similar programs were progressively rolled out to all major hospitals 
227 
in Australia and compliance with ABHR is now a nationally reportable key performance indicator 
228 
(19).   The 2015 Australian National Hand Hygiene program report shows increasing and high 
229 
(>80%) compliance rates in health care facilities across the country (www.hha.org.au) and 
230 
staphylococcal infection rates have declined nationally (18, 22). However, coincident with the 
231 
introduction of ABHR and high compliance, there has been a paradoxical nationwide increase in 
232 
VREfm and vancomycin susceptible Enterococcus faecium (VSEfm) infections (23).  
233 
In this study, we have shown recent clinical Efm isolates were significantly more alcohol-
234 
tolerant than their predecessors, and using our in vitro alcohol tolerance assay, date of isolation 
235 
rather than genotype is a better predictor of Efm survival. To obtain a practical dynamic range and 
236 
allow meaningful comparison between isolates, the tolerance assay used concentrations of alcohol 
237 
lower than the usual 70% v/v of most ABHR products. However, with our mouse gut colonization 
238 
model we were able to demonstrate that differences detected by this in vitro assay translated to an 
239 
increased likelihood of transmission for tolerant strains when subject to a full 70% isopropanol 
240 
surface disinfection intervention (Fig. 2).  As tolerance increases, we hypothesise that there will be 
241 
skin surfaces in contact with ABHR or inanimate surfaces in contact with other alcohol-based 
242 
cleaning agents that do not receive the maximum biocide concentration or contact time required for 
243 
effective bacterial killing. This idea is supported by our own previous clinical research using full 
244 
concentration ABHR in 20 human volunteers and two strains of VREfm (one ST17, one ST203, 
245 
Fig. 1B, C), and where we identified a mean 3·6-log10 reduction in VREfm on the hands of test 
246 
subjects, but very large inter-subject variance (24). For two volunteers, the reduction of VREfm was 
247 
less than 1·6-log10, suggesting that some host factors might not only result in VREfm containment

failure (or even “super-spreading”), but also enhance the clinical likelihood for selection of Efm 
249 
alcohol tolerance (24).  
250 
Until now there has been no assessment of alcohol tolerance in clinical E. faecium, but there 
251 
has been growing interest in tolerance to other biocides such as chlorhexidine, a second active agent 
252 
sometimes added to ABHR products (25, 26), including attempts to identify tolerance mechanisms 
253 
through mutagenesis screens that have pinpointed a specific two-component regulator (27). Alcohol 
254 
tolerance has been reported in other clinically relevant bacteria.  For example, studies have reported 
255 
the enhanced growth of Acinetobacter baumannii when exposed to low, non-lethal concentrations 
256 
of alcohol and ABHR, and increased pathogenicity following the addition of ethanol (14, 28).  
257 
Research on alcohol tolerance mechanisms employed by enterococci is scant. Data in this 
258 
field has been largely derived from studies of Gram-positive bacteria associated with spoilage of 
259 
sake, in particular the lactic acid bacteria that are known to survive and grow in ethanol 
260 
concentrations of greater than 18% (v/v) (29). The increase in tolerance over time displayed by 
261 
isolates in our study is consistent with the accumulation of mutations and genes that have shifted 
262 
the phenotype. Stepwise alcohol adaptation has been observed in laboratory experiments with a 
263 
related Gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, that eventually tolerated up to 8% 
264 
(w/v) ethanol (30).  For bacteria in general, short chain alcohols such as ethanol and isopropanol are 
265 
thought to kill by disrupting membrane functions (31, 32). The penetration of ethanol into the 
266 
hydrocarbon components of bacterial phospholipid bilayers causes the rapid release of intracellular 
267 
components and disorganisation of membranes (33). Metabolic engineering of solvent tolerant 
268 
bacteria has uncovered major mechanisms of tolerance, showing that membrane transporters are 
269 
critically important (31). For solvents like ethanol and isopropanol, potassium and proton 
270 
electrochemical membrane gradients are a general mechanism that enhances alcohol resistance 
271 
tolerance (34). 
272 
Our phylogenetic convergence and DAPC analyses in genetically independent Efm 
273 
populations identified changes in several genetic loci likely contributing to alcohol tolerance.

Specific mutagenesis for three regions confirmed these predictions, showing that multiple mutations 
275 
are required and loci involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism are likely under selection. 
276 
No one mutation showed a change in a killing assay after exposure to 25% (v/v) isopropanol (Fig. 
277 
4C), but significant differences were observed on growth rate in the presence of 3% (v/v) 
278 
isopropanol. The CDS (00501) encodes a putative major facilitator superfamily (MFS) galactoside 
279 
symporter and the SNP at position 519,608 (V264A) occurs within one of its 12 transmembrane 
280 
regions (Fig. 4B). We speculate that mutations such as V264A might help alter the membrane 
281 
proton gradient to favour a tolerant state (34).  In Gram-negative bacteria, transport systems are 
282 
known to be upregulated or required in response to exposure to short-chain alcohols (35, 36) and 
283 
bacterial MFS transporters specifically such as 00501 are frequently identified in screens for 
284 
proteins linked to increased solvent tolerance. However, the specific mechanisms by which they 
285 
promote tolerance are not understood  (31). The enrichment in alcohol tolerant Efm strains for PTS 
286 
loci is also noteworthy (Fig. 4). PTS are bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carbohydrate 
287 
PhosphoTransferase Systems (37). They catalyse the phosphorylation and transport of different 
288 
carbohydrates into the bacterial cell. However, there is a growing understanding that their various 
289 
regulatory roles are equally important as their sugar uptake functions (37). Interestingly, they have 
290 
also been implicated in solvent and stress tolerance. In E. coli, up regulation of a mannose-specific 
291 
PTS led to increased organic tolerance to n-hexane exposure (20) and in E. faecalis PTS loci appear 
292 
to be important for survival against low pH and oxidative stresses (38).  It's also noteworthy that 
293 
PTS loci are enriched in health care-associated E. faecium lineages, with specific systems 
294 
associated with GIT colonization, biofilm formation, and serum survival (39-42).  
295 
It is possible that the significant positive relationship between time and increasing alcohol 
296 
tolerance we report here (Fig. 1) is a response of the bacteria to increased exposure to alcohols in 
297 
ABHR and that the more tolerant strains are able to displace their less alcohol tolerant predecessors. 
298 
However, it is also conceivable that Efm are responding to another factor. For instance, modified or 
299 
acquired transport systems might be conferring acid tolerance, leading to improved survival during

passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Secondary phenotypes like alcohol tolerance are then co-
301 
selected, passenger phenomena, that together multiply the environmental hardiness of the pathogen. 
302 
Whatever the drivers, the development of alcohol tolerant strains of Efm has the potential to 
303 
significantly undermine the effectiveness of ABHR-based standard precautions, and may partly 
304 
explain the increase in VRE infection that is now widely reported in hospitals in Europe, Asia, the 
305 
Americas and Australia. ABHR remains an important general primary defence against cross-
306 
transmission of most microbial and some viral pathogens in health care settings. In hospitals with 
307 
endemic VRE, it would seem prudent to optimise adherence to ABHR protocols to ensure adequate 
308 
exposure times and use of sufficient volumes of ABHR product each time a healthcare worker 
309 
cleans their hands. In addition, consideration may need to be given to the use of various 
310 
formulations of ABHR (e.g. foams and gels) since they are known to have variable (generally 
311 
reduced) efficacy compared to solutions (43). Furthermore, extending active surveillance cultures 
312 
outside high risk areas of the hospital and return to strict contact precautions during outbreaks with 
313 
new emergent strains of VRE may be required to prevent widespread cross-contamination.

Alcohol tolerance assays and analysis.  
330 
In preliminary experiments, various concentrations of alcohol and Efm inoculum sizes were 
331 
assessed. At ‘full strength’ isopropanol (70%), killing was complete and resulted in greater than 8-
332 
log10 reductions in broth culture and an inability to detect differences between isolates. However, by 
333 
lowering the alcohol concentration in a stepwise fashion, we were able to identify a dynamic range 
334 
in which we observed marked differences in the time-kill curves between isolates. Guided by these 
335 
experiments and published literature (45) we then measured Efm survival after exposure to 23.0% 
336 
(v/v) isopropanol. Overnight cultures were grown in 10 mL of BHI medium (Difco, BD). After 
337 
overnight growth, each strain was diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) value of 0.5 
338 
using PBS. To 1 mL of the diluted culture, either 23% isopropanol (v/v) or 23% PBS was added 
339 
and samples were vigorously vortexed, followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature. 
340 
Immediately prior to sampling, each culture was again vortexed for 5 seconds and samples were 
341 
serially diluted between 10-1000 fold in 7.5% Tween80 in PBS (v/v) to inactivate alcohol killing 
342 
and to give a countable number of colonies on each plate (46). An automatic spiral plater (Don 
343 
Whitley) was used to plate 50 µl aliquots of an appropriate dilution of each strain in triplicate onto 
344 
BHI agar plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and colonies were counted using an 
345 
aCOLyte-3 colony counter (Synbiosis). The limit of detection with this technique was 6000 
346 
CFU/ml. For later isopropanol tolerance experiments with mutants, the above killing assay was 
347 
varied slightly such that that 1ml of 32.5% v/v (final concentration of 25% v/v) of isopropanol was 
348 
added to 300 µL of cells equating to an OD600nm of 1.66 (~8x107 CFU/ml). These experiments 
349 
were conducted as described above except spot plates (10µL of dilutions in triplicate) were 
350 
conducted instead of spiral plating plus additional sampling points were added (10 min and 15 min). 
351 
Biological replicates were performed for each isolate and average CFU values for cultures exposed

to isopropanol and those exposed to PBS (as a control) were obtained. From these data, a mean 
353 
log10 CFU reduction was calculated for each isolate by subtracting the log10 CFU remaining after 
354 
exposure to isopropanol from the mean log10 CFU of cultures treated with PBS. Differences in 
355 
population means for Efm isopropanol tolerance were explored using a Mann-Whitney test with a 
356 
two-tailed P-value. The null hypothesis (no difference between sample means) was rejected for 
357 
p<0.05.  Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v7.0b).  
358 
 
359 
Growth assays in the presence of isopropanol were performed as follows. Single colonies of Efm 
360 
were grown in BHI media overnight at 37°C with shaking. The bacterial cell culture concentration 
361 
was then standardised to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 3.5. Cells were diluted 10-fold in 
362 
BHI and 10 µL inoculated into 190 µl of BHI broth with or without 3% (v/v) isopropanol. Cells 
363 
were dispensed in 96-well plates, incubated at 37°C with agitation and the OD600 measured every 
364 
10 min over 24 hours using EnSight™ Multimode Plate Reader. The maximum doubling time was 
365 
determined by fitting local regression over intervals of 1 hour on growth curve data points and by 
366 
taking the maximum value of the fitted derivative using the R package cellGrowth 
367 
(www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cellGrowth.html). The growth rate for each 
368 
bacterial strain was determined from a minimum of three technical replicates for at least three 
369 
biological triplicate experiments.

Twenty-two of the isolates examined in the current study have been sequenced previously (47-49).

Genomic analysis and comparisons were performed using established bioinformatics methods that 
374 
involved assessing Efm population structure and defining core and accessory genomes. Whole 
375 
genome DNA sequences were obtained using either the Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq platforms, with 
376

380 
used as input for Bayesian analysis of population structure using hierBAPS v6.0 (51) and 
381 
phylogenetic inference using RaxML v8.2.11 (52). Whole genome alignments generated by Snippy 
382 
were used for subsequent assessment of recombination using ClonalFrameML (53). Pairwise SNP

were 
calculated 
using 
a

script 
(https://github.com/MDU-

PHL/pairwise_snp_differences). Genomes for each isolate were also assembled de novo using 
385 
Velvet v1.20.10 (54), with the resulting contigs annotated with Prokka v1.10 (55). A pan-genome 
386 
was generated by clustering the translated coding sequences predicted by Prokka using Proteinortho 
387 
(56) and visualized with Fripan (http://drpowell.github.io/FriPan/).

389 
In order to identify potentially causative variants while reducing the impact of lineage specific 
390 
effects, pairs of Efm isolates that exhibited greater than 1.5-fold alcohol tolerance difference and 
391 
less than 1,000 core genome SNP differences were examined. With these criteria, 19 pairs were 
392 
identified across the 129 isolates. Separate core genome comparisons were undertaken for each the 
393 
pair using Snippy. The resulting gff files of each within-pair comparison were intersected using 
394 
bedtools v2.26.0 (57) and inspected on the Ef_aus0233 chromosome in Geneious Pro (version 
395 
8.1.8, Biomatters Ltd. [www.geneious.com]). 
396 
 
397 
The potential role of gene content variation in the alcohol tolerant phenotype was examined by 
398 
using a supervised probabilistic approach to assess the contributions of gene presence/absence at 
399 
separating between sensitive and tolerant isolates. Here, an alignment of accessory genome 
400 
orthologs was used as input for the generation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component 
401 
(DAPC) model using the R package adegenet v2.0.1 (58). DAPC is a linear discriminant analysis 
402 
(LDA) that accommodates discrete genetic-based predictors by transforming the genetic data into 
403 
continuous Principal Components (PC) and building predictive classification models. The PCs are

Mouse models of Efm gut colonization. 
408 
Animal experimentation adhered to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council 
409 
Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and was approved by and performed 
410 
in accordance with the University of Melbourne AEC (Application: 1413341.3). Female Balb/C 
411 
mice (6-8 weeks old) were used to develop the VREfm and VSEfm gut colonization models. For 
412 
VREfm colonization, mice were provided drinking water ad libitum containing 250mg/L 
413 
vancomycin for 7 days before VREfm exposure. For VSEfm colonization, after dosing with 
414 
vancomycin as above, mice were then provided drinking water with ampicillin containing 
415 
(250mg/L) for a further 7 days. Before exposure of the animals to VREfm or VSEfm, fecal pellets 
416 
were collected from each mouse to check their Efm status. Briefly, at least two fecal pellets from 
417 
each mouse were collected and cultured in 10 mL tryptone soy broths (TSB) in a 37-degree shaker 
418 
for overnight. The cultured broths were then inoculated onto VRE-chrome agar plates for VREfm 
419 
screening or enterococcosel agar plates for enterococci screening. After 1 week of antibiotic pre-
420 
treatment, the mice were dosed by oral gavage with a 200 µL volume of Efm. The bacteria were 
421 
prepared by culturing overnight in TSB at 37°C with shaking. Bacteria were harvested by 
422 
centrifugation and washed 3x with sterile distilled water and diluted in sterile distilled water as 
423 
required before use.

425 
The Efm IVC cage cross-contamination assays were performed in a blinded manner. Bacterial 
426 
suspensions prepared as described above, were normalized to an OD600 0.37 (~1×108 CFU/mL) and 
427 
diluted with sterile distilled water to ~1×106 CFU/mL. Each cage was then completely flooded with 
428 
10 mL of diluted Efm suspension. Seven millilitres of the suspension were removed from the 
429 
inundated cage floor. The contaminated cages were left in the biosafety cabinet for 1.5 hours to dry.

and provided with appropriate antibiotics in the drinking water. Fecal pellets were collected from 
436 
each mouse after 7 days to check the Efm colonization status as described above. CD50 values were 
437 
calculated by interpolation using the non-linear regression and curve-fitting functions in GraphPad 
438 
Prism (v7.0b).

Allelic exchange mutagenesis in Efm.  
441 
To delete a plasmid encoded region encoding a PTS system (6.5kb) and a symporter from the 
442 
chromosome (1kb), first deletion constructs were PCR amplified (Phusion polymerase - New 
443 
England Bioabs) (Table S1) from Ef_aus0233 genomic DNA. The construct included 1kb of DNA 
444 
up/downstream of the region to be deleted and was joined by SOE-PCR. Gel extracted amplimers 
445 
were cloned into pIMAY-Z (59) by SLiCE (60). Electrocompetent cells of Ef_aus0233 were made 
446 
using the method of Zhang et al (61). Purified plasmid (1 µg) was electroporated, with cells 
447 
selected on BHI agar containing chloramphenicol 10 µg/ml at 30ºC for 2-3 days. Allelic exchange 
448 
was conducted as described (59) except cells were single colony purified twice pre (30ºC) and post 
449 
(37ºC) integration. While Efm exhibit intrinsic beta-galactosidase activity, cells containing pIMAY-
450 
Z could be differentiated from pIMAY-Z cured cells after 24h at 37ºC. To complement the 
451 
symporter deletion mutant, the wild type allele for the symporter (amplified with the A/D primers 
452 
and cloned into pIMAY-Z) was recombined into the symporter deletion mutant. All mutants and 
453 
complemented strains were whole genome sequenced to ensure no secondary mutations cofounded 
454 
the analysis.

Isolation of spontaneous rpoB mutants in Ef_aus0233. 
457 
An overnight BHI culture of Ef_aus0233 was concentrated 10-fold and 100 µL was spread plated 
458 
onto BHI agar containing 200µg/ml of rifampicin. A total of three potential rpoB mutants were 
459 
screened by Etest for stable rifampicin resistance. All were resistant to above 32 µg/mL rifampicin. 
460 
The strains were subjected to whole genome sequencing and single mutations were identified in the 
461 
rpoB gene with one mapping to aa position 481, representing the H481Y substitution.
