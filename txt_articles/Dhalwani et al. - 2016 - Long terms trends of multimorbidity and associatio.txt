Abstract
Background: Multimorbidity has become one of the main challenges in the recent years for patients, health care
providers and the health care systems globally. However, literature describing the burden of multimorbidity in the
elderly population, especially longitudinal trends is very limited. Physical activity is recommended as one of the
main lifestyle changes in the prevention and management of multiple chronic diseases worldwide; however, the
evidence on its association with multimorbidity remains inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to assess the longitudinal
trends of multimorbidity and the association between multimorbidity and physical activity in a nationally representative
cohort of the English population aged ≥50 years between 2002 and 2013.
Methods: We used data on 15,688 core participants from six waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, with
complete information on physical activity. Self-reported physical activity was categorised as inactive, mild, moderate
and vigorous levels of physical activity. We calculated the number of morbidities and the prevalence of multimorbidity
(more than 2 chronic conditions) between 2002 and 2013 overall and by levels of self-reported physical activity. We
estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for multimorbidity by each category of physical
activity, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results: There was a progressive decrease over time in the proportion of participants without any chronic conditions
(33.9 % in 2002/2003 vs. 26.8 % in 2012/2013). In contrast, the prevalence of multimorbidity steadily increased over time
(31.7 % in 2002/2003 vs. 43.1 % in 2012/2013). Compared to the physically inactive group, the OR for multimorbidity
was 0.84 (95 % CI 0.78 to 0.91) in mild, 0.61 (95 % CI 0.56 to 0.66) in moderate and 0.45 (95 % CI 0.41 to 0.49) in the
vigorous physical activity group.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated an inverse dose-response association between levels of physical activity and
multimorbidity, however, given the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity over time, there is a need to explore causal
associations between physical activity and multimorbidity and its impact as a primary prevention strategy to prevent
the occurrence of chronic conditions later in life and reduce the burden of multimorbidity.

 Background
Multimorbidity has become one of the main challenges
in the recent years for patients, health care providers
and the health care systems globally. Patients with multi-
morbidity have more complex health care needs and are
more likely to have poorer health outcomes and lower
quality of life [1] thereby increasing the health care costs
associated with it [2]. To address the burden of multimor-
bidity, it is crucial to characterise the problem. However,
literature describing the burden of multimorbidity in the
elderly population reports a wide range of prevalence
estimates (7 to 99 %) [3–13]. Moreover, most of these
studies are cross-sectional and only one study from
the Netherlands far has assessed the long term trends
in multimorbidity between 1985 and 2005, which is
now over a decade old [9].
Physical activity (PA) is recommended as one of the
main lifestyle changes in the prevention and manage-
ment of multiple chronic diseases worldwide [14]; how-
ever, the association between PA and multimorbidity has
not been extensively studied and the existing evidence
remains inconclusive. Two cross-sectional studies from
Europe found a statistically significant between multi-
morbidity and physical activity in men but not women
[15, 16]. Contrarily, two surveys from Canada based on
16,782 participants between 18 and 69 years and 1,196
participants over 45 years, found no statistically significant
association between PA and multimorbidity [11, 17].
Given the inconsistencies in multimorbidity estimates and
association with PA we aimed to assess the longitudinal
trends of multimorbidity between 2002 and 2013 and the
association between multimorbidity and PA in a nationally
representative community based cohort of English popula-
tion aged ≥50 years.
Methods
Data source and study population
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is an
ongoing panel study of a nationally representative cohort
of the English population aged ≥50 years. For the first
wave of ELSA (2002–2003) participants were recruited
from households that were included in the Health Sur-
vey for England in 1998, 1999 or 2001 (wave 0) [18].
The total sample for the first wave consisted for 11,391
core members [18] out of which 8,780 participants were
followed in 2004/05 (wave 2). To maintain the represen-
tation of people between 50 and 53 years, refreshment
samples were added in 2006/7 (wave 3), 2008/9 (wave 4),
and 2012/13 (wave 6), making the total numbers of core
participants for wave 3-6 to be 8,810; 9,886; 9,090 and
9,169 respectively. In addition to the follow-up assess-
ment every two years, health examinations through
nurses visit take place every four years (wave 2, 4, 6). For
a detailed description of the flow of participants through
ELSA please refer to the cohort profile [18]. ELSA has
been shown to be broadly representative of the English
population in terms of the sociodemographics [18]. In
order to maintain the representation of people between
50 and 53 years, refreshment samples were added at
waves 3, 4 and 6. The total number of core members
interviewed at wave 6 was 9,169 [19]. ELSA collects a
wide range of data on the elderly population including
demographic and economic data, physical and mental
health, psychosocial wellbeing, physical and cognitive
function and a range of blood assays. Ethical approval
for all ELSA waves was obtained from NHS Research
Ethics Committees under the National Research and Ethics
Service (NRES) and participants gave full informed written
consent to participate in the study [20].
Physical activity
At each wave participants were asked about the fre-
quency of vigorous, moderate and mild PA (more than
once per week, once per week, one to three times per
month, or hardly ever) using show cards to help classify
the intensity of each activity [20]. We categorised PA
into four groups based on the classification in other
ELSA studies [21, 22] i.e. inactive, only mild activity at
least once a week, at least moderate but no vigorous ac-
tivity at least once a week and any vigorous activity at
least once a week. Mild activities included laundry and
home repairs; moderate activities included gardening,
cleaning the car, moderate pace walking, dancing, floor
or stretching exercises etc. and vigorous activities in-
cluded running or jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics
or gym workouts, tennis etc [21]. Participants with miss-
ing information on PA were dropped from the cohort.
Multimorbidity
ELSA collects self-reported information on doctor diag-
nosed diabetes, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction,
congestive heart failure, angina, lung disease, asthma, arth-
ritis, osteoporosis, cancer, hearing problems, Parkinson’s
disease, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and eye conditions
including macular degeneration and glaucoma. Chronic
conditions such as diabetes have been validated in ELSA
using objective biomedical data collected as part of the
nurse visits [22]. We defined multimorbidity as presence of
two or more of these conditions at any given time during
the follow-up.
Other covariates
We also extracted data on other covariates that have
been shown to be associated with the development of
chronic conditions and PA. These included age (categorised
in 10 year age bands), sex, ethnicity (white, non-white and
missing), total non-pension net wealth in quintile as a
proxy measurement of socioeconomic status, smoking

 status (smoker, non-smoker), frequency of alcohol con-
sumption in the past year (not at all, occasionally, once or
twice a month, once or twice a week, at least three days a
week, missing) and body mass index (BMI, categorised as
underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal (≥18.5 and <25 kg/m2),
overweight (≥25 and < 30 kg/m2), obese (≥30 kg/m2) and
missing). BMI information was only collected at nurse
visits at wave 0, 2, 4 and 6. For waves 1, 3 and 5 if there
was a BMI recording in the preceding and subsequent
waves then an average of the two BMI recordings was im-
puted. If there was no BMI recording in the preceding and
subsequent waves then BMI was considered missing.
Statistical analysis
We described general characteristics among participants
in each wave using medians, interquartile ranges and
proportions. We calculated the prevalence of each
chronic condition separately for each wave and the five
most common combinations of chronic conditions in
the multimorbid population for each wave. We calcu-
lated the number of morbidities overall and by levels of
PA, standardised by age and sex taking the sampling
weights in to account. We then estimated age and sex
standardised prevalence of multimorbidity for each wave
as the number of participants with ≥2 conditions divided
by the total number of participants in each wave, taking
the cross sectional weights into account and stratifying
by levels of PA. These prevalence estimates were plotted
graphically to visualise long term time trends. We used a
generalised estimation equation (GEE) model with an
exchangeable correlation structure and calculated the
odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs)
for multimorbidity by each category of PA, adjusting for
age, ethnicity, total non-pension net wealth, smoking
status, alcohol consumption and BMI. All analyses were
conducted in STATA 12 MP [23].
Sensitivity analyses
People with higher levels of vigorous activity each week
may also have high levels of moderate and mild activity.
Therefore, we created three additional models for each
level of physical activity excluding the other two and
recalculated the effect estimates. Also since some studies
have used the cut-off point as three or more chronic
conditions to define multimorbidity we repeated our
main analysis changing our definition of multimorbidity
from two or more chronic conditions to three or more
chronic conditions. The addition of refreshment samples
(age 50–53) added at waves 3, 4 and 6 may potentially
result in slight underestimation of the prevalence. Thus,
we restricted the study population to the core members
from wave 1 and recalculated the prevalence of multimor-
bidity overall and by levels of PA and also recalculated the
OR for multimorbidity by each category of PA.
Results
General characteristics of the study population
A total of 15,783 participants contributed data to ELSA
(wave 1–6) out of which 50 % contributed data to at
least 3 waves. Out of these, information on PA was avail-
able for 15,688 participants who were included in this
study. Table 1 presents the general characteristics of the
study population for each wave. The median age of partic-
ipants at baseline was 64 years (interquartile range (IQR)
56–73 years) and increased to 66 years (IQR 60–75 years)
at wave 6. Just over half of the participants in each wave
were females and the proportion of non-white participants
was under 5 % in all the waves. 17.9 % of the participants
were smokers at baseline which reduced to 14.1 % at wave
6 and approximately one third of the participants were
overweight. Just under half of the study population in each
wave reported some kind of moderate PA at least once a
week and over a quarter engaged in vigorous PA at least
once a week.
Description of morbidities
Overall, there was a slight progressive decrease in the
proportion of participants without any chronic condi-
tions over time i.e. 33.9 % in 2002/3 compared to 26.8 %
in 2012/13. In contrast, the proportion of participants
with chronic morbidities increased steadily over time
such that the proportion of participants with five or
more morbidities was 0.9 % in 2002/3 compared to
3.9 % in 2012/13 (Fig. 1). The proportion of participants
with a greater number of morbidities reduced consistently
with increasing levels of PA in each wave. In 2002/3 the
proportion of participants with five or more morbidities in
the physically inactive group was 3.5 % compared to
0.03 % in the vigorous PA group; correspondent propor-
tions in 2012/13 were 10.6 % in the physically inactive
group compared to 0.6 % in the vigorous PA group. Gen-
erally, hypertension and arthritis were the most common
chronic condition in each wave (~30 %) followed by dia-
betes (~9 %), asthma (~8 %) and lung disease (~6 %)
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Among the participants with
multimorbidity in each wave, the most common combin-
ation was hypertension and arthritis (>40 % of multimor-
bid participants), followed by diabetes and hypertension
and asthma and arthritis in general (Additional file 2:
Table S2). Although, there were slight differences in the
most prevalent disease pairs within waves, the overall pat-
tern remained very similar with most pairs comprising of
hypertension, diabetes, arthritis and asthma.
Multimorbidity over time and variations by physical activity
The prevalence of multimorbidity was 31.7 % (95 % CI
30.9–32.6) in 2002/3 and increased steadily over time to
43.1 % (95 % CI 42.1–44.1) in 2012/13. There was a
clear gradient in the prevalence of multimorbidity by

 PA. Figure 2 presents the prevalence of multimorbidity
over time by levels of PA. For the physically inactive
group the prevalence of multimorbidity in 2002/3 was
much higher at 50.9 % (95 % CI 47.9–54.0) which in-
creased to 67.7 % (95 % CI 63.6–71.5) in 2012/13. In
comparison, the prevalence of multimorbidity for the
vigorous PA group was 20.7 % (95 % CI 19.1–22.4) at
baseline and increased only to 30.3 % (95 % CI 28.1–32.7)
in 2012/13 which was less than the multimorbidity preva-
lence in the physically inactive group at baseline.

 We found a dose-response association between the
levels of PA and multimorbidity. Compared to the phys-
ically inactive group, the multivariable-adjusted odds of
multimorbidity reduced by 16, 39 and 55 % in the mild,
moderate and vigorous PA groups respectively (p-value
for trend <0.001) (Fig. 3).
Sensitivity analyses
The effect of physical activity sustained when each PA
group was compared separately to physically inactive group
excluding the other two PA groups. The magnitude of ef-
fect for mild PA slightly increased whilst the magnitude of
effect for moderate and vigorous PA slightly decreased.
After excluding any mild or moderate PA, performing vig-
orous PA at least once a week was found to reduce the
odds of multimorbidity by 43 %(OR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.49–
0.65) compared to the physically inactive group. The odds
of multimorbidity reduced by 28 % (OR 0.72, 95 % CI
0.69–0.75) in the moderate PA group and 21 % in the mild
PA group (OR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.75–0.83) after excluding the
other two activity groups from the analysis (Fig. 4).
The prevalence of multimorbidity for each wave reduced
by about 50 % when a more restrictive definition of multi-
morbidity (≥3 conditions) was used such that the prevalence
of multimorbidity in 2002/3 was 11.7 % (95 % CI 11.1–12.3)
in 2002/3 compared to 21.5 % (95 % CI 20.7–22.4) in
2012/3 (Additional file 3: Figure S1). Multimorbidity was
still found to be associated with PA such that compared to
the physically inactive group, the multivariable-adjusted
odds of multimorbidity reduced by 17, 47 and 62 % in the
mild, moderate and vigorous PA groups respectively
(p-value for trend <0.001) (Additional file 4: Figure S2).
When the analysis was restricted to the core participants
from the initial wave (11,298), the increase in the prevalence
of multimorbidity over time was slightly more pronounced,
increasing to 52.0 % (95 % CI 50.7–53.3) in 2012/13 com-
pared to 37.6 % (95 % CI 36.7–38.4) in 2002/3 Additional file
5: Figure S3). Nevertheless, the gradient in the prevalence of
multimorbidity by PA and the ORs remained the same.
Discussion
Principal findings
This study found that multimorbidity has increased
steadily over time in the elderly English population (an
increase of about 11 % between 2002 and 2013). We also
found an inverse dose-response relationship between
multimorbidity and levels of PA such that the odds of
multimorbidity in people engaged in vigorous, moderate
and mild PA at least once a week were 55, 39 and 16 %
lower respectively, compared to physically inactive people.
Strengths and limitations
Using a large population-based data source, we present
longitudinal and contemporaneous estimates on multi-
morbidity; to our knowledge, this is the first study investi-
gating longitudinal trends of multimorbidity in the UK
and one of the very few to assess the association between
multimorbidity and levels of PA. Due to the large scale
and multi-purpose nature of ELSA chronic disease diag-
noses are based on self-reports of physician diagnoses.
However, the validity of some self-reported chronic dis-
ease diagnosis in ELSA has been demonstrated previously
[24]. We further compared some of the individual chronic

 found moderate to good agreement between the two for
conditions like diabetes, hypertension, stroke, asthma,
COPD, osteoporosis, cancer, Parkinson’s disease etc [27].
Our estimates of multimorbidity may also have been
affected by loss-to-follow up over the study time and
inclusion of refreshment samples at different waves.
Nevertheless, when the analyses were restricted to
core participants from the initial wave our results
remained unchanged. Our definition of multimorbidity
only relied on the number of conditions with no account
of disease severity. Nonetheless, in light of the lack of a
standard definition of multimorbidity, we used the most
common definition used in epidemiological studies i.e.
presence of two or more chronic conditions and also
restricted the definition to three or more conditions and
found the results to be similar. Using a GEE model we cal-
culated population-average estimates for the association
between PA and multimorbidity; there is a potential for
reverse causation and our results could arguably be inter-
preted as the presence of multimorbidity limiting physical
activity in the population. There are also limitations with
our exposure assessment. Firstly, information on PA is
also self-reported in ELSA. Nevertheless, PA measures in
ELSA have been validated for a subset of population using
accelerometer data where self-reported PA was found to
be moderately correlated with objectively assessed hours
per day of moderate to vigorous PA [28]. In contrast, stud-
ies comparing self-reported PA measures to objectively
measured PA found that older adults tend to over-report
their PA, and vigorous activities are likely to be recalled
more accurately than non-vigorous activities [29, 30]. If
this were true for ELSA participants, we may have over-
estimated the intensity of PA and consequently underesti-
mated the association between PA and multimorbidity.
Secondly, our classification of PA is based on the best case
scenario taking the more intense PA routine for partici-
pants. However, when each activity group was analysed
separately the effects still sustained with the highest pro-
tective effect in the vigorous activity group followed by
moderate and mild PA. Lastly, the frequencies of mild,
moderate and vigorous physical activity were only re-
ported in categories and not true frequencies therefore we
could not calculate the total minutes of PA per week to
assess whether these participants met the WHO and
national PA recommendations [14, 31].
Interpretation in light of current literature
The paucity of nationally representative longitudinal
studies on multimorbidity makes it difficult to compare
our estimates to the current literature. To our knowledge
the only study to assess longitudinal trends of multimor-
bidity prevalence was conducted in the Netherlands using
continuous morbidity registration data and including
13,500 people between 1985 and 2005. The prevalence of
multimoribidity was found to have doubled between 1985
and 2005. However, the percentage of patients with one to
three conditions remained stable at about 30 % between
2003 and 2005 which is in agreement with our findings
(2002/3 prevalence: 31.7 %, 2004/5 prevalence: 33.1 %) [9].
A study based on 12,611 people aged ≥65 years from
the Canadian National Population Health Survey (CNPHS)
found that frequent PA (defined as moderate PA lasting at
least 15 min, performed ≥12 times a month) reduced the
odds of the presence of chronic conditions (13 conditions
included) by 9 % (OR 0.91, 95 % CI 0.89–0.93) [32]. Simi-
larly, we found that compared to physically inactive group
the odds of multimorbidity was reduced by 39 % in the
moderate PA group. The higher effect estimate in our
study compared to the CNPHS results can be attributed to
the different definition of PA exposure. Furthermore, the
CNPHS assessed presence of any chronic disease as their
outcome which is different than our outcome. In contrast,
a study using survey data from 1007 peopled aged 65–94

 years from Germany found a 27 % reduction in the odds of
multimoribidity for every 1 SD increase in PASE scores in
males but no significant association between multimoribid-
ity and PASE score in females. No gender interaction was
found in our study (p-value for interaction = 0.546). Two
surveys from Canada found consistently negative results
contradictory to findings from our study [11, 17]. Direct
comparisons to these studies are difficult due to the differ-
ences in study population, measures of PA and definitions
of multimorbidity. Nevertheless our study supports a clear
dose-response relationship between levels of PA and multi-
morbidity in geriatric English population. This association
seems biologically plausible as routine physical activity has
been shown to reduce abdominal adiposity and systemic
inflammation; enhance lipid profiles, endothelial and car-
diac function; improve glucose homeostasis, insulin sensi-
tivity and coronary blood flow [33]. All of these factors
may directly or indirectly explain the inverse association
between physical activity and multimorbidity.
Conclusion and Implications
The prevalence of multimorbidity in older adults is
steadily increasing over time. The current models of care
globally are based on the management of individual
chronic conditions. However, given the increase in mul-
timoribidity over the past 10 years and the complex
needs of these patients clinical guidelines need to ad-
dress the challenges in management of multimoribidity
and formulate best practices to guide clinical decision
making for multimorbid patients. The World Health
Organisation recommends that older adults should do at
least 150 min of moderate-intensity PA during the week
or at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity PA during the
week or an equivalent combination of both [14], al-
though, a small proportion of people comply with these
recommendations. This study demonstrated an inverse
dose-response association between levels of physical
activity and multimorbidity; however, there is a need to
explore causal associations between physical activity and
multimorbidity and its impact as a primary prevention
strategy to prevent the occurrence of chronic conditions
later in life and reduce the burden of multimorbidity.
