Abstract Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) plays fundamental roles in
synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory. Here, we describe a new recessive
neurodevelopmental syndrome with global developmental delay, seizures and intellectual disability.
Using linkage analysis and exome sequencing, we found that this disease maps to chromosome
5q31.1-q34 and is caused by a biallelic germline mutation in CAMK2A. The missense mutation, p.
His477Tyr is located in the CAMK2A association domain that is critical for its function and
localization. Biochemically, the p.His477Tyr mutant is defective in self-oligomerization and unable
to assemble into the multimeric holoenzyme.In vivo, CAMK2AH477Y failed to rescue neuronal
defects in C. elegans lacking unc-43, the ortholog of human CAMK2A. In vitro, neurons derived
from patient iPSCs displayed profound synaptic defects. Together, our data demonstrate that a
recessive germline mutation in CAMK2A leads to neurodevelopmental defects in humans and
suggest that dysfunctional CAMK2 paralogs may contribute to other neurological disorders.

Introduction
Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) is a calcium-activated serine/threonine
kinase that is extremely abundant in the brain, comprising as much as 0.3% of the total brain protein
content (Bennett et al., 1983). CAMK2 is highly enriched at the synapses and is necessary for the

 process of long-term potentiation (LTP), the activity-dependent strengthening and modulation of
synaptic activity that is thought to be the molecular basis of some forms of learning and memory
(Kandel et al., 2014; Lisman et al., 2002). In humans, there are four genes encoding distinct
CAMK2 iso-enzymes. CAMK2A and CAMK2B are the predominant isoforms in the nervous system,
with CAMK2A being expressed 3–4 times higher than CAMK2B (Hanson and Schulman, 1992).
Each enzyme comprises a kinase domain, a regulatory domain and an association domain. Structur-
ally CAMK2 holoenzymes are homo- or hetero-oligomers, consisting of 12 or 14 CAMK2 subunits
(Hudmon and Schulman, 2002b). The holoenzyme assembly requires the carboxy-terminal associa-
tion domain, which forms stacked pairs of hexameric or heptameric rings with the regulatory and
kinase domain projecting radially to interact with other essential proteins for CAMK2 function and
localization (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). In the absence of calcium signalling, CAMK2 is inactive, as
the regulatory domain inhibits kinase function (Yang and Schulman, 1999). This auto-inhibition is
relieved when calcium-loaded calmodulin binds to the regulatory domain, thereby exposing the
kinase domain and allowing it to phosphorylate target substrates (Meador et al., 1993). Ca2+-Cal-
modulin binding also exposes Thr286 on the regulatory domain of CAMK2A, which becomes phos-
phorylated in trans by adjacent subunits. Once this residue is phosphorylated, the enzyme is
persistently active, even in the absence of continual Ca2+-Calmodulin signaling (Rich and Schulman,
1998; Stratton et al., 2013). This switch from auto-inhibition to autonomous, persistent activity is
thought to constitute a biochemical form of memory, which marks the neuron for having experi-
enced a previous calcium influx (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016; Stratton et al., 2014; Stratton et al.,
2013).
Mice that are homozygous null for CAMK2A are viable and display impaired spatial memory and
reduced LTP in the hippocampus (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b). The heterozygous mutant (Camk2a+/-)
show a significant deficit in spatial working memory and contextual fear memory (Frankland et al.,
2001; Matsuo et al., 2009). More recently, it was demonstrated that mice with neuron-specific
eLife digest Each year, some children are born with developmental disorders and intellectual
disabilities. These conditions are often caused by mutations in specific genes. Sometimes both
copies of a gene – one inherited from each parent – need to be mutated for the symptoms to
develop. These mutations are known as recessive mutations.
Here, Chia, Zhong, Niwa et al. diagnosed two siblings in their clinical care with a new form of
neurological disease that affects the development of the brain and leads to frequent seizures. To
test whether the young patients shared a genetic mutation that could explain their condition, the
researchers analyzed the DNA of the children and compared the results with the DNA from their
parents and healthy siblings. The results showed that the two children with the condition had
inherited a recessive mutation in a gene called CAMK2A. The protein this gene encodes helps nerve
cells to form connections and communicate with each other, and it has been shown to be essential
for learning and memory.
The CAMK2A enzyme is made up of several identical subunits that form a complex. Chia et al.
discovered that the mutation prevented these subunits from joining together properly, resulting in a
faulty protein. CAMK2A and other related proteins are crucial for the health of the brain in a wide
range of animals. Indeed, experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans, a roundworm commonly used to
study neurons, confirmed that the mutation inherited by the children indeed caused similar
neurological defects in the worms. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the children’s
condition is caused by the mutation in both copies of the CAMK2A gene.
For patients born with inherited diseases, it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly which mutation is
responsible for the specific disorder. These findings could therefore help pediatric geneticists
recognize this newly defined syndrome and reach the correct diagnoses. These results could also be
the starting point for studies that look into restoring the activity of the defective CAMK2A protein.
More broadly, identifying genes that are critical for the healthy development of the brain could shed
light on common neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and autism.

 conditional knock-out of CAMK2A similarly displayed learning deficits and defects in LTP that were
comparable to the complete knockout mice (Achterberg et al., 2014). These findings suggest that
neuron-intrinsic CAMK2A function is indispensable during the period of learning for memory forma-
tion. CAMK2 is conserved in invertebrates, such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans, where the
kinase also plays critical roles in behavioral and cognitive traits (Cho et al., 1991; Hudmon and
Schulman, 2002a; Reiner et al., 1999; Rongo and Kaplan, 1999). In C. elegans, the only CAMK2 is
encoded by the unc-43 gene, which is essential for synaptic function (Rongo and Kaplan, 1999).
Loss of unc-43 causes worms to have flaccid muscle tone, locomotion defects and spontaneous
body contractions that resemble seizures (Reiner et al., 1999).
In pediatric care, global developmental delay in infants is defined as a significant functional
delay in two or more developmental domains including gross and fine motor function, speech and
language, cognition, social development and personal skills (Quality Standards Subcommittee of
the American Academy of Neurology et al., 2003). These defects are detected at an early age
in children age five years or under, and can persist throughout life (Shevell, 2008). About 25–50%
of identified case are caused by germline genetic changes, including chromosomal abnormalities,
copy number variants and monogenic mutations (Srour and Shevell, 2014; van Bokhoven, 2011).
For many patients with global neuro-developmental delay, the genetic etiology remains unknown.
Results
Here, we report the identification of a consanguineous family from Jordan with two affected children
manifesting global neuro-developmental delay with frequent seizures and convulsions. The two
affected siblings had no dysmorphic features but failed to develop the ability to walk or speak
(Figure 1A,B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). They displayed progressive psychomotor retarda-
tion with hypotonic muscles (Supplemental Material, Videos 1 and 2). Electroencephalogram (EEG)
analysis revealed abnormal epileptiform transients (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B),
consistent with frequent myoclonic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed no
major structural defects in the brain of proband II:4 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Serum
metabolite levels were normal, ruling out potential lysosomal storage disorders.
Assuming autosomal recessive inheritance, we performed identity-by-descent (IBD) homozygos-
ity mapping using genomic DNA from both parents, two affected probands and three healthy sib-
lings. Only one candidate locus greater than 5 cM on chromosome 5 spanning 28 Mb was
delineated (Figure 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Whole-exome sequencing was subse-
quently performed on index case II:1. After filtering for variants with low quality and low sequenc-
ing coverage, 72 homozygous variants were identified, out of which four lie within the Chr. 5 IBD
region (Table 1). Three of the homozygous variants had been previously annotated as known poly-
morphisms with minor allele frequencies > 0.0001. In addition, healthy individuals who are homo-
zygous for the minor alleles had been identified in genomic sequencing databases such as dbSNP
and gnomAD (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). We therefore filtered out these variants as non-
pathogenic. The fourth homozygous variant within the IBD region mapped to the CAMK2A gene
(MIM: 114078), resulting in a missense mutation p.His477Tyr that has never been observed in pre-
vious large-scale sequencing databases and our in-house ethnically-matched cohort (Figure 1E,
Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Using Sanger sequencing, this private mutation was confirmed
to segregate with the disease in all seven family members (Figure 1A,D).
CAMK2A is a neuron-specific, highly abundant serine/threonine kinase that plays critical roles in
synaptic plasticity. To understand how neuronal function is affected due to the mutation in CAMK2A,
we reprogrammed primary dermal fibroblasts from patient II.4 into iPSCs, differentiated them into
neurons and measured population-level neuronal activity using a multi-electrode array (MEA) system
(Figure 2A). Compared to H1 embryonic stem cell derived neurons and an unrelated CAMK2A wild-
type iPSC control, the patient’s iPSCs were equally efficient in differentiating into mature neurons
expressing neuronal markers TUJ1 and MAP2 after 21 days of in vitro differentiation (Figure 2B).
When these differentiated neurons were plated on MEA plates to measure spontaneous action
potentials, we observed a significant reduction in both the total number of spontaneous spikes
(Figure 2C, left) and the mean firing rate (Figure 2C, right) in the patient-derived neurons harboring
the p.H477Y mutation compared to the wild-type controls, suggesting that CAMK2AH477Y causes a
profound functional defect in cultured neurons.

 The CAMK2A enzyme consists of an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain, a Ca2+-calmodulin-
binding regulatory domain and a C-terminal association domain (AD) that is necessary for the
assembly of the 12- or 14-subunit holoenzyme. The identified mutation, p.H477Y is located in the
association domain (Figure 1E) and affects a histidine residue that is invariant across all vertebrate
and invertebrate CAMK2A homologues. It is also conserved in other human CAMK2 paralogs with
a similar association domain such as CAMK2B, CAMK2D and CAMK2G (Figure 3A, Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 1A). In addition, this mutation is predicted to be deleterious by both SIFT, Poly-
Phen and MCAP algorithms. Structurally, His477 is located at the dimeric interface that forms part
of the extensive interaction surface at the ‘equatorial’ plane of the CAMK2A holoenzyme
(Figure 3B). Based on prior findings that CAMK2A oligomerization through its association domain
is indispensable for substrate phosphorylation and synaptic localization (Bhattacharyya et al.,

 2016), we hypothesize that the p.H477Y allele
is hypomorphic and that biallelic loss-of-func-
tion in CAMK2A is the direct cause for the neu-
rodevelopmental
phenotypes
in
the
two
probands.
To measure the oligomerization potential of
the CAMK2AH477Y mutant in cells, we tran-
siently
expressed
FLAG-tagged
wild-type
CAMK2A and CAMK2AH477Y mutant in 293 T
cells,
which
do
not
express
endogenous
CAMK2A. A third mutant CAMK2AH477X, which
lacks amino acids 477–489 and thus encodes a
truncated association domain, was used as an
additional control. Using native lysis conditions
that
preserve
non-covalent
macromolecular
interactions, we found that wild-type CAMK2A
forms a prominent complex with an apparent
molecular weight ~1 MDa (Figure 3C, Native-
PAGE,
lane
2),
which
is
consistent
with
the
12-
or
14-
subunit
CAMK2A
holoenzyme
(Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). As compared to wild-type CAMK2A, the ~1 MDa, putatively oligo-
meric species was drastically reduced for the p.H477Y mutant and was undetectable for the p.
H477X mutant (Figure 3C, Native-PAGE, lane 3 and 4 vs. lane 2). Next, we examined the ability
of in vitro translated CAMK2A to self-oligomerize in a cell-free system. In contrast to the negative
control
protein
GFP,
wild-type
FLAG-CAMK2A
efficiently
co-immunoprecipitated
with
HA-
CAMK2A (Figure 3D, Lane 10 vs 11). This self-association was preserved between CAMK2AWT
and CAMK2AH477Y (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 15), but was completely lost between wild-type
CAMK2A and the p.H477X mutant (Figure 3D, lane 13). In contrast, we could not detect any self-
association between FLAG- CAMK2AH477Y and HA- CAMK2AH477Y (Figure 3D, Lane 16). Taken
together, these results suggest that the missense p.H477Y partially disrupts the self-association
between identical CAMK2A molecules, which had been shown to be required for holoenzyme
assembly. The partial loss of function of the p.H477Y mutant, as compared to a more severe
mutation p.H477X, is consistent with the observed autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease
in the family, where the heterozygous carriers do not display apparent neuro-developmental
symptoms.
During the course of this analysis, we noticed that both p.H477Y and p.H477X mutants had
reduced protein abundance. This effect on the p.H477Y mutant was, however, subtle and could not
readily explain the difference in the CAMK2A oligomer observed in the native gel (Figure 3C, SDS-
PAGE). As it is known that in general fully assembled oligomeric complexes have enhanced stability
in vivo compared to partially assembled complexes with disrupted folding like CAMK2AH477Y
(Lord, 1996; Oromendia et al., 2012), we
hypothesized that the p.H477Y mutant may
exhibit reduced stability and undergo proteaso-
mal degradation. To test this, 293T cells were
transfected with reporter constructs that encode
GFP tagged wild-type and mutant CAMK2A fol-
lowed
by
a
self-cleaving
peptide
T2A
and
mCherry (Figure 3E). The intensity of GFP fluo-
rescence was used as a direct quantitative mea-
sure of CAMK2A stability with the mCherry as
an internal control for transfection and transla-
tional
efficiency.
We
observed
a
significant
reduction in GFP intensity in cells expressing
CAMK2AH477Y and CAMK2AH477X as compared
to wild-type CAMK2A or GFP alone (Figure 3E)
despite comparable mCherry fluorescence lev-
els. This reduction was rescued when we treated

 the cells with MG132, which blocked proteasomal degradation. MG132 treamentled to enhanced
accumulation of the p.H477Y and p.H477X mutant, with a greater effect on p.H477X (Figure 3F,
lane 3, 4 vs lane 7, 8, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). By contrast, the level of the wild-type pro-
tein was reduced, likely due to the toxic effects of MG132 (Figure 3F, lane 2 vs. lane 6). These
results suggest that in addition to causing reduced holoenzyme assembly, the p.H477Y mutation
might also directly or indirectly reduce the overall CAMK2A levels by compromising its half-life.
To unequivocally demonstrate the pathogenicity of the p.H477Y allele in vivo, we performed
rescue experiments using C. elegans. A single ortholog of CAMK2, encoded by unc-43, is present
in the worm genome and its functions in the nervous system are welldocumented (Reiner et al.,
1999). To study the neuronal defects caused by loss of unc-43, we focused on motor neuron,
DA9, which has its cell body located in the pre-anal ganglion with a dendrite that extends anteri-
orly and a posteriorly oriented axon extending via a commissure into the dorsal nerve cord, where
it proceeds anteriorly to form approximately 25 en passant synapses onto body wall muscles and

 reciprocal inhibitory neurons (Figure 4A) (Klassen and Shen, 2007; Maeder et al., 2014). Using
mCherry-tagged UNC-43, we observed that UNC-43 could be found along the entire DA9 neuron
but concentrated at synaptic boutons (Figure 4B). The homologous patient-specific mutation p.
H466Y in UNC-43 (homologous to p.H477Y in human CAMK2A) significantly disrupted the synap-
tic localization of UNC-43 and caused the protein to be dispersed throughout the entire axon
(Figure 4B). To test the consequence of UNC-43 mutation on DA9 synaptic function, we used the
itr-1 pB promoter to express the fluorescently conjugated synaptic vesicle marker RAB-3 (RAB3::
GFP) within DA9 in both the wild-type and unc-43 mutant background. In wild-type animals, RAB-
3::GFP accumulated in discrete puncta along the axon of DA9 at stereotyped synaptic locations.

 In the canonical unc-43(e408) loss-of-function mutant, we observed a reduction in individual pre-
synaptic puncta fluorescence intensity as compared to wild-type animals. This phenotype could be
rescued by cell-autonomous expression of wild-type unc-43 in DA9. However, expression of unc-
43
harboring
the
homologous

mutation
UNC-43H466Y
failed
to
rescue
this
defect
(Figure 4C,D). In addition, transgenic expression of human wild-type CAMK2A fully rescued this
defect, confirming the high degree of functional conservation between CAMK2A homologs, while
the patient-derived human CAMK2AH477Y failed to do so (Figure 4C, bottom panels). These
results suggest that the p.H477Y mutation is defective in supporting pre-synaptic function in C.
elegans.
Immediately posterior to the stretch of presynaptic puncta is an asynaptic domain within the
DA9 axon that is devoid of any RAB-3::GFP fluorescence in wild-type animals (Figure 4E, top
panel). Loss of unc-43 results in the mislocalization of the synaptic marker RAB3::GFP into this
asynaptic region (Figure 4E, bottom panel). This defect could also be rescued by cell autonomous
expression of either unc-43 or human CAMK2A. Patient derived mutation CAMK2AH477Y or the
worm homologous mutation UNC-43H466Y both failed to rescue this phenotype (Figure 4E). In
addition, expression of UNC-43H466Y in wild-type animals did not cause any synaptic defect or mis-
localizaton of RAB3::GFP, suggesting that the mutation does not have dominant negative effects
(Figure 4F).
We further tested if the patient derived mutation in CAMK2A impacted worm locomotor behav-
ior. Null mutants for unc-43 are flaccid in posture and move with a flattened uncoordinated wave-
form. The animals are variably convulsive, often spontaneously contracting and relaxing their body-
wall muscles in brief repeating bursts that resemble seizures (Reiner et al., 1999). We expressed
either wild-type UNC-43 or UNC-43H466Y in the muscles and neurons of unc-43(e408) mutant worms
and scored the behavior of young adults in a double-blind experiment. Only the wildtype UNC-43
was able to rescue the movement defects in unc-43(e408) animals, but not UNC-43H466Y, suggesting
that UNC-43H466Y is not functional (Figure 4G). Together, the data show that CAMK2AH477Y is a
loss-of-function mutation which fails to support synaptic function in vivo.
In summary, we have identified an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental syndrome character-
ized by growth delay, frequent seizures and severe intellectual disability that is caused by a biallelic
germline loss-of-function mutation in CAMK2A. Mechanistically this mutation disrupts CAMK2A self-
oligomerization and holoenzyme assembly via its association domain. Our functional results are con-
sistent with the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the affected residue H477 in CAMK2A
orthologs, as well as previous structural data demonstrating that His477 is located in the interface
between two stacked CAMK2A subunits, which together form the basic repeat unit of the ring-
shaped holoenzyme (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016; Stratton et al., 2014). The pathogenicity of the
biallelic p.H477Y mutation is furthered highlighted by rescue experiments in C. elegans, where in
contrast to wild-type human CAMK2A the p.H477Y mutant failed to rescue the neuronal and behav-
ioral defect in unc-43 (CAMK2 ortholog) null worms. Together, these data demonstrate that the loss
of function of CAMK2A is the most plausible genetic cause for the neurodevelopmental defects
observed in the two affected siblings.
Discussion
CAMK2 plays important and evolutionary conserved roles in synaptic plasticity, neuronal transmis-
sion and cognition in near all model organisms examined, and several groups have shown that
somatic mutations in human CAMK2 isoforms may contribute to neurological disorders (Ghosh and

 Giese, 2015; Robison, 2014; Takemoto-Kimura et al., 2017). Notably, a de novo p.E183V mutation
in the CAMK2A catalytic domain was shown to cause autism spectrum disorder (Stephenson et al.,
2017). This mutation was shown to act in a dominant-negative manner to reduce wild-type CAMK2A
auto-phosphorylation and localization to dendritic spines. While this manuscript was under revision,
S. Ku
¨ ry et al. reported multiple families with intellectual disability caused by de novo, heterozygous
mutations in both CAMK2A and CAMK2B kinase and auto-regulatory domains, which disrupted
CAMK2 phosphorylation and caused neuronal migratory defects in murine models (Ku
¨ry et al.,
2017).
Our discovery of a novel neuro-developmental syndrome caused by biallelic CAMK2A muta-
tions further broadens the spectrum of human neurological disorders caused by the CAMK2 family
of kinases. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first Mendelian human disease
caused by biallelic CAMK2A mutations. Our functional characterization of the novel mutation p.
H477Y in vitro and in vivo also reveal novel insights on how the CAMK2A holoenzyme regulates
neuronal function. In contrast to all previously reported mutations in CAMK2A in intellectual dis-
ability syndromes, the p.H477Y is located within the C-terminal association domain and results in
a partial but significant disruption of self-oligomerization, suggesting that the assembly of
CAMK2A oligomers, in addition to its kinase function is required for neuronal function. Interest-
ingly, the CAMK2AH477Y mutant retains the ability to interact with wild-type CAMK2A but not
with itself (Figure 3D). CAMK2A displays very specific cellular and subcellular expression patterns
that is important for regulating substrate phosphorylation in cells (Liu and Murray, 2012;
Tsui et al., 2005). The p.H477Y missense affects the subcellular localization in neurons and this
may affect its ability to function efficiently. These biochemical results provide a mechanistic basis
for the autosomal recessive nature of the disease in our family: the p.H477Y allele is hypomorphic
and becomes pathogenic when recessively inherited in the homozygous state. We speculate that
heterozygous carriers retain sufficient CAMK2A activity for proper neuronal function. As compared
to the milder disease phenotypes reported by Kury et. al., the symptoms afflicting the p.H477Y
patients likely represent the most severe manifestation of the CAMK2A dysfunction in humans.
Due to the high degree of conservation of CAMK2A across evolution, we employed the estab-
lished C. elegans unc-43 mutant to prove the pathogenicity of the p.H477Y mutation. UNC-43 is the
worm homologue of vertebrate CAMK2. We demonstrated wild-type human CAMK2A could rescue
the locomotive defects of the unc-43 mutants, while the p.H477Y mutant failed to do so, likely due
to its inability to localize into neuronal synapses (Figure 4). We anticipate this in vivo functional assay
in C. elegans to be widely applicable to assess the pathogenicity of newly discovered CAMK2 alleles
found in human diseases.

 Disease diagnosis and informed consent
Patients were identified and diagnosed by clinical geneticists at King Hussein Medical Centre,
Amman, Jordan. Informed consent was obtained from the families for genetic testing in accordance
with approved institutional ethical guidelines (Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore, A*STAR, Sin-
gapore, NUS-IRB reference code 10–051). For patients in Figure 1, informed consent to publish
photographs and videos was obtained from parents. Genomic DNA samples were isolated from
saliva using the Oragene DNA collection kit (OG-500, DNAGenotek) and a punch skin biopsy was
taken from patient II.4.
Whole exome sequencing
Whole exome sequencing of proband II-1 was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrich-
ment Kit for exome capture using 1 ug of genomic DNA. Illumina HiSeq2000 High-output mode was
used for sequencing as 100 bp paired-end runs at the UCLA Clinical Genomics Centre and at the
UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Centre as previously described (Hu et al., 2014). An average cover-
age of 34X was achieved across the exome with 87% of these bases covered at �10X. After filtering,
a total of 73 homozygous, 125 compound heterozygous and 493 heterozygous variants were pro-
tein-changing variants with population minor allele frequencies < 1%.
Homozygosity mapping
Both parents and their five children were genotyped using Illumina Humancore-12v1 BeadChips fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. Call rates were above 99%. Gender and relationships were veri-
fied using Illumina BeadStudio. Mapping was performed by searching for shared regions that are
homozygous and identical-by-descent (IBD) in the two affected children using custom programs writ-
ten in the Mathematica (Wofram Research, Inc.) data analysis software (Source code file 1 - IBD link-
age program). Candidate regions were further refined by exclusion of common homozygous
segments with any unaffected family members. The confidence criteria to identify IBD blocks were a
minimum of 5 cM. We identified one shared candidate loci on chromosome 5.
Cell culture and plasmid transfection
HEK 293 T cells (ATCC Cat# CRL-3216, RRID:CVCL_0063, from Lab Stock) were cultured in DMEM
media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. Cell line identity was authenticated by commercial
human STR profiling with ATCC (ATCC, #135-XV). All cell lines used in this paper tested negative for
mycoplasma using Lonza MycoAlert (Lonza LT07). For transient transfection, 6 � 105 cells per well
were seeded in 6 well plates 24 hr before being transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo-
Fisher)-complexed plasmids in OPTIMEM (ThermoFisher). To construct the CAMK2A expression
plasmids, human CAMK2A cDNA was PCR-amplified from ImageClone with AscI and PacI restriction
sites and cloned into pCDNA3.1 with an N-terminal 3xFLAG or 3xHA tag. All CAMK2A mutants
were generated using QuikChange XL (Agilent). Cells were treated with MG132 (Sigma, M8699) at 5
mM to block proteasome degradation.
Generation of iPSCs
Control iPSCs from an unrelated but ethnically and sex-matched individual
Fibroblasts were transduced with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (Addgene plasmids #17225,
#17226, #17227 were gifts from George Daley, and #18119 a gift from John Cleveland) as previously
described (Park et al., 2008). After 4 days, transduced cells were reseeded onto irradiated mouse

Neuronal differentiation and Multi-electrode Array Recordings
iPSCs-derived NPCs were differentiated into neurons for 21 days using a previously published proto-
col (Xu et al., 2017a). Briefly, NPCs were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in a poly-L-ornithine
and laminin-coated plates, cultured in N2B27 medium supplemented BDNF (20 ng/ml), GDNF (20
ng/ml), cAMP (N6,2’-O-dibutyryladenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate; Sigma; 0.3 mM) and ascor-
bic acid (0.2 mM). H1 embryonic stem cells (Gift from Lawrence W. Stanton, WiCell, RRID:CVCL_
C813) were also differentiated into neurons to use as controls. H1 embryonic stem cells were verified
by karyotyping (Cytogenetics Laboratory, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore) and
checked for pluripotency by differentiation into the three germ layers marked by Nestin (ectoderm),
AFP (endoderm) and ASM-1 (mesoderm). For the immunofluorescence staining, neurons were fixed
for 15 min in ice cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Permeabilization using 0.3% (v/v) Triton-X in 1X
PBS was performed for 10 min then incubated with 1:1000 mouse anti-Tuj1 (Covance Research Prod-
ucts Inc Cat# MMS-435P, RRID:AB_2313773), 1:1500 guinea pig anti-MAP2 (Synaptic Systems Cat#
188 004, RRID:AB_2138181) overnight at 4˚C in 5% (w/v) BSA diluted with 1X PBS. For visualization,
1:1000 secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-11076,
RRID:AB_2534120) or Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-11001, RRID:AB_2534069)
was applied. Counter staining for nuclei were performed using Dapi. Images were captured using
the FV3000 Olympus confocal.
For the multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, neurons on day 21 were dissociated and replated
on 0.1 polyethylenimine (Sigma)-coated 48 well MEA plates (Axion Biosystems) in BrainPhys media
supplemented with BDNF, GDNF, cAMP and ascorbic acid as previously described (Xu et al.,
2017b). Spontaneous neuronal activity was observed and recorded at 37˚C for 5 min every 2–3 days
using the Maestro MEA System (Axion Biosystem). Independent measurements were taken from
seven wells for each condition (technical replicates).
In vitro transcription/translation and co-immunoprecipitation
CAMK2A proteins were synthesized in vitro using TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation
(Promega) with 1 mg of plasmids in 20 ml reaction volumes for 90 mins at 30˚C. For co-immunopre-
cipitation, the reactions were diluted 10x in TBS (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8, 150 mM NaCl) with 1%
Nonidet P40 (NP40) and incubated with 10 ml anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) at 4˚C overnight.
Proteins were eluted with 1x Laemmli buffer after 3 washes in the 1xTBS with 1% NP40.
Protein electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Total protein lysate was quantified using a standard Bradford assay and 10 mg of lysate was used for
immunoblotting experiments. For Blue Native PAGE, cells were lysed in 1x Sample Preparation
buffer (ThermoFisher) containing 1% digitonin. 1% SDS was supplemented for SDS-PAGE. All pro-
teins were transferred to PVDF membranes using TurboBlot (Bio-rad) at 2.5 mA for seven mins. The
primary antibodies used were anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F3165, RRID:AB_259529), anti-
GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-47724, RRID:AB_627678) and anti-HA (Y-11, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Cat# sc-805, RRID:AB_631618). The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Cat# 111-035-003, RRID:AB_2313567), anti-mouse IgG-HRP (light
chain specific) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Cat# 205-032-176, RRID:AB_2339056) and anti-mouse
IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Cat# 115-035-003, RRID:AB_10015289).
Worm strains
All strains were maintained at 20˚C on OP50 E. coli nematode growth medium plates as described
(Brenner, 1974). N2 Bristol strain worms (WB Cat# CB4852, RRID:WB-STRAIN:CB4852) were used

Plasmids for transgenic expression in worms
Expression plasmids for transgenic worm lines were made using the pSM vector (C. Bargmann), a
derivative of pPD49.26 (A. Fire). The mig-13 promoter was cloned between SphI/AscI, and C.elegans
unc-43 isoform d or human CAMK2a was cloned between NheI/KpnI or AscI/NheI, respectively. P.
H466Y and p.H477Y mutations were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis using KOD-plus- high
fidelity DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan). Transgenic worms were generated as described
(Mello, 1995). Plasmids were injected into animals at 10 ng/ml (in the case of Pmig-13::unc-43) and
50 ng/ml (in the case of Pmig-13::CAMK2a) together with coinjection markers at 90 ng/ml.
Fluorescence quantification and confocal imaging
All fluorescence images of DA9 were taken in live worms immobilized with 5% agar pad, 10 mM leva-
misol (Sigma) and 0.1 mm polystylene beads (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) with a 63�/
1.4 NA objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging System or a Plan-Apochromat 63�/1.3 objective on
a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope using similar imaging parameters for the same marker across
different genotypes. Fluorescence quantification was determined using Image J software (ImageJ,
RRID:SCR_003070).
Behavioral analysis
mcherry::unc-43 or mcherry::unc-43(H466Y) were expressed in unc-43(e403) mutant worms using
both unc-104 promoter (neuron-specific promoter) and hlh-1 promoter (muscle-specific promoter).
Two independent lines were established and analyzed. The behavioral phenotype of the transgenic
worms was scored in a double-blind manner using a stereo microscope (SZX16, Olumpus, Tokyo,
Japan). From the movement behavior on OP50 feeder NGM plates, each worm was classified to
behave like ‘wild-type’ or ‘unc-43’. 100 worms were observed for each genotype on the same day
from two independently derived transgenic lines.
