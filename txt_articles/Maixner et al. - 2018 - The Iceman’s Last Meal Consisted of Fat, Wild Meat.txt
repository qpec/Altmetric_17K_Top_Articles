In Brief
Maixner et al. report the dietary
reconstruction of the Iceman’s last meal
using a combined multi-omics approach.
The stomach content analysis of the
5,300-year-old glacier mummy shows
that the Iceman’s diet preceding his death
was a mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and
lipids, well adjusted to the energetic
requirements of his high-altitude
trekking.

SUMMARY
The history of humankind is marked by the constant
adoption of new dietary habits affecting human
physiology, metabolism, and even the development
of nutrition-related disorders. Despite clear archaeo-
logical evidence for the shift from hunter-gatherer
lifestyle to agriculture in Neolithic Europe [1], very lit-
tle information exists on the daily dietary habits of our
ancestors. By undertaking a complementary -omics
approach combined with microscopy, we analyzed
the stomach content of the Iceman, a 5,300-year-
old European glacier mummy [2, 3]. He seems to
have had a remarkably high proportion of fat in his
diet, supplemented with fresh or dried wild meat,
cereals, and traces of toxic bracken. Our multi-
pronged approach provides unprecedented analyt-
ical depth, deciphering the nutritional habit, meal
composition, and food-processing methods of this
Copper Age individual.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Human evolution is closely linked to dietary changes and the
development of new food-processing techniques. This is clearly
observed in the transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyle to
agriculture, which gave rise to cultivation of crops, animal
husbandry, and permanent settlements [1]. The more stable
availability of food boosted the growth of Neolithic European
populations [4, 5]. However, changes in diet had drawbacks

 for health, such as increased rates of caries [6]. Added to this,
permanent large settlements combined with the adoption of
agriculture promoted the spread of density-dependent infec-
tious diseases [7]. Considering the impact of dietary habits on
human evolution and health, the reconstruction of past human
subsistence appears to be vital to our understanding of past
societies. Stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope
analyses of bone collagen have been widely used to study the
dietary adaptations of Neolithic populations [8], lipid analysis
on pottery residues dated the onset of milk use in Neolithic
Europe [9], and numerous archaeological studies describe the
occurrences of wild and domesticated animal and plant remains
as indirect measures of past diets [10]. All these studies provide
insights into major dietary changes during the Neolithic period.
However, specific details on past diets such as the exact meal
composition or food processing are missing. Knowledge of daily
dietary habits of our ancestors is pertinent as food type, intake
quantity, and food-processing techniques influence human
metabolism and health.
A recent radiological re-examination of the Iceman, a 5,300-
year-old European natural ice mummy, identified his completely
filled stomach (Figure 1A) [2]. The well-preserved stomach
content still contains ancient endogenous biomolecules as
demonstrated from the complete reconstruction of the Iceman’s
Helicobacter pylori genome [11]. Previous isotopic analysis
(15N/14N) of the Iceman’s hair suggested first a vegetarian
lifestyle [12, 13] which was later, after careful re-examination of
the data, changed to a omnivorous diet [14]. Further analyses
of lower intestinal tract samples of the Iceman confirmed that
he was omnivorous, with a diet consisting of both wild animal
and plant material. Among the plant remains, there were cereals,
pollen grains of hop-hornbeam, and fragments of bracken and
mosses [14–20]. The detection of the Iceman’s stomach content
with its pristine yet undigested food mix, provides the unique
opportunity to fully reconstruct a Copper Age meal.
The study material included 11 gastrointestinal (GI) content
biopsies of the stomach and small and large intestines (Figure 1A;
Data S1). Using microscopy and a combined multi-omics
approach
targeting
different
biomolecules
(ancient
DNA,
proteins, metabolites, and lipids) (see STAR Methods), we deter-
mined the exact composition of the Iceman’s diet preceding his
death and present evidence how people during the Copper Age
processed food.
Initial
macro-
and
microscopic
analyses
showed
that,
compared to the small and large intestine contents, samples of
the stomach content still contain compact pieces of food that

 display a hydrophobic ‘‘fatty-like’’ character (Figure 1A). The
most prevalent tissue types in the stomach content samples
are animal muscle fibers arranged mostly in bundles (Figures
1B and S1) and plant fragments identified as bran and glumes
belonging to the Triticum/Secale type (Figures 1C and S1). The
striated muscle fiber structures are characteristic for cardiac
and skeletal muscle tissue (Figure S1B) [21]. Further microscopic
analysis of the plant micro-remains identified cereal pollen from
the Triticum-type as well as airborne arboreal pollen and an
abundance of spores and sporangia from the bracken fern Pteri-
dium aquilinum (Figure S1J).
Metabolite, glycan, stable isotope, and elemental analyses
confirm the omnivorous character of the Iceman’s last meal
(Data S2). Metabolic compounds indicate the presence of
ruminant fat or dairy products (phytanic acid) and support the
existence of whole-grain cereals (azealic acid) in the Iceman’s
diet. In addition, gamma-terpinene that occurs in coriander oil,
lemon oil, and other essential oils suggest the usage of herbs.
The most abundant elements found in the stomach content
were the nutritional minerals iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium,
and sodium, consistent with the consumption of red meat or
dairy products. Minor concentrations of trace nutrients of chro-
mium, copper, manganese, selenium, molybdenum, and cobalt
were also detected. These data suggest that the Iceman’s last
meal was well balanced in terms of essential minerals required
for good health with no evidence of toxic heavy metals such as
lead, cadmium, or arsenic.
To further identify the possible food sources, we analyzed the
DNA and protein traces still present in the material. Metage-
nomic analysis of the Iceman’s biopsy samples revealed a high
number of bacterial reads in all GI tract contents (Figure 2A). At
most, 39% of reads in the Iceman samples were of eukaryotic
origin, the majority of which (between 94% and 42%) were
identified as fungal. The Metazoa and Virdiplantae reads, impor-
tant for the dietary reconstruction, comprised 0.2%–0.7% of all
reads (Figures S2A–S2C). Comparative analysis of all GI shotgun
datasets (n = 21) against currently available full mitochondrial
and chloroplast genomes unambiguously assigned the majority
of animal reads to ibex (Capra ibex) and red deer (Cervus
elaphus), and the major proportion of plant reads belong to the
species Pteridium aquilinum subsp. aquilinum and to members
of the genus Triticum (Figures 2B and S2D). DNA traces of these
four major taxa were detected in all GI content samples. A con-
trol dataset from the Iceman’s muscle tissue was negative (Fig-
ure S2D). The unambiguously assigned reads were aligned to
modern reference plastid genomes, and all animal- and plant-
derived reads show damage patterns indicative of ancient DNA
(Figure S3) [22]. Subsequent phylogenetic assignment of the
reconstructed plastid genomes confirmed and further extended
the metagenomic result (Figure S3). The Triticum reads were
more specifically assigned to chloroplast genomes of Triticum
monococcum (einkorn) and Triticum urartu (Figure S3; Data S1).
Importantly, the presence of ibex and red deer in the stomach
contents was independently confirmed in the Molecular Popula-
tion Genetics Laboratory, Trinity College, Dublin, by sequencing
of a mammalian mitochondrial capture (Data S1). Moreover,
PCR-based analysis targeting animal- and plant-DNA barcodes
and further assignment of the shotgun data against the DNA

cal level (genus, family) (Figure S4).
Our analysis of the ancient DNA identified the main compo-
nents in the Iceman’s meal. However, the highly degraded state
of this biomolecule excluded any further quantification of certain
foods.
Using multistep solubilization and fractionation proteomics,
we identified 167 animal and plant proteins in the stomach meta-
proteome, of which 13 were taxonomically unambiguously
assigned to the Triticinae, 6 to the Caprinae, and 1 protein to
the Cervinae subfamily (Figure 2C; Data S2). The proteomic
hits not only confirm the previous metagenomic results but
also provide important information on the food source. The
detected Triticinae plant proteins are primarily expressed in the
endosperm (Globulin 3A, Triticin) [23] and pericarp (Oxalate oxi-
dase 2) [24] of wheat seeds. The Caprinae Titin-like protein is part
of the sarcomere apparatus in muscle tissue [25]. Thus, we have
combined genomic and proteomic evidence that the Iceman’s

T. monococcum/T. urartu-like wheat and
muscle fibers of ibex. However, due to
the lack of diagnostic proteins, we cannot
determine which tissues of the red deer
were ingested by the Iceman.
Approximately 46% ± 19% (w/w) of
the stomach content is fat residues.

(RP-LC/MSMS)
identified triacylglycerols (TAGs) as a
major component of the stomach con-
tent,
with
molecular
compositions
consistent with ruminant muscle/adipose
fat (Figure 3A). The TAGs identified in the Iceman’s stomach
contain between 44 and 56 total carbon atoms in the fatty
acyl chains and resemble the TAG profile of contemporary mus-
cle and adipose tissue. The high level (up to 20%) of odd
numbered fatty acyl chains is consistent with TAG profiles
from ruminant animals (Data S2) [27]. Short-chain TAG species
characteristic of dairy products are absent in the Iceman TAG
profile. However, the high level of saturated bonds in the
TAGs of the Iceman’s stomach content compared to the fresh
tissues indicates an already ongoing preferential degradation
of unsaturated fatty acids in the ancient specimen (Figure 3B)
[28]. Therefore, we cannot fully exclude that short-chain dairy-
specific lipid species were degraded, although the identification
of di- and poly-unsaturated TAG indicates a still high level of
preservation. Furthermore, we have histological evidence for
the presence of adipose tissue in the Iceman’s stomach content
(Figure S1C). Further comparison of the dispersion factor with
the average carbon number (M) of each detected TAG in the
analyzed samples points to the ibex as potential source of the

 adipose tissue (Figure 3C). Thus, the ibex served the Iceman as
food source for both meat and fat.
Charcoal particles detected in a previous study in the Ice-
man’s lower intestine content suggested the involvement of
fire in the food processing [16]. We experimentally tested the ef-
fect of heat and drying on contemporary animal muscle tissue
and compared their structural and chemical composition with
the muscle fibers detected in the Iceman’s stomach by using
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy.
High magnification AFM images revealed striated fiber struc-
tures in both ancient and fresh or dried contemporary muscle
fibers while structural changes of the fibers were observed
when the samples were thermally treated (Figure 4A). After frying
or cooking, the regular patterns in the meat fibers disappeared,
indicating the denaturation of their protein compounds. Comple-
mentary confocal Raman spectroscopy measurements support
the AFM results and indicate heat-related conformational
changes of the molecular composition of the meat fibers (Fig-
ure 4B). The Raman spectra of the ancient muscle fibers largely
matched the spectra taken of fresh and dried contemporary
meat fibers. After heat treatment, the Raman band at about
1,093
cm-1
becomes
weaker,
and
bands
at
around
1,240 cm-1 appear that are indicative of heat-induced changes
in the secondary structure of the myofibrils [29]. Thus, both the
AFM and Raman spectroscopy results suggest that the Iceman
consumed either fresh or dried wild meat. Besides, a slow drying
or smoking of the meat over the fire would explain the charcoal
particles detected previously in the lower intestine content.

and Raman Spectra of Muscle Fibers from

(A) Fibers obtained from the content of the Ice-
man’s stomach (I) show structures similar to those
of recent fibers (II and VI). The typical Z-line is
observed in raw (II) and air-dried lamb muscle
fibers (IV). After thermal treatment such as frying or
cooking of the meat, the sarcomeres disappear
(III). The surface of the fibers becomes blurred, and
only faint fibrillary structures can be found.
(B) Raman spectra of samples extracted from the
Iceman’s stomach content show similarities to
untreated (fresh) lamb meat spectra. See Data S2
for details to the modern comparative animal
samples.
Our forensic multi-omics study pro-
vides important insights into the general
life and nutritional habits of a Copper
Age individual in the Alpine area. The
microscopic and molecular data pre-
sented support the presence of three
major components in the Iceman’s last
meal: fat and game meat from ibex and
red deer supplemented with cereals from
einkorn. Intriguing is the pervasive pres-
ence of bracken particles. Despite of its
toxicity, bracken is still consumed today
by different indigenous people [30]. How-
ever, it is also possible that fern leaves,
as it was previously suggested for the moss Neckera complanata
[20], were used to wrap the food and the spores and sporangia
entered the ingesta unintentionally. Unexpectedly, there is a
high proportion of fat in the diet. The distribution of triglycerides
and their constituting fatty acids is consistent with the consump-
tion of ibex muscle and adipose tissues. The extreme alpine envi-
ronment in which the Iceman lived and where he have been found
(3,210 m above sea level) is particularly challenging for the human
physiology and requires optimal nutrient supply to avoid rapid
starvation and energy loss [31]. Therefore, the Iceman seemed
to have been fully aware that fat displays an excellent energy
source. On the other hand, the intake of animal adipose tissue
fat has a strong correlation with increased risk of coronary artery
disease [32]. A high saturated fats diet raises cholesterol levels in
the blood, which in turn can lead to atherosclerosis. Importantly,
computed tomography scans of the Iceman showed major calci-
fications in arteria and the aorta indicating an already advanced
atherosclerotic disease state [33]. Both his high-fat diet and his
genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease [34] could
have significantly contributed to the development of the arterial
calcifications. Finally, we could show that the Iceman either
consumed fresh or dried meat. Drying meat by smoking or in
the open air are simple but highly effective methods for meat
preservation that would have allowed the Iceman to store meat
long term on journeys or in periods of food scarcity. In summary,
the Iceman’s last meal was a well-balanced mix of carbohy-
drates, proteins, and lipids, perfectly adjusted to the energetic re-
quirements of his high-altitude trekking.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
The Iceman
The Iceman is one of the oldest human mummies ever found in human history [52]. With his body perfectly preserved throughout
millennia in an Alpine glacier (3,210 m above sea level) and his secrets unlocked and shown for the first time to humanity by the
melting of ice in 1991, it has been and still is a subject of great interest, fascination and speculations, since the veil of mystery
enveloping the circumstances of his death has not yet fallen [3]. The Iceman was murdered when he was 40-50 years old by an arrow
that lacerated the left subclavian artery, likely leading to a rapid, deadly hemorrhagic shock [53, 54]. It is not only his historical age and
the bounty of prehistoric belongings that make him extremely valuable for scientists, but also how he was preserved for about 53
centuries. The Iceman is indeed an ‘‘ice mummy,’’ so-called for the retention of humidity in his cells [55]. The body tissues contain
well preserved biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. This feature makes him extremely valuable for modern
scientific investigations [11, 34, 56–61]. Initially, the Iceman‘s stomach was not found radiologically and was generally assumed

 to be empty. During a recent re-examination however, the Iceman‘s stomach was not only identified radiologically, but also shown to
be completely filled [2].
METHOD DETAILS
Sampling
The sampling of the Iceman stomach content took place under sterile conditions at an ambient temperature of 4�C in the Iceman’s
conservation chamber at the Archaeological Museum of Bolzano, Italy. The samples were immediately stored at �20�C in the ancient
DNA laboratory of the Eurac Research - Institute for Mummy Studies. Furthermore, we had access to previously sampled
gastrointestinal tract contents and to an Iceman muscle and lung tissue sample, which we used in addition to the extraction blanks
as a negative control for our molecular analyses. See Data S1 for additional details to the samples used in this study.
Microscopic analysis
Small pieces of the stomach content (0.5cmx0.5cm) were processed for microscopy in the aDNA laboratory of the Eurac Research -
Institute for Mummy Studies, Bolzano. After rehydration in 15mL solution consisting of 5 parts glycerol and 5 parts 4% formaldehyde
for 48 h, the samples were fixed for 24 h in 4% formaldehyde and finally stored in 1x phosphate buffered saline solution at 4�C. For the
microscopic analysis, small tissue pieces have been embedded with an aqueous mounting medium on a glass slide. In parallel, some
fixed content samples were embedded in OCT cryostat embedding medium (Tissue Tek�) and further processed for histology. The
embedded specimens were cut on a cryostat in 10 mm thick sections (Leica, CM1950). The cryosections were histochemically
counterstained with the lipid stain Sudan III [62]. The images were recorded with a CCD camera (Nikon DS-Fi1) mounted on a light
microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600), by using the imaging software NIS elements F 3.00. Additionally, ancient animal meat fibers
detected in the stomach content were sent to the Center of Smart Interfaces at the TU Darmstadt, Germany, where the coarse
topography of meat fibers was analyzed by laser scanning microscope (LSM) images (VK 8710, Keyence, Osaka, Japan).
Metabolite analysis
Primary metabolism was assessed using GC-TOF MS. 2 mg fresh weight of stomach contents were extracted using 1 mL of
degassed and pre-cooled (�20�C) acetonitrile/isopropanol/water solvent at the volume ratio 3:3:2. After centrifugation, the superna-
tant was removed and evaporated to complete dryness. A clean-up step with 500 mL acetonitrile/water (1:1) removed membrane
lipids and triglycerides and after centrifugation. To the dried extracts, C8-C30 fatty acid methyl esters were added as internal stan-
dards. Samples were derivatized by 10 mL methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine (20 mg/mL) at 30�C for 90 min, followed by the
addition of 90 mL N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide at 37�C for 30 min. 0.5 mL of sample was injected at 50�C (ramped to
250�C by 12�C/s and held for 3 min) in splitless mode in a Gerstel cold injection system with multi-baffled glass liners. Metabolites
were separated using an Agilent 6890 GC system (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Rtx5Sil-MS column (30 m length x 0.25 mm
i.d.) with a 0.25 mm 95% dimethyl/ 5% diphenyl polysiloxane film and additional 10 m integrated guard column (Restek, Bellefonte,
PA, USA). Chromatography was performed at 1 mL/min helium from 50�C to 330�C with 20�C/min. Mass spectra were acquired on a
Leco Pegasus IV time of flight mass spectrometer (St. Joseph, MI, USA) with electron ionization at 70 eV at 250�C. Masses were
detected between m/z 85-500 at 17 spectra/s and 1800 V detector voltage. ChromaTOF software version 4.2 was used for data
pre-processing including baseline subtraction and automatic mass spectral deconvolution and peak detection. The resulting
chromatograms were further processed using the metabolomics BinBase database and spectra were further manually investigated
by the Fiehnlib libraries and the NIST12 mass spectral library. Please refer for the list of metabolites identified in the Iceman stomach
content to Data S2_Metabolomics.
Glycan analysis
Glycan analysis for the Iceman stomach content was performed at Asia-Pacific Glycomics Reference Site (AGRS) in Daejeon,
Republic of Korea. Two stomach content samples of 0.021 g and 0.023 g, respectively were ground with 300 mL 70% EtOH into tissue
grinder. High molecular weight materials including glycoproteins were enriched from ground samples by mini dialysis unit (10,000
MWCO). Supernatant was transferred to micro-centrifuge tube and denatured by mixture of NH4HCO3 and DTT (95�C, 2min).
N-glycans were enzymatically released from denatured glycoproteins by PNGase F (37�C, overnight) and these were further purified
and enriched using solid phase extraction with a porous carbon cartridge. N-glycans released from the Iceman stomach content
were comprehensively characterized by nano LC PGC-chip/Q-TOF MS and tandem MS (Agilent 6530). Glycan candidates were
selected from the mass-to-charge values extracted in raw LC/MS data based on monosaccharide combinations using hexose,
N-acetyl hexoamine, fucose, N-acetyl neuraminic acid, and xylose. N-glycan compositions were further confirmed and determined
by compositional analysis using tandem MS. In order to determine relative amounts of glycans, individual glycan compound was
integrated using the ion count corresponding to individual peak and then normalized by total ion counts to obtain the relative
abundance of each glycan. Additionally, isomers derived from PGC-LC analysis were combined in a single composition prior to
quantitative analysis. Data S2_Glycomics lists all identified glycan structures.

 Stable isotope analysis
The preparation of the stomach content (EURAC ID 1054) for the stable isotope analysis was conducted in the laboratory at the
Department of Physical Anthropology, Institute of Forensic Medicine at University of Bern. Therefore, a sample of 1g was dissolved
in ddH2O and freeze-dried for 47h. After homogenization by a ball triturator (Retsch), approx. 5.5mg of the lyophilized stomach
content was weighed into tin capsules and shipped to IRMS at Isolab GmbH, Schweitenkirchen, Germany for measurement. Stable
isotope ratios of carbon (13C/12C), nitrogen (15N/14N) and sulfur (34S/32S) were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and the
mean of six measurements was calculated to avoid measurement errors due to potential inhomogeneous material. All data are
presented in d-notation in per mil (&) according to international standards for carbon (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite, VPDB), nitrogen
(Ambient Inhalable Reservoir, AIR) and sulfur (Canyon Diablo Troilite, CDT) [63–65]. An internal standard was used for determination
of the analytical error. It amounted to ± 0.1& for d13C, ± 0.2& for d15N and ± 0.3& for d34S. For details for the stable isotope values
of the Iceman stomach content please refer to the Data S2_Stable isotope analysis.
Elemental analysis of the Iceman stomach content
An Agilent Technologies 7500cx inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (Agilent Technologies, Mulgrave,
Australia) was used with sample introduction via a micromist concentric nebuliser (Glass Expansion, West Melbourne, Australia)
and a Scott type double pass spray chamber cooled to 2�C. The sample solution and the spray chamber waste were carried with
the aid of a peristaltic pump. ICP-MS extraction lens conditions were selected to maximize the sensitivity of a 1% HNO3:HCl solution
containing 1ng ml-1 of Li, Co, Y, Ce and Tl. Helium was added into the octopole reaction cell to reduce interferences. Calibration
curves were constructed and the results analyzed using Agilent Technologies MassHunter software. A certified calibration standard
containing Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Ba, La, Eu, Ho, Yb, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th, U and P
as well as a Hg standard was obtained from Choice Analytical, Thornleigh, Australia. Calibration curves were constructed from seven
standards at 0, 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 ng/mL. Baseline nitric acid (HNO3) hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
were purchased from Choice Analytical, Thornleigh, Australia. Two stomach content samples of 0.05915 g and 0.0279 g were each
digested in 2 mL HNO3, 1 mL HCl and 1 mL H2O2 in a Milestone MLS 1200 microwave digester (Milestone, Sorisole, Italy), and diluted
to approximately 50 g (accurately measured on an analytical balance) before analysis. A digestion blank was subtracted from each
sample. The average concentrations of the elements detected in the Iceman’s stomach is listed in the Data S2_Elemental analysis.
DNA extraction, library preparation and Illumina sequencing
The datasets used for the metagenomic dietary analysis have been published in our previous study on the Iceman’s Helicobacter
pylori genome. In the following sections, all major molecular steps will be briefly outlined once more. For methodological details,
however, please refer to the publication of Maixner et al. [11]. The molecular analyses were conducted at the ancient DNA Laboratory
of the Eurac Research - Institute for Mummy Studies, Bolzano, Italy, and in the ancient DNA facility of the Institute of Clinical Molecular
Biology, Kiel University, Germany. Sample preparation and DNA extraction was performed in pre-PCR areas dedicated to ancient
DNA procedures. DNA was extracted from the gastrointestinal tract samples (250 mg) and from lung tissue (50 mg) using a chloro-
form-based DNA extraction method according to the protocol of Tang et al. [66]. DNA extraction from the muscle tissue (100 mg) was
performed with a magnetic-bead based technology using the Biorobot�-EZ1 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), following previously
described procedures [67]. Negative controls from all experimental steps were included to monitor external contamination. Library
preparation and sequencing were performed at the Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Kiel University, Germany. Libraries for the
sequencing runs were generated with a modified protocol for Illumina multiplex sequencing [68, 69]. The sequencing was carried out
on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and 2500 platform by 2 3 101 cycles using the HiSeq v3 chemistry and the manufacturer’s protocol for
multiplex sequencing. For details to the metagenomic shotgun datasets please refer to Data S1_Illumina shotgun datasets.
Bioinformatic analysis of the Illumina datasets
The metagenomic shotgun datasets were subjected to a bioinformatic pipeline to identify the major animal and plant dietary
composition of the Iceman’s last meals. The paired-end Illumina reads (101 bp length) were first quality-checked using FastQC
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and then subjected to adaptor removal and read merging using
SeqPrep (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) (‘‘SeqPrep -f forward-read-fastqfile -r reverse-read-fastqfile �1 forward-read-
output-fastqfile �2 reverse-read-output-fastqfile -L 15 –A10 ‘‘AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAA’’ -B ‘‘AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCG
TGTAGGG’’ –s merged-fastq-file). Approximately 60%–90% of reads were merged (see Data S1_Illumina shotgun datasets). To
obtain a first overview of the taxonomic composition of selected samples from the different gastrointestinal tract contents and of
the muscle tissue control sample, we performed a sequence similarity search of the metagenomic reads using RAPSearch2 [38]
and the complete NCBI-nr database [70]. A stringent minimum bitscore filter (min bitscore 70) was applied to reduce random hits
and the results were taxonomically assigned using MEGAN6 [40] with the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of hits within 10% of
the bitscore of the best hits and a minimum number of 100 reads that a taxon must obtain. Finally, the data was visualized using
the Krona metagenomic visualization tool [39] providing a first taxonomic overview on the bacterial and eukaryotic reads. In the sub-
sequent step, we focused on the eukaryotic reads aiming at identifying highly abundant animal and plant species possibly resembling
the Iceman’s diet. We first aligned all metagenomic reads against all currently available full mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of
the NCBI database [70] using BWA [41] with default parameters. Subsequently, to obtain a taxonomic overview of the mapped reads
and to identify and filter for the most prevalent taxonomic groups in the samples, we performed a sequence similarity search using
Current Biology 28, 2348–2355.e1–e9, July 23, 2018
e4
 blastn [42] with default parameters and the complete NCBI-nt database as reference database [70]. Blast results were taxonomically
assigned using MEGAN6 [40] with a Min percent value of 0.01 for the reads mapped against the mitochondrial genomes and with a
Min percent value of 0.5 for the reads mapped against the chloroplast genomes (see Figure S2).
To further confirm our previous taxonomic assignments and to understand if the extracted reads are of ancient origin or if they
display modern contamination, we reconstructed the plastid genomes of selected animal and plant species and performed
phylogenetic assignments and DNA damage pattern analysis. Initially, for the plastid genome reconstruction, we extracted all reads
of all intestinal content shotgun datasets (See Data S1_Illumina shotgun datasets, both UDG-treated and non-UDG treated) that were
previously taxonomically assigned to the four dominant animal and plant (sub)families Caprinae Cervinae, Dennstaedtiaceae and
Triticeae (see Data S1_ Mapping metagenomic reads). Next, we selected for the alignment of each (sub)family reads the modern
reference sequence based on the dominant species detected in the previous taxonomic assignment: the mitochondrial genome
of Capra ibex (NC_020623) for the Caprinae reads, the mitochondrial genome of Cervus elaphus (AB245427) for the Cervinae reads,
and the chloroplast genome of Pteridium aquilinum subsp. aquilinum (HM535629) for the Dennstaedtiaceae reads. However, the
Triticeae reads have been only taxonomically assigned down to the genus Triticum. Thus, to obtain an appropriate modern reference
for the alignment, we mapped the Triticeae reads against selected chloroplast genomes of domesticated and wild species in the
genus Triticum using BWA [41] (with default parameters) implemented in the program FastQ Screen [71]. Thereby obtained FastQ
Screen results indicate that the Triticeae reads preferentially map to both Triticum monococcum (KC912690) and Triticum urartu
(KC912693) having the most specific reads to these two Triticum species (see Data S1_ FastQScreen Triticeae reads).
The previously extracted reads (both UDG-treated and non-UDG treated) of the four dominant animal and plant (sub)families
Caprinae Cervinae, Dennstaedtiaceae, and Triticeae were then re-mapped against the respective reference plastid genomes using
BWA [41] and increased the mapping sensitivity parameters (-l 1000, -o 1, -n 0.03). The obtained mapping statistics are summarized
in the (see Data S1_ Mapping metagenomic reads). Resulting SAM files were filtered for a minimum mapping quality of 30, converted
to BAM files, sorted, and indexed with SAMtools [43]. Duplicates were removed using MarkDuplicates from Picard tools (version 115,
http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). A consensus FASTA sequence was generated for each sample using the ANGSD tool [44]
and making a majority consensus call from overlapping reads (with the arguments –doFasta2 –doCounts1).
The reconstructed plastid genome sequences were subjected to comparative sequence and phylogenetic assignment. At first, a
comparative plastid genome dataset was created. Nucleic acid sequences of modern plastid genomes that are closely related to the
consensus sequences were retrieved from the public database using the BLAST search tool NCBI tblastn [42]. A multiple alignment
was obtained by using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program [45]. The automatically inferred alignment was manually
refined by using the sequence editor implemented in the ARB software package [46]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by
applying the maximum-likelihood method [PhyML [72] with the JTT substitution model]. For all datasets a stringent filter approach
was applied to include into the phylogenetic assignment only position present in all sequences (please refer to Figure S3 for details
to the number of informative position used).
To assess the nucleotide misincorporation patterns along the DNA fragments, we performed a mapDamage analysis [22] using all
non-UDG treated reads of the Iceman intestine contents mapped against the above mentioned reference genomes. Mapping and
filtering has been done as described for the preparation of the consensus sequences for the phylogenetic analysis (see Data S1).
Thereby generated SAM files and the corresponding reads mapped against the reference genomes were used for the mapDamage
analysis (see Figure S3D).
One limitation of the previous applied taxonomic assignment approach is the currently still limited availability of full plant and animal
plastid genomes. Especially the chloroplast genomes deposited in the NCBI database represent only a small percentage of the
possible plant diets present in the European Alps during the Iceman’s time. Therefore, we decided to perform a comparative
sequence analysis of selected shotgun read datasets against the DNA barcodes deposited in the BOLD system database (http://
www.boldsystems.org/) [51]. The DNA barcodes deposited at the BOLD database comprise fragments of the cytochrome
c oxidase I (COI) gene, the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) gene and the maturase K (matK) gene and the number of depos-
ited species by far exceeds the number of plastid genomes in the NCBI database. The comparative analyses were performed against
the COI fragments deposited in the groups Mammalia, Actinopterygii, Astacidae, Nematoda, and Platyhelmintes and against the rbcL
and matK fragments in the groups Magnoliophyta, Pinophyta, Bryophyta, and Pteridophyta. First, we performed a sequence similarity
search with the reads of selected shotgun datasets using blastn [42] with default parameters against the DNA barcodes extracted
from the BOLD database. In the analysis four Iceman intestinal content datasets (B0626, B0621, C1824, B0625) were included,
together with the Iceman muscle tissue (C0004) and Extraction Blank (B0629) as control datasets. All hits from the previous step
with minimum bitscore 70, min length 15, 80% alignment length, 95% identity were further subjected to a second sequence similarity
search using blastn [42] with default parameters and the complete NCBI-nt database as reference database. Blast results were
taxonomically assigned using MEGAN6 [40] with a Min percent value of 0.01 (see Figure S4A).
Animal mitochondrial genome enrichment in the Iceman’s stomach content
Ancient DNA extraction and library preparation were conducted in the dedicated ancient DNA laboratory at EURAC research, Insti-
tute for Mummy Studies, Bolzano. The DNA was extracted from stomach contents using in-solution silica based protocol for ancient
DNA [73]. The extracted DNA was prepared for Illumina sequencing by blunt-end repair and ligation of universal Illumina adapters
(31). The library was shipped at �20�C to Trinity College Dublin and Illumina barcoded at the 50 end there [74]. A custom RNA capture
produced from reference domesticate mitochondrial genomes by MYcroarray (Mycroarray, 5692 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI
e5
Current Biology 28, 2348–2355.e1–e9, July 23, 2018
 48105) was used to enrich the indexed library for mitochondrial genomes (following the manufacturer’s protocol). The captured library
was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform at TrinSeq St James’s Hospital Dublin (65 bp single-end sequencing kit). Data were
quality assessed with fastqc, sequencing produced 4,905,473 raw reads, of which 95.5% passed adaptor trimming by
AdapterRemoval [47]. To provide an overview of which mammalian DNA sequences were captured, the recovered reads were
mapped to an array of candidate mammalian genomes using FastqScreen (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
fastq_screen/) (see Data S1_FastQScreen enriched reads) and bwa aligner (arguments: aln –l 1000 –n 0.01). Mapping sequence
data showed that the captured library contained reads specific for red deer (Cervus elaphus, reference accession code:
AB245427), ibex (Capra ibex, reference accession code: NC_020623) and human (reference accession code: NC_012920.1).
Mapped reads were further analyzed for these three species, SAMtools (45) filtered out reads below mapping quality 30. DeDup
(https://github.com/apeltzer/DeDup) removed duplicate reads (see Data S1). mapDamage displayed the presence of lesions
associated with ancient DNA [22] (see Figure S3D), showing that on 10% of fragments had deamination lesions at the 50 end of
fragments. To investigate variants in the maped mitochondrial data, GATK UnifiedCaller created vcf. files from the bam files and var-
iants were quantified with MultiVcfAnalyser, genotypes with a quality below 30 were filtered [48]. To further reduce the potentially
confounding data from cross mapping or misincorporation of deaminated positions, only SNPs with a consensus above 80%
were considered with respect to the overlapping reads (see Data S1_Variants enriched reads). This filtering strategy effectively
removed confounding SNPs as demonstrated by the exact match to the Iceman’s mitochondrial haplotype defining SNPs [75].
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analyses
To further confirm our metagenomic findings in the Iceman intestinal content shotgun datasets we additionally performed a PCR-
based analysis with selected DNA extracts targeting small DNA fragments of animal and plant barcodes (see Key Resources Table).
To assess the animal diet of the Iceman, we amplified the fragments of two different mitochondrial loci, the 12S rRNA gene (12S rRNA)
and the cytochrome B gene (cytB). For the cytB gene we applied a previously published PCR assay specifically designed to target
different animal species [35]. In parallel, this assay excludes the amplification of human background DNA. Furthermore, we designed
for this study a second PCR assay targeting a smaller fragment of the 12S rRNA gene of different animal species, including the human
12S rRNA gene variant. To further investigate via PCR the plant diet of the Iceman we amplified in the intestinal content DNA extracts
the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron [37] and a 153 bp fragment of the chloroplast gene coding for the large subunit of the
ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) [36]. To test for possible external contaminations, we included in all PCR assays the extrac-
tion blanks and two negative PCR controls. In addition, we included in the plant PCR assays an Iceman lung tissue sample to test for
possibly inhaled pollen background. All PCR assays have been performed in the ancient DNA laboratory of the Eurac research Insti-
tute for Mummy Studies conducted in 50ml volume using the Amplitaq Gold mastermix 360, 1 mM primers and 5ml DNA template.
Template DNA was initially denatured at 95�C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95�C, 45 s), primer annealing
(55�C, 45 s) and elongation (72�C, 45 s), with 4 min of final extension at 72�C. Only for the 12S rRNA gene PCR assay 30 cycles instead
of 40 cycles were applied. The first PCR was followed by a second PCR using 1:50 dilution of the first PCR product and 10 to 15
additional cycles of amplification with barcoded PCR primers [76]. The barcoded Primers consisted of the gene-specific PCR primer
sequences tagged with the sequencing adapters for GS FLX Titanium chemistry, including (50-30): Titanium adaptor (454 Life
Sciences), a sample specific ten-base multiplex identifiers (MIDs on the reverse primer), a linker sequence (‘‘TC’’ for forward primer,
‘‘CA’’ for reverse primer), and the gene-specific PCR primer. Amplicons were sequenced form the reverse side on a GS FLX
instrument using Titanium chemistry (454 Life Sciences). For details to the amplicon datasets please refer to Data S1_ 454 Amplicon
datasets. Sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and filtered using the mothur software package [49]. To obtain a taxonomic over-
view of the reads, we performed a sequence similarity search using blastn (40) with default parameters and the complete NCBI-nt
database as reference database. The results were taxonomically assigned using MEGAN6 [40] with the lowest common ancestor
(LCA) of hits within 10% of the bitscore of the best hits and a minimum number of 2 reads that a taxon must obtain (see Figure S4).
Proteomic analysis of the Iceman stomach content
We studied the proteome of three distinct stomach content samples (1051L, 1051LP & 1054LP) by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics using Orbitrap and QExactive technologies. For methodological details to the sample preparation,
the LC-MS approach and the mass spectrometry data analysis please refer to the publication of Maixner et al. [11]. Briefly, each
stomach content sample was solubilized, tryptic digested and fractionated using 1D SDS-PAGE or OffGEL isolelectric focusing
(OGE) and then analyzed by high-mass accuracy Orbitrap or QExactive mass spectrometry instruments interfaced with nanospray
liquid chromatography. Peptide identities were determined using the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) software tool suite to define
proteins contained in the stomach content samples [50].
The protein database used in the comparative analysis contained amino acid sequences constructed from multiple species.
75,649 protein sequences were to Homo sapiens (UniProt reference proteome, release 2012_10 ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uni-
prot/previous_releases/release-2012_10/relnotes.txt) supplemented with sequences translated directly from the Iceman’s genome
[34, 58]. Additionally, 936 and 1,278 Cervus elaphus protein sequences were obtained from NCBI and UniProt, respectively (obtained
November 17, 2015). 30,155 Capra hircus protein sequences were obtained from NCBI (October 19, 2015) as the closest surrogate
for the ibex proteome. The 1,011 available Triticum monococcum protein sequences from UniProt were supplemented with 95,051
Triticum aestivum sequences from UniProt (release 2015_11) to provide a complete proteome representing Triticinae. 28,356
open reading frames of at least 30 amino acids were obtained from a previously published Pteridium aquilinum transcriptome
Current Biology 28, 2348–2355.e1–e9, July 23, 2018
e6
 [77]. An additional 67 protein sequences to common laboratory contaminants were also added. An equal number of shuffled decoy
sequences were generated to peform database search validation, as described previously [11].
The identified proteins (167), evaluated by statistical analysis using the TPP to 1% false discovery rate, were further taxonomically
screened for homologous peptides and subsequently filtered for peptide sequences that can be unambiguously assigned to certain
plant and animal families. To taxonomically assign the retrieved peptides based on the lowest common ancestor we performed a
BLAST search [42] against the NCBI nr database and further analyzed the BLAST hits with the MEGAN6 software package [40].
In total, 20 of the 167 proteins were unambiguously identified with peptides assigned to the families Triticeae, Caprinae, and Cervinae
(see Data S2_ Proteomics).
Lipid analysis of the Iceman stomach content
During the preliminary inspection of the Iceman’s stomach content, two samples were isolated, described as ‘‘lipid accumulation’’
and ‘‘lipid/protein mix.’’ Both samples were inhomogeneous, and multiple aliquots (a few milligrams each) were taken for lipid
analysis. Aliquots were extracted using chloroform-methanol/based liquid-liquid extraction and analysis using an unbiased approach
with reverse phase liquid chromatography separation and quadrupole time-of-flight (QToF) tandem mass spectrometry analysis
(RP-LC/MSMS). Lipid analyses of aliquots from the Iceman stomach content were undertaken independently at two laboratories
in Singapore and Seattle, USA. The analytical methods were as follows:
Singapore analytical method
Sample Preparation: Portions of two Iceman stomach samples and fresh animal tissue samples were dissected with a scalpel on an
aluminum foil-covered ice pack, and the weights were noted: 1) Iceman Lipid accumulation 1: 6.9 mg, 2) Iceman Lipid/protein mix 1:
4.5 mg, 3) Capra ibex muscle tissue: 17.9 mg, 4) Capra ibex adipose tissue: 8.2mg, 5) Capra ibex skin: 8.6mg, 6) Cervus elaphus
muscle tissue: 18.3 mg, 7) Cervus elaphus fat tissue: 15.0 mg, 8) Capra hircus cheese: 17.8mg, 9) Capra hircus milk: 27.5mg. For
details to the modern reference samples used in this study please refer to Table S12. Lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh
and Dyer extraction method [78]. The tissue pieces were transferred to glass homogenization tubes, and 300 mL of methanol
were added. Samples were homogenized using a benchtop homogenizer, and the homogenizer probe was rinsed with an extra
300mL methanol. 300 mL of chloroform were added to the homogenates (final volume 900 mL of chloroform/methanol 1/2 v/v). The
homogenizing rotor was carefully rinsed between each sample. A tube containing methanol only was used as negative control.
The bottom organic phases were recovered and transfer to clean tubes and the solvent was dried under nitrogen gas. Dried lipid
extracts were kept at �80�C, until LC/MS analysis for which they were re-suspended in 200mL chloroform/methanol (1/1 v/v). To
determine the approx. lipid amount (w/w) three stomach biopsies were first dried at 105�C for 24h and weighed. Then, the lipids
were extracted by the modified Bligh and Dyer extraction method (described above) and the extracts were dried at 105�C for 24h
and weighed.
LC/MS: Chromatography conditions were optimized to enable efficient separation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) by reverse phase
separation. LC/MS experiments were undertaken using an Agilent 1200 series HPLC-Chip system connected to Agilent 6540
Q-ToF. An Agilent C18 chip was used (75mm (i.d.) x 43 mm length, 5mm particle size, 300A
˚ pore size) with a binary solvent system
at a flow rate of 0.3mL/min. Solvent A was acetonitrile/water 40/60 v/v containing 5mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid,
and solvent B was isopropanol/acetonitrile 90/10 v/v containing 5mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid. The gradient was
as follows: 0%B for 1.5min, increase to 50%B in 2.0min, increase to 100% B in 18min, stay at 100% B for 10min, decrease to
0%B in 0.1min, stay at 0%B for 3.4min, total runtime: 35min. The Agilent 6540 Q-ToF spectrometer was operated in positive ion
mode; electrospray voltage was set to 1450 V (Vcap), temperature 300�C, drying gas 4L/min, fragmentor voltage 150 V. The instru-
ment was operated with MS acquisition rate of 1 spectra/sec. Injection volume was 1 to 2 mL. To monitor sample LC carryover and
cross-contamination, solvent blanks were run between samples.
Data Analyses: LC/MS data files were processed with the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Software Version B.05.01. The data
were manually curated to identify triglyceride ions ([M+NH4]+ adducts) based on retention time and accurate mass measurement
with mass accuracy < 5ppm. Intensities of the [M+NH4]+ adduct mono-isotopic peaks were used for calculating the relative
abundance of triglyceride molecular species. TAG have been successfully used in the identification of food remains in an archaeo-
logical context [26, 79]. Therefore, we decided to compare the relative abundance of TAG between the Iceman’s stomach samples
and with contemporary animal samples (See Data S2_Modern comparative samples). Following the genomics results, C. ibex and
C. elaphus meat samples were obtained from local hunters. In addition, and in view of the interest regarding the question of dairy
consumption in early humans, samples of C. hircus milk and cheese were also sourced. To better compare TAG distribution between
samples, Mirabaud et al. [26] made use of two parameters: the average carbon number (M) and the distribution factor (DF), which can
be calculated by the following formulae:
M =

 where Pi is the relative abundance of a given TAG (in percentage of total TAG) and Ci is the total number of carbon atoms in the fatty
acyl chains.
Seattle analytical method
Sample Preparation: Portions of two Iceman samples and four fresh male tissue samples were dissected with a razor on an
aluminum-foil covered block on top of dry ice, and the weights were noted: 1) Iceman Lipid accumulation 5: 73 mg, 2) Iceman
Lipid-protein mix 5: 70 mg, 3) 0065206-19 adipose: 182 mg, 4) 0065251-10 adipose: 135 mg, 5) 0065251-29 skin (full thickness):
209 mg, 6) 0065206-09 skin (full thickness): 184 mg. The tissue pieces were transferred to homogenization tubes containing
2.38 mm metal beads, and 1 mL methanol. To serve as negative controls, two tubes containing methanol only were carried through
each step of sample preparation. Following bead beating, BCA protein estimation was performed on the soluble portion of each
lysate. The fresh tissue samples each contained between 500-2000 mg of soluble protein, and, surprisingly, each of the two Iceman
samples contained roughly 500 mg soluble protein. The lysates were transferred to silanized 13x100 glass vials, and total lipids were
extracted with chloroform/methanol using a modified ‘‘Folch’’ extraction protocol [80]. The combined aqueous upper phase and
interphase (containing protein precipitates) from each sample were dried and processed by multi-dimensional fractionation for
proteomics analyses in Seattle (see above). The lower organic phases were dried under nitrogen and stored at �30�C. The visual
appearance of the dried lipid extracts differed remarkably: Iceman extracts appeared as a dry brown powder, and the fresh tissue
extracts appeared as a viscous yellow liquid. For lipid LC/MS, 8 mL chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) was added to each extract, and
5 mL was used for injection. The extract was also diluted 100-fold and 5 mL was again used for injection. Additionally, neutral lipids
were obtained from the total lipid extract by solid-phase extraction (SPE) following a previously published method [81]. Briefly, 100 mL
of the total lipid extract was evaporated under N2 gas, re-dissolved in 1 mL isooctane/ethyl acetate (75/25 v/v), sonicated, and then
loaded onto 100 mg Biotage Isoelute XL silica cartridges. Neutral lipids were collected from the flow-through, and further washed and
collected from the column with isooctane/ethyl acetate (75/25 v/v). Eluants were evaporated under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 1 mL
chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v), and 5 mL was used for injection. Additionally, a 10-fold dilution was also used for injection.
LC/MS: Chromatography conditions were optimized to enable efficient separation of triacylglycerols (TAGs). An Agilent 1290
Infinity LC with a 2.1 mm (i.d.) x 100 mm, 3.5 mm Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 Narrow Bore Rapid Resolution column heated
to 30�C was used with a binary solvent system and a flow rate of 500 mL/min. The system was equilibrated with 80% of solvent A
(5 mM ammonium formate in methanol/water (99:1 v/v)) and 20% solvent B (5 mM ammonium formate in isopropanol/water
(99:1 v/v)). A 5 uL injection volume of the lipid extract (in 2:1 chloroform/methanol) was applied to the column, followed by a
30.0-min linear gradient to 20% solvent A/80% solvent B, and held for 2.5 min. An Agilent 6530 Q-ToF equipped with an Agilent
JetStream ESI source was used for accurate mass analysis of the LC eluent. Positive ion mass spectra data were acquired in
2 GHz Extended Dynamic Range mode at a rate of 1.02 spectra/s, and data was collected as profiled spectra over a mass range
of 150 to 1500 m/z. For MS/MS analyses, a fixed collision energy of 40 V was used for fragmentation. To monitor sample LC carryover
and cross-contamination, several solvent blanks were run between samples, and sample order was considered carefully.
Data Analyses: LC/MS data files were processed with the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Software version B.03.01. Molecular
features (MFs) were extracted from the raw MS1 data using the Molecular Feature Extraction (MFE) algorithm with a peak filter
of R 10,000 counts. The resulting MFs were then identified with MassHunter by searching a custom database containing 690
TAG ions corresponding to [M+Na]+ and [M+NH4]+ adducts, and 99 [M+NH4]+ cholesterol ester ions, using a ± 5 ppm search window.
For quantitative purposes, lipid groups were compared using the [M+NH4]+ molecular ion height. See Data S2 for a summary of the
lipid analysis results.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy
Meat fiber assemblies within the Iceman food bolus samples were identified with an inverted optical microscope (Axiovert 135, Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). Subsequently, the coarse topography of the putative meat fibers was analyzed by laser scanning
microscope (LSM) images (VK 8710, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) while high-resolution images of defined sample areas were taken
with a NanoWizard-II AFM (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany). The AFM was operated in the intermittent contact mode and silicon
cantilevers (BS Tap 300, Budget Sensors, Redding, USA) with nominal spring constants of 40 N/m, resonance frequencies of
300 kHz, and tip radii of 10 nm were used. All images were taken at lab conditions (22�C and about 45% relative humidity).
To assess the molecular composition of the samples, Raman spectra were taken with a confocal Raman microscope (WITec alpha
300 R, WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany). The Raman system was operated with a laser (frequency doubled Nd:YAG-laser with an
excitation wavelength of 532 nm) at 1.0 mW laser power, to avoid sample damage (photodegradation). The backscattered light
from the sample was detected with a vacuum sealed, high-sensitivity, back-illuminated CCD camera cooled to �56�C. The
spectrometer was equipped with a 600 g/mm grating enabling a spectral resolution of approximately 3 cm-1 per CCD-pixel. Single
spectra of each sample are average spectra of 10 accumulations with up to 180 s of integration time. Due to the confocal setup of the
microscope and the objectives used, Raman spectra were collected from a sample area with approximately 400 nm diameter and a
focal depth of about 1 mm.
