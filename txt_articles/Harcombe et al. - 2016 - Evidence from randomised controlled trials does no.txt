ABSTRACT
Objectives: National dietary guidelines were
introduced in 1977 and 1983, by the USA and UK
governments, respectively, with the ambition of
reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality by
reducing dietary fat intake. A recent systematic review
and meta-analysis by the present authors, examining
the randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence
available to the dietary committees during those time
periods, found no support for the recommendations to
restrict dietary fat. The present investigation extends
our work by re-examining the totality of RCT evidence
relating to the current dietary fat guidelines.
Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of
RCTs currently available, which examined the
relationship between dietary fat, serum cholesterol and
the development of CHD, was undertaken.
Results: The systematic review included 62 421
participants in 10 dietary trials: 7 secondary prevention
studies, 1 primary prevention and 2 combined. The
death rates for all-cause mortality were 6.45% and
6.06% in the intervention and control groups,
respectively. The risk ratio (RR) from meta-analysis
was 0.991 (95% CI 0.935 to 1.051). The death rates
for CHD mortality were 2.16% and 1.80% in the
intervention and control groups, respectively. The RR
was 0.976 (95% CI 0.878 to 1.084). Mean serum
cholesterol levels decreased in all intervention groups
and all but one control group. The reductions in mean
serum cholesterol levels were significantly greater in
the intervention groups; this did not result in
significant differences in CHD or all-cause mortality.
Conclusions: The current available evidence found no
significant difference in all-cause mortality or CHD
mortality, resulting from the dietary fat interventions.
RCT evidence currently available does not support the
current dietary fat guidelines. The evidence per se lacks
generalisability for population-wide guidelines.
INTRODUCTION
US
public
health
dietary
advice
was
announced by the Select Committee on
Nutrition and Human Needs in 19771 and
was followed by UK public health dietary
advice
issued
by
the
National
Advisory
Committee
on
Nutritional
Education
in
1983.2
Dietary
recommendations
in
both
cases focused on reducing dietary fat intake,
specifically to (i) reduce overall fat consump-
tion to 30% of total energy intake and (ii)
KEY QUESTIONS
What is already known about this subject?
▸ Dietary recommendations were introduced in the
USA (1977) and in the UK (1983) to (i) reduce
overall fat consumption to 30% of total energy
intake and (ii) reduce saturated fat consumption
to 10% of total energy intake. We recently
reported, in a previous meta-analysis, that the
available randomised controlled trial (RCT) evi-
dence did not support the introduction of these
dietary fat guidelines. Further, we reported that
the RCTs were undertaken on 2467 men from
exclusively
or
largely
secondary
prevention
studies.
What does this study add?
▸ RCT
evidence
currently
available
does
not
support the current recommendations to restrict
dietary fat. The lack of generalisability of current
evidence prevails. This study finds that only one
primary prevention RCT, including men and
women, is available to inform public health advi-
sors
and
that
this
was
without
statistical
significance.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸ Public health advice on dietary fat has prevailed
since 1977/1983 in the absence of supporting
evidence from RCTs. The US 2015 draft dietary
guidelines exclude recommendations for total fat
for the first time, but maintain the advice to
restrict saturated fat. The current evidence does
not
support
this
recommendation.
The
UK
advice has not changed since 1983. Clinicians
would be justified in taking a more cautionary
approach to their advising of patients on these
dietary fat recommendations.

 reduce saturated fat (SFA) consumption to 10% of total
energy intake.
The recommendations were intended to address mor-
tality from coronary heart disease (CHD). We recently
published a systematic review and meta-analysis,3 which
reported that evidence from randomised controlled
trials (RCTs), available to the dietary guideline commit-
tees, did not support the introduced dietary fat recom-
mendations. This systematic review and meta-analysis
extends this work by re-examining the totality of RCT
evidence, currently available, relating to the present
dietary fat guidelines.
While no previous study had reviewed the evidence
available to the 1977 and 1983 committees, a number of
meta-analyses have reviewed RCT and/or epidemio-
logical evidence available at their respective times of
publication.4–11 None has found any significant result
for dietary fat intervention and mortality: all-cause, car-
diovascular disease (CVD) or CHD mortality.
A meta-analysis by Skeaff and Miller in 2009 included
28 US and European cohorts (6600 CHD deaths among
280 000 participants) and found no clear relationship
between total or SFA intake and CHD events or deaths.4
In 2010, Siri-Tarino et al5 undertook a meta-analysis of
21 prospective cohort studies involving 347 747 partici-
pants, evaluating the association of SFA with CVD. They
reported that there is no significant evidence for con-
cluding that dietary SFA is associated with an increased
risk of CHD or CVD.
Hooper et al6 7 examined RCT evidence in 2011 and
2015 and found no significant difference for total mor-
tality or cardiovascular mortality resulting from modified
dietary fat intake, reduced dietary fat intake or com-
bined modified and reduced dietary fat intake.
Chowdhury et al’s8 meta-analysis of RCTs and prospect-
ive cohort studies found no association of dietary SFA
intake, nor of circulating SFAs, with CHD.
Schwingshackl and Hoffmann examined RCTs that
reduced or modified dietary fat with regard to all-cause
mortality, CVD mortality and CVD events, in participants
with established CHD. They concluded that there was
no evidence for benefit of reduced/modified fat diets in
the secondary prevention of CHD.9
Mozaffarian et al10 reported evidence that consuming
polyunsaturated fats in place of SFAs reduced CHD
events, not mortality, in RCTs.
A number of these reviews have been challenged.
Stamler posed questions following the Siri-Tarino et al
publication.12 Chowdhury et al’s8 meta-analysis received
a number of letters of response, which led to the ori-
ginal article being amended. Mozaffarian et al’s review
was criticised13 for excluding two unfavourable trials14 15
and for including the non-randomised, cross-over trial
excluded by other reviews.16 17
The most recent meta-analysis by Hooper et al7 sug-
gested that reduction of SFA intake may result in a small
but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular
risk, not mortality.
There were two important findings of Harcombe
et al:3 first, the evidence available to the dietary commit-
tees did not support the introduced guidelines; second,
the evidence available had serious limitations and was
inappropriate to use for population-wide recommenda-
tions. The six studies available in 198314 15 18–21 had
reviewed 2467 men and no women. Five of the six
studies
were
secondary
prevention;
one
included
primary and secondary prevention subjects.21
Based on these secondary findings, selection criteria
for meta-analysis to inform population-wide recommen-
dations should be restricted to RCTs, of sufficient size
and duration, with primary prevention subjects, man
and woman. There is only one study meeting these cri-
teria,22 the Minnesota Coronary Survey, and the results
of this were not significant.
As a meta-analysis cannot be undertaken on the one
primary
prevention,
both-sex,
study
available,
this
follow-up study retains the selection criteria and thus
limitations of Harcombe et al3 to re-examine dietary
guidelines, for total and SFA, to assess their evidence
base against the RCT evidence currently available.
METHODS
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA)
guidelines.23
Search strategy
A search was undertaken to identify RCTs that examined
the relationship between modified or reduced dietary
fat intake, serum cholesterol and mortality from CHD
and all-causes. Exclusion criteria were as follows: study
being
observational;
non-randomised
and/or
multi-
factorial in design. Inclusion criteria were as follows: ran-
domised dietary intervention study; study hypothesis
relating to a reduction or modification of dietary fat;
participants were human adults; study was a minimum of
1 year in duration; primary study outcome was all-cause
and CHD mortality; and data on all-cause mortality,
CHD mortality and cholesterol measurements were
available.
Searches were performed
of the
literature using
MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library. AMED
and SIGLE (grey literature sources) were not relied
upon, as their periods covered were not compatible:
1985 and 1992, respectively24 25 (figure 1).
Selection of studies
Of 486 identified articles, 346 were rejected on review of
the title and abstract. Of these, 119 were rejected for
being review, discussion or historical articles. In total, 88
were commentaries, editorials or letters. A total of 48
were rejected for having an intervention relating to a
particular food or supplement, rather than dietary fat.
There were 30 studies where animals or children/

(PREDIMED)
study30
was
rejected for non-availability of CHD mortality and total
cholesterol data.
To ascertain the validity of eligible randomised trials, a
pair of reviewers (ZH and BD) worked independently to
determine which studies met the inclusion criteria. The
same 10 were agreed on. Risk of bias was further
assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration assessment
tool31 for selection bias (random sequence generation,
allocation concealment); performance/detection bias
(blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of
outcome assessment); attrition bias (incomplete data
outcome);
and
reporting
bias
(selective
reporting)
(figure 2). Additionally, the meta-analyses for all-cause
mortality (figure 3) and CHD deaths (figure 4) were
tested for sensitivity analysis of the exclusion of any one
study.

RESULTS
Participants and study design
The 10 identified RCTs included a total of 3888 deaths
from all-causes and 1218 deaths from CHD among
62 421 participants (table 1). The most recent trial, the
WHI, dominated the data pool with 78% of the partici-
pants,29 but the results remained non-significant with
the exclusion of this study. Excluding this study leaves
13 586 participants and results in a risk ratio (RR) for
all-cause mortality from meta-analysis of 1.005 (95% CI
0.922 to 1.097) and a RR for CHD mortality from
meta-analysis of 0.962 (95% CI 0.850 to 1.089) (both
random-effects methodology).
The WHI trial was a primary and secondary preven-
tion trial for women only. The Minnesota Coronary
Survey was a primary prevention study, with data for
men and women reported separately.22 The LA Veterans
Study21 comprised one-fifth secondary and four-fifths
primary prevention subjects. The remaining studies were
secondary
prevention
studies
with
exclusively
male
participants.
The mean duration of the 10 trials was 4.7±3.3 years.
The weighted mean duration (person years by partici-
pants) was 6.8±2 years.
All trials were parallel and randomised, avoiding
selection bias (figure 2).31 Two studies reported alloca-
tion
concealment;14

the
remaining
eight
were
unclear for this aspect of selection bias. Eight were
blinded for outcome assessment14 18 19 21 22 27–29 and

no, or unclear, blinding on either side,15

risk
of
performance

bias.

 implausible
(egg
consumption
quantified,
vegetable
oils added and animal fats restricted). The Minnesota
Coronary Survey was reported as double blinded and
this was plausible given the dietary intervention.22 The
open enrolment and departure in the LA Veterans and
Minnesota institutions21 22 produced attrition bias. The
STARS28 was judged unclear for attrition bias for the
relatively high number of dropouts in small participant
numbers. All studies were judged low risk for reporting
bias, as there was no evidence of any data being with-
held (figure 2).
The meta-analyses for all-cause mortality (figure 3)
and CHD deaths (figure 4) were tested for sensitivity
analysis of the exclusion of any one study. There were no
circumstances in which the exclusion of any one study
made the overall effect size significant.
There was little evidence for between-study heterogen-
eity. For all deaths, the Q-value was 7.915 (11 df), but
this was not statistically significant; p=0.721. I² was 0.000
and T² was 0.000, indicating no difference in true
effects. For CHD deaths, the Q-value was 9.173 (11 df),
but this was also not statistically significant; p=0.606. I²
was 0.000 and T² was 0.000.
Visual inspection of the funnel plots revealed that
one study was touching the outside of the SE funnel
for the meta-analysis of all deaths and CHD deaths.
The two, small, oil interventions14 produced asymmetry
on the lower right-hand side of the funnel, which was
countered by the small STARS representation on the
lower left-hand side.28 The Egger’s regression test indi-
cated no statistically significant asymmetry for all-cause
mortality and CHD deaths. The Egger’s regression
intercept was 0.337 (95% CI, two-tailed, −0.489 to
1.163) (one-tailed p=0.192; two-tailed p=0.384) for all-
cause mortality and 0.380 (95% CI, two-tailed, −0.756
to 1.517) (one-tailed p=0.237; two-tailed p=0.473) for
CHD deaths.
Interventions and comparisons
A total of 6 of the 10 RCTs did not examine either of
the introduced dietary guidelines: a total fat consump-
tion of 30%; or a SFA consumption of 10%, of energy
intake.14 18–21 29 Four trials examined the administration
of vegetable oil,14 18 20 21 to effect reduced intake of
animal fat. The Research Committee Low-fat Diet19 and
the
WHI29
studied
an
approximate
20%
fat
diet.
Woodhill et al15 and Frantz et al22 reviewed the conse-
quence of a 10% SFA diet, without the total fat dietary
guideline restriction. Woodhill et al reported higher inci-
dence of all-cause mortality and CHD deaths in the
intervention group. Frantz et al recorded no difference
in all-cause mortality or CHD deaths. The DART27
tested a 30% total fat diet although this was not a con-
trolled variable, as the intervention also tried to achieve
a 1:1 polyunsaturated to SFA ratio. The STARS28 was the
first to examine targets approximating to those set by
dietary guidelines with a total fat consumption of 27%
and an 8–10% SFS intake.
Outcomes: all-cause mortality
Across 10 studies, containing 12 dietary interventions,
involving 26 354 participants in the intervention groups
and 36 067 participants in the control groups, there
were 1701 deaths in the intervention and 2187 deaths in
the control groups. All-cause mortality was 6.45% in the
intervention groups and 6.06% in the control groups.
For all-cause mortality, the WHI study29 carried the
greatest weight, 54.35% (figure 3; random-effects meth-
odology). Three studies, comprising four interventions,
carried a combined weight of 35%.20–22 The Rose et al14
corn and olive oil interventions had negligible impact
on the overall effect, with weights of 0.04% and 0.07%,
respectively, as did the STARS with a weight of 0.07%.28
The RR for all 12 interventions was 0.991 (95% CI 0.935
to 1.051). The overall effect measurement lies on the
line of no effect. There was no statistically significant dif-
ference between dietary interventions and all-cause
mortality.
CHD mortality
The 12 interventions recorded 568 deaths from CHD
among 26 354 participants in the intervention groups
and 650 deaths from CHD among 36 067 participants in
the control groups. The death rates for CHD mortality
were 2.16% and 1.80% in the intervention and control
groups, respectively. The forest plot for the dietary inter-
ventions
and
deaths
from
CHD
produced
the
meta-analysis
shown
in
figure
4
(random-effects
methodology).
For CHD mortality, the WHI study29 carried the great-
est weight, 27.59% (figure 4; random-effects method-
ology). The Oslo study20 was comparable with a weight
of 21.36% and the DART27 contributed 15.56% to the
weighting. The Rose et al14 corn and olive oil interven-
tions had negligible impact on the overall effect, with
weights of 0.14% and 0.24%, respectively, as did the
STARS with a weight of 0.23%.28 The RR for all 12 inter-
ventions was 0.976 (95% CI 0.878 to 1.084). The overall
effect measurement lies on the line of no effect. There
was no statistically significant difference between the
dietary interventions and heart deaths.
Serum cholesterol levels
Mean serum cholesterol levels decreased in all groups,
control and intervention, except for the DART,27 where
cholesterol levels were 1.2% higher in the control group
after 2 years. This was unlikely to be clinically relevant.35
None of the reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels
exceeded the critical difference of 19%, calculated by
Fraser and Fogarty35 as the requirement for significance
(p<0.05).
Three studies alone15 27 28 reported SDs and signifi-

 reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels in the inter-
vention and control groups as 10.2±32.0 mg/dL and 6.9
±31.9 mg/Dl, respectively, and reported the difference
between the reductions, 3.26 mg/dL, as significant at
p<0.05 from a 2-sample test.
The standardised mean difference in serum choles-
terol levels, for the 10 trials (12 interventions) com-
bined, was −11.4%±6.5% for the intervention groups
and −4.7%±4.8% for the control groups (table 1). The
effect size was 1.18.
DISCUSSION
The
main
findings
of
our
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis are that currently available RCT evidence
does not support the current dietary fat guidelines. RCT
evidence indicates that dietary modification may reduce
serum cholesterol to a marginally greater extent in inter-
vention groups, compared with controls. However, this
reduction in serum cholesterol does not appear to trans-
late into an improved survival from all causes or CHD.
Design limitations
As noted in the introduction, the fundamental design
limitation of dietary fat interventions available to inform
public health advice is that only one study22 has been
undertaken involving men and women without previous
heart disease. All other RCTs have been single-sex
and/or secondary prevention studies.
The method of extracting dietary information was a
limitation of all studies. Dietary recall is generally unreli-
able and 24-hour recall may not be representative of
usual diet.36 37 Dietary surveys, where food is weighed at
the time of being recorded, are also unreliable.38 39
Woodhill et al noted that it is ‘insuperable’ to isolate
dietary factors in a secondary prevention study. This is a
flaw of all secondary prevention studies, not a unique
flaw of this study. The study noted that changes in
smoking habit, dietary pattern, body weight, lifestyle and
physical activity before and after entry to the trial may
have had a significant effect on prognosis (page 326).15
There are some additional design limitations among
the available RCTs, which may confound interpretation.
A number of studies14 18 19 28 impaired assessment of
the primary dietary intervention by adding other dietary
restrictions, such as the avoidance of processed foods.
This would impact industrially produced trans fat intake,
which is associated with CHD.8
40 The low-fat diet19
resulted in the calorie intake in the intervention group
ranging between 330 and 780 calories fewer than that of
the control group. At the largest differential, observed
after 4 years of the study, the diet group was consuming
70% of the calorie intake of the control group. This
study reported mean weight loss as 7.5% in the interven-
tion group and 4.8% in the control group. This may
have favoured the intervention outcomes. The STARS28
may also have favoured the intervention group by
restricting participants to 1200 kcal daily until a body
mass index (BMI) of 25 was achieved. Further, dietetic
counselling and suitable foods were given to participants
in the intervention group who did not achieve or main-
tain
serum
cholesterol reductions
of 15%,
making
serum cholesterol levels a target, not an outcome.
The LA Veterans Study21 recorded the lowest RR for
CHD deaths for the intervention group: 0.816 (95% CI
0.552 to 1.206) (figure 3). However, there were import-
ant differences in the groups at study entry, favouring
the intervention outcomes: 2.8% of the intervention
group were octogenarians, compared with 5% in the
control group; 11% of the experiment group were heavy
smokers (more than one pack a day) compared with
17% of the control group.
Additional limitations were the short duration (1 year)
of the second largest study, the Minnesota Coronary
Survey with 9057 participants.22 Two of the studies were
small,14 28 although meta-analysis weights this accord-
ingly. Leren20 benefited from trial length, but the study
discussion noted that the test groups were too small to
be significant for fatal incidences. The summary also
reported that CHD mortality was correlated with age,
blood pressure, body weight, smoking habits and a com-
bination of these factors, meaning that the association
with diet alone could not be isolated.
The WHI study29 was of substantial size and duration,
but with a number of confounding variables. It was
limited in its focus on postmenopausal women, aged
between 50 and 79, and who were not already consum-
ing dietary fat below 32% of total calorie intake.
Participants
were
additionally
invited
to
receive
hormone
therapy
and
participation
in
a
calcium/
vitamin D supplement trial was offered after 1 year. This
study alone included cholesterol-lowering medication,
which was taken by 12% of participants in the interven-
tion and control groups.
A limitation of the meta-analysis of the 10 studies com-
bined was that all RCTs differed in duration; number of
participants; nature of intervention; other factors held
constant and subject age groups, undermining possible
conclusions, although the statistical homogeneity helps
to mitigate concerns.
Study conclusions
Only one of the 10 RCTs presented a case for dietary
guidelines. The STARS28 claimed that its findings sup-
ported the use of a lipid-lowering diet in men with
CHD. The 5-year review of the Oslo Diet-Heart Study26
concluded that the cholesterol-lowering diet reduced
the incidence of total CHD relapses. The conclusion
after 11 years was more reserved: that sudden death in
survivors of myocardial infarction was uninfluenced by
diet.20
Four studies were neutral in their findings.18 22 27 29
The MRC study found no evidence from the London
trial that the relapse rate in myocardial infarction is
materially affected by the unsaturated fat content of the
diet.18 The DART27 made no claim for dietary fat

 reductions, but concluded that two to three portions of
fatty fish each week may reduce mortality in men who
have
recovered
from
a
myocardial
infarction.
The
Minnesota
Coronary
Survey22
found
no
differences
between the treatment and control groups for cardiovas-
cular events, cardiovascular deaths or total mortality.
The WHI29 reported that an 8.2% energy decrease in
total fat intake had been achieved and a 2.9% energy
decrease in SFA intake, but that this did not reduce risk
of CHD.
The other four studies issued cautions about the safety
and/or efficacy of their interventions.14 15 19 21 Rose
et al14 reported that corn oil was most unlikely to be
beneficial, and was possibly harmful. The Research
Committee19 concluded that a low-fat diet has no place
in the treatment of myocardial infarction. Dayton et al21
noted the absence of any benefit for longevity and
expressed concern about toxicity of the intervention.
Woodhill et al15 reported that survival was significantly
better in the control than the diet group.
This meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, in comparison with
Harcombe et al’s review of 6 RCTs,3 increased the
number of people studied from 2467 to 62 447. It
increased the number of women studied from 0 to
53 499, the majority. It increased the number of primary
prevention subjects from 67621 to 56 291. However, 83%
of the primary prevention subjects were postmenopausal
women, so the concern about generalisability remains
for guidelines introduced for whole populations.
Review of dietary guidelines
The US dietary guidelines advisory committee (DGAC)
report was published in February 2015.41 The recom-
mendation to limit dietary cholesterol intake to 300 mg
a day has prevailed in the USA since 1977.1 The DGAC
stated that they will not bring forward this recommenda-
tion, because available evidence shows no appreciable
relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol
and serum cholesterol.41 The UK did not introduce
dietary cholesterol targets in the original guidelines2 42
and they have not been introduced since.43
The DGAC advice demonstrated further movement
away from the original dietary guidelines by containing
no total fat recommendation and a change in position
on dietary fat and CVD. The advisory report documen-
ted
the
findings
of
the
meta-analyses
by
Skeaff,4
Siri-Tarino,5 Hooper6 and Chowdhury,8 and concluded
that reducing total fat does not lower CVD risk.41 The
SFA guideline was reiterated, however, with the recom-
mendation to consume <10% of total calories from SFA
per day.41
The UK does not review dietary guidelines at regular
intervals. The target for total fat remains 30% of daily
total energy intake and 10% for SFA.43
Dietary fat guidelines were introduced with the inten-
tion of reducing CHD mortality. No meta-analysis has
found any significant difference for dietary fat inter-
ventions
and
all-cause
mortality
or
deaths
from
CHD.3–8 10 44 All but one study22 is of single-sex and/or
secondary prevention subjects. Even in men who have
already suffered a myocardial infarction, evidence does
not support dietary recommendations; yet they have
been issued for millions of citizens for three to four
decades.
The most recent meta-analysis,7 with the same single-
sex, secondary prevention limitations, suggested that
there may be a small reduction in cardiovascular risk on
reduction of SFA intake. It was further suggested that
replacing the energy from SFA with polyunsaturated fat
appeared to be a useful strategy, while replacement with
carbohydrate appeared less useful and replacement with
monounsaturated fat unclear. Of the 11 interventions
contributing to this conclusion, only one documented
both SFA reduction and reported that this was mainly
replaced with polyunsaturated fat.21
The future will undoubtedly consist of the tailoring of
diets and lifestyle to individual genomic make-up.45 This
will require the understanding of the genomic structure
of circulating lipid profiles and replicable data on genes
and diet interaction. Caution will be required in translat-
ing contemporary research on gene diet and lifestyle
into public health advice.
It is important that we learn from the study limitations
and lack of evidence on which current guidelines are
based and not make the same mistake with future guide-
lines or suggestions. Harcombe et al3 found that the
dietary fat guidelines were not evidence based. This
paper reiterates the finding and recommends that
national dietary advice needs urgent review.
