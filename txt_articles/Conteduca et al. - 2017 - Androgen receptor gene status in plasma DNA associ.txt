Background: There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers to guide personalized therapy in castration-resistant prostate can-
cer (CRPC). We aimed to clinically qualify androgen receptor (AR) gene status measurement in plasma DNA using multiplex
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in pre- and post-chemotherapy CRPC.
Methods: We optimized ddPCR assays for AR copy number and mutations and retrospectively analyzed plasma DNA from
patients recruited to one of the three biomarker protocols with prospectively collected clinical data. We evaluated associations
between plasma AR and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in 73 chemotherapy-naı
¨ve and 98 post-
docetaxel CRPC patients treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone (Primary cohort) and 94 chemotherapy-naı
¨ve patients treated
with enzalutamide (Secondary cohort; PREMIERE trial).
Results: In the primary cohort, AR gain was observed in 10 (14%) chemotherapy-naı
¨ve and 33 (34%) post-docetaxel patients and asso-
ciated with worse OS [hazard ratio (HR), 3.98; 95% CI 1.74–9.10; P< 0.001 and HR 3.81; 95% CI 2.28–6.37; P< 0.001, respectively], PFS

¨ve abiraterone-treated patients and were
also associated with worse OS (HR 3.26; 95% CI 1.47–not reached; P¼ 0.004). There was no interaction between AR and docetaxel sta-
tus (P¼ 0.83 for OS, P¼ 0.99 for PFS). In the PREMIERE trial, 11 patients (12%) with AR gain had worse PSA-PFS (sPFS) (HR 4.33; 95% CI
1.94–9.68; P< 0.001), radiographic-PFS (rPFS) (HR 8.06; 95% CI 3.26–19.93; P< 0.001) and OS (HR 11.08; 95% CI 2.16–56.95; P¼ 0.004).
Plasma AR was an independent predictor of outcome on multivariable analyses in both cohorts.
Conclusion: Plasma AR status assessment using ddPCR identifies CRPC with worse outcome to enzalutamide or abiraterone.
Prospective evaluation of treatment decisions based on plasma AR is now required.

Introduction
Inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) signaling with abiraterone or
enzalutamide is now standard treatment at emergence of castration-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the duration of response
is variable and overall survival (OS) in unselected patients is modest
despite some patients having responses that last several years [1, 2].
There is therefore an urgent need to develop biomarker strategies to
a priori identify CRPC patients who will derive minimal benefit
from AR targeting and offer them an alternative treatment para-
digm. Testing for plasma epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations has FDA clearance for selection of mutant lung cancer
patients for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and studies of plasma
DNA in multiple indications have suggested clinical utility for moni-
toring of mutations or copy number (CN) gain [3–6].
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and PCR-based studies have
identified associations between AR CN gain detected in plasma and
worse outcome with abiraterone or enzalutamide, in predominantly
post-docetaxel CRPC cohorts [7–12]. AR gene aberrations are rare
before hormone therapy but occur in metastases harvested at rapid
warm autopsy from up to 60% of patients [13]. Using NGS on
sequential plasma samples, we have identified two AR point muta-
tions [2105T>A (p.L702H) and 2632A>G (p.T878A)] as associating
with resistance to abiraterone, shown previously to be activated by
prednisone or progesterone, respectively [7, 8, 14, 15]. For enzaluta-
mide, the 2629T>C (p.F877L) point mutation has been reported as a
resistance mechanism [16, 17] although a recent study suggested it is
very uncommon [12]. Following a well-described roadmap for the
implementation of a biomarker test into routine clinical practice
[18], we aimed to optimize a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that
is fit for purpose and can be widely implemented on plasma DNA in
clinical laboratories. We sought to define AR CN and in a separate
reaction, AR mutation status: 2105T>A and 2632A>G in patients
considered for abiraterone and 2629T>C for patients treated with
enzalutamide. We then aimed to obtain stage one biomarker clinical
qualification for associations with clinical outcome on enzalutamide
or abiraterone in chemotherapy-naı
¨ve and post-docetaxel CRPC
patients treated in one of three biomarker protocols.
Materials and methods
Study design
This was a multi-institution analysis of plasma samples collected
prospectively in studies with the primary aim of biomarker evaluation.
The objectives were defined after sample collection but before plasma
analysis. Our first objective was to determine the correlation between
ddPCR testing for plasma AR and an orthogonal approach, NGS, in sam-
ples collected before starting treatment and after disease progression.
Our second objective was to evaluate associations between pre-treatment
plasma AR and clinical outcome in a primary cohort, representative of
both pre- and post-docetaxel patients, and test for interactions with prior
chemotherapy exposure. As no trial to date has randomized patients
between first-line enzalutamide or abiraterone and taxanes, we combined
data from four cohorts of men recruited to two biomarker protocols and
defined by treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone and prior chemo-
therapy status. Our third objective was to test our ddPCR assay in a sec-
ond cohort of chemotherapy-naı
¨ve men treated with enzalutamide in the
PREMIERE trial.
Participants
The primary cohort included patients participating in one of two proto-
cols separately approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Royal
Marsden (RM), London, UK (REC 04/Q0801/6), and Istituto Scientifico
Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Italy
(REC 2192/2013). Docetaxel in this cohort was only used in the CRPC
setting. The second cohort was the PREMIERE trial (EudraCT: 2014-
003192-28, NCT02288936) that was sponsored and conducted by the
Spanish Genito-Urinary oncology Group (SOGUG). The trial was
approved by the independent review board at each participating site.
This trial was designed to analyze the predictive value of the gene fusion
TMPRSS2-ETS in response to enzalutamide in patients with prostate
cancer. Exploratory endpoints included circulating cell-free DNA and
circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis. Data emerging after the trial was
designed and initiated [7, 19, 20] led the PREMIERE Trial Management
Group to additionally prioritize two alternative biomarkers for evalua-
tion, namely AR-V7 detected in CTCs as described previously [19] and
plasma AR. TMPRSS2-ETS analyses are on-going and will be reported
elsewhere. Preliminary AR-V7 data were presented in abstract form at the
ESMO 2016 Annual Meeting [21] and will be published elsewhere. These
analyses were based on the first censor cut-off, date May 2016. A second
data analysis is planned at a predefined time-point when enough events
have occurred to address the primary endpoint.
In both cohorts, patients were required to have histologically confirmed
prostate adenocarcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation, pro-
gressive disease despite ‘castration levels’ of serum testosterone (<50ng/
dl), on-going LHRH analogue treatment or prior surgical castration and
no prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. Additional selection
criteria by cohort are specified in the supplementary Appendix S1, available
at Annals of Oncology online. The choice of therapy in the primary cohort
was at the discretion of the treating physician, either enzalutamide 160 mg
once a day or abiraterone 1 g once a day and prednisone 5 mg twice daily.
In the PREMIERE trial, all patients received enzalutamide 160 mg once a
day. Treatment in both cohorts was administered continuously until evi-
dence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The studies were

 conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the
Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference of
Harmonization. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Procedures
Peripheral blood samples were collected within 30 days of treatment ini-
tiation and plasma aliquots stored at �80 �C. ddPCR assays were carried
out as described in detail in supplementary Appendix S2, available at
Annals of Oncology online. For each individual sample AR CN was esti-
mated using each of the reference genes NSUN3, ElF2C1, and AP3B1 and
using ZXDB at Xp11.21 as a control gene to determine X chromosome
CN. AR mutation detection assays were carried out for the AR mutations
2105T>A (p.L702H), 2632A>G (p.T878A), and 2629T>C (p.F877L)
with a limit of detection of 1%–2% using an input of 2–4 ng of DNA. For
NGS on plasma and patient-matched germline DNA, we used a custom-
ized AmpliSeq targeted gene panel including AR, sequenced on an
Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine or Proton as described previ-
ously [7, 8]. Computational analysis estimating the plasma DNA tumor
content, AR CN quantitation and point mutation detection (with a sensi-
tivity of 98%–99% depending on position and coverage) was carried out
as previously [8].
Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was assessed within 1 week of
starting treatment and monthly thereafter. Radiographic disease was
evaluated with the use of computed tomography and bone scan at the
time of screening and every 12 weeks on treatment. In the primary
cohort, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) were also measured within 1 week of starting treatment. In
PREMIERE, CTCs were evaluated pre-treatment using the AdnaTest for
Prostate Cancer (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) as described previously [21].
Outcomes
For the primary cohort, the primary endpoint was OS. The secondary
endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (biochemical and/or
radiographic and/or clinical) and PSA response. For PREMIERE, the pri-
mary endpoint was PSA-PFS (sPFS). Secondary endpoints included
radiographic-PFS (rPFS), OS and PSA response. OS was calculated from
initiation of therapy to death from any cause. Patients still alive at time of
last follow-up were censored. PFS was calculated from the first day of
enzalutamide or abiraterone therapy to the date of progression disease or
death. Radiographic progression was defined using Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. PSA decline was evaluated accord-
ing to Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines [22].
Statistical analyses
An R script [23] was developed to identify the optimal AR CN cut-point
that associated with OS in the primary cohort, using maximum log-
likelihood as correlative statistics in a multivariable Cox regression model
by an approach described previously (supplementary Appendix S3, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online) [24]. The process was bootstrapped
with 30,000 iterations to provide the measures of dispersion. Remaining
analyses were conducted using Stata/MP 13.1 for Windows. Time-to-
event outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier survivor estimates,
log-rank test and univariate and multivariable Cox-proportional hazards
models. The association of clinically relevant baseline factors (previously
showed to be associated with prognosis [25, 26]) with OS and PFS was
examined using a univariate Cox regression model. A multivariable Cox
regression model was then carried out with a stepwise procedure to iden-
tify the prognostic factors for OS and PFS with a significance level
of <0.05 for entry into the model. All tests were two-sided and an a-error
of 5% was considered as significant. Odds ratios of PSA response were
determined using a 2�2 contingency table and significant differences
using Fisher’s exact test (supplementary Appendix S3, available at Annals
of Oncology online).
Results
Clinical characteristics of the primary cohort
In the primary cohort, we had 171 men who started treatment
with enzalutamide or abiraterone between 31 January 2011 and 9
June 2016, 73 before docetaxel and 98 after. All had received bica-
lutamide. Patient and treatment characteristics at the time of
sample collection are detailed in Table 1.
Analytic testing of multiplex ddPCR for
determination of plasma AR status
We used an optimized multiplex AR CN ddPCR assay on 2–4 ng
DNA from all pre-treatment samples and an additional 42 sam-
ples collected after disease progression. On a further 2–4 ng DNA,
we tested for AR mutations. From patients in the primary cohort
with ddPCR data, we had NGS data available from our previous
publication [8] for 86 samples and we carried out NGS on an
additional 75 (samples described in supplementary Table S1,
available at Annals of Oncology online). We observed a strong
agreement between NGS and ddPCR for CN quantitation
(n ¼ 161, Bland–Altman test: mean difference, �0.02, 95% CI
Limits of agreement, �2.45 to 2.41) (supplementary Figure S1A
and Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). Estimation
of AR mutation allelic frequency by ddPCR also displayed strong
agreement with NGS (n ¼ 60, Bland–Altman test: mean differ-
ence �0.001, 95% CI limits of agreement, �0.015 to 0.016) with
no cases of mutations detected by one approach but not the other
(supplementary Figure S1B, available at Annals of Oncology
online).
Plasma AR status in the primary cohort
In our primary cohort, eight post-docetaxel (but no chemother-
apy-naı
¨ve) abiraterone patients were AR point mutation positive
before treatment (Table 1). We planned to analyze these sepa-
rately for associations with outcome. All four patients with a
2105T>A (p.L702H) mutation had received at least 6 months of
treatment with prednisone. We did not detect a 2629T>C
(p.F877L) AR point mutation before treatment or in an addi-
tional 26 samples collected after progression on enzalutamide.
Using maximum likelihood ratio as correlative statistics com-
bined with boot-strapping, we identified an AR CN cut-point of
2.01 [interquartile range (IQR), 1.82–2.77 copies] for splitting
patients into two distinct prognostic groups (supplementary
Figure S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). Use of this cut-
off was also supported by 95.5% concordance between NGS and
ddPCR for classifying AR CN status (supplementary Table S2,
available at Annals of Oncology online). Overall, 10 (14%) chemo-
therapy-naı
¨ve and 33 (34%) docetaxel-treated patients had AR
gain (Table 1).
Plasma AR associates with worse outcome in the
primary cohort
There was a significant association for AR gain and OS in both
chemotherapy-naı
¨ve (median 12.40 months versus not reached;
HR 3.98; 95% CI 1.74–9.10; P < 0.001) (Figure 1A), and post-

 95% CI 2.28–6.37; P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). For AR mutants in
abiraterone-treated, post-docetaxel patients, a significant associa-
tion with worse survival was also seen (median 4.06months; HR
3.26; 95% CI 1.47–not reached; P ¼ 0.004) (Figure 1B). We also
observed a significant association between PFS and AR gain for che-
motherapy-naı
¨ve patients treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone
(median 7.30 versus 9.20 months; HR 2.18; 95% CI 1.08–4.39;
P ¼ 0.03) (Figure 1C) and for post-docetaxel patients (median 5.00
versus 7.36 months; HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.23–3.11; P ¼ 0.01) (Figure
1D). A trend was seen for AR mutants to have worse PFS (median
4.10 months; HR 2.10; 95% CI 0.98–4.51; P ¼ 0.057) (Figure 1D).
Interactions between AR CN and treatment (abiraterone versus
enzalutamide) (P ¼ 0.41 for OS and P ¼ 0.11 for PFS) or chemo-
therapy status (P ¼ 0.83 for OS, P ¼ 0.99 for PFS) examined in the
Cox models were not significant. We also evaluated the association
of AR status with the rate of PSA decline in the chemotherapy-naı
¨ve
and post-docetaxel groups. Chemotherapy-naı
¨ve patients with AR
gain were 4.7 times less likely to have a �50% decline in PSA (95%
CI
1.17–19.17;
P ¼ 0.035)
(Figure
1E).
Plasma
AR
gain
chemotherapy-treated patients were 5.0 times less likely to have
a �50% decline in PSA (95% CI 1.70–14.91; P ¼ 0.003) (Figure
1F). For the eight AR mutant patients, a trend for a lower rate
of �50% PSA decline was seen (odds ratio (OR), 6.3; 95% CI 0.72–
54.59; P ¼ 0.12) (Figure 1F).
Plasma AR independently associates with worse
outcome on multivariable analysis in the primary
cohort
Plasma AR status and 11 baseline characteristics previously shown
to be clinically relevant [25, 26] were evaluated by both univariate
and multivariable analyses on the whole primary cohort. Plasma
AR gain or mutant was most significantly associated with OS or
PFS (supplementary Tables S3 and S4 available at Annals of
Oncology online). We then carried out multivariable analysis with
stepwise backwards elimination and the sole variables that
remained significant were plasma AR status (HR 4.10; 95% CI
2.66–6.35; P < 0.001, and HR 4.02; 95% CI 1.87–8.66; P < 0.001,
for AR CN and AR mutant, respectively, Table 2A) and total plasma
DNA concentration for OS and plasma AR status (HR 2.06; 95% CI
1.36–3.12; P ¼ 0.001, and HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.03–4.69; P ¼ 0.041,
for AR CN and AR mutant, respectively), total plasma DNA con-
centration and ALP levels for PFS (Table 2B).
Plasma AR status in the PREMIERE cohort
The PREMIERE trial enrolled 98 patients in 16 sites between
February 2015 and November 2015. Plasma was collected at study
entry before starting enzalutamide from 94 patients who had a

 median follow-up of 10.6 months. Patient characteristics by
plasma AR status are described in Table 3A.
Plasma AR associates with worse outcome in the
PREMIERE cohort
Similar to our primary cohort pre-chemotherapy population, we
observed AR gain in 11 (12%) patients. CTCs were detected in 35
patients (37%). AR gain was detected in seven (20%) CTC-
positive and four (7%) CTC-negative patients (Table 3A).
Plasma AR gain was significantly associated with shorter sPFS
(median 3.60 versus 15.5 months; HR 4.33; 95% CI 1.94–9.68;
P < 0.001) (Figure 2A), rPFS (median 3.90 months versus not
reached; HR 8.06; 95% CI 3.26–19.93; P < 0.001) (Figure 2B) and
OS (medians not reached; HR 11.08; 95% CI 2.16–56.95;
P ¼ 0.004) (Figure 2C) (supplementary Table S5, available at
Annals of Oncology online). Patients with AR gain were less likely
to have a �50% decline in PSA (OR 4.93; 95% CI 1.30–18.75;
P ¼ 0.025) (Figure 2D).
Plasma AR independently associates with worse
outcome on multivariable analysis in the PREMIERE
cohort
On multivariable analysis, the association of AR gain with the pri-
mary endpoint of sPFS was independent of plasma DNA concen-
tration and the detection of CTCs (HR 4.32; 95% CI 1.90–9.85;
P < 0.001) (Table 3B). AR gain was also independently associated
on multivariable analysis with rPFS (HR 5.63; 95% CI 2.15–
14.74; P < 0.001) (Table 3B).
Discussion
Several treatments are available for metastatic CRPC but to date,
no approved biomarker to personalize therapy. Our analyses of
plasma from 265 patients collected in three prospective bio-
marker protocols show that the detection of AR CN gain before
starting enzalutamide or abiraterone is associated with decreased
OS and PFS regardless of prior chemotherapy status. We
excluded samples from patients that had prior treatment with
enzalutamide or abiraterone, given response rates and duration
of benefit are very different when used sequentially [27]. Our pre-
vious study [8] suggests a similar association between plasma AR
and resistance in patients previously treated with enzalutamide
or abiraterone and this requires further investigation in future
studies.

 We did not detect AR mutations (p.T878A or p.L702H) in che-
motherapy-naı
¨ve patients. Our assay detects point mutations
present in at least 2% of plasma DNA. Greater sensitivity is
obtained with higher input DNA [28] although the clinical rele-
vance of rarer mutations is uncertain. By using a multiplex
ddPCR with four carefully selected reference genes, we have
designed a robust assay that does not over-call gain due to loss in
regions involving the reference gene. Our model for estimating
the likelihood of the AR CN cut-off that best predicts associations
with outcome was built with 171 patients. We plan to perform a
meta-analysis of multiple trials when the data on AR CN acquired
from different institutions and trials exceeds 1000 patients.
Detection of AR splice variants in CTCs is also associated with
shorter PFS and OS with enzalutamide or abiraterone [19, 29]. AR
CN is higher in the population with detectable CTCs although AR
gain can also be observed in CTC-negative patients, accounting for
one third of AR gained in the PREMIERE cohort. The overlap
between AR-V7 positive and plasma AR gained patients and a
comparison of the two tests in prospective trials is warranted to
develop the best biomarker strategy for identifying resistant
patients. Testing plasma AR status by ddPCR is affordable and can
be widely implemented in clinical laboratories but does not control
for plasma DNA tumor content [7, 8] that may introduce a bias.
Nonetheless, multivariable analyses confirm that plasma AR by
ddPCR provides information on the outcome of men starting
enzalutamide or abiraterone that is independent of other factors
previously reported to be prognostic [25, 26, 30]. In keeping with
higher response rates to AR targeting in chemotherapy-naı
¨ve
patients, the prevalence of plasma AR aberrations is 10%–15% in
this setting compared with 30%–40% post-docetaxel. As our study
is single arm, the associations we report are prognostic although
the association with PSA decline rate suggests plasma AR CN could
identify patients resistant to enzalutamide or abiraterone. The
aims of our study were defined after sample collection and

 therefore larger studies with a pre-specified primary objective of
defining the association with outcome by plasma AR status could
provide further supportive evidence for the role of AR CN as a bio-
marker in CRPC. For level one evidence to change clinical practice,
our findings require confirmation in prospective trials where
plasma AR CN defines treatment selection.
