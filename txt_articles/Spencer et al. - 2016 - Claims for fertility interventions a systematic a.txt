ABSTRACT
Objectives: Fertility services in the UK are offered by
over 200 Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA)-registered NHS and private clinics.
While in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) form part of the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guidance, many further interventions are offered. We
aimed to record claims of benefit for interventions
offered by fertility centres via information on the
centres’ websites and record what evidence was cited
for these claims.
Methods: We obtained from HFEA a list of all UK
centres providing fertility treatments and examined
their websites. We listed fertility interventions offered in
addition to standard IVF and ICSI and recorded
statements about interventions that claimed or implied
improvements in fertility in healthy women. We
recorded which claims were quantified, and the
evidence cited in support of the claims. Two reviewers
extracted data from websites. We accessed websites
from 21 December 2015 to 31 March 2016.
Results: We found 233 websites for HFEA-registered
fertility treatment centres, of which 152 (65%) were
excluded as duplicates or satellite centres, 2 were
andrology clinics and 5 were unavailable or under
construction websites. In total, 74 fertility centre
websites, incorporating 1401 web pages, were
examined for claims. We found 276 claims of benefit
relating to 41 different fertility interventions made by
60 of the 74 centres (median 3 per website; range
0 to 10). Quantification was given for 79 (29%) of the
claims. 16 published references were cited 21 times on
13 of the 74 websites.
Conclusions: Many fertility centres in the UK offer a
range of treatments in addition to standard IVF
procedures, and for many of these interventions claims
of benefit are made. In most cases, the claims are not
quantified and evidence is not cited to support the
claims. There is a need for more information on
interventions to be made available by fertility centres,
to support well-informed treatment decisions.
BACKGROUND
Approximately one in seven UK couples have
problems conceiving,1 and increasing age is
one
factor
that
contributes
to
this.
Approximately 98% of women, aged between
19 and 26 years, and having regular inter-
course will conceive naturally within 2 years.
However,
this
figure
drops
to
90%
for
women
aged
between
35
and
39 years.2
Other factors that can affect fertility include
ovulatory, tubal, uterine or peritoneal disor-
ders as well as male-related factors. However,
in ∼25% of couples, there is no identified
cause of the infertility.1
Current UK National Institute for Health
and
Care
Excellence
(NICE)
guidelines
advocate that women with unexplained infer-
tility, who have not conceived after 2 years of
regular sexual intercourse, be offered NHS
treatment. This may be through medical, sur-
gical or assisted conception techniques. For
women under 40 years of age, the latter
includes three full cycles of in vitro fertilisa-
tion (IVF), with or without intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI).3
In general, fertility treatments include an
array of interventions that seek to aid con-
ception, or treat infertility, or subfertility,
with the specific aim of increasing the live
birth rate or the pregnancy rate (sometimes
called ‘clinical pregnancy rate’) as well as
conception or survival of cultured embryos
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ We
accessed
all
Human
Fertilisation
and
Embryology Authority-registered fertility centre
websites available in the UK that provide in vitro
fertilisation and treatment information.
▪ Two reviewers accessed the websites, assessed
all of the extracted claims and resolved issues by
discussion.
▪ Different reviewers may disagree in categorising
some statements as claims, but it is unlikely that
the
pattern
of
findings
would
change
substantially.
▪ Web pages are subject to change over time, and
a different set of reviewers might locate further
intervention claims that we missed.

 or blastocysts. Treatments often involve ovulation stimu-
lation and monitoring, IVF itself (sometimes via ICSI)
and replacement of resulting embryos or blastocysts into
the uterus.
In addition to these standard treatments, a range of
additional investigations and treatments may be offered
at UK fertility treatment centres. All centres, whether
they provide private, NHS or both types of services, are
registered with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA), the independent regulator that over-
sees
fertility
treatment
and
research
in
the
UK.4
However, despite this regulation it has been suggested
that
some
of
these
interventions—offered
beyond
routine IVF—may not best serve patients, as they are not
based on evidence of effectiveness, are costly and some
clinics might be using IVF techniques that have not
been stringently tested.5 Furthermore, the HFEA recom-
mends that some treatments, such
as reproductive
immunology, are only used in the context of clinical
trials.6
Given the concerns over the evidence base underpin-
ning fertility treatments as well as the implications for
couples undergoing these treatments, and the resources
needed to fund them, we set out to systematically iden-
tify and document claims made by UK fertility centres
on the effectiveness of treatments offered on their web-
sites as the first information source for individuals. We
went on to identify the evidence that the centres use to
support their claims. Finally, using this information, we
have conducted a follow-up study examining the cred-
ibility of the claim statements when compared with the
published evidence of effectiveness.7
METHODS
Identification of fertility claims
We obtained a list of all UK centres providing fertility
treatments from the HFEA website.4 No centres were
excluded. Where it was clear that a primary fertility
centre had satellite centres offering treatments, we
restricted our searching for claims to their main website.
We examined the websites for each of these centres and
for each intervention additional to IVF that was offered.
We extracted statements that suggested or claimed
improvements in fertility in healthy women. These
included statements relating to increased conception
rate, increased rate of ‘clinical pregnancy’ or relating to
increased live birth rate.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for claims
We defined a claim as a statement that implicitly or
explicitly
asserted
that
an
intervention
provides
enhanced effectiveness in relation to either increased
conception rate, implantation rate, pregnancy rate or
live birth rate. A list was made of all claims identified on
the first website. In the websites accessed subsequently,
these claims were all searched for, and additional claims
identified were added to the list. In this way, the list of
claims increased as the search continued through the
list of fertility centres.
We excluded claims of effectiveness for:
▸ IVF itself and its associated standard treatments.
▸ Freezing of sperm or eggs.
▸ Donation of sperm or eggs.
▸ Nutrition, acupuncture or hypnotherapy.
▸ Interventions in women with pre-existing disease such
as diabetes or diagnosed conditions such as polycystic
ovarian syndrome, or neurological conditions such as
spinal cord injury.
▸ Genetic testing of inherited disorders.
▸ Interventions
for
women
experiencing
recurrent
miscarriage.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (EAS and CH) independently listed inter-
ventions offered and extracted claims for the interven-
tions. We accessed websites from 21 December 2015 to
31 March 2016 and accessed each website on one date
only. When a website cited external evidence and pro-
vided a link to this, we recorded this link. We extracted a
copy of the claims, and a list of the web pages viewed
into a single Google data sheet. We recorded methodo-
logical issues and important contextual information
relating to claims into the data sheet and analysed some
of the emerging themes.
We counted the number of web pages accessed, the
total number of claims per site, the presence or absence
of quantification of the benefits for a given claim and
the number of external references cited to justify claims.
Clarification of the presence of a claim was achieved
through discussion between the reviewers (EAS and
CH). For each intervention, we then collated all of the
claims and counted the number of fertility centres
making a claim of benefit. We counted the number of
websites giving a quantification of effect for a claim they
made, how many websites cited an external reference
for their claim and how many references were cited.
Using the citations given on the websites, we attempted
to identify and locate the published references cited by
the fertility centres.
RESULTS
We identified 233 websites for HFEA-registered fertility
treatment centres (websites searched December 2016), of
which 152 (65%) were duplicates or satellite centres
(information on these sites referred directly to one of the
cohort of included websites). Of the 81 sites we reviewed,
4 (4.9%) were unavailable; 2 (2.5%) were andrology
clinics and 1 website (1.2%) was under construction.
Therefore, we included a total cohort of 74 (30%) separ-
ate websites of centres providing IVF services in the UK
(see figure 1 and Supplementary table S1).
Across these 74 sites, we searched 1401 web pages
(median 16 per website; range 1–60) that related to
treatment interventions meeting our inclusion criteria.

 We found 276 claims of benefit relating to fertility inter-
ventions made by 60 of the 74 centres (median 3 per
website; range 0–10).
Examples
of
claim
statements
are
shown
in
Supplementary table S2. Some of the claims were moder-
ately direct, stating that the intervention increased the
likelihood, optimised or increased the chance of concep-
tion or pregnancy. For example: “A pre-treatment scan
gives the clinician the information they need to decide
on the most appropriate treatment pathway for you. This
allows the team to optimise your chances of achieving a
pregnancy.” “Special tests may identify couples who are at
risk of these problems. Treatment which stimulates the
proper immune response (immunomodulation) in the
mother may then improve the chances of a successful
pregnancy.” Rarely, a claim stated that there was a benefit
relating to live birth, for example: “Intralipid infusion
therapy can help to stabilise your immune system and
increase your chances of having a baby…. It is safe, non-
invasive and may help to increase your chance of
success.” Many of the claims were more indirect, suggest-
ing a generalised benefit or improvement, for example:
“Hyaluranon may also help to isolate mature sperm for
use in ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) cycles
helping to increase fertilisation rates.”
The interventions additional to standard IVF offered
on the websites are shown in Supplementary table S3.
Quantification was given for 79 (29%) of the 276 claims.
As an example, “chance of an embryo transferred to the
womb making a baby was found to be increased by more
than 50%.” In conjunction with the 276 claims, a total of
16 unique references were cited 21 times on 13 of the
74 websites. Supplementary table S4 shows the citations
found on the websites and the corresponding references
identified, by intervention offered, and shows the cat-
egory for the highest level of evidence cited. References
supported six interventions: IMSI (four unique publica-
tions); endometrial scratching (six unique publications
cited in seven instances by four websites); Embryoglue
(three unique references cited in eight instances by six
websites); assisted hatching (one reference cited once
on
one website);
vitrification
of
human
eggs
and
embryos/EVES technique (one reference cited once on
one website) and Embryoscope (one reference cited
once on one website).
Of
the
16
cited
references,
four
were
systematic
reviews.8 9 10 11 One was a meta-analysis,12 and two were
randomised trials.13 14 Four were reports of prospective
observational studies,15–18 and one was a report of a non-
randomised parallel group intervention study.20 Two were
reports
of
retrospective
cohort
studies,20
21
and
two were conference abstracts, of which we were only able to
locate one.22 Of the 74 websites, 61 (82%) provided no
references. On the 13 websites that did, the number of refer-
ences cited ranged from one (five sites) to nine references
(one site: http://cheshirewomenshealth-fertility.co.uk/).
The 276 claims made related to 41 different interven-
tions (figure 2): 8 of these were tests (shown in the table
on a blue background), 6 were interventions considered
part of NICE recommendations (shown on a yellow
background), 1 was miscellaneous (natural cycle IVF,
shown on a purple background) and 26 interventions or
techniques were classified as additional to standard IVF
treatments. Figure 2 shows that the five most commonly
made claims were for blastocyst culture, ICSI, endomet-
rial scratching, Embryoglue and IUI, accounting for 110
(39%) of the overall claims.
The eight tests for which claims were made included
an ovarian reserve test/AMH and antral follicle count,
thyroid antibodies, hysterosalpingogram, semen analysis
and chromosome tests. For all these tests except immun-
ology testing, NICE gives guidance,2 which was not
referred to by any of the websites.
Six interventions for which claims were made are also
referred to in current NICE recommendations23 and not
referred to by the website in relation to claims: intrauter-
ine insemination (IUI) (NICE recommendation 1.2.1.2);
intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI) (NICE recommenda-
tion 1.11.1.2), cycle monitoring, ovulation induction and
cycle monitoring (NICE recommendation 1.5.5.3, 1.5.4.2,
1.12.3.4 and 1.12.4) and egg freezing and sperm freez-
ing (NICE recommendation 1.16.1 Cryopreservation of
semen, oocytes and embryos). NICE guidance on cryo-
preservation relates to patients preparing to undergo
chemotherapy or radiotherapy when it is likely to affect
their fertility (NICE recommendation 1.16.1.1) and is
therefore in most cases not relevant to cryopreservation
in patients without cancer seeking help with fertility.

 DISCUSSION
Summary of findings
Our findings demonstrate that while many claims were
made on the benefits of fertility treatments, there was a
lack of supporting evidence cited, with the majority of
the websites providing no sources for claims made. From
74
websites
and
reviewing
1401
web
pages
from
UK-based centres providing IVF treatments, we found a
substantial number of claims of effectiveness for inter-
ventions additional to standard IVF treatment. Despite
276 claims made across these 74 websites, we identified
only 13 websites where any references were included,
which referred to just 16 unique published references.
Of these 16 references cited, only 5 were high-level sys-
tematic review evidence; the remaining 12 were either
small prospective or retrospective studies, including two
conference abstract reports which include only limited
information.
Strengths and weaknesses
We attempted to execute replicable methods, but there
are some limitations worth noting. While our list of web-
sites was provided by the UK regulator, web pages do
change, and a different set of reviewers might locate
further intervention claims that we missed, not least
because on some sites it is not straightforward to locate
all treatments offered. Different reviewers may disagree
in categorising some statements as claims, and it is pos-
sible that a repeat of our analysis would record a differ-
ent number of claims, but it is unlikely that the pattern
of findings would change substantially. In this study, we
examined only the evidence cited by these websites, and
we did not examine all available evidence on the safety
and effectiveness of the interventions for which claims
were made. We have therefore followed this work with
further research to examine the published evidence
relating to fertility interventions identified in this study
as being currently offered by regulated clinics and to
investigate
whether
the
claims
of
benefit
can
be
substantiated.
We did not use the Health on the Net Foundation
HONcode
(http://www.healthonnet.org/HONcode/
Conduct.html) to assess websites, as it was outside the
scope of this investigation, which may be a limitation of
our study. The Health on the Net Foundation promotes
the
provision
of
high-quality
health
information.
Adherence to the HONcode requires websites to include
statements on attribution (HON Code principle 4):
“Cite the source(s) of published information, date
medical and health pages.” In addition, websites should
also adhere to the principle of justifiability: “any claims
relating to the benefits/performance of a specific treat-
ment, commercial product or service will be supported
by appropriate, balanced evidence in the manner out-
lined in Principle 4.” Our current results suggest that
none of the websites we reviewed would meet the
HONcode requirements.
Context of previous findings
Previous studies have shown that couples undergoing
reproductive treatment are not well informed, particu-
larly when it comes to the risks of treatment.24 A Dutch
questionnaire survey of 1499 couples concluded that
information provision for infertile couples is currently
poor and in need of improvement: on average only half
were aware of national fertility guideline-based recom-
mendations,25 and strategies to improve uptake of guide-
lines had so far proved to be ineffective.26 Surveys have

 also shown that the success rates of reproductive treat-
ments are often overestimated and that IVF couples
often want to decide independently whether or not the
particular risks and burden of interventions are accept-
able.26 27 Qualitative studies have also shown that many
women start IVF treatment with unrealistic expectations
of the effectiveness of treatments.28
A survey of women undergoing fertility treatments in
university hospitals and private fertility clinics in Canada
reported that most women “wanted to share knowledge
equally with their doctors about possible fertility treat-
ments.” About half the woman wanted to make decisions
mostly by themselves,29 which emphasises the import-
ance of high-quality online information and access to
relevant evidence. Previous work has found there is
insufficient information on the web for couples to
adequately inform themselves about available treatment
options; but also that the overwhelming majority of
infertile couples use the internet to look for information
relevant to their situation; and those who do want a
better understanding of fertility problems.30 This survey
of 163 couples with fertility problems in the Netherlands
reported that many couples felt the internet improved
their knowledge about fertility treatments and facilitated
decision-making.31 However, similar to our findings, an
analysis
of
the
Society
for
Assisted
Reproductive
Technology websites in the USA reported that the major-
ity did not meet the American Medical Association
(AMA)
internet
health
information
guidelines.31
Furthermore, that analysis of 263 sites found that the
“quality of the hospital centers’ websites was better than
that of private clinics”.
Implications
Current NICE guidance on fertility treatments, under
‘Principles of Care: Providing Information’, states that:
“people should have the opportunity to make informed
decisions regarding their care and treatment via access
to evidence-based information.”23 The best current evi-
dence shows that the information provided to potential
patients on fertility centre websites is likely to be a
primary information source for most individuals seeking
medical help with fertility. This information should
therefore ideally be of high quality, provide evidence for
claims and state its limitations. This is currently not the
case. Although in the UK it is mandatory for fertility
clinics to publish their success rates, there is no require-
ment to cite national guidance or relevant evidence.
There may be a need for regulatory oversight of the evi-
dence on fertility interventions provided to couples by
clinics through the web to ensure accuracy and rele-
vance of the information. Ideally, regulatory bodies
should require that information provided on these web-
sites is accurate, reflects the highest level of available evi-
dence and links to national guidance where appropriate.
The situation in countries without such regulatory
authorities as the HFEA may be worse, and it may be
worthwhile replicating this research in other settings.
CONCLUSIONS
Many fertility centres in the UK offer a range of treat-
ments in addition to standard IVF procedures, and for
many of these interventions claims are made, implying
or stating a benefit. In most cases, these claims are made
without referring to any evidence to support them.
Fertility treatment centres should provide information
based on the best available evidence, citing sources
including
NICE
guidance
where
appropriate,
and
should state the limitations of what is known about inter-
ventions offered. The fertility regulator takes an active
role on ensuring data for success rates are correct and
correctly reported; they could, and in our view should,
do the same for evidence given by clinics to patients
about the benefits and risks of interventions.
