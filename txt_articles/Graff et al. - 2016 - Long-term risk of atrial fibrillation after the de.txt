ABSTRACT
Objectives: Severe psychological stress is generally
associated with an increased risk of acute
cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction,
but it remains unknown whether it also applies to atrial
fibrillation. We conducted a population-based case–
control study using nationwide Danish health registers
to examine the risk of atrial fibrillation after the death
of a partner.
Methods: From 1995 through 2014, we identified
88 612 cases with a hospital diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation and 886 120 age-matched and sex-matched
controls based on risk-set sampling. The conditional
logistic regression model was used to calculate
adjusted ORs of atrial fibrillation with 95% CIs.
Results: Partner bereavement was experienced by
17 478 cases and 168 940 controls and was
associated with a transiently higher risk of atrial
fibrillation; the risk was highest 8–14 days after the
loss (1.90; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.69), after which it
gradually declined. One year after the loss, the risk was
almost the same as in the non-bereaved population.
Overall, the OR of atrial fibrillation within 30 days after
bereavement was 1.41 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.70), but it
tended to be higher in persons below the age of
60 years (2.34; 95% CI 1.02 to 5.40) and in persons
whose partner had a low predicted mortality 1 month
before the death, that is, ≤5 points on the age-adjusted
Charlson Comorbidity Index (1.57; 95% CI 1.13 to
2.17).
Conclusions: The severely stressful life event of
losing a partner was followed by a transiently increased
risk of atrial fibrillation lasting for 1 year, especially for
the least predicted losses.
INTRODUCTION
Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most
common cardiac arrhythmia in the western
world. The estimated life-time risk varies
between 22% and 26%, and AF is one of the
few heart diseases with increasing incidence.1
AF is associated with increased risk of death,2
stroke3 and heart failure,4 but also with a
lower health-related quality of life.5 The treat-
ment
and
the
potentially
related
complications
pose
a
major
economic
burden on the healthcare system.6
Mounting evidence indicates that severely
stressful life events increase the risk of acute
cardiovascular events like myocardial infarc-
tion,7 but no large studies have examined
whether the association also applies to AF or
atrial flutter. A few studies suggest that emo-
tional stress may be a triggering factor for
arrhythmia in persons with paroxysmal AF,8
and case reports indicate that this may also
concern patients with no former history of
AF.9 Furthermore, studies suggest that high-
impact stress may cause pathophysiological
changes that make the heart more vulner-
able to arrhythmias by reduced parasympa-
thetic
modulation,10
which
may
cause
excessive sympathetic activity11 and stimulate
proinflammatory cytokines.12
The loss of a partner is considered one of
the most severely stressful life events13 and is
likely to affect most people, independently of
KEY QUESTIONS
What is already known about this subject?
▸ Previous studies have found that severely stress-
ful life events increase the risk of cardiovascular
events and case reports indicate emotional
stress may be a triggering factor for arrhyth-
mias. It remains unknown whether it also
applies to risk of new onset of atrial fibrillation.
What does this study add?
▸ This study found that the severely stressful life
event of losing a partner was followed by an
increased risk of atrial fibrillation lasting for
1 year. The risk was highest shortly after the
loss and for the least predicted losses.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸ These findings indicate that high levels of stress
may increase the risk of developing new onset
of atrial fibrillation. With a biologically plausible
association early identification of this group
should be encouraged and calls for further
studies.

 coping mechanisms. Bereavement often causes mental
illness symptoms such as depression, anxiety, guilt, anger
and hopelessness.14
In a large population-based case–control study, we
examined the association between partner bereavement
and the risk of new onset of AF while taking into
account the time since bereavement, comorbidity and
medication use.
METHODS
Study design
We conducted a population-based case–control study
from 1995 through 2014, using prospectively collected
information from four nationwide Danish registries on
the Danish population of 5.6 million inhabitants. The
Danish national healthcare system provides free access
(tax-funded) to healthcare and partial reimbursement
for prescribed medications. The unique Danish civil
registration number (CRN), which is assigned to all
Danish residents at birth or immigration, allowed us to
link data at the personal level across all registries. The
CRN has been used in the Danish Civil Registration
System15 since 1968 and contains information on resi-
dence,
cohabitant
status,
educational
level,
marital
status, spouse, migration, vital status and date of death.
The Danish National Patient Register16 was established
in 1977 and holds information on discharge diagnoses
from all Danish hospitals, and data from emergency
rooms and outpatient clinics has also been recorded
since 1995. Diagnoses are coded in accordance with the
International Classification of Diseases; the eight revi-
sion (ICD-8) was used from 1971 to 1993, while the 10th
revision (ICD-10) has been used since 1993.
Cases with AF
Persons with a first-time inpatient diagnosis of AF (from
1995 through 2014) were identified using information
from the Danish National
Patient Register (ICD-8:
427.93, 427.94 and ICD-10: I48; atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter). Information on the combined diagnosis
of AF and atrial flutter has proven to have a high validity
(positive predictive value: 92.6%; 95% CI 88.8% to
95.2%) in the Danish National Patient Register17 and
has previously been used in epidemiological studies.18
We considered the date of the first admission diagnosis
of AF between 1995 through 2014 to be the index date
for included cases. The Danish National Patient Register
was used to exclude people diagnosed with a heart-valve
disease before the index date (ICD-8: 394–396 and
ICD-10: I05, I06, I08, I34 and I35).
Control group
For each case, we randomly selected 10 controls (1:10)
matched on age (±2 months) and sex. These controls
were assigned an index date identical to that of the AF
diagnosis for the corresponding cases. All controls were
selected through risk-set sampling from the population
of all persons alive and living in Denmark with no per-
sonal history of AF at the index date according to the
Danish Civil Registration System.
Partner bereavement
We used the Danish Civil Registration System to identify
cohabitant partner status, marital status, identification of
corresponding spouse or partner, and all spousal/partner
deaths for cases and controls prior to the index date. We
used the Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index19
(ACCI) to classify the likelihood of death for all partners
1 month before his or her death, with allocated points for
selected chronic diseases obtained from the Danish
National Patient Register (1 point: myocardial infarct, con-
gestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dementia,
cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, connective
tissue disease, ulcer, chronic liver disease and/or diabetes;
2 points: hemiplegia, moderate or severe kidney disease,
diabetes with end organ damage, tumour, leukaemia and/
or lymphoma; 3 points: moderate or severe liver disease; 6
points: malignant tumour, metastasis and/or AIDS) and
for age (1 point: 50–59 years; 2 points: 60–69 years; 3
points: 70–79 years; 4 points: 80–89 years; 5 points: 90–
99 years).
Covariates
Information
on
potential
confounding
factors
was
obtained from the Danish National Patient Register, the
Danish National Diabetes Register,20 and the Danish
National Prescription Register.21 Since 1990, the Danish
National Diabetes Register has provided information on
diabetes mellitus according to an algorithm developed
on the basis of data from four nationwide Danish regis-
ters. Since 1995, complete computerised prescription
records have been available in the Danish National
Prescription Register; the database provides dispensing
dates for all reimbursed drugs classified according to the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification
System.
From the Danish National Patient Register and the
Danish National Diabetes Register, we obtained previous
hospitalisation diagnoses on hypertension, ischaemic
heart disease (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction
and chronic ischaemic heart disease), cardiomyopathy,
congestive heart failure, hyperthyroidism and diabetes
mellitus, which may increase the risk of AF (see table 1).
From the Danish National Prescription Register, we
obtained information on used cardiovascular drugs clas-
sified according to ATC codes: vitamin K antagonists
(MB01AA), ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antago-
nists (MC09), β-blocking agents (MC07), lipid-modifying
agents (MC10), calcium antagonists (MC08D), diuretics
(MC03), nitrates (MC01DA), digoxin (MC01) and anti-
platelet agents (MB01AC). Only prescriptions redeemed
within 3 months before the index date were included.
Maximum educational level was classified according to

Statistical analysis
We calculated ORs and 95% CIs of AF using conditional
logistic regression comparing the risk among bereaved
against the cohabitant group. As we used risk-set sam-
pling of controls, the ORs present unbiased estimates of
the corresponding incidence rate ratios.23 In multiple
conditional logistic regression models, we controlled for
the covariates listed in table 1.
First, we calculated the ORs for AF according to the
time since bereavement, and these were grouped accord-
ing to time period: 0–7 days, 8–14 days, 15–30 days, 31–
90 days,
91–365 days,
366–1095 days
and
>1095 days
before the index date.
Second, we calculated the ORs of developing AF
within 30 days after bereavement in subgroups of the
population categorised according to sex, age, calendar
time, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.
Third, we evaluated whether the effect of bereavement
on AF depended on the health status of the partner
1 month before death. This was measured by the ACCI
scores divided into three categories: lowest risk of death
(0–5 points), intermediate risk (6–8 points) and highest
risk (9–16 points). The division was made prior to the
analysis to establish as much power in each category as
possible.
Fourth, we examined the effect of being single on AF
risk compared with cohabitating partners.
Finally, we performed a subanalysis after excluding
cases and the corresponding controls who redeemed a
prescription
of
an
antithrombotic
agent
(ATC:
MB01AA) before the index date.
Analyses were performed using STATA, V.13; StatCorp
LP
, College Station, Texas, USA.
RESULTS
More cases than controls had a diagnosis of cardiovascu-
lar disease, diabetes and/or hyperthyroidism and also
received
more
medications
for
these
conditions
(table 1).
During the whole study period, partner bereavement
was experienced by 17 478 (19.72%) cases and 168 940
(19.07%) controls; 144 cases and 1036 controls were
bereaved
within
the
past
30 days
prior
to
AF.
Bereavement was followed by a transiently higher risk of
AF (figure 1). The OR was highest 8–14 days after the
loss (1.90; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.69), after which it gradually
declined. One year after the loss, it corresponded to a
level close to that of the non-bereaved population (1.04;
95% CI 0.99 to 1.09).
Overall, the OR of developing AF within 30 days after
bereavement was 41% higher (1.41; 95% CI 1.17 to
1.70) in the bereaved population compared with the
non-bereaved population (figure 2). This risk was rela-
tively constant over subgroups characterised by sex, cal-
endar
time,
pre-existing
cardiovascular
disease
and
diabetes. The highest OR was found among persons
below the age of 60 years (2.34; 95% CI 1.02 to 5.40).
The OR tended to increase with decreasing ACCI scores
in the partner 1 month prior to the death; a high OR
was found for those who lost a partner with low ACCI
scores (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.17), whereas no risk
increase was found for those who lost a partner with
high ACCI scores (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.53).
We found no difference in AF risk when we compared
singles with cohabitating partners (OR 1.00; 95% CI

DISCUSSION
In this large population-based study, the severely stressful
life event of losing a partner was associated with a transi-
ently increased risk of AF, which lasted for about 1 year.
The elevated risk was especially high for those who were
young and those who lost a relatively healthy partner.
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to
examine the risk of AF after stressful life events, but an
association has been suggested by case reports.9 A few
studies have examined the relationship between psycho-
logical distress and AF, but the association remains
unclear. The Women’s Health Study from the US24 fol-
lowed 30 746 women for a median of 125 months and
identified 771 patients with AF. The study used the
Mental Health Inventory-5 to measure global psycho-
logical distress, but no association with AF was revealed.
As the American study included only few severely dis-
tressed study participants and did not take timing into
account, an acute effect of severe stress may have been
overlooked.
In
our
study,
the
association
between
bereavement and AF was weak 1 year after the bereave-
ment if at all present. A cohort study from Australia25
followed 226 patients for a median of 6 days after
cardiac surgery and identified 56 patients who devel-
oped AF. They used the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales
to measure self-reported postoperative stress, depression,
and anxiety symptoms. Their findings showed that only
anxiety was associated with higher risk of AF. The
Australian study was, however, limited by small sample
size. In addition, the results may not apply to the
general population as the study was based on a highly
selected group of individuals who had just undergone
cardiac surgery.
Our study indicated that one of the most severe types
of stress is associated with an increased risk of AF. We
used the ACCI scores of the deceased partner 1 month
before the death as a proxy for the expectedness of the
death because we presume that the stress associated with
bereavement is more severe if the loss is unexpected.26
We found that the highest risk was associated with the
least predicted losses, while no association was found for
more expected losses (ie, the partners with the highest
ACCI scores). A long-lasting disease with great suffering
and considerable care may be stressful and place high
demands on the partner, and death may sometimes even
be a relief. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and male

 sex are well-known risk factors for AF.1 However, in our
study, the OR of AF after bereavement did not differ
much in the investigated subgroups during the 30-day
period.
Bereavement is a major life event, which is known to
increase the risk of cardiovascular disease,7 mental
illness27 and death.28 The underlying causal mechanisms
for the association between the loss of a partner and AF
is unclear, but acute stress may possess direct arrhythmo-
genic properties by alternating autonomic control, influ-
encing
heart
rate
variability
and
enhancing
proinflammatory cytokines.10–12 Animal studies have sub-
stantiated the importance of the neural component sur-
rounding AF when manipulation of the autonomic
pathways either promotes or eliminates AF.29 In addition,
patients with paroxysmal AF often claim that emotional
stress is a common triggering factor8 and increasing
levels of perceived stress are associated with prevalent
AF.30
The
main
strengths
of
our
study
include
the
population-based design and the large sample size,
which allowed us to consider timing and study the asso-
ciation in high-risk populations. The case–control study
was nested in a nationwide cohort and included all
persons treated for inpatient incident AF in any Danish
hospital during the study period. Denmark provides free
access (tax-funded) to healthcare services for all resi-
dents, and the registration of AF is known to be valid
(positive predictive value 92.6%).17 Controls were ran-
domly selected from the underlying cohort using risk-set
sampling. Thus, bias due to selection of study partici-
pants is an unlikely explanation for our findings. Since a
precise day of onset is important in timing analysis, we
only included persons with new onset of AF who were
treated in hospitals as inpatients. We expect that the vast
majority
of
these
cases
had
an
acute
onset.
Unfortunately, we do not have information on the diag-
noses made in primary care in Denmark. However, the
results were virtually unchanged when we excluded cases
and corresponding controls who had redeemed a pre-
scription of an antithrombotic agent before the index
date. Information on the death of a partner was col-
lected prospectively and did not rely on the memory of
the study participants. Registration of death in the
Danish Civil Registration System has a high validity and
a completeness close to 100%, which implies that our
assessment of death is accurate.15 In our study, the parti-
cipants had to be married or cohabiting in order to be
categorised as exposed to bereavement. This procedure
is, however, unlikely to have introduced any bias as the
results did not change much if we used only non-
bereaved cohabitants as controls.
We adjusted for several confounding factors, such as
medication and comorbid conditions, and found only
little change in the estimates. However, residual con-
founding cannot be ruled out because we had no infor-
mation on potential confounding factors such as lifestyle
factors, physical activities and family history of AF. We
believe that the risk of residual confounding is likely to
be small as we cannot think of any possible confounder
that could cause a transiently increased risk of AF
shortly after bereavement. Adverse lifestyle factors (such
as
increased
alcohol
consumption,
decreased
sleep
quality, poor diet and less physical activity)31 caused by
the bereavement may be steps on the causal pathway
from bereavement to AF1 and, therefore, should not be
adjusted for.23
In conclusion, we found a transiently increased risk of
AF after partner bereavement, especially if the loss was
unpredicted according to the Charlson comorbidity
index. Our results call for further studies aiming at
evaluating whether the association also applies to more
common, but less severe, stressors and at identifying
causal mechanisms and treatment possibilities.
