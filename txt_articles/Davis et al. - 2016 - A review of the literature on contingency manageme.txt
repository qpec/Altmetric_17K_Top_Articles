Abstract
This report describes a systematic literature review of voucher and related monetary-based 
contingency management (CM) interventions for substance use disorders (SUDs) over 5.2 years 
(November 2009 through December 2014). Reports were identified using the search engine 
PubMed, expert consultations, and published bibliographies. For inclusion, reports had to (a) 
involve monetary-based CM; (b) appear in a peer-reviewed journal; (c) include an experimental 
comparison condition; (d) describe an original study; (e) assess efficacy using inferential statistics; 
(f) use a research design allowing treatment effects to be attributed to CM. Sixty-nine reports met 
inclusion criteria and were categorized into 7 research trends: (1) extending CM to special 
populations, (2) parametric studies, (3) extending CM to community clinics, (4) combining CM 
with pharmacotherapies, (5) incorporating technology into CM, (6) investigating longer-term 
outcomes, (7) using CM as a research tool. The vast majority (59/69, 86%) of studies reported 
significant (p < 0.05) during-treatment effects. Twenty-eight (28/59, 47%) of those studies 
included at least one follow-up visit after CM was discontinued, with eight (8/28, 29%) reporting 
significant (p < 0.05) effects. Average effect size (Cohen’s d) during treatment was 0.62 (95% CI: 
0.54, 0.70) and post-treatment it was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.41). Overall, the literature on voucher-
based CM over the past 5 years documents sustained growth, high treatment efficacy, moderate to 
large effect sizes during treatment that weaken but remain evident following treatment termination, 
and breadth across a diverse set of SUDs, populations, and settings consistent with and extending 
results from prior reviews.

1. Introduction
Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent in the U.S. as they are in other 
developed countries. These disorders undermine health and longevity and are tremendously 
costly economically. In the U.S. population, for example, approximately 20% of adults 
report past month tobacco use, 25% report past month risky alcohol use (e.g., binge 
drinking), and 10% report past month illicit drug use (SAMSHA, 2014). Excessive use of 
tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs in the U.S. each year is estimated to result in N600 
thousand premature deaths, 166 billion dollars in U.S. annual healthcare costs, and 700 
billion dollars in overall annual costs related to crime, lost work productivity, and healthcare 
combined (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014; CDC, 2014; NDIC, 
2011). Similar patterns of use and adverse consequences are well documented 
internationally (UNODC, 2015). Given these enormous adverse impacts, the development of 
more effective treatments for SUDs is a critically important public health priority.
Contingency management (CM) interventions wherein financial incentives are provided 
contingent on objective evidence of behavior change have shown impressive levels of 
efficacy across a wide range of SUDs (Higgins et al., 2008). Early iterations of this general 
treatment model were first reported in the late 1960s (Elliott and Tighe, 1968) and further 
refined in the 1970s and 1980s, typically among opioid-dependent populations enrolled in 
methadone-based substitution therapy (Stitzer and Higgins, 1995). Voucher-based CM 
wherein individuals receive vouchers exchangeable for retail items or other financial 
incentives was introduced in the early 1990s as part of efforts to develop efficacious 
outpatient treatments for cocaine dependence (Higgins et al., 1991, 1993). The success of 
that model in promoting sustained periods of cocaine abstinence was associated with an 
expansion of CM research to other SUDs and an acceleration of research on this treatment 
strategy (Fig. 1).
Along with this growth in CM research came the need for periodic literature reviews. Our 
group previously published two comprehensive literature reviews on this topic (Higgins et 
al., 2011; Lussier et al., 2006), with the present report representing the third in what is 
intended to be a systematic series that covers the time period from the introduction of the 
voucher model in 1991 to the present. The initial review was a meta-analysis comprising 40 
controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1991 and March 
2004 (13.25 years). The review focused exclusively on treatment effects during the 
intervention period. There was overwhelming evidence of efficacy of this treatment 
approach for increasing abstinence from drug use and retention in treatment across a wide 
range of different types of SUDs, with overall effect sizes in the moderate range (Lussier et 
al., 2006). That review also examined potential moderators of treatment efficacy identifying

 two that significantly increased effect size (i.e., higher incentive monetary values and shorter 
delays in delivering incentives).
The second review in this series was a narrative review that again examined controlled 
studies published in peer-reviewed journals (Higgins et al., 2011). The time period of 
interest was from April 2004 (i.e., the end date in the prior review) to October 2009 (5.5 
years). Sixty-seven reports met inclusion criteria, a more than three-fold increase in 
publications per year over the earlier review. The results were consistent with the earlier 
review in providing overwhelming evidence of efficacy, with 59 of the 67 (88%) reports 
noting significant treatment effects. Importantly, this second review also organized the 
growth in the CM literature into seven trends, a practice that is continued in the current 
review.
Important to mention is that there have been other reviews of the CM literature. One focused 
on CM involving a wide range of different types of incentives (Prendergast et al., 2006), 
another was limited to only CM studies that used a probabilistic schedule of incentive 
delivery (Benishek et al., 2014), still another on CM interventions implemented in outpatient 
methadone maintenance clinics (Griffith et al., 2000), and one that examined only CM 
studies that included a cost-effectiveness analysis (Shearer et al., 2015). However, none of 
those reviews duplicate the focus of the present systematic review on contributing to a series 
exclusively focused on the use of vouchers and related financial incentives among those with 
SUDs.
In the two prior reports in this series, several gaps in the CM literature were identified. 
Lussier et al. (2006) called for additional studies on the influence of incentive value/
magnitude and CM duration on treatment efficacy. Higgins et al. (2011) recommended that 
future studies address technical obstacles that, at the time the review was written, had 
precluded the use of CM with certain SUDs (e.g., alcohol) or to individuals residing in 
geographically remote areas. Both reports recommended that future research on this topic 
should evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains after the incentives were discontinued.
The aims of the present review include (1) characterizing the foci and outcomes of CM 
studies published in the 5.2 year period between November 2009 through 2014, (2) 
characterizing research trends across this most recent period compared to the prior reviews, 
and (3) evaluating whether previously identified gaps in the CM literature have been 
addressed.
2. Methods
The methods employed in the current review are based on those used in Higgins et al. 
(2011). More specifically, the literature search was conducted using Pubmed, the search 
engine of the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Pubmed was searched using the term 
“vouchers OR contingency management,” targeting articles published between November 1, 
2009 through December 31, 2014. Reference sections of review papers retrieved by this 
search were also searched. All articles were reviewed for inclusion by at least two of the 
authors and discrepancies resolved through discussion.

 For inclusion, reports had to (a) involve a monetary-based CM intervention; (b) appear in a 
peer-reviewed journal; (c) include an experimental comparison condition; (d) report during-
treatment results from an original, prospective experimental study; (e) examine treatment 
effects using inferential statistics; and (f) use a research design allowing attribution of 
treatment effects to CM. These criteria differ from the inclusion criteria used in the initial 
review where they also required that studies focus on individuals enrolled in formal 
treatment and have a sample size ≥10 individuals (Lussier et al., 2006), but match those used 
in the immediately preceding review (Higgins et al., 2011).
The reports included in the current review were characterized in terms of the behavior 
change targeted by the CM intervention, whether CM produced statistically significant (p < 
0.05) treatment effects, whether the study examined post-incentive treatment effects, the size 
(Cohen’s d) of treatment effects reported, and discernible trends in the CM literature. Effect 
sizes were not quantified in the 2011 review. A study was categorized as having a significant 
treatment effect if effects of the CM intervention on at least one primary outcome during 
treatment or at treatment termination assessment were significant (p < 0.05). Similarly, a 
study was categorized as having a significant effect at follow-up if significant treatment 
effects on one or more primary outcomes remained significant following discontinuation of 
incentives (p < 0.05). As such, only those studies reporting significant during-treatment 
effects were evaluated for post-incentive treatment effects, with the focus on examining the 
sustainability of treatment effects once incentives were discontinued. In contrast to the prior 
review wherein articles were categorized into only a single primary trend, articles in the 
current review were also assigned to secondary trends when appropriate (see Tables 1–4). 
Identifying additional trends in the literature was not part of the initial review. Authors 
worked in pairs in identifying trends with any discrepancies resolved through discussion.
Cohen’s d was used as the measure of effect size and was calculated for each study, except 
for ten reports that did not have enough information available to calculate an effect size 
(Killeen et al., 2012; Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2013; Kurti and Dallery, 2014; Meredith et al., 
2011; Ondersma et al., 2012; Reback et al., 2010; Tuten et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2010; 
Winstanley et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014). For continuous outcomes, study effect sizes 
were computed based on the reported test statistic. If an appropriate test statistic was not 
available, effect sizes were computed based on means and standard deviations (or standard 
errors) presented in the text, tables or figures. For dichotomous outcomes, study effect sizes 
were computed based on the odds ratio. If an odds ratio was not reported, a 2 × 2 table was 
constructed from the reported percentages and the odds ratio was calculated. Odds ratios 
were then converted to Cohen's d. For studies involving multiple incentive-based treatment 
conditions, a single effect size was obtained by combining the incentive-based treatment 
conditions and calculating the effect size for the combined treatment conditions versus 
control condition or by calculating a weighted average of the individual effect sizes for each 
incentive-based treatment condition relative to the control condition. Random effects meta-
analysis models were used to calculate the estimated average effect sizes and the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals across studies and within the seven trends. These 
models were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 (Biostat Inc., Englewood, 
NJ).

 3. Results
3.1. Overall search results
The search identified 801 reports for review, of which 69 (9%) met inclusion criteria. Of the 
732 studies excluded, 589 (80.5%) did not involve monetary-based CM, 114 (15.6%) did not 
report results from an original, experimental study, 23 (3.1%) did not use a research design 
allowing treatment effects to be attributed to CM, and 6 (1%) did not include an 
experimental comparison condition.
Sixty-nine articles across 5.2 years represent an annual publication rate of 13.3 reports. Most 
of these studies focused exclusively on increasing abstinence from drug use (51 studies or 
73.9%). Ten studies (14.4%) exclusively targeted another therapeutic goal, and 8 (11.5%) 
targeted both abstinence and another therapeutic goal.
CM was highly efficacious across the three different targets, with 59 of 69 studies (86%) 
reporting significant treatment effects. Among studies exclusively targeting abstinence, 43 of 
51 studies (84%) reported significant treatment effects; 9 of 9 studies (100%) exclusively 
targeting other therapeutic goals reported significant treatment effects, as did 7 of 9 studies 
(78%) targeting both abstinence and other therapeutic goals. Average effect size among 
studies reporting significant during-treatment effects was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.75). Average 
effect size across all studies examining during-treatment effects was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54, 
0.70).
Among the 59 studies reporting significant treatment effects, 28 (47%) included at least one 
follow-up assessment after the incentives intervention was discontinued, with eight of these 
28 studies (29%) reporting significant treatment effects at one or more follow-up visits. 
Average effect size across studies reporting significant post-treatment effects was 0.43 (95% 
CI: 0.24, 0.62). Average effect size across all studies examining post-treatment effects was 
0.26 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.41).
3.2. Trends in the literature
The 69 reports meeting inclusion criteria were categorized into seven trends, six of which 
were consistent with those in the immediately prior review (Higgins et al., 2011). Trends 
represented in both reviews include (1) extending CM to special populations, (2) conducting 
parametric studies, (3) extending CM to community clinics,(4) combining CM with 
pharmacotherapies, (5) investigating longer-term outcomes, and (6) using CM as a research 
tool. The present review also includes an additional trend of (7) integrating novel 
technologies (e.g., Smartphones) into CM. In the prior review an additional trend identified 
was extending CM to new SUDs, but that was not a primary aim in any of the studies in the 
current review. Below we comment on the above trends starting with those involving the 
largest number of reports and working to the least, while giving priority to primary trends.
3.2.1. Extending CM to special populations—Extending CM to special populations 
(e.g., adolescents, pregnant women) is the trend under which the most studies were 
categorized (23/69, 33%) (Table 1). Eighteen of these 23 studies (78%) targeted abstinence, 
2 (9%) targeted abstinence and another outcome, and 3 (13%) targeted another outcome

 only. Nineteen of the 23 studies (83%) reported significant treatment effects. Effect sizes 
could be calculated for 17 of those 19 studies, the average of which was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.53, 
0.82). Effect sizes could be calculated for 20 of the total 23 studies categorized under this 
trend, the average of which was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.78). No systematic differences in 
efficacy by CM target or population were noted.
Twelve studies with significant during-treatment effects also reported outcomes following 
discontinuation of the incentives, with four (33%) of those studies reporting significant 
treatment effects at one or more follow-up assessments. Effect sizes could be calculated for 
three of those four studies, the average of which was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.43).
Among the 15 studies categorized under this trend that included one or more follow-up 
assessments, effect sizes could be calculated for 10, with an average effect size of 0.23 (95% 
CI: −0.01, 0.47).
Regarding illicit drug use disorders, studies were reported on CM reducing marijuana use 
(Kaminer et al., 2014; Stanger et al., 2009) among adolescents, and psychomotor stimulant 
and poly-drug use among those with co-morbid mental illness (García-Fernández et al., 
2013; Kelly et al., 2014; McDonell et al., 2013; Petry et al., 2013), socioeconomic 
disadvantage (Secades-Villa et al., 2013), pregnant women and mothers of young children 
(Schottenfeld et al., 2011), sexual minorities (specifically men who have sex with men, 
Menza et al., 2010; Reback et al., 2010), those with HIV infection (Petry et al., 2010), and 
military veterans (Hagedorn et al., 2013).
Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent in the special populations listed above and nine of the 
24 reports in this trend (38%) focused on smoking cessation, including studies with 
socioeconomically disadvantaged pregnant (Higgins et al., 2014; Ondersma et al., 2012) and 
non-pregnant adults (Kendzor et al., 2014), adolescents (Krishnan-Sarin et al., 2013), 
homeless individuals (Businelle et al., 2014), and individuals with co-morbid SUDs (Alessi 
and Petry, 2014; Drummond et al., 2014; Dunn et al., 2010) or mental illness (Hertzberg et 
al., 2013). This application of CM is still in the initial efficacy-testing stages of development 
for most of these populations except for pregnant women where research is now focused on 
late-stage efficacy and cost-effectiveness testing (see Higgins and Solomon, 2016).
3.2.2. Investigating parametric questions—Investigating questions about how 
altering CM parameters impacts treatment outcomes is obviously an important area of 
inquiry (Table 2). In the current review, 11 out of 69 studies (16%) were categorized under 
this trend. Ten of the 11 studies (91%) targeted abstinence, and one (9%) targeted both 
abstinence and another therapeutic goal. Ten studies (91%) reported significant during-
treatment effects with an average effect size of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.82). The one study that 
failed to produce a significant during-treatment effect also failed to include sufficient 
information to calculate an effect size. Thus, the overall effect size is the same as the one 
reported above for studies producing significant effects.
Six studies with significant treatment effects also reported outcomes following 
discontinuation of incentives, with one study (17%) reporting significant treatment effects at

 follow-up and an effect size of 0.43 (95% CI: −0.004, 0.86).A total of seven studies within 
this trend included one or more follow-up assessments. An effect size could be calculated for 
three of those seven studies, with an average of 0.33 (95% CI: −0.20, 0.86).
Parameters investigated included durations of the incentives intervention (Kirby et al., 2013; 
Roll et al., 2013), effect of delay in incentive delivery (Packer et al., 2012), cash versus 
voucher incentive type (Festinger et al., 2014), incentive monetary value (Packer et al., 2012; 
Petry et al., 2012c; Petry et al., 2014a; Romanowich and Lamb, 2010), incentive schedule 
(Ledgerwood et al., 2014; Romanowich and Lamb, 2013; Tuten et al., 2012; Lamb et al., 
2010), and efficacy of CM in combination with a novel treatment component (Kurti and 
Dallery, 2014). Results from these studies indicated that increased incentive duration and 
value generally improves outcomes (e.g., Kirby et al., 2013; Roll et al., 2013) and delays 
between verification of abstinence and incentive delivery diminishes outcomes (Packer et al., 
2012). A study comparing cash and voucher incentives noted that both were efficacious 
although the former may be more cost-effective (Festinger et al., 2012). The majority of 
studies evaluating incentive magnitude reported that higher magnitude incentives were more 
efficacious (Packer et al., 2012; Petry et al., 2012c, Romanowich and Lamb, 2010), although 
one did not (Petry et al., 2014a). Parametric studies evaluating schedule of incentives varied 
greatly. Two studies illustrated that higher values of incentives at the beginning of a schedule 
do not improve outcomes (Ledgerwood et al., 2010; Romanowich and Lamb, 2013—see 
also Higgins et al., 2014 categorized under special populations); another study reported no 
difference between a fixed and escalating schedule of incentives, although authors attributed 
lack of differences to delay in incentive delivery (Tuten et al., 2012). Another study 
evaluating incentive schedule among hard-to-treat (HTT) versus easy-to-treat (ETT) smokers 
using schedules with or without shaping reported that ETT smokers responded to either 
schedule, whereas HTT smokers had better outcomes with shaping (Lamb et al., 2010).
3.2.3. Extending the intervention into community clinics—Extending CM into 
community clinics remained a clear trend in the current review (Table 2). Twelve of the 69 
studies (17%) were categorized under this trend, with six (50%) targeting abstinence, four 
(33%) targeting abstinence and another outcome, and two (17%) targeting another outcome 
only. Ten studies (83%) reported significant during-treatment effects. An effect size could be 
calculated for nine of the studies reporting significant during-treatment effects, with an 
average of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.73). An effect size could be calculated for 10 of the 12 
studies categorized under this trend, with an average of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.70).
Four of the studies with significant treatment effects also reported outcomes following the 
discontinuation of incentives with one of the four (25%) reporting significant effects at 
follow-up and an effect size of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.05, 1.02). A total of six studies within this 
trend included one or more follow-up assessments. An effect size could be calculated for 
four of those six studies, with an average of 0.27 (95% CI: −0.09, 0.63).
Across the twelve studies in this trend, the approaches to implementing CM in community 
clinics included training clinicians to deliver the treatment (Petry et al., 2012a; Petry et al., 
2012b), including CM in group therapy sessions (Branson et al., 2012; Killeen et al., 2012; 
Petry et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2010), and disseminating the treatment to community clinics

 internationally (Chen et al., 2013; García-Fernández et al., 2011; Hser et al., 2011; Jiang et 
al., 2012; Petitjean et al., 2014; Secades-Villa et al., 2014). Both studies that focused on 
training community clinicians to deliver CM reported significant treatment effects (Petry et 
al., 2012a; Petry et al., 2012b). Among the four studies where CM was added to group 
counseling, three reported significant effects on attendance (Branson et al., 2012) or both 
attendance and abstinence outcomes (Petry et al., 2012a; Petry et al., 2012b), whereas one 
study reported no effect of CM on abstinence (Killeen et al., 2012). The lack of treatment 
effects in this latter study was attributed to using very low magnitude incentives with a 
difficult-to-treat population (i.e., marijuana dependent adolescents).
Another set of studies in this category investigated implementation of CM in community 
clinics internationally. For example, CM was implemented in two studies conducted in 
community clinics in Spain, where it was effective in reducing cocaine use (García-
Fernández et al., 2011) and cigarette smoking (Secades-Villa et al., 2014). A Swiss group 
evaluated the relative efficacy of CM + Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) vs. CBT alone in 
treating cocaine dependence in a community clinic (Petitjean et al., 2014). CM + CBT 
produced greater during-treatment but not post-treatment cocaine abstinence. Lastly, three 
CM studies were conducted in methadone maintenance clinics in China to promote both 
attendance and abstinence. CM significantly increased attendance and abstinence in two of 
those studies (Chen et al., 2013; Hser et al., 2011) but not the third (Jiang et al., 2012).
Collectively, the above studies provide sound support for the efficacy of CM when 
implemented in community clinics in the U.S. and abroad.
3.2.4. Incorporating new technologies into CM—CM interventions often entail 
frequent objective monitoring of target behaviors, which can be cumbersome on clinical staff 
and patients alike and also limit the reach of CM. Investigators are increasingly utilizing 
remote behavior-monitoring technologies to surmount this problem (see Kurti et al., 2016, 
for a review). That and other novel technological advances described below led us to include 
this additional trend (Table 3). Eight of the 69 studies (11.5%) were categorized under this 
trend, with seven (87.5%) targeting abstinence from cigarette smoking (three studies) and 
alcohol use (four studies) and the eighth (12.5%) targeting adherence to remote monitoring 
of cocaine craving. All eight studies (100%) reported significant treatment effects. An effect 
size could be calculated for seven of those 8 studies, with an average of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.42, 
0.98). Only one of these studies evaluated post-incentives maintenance of treatment effects, 
which were not significant; the effect size was −0.05 (95% CI: −0.85, 0.76) (Dallery et al., 
2013).
The three studies targeting cigarette smoking monitored smoking status by having 
participants use a web camera to submit time-stamped videos of breath carbon monoxide 
(CO) testing over a study website (Dallery et al., 2013; Meredith et al., 2011; Meredith and 
Dallery, 2013). Two of those studies also included group contingencies wherein teams of 
participants communicated with each other over an online support forum (Meredith et al., 
2011; Meredith and Dallery, 2013).

 Two of the four studies targeting alcohol monitored use with the Secure Continuous Remote 
Alcohol Monitor (SCRAM) device, a real-time, continuous, transdermal monitor (Barnett et 
al., 2011; Dougherty et al., 2014). In the third study, alcohol abstinence was increased while 
monitoring use through time-stamped videos of participants blowing into a breathalyzer 
using a cellphone (Alessi and Petry, 2013). The fourth study targeting alcohol increased 
abstinence while monitoring alcohol intake by analyzing twice-weekly urine samples for 
ethyl glucuronide (EtG), an alcohol metabolite with a 3-day detection period (McDonell et 
al., 2012).
The final study in this trend was a feasibility study demonstrating that CM was effective at 
increasing adherence to a schedule of regular reporting of cocaine cravings/use using an 
interactive voice response (IVR) system (Lindsay et al., 2014).
3.2.5. Combining CM with pharmacotherapies—Combining CM with 
pharmacotherapies is the fourth largest trend in the review (Table 3). Eight of the 69 
included studies (11.5%) were categorized under this trend, with five (62.5%) targeting 
abstinence, and three (37.5%) targeting another therapeutic goal. Six studies (75%) reported 
significant during-treatment effects. An effect size could be calculated for five of those six 
studies, with an average of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.36). Average during-treatment effect size 
for seven of the eight studies categorized under this trend was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.92).
Only one of the six studies reporting significant during-treatment effect assessed outcomes 
following discontinuation of an efficacious during-treatment incentives intervention, and 
treatment effects were not maintained; the effect size was 0.41 (95% CI: −0.53, 1.35) (Gray 
et al., 2011). There were a total of two studies within this trend that included one or more 
follow-up assessments, with an average effect size of 0.21 (95% CI: −0.35, 0.76).
The directions taken by studies included in this trend were: (1) evaluating effects of CM and 
pharmacotherapy alone versus in combination (Gray et al., 2011; Tidey et al., 2011; 
Winstanley et al., 2011; Umbricht et al., 2014), (2) assessing the addition of CM to a 
pharmacotherapy to sustain treatment effects (Ling et al., 2013), and (3) reinforcing 
pharmacotherapy adherence using CM (DeFulio et al., 2012; Everly et al., 2011; Dunn et al., 
2013).
Two of the four studies that evaluated the independent versus combined effects of 
pharmacotherapy plus CM targeted cigarette smoking. In Gray et al. (2011), the combination 
of bupropion plus CM more effectively reduced adolescent cigarette smoking than 
bupropion or CM alone. In contrast, combining bupropion with CM was no more effective 
than CM alone in smokers with schizophrenia (Tidey et al., 2011). The other two studies of 
this type targeted cocaine use among opiate-dependent participants. In Winstanley et al. 
(2011), CM alone was more effective in reducing cocaine use relative to fluoxetine alone or 
CM plus fluoxetine together, whereas in Umbricht et al. (2014) neither the combination of 
CM plus topiramate nor either of these treatment components alone reduced cocaine use. 
Thus, with the exception of adolescent smokers, combining CM with pharmacotherapy did 
not improve outcomes in these studies, which is not encouraging but also not surprising in 
Davis et al.

 that in at least two of the studies there was little evidence that the pharmacotherapy alone 
was efficacious for the SUD investigated (Umbricht et al., 2014; Winstanley et al., 2011).
To further examine CM in opiate-dependent patients, Ling et al. (2013) compared outcomes 
among those receiving buprenorphine in combination with standard drug abuse counseling 
only or in combination with CM, CBT, or CM and CBT. Outcomes across the four treatment 
conditions did not differ significantly, which is inconsistent with an extensive literature 
demonstrating that CM improves outcomes above opioid substitution therapy and drug abuse 
counseling only (e.g., Silverman et al., 1996a; Silverman et al., 1996b).
The remaining three studies demonstrated that employment-based reinforcement promotes 
adherence to extended-release (Defulio et al., 2012; Dunn et al., 2013; Everly et al., 2011) 
and oral naltrexone (Dunn et al., 2013), an opioid antagonist that can decrease opiate use but 
for which adherence is typically poor.
3.2.6. Investigating longer-term outcomes—Although 28 of the studies with 
significant treatment effects in the current review conducted follow-up assessments to 
evaluate post-treatment outcomes, the five studies (7.2%) categorized under this trend were 
those explicitly focused on investigating longer-term outcomes as a primary aim (Table 4). 
Three of these five studies (60%) targeted abstinence and two (40%) targeted abstinence and 
another therapeutic outcome. Four studies (80%) reported significant during-treatment 
effects with an average effect size of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.86). The one study that failed to 
produce a significant during-treatment effect also failed to include sufficient information to 
calculate an effect size. Thus, the overall effect size is the same as the one reported above for 
studies producing significant effects.
All four studies that produced significant treatment effects also measured outcomes 
following discontinuation of the incentives, with two (50%) of those studies maintaining 
significant effects at follow-up assessments with an average effect size of 0.79 (95% CI: 
0.35, 1.22). Three of those four studies (two that produced significant follow-up effects and 
one that did not) included sufficient information to calculate a post-treatment effect size with 
an overall average of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.97).
Studies in this trend took one of two directions. The first direction involved comparing 
outcomes when CM was administered alone versus combined with another treatment that 
might be expected to increase during-treatment abstinence. Wang et al. (2014) reported that 
supplementing methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) with CM failed to reduce heroin use 
and incidences of HIV infection relative to MMT alone (Wangetal., 2014). A second study 
reported that combining CM with the community reinforcement approach (CRA) improved 
post-treatment cocaine abstinence rates and general psychosocial functioning relative to 
standard care (Secades-Villa et al., 2011). The other two studies evaluated CM combined 
with CBT. In one of those studies, combining CM with CBT produced better cocaine use 
outcomes than standard care or CBT alone (McKay et al., 2010), whereas in the other study 
combining CM with CBT failed to decrease longer-term cannabis use significantly more 
than CBT or CM alone (Carroll et al., 2012). These discrepant findings with respect to 
outcomes when combining CM and CBT are difficult to reconcile as the targeted drugs

 (cocaine vs. marijuana) and CM schedule arrangements differed considerably. However, it 
does merit mention that the negative findings reported by Carroll et al. regarding the 
combined effects of CM and CBT compared to CM delivered alone is consistent with other 
research on this particular treatment combination (e.g., Petitjean et al., 2014; Rawson et al., 
2002; Rawson et al., 2006).
The second direction taken involved only one study and used an arrangement wherein 
opioid-dependent individuals earned access to paid employment contingent on cocaine 
abstinence. This therapeutic workplace sustained cocaine abstinence throughout one year of 
abstinence-contingent employment, but treatment effects were not maintained following 
discontinuation of the abstinence contingency (DeFulio and Silverman, 2011).
3.2.7. Using CM as a research tool—Using CM as a research tool is one application 
that currently is quite underutilized (Table 4). This refers to using CM to experimentally 
manipulate drug use or other targets in order to answer other research questions (e.g., how a 
period of initial abstinence influences the probability of longer-term abstinence, or how 
regular use of a novel pharmacotherapy alters illicit drug use). Only two of the 69 studies 
(2.8%) in the current review were categorized under this trend (Bradstreet et al., 2014; Kurti 
and Dallery, 2014). Both reported significant treatment effects. An effect size could be 
calculated for one of the studies, which was 3.27 (95% CI: 2.1, 4.45). Neither examined 
post-treatment outcomes.
Bradstreet et al. (2014) used CM to promote differential levels of recent abstinence from 
cigarette smoking in order to experimentally examine impacts on cue-induced craving and 
response inhibition in a Go/No-Go task. Abstinence across a two-week period produced 
statistically significant and robust decreases in generalized craving relative to 1–2 days of 
abstinence, although no differences in cue-induced craving or response inhibition were 
noted. Kurti and Dallery (2014) administered CM in a laboratory setting to examine whether 
a laboratory-based model of this treatment combined with physical exercise had greater 
impacts on craving and smoking relative to exercise or CM alone. No significant differences 
were noted between combined CM and exercise versus CM alone.
Future research that uses CM as a research tool has the potential to contribute new 
knowledge about numerous important aspects of SUDs, including drug use impacts on 
epigenetic profiles, brain function and structure, immune function, and other health 
outcomes impacted by SUDs.
4. Discussion
Over the past 5.2 years, voucher-based CM studies have continued to appear in the literature 
at a healthy pace of 13.3 studies per year, which is directly comparable to the 14.4 studies 
per year across the five years covered by the immediately prior review (Higgins et al., 2011). 
Considered together, the number of CM studies published per year over the past decade 
represents a substantial increase beyond the rate of 3.0 studies per year (4.2 per year if 
studies that would have met inclusion criteria in the present review are included) reported in 
Lussier et al. (2006), which covered the years 1991–2004. In addition to consistency in the

 pace with which CM studies have been published over the past ten years, the efficacy of CM 
treatments have remained consistent as well, with the current and prior reviews reporting an 
86% and 88% efficacy rate, respectively. Collapsing across the three reviews, this represents 
176 controlled studies on the use of voucher-based CM with substance users, with 151 
(86%) of those studies supporting efficacy. For studies reporting significant treatment effects 
while the incentives were in place, average effect size was moderate to large, and for those 
studies where significant treatment effects remained significant at one or more follow-ups 
following discontinuation of the incentives intervention average effect size was small. The 
same is true for effect sizes based on all studies assessing during-treatment effects and all 
studies assessing post-treatment effects. By any standard for evaluating development of 
treatments for SUDs that we are familiar with, that is a striking level of empirical support for 
efficacy. Indeed, this empirical support has led the National Institute on Clinical Excellence 
to recommend nationwide adoption of CM for intensive outpatient treatments for illicit drug 
use disorders in the U.K. (Pilling et al., 2007) and more recently a similar action within the 
U.S. Veteran Administration hospital system (Petry et al., 2014b).
Also consistent across the present and immediately prior reviews are the trends into which 
studies can be categorized, with two exceptions: (1) the trend extending the intervention to 
additional SUDs was removed in the current review as no new SUDs were targeted in this 
review period, and (2) the addition of the trend incorporating new technology into CM was 
new in the current review. There was also consistency across the current and immediately 
prior reviews with regards to substantial focus on use of CM with special populations. This 
appears to be where CM is clearly finding a niche, perhaps because CM has been 
demonstrated to be among the most effective treatments at promoting abstinence in these 
populations. In comprehensive meta-analyses on smoking-cessation interventions for 
pregnant women, for example, CM produces larger treatment effects than any intervention 
tested in controlled trials going back to 1985 (see Higgins and Solomon, 2016).
In the two prior reviews by our group, we identified several priorities for future CM 
research. In Lussier et al. (2006), we called for increased evaluation of intervention duration 
and voucher incentive value. Studies in the current review that evaluated these parameters 
support earlier findings that longer duration of treatment and higher value incentives 
moderate treatment efficacy. In the immediately prior review (Higgins et al., 2011), we 
called for the development of novel monitoring technologies to facilitate frequent and 
accurate monitoring of alcohol intake so that CM could be used with this highly prevalent 
SUD and also for extending CM to individuals residing in geographically remote areas. The 
development of remote monitoring devices such as the SCRAM bracelet and internet and 
smartphone arrangements for monitoring breath alcohol and carbon monoxide levels within 
the past 5.2 years has contributed to the substantial progress evident in this review (also see 
Kurti et al., 2016). The use of urine EtG monitoring also holds promise for extending CM to 
alcohol use disorders (McDonell et al., 2012).
Another priority identified in both of the prior reviews was further examination of CM 
effects on longer-term abstinence and other post-treatment outcomes. The proportion of 
studies that included ≥ one follow-up assessment in the present review (47%) increased 
slightly above the proportion that included follow-ups in the prior review (41%). In addition, 
Davis et al.

 the proportion of studies supporting the maintenance of treatment effects following the 
discontinuation of incentives also appears to have increased between reviews, from 21% in 
the immediately prior review to 29% in the current review. Clearly there is a weakening in 
the magnitude of treatment effect size when comparing overall effects while incentives are in 
place compared to overall effects after their discontinuation, with generally moderate to 
large effect sizes observed during the former (i.e., 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.70)) and small 
effect sizes in the latter (i.e., 0.26 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.41)). Others have noted this trend toward 
more CM studies examining the sustainability of post-intervention treatment effects as well 
(McKay et al., 2010), but more needs to be done in terms of moving in the direction of all 
CM studies including follow-up assessments and increases in the quality of these efforts. As 
CM studies increasingly focus on longer-term behavior change, it will be important for 
researchers to consider carefully how to program for the maintenance of treatment effects 
using naturalistic or more contrived reinforcers for healthy living. Note that in the small 
handful of studies that were explicitly focused on promoting longer-term outcomes (Table 
4), average overall effect size was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.97). Combined treatment 
interventions that increase during-treatment abstinence and provide skills for sustaining 
abstinence may extend the duration of abstinence post-treatment (McKay et al., 2010; 
Higgins et al., 2000), as might employment-based workplace contingencies or other 
comparable arrangements that are designed to keep programmed contingencies for 
reinforcing abstinence in place long-term or chronically (Silverman et al., 2012). Important 
to underscore is that this need for greater focus on promoting and sustaining longer-term 
behavior change is an important priority and challenge for CM. Also important to note, 
however, is that the need for greater focus on sustaining behavior change is not unique to 
CM and extends to all behavioral, psychosocial, and pharmacological interventions for 
SUDs and other chronic conditions (e.g., obesity) where behavior is a proximal cause.
As development of CM continues, it will be important to remain sensitive to the importance 
of parameters that impact efficacy and effect size (e.g., short delays between engaging in the 
target behavior and earning reinforcement, larger incentive values, and longer duration 
interventions). Implementing lower-cost CM and/or less intensive CM interventions (e.g., 
shorter intervention durations, less frequent behavior monitoring) may increase the 
likelihood of adoption by community clinics with fewer resources, etc., but such 
modifications can be expected to reduce treatment effect size as well. To simultaneously 
maintain the efficacy of CM interventions while promoting greater dissemination, it will be 
necessary for future research to integrate the findings from existing research (e.g., adherence 
to the parameters revealed to be critical to treatment efficacy in experimental evaluations) 
with new developments (e.g., incorporating technology in CM). Most importantly, cost-
effectiveness should be the eventual arbiter in such matters, but is an area where CM and 
other treatment development research for SUDs is lacking. In a recent review on cost-
effectiveness studies on use of CM with illicit drug use disorders, for example, only nine 
studies were identified (Shearer et al., 2015). While results were generally supportive, they 
were also deemed inconclusive. We consider greater attention to that gap to be a high 
priority in future CM research along with continued attention to longer-term outcomes 
discussed above, especially studies wherein preparation for maintenance of treatment effects

 was part of the during-treatment intervention or programmed contingencies of reinforcement 
for healthy behavior change are sustained longer-term.
In sum, CM continues to be a highly efficacious intervention that produces large to medium 
effects during treatment and follow-up, respectively, and across a wide variety of SUDs, 
populations, and settings. Further dissemination of CM into the public and private sector has 
substantial promise for improving public health by promoting abstinence and related 
therapeutic changes among those struggling with SUDs. Further development of this 
intervention model will be enhanced by greater attention to promoting and sustaining longer-
term change, strategies to increase treatment reach through remote monitoring, and careful 
examination of impacts on health, quality-of-life, and societal (e.g., crime, economic 
productivity) outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
