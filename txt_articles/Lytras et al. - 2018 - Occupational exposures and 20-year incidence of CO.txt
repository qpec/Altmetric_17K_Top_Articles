background Occupational exposures have been 
associated with an increased risk of cOPD. However, few 
studies have related objectively assessed occupational 
exposures to prospectively assessed incidence of cOPD, 
using postbronchodilator lung function tests. Our 
objective was to examine the effect of occupational 
exposures on cOPD incidence in the european 
community respiratory Health Survey.
Methods general population samples aged 20–44 
were randomly selected in 1991–1993 and followed 
up 20 years later (2010–2012). Spirometry was 
performed at baseline and at follow-up, with incident 
cOPD defined using a lower limit of normal criterion for 
postbronchodilator FeV1/FVc. Only participants without 
cOPD and without current asthma at baseline were 
included. coded job histories during follow-up were 
linked to a Job-exposure Matrix, generating occupational 
exposure estimates to 12 categories of agents. their 
association with cOPD incidence was examined in log-
binomial models fitted in a Bayesian framework.
Findings 3343 participants fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria; 89 of them had cOPD at follow-up (1.4 
cases/1000 person-years). Participants exposed 
to biological dust had a higher incidence of cOPD 
compared with those unexposed (relative risk (rr) 1.6, 
95% ci 1.1 to 2.3), as did those exposed to gases 
and fumes (rr 1.5, 95% ci 1.0 to 2.2) and pesticides 
(rr 2.2, 95% ci 1.1 to 3.8). the combined population 
attributable fraction for these exposures was 21.0%.
Interpretation these results substantially strengthen 
the evidence base for occupational exposures as an 
important risk factor for cOPD.
InTroduCTIon
COPD is a progressive respiratory disease charac-
terised by a largely non-reversible obstruction of the 
airways leading to airflow limitation.1 It is a leading 
cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, 
whose impact is expected to further increase as the 
population ages.2–4 Tobacco smoking is the primary 
risk factor for COPD5; however, many other envi-
ronmental factors have been implicated in COPD, 
including occupational exposures.6 7 Numerous 
studies, both population-based and industry-based, 
have examined the relationship between occupa-
tion and COPD-related outcomes.6 8–11 An interac-
tion between smoking and occupational exposures 
has also been observed.12 It has been estimated that 
about 15% of COPD cases are attributable to expo-
sures at the workplace,8 with a higher population 
attributable fraction among non-smokers.13 14 
Despite a wealth of evidence on COPD risk factors 
from population-based studies, few such studies 
have assessed the incidence of COPD in a prospec-
tive manner,15 16 and even fewer have specifically 
examined the association between occupational 
exposures and the incidence of spirometry-de-
fined COPD.17 The discussion about occupational 
exposures and COPD is very old, particularly

with exposures such as gases and dusts.18 19 However, in recent 
decades, entire industries and occupations have changed, trans-
formed or outright disappeared, and protective measures have 
been implemented in many cases. At the same time, there is a 
worldwide decline in the prevalence of smoking,20 which the 
leading risk factor for COPD and is related to occupation and 
socioeconomic status.21 In this new context, the association of 
occupational exposures with COPD incidence requires re-exam-
ination, as results from older studies might not still be applicable 
today.
The European Community Respiratory Health Survey 
(ECRHS) is a large multicentre population-based longitudinal 
study with a long follow-up duration; earlier cross-sectional and 
longitudinal analyses in this relatively young cohort showed an 
association between occupation and asthma as well as chronic 
bronchitis symptoms, but not with accelerated lung function 
decline or increased COPD incidence.22 23 The objective of the 
current analysis was to examine the effect of occupational expo-
sures on postbronchodilator spirometry-defined COPD inci-
dence in the ECRHS, after 20 years of follow-up.
MeThods
eCrhs study overview
The ECRHS is a multicentre longitudinal study initiated in 
1991–1993, which enrolled random general population samples 
aged 20 to 44 years in 55 centres from 23 countries.24 Partici-
pants at baseline (ECRHS I) completed a detailed questionnaire 
via face-to-face interview and underwent a clinical examination, 
spirometry and other tests. They were followed up again between 
1998 and 2002 (ECRHS II), and a second time between 2010 
and 2012 (ECRHS III). Ethical approval for each centre was 
obtained from their respective competent bodies, and written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
study population, spirometry and CoPd definition
The population eligible for this study included all participants 
who completed spirometry at baseline (ECRHS I) and at the 
second follow-up (ECRHS III). Spirometry was performed 
according to the American Thoracic Society/European Respira-
tory Society standards for reproducibility, using the maximum 
value observed per participant for the FVC and FEV1. Baseline 
spirometry at ECRHS I was performed without bronchodila-
tion; spirometry at ECRHS III was performed postbronchodila-
tion, 15 
min after administering two 100 µg puffs of salbutamol 
using a spacer. We excluded participants with a baseline FEV1/
FVC ratio under the lower limit of normal (LLN) for their age, 
sex and gender according to the GLI-2012 equations.25 We also 
excluded participants who reported having current asthma at 
baseline; current asthma was defined as a positive response to 
either of the following three questions: “have you had an attack 
of asthma in the last 12 months?”, “are you currently taking 
any medicines for asthma?”  and “have you been woken by an 
attack of shortness of breath at any time in the last 12 months?”. 
Incident COPD was defined using spirometry only, as a post-
bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio under the LLN at the end of 
follow-up.
occupational exposure assessment
At both follow-up interviews, participants were asked to provide 
a detailed list of their occupations and industries from jobs 
held since the previous study visit that were performed for at 
least 8 
hours a week for at least 3 
months. Each such employ-
ment was recorded in free text and subsequently coded in the 
International Classification of Occupations-88 (ISCO-88) by 
trained local coders. Occupations were also further grouped into 
14 wider job categories, as previously defined.23 Occupational 
exposures were assessed by linking the ISCO-88 occupational 
codes to the semiquantitative ALOHA(+) Job-Exposure Matrix 
(JEM).26 This JEM assigns, for every job code, three grades of 
exposure (none, low, high) to 10 categories of agents (biological 
dusts, mineral dusts, gases/fumes, herbicides, insecticides, fungi-
cides, aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents, other solvents 
and metals) plus two composites of the above (all pesticides and 
vapours/gases/dusts/fumes—VGDF). Exposures for every partic-
ipant were defined and analysed for the entire follow-up period, 
that is, from ECRHS I to ECRHS III.
data analysis
Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the prob-
ability of COPD at the end of follow-up period as a function 
of exposure, covariates and length of follow-up; these models 
directly provide relative risk estimates for each covariate. Given 
that the incidence of COPD is heavily associated with lung func-
tion at baseline,27 we further adjusted all models for participants’ 
FEV1/FVC ratio at baseline, expressed as per cent predicted 
according to the GLI-2012 equations. Other covariates used 
for adjustment were age at baseline, sex, lifetime smoking pack-
years, socioeconomic status (SES) and early life disadvantage 
score. Early life disadvantage score is a composite variable that 
includes maternal smoking, maternal asthma, paternal asthma, 
childhood asthma (before age 10) and having a serious respira-
tory infection before age 5.28 SES was defined according to the 
participants’ age of completion of formal education and clas-
sified into three categories: high (>19 years), middle (16–19 
years) and low (<16 years). We also included quadratic terms 
for age at baseline and lifetime smoking pack-years in order to 
account for any non-linear relationships between these important 
covariates and COPD incidence.29
Each of the 12 ALOHA(+) exposures was assessed in a univar-
iate fashion, that is, exposed versus unexposed (to the respec-
tive agent). Given the substantial overlap between exposures 
in certain jobs, we also examined each one in comparison to a 
common group consisting of those unexposed to all 12 occupa-
tional agents under study. In addition, for certain exposures, we 
fit bivariate models, that is, models with two exposures, where 
the effect of each one is adjusted for the presence of the other. 
Stratified effects by sex were obtained by including appropriate 
interaction terms in the models, and dose-response was exam-
ined by including separate terms for only low and for ever high 
exposure. As a sensitivity analysis, we refitted the models after 
excluding incident asthma cases, that is, those reporting asthma 
(as defined above) in either of the two ECRHS follow-up visits. 
As a further sensitivity analysis, we also fitted ‘reduced’ models 
without adjustment for SES, early life disadvantage score and 
baseline FEV1/FVC. A secondary analysis involved using job 
categories as the exposure, that is, ever working in a particular 
category during follow-up, in comparison to a common unex-
posed group consistently working in white-collar occupations.
All models were fitted in a Bayesian framework with the JAGS 
software,30 setting non-informative Gaussian priors for all fixed-ef-
fects parameters, and using 4 chains and 32 
000 iterations per chain, 
discarding the first 2000 as burn-in. Convergence was checked by 
visual inspection of the MCMC traceplots and by the Gelman-Rubin 
statistic. The Bayesian framework avoids convergence issues that 
have sometimes been reported when fitting log-binomial models in 
a frequentist setting. T

resulTs
The flow of ECRHS participants into our study sample is illus-
trated in figure 1; in total, 3343 participants were analysed, orig-
inating from 24 study centres in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, 
Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland and UK). Of these participants, 1409 were never 
smokers and 1934 were ever smokers (current or ex-smokers 
at the end of follow-up). The characteristics of our study popu-
lation are shown on table 1. Median age at baseline was 34.5 
years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 20.0 years (range 
18.0–22.4). COPD occurred in 96 participants, for an incidence 
of 1.4 cases/1000 person-years. As expected, COPD incidence 
in ever smokers was much higher than in never smokers (2.0 
vs 0.6 cases/1000 person-years, P<0.001). Lifetime smoking 
pack-years at follow-up were missing in 448/1934 ever smokers 
(23.2%, or 13.4% of the entire study population), for whom 
Bayesian imputation was performed.
Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the 
3343 participants included in the analysis and the 4644 who 
were eligible (FEV1/FVC>LLN 
and no current asthma at base-
line) but could not be included; those not included in the analysis 
were slightly more likely to be ever smokers and of lower SES 
than those finally analysed (see online supplementary table 1).
The percentage of participants exposed ranged across the 
occupational agents, from a minimum of 4.9% to pesticides

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
to a maximum of 48.4% to VGDF; 1696 participants (50.7%) 
did not have any low or high occupational exposure during 
the follow-up period. There was substantial overlap and thus 
correlation between exposures (figure 2), particularly between 
the various types of pesticides and solvents, and also between 
gases and fumes and other exposures.
The effect (relative risk (RR) and 95% Credible Intervals) 
of occupational exposures on COPD incidence compared with 
participants unexposed (to the respective agent) is presented in 
table 2. For all exposures except solvents and metals, the crude 
incidence of COPD among exposed (percentage of participants 
with COPD at the end of follow-up) was higher than among 
those unexposed. After adjusting for covariates in log-binomial 
models, there was a significant effect for biological dust (RR 1.6, 
95% CI 1.1 to 2.3 vs unexposed) as well as for all pesticides 
(RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.8), and in particular insecticides 
(RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2); however, the effect for all pesti-
cides and insecticides was based on a small number of cases (10 
and 8, respectively). Gases and fumes showed a significant effect 
compared with participants with no such exposure (RR 1.5, 
95% CI 1.0–2.2), while for mineral dust and VGDF the effect 
was not significant.
Running the models after excluding incident asthma cases did 
not materially change the results (see online supplementary table 
2); biological dust and gases and fumes showed a marginally 
stronger effect (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.1, and RR 1.9, 95% CI 
1.2 to 3.0, respectively), while the effect for pesticides was the 
same (RR 1.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.9). We also ran the models 
using a common, fully unexposed comparator group (see online 
supplementary table 3); this also did not substantially alter the 
results, although for gases and fumes the effect fell below the 
conventional level of statistical significance (RR 1.4, 95% CI 
1.0 to 2.1).
Including both any biological dust and any pesticide exposure 
in the same log-binomial model, mutually adjusting each effect 
for the presence of the other, resulted in a RR of 1.5, 95% CI 
1.0 to 2.2 and 1.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.2 for biological dust and 
pesticides, respectively. Adding also exposure to gases and fumes 
to this model resulted in increased uncertainty and an RR of 1.3, 
95% CI 0.8 to 2.2 for biological dust, 1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.2 
for pesticides, and 1.2, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.0 for gases and fumes. 
Assuming these point RRs and the proportions of exposed 
participants in our study population, the corresponding PAFs 
were 10.5% for biological dust, 4.4% for pesticides and 9.2% 
for gases and fumes; the combined PAF31 for all three exposures 
was 21.0%.
No differences between men and women were observed in 
the effect of occupational exposures on the incidence of COPD 
(see online supplementary table 4). We also ran models for each 
exposure stratified by intensity, that is, no exposure versus any 
low versus any high exposure. In these models, there was weak 
evidence of a dose–response relationship for biological dust, but 
none for pesticides, gases and fumes or other exposures (table 3). 
The additional RR for high biological dust exposure compared 
with low exposure was 1.5, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.8, as there were few 
incident COPD cases particularly in the high exposure group 
(10/111, 9.0%).

Among covariates in the models, age and smoking pack-years 
were strongly associated with COPD, as expected. Men were 
only slightly more likely than women to suffer from COPD 
(adjusted RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.7). Importantly, there was a 
strong inverse relationship between %predicted FEV1/FVC at 
baseline and COPD incidence at the end of the follow-up period 
(figure 3); each percentage point of increase lowered the inci-
dence of COPD by a factor (RR) of 0.8, 95% CI 0.8 to 0.9. Early 
life disadvantage score did not affect COPD incidence (RR per 
unit change 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.3), and neither did medium 
(RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.3) or low SES (RR 0.8, 95% CI 
0.4 to 1.5).
Associations between occupational exposures and COPD inci-
dence were not substantially modified by omitting adjustments 
for SES, early life disadvantage score and/or %predicted FEV1/
FVC at baseline (see online supplementary table 5).
The secondary analysis by job category indicated a higher inci-
dence of COPD in participants who had worked in the trans-
port industry (1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.2), in the wood, paper and 
textile industry (2.1, 95% CI 0.9–4.5) and in agriculture, fishery 
and forestry (2.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.0); however, the precision of 
these estimates was limited by the low number of study partic-
ipants working in each job category (see online supplementary 
table 6). Occupations belonging to these three categories were 
very frequently exposed to biological dust, pesticides and gases/
fumes. Overall, the most frequent occupations with exposure to 
these agents are shown in online supplementary table 7.
dIsCussIon
Our study found that exposure to biological dust in a general 
population cohort did result in an increased incidence of spiro-
metrically defined COPD over the course of 20 years. Biological 
dust has been shown to affect lung function decline and chronic 
respiratory symptoms in several worker-based studies such as in 
farmers, cotton textile and woodworkers.33–36 An association 
with COPD prevalence has also been demonstrated in a commu-
nity-based cross-sectional study26 and recently in another one 
from Australia.37 To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
demonstrate an effect of biological dust exposure on the inci-
dence of COPD in a prospective fashion in a general population 
cohort. This effect remained strong even after adjustment for 
other exposures or exclusion of incident asthma cases, and also 
exhibited some evidence of a dose–response relationship, that 
is, a higher incidence of COPD with high exposure to biological 
dust. As such, the study is a significant addition to the evidence 
base about the role of biological dust on respiratory health.
Exposure to pesticides has also been linked with asthma and 
possibly COPD in a variety of studies.37–39 More recently, an 
association of pesticide exposure with accelerated lung func-
tion decline was observed in a longitudinal community-based 
study from the Netherlands; this association was stronger for 
smokers.40 Our study adds further prospective confirmation that 
pesticides increase the incidence of COPD. Interestingly, in our 
study, exposure to pesticides occurred in the 1990s and 2000s, 
while in the Dutch study, exposure happened mostly before 
1990; this may indicate that contemporary changes in active 
ingredients, pesticide application methods and personal protec-
tive measures may have been insufficient to mitigate the risk to 
workers.
On the other hand, the lack of association between mineral 
dust exposure and COPD incidence may be explained by the 
composition of jobs included in this category (see online supple-
mentary table 7). Older studies found a link between mining

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(especially coal mining), as well as various industrial occupations, 
and COPD. Such mining and industrial jobs were a minority in 
our study population, which was recruited in the early 1990s. 
Instead, the most frequent jobs with exposure to mineral dust 
in our study were truck and lorry drivers for men, and cleaners 
for women.
Disentangling the effects of multiple overlapping occupational 
exposures is a particular challenge. Our approach was twofold, 
that is, we compared each exposure with those unexposed, 
and separately with a common fully occupationally unexposed 
comparison group. The first choice of comparator is simpler, but 
includes other occupational exposures that may attenuate any 
association with the exposure under study. The second compar-
ator (fully unexposed group) avoids this problem, but may 
increase the potential for residual confounding particularly with 
respect to SES, as the people in this group (mostly white-collar 
workers) are likely to be different in more ways than a model 
can handle. Nevertheless, in our case, we found similar results 
with both approaches. We then followed up with bivariate and 
multivariate models, that is, models that include more than one 
occupational exposure, as well as an analysis by job category; 
however, this requires a large sample size to maintain precision 
in the effect estimates.
Occupational exposures have been associated with both 
asthma and COPD incidence in population studies17 41; COPD 
and asthma are two different disease entities, modulated by 
distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, but with considerable 
clinical and symptom overlap.42 As a result, in our basic analyses, 
we did not exclude incident asthma cases. A sensitivity analysis 
with incident asthma cases excluded did not substantially modify 
the results.
In all models, we adjusted for the FEV1/FVC ratio at base-
line, expressed as %predicted, which we found to be a strong 
predictor of subsequent COPD incidence. This is hardly 
surprising since COPD is not a stochastic event, but one that 
results from a progressive lung function decline below a given 
threshold. As such, the ‘distance to be covered’ between baseline 
FEV1/FVC and the LLN threshold is critical, and we believe it 
should be adjusted for in future prospective studies of COPD 
incidence.
The study has several strengths. Being a population-based 
study increases generalisability of the findings, especially given 
the prospective design and follow-up of 20 years, one of the 
longest to date. Complete occupational histories were collected, 
and a full spectrum of exposures for the follow-up period was 
determined using a JEM instead of self-report, which could 
be more vulnerable to bias. We were thus able to explore the 
effect of particular exposures on COPD incidence and their 
contribution to the disease burden. Confounders were tightly 
controlled: we included adjustments for SES and baseline lung 
function, and we accounted for non-linear relationships with 
age and smoking pack-years using quadratic terms; therefore, 
residual confounding by intensity of smoking is most unlikely. 
Lifetime pack-years of smoking were missing in many current 
or ex-smokers of our study population; we used fully Bayesian 
imputation to handle the problem and draw reliable inference 
while reflecting the appropriate uncertainty, assuming ignorable 
missingness (see online supplement).
On the other hand, COPD incidence in our study popula-
tion was much lower than in other published studies15 43 44; the 
most likely reason for this was the still fairly young age of our 
cohort at follow-up (median age 55, range 39–68 years). Also, 
the use of prebronchodilation spirometry at baseline to filter out 
prevalent COPD cases may have led to the exclusion of some 
participants with reversible or borderline obstruction at baseline. 
Because of the low number of incident COPD cases, especially 
in lifetime non-smokers, we could not stratify our analysis by 
smoking status to check for effect modification. For the same 
reason, several of our effect estimates were characterised by low 
precision, especially those stratified by sex and by intensity of 
exposure. In addition, we defined COPD with postbronchidila-
tion spirometry only and not based on symptoms of chronic bron-
chitis, which would have raised specificity but severely limited 
the number of incident cases in this analysis. Another limitation 
stems from the fact that the outcome of COPD was only assessed 
at the end of follow-up, thus could in theory have predated the 
exposure. However, out of 56 occupationally exposed partic-
ipants with incident COPD, most were already working at an 
exposed job at the start of follow-up or had a prebronchodila-
tion FEV1/FVC>LLN at ECRHS II after having started working 
at exposed jobs. Only for 7/56 participants (12.5%) it could not 
be disproven that COPD might have occurred before the occu-
pational exposure. Still this is very unlikely, as COPD incidence 
is strongly related to age and because participants developing 
COPD might be less likely to start working in exposed jobs 
unless previously exposed.
Nevertheless, the fact that some occupational exposure effects 
(namely biological dust, gases and fumes and pesticides) were 
observed even in this relatively young study population is highly 
important from a public health point of view. A large propor-
tion of workers have these exposures (49% among ever smokers 
in our study population), and their association with COPD 
incidence translates into a substantial number of attributable 
cases in the population (an estimated 21.0% in this analysis); 
this suggests that up to one in five new COPD cases among 
middle-aged people in Western countries could be prevented by 
avoiding or controlling occupational exposures in contemporary 
jobs. Our study confirms previous findings regarding the role 
of occupation on the burden of COPD6 8 and provides strong 
prospective evidence and direct quantitative estimates for the 
impact of occupational exposures on COPD incidence. Future 
studies should clarify whether these effects are modified by 
smoking, their interplay with asthma, and further detail the risks 
involved with respect to particular occupations, activities and 
noxious agents.
