AIMS
The aim of this study was to perform an up-to-date meta-analysis on the risk of cardiac malformations associated with gestational
exposure to paroxetine, taking into account indication, study design and reference category.
METHOD
A systematic review of studies published between 1966 and November 2015 was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE. Studies
reporting major malformations with first trimester exposure to paroxetine were included. Potentially relevant articles were assessed
and relevant data extracted to calculate risk estimates. Outcomes included any major malformations and major cardiac malformations.
Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models.
RESULTS
Twenty-three studies were included. Compared with non-exposure to paroxetine, first trimester use of paroxetine was associated with
an increased risk of any major congenital malformations combined (pooled OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10, 1.38; n = 15 studies), major cardiac
malformations (pooled OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11, 1.47; n = 18 studies), specifically bulbus cordis anomalies and anomalies of cardiac septal
closure (pooled OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07, 1.89; n = 8 studies), atrial septal defects (pooled OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.14, 4.97; n = 4 studies) and right
ventricular outflow track defect (pooled OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.06, 4.93; n = 4 studies). Although the estimates varied depending on the
comparator group, study design and malformation detection period, a trend towards increased risk was observed.
CONCLUSIONS
Paroxetine use during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of any major congenital malformations and
cardiac malformations. The increase in risk is not dependent on the study method or population.
Introduction
Up to one-fifth of women of childbearing age experience
moderate to severe depressive symptoms [1]. Pregnancy
may be a time of risk for both new onset and reoccurrence
of depression, with prevalence rates of depression ranging
from 7% to 20% [2–5]. Depression during pregnancy is as-
sociated with poor maternal nutrition, inadequate weight
gain, smoking, alcohol and other substance intake, and
increased risk of post-partum depression [6–10]. Antide-
pressant prescribing during pregnancy has increased up
to four-fold between 1992 and 2006 with a total of 4.8%
of women receiving a prescription in the months prior to
pregnancy in the UK [11]. Prevalence rates are estimated
to be 4.5% (2009) in Canada and up to 13% (2007) in the
US [12, 13]. The most frequently used treatment for

 depression in pregnant women is selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [14, 15], accounting for ap-
proximately 80% of prescribed antidepressants during
pregnancy [11, 12, 15–18]. The widespread use of antide-
pressants during pregnancy makes it essential to under-
stand the safety and the risk of adverse outcomes in
the fetus.
Up until 2005 paroxetine was considered to be safe
for use during pregnancy [19–23]. However, following re-
sults from a small unpublished study conducted by the
manufacturer, there were suggestions of an increase in
the risk of cardiac malformations in infants with in utero
exposure to paroxetine, compared with those unexposed
to paroxetine. This resulted in a modification of the
product label to include warnings of the risk of cardiac
malformations with antenatal exposure to paroxetine
[24]. At the same time, the US FDA changed the classifica-
tion of paroxetine from pregnancy category C (human
data lacking: animal studies positive or not done) to
category D (human data show risk, but benefit may out-
weigh). Subsequent to these changes, numerous studies
using various study designs with the use of different pop-
ulations across Europe and North America have been
published. Some supported statistically significant asso-
ciation of the risk of congenital malformations with first
trimester exposure of paroxetine [25–31]. Conversely,
findings from other studies showed conflicting results in
terms of statistical significance, although a trend remained
towards an increased risk.
Paroxetine and other SSRIs are known to cross the
maternal placental barrier [32, 33] and significant con-
centrations of antidepressants have been found in the
amniotic fluid [34]. It is thought that SSRIs may affect
fetal cardiovascular and central nervous system develop-
ment through interference with the serotonin 5-HT2B
receptor [35]. In addition, physiological systems such as
the sleep-wake cycle, circadian rhythms and hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis are affected by increased serotonergic
neurotransmission [36].
As more studies have been conducted overtime, a
number of meta-analyses have been performed in order
to find more conclusive answers to the question of tera-
togenicity associated with paroxetine and/or other SSRIs.
Earlier meta-analyses, that reported an increased risk of
cardiac defects associated with paroxetine had method-
ological limitations such as using studies that did not
adjust for all potential risk factors for malformations (con-
founders) [37, 38]. Wurst et al. [38] have performed a meta-
analysis showing that paroxetine use during pregnancy
was increasing the risk of cardiac defects. However, some
studies were not considered and only studies up to 2009
were used. In an attempt to categorize studies in terms of
their quality (by using quality tools), Girgordiadis et al. [39]
conducted a meta-analysis using 19 studies on SSRIs as a
class, with a sub-analysis of individual SSRIs. They found an
increased risk of congenital cardiac malformations, but major
malformations as a whole were not associated with paroxe-
tine exposure. Myles et al. [40] conducted another meta-
analysis of 16 studies also investigating SSRIs as a whole
but excluded studies with any antidepressant medications
in the comparator group. Paroxetine was associated with
an increase in the risk of major malformations and cardiac
malformations. However, some relevant studies were not
included in Myles et al. [40], and the majority of studies used
did not distinguish between the potential effect of depres-
sion (the underlying condition) and the drug (paroxetine)
on the risk of major and cardiac malformations.
There is a strong recommendation for studies to include
untreated patients with depression and/or other psychia-
tric diagnoses [41]. Recent studies have attempted to
overcome this by including a comparison group of
untreated depressed patients [16, 42–44], some of which
were not considered in previous meta-analyses. In light of
new publications and recent recommendations, we aimed
to conduct a meta-analysis incorporating more recent find-
ings, stratifying on types of comparison groups to update
current understanding of paroxetine and major congenital
malformations, with a particular focus on cardiac defects.
The impact of study designs, methodologies and compara-
tor groups (reference category) on the quantification of the
effect were also studied.
Method
Electronic and hand searches
A systematic electronic literature search of English and
French language publications, indexed in MEDLINE and
EMBASE databases between 1966 to the 10 November
2015, was conducted by three individual reviewers inde-
pendently (AB, NI, SC) using a broad combination of
search terms. The search strategy was written in Ovid
and run in each database (Supplementary file S1). Strate-
gies were based on the subject headings specific to the
individual databases searched, combined with appropri-
ate keywords and phrases. After exclusion of duplicates,
full text of potentially relevant studies was retrieved
and examined. The reference list of manuscripts included
in the analysis, were manually searched for additional
relevant publications. Corresponding authors of studies
that contained information on SSRIs, but not specifically
on paroxetine, as an individual drug, were contacted for
additional information. Information available in previous
meta-analyses that were obtained by investigators from
the corresponding authors was also used [38, 40].
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included if 1) they investigated paroxetine
use during the first trimester of pregnancy (if the study
investigated SSRIs as a class, it was only included if indi-
vidual data or a sub-analysis for paroxetine use alone
was available), 2) they had a comparator group, 3) they

 reported an effect measure such as odds ratio (OR), risk
ratio (RR) or there were enough information to calculate
an unadjusted OR and 4) the outcomes investigated
included any major congenital malformations, and/or
major cardiac malformations and/or sub-categories of
cardiac defects. Studies were excluded if 1) exposure con-
sisted of SSRIs and/or other antidepressants combined or 2)
exposure did not occur during the first trimester of preg-
nancy. Additionally, if the data source of two or more studies
overlapped with each other (time period, population,
inclusion and exclusion criteria), the most recent study was
included (Supplementary file S2).
Data extraction
Data were extracted from each study independently by
two reviewers using a standardized extraction form.
Disagreements of data collected were resolved by re-
examining the data by a third reviewer.
Meta-analysis
Since the prevalence of major congenital malformations
is less than 10%, we have assumed that the OR is equiv-
alent to the RR and will refer to the effect measure as
OR throughout [45]. If the effect size was not reported
in the study, we calculated the unadjusted OR and their
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from the raw data.
We used the adjusted ORs in preference to unadjusted
ORs, and estimates related to all infants in preference
to estimates from subgroups only. Due to the differences
in methods between study populations, a random effects
model was used to calculate a pooled OR for each
outcome in our meta-analysis [46]. In order to evaluate
publication bias in our main meta-analysis, we inspected
a funnel plot (eye ball test). However, given the inherent
subjectivity of a graphical assessment, the Egger test and
trim and fill methods were used to adjust for a potential
publication bias [47]. Also, abstract data were combined
with the included studies in a sensitivity analysis. The
I-squared (I2) test was used to assess the percentage of
the variability in effect estimates that is due to hetero-
geneity rather than sampling error (chance).
In an attempt to explain possible heterogeneity be-
tween studies, we conducted several sub-group analyses
by study design (cohort/case control), continent (North
America, Europe, Australia), type of comparator groups,
time to defect ascertainment (less than 1 year/up to 1 year
and more), definitions of first trimester exposure, type of
data source (administrative claims data/prescription data-
bases linked to registries, clinical data linked to registries
and teratogen information services) and timing of the
exposure. We also restricted the main analysis to the use
of only adjusted OR estimates (no unadjusted values),
studies that specified excluding chromosomal and/or
genetic defects and other teratogenic substances, studies
that adjusted for depression or consisted of a depressed
cohort and studies that excluded or adjusted analyses for
individuals with epilepsy or hypertension. In addition, sen-
sitivity analyses using fixed effects were performed to en-
sure the robustness of our results. All pooled ORs were
calculated using STATA software (version 11).
Results
After screening abstracts and titles, 53 articles were
identified as potentially relevant studies and full texts
were obtained (Figure 1). In addition, nine articles were
identified through hand searching references. Twenty-
three studies in total were included in the meta-analysis,
16 with a result on major malformations [16, 19, 20, 23,
24, 26–28, 30, 41, 47, 48, 50–52, 54] and 19 with a result
on cardiac malformations [16, 19, 23, 24, 26–30, 41, 43,
47–52, 54, 55]. Thirty of the potentially relevant articles
were excluded in the analysis because they did not inves-
tigate the outcome of interest (major congenital malfor-
mations, major cardiovascular malformations) (n = 5),
exposure time window was not in the first trimester
(n = 4), exposure group of interest contained other
SSRIs or antidepressants (n = 8), overlapped with a pre-
vious study/and or combined previously published
results/updated later (n = 3), contained a control group
from a different population (n = 1), were abstracts
(n = 7) or a commentary (n = 1) (Supplementary file
S2). Relevant results available from abstracts were not
included in the main analysis. However four were
added to the sub-analyses [56–59].
Three authors were contacted for additional informa-
tion [44, 61, 62]. Two authors could not give specific
information for paroxetine and the studies were not
included in the analysis [60, 61]. One author provided
additional information and the study was included [44].
Further information on studies published in previous
meta-analyses that were obtained through author contact
was also included in our meta-analysis [19, 20, 38, 40].
Characteristics of studies included
Included studies contained data collected from Australia,
Canada, Denmark, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden,
United Kingdom and United States. Four studies used a
case–control design [27, 29, 30, 51] and the remaining
15 used cohort study designs. Study populations ranged
from 534 subjects to 949 504 in size. The most common
data sources were prescription databases linked to birth
registries. Other sources included claims and administra-
tive databases, active surveillance cohorts and teratogen
information service data (Table 1).
In order to include prescriptions received immedi-
ately before pregnancy and potentially used during
pregnancy (duration overlaps with the start of preg-
nancy), the majority of studies defined the exposure
time window as 30 days prior to conception date until
the end of the first trimester (14 weeks of gestation; nine

 studies). Comparison groups consisted of unexposed to
any
antidepressants
(non-medicated
depressed
and
non-depressed women), those unexposed to SSRIs (non-SSRI
treated patients or other antidepressant treated patients,
non-medicated depressed patients, non-depressed women)
and unexposed to paroxetine (can be exposed to other
SSRIs or non-SSRI antidepressants). Two studies used
non-medicated controls with a diagnosis of depression
[42, 50] and the control groups in two studies consisted
of all subjects treated with other antidepressants [28, 29].
Oberlander et al. [53] and Nordeng et al. [52] adjusted for
depression in their analyses. Knudsen et al. [44] and
Jiminez-Solem et al. [16] included an exposure group of
women who stopped SSRIs treatment 3 to 12 months
before the last menstrual period, did not use their SSRIs
during pregnancy but restarted taking the same SSRIs after
pregnancy. Most studies adjusted for maternal age. Other
confounding factors that were adjusted for included
smoking, alcohol use, folic acid intake, year of birth, par-
ity, presence of chronic diseases, body mass index,
education, other medications, income and maternal de-
pression (Table 1).
Major congenital malformations
Based on 15 studies using women unexposed to paro-
xetine as reference category (women could be using
other antidepressants including other SSRIs), the use of
paroxetine was associated with a statistically significant
23% increased risk of major congenital malformations
(pooled OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10, 1.38) [16, 19, 20, 25,
27–29, 31, 42, 48, 49, 51–53, 55] (Figure 2A). After
restricting
the
analysis
to
studies
that
compared
women using paroxetine with women unexposed to
SSRIs, the ORs remained similar (Table 2, Figure 2).

 was observed in this latter subgroup (I2 = 30.9%) (Table 2). It
remained nevertheless that the inter-study heterogeneity
was null or very low in the majority of combinations.
Cardiac malformations
An aggregated outcome for all cardiac malformations
was reported in 19 studies with a total of 20251 women
exposed to paroxetine (Figure 2). The estimate for all ma-
jor cardiac malformations in women exposed to paroxe-
tine compared with non-paroxetine exposure (can be
exposed to other antidepressants) was pooled OR 1.28
(95% CI 1.11, 1.47; n = 19 studies) (Table 2, Figure 2D). This
estimate was similar when the comparison group was
restricted to women with no antidepressant use (Table 2,
Figure 2F). The risk estimate increased slightly when the
analysis was restricted to studies with adjusted estimates
(pooled OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.23, 1.62; n = 13 studies)
(Table 2). Estimates varied amongst different data
sources; i.e. lower pooled risk was seen in studies
conducted with data from administrative databases
(pooled OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79, 1.25; n = 4 studies). A higher
risk was seen in studies conducted with data obtained in
Europe (pooled OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06, 1.84; n = 7 studies)
(Table 2).

Publication bias
A publication bias was present in the meta-analysis on the
risk of major congenital malformations (n = 16 studies)
(Supplementary file S3) and cardiac malformations (n = 19
studies). We performed an adjustment for publication bias
using the trim and filled method [47] which imputed four
theoretical
missing
estimates
for
major
congenital
malformations and three for cardiac malformations. The
revised pooled, estimates taking into account publica-
tion bias, were pooled ORadjusted
for
publication
bias 1.16
(95% CI 1.01, 1.33) for major malformations and pooled
ORadjusted for publication bias 1.20 (95% CI 1.05, 2.69) for cardiac
malformations, compared with the pooled ORs of 1.23
(major malformations) and 1.28 (cardiac malformations)
before adjustment. Publication bias of the eight studies
on bulbus cordis anomalies and anomalies of cardiac
septal closure was not present (Egger >0.05). The fit
and trim method did not impute any hypothetical
‘missing’ studies for analyses on this specific defect.
Discussion
Main findings
Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed a 23%
increased risk of any major congenital malformations
and a 28% increased risk of major cardiac malformations
associated with paroxetine exposure during the first tri-
mester of pregnancy. This risk of major congenital
malformations increased to 42% when only case–control
studies were considered, to 69% in studies that followed
up infants for ascertaining outcomes less than 1 year af-
ter birth and to 49% when clinic or surveillance data were
linked to registry. The risk of major cardiac malformations
increased to 51% when only case–control studies were
considered and to 62% when teratogen information ser-
vices were used as a data source. The use of paroxetine
during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated
with a two-fold increased risk of atrial septal defects
and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction compared
with non-use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Although there
was a clear overall increase in the risk of major and car-
diac malformations overall, these findings highlight the
influence of different aspects of the study design, the
data source used, and the exposure and outcome time
window of ascertainment when studying the use of anti-
depressant drugs during pregnancy and the risk of major
congenital malformations.
The risk of any major malformations or cardiac
malformations differs according to the comparison
group used. In our meta-analysis, the highest risk esti-
mates were obtained when the comparator included
women exposed to a non-paroxetine antidepressant,
hence women who might be treated with other SSRIs
or other antidepressants. These studies are therefore
adjusting for the indication per design. The most used

antidepressant. Although choice of comparator group
varied the risk estimate, it remains that there was a gen-
eral trend towards increase in risk.
Comparison with existing reviews
The
increases
in
the
risk
of
major
and
cardiac
malformations in this meta-analysis coincide with earlier
meta-analyses. Indeed, initial meta-analyses conducted
in 2007 and 2010 [38, 63], reported pooled risk estimates
for cardiac malformations of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.22, 2.42) [63]
and 1.46 (95% CI 1.17, 1.82) [38]. The most recent meta-
analysis conducted by Myles et al. [40] estimated the risk
of cardiac malformations in association with paroxetine
use during pregnancy to be 1.44 (95% CI 1.12, 1.86).
Our meta-analysis included subsequently published
studies with significantly larger population sizes, with
data originating from different countries such as the UK
and Australia [16, 42, 48, 50]. The 28% increased risk of
major cardiac malformations in our meta-analysis is con-
cordant with the 44% increased risk of major cardiac
malformations following paroxetine use obtained from
a previous meta-analysis [40]. The adjustment for publi-
cation bias did not change our conclusion on the risk of
any major congenital malformations and major cardiac
malformations.
Effect of methodological parameters on risk
estimates
Restricting findings according to different data sources
showed higher risk estimates in studies using teratogen
information services, and lower estimates in studies
using administrative and claims data sources, which is
important in interpreting findings from studies. Potential
bias from information services may exist, as mothers who
feel the need to call and enquire may be more likely to be
at higher risk than those who have no concerns. In addi-
tion there is a risk of recall bias. Many of the claims data-
bases estimated the start of the first trimester and
subsequent exposure by using algorithms based on the
delivery date to backdate to time of conception, poten-
tially leading to exposure misclassification. Indeed, this
is not as accurate as using ultrasound and the date of
the last menstrual period, which is used in sources linked
to registries and hospital records [28]. In addition, the risk
was lower in the pooled estimate of studies that reported
time to ascertainment of defect to be less than 1 year.
This factor is particularly important in defects such as
atrial septal defects, which can remain undetected until
later on in life.
Previous literature emphasizes the need to correct for
confounding by indication (i.e. to separate the effects of
depression from the potential effect of paroxetine). In or-
der to address the potential confounding by indication
(effect of depression on the risk estimates), we restricted
our analyses to include studies that used women
diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety in their com-
parison group. This was further limited to include studies
with depressed women unexposed to any antidepres-
sant in the comparison group. Although this had an im-
pact on the estimates, it did not change the overall
finding of an increased risk. This can be explained by
the fact that the majority of studies already adjust for
maternal depression in their multivariate analyses.
Clinical implications
In practice, the main question that physicians are faced
with when treating depressed women during pregnancy
is whether the risk to the fetus after continuing antide-
pressant therapy, such as paroxetine, is lower or greater
than the risk associated with the depression itself or to
the risk from other similar treatments (other SSRIs or an-
tidepressants). Due to changes in metabolism during
pregnancy, SSRIs are often cleared from the body at a
faster rate and hence the concentration of paroxetine
in the blood may be reduced to below the therapeutic
optimum [64, 65]. In addition, given that pregnant
women usually decrease or maintain pre-pregnancy dos-
age during gestation, it is hypothesized that antidepres-
sants, and paroxetine specifically, put mothers and
unborn children at greater risks, which is highlighted in
this meta-analysis.
Strengthens and limitations
We carried out several sub-analyses in order to con-
sider different aspects of study designs and data
sources that may influence study results. Although var-
iations in estimates were seen depending on the pop-
ulations, study designs and comparator groups, it
remained that there was a constant trend in showing
an increasing risk of major malformation and cardiac
malformations.
We
also
performed
a
sub-analysis,
which used only adjusted estimates, as malformations
have several risk factors. However, some prevalence
of specific defects are small and thus are more difficult
to study, partly explaining why they are less likely to
be reported in individual studies.
Conclusions
Paroxetine is associated with a significantly increased risk
of major malformations, and cardiac malformations spe-
cifically cardiac septal and atrial septal defects, and right
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Studies consisting
of a depressed cohort or comparing paroxetine exposure
to clinically depressed unexposed pregnant women
showed similar risk estimates. Few studies controlled
for indication by using depressed non-treated women
in the comparison group but the majority took into ac-
count maternal depression in the multivariate analyses.
Our meta-analysis is novel because it includes up to date

 findings, and mostly because it has studied the effect of
methodological choices on the reported outcome and
adjusted pooled estimates for publication bias. Given
the increased metabolism during gestation and thus
the decrease of benefit at comparable dosage, it is
believed that paroxetine bears more risks than benefits
when used during organogenesis. The baseline risk of
major malformations is 3% and of cardiac malformations
is 1%. However, given that the benefit of using these
medications during pregnancy is debatable, any increase
in risk is significant. Hence, regardless of the size of the
risk, it is essential to disseminate these findings given
that they should be used to change practice and impact
appropriate antidepressant use during pregnancy.
