Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Ministry of Food (MoF) cooking
programme on self-reported food consumption and confidence with cooking.
Design: A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the MoF 8-week cooking
course, using a pre-test/post-test study. Pre, post and 6-month follow-up
quantitative outcomes were measured using self-administered questionnaires to
record number of portions of fruit and vegetables (F&V) consumed per day,
number of snacks consumed per day and participants’ cooking confidence levels
(highest score of 5). Qualitative evaluations were undertaken using structured
telephone interviews.
Setting: MoF centre in Leeds Kirkgate Market, UK.
Subjects: Adults (n 795, 43 % male) on MoF courses from 2010 to 2014, 462 of
whom completed questionnaires at all three time points.
Results: Six months after the course, self-reported F&V intake increased
significantly by 1·5 (95 % CI 1·3, 1·6, P < 0·001) portions per day to 4·1 (95 % CI
4·0, 4·3). The number of snacks reported decreased significantly over the same
period by −0·9 (CI − 1·0, −0·8, P < 0·001) snacks per day. Cooking confidence
increased over the same period by 1·7 (95 % CI 1·6, 1·9, P < 0·001) to 4·4 (CI 4·4,
4·5). Age and disability, but not deprivation or ethnicity, were associated with
changes in self-reported F&V intake and cooking confidence scores at 6 months;
and gender with the latter outcome. Qualitative results supported quantitative
findings and revealed specific beneficial gains in cooking skills/preparation,
nutritional awareness, food purchasing and other social benefits.
Conclusions: MoF community-based cooking interventions can have significant
positive effects on dietary behaviour, food choice and cooking confidence.

Healthy eating
Over recent years, a number of campaigns have been
developed in the UK aimed at improving the national diet
by encouraging behavioural changes in society(1). Among
these
strategies
are
the
‘Choosing
a
Better
Diet’
framework(2), the ‘Food Matters’ policy(3) and the ‘Public
Health Responsibility Deal’(4). Despite these campaigns,
average fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, a marker of a
healthy diet, remains below recommended levels(5), with
only 26 % of adults report eating five or more portions
per day in 2013 compared with 28 % in 2005(6). Moreover,
the percentage of overweight and obese adults remains
high and has increased between 2005 and 2013 from 60·5
to 62·1 %(6).
In the UK there has been a decline in cooking culture
since the 1950s: home-made meals have been replaced
with ready meals and convenience foods resulting in a
decrease in cooking skills(7–9). Lack of cooking skills has
been associated with poor diet and increased consump-
tion of highly processed and energy-dense convenience
foods of reduced nutritional quality(10–12). Furthermore,
high consumption of ready meals is associated with being
overweight(10). Cooking skills are considered to be a major
predictor of healthier food choices and the ability to cook
in the home(7,12).
Previous UK government policy has focused primarily
on increasing consumer knowledge about healthy eating;
however, individuals are likely to require practical skills to
utilise this knowledge. Within public health nutrition,
‘culinary nutrition’ is a newly established approach which
combines aspects of nutritional principles with cooking

 and culinary knowledge in the form of cooking interven-
tions(13). These programmes typically involve small groups
of participants attending weekly practical sessions over a
period of 4–10 weeks with main objectives to increase
awareness of healthy nutrition and to increase cooking
skills and confidence levels. These practical interventions
provide ‘hands-on’ experience that can lead to improved
dietary intake and increased food literacy(14).
Sociodemographic status and household income can
influence food purchasing decisions and dietary intake;
households of lower income often have poor diets and are
at greater risk of diet-related disease(15,16). In the UK,
low-income populations consume diets lower in F&V, oily
fish and micronutrients such as vitamin C, folate, Fe and
Ca than those in the highest income quintile(5). Those from
the lowest socio-economic levels are least likely to be
confident with cooking(17). By increasing food literacy,
teaching better budgeting techniques and efficient food
shopping strategies, and providing accessible information
and skills to prepare healthy meals at a low cost, cooking
interventions may help overcome economic barriers that
presently prevent healthy eating(18–20).
In 2008, Jamie Oliver, a celebrity chef, introduced a
network of local food centres in the UK providing 8- to
10-week cooking courses aimed to educate individuals
from lower socio-economic groups on cooking skills while
incorporating simple nutritional messages. Named ‘Jamie’s
Ministry of Food’, the campaign aims to eliminate common
misconceptions and economic barriers, where the classes
teach individuals how to prepare quick, healthy and low-
cost home-cooked family meals, using fresh ingredients.
The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the
impact of the Jamie Oliver Ministry of Food cooking course
among individuals who attended the Leeds Kirkgate Market
centre from 2010 to 2014, in relation to changes in F&V and
snacks consumed and confidence in cooking.
Methods
Ministry of Food cooking course
In 2010 a Ministry of Food (MoF) centre was established in
Leeds, UK. The MoF centre is a fully fitted domestic
kitchen fitted within a stall in Leeds Kirkgate Market. The
food centre offers cooking courses which are open to all,
but have the aim of teaching those with no or limited
cooking skills how to prepare tasty, healthy meals on a
budget. Service users attend the centre once per week
over 8 weeks for 90 min per session, to learn a range of
cooking skills and a variety of recipes which will teach
them progressive cooking skills that they can then use to
cook a range of meals for themselves and their families.
Participants pay between £4·50 and £7·50 per session,
based on their individual circumstances. The reduced rate
applies to participants who are students or on means-
tested benefits. Each cooking session promotes a key
healthy eating message to educate service users on a wide
range of healthy eating messages from understanding food
labels to reducing salt, fat and sugar. Specific attention is
given within the course to highlight the importance of the
‘Eatwell plate’ (now replaced by the ‘Eatwell Guide’),
developed by the Department of Health, stressing the
importance of staple food items and portion control to
achieve
dietary
balance.
The
course
includes
the
relevance of government dietary guidelines and differ-
ences in dietary requirements within different age groups
of the public and vulnerable populations. The basis of the
MoF was developed around outcomes from several
nutritional studies including the Healthy Weight, Healthy
Lives consumer insight report(21).
Study participants
The MoF cooking course was advertised in a number of
ways to attract participants: directly in Leeds Kirkgate
Market; on Jamie Oliver’s website; by Zest Health for Life
publicity; within third-sector organisations; through media
coverage; and also via information leaflets distributed by
Leeds City Council. The MoF received a substantial number
of referrals from other organisations including support
organisations for those with financial and social deprivation,
weight-management problems, addictions, physical impair-
ment, learning difficulties and mental health problems. From
July 2010 to March 2014, 1210 adults over 16 years old
enrolled in the MoF cooking intervention and were asked to
self-complete quantitative questionnaires. These participants
were also asked to complete questionnaires directly after the
8-week course and then 6 months after the course. Indivi-
duals who gave consent to be contacted up to 1 year after
the course to participate in experience-focused interviews
were later contacted by telephone for interview.
Design
In the current study the impact of the MoF courses, run
from 2010 to 2014, on short- and long-term dietary beha-
viour was investigated using a pre-test/post-test design.
Due to the absence of a control group, the effectiveness of
the MoF cooking intervention was measured using mixed
methods including both quantitative and qualitative eva-
luations. The evaluations were based on self-reported data.
Quantitative evaluation
The effectiveness of the MoF course was evaluated by
assessing the change in self-reported number of portions
of F&V consumed per day (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 + ); the
change in the self-reported number of snacks consumed
per day (0 to 7 + ); and the change in participants’ self-
reported confidence in cooking a healthy meal (0 to 5;
0 being ‘not confident at all’ and 5 being ‘very confident’).
This was determined by comparing responses to the self-
completed questionnaires before the course with those
immediately after the course and also with responses
3418
J Hutchinson et al.
 6 months after the course. The questionnaires included
examples for a portion of F&V (‘Example one handful =
one portion’) and for snacks (‘Examples include: cake,
biscuits, crisps, etc.’).
As part of the MoF evaluation all participants were asked
to complete a general background questionnaire, issued
before the beginning of the course. This included self-
reported postal code (used to measure deprivation), age
group, ethnicity, gender, and whether the participant con-
sidered he/she has a limiting disability, a long-term illness or
a condition that limits; categorised by Learning Disabilities,
Physical Impairment and Mental Health Problems.
Qualitative evaluation
A structured interview consisting of ten questions (see
online supplementary material) was prepared based on
specific aims of the MoF and a discussion with a health
improvement specialist working within public health.
Establishing contact with the participant was tried three
times on three different non-consecutive days to maximise
response. Each telephone interview was initiated with a
brief introduction by the interviewer (J.W.) and an expla-
nation of the purpose and procedure of the telephone call.
Each telephone interview lasted for 15 to 30 min and
included questions about cooking skills learned; healthy
eating knowledge learned; if members felt they had
improved portion control; confidence in cooking; whether
they enjoyed working as a group and meeting new
people; changes in eating habits since the course; and
what members thought was best about this course and
what could be improved. Open-ended questions were
asked and responses were recorded in order to obtain
details of the participant’s experiences at the MoF.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative analysis
All questionnaire data were analysed using the statistical
software package Stata version 13. Student’s paired t tests
were used to determine whether there were statistically
significant changes between before and immediately after
the MoF course (and also between before and 6 months
after the course for those who completed this follow-up
questionnaire) in the mean number of self-reported
portions of F&V consumed per day, the mean number of
self-reported snacks consumed per day and the mean
change in participants’ self-reported cooking confidence
levels. In the analyses the ‘7 + ’ responses were counted as
‘7’; this avoided exaggerated responses becoming outliers.
Only 1–3 % of participants reported they ate seven or more
portions of fruit and vegetables daily and only 1 % of
participants ate seven or more snacks daily. A significance
level of less than 0·05 was taken to represent statistical
significance for all analyses.
For MoF participants who completed the questionnaires
at all three data collection time points, multivariate
regression analyses were undertaken to determine whe-
ther changes in self-reported F&V intake, snack intake and
cooking confidence scores between before and 6 months
after the course were independently associated with the
sociodemographic
factors.
All
five
sociodemographic
variables were included in the multivariate regression
for each outcome, meaning results were adjusted for
all variables. These were age group (16–19, 20–64, 65 +
years), ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, mixed race, other),
gender, presence of a disability (no difficulties, learning
disabilities, mental health problems, physical impairment,
multiple disabilities, other disabilities) and deprivation
(deprived
Leeds
residents,
non-deprived
Leeds
residents, living outside Leeds or had non-mappable
postcodes (note: 7 % of participants had non-mappable
postcodes for the purpose of classifying deprivation;
about
half
appeared
to
be
Leeds
postal
districts).
Individuals were categorised as deprived if they lived at
postcodes in Leeds that were classified in the top tenth of
deprivation in England using the Index of Multiple
Deprivation (2015). All small areas in England (of about
1000–3000 people) are mapped to postcodes which
can be ranked according to their Index of Multiple
Deprivation score, a relative level of overall deprivation
based on deprivation scores for income, employment,
health, education, crime, access to services and living
environment.
Qualitative analysis
Demographic information, including disability, gender,
age and ethnicity, were obtained within each individual
interview to provide a background for the interviews. The
answers to each question of the interview were recorded
and manually typed as the interviews occurred, in order to
document and analyse exact individual responses. The
data were analysed in a deductive fashion using constant
comparative narrative analysis, previously adopted by
Symon and Wrieden(22).
Data
from
transcripts
were
reviewed
alongside
demographic information and re-occurring themes among
participants were identified. This method was then used
to establish a coding framework for each individual
question (see online supplementary material for questions
and framework used). Specific steps of qualitative data
analysis included: (i) a review of interview data and
arrangement of the data into different categories, incor-
porating demographic background information; (ii) the
classification of clear emerging common trends using
quotations to support general findings; and (iii) the
comparison of data and themes among different demo-
graphic groups.
Qualitative data analysis and management were carried
out
using
Microsoft®
Excel
and
Word;

 Results
Quantitative analyses
Of 1210 who attended the MoF course between 2010 and
2014,
795
individuals
completed
both
the
baseline
questionnaire and the questionnaire issued immediately
after the course (a response rate of 66 %). Of these parti-
cipants, 85 % were white, 57 % were female, 24 % came
from a deprived area in Leeds (which were in the top 10 %
deprived areas in England, i.e. 2·4 times more deprived
individuals than the national average were recruited on to
the course), 81 % were aged 20–64 years, 9 % were over 65
years and 9 % were under 20 years, 63 % of participants
did not report a disability, 7 % had multiple disabilities,
15 % had learning difficulties, 8 % had mental health
problems and 5 % had physical disabilities only (Table 1).
Of the total participants, 462 completed the 6-month
follow up questionnaire (a follow-up response rate of
58 %). As observed in Table 1, their characteristics were
similar to those of the full set of participants, except that
there was a greater proportion who reported no dis-
abilities (69 %).
The results of the t tests in Table 2 show there were
significant increases in daily F&V consumption and
cooking confidence levels and a significant decrease in the
frequency
of
snacks
consumed
(P < 0·001)
between
before the course and immediately after the course. Larger
increase for these outcomes occurred from before the
course to 6 months after the course for the subset who
completed the follow-on questionnaires, and these results
were all statistically significant (P < 0·001). The increase in
self-reported daily intake of F&V portions doubled from
0·7 (95 % CI 0·6, 0·8) immediately after the course to 1·5
(95 % CI 1·3, 1·6) six months after the course. Similarly, the
decrease in self-reported daily intake of snacks doubled
from −0·4 (95 % CI −0·2, −0·5) immediately after the course
to −0·9 (95 % CI −0·8, −1·0) at 6-month follow-up. A large
increase was observed in participant’s cooking confidence
levels (a self-reported score between 0 and 5, 5 being very
confident); this increased immediately after the course by
1·4, (95 % CI 1·3, 1·6) and the total increase after 6 months
was a little higher at 1·7 (95 % CI 1·6, 1·9). The differences
between immediately after the course and 6 months later
were all statistically significant (P < 0·001).
The multivariate regression analyses in Table 3 show
changes between before the start to 6 months after the
course by sociodemographic factors. As observed, there
were no associations between changes in any of the
three nutrition outcomes and deprivation or ethnicity.
There were also no associations between change in
self-reported snack intake and any sociodemographic
variables. The increase in self-reported F&V intake was
associated with age and disability: younger adults had a
significantly smaller increase than the age group 20–64
years (−0·60 (95 % CI −1·00, −0·10) portions/d, P = 0·02)
and those with physical impairments had a smaller change
than those with no disabilities (−0·69 (95 % CI −1·32,
−0·07) portions/d, P = 0·03). Males reported a greater
increase in cooking confidence scores at 6 months after
the course than females (0·29 (95 % CI 0·04, 0·55) increase,
P = 0·03) and those aged 16–19 years or 65 years and
above had smaller increases than 20–64-year-olds (−0·57
(95 % CI −1·02, −0·13), P = 0·01 and −0·46 (95 % CI −0·89,
−0·04), P = 0·03, respectively). Compared with participants
with no disabilities, those with learning disabilities repor-
ted significantly smaller increases in cooking confidence
scores 6 months after the course (−0·62 (95 % CI −1·02,
−0·22), P = 0·002).
Qualitative analyses
Forty individuals were successfully contacted and com-
pleted the telephone interview. The characteristics of this
group were different from those participating in the
quantitative research: 73 % (n 29) were white, 63 % (n 25)
were female, 75 % (n 30) were under 60 years of age, 53 %
(n 21) came from a deprived area in Leeds and 68 % (n 27)
did not report a disability.

 Acquisition of cooking skills
Results across the range of participants showed that they
finished the MoF programme with various cooking and
preparation skills, including skills using knives, preparing
vegetables, seasoning food and aspects within food
hygiene:
‘It’s taught us both how to improve the quality of
food using seasoning.’
‘I can now make simple meals with less ingredients
and know how to stop cross contamination.’
The most valuable aspect of the course for participants
from deprived areas of Leeds appeared to be learning new
recipes and ways to cook from scratch (i.e. from basic
ingredients).
Increased nutrition knowledge
A large proportion of participants claimed to have
improved knowledge on healthy eating, being more aware
of F&V nutritional value and the health consequences of
saturated fat. Most participants from deprived areas in
Leeds learned healthier ways to cook including using less
oil and fat, with just under half of individuals gaining
knowledge about the value of fresh ingredients. Those
from non-deprived areas tended to learn more about
nutritional value of healthy food and substitutions for
unhealthy foods such as sauces. Discovering healthy
alternatives for high-fat foods also appeared to be
particularly present among those aged over 65 years.
Within the fifteen males interviewed, most claimed to gain
nutritional knowledge, learn the value of healthy food,
healthier ways to cook and how to read labelling of food
unhealthy ingredients:
‘They teach you how to check food labelling and
how to avoid excess salt and fat.’
‘More awareness of nutritional value and I learned
more about the 5-a-day campaign.’
‘I add very little fat and oil now, whereas previously
I thought fat made food delicious.’
Interviews
also
revealed
many
participants
made
several changes within eating and cooking habits. For
example, all but one participant living in deprived areas of
Leeds claimed to have made changes, with most changes
being eating more healthily, cooking from scratch and
using less fat and oil. Within non-deprived areas 25 %
claimed to have not changed eating and cooking habits,
due to factors such as age, experience and already eating
healthily prior to the course. Among all participants, only
one male participant reported maintaining the same eating
habits, with the remaining participants claiming to eat and
cook more healthily. A specific finding was that attending
the
MoF
demonstrations
appeared
to

 self-reported intake of frozen, processed and takeaway
foods high in fat:
‘Yes definitely, we don’t eat ready meals anymore
and myself and my dad don’t get takeaways now, we
made our own pizzas because they showed us how.’
Within portion control participant feedback was varied.
Among those over 65 years old, the majority of participants
claimed the MoF course helped portion control, including
learning how to cook batch portions, reduce wastage and
how to correctly portion macronutrient groups. It was also
suggested that portion knowledge helped older individuals
cope with changes in household numbers, for instance
when children grow up and leave home:
‘Yeah portion control definitely. I’ve got three chil-
dren but they’ve all left home, so now I know how
to cook for myself and not to make too much, which
is helping with my weight.’
‘Yeah I learned what should be on your plate, so
I learned how much should be carbohydrate, protein
and fat, and the right plate size.’
Additionally, the cooking course appeared to help
parents distinguish between portion sizes within the
family, for example the difference and correct portion
sizes for children and adults. Many participants who
attended the course mentioned the ‘Eatwell plate’; how-
ever, portion control was not found to be improved for
everyone with some individuals claiming to still ‘struggle’
with portion size.
There was also an increase in awareness of shopping
costs, budgeting and a greater awareness of healthy food
access within Leeds market. Many participants claimed to
visit the market more, having an increased awareness of
the healthy food available to them:
‘Yes I do because they gave us a tour and told us
about a fish stall, so I now get my fish there and
organic eggs, vegetables and fresh spices.’
Confidence and social aspects
The
majority
of
the
interviewees
claimed
to
have
improved confidence in cooking, with just 15 % stating no
improvements due to being confident previously. In par-
ticular, through an increase in confidence, some members
attending the MoF were found to cope better with illness
and disability, for example:
‘Yes, it really did because that was one of the big
things I couldn’t cope with before. Because I’m
disabled, preparing food was something I’ve always
struggled with and never really done before. So
starting off on the cooker at the hob was really useful
and means I’m more confident at home.’
In addition to confidence, most individuals declared
other social benefits; for example, participants suffering
from disabilities and living in deprivation saw a clear
decrease in social isolation:
‘Yes before the Ministry of Food I wouldn’t really
start conversations with people because I’m really
shy. But by going there I learnt how to speak for
myself and now I socialise more.’ (Male aged 20–64
years, deprived Leeds area, learning difficulties and
mental health problems)
‘It got me out of the flat. I’m disabled so that was
always a fear and I’d just stay in before.’ (Female
aged 20–64 years, deprived Leeds area, physical
impairment and mental health problems).
Within the MoF structure all but four participants claimed to
enjoy working as a group and meeting new people:
‘Of course one of the participants hardly spoke to
anyone, but after a few lessons he started talking and
chatting so it has a social value to break an isolation
barrier, talking about cooking and enhancing social
aspects and the teachers were so energetic and
social, they presented a feeling of relaxation and
they made you want to talk.’ (African male, aged
20–64 years, deprived Leeds area)
‘Yes I do because I had only recently moved to
Leeds and I got the email from the MoF, and it was
really beneficial because it got me out and about and
meant I met loads of new people.’ (White female,
aged over 65 years, non-deprived Leeds area)
Suggested course improvements
All forty interviewees spoke positively about their MoF
experience. Suggestions to improve the course were
clustered mainly within wanting more recipes, advanced
sessions, longer and flexible timings. Of participants from
deprived areas of Leeds, 50 % stated no improvements were
needed and others suggested more recipes, dessert options
and longer sessions. Among those from non-deprived
areas, many people would have liked a more advanced
class and found the course ‘too basic’; however, 25 % of
those from non-deprived Leeds suggested no changes.
Discussion
Despite the focus on recruiting deprived groups for the
intervention, the baseline response to the questionnaire
was 66 %. This is a good response for such a relatively
hard-to-reach group(23).
Dietary changes, nutrition knowledge and
cooking skills
Results from the current study present the effectiveness of
the MoF community-based cooking programme for facil-
itating
medium-term
changes
in
dietary
behaviour.
Ministry of Food cooking programme evaluation
3423
 Quantitative analysis revealed that after the MoF course
there was a significant increase in self-reported portions of
5-a-day F&V consumed and a decrease in snacks con-
sumed. These positive changes emerged immediately
following the course and had increased further by
6 months after the course. This suggests that the MoF
programme may encourage short-term changes in dietary
behaviour which can be maintained and improve over
longer periods of time. The course did not produce
inequalities in dietary changes by deprivation; however,
participants under 20 years of age showed smaller
increases in self-reported F&V intake. Many interviewed in
the current study said they now cook more from scratch
and
consume
less
frozen
food,
ready
meals
and
takeaways. The results from the current study appear to be
consistent with the Australian MoF intervention which had
a similarly large sample(24) and a recent Scottish cooking
programme by the National Health Service(20). In these
two studies cooking from basic ingredients and cooking
confidence increased, the number of takeaway or ready
meals reduced and the intake of F&V increased after the
intervention(20,24). There were also significant differences
between the intervention group and the waiting-list con-
trol group in the Australian study for all but fruit and ready
meal intake(24). Some differences in the intervention group
remained at the further follow-up; however, there was
little change in self-reported vegetable intake between
post-intervention and follow-up(20,24). The increases in
outcome between post-intervention and 6-month follow-
up in our study may reflect the MoF ethos from Jamie
Oliver about passing on skills learnt or it could be a result
of response bias. Our qualitative and quantitative results,
combined, suggest that learning ‘hands-on’ cooking skills
while being educated about diet and health in an informal
group atmosphere may reduce barriers that prevent
dietary change.
Both participants from deprived areas and those from
non-deprived areas stated in the interviews that the MoF
taught them new aspects about nutrition. The qualitative
results of the study also suggest that the cooking education
provided
could
increase
the
ability
to
control
and
differentiate between healthy and unhealthy ingredients
and portion sizes of food. This outcome may offer
advantages within health and weight management, and
may support individuals who are managing long-term
conditions like obesity or diabetes(25).
The cost of healthy foods has been perceived to be a
barrier to the consumption of a healthful diet among
individuals with low income(26,27). In the UK, access to
supermarkets remains extremely high(28) and supermarkets
have successfully used a variety of marketing strategies
promoting the purchase of energy-dense, extra value
convenience foods, which may be partly responsible for
the UK’s current health and social inequality gap(29). Results
from the current study, also the MoF intervention evaluated
in
Australia(30)
and
other
cooking
interventions(31,32)
suggest new knowledge and practical skills acquired can
substantially influence food purchasing decisions, helping
to overcome detrimental perceptions and influences that
are current barriers to heathy eating. Through the con-
venient location of the UK MoF, and the market tours that
are provided by partner organisations, the MoF increased
the awareness and accessibility of affordable healthy
ingredients.
Confidence and social benefits
The confidence to cook has been shown to be a major
predictor of dietary intake, where a lack of confidence can
make an individual less likely to purchase F&V(32). Our
evaluation did not measure changes in purchasing patterns
and whether this was linked to cooking confidence.
However, the quantitative results show that cooking
confidence increased dramatically following the 8-week
MoF course and was maintained at 6 months after the
course, providing both short- and medium-term benefits.
While only one question was used in our study, four to five
questions assessing cooking confidence were used in the
Australia MoF and Scottish studies, and significant increases
were observed for all questions after the intervention, but
these did not increase further at the follow-up(24).
The results of the interviews in our study also provide
evidence of increases in general confidence as well as
cooking confidence. Confidence gains were particularly
valued among those from deprived areas, those suffering
from disabilities and individuals aged over 65 years.
Although some with disabilities reported benefiting from
reduced social isolation, the quantitative results showed
that participants specifically with learning difficulties
reported smaller increases in cooking confidence than
others. Nevertheless, from the interviews, it appeared that
staff interaction and group atmosphere enhanced learning
ability and confidence levels of participants with few prior
skills and low literacy levels who may struggle to follow
formal
instructions.
General
increases
in
confidence
following the MoF may be due to both the acquisition of
culinary skills and knowledge, and the numerous social
benefits offered within the course resulting from a relaxed,
enthusiastic group atmosphere. Collectively, the commu-
nity interaction and skill acquisition of the MoF may
provide a mechanism to increase self-value. This impor-
tant finding is supported by Foley et al.(33), where group
dynamics were seen to encourage community discussions
while increasing the trust and confidence to share advice
and life experiences.
Cooking interventions have tended to primarily target
females, rather than males, in the household; in a
systematic review of UK cooking interventions over half of
the studies (7/13) focused on all or a very high proportion
of women(34). In comparison, the proportion of males
attracted to the current study was relatively high; it is
possible that this may be due to the Jamie Oliver branding.
Despite
the
majority
of
women
sharing
working
3424
J Hutchinson et al.
 responsibilities within couples, a considerably higher
proportion of women than men are still responsible for
food preparation in the UK(17,35). Not surprisingly, men
report being less confident at cooking than women(17).
Within the quantitative results of the current study, the male
participants reported significantly greater increases in
cooking confidence, while interviews revealed an increase
in nutritional awareness, home-made cooking, enjoyment
in cooking and confidence in males. The recent nationally
representative UK nutrition survey also found that young
people (19–34 years) have less confidence with cooking
than other age groups in the UK(17); therefore they have
more scope for improvement. However, in our study,
younger people (16–19 years) improved in confidence less
than
20–64-year-olds.
Additionally
their
F&V
intake
improved less than 20–64-year-olds’. This indicates that
interventions targeting age-specific groups may be more
appropriate.
Limitations
The present study adopted a pre-test/post-test design,
focusing on a single treatment group with no control
group, unlike the Australian MoF intervention which had a
non-randomised waiting-list control group(24,36). Leeds
City Council wanted to ensure public health targets were
met by maximising numbers on the intervention and did
not want a waiting-list control; the study was not intended
to be a trial. However, lack of randomisation to a control
group means that measured differences between the pre-
and post-questionnaire responses cannot be causally
related to the intervention. The self-selecting nature of the
participants in our study is also a limitation; these indivi-
duals may be more health conscious than those who did
not apply to the course or follow up a referral from other
organisations. Similarly, recent systematic reviews con-
cluded that the evidence on the effectiveness of cooking
courses for adults is limited because of limitations of the
study designs(14,34). Only five out of the thirteen UK
studies reviewed used a control group and only one of
these randomised participants(34). That was a study of
individuals aged 65 years or older in sheltered housing in
socially deprived areas(37), these results therefore may not
be relevant to other groups. The findings of a recent pilot
study to determine the feasibility of evaluating the MoF in
the UK using a randomised controlled trial methodology to
recruit those most in need of cooking skills suggest it is
feasible using community recruitment(38).
Another limitation of the current and many other studies
in
the
reviews
is
that
dietary
intake
and
cooking
confidence were self-reported and therefore prone to
reporting bias. Within the qualitative analysis interviewees
may have failed to remember important aspects of the MoF
course they attended up to a year before. Furthermore, we
assumed reported snacks were unhealthy, and although
unhealthy snacks were given as an example, we did not
provide guidelines on the questionnaires about whether
fruits or other health foods should be included as snacks.
Additionally, qualitative results may have been limited by a
sample size of forty participants, and it may have been
difficult
to
contact
individuals
suffering
from
severe
disabilities due to poor communication skills. Nevertheless,
quantitative findings in our study are supported by the
qualitative
results
and
are
consistent
with
previous
literature; however, in order to increase confidence and
imply causality, a further study incorporating a control
group would be necessary.
As suggested by participants, the course might be
improved by including more recipes and longer and
flexible course timings. Although the latter may make the
course accessible by more people, it may not be feasible.
While some individuals, especially from non-deprived
areas, wanted advanced classes, it is important to offer the
basic course as provided for the majority with lower
confidence in cooking. As previously suggested, a booster
class could be offered later to help sustain the intervention
effects(20,24) and teaching more advanced skills and
recipes could be part of this.
Future implications
Cooking interventions are designed to increase the ability
to cook and the consumption of healthy home-prepared
meals and nutritional knowledge among those who attend.
In the current study, the MoF demonstrated the ability of
cooking programmes to increase cooking confidence,
culinary skills and effect positive dietary changes while also
offering a wider range of social outcomes, including an
increase in self-efficacy, personal control and general
confidence in adults. This suggests that the incorporation of
community-based cooking interventions such as the MoF’s
as part of government strategy may present an effective
mechanism to facilitate positive dietary changes without
widening socio-economic inequalities. However, to con-
firm this further, studies incorporating a control group and
participant randomisation are required.
