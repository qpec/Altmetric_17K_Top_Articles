Abstract
The combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone has recently emerged as a potential adjunctive
therapy to antibiotics, infectious source control, and supportive care for patients with sepsis and septic shock. In the
present manuscript, we provide a comprehensive review of the pathophysiologic basis and supporting research for
each element of the thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone drug combination in sepsis. In addition, we
describe potential areas of synergy between these therapies and discuss the strengths/weaknesses of the two
studies to date which have evaluated the drug combination in patients with severe infection. Finally, we describe
the current state of current clinical practice as it relates to the thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone
combination and present an overview of the randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Ascorbic acid,
Corticosteroids, and Thiamine in Sepsis (ACTS) trial and other planned/ongoing randomized clinical trials.
Keywords: Thiamine, Ascorbic acid, Corticosteroids, Metabolic resuscitation, Sepsis
Background
Sepsis is a common and highly morbid condition with an es-
timated 1.7 million cases occurring in the United States each
year, resulting in over 270,000 deaths [1]. Despite advances
in critical care practices, sepsis remains the most common
cause of death in non-cardiac intensive care units (ICUs)
[2, 3]. Even among sepsis patients who survive their hos-
pital stay, residual organ dysfunction requiring ongoing
treatment after discharge is common [4]. Despite this high
level of mortality and morbidity, antibiotics and source
control remain the only focused therapies for this condi-
tion [5]. In a small, retrospective observational study of
septic ICU patients, the combination of thiamine (200 mg
every 12 h), ascorbic acid (1500 mg every 6 h), and
hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 h) was associated with a
dramatic improvement in organ injury, time to shock
reversal, and mortality as compared to historical controls
at the same hospital [6]. Each component of this combin-
ation of therapies has been recently evaluated individually
in septic shock patients. A prior pilot randomized trial
found that the provision of thiamine to septic shock pa-
tients with elevated lactate attenuated organ dysfunction
(particularly renal dysfunction) and reduced lactate levels
and potentially mortality in those patients with baseline
thiamine deficiency [7, 8]. In addition, two small random-
ized trials of ascorbic acid vs placebo in sepsis have dem-
onstrated improved clinical outcomes [9, 10]. Finally,
while there have been mixed results with respect to the
benefit of corticosteroids in septic shock generally
[11, 12], the addition of corticosteroids to ascorbic
acid may have a synergistic effect [6, 13–15].
In the present article, we review the biologic basis for
and existing data supporting the use of thiamine, ascorbic
acid, and corticosteroids in sepsis. We discuss the use of
this drug combination in current clinical practice and the
rationale for the currently enrolling Ascorbic Acid, Corti-
costeroids, and Thiamine in Sepsis (ACTS) trial, as well as
other clinical trials addressing this question.

 Organ dysfunction in sepsis
The traditional paradigm of organ dysfunction in sepsis
has focused on decreased systemic vascular resistance
resulting in decreased organ perfusion, and ultimately im-
paired oxygen delivery [16–18]. Numerous studies, how-
ever, have shown that organ dysfunction can occur during
sepsis and septic shock even in the absence of decreased
perfusion [19–21]. Notably, histopathologic analyses of or-
gans following death from sepsis often fail to demonstrate
any substantial amount of ischemic injury, but rather re-
veal remarkably preserved parenchyma or a predominant
pattern of apoptosis, suggesting alternative mechanisms of
organ dysfunction apart from hypoperfusion and inde-
pendent of cellular oxygen delivery [21–23]. A number of
such mechanisms have been proposed and include mito-
chondrial dysfunction with resultant bioenergetic failure, a
direct effect of the immune response to infection (related
to pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular
patterns), microvascular abnormalities, endothelial dys-
function, and inter-organ cross-talk [24, 25].
Thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids
The current management of sepsis and septic shock largely
focuses on improving oxygen delivery via a combination of
intravenous fluid and vasoactive medications while treating
the infection with antibiotics and source control [5]. The
combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids
has been suggested as a potential adjunctive therapy tar-
geted at non-oxygen delivery-dependent mechanisms of
organ dysfunction (see Fig. 1 for a summary of suggested
mechanisms).
Thiamine
Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin that is
a key component of a number of cellular metabolic
processes. In its phosphorylated form, thiamine pyro-
phosphate, thiamine acts as a cofactor for pyruvate de-
hydrogenase,
the
enzyme
necessary
for
converting
pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A for entry into the Krebs
cycle. When thiamine levels are insufficient, pyruvate is
unable to be converted to acetyl coenzyme A, resulting
in impaired aerobic respiration and a compulsory shift
to the anaerobic pathway, resulting in elevated serum
lactate levels [26–28]. Thiamine also plays a role in the
metabolism of branched-chain amino acids and is a crit-
ical component of the pentose phosphate pathway,
which is essential for the generation of NADPH and
therefore glutathione cycling, an important anti-oxidant
pathway [29–31]. A thiamine deficiency syndrome, beri-
beri, bears a number of similarities to sepsis, including
peripheral vasodilation, cardiac dysfunction, and elevated
lactate levels [29].

 Thiamine deficiency is not rare in critically ill popula-
tions and may be associated with increased mortality in
some cases [7, 29, 32, 33]. Further, thiamine levels are
depleted during the course of critical illness and the
administration of thiamine during critical illness may
improve organ dysfunction [34–36]. In a mouse model
of cardiac arrest, the provision of thiamine improved
mitochondrial function, reduced histologic signs of brain
injury, and improved neurologic outcomes [37]. In a
canine model of septic shock, thiamine pyrophosphate
improved lactate clearance, oxygen consumption, and
arterial pressure irrespective of thiamine deficiency sta-
tus [38]. In the only randomized trial of thiamine in hu-
man
septic
shock,
88
patients
were
selected
for
increased risk of symptomatic thiamine deficiency based
on a serum lactate > 3 mmol/L after volume resuscita-
tion. In that study, there was no effect overall of
thiamine on the primary outcome of median lactate level
at 24 h, though there was a statistically significant differ-
ence when evaluating lactate levels at serial timepoints
in the first 72 h. In a pre-defined subgroup of patients
with thiamine deficiency (35% of the cohort), however,
the administration of thiamine reduced lactate levels and
improved mortality [7]. In a post hoc analysis of that
study, patients without baseline end-stage renal disease
who were given thiamine had better renal outcomes
than those randomized to placebo [8]. Thiamine supple-
mentation has not been shown to be associated with sig-
nificant adverse effects, even at high doses [39]. Overall,
these results suggest a role for thiamine supplementation
as a low-risk and potentially high reward intervention
for some patients with septic shock and increased base-
line risk of thiamine deficiency.
Ascorbic acid
Like thiamine, ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin es-
sential for a number of processes in the human body. As an
anti-oxidant, ascorbic acid is an electron donor that directly
scavenges free radicals, prevents the generation of new free
radicals through its suppressive effects on the NADPH oxi-
dase (NOX) pathway, and assists in the recycling of other
anti-oxidants [40–42]. The anti-oxidant effect of ascorbic
acid results in reduced endothelial permeability, improved
microvascular and macrovascular function, and attenuated
cellular apoptosis in pathological states [41, 43, 44]. In
addition, ascorbic acid has a number of effects on the im-
mune system, including regulation of macrophage function,
reduction of inflammatory mediators, and even a direct
bacteriostatic effect at high concentrations [45–47]. Lastly,
ascorbic acid is essential in the generation of endogenous
vasopressors and may be important in maintaining vascular
vasopressor responsiveness [41, 48].
Prior studies have found that plasma and cellular levels
of ascorbic acid decline rapidly during critical illness
[49–51]. Similar to thiamine, ascorbic acid deficiency syn-
drome (scurvy) bears a number of similarities to sepsis, in-
cluding malaise, coagulation abnormalities, and endothelial
wall breakdown [49]. While interest in ascorbic acid for the
management of critical illness has recently been reinvigo-
rated, it is not new. The potential benefit of ascorbic acid
for reducing resuscitation fluid requirements in burn pa-
tients and organ dysfunction in critically ill surgical patients
was suggested over a decade ago [52, 53]. More recently,
small randomized trials in sepsis have shown promise. In
one study, 24 septic patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ra-
tio to receive high dose ascorbic acid (200 mg/kg), low dose
ascorbic acid (50 mg/kg), or placebo. In that study, no ad-
verse effects were related to the ascorbic acid and patients
who received ascorbic acid had more rapid reduction in
measures of organ injury, inflammation, and procalcitonin.
There also appeared to be a dose–response relationship,
with patients who received higher dose ascorbic acid having
more rapid clinical improvement [9]. In a more recent
study, 28 patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock
were randomized to 25 mg/kg of ascorbic acid every 6 h or
placebo [10]. Those in the ascorbic acid arm required lower
vasopressor doses and had lower mortality.
While the high doses of ascorbic acid given in the above
clinical studies were not associated with any identified
harms specific to the drug, one theoretical concern regard-
ing the routine use of ascorbic acid in sepsis is the potential
for increased oxalate excretion and the development of ox-
alate renal calculi [54]. Thiamine pyrophosphate is a key
co-enzyme necessary for the function of glyoxylate amino-
transferase, which catalyzes the breakdown of glyoxalate to
carbon dioxide instead of oxalate. Thiamine deficiency
states, therefore, may predispose to increased oxalate excre-
tion [54, 55]. It should be further noted that short-term,
intravenous ascorbic acid—even at high doses—has not
been found to increase the risk of renal calculi in controlled
trials to date [41, 43]. Other potential adverse effects of
vitamin C include abdominal pain/bloating, increased iron
absorption, hemolysis in patients with G6PD enzyme defi-
ciency, and false negative results on fecal occult blood test-
ing [56]. At very high doses, ascorbic acid may act as a
pro-oxidant, although this has not been found to be the pri-
mary effect in vivo [41, 57]. Finally, high doses of ascorbic
acid may falsely elevate glucose level readings when mea-
sured with certain point-of-care glucometers employing
glucose dehydrogenase-pyrroloquinoline quinone ampero-
metric methods [58].
Corticosteroids and ascorbic acid
A number of large, randomized trials have assessed the
added benefit of corticosteroids when included as part of
general septic shock management. These studies have
generally shown corticosteroids to improve various clinical
outcomes in septic shock (e.g., time to shock reversal,
Moskowitz et al. Critical Care          (2018) 22:283 
Page 3 of 7
 ventilator-free days), but there have been mixed results with
respect to mortality [59–62]. Whether the routine adminis-
tration of hydrocortisone to patients with septic shock
should be standard remains a matter of debate [11, 12].
The biologic basis for the inclusion of hydrocortisone in
the drug combination, however, is based on potential synergy
between ascorbic acid and hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoid
binding to glucocorticoid receptors is negatively affected by
oxidizing molecules. This may be reversed by the administra-
tion of ascorbic acid, which has been shown to restore gluco-
corticoid receptor function [13]. The cellular uptake of
ascorbic acid is mediated by the sodium-vitamin C trans-
porter (SVCT2), which is downregulated during inflamma-
tory states. The administration of glucocorticoids has been
shown to increase expression of the transporter [14, 15]. In a
study examining the barrier function of human lung micro-
vascular epithelial cells, the combination of ascorbic acid and
hydrocortisone showed a synergistic barrier-protective effect
after lipopolysaccharide exposure—above the combined
effect of either agent when given alone [15].
Thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids
The combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticoste-
roids has been studied in two, single center, before-and-after
cohort studies [6, 63]. In addition to the above-referenced
study by Marik et al., a recent study performed in South
Korea compared 53 patients with severe pneumonia admit-
ted to the ICU who received the thiamine, ascorbic acid,
and hydrocortisone combination to historical controls. In
that study, patients who received the thiamine, ascorbic acid,
and hydrocortisone combination had a substantial mortality
benefit (adjusted odds ratio 0.15, 95% CI 0.04–0.56). Al-
though there were baseline imbalances in the ‘control’ and
‘treatment’ groups wherein patients in the ‘treatment’ group
were more likely to have been receiving vasopressor and
renal replacement therapy, the mortality benefit persisted
after propensity-adjustment and propensity-matching. While
these studies were the first to explore the drug combination
in severe infection, their observational methodology, inclu-
sion of non-consecutive and non-concurrent ‘control’ arms,
small sample sizes, and single center nature represent sig-
nificant limitations and preclude broad conclusions regard-
ing the efficacy of this drug combination in sepsis.
Ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine for
the treatment of sepsis in current practice
As detailed above, scientific support for various elements of
the thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone drug com-
bination has existed for decades. Enthusiasm for this drug
combination in sepsis has grown rapidly since 2016 due to
the aforementioned paper by Marik et al. and the signifi-
cant exposure it has received in both specialty medical
blogs and the lay press [64–68]. Reactions in specialty med-
ical blogs were mixed, with some physicians supporting the
incorporation of the ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and
thiamine drug combination into routine sepsis manage-
ment [66] and others arguing for more rigorous testing of
the drug combination [67, 68]. Arguments for more imme-
diate uptake include the perceived low risk and relatively
low cost of the intervention, biologic plausibility, and sup-
port from present literature, within the limitations that they
represent. Arguments against include a long history of
promising sepsis interventions that failed more rigorous
scientific testing (e.g., activated protein C [69]), the un-
known safety profile of high-dose ascorbic acid in critically
ill populations (and in combination with corticosteroids
and thiamine), and a general concern regarding the
generalizability of results from single center observational
studies. At present, our discussions with critical care
leaders at a number of academic and community centers
have found that practice patterns are mixed, with some
clinicians opting for routine administration of the drug
combination, others only administering the drug combin-
ation in sepsis patients who are decompensating despite
traditional management, and others who do not adminis-
ter the drug combination at all.
The Ascorbic Acid, Corticosteroids, and Thiamine in
Sepsis (ACTS) trial and other ongoing clinical trials
The lack of adequate data exemplified by mixed practice
patterns suggests a state of scientific equipoise has devel-
oped regarding the risk/benefit ratio of the routine adminis-
tration of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in
sepsis. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to as-
sess the effect of this drug combination on clinically import-
ant outcomes in sepsis. As of July 1st, 2018, a review of the
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Program (which includes clinicaltrials.gov) revealed
nine ongoing or planned clinical trials of ascorbic acid, corti-
costeroids, and thiamine in six different countries (Table 1).
These trials differ somewhat with respect to study popula-
tions (septic shock only vs sepsis or septic shock), control
group interventions (the VITAMINS trial using hydrocorti-
sone and the remainder choosing saline placebo), and pri-
mary outcomes, but all explore the intervention and daily
doses proposed in the study by Marik et al [6]. Of note, the
Vitamin C Infusion for Treatment in Sepsis Induced Acute
Lung Injury (Citrus-ALI), a 170-patient trial of 200 mg/kg/
day of ascorbic acid vs placebo in sepsis-induced acute lung
injury, has completed enrollment, although results of this
study are not yet available.
Our study, the Ascorbic Acid, Corticosteroids, and
Thiamine in Sepsis (ACTS) Trial is a multi-center random-
ized clinical trial in the United States aimed at assessing the
effect of the drug combination on organ function and other
outcomes in septic shock. The ACTS trial is coordinated by
the Center for Resuscitation Science at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, MA, USA and is
Moskowitz et al. Critical Care          (2018) 22:283

 currently enrolling. The trial is supported by the Open Phil-
anthropy Project (https://www.openphilanthropy.org/). Pa-
tients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive thiamine
(100 mg), ascorbic acid (1500 mg), and hydrocortisone
(50 mg) or matching placebo four times daily for 4 days.
The primary outcome is change in the Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from baseline to 72 h,
with key secondary outcomes including the incidence of
renal failure and 30-day mortality. The primary outcome of
72-h SOFA score was selected to reflect the anticipated
beneficial effects of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticoste-
roids on organ function. As organ dysfunction is a defining
element of sepsis and a major determinant of survival, this
outcome is patient centered and the attenuation of organ
dysfunction may be practice changing. Further, the SOFA
score can be measured early in a patient’s hospital course
and is therefore less impacted by downstream elements of
hospital care than overall mortality.
The ACTS trial, in combination with the other trials de-
scribed above, may provide important validation of the re-
sults found by Marik et al. Should those results be replicated,
the potential benefit in terms of lives saved world-wide annu-
ally from sepsis could be measured in the hundreds of thou-
sands. Even if the results from Marik et al. are not replicated,
the ACTS trial and other trials of thiamine, ascorbic acid,
and corticosteroids will provide important scientific data re-
garding the effect of metabolic resuscitation in sepsis that
may guide future studies in this area. Given concerns about
reproducibility in science [70], replication of results in differ-
ent patient populations is crucial to demonstrating a true,
generalizable effect. The multiple ongoing trials testing this
drug combination creates a rare scenario in critical care
medicine research where multiple, independent investigators
are exploring the effects of a single intervention in unique
patient cohorts. Further, a prospectively planned patient-level
metanalysis combining data from the ACTS trial and the
VICTAS trial would provide increased power and an ability
to better explore the effect of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and
hydrocortisone in certain patient subgroups [71].
Conclusions
The combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticoste-
roids is a promising new therapy for sepsis resuscitation
but currently lacks robust evidence to support its wide-
spread use. The potential effectiveness of this medication
combination is rooted in biologic plausibility and supported
by small clinical trials of the various individual components.
Randomized data to confirm or refute the observational
evidence for the drug combination are needed, and several
clinical trials are ongoing or planned in the near future. We
therefore anticipate a timely answer to the question of
whether thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids will
play a role in the evolution of sepsis therapies.
