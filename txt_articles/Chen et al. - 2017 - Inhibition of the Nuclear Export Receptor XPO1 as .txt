Abstract
Purpose: The high fatality-to-case ratio of ovarian cancer is
directly related to platinum resistance. Exportin-1 (XPO1) is a
nuclear exporter that mediates nuclear export of multiple tumor
suppressors. We investigated possible clinicopathologic correla-
tions of XPO1 expression levels and evaluated the efficacy of
XPO1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in platinum-sensitive
and -resistant ovarian cancer.
Experimental Design: XPO1 expression levels were analyzed to
define clinicopathologic correlates using both TCGA/GEO data-
sets and tissue microarrays (TMA). The effect of XPO1 inhibition,
using the small-molecule inhibitors KPT-185 and KPT-330 (seli-
nexor) alone or in combination with a platinum agent on cell
viability, apoptosis, and the transcriptome was tested in immor-
talized and patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines (PDCL) and
platinum-resistant mice (PDX). Seven patients with late-stage,
recurrent, and heavily pretreated ovarian cancer were treated with
an oral XPO1 inhibitor.
Results: XPO1 RNA overexpression and protein nuclear
localization were correlated with decreased survival and plat-
inum resistance in ovarian cancer. Targeted XPO1 inhibition
decreased cell viability and synergistically restored platinum
sensitivity in both immortalized ovarian cancer cells and
PDCL. The XPO1 inhibitor–mediated apoptosis occurred
through both p53-dependent and p53-independent signaling
pathways. Selinexor treatment, alone and in combination with
platinum, markedly decreased tumor growth and prolonged
survival in platinum-resistant PDX and mice. In selinexor-
treated patients, tumor growth was halted in 3 of 5 patients,
including one with a partial response, and was safely tolerated
by all.
Conclusions: Taken together, these results provide evidence
that XPO1 inhibition represents a new therapeutic strategy for
overcoming platinum resistance in women with ovarian cancer.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal reproductive tract malignancy
in the United States, with over 22,000 cases and approximately
16,000 deaths annually (1). The high fatality-to-case ratio of
ovarian cancer is directly related to the fact that most patients
will develop resistance to platinum chemotherapy and eventually
will die from their disease (2). New therapeutic targets and/or
treatments restoring platinum sensitivity are urgently needed.
Nuclear–cytoplasmic transport plays a crucial role in maintain-
ing normal cellular function (3), and defects in this process have
been increasingly identified in solid and hematologic cancers
(4, 5). One of the key nuclear transport proteins is exportin 1
(ref. 6; XPO1; also known as chromosomal regional maintenance
1, CRM1; Supplementary Fig. S1). XPO1, one of eight known
nuclear exporters, regulates the nuclear–cytoplasmic partitioning
of a number of nuclear export sequence (NES) containing tumor
suppressors, cell-cycle inhibitors, and oncogenes (7–9). XPO1
overexpression has been suggested to be a general feature of

 cellular transformation (9) and has been observed in a number of
hematologic and solid tumors (9–13), including ovarian cancer
(10). Most relevant to this study, XPO1 is the only known
transporter for a number of well-characterized ovarian cancer–
associated proteins, including p53 (11–12), BRCA1 (13), IkBa
(14), KLF6 (15), sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as p62),
and PP2A (CIP2A) (16), all of which play roles in ovarian cancer
initiation, cell-cycle progression, the DNA damage response,
apoptosis, autophagy, and chemoresistance. Therefore, XPO1
seems an excellent ovarian cancer therapeutic target.
Targeted inhibition of XPO1 with leptomycin B (LMB), a
naturally occurring XPO1 inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces
bacteria, yields antitumor responses in a number of different
hematologic and solid tumor models, but within a very narrow
therapeutic index (9, 17, 18). Unfortunately, LMB's off-target
effects render it inappropriate for therapeutic use (17, 19). Given
these constraints and therapeutic potential, a number of different
classes of Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE) have been
synthesized and are being evaluated for therapeutic efficacy (4, 5,
20). KPT-185 and KPT-330 (generic name: selinexor) represent
two SINE compounds that potently, selectively, and covalently
inhibit XPO1. Although these molecules bind to the same reactive
Cys528 residue that LMB binds (17, 21), they do so in a slowly
reversible fashion (21), improving their selectivity and reducing
their off-target effects (22, 23). An ester moiety on KPT-185
precludes its oral bioavailability and conscripts it to in vitro use
(21), while an amide moiety on KPT-330 is associated with
excellent bioavailability in all species tested. Both SINE com-
pounds have demonstrated antitumor activity in a number of
different cancer types (22–28).
Herein, we characterize the antitumor efficacy of SINE com-
pound–mediated XPO1 inhibition as well as the efficacy of
these agents in the context of ovarian cancer. These agents
decreased ovarian cancer proliferation and tumor growth, acted
synergistically with cisplatin (a platinum-based chemothera-
peutic agent) to induce apoptosis, and increased survival in two
complementary ovarian cancer mouse models. Moreover, the
results of oral XPO1 inhibition in heavily pretreated patients
with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients dem-
onstrated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the XPO1
inhibitor selinexor. Our study therefore provides the rationale
for the therapeutic strategy of targeting a critical protein in the
nuclear transport receptor complex in platinum-resistant ovar-
ian cancer.
Materials and Methods
Patients, specimen collection, and patient-derived cell lines
Ovarian cancer tumor samples were collected, with patient
consent, at the time of surgery at a single institution under an
IRB-approved protocol. Following examination in pathology for
confirmation and staging, tumor tissue sections were generated
and used for establishing patient-derived cell lines and generating
xenograft mouse models. Patient-derived cell lines were estab-
lished based upon a previously published protocol (29).
Tissue microarray and immunofluorescence
Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed from 56 patholo-
gist-selected, 1.0-mm tumor cores of formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) ovarian cancer specimens (Beecher Instru-
ments) in triplicate. All were patient samples of the Mount Sinai
Hospital. Eighty-three percent of the samples were serous ovarian
cancer, and all of these were defined as high grade (grades 2 and
3). In brief, TMA sections were immunostained with the XPO1
antibody SC-5595 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using the Bench-
mark XT (Ventana/Roche) with the UltraVIEW Universal DAB
Detection Kit (Ventana/Roche). Isotype rabbit IgG1 was used as a
negative control. The intensity of the XPO1 immunostaining in
tumor cells was evaluated independently and then overseen by a
senior pathologist (M. Donovan). All readers were blinded to
patient outcomes. Intensity, percent positivity, and cellular local-
ization (i.e., nuclear and cytoplasm) were analyzed for each core,
with a calculated H-score [% positivity (0–100) multiplied by
intensity (1–3þ), maximum 300] determined for each core. Cut-
off points were derived on the basis of maximizing sensitivity and
specificity for predicting the outcomes. FFPE OVCAR3 cells were
used as a positive control. Normal ovary, fallopian tube, and
endometrial tissues, incorporated into the arrays, were evaluated
as negative tissue controls along with whole sections of normal
colon tissue, normal testis, and normal lung during XPO1 devel-
opment assays.
For immunofluorescence studies, cells were first plated on
coverslips. At designated time points, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized on ice with 0.5% Triton X-
100 (Sigma) or 90% methanol for 10 minutes. After incubation
with primary and secondary antibodies, cells were counterstained
with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted with
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired and
analyzed using the Axion plan software on a Zeiss Axion micro-
scope (Zeiss).
Antibodies
Anti-XPO1 (H-300), anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-lamin A/C (N-18),
anti-GAPDH, and anti-NF-kB p65 were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti-cleaved caspases 8 (Asp391), -9 (Asp330),
and -3 (Asp175), anti-cleaved-PARP (Asp214), anti-phospho-p53
(Ser15), anti-Erk1/2, anti-phospho-p44/42 Erk1/2 (Thr202/
Tyr204), anti-Bcl-xL, anti-IkBa, anti-phospho-p65 (Ser536), and
anti-cIAP1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
Translational Relevance
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal female reproductive
tract malignancy worldwide. Although most patients appear
to respond to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy,
in reality, most of these women will have a recurrence of
chemoresistant disease, with a 5-year survival of only
approximately 30%. Here we show that overexpression of
the nuclear exporter protein XPO1 correlates with worse
survival and platinum resistance. Targeted inhibition of
XPO1, using the small-molecule XPO1 inhibitors KPT-
185 and KPT-330, results in apoptosis and synergistic cell
death when used in combination with platinum, even in
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and PDX mice.
Patients with late-stage, recurrent, and heavily pretreated
ovarian cancer were treated with single-agent KPT-330.
Tumor growth was halted in 3 of 5 patients, including 1
with a partial response. Together, these results provide
evidence for XPO1 inhibition as a novel paradigm in over-
coming platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.

 Cell culture and reagents
The ovarian cancer cell lines A2780, CP70, OVCAR3, and
SKOV3 were purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. Immortalized human normal fal-
lopian tube epithelial cell line FT33-shp53-R24C was purchased
from Applied Biological Materials Inc (ABM) and cultured in
Prigrow IV Medium with 10% FBS in PriCoat T25 Flasks (ABM).
Human fibroblast cell lines IMR-90 and Wi-38 were purchased
from ATCC and cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM)
with 10% FBS. Human fibroblast cell lines AG060062 and
GM17071A were maintained in our laboratory (30). KPT-185
and KPT-330 were provided by Karyopharm Therapeutics. DMSO
was used as the diluent control for all in vitro studies. All cell-based
experiments were repeated a minimum of three times.
MTT assay and evaluation of drug interaction
The cell proliferation reagent 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was used to evaluate cell
viability. Viability was measured using the following formula:
relative
viability
¼
(experimental
absorbance�background
absorbance)/(untreated controls absorbance�background absor-
bance) � 100%. The IC50 values of cisplatin and KPT-185 at which
the proliferation was reduced by 50% compared with the untreat-
ed control were calculated using nonlinear regression (GraphPad
Prism v3.0, GraphPad software). Drug synergy analysis was per-
formed using Chou–Talalay's isobolographic method (31) and
combination index (CI) was calculated using CalcuSyn software
suite (Biosoft). If CI < 1, the drugs act synergistically; if CI ¼ or > 1,
the drug interaction is defined as additive or antagonistic,
respectively.
Ovarian cancer mouse models
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee (IACUC) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
(New York, NY). For these models, 6- week-old female Rag1
knockout mice (C.129S7(B6)-Rag1<tm1Mom>/J) and Balb/c
nude mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.
Patient-derived ovarian cancer xenograft mouse models (PDX)
Ovarian cancer tissue collected at the time of surgery was
minced into pieces approximately 1.5 mm3 in size and implanted
into the flanks of Rag1�/� mice. Once tumors developed in mice, a
representative section from each cohort was harvested and sent for
pathology review. Paired genomic DNA was isolated from the
patient's original tumor and the mouse xenotransplant and p53
and BRCA genes were sequenced using a custom-targeted gene
panel (Ion Torrent, Life Technologies).
When PDX tumor volume (V ¼ L�W2�0.5, L ¼ longest
diameter, W ¼ shortest diameter) reached approximately 125
mm3, KPT-330 (10 mg/kg) was delivered three times per week via
oral gavage. Mice with tumors >1,000 mm3 were euthanized as
per IACUC regulations. All mice were observed until 120 days
after treatment, at which time the experiments were terminated.
CP70 mouse model (CP70-OvCaX)
luciferase-expressing CP70 cells (1�106) were injected intra-
peritoneally into nude mice. One week after tumor cell injection,
tumor engraftment was confirmed by bioluminescence (BLI)
using the IVIS Spectrum Pre-clinical In Vivo Imaging System
(PerkinElmer), as we have described previously (32). Tumor-
bearing mice were randomly assigned to four different treatment
regimens: vehicle control, cisplatin alone (2.5 mg/kg, twice/
week), KPT-330 alone (15 mg/kg, twice/week), and combination
treatment with cisplatin and KPT-330. Tumor growth was mon-
itored twice/week. For all tumor tissues harvested, paraffin sec-
tions were prepared for immunohistochemical staining and
TUNEL assay.
Phase I clinical trial
A multicenter phase I clinical trial was performed to assess the
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of selinexor (KPT-330) in late-
stage, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. Approval was
obtained from the respective Institutional Review Boards at
participating sites. Patients were eligible for study participation
if they met the following criteria: 18 years of age or older, had
ovarian cancer resistant or refractory to standard therapy, an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG
PS) <2, and measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). In addition, adequate
renal, hepatic, and hematologic functions were required. Patients
received single-agent treatment with 30–35 mg/m2 oral KPT-330
2–3 times weekly (8–10 doses/4-week cycle). Response was
evaluated every 2 cycles (RECIST 1.1). Dose-limiting toxicity was
defined as events occurring in the first 28 days at the target dose.
These events included: severe nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and
fatigue lasting >5 days, hematologic toxicities, and liver/renal
function abnormalities. Treatment could be discontinued in the
event of dose-limiting toxicities, and dose modifications second-
ary to toxicities were not allowed. Information regarding the
statistical design of the overall phase I study is available (33).
Statistical analysis
Significant differences between groups were determined using
the Student t test. Survival data analysis was performed using the
Kaplan–Meier and log-rank tests (GraphPad Prism software v5.0).
Results
XPO1 overexpression and nuclear localization are correlated
with decreased survival and platinum resistance
In seeking to gain an understanding of the potential value of
XPO1 as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, we first analyzed
in silico the correlation between XPO1 RNA expression levels
and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in
ovarian cancer using the largest independent, multicenter high-
grade ovarian cancer sample dataset available. Using the cBIO
Cancer Genomics Portal (34), we interrogated all 489 cases
analyzed by Agilent expression chips and the 261 cases that
have associated RNASeq data. With an overexpression cutoff of
1.2 SDs above the mean, XPO1 was found to be overexpressed
in 24% of the Agilent data cases and in 27% of the RNASeq data
cases. Across all of the RNASeq data, XPO1 overexpression was
associated both with worse OS (P ¼ 0.029) and PFS (P ¼ 0.01;
Supplementary Table S1).
We next used Kaplan–Meier plotter (35) to further explore the
association between XPO1 overexpression and survival using
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and TCGA datasets. Again we
focused exclusively on high-grade serous ovarian cancer and
included only those individuals treated with a platinum agent
as platinum agents are the gold-standard treatment for primary
disease. Because surgical debulking status remains one of the most

 significant contributors to overall survival (36), we first analyzed
all patients together regardless of debulking status and then
independently examined those with optimal and suboptimal
(defined as >1 cm of residual tumor following surgery) debulking
following surgery). An association with overall survival was
present in patients regardless of their debulking status (P ¼
0.048). In suboptimally debulked patients, XPO1 overexpression
was associated both with worse PFS [P ¼ 0.048; HR ¼ 1.45; 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.0–2.1] and OS (P ¼ 0.0213; HR ¼ 1.57;
95% CI, 1.07–2.31; Fig. 1A, left and right, respectively). We
furthermore limited our analysis to the subset of patients with
suboptimal surgical debulking defined as >1 cm of residual tumor
following surgery. In these patients, XPO1 overexpression was
associated both with worse PFS (P ¼ 0.048; HR ¼ 1.45; 95% CI,
1.0–2.1) and OS (P ¼ 0.0213; HR ¼ 1.57; 95% CI 1.07–2.31; Fig.
1A, left and right, respectively).
We next directly quantified XPO1 protein levels and subcellular
localization to complement the RNA-based, in silico analyses.
First, we examined XPO1 expression in four well-characterized
and frequently studied immortalized ovarian cancer cell lines
(A2780, CP70, OVCAR3, and SKOV3) and compared these
expression levels with other ovarian- and non-ovarian–derived
cell lines. Western blot analysis demonstrated consistently higher
levels of XPO1 expression in the four ovarian cancer cell lines
compared with noncancerous ovarian surface epithelial cells
(IOSE527), a fallopian tube cell line (FT33-shp53-R24C), and
four fibroblast cell lines (IMR-90, Wi-38, AG060062, and
GM17071A; Fig. 1B).
Finally, we quantitated and localized XPO1 protein levels in
situ across a wide range of patient-derived ovarian cancer tissues
using a tissue microarray (TMA) representing patient samples
from individuals treated at our institution. We analyzed sam-
ples from 56 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer
representing 143 evaluable cores (Supplementary Table S2).
Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were analyzed independent-
ly. XPO1 expression levels ranged from low (30%, 1þ cyto-
plasmic staining; left) to high (90%, 3þ nuclear and cyto-
plasmic; right) across the sample set (Fig. 1C, left and right).
Clinically relevant clinicopathologic associations were identi-
fied (37) based on XPO1 expression levels and nuclear versus
cytoplasmic distribution. Increased nuclear XPO1 expression
correlated with shorter 5-year PFS (concordance index of 0.40,
HR ¼ 2.0, cut-off point 90, P < 0.003; Fig. 1D) and with
platinum resistance (score ¼ 0.227; scale of �1 to þ1). A
correlation with overall survival was also present but was
weaker (concordance index of 0.44; not shown). Conversely,
XPO1 cytoplasmic staining was positively correlated (score
0.262; scale of �1 to þ1) with those patients who were
survivors including those who were with no evidence of disease
(NED) and alive-with-disease (AWD). There was a statistically

vivors versus those who had died of their disease (P ¼ 0.0042).
KPT-185 selectively inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis even in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells
Having established these associations, we next investigated the
anticancer efficacy of XPO1 inhibition, particularly in the context
of platinum resistance. We first examined the effects of the XPO1
inhibitor KPT-185 on cisplatin-sensitive A2780 cells, A2780-
derived cisplatin-resistant CP70 cells (38), and cisplatin-resistant
OVCAR3 (39)and SKOV3 (40) cells. Submicromolar KPT-185
concentrations significantly inhibited growth of all cell lines (Fig.
2A). The IC50s in these cell lines ranged from 46.53 nmol/L to
328.7 nmol/L. Selinexor, with a similar molecular weight as KPT-
185, achieves serum levels >1.5 mmol/L at doses below the MTD in
patients with cancer, indicating that these concentrations are
clinically relevant. In marked contrast, and highlighting a spec-
ificity for the cancer-derived cell lines, a KPT-185 concentration of
4,000 nmol/L failed to kill noncancerous IOSE527 cells and
concentrations greater than 10,000 nmol/L did not have a demon-
strable toxic effect on the other noncancerous cell lines tested (Fig.
2A). We further corroborated this finding of an increased cancer
cell sensitivity by testing the effect of KPT-185 on patient-derived
primary tumor cells versus patient-derived benign cells. Forty-four
patient-derived high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell
lines and 6 patient-derived benign ovarian cell lines were tested.
While the HGSOC-derived cell lines had an average IC50 of 3.2
mmol/L, the average IC50 for the benign cell lines (19.1 mmol/L)
was nearly six times greater (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Taken together, these findings in both the immortalized and
Figure 2.
KPT-185 demonstrates antitumor activity selectively in cancer cell lines regardless of p53 status and acts synergistically with cisplatin. A, Treatment of the four
ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780/CP70 (p53 WT), OVCAR3 (p53 mutated), and SKOV3 (p53 null) and six noncancerous cell lines with different concentrations of
KPT-185 for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and each IC50 calculated as shown in the table beneath the graph. All experiments were performed in
triplicate and repeated three times. Results are shown as SD�SE. B, KPT-185 treatment for 48 hours of CP70, OVCAR3, and SKOV3 results in apoptosis,
which can be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, and treatment results in (C) increased cleaved PARP (C-PARP), and caspases 3, 8, and 9 (C-caspase 3, 8,

 patient-derived cell lines are in accord with previous findings that
40 mmol/L of KPT-185 or related SINEs are not toxic to normal
lymphocytes, bone marrow cells, primary hepatocytes, and other
normal cells (25, 26). Finally, and given that many of the com-
monly used ovarian cancer cell lines do not share the same genetic
profiles of native tumors, most notably that unlike tumors, the cell
lines are TP53 wild-type, we also investigated the efficacy of KPT-
185 in patient-derived primary ovarian cancer cell lines. In addi-
tion to testing the efficacy of KPT-185 in the above forty-four
patient-derived cells, primary tumor cell lines derived from 17
different ovarian cancer patients with either primary or recurrent
disease and platinum-sensitive and -resistant tumors (Supple-
mentary Table S3) were treated with KPT-185. Regardless of
platinum or other chemotherapy resistance status, all patient-
derived ovarian cancer cell lines were significantly growth inhib-
ited by KPT-185 (Fig. 2F, red line).
To determine the mechanism of KPT-185–mediated decrease in
cell viability, we first determined the degree of cell-cycle arrest in
each cell line. While KPT-185 treatment resulted in G1 phase arrest
in A2780 cells (P ¼ 0.006) no significant degree of arrest was
noted for CP70, OVCAR3, or SKOV3 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3). In these latter three cell lines, we next quantitated the degree
of apoptosis induction. All three cell lines initiated apoptosis
following KPT-185 treatment and apoptosis could be almost
completely blocked by the use of the antiapoptotic agent Z-
VAD-FMK (Fig. 2B). KPT-185 treatment resulted in marked
increases in caspases 3, -8, and -9, as well as PARP cleavage (Fig.
2C), suggesting activation of the apoptotic cascade through both
the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
KPT-185 acts synergistically with platinum to increase
chemosensitivity independent of cellular p53 status
Because platinum resistance is the foremost obstacle to long-
term successful ovarian cancer treatment, we explored the effect of
combining SINEs and cisplatin. While the well-studied isogenic
ovarian cancer lines A2780 and CP70 were originally derived to
study cisplatin resistance differences, they are both p53 WT. In
contrast, nearly 100% of late-stage serous ovarian cancer tumors
are deficient for p53 or possess a mutated p53 (41). Thus, for
clinical relevance, SINE compounds must be effective even in p53-
mutated/deficient tumor cells. We determined the effect of
increasing concentrations of cisplatin alone or in combination
with KPT-185 on cell viability in the four immortalized ovarian
cancer cell lines and also the set of patient-derived ovarian cancer
cell lines, which were established from both platinum-sensitive
and -resistant tumors, as described above.
Regardless of p53 status, KPT-185 enhanced the efficacy of
cisplatin in all cell lines (Fig. 2D–F). In cisplatin-resistant CP70
cells, combinatorial treatment resulted in an IC50 similar to that of
the isogenic cisplatin-sensitive parent line (A2780), indicating an
increase in platinum sensitivity (Fig. 2D and E). The combination
index (CI) was calculated to determine the degree of synergy. KPT-
185 and cisplatin were shown to be synergistic as demonstrated by
their low CI values at all concentrations explored (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Isobologram analysis revealed that the combination of
drugs was consistent with a synergistic, not simply additive effect.
The CI in the immortalized cell lines ranged from 0.51 to 0.69.
Synergy between KPT-185 and cisplatin was also demonstrated
in all the patient-derived cell lines that were tested (Fig. 2F). Even
doses as low as 500 nmol/L of KPT-185, an average IC25 dose,
effectively lowered cisplatin IC50 levels, on average, >4-fold
(13.53 mmol/L vs. 3.15 mmol/L; Fig. 2F). The combined CI value
was 0.55, indicating synergy between these two drugs.
SINE compounds induce apoptosis through p53-dependent
and independent pathways
As described above, KPT-185 effectively induced apoptosis in
all the ovarian cancer cell lines tested regardless of their p53 status.
This together with the role of p53 in apoptosis and as a recognized
XPO1 cargo protein (7) led us to explore whether the mechanisms
of SINE-induced apoptosis could be mediated through both p53-
dependent and independent pathways.
We first examined the effect of KPT-185 treatment on the p53
wild-type (WT) CP70 cell line. p53 nuclear accumulation and
upregulated expression were readily apparent following KPT-185
treatment (Fig. 3A, left and 3B). Increased phospho-p53 (Ser15)
expression was confirmed via Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C).
Previous studies have demonstrated that the Ras–Raf–ERK sig-
naling cascade functionally interacts with p53 activation in apo-
ptosis (42); therefore, we also investigated the degree, if any, of
ERK1/2 activation. After KPT-185 treatment, phosphorylated
ERK1/2 levels increased in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). The use of the
highly selective p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-alpha (PFT-a; ref. 27)
suppressed phosphorylated-ERK1/2 expression (Fig. 3C), consis-
tently increased Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 3C, bottom), and
decreased apoptosis (Fig. 3D). We also examined the effect of
targeted p53 knockdown using siRNA. CP70 cells were transfected
with either p53 siRNA or control scrambled siRNA (scRNA) and
cells treated with KPT-185 (Supplementary Fig. S5). The effect of
p53 loss on apoptosis was then measured by FACS analysis. While
treatment with KPT-185 in a p53 WT background resulted in
>25% apoptosis, silencing p53 markedly blocked this response
such that cell death was essentially at the background levels
observed in the control cells. Together, these findings provide
evidence for p53-dependent SINE-mediated ERK1/2 activation,
suggesting that in CP70 cells, ERK1/2 is a downstream regulator of
p53 during KPT-185–mediated apoptosis.
As an independent method to confirm the role of p53 in the
response of CP70 cells to KPT-185, and do so in an agnostic
manner, we performed a whole-genome RNA analysis. CP70 cells
treated with KPT-185 were compared with sham-treated cells and
total RNA isolated and interrogated by microarray (Illumina,
HumanHT12, v4 Expression BeadChip). The Upstream Regulator
Analysis (URA) of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to
identify the predicted state (activation/inhibition) and cascade of
upstream transcriptional regulators that could explain observed
gene expression changes following KPT-185 treatment. In total,
more than 20 activated pathways were identified. The most
activated pathway in this analysis was p53. The activation Z-score
was 3.5, and P value, 1.67E�05. The p53 network (i.e., p53
downstream targets) and its direction of activation are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S6.
In contrast, we hypothesized that during p53-independent
apoptosis, in ovarian cancer cells with inactive or mutated p53,
the proapoptotic effect of KPT-185 could be mediated by an
alteration of the NF-kB prosurvival pathway. This was based on
the complementary findings that: (i) NF-kB suppresses pro-
grammed cell death and promotes tumor growth (43), (ii) NF-
kB activity can be downregulated by XPO1 inhibition in mantle
cell lymphoma (23), and (iii) NF-kB has been linked to ovarian
cancer (44). In untreated SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells, NF-kB p65
and IkBa were abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm. KPT-185

 treatment altered this subcellular localization such that nuclear
accumulation of IkBa and p65 was readily apparent (Fig. 4A
and B) with concomitant slight decreases of their cytoplasmic
expression. As an indication of suppressed NF-kB activity, KPT-
185 treatment reduced phosphorylated p65 levels with decreased
expression of p65 target genes, cIAP1 and cIAP2 (Fig. 4C).
As KPT-185 induced nuclear translocation of both p65 and
IkBa and this correlated with decreased NF-kB activity, we asked
whether this inhibition was the result of IkBa directly binding p65
in the nucleus. In support of this translocation-based mechanism,
IkBa bound NFkB only in immunoprecipitates from the nuclear
fractions of KPT-185 treated cells (Fig. 4D). Loss of IkBa, through
siRNA-mediated silencing, reversed the suppression of p65 activ-
ity (Fig. 4E), increased cIAP1 and cIAP2 expression (Fig. 4E), and
decreased apoptosis (Fig. 4F). Thus, these results indicated that
this p53-independent apoptosis induced by KPT-185 is mediated
by increased nuclear levels of IkBa.

ovarian cancer–bearing mice
We assessed the in vivo antitumor efficacy of SINE compound
KPT-330 using two complementary ovarian cancer mouse mod-
els. First, we tested an intraperitoneal model of ovarian cancer

 Seventy tumor-bearing mice were divided into four groups: vehi-
cle control (n ¼ 16), cisplatin treated (n ¼ 17), KPT-330 treated
(n ¼ 16), and combination cisplatin/KPT-330 treated (n ¼ 21).
We confirmed the highly chemoresistant nature of the CP70 cell
line by demonstrating a slight (4-day) increase in median
survival among cisplatin-treated mice compared with control
mice (Fig. 5A, P < 0.0005). However, oral (gavage) selinexor
treatment significantly increased the median survival compared
with control (32 vs. 24 days, P < 0.0001) and cisplatin-treated
(32 vs. 28 days, P < 0.005; Fig. 5A) mice. The greatest survival
benefit was achieved with the selinexor–cisplatin combination,
which had a median survival of 37 days—an approximately
30% increase in survival compared with cisplatin alone (P <
0.0001) and an approximately 15% increase in survival com-
pared with selinexor alone (P ¼ 0.01). More than 60% (13/21)
and approximately 30% of cotreated mice survived beyond the
maximum survival date of the cisplatin-only (31 days) and
selinexor-only treated (43 days) mice, respectively. Immuno-
histochemical staining of ex vivo tumor samples following
treatment is shown (Fig. 5B).
We next assessed the antitumor efficacy of oral selinexor on
ovarian cancer xenograft (PDX) mice. The PDX ovarian cancer
model has recently been reported to maintain histologic, geno-
mic, and, importantly, platinum-treatment response profiles sim-
ilar to those of the donor ovarian cancer tumor (45). Our PDX
mice were derived from 7 independent patients with high-grade
serous ovarian cancer. Each patient had received a minimum of six
rounds of chemotherapy, and at least five of them multiple drugs
including platinum, taxol, and bevacizumab. Five patients had
recurrent disease and failed cisplatin treatment, and one each had
cisplatin-sensitive or -resistant primary tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Our PDX models maintained the histologic features of
the original donor tumor (top), and, as demonstrated by directed
DNA sequencing of the human/murine tumor pairs and the
patient's germline DNA, also maintained their p53 and BRCA
mutation profiles (bottom).
Within 1 to 5 months after tumor tissue implantation, tumors
developed in each of the mice. Selinexor-treated mice experienced
significant and prolonged tumor regression, which was in marked
contrast to controls (P < 0.0001, Fig. 5C, top). Dramatic tumor
shrinkage (average volume reduction � 99%) was observed in
nearly 90% (19/22) of selinexor-treated mice. Their tumors were
undetectable or only barely evident, even with open exploration
of the inoculation site (Fig. 5D). For the 3 mice without tumor
shrinkage, tumor growth was nonetheless markedly delayed. As
expected, tumor volume decreases were accompanied by survival

 increases. Most strikingly, no control mice survived beyond 38
days (median survival, 22.5 days); however, all KPT-330–treated
mice with tumor shrinkage survived the predefined 120-day
window of this experiment (Fig. 5C, bottom).
To directly ascertain whether selinexor restores cisplatin
sensitivity in vivo, we selected a PDX model generated from a
recurrent, cisplatin-resistant patient tumor (PT171, p53 mutat-
ed) for more in-depth analysis. The same four different treat-
ment groups, vehicle control (n ¼ 2), cisplatin alone (n ¼ 2),
KPT-330 alone (n ¼ 3), and combination cisplatin/KPT-330
(n ¼ 2), were compared. Although cisplatin delayed tumor
growth (P < 0.001, Fig. 5E), tumor volumes nonetheless
increased 4-fold within 40 days. In contrast, selinexor treat-
ment, either alone or in combination with cisplatin, signifi-
cantly decreased tumor volume (Fig. 5E inset, P < 0.0005).
Tumor volume decreased by more than 90% in selinexor-
treated mice, with more rapid initial decreases in tumor volume
observed in KPT-330–cisplatin–treated mice. In addition, no
evidence of tumors remained by day 50 in selinexor–cisplatin–
treated mice, even upon ex vivo inspection. As expected, seli-
nexor treatment significantly prolonged survival, with control
and cisplatin-treated mice dying within 20 and 30 days, respec-
tively, but with selinexor–cisplatin–treated mice surviving
beyond the predefined cutoff of 120 days.
Selinexor is safely tolerated by ovarian cancer patients and can
decrease tumor volume
Based in part upon these results, a phase I, single-agent clinical
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01607905) was initiated to deter-
mine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of selinexor in solid
tumor patients. This trial included 7 patients with heavily pre-
treated, relapsed ovarian cancer refractory to platinum (Fig. 6A).
Patients received 30–35 mg/m2 of oral selinexor (the MTD;
ref. 33). The most common adverse events were fatigue, nausea,
anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting, which were managed with
supportive care (Fig. 6B). No adverse events required discontin-
uation of treatment. There were no major organ toxicities and no
life threatening or grade 4 adverse events were reported. Pharma-
cokinetics achieved in patients was comparable with those
observed in mice. Selinexor resulted in up to a 10-fold induction
of XPO1 mRNA measured by qRT-PCR in patient leukocytes. In
selected solid tumors, p53 and IkBa nuclear accumulation and

two patients (patient #043-047, days on study ¼ 115 with
maximal CA-125 reduction 39%; patient #043-046, days on study
400 days with maximal CA-125 reduction 75%). The CA-125
levels over time are presented in Fig. 6E. The patient with partial
response, a >30% decrease in tumor volume (Fig. 6C), was
diagnosed in February 2000 and had already undergone eight
chemotherapy regimens (Fig. 6D). The patient received treatment
for a total of 156 days prior to probable disease progression with
small-bowel obstruction. There was no radiographic evidence of
tumor progression.
Discussion
The nucleus is a defining feature of eukaryotes, separating the
cell into nuclear and cytoplasmic components. This physical
division provides a unique degree of spatial regulation to protein
function. XPO1 is one of the eight known nuclear export proteins
that are required for nuclear:cytoplasmic transport of macromo-
lecules through the nuclear pore complex. Notably, XPO1 is the
sole nuclear exporter of a number of key cancer-associated pro-
teins, including p53 and IkBa (46). While other cancer types are
increasingly treated successfully, ovarian cancer mortality rates
have remained relatively high over the past 50 years, with a 5-year
survival rate at approximately 30% for patients diagnosed with
stage III/IV diseases. Given that chemoresistance represents the
major cause for ovarian cancer treatment failure (2), our studies
were specifically focused on exploring the efficacy and clinical
relevance of XPO1 inhibition in treating platinum-resistant ovar-
ian cancer. We believe our findings support a novel role for the use
of XPO1 inhibition in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Our results demonstrate that inhibition of XPO1 by two SINE
compounds (KPT-185 and selinexor/KPT-330) was significantly
associated with increased tumor killing, regardless of tumor
platinum sensitivity or p53 status. Notably, we demonstrated a
synergistic effect between KPT-185 and cisplatin in all immortal-
ized and primary patient-derived cell lines tested. Moreover,
selinexor and cisplatin cotreatment yielded the greatest overall
survival and reductions in tumor size in two ovarian cancer mouse
models. Most dramatically, the oral XPO1 inhibitor selinexor was
safely tolerated by 5 ovarian cancer patients and that for the
majority (3/5) of these patients, even in the setting of late-stage,
heavily pretreated, and chemoresistant disease, XPO1 inhibition

 stabilized the disease and/or shrank the tumor, with the longest
treatment lasting over 1 year. Based upon our findings of drug
synergy, combined usage of SINE and platinum agents in future
clinical studies may achieve an even greater antitumor effect.
As nearly 100% of late-stage serous ovarian tumors have defects
in p53 (41), it was necessary to define the mechanism through
which XPO1 inhibition resulted in cell death in p53-mutated
cells. In both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cell lines, in which p53 is either
null or mutated, respectively, XPO1 inhibition resulted in
increased nuclear levels of IkBa with consequent physical inter-
action with p65 and inhibition of NF-kB activity. This is consistent
with a number of previous findings that have demonstrated that
inhibition of NF-kB activity can induce cell death (43). In general,
NF-kB activity can be regulated through the shuttling of key
interacting proteins, most notably IkBa, between cytoplasm and
nucleus (47). NF-kB signaling is known to be constitutively active
(localized to the nucleus) in multiple cancers, including ovarian
cancer, and this activation is not necessarily dependent upon
intrinsic mutations in NF-kB (44). NF-kB's regulator IkBa is
sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or degraded by the proteasome.
Forced retention of IkBa in the nucleus by SINEs leads to binding
of IkBa to NF-kB and results in the termination of NF-kB binding
to DNA, neutralizing its transcriptional activity. Our findings may
be especially relevant in serous ovarian cancer as NF-kB has been
shown to be not only continuously active in ovarian cancer,
playing a role in the development and maintenance of ovarian
cancer and chemotherapy resistance (48) but NF-kB activity may
be further increased in p53-mutant cells (49). In contrast to this
finding,in the two cell lines with wild-type p53, A2780, and CP70,
XPO1 inhibition resulted in a marked nuclear shift of p53 and
activation of its downstream target, ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2
generally promotes cell survival but can, under certain conditions
(42), and as we have shown in our model system, have proa-
poptotic functions. Thus, SINE can drive both p53-dependent and
-independent apoptosis pathways allowing for broad antitumor
activity.
In addition to XPO1 a number of nuclear transport proteins are
also under study as potential therapeutic targets in cancer includ-
ing KPNA1-6, KPNB1, TNPO, and IPO (50). Driven in part by the
current understanding that nuclear–cytoplasmic export is primar-
ily driven by XPO1, a number of potential therapeutic agents
targeting XPO1 have been developed and tested, and the small-
molecule SINE has shown the most promising clinical efficacy and
safety (3–6, 51). The XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 (selinexor) is the
only compound currently being evaluated in clinical trials in solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies. Phase I results in 189
patients with advanced solid tumors was recently reported by
members of our group (33). The ovarian cancer patients in that
trial are reported herein. These current studies provide an oppor-
tunity to examine in depth the mechanisms underlying cell death
in a specific cancer type. In this regard, it is important to note that
in addition to our current study in ovarian cancer, a recent report
also examined the effect of KPT-185 in ovarian cancer models
(52). Intriguingly, and adding to the concept that SINE may
achieve their effectiveness through a number of different path-
ways, these authors identified eIF5A and IGF2BP1 as playing an
important role in KPT-mediated cell death in vitro. Our studies did
not highlight these two targets despite the fact that both used the
A2780 cell line. The reason for these differences is currently
unknown but will be important to pursue to better understand
mechanisms of effect and resistance.
The full roster of cancer-relevant cargo transported by XPO1
and the resultant pathway dysregulation(s) caused by inappro-
priate nuclear–cytoplasmic partitioning resulting from XPO1
overexpression remains unknown. Our studies not only provide
the rationale for XPO1 as a therapeutic target in platinum-resis-
tant ovarian cancer, but also demonstrate that XPO1 acts syner-
gistically with cisplatin and highlights that cell death is achieved
through both p53-dependent and independent pathways. Thus,
future clinical trials targeting platinum-resistant ovarian cancers,
which are almost always p53 mutated, could potentially over-
come this resistance through combination treatment using both a
platinum agent and SINE.
