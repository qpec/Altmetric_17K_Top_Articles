In Brief
Luo and colleagues reveal a hitherto
unexpected role of macrophages in the
repair of brain vascular ruptures. Once
rupture of brain blood vessel occurs,
macrophages come to mediate the repair
of the rupture through direct physical
adhesion to the breaking points and
generation of mechanical traction forces.

SUMMARY
Hemorrhagic
stroke
and brain
microbleeds are
caused by cerebrovascular ruptures. Fast repair
of such ruptures is the most promising therapeu-
tic approach. Due to a lack of high-resolution in
vivo real-time studies, the dynamic cellular events
involved in cerebrovascular repair remain unknown.
Here, we have developed a cerebrovascular rupture
system in zebrafish by using multi-photon laser,
which generates a lesion with two endothelial ends.
Invivotime-lapseimagingshowed that a macrophage
arrived at the lesion and extended filopodia or la-
mellipodia to physically adhere to both endothelial
ends. This macrophage generated mechanical trac-
tion forces to pull the endothelial ends and facilitate
their ligation, thus mediating the repair of the rupture.
Both depolymerization of microfilaments and inhibi-
tion of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase or Rac1 activ-
ity disrupted macrophage-endothelial adhesion and
impaired cerebrovascular repair. Our study reveals
a hitherto unexpected role for macrophages in medi-
ating repair of cerebrovascular ruptures through
direct physical adhesion and mechanical traction.
INTRODUCTION
Pathological bleeding in the brain includes hemorrhagic stroke
and microbleeds. Hemorrhagic stroke, one of the leading causes
of death and adult disability worldwide, is primarily caused by
hypertensive atherosclerosis followed by the rupture of cerebral
arterioles. Microbleeds result from ruptures in microvessels
in the brain. Recently, improvements in imaging techniques
have enabled the detection of previously invisible microbleeds.
Although brain microbleeds do not present with acute symptoms
as in major strokes, they are closely associated with age-related
cognitive decline and dementia (Poels et al., 2012; Gregoire
et al., 2012; Liman and Endres, 2012; Nishimura and Schaffer,
2013). Once these cerebrovascular ruptures have occurred,
fast repair of the ruptures is clinically necessary to avoid the
exacerbation of symptoms and becomes the most efficacious
therapeutic approach for treating these ruptures.
Damage to endothelial integrity is the key reason for cerebro-
vascular ruptures (Deanfield et al., 2007). Thus, the maintenance
of brain vascular health requires the fast repair of endothelial le-
sions and the recovery of endothelial integrity. Endothelial repair
can be achieved through the self-replication of endothelial cells
(ECs) and the differentiation of bone marrow-derived endothelial
progenitor cells (Asahara et al., 1997). However, these two mech-
anismsnormallytakeplaceduringischemicvascularregeneration
and always involve therapeutic neoangiogenesis. The cellular
mechanisms underlying the repair of cerebrovascular ruptures
remain to be elucidated.
Macrophages are associated with brain injury, hemorrhage,
and several aspects of vascular development and remodeling.
After brain injury, ATP released from the injured parenchymal
tissues mediates a rapid response of microglia, the principal im-
mune cells in the brain (Davalos et al., 2005; Sieger et al., 2012).
Macrophagesplaycentral rolesininflammationandphagocytosis
through their ability to recognize and engulf apoptotic cells. After
spinal cord or brain injury, macrophages are essential for regener-
ative response and recovery (Shechter et al., 2009, 2013; Kyritsis
et al., 2012). In murine stroke models, macrophages prevent hem-
orrhagic infarct transformation (Gliem et al., 2012). Patients with
stroke have high amounts of macrophages and inflammatory cy-
tokines in the plasma around stroke lesions (Sa
´ nchez-Moreno
et al., 2004; Chiba and Umegaki, 2013). Most capillary micro-
bleeds in the elderly also involve macrophages (Fazekas et al.,
1999; Fisher et al., 2010). During angiogenesis, macrophages
are thought to promote the fusion of endothelial tip cells. How-
ever, because this fusion is unaffected in macrophage-deficient
mice, macrophages might promote fusion via assistance or stabi-
lization rather than a direct ‘‘bridge’’ (Checchin et al., 2006;
Kubota et al., 2009; Fantin et al., 2010; Schmidt and Carmeliet,
2010; Rymo et al., 2011). This conclusion has been verified by
the finding that macrophages secrete vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-C to stabilize tip cell fusion and increase vascular
complexity (Tammela et al., 2011; Geudens and Gerhardt,
2011). Until now, there has been no direct evidence that macro-
phages are absolutely required for angiogenesis.
Direct interactions between macrophages and ECs play
important roles in inflammation and atherosclerosis. To reach
the site of inflammation, macrophages in the circulation need

 to undergo transendothelial migration. This transmigration first
requires adhesions between the macrophage and the activated
ECs, which involves adhesion molecules such as PECAM1 and
ICAM1. Then, the macrophage opens endothelial junctional con-
tacts, building a temporary paracellular hole to transmigrate the
endothelial layer (Ley et al., 2007). These adhesion molecule-
mediated macrophage-endothelial adhesions and transmigra-
tions are also implicated in the pathogenic steps of early
atherosclerosis (Moore and Tabas, 2011). Although macro-
phages play multiple roles in vascular biology and pathology,
whether they play a part in the repair of cerebrovascular rup-
tures, other than their role in phagocytosis, remains unknown.
In addition, because there is a lack of high-resolution real-time
studies, the in vivo dynamic cellular events by which cerebrovas-
cular ruptures are repaired need further characterization.
In this study, we established a cerebrovascular rupture model
in zebrafish by using a multi-photon laser to generate a lesion.
In vivo time-lapse imaging revealed that a macrophage arrived
at the lesion and extended filopodia or lamellipodia to physically
adhere to the endothelial ends. Mechanical traction forces were
generated by the macrophage to facilitate endothelial ligation,
which mediated the repair of the cerebrovascular rupture. The
observed macrophage-endothelial adhesion and traction were
dependent on microfilaments and the activity of phosphatidyli-
nositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Rac1. This study reveals a previ-
ously unexpected function of macrophages.
RESULTS
Macrophages Mediate the Repair of Cerebrovascular
Ruptures
We generated the Tg(kdrl:DenNTR)cq10 zebrafish transgenic
line, which expresses a green-to-red photoconvertible fluores-
cent protein, Dendra2 (Den), that is fused to nitroreductase
(NTR) and driven by the EC-specific promoter kdrl. Then, the
Tg(kdrl:DenNTR; coro1a:eGFP; lysC:DsRed) triple transgenic
line was produced in which ECs, macrophages, and neutrophils
are fluorescently labeled with Dendra2, eGFP, and yellow (eGFP
plus DsRed), respectively (Li et al., 2012a). Because neutrophils
cannot pass the blood-brain barrier, yellow fluorescent neutro-
phils were absent in the brain. To investigate the dynamic cellular
events that occur during cerebrovascular repair, we developed
an injury system in zebrafish. A high-energy multi-photon laser
(Nishimura et al., 2006) was used to focus on and irradiate brain
vascular ECs (Figure 1A). By using this technique, a brain blood
vessel was ruptured, and a lesion with two endothelial ends was
generated (Figure 1B). This endothelial lesion, but not a brain
parenchymal lesion, immediately led to cerebral hemorrhage
(Figures 1A–1F; Movie S1). In vivo time-lapse imaging showed
the arrival of a macrophage at the lesion site about 30 min
after laser irradiation. Over the next 60 min, this macrophage
extended filopodia or lamellipodia that contacted both endo-
thelial ends (Figure 1G), then pulled out protrusions from the
endothelial ends (Figure 1H) and mediated the endothelial
ligation (Figure 1I). Once the endothelial ends were completely
ligated and the lesion repair was accomplished, the macro-
phage migrated away (Figure 1J). These dynamic cellular events
become the preliminary evidence showing that the repair of ce-
rebrovascular ruptures is mediated by macrophages (Movie S2).
We next sought to exclude the possibility that the macrophage
came to the lesion only to phagocytose dead cells and to remove
cell debris. We first compared macrophage behaviors when
different brain tissues were injured. When a blood vessel was
ruptured, the key characteristics of the macrophage included
the extension of filopodia or lamellipodia that adhered to the
endothelial ends (Figure 2A; Movie S2). The length of one of
these filopodium or lamellipodium could reach up to 50 mm. In
contrast, if the brain parenchyma neighboring blood vessel
was injured by laser irradiation, no filopodia or lamellipodia
were observed, and the phagocytotic macrophage always
remained round in shape (Figure 2B; Movie S3). These data
demonstrate that the behaviors of macrophages during the

 repair of cerebrovascular ruptures are different from their behav-
iors during phagocytosis. To further explore the functional signif-
icance of the role of macrophages in lesion repair, we ablated the
repairing macrophage by laser irradiation after the macrophage
had contacted the endothelial ends (Figure 2C). Another macro-
phage quickly arrived to engulf the ablated macrophage, but this
newly arrived macrophage never extended filopodia or lamelli-
podia. Thus, ligation of the endothelial ends failed and the lesion
remained unrepaired (Figure 2C). These results indicate that
macrophages mediate the repair of cerebrovascular ruptures.
Macrophages Are Attracted by Extracellular ATP and
Form Direct Physical Adhesions with Endothelial Ends
The ATP released by injured neurons can bind to P2Y12, a micro-
glia-specific ATP receptor. This process mediates the response
of microglia to neuronal cell death in the brain (Davalos et al.,
2005; Sieger et al., 2012). To explore whether the migration of
macrophages toward cerebrovascular lesions is also mediated
by extracellular ATP, we injected apyrase, an ATP-hydrolyzing
enzyme. Macrophages failed to arrive at the cerebrovascular
lesion after apyrase injection (Figures 2D and 2E). Pharmacolog-
ical inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor using MRS2395 led to
similar defects in macrophage migration (Figures 2F and 2G).
The release of ATP is stimulated by a sharp increase in the cyto-
plasmic Ca2+ concentration, which is caused by the efflux of
Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytoplasm
(Sieger et al., 2012). Using the kdrl:GcaMP5 transgene, which
expresses a Ca2+ sensor specifically in vascular ECs, we
observed a dramatic increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concen-
tration in endothelial ends shortly after laser irradiation (Figures
2H and 2I). All of these data indicate that extracellular ATP is
the chemokine signal that attracts macrophages to the cerebro-
vascular rupture, similarly to what occurs after neuronal injury in
the brain.
P2Y12 and Slc7a7, a Leu and Arg transporter necessary
for microglial brain colonization (Rossi et al., 2015), are micro-
glia-specific molecules that can distinguish microglia from
periphery macrophages. Using these microglial markers, we ad-
dressed the question of whether lesion-repairing macrophages
are restricted to brain-resident microglia or can be infiltrating
from periphery. Combination of fluorescent in situ hybridizations
(FISH) and immunohistochemistry (He et al., 2014) indicated that
the absolute majority of lesion-repairing macrophages were pos-
itive for p2y12 and slc7a7 (Figure S1A, 56/58; Figure S1C, 44/45).
However, in very rare cases, lesion repair mediated by the
infiltrating p2y12- and slc7a7-negative macrophages could be
observed (Figure S1B, 2/58; Figure S1D, 1/45). A splice morpho-
lino against slc7a7 (slc7a7MO) has been applied to specifically
deplete microglia in zebrafish, without affecting peripheral mac-
rophages (Rossi et al., 2015). After efficient depletion of microglia
by slc7a7MO (Figures S1E–S1H), only about 20% of cerebrovas-
cular ruptures could be accessed and repaired by macrophages
(Figure S1I, 17/81). However, all these repairing macrophages
were negative for p2y12 (Figure S1J, 17/17), indicating that
depletion of microglia increased the accessibility of peripheral
macrophages to cerebrovascular lesions. These data suggest
that although the absolute majority of brain vascular ruptures
are repaired by brain-resident microglia, peripheral macro-
phages also own this lesion-repairing ability.
After the arrival of a macrophage at the lesion, two mecha-
nisms are potentially involved in the mediation of endothelial liga-
tion. One is factor secretion, and the other is physical adhesion
and mechanical traction. It has previously been reported that
during angiogenesis, macrophages secrete VEGF-C, which sta-
bilizes the fusion of endothelial tip cells and increases vascular
complexity (Fantin et al., 2010; Tammela et al., 2011). In some
rare cases, after cerebrovascular rupture, we observed two or
more macrophages arriving at the lesion, and in these cases,
the two endothelial ends were adhered by different macro-
phages. The lesion was never repaired in these cases, and the
macrophages eventually detached from and left the endothelial
ends (Figure 3A; Movie S4). Cerebrovascular rupture was suc-
cessfully repaired only if the two endothelial ends were in direct
contact with the same macrophage (Figure 3B; Movie S4). These
results exclude factor secretion as the major mechanism through
which macrophages mediate the repair of cerebrovascular rup-
tures, a scenario that is different from the process that occurs
in angiogenesis during development.
If factor secretion is not the major mechanism, the next possi-
bility is direct physical adhesion and mechanical force. It has
been reported that macrophages express the adhesion molecule
CDH5 when co-cultured with ECs or with pro-angiogenic cyto-
kines in vitro (Glod et al., 2006; Bohgaki and Kitaguchi, 2007).
Other adhesion molecules, such as PECAM1, VCAM1, and
ICAM1, are expressed in macrophages during transmigration in
atherosclerosis and inflammation (Vasioukhin et al., 2000; Ley
et al., 2007). Under physiological conditions, strong and weak
Cdh5 expression was detected in brain vascular ECs and macro-
phages, respectively, under Tg(cdh5:gal4; UAS:GFP) transgenic
background (Figure S2A; Bussmann et al., 2011). These results
were confirmed by double immunostaining for GFP and the
macrophage marker Lcp1 (Figure S2B; Li et al., 2011). In the
Tg(mpeg1:GFP) transgenic line (Ellett et al., 2011), the expression
of cdh5, pecam1, icam1, and vcam1, but not kdrl or the tight junc-
tion molecule zo1, were detected in sorted brain macrophages
(Figure S2C). Once the macrophage was in direct contact with
the endothelial ends, Cdh5 accumulated at the macrophage-
endothelial adhesion sites (Figure 3C). This Cdh5 accumula-
tion was maintained throughout the lesion repair process, even
when ligation was complete and the macrophage was about to

(D–G) In contrast to the control treatment with PBS (E, n = 20/20) or DMSO (G, n = 35/35), in which macrophages arrive at the lesion within 30 min after laser
irradiation, no macrophage arrives at the lesion at 1 hr after laser irradiation in the animals treated with apyrase (D, n = 15/15) or MRS2395 (F, n = 75/77).
(H and I) A sharp increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was observed in the endothelial end cells (H, n = 13/15, arrowheads) but not in the distal
endothelial cells (H, arrows) at 2 min after laser irradiation. White circles indicate the focus and irradiation point. Scale bar represents 10 mm.
(I) Fluorescent intensities were measured along the white line from 0 mm to 13 mm before and after laser irradiation.
Representative data from at least three independent experiments are shown. See also Figure S1 and Movie S3.

 leave (Figure 3D). Similarly, the accumulation of another adhesion
molecule, Pecam1, at macrophage-endothelial adhesion sites
was observed using the kdrl:pecam1-GFP transgene (Figure 3E).
These data demonstrate that a stable physical adhesion forms
between the macrophage and endothelial ends during the repair
of cerebrovascular rupture.
The Macrophage-Mediated Repair of Cerebrovascular
Ruptures Is Dependent on Mechanical Forces and
Microfilaments
Filopodia can generate remarkably large traction forces over
large distances (Kress et al., 2007), which is dependent on
myosin II, an ATP-driven, actin-based molecular motor (Ru
¨ egg
et al., 2002; Meili et al., 2010). To investigate the role of myosin
II-dependent mechanic forces in the repair of cerebrovas-
cular ruptures, blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor, was used.
Before the administration of blebbistatin, macrophage-endothe-
lial adhesion and traction was observed to pull the two endothe-
lial ends toward each other, and the rupture gap became
gradually reduced (Figure 3F). After blebbistatin was applied in
the middle, the macrophages exhibited arrested traction, and
the rupture remained unrepaired (Figures 3F–3H). These results
demonstrate the involvement of myosin II-dependent mechani-
cal traction forces in the macrophage-mediated repair of cere-
brovascular ruptures.
The main backbone of filopodia or lamellipodia is microfila-
ments, which are composed of polymerized filamentous-actin
(F-actin) and connect to adhesion molecules, such as CDH5
and PECAM1 (Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008). The accumulation
of microfilaments indicates the generation of mechanical forces,
which can transfer from one cell to another through adhesion
molecules and microfilaments (Tzima et al., 2005; Borghi et al.,
2012). The macrophages physically adhered to and pulled the
endothelial ends using their filopodia or lamellipodia to repair
the cerebrovascular rupture (Figures 1G–1J and 3C; Movies S2
and S5). To study the roles of microfilaments during this repair
process, we generated a Tg(kdrl:Lifeact-DsRed)cq11 transgenic
line that expresses the F-actin probe Lifeact (Riedl et al., 2008)
in ECs. Cell-cell adhesions can be monitored by the accumula-
tion of F-actin, which is indicated by Lifeact enrichment (Phng
et al., 2013). No accumulation of F-actin in endothelial ends
was observed before the macrophage arrived, but an accumula-
tion of F-actin became detectable at the adhesion site once the
macrophage had physically adhered (Figure 4A). Similarly, the
Tg(coro1a:Lifeact-DsRed)cq12 transgenic line was established
to probe the accumulation of F-actin in the macrophage because
F-actin is also important for immune cell migration and force
transmission (Yoo et al., 2010). F-actin accumulation in the
macrophage moved from the leading edge during migration to
the macrophage-endothelial adhesion sites during adhesion
and traction. Once the lesion repair had been accomplished
and the macrophage was about to leave, the accumulated
F-actin dispersed and then returned to the migratory leading
edge (Figure 4B). These results suggest the potential role of
microfilament accumulation in the repair of cerebrovascular
rupture.
We inhibited microfilament assembly with Latrunculin B (Lat.B),
which depolymerizes F-actin (Phng et al., 2013). Treatment with
Lat.B instantly after cerebrovascular rupture partially reduced
themotilityofmacrophagesas well as theirmigration tothelesion.
However, even when a macrophage arrived at the lesion site,
it failed to extend filopodia or lamellipodia and therefore could
not establish a stable physical adhesion with the endothelial
ends. Hence, the lesion remained unrepaired (Figures 4C and
4D). When Lat.B was administered after the establishment of
macrophage-endothelial physical adhesions, the macrophage
appeared to lose its filopodia or lamellipodia and detach from
and finally leave the endothelial ends. Lesion repair consequently
failed (Figure 4E). These results indicate that the macrophage-
mediated repair of cerebrovascular rupture is dependent on
microfilaments.
The Macrophage-Mediated Repair of Cerebrovascular
Rupture Requires PI3K and Rac1 Activity
To explore the regulatory molecules and signaling pathways
involved in macrophage-mediated cerebrovascular repair, mac-
rophages and endothelial end cells at three different lesion stages
(uninjured controls, macrophage arrival, and during macrophage
traction) were photoconverted and sorted (Figure S3). Transcrip-
tional profile analysis (Table S1) revealed several potentially
important molecules that exhibited transcriptional changes at
different lesion stages, either in repairing macrophages or in
endothelial ends. These molecules are involved in tight junctions,
leukocyte transendothelial migration, and cell adhesion, as well
as in signaling pathways including the PI3K-Akt, Hif1, TNF,
MAPK, and chemokine signaling pathways (Figure S4). These
transcriptional changes were highly correlated with different
cell morphologies and behaviors at different stages. The macro-
phages that had just arrived at the lesion exhibited overall tran-
scriptional upregulation of cell adhesion and mechanical force
regulatory factors (Figures 5A and S5A). Although the extent
of this upregulation was reduced when the repair process pro-
ceeded to the traction stage (Figure S5B), their overall tran-
scriptions were still higher than those in the control macrophages
Figure 3. Macrophage-Endothelial Physical Adhesions and Myosin II-Dependent Traction during the Repair of Cerebrovascular Ruptures
(A and B) If the two endothelial ends are adhered to two different macrophages, the cerebrovascular rupture cannot be repaired (A, n = 17/17). The ligation occurs
only when the two endothelial ends are adhered to the same macrophage (B, n = 19/20). Arrowheads mark macrophages that are in direct contact with the
endothelial ends of the lesion.

(A) Once the endothelial-macrophage adhesion is established, F-actin accumulates at the adhesion sites in the endothelial ends (n = 10/10).

during adhesion and traction (at 1:30 and 2:15). Once the lesion repair has been accomplished and the macrophage is about to leave, the accumulated F-actin
disperses (at 3:00) and then returns to the migratory leading edge (at 3:25, arrowhead) (n = 10/12).

 (Figures 5A and S5C). The same set of factors were also upregu-
lated in the endothelial end cells in the traction stage (Figure S5B),
later than their transcriptional upregulation in the macrophages.
This provides indirect evidence showing that the endothelial
ends are passively pulled by the macrophage.
Transcriptional profile analyses identified upregulation of PI3K
and Rac in macrophages upon their arrival at the lesion site (Fig-
ure S5A). PI3K activity is required for both random and directed
neutrophil motility, which involves the regulation of F-actin
dynamics (Yoo et al., 2010). To study the functions of PI3K
in the macrophage-mediated repair of cerebrovascular ruptures,
the standard PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used. Treatment with
LY294002 after macrophage-endothelial adhesion froze the
shape of the macrophage and the adhesion, and the macro-
phage lost its ability to generate mechanical traction force.
Therefore, the lesion remained unrepaired (Figures 5B and 5C).
In these cases, the macrophage lost its motility and therefore
its ability to leave the lesion site (Figure 5B).
Rac1 induces actin polymerization, which drives lamellipodial
extension and the formation of small adhesions (Wittmann and
Waterman-Storer, 2001). PI3K promotes actin polymerization
and lamellipodial extension at the leading edge of the cell via
the activation of Rac (Nishikimi et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2010). To
understand the role of Rac in macrophage-mediated lesion
repair, we used Tg(kdrl:Rac1-FRET)cq17 and Tg(coro1a:Rac1-
FRET)cq18 transgenic lines, in which a Raichu FRET sensor (Itoh
et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012b) is expressed to
monitor Rac1 activity in ECs and macrophages. Once the macro-
phages had adhered to the endothelial ends, Rac1 activity
increased at and around the adhesion sites in both endothelial
ends (Figure 5G) and in the macrophage (Figure 5H). The
functional significance of Rac1 was demonstrated by the admin-
istration of NSC23766, a chemical inhibitor of Rac1. Macro-
phage-endothelial adhesions were interfered by NSC23766,
and the repair could therefore not be accomplished (Figures 5I,
5J, and 5L). To specifically inhibit endogenous Rac activity in
macrophages, we applied coronin1a promoter-driven hCRIB-
RasCT, which contains the Rac and Cdc42 binding domain of
PAK1 fused to the C-terminal tail of human Ras and is effective
in blocking Rac1 function in zebrafish (Kardash et al., 2010).
In the Tg(kdrl:DenNTR; coro1a:hCRIB-RasCT) transgenic line,
macrophages did arrive at the lesion sites, but they failed to repair
the ruptures (Figures 5K and 5L). These results further substanti-
ate the functional significance of Rac1 in the repair of cerebrovas-
cular ruptures.

a cerebrovascular rupture, F-actin distribution in macrophages
was disrupted (Figures 5D and 5E). Macrophages therefore
completely lost motility and their ability to migrate toward the
lesion. However, the lesion was slowly repaired (Figure 5F). All
the results above, on one hand, suggest that mechanical traction
forces controlled by PI3K and Rac1 are required for macrophage-
mediated cerebrovascular repair. On the other hand, they imply
thata macrophage-independentmechanismcanrepair the lesion.
Macrophage-Independent Slower and Less Efficient
Repair Is Fulfilled through Endothelial Self-Extensions
Brain vascular development remained unaffected in the irf8
morphant (Figures 6A and 6B), in which macrophages are absent
(Li et al., 2011). We explored the cellular events involved in
the macrophage-independent repair of cerebrovascular rup-
tures using the irf8 morphant. In vivo time-lapse imaging showed
that both endothelial ends continuously self-extended toward
each other until they met and connected (Figure 6C). The admin-
istration of either Lat.B or the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole
revealed that endothelial self-extension and connection in the
irf8 morphant were dependent on microtubules (Figures 6D
and 6E) and not on microfilaments (Figures 6F and 6G). To visu-
alize microtubule organization after cerebrovascular rupture
in the irf8 morphant, the Tg(kdrl:eb3-GFP)cq13 transgenic back-
ground, which expresses a microtubule probe (Stepanova
et al., 2003) in ECs, was used. Before laser irradiation, microtu-
bules in brain vascular ECs were disordered. They became
well organized into bundles in endothelial end cells after rupture
and during the subsequent self-extension process (Figure 6H).
All these data demonstrate the indispensable role of microtu-
bules in the endothelial self-extension-mediated, macrophage-
independent repair of cerebrovascular ruptures. Although these
ruptures could be repaired independently of macrophages, the
macrophage-dependent mechanism of repair was significantly
faster and more efficient. The average ligation time and effi-
ciency in the macrophage-dependent versus the macrophage-
independent mechanisms were 3 hr versus 6 hr and 75% versus
45%, respectively (Figure 6I). More importantly, because macro-
phages are present in the brain, macrophage-independent
repair is scarcely feasible under physiological conditions.
Real-time observations in wild-type animals revealed that
self-extension of the endothelial ends occurred immediately
after laser rupture and was sustained until the arrival of a macro-
phage. Physical contact between the endothelial ends and
macrophage blocked the endothelial self-extension process
(Movie S6). If the macrophage later detached, the endothelial
ends would retreat. But their self-extensions never restarted,
and the cerebrovascular lesion remained unrepaired (Figure 7A;
Movies S4 and S7). In the absence of a macrophage, Rac1 activ-
ity was reduced at the tip of the endothelial ends during self-
extension (Figure 7B), which is in accordance with the observed
transcriptional downregulation of Rac in the endothelial end
cells when the macrophage just arrived (Figure S5A). When
NSC23766 was applied to inhibit Rac1 activity in the irf8 mor-
phant, endothelial self-extension and macrophage-independent
cerebrovascular repair was accelerated (Figures 7C, 7D, and
(C–E) Treatment with Latrunculin B (Lat.B) immediately after laser ablation dramatically reduced the ratio of macrophage arrival (34%, n = 17/50 versus 98%,
n = 49/50 in the control). Even among those macrophages arriving at the lesion, treatment with Lat.B impaired the formation of filopodia or lamellipodia and
endothelial-macrophage adhesions, thereby none of the lesion was successfully repaired (C, n = 17/17). In contrast, the macrophage-mediated repair was
achieved in the control treatment (water) (D, n = 19/25). Treatment with Lat.B after the establishment of physical adhesions and traction (at 1:10) resulted in the
disruption of adhesion and the repair of cerebrovascular rupture failed (E, n = 8/8).
The time elapsed since the laser ablation is indicated in hours:minutes. Scale bars represent 10 mm. Representative data from at least three independent
experiments are shown.

 7F). The specific inhibition of Rac activity in vascular ECs using
the kdrl:hCRIB-RasCT transgene also sped up endothelial self-
extension and the macrophage-independent repair process in
the irf8 morphant (Figures 7E and 7F). These data indicate that
endothelial self-extension after cerebrovascular rupture requires
the repression of Rac1 activity. Therefore, under physiological
conditions, the increases in Rac1 activity that are caused by
endothelial-macrophage adhesion (Figure 5G) might serve as
one of the major factors that stops endothelial self-extension.
The Macrophage-Mediated Repair Is Potentially
Conserved in Peripheral Blood Vessels
An interesting question is whether macrophage-mediated rupture
repair is unique to brain blood vessels. We irradiated the blood
vessel in the zebrafish fin by using a multi-photon laser. After
the rupture, neutrophils quickly arrived at the lesion, and this
was followed by the arrival of macrophages. One of the macro-
phages, but none of the neutrophils, extended filopodia or lamel-
lipodia and formed a stable physical adhesion with the endothelial
ends. Finally, the ligation of the endothelial ends was successfully
accomplished by the macrophage. Before the completion of this
process, all of the neutrophils had left the lesion (Figure S6). These
results provide preliminary evidence showing that the macro-
phage-mediated repair of vascular ruptures is conserved among
different organs. Repair of peripheral vascular ruptures by macro-
phages is also in accordance with our observations that macro-
phages infiltrating from the periphery are capable of mediating
the repair of cerebrovascular ruptures, although these are small
probability events (Figures S1B and S1D). Nevertheless, the
vascular repair in the fin takes about 6.5 hr, much longer than
the repair in the brain, which might be caused by the disturbance
of neutrophils. The fast cerebrovascular repair might particularly
highlight the importance of macrophage-dependent mechanism
in the brain. In addition, because neutrophils are absent in the
brain, the brain vasculature is a clearer system that can be used
in live imaging to study dynamic cellular events during these
repairs.
DISCUSSION
In summary, once a brain blood vessel is ruptured, the two endo-
thelial ends promptly extend toward each other. In the mean-
time, macrophages are activated and migrate toward the lesion.
The arrival of a macrophage blocks self-extension of the endo-
thelial ends. The macrophage extends filopodia or lamellipodia,
which contact and physically adhere to the endothelial ends
and mechanically pull the ends to mediate their ligation, thus
achieving the repair of cerebrovascular ruptures. If a macro-
phage is absent or not able to migrate to the lesion, the two
endothelial ends will continuously self-extend until they meet
and connect, thus accomplishing the lesion repair by a slower
and less efficient mode.
In cases such as laser ablation of the repairing macrophage or
macrophage-endothelial midway detachment, the macrophage-
endothelial adhesion initially occurs, but the repair cannot be
completed. First, the self-extension of the endothelial ends never
re-initiates, which might be related to elevated Rac1 activity
caused by the macrophage-endothelial adhesion. Endothelial
self-extension requires attenuated Rac1 activity. Second, no
second macrophage arrives to adhere to and ligate the endothe-
lial ends. This might be caused by the diffusion or disappearance
of chemokinetic ATP, and thus a second macrophage cannot be
attracted.
More than 96% of cerebrovascular ruptures attract p2y12-
and slc7a7-positive, brain-resident microglia rather than periph-
eral macrophages. Although P2Y12 is also weakly expressed in
the anti-inflammatory macrophages, this expression is so weak
that P2Y12 is a reliable marker to distinguish microglia and
peripheral macrophages (Sasaki et al., 2003; Butovsky et al.,
2014). It is reasonable that brain-resident microglia are much
faster and easier to receive injury signals and access lesions
than peripheral macrophages. That is why it is difficult to use
live imaging to observe the repair of cerebrovascular ruptures
by infiltrating macrophages. However, if an infiltrating macro-
phage is by chance close to the lesion site when cerebrovascular
rupture occurs, the lesion can also be repaired by this macro-
phage. The probability that cerebrovascular lesions are repaired
by peripheral macrophages increases if brain-resident microglia
become depleted. Then, although only 20% of ruptures are able
to be repaired by macrophages, all these repairing macrophages
are from periphery.
Hemorrhagic strokes, microbleeds, and temporary holes in
vascular walls are different types of pathogenic or physiolog-
ical vascular ruptures or punctures that occur very often in the
brain. Prompt repair of these cerebrovascular ruptures is impor-
tant. Our zebrafish model recapitulates both cerebral hemor-
rhage and microbleeds. As an immune cell type that normally
performs its functions via phagocytosis and factor secretion,

applied immediately after laser ablation, accumulation of F-actin in the macrophage was disrupted (D, n = 13/15) in contrast to the control (E, n = 15/15). However,
the rupture was slowly repaired (F, n = 11/22).

 macrophages have previously never been thought to mediate
the repair of cerebrovascular ruptures or to carry out this function
through generation of mechanical traction forces. In the context
of angiogenesis, although macrophages occasionally appear
around tip cells, we never observed their physical adhesion or
mechanical traction. Together with the data showing normal
vasculature in the irf8 morphant, we conclude that macrophages
do not act as bridge cells during vasculogenesis and angiogen-
esis in zebrafish.
Our findings might imply another possible role for macro-
phages in atherosclerosis and inflammation. Macrophages
open EC junctional contacts, build a temporary paracellular
hole, and then transmigrate through this hole from the vessel
lumen to reach the intima or the inflammatory tissues (Ley

 et al., 2007; Moore and Tabas, 2011). After transmigration of the
macrophage has been accomplished, the temporary endothelial
hole should be closed to avoid becoming a lesion. How this
closure is achieved has never been addressed, but mechanisms
similar to those shown in this study might be involved. This hy-
pothesis is supported by our finding showing the transcriptional
upregulation of leukocyte transendothelial migration factors in
the macrophages undergoing traction.
We used real-time live imaging, transcriptional profiles, and
functional studies to reveal the dynamic cellular events and
regulatory molecules involved in the repair of cerebrovascular
ruptures, providing important information that will be useful for
the development of translatable post-microbleeding therapies.
For example, pro-leukogenic drugs that increase the number
of macrophages, soft agonists of PI3K or Rac1, and sensitizers
of the P2Y12 receptor are all potentially able to facilitate the
repair of microbleeding lesions. Thus, this study might be of
both scientific and clinical interest.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Zebrafish Strains and Generation of Transgenic Lines
Zebrafish lines were raised and maintained under standard laboratory condi-
tions according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.
For the generation of new transgenic lines, the constructs were injected into
zebrafish embryos of the AB genetic background at the 1-cell stage. See Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Treatment with Chemicals and Morpholino Injections
Nocodazole (8 mg/mL, Sigma), LY294002 (20 mM, Calbiochem), NSC23766
(240 mM, Selleck), and Blebbistatin (30 mM, Sigma) was administered and
controlled by 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.3% DMSO in egg water, respectively. La-
trunculin B (0.08 mg/mL, Sigma) was directly dissolved into egg water. A solu-
tion of MRS2395 (50 mM, Sigma) or apyrase (90 U/mL, Sigma) was injected into
the optic tectum of anesthetized larvae. Antisense morpholino-oligonucleo-
tides against irf8 (irf8MO: 50-TCAGTCTGCGACCGCCCGAGTTCAT-30) and
slc7a7 (slc7a7MO: 50-AAAGTGTTTATTACTCACCACAGCC-30) was injected
into zebrafish embryos at the 1- to 4-cell stages (Li et al., 2011; Rossi et al.,
2015).
Laser Microsurgical Cell Ablation, Photoconversion, In Vivo Time-
Lapse, and FRET Imaging
For laser microsurgical cell ablation, the target endothelial cell or macro-
phage was focused in a single confocal plane and irradiated for 3 s by a
multi-photon laser at 800 nm (Chameleon Vision2 Laser System, Coherent).
Whole larvae photoconversion was performed by exposing the larvae to UV
light for 4 min using a M165FC Stereo Microscope (Leica). Time-lapse
images were captured using a 203 water immersion objective mounted on
an LSM780NLO confocal microscope that was equipped with a heating
stage to maintain 28.5�C. Z-stack images were collected every 3–10 min,
and three-dimensional datasets were compiled with ZEN2010 software
(Carl Zeiss). FRET ratio images were captured as previously described (Kar-
dash et al., 2010, 2011; Li et al., 2012b). See Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for details.
RNA Sequencing
Focused photoconversions of endothelial end cells or macrophages at three
lesion stages were achieved by irradiating Tg(kdrl:DenNTR; coro1a:eGFP) or
Tg(coro1a:Kaeda; kdrl:eGFP) transgenic larvae with a 405-nm laser for 30 s.
About 80 cells (repairing macrophages or endothelial end cells) in 20 animals
were photoconverted, then sorted by flow cytometry (Moflo XDP, Beckman).
cDNA libraries were generated from these sorted cells using the Smart-seq2
protocol. RNA sequencing was performed using the PE100 strategy (HiSeq
2500, Illumina). Sequencing data were then analyzed. See Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for details.
Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridizations
Whole-mount antibody staining and combination of fluorescent in situ hybrid-
izations and immunohistochemistry were performed as previously described
(Liu et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2013; He et al., 2014). See Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures for details.
Experimental Design and Statistics
All experiments comparing treatment groups were carried out using randomly
assigned siblings without investigator blinding. Sample sizes were chosen ac-
cording to estimation of effect sizes. After at least two repeated experiments,
data were analyzed for statistical significance using comparison of means and
two-tailed Student’s t test. No data were excluded. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. Unless otherwise mentioned in the
legend, sample sizes (n = y/x) represent the number of laser irradiation points.
