 Abstract 
Anticipatory distress prior to a painful medical procedure can lead to negative 
sequelae including heightened pain experiences, avoidance of future medical procedures, 
and potential non-compliance with preventative healthcare such as vaccinations. Few 
studies have examined the longitudinal and concurrent predictors of pain-related 
anticipatory distress. This paper consists of two companion studies to examine both the 
longitudinal factors from infancy, as well as concurrent factors from preschool that 
predict pain-related anticipatory distress at the preschool age. Study 1 examined how well 
preschool pain-related anticipatory distress was predicted by infant pain responding at 2, 
4, 6 and 12 months of age.  In Study 2, using a developmental psychopathology 
framework, longitudinal analyses examined the predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, 
and present factors that led to the development of anticipatory distress during routine 
preschool vaccinations. A sample of 202 caregiver-child dyads was observed during their 
infant and preschool vaccinations (OUCH Cohort) and was used for both studies. In 
Study 1, pain responding during infancy was not found to significantly predict pain-
related anticipatory distress at preschool. In Study 2, a strong explanatory model was 
created whereby 40% of the variance in preschool anticipatory distress was explained. 
Parental behaviours from infancy and preschool were the strongest predictors of child 
anticipatory distress at preschool.  Child age positively predicted child anticipatory 
distress. This strongly suggests that the involvement of parents in pain management 
interventions during immunization is one of the most critical factors in predicting 
anticipatory distress to the preschool vaccination.

Abstract 
Anticipatory distress prior to a painful medical procedure can lead to negative 
sequelae including heightened pain experiences, avoidance of future medical procedures, 
and potential non-compliance with preventative healthcare such as vaccinations. Few 
studies have examined the longitudinal and concurrent predictors of pain-related 
anticipatory distress. This paper consists of two companion studies to examine both the 
longitudinal factors from infancy, as well as concurrent factors from preschool that 
predict pain-related anticipatory distress at the preschool age. Study 1 examined how well 
preschool pain-related anticipatory distress was predicted by infant pain responding at 2, 
4, 6 and 12 months of age.  In Study 2, using a developmental psychopathology 
framework, longitudinal analyses examined the predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, 
and present factors that led to the development of anticipatory distress during routine 
preschool vaccinations. A sample of 202 caregiver-child dyads was observed during their 
infant and preschool vaccinations (OUCH Cohort) and was used for both studies. In 
Study 1, pain responding during infancy was not found to significantly predict pain-
related anticipatory distress at preschool. In Study 2, a strong explanatory model was 
created whereby 40% of the variance in preschool anticipatory distress was explained. 
Parental behaviours from infancy and preschool were the strongest predictors of child 
anticipatory distress at preschool.  Child age positively predicted child anticipatory 
distress. This strongly suggests that the involvement of parents in pain management 
interventions during immunization is one of the most critical factors in predicting 
anticipatory distress to the preschool vaccination.

1. Introduction 
 
Healthy children commonly experience procedural pain from vaccinations and 
routine blood draws throughout childhood [37]. In addition to experiencing pain, many 
children also experience fear and pain-related anticipatory distress before the procedure 
even begins [24]. Pain-related anticipatory distress encompasses negative affect that may 
result in behavioural responses (e.g., crying, screaming, flailing) and physiological 
changes (e.g. increased heart rate, cortisol levels) displayed by a child prior to a painful 
medical procedure [32]. Higher fear and distress before a painful procedure have been 
associated with a number of negative sequalae including heightened pain experiences, 
avoidance of future painful medical procedures, and potential non-compliance with 
preventative healthcare such as vaccinations [5,35,36,47,49,53]. Despite the negative 
impact of pain-related anticipatory distress, there is a lack of research using longitudinal 
methodology examining the factors that contribute to its development.  
Prior to undertaking the two studies presented in the current paper, an in-depth 
systematic review synthesized the factors that predict the development of pain-related 
anticipatory distress in children [44]. In particular, a developmental psychopathology 
framework [14] was used to examine predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and 
present factors to understand the development of pain-related anticipatory distress in 
children and adolescents. While some degree of pain-related anticipatory distress would 
be considered normative, this framework still provided a strong theoretical framework for 
organizing possible variable relationships for the review and the current analysis. The 
overarching goal of the current paper is to systematically test the factors that contribute to

 the development of pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination in early childhood 
using data from an established longitudinal cohort (the OUCH [Opportunities to 
Understand Childhood Hurt] cohort). The current paper includes two companion studies: 
the first examines the relative contribution of pain from the first year of life on preschool 
pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination, while the second examines broader 
predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and present factors in one large model.  
1.1. The Current Study. 
Starting directly with pain experiences, the goal of Study 1 was to examine how 
infant pain-related distress variables from vaccinations during the first year of life predict 
pain-related anticipatory distress at the preschool vaccination. The goal of Study 2 was to 
examine longitudinal predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and present factors that 
may predict pain-related anticipatory distress at the preschool immunization. For the first 
study, we hypothesized that pre-needle distress and initial reactivity in infancy would 
positively predict pain-related anticipatory distress at the preschool age. We further 
hypothesized that less pain regulation during vaccination appointments over the first year 
would predict increased pain-related anticipatory distress at the preschool vaccinations. 
In Study 2, based on our earlier review [44] and the findings from Study 1, we 
hypothesized that cumulative pain experiences at 2 and 12 months of age and previous 
pain events would positively predict pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. Based 
on previous work [38], we also hypothesized that caregiver emotional availability at 2 
and 12 months of child age would negatively predict pain-related anticipatory distress. 
Age was hypothesized to negatively predict pain-related anticipatory distress.

 distress-promoting behaviours [7, 29] were hypothesized to positively predict pain-related 
anticipatory distress. Finally, healthcare professional distress-promoting behaviour was a 
hypothesized to positively predict pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool.     
2. Methods  
2.1. Study sample 
Participants from this study were recruited from the OUCH cohort, which has 
been observing caregiver-infant dyads from infancy to preschool [42]. At the time of the 
current study, the infancy waves were completed with a total sample size of 760 
caregiver-infant dyads. Caregiver-child dyads were initially recruited from three pediatric 
clinics in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Infants and their caregivers were recruited at 
their 2, 4, 6, or 12 month vaccinations. At the time of the current analysis, 202 parent-
child dyads were observed at the preschool time point (age 4 to 6 years) with data 
collection ongoing. Of the 202 parent-child dyads that were observed at preschool, 133 
had 2-month data, 170 had 4-month data, 175 had 6-month data, and 177 had 12-month 
data. The vast majority had 3 or 4 time points (n=170), with 32 participants having data 
from one or two time points. Full-information maximum likelihood estimation [2] was 
used so that all cases could be included, which resulted in 202 cases contributing to 
model estimations.  
Inclusion criteria for the study were that caregivers could read and speak English, 
that the infants had no suspected developmental delays or impairments or chronic 
illnesses, and had never been admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. All children were 
considered healthy, from middle class families, low-risk, and developmentally typical. At 
the preschool appointment, parents were predominantly mothers (85.1%) with some

 fathers (13.9%) and other caregivers (1.0%), and an average age of 38.91 years (SD = 
5.29). The preschool sample was 46.5% female (94) and 53.5% male (108) and was an 
average of 4.61 years (SD = 0.55). The caregivers were asked an open-ended question 
about the heritage culture that had most influenced them or an earlier generation of their 
family. A broad classification of their responses is 13.9% Canadian, 42.1% European 
(e.g. British, Italian, Polish), 11.4% Jewish, and 18.3% Asian (e.g. Chinese, Indian, 
Vietnamese). At the preschool time point, 4.5% of children were given Tylenol or EMLA 
before the needle procedure.  
2.2. Procedure 
Ethics approval was received from York University. Details of the procedure from 
the infant wave of the study have been published elsewhere [38] and here we describe the 
procedure for the preschool vaccinations. Parents who were observed during their child’s 
vaccinations were given a flyer by a medical receptionist and asked whether they would 
like to learn more about a new study. If interested, informed consent was obtained and 
the parent completed a demographic information form. Ninety percent of approached 
parents allowed us to videotape their child’s preschool vaccination. Once in the 
examination room, two video cameras were set up to capture a close-up face shot of the 
preschooler as well as a wide shot to obtain a full view of the parent and the child, both 5 
minutes prior and 5 minutes post-needle.  This footage was used to code preschool 
anticipatory distress behaviours and child verbalizations. Parents received a $5.00 coffee 
shop gift certificate for participation. At the 2, 4, 6, and 12 month vaccination 
appointments, infants received between 1 and 3 needles, with a means of 2.01 needles 
(SD=0.25).

 2.3 Apparatus 
At the preschool appointment, two Sony HDRXR260V High-Definition 
Handycam Camcorders (2012 Model) were used to record parent and child behaviour. 
One camera was hand-held by a research assistant to record the close-up image of the 
child’s face, body movements, and verbalizations. The second camera was mounted on a 
tripod and fitted with a wide-angle lens to record parent-child interactions from a 
distance. 
2.4 Measures 
2.4.1. Parent and child demographic information 
Caregivers were asked to complete a short demographic form prior to their child’s 
vaccination. Questions pertained to their age, their child’s age, their child’s sex (male 
coded as 1, female coded as 2)gender, the child’s previous medical history, their 
relationship to the child, their education level, and their self-reported heritage culture.  
2.4.2. Pain-Related Anticipatory Distress (Latent dependent variable; Study 1 and 2)  
As will be described in greater detail in the results section, child behaviour 
(FLACC), proportion of child distress verbalizations (CAMPIS-R), and child cry duration 
were used as observed indicators of a latent variable representing pain-related 
anticipatory distress in Study 1 and Study 2. Using this latent variable accounts for 
measurement error with respect to the relations of the observed indicators to the 
hypothetical construct of pain-related anticipatory distress [9]. This variable is the 
dependent variable in all the models presented in the current paper. The three indicator 
variables (FLACC, child distress verbalizations, and cry) all demonstrated appropriate 
range and variance.

 2.4.2.1. Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale 
This measure was used as a component of our latent variable. The FLACC is also 
known as the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scale [33]. The FLACC is a 
behavioural rating scale that is a valid and reliable measure of procedural pain in infants 
and young children [51] and has also demonstrated reliability, construct validity, and 
concurrent validity for baseline measurements of pain-related distress [46]. The FLACC 
consists of five behavioural indices: face, legs, arms, cry, and consolability, which are 
each rated using a scale from 0 to 2. These ratings are added together for an overall score 
between 0 and 10 for each 15-second epoch (in the current analyses it was scored for four 
epochs). Higher scores indicate higher distress intensity. For the current analyses, 
FLACC scores are presented as proportions ranging from 0 to 1. The FLACC scale was 
coded by trained coders and interrater reliability coefficients for the current study all 
exceeded .85 for the five total behaviour indices.   
2.4.2.2. Preschool distress verbalizations and cry 
The CAMPIS-R also provided two components to our latent variable for pain-
related preschool anticipatory distress. Child distress verbalizations and cry from the 
CAMPIS-R [7] were also included as indicators of the latent pain-related anticipatory 
distress variable. Videos were transcribed by research assistants and each transcript was 
reviewed by one research assistant trained in coding the CAMPIS to ensure it accurately 
reflected the content and to ensure vocalizations were spliced into codeable CAMPIS 
units. One child-caregiver dyad was excluded because no English was spoken during the 
entire interaction and the language could not be translated.  The cChild distress 
verbalizations variable is a proportion ranging from 0 to 1 of the total number of child

 verbalizations that were distress verbalizations.  Cry isand cry are presented as a 
proportion of the total time coded with scores ranging between 0 and 1. Videos were first 
coded on paper using the spliced transcript. The Observer XT (Noldus Inc.) was 
subsequently used to facilitate coding the video data. Timed-event data coding was used 
to capture data on frequency, duration, and timing of codes [3]. There were two coders 
for the study. For verbal behaviours, percent agreements were calculated from the 
transcripts that were coded with a percent agreement of 85% with a range of 71% to 98% 
agreement.  For non-verbal behaviours, reliability statistics were calculated using Noldus 
Observer XT version 11. A tolerance window of 2 seconds was used including gaps with 
an overall average percent agreement of 86% with a range of 74% to 97%.  
2.4.3. Infant predictor variables 
2.4.3.1. Infant pain-related distress (Study 1 and Study 2) 
The Modified Behaviour Pain Scale (MBPS) [48] was used to assess infant pain-
related distress for a 15-second epoch immediately prior to the first vaccination needle, 
immediately after the vaccination, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 3 minutes after the 
vaccination. This was completed for the 2, 4, 6 and 12 month vaccinations. There are 
three subsections of the scale (facial expression, cry, and body movement), each 
requiring the coder to decide on what the maximal score based on the infant’s overt 
behaviour during the 15-second epoch. All sections of the measure are summed to get an 
infant pain score out of ten. Moderate to high concurrent validity as well as item-total and 
inter-rater reliability have all been demonstrated in the vaccination context [48].  Inter-
rater reliability was high with intraclass correlations ranging from .93 to .96.

 In Study 1, the MBPS scores were used as indicators of the latent slope factor 
(operationalizing pain regulation) and intercept (operationalizing pain reactivity) factors 
in the four latent growth models (LGMs) using structural equation modeling [10]. Using a 
separate model within each age (2, 4, 6, and 12 months; see Figure 1), a latent slope 
factor represents the change in MBPS pain scores (i.e., pain regulation) from the needle 
observation across the 1-minute, 2-minute, and 3-minutes post-needle observations, 
whereas the latent intercept represents the needle pain score (i.e., reactivity or the first 
pain score immediately after the last needle). Pain-related anticipatory distress prior to 
the needle was used as a separate covariate in each model.  
In Study 2, greater parsimony was needed to represent pain experience due to the 
number of relationships to be tested in the broader model.  Thus, a cumulative pain score 
from the two most painful vaccinations (the 2- and 12-month cumulative pain scores) 
were used, as it was felt these two time points would have the highest chance of 
predictive power for preschool outcomes. In addition, both initial reactivity (intercept) or 
change in pain scores (slope) were not found to have significant predictive value in Study 
1.  Rather, than insert variables we knew not to have a relationship with the final 
dependent variable into our model, a cumulative sum score of the three pain scores were 
used such that the pain scores were reflective of the total distress expressed during the 2-
month or 12-month appointment. 
2.4.3.2. Caregiver Emotional Availability in infancy (Study 2 only) 
The emotional availability scale (EAS) [6] provides a global clinical judgment of 
caregiving behaviour. The EAS consists of four main caregiver subscales (sensitivity, 
structuring, non-intrusiveness, and non-hostility), which are summed to form an overall

 score [6]. Inter-rater reliability for the total score was calculated between each main coder 
and each of the reliability coders and intraclass correlations ranged from .80 to .93. Only 
the 2 and 12 month EAS scores were used in this study to logically parallel the infant 
pain scores used for Study 2 [38].  
2.4.4. Preschool Predictors (Study 2 only) 
2.4.4.1. Parent distress promoting verbalizations and healthcare provider verbalizations at 
preschool 
Parent and healthcare professional verbalizations for three minutes prior to the 
needle were videotaped, transcribed, and later coded using the Child-Adult Medical 
Procedure Interaction Scale-Revised (CAMPIS-R) [7]. For this study, the categories used 
from the CAMPIS-R were parent distress-promoting behaviours and healthcare 
professional distress-promoting behaviours. Scores for both categories were calculated as 
the proportion of total behaviour for each individual. These variables were created by 
summing the criticism, reassuring comment, giving control to the child, apology, and 
empathy verbalization codes that occurred three minutes prior to the vaccination. As 
above, Observer XT software (Noldus Inc, The Netherlands) was used to facilitate the 
video coding. Timed-event data coding was used to capture data on frequency, duration, 
and timing of codes [3]. Reliability for these variables an average of 85% agreement with 
a range of 71% to 98% agreement.   
2.4.4.2. Parent report of child and self-worry pre-needle (Study 2 only) 
Parents were asked to rate their own child’s worry and their own worry using a 
scale from 0 to 10, where 0 was no worry and 10 was the most worry possible.

 2.4.4.3. Number of significant painful procedures between 12 months and preschool 
(Study 2 only) 
Parents were asked to report their child’s medical history since 12 months of age 
by checking off which illnesses or conditions their child had experienced [45]. From this 
list, four significant events that are hypothesized to be painful were used to create a 
cumulative score of significant painful events. These four painful events were 
circumcision, broken bones, hospitalization, and operations. The cumulative painful 
event score ranged from 0 to 4, with a higher score indicating more previously 
experienced painful events.  
2.5 Data analysis plan 
2.5.1. Study 1: Impact of pain regulation over the first year of life on pain-related 
anticipatory distress at preschool age. 
We fitted four separate models (2, 4, 6 and 12 months) to examine whether infant 
pain-related distress reactivity (represented using a latent intercept factor described 
above) and regulation (represented using latent slope factors described above) at each of 
these age predicted child pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool.  Each model was 
estimated using full-information maximum likelihood with Mplus version 7 software 
[34]. The comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation 
(RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) evaluated 
goodness of fit for the models. CFI values of 0.95 or higher and RMSEA and SRMR 
values of 0.05 or less indicate that a model fit the data well [11]. 
All four models (i.e., using data from each of the 2, 4, 6, and 12 month 
vaccination appointments) were specified such that pain-related anticipatory distress at

 preschool was conditioned on the pre-needle pain-related distress score, the intercept 
factor (needle pain reactivity), and the change in infant pain-related distress across the 
appointment (i.e. infant pain regulation or slope factor from immediately after the needle 
to 3-minutes post needle). To account for the non-linear pattern in the MBPS scores 
across the vaccination appointment, the slope factor loadings were set to 0 at needle, 
freely estimated for 1 and 2 minutes post-needle, and set to 1 for 3 minutes post-needle 
(i.e., a “freed-loading” model to produce a series of linear splines)[10]. Because the slope 
factor loading was set to zero for the needle pain score, the intercept factor represents the 
pain-related distress mean at needle in all models. Given multiple comparisons made in 
the LGM analyses, a Bonferroni correction was applied. Using a family-wise error rate of 
 = .05 and four analyses, the criteria of p < .0125 was used for the LGM analyses. See 
Figure 1 for details.    
2.5.2. Study 2: Impact of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and present factors on 
pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool age. 
First, correlations among the independent variables (MBPS baseline at 2 and 12 
months, MBPS post-needle at 2 and 12 months, MBPS 1 minute at 2 and 12 months, 
healthcare professional distress-promoting behaviour, caregiver distress-promoting 
behaviour, sexgender, age, child worry, parent worry, painful events, caregiver sensitivity 
at 2 months, and caregiver sensitivity at 12 months) were examined to determine which 
relationships to include in the final model. The prediction of pain-related anticipatory 
distress from longitudinal and concurrent factors was then modeled using SEM so that 
certain constructs (child pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool, 2 month 
cumulative distress, and 12 month cumulative distress) could be represented by latent

 variables with multiple observed indicators [11]. The models were estimated using full-
information maximum likelihood with Mplus version 7.31 [34]. Model fit was evaluated 
using the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation 
(RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). CFI values of 0.95 or 
higher and RMSEA and SRMR values of 0.05 or less indicate that a model has a good fit 
to the data [11].  
The final model was specified such that the preschool pain-related anticipatory 
distress latent variable was conditioned on infant cumulative distress at 2 and 12-months, 
caregiver emotional availability at 2 months, caregiver emotional availability at 12 
months, age, sexgender, pain events, parent worry, child worry, parent distress promoting 
behaviours, and healthcare professional distress promoting behaviours. See Figure 2.   
3. Results 
3.1 Study 1: Predicting pain-related anticipatory distress from infant pain responses 
The means, standard deviations, and correlations among variables at 2, 4, 6, and 
12 months of age are presented in Tables 1 to 4. Four models (one for each age of infant 
vaccination) were estimated with slope (pain regulation) and intercept (pain reactivity) 
latent growth factors. These four models were expanded to include the latent preschool 
pain-related anticipatory distress variable as the outcome.  Figure 1 shows a visual of the 
Latent Growth Models estimated at each age (2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age).   
3.1.1. Impact of pre-needle pain-related distress, pain reactivity, and pain regulation at 2 
months on preschool pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination.  
The mean MBPS scores for infant pain-related distress at 2 months of age 
decreased from 8.79 at needle to 5.47 at 3 minutes post-needle. Pre-needle pain-related

 distress at 2 months was also included as a predictor of preschool pain-related 
anticipatory distress. Because there was minimal variability in infant needle pain at the 
two-month time point (the majority of infants had high pain-related distress), the residual 
variance for MBPS at needle was constrained to zero to avoid obtaining an improper 
negative residual variance estimate. The combination of fit indices suggested that this 
model fit the data well (CFI= 1.0, RMSEA = .01, SRMR=.05). Both standardized and 
unstandardized estimates are represented in Table 5. 
The mean of the linear slope factor was negative and significant (p < .001), 
indicating that the change in pain-related distress scores decreased on average following 
the needle. There was no significant relationship between the pain reactivity and pain 
regulation. Pain reactivity and pain regulation did not predict pain-related anticipatory 
distress (p = .06 and p = .25). The pre-needle pain-related distress score at two months 
did not predict pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool (p = .82). This model 
accounted for only 3% of the variance in pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. 
3.1.2. Impact of pre-needle pain-related distress, pain reactivity, and pain regulation at 4 
months on preschool pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination. 
The mean values for infant pain-related distress at 4 months of age decreased 
from 8.47 at needle to 4.30 at 3 minutes post-needle. Pre-needle pain-related distress at 4 
months was also entered as a predictor of preschool pain-related anticipatory distress. 
Since there was minimal variability in infant needle pain-related distress at the 4-month 
time point (the majority of infants displayed high pain-related distress), the residual 
variance for pain-related distress at needle was constrained to zero to avoid obtaining an 
improper negative residual variance estimate. The combination of fit indices suggested

 that this model fit the data well (CFI= 1.0, RMSEA = .002, SRMR=.04). Both 
standardized and unstandardized estimates are represented in Table 6. 
The mean of the linear slope factor was negative and significant (p < .001), 
indicating that the change in pain-related distress scores decreased on average following 
the needle. The pain reactivity and pain regulation were not significantly related at 4 
months of age (p = .04). Using the Bonferroni-corrected  of .0125, pain reactivity did 
not predict preschool pain-related anticipatory distress (p =.03) and neither did pain 
regulation (p = .01). It should be noted that although the p-value for pain regulation was 
below .125 for the standardized estimate, it was not for the unstandardized estimate (p = 
.014). As such a conservative approach was taken to not deem this value significant. The 
pre-needle pain-related distress score at 4 months did not predict pain-related anticipatory 
distress at preschool (B = .06, p = .54). This model accounted for 10% of the variance in 
pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. 
3.1.3. Impact of pre-needle pain-related distress, pain reactivity, and pain regulation at 6 
months on preschool pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination. 
The mean values for infant pain-related distress at 6 months of age decreased 
from 8.50 at needle 3.97 at 3 minutes post-needle. Pre-needle pain-related distress at 6 
months was also included as a predictor of preschool pain-related anticipatory distress. 
Since there was minimal variability in infant needle pain at the six-month time point (the 
majority of infants had high pain-related distress), the residual variance for pain-related 
distress at needle was constrained to 0 to avoid obtaining an improper negative residual 
variance estimate. The combination of fit indices suggested that the model fit was good

 (CFI = .98, RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .05). Both standardized and unstandardized 
estimates are represented in Table 7. 
The mean of the linear slope factor was negative and significant (p < .001), 
indicating that the change in pain-related distress scores decreased on average following 
the needle. There was no significant relationship between pain reactivity and pain 
regulation at 6 months. The intercept (p = .29), slope (p = .22) and pre-needle pain-
related distress score (p = .60) at 6 months did not significantly predict pain-related 
anticipatory distress. This model accounted for only 3% of the variance in pain-related 
anticipatory distress at preschool. 
3.1.4.  Impact of pre-needle pain-related distress, pain reactivity, and pain regulation at 
12 months on preschool pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination. 
The mean values for infant pain-related distress at 12 months decreased from 8.23 
at needle to 4.38 at 3 minutes post needle. Pre-needle pain-related distress at 12 months 
was also entered as an independent predictor of preschool pain-related anticipatory 
distress. The combination of fit indices suggested that this model fit the data relatively 
well (CFI = .96, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .06). Both standardized and unstandardized 
estimates are represented in Table 8. 
The mean of the linear slope factor was negative and significant (p < .001), 
indicating that the change in pain-related distress scores was decreasing over time. There 
was no significant relationship between the pain reactivity and pain regulation at 12 
months. Pain reactivity (p = .06) and the pain regulation did not predict preschool pain-
related anticipatory distress (p = .75). The pre-needle pain-related distress score at 12

model accounted for 3% of the variance in pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. 
3.2 Study 2: Predicting pain-related anticipatory distress from predisposing, precipitating, 
perpetuating, and present factors.  
3.2.1. Relationships among key variables 
Correlations among key variables are presented in Table 9 for completeness. 
There were positive relationships among the baseline, needle, and one-minute pain scores 
at 2 months of age and at 12 months of age (see Table 9). Significant correlations were 
used to determine the relationships included in the final SEM model.  
3.2.2. Measurement model of latent variables 
Baseline MBPS, needle MBPS scores, and one-minute post-needle MBPS scores 
at 2-months were used as observed indicators of a 2-month cumulative distress latent 
variable whereas baseline MBPS, needle MBPS scores, and one-minute post-needle 
MBPS scores at 12-months were used as indicators of a 12-month cumulative distress 
latent variable. For the preschool pain-related anticipatory distress latent variable, 
FLACC scores, child distress behaviours, and cry were used. The combination of fit 
indices suggested that this model fit the datay well (RMSEA = <.001, SRMR=.04, 
CFI=1.0). Parameter estimates are presented in Table 10.  
3.2.3. Final model predicting pain-related anticipatory distress 
The final model was specified such that the preschool pain-related anticipatory 
distress latent variable was regressed on the 2- and 12-month cumulative distress latent 
variables as well as pain events, caregiver EA at 2 months, caregiver EA at 12 months, 
child age, child sexgender, caregiver distress-promoting behaviour, healthcare provider

 distress-promoting behaviour, child worry, and parent worry. The final model depicted in 
Figure 2 fit the data well (CFI = 1.0; RMSEA = <.001, SRMR = .06). Completely 
standardized parameter estimates and correlations are presented in the text and Figure 1, 
while both standardized and unstandardized estimates are represented in Table 11.  
3.2.4. Relationships among predictor variables 
Based on a systematic review [44], the model was specified to include certain 
directional relationships among predictors. As was seen in the simple bivariate 
correlations, there were several significant relationships among predisposing, 
precipitating, perpetuating, and present factors (see Table 9). Both theoretical and 
statistical ( i.e. significant bivariate correlations) were the criteria used for including a 
variable in the final model and for examining directional relationships among predictors. 
Cumulative distress at 12-months of age positively predicted parent report of child worry 
at preschool (B = .23, p = .01), whereby children who expressed more distress at 12-
months had parents who rated them as more worried at preschool. In addition, parent self-
report of worry was positively related to parent report of child worry (B = .23, p = .002). 
Parent worry at preschool negatively predicted healthcare provider distress-promoting 
behaviour (B = -.13, p = .01). Caregiver emotional availability at 2 months was 
negatively related to cumulative distress at 2 months (B = -.36, p = .001). Caregiver EA 
at 12 months was negatively related to cumulative distress at 12 months (B = -.41, p < 
.001). Caregiver EA and 2 and 12 months were positively related (B = .42, p < .001). 
3.2.5. Factors predicting pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool 
The R2 for child pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool was .404 (p <

 was explained by the set of latent and observed predictors. As seen in Table 11, caregiver 
distress-promoting behaviour positively predicted child pain-related anticipatory distress 
at preschool (B = .49, p < .001), whereby caregivers who used more distress-promoting 
behaviour had children who displayed more pain-related anticipatory distress. Caregiver 
distress-promoting behaviour at the preschool vaccination appointment uniquely 
accounted for 19.3% of the variance in child pain-related anticipatory distress at 
preschool. Child age positively predicted preschool pain-related anticipatory distress (B = 
.15, p = .01), uniquely accounting for 2.0% of pain-related anticipatory distress variance. 
Caregiver EA from the 2 month vaccination appointment positively predicted preschool 
pain-related anticipatory distress (B = .35, p = .02) and 12 month vaccination 
appointment negatively predicted child pain-related anticipatory distress (B = -.33, p = 
.01), explaining 6.4% and 6.1% of the variance in preschool pain-related anticipatory 
distress, respectively.  
4. Discussion 
The objective of the current paper using two companion analyses was to examine 
the relative contribution of vaccination pain and distress responses from the first year of 
life (Study 1) as well as broader longitudinal factors (predisposing, precipitating, 
perpetuating, and present) on pain-related anticipatory distress to vaccination at the 
preschool age (Study 2). In Study 1, using a sequential cohort design and a substantial 
sample of over 200 participants, our results demonstrated that vaccination pain and 
distress responses over the first year of life did not predict preschool pain-related 
anticipatory distress. In Study 2, which tested a model that encompassed broader child 
and contextual factors, 40% of the variance in preschool pain-related anticipatory distress

 was accounted for. Ultimately, concurrent parent behaviours during the preschool pre-
needle epoch predicted the majority of the variance, followed by parent emotional 
availability during 2 and 12 months, and finally child age at preschool (ranging between 
4 and 6 years of age).  
4.1. Study 1: Impact of infant pain responses on preschool pain-related pain-related.  
 
The four models from Study 1 showed that pre-needle pain-related distress, pain 
reactivity, and pain regulation at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age did not predict pain-related 
anticipatory distress at preschool. These findings were not in line with hypotheses, which 
predicted that higher pre-needle pain-related distress, higher pain reactivity, and poor 
pain regulation during infancy would be associated with increased pain-related 
anticipatory distress at the preschool age. These findings suggest that pain-related 
anticipatory distress does not demonstrate continuity in its development (i.e. infant pre-
needle distress was not related to preschool pre-needle distress). With regards to pain 
reactivity, infants during the first year of life may not have yet developed the ability to 
build lasting cognitive schemas to make the association from relatively rare events in 
infancy to preschool events. Although pain regulation across infancy was not found to 
predict pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool, it should be noted that the 
relationship just missed significance at 4 months using our stringent alpha level 
(explaining roughly 10% of the variance in pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool) 
suggesting that experiencing high levels of distress immediately following routine 
vaccination and not demonstrating a capacity towards regulation at 4months may have 
some relationship with pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. Four months of age 
is a critical time in infant development when the inhibitory mechanisms of the central

 nervous system are beginning to develop, yet the infant does still not seem to yet have the 
cognitive capacity to directly encode a complex emotional reaction such as experiencing 
distress from anticipating future pain based on past pain [28]. This reinforces the need to 
start scaffolding the regulation of infant distress (i.e. pain management strategies) from 
the very beginning of life.  
4.2 Study 2: Longitudinal and concurrent factors predicting pain-related anticipatory 
distress  
 
Ultimately the results from Study 1 demonstrate the importance of taking a 
broader approach to examining the predictors of pain-related anticipatory distress at the 
preschool age [44]. In line with the developmental psychopathology framework, Study 2 
examined which predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and present factors predicted 
child pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. 
4.2.1. Predisposing factors 
Similar to findings in Study 1, cumulative distress from infancy did not predict 
pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool. It may be that these pain experiences 
occurred when the infant was too young to form declarative memories (or too infrequent 
and brief to trigger a lasting non-declarative memory) to have an impact on the child’s 
cognitive appraisal of the vaccination as threatening at preschool. Additionally, previous 
research on needle phobia has demonstrated onset at the preschool age, indicating that 
direct conditioning from events at that age, rather than earlier, may be a significant 
contributor [32, 17]. The lack of a sexgender effect is in line with findings from a 
previous review [44]. Our findings regarding age may be related to older children having

 more ability to retrieve and experience a complex emotional reaction such as expressing 
distress in anticipation of pain based on previous experience with pain.  
The only variable from the infant vaccinations that predicted pain-related 
anticipatory distress was caregiver emotional availability (EA) both at 2 and 12 months 
of age. The finding for 12 month EA is consistent with developmental literature 
suggesting that caregiver sensitivity to distress is related to fewer behavioural problems, 
higher social competence, and better affect regulation [27]. Contrary to hypotheses, 
higher emotional availability at 2-months predicted higher pain-related anticipatory 
distress at preschool. We know from previous work there is minimal variability in pain 
scores at the 2 month vaccination [40] and that caregiver sensitivity is strongly related 
over the first year of life [38]. Perhaps being highly sensitive at 2 months reflects a 
predisposition to amplify distress signalling in later childhood. It is clear that over time 
by meeting their child’s needs through subsequent vaccinations, dyads often develop 
secure attachment relationships and lead to EAS at 12 months of age predicting lower 
anticipatory distress. This discrepancy in findings between 2 and 12 months may also be 
a random association due to type I error.   
4.2.2. Precipitating factors 
Having more painful events during childhood (i.e. surgery, circumcision, 
hospitalization, and broken bones) did not significantly predict pain-related anticipatory 
distress. Previous research has shown that general and specific negative pain events can 
generalize to the development of fear and anxiety to painful medical procedures [5,24, 
36], although this is not uniformly the case [21, 23,29, 31]. Perhaps rare painful medical

 events over early childhood are not predictive of pain-related anticipatory distress to 
vaccination. 
4.2.3.Perpetuating factors.  
The perpetuating or concurrent factors that would maintain the anticipatory 
anxiety at preschool included parent worry prior to vaccination, parent report of child 
worry prior to vaccination, and parent distress-promoting behaviours during the pre-
needle period, which were all hypothesized to positively predict pain-related anticipatory 
distress. Study 2 found that only parent behavior positively predicted pain-related 
anticipatory distress at preschool. This result is consistent with previous research 
demonstrating that caregiver distress-promoting verbalizations are strong predictors of 
worry and anxiety in children [13, 15]. 
In terms of relationships among the perpetuating variables, parental worry 
negatively predicted healthcare provider distress-promoting behaviour. This suggests that 
healthcare providers may be more attuned to avoid distress-promoting behaviors towards 
the child when parents communicate worry. Parents’ own worry also positively predicted 
their report of their child’s worry. This finding supports previous research with the same 
sample that has shown that parental factors have an impact on parental report of child 
pain-related distress [39]. 
4.2.4. Present factors 
Finally, findings Study 2 did not support the hypothesis that healthcare 
professional distress-promoting behaviour positively predicts pain-related anticipatory 
distress at preschool. This may be a result of low healthcare professional interaction and 
the limited sample of health care professionals coded in this study. Future research should

 include a larger number of health professionals that can better represent the population of 
immunizing health professionals.  
4.3. Conclusions 
To our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine both longitudinal and 
concurrent factors that predict pain-related anticipatory distress in preschool-aged 
children. Results from the two companion analyses indicate that early pain responses 
have a limited impact on the development of pain-related anticipatory distress. During 
infancy, the caregiver has been described as the most important context for the infant in 
pain [41]. Results from Study 2 suggest that at preschool age, the caregiver continues to 
be one of the most important factors in predicting pain-related anticipatory distress. 
Concurrent parent behaviour has been shown to be associated with pain-related 
anticipatory distress during painful medical procedures across childhood [8,15,16,20,29]. 
However, this study is the first to establish using longitudinal data that caregiver 
behaviour during vaccination from the first year of life and at the preschool age are both 
associated with pain-related anticipatory distress at preschool- significantly more than the 
child’s own behaviours. Concurrent parent distress promoting behaviour at preschool was 
by far the most significant predictor of child pain-related anticipatory distress at 
preschool, which substantiates the critical role of parents during vaccination 
appointments in early childhood. The directionality of this relationship should be the 
subject of future research. This paper substantiates the critical role of parents during 
vaccination appointments throughout early childhood. We have established in earlier 
work that pain-related anticipatory distress increases pain-related distress post-needle [1], 
yet there is currently little evidence that parent-led interventions can be effective for

 reducing child distress during vaccinations [30, 43]. Interventions that target increasing 
caregiver sensitivity in the first year of life and increasing coping promoting behaviours 
at the preschool age are needed.  More research is needed on interventions relating to 
parental coaching for their children’s vaccinations.  
4.4. Limitations and future directions  
Caregivers from the current study self-selected to be associated with a 
longitudinal study and had higher education, affecting the potential generalizability of the 
study. Additionally, previous research has shown that temperament [22, 26] and pre-
existing child psychopathology [12,18,19,25,52] may be important predisposing factors 
of child pain-related anticipatory distress that were not examined in the current study. 
Given challenges of self-report on anxiety and pain scales for preschool-aged children 
[50], child self-report was not used in the current study. Alternate methods of assessing 
child distress, including age-appropriate self-report tools and physiology (e.g., heart rate) 
will be important areas for future investigation.
