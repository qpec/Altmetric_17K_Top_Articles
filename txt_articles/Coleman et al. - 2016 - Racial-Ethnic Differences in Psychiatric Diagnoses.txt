Abstract
 Objective—The objective of this study is to characterize racial/ethnic variation in mental 
health diagnoses and treatments in large not-for-profit healthcare systems.
 Method—Participating systems were 11 private, not-for-profit healthcare organizations 
constituting the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) and had a combined 7,523,956 
patients aged 18 years or older, who received care during 2011. Rates of diagnoses, psychotropic 
medications, and formal psychotherapy sessions received were obtained from insurance claims 
and electronic medical record databases across all healthcare settings.
 Results—Of the 7,523,956 patients in the study, 1,169,993 (15.6%) received a mental health 
diagnosis in 2011. This varied significantly by race/ethnicity with Native American/Alaskan 
Native patients having the highest rates of any diagnosis (20.6%) and Asians having the lowest 
rates (7.5%). Among patients with a mental health diagnosis, 73% (n = 850,585) received a 
psychotropic medication. Non-Hispanic white patients were significantly more likely (77.8%) than 
other racial/ethnic groups (range 61.5% to 74.0%) to receive medication. In contrast, only 34% of 
patients with a mental health diagnosis (n = 548,837) received formal psychotherapy. Racial/ethnic 
differences were most pronounced for depression and schizophrenia where non-Hispanic blacks 
were 20% more likely to receive formal psychotherapy for their depression and 2.64 times more 
likely to receive formal psychotherapy for their schizophrenia when compared to whites.
 Conclusions—There were significant racial/ethnic differences in diagnosis and treatment of 
mental health conditions across 11 U.S. healthcare systems. Further study is needed to understand 
underlying causes of these observed differences and whether processes and outcomes of care are 
equitable across these diverse patient populations.

  Introduction
It is estimated that at least 25% of adults 18 and older in the U.S suffer from some type of 
mental health condition at any one time1. The most common are depression and anxiety1. 
Mental health conditions lead to greater disability than other chronic illnesses and cost the 
U.S. as much as 300 billion dollars annually2,3. A number of reports have detailed racial/
ethnic differences in diagnosis of mental health conditions, most of which rely on survey 
responses from both patients and providers4. In general, survey-reported rates of depression 
are lower in non-Hispanic black and Hispanic patients than their non-Hispanic white 
counterparts5,6. In contrast, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic patients are more than three 
times as llikely as non-Hispanic whites to be diagnosed with schizophrenia across a number 
of settings including community and academic medical centers7–10.
Treatment for mental health conditions also varies by race/ethnicity. Individuals of racial/
ethnic minorities who are diagnosed with any mental health condition are less likely than 
non-Hispanic whites to receive a medication for their condition5, 11–13. Like the findings for 
diagnoses, most of the treatment studies are also based upon survey reports from patients 
and providers. The evidence that exists for the accuracy of patient reported medical 
treatment is mixed and depends upon the treatment being delivered14,15. Major treatment 
modalities such as surgery are much more accurately reported than receiving a prescription 
for a condition16. Physician reported care practices are much less studied, with the limited 
evidence suggesting that physician self-reported treatment does not match that recorded in 
the medical record17.
The few published studies that have examined actual prescription patterns (rather than data 
gathered from surveys) have found conflicting results. One found lower prescription rates 
for racial/ethnic minority Veterans with serious mental illness compared to their non-
Hispanic white counterparts11, while another large study of Medicaid patients from 42 states 
suggested that the off-label use of antipsychotic drugs is greater in racial/ethnic minorities19. 
These disparate findings are likely due to a number of differences among patient 
populations, treatment practices, and healthcare system guidelines. Racial/Ethnic variation in 
the use of psychotherapy is even less well understood. Like the pharmacotherapy literature, 
there are equivocal findings about differences in psychotherapy use by racial/ethnic 
minorities20–23.
The current study is designed to address two major gaps in the literature. First, most 
available evidence for racial/ethnic differences in mental healthcare is based on national 
surveys asking patients/caregivers to self-report their own care and providers to self-report 
their practices24–26. By contrast, our study used medical and pharmacy record data on rates 
of diagnoses, medications dispensed, and formal psychotherapy sessions attended. Second, 
the few studies of diagnosis and treatment patterns using electronic medical records are from 
a narrow cross-section of providers and systems, relatively small samples of racial/ethnic 
minority patients, and/or reflect a large proportion of patients receiving federally subsidized 
care (Veterans Health Affairs11 and Medicaid19). Using data from 2011, our study is 
designed to expand the evidence for differences in race/ethnicity in mental health diagnoses

 and treatment in a large, geographically diverse and racially/ethnically representative sample 
of over 7.5 million patients enrolled in 11 healthcare systems across the U.S.
 Methods
 Settings
Data for this study were obtained from the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), a 
nation-wide consortium of public-domain research centers based in large, not-for-profit 
healthcare systems in the U.S. At the time that data analyses were conducted, these systems 
provided both private, primarily commercial, and subsidized public insurance coverage and 
healthcare to over 10 million people living in 11 states27. All healthcare systems have 
meaningful use-compliant electronic medical records. Table 1 provides basic descriptors for 
each of the systems included in this study.
For all systems, electronic medical records, insurance claims, and other data systems were 
organized in a Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW) to facilitate population-based research28. 
Protected health information remains at each healthcare system, but sites apply common 
data definitions and formats to ensure equivalent de-identified data for analysis. Only 
frequencies are shared between institutions for analyses. Institutional Review Boards at each 
healthcare system approved the methods for this study.
 Patients
Patients were selected for the study if they were continuously enrolled members of their 
health plan for at least 10 months in 2011, had medical and prescription drug coverage for at 
least 10 months of that year, and were aged 18 years and older (n = 7,523,956). Of this 
population, 15.6% had at least one mental health diagnosis in 2011 (n = 1,169,993). These 
patients were used for analyses of medication and formal psychotherapy utilization.
 Measures
 Race and Ethnicity—Self-reported race/ethnicity was obtained from the VDW. All 
healthcare systems were implementing meaningful use requirements29 to collect self-
reported race/ethnicity from their members in 2011. Typically, new and current members 
were asked to complete a self-report form that included separate questions for both their race 
and ethnicity. These forms were included in both membership applications and at clinical 
outpatient visits. Responses from both sources were entered into the electronic medical 
record by healthcare system staff. Choices for race and ethnicity recorded by the VDW are 
standardized across healthcare systems and follow national recommendations for mutually 
exclusive race categories.30,31
Regardless of the race category they endorsed, patients self-reporting Hispanic ethnicity 
were considered Hispanic according to recommendations from a national survey of 
Hispanics living in the U.S. that Hispanic people considered themselves a race of people and 
not an ethnicity3. If a patient’s records contained two or more race categories (rather than a 
single category of “mixed race”), they were assigned the least prevalent race category in the 
U.S. population. For example, if a patient indicated they were both Native Hawaiian/Pacific

 Islander and non-Hispanic black, they were categorized as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 
in our analyses. This was done to maximize our ability to understand differences in 
diagnoses and treatment for the least represented racial/ethnic minority patients. This is a 
convention used for analyses using the VDW.28
 Mental health diagnoses—Data for mental health diagnoses were obtained from all 
encounters in both electronic medical records and insurance claims. Claims data contained 
information from contracted facilities and physicians who billed the healthcare systems. We 
abstracted diagnoses made by any healthcare provider in primary care, psychiatry, 
emergency department, and inpatient settings for our analyses. Standard ICD-9 codes were 
used to define the following mental health conditions: depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, 
attention deficit disorders, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, other psychoses, 
substance use disorders, and dementia. Patients were counted in each category for which 
they had a diagnosis. This meant that an individual patient could be counted more than once 
in our analyses if they had multiple mental health conditions.
 Pharmacy records—Information on filled pharmacy prescriptions was extracted from 
electronic medical records and pharmacy claims. We collected information on drugs in the 
following classes: antidepressants, stimulants, lithium, anticonvulsants, first and second 
generation antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics, and other anxiolytics. Results 
for pharmacotherapy were referred to as rates of “receiving” a drug for a mental health 
condition which meant that the patient or caregiver paid for the prescription (i.e. filled the 
prescription).
 Psychotherapy treatment—Procedure codes were captured by claims and/or 
electronic medical records data. We defined formal psychotherapy treatment using current 
procedural terminology (CPT) codes: diagnostic interviews and assessments, individual 
psychotherapy, insight-oriented, at least 45 – 80 minutes, and individual psychotherapy, 
interactive with equipment/devices/non-verbal communication, at least 45 – 80 minutes. We 
excluded any treatment that was less than 30 minutes and/or clearly designated as 
medication management only. In the healthcare systems included in this study, visits less 
than 30 minutes in length are rarely used for formal psychotherapy. We did not exclude 
visits where medication management occurred, however, we required that there also be an 
indication of psychotherapy.
 Analyses
Rates of diagnosis, pharmacy fills and psychotherapy treatment were adjusted for healthcare 
site and presented across a number of mental health conditions by race/ethnicity. These rates 
are compared statistically with non-Hispanic whites as the referent group using odds ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals. Data are presented for all mental health conditions combined 
and individually for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and other 
psychoses. Autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit disorders, substance use disorders, 
and dementia diagnoses were only included in the analyses of overall rates of mental health 
conditions because of their low prevalence in our population.

  Results
 Patients
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for patients included in the study and the systems in 
which they were treated. Of the 7,523,956 patients in the study, 45% were non-Hispanic 
white, 17% were Hispanic, 10% were Asian, 8% were non-Hispanic black, 1% were Native 
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.4% Native American/Alaskan Native, 0.1% mixed race/
ethnicity, and 20% were of unknown race/ethnicity. Patients were primarily 40 – 64 years 
old (48%), had estimated annual incomes above $40,000 (72%), and 18.5% had Medicare 
and/or Medicaid insurance as their primary coverage for healthcare.
 Diagnoses
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics, and odds ratios with confidence intervals adjusted for 
healthcare site for comparisons of diagnosis rates for non-Hispanic whites to the other races/
ethnicities. The overall diagnosis rate for any mental health condition was 16% (n = 
1,169,993). Specifically, 20.6% among Native American/Alaskan Natives (highest), 19.8% 
among non-Hispanic whites, 14.3% among Hispanics, 13.5% among non-Hispanic blacks, 
9.1% among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders, 14.6% among mixed race/ethnicity, 
7.5% among Asians (lowest), and 12.0% among those with unknown or missing race/
ethnicity. In general, when compared to non-Hispanic whites, most racial/ethnic minorities 
had much lower rates of diagnosed mental health conditions (ranging from 64% lower in 
Asians to 28% lower in Hispanics). The exception was Native American/Alaskan Native 
patients who had slightly higher rates of diagnoses (1.03; CI = 1.01, 1.06). Although 
diagnoses for specific mental health conditions such as depression and schizophrenia 
appeared to mirror these findings, there was one clear exception. Non-Hispanic blacks were 
nearly twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to receive a schizophrenia diagnosis (1.98; CI 
= 1.89, 2.07).
 Pharmacotherapy
Rates of receiving a psychotropic medication when diagnosed with a mental health condition 
are shown in Table 3. Of all patients with a mental health diagnosis in 2011, 73% (n = 
850,585) received a psychotropic medication in the same year. Across mental health 
conditions, after adjusting for healthcare site, racial/ethnic minorities were much less likely 
to receive a psychotropic medication than non-Hispanic whites (range from 52% less likely 
in non-Hispanic blacks to 19% less likely in Native American/Alaskan Natives). In general, 
this pattern was the same when individual mental health conditions were examined with the 
exception of schizophrenia and other psychosis. Only non-Hispanic black patients were less 
likely to receive medication than whites (.65; CI = .56, .75) for their schizophrenia and only 
Asian (.84; CI = .73, .96) and non-Hispanic black (.86; CI = .77, .95) patients were less 
likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive a medication for other psychosis. Native 
American/Alaskan Natives had similar rates of receiving a medication when compared to 
non-Hispanic whites for almost all mental health conditions except depression.

  Formal Psychotherapy
Rates of receiving formal psychotherapy for any mental health condition are shown in Table 
4. Thirty-four percent (n = 548,837) received formal psychotherapy. This is less than half the 
rate of receiving a psychotropic medications (73%). Unlike diagnoses and pharmacotherapy, 
there were no clear differences in receiving formal psychotherapy across races/ethnicities. 
Across combined mental health conditions, after adjusting for healthcare site, only Asians (.
93; CI = .91, .94) had lower rates of formal psychotherapy use in comparison to non-
Hispanic whites. The remaining groups of patients had similar rates (Hispanics .99; CI = .98, 
1.00) or higher rates (range 10% higher in Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander to 55% 
higher in patients with mixed race heritage) of receiving formal psychotherapy when 
compared to non-Hispanic whites.
This overall pattern varied widely by specific mental health condition. For example, all 
racial/ethnic minorities were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive formal 
psychotherapy for their depression (range 4% higher in Asians to 42% higher in patients 
with mixed race heritage). However, rates of receiving formal psychotherapy for bipolar 
disorder were generally lower than non-Hispanic whites (18% lower for Native Hawaiian/
Other Pacific Islander to 33% lower for Asians and Hispanics). Interestingly non-Hispanic 
blacks had the same rates of formal psychotherapy compared to whites for their bipolar 
disorder (in contrast to lower rates of medication use for this disorder). Except for Hispanics, 
all races/ethnicities were more likely to receive formal psychotherapy for their schizophrenia 
than non-Hispanic whites (range 67% higher in Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders to 
1.64 times higher in non-Hispanic blacks).
 Discussion
We found that the prevalence rates for depression and anxiety diagnoses among insured 
patients at 11 large private, not-for-profit healthcare systems across the U.S. were lower in 
racial/ethnic minority patients compared to non-Hispanic whites. This is consistent with 
some previous reports5. The one exception was Native American/Alaskan Native members 
whose prevalence rates for these conditions were similar to those of non-Hispanic whites. 
Some of these differences were pronounced such as Asian members being 68% less likely 
than non-Hispanic white members to receive a diagnosis of depression. As in previous 
studies, we also found that non-Hispanic blacks were nearly twice as likely as non-Hispanic 
whites to be diagnosed with schizophrenia7.
Regarding pharmacotherapy for these conditions, we found wide variation in rates of use for 
depression and anxiety across races/ethnicities, with non-Hispanic whites consistently 
higher than all other races/ethnicities. Asians not only were much less likely to receive a 
diagnosis of depression but when diagnosed, were 55% less likely than non-Hispanic whites 
to receive a medication to treat this condition. In contrast with findings from a decade ago, 
we found no significant differences in use of psychotropic drugs across racial/ethnic groups 
with schizophrenia and other psychosis11, 32, 33. One reason for this difference may be that 
the previous studies focused on patients from the Veterans Health Administration7, 11, 34 or 
Medicaid19, 35, 36 which tend to serve the most disadvantaged patients. The one exception to 
this finding was in non-Hispanic blacks who were 35% less likely than whites to receive a

 medication for their schizophrenia even though they were nearly twice as likely as whites to 
receive this diagnosis. Finally, with respect to bipolar disorder, there were still large 
differences between racial/ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic whites in the likelihood of 
receipt of medication. This difference was most pronounced in Native Hawaiian/Other 
Pacific Islanders (49% less likely) and non-Hispanic blacks (46% less likely).
We also found that the likelihood of receiving formal psychotherapy for any mental health 
condition, regardless of racial/ethnic heritage, was much lower than for receiving 
pharmacotherapy (34% vs. 73%). This is consistent with the recent trends in treatment of 
mental health conditions reported by Olfson and colleagues38, 39. Across mental health 
conditions, formal psychotherapy rates were similar (Asians and Hispanics) or higher for 
racial/ethnic minorities compared to non-Hispanic whites. Most of these differences were 
primarily due to variation in rates of formal psychotherapy treatment for depression and 
schizophrenia. This is consistent with reports in the literature that non-Hispanic black 
patients were more likely than non-Hispanic white patients to prefer psychotherapy over 
medications for treatment of their depression22.
Although we found large statistical differences among races/ethnicities in receiving formal 
psychotherapy for schizophrenia treatment (non-Hispanic blacks were 2.64 times more 
likely to receive formal psychotherapy than whites), it is difficult to determine whether these 
differences are clinically meaningful because the overall rate of psychotherapy treatment for 
serious mental illness was very low (0 – 3%). Although pharmacotherapy is the treatment of 
choice for serious mental illness, there are clinical recommendations that suggest, especially 
at the first onset of symptoms, that psychotherapy can be very effective40,41. Our data 
suggest this is an opportunity for improving services for these patients.
Our study does not provide answers to why racial/ethnic differences in the diagnosis and 
treatment of mental health conditions persist, especially for non-Hispanic black patients. 
There are many patient- and provider-level factors that could contribute to these findings. 
There is some evidence that certain cultures prefer complementary and alternative medicine 
(i.e. herbal remedies) to allopathic pharmacotherapy for treatment of depression or 
anxiety42,43. In addition, other factors such as immigration status44, language preference23, 
socioeconomic status 11, and having subsidized insurance23 have all been related to whether 
a patient is diagnosed with a mental health condition and subsequently prescribed 
medication.
Provider-level factors have also been shown to account for differences in diagnosis and 
treatment of mental health conditions. For example, some reports indicate that when 
providers are presented with the same mental health symptoms (i.e. irritability, violent 
outbursts, anger), they are much more likely to diagnose non-Hispanic blacks with bipolar 
disorder or schizophrenia; while non-Hispanic whites often receive a diagnosis of major 
depression45, 46. In addition, limited access to therapists who speak the patient’s preferred 
language will likely determine whether or not these patients receive psychotherapy.
There are a number of limitations with the present study that should be considered when 
interpreting our findings. Because we did not have individual-level data to analyze, we could

 not account for other factors that have been shown to determine racial/ethnic minority 
differences in diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions such as socioeconomic 
status and acculturation/generational status7, 11, 23,47. If we had adjusted for these factors we 
may have found different results. To this point, a large study from national data sources 
found that patient self-reported, unadjusted rates of utilization of psychotherapy services 
were lower for Hispanics when compared to non-Hispanic whites and blacks.23 However, 
when these rates were adjusted for other demographic factors, English language preference 
and not Hispanic ethnicity was the strongest determinant of the use of psychotherapy.
Finally, 20% of our sample were missing self-reported race. There are a number of reasons 
for this including patient refusal to provide this information, healthcare system staff failure 
to enter paper-based responses into the electronic medical record, and/or patients not having 
an outpatient visit during the time that the healthcare systems enacted data collection in 
response to meaningful use requirements29. When the results for patients with unknown/
missing race are examined (see Tables 2 – 4) they are in the middle range of results across 
different racial/ethnic groups. This suggests that the unknown/missing group of patients 
contains patients of all racial/ethnic groups and would be unlikely to change the findings if 
they were added to the known categories of patients. Another limitation related to the race/
ethnicity data is that we cannot verify if the information was self-reported by all patients. It 
is likely that some of this data is not self-report because the healthcare systems in the study 
were in the process of implementing self-reported member demographics. There is evidence 
that electronic medical record race/ethnicity data may not reflect a patient’s self-reported 
preferences48.
In spite of these limitations, this study shows compelling evidence of persistent racial/ethnic 
differences in the diagnosis and treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia 
in a large sample of insured patients across 11 states. This was especially true for non-
Hispanic black patients who were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, and less 
likely to use medication but more likely to use formal psychotherapy, when compared to 
whites.
Our findings filled two important gaps in the literature: 1) most population-based studies of 
U.S. rates of diagnosed mental health conditions and treatment in the U.S. have been based 
upon patient self-report or provider reports of their practice and not objective sources such 
as electronic medical records, and 2) those studies that have examined electronic sources of 
information have been done so in populations using subsidized healthcare. Our study, in 
combination with other recently published work 4, 5, 8, 19, 26, 38, 39, 47 provides a more 
complete picture of the differences among racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. with respect to 
diagnosis and treatment of major mental health conditions. Future research is necessary to 
understand how patient preferences and provider practices determine the differences we have 
reported.
