Background & Aims: Life expectancy of patients with compen-
sated hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis achieving sustained viro-
logic response (SVR) is limited by liver events as compared to
the general population. Thus, survival benefit of SVR remains to
be measured.
Methods: The study includes prospective surveillance data from
three cohorts of Italian patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis
who achieved SVR on an interferon-based (IFN) regimen, com-
pared to simultaneously observed non-SVR, untreated and
decompensated patients. Overall survival was calculated from
the date of start of IFN to death. The number of deaths expected
during the at-risk period was determined by applying age- and
sex-specific mortality rates recorded in Italy for person-years
adequate for the enrolment period. The standardized mortality
ratio (SMR) determined the relative risk of death over that of
the age and sex matched general population.
Results: Overall, 28/181 patients followed-up for a median
period of 9.6 years (range 1–25 years) died. The 10 and 20-year
overall survival rates for the whole series were 90.9% (95% CI,
84.3–94.8) and 62.9% (95% CI, 45.9–75.9), respectively. The num-
ber of expected deaths in the corresponding age and sex matched
general population was 28.1, corresponding to a SMR = 1.00 (95%
CI, 0.72–1.35), with an SMR for non-SVR patients of 3.85 (95% CI,
3.43–4.30), for untreated of 3.01 (95% CI, 2.64–3.42) and for
decompensated of 6.70 (95% CI, 5.39–8.22).
Conclusions: Patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis achieving
SVR by IFN obtain a main benefit levelling their survival curve to
that of the general population. Wider applicability of IFN-free reg-
imens will possibly make this achievement more generalizable.

Introduction
Cirrhosis and liver events such as decompensation or hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) developing in the long-term after infection with
hepatitis C virus (HCV) still represent the main cause of death and
liver transplantation in Western countries [1]. The current interna-
tional guidelines give the highest priority for treatment with new
direct antiviral agents (DAA) to HCV-infected individuals who have
already reached the stage of cirrhosis [2,3]. This choice is based on
the favourable outcome of cirrhotic patients who obtained sustained
virologic response (SVR) after interferon-based therapies (IFN) [3–5].
However, the improved prognosis associated to virologic response
[4–6] was documented exclusively by comparing SVR patients with
cirrhosis to similar patients unsuccessfully treated by IFN. As a result,
several concerns have been raised about the real value of SVR, as a
reliable marker of disease outcome, because selection biases and
other hidden confounders may have limited the consistency of the
reported results. Hence the actual survival benefit of obtaining SVR
is yet at least partly unexplored, due to the lack of pairing of patients
with compensated HCV cirrhosis to their appropriate comparators
(treated patients without SVR, untreated patients and patients with
decompensated disease) and of a comparison to an age and sex
matched general population. Since treatment of cirrhosis with DAA
has now become the absolute standard of care, such information
can assist in justifying priority in the vast allocation of financial
and healthcare resources devoted to these patients [7].

Research Article
 The first cohort (Milan-1) included all patients with either compensated
(Child-Pugh class A5 to A6) or decompensated (Child-Pugh B7 to B9) HCV cirrho-
sis who consecutively attended three liver centres in the Milan area between Jan-
uary 1989 and December 1992, as previously reported [8,9]. The second cohort
(Milan-2) included compensated cirrhosis patients (Child-Pugh class A5 to A6)
consecutively seen at the Liver Unit Fondazione IRCCS Ca‘ Granda, Ospedale Mag-
giore in Milan from January 1997 to December 1997 [10]. Patients with decom-
pensated cirrhosis were recorded, as well, but their follow-up observation was
not planned in this study. Both Milan cohorts included treated and untreated
patients because of co-morbidities, ineligibility to IFN-based therapy or refusal.
The third cohort (Palermo) included all cirrhotic HCV patients (Child-Pugh class
A5 to A6) enrolled at the Liver Unit (Dipartimento Biomedico di Medicina Interna
e Specialistica of the University of Palermo) who started IFN-based antiviral ther-
apy from January 2002 to December 2009 [11]. Patients excluded or ineligible to
treatment and those with decompensated cirrhosis or previous decompensation
were recorded but their follow-up observation was not planned in this study
(Fig. 1).
Briefly, before starting IFN, the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F4 METAVIR, F5-6
Ishak) was either made by a liver biopsy or on clinical criteria. Notably, no
patients with non-cirrhotic advanced fibrosis (F3 METAVIR, F3-4 Ishak) were
included in any cohort. Anti-HCV, HCV RNA, including genotype, liver function
tests were assessed by commercially-available standard methods in all cases.
Co-morbidities including diabetes and history of alcohol intake (confirmed by rel-
atives) were also recorded in dedicated datasets. All patients had Child-Pugh
score determined according to established criteria [12]. Concurrent HCC was
assessed by fine needle liver biopsy or by imaging, following clinical guidelines
[13,14]. Patients with any other than HCV cause of liver disease, were excluded.
All enrolment criteria should have been carefully satisfied in the three cohorts.
Surveillance, treatment and outcome
IFN mono-therapy or IFN (pegylated or not) in combination with ribavirin were
administered according to the standardized criteria that were current at the time
of evaluation [15]. SVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA by PCR at
week 24 after the treatment cessation. SVR patients followed a surveillance pro-
tocol based on clinical, laboratory and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months.
Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy examination was planned at an annual interval
for patients with varices and every three years or when clinically required for
those free of varices at study entry. Until 2001, patients with a newly detected
liver focal lesion underwent computed-tomography (CT) and ultrasound-guided
fine needle biopsy, and after 2001 the diagnosis of HCC was made according to
the Barcelona Conference and AASLD criteria [13,14]. Portal hypertension compli-
cations, such as ascites, gastrointestinal bleedings and hepatic encephalopathy
were treated following international guidelines.
Patients’ vital status and cause of death were recorded during patients’
surveillance. For patients lost to follow-up, vital status was updated in 2015 by
phone call or in case of non-response by contacting their electronic residential
town hall registry offices.
Data collection and analysis was already approved by the local Institutional
Review Committees at the time of enrolment for the above mentioned purposes.
Statistical analysis
The main study outcome was overall survival (OS). OS was calculated from the
date of enrolment (untreated patients) or from the date of initiation of antiviral
therapy (treated patients) to the date of last follow-up or death. OS curves were

 plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival between groups was com-
pared with the Log-rank test. The number of deaths expected during the at-risk
period was determined by applying age- (within 5-year groups) and sex-
specific mortality rates recorded in Italy for the general population [16] in 2000
for person-years accumulated before 2005 and rates recorded in 2009 for
person-years accumulated from 2005 onward. We used the standardized mortal-
ity ratio (SMR), defined as the ratio of the number of deaths observed to the num-
ber of deaths expected, to estimate the relative risk of death. We calculated 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for the SMR assuming that the observed deaths fol-
lowed a Poisson distribution. All analyses were performed with the SAS software
(version 9.2, Cary, NC). All analyses were two-tailed and p values <0.05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
The flow chart of the study, according to the Strobe recommenda-
tions for observational studies, is presented in Fig. 1.
In detail, Milan-1 cohort included 465 patients with both
compensated (198 treated and 154 untreated) and 113 with
decompensated disease. Milan-2 cohort included 306 compen-
sated patients (153 treated and 153 untreated). 101 patients with
decompensated disease were recorded but not followed-up.
Palermo cohort included 444 treated compensated patients. 265
patients excluded from treatment and 220 with decompensated
disease were recorded but not followed-up (Fig. 1).
Overall, 795 (44.1%) of 1802 patients with HCV-related cirrho-
sis in the three cohorts received IFN-based antiviral therapy. 434
patients (24.1%) were not treated because of decompensated dis-
ease and 572 (31.7%) compensated patients for comorbidity, inel-
igibility or refusal.
A total of 181 patients (40 in Milan-1, 33 in Milan-2 and 108
in Palermo) achieved SVR (10.0% overall or 22.8% among treated
patients). Their characteristics are presented in Table 1. In 144
(79.6%) patients the diagnosis of cirrhosis was histologically
proven.
Patients received antiviral treatment at a median age of
59 years (range 30 to 74 years) and 119 (65.7%) were men. 154
patients (85.0%) had Child-Pugh class A5 disease. Forty-eight
patients (22.7% in Child-Pugh A5 and 48.1% in Child-Pugh A6)
had oesophageal varices at baseline, and 88 (48.6%) where
infected with HCV genotype 1. We observed no differences in
age, sex or Child-Pugh score, while the HCV genotype 1 preva-
lence varied (37.1%, 24.2% and 62.0%, respectively) among
cohorts. Vital status was available for 176 (97.3%) of the patients
in June 2015. For the five patients lost at follow-up, who moved
to other residential area, follow-up was censored at their last
visit. During a median follow-up of 9.6 years (16.3 years for
Milan-1, 12.9 years for Milan-2, and 8.1 years for Palermo cohort)
28 patients died with no difference across cohorts (with respec-
tively 15 deaths during 636 person-years of observation in the
first cohort, four deaths during 427 person-years of observation
in the second cohort, and 9 deaths during 863 person-years of
observation in the third cohort (Log-rank p = 0.32) (data not
shown)). The 10- and 20-year OS were 90.9% (95% CI, 84.3–
94.8) and 62.9% (95% CI, 45.9–75.9) respectively (Fig. 2A), with
no difference between sexes (Log-rank p = 0.12), Child-Pugh
classes (Log-rank p = 0.12) or genotypes (Log-rank p = 0.69) (data
not shown).
During follow-up, 11 patients developed decompensation
(two after HCC) (Fig. 2C) and 18 liver related deaths (including
four orthotopic liver transplantations) occurred (Fig. 2B). The
10- and 20-year cumulative incidence of decompensation and
liver related death were respectively 5.2% (2.6–10.2) and 13.6%
(6.3–28.2), 7.1% (4.0–12.7) and 23.3% (12.6–40.8).
Twenty patients developed HCC (16 in Child-Pugh A5 and 4 in
Child-Pugh A6). The 10- and 20-year cumulative incidence of HCC
was 10.3% (6.1–17.0) and 23.7% (14.4–37.6) respectively (Fig. 2D).
During follow-up, 8 of the patients with HCC died, three (15%)
underwent liver transplant. Of interest, all patients with HCC
who received liver transplant are still alive after respectively 9,
10 and 13 years.
Table 2 shows the predictors of outcome (OS, liver related
deaths, decompensation and HCC) in patients with SVR at uni-
variate analysis. At multivariate analysis, only advanced age
and low-platelets count were associated with OS; male gender,
low albumin and low platelets count were associated with liver
related deaths; low albumin and low platelets count were associ-
ated with decompensation; while alpha-fetoprotein level was the
single predictor of HCC (Table 3).

eral population, corresponding to a SMR = 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72–
1.35, Fig. 3A).

Discussion
We report herein that survival of patients with HCV compensated
cirrhosis who achieve SVR is similar to that of the sex and age
matched general population, hence achieving the maximal sur-
vival benefit and an optimal allocation of resources.
A few unique points of our study should be stressed. First, we
included only patients with definite diagnosis of cirrhosis while
those with advanced fibrosis were excluded. Inclusion of F3
patients, as in the retrospective study by van der Meer et al.
[7], would conceivably reduce the number of disease events
and
enhance
confounding
factors.
Moreover,
we
included
patients enrolled in historical prospective cohort studies from
tertiary referral centres from Northern and Southern Italy [8–
11], representative of the Italian general population. This allowed
us to perform an adequate comparison of SVR patients’ survival
with national data, thus avoiding the main limitation of the pre-
vious study [7]. Lastly and most relevant, the long duration of
follow-up allows to report long-term (10- and 20-year) survival
rates in cirrhotic patients achieving SVR, similar to those of
non-cirrhotic patients previously reported with a shorter obser-
vation period [7]. Of note, antiviral therapy was generally offered
to middle-aged patients (50 to 60 years), in an age fascia where
life expectancy exceeded 20 years, thus making our surveillance
period adequate for event recording.
A major issue is the fact that the eligibility criteria to receive
IFN
may
originate
from
an
under-representation
of
co-
morbidities otherwise prevalent in the age matched general pop-
ulation. Moreover, the majority of patients enrolled in our study
with previous alcohol intake stopped drinking at the time of
starting treatment. These concerns may be at least in part bal-
anced by the notion that HCV eradication is associated with
numerous extrahepatic benefits which might have, indeed, led
to a reduced overall mortality [17]. Furthermore, some patients
developed decompensated cirrhosis or HCC after SVR and a few
of them died of liver related disease, which represents a rare
cause of death in the general population. Accordingly, in our
opinion, the small excess of liver related deaths is likely offset
by the small deficit of deaths due to incidental co-morbidities,
observed during the initial follow-up period.
Another crucial result provided by this study is that the inci-
dence of HCC during the follow-up of SVR patients was not neg-
ligible, thus confirming previous reports with smaller sample size
or shorter follow-up time [4–6]. However, no patient with HCC
who received orthotopic liver transplantation died, mainly due
to the lack of graft re-infection which limited the progression of
fibrosis over time. This observation confirms that antiviral treat-
ment should be administered as early as possible thus avoiding
the occurrence of cirrhosis, which is the main determinant of
HCC development. Of interest, we also documented that alpha-
fetoprotein values remain the most powerful predictor of tumour
development. This would suggest that patients with borderline
alpha-fetoprotein elevation are those most at need of immediate
treatment with IFN-free regimens.
As expected, we observed a worse survival trend in compen-
sated patients who had lower functional scores (Child-Pugh Class
A6) at study entry. This outcome, not statistically significant due
to the low likelihood of a Child-Pugh 6 in patients to be offered an
IFN-based regimen, is attributable to the residual mortality
observed in this sicker population in whom, irrespective to SVR,

 portal hypertension may still progress leading to end-stage liver
disease.
Albeit the OS of SVR patients with compensated cirrhosis
matches that of the general population, due to the low rate of
viral clearance by IFN regimens and to the residual liver events,
this result is obtained at a major cost for the healthcare system.
The
societal
burden would be needlessly severe if
costly
resources such as IFN-free DAA combinations are used in unse-
lected patients with competing causes of death. According to
our data, untreated and non-SVR patients with compensated
HCV cirrhosis are 3- to 4-fold more likely to die than comparable
persons from the general population. Hence we may speculate
that this population is highly likely to benefit from DAAs.
Whether this phenomenon will be the case also for decompen-
sated patients in whom the point of no return of the disease
might have been already reached remains to be established.
Some limitations of our study are typical from multicenter
historical cohort studies. The present analysis was not planned
at the time the cohort was established. As a result, only Milan-
1 assessed the outcome of decompensated patients, and Palermo
followed only treated compensated patients. Second, in patients
with compensated cirrhosis, baseline characteristics slightly dif-
fer between centres (see Table 1). Patients were enrolled in dif-
ferent
regions
in
Italy
and
at
different
time
periods,
distinguished by different treatment protocols or patients man-
agement guidelines. Nevertheless, we did not observe any statis-
tically significant differences in outcome across centres at
multivariate analysis.
In conclusion, eradicative treatment of patients with compen-
sated HCV cirrhosis is strongly justified since the achievement of
SVR originates a major survival benefit, with a life expectancy
similar to the general population. In patients with compensated
HCV cirrhosis, treatment should be administered as early as pos-
sible in order to achieve the highest benefit. Availability of IFN-
free DAA regimens will allow for an SVR to be achieved even in
sicker patients and in those ineligible for IFN or previously
excluded for co-morbidities, a major advance given that the mor-
tality rate of these patients is extremely high in comparison to
the general population. Since a failure in modifying the disease
course in decompensated cirrhosis irrespective to viral eradica-
tion was recently reported in almost half of all treated subjects
[18], with some patients seemingly beyond a point of no return
even after viral eradication, the overall impact of SVR remains
to be assessed in further dedicated studies.
