Published analysis of contraceptive
effectiveness of Daysy and DaysyView app
is fatally flawed
Chelsea B. Polis1,2
Abstract
Background: In March 2018, Dr. Martin C. Koch and colleagues published an analysis purporting to measure the
effectiveness of the Daysy device and DaysyView app for the prevention of unintended pregnancy. Unfortunately,
the analysis was flawed in multiple ways which render the estimates unreliable. Unreliable estimates of contraceptive
effectiveness can endanger public health.
Main body: This commentary details multiple concerns pertaining to the collection and analysis of data in Koch et al.
2018. A key concern pertains to the inappropriate exclusion of all women with fewer than 13 cycles of use from the
Pearl Index calculations, which has no basis in standard effectiveness calculations. Multiple additional methodological
concerns, as well as prior attempts to directly convey concerns to the manufacturer regarding marketing materials
based on prior inaccurate analyses, are also discussed.
Conclusion: The Koch et al. 2018 publication produced unreliable estimates of contraceptive effectiveness for the Daysy
device and DaysyView app, which are likely substantially higher than the actual contraceptive effectiveness of the device
and app. Those estimates are being used in marketing materials which may inappropriately inflate consumer confidence
and leave consumers more vulnerable than expected to the risk of unintended pregnancy. Prior attempts to
directly convey concerns to the manufacturer of this device were unsuccessful in preventing publication of
subsequent inaccurate analyses. To protect public health, concerns with this analysis should be documented
in the published literature, the Koch et al. 2018 analysis should be retracted, and marketing materials on contraceptive
effectiveness should be subjected to appropriate oversight.
Keywords: Daysy, DaysyView, Fertility awareness-based methods, Contraceptive effectiveness
Background
In March 2018, Martin C. Koch et al. published a paper
entitled “Improving usability and pregnancy rates of a
fertility monitor by an additional mobile application:
results of a retrospective efficacy study of Daysy and
DaysyView app” [1]. Unfortunately, this paper contains
fatal flaws in the estimation of effectiveness of the
Daysy device and DaysyView app for prevention of unin-
tended pregnancy, which render the published effective-
ness estimates unreliable. The published estimates are
likely to be substantially higher than the actual contracep-
tive effectiveness of the device and app.
This commentary argues that this paper merits retraction
[2], given the demonstrated potential for these estimates to
be used in marketing materials, leading to public confusion
about the actual contraceptive effectiveness of the Daysy
device and DaysyView app. The manufacturer of Daysy
(Valley Electronics AG, Zurich, Switzerland) has cited the
Koch et al. 2018 publication in contraceptive effectiveness
claims in marketing materials (Fig. 1). This could lead to
inappropriately inflated consumer confidence in the contra-
ceptive effectiveness of Daysy and DaysyView, and could
leave consumers more vulnerable to the risk of unintended
pregnancy.

 Pearl Index calculations (which are less preferable than
life table estimates [3], yet are the only estimates ac-
knowledged in the abstract of the Koch et al. 2018 publi-
cation and the Valley Electronics marketing language
shown in Fig. 1) are void of meaning since the authors
inappropriately excluded from the Pearl Index calcula-
tions all women with fewer than 13 cycles of use, ignor-
ing cycle and pregnancy information from the majority
of study participants. This approach has no basis in
standard effectiveness estimation approaches, and would
severely underestimate unintended pregnancy rates by
inappropriately excluding women who may be at greatest
risk of unintended pregnancy (i.e., those who are least ex-
perienced with use of the contraceptive method and most
fertile) [4]. Table 2 of Koch et al. 2018 suggests that at
least 10 pregnancies occurred to women with fewer than
13 cycles (and potentially more, given broader concerns
about pregnancy ascertainment, as discussed below), but
these pregnancies were not included in the Pearl Index
calculations.
In addition, the investigators did not prospectively
collect information regarding perfect or imperfect use

2018 analysis)

 of the method for each cycle. Instead, they asked about
overall perfect/imperfect use (intended to reflect the
entire duration of use) via a retrospective survey. This
precludes their ability to correctly calculate perfect use
unintended pregnancy rates, in either the Pearl Index
or life table calculations [5]. Thus, the so-called “per-
fect use” unintended pregnancy rates in Koch et al.
2018 are not comparable to correctly estimated perfect
use pregnancy rates for other contraceptive methods in
other studies.
Importantly, even if the inappropriate exclusion of preg-
nancies were corrected, the underlying data remain unreli-
able, given the weak approach to pregnancy ascertainment.
First, the survey participation rate was low; only 13% (798/
6278) of the invited population participated. Furthermore,
eligibility for participation was limited to registered users
with a DaysyView account, but no information is provided
on what proportion of overall Daysy users this would repre-
sent. This makes the results vulnerable to selection bias
and incomplete ascertainment of pregnancies among all
Daysy users. Second, the authors note that if a woman indi-
cated on the retrospective survey that she had an “un-
wanted” pregnancy, then the pregnancy was “verified from
the user’s dataset” using a definition of pregnancy of “ele-
vated temperature of longer than 18 days, or if the user
stopped using the device during the luteal phase.” However,
the authors do not state that temperature or device use in-
formation was evaluated among all women (to attempt to
prospectively identify all pregnancies). If the criteria for
examining the temperature/device use data were premised
upon the woman self-reporting an “unwanted” pregnancy
on the survey, an unknown number of pregnancies
may have been excluded, given that unwanted preg-
nancies, including those ending in abortion, may be
underreported [6, 7]. Furthermore, the survey question
asked women to report “unwanted” pregnancies occur-
ring during Daysy use. The term “unwanted” is not
synonymous with “unintended” [8], and it is unclear
how women may have interpreted this question – but
standard contraceptive effectiveness estimates include
all unintended pregnancies (including mistimed and
unwanted pregnancies). Under-ascertainment of unin-
tended pregnancies would lead to inflated estimates of
contraceptive effectiveness.
Several other aspects of the questionnaire also raise con-
cern. For example, a survey question presumably intended
to ascertain if (at baseline) Daysy was being used to avoid
or attempt pregnancy offered the following response op-
tions: (A) To avoid a pregnancy, (B) For family planning,
(C) Both. However, response options A and B (and there-
fore, also C) are poorly distinguished and likely to be per-
ceived synonymously by some respondents, meaning that
even this already limited measure of baseline pregnancy
intentions is unreliable. Also, this retrospective survey was
unable to capture and address changing pregnancy inten-
tions over time to attempt to prospectively characterize
pregnancies as intended (and therefore, excluded from
estimates of contraceptive effectiveness) or unintended
(and therefore, included in estimates of contraceptive
effectiveness).
While some issues in data collection and analysis are
not unique to this study, they nonetheless raise add-
itional concern about the accuracy of the estimates. For
example, no inclusion/exclusion criteria were described
to ensure that the analytic population was at meaningful
risk of pregnancy (i.e., excluding women likely to be sub-
fertile). Also, the majority of survey respondents (64%)
reported concurrent use of contraceptive methods in
addition to Daysy; the potential confounding effect of
use of other methods on the effectiveness estimates is
not addressed in the analysis.
For these reasons, this analysis produced estimates
which cannot be understood as reflective of the true
(and still unknown) contraceptive effectiveness of the
Daysy device and DaysyView app. Our forthcoming sys-
tematic review of studies assessing the effectiveness of
various fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs) [9]
carefully considers the quality of prospective studies on
effectiveness of various FABMs. Studies of extremely
poor quality, such as those in Koch et al. 2018, must
not be understood as providing reliable evidence on
contraceptive effectiveness.
The manufacturer of the Daysy device, Valley Elec-
tronics, has made inaccurate marketing statements in
the past (Figs. 2 and 3), based on previously published
analyses [10, 11] which purported to assess contracep-
tive effectiveness of their products, but which also
contained fatal flaws.1 In September 2017, I contacted
the Director of Medical Affairs for Valley Electronics
to directly express concerns regarding the methodo-
logical issues in these prior analyses [10, 11], and flag
concern regarding the reliability of this information. I
encouraged the company to “alert Daysy users and po-
tential customers that at present, Daysy lacks suffi-
cient evidence to be promoted as a tool for pregnancy
prevention,” and to “focus instead on collecting high
quality evidence to adequately assess the true effective-
ness of this device” [12]. I was informed that my con-
cerns would be discussed with the advisory board.
However, the exchange appears to have been unsuccessful
in encouraging the company to ensure accuracy in sub-
sequently published estimates and marketing language.
Therefore, additional steps are needed to protect scien-
tific integrity and public health.
Conclusions
The scientific and reproductive health communities have
a responsibility to protect public health by ensuring that
Polis Reproductive Health  (2018) 15:113

 inaccurately conducted analyses of contraceptive effective-
ness do not put unsuspecting consumers at a greater than
expected risk of experiencing an unintended pregnancy.
Women and couples interested in using any form of
contraception, including an FABM such as Daysy, de-
serve robust effectiveness data on which to base their
contraceptive decisions. Unfortunately, the published
Koch et al. 2018 estimates are fatally flawed and
inaccurate, and are likely to be substantially higher

 increases consumer confidence in the effectiveness of
the Daysy device and the DaysyView app, which could
endanger the well-being of their customers. Prior efforts
to directly communicate methodological concerns to the
company do not appear to have led to enhanced caution
in ensuring the accuracy of their published effective-
ness estimates or marketing language. Therefore, to
protect public health, scientific integrity, and potential
consumers, these concerns should be documented in the
published literature, [13] the Koch et al. 2018 analysis
should be retracted, [2] and marketing materials on
contraceptive
effectiveness
should

appropriate oversight.
Endnotes
1For example, in addition to multiple concerns pertaining
to the methods of pregnancy ascertainment in Freundl
1998 (collected via a mailed, retrospective questionnaire),
the calculation which generated a 0.7 perfect use Pearl
Index [10] used an incorrect denominator which included
all cycles, rather than only cycles of perfect use, which
would inflate perfect use effectiveness rates [3].
