 suboptimal outcome is likely due in part to the complex network of immunosuppressive pathways 
present in advanced tumors, which are unlikely to be overcome by intervention at a single 
signaling checkpoint4–8. Here we demonstrate a combination immunotherapy that recruits a 
variety of innate and adaptive immune cells to eliminate large tumor burdens in syngeneic tumor 
models and a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model; to our knowledge tumors of this 
size have not previously been curable by treatments relying on endogenous immunity. Maximal 
anti-tumor efficacy required four components: a tumor antigen targeting antibody, an extended 
half-life recombinant IL-29, anti-PD-1, and a powerful T-cell vaccine10. Depletion experiments 
revealed that CD8+ T-cells, cross-presenting DCs, and several other innate immune cell subsets 
were required for tumor regression. Effective treatment induced infiltration of immune cells and 
production of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor, enhanced antibody-mediated tumor antigen 
uptake, and promoted antigen spreading. These results demonstrate the capacity of an elicited 
endogenous immune response to destroy large, established tumors and elucidate essential 
characteristics of combination immunotherapies capable of curing a majority of tumors in 
experimental settings typically viewed as intractable.
Checkpoint blockade therapies prove that an endogenous immune response can regress 
human tumors, but significant responses remain restricted to a minority of patients6,11. 
Combining checkpoint blockade with other agents may improve response rates12–14, and 
immunotherapies implementing three or more agents in tandem are already in clinical 
testing15–18. However, even in preclinical models, complete tumor rejection is usually only 
achieved by treating very small tumors and/or treating at very early times preceding the 
establishment of a fully developed tumor microenvironment, unless adoptive transfer of ex 
vivo-expanded T-cells is employed19,20. Autochthonous tumors induced in genetically-
engineered animals, which may generate immunosuppressive networks more akin to human 
tumors, are also generally refractory to immunotherapy21,22. As such, the general 
characteristics of an endogenous immune response capable of reliably eradicating large 
immunosuppressive tumor burdens remain unclear.
We recently reported that therapies combining anti-tumor antibodies and extended half-life 
IL-2 (IL-2 fused with mouse serum albumin (MSA-IL-2) or Fc) exhibited synergistic 
therapeutic effects in mouse models of cancer9. This combination was curative when 
administered with adoptive T-cell therapy. We hypothesized that similar therapeutic results 
might be achieved in the setting of a wholly endogenous immune response by replacing T-
cell transfer with a powerful vaccine. To this end, we employed a potent lymph node-
targeted vaccine composed of peptide antigens and CpG DNA conjugated to albumin-
binding lipids. These amphiphile-vaccines reversibly bind to albumin present in interstitial 
fluid and efficiently traffic to lymph nodes, leading to robust T-cell responses10. We also 
included systemic anti-PD-1 administration due to its capacity to enhance vaccine responses 
and further modulate the tumor microenvironment by blocking suppressive signals that 
dampen anti-tumor immunity7,11. In multiple syngeneic tumor models as well as the BRaf/
Pten genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma, this quaternary combination 
immunotherapy cured a majority of mice with established tumors and elicited long-lived 
protective T cell memory responses.

 RESULTS
Tumor regression by combination therapy
Motivated by the synergy observed between extended half-life IL-2 and anti-tumor 
antibodies9 and our recent discovery of a strategy to efficiently target peptide vaccines to 
lymph nodes10, we explored combination treatments bringing these reagents together with 
checkpoint blockade. To simplify reference to this four-component therapy, we designate 
combinations of these components by concatenated single initials A (anti-tumor antibody), I 
(MSA-IL-2), P (anti-PD-1), and V (amphiphile-vaccine). We first evaluated this combination 
treatment in three subcutaneous (s.c.) syngeneic tumor models: B16F10 melanoma, DD-
Her2/neu (a rat Her2/neu-expressing breast cancer tumor), and TC-1 tumors expressing the 
HPV oncoantigens E6 and E7. For each tumor, appropriate A and V components were 
selected (Fig. 1a). Antibodies against Trp1 (TA99) and Her2/neu (7.16.4) were used to treat 
B16F10 and DD-Her2/neu, respectively, while an antibody surrogate 2.5F-Fc (Fc fused with 
an engineered binding protein that recognizes tumor-expressed αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 
integrins23) was used to treat TC-1 tumors (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Amphiphile-peptide 
vaccines encoding the well characterized immunodominant Trp2, Her2/neu, and HPV E7 
epitopes were synthesized (Supplementary Fig. 1d–g, and ref10). Tumor cells (106) were 
injected s.c. and allowed to grow for 8 days prior to initiation of therapy, resulting in tumor 
sizes of ~40–60 mm2 at initial treatment, depending on the tumor model. The protein 
components were injected i.p. and the vaccine was administered s.c. at the base of the tail. 
Therapies were given once per week, with P and V administered 3 times and A and I given 5 
times (Fig. 1a).
This AIPV regimen induced robust tumor regression and durable cures in 75% of mice 
bearing B16F10 melanoma tumors (Fig. 1b), while combinations of 3 or fewer of the AIPV 
components elicited weaker therapeutic responses ranging from modestly reduced efficacy 
(AIP) to outcomes barely different from untreated tumors (APV) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary 
Fig. 2a–b and g). Greater than 80% of AIPV-treated long-term survivors rejected a 
rechallenge with 105 B16F10 cells two months after cessation of therapy, suggesting 
formation of effective immunological memory (Fig. 1d). Similarly, in the DD-Her2/neu and 
TC-1 tumor models greater than 70% of mice achieved complete tumor rejection when 
treated with AIPV, and 100% of long term survivors rejected tumors on rechallenge (Fig. 
1d–g, Supplementary Fig. 2c–f and h–i). Triple combinations of AIPV components 
demonstrated significantly lower efficacy in primary tumor rejection, though each of the 3 
tumor models showed a different hierarchy of efficacy among the ternary combinations. A 
limited exploration of alternate 4-agent combinations revealed that anti-PD-1 could be 
replaced by anti-CTLA-4, but several other combinations failed to replicate AIPV in 
eliminating B16F10 tumors (Supplementary Fig. 3). Importantly, despite high rates of 
response, AIPV therapy was associated with minimal systemic toxicity, as mice did not 
show weight loss or significant elevation of liver enzymes. (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c).
Combination therapy impacts tumor immune infiltration
To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the observed therapeutic 
effect of the quaternary combination therapy, we further analyzed responses to AIPV therapy

 in the B16F10 model as representative of an immunosuppressive, poorly immunogenic 
tumor. AIPV treatment induced expansion of an interferon-γ-producing Trp2-specific CD8+ 
T-cell population in the blood of mice (Fig. 2a–b); abundance of these cells correlated with 
vitiligo in treated animals, which is associated with favorable responses to immunotherapy 
in the clinic24 (Supplementary Fig. 4d–f). However, comparable Trp2-specific T-cell 
responses were elicited by AIV and IPV treatments, which failed to induce comparable 
therapeutic outcomes (Fig. 2b). We thus looked for changes within tumors that correlated 
more closely with survival. Luminex quantification of intratumoral cytokines and 
chemokines revealed five clusters of co-regulated proteins, with many pro-inflammatory 
factors increased in tumors treated with effective therapies (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 5). 
We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to construct models using cytokines from 
each cluster to predict log10 tumor mass. Analysis of the variance in tumor mass explained 
by each model revealed that cluster 3 cytokines captured the most variance (Fig. 2d), and 
therefore provided the most predictive model. Variable importance in projection (VIP) 
scores identified 4 predictive biomarkers from cluster 3– MIP-1α, RANTES, eotaxin, and 
IL-4– whose levels were inversely correlated with tumor size and predicted tumor mass 
across all 5 treatment combinations (Fig. 2e–f, R2=0.69).
Motivated by this chemoattractant-rich protective signature, we analyzed cellular infiltrates 
in treated tumors. AIPV therapy induced tumor infiltration by effector CD4+ and CD8+ T-
cells, CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow neutrophils25,26, NK cells, and other myeloid cells (Fig. 3a–d, 
Supplementary Fig. 6a–d). PD-1+TIM-3+CD8+ cells were infrequent in all treatment groups, 
but AIPV induced a large increase in the CD8+ T-cell/Treg ratio (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 
6g–h), an interesting outcome given the potential for IL-2 treatment to increase Treg 
numbers. Notably however, no single leukocyte population examined individually correlated 
with therapeutic outcome, as several treatment subcombinations elicited infiltration of 
individual cell populations equivalent to AIPV. Immunohistochemical analysis of treated 
tumors revealed CD8+ T-cells were present at high density throughout AIPV-treated tumors, 
with less effective triple-combination therapies eliciting progressively fewer CD8+ cells in 
the bulk tumor mass (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 6e–f). Antibody depletion experiments 
showed that CD8+ T-cells were critical to tumor rejection (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 7a). 
Macrophage, NK cell, or neutrophil depletion also led to significant reductions in overall 
survival rates, while IL-5 blockade or CD4+ T-cell depletion did not impact efficacy (Fig. 3f, 
Supplementary Fig. 7a–b). Thus, AIPV treatment elicited substantial remodeling of the 
tumor microenvironment with contributions from diverse effector cells.
Therapy promotes cross-presentation to generate de novo T cell responses
We next assessed whether de novo adaptive immune responses specific for antigens not 
encoded by the vaccine were primed by AIPV treatment. Given the critical role of CD8+ T-
cells in the therapeutic effect, we first analyzed the impact of AIPV on antigen presentation 
in the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Batf3 is a transcription factor required for 
development of cross presenting DCs in mice,27 and AIPV-treated Batf3−/− mice failed to 
reject tumors, indicating a requirement for cross-presenting DCs for response to therapy 
(Fig. 4a). Anti-tumor antibodies promote cross-presentation of tumor antigens28. To further 
explore the role of anti-tumor antibody in this process, we treated mice bearing GFP-

 expressing B16F10 tumors with AIPV or subcombinations and analyzed the uptake of GFP 
and fluorescently labeled TA99 in dendritic cells in TDLNs (Fig. 4b–c). We examined two 
Batf3-dependent cross-presenting DC populations that may have distinct roles in tumors, 
CD8α+ DCs and CD103+ DCs29–31. Labeled TA99 accumulated in these DC populations, 
and treatment combinations including TA99 significantly increased GFP uptake by both 
CD8α+ and CD103+ DCs over untreated tumors (Fig. 4d–g). Further, ovalbumin (OVA)-
expressing B16F10 tumors treated with AIPV (vaccinating against Trp2) induced T cell 
responses specific for the SIINFEKL OVA peptide that were substantially greater than 
responses observed in untreated or IPV-treated tumors, indicating a role for the antibody in 
priming T-cell responses to new tumor antigens (Fig. 4h–i). Further supporting the 
conclusion that AIPV induced a broad T cell response to multiple tumor antigens, splenic T 
cells from B16F10-tumor bearing mice treated with AIPV produced IFN-γ upon 
restimulation with either parental B16F10 cells or a Trp2-deleted B16F10 cell line 
(Supplementary Fig. 8a–b) (Fig. 4j–k). In addition, 50% of AIPV-treated mice cured of 
primary tumors also rejected a rechallenge with Trp2-deleted B16F10 cells on day 125 
(Supplementary Fig. 8c). These data suggest the antibody component of AIPV promoted 
epitope spreading, leading to functional de novo T-cell responses against tumor antigens not 
encoded by the T cell vaccine.
Therapy-induced endogenous antibody responses
In parallel we evaluated endogenous antibody responses in AIPV-treated animals. In all 3 
transplanted tumor models, AIPV therapy elicited antibodies that bound to the tumor cells 
(Fig. 5a). We developed an approach to deplete the injected antibody from sera recovered 
from mice undergoing treatment, in order to analyze the endogenous IgG response over time 
(Supplementary Fig. 9a–f). Using this approach, we found that both AIPV and the less 
effective triple subcombinations elicited anti-tumor antibodies, which were detectable as 
early as 7 days following start of treatment and increased in binding signal over 30 days for 
combinations that promoted better survival (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 9f). An 
immunoblot of sera from B16F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with AIPV against B16F10 
lysate revealed that these endogenous antibodies recognized numerous antigens (Fig. 5c). 
These therapy-induced antibodies were functional, as serum transferred from AIPV-treated 
mice protected naive mice against intravenous B16F10 challenge (Fig. 5d–e). However, 
administration of AIPV therapy to B-cell-deficient μMT bearing established B16F10 tumors 
led to a similar frequency of tumor regressions as observed in wild type mice, suggesting 
that the endogenous antibody response was not essential for the therapeutic effect of the 
AIPV regimen (Fig. 5f–g). Together, these experiments indicate that AIPV broadly 
promoted both antibody and T-cell responses against epitopes not directly targeted by the 
therapy components.
Efficacy in an autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model
Transplanted tumors do not closely mimic the histology of human cancers, and often have a 
high mutational burden that constitutes potential neoantigens. To assess the efficacy of AIPV 
in a model more closely mimicking the pathophysiology of human disease and 
simultaneously determine the impact of a low frequency of neoantigens, we used the 
BRafCA PtenloxP Tyr::CreERT2 (BRaf/Pten) inducible melanoma model32. We first enhanced

 the potency of AIPV by increasing the number of antigens targeted by the vaccine 
component33. AIPV therapy using a trivalent amphiphile-vaccine targeting gp100, Trp1, and 
Trp2 cured 100% of B16F10 tumor-bearing mice with mean initial tumor sizes of 50 mm2 
(Fig. 6a–b). To test this combination in genetically engineered mice, tumors were induced by 
painting tamoxifen on the ears of BRaf/Pten mice, and when visible lesions were present (~4 
weeks), treatment was initiated. Melanomas grew progressively and by week 10 completely 
covered the ears of untreated mice (Fig. 6c). By contrast, trivalent-vaccine AIPV induced 
regression of pigmented lesions, leading to complete clearance in the majority of animals 
and a significant improvement in overall survival compared to untreated mice (Fig. 6c–d). 
This result was coincident with expansion of T-cells recognizing the three vaccine-encoded 
antigens in peripheral blood (Fig. 6e) and with infiltration of CD8+ T-cells throughout AIPV-
treated Braf/Pten tumors (Fig. 6f). To our knowledge this is the first immunotherapy to 
regress a majority of induced lesions in this autochthonous tumor model.
DISCUSSION
To date, complete elimination of large, poorly immunogenic tumors in immunocompetent 
animal models has only been reliably achieved by combination therapies employing large 
numbers of adoptively transferred T-cells14,19,34. Thus, it has remained an outstanding 
question whether an endogenous immune response can be stimulated to overcome advanced 
tumors in a majority of animals. Here we demonstrate in several transplanted tumor models 
and a genetically-engineered mouse model of melanoma the capacity of endogenous 
immunity, elicited by a safe four-component immunotherapy, to regress large established 
tumors in the majority of mice. All four components incorporated in AIPV were required for 
treatment of several difficult tumor models, and other treatment combinations were often 
less effective or very toxic, for example, utilizing anti-CD40 in place of the anti-tumor 
antibody caused inflammatory toxicity resulting in death of treated mice (unpublished data). 
Notably, the models studied here were selected in part due to their resistance to 
immunotherapy treatment; other commonly used immunogenic tumors (e.g., EG7.OVA, 
CT26, and MC-38) could be cured by double- or triple-component subcombinations of 
AIPV (unpublished data).
Many immunotherapy studies focus on CD8+ T-cell responses to tumors, but important roles 
for innate immune effector cells are also well described. Especially in the presence of tumor-
opsonizing antibodies, NK cells, neutrophils and macrophages can all contribute to direct 
antibody-dependent phagocytosis, reactive oxygen-mediated cytotoxicity against tumors, 
and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines35–37. This innate attack creates 
intertwined positive feedback loops: opsonized tumor antigen is released that is efficiently 
cross presented by DCs13,38,39; inflammatory cytokines and immune complexes are released 
that activate DCs, stimulate their migration to draining lymph nodes, and promote adaptive 
effector functions9,40,41; and additional innate effectors and T-cells are recruited to the 
tumor9,40,42. Consistent with the importance of the innate immune response, maximal 
efficacy of AIPV therapy was dependent not only on CD8+ T-cells but also neutrophils, 
macrophages, NK cells, and cross-presenting DCs. AIPV therapy completely failed in Batf3-
deficient mice, and was in fact even less effective than AIP treatment, suggesting that the 
loss in efficacy in these knockout animals reflected more than loss of responsiveness to the

 vaccine component (unpublished data). Although models of infectious disease and systemic 
immunization have implicated CD8α+ dendritic cells as key cross-presenting cells for T-cell 
immunity43,44, recent data has suggested that in growing tumors, a second Batf3-dependent 
DC lineage, CD103+ DCs, plays a critical role in tumor antigen presentation29,30. Consistent 
with these reports, we found both CD8α+ and CD103+ DCs acquired tumor antigen in a 
manner enhanced by the antibody component of AIPV.
Treatment of multiple tumor models with AIPV therapy revealed distinct hierarchies of 
importance for the four components. For example, the monoclonal antibody component was 
a critical contributor to efficacy in the B16F10 model, but the least important component in 
the DD-Her2/neu model. A key aspect of AIPV treatment is that this set of 4 agents 
collectively mounts an integrated response overcoming tumor resistance mechanisms in all 
of the models evaluated here– suggesting that the appropriate combination of immune 
effectors can overcome a range obstacles presented in tumor microenvironments. Notably, 
therapy excluding the extended-PK IL-2 (APV treatment) showed greatly reduced efficacy 
in all 3 transplanted tumor models, correlating with reduced abundance of inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines in tumors and fewer infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Which 
cell types IL-2 must act on for therapeutic efficacy remains to be defined, but besides 
supporting the proliferation and effector functions of T-cells, IL-2 is known to also drive 
expansion and enhance the sensitivity of NK cells45, promote neutrophilia and eosinophilia, 
and induce the production of myriad additional cytokines and chemokines that may support 
a combined innate and adaptive immune attack on tumors46. Despite the potential of IL-2 to 
expand Tregs, we found that intratumoral CD8:Treg ratios were amplified relative to 
untreated tumors during AIPV therapy.
Although it remains an understudied area, prior work has demonstrated that the number of 
antigens targeted by cancer vaccines can be an important variable, with vaccines targeting 
more antigens leading to greater anti-tumor efficacy33. In agreement with these data, we 
found that the efficacy of AIPV therapy was sensitive to the valency of the vaccine; targeting 
a single epitope in the B16F10 model led to a 75% cure rate (Fig. 1c), while a modest 
increase in vaccine valency to target 3 melanocyte antigens led to cures of 100% of treated 
mice (Fig. 6a–b). There is currently much enthusiasm for targeting neoantigens formed by 
mutations in tumors, but our data demonstrate that combination immunotherapy targeting 
only tumor-associated self antigens can elicit pronounced tumor regressions, even in the 
setting of a genetically-induced mouse model bearing an intrinsically low burden of 
mutations. However, AIPV also promoted responses to additional antigens not present in the 
vaccine, which could protect against challenge with tumor cells lacking the vaccine-targeted 
antigens. We attempted to evaluate whether AIPV could be protective in the absence of 
antigen spreading by treating pmel-1 transgenic mice19 that lack T-cells capable of 
responding to peptides other than gp100, but when treated with AIPV incorporating a gp100 
peptide as the vaccine component, these animals developed severe inflammatory toxicity 
(unpublished observation). Antigen spreading promoted by immunotherapy has also 
observed in recent clinical studies melanoma patients47, and may be important for dealing 
with tumor heterogeneity and preventing escape by tumor antigen loss variants48.

 Endogenous antibody responses were primed by AIPV and other combinations of the four 
monotherapies, and AIPV treatment induced antibodies that were protective when 
transferred to naïve recipients. Despite these findings, B-cells were not required for AIPV 
treatment efficacy. We speculate that because the therapy itself includes a potent monoclonal 
tumor-opsonizing antibody, the endogenous response may be dispensable. An interesting 
question for future work will be whether the monoclonal antibody component could be 
removed from the treatment regimen once the endogenous antibody response develops, i.e. 
by the second or third treatment.
AIPV incorporates two tumor-specific reagents, the lymph node-targeted peptide vaccine 
and a monoclonal opsonizing antibody. While still a challenge in some diseases, 
identification of T-cell target antigens shared by a proportion of tumors of a given type has 
been well delineated for many cancers over the past 20 years by the cancer vaccine field49 
and a number of pipelines for finding unique mutant neoantigens have been recently 
developed50,51. In contrast, identifying an effective opsonizing monoclonal antibody 
presents a development hurdle to apply AIPV to an arbitrary given tumor. However, the 
demonstration that the integrin binding protein 2.5F-Fc, which contains an Fc domain for 
antibody effector functions and recognizes αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrins over-expressed in 
a broad range of cancers52, suggests that the 2.5F-Fc protein may be applicable to many 
tumor types. Careful consideration of potential side effects is needed in the choice of target 
antigens for translation of this approach. Targeting tumor-associated antigens carries the risk 
of autoimmunity, for example immunotherapy targeting melanocyte self antigens is known 
to induce vitiligo, uveitis, and hearing loss in some patients due to loss of normal 
melanocytes.53,54 Sequencing of patient tumors for neoantigen identification is an attractive 
alternative, and the peptide vaccine platform used here is well suited to such an approach. 
Similarly, while antigen spreading as observed here may promote tumor rejection, an 
important issue for future work is understanding whether these de novo T-cell responses are 
focused on tumor-specific mutations or self antigens.
In summary, we have demonstrated that a rational combination of four complementary 
immunomodulatory agents, each of which have modest anti-tumor efficacy individually, can 
lead to robust complete responses in the setting of large, immunosuppressive tumors. 
Rejection of established tumors relied on an orchestrated response invoking diverse effector 
mechanisms of the immune system. Although a quaternary treatment regimen will be 
challenging for direct clinical translation due to the complexity of identifying optimal dosing 
levels and schedules for each component, insights from this successful protocol provide a 
framework for devising simpler regimens and extensions to other treatment modalities.

genotyped via Transnetyx. Mice were used in studies when 6–8 weeks old. All animal work 
was conducted under the approval of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
Division of Comparative Medicine in accordance with federal, state, and local guidelines.
Cells
B16F10 were purchased from ATCC. TC-1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. T. C. Wu at 
John Hopkins University. B16-OVA and DD-Her2/neu cells were kindly provided by Dr. 
Glenn Dranoff at Dana-Farber. B16-GFP-Luc cells were generated as previously 
described55. DD-Her-2/neu breast tumor cells were derived from a spontaneous breast tumor 
in a Balb/c Her-2/neu (Balb-NeuT) transgenic mouse, in which MMTV promoter-driven 
breast epithelium-specific expression of the activated oncogenic form of rat Her-2/neu drives 
progressive development of breast tumors in transgenic Her-2/neu female mice56. The DD 
cell line was found to lose Her-2/neu expression in vitro, and thus cells were infected with 
pMFG-Her-2/neu virus to achieve stable expression of high levels of oncogenic rat 
Her-2/neu both in vitro and in vivo.HEK293 cells were purchased from Life Technologies.
Tumor cell lines were cultured in complete DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 
100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine) with the 
exception of TC-1 cells, which were cultured in complete RPMI. T-cells and splenocytes 
were cultured in RPMI with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate, 0.05 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 
2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, and 1X MEM non-essential amino acids. Hybridomas were 
cultured in CD Hybridoma AGT Medium (Life Technologies). HEK293 cells were cultured 
in Freestyle Media (Life Technologies). All cell lines and assay cultures were maintained at 
37°C and 5% CO2. All cells were tested regularly for mycoplasma contamination and for 
rodent pathogens and none used tested positive at any point.
Vaccine and protein production
Amphiphile-CpG (amph-CpG) was produced as previously described, by solid phase 
synthesis of a Class B CpG 1826 sequence with G2 spacer (5′ diacyl lipid -
*G*G*T*C*C*A*T*G*A* C*G*T*T*C*C*T*G*A*C*G*T*T- 3′) conjugated via the 5′ 
end to an 18-carbon diacyl tail10. Amphiphile-peptides (amph-peptides) were produced as 
previously described10, via conjugation of cys residues of peptide antigens to 1,2-distearoyl-
sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (Avanti Polar 
Lipids). Vaccine sequences are as follows: Trp2180-188 (CSVYDFFVWL); Her2/Neu66-74 
(p66, CTYVPANASL), HPV E743-62 (GQAEPDRAHYNIVTFCCKCD), Tyrp1opt455-463 
(optimized A463M57, CTAPDNLGYM), gp100opt20-39 (optimized S27P, EGP long58, 
CAVGALEGPRNQDWLGVPRQL). TA99 and MSA-IL2 were produced in HEK293 cells 
as previously described9. 2.5-Fc was generated by fusing an integrin (αVβ3, αVβ5, and 
α5β1) binding domain to a murine IgG2a Fc region to create an antibody-like tumor 
targeting molecule23. 2.5-Fc was produced by transient transfection of HEK293 cells and 
purified by Protein A. The 7.16.4 monoclonal antibody to rat Her2/neu was generated from

 hybridoma 7.16.4 purchased from ATCC, and was purified using Protein A. IFN-α was 
expressed as a SUMO fusion using the pE-SUMOpro vector (LifeSensors) in Rosetta-gami 2 
(DE3) competent cells (Novagen). After IMAC purification using TALON metal affinity 
resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech Laboratories), the SUMO tag 
was removed by incubation with SUMO protease and reapplication on TALON resin as 
detailed previously59. Finally, the protein was passed through Detoxi-Gel endotoxin removal 
resin (Thermo Scientific) until endotoxin levels were below 0.1 total EU/dose as measured 
by the QCL-1000 chromogenic LAL assay (Lonza). The IL-15 superagonist60 was produced 
by transiently transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding His-tagged IL-15 
superagonist and purified using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) on a PD-10 column (Bio-Rad) 
followed by further purification using a His-Spin Protein Miniprep (Zymo Research). Anti-
TGF-β, a homodimeric fusion between murine IgG2a Fc and the extracellular domain of the 
type II TGF-b receptor, was produced by transient transfection of HEK293 cells and purified 
by Protein A.
Tumor inoculation and subcutaneous tumor therapy
An inoculum of 106 tumor cells was injected s.c. on the flank of mice in 50 μL sterile PBS. 
Eight days following injection, treatment was initiated as indicated (Fig. 1a). The tumor-
targeting antibody (A) was administered at 100 μg per dose i.p. for B16F10 and DD-
Her2/Neu models. 2.5-Fc was was administered at 500 μg per dose (i.p.). MSA-IL2 (I) was 
administered i.p. at 30 μg (6 μg molar equivalent IL-2) per dose. Anti-PD-1 (P) (clone 
RMP1-14, BioXCell) was administered at 200 μg i.p. The vaccine, composed of 1.24 nmol 
amph-CpG and 20 μg of amph-peptide, was administered s.c. at base of the tail, half the 
dose given on each side. For experiments exploring other quaternary combos, the following 
doses were used as indicated in Supplementary Fig. 3: anti-CTLA-4 (clone 9D9, BioXCell) 
was administered at 200 μg per dose i.p., IFN-α was administered at 50 μg per dose i.p., 
IL-15 superagonist at 4 μg per dose i.p., and anti-TGF-β at 100 μg per dose i.p. Mice were 
randomized into treatment groups on day 8 following tumor inoculation, immediately prior 
to treatment. Tumor size was measured as an area (longest dimension x perpendicular 
dimension) three times weekly, and mice were euthanized when tumor area exceeded 100 
mm2. Mice that rejected tumors were rechallenged as indicated with 105 tumor cells s.c. on 
the opposite flank.
Flow cytometry
Antibodies to CD8α (53–6.7), IFN-γ (XMG1.2), TNF-α (MP6-XT22), CD3ε (500A2), 
IgM (RMM-1), CD19 (6D5), NK1.1 (PK136), Ly-6G (1A8), F4/80 (BM8), CD11b (M1/70), 
CD25 (PC61), PD-1 (29F.1A12), Tim-3 (B8.2C12), Ly-6C (HK1.4), and CD64 (X54-5/7.1) 
were purchased from BioLegend. Antibodies to CD4 (RM4-5) and Foxp3 (FJK-16s) were 
purchased from eBioscience. Trp2 tetramer (iTAg Tetramer/PE H-2Kb TRP2) and OVA 
tetramer (iTAg Tetramer/PE H-2Kb OVA) were purchased from MBL. Tetramer staining was 
performed in buffer containing 50 nM dasatinib to enhance staining. Viability was assessed 
by LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua purchased from Life Technologies. TA99 was labeled with 
Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester (Life Technologies) to generate TA99-647. Foxp3 was stained 
using the Transcription Factor Buffer Set from BD.

 Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) was performed as described previously10. Peptides 
used for restimulation were 10 μg/mL of the relevant antigen: Trp2180-188 (SVYDFFVWL), 
Her2/Neu66-74 (TYVPANASL), Tyrp-1455-463 native (TAPDNLGYA), or gp10025-33 native 
(EGSRNQDWL). Immune cell infiltrates of tumors were analyzed as previously described9, 
briefly: tumors were resected from mice on day 14 or 21, weighed, and mechanically 
disrupted to generate a single cell suspension. Cells were stained to identify infiltrating 
immune and quantified using flow cytometry. Shown are cell counts normalized by tumor 
mass. For antibody and GFP uptake experiments, lymph nodes were resected from tumor 
bearing mice on day 10, digested with collagenase/dispase in media at 37°C for 20 minutes 
and mechanical disruption was used to generate a single cell suspension. Cells were stained 
to identify DC populations and run on the cytometer. Cells were analyzed using BD FACS 
LSR II, BD FACS LSR Fortessa, and BD FACSCanto flow cytometers, and data was 
analyzed using FlowJo.
Depletions
Cellular subsets were depleted by administering 400 μg of depleting antibody i.p. twice 
weekly beginning one day prior to therapy as indicated: CD8 T-cells with anti-CD8α (clone 
2.43, BioXCell), CD4 T-cells with anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioXCell), NK cells with anti-
NK1.1 (clone PK136, BioXCell), neutrophils with anti-Ly-6G (clone 1A8, BioXCell), with 
the exception of CSF1R and IL-5, which were depleted using 300 μg (clone AFS98, 
BioXCell) every other day and 1 mg (clone TRFK5, BioXCell) weekly respectively.9 
Cellular depletions of CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, neutrophils, and NK cells were confirmed 
by flow cytometry of PBMC (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Autochthonous tumor model induction and therapy
BRafCA PtenloxP Tyr::CreERT2 mice27 on the C57BL/6 background61 were crossed with 
mT/mG mice62 to generate BRaf/Pten-TG mice. To induce tumors, 2 μL of 5 mg/mL 
tamoxifen was administered to the left ear on three consecutive days. Tumors were allowed 
to develop for 24–26 days, at which time visible pigmented tumors were present. Treatment 
schedule and doses were the same as B16F10 s.c. model, except that vaccine used was a 
combination of three amph-peptides (15 μg amph-gp100, 15 μg amph-Trp1, and 15 μg 
amph-Trp2) and 1.24 nmol amph-CpG. Mice were euthanized when pigmented lesions 
covered greater than 90% of the ear.
Liver enzyme measurements
Serum was isolated from mice 36 hours after treatment and liver enzymes AST and ALT 
were quantified using a colorimetric Aspartate Aminotransferase Activity Assay Kit (Sigma 
Aldrich) and Alanine Aminotransferase Activity Assay Kit (Sigma Aldrich) respectively 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Endogenous antibody detection and serum transfer
For endogenous antibody binding measurements following therapy, B16F10 cells, TC-1 
cells, or DD-Her2/Neu cells were incubated with 5% serum from AIPV-treated mice (day 
150) or age-matched naïve mice in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, 1%

 BSA, 5mM EDTA, then incubated with AlexaFluor647 labeled anti-mouse IgG for 20 
minutes at 4°C. Cells were washed in PBS, 1% BSA, 5mM EDTA with DAPI included to 
exclude dead cells and were subsequently run on the BD FACSCanto for analysis. To 
measure endogenous antibody responses during therapy in the B16F10 model, TA99 
antibody used as part of the therapy needed to be depleted from serum samples. To this end, 
biotinylated TA99 was used for therapy, which could be removed from recovered sera using 
streptavidin resin. TA99 was biotinylated using an N-hydroxy succinimide-activated biotin 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and excess biotin was 
removed using desalting columns (Zeba). Biotin labeling was quantified using the 
colorimetric Biotin Quantitation Kit (Pierce), and a degree of labeling of 5.1 biotins per 
TA99 molecule was achieved for the experiments shown. For serum antibody measurement 
during therapy, serum was isolated from mice weekly and incubated with an excess of 
streptavidin resin (GenScript) for 1h at 25°C. Serum was frozen and stored at −80°C and 
thawed on the day of the binding assay, which was performed as described above.
For serum transfer studies, serum was obtained from AIPV treated mice (day 150) or age-
matched naïve mice and complement was inactivated by incubating for 30 minutes at 57°C. 
Serum (350 μL) or TA99 (200 μg) was injected i.p. into naïve recipients six hours prior to 
injection of 250,000 B16F10 cells i.v. through the tail vein. Lungs were isolated 17 days 
later and lung nodules were counted in a blinded fashion.
Generation of Trp2 KO cell line
B16-Trp2-KO cells were generated using CRISPR-Cas9. B16-GFP-Cas9 cells were 
generated by transduction of B16F10 cells with lentivirus expressing humanized SpCas9-
P2A-EGFP from an EFS promoter (unpublished, kindly provided by Tim Wang in Dr. David 
Sabatini’s Lab at the Whitehead Institute). Clones were isolated by single cell flow 
cytometry for GFP positive cells. A clone stably expressing Cas9 was designated B16-GFP-
Cas9. Guide RNA expression vectors were created by cloning a human U6 promoter and 
sgRNA sequences into a minimal vector with an ampicillin-selectable marker and a ColE1 
replication origin. The optimized sgRNA sequence described previously63 were used. 
Sequences for the sgRNAs (Supplementary Table 1) were designed using tools provided by 
the Zhang Lab at the Broad Institute (available at http://crispr.mit.edu/). B16-GFP-Cas9 cells 
were co-transfected with 2 sgRNAs expression vectors targeting Trp2 and a plasmid 
expressing EGFP and a puromycin selectable marker from a CAG promoter using Xfect 
(Clontech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Stable cells were selected for with 2 
μg/mL puromycin followed by single cell FACS. Clones were grown for 3 weeks before 
being analyzed for knockout by PCR amplification of the Trp2 gene (Primers shown in 
Supplementary Table 2). The final clone was then selected and designated B16-Trp2-KO. 
PCR amplification of genomic DNA showed a smaller fragment (Supplementary Fig. 8) and 
sequencing confirmed deletion of the a 283 bp fragment containing the Trp2 peptide 
sequence (data not shown).
ELISPOT assay
Target B16F10, TC-1, or B16-Trp2-KO cells were treated with 500 U/mL mIFN-γ 
(Peprotech) for 12 hr, then irradiated (120 Gy). Effector cells were splenocytes isolated from

 AIPV-treated mice that had rejected tumors 6 days after rechallenge with 106 B16F10 cells. 
A Mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT Kit (BD) was used. Targets cells were seeded at 25,000 cells per 
well. Effector cells were seeded at 106 cells per well. Plates were wrapped in foil and 
cultured for 24 hours then developed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Plates were 
scanned using a CTL-ImmunoSpot Plate Reader and data was analyzed using CTL 
ImmunoSpot Software.
Immunoblot
B16F10 cell lysate was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, 
blocked for 1 hr at 25°C, and then stained with serum from treated mice and rabbit anti-beta-
actin overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then washed and stained with goat anti-mouse-
IRDye800 and anti-rabbit-IRDye680 for 1 hr at 25°C. Imaging was performed on an 
Odyssey scanner (Licor). As a control, TA99 was used in place of mouse serum in the 
protocol above to show the presence of Trp1 in the B16F10 lysate.
Tumor cytokine Luminex assay
Tumors were harvested at day 17 (2 days after 2nd treatment). All tumors from a treatment 
group were collected up to a maximum of ~250 mg for processing in a bead beater tube. 
Tissue samples were lysed in lysis buffer (5 μL/mg tumor): 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% 
glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and freshly supplemented with Halt Protease & 
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Life Technologies). Lysates were aliquoted and stored at 
−80°C until analysis. Samples diluted 1:1 with Assay Buffer and assayed using a Luminex 
bead-based ELISA (MILLIPLEX MAP Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel, 
Millipore) following manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: magnetic 
capture beads and detection antibodies were both used at 1/5x recommended amounts. 
Concentrations were normalized to total protein input. All samples and analytes were above 
the limit of detection.
Histology
Tumor inoculation and treatment were performed following the timeline in Fig. 1a. For 
hematoxylin and eosin staining, mice were sacrificed 3 days after the second treatment, and 
tumors were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin. For immunofluorescence, tumors were isolated on day 14 and processed as previously 
detailed64. Flank tumors were used to analyze infiltrate by immunofluorescence in the 
BRafCA PtenloxP Tyr::CreERT2 model to allow for higher quality sectioning. For staining, 
anti-CD8 (CT-CD8a, Cedar Lane), DAPI, and phalloidin were used. The images were 
acquired using an Olympus Fluoview FV1200 microscope equipped with 10X (NA 0.40) 
and 30X (NA 1.05) objectives and optimum lasers and filter sets. The images were acquired 
under identical acquisition setting and subsequently processed using Fiji image analysis 
software.
Multivariate Analysis of Cytokine Data
Cytokine levels for each tumor were normalized to the median of “Untreated” controls and 
log2 transformed. Heatmaps and clustering trees were generated using the clustergram

 function in Matlab (Mathworks). Euclidean distance was used for hierarchical clustering of 
cytokines only. The resulting dendrogram was pruned by collapsing leaves with Euclidean 
distance <95% confidence interval for all 32 potential leaves.
Partial least squares regression was applied using raw cytokine concentrations (pg/μg total 
protein) regressed against a vector of total tumor mass using PLS_Toolbox R7 (Eigenvector 
Research). Orthogonalization was used to maximize tumor mass variance captured in the 
first latent variable; model performance was assessed by random subsets cross-validation 
with maximum splits and iterations performed.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical methods were not used to predetermine necessary sample size, but sample sizes 
were chosen based on estimates from pilot experiments and previously published results 
such that appropriate statistical tests could yield significant results. Experiments were not 
performed in a blinded fashion. Intratumoral infiltrates, serum transfer foci quantitation, 
tetramer stain, AST, and ALT, were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-
test using GraphPad Prism software. Where ANOVA was used, variance between groups 
was found to be similar by Bartlett’s test. Survival curves were analyzed using the Log-rank 
(Mantel-Cox) test, and two-tailed student’s t test was used for the antigen spreading 
ELISPOT. For the tumor infiltrate data and DC uptake data, Welch’s t test (with Bonferroni 
correction) was used for each condition versus untreated due to unequal variance between 
groups. No samples were excluded from analysis.

 Figure 1. AIPV immunotherapy cures large established tumors and establishes protective 
memory in multiple tumor models
a, Components of AIPV therapy and timeline of treatment. b–g, Groups of mice were 
inoculated with 106 tumor cells s.c. in the flank: B16F10 (b–c, n = 10/group for APV, 20/
group for all other groups) and TC-1 (f–g, n = 8/group) tumor cells were injected in C57Bl/6 
mice while DD-Her2/neu tumor cells (d–e, n = 7 for untreated and AIPV, n = 5 for all other 
groups) were injected in balb/c mice. On day 8 post implantation, AIPV treatment or ternary 
combinations were initiated following the timeline in a. Shown are survival (b, d, f) over 
time and the fraction of long term survivors that rejected a rechallenge with 105 tumor cells 
on day 75 for B16F10 and day 125 for TC-1 and DD-Her2/Neu (c, e, g). Data compiled 
from 2–3 independent experiments. Arrows indicate treatment time points. * p<0.05, **

 Figure 2. AIPV therapy primes sustained vaccine-specific T-cell responses and remodels the 
microenvironment of established tumors
B16F10 tumors in C57Bl/6 mice were treated with AIPV or indicated ternary combinations 
of the therapy components as in Fig. 1a. a–b, Peripheral blood cells were stimulated with 
Trp2 peptide for 6 hours in the presence of brefeldin A and then analyzed by intracellular 
cytokine staining. (a) Representative intracellular cytokine staining to detect Trp2-specific 
CD8+ T-cells in peripheral blood on day 21. (b) Mean±s.e.m. percentage IFN-γ+ among 
CD8+ T-cells over indicated time points (n = 5/group, b). c–f, Mice bearing B16F10 tumors 
were treated with the regimens indicated on the right. Seventeen days later, tumors were 
isolated and cytokine and chemokine levels were measured by Luminex (n = 9/group). (c) 
Five co-regulated clusters of cytokines and chemokines were identified by hierarchical 
cluster analysis and then pruning clusters by applying a threshold to linkage distance 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). (d) These clusters were independently tested for their ability to 
predict log-transformed tumor size in treated mice on day 17 using a single latent variable 
(LV) in an orthogonalized partial least squares regression (oPLSR) model. (e) For the best 
performing cluster 3 (red bar), VIP scores (a measure of each cytokine’s contribution to the 
LV score and overall regression performance) were used to assess the contribution of 
individual proteins from the cluster to the oPLSR model; VIP scores >1 (dotted line) were 
considered significant (top, red bars) and the loading factors for LV1 of the oPLSR model
