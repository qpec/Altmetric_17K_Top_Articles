BACKGROUND: The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified both outdoor air pollution and airborne particulate matter as carcinogenic
to humans (Group 1) for lung cancer. There may be associations with cancer at other sites; however, the epidemiological evidence is limited.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify whether ambient air pollution is associated with specific types of cancer other than lung cancer by
examining associations of ambient air pollution with nonlung cancer death in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II).
METHODS: Analysis included 623,048 CPS-II participants who were followed for 22 y (1982–2004). Modeled estimates of particulate matter with aer-
odynamic diameter <2:5 lm (PM2:5) (1999–2004), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (2006), and ozone (O3) (2002–2004) concentrations were linked to the
participant residence at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations per each fifth percentile–mean increment
with cancer mortality at 29 anatomic sites, adjusted for individual and ecological covariates.
RESULTS: We observed 43,320 nonlung cancer deaths. PM2:5 was significantly positively associated with death from cancers of the kidney {adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) per 4:4 lg=m3 = 1:14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.27]} and bladder [HR = 1:13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.23)]. NO2 was positively
associated with colorectal cancer mortality [HR per 6:5 ppb = 1:06 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.10). The results were similar in two-pollutant models including
PM2:5 and NO2 and in three-pollutant models with O3. We observed no statistically significant positive associations with death from other types of
cancer based on results from adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this large prospective study suggest that ambient air pollution was not associated with death from most nonlung can-
cers, but associations with kidney, bladder, and colorectal cancer death warrant further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1249
Introduction
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classi-
fied outdoor air pollution and airborne particulate matter as carcino-
genic to humans (Group 1) for lung cancer based on findings from
observational and experimental studies as well as from strong mech-
anistic evidence (IARC 2013). Recent meta-analyses reported posi-
tive associations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter
<2:5 lm (PM2:5 {relative risk (RR) per 10 lg=m3 = 1:09 [95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.14]} and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
[RR per 10 lg=m3 = 1:04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.08) with lung cancer
risk (Hamra et al. 2014, 2015). Similar findings were reported in
other recent reviews (Cui et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2016).
Ambient air pollution represents a complex mixture of a
broad range of carcinogenic and mutagenic substances that may
play a role in chronic systemic inflammation, oxidative stress,
and DNA damage in tissues other than the lung (Brook et al.
2010; Crouse et al. 2010; IARC 2012, 2013; Newby et al. 2015).
As such, there may also be associations between ambient air pol-
lution and other types of cancer; however, the epidemiological
evidence for these associations is limited (IARC 2013).
Some previous studies reported positive associations of ambi-
ent air pollution with fatal bladder cancer (Liu et al. 2009), pancre-
atic cancer (Ancona et al. 2015), upper digestive tract, digestive
accessory organs, and breast cancer (Wong et al. 2016), and with
incident brain and cervical cancer (Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2011),
breast cancer (Crouse et al. 2010; Reding et al. 2015), hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma (Pan et al. 2015), and prostate cancer (Parent et al.
2013). Results from other studies of fatal brain cancer (McKean-
Cowdin et al. 2009), incident brain tumors (Poulsen et al. 2016),
and incident leukemia (Winters et al. 2015) were mixed or null.
Previous studies are difficult to compare given variation in the spe-
cific cancers studied; whether outcomes were incident versus fatal
cancers; and differences in study design, sample size, exposure
assessment, and the availability of data on potential confounders.
We previously reported positive associations between long-
term ambient air pollution exposure and lung cancer mortality in
the American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Prevention Study II
(CPS-II) (Jerrett et al. 2013; Krewski et al. 2000, 2009; Turner
et al. 2011, 2014, 2016). For example, we estimated that a
10-lg=m3 increase in PM2:5 concentrations was associated with a

Research
 9% (95% CI: 3, 16%) increase in lung cancer mortality (Turner
et al. 2016, Table E4). The CPS-II is a large-scale prospective
cohort in which the human health effects of ambient air pollution
have been extensively investigated. The objective of this work
was to clarify whether ambient air pollution is associated with
specific types of cancer other than lung cancer by examining
associations of ambient air pollution with nonlung cancer death
among 623,048 CPS-II participants who were followed for 22 y.
Methods
Study Population
Approximately 1.2 million CPS-II participants were enrolled by
77,000 volunteers in 1982 throughout the entire United States,
Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Participants, largely friends
and family members of volunteers, were ≥30 y old with a family
member ≥45 y old. A detailed self-administered questionnaire
was completed at enrollment to obtain demographic, medical,
and behavioral information (CPS-II questionnaires are available
at https://www.cancer.org/research/we-conduct-cancer-research/
epidemiology/cancer-prevention-questionnaires.html). Informed
consent was implied by completion and return of the enrollment
questionnaire. The Emory University School of Medicine
Human Investigations Committee has approved all aspects of
the CPS-II.
Volunteers ascertained the vital status of participants they had
enrolled in 1984, 1986, and 1988, and death certificates, coded
by trained nosologists, were used to determine the underlying
cause of death, that is, “the disease or injury which initiated the
train of morbid events leading directly to death” (WHO 1992).
Since 1989, the National Death Index (NDI) has been used to
determine vital status and underlying cause of death (Calle and
Terrell 1993). Underlying cause of death was categorized accord-
ing to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revisions
9 and 10 (WHO 1977, 1992). More than 99% of known deaths
were assigned a cause.
Ambient Air Pollution Concentrations
PM2:5 concentrations were assigned to the geocoded participant res-
idence at enrollment based on a national-level hybrid land use
regression (LUR) and Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) inter-
polation model (Beckerman et al. 2013) used in previous work
(Jerrett et al. 2016; Pope et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2014; 2016).
Details on the geocoding of participant residences are presented
elsewhere (Pope et al. 2015). A total of 104,172 observations
were collected monthly from 1,464 monitoring sites between
1999 and 2008. Approximately 10% of observations were re-
served for cross-validation. PM2:5 concentrations were predicted
in a base LUR model that included traffic within 1 km (based on
modeled traffic counts) and the cube of green space within
100 m. A BME interpolation model was then used to account for
residual spatiotemporal variation in PM2:5 concentrations, and
the two estimates were combined. The cross-validation R2 was
0.79, suggesting good spatiotemporal model prediction at loca-
tions other than those used to calibrate the model. Mean PM2:5
concentrations at the enrollment residence for the period 1999–
2004 were used in the present analysis to coincide with the
cohort follow-up period.
NO2 concentrations were assigned at the census block group
level to each participant enrollment residence. A national LUR
model was used that incorporated both hourly monitoring data
from 423 monitors and ∼ 4 million satellite-based measurements
in an approximate 10 km × 10 km grid scale, including additional
data on population density, land use, and distance to roadways
for the year 2006 (model R2 = 0:78) (Novotny et al. 2011; Turner
et al. 2016).
Ozone (O3) concentrations were obtained from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Environmental Public Health
Tracking Network Hierarchical Bayesian space time model
(HBM) combining data from national air monitoring stations/
state and local air monitoring stations (NAMS/SLAMS) and the
Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) photo-
chemical model (U.S. EPA 2011). Daily 8-h maximum concen-
trations at a 36 km × 36 km grid scale for the years 2002–2004
were assigned to each participant enrollment residence (Turner
et al. 2016).
Statistical Methods
Both single- and multipollutant Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models were used to estimate associations of ambient PM2:5,
NO2, and O3 concentrations with death from 29 specific types of
cancer according to an increment of the mean minus the fifth per-
centile for each pollutant (4:4 lg=m3 for PM2:5, 6:5 ppb for NO2,
and 6:9 ppb for O3) (Table 1). The fifth percentile–mean incre-
ment was used for comparability of results across pollutants and
with previous work (Turner et al. 2016).
Models were stratified by 1-y age categories, gender, and
race/ethnicity (white, black, other) to allow for separate baseline
hazards according to these characteristics. In addition, in the mul-
tivariate model, we also adjusted for baseline values of education
(<high school, high school, >high school); marital status (single,
married, other); body mass index (BMI); BMI squared; smoking
status (never cigarettes, pipes, or cigars; current cigarette smoker
only; former cigarette smoker only; ever pipe/cigar); cigarettes
per day and cigarettes per day squared (current and former ciga-
rette smokers); years smoked and years smoked squared (current
and former cigarette smokers); started smoking <18 y old (yes/
no) (current and former cigarette smokers); passive smoking
(hours per day exposed to cigarette smoke of others at home,
work, or other areas); usual dietary intake of vegetables, fruit,
and fiber (combined, in quintiles) and fat (quintiles), plus a

aThe land use regression Bayesian maximum entropy (LURBME) PM2:5 model was created in three main steps: a) A base LUR model predicted PM2:5 concentrations based
on traffic within 1 km (based on modeled traffic counts) and the cube of green space within 100 m; b) A BME interpolation model was then used to interpolate residual spatiotem-
poral variation in PM2:5 concentrations; c) The two estimates were then combined. Regional PM2:5 concentrations therefore represent a residual with some observations less than
zero.

 category for missing/bad dietary intake data; usual consumption
of beer (yes, no, missing), wine (yes, no, missing), and liquor
(yes, no, missing); occupational exposures (ever regular exposure
to asbestos, chemicals/acids/solvents, coal or stone dusts, coal
tar/pitch/asphalt, formaldehyde, or diesel engine exhaust) (yes/
no); and an occupational dirtiness index to characterize workplace
PM2:5 exposure based on main lifetime occupation (six categories
of exposure vs. a referent category, or missing) (Siemiatycki et al.
2003). In addition, we used 1990 census data to derive the following
socioecomonic covariates defined at the ZIP-code level for each
participant’s residence at enrollment: median household income,
percentage of African American residents, percentage of Hispanic
residents, percentage of adults with post-secondary education, per-
centage of unemployed residents ≥16 y old, and percentage of resi-
dents with household incomes <125% of the poverty level. For
each characteristic, we modeled the value for the ZIP code of resi-
dence and for a second variable indicating the difference between
that value and the county-level mean (Jerrett et al. 2016; Pope et al.
2015; Turner et al. 2016; U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of
the Census 1993). The time axis was follow-up time in days.
Participants lost to follow-up or who were alive at the end of
follow-up were censored.
For analysis of death from cancers of the uterus, cervix, or
ovary, participants were excluded if they reported a previous hys-
terectomy or an artificial (vs. a natural) menopause (n = 108,956).
An additional 7,143 participants were also excluded from analysis
of ovarian cancer mortality if they reported having undergone an
ovarian surgery because no information was available to distin-
guish partial from total oophorectomy.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the influence
of including additional baseline variables in the model including
usual physical exercise (none, slight, moderate, heavy, missing),
aspirin use in the past month (yes/no), and usual dietary intake of
red meat (quintiles) for analysis of all cancer sites, as well as
self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes (yes/no). Detailed
reproductive and hormonal variables, including age at menarche
(<12 y old, 12–13 y old, ≥14 y old, missing), parity (0, 1, 2, 3,
≥4, missing), age at first birth (none, <20 y old, 20–29 y old,
≥30 y old, missing), ever oral contraceptive use (yes, no, miss-
ing), ever postmenopausal hormone use (yes, no, missing), and
postmenopausal status (yes, no, missing) were also included in
models for sensitivity analysis of female reproductive cancers.
Additional analyses were also performed in postmenopausal
women only.
Further, we decomposed PM2:5 concentrations into near-
source and regional fractions to determine whether associations
might vary for PM2:5 from different air pollution sources (Turner
et al. 2016). Near-source PM2:5 concentrations were PM2:5 con-
centrations predicted at each monitoring station based on land-
use and traffic count data using the LUR model created in the first
stage of the LURBME modeling process. Regional PM2:5 was
derived by subtracting the near-source PM2:5 concentration from
the total PM2:5 concentrations from the LURBME model, thereby
capturing spatial variation in PM2:5 concentrations between mon-
itoring stations.
Finally, where there were statistically significant positive
associations observed, potential effect modification by gender,
education (<high school, high school, >high school), and smok-
ing status (never cigarettes, pipes, or cigars; current cigarette
smoker only; former cigarette smoker only) was assessed on a
multiplicative scale. Two-sided p-values were calculated accord-
ing to the likelihood ratio statistic to compare models with and
without multiplicative interaction terms between air pollutants
and the potential modifiers. The proportional hazards assumption
was tested by including interaction terms between ambient air
pollution and follow-up time in the multivariate proportional haz-
ards models. A p-value <0:05 was used to define statistical sig-
nificance throughout this work.
SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc.) was used to conduct all
analyses. Ethics approval for analysis was obtained from the
Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board.
Results
From 1982 through 2004 there were a total of 743,543 (62.8%)
participants who were alive and 438,123 (37.0%) who had died.
Participants were excluded from analysis because of missing
or invalid residence information (n = 385,422) or selected base-
line covariate data (n = 130,119) (Jerrett et al. 2016; Pope et al.
2015; Turner et al. 2016) or having a prevalent cancer (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer) at enrollment (n = 45,998). Follow-up
was censored in September 1988 for 2,921 (0.2%) of participants
who had insufficient information to link to the NDI. The present
analysis is based on 623,048 CPS-II participants among whom
43,320 nonlung cancer deaths were observed during 11,936,799
person-years of follow-up. Follow-up ranged from 0.01 y to 22.5 y
with a mean (SD) of 19.2 (5.6) y.
Mean (SD) PM2:5, NO2, and O3 concentrations at the participant
residence at enrollment were 12:6 ð2:8Þ lg=m3, 11:6 ð5:1Þ ppb, and
38:2 ð4:0Þ ppb, respectively (Table 1). Correlations between these
air pollutants ranged from a weak inverse correlation between
NO2 and O3 (r = − 0:09) to a moderate positive correlation
between PM2:5 and NO2 (r = 0:40) (see Table S1).
Participant characteristics are presented in Table 2 and Table
S2. The majority of participants were 40 y old to 69 y old at
enrollment, 94.5% of participants were white, 55.3% were
female, and 57.4% had a greater than high school education. A
total of 44.7% of study participants were never smokers.
There was little variation in ambient air pollution concentra-
tions by participant characteristics, although somewhat higher
PM2:5 and NO2 concentrations were observed in the younger and
older age groups and among participants who were black or “other”
race/ethnicity (Table 2). O3 concentrations were slightly higher in
older participants, in those with a low BMI (<18:5 kg=m2), and
among never smokers.
The results from single-pollutant models per each fifth per-
centile–mean increment are presented in Table S3 according to
the minimally adjusted model and in Table 3 according to the
fully adjusted model. In the minimally adjusted model, there
were several significant positive associations of PM2:5 and colo-
rectal, breast, cervical, and bladder cancer mortality and of NO2
and stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, breast, and bladder cancer
mortality as well as some significant inverse associations largely
with O3. Fewer significant findings were observed in the fully
adjusted models, with significant positive associations of PM2:5
and mortality from kidney [HR per 4:4 lg=m3 = 1:14 (95% CI:
1.03, 1.27)] and bladder [HR = 1:13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.23)] cancer
observed (Table 3) [or equivalently per each 10 lg=m3, HRs =
1:36 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.73) and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.61), respec-
tively]. There was a positive HR for colorectal cancer mortality
[HR = 1:04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08)] of borderline significance
(p = 0:08). The largest HR was observed for mortality from cervi-
cal cancer [HR = 1:34 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.83)], although this result
was no longer significant and was based on a small number of
deaths (n = 115). For NO2, there was a weak positive association
with mortality from colorectal cancer [HR per 6:5 ppb = 1:06
(95% CI: 1.02, 1.10)] [or equivalently HR = 1:09 (95% CI: 1.03,
1.16) per 10 ppb]. For O3, HRs were generally <1, with statisti-
cally significant inverse associations with mortality from stomach
cancer [HR per 6:9 ppb = 0:90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99)], pancreatic

The results were similar with further adjustment for physical
exercise, aspirin use, and red meat intake for all cancer sites as
well as with additional reproductive and hormonal variables for
female reproductive cancers (see Tables S4 and S5). The results
for female reproductive cancers were also similar upon restriction
to postmenopausal women only. The results were similar in two-
pollutant models including PM2:5 and NO2 (see Table S6) and in
three-pollutant models with O3 (see Table S7).
Upon decomposition of total PM2:5, there were statistically
significant positive associations of both bladder and kidney can-

 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.29), respectively] of similar magnitude per unit
increment to those of total PM2:5 but not with near-source PM2:5
[HRs per 1:6 lg=m3 = 1:02 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.13) and 1.05 (95%
CI: 0.92, 1.13), respectively] (see Table S8). There were also sig-
nificant positive associations of near-source PM2:5 and mortality
from cancer of the stomach [HR per 1:6 lg=m3 = 1:13 (95% CI:
1.02, 1.26)] and colorectum [HR = 1:09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15)] but
not with regional PM2:5 [HRs per 4:5 lg=m3 = 0:97 (95% CI:
0.88, 1.06) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.07), respectively]. There
was also a positive HR for pancreatic cancer mortality with near-
source PM2:5 [HR = 1:06 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.13)] of borderline sig-
nificance (p = 0:06), but not with regional PM2:5 [HR = 0:96
(95% CI: 0.90, 1.01)].
In stratified analyses of associations of PM2:5 with kidney and
bladder cancer mortality and of NO2 with colorectal cancer mor-
tality, associations of PM2:5 with kidney and bladder cancer mor-
tality appeared to be limited to men [HR = 1:23 (95% CI: 1.08,
1.40) and HR = 1:16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.29), respectively], with lit-
tle or no evidence of associations in women [HR = 1:00 (95% CI:
0.83, 1.20) and HR = 1:03 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.23), respectively],
although differences between men and women were not signifi-
cant (interaction p-values of 0.13 and 0.25, respectively) (see
Table S9). There was no clear evidence of effect modification
according to categories of smoking status (interaction p-values
≥0:30). Associations of NO2 with colorectal cancer mortality
were somewhat stronger among those with a <high school or
high school level of education [HR = 1:12 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.24)
and HR = 1:15 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.23), respectively] compared with
a >high school level of education [HR = 0:99 (95% CI: 0.94,
1.05); p for interaction = 0:03]. There was no evidence that the
proportional hazards assumption was violated for associations at
these sites (p > 0:05) (data not shown).
Discussion
Ambient air pollution was not associated with death from most
nonlung cancers in our large prospective study population.
However, there were statistically significant positive associations
between PM2:5 and death from bladder and kidney cancer, rang-
ing from 13–14% increases in risk per each fifth percentile–mean
increment (4:4 lg=m3). For NO2, there was a statistically signifi-
cant positive association with colorectal cancer mortality of 6%
per 6:5 ppb. The results were similar in two-pollutant models
including both PM2:5 and NO2 as well as in three-pollutant mod-
els with O3. The magnitudes of the associations here were some-
what stronger than, although compatible with, those of PM2:5 and
lung cancer mortality observed in previous work [9% (95% CI: 3,
16%) per 10 lg=m3 or equivalently, 4% (95% CI: 1, 7%) per
4:4 lg=m3] (Turner et al. 2016).
A small but growing body of literature has examined associa-
tions between ambient air pollution and nonlung cancer risk;
however, the evidence for such associations is limited. For blad-
der cancer, a Spanish hospital-based case–control study including
1,219 incident cases and 1,271 controls reported that living

 >40 y in a city of >100,000 inhabitants was associated with a
significantly higher risk of the disease [odds ratio ðORÞ = 1:30
(95% CI: 1.04, 1.63)] (Castaño-Vinyals et al. 2008). In a death
certificate–based case–control study in Taiwan, including 680
bladder cancer deaths and 680 matched noncancer or nongeni-
tourinary death controls, there were significant positive trends
with increasing tertiles of particulate matter with aerodynamic di-
ameter <10 lm (PM10), NO2, and sulfur dioxide (SO2), but not
with carbon monoxide (CO) or O3 concentrations (Liu et al.
2009). There was a positive, nonsignificant association between
nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations and bladder cancer inci-
dence (n =
221) [incidence rate ratio (IRR) per 100 lg=
m3 = 1:32 (95% CI: 0.80, 2.19)] in an analysis of 54,304 partici-
pants in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort (Raaschou-
Nielsen et al. 2011). In a retrospective cohort study of 85,559
individuals in Malagrotta (Rome, Italy), there was a positive
association between hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentrations from
a municipal waste landfill and bladder cancer mortality in women
[HR per 0:043 lg=m3 = 1:35 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.82), n = 12], but
not in men [HR = 0:88 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.52), n = 61] (Ancona
et al. 2015). Taken together, the results from our study and those
from most previous studies are generally consistent with the
recent IARC evaluation noting a positive association in studies of
outdoor air pollution and bladder cancer risk (IARC 2013).
There was no association [HR per 10 lg=m3 = 0:98 (95% CI:
0.58, 1.64)] between PM2:5 and urinary cancer mortality (includ-
ing 155 bladder and kidney cancer deaths combined) in a cohort
of 66,820 elderly Hong Kong residents (Wong et al. 2016). The
Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort reported a positive, although
imprecise, association of NOx with kidney cancer incidence [IRR =
1:73 (95% CI: 0.89, 3.73) per 100 lg=m3 (Raaschou-Nielsen et al.
2011). A total of 95 kidney cancer cases were observed in that
study.
Few studies of colorectal cancer have been reported to date.
Although our study showed a significant positive association
between NO2 and death from colorectal cancer and a borderline
association with PM2:5, a Hong Kong cohort reported no associa-
tion [HR per 10 lg=m3 = 1:01 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.30)] between
PM2:5 concentrations and mortality from cancers of the lower
digestive tract (n = 719) (Wong et al. 2016). There were nonsigni-
ficant inverse associations in men and women for PM10 concentra-
tions from a waste incinerator and colorectal cancer mortality
(n = 149 deaths in men and 95 deaths in women) in Malagrotta
(Ancona et al. 2015). There were also nonsignificant inverse associ-
ations for NOx concentrations and both colon and rectal cancer inci-
dence in Denmark (n = 414 and 246 cases, respectively) (Raaschou-
Nielsen et al. 2011). The number of included colorectal cancer
deaths (>6,000) in CPS-II here is substantially larger than the num-
bers of cases/deaths in previous studies.
When PM2:5 concentrations were decomposed into near-
source and regional components, there were stronger associations
for near-source PM2:5 with colorectal (and stomach) cancer mor-
tality, supporting similar findings for NO2, and for regional
PM2:5 with both bladder and kidney cancer mortality. Little is
known regarding the role of different air pollution sources or
components in cancer, including at sites other than the lung. We
have not specifically examined what PM2:5 sources were further
related to this decomposition.
Studies of occupational exposure to diesel engine exhaust and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are formed dur-
ing incomplete combustion processes, have suggested positive
associations with both bladder and kidney cancer (Brown et al.
2012; IARC 2005; Siemiatycki et al. 2004). Recent population-
based case–control studies of men in Canada reported positive
associations between any exposure to high concentrations of
occupational diesel exhaust and both bladder [OR = 1:64 (95%
CI: 0.87, 3.08), n = 658 cases and 1,360 controls] and rectal
[OR = 1:98 (95% CI: 1.09, 3.60), n = 840 cases and 1,360 con-
trols] cancer incidence, which increased among those with
>10 years of exposure (Kachuri et al. 2016; Latifovic et al.
2015). Studies of workers in dusty occupations (e.g., mineral
dust, wood dust), as well as in steel and iron processing, have
also noted positive associations with colorectal and stomach can-
cer (Kreuzer et al. 2012; Oddone et al. 2014; Raj et al. 2003;
Santibañez et al. 2012).
The largest HR was for PM2:5 in relation to death from cervi-
cal cancer, although the findings were based on only 115 deaths
and were not statistically significant. The positive association
with NO2 was weaker. In the Danish Diet Cancer and Health
study, the strongest association was between NOx and cervical
cancer incidence [i.e., IRR = 2:45 (95% CI: 1.01, 5.93) per
100 lg=m3], but it was based on only 35 cases (Raaschou-
Nielsen et al. 2011). In both studies, there were no data on human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection (or on other potentially relevant
infections for cancer mortality at other sites, e.g., Helicobacter
pylori for stomach cancer or hepatitis B or C for liver cancer),
and confounding cannot be ruled out. There was also no informa-
tion on access to or compliance with cervical cancer screening
programs, which may differ in areas with differing levels of ambi-
ent air pollution. However, we adjusted our models for a range of
area-level socioecomonic covariates and screening rates in a sub-
set of CPS-II participants for both breast (>90%) and colorectal
(>65%) cancer were high (Patel et al. 2003; Stevens et al. 2011).
A recent cross-sectional study of women from a clinical trial of
cervical disease diagnostic techniques in Texas reported a posi-
tive association of cervical dysplasia with residential census-tract
level estimates of ambient benzene, diesel particulate matter, and
PAH concentrations (Scheurer et al. 2014).
Although we found no significant associations with death
from breast cancer based on fully adjusted models, other studies
reported positive associations between ambient air pollution and
breast cancer incidence (Crouse et al. 2010; Mordukhovich et al.
2016; Reding et al. 2015). Crouse et al. (2010) reported a positive
association between NO2 concentrations and postmenopausal
breast cancer incidence [OR per 5 ppb = 1:31 (95% CI: 1.00,
1.71)] in a hospital-based case–control study including 383 case and
416 control participants. The prospective U.S. Sister Study reported
no association between PM10, PM2:5, or NO2 concentrations and
incident breast cancer overall in an analysis of 47,591 partici-
pants including 1,749 breast cancer cases, but a positive associa-
tion was reported between NO2 and estrogen receptor ðERÞ + =
progesterone receptor ðPRÞ + disease
[HR
per
5:8 ppb = 1:10
(95% CI: 1.02, 1.19)] (Reding et al. 2015). In our mortality-based
study, no information on ER or PR status was available.
There was no positive association of any ambient air pollutant
and total leukemia mortality in the present study. There was a
positive association of NO2 concentrations at the residence with
incident adult acute myeloid leukemia [OR per 10 mg=m3 = 1:31
(95% CI: 1.02, 1.65), n = 531] but not with other leukemia sub-
types in a Danish case-control study (Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2016).
There was no positive association of PM2:5 with total incident leu-
kemia or with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a Canadian case–
control study of 1,064 total case and 5,039 control participants
(Winters et al. 2015). There was no information on leukemia sub-
type in CPS-II.
There was no association of any ambient air pollutant with total
brain cancer mortality in this analysis, which included 1,591 brain
cancer deaths. The Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort reported a
positive association of NOx with incident brain tumor risk [IRR per
100 lg=m3 NOx = 2:28 (95% CI: 1.25, 4.19)] (Raaschou-Nielsen
Environmental Health Perspectives
087013-7
 et al. 2011), although there were few brain tumor cases (n = 95). A
subsequent national case–control study in Denmark with a larger
number of incident brain tumor cases (n = 4,183) reported a signifi-
cant positive association of NOx concentrations ≥100 lg=m3 with
nongliomas [OR = 2:30 (95% CI: 1.15, 4.59)] but not with gliomas
[OR = 0:89 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.77)] (Poulsen et al. 2016). There was
no information on tumor histology or cranial location in CPS-II.
In the present study, there were no clear positive, and some
cases there were significant inverse, associations observed with
O3 in both single- and multipollutant models possibly owing to
broader spatial patterns in ambient air pollution concentrations,
to negative correlations with other air pollutants, and to the larger
spatial scale of O3 concentrations, which were unable to capture
fine-scale variation and scavenging effects in urban areas (Williams
et al. 2014). O3 is thought to increase DNA damage (U.S. EPA
2013), which plays a role in several types of cancer. However, in
previous studies of the CPS-II cohort, O3 was not associated with
lung cancer death (Jerrett et al. 2013; Krewski et al. 2009; Pope
et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2016). A positive association between am-
bient O3 and incident male lung cancer was reported in the
Adventist Health Study on Smog (AHSMOG), although few lung
cancers were observed (n = 16) (Beeson et al. 1998).
Strengths of this study include a large-scale, well-established
cohort design with large numbers of nonlung cancer deaths
observed at many cancer sites. Air pollution exposures were esti-
mated at each participant’s residence using national-level expo-
sure surfaces that have previously been used to examine
mortality associations in CPS-II (Jerrett et al. 2016; Pope et al.
2015; Turner et al. 2014; 2016). Detailed data were collected at
enrollment on a variety of cancer risk factors including cigarette
smoking, occupation, diet, and various hormonal and reproduc-
tive factors.
The main limitation of this study is the use of cancer mortality
rather than cancer incidence end points, with inferences of associ-
ations of ambient air pollution here reflecting both disease inci-
dence and survival following diagnosis. Because lung cancer is
rapidly fatal, with 5-y survival rates ranging from ∼ 13–18% for
the periods 1987–1989 and 2005–2011 respectively, the use of
mortality
data
reasonably
approximates
disease
incidence
(American Cancer Society 2016). Other rapidly fatal cancer sites
include the pancreas (5-year survival = 4–8%), the liver and intra-
hepatic bile duct (5–18%), the esophagus (10–20%), the stomach
(20–30%), and the brain and other nervous system sites (29–35%)
(American Cancer Society 2016). In contrast, survival is greater
for cancer at other sites, including the urinary bladder, the kidney
and renal pelvis, and the colorectum, of interest here (5-y survival
ranging from 57–79%), with survival from disease playing an
increasing role in associations with ambient air pollution
observed here (American Cancer Society 2016).
There is little research on whether ambient air pollution may
be related to cancer progression or survival. One recent study of
>350,000 California lung cancer patients reported that higher
residential ambient air pollution concentrations (NO2, PM2:5,
PM10) were associated with poorer survival, particularly among
patients diagnosed in earlier disease states (i.e., with localized
disease) (Eckel et al. 2016). Mean ambient air pollution concen-
trations were also somewhat higher among those diagnosed with
more advanced disease and among those with an unknown stage
at diagnosis (i.e., either patients who were dying before stage in-
formation was obtained or who had limited workup performed),
possibly reflecting differences in access to medical care, which
may vary by levels of ambient air pollution. Little is known
regarding possible impacts at other cancer sites, although reduced
breast cancer survival was associated with higher PM2:5 and
PM10 concentrations in another study (Hu et al. 2013). Further
studies of nonlung cancer incidence are needed to disentangle the
observed associations with ambient air pollution.
Covariate data were only available at enrollment and were not
updated over the follow-up period in CPS-II. It is unlikely that
CPS-II participants would begin smoking cigarettes over the
follow-up time, given the mean age of >55 years at enrollment,
although participants may increasingly become former smokers.
There were also limited data on occupational exposure history.
Participant residence data were also only available at enrollment.
Changes in participant residence after enrollment as well as
changes in coding of the underlying cause of death over the
follow-up period would likely be nondifferential and would result
in attenuation of the magnitude of the associations observed. A
Canadian study observed little impact of accounting for residen-
tial mobility on PM2:5 or O3 mortality associations; however,
associations with more spatially resolved NO2 strengthened
somewhat (Crouse et al. 2015).
There is also a lack of historical ambient air pollution data,
although correlations between PM2:5 and O3 concentrations
assigned to CPS-II participants over recent decades were moder-
ately strong, ranging from approximately 0.6 to >0:8, indicating
that the use of more recent ambient air pollution estimates may
be reflective of longer-term exposure patterns (Krewski et al.
2009; Pope et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2016). The rank ordering of
U.S. cities was also similar over time in the context of generally
declining ambient air pollution concentrations. The use of recent
ambient air pollution estimates may result in somewhat inflated
HRs because increments of recent concentrations represent
greater contrasts of historically higher concentrations (Krewski
et al. 2009; Pope et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2016). Little is known
regarding potential latency periods for cancer development in
relation with ambient air pollution concentrations, which may
also differ from those of lung cancer.
Correlations among pollutants were generally weak. Ambient
air
pollution
concentrations were estimated using
different
approaches at different time periods and different geographic units
of scale, possibly complicating interpretation of the correlation
structure among pollutants. The LURBME model outperformed a
range of other geostatistical and remote sensing PM2:5 models in
the CPS-II (Jerrett et al. 2016). Similar positive cardiorespiratory
mortality–O3 associations were observed in recent work with O3
concentrations estimated at either 12 km × 12 km or 36 km ×
36 km scales in the Eastern United States (Turner et al. 2016).
Owing to multiple testing and to the large number of cancer
sites evaluated (n = 29), it is possible that some of the significant
associations observed may be due to chance. As such, the results
of this study should be replicated in other studies, particularly in
studies of cancer incidence. Finally, our findings may not be
entirely generalizable because CPS-II participants are of gener-
ally higher socioeconomic status and more limited racial/ethnic
composition than the broader U.S. population.
Potential mechanisms through which ambient air pollution
may be associated with other nonlung cancers remain to be fully
elucidated; however, ambient air pollution represents a complex
mixture of exposure to a broad range of carcinogenic and mu-
tagenic substances, including PAHs and other aromatic hydrocar-
bons, benzene, metals, and xenoestrogens, which may be trans-
ported and metabolized in the body (Crouse et al. 2010; IARC
2012, 2013). Populations exposed to outdoor air pollutants and to
diesel engine exhaust have elevated urinary 1-hydroxypyrene and
hemoglobin adducts of nitro-PAHs and low-molecular-weight
alkenes (Ciarrocca et al. 2014; Duan et al. 2016; IARC 2012,
2013). A recent study of 23,820 participants in Taiwan, including
464 incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, reported a
positive association of PM2:5 with HCC incidence, which may
Environmental Health Perspectives
087013-8
 have been mediated by alanine transaminase levels, suggesting
that PM2:5 exposure may lead to HCC via chronic inflammation
(Pan et al. 2015).
Active cigarette smoking has also been associated with a
range of other nonlung cancers, including cancers in various uri-
nary and digestive sites such as the bladder, the kidney, and the
colorectum, among others (Carter et al. 2015; IARC 2009).
However, levels of exposure to PM2:5 from ambient air pollution
are substantially lower and of differing chemical composition and
toxicity compared with those from active cigarette smoking or
occupational exposure (Pope et al. 2011).
Patients with a history of diabetes, which has also been linked
with ambient air pollution (Eze et al. 2015; Pope et al. 2015),
have also been observed to be at increased risk for bladder, kid-
ney, and colorectal cancers, although it is unclear whether this is
due to shared underlying risk factors (such as obesity) or to other
metabolic features of the disease (such as hyperinsulinemia,
hyperglycemia, or chronic inflammation) (Campbell et al. 2012;
Giovannucci et al. 2010). The results herein were virtually
unchanged with further adjustment for prevalent diabetes at
enrollment (not shown).
Conclusion
The results from this large prospective study suggest that ambient
air pollution was not associated with most nonlung cancer causes
of death. Nonetheless, observed associations with mortality from
kidney, bladder, and colorectal cancer merit further research, par-
ticularly in studies of cancer incidence.
