vidence of identity and proof of 
Australian citizenship is essential to 
access many rights, including obtaining 
a passport or driver’s licence and opening 
bank accounts. For most Australians, a birth 
certificate is the first documentary evidence 
of identity. However, a birth certificate can 
only be obtained once the birth has been 
registered, and the births of many Australians, 
particularly Aboriginal Australians, are not 
registered when they are babies. In 2012, 
1% of all new birth registrations in Australia 
were for people born in 2005 or earlier; that 
is, the person being registered was already 
6 years of age or older.1 For Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander Australians (hereafter 
referred to as Aboriginal), the proportion 
was 8%. In Western Australia (WA), delayed 
registrations were even more common at 
15% for Aboriginal people, nine times that of 
non-Aboriginal Western Australians (1.7%).1 
In WA, the paperwork to register a birth 
is supplied to the parents by the hospital 
or midwife and it includes certification of 
the birth from a doctor or midwife. If the 
paperwork is lost, a replacement must be 
requested from the hospital or midwife. If 
only one parent has signed the form, that 
parent must provide a written explanation of 
why the other parent has not signed. It is a 
legal requirement that an application for birth 
registration is made to the WA Registry of 
Births, Deaths and Marriages (‘the Registry’) 
within 60 days of birth. Birth registration is 
free, but obtaining a birth certificate costs 
$47.2 Births must be registered with the state 
or territory in which they occurred.
It is not known how many Aboriginal people 
in Western Australia today have not had 
their births registered, or why their births 
were not registered. Given the importance of 
birth registration and to inform strategies to 
increase the proportion of Aboriginal births 
registered, in this study we examined factors 
associated with birth registration for babies 
born to Aboriginal mothers in WA from 1980 
to 2010. 
Methods
This study was approved by the Western 
Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics 
Committee (Ref 306 – 08/10) and the Western 
Australian Department of Health Ethics 
Committee (Ref 2010/42). 
Study cohort and data sources
The study sample comprised all children 
born alive in WA from 1980 to 2010, whose 
mothers were recorded as Aboriginal and/or 
Torres Strait Islander on their own Midwives

Abstract
Objective: Evidence of identity, particularly a birth certificate, is essential to access many rights. 
However, the births of many Aboriginal Australians are not registered when they are infants. 
We examined factors related to birth registration among Western Australian children born to 
Aboriginal mothers.
Methods: All births to Aboriginal mothers in the Midwives Notification System in Western 
Australia (WA) from 1980 to 2010 were linked to birth registrations. Associations between 
registration and maternal and child characteristics were examined for children aged under 16 
years in 2012. 
Results: Among 49,694 births between 1980 and 2010, 18% of those aged under 16 years had 
unregistered births, compared to 3% of those aged 16–32 years. Unregistered births were 
most strongly associated with young maternal age at first birth (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.22; 
95%CI 3.07-8.86; for 16 years or younger vs 30 years or older, among non-smokers), remoteness 
(AOR 2.17; 95%CI 1.87-2.52; very remote vs major cities), mothers whose own birth was 
unregistered (AOR 3.00; 95%CI 1.78-5.07) and no private hospital insurance (AOR 0.19; 95%CI 
0.11-0.31; insured vs uninsured).
Conclusions: Unregistered births are common among WA Aboriginal children, particularly in 
disadvantaged families. 
Implications: Assistance before discharge from hospital may increase birth registrations.

Notification System (MNS) record or the 
record of a sibling with the same mother 
(49,694 people). All births of infants of 20 
weeks or more gestation and/or 400 grams or 
more birthweight must be notified to the WA 
Department of Health by attending midwives 
or medical officers. Information in the MNS 
includes details of the birth and medical 
conditions affecting the pregnancy. 
While the MNS has all births that were 
attended or had follow-up care provided 
by a midwife or doctor, birth registration 
records only include those children where 
the parent/s have lodged an application to 
register the birth. Registration records contain 
demographic information about the child 
and parents.
The parents and siblings of the study sample 
were identified in the Family Connections 
System. The Family Connections System links 
family members who are resident in WA, 
primarily using birth, death and marriage 
records.3 Children whose mother was not 
identified in the Family Connections System 
were excluded (45 children). 
Birth registration records, inpatient hospital 
records (Hospital Morbidity Data System 
[HMDS]) and the Mental Health Information 
System (MHIS) up to 30 June 2011 were 
available for the study sample and their 
parents and siblings. Probabilistic linkage 
of the records was undertaken by the Data 
Linkage Branch in the Department of Health 
Western Australia (DOHWA). 
Study factors
Each infant’s date of birth and sex, as well 
as whether their mother smoked during 
the pregnancy (‘maternal smoking during 
pregnancy’
, comprehensively available 
from 1998 onwards) and their mother’s 
marital status at the time of the birth were 
obtained from the MNS. Census Collection 
Districts (CDs) and postcodes from the 
MNS and HDMS were mapped to one of 
the remoteness categories (Major Cities, 
Inner Regional, Outer Regional, Remote 
or Very Remote) of the Accessibility/
Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA+) 
using correspondence files from the ABS. 
Similarly, the infant’s CD or postcode was 
mapped to the ABS Socio-Economic Indexes 
for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Relative Socio-
Economic Advantage and Disadvantage. 
Quintiles of socioeconomic status were 
created using the entire population of 
Western Australia (WA) and the cut-points 
of those quintiles were used to assign our 
sample to socioeconomic categories. Further 
details about the assignment of remoteness 
and socioeconomic status are in the 
Supplementary Information (available with 
the online version of this article). 
For each child, the age at which their mother 
had her first child (‘maternal age at first birth’) 
was obtained by identifying her first child 
through the Family Connections System and 
the dates of birth shown on her children’s 
records. As we did not have birth records for 
births outside Western Australia, those births 
were not included in the calculation of the 
mother’s age at first birth.
The hospital in which the child’s birth took 
place, or to which the mother was admitted 
within a week of the birth with a diagnosis 
that the birth was outside hospital, was 
categorised as tertiary, public metropolitan, 
private metropolitan or (public or private) 
rural hospital. In 1980−2010, 1% of births 
did not link to a hospital admission and the 
hospital category was coded as ‘no hospital 
admission’
.
Whether the child’s mother had private 
hospital insurance at the time of the 
child’s birth, an individual level marker of 
socioeconomic status, was obtained from the 
HMDS. This information was recorded in the 
HMDS from 1999 onwards.
Maternal alcohol use, drug use and mental 
health conditions were identified from the 
HMDS, MHIS and MNS. Where a diagnosis was 
recorded for a hospital admission or mental 
health episode within a year of the child’s 
birth, or on the MNS birth record, the mother 
was categorised as positive for alcohol or 
drug use or mental health conditions for 
that birth. Additionally, if a child had any 
hospital diagnosis of being affected by 
alcohol or drugs as a foetus or newborn, 
the mother was also categorised as positive 
for alcohol or drug use. The Supplementary 
Information (available online) lists the codes 
of the International Classification of Diseases, 
9th and 10th Revisions (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-
AM) used. For alcohol and drug use, we 
modified the diagnoses used by Derrington 
et al., excluding codes for chronic diseases 
associated with long-term, past abuse, as we 
were interested in ongoing use around the 
time of birth.4 For mental health, we used the 
diagnoses used by O’Donnell et al., excluding 
the alcohol and drug-related codes.5 
For most mothers, information was available 
about whether their own birth was registered 
and a variable ‘mother’s birth registered’ was 
created. As smoking during pregnancy was 
not comprehensively recorded on the MNS 
prior to 1998, private hospital insurance on 
the HMDS was not recorded until 1999, and 
the birth registration status of mothers born 
prior to 1980 or outside WA was not known, 
categories of ‘missing’ were created for these 
variables.
Analysis
To estimate the trends in birth registration 
over time, a joinpoint regression model was 
fitted to the proportion of unregistered births 
for each year of birth from 1980 to 2010.6 
Joinpoint regression analysis also identifies 
years when the linear trend significantly 
changes (joinpoints). Joinpoint 4.1.1.1 
was used.7 Additional information about 
the joinpoint regression appears in the 
Supplementary Material (available online).
To examine associations between a range 
of demographic factors and registration 
of births, logistic regression was used with 
a generalised estimating equation (GEE) 
approach to allow for lack of independence 
among siblings and to estimate the intra-
family correlation. We restricted the analysis 
to the 26,404 people who were born on 25 
April 1996 or later, as these children were 
under 16 years old when the birth registration 
data was extracted. This age group was more 
likely to be dependent on their parents to 
register their births and less likely to have 
strong incentives to seek birth registration, 
such as applying for a driver’s licence.
Factors examined were: year of birth (input 
as a continuous variable, with the slope 
free to change at the joinpoints identified 
by joinpoint regression analysis); sex; 
maternal age at birth of first child (16 years 
or younger, 17–19, 20–24, 25–29 and 30 
years or older); maternal relationship status 
at the time of birth (married/de facto, never 
married, divorced/widowed/separated, 
missing); socioeconomic status (by quintile); 
remoteness (major cities, inner regional, 
outer regional, remote or very remote); 
hospital category for birth (tertiary, public 
metropolitan, private metropolitan, rural, no 
hospital record); smoking during pregnancy 
(yes, no, unknown); alcohol-related diagnosis 
within a year of the birth (yes, no); drug-
related diagnosis within a year of the birth 
(yes, no); mental health diagnosis within a 
year of the birth (yes, no); private hospital 
insurance at time of birth (yes, no, unknown); 
and mother’s own birth registered (yes, no, 
unknown).

Variables that were significant in univariate 
GEE analysis at p<0.05 were entered 
simultaneously. As they remained significant 
and there was no evidence of collinearity, 
all variables were retained. All two-way 
interactions were tested individually and 
retained if they remained significant at p<0.05 
in the presence of the other interactions. 
Checks for collinearity were conducted (see 
Supplementary Information, available online).
The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 
was obtained from an intercept-only GEE 
logistic regression model with the working 
correlation matrix specified as exchangeable. 
It represents the agreement in birth 
registration status for siblings with the same 
mother.
The Aboriginal status of some mothers 
was not consistently recorded across the 
midwives’ records of all of their children. 
To assess the impact of this, we conducted 
two sensitivity analyses; first, we excluded 
all children whose MNS record listed their 
mother as non-Aboriginal (2,615/26,404 
[9.9%] children), and second, we excluded all 
families where the mother was recorded as 
non-Aboriginal on at least one child’s record 
(5,503/26,404 [20.8%] children).
Results 
Of 49,694 children born to Aboriginal 
mothers from 1980 to 2010, 5,272 (11%) did 
not link to a birth registration. The proportion 
of unregistered births varied greatly by year 
of birth (Figure 1). Changes in trend were 
found by joinpoint analysis at 1992 and 2005. 
Those who were born in or before 1992 were 
at least 19 years old at the time the data was 
extracted and they had the highest level of 
birth registration. Children born in the mid-
2000s, who were around 7 years old when 
the registration data was extracted, were the 
most likely to have unregistered births. 
Among those who were aged under 16 
years, 18% of births were unregistered 
(Table 1). Unregistered births were more 
common with mothers who were teenagers 
when they had their first child, lived in more 
socioeconomically deprived and remote 
areas, gave birth in a rural hospital, smoked 
during pregnancy, had an alcohol-related 
diagnosis around the time of the birth, did 
not have private hospital insurance and 
whose mother’s own birth was not registered.

status at the time of birth, and drug and 
mental health-related diagnoses around the

time of birth were not associated with birth 
registration. The proportion with private 
insurance was very low at 3%, and maternal 
smoking during pregnancy was high (49% of 
those with known smoking status). Both were 
constant over the study period.
In the fully adjusted model, which included 
the factors listed in Tables 2a and 2b, the 
mother’s age at the birth of her first child 
remained a strong predictor of whether 
the birth was registered. The effect was 
particularly strong for mothers who did not 
smoke during the pregnancy; the odds of an 
unregistered birth were five times higher for 
mothers who had their first child at 16 years 
or younger, compared to 30 years or older 
(odds ratio (OR) 5.22, 95% Confidence Interval 
(CI) 3.07-8.86). The offspring of mothers who 
did not have a registered birth themselves 
also had much higher odds of unregistered 
births (OR 3.00, 95%CI 1.78-5.07). Children 
whose mother had private hospital insurance 
at the time of their birth had much lower 
odds of unregistered birth than those 
without insurance (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.11-
0.31). The effect of living in remote and very 
remote areas remained in the fully adjusted 
model. While the effect of areas of lower 
socioeconomic status and alcohol-related 
hospital diagnoses within a year of the birth 
also remained, the size of the effect was small 
(OR ratios less than 1.25) after allowing for 
other measures of disadvantage.
In an unadjusted model, the odds of birth 
registration for children whose mother’s 
own birth registration status was unknown 
were significantly lower than for those 
children whose mothers had registered births 
(unadjusted OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.64-0.76). Those 
children in the ‘unknown’ category tended 
to be older, as their mothers were older; the 
main reason for unknown birth registration 
status was that the mother was born prior to 
1980. In the adjusted model, which included 
the child’s year of birth, the ‘unknown’ and 
‘yes’ categories had similar odds (adjusted OR 
1.04, 95%CI 0.95-1.15).
There was a significant interaction between 
the category of hospital the child was born 
in and year of birth from 2006 to 2010. 
Generally, the odds of unregistered birth 
increased with year of birth, but after 2005 
the odds decreased among children born 
in rural hospitals and, to a lesser extent, in 
tertiary hospitals, while continuing to rise in 
public and private metropolitan hospitals. 
This relationship can be seen in a graph 
of unregistered births by year of birth by 
hospital category in Figure 2.
In the sensitivity analyses, using different 
definitions of Aboriginal status, the same 
patterns were seen. However, the odds 
ratios tended to be closer to unity, the 
p-values were higher and the proportion of 
children with unregistered births was higher 
(18.8% when all children whose MNS record 
listed their mother as non-Aboriginal were 
excluded and 20.2% when all families where 
the mother was recorded as non-Aboriginal 
on at least one child’s record were excluded).
We examined stillbirths separately and found 
that stillborn babies were more likely to have 
their births registered than live-born babies; 
95% of stillborn babies between 1980 and 
2010 had a birth registration.

a: Hospital category and private hospital insurance was categorised as ‘no hospital admission’ for births outside hospital and no maternal admission within a 
week of the birth or a failure to link the Midwives Notification System record to the hospital birth record. 
b: Data on maternal smoking during pregnancy was not comprehensively available until 1998. 
c: Data on private hospital insurance was not recorded until 1999.  
d: Exact cell counts suppressed to confidentialise the data.
e: Mother born prior to 1980 or outside WA.
The birth registration status of children with 
the same mother was moderately correlated, 
with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 
of 0.48.
Discussion
Almost one-in-five children with Aboriginal 
mothers born in Western Australia from 1996 
to 2010 did not have a birth registration 
record by 2012. Unregistered children were 
significantly more likely to have mothers who 
were teenagers when they had their first 
child, who lived in remote and very remote 
areas, who did not have private hospital 
insurance and whose own births were not 
registered. There is evidence that registration 
rates have increased in regional and remote 
areas in recent years.
The high number of unregistered births 
suggests there are significant barriers in the 
registration process for many Aboriginal 
families. An ICC of 0.48 indicates a relatively 
high level of consistency in birth registration 
status among siblings. This, along with our 
finding that children were less likely to have 
registered births if their mother’s birth was 
unregistered, may indicate that these barriers 
persist over time in some families.
Completion of the birth registration process 
relies on the parents recognising its value, 
their level of literacy and the practical means 
of returning a completed registration form to 
the Registry, while coping with the demands 
of caring for a newborn baby. The factors 
most strongly associated with unregistered 
births are indicators of disadvantage and/or 
remoteness. Highly disadvantaged parents 
may not fully access some services that 
require a birth certificate, such as obtaining 
a driver’s licence or passport, and may place 
a lower value on birth registration. Parents 
may also not see the value in registering 
a birth if they are unable to afford the fee 
for a birth certificate at that time. Highly 
disadvantaged parents are also more likely 
to have lower levels of literacy, leading to 
greater difficulty completing an application 
for birth registration and, when necessary, a 
written explanation of why one parent did 
not sign the form. Obtaining assistance from 
Registry staff to complete the form may be 
more difficult in very remote areas. 
We found that adults were much more likely 
to have registered births than children, which 
may be due to people registering their own 
births when they were older, independent

of their mothers and facing difficulties in 
accessing services without a birth certificate. 
The indications of increased birth registration 
from 2006 to 2010 among the 53% of 
children born in rural hospitals may be due 
to the increasing focus on unregistered 
births in recent years. For example, several 
programs are run in remote WA to assist 
Aboriginal people to obtain driver’s licences 
(including the prerequisite birth certificate).8 
Additionally, since 1 July 2007, parents could 
only receive the Baby Bonus (a government 
payment on the birth of a child, which ended 
in 2014), parental leave pay or family tax 
benefits if they stated on their application 
that they had applied for the child’s birth to 
be registered.9,10 
Our finding that unregistered births are 
common for Aboriginal children in WA for 
children from 1 to 15 years agrees with 
studies of birth registrations in Queensland 
and New South Wales, which studied young 
children only.11,12 The Queensland study 
found that 17% of birth records for Aboriginal 
babies born from July 2010 to June 2012 did 
not link to a birth registration record by June 
2014 and births to mothers living in remote 
and very remote areas in Queensland were 
more than twice as likely to be unregistered.11 
The NSW study estimated that 29% of 
Aboriginal children born 2001 to 2005 had 
unregistered births at the end of 2005.12 
A limitation of this study is that the linkage 
of the MNS and birth registration records 
was probabilistic, so it is likely that some 
registered births were incorrectly categorised 
as unregistered, because the MNS record 
failed to link to the birth registration record. 
However, we examined linkage in the 
opposite direction and found that only 56 
birth registration records from 25 April 1996 
to 31 December 2010 with the mother listed 
as Aboriginal did not link to a MNS record, 
compared to 4,628 MNS records which 
did not link to a birth registration record 
during the same time period. This suggests 
that linkage failures between the two data 
sources are rare. Additionally, the studies in 
Queensland and NSW and the work of the 
ABS on delays in birth registration all support 
our finding that unregistered births are not 
uncommon for Aboriginal children.
Another limitation is that we have not 
included children with non-Aboriginal 
mothers and Aboriginal fathers because we 
do not know the identity of the fathers of 
many children, as the birth was not registered 
or the registration did not include details of

the father. For the same reason, we did not 
examine associations between the fathers 
and birth registration. We also could not 
investigate associations with delays in birth 
registration, as we did not have the date of 
birth registration. Another limitation was 
possible measurement error for some factors 
of interest. The strengths of this study include 
that it was population-based and had 30 
years of births available to examine trends 
over time. Additionally, by using family 
relationships, we were able to include a wide 
range of information about the mother and to 
allow for correlations within families. 
Several international conventions to which 
Australia is a signatory stipulate that all 
children have the right to be registered 
immediately after birth.13 However, it is 
increasingly clear that an unacceptably high 
number of Aboriginal children do not obtain 
this right.
Difficulties proving identity can lead 
to serious and wide-ranging social and 
economic impacts. These include barriers 
to securing employment, obtaining a tax 
file number and even joining organised 
sports activities if a child cannot prove their 
age. Lack of a birth certificate has also been 
linked to unlicensed driving and subsequent 
incarceration in WA.8
In its current form, the birth registration 
system does not adequately help the most 
disadvantaged become registered, so 
changes are necessary in order to increase 
Aboriginal birth registration rates. In the 
short term, as almost all births take place in 
hospital in WA, assistance completing the 
birth registration form before the mother 
and child leave the hospital may increase 
registration, in addition to expanded catch-up 
registration programs. This assistance could 
be particularly targeted towards providing 
additional support to mothers who are 
teenagers, which may in turn increase the 
prospects of registration for their subsequent 
births. 
In the longer term, more fundamental 
changes to the current birth registration

system may be required in order to increase 
the birth registration rates of children of 
Aboriginal mothers towards that of the non-
Aboriginal population in Western Australia. 
Some states and territories (e.g. Northern 
Territory) have much lower rates of delayed 
birth registration than Western Australia, 
suggesting their systems have fewer barriers 
to birth registration. 
Western Australia’s data linkage system 
routinely links birth registrations and the 
Midwives Notification System, providing 
a simple mechanism for tracking progress 
towards the goal of universal birth 
registration for Aboriginal children.
