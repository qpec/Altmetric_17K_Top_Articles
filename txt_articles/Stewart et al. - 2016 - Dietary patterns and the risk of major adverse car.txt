Objectives
To determine whether dietary pattern assessed by a simple self-administered food frequency questionnaire is asso-
ciated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in high-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease.
Background
A Mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with lower cardiovascular (CV) mortality. It is less certain
whether foods common in western diets are associated with CV risk.
Methods
At baseline, 15 482 (97.8%) patients (mean age 67+ 9 years) with stable coronary heart disease from 39 countries who
participated in the Stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaque by initiation of darapladib therapy (STABILITY) trial com-
pleted a life style questionnaire which included questions on common foods. A Mediterranean diet score (MDS)
was calculated for increasing consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, and alcohol, and for less
meat, and a ‘Western diet score’ (WDS) for increasing consumption of refined grains, sweets and deserts, sugared
drinks, and deep fried foods. A multi-variable Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations between
MDS or WDS and MACE, defined as CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke.
Results
After a median follow-up of 3.7 years MACE occurred in 7.3% of 2885 subjects with an MDS ≥15, 10.5% of 4018 sub-
jects with an MDS of 13–14, and 10.8% of 8579 subjects with an MDS ≤12. A one unit increase in MDS .12 was
associated with lower MACE after adjusting for all covariates (+1 category HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.98, P ¼ 0.002).
There was no association between WDS (adjusted model +1 category HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97, 1.01) and MACE.
Conclusion
Greater consumption of healthy foods may be more important for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease
than avoidance of less healthy foods typical of Western diets.

 Introduction
A Mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with reduced
cardiovascular (CV) and total mortality in large epidemiological
studies,1,2 and in two prevention trials, CV events were lower in
subjects randomized to a Mediterranean dietary intervention
compared with control subjects following a low-fat diet.3,4 The trad-
itional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high proportion of
healthy foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains,
fish, moderate alcohol, and little meat. Clinical practice guidelines
from the European Society of Cardiology5 and the American Heart
Association6 recommend frequent consumption of fruit, vegetables,
fish, and other whole foods. In addition to encouraging healthy
foods, these guidelines recommend restricting sodium, sugar,
saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates, which are often included
in processed foods, and are more typical of a Western dietary
pattern.
Although a healthy diet is thought to be important for secondary
prevention, few large international studies have evaluated the rela-
tionship between dietary pattern and outcomes in patients with
stable coronary heart disease (CHD),7 and diet is often not assessed
as part of routine clinical care. The Euroheart survey,8 evaluated
achievement of a broad range of secondary prevention goals in
many European countries, but did not report on diet. A simple
standard way to assess the overall dietary pattern would be clinically
useful if it predicted CV events and mortality. The aim of this study
was to determine whether either a ‘Mediterranean’ or ‘western’
dietary pattern, assessed using a simple self-administered food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ), predicts adverse outcomes in a
global population of high-risk patients with stable CHD who parti-
cipated in the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque by initiation of
darapladib therapy (STABILITY) trial.9,10
Methods
Study population
The STABILITY trial (www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00799903) was a glo-
bal outcomes trial designed to determine whether Darapladib, a specific
inhibitor of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) reduced
the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as CV
death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke in patients
with CHD.9 15 828 subjects from 39 countries with stable CHD, de-
fined as prior myocardial infarction, prior coronary revascularization,
or multi-vessel CHD, were randomized into the study. Patients also
had to meet at least one of the following CV risk enrichment criteria:
age ≥60 years, diabetes mellitus requiring pharmacotherapy,
HDL-cholesterol ,1.03 mmol/L, current or previous smoker defined
as ≥5 cigarettes per day on average, significant renal dysfunction de-
fined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 and ,60 mL/min
per 1.73 m2 or urine albumin: creatinine ratio ≥30 mg albumin/g cre-
atinine, or polyvascular disease defined as CHD and cerebrovascular
disease or CHD and peripheral arterial disease. There was no difference
in MACE for subjects randomized to Darapladib compared with
placebo.10
Diet questionnaire
At baseline, 15 482 (97.8%) participants completed a self-reported life-
style questionnaire which included questions related to diet after giving
written informed consent. Participants were asked how many times
during a typical week they consume servings of the following food
groups: meat (red meats and poultry), fish (fresh-water and ocean
fish, including dried and canned fish), dairy food (milk, yogurt, cheese,
etc.), whole meal foods (whole wheat flour, brown rice, corn, oats,
etc.), refined grain foods (white flour, white rice, pasta, noodles, etc.),
legumes (beans, lentils, peas, etc.), vegetables excluding potatoes, fruits
(fresh or dried), tofu/soybean curd (textured vegetable protein, soya
milk, etc.), eggs, dessert/sweet snacks (cake, cookie, pie, chocolates,
etc.), sugar sweetened drinks (excluding artificial sweeteners), and
deep fried food (e.g. French fries, potato chips, samosas, egg rolls,
etc.). For each food group, the five possible responses or categories
were: ‘never or rarely (,1/week)’, ‘about 1 serving each week’, ‘several
servings each week’, ‘1–2 servings each day’, and ‘3 or more servings
each day’ (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). In addition,
each subject indicated the number of standard servings of white wine,
red wine, beer, spirits, or fortified wines consumed during a typical
week and how often they consume six or more standard drinks on
one occasion (see Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Derivation of diet scores
Selection of food groups and scoring for the Mediterranean diet score
(MDS) and the Western diet score (WDS) were pre-specified in the
statistical analysis plan. The MDS was based on foods in MDS reported
in previous studies.11 The MDS was calculated by assigning points for
increased consumption (0 lowest to 4 highest frequency) of whole
grains, vegetables, legumes, fruits and fish, and for less consumption of
meat (0 highest to 4 lowest). For alcohol consumption, points were al-
located for none (0 points), some (women ≤7 drinks/week, men ≤14
drinks/week [2 points]), moderate (women .7 drinks/week, men .14
drinks/week [4 points]), and potentially hazardous, .6 drinks at one
time at least once/week (0 points). Dairy food and eggs were not in-
cluded in MDS because there is limited evidence from previous studies
that consumption of these is associated with the risk of major CV
events.12,13 The WDS was calculated by assigning points for increased
consumption of the following food groups: refined grains, sweets and
deserts, sugared drinks, and deep fried foods (0 lowest to 4 highest fre-
quency). Dietary fats were not included in either score because these
were not reliably assessed from the FFQ.
A simple MDS was also evaluated in a post hoc analysis. This score was
based on four food categories from the MDS associated with a lower
risk of CV disease in previous studies, with points chosen based on
clinical utility. The simple MDS assigned one point for daily consumption
of fruit, one point for daily vegetables (1–2 serves/day), two points for
greater consumption of each (3 or more serves), one point for light, two
points for moderate alcohol consumption (see Supplementary material
online, Table S2), one point for fish once/week, and two points for fish
more than once/week.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the first occurrence of MACE defined as
non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from a CV
cause during a median follow-up of 3.7 (inter-quartile range 3.5–3.8)
years. Additional outcomes were fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarc-
tion, fatal or non-fatal stroke, and CV death or all-cause death.9,10
Statistical analysis
Subjects responding to ,6 of the 8 MDS questions were excluded from
the MDS analysis (n ¼ 256, 1.6%), and those who responded to fewer
than 3 of 4 WDS questions were excluded from the WDS analysis
(n ¼ 337, 2.1%). For subjects with fewer missing values (for MDS

 4.5% and WDS 1.7%), the median response for the population was as-
signed for each missing response. Characteristics of patients at baseline
were reported by approximate quartile of WDS and MDS. Because
there was no association between MDS and outcomes for MDS
score ≤ the median, the two lowest quartiles of MDS were combined
to simplify presentation. Continuous variables are described as the
mean (standard deviation) and discrete factors are reported as percen-
tages. Food categories where the percentages in the group were ,2%
were collapsed into a combined group. Evidence of a trend in baseline
factors by each diet score was quantified with P-values using the
Kruskal–Wallis test or the Spearman correlation test.
Kaplan–Meier estimates of event rates calculated over the follow-up
period are reported for the MDS and WDS scores for pre-specified
outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate
the associations between pre-specified outcomes and each diet score
and food item. Diet scores (per 1 unit increment) and food item
consumption frequencies (per 1 category increase) were modelled as
continuous variables in the following models: Model 1 adjusted for treat-
ment group only (darapladib or placebo); Model 2 adjusted for model 1
and age, sex, smoking, and markers of disease severity (prior myocardial
infarction, prior coronary revascularization, multi-vessel disease
confirmed by angiography, polyvascular disease, and eGFR ,60 ml/
min/m2); Model 3 adjusted for variables in Model 2 and CV risk factors
(history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HDL-cholesterol (mmol/L)
and LDL cholesterol (mmol/L), body mass index (kg/m2), and total self-
reported mild (2 METS), moderate (4 METS), or vigorous (8 METS)
physical activity in MET.hours/week14; Model 4 adjusted for variables
in Model 3 and geographic region USA and Canada, Western Europe
(adding Australia and New Zealand), Eastern Europe, South America
and Mexico, and Asia (adding South Africa), World Bank Country
income level, lower, middle, or high,15 and education (years of formal
education completed ‘none or 1–8 years’, ‘9–12 years’ ‘trade school’,
or ‘college/ university’). The final model for MDS adjusted for WDS,
and the final model for WDS adjusted for MDS.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested. For the propor-
tional hazard assumption, an additional term assessing the factor and
log of time to event was included in the model. The assumption of
linearity was tested for all continuous and ordinal terms. The restricted
cubic spline model’s likelihood ratio x2 statistic was compared with the
model including a linear term exclusively. The relationship was com-
pared visually assessing the slope of the log hazard plot vs. the baseline
factor. Non-linear relationships were modelled using appropriate trans-
formations such as a log transformation or linear spline. Hazard ratios
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) from these models
are reported. Statistical significance was assessed using two-sided
P-values. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 or higher.
Results
Description of study population by diet
scores
The clinical and demographic characteristics of subjects are re-
ported for the 15 482 (97.8%) study participants and by MDS group
in Table 1. Subjects with higher MDS were less likely to be current
smokers, took slightly more physical activity, had lower body mass
index, and lower white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and
fasting blood glucose levels. Differences in HDL and LDL choles-
terol and hypertension were small. There were small differences
in history of stroke, multi-vessel coronary artery disease,
polyvascular disease, and renal dysfunction by MDS. There were
geographic differences, with higher MDS more common in Asia/Pa-
cific and Northern Europe compared with Mediterranean countries.
MDS were lower in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and North
America. (Figure 1).
Clinical and demographic characteristics are reported by WDS
see Supplementary material online, Table S3. There were no clinic-
ally significant associations between WDS and body mass index,
hypertension, HDL or LDL cholesterol, white blood cell count, or
C-reactive protein. There was a modest association between ‘more
healthy’ WDS and higher fasting glucose, and diabetes (P , 0.0001
for all). The WDS was higher, or ‘less healthy’ in North American
and lower, or ‘more healthy’ in Western Europe and Asia. The cor-
relation between WDS and MDS was weak (Spearman correlation
coefficient ¼ 0.044).
Diet scores and outcomes
MACE occurred in 1588 (10.1%) study participants, which included
623 (4%) CV deaths, 698 (4.4%) non-fatal myocardial infarctions,
and 267 (1.7%) non-fatal strokes. 1159 (7.3%) patients died from
all causes.
There was no association between increase in WDS and MACE
in unadjusted or adjusted models (Table 2). There was however an
association between MDS and MACE, but this was non-linear (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1). For MDS ≤12 (n ¼ 8579,
56% of subjects), there was no significant association between
increase in MDS and MACE. For MDS scores .12, a one unit
increase in MDS was associated with a lower risk of MACE (HR
for +1 increase in MDS 0.93, 95% CI 0.90, 0.96, P , 0.0001), and
this association remained after stepwise adjustment for covariates
(Table 2). The associations between increase in MDS .12 and a
lower risk of CV death, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal
or non-fatal stroke, and all-cause death were similar but with wider
CIs because of the smaller number of events (Table 2). The associ-
ation between MDS .12 and risk of MACE was consistent across all
geographic regions and country income levels, for subjects with
more and less education, and by age, smoking, HDL-cholesterol, re-
nal function, and polyvascular disease categories (see Supplemen-
tary material online, Figure S2). There was no significant
interaction between MDS, WDS, and MACE or any of the second-
ary outcomes.
Kaplan–Meier plots for the primary outcome are displayed by
MDS group in Figure 2. Major adverse cardiovascular events oc-
curred in 7.3% of 2885 subjects with an MDS ≥15, 10.5% of 4018
subjects with an MDS of 13–14 and 10.8% of 8579 subjects with
an MDS ≤12. CV death, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal
or non-fatal stroke, and all-cause death were also lower for partici-
pants with an MDS ≥15 compared with those reporting a lower
MDS (Figure 3). Event rates for MACE were similar for all quartiles
of WDS.
The simple MDS based on daily consumption of fruit and
vegetables, and weekly consumption of alcohol and fish was also
associated with a lower risk of MACE. The HR for each one point
increase in the simple MDS adjusted for treatment only was 0.90,
95% CI 0.87–0.94, P ¼ 0.0001; and in the fully adjusted model
was 0.94, 95% CI 0.90–0.98, P ¼ 0.002.

 Foods associated with a decreased risk of MACE in the analysis
adjusted for treatment only were fruits, vegetables, fish, alcohol,
dairy food, and tofu/soybean. Consumption of legumes, whole
grains, sweetened drinks, refined grains, desserts, sweet snacks,
and meat were not associated with the risk of MACE. In fully
adjusted models, fish and tofu/soybean were the only food groups
significantly associated with lower MACE (see Supplementary ma-
terial online, Table S4).
Discussion
In this global study of patients with established CHD greater adher-
ence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with a lower
risk of CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause death.
The MDS was based on foods from the traditional Mediterranean
diet, but a high score is also consistent with the Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet,16 and consumption of healthy

Dietary patterns and cardiovascular events

 foods recommended in dietary guidelines.5,6,17 A high MDS was
observed in diverse geographic locations with different dietary
patterns, suggesting that it is broadly applicable. In contrast, con-
sumption of ‘less healthy’ foods including sugared drinks, refined
carbohydrates, fried foods, and sweetened foods or deserts, which
are common in western diets and likely to contribute to obesity, was
not associated with the risk of major CV events. A lower risk of
MACE was only observed for the �18% of subjects with a MDS
≥15, suggesting the majority of patients with stable CHD globally
could benefit from increasing consumption of healthy foods.
The association between a healthy diet which includes foods from
a ‘Mediterranean dietary pattern’ and lower risk of all-cause death
and CV events has also been reported in several large general
population cohorts.1,2,18 Reduction in CV events was observed
for individuals who reported a high consumption of fruit and vege-
tables in the EPIC trial.19 In a general population study from Sweden
myocardial infarction was less likely for the highest population
quartile of a recommended food score, which was based on con-
sumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, reduced fat dairy foods,
whole grains and fish assessed by FFQ.18 As in the current study, a
‘non-recommended food score’ was not associated with risk of
myocardial infarction.18 In the INTERHEART study, a global case–
control study of potentially modifiable risk factors for myocardial
infarction, the three dietary factors associated with lower risk
were fruit, vegetables and alcohol assessed using a similar FFQ.20
In an analysis of dietary patterns in the INTERHEART study, a pru-
dent diet which was high in fruit and vegetables, was most clearly as-
sociated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction, while a western
dietary pattern had a weaker ‘U shaped’ association with risk.21 In an
analysis from the global ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trial a ‘prudent
diet’, which included a high consumption of fruit and vegetables was
also associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes.7 In the global
burden of disease studies, the lack of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
seafoods or omega three rich foods, and nuts and seeds were asso-
ciated with a greater burden of disease, while high sodium intake
was the only unhealthy component of diet associated with increased
disability.22 The observation that a simple MDS based on self-
reported daily fruits and vegetables, and weekly consumption of
fish and alcohol predicted mortality and MACE in this study is there-
fore consistent with these and other smaller studies.23,24
Study strengths and limitations
A limitation of observational studies, including the current study, is
the possibility that unmeasured factors explain associations. In this
study, there were differences in several baseline characteristics by
MDS. While MDS was an independent predictor of MACE after
stepwise adjustment for multiples covariates, and associations
were consistent across pre-specified subgroups, residual confound-
ing remains possible. A causal association is supported by two
randomized clinical trials which reported favourable outcomes
with a Mediterranean dietary intervention.3,4 However, further
large dietary intervention trials with long-term follow-up are
needed to provide conclusive evidence that a Mediterranean dietary
pattern lowers CV risk.
The simple FFQ used in this study gives a less accurate assessment
of diet compared with more comprehensive FFQs and detailed food
diaries.25,26 This limitation would underestimate the strength of any
association between diet and outcomes. Food frequency question-
naires used in large epidemiology studies of diet and health typically
include .150 food items,27,28 and are not easily applied across
diverse populations. In clinical practice, diet is often not evaluated
in patients with CHD, in part because of the lack of simple easily
applied tools. In this study, the FFQ could be completed in a few
minutes by study participants who came from diverse cultures
and had widely varied dietary patterns. The demonstration that a
healthy dietary pattern evaluated using a short, easy to use, self-
administered FFQ predicts MACE and all-cause mortality suggests
that this approach could be used to improve dietary assessment
and advice for secondary prevention of CHD as part of usual care.
The simple FFQ was not suitable for assessing total energy
intake,29 an important determinant of obesity. The simple FFQ
was also not suitable for assessing individual foods. For example,
this study did not assess olive oil, which is thought to be a key pro-
tective factor in the Mediterranean diet30 or processed meats which
have been associated with increased mortality in previous epidemio-
logical studies.31 Evidence for an association between dietary fat and
major CV events has been controversial.32 In this study, there was
no association between adverse outcomes and consumption of
meat, dairy, or deep fried foods, which on average contain more
fat, but the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat intake could

 not be reliably assessed. A formal validation of our FFQ was not
performed, but it was similar to that used in the INTERHEART21
and On-TARGET trials.7 In most previous studies, diet scores
are based on consumption of foods relative to others in the study
population (e.g. . median),2,7,11,21 but in this study points were
assigned for frequency of consumption of each food group. This

 scoring is easy to administer and interpret, and can be applied with-
out modification across diverse populations with different dietary
patterns.
Mediterranean and western dietary patterns are both part of the
overall dietary pattern, and therefore may not be independent.
However, in this study, the correlation between MDS and WDS
was low, associations between MDS and outcomes were similar
after adjusting for WDS, and statistical tests for interaction were
not significant. The mechanisms for health benefits from a Mediter-
ranean diet pattern cannot be determined from the current study.
Adjustment for conventional CV risk factors had only a minor influ-
ence on risk estimates, and there was no clinically significant associ-
ation between MDS and hypertension, LDL or HDL-cholesterol. At
baseline, �97% of study participants were taking a statin and the
majority were on anti-hypertensive medication.33 The use of pre-
ventive medications may decrease the ability to detect modest ef-
fects of diet, if present, on these risk factors.
Conclusion
In a large geographically diverse cohort of high-risk patients with
stable CHD, a diet containing more food groups included in the
traditional Mediterranean diet, assessed using a simple self-
administered FFQ, was associated with a lower risk of MACE and
all-cause death. In contrast, greater consumption of foods thought
to be less healthy and typical of Western diets was not associated
with adverse CV events. These observations suggest dietary guide-
lines for secondary prevention of CHD should focus more on
encouraging greater consumption of ‘healthy’ foods.
