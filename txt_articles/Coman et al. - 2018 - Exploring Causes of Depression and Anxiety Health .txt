Abstract: Poor comparability of social groups is one of the major methodological problems that
threatens the validity of health disparities (HD) research findings. We illustrate a methodological
solution that can additionally unpack the mechanisms behind differential effects on depression and
anxiety. We describe racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of depression and anxiety scores
between Black and White women using classic methods, and then we illustrate a 1:1 matching
procedure that allows for building of individual-level difference scores, i.e., actual HD difference
score variables, for each pair of comparable participants. We compare the prevalence of depression
disorder between Black and White young women after matching them 1:1 on common socio-economic
characteristics (age, employment, education, and marital status). In essence, we follow matching
or stratification methods, but make a step further and match cases 1:1 on propensity scores, i.e., we
create Black–White ‘dyads’. Instead of concluding from plain comparisons that 11% more White
young women (18–30 years old) report a depressive disorder than Black young women, the matched
data confirms the trend, but provides more nuances. In 27% of the pairs of comparable pairs the
White woman was depressed (and the comparable Black woman was not), while in 15% of the
pairs the Black woman was depressed (and the comparable White woman was not). We find that
Black-to-White disparities in neighborhood disorder do not predict depression differences (HDs),
while such an effect is evident for anxiety HDs. The 1:1 matching approach allows us to examine
more complex HD effects, like differential mediational or resilience mechanisms that appear to be
protective of Black women’s mental health.

1. Introduction
Understanding the underlying causes of health disparities (HD) is a major research objective in
the US and abroad, because it promises to uncover efficient solutions for health equity [1,2]. Finding
the evidence for actual causes of HDs can provide researchers, healthcare providers, and policy makers
with insights for policy and actions [3] that can reduce and even eliminate health inequities.
HDs are differences in health outcomes between groups that are avoidable; this implies that if
one knows what causes them, one can avoid, or at least reduce them. When such disparities in health
are not reduced even when causal mechanisms are understood, HDs qualify as inequities, and hence
they are unfair [4]. To decide fairness and equity however, policy makers try to infer what would

happen to members of a disadvantaged racial/ethnic group, had they been members of the privileged
group; such imaginary exercises however have to assume that members of different R/E groups are
‘exchangeable’, or that one can infer what could have happened to a person from one group had
they switched roles with an ‘identical’ person from another group. We provide a method that puts in
practice this imaginary ‘what if’ (or counter-factual (CF) [5]) exercise that increases comparability and
potentially reduces confounding [6], by directly matching 1:1 participants on all background factors,
then re-assessing the range of differences in health outcomes.
Health disparities have been documented in mental health outcomes in general in the US, and in
depression in particular. Research shows that fewer Blacks in the US report depression than Whites [7]
or Hispanics/Latino/a [8]. Blacks in the US on the other hand may show higher rates of anxiety
than Whites, although such differences are thought to be partially confounded by sociodemographic
indicators [9]. It is possible that Blacks may differentially experience stronger depressive symptoms as
responses to stimuli like physical symptoms of illness [10], but may cope better with other stressful
events, because they are accustomed to adversity because of belonging to a minority [11,12]. Even if
less prevalent in Blacks, metal health symptoms may have stronger health consequences in Blacks than
other racial/ethnic (R/E) groups [13].
The environment clearly affects health [14,15], and it may contribute differentially to health
outcomes, hence increasing inequalities [16].
Neighborhood conditions represent opportunity
structures [17], and hence can become a form of environmental stress or social adversity [18], which has
also been conceptualized as a form of toxic stress [19] or life adversity [11,12]. Neighborhood conditions
have long-lasting social consequences [20], primarily by determining intermediate outcomes, like
educational attainment [21,22]. These effects can accumulate over the life course [23] and can lead
to disparate health effects like ‘accelerated aging’ [24]. We explore a method that can gauge how
disparities in neighborhood conditions may potentially affect disparities in mental health, depression
primarily, and anxiety secondarily.
Modern HD research takes on the task of examining causes of existing HDs by comparing
population estimates of health outcomes of interest between racial/ethnic (R/E) groups, or other
populations, first as they are, and then while controlling for relevant covariates. While such group
differences represent a first approximation of disparities, HD researchers ultimately aim to identify
their causes and hence recommend corrective courses of action. One method promising to provide
causal conclusion is the well-known potential outcomes (PO) approach to understand HDs [25], which
compares alternative POs for the same person, under different conditions.
In HD research we ask whether the same person would experience a better/worse outcome,
had s/he changed her/his race/ethnicity, while everything else is kept equal, i.e., ceteris paribus.
For example, in a recent court case the parties made such counterfactual (CF) assertions, that Asian
Americans would have a better chance of being admitted to an elite university, had they been White, or
Black, or Hispanic [26]. Such mental exercises can be justifiably envisioned for CF ‘gender switching’,
because gender is assigned randomly at birth [27]. Race/ethnicity however is not assigned randomly,
so a mere difference between average scores cannot be seen as a measure of a (causal) health disparities
effect. If people of different races/ethnicities (R/E) were truly ‘exchangeable’ (i.e., similar, see [28] p.
159), then the mere difference between group means in an outcome Y, YB − YW, could be deemed a
‘causal effect’ of being Black (vs. White, e.g.,), but such exchangeability is not realistic. Researchers
hence need additional tools to gauge ‘true’ (i.e., causal) HD effects, because the ‘everything else
being equal’ assumption requires some form of ‘controlling’ for, or stratifying on several factors.
One common way to control for pre-existing differences is to compare the focal outcome between
subgroups that have the same levels of covariates (are balanced on them), [29], by matching for instance
individuals from both groups on education and employment, and then comparing several sub-groups
that were made similar by statistical means (see [30] or [31] for illustrations using propensity matching).
The statistical controlling option known nowadays as ‘propensity matching’ was suggested long
ago by Cochran [32], exactly as a 1:1 match initially, done in ‘the hope of securing a more accurate
 Brain Sci. 2018, 8, 207

comparison’ (p. 256). We propose that such a 1:1 matching can additionally unravel causal mechanisms
responsible for health disparities. If one matches 1:1 say Black and White participants, on relevant
demographics and known socio-economic indicators, then an individual HD (difference) score on an
outcome Y can be created for each matched pair i, like HDi = YiB − YiW, and then this new variable
can be analyzed in terms of co-variability with other such difference scores. The estimate of the health
disparity in an outcome Y will then become the average of such varying differences, HDi, instead of the
more limited differences between averages YB − YW, as it is commonly done. We show how to create such
‘exchangeable’ pairs by matching 1:1 as close as possible, on a number of background factors, after
reviewing relevant health disparities literature.
2. Conceptual Models for Health Disparities
Social disadvantage or low social class are known as ‘social sources’ of HDs [33]. In fact HDs
are seen as differences in health resulting from social forces, not due to unavoidable biological
differences [34]. Social determinants of health like neighborhood poverty, relative income inequality,
poor housing, and segregation can become ‘place-based drivers’ of disparities in health [34]. In essence
societies ‘act’ by sorting individuals in resource-rich and resource-poor neighborhoods, and then
individuals themselves make choices (to the extent they have such choices) to stay in, or move between,
different places [35], which can shape their life-course trajectories and health.
We propose that what is missing from analytical modeling of HDs is the direct specification of HDs
as a distinct outcome (or ‘dependent variable’) in models, either logic, conceptual or theoretical, which
can then be turned into a variable at the analysis stage. Many HD writings point to presumed causal
mechanisms behind HDs. Health inequities are seen to arise from “social, economic, environmental,
and structural disparities that contribute to intergroup differences in health outcomes” ([35], p. 99).
A HD simplified causal model is shown in Figure 1, which crystalizes an array of HD theoretical
models, and promises to reveal causal forces leading to HDs. The relative contribution of these factors
is important; research for example has pointed to one’s zip code as being more important to one’s
health than one’s genetic code [36].

University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) community-based family planning clinics; we use the 
baseline data for analyses: nWhite = 92, nBlack = 145. These clinics serve primarily low-income women 
with average annual income below $6000. Inclusion criteria were: being (1) female, (2) not currently 
pregnant, (3) aged 18 and over, (4) non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic, (5) able to 
speak English or Spanish, and 6) able to consent; all participants provided informed consent. This

3.2. Measures
Depression was measured as using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(CIDI)—World Health Organization version [40]. Assessment of mental health disorders followed
the definitions and criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition
(DSM-IV) [41]. Anxiety was measured using five items from Carver’s BIS scale [42] to explain a
behavioral avoidance (or inhibition) system (BIS) which is said to regulate aversive motives, in which
the goal is to move away from something unpleasant. Responses to BIS items are obtained on a 4 point
scale ranging from 1 ‘very true for me’ to 4 ‘very false to me’. Five BIS items loaded on a distinct BIS
factor according to a principle factor analysis with oblique rotation; their internal reliability Cronbach’s
alpha was 0.696.
Neighborhood disorder was measured using ten items [43] assessing how residents perceived
problems related to safety and signs of physical neglect in their neighborhood (e.g., poor sidewalks and
broken curbs, vandalism). Responses to each question were z scored and averaged across questions to
create individual-level summary measures of perceived neighborhood social cohesion and disorder
(Cronbach’s alpha was 0.83) [38,43].
Covariates used were: age (continuous, range 18–30), marital status (married, co-habitating, not
married with boyfriend, not married without boyfriend), education (less than-, with-, or more than
high school), and employment (unemployed, homemaker, part-time, fulltime).
3.3. Analytical Methods
We follow the logic behind the popular ‘matching’ methods, known also as principal stratification,
which combines matching factors into a global score, built as a continuous probability (or ‘propensity’)
to belong to one group of interest, in our case Black women, versus the reference group, here White
women. This is simply done by regressing the binary grouping (Black vs. White, or ‘treated’ vs.
controls [44] more generally) on the variables that can predict belonging to the group of interest
(vs. reference), and saving the predicted probabilities from the logistic model (note that, if race
was randomized, no variable could predict belonging to one or another race). Practically then, one
generates a probability score, of belonging to the group of interest, Black women (vs. the comparison
group, i.e., White women), using all relevant factors as predictors in a simple logistic regression. It
is known however that such matching is never perfect, minorities usually having fewer cases with
higher education, or better employment, for example, than White participants.
Since its inception [32,45], the ‘propensity’ matching method has expanded tremendously, less
so however in its 1:1 original matching form, and more so in the matching into comparable strata (or
clusters). We propose here a natural HD extension of this methods, which results in a ‘matched pairs’
data structure ([46], chapter 9) that allows for additional testing options.
The common matching approach can be seen as a way of ordering the data on all matching
factors, and then pairing up strata in a group (Blacks, or the ‘treated’) to comparable strata in the
reference group (Whites, or the ‘controls’). In HD research, when health differences between certain
populations are hypothesized, one can simply sort (or stratify) the data ascendingly (or alphabetically,
for text categorical variables) by all relevant factors, for example by age and education, and then
within each sub-group g with similar ages and education, compare the two populations (White
and Black women, in our case), which will yield g such health disparity quantities HDg = YgB −
YgW. These group estimates can then be averaged out to yield a global HD score. If one uses for
illustration three age and three education categories, total g is 3 × 3 = 9, as shown in Table 1. Within
5 of these same-age-and-education sub-groups, more White women were depressed, whereas in
4 such subgroups, more Black women were depressed, which are nuances that are lost when one

simply reports an overall average White-Black difference, as the (weighted) average of 11% difference
would tell.

Notes: For this age × education matching example the test of depression prevalence difference yields χ2(8) = 15.351,
p = 0.053; this 3 × 3 example was purposefully built to allow readers to compare to and expand into a formal
structural causal modeling (SCM [47]) analysis, as done by Kaufman & Kaufman (see their example in Appendix 2,
Table A2.1 [48]).
We basically propose to extend this logic to compare 1:1 individual White and Black women
in similar ‘groups’, technically dyads, made up of one participant from each group, which will
yield a more detailed HD picture. Guided by the conceptual model in Figure 1, our approach is
to directly compare truly comparable individuals, after matching them 1:1 on background factors,
like socio-economic status. We do so by aligning disadvantaged (minority) and reference (majority)
participants with nearly identical ‘propensity’ scores. This simple step allows one to literally build
HD scores for each ‘dyad’ of comparable cases, and then describe and analyze the variability of these
‘dyadic’ HD scores, hence directly evaluating the causes of health disparities in depression (or anxiety).
First, we select the matching variables, the potential confounders that can be associated with
both the racial/ethnic grouping and the study outcomes (depression and anxiety). These were 4
demographic and social factors: age, education, employment and marital status (income had missing
values for more than half of the sample, so was not useful). Second, we created propensity scores,
i.e., probabilities of ‘being a Black woman’ (vs. White) from a logistic regression of the Black/White
binary ‘outcome’ on four predictors: age, education, employment, and marital status (logit Stata [49]
command, with three predictors being categorical). Third, the saved probability values were used to
match 1:1 white and Black women (data is shown in the online appendix bit.ly/1to1depression): 61
pairs were matched 1:1. One can then compare Black and White women on any outcome, within either
the unmatched (145B vs. 92W) or the matched sub-samples (61B vs 61W).
Because of the 1:1 matching into comparable ‘dyads’, akin to twins (or parent-child, or spousal
dyadic designs), the data can now be re-shaped or re-organized such that any outcome (like depression
and anxiety) or predictor (like neighborhood disorder) become ‘repeated’ variables, one each for
the White and for their matched Black counterparts, hence the number of ‘cases’ now is as many as
the matched dyads, n = 61. This ‘double’ data resembles in many ways a ‘pre’ and ‘post’ repeated
measures design, where ‘pre’ is simply the reference group, here chosen to be the White women.
This simple implementation led us to investigate actual ‘change’ scores, which in our dyadic setup
represent ‘difference scores’. Obviously, such difference scores can be computed by hand in the raw
data after matching, for any Black/White pair, so one can then investigate the reasons for such varying
differences, across the 61 dyads, or to what extent larger such differences are predicted by (for example)
differences in neighborhood conditions, like neighborhood disorder. This moreover opens up the
option of building health disparities scores as latent difference scores (LDS [50,51]). One can therefore
 Brain Sci. 2018, 8, 207
6 of 13
directly investigate the sources of the variability in the HD scores, and more importantly explore
causes of HDs in models of increasing complexity.
Notably also, to test for the statistical significance of the differences between the White and Black
matched cases, one can now use ‘paired’ tests, like the paired McNemar chi-squared test for binary
outcomes, instead of independent samples test, like the plain chi-squared test, as one would, with the
original ‘mixed’ (un-matched) cases.
4. Results
We report the proportions, means, standard errors, and p values for Black/White differences for
the key outcomes and descriptives, in Table 2, for the initial sample of women. The initial racial/ethnic
(R/E) groups differed significantly in marital status, with more white women in the unmarried and
cohabitating categories, and more Black women in the not married or living with a boyfriend categories.
Black women live in neighborhoods with more problems, yet they seem to experience less anxiety and
depression, which has been called the Black–White paradox [52,53].

The matching process worked well, indicated for instance by the fact that marital status, which,
as shown in Table 2, differed initially significantly between Black and White women, became now
similarly distributed in the two groups of the matched women (χ2(3) = 0.406, p = 0.939; the un-matched
sub-groups remained different on marital status).
The overall results in terms of depression HDs are summarized in Table 3, where the estimated
percentages of women reporting depression and the White–Black differences are shown: the 11% initial
estimate, and the 12% revealed after 1:1 matching.

The 1:1 matching turns the testing of HDs in depression (as a binary outcome) from an
independent samples test one into a paired samples test, i.e., from a chi-squared test of independence
between White and Black women into a McNemar’s chi-squared test, which in essence weighs the
number of two types of ‘opposite’ pairs (the diagonal cells in Table 4). The McNemar test is comparing
the number of pairs in which a Black woman was depressed and the comparable (matched) White
woman was not (a difference score of 1B − 0W = 1, with 0 being non-depressed, and 1 depressed) to
the number of pairs with the opposite pattern, i.e., scores for which 0B − 1W = −1. The McNemar’s
chi-squared test ignores equality scores, i.e., those for which no difference is evident (whether both
are 0B & 0W or both are 1B & 1W, see Table 4). We had 9 cases with 1B-0W, 18 with 0B-1W and 34 with
Black-White equalities in terms of depression (either both 0’s, or both 1’s), which the McNemar test
sees as not a decisive directional difference between the patterns of paired scores (p = 0.161).

Notes: McNemar’s paired test of differences: χ2 (1) = 1.960, p = 0.161 (if one ignores here the dependence/pairing,
the expected counts would be 32, 8, 15, 4, and χ2 (1) = 2.111, p = 0.550); A average percentages of depressed
women in each White and Black group; T indicates percentages are of the total sample N; ‡ shows pairs similar in
depression status.
One can read Table 4 as saying that of the 40 non-depressed White women, most (31, or 78%) have
a Black counterpart with the same outcome, and some are instead depressed (9, or 23%). Of the 19
depressed White women however, most (16, or 84%) have a Black ‘pair’ who is not depressed, and
only few (3, or 25%) have the same outcome as them. Overall, 58% of all pairs are ‘concordant’ (53%
+ 5%), and the 27% plus 15% are discordant, with different depression outcomes: the relative size of
these two discordant subgroups decides whether we have significant disparities or not.
The pairing of data allows one to literally read the ‘what if’ as a ‘change’ in outcome with a
‘change’ in one’s race/ethnicity: if a White woman could become (statistically at least, or in a possible
alternative world) Black, would she still be (non-)depressed, or would she change her status: this ‘what
if (‘ceteris paribus’ however) question is the key causal question in health disparities that most other
methods cannot directly address. In our case, of the non-depressed women who ‘started as White’ (at
the ‘pre’ or ‘baseline’, in the ‘change’ reading of paired data commonly analyzed by McNemar tests),
most (78%) would still be non-depressed if they ‘became Black’, while fewer would become depressed
(23%). On the other hand, if the depressed White women could ‘become Black’, most would become
 Brain Sci. 2018, 8, 207
8 of 13
non-depressed (84%), and only a few would stay depressed (16%). Note that unlike the pairing that is
achieved by time matching, when one records repeated scores for the same person, the pairing based
on socio-demographics is reciprocal, i.e., one can also read what would happen to a non-depressed (or
depressed) Black woman, had she ‘turned White’.
Similarly, to test differences or disparities between Black and White women in continuous
outcomes, one can now simply use paired t-tests (or better latent change score (LCS) models [50])
instead of independent samples t-tests, which for neighborhood disorder yields a t(20) = −1.985, p =
0.061, and for anxiety t(23) = 0.574, p = 0.574.
The key finding therefore is that whereas initially depression appeared to be (nearly) significantly
more prevalent in White than Black women, this 10.8% points difference was likely a slight
underestimate by about 1% points (according to the 1:1 matching method), and by 4.2% points
(according to the classic propensity score matching by strata). This difference is due to including in the
‘blind’ or raw comparison White and Black women who are not truly comparable (because one could
not randomize race). When the ‘un-matched’ cases are taken out, the initial advantage of Black women
increases. This is further confirmed by the fact that the ‘un-matchable’ Black women (n = 83) had a
similar depression rate (18.1%) as the un-matched White sub-group of women (n = 31, 22.6%).
We present in Table 5 comparable results for the classic (‘blind’) group comparison, the 1:1
matching, a logistic regression with the four demographic background factors as covariates, as well as
a propensity score matching analysis (using Stata’s psmatch2 [54]), and a clustered logit regression (an
alternative to 1:1 matching, by building off clusters of more than 1 woman from each group; 15 total
clusters were built, matched closely on the propensity scores). The results of the matching methods are
comparable, yet the 1:1 method allows for further analytic insight, like regressing some HD scores on
other HD scores, which we briefly report.

When we regressed the HD depression White-Black difference scores on the neighborhood HDs,
the effect was not significant, (β = 0.196 p = 0.314, see online appendix for details bit.ly/1to1depression;
we provide both Mplus [55] and AMOS [56] input and output for the LDS models; the binary nature
of depression was ignored in this exploratory illustration). The regression of the HD anxiety latent
difference score (LDS) on the neighborhood HDs yields a significant (standardized) effect: β = 0.642
(p < 0.001, R2 = 0.412), hence a sizable variability portion in anxiety HDs (41%) is explained by the
Black vs. White differences in neighborhood disorder: larger HDs between White and Black women in
neighborhood conditions lead to into larger HDs in anxiety.
5. Discussion
We presented an intuitive way of matching 1:1 individual participants from two racial/ethnic
(R/E) groups which allows for testing directly what explains the varying size of health disparities
scores (HDs) in health outcomes. This method turns the common HD estimate YB − YW (difference
 Brain Sci. 2018, 8, 207
9 of 13
between averages) into an average HDiY = YiB − YiW (average of differences) from matched variables YiB
and YiW. The new HDiY variable allows one to ask what causes such varying difference/disparities
scores, by regressing it on other differences, like socio-economic condition HDs. Directly exploring
causes of HDs in comparable minorities (vs. majority or reference groups) can be easily done by first
matching 1:1 individuals from both groups on factors like age, income, employment and education.
We found a HD of about 10.8% points, such that fewer Black women seemed to experience
depression than White women. If one compares truly comparable (‘exchangeable’) Black to White
participants, this difference is similar, of about 12% points, but the 1:1 matching moreover allows
for asking questions about what actually causes health disparities in depression or other mental
health outcomes.
Our approach reveals that even when HDs exist overall between two groups, there is a range of
such individual HDs, such that even if ‘the typical individual’ from a disadvantaged racial/ethnic
group experiences worse outcomes, some members of that group may exhibit a health benefit when
compared to reference individuals who are similar to them. Beyond simply aiming to document HDs,
our illustration shows that real life is more complex than mere average effects and effect sizes, and
that nuanced investigations of individual differences are worth pursuing. Even if research reports
that the population average HD in an outcome was not significantly different from zero, patient-level
health disparities may in fact exist for individual patients [57]. In other words, case-specific and
population-level causal HD statements can be at odds, for some individual cases, which is not
unusual [58]: the 1:1 matching makes these cases visible.
5.1. Limitations
This simple matching procedure allows one to begin answering new health disparities research
questions, much closer aligned to the ceteris paribus ‘what if’ question (see Marshall [59], as cited in [60]).
It brings to the forefront directly the issue of ‘exchangeability’ from the causal inference literature,
simplified in language by Judea Pearl in recent writings. Pearl calls two groups exchangeable if they
resemble each other in terms of “all characteristics that have bearing on the response variable” ([47],
p. 196). Our approach does the next natural step beyond merely imagining that people or patients
from two-groups hypothetical switched places, it allows for individual group members to (statistically)
swap positions (in some virtual causal world, or in an ideal ‘social space’ [61]), after being matched on
relevant characteristics). The conclusions are limited of course to the observed (measured) matching
factors, so full exchangeability that also covers unobserved confounders is not addressed here.
Examining more directly cause–effect processes involved in health disparities however requires a
more complex causal inference approach that is still in development [62–64]. The decision of what to
control for, or match on, is not statistical, but causal (conceptual/theoretical [65]), and hence researchers
can always debate why some covariates were included or excluded. Similar to selecting factors for
stratification or propensity matching, including in the matching pool intermediate effects on the path
from the grouping (race/ethnicity in our case) unto the outcome may introduce additional bias [66],
and education, income, and employment have been proven at times to act as mediators; at the opposite
end, including as many variables as available in a large pool of ‘independent variables’, as is often
done [67], can bias the causal effects sought after in health disparities research, when some of them are
mediators, because doing so statistically ‘blocks’ natural causal effects to the outcome [68].
5.2. Extensions
More formal ways of gauging the actual size of HDs besides a plain difference between averages
YB − YW become possible when one examines the range of possible HDi individual scores YiB − YiW
that the 1:1 matching approach we illustrated makes visible. Kessler & Greenberg [69] for example
proposed a measure of aggregate pair-wise differences, the sum of squares of difference scores, whose
benefits should be further explored. Simple and more complex structural models of the size of
discrepancies [70] can be explored, built around the latent difference/change scores made possible by
 Brain Sci. 2018, 8, 207
10 of 13
the 1:1 pairing [50,71]; such models can examine differential protective or detrimental effects posited
by recent health disparities theories, like the diminished health returns [72]. Further investigations are
also needed to unpack the mechanisms [73] behind the ‘Black–White paradox’ in mental health [52],
which was confirmed in our data.
