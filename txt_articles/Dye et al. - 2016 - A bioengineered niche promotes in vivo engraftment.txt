Abstract Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived tissues often remain developmentally
immature in vitro, and become more adult-like in their structure, cellular diversity and function
following transplantation into immunocompromised mice. Previously we have demonstrated that
hPSC-derived human lung organoids (HLOs) resembled human fetal lung tissue in vitro (Dye et al.,
2015). Here we show that HLOs required a bioartificial microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG)
scaffold niche for successful engraftment, long-term survival, and maturation of lung epithelium in
vivo. Analysis of scaffold-grown transplanted tissue showed airway-like tissue with enhanced
epithelial structure and organization compared to HLOs grown in vitro. By further comparing in
vitro and in vivo grown HLOs with fetal and adult human lung tissue, we found that in vivo
transplanted HLOs had improved cellular differentiation of secretory lineages that is reflective of
differences between fetal and adult tissue, resulting in airway-like structures that were remarkably
similar to the native adult human lung.

Introduction
The past decade has seen an exciting emergence of new models of human development and disease
(St Johnston, 2015). These advances stem from our ability to culture primary human tissues and
derive complex three-dimensional organ-like tissues, called organoids from human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs) (Dedhia et al., 2016; Fatehullah et al., 2016; Johnson and Hockemeyer, 2015;
Huch and Koo, 2015; Rookmaaker et al., 2015; Dye et al., 2016). Both tissue-derived and hPSC-
derived human lung models have been developed and recapitulate some structural and cellular fea-
tures of the human lung (Barkauskas et al., 2013; Rock et al., 2009; Gotoh et al., 2014;
Konishi et al., 2016; Vaughan et al., 2006; Pageau et al., 2011; Fessart et al., 2013;
Franzdo
´ttir et al., 2010; Kaisani et al., 2014; Dye et al., 2015; Firth et al., 2014; Mou et al.,
2016). For example, we recently described methods to direct differentiation of hPSCs in a stepwise
process, which mimicked aspects of in vivo lung development, into three-dimensional human lung
organoids (HLOs). HLOs possessed closed epithelial cysts resembling airway-like structures, which

 consisted of epithelial cells primarily expressing ciliated and basal cell markers. The airway-like struc-
tures were surrounded by mesenchyme, including cells expressing smooth muscle and myofibroblast
markers (Dye et al., 2015). Despite having airway-like organization around a lumen, the HLO epithe-
lium was disorganized and did not possess some cell types found in the mature airway, including
club and goblet secretory cell lineages. Consistent with in vitro differentiated HLOs being immature,
transcriptome-wide comparisons showed that HLOs were similar to the human fetal lung (Dye et al.,
2015).
In addition to HLOs, intestinal, kidney and cerebral organoids are similar to the analogous human
fetal organ (Dye et al., 2015; Finkbeiner et al., 2015b; Camp et al., 2015; Takasato et al., 2015).
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs), for example, are an in vitro three-dimensional model of the
human intestine derived from hPSCs that closely resemble the fetal intestine. When transplanted
under the mouse kidney capsule, HIOs mature and gain relevant adult structures including villi and
crypts (Finkbeiner et al., 2015b; Watson et al., 2014; Finkbeiner et al., 2015a). In the current
work, our goal was to transplant HLOs to determine if an in vivo environment would enhance
the structural organization and cellular differentiation of the airway-like tissue.
Our results show that, unlike intestinal organoids, HLOs placed under the mouse kidney capsule,
in the omentum, or the epididymal fat pad did not generate lung epithelial structures or cell types.
Thus, while all of these highly vascular sites have been utilized for engraftment in other contexts
(Finkbeiner et al., 2015b; Watson et al., 2014; Pepper et al., 2013; Bartholomeus et al., 2013;
Smink et al., 2013), HLOs did not thrive in these environments. We turned to microporous poly(lac-
tide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds in order to create an alternative niche for the HLOs during trans-
plantation since PLG scaffolds have led to improved survival and function of pancreatic beta cells
following transplantation (Gibly et al., 2013; Blomeier et al., 2006; Hlavaty et al., 2014;
Graham et al., 2013; Kheradmand et al., 2011).
Our results demonstrate that microporous PLG scaffolds provided a niche for HLOs that enhance
survival and engraftment upon transplantation into the epididymal fat pad of NOD-scid IL2Rgnull
(NSG) mice. After 8–15 weeks, the retrieved transplanted HLOs (tHLOs) possessed airway-like struc-
tures with improved epithelial organization resembling the human adult lung and demonstrated
enhanced cellular differentiation into basal, ciliated, club, and goblet cells. The tHLO airway struc-
tures were vascularized, and surrounded by mesenchymal cells that expressed both smooth muscle
and myofibroblast markers, in addition to areas of organized cartilage. This work demonstrates that
hPSC-derived lung tissue can give rise to complex multicellular airway-like structures in vivo, similar
to those found in the adult human lung.
Results
Lung epithelium does not persist when HLOs are transplanted into mice
It has been shown that hPSC derived intestinal organoids acquire crypt and villus structures resem-
bling the adult intestine along with mature cell types by transplantation into a highly vascular in
vivo environment such as the kidney capsule or the abdominal omentum (Finkbeiner et al., 2015b;
Watson et al., 2014). A similar strategy was employed in an attempt to engraft and mature HLOs,
in which several different experimental conditions and engraftment sites were attempted utilizing
NSG mice. Experiments were initially conducted using the hESC line UM63-1, and all major findings
were reproduced in two additional hESC lines; H1 and H9 (Table 1). Data presented throughout the
manuscript are from the hESC line UM63-1, unless otherwise stated. In our first attempt, 35d (35 day
old) HLOs were placed under the kidney capsule and were harvested after 4 weeks (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 1A–B). The retrieved organoids expressed the human-specific mitochondria marker
(huMITO), but lacked NKX2.1+ lung epithelium (Table 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C). We
hypothesized that an earlier stage of HLO cultures may be more proliferative and therefore have
better survival upon engraftment. 1d HLOs were injected under the kidney capsule (Table 1, Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1D). After 6 weeks, the tissue had expanded, surpassing the size of the
kidney (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Further analysis demonstrated that the tissue was of
human origin (huMITO+), but no NKX2.1+ epithelium was observed (Figure 1—figure supplement
1F). Thus, the age of transplanted HLOs did not seem to affect the survival of the HLO lung
epithelium.

 Next, we assessed the effect of the transplant site on HLO maturation. 65d HLOs were placed
into the abdominal omentum and secured in place with a stitch, which also allowed us to identify the
site of the transplant. Tissues were harvested after 12 weeks (Table 1, Figure 1—figure supplement
1G–H), and again were positive for huMITO, but the majority did not have evidence of a lung epithe-
lium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I). Only 2 of the 13 mice transplanted in this cohort demon-
strated huMITO+ airway-like structures as indicated by expression of the lung epithelial marker
NKX2.1, the basal cell marker P63, and the ciliated cell marker FOXJ1 (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 2). Taken together, these data indicated that alternative sites of transplantation did not
robustly support survival or growth of the HLO lung epithelium in vivo (Table 1).
Microporous scaffolds provide a niche enhancing in vivo engraftment
and survival of lung epithelium
Given that we recovered human tissues that were largely devoid of lung epithelium, we hypothe-
sized that transplantation of HLOs would be enhanced if provided a structural niche, which has been
demonstrated to improve engraftment, vascularization and to support the survival of transplanted
pancreatic beta cells (Gibly et al., 2013; Blomeier et al., 2006; Hlavaty et al., 2014;
Graham et al., 2013; Kheradmand et al., 2011; Gibly et al., 2011). Microporous PLG scaffolds pro-
vide a rigid environment for the tissue to adhere to along with a porous (250–425 mm diameter) hon-
eycomb-like structure to enable tissue growth and infiltration of vasculature (Figure 1A). In order to
prepare PLG-HLO constructs for transplant, HLOs were suspended in Matrigel and pipetted onto
the scaffolds. 1d HLOs were able to adhere to the pores on the scaffold, with the majority of the
HLOs scattered across the 5 mm diameter surface, and a few towards the middle of the 2 mm thick
scaffold (Figure 1B–C). HLO-seeded PLG scaffolds were subsequently cultured for 5 to 7 days in
vitro submersed in 500 ng/mL FGF10 supplemented media, the same media used to grow HLOs in
vitro (Dye et al., 2015) (Figure 1D). Following 5–7 days of culture, constructs were transplanted
directly, or dipped in Matrigel supplemented with FGF10 (500 ng/mL) prior to transplantation. Both
conditions were transplanted into the mouse epididymal fat pad (Matrigel/FGF10 n = 8; without
Table 1. Overview of Organoid transplants. Transplant site refers to where the tissue was placed in the mouse. HLOs grown in vitro
from 1 to 65 days (d) were transplanted and tissues were harvested at various time points ranging from 4 to 15 weeks (wks). Three
hESC lines were used including UM63-1, H9, and H1. The most successful transplants that contained mature airway-like structures
were 1d HLOs seeded onto the PLG scaffolds with or without Matrigel and FGF10 after 8 to 15 weeks.

 Matrigel/FGF10 n = 4, Table 1 and Figure 1D–E). In both conditions, 100% of the recovered con-
structs possessed NKX2.1+ airway-like structures (n = 12 total) (Characterized in Figures 1–
3, Table 1), suggesting that the addition of Matrigel/FGF10 prior to transplant was not necessary,
but that the scaffold provided critical support for engraftment and survival of the lung epithelium.
The epididymal fat pad was chosen as the site for transplantation because it was the only site able
to accommodate the large size of the scaffold-HLO construct while still providing a highly vascular
environment. As a control, 1d HLOs in a Matrigel plug (without being placed on a scaffold) were
transplanted into the epididymal fat pad but no tissue was recovered at 8 weeks post-transplant
(Table 1). We also demonstrated that HLOs generated from three independent hESC lines (H1, H9,
UM63-1) developed similarly following transplantation on scaffolds (Table 1). Collectively, these
data demonstrated that PLG scaffolds provide a robust niche, enabling HLOs to engraft and survive
in the epididymal fat pad.
The Matrigel/FGF10 treated scaffold constructs were harvested at two time points, 4 weeks and
8 weeks after transplant (Table 1). After 4 weeks of transplantation, constructs had airway-like struc-
tures that resembled in vitro grown HLOs (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) (Dye et al., 2015). 4
week HLO constructs had NKX2.1 +/huMITO+ airway-like structures that consisted of cells express-
ing the basal cell marker P63 and ciliated markers FOXJ1 and Acetylated Tubulin (ACTTUB), but the
secretory club cell marker CC10 (also known as SCGB1A1) was not detected, suggesting that 4
weeks of transplantation did not lead to enhanced structure within HLOs (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 4).
The scaffold-HLO constructs harvested after 8 weeks ranged in size from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm
(Figure 1F). We observed that each transplanted HLO had multiple epithelial structures per cross
section. To further characterize the in vivo grown HLOs, we quantified the total number of epithelial
structures (ECAD+) per cross-section and found that 86.19% of all ECAD structures were also
NKX2.1+ (Figure 1G,I, Figure 1—source data 1). The histology of the transplanted tissue revealed
airway-like structures tightly surrounded by mesenchymal cells. In addition, there were pockets of
organized cartilage throughout the transplants (Figure 1H). Epithelial structures were verified to be
of human origin using huMITO and the human-specific nuclear marker HUNU (Figure 1J–K). As a
control, 1d HLOs were seeded on the scaffold and grown in vitro for 4 to 8 weeks. These in
vitro grown HLO-scaffolds had significantly less growth, and although some cells expressed the lung
marker NKX2.1, no airway structures were observed (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). This is

 possibly due to the fact that HLOs grown in vitro are normally embedded in Matrigel and passaged
every two weeks whereas tissue grown on the scaffolds could not be passaged, and were not
embedded in Matrigel. Thus, results from in vitro grown scaffold-HLO constructs suggest that the
scaffold alone does not support long term HLO growth or induce the enhanced epithelial organiza-
tion or maturation, but the combination of the scaffold and the in vivo environment allows for
growth and maturation of the HLO epithelium.
In vivo grown HLO-scaffold constructs have enhanced epithelial
structure and cellular differentiation
The native lung is organized into airway structures and alveoli. Interestingly, even though in
vitro grown HLOs possessed alveolar cell types (Dye et al., 2015), we could not find evidence for
the ATI marker HOPX or the ATII marker SFTPC in tHLOs at 4 or 8 weeks indicating that these cell
types do not persist in vivo (data not shown). Native lung airways are organized into a SOX2+ pseu-
dostratified epithelium with basal and multiciliated cells being the most prevalent cell types in the
airway (Mercer et al., 1994; Li et al., 2013; Morrisey and Hogan, 2010). Both non-transplanted
HLOs and transplanted HLOs expressed the airway marker SOX2; however, tHLOs on scaffolds
formed a highly organized pseudostratified epithelium, including taller ECAD+ cells that had a
clearly visible apical and basal surface similar to the adult human airway (Figure 2A; Note that adult
human airways examined are consider lower bronchi as detailed in the Materials and methods). The
average cell height – from the apical to basal surface – of cells lining the tHLO airway-like lumen was
similar to adult lungs while the non-transplanted HLOs grown in Matrigel had significantly shorter
cells than the tHLOs and adult lungs (Figure 2B). In both fetal upper airways and adult airways, basal
cells line the basal side of the airway epithelium and express markers including P63, cytokeratin 5
(CK5), and NGFR (2C-E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C; Note that fetal human airways exam-
ined are considered upper bronchi, as detailed in the Materials and methods). Both non-trans-
planted and transplanted HLOs possessed cells lining the basal side of the airway-like structures that
expressed the basal cell markers P63, CK5, and NGFR, however; basal cells in tHLOs had cellular
organization and shape more reminiscent of the native human lung (Figure 2C–E).
Upon dissection of tHLOs, we observed tube-like structures within the 8 week constructs. Micro-
dissected tube-like structures were stained for FOXJ1 and P63 using whole-mount immunostaining,
followed by confocal imaging (Figure 2F). Whole-mount imaging revealed tube-like structures with
abundant FOXJ1 and P63 expressing cells. P63+ cells appeared to line the basal surface of the tube,
while FOXJ1 appeared to be located closer to the lumen. A cross section through a three-dimen-
sional rendered airway revealed that the structure had a lumen lined by FOXJ1+ cells, while P63+

 cells lined the outside of the tube along the basal side of the airway-like tissue. This organization
was similar to the upper airways in the adult and fetal human lung (Figure 2F, Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1A–C). Although several tube-like structures were observed, micro-dissection was very dis-
ruptive, and did not allow accurate quantitation of the number of these structures. Thus, it is likely
that not all airway-like structures were shaped as a tube, and cyst-shaped airway structures are also
present within the transplants. In the adult airway and fetal upper airway sections, the majority of
the cells facing toward the lumen express the ciliated cell marker FOXJ1 and are multiciliated, dem-
onstrated by ACTTUB staining (Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D. In vitro grown
HLOs have scattered cells that express FOXJ1 and few disorganized cells that are multiciliated as
shown by ACTTUB immunofluorescence (Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,D). In con-
trast, most of the cells facing toward the lumen in tHLOs were FOXJ1+, multiciliated as shown by
ACTTUB immunofluorescence, and highly organized in a manner similar to the adult airway
(Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D). In addition, microdissection of tHLO airway-like
structures revealed abundant beating multiciliated cells suggesting that these cells are functional
(Video 1).
In order to demonstrate variability across multiple tHLOs (n = 9 independent transplants), we
quantitated the percent of all epithelial structures within tHLOs that are NKX2.1+ (Figure 1—source
data 1), along with the percent of NKX2.1+ epithelial structures that also displayed improved orga-
nization and possessed differentiated cell types (Figure 2H, Figure 2—source data 1). We observed
that 97.53% of all NKX2.1+ airway-like structures in the tHLOs possessed abundant multiciliated
cells, as determined by ACTTUB immunofluorescence (Figure 2H, Figure 2—source data 1). This
finding is consistent with data demonstrating that multiciliated cells are the most abundant cell type
within human adult airway epithelium (Mercer et al., 1994).
The secretory cells of the lung, goblet and club cells, are fewer in number and are scattered
throughout mature human airways (Figure 3A–B)
(Mercer
et
al.,
1994).
We
had
previously
reported that HLOs grown in vitro possessed rare
cells expressing low levels of the club cell marker
CC10 and we did not detect cells expressing
MUC5AC protein, which is found in goblet cells
(Dye et al., 2015). We asked if the lack of differ-
entiated secretory cell types reflected an imma-
ture stage of development by comparing cellular
differentiation in human adult and fetal airways.
In adult airways, cells expressing the club cell
markers CC10 and PLUNC and cells expressing
the goblet cell marker MUC5AC were scattered
throughout the airway (Figure 3A–B, Figure 3—
figure supplement 1). In contrast, we could not
find evidence for robust expression of any of
these markers in the human fetal lung at 14
weeks of gestation (Figure 3A–B, Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 1). Similar to the adult airway,

 we observed that the tHLO epithelium had distinct CC10+, PLUNC+, and MUC5AC+ cells
(Figure 3C–E). Further quantification of secretory cells in multiple tHLOs (n = 9 independent trans-
plants) revealed biological heterogeneity across samples. On average 45.55% of all NKX2.1+ airways
contained CC10+ secretory cells and 70.43% contained MUC5AC+ secreting cells, however; variabil-
ity ranged from some individual tHLOs possessing no secretory cells (n = 2/9 possessed no CC10+;
n = 1/9 possessed no MUC5AC+) to 100% of all airway structures within an individual tHLO possess-
ing secretory cell types (n = 1/9 CC10+; n = 3/9 MUC5AC+) (Figure 2H, Figure 2—source data 1).
Highly organized airway-like structures with multiple cell types (P63+ basal, ACTTUB+ multiciliated,
CC10+ club and MUC5AC+ goblet cells) were also observed in tHLOs derived from the H9 and H1
cell lines, indicating that maturation of airway-like structures upon transplantation is reproducible
across multiple cell lines (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Moreover, airway-like structures trans-
planted for different lengths of times (8 weeks, 15 weeks) appeared similar in epithelial organization
and in expression of mature airway markers (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Taken together, our
data demonstrate that in vivo grown tHLOs possess airway-like epithelium with basal, ciliated, gob-
let, and club cells in a highly organized pseudostratified epithelium that resembled both the struc-
ture and cellular diversity of adult human airways.
Transplanted HLOs possess diverse mesenchymal cell types and
vasculature
Along with the epithelium, native adult airways are surrounded by smooth muscle, myofibroblasts,
and cartilage. The tHLO airway structures were surrounded by cells expressing both smooth muscle
actin (SMA) and PDGFRa positive (SMA+/PDGFRa+) along with SMA+PDGFRa- cells (Figure 4A),
which are markers for myofibroblasts and smooth muscle respectively (Boucherat et al., 2007;
Hinz et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2012). We have previously reported that HLOs grown in vitro did not
possess cartilage (Dye et al., 2015). Consistent with these previous findings, cartilage was not pres-
ent in control scaffolds seeded with HLOs and grown in vitro, as shown by the absence of SafraninO
staining (Figure 4B). Interestingly, tHLOs possessed areas of organized cartilage indicated by cell
morphology and staining for SafraninO (Figure 1H, Figure 4B). Cartilage within the tHLOs
expressed the cartilage marker SOX9, along with the human mitochondrial marker, huMITO, indicat-
ing that the cartilage was derived from the transplanted tissue (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).
Further analysis of in vitro grown HLOs revealed that there were areas of SOX9+ mesenchyme, sug-
gesting that a putative population of cartilage precursors is present in the HLOs grown in
vitro (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).
Finally, upon gross inspection of tHLOs, we observed abundant vasculature associated with the
tissue,
an
observation
that
is
consistent
with
transplanted
human
intestinal
organoids
(Watson et al., 2014).
Discussion
To date, several groups have derived two and three-dimensional lung models from both primary
human lung tissue and from hPSCs that consist of airway epithelial cell types (Barkauskas et al.,
2013; Rock et al., 2009; Gotoh et al., 2014; Konishi et al., 2016; Dye et al., 2015; Firth et al.,
2014; Mou et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2013). Tissue grown on an air-liquid inter-
face generated an organized pseudostratified epithelium that reflects most of the cellular diversity
of the human airway (Mou et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2012), while other models possess an airway
epithelium with a supporting mesenchyme (Firth et al., 2014). Previous work has also shown that
lung epithelial cells derived from hPSC monolayers transplanted underneath a mouse kidney capsule
can further differentiate into cells expressing airway and alveolar markers over a period of six months
(Huang et al., 2013). However, it was unclear how robust this approach was, and whether this
yielded tissue with any degree of organization. To our knowledge, the work presented here is the
first to show that hPSC-derived HLOs are able to engraft in vivo and differentiate into an organized
pseudostratified airway-like epithelium with a complete repertoire of airway cell types and support-
ing mesenchyme, along with a vascular supply and the ability to survive for long periods of time.
Interestingly, our findings demonstrated that despite the fact that in vitro grown HLOs possessed
alveolar cell types, we found no evidence of alveolar cells or alveolar structure in tHLOs. Given that
the alveolar cell types present in HLOs were few in number, it is possible that these cells were not

 abundant enough to persist in vitro, or alternatively, that PLG scaffolds did not promote their sur-
vival. Ongoing studies are aimed at better understanding how to generate these distal airway
structures.
Here, we used microporous PLG scaffolds to provide a physical environment for HLO engraftment
in vivo however; alternative engineering approaches have also been developed as a platform to
grow organized lung-like structures. For example, decelluarized lung scaffolds have been employed
to seed primary and derived lung tissue in order to provide an appropriate physical and structural
environment and in attempts to generate lung-like tissue (Dye et al., 2015; Gilpin et al., 2014,
2016; Booth et al., 2012; Ghaedi et al., 2014). Many efforts have focused on seeding alveolar tis-
sue including alveolar type I and II cells onto acellular matrices (Gilpin et al., 2014; Booth et al.,
2012; Ghaedi et al., 2014), and lung tissue derived from mouse embryonic stem cells seeded on
decellularized rat lung matrix enhanced maturation of airway cell types and epithelial organization
(Shojaie et al., 2015). Our data previously demonstrated that in vitro grown HLOs seeded onto an
adult human decelluarized lung matrix allowed adherence of the HLO epithelium to the airway
matrix and resulted in the differentiation of a small number of multiciliated cells, but did not enhance
club or goblet cell differentiation (Dye et al., 2015). Collectively, our data along with the data from
decelluarized lung scaffolds suggest that providing an ideal physical environment may be an impor-
tant factor for promoting tissue organization and differentiation, but that additional cues will also be
required for full tissue maturation.
Recent breakthroughs in biomimetic microfluidic cell-culture devices called ’organs on a chip’
have also generated airway epithelium from human adult airway cells grown on an air-liquid interface
platform. The microfluidic devices allow are designed to mimic the microenvironment of the airway,
and can include controlled media flow and multiple cell layers including human primary epithelium,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (Sellgren et al., 2014; Benam et al., 2016). These in vitro systems
successfully mimic the microenvironment of an airway, but are designed for small scale and high
throughput applications. In contrast tHLOs are an in vivo system that may be more appropriate for
low-throughput disease modeling or for pre-clinical drug testing, which has a great unmet need for
better models that more accurately mimic human
tissue in both healthy and diseased states in
order to improve prediction of drug efficacy. This
is particularly true for diseases that affect the
lung, in part because commonly used animal
models do not faithfully recapitulate several key
aspects of the human disease (Moore and Hoga-
boam, 2008). Moreover, there is generally a
poor track record of accurately predicting which
drugs will work in humans based on pre-clinical
animal models (Ruggeri et al., 2014; Mak et al.,
2014), as up to 80% of drugs that pass pre-clini-
cal tests fail in humans (Perrin, 2014). A prime
example of this is in lung disease where many
therapies have shown benefit in mouse models,
but only 2 of these have shown benefit in humans
(Mylla
¨rniemi and Kaarteenaho, 2015).

 It is interesting to speculate that tHLOs will have utility as a novel model to study complex tissue-
tissue interactions in airway homeostasis or disease. For example, since tHLOs have the potential to
interact with the host immune system, and since the epithelium possesses diverse cell types includ-
ing club and goblet cells, it may be possible to model inflammatory insults resulting in goblet cell
hyperplasia. Future directions will be aimed at exploiting this new in vivo model of the human airway
to better understand disease and to improve human health.

 Materials and methods
Cell lines, human tissue and animals
Human ES line UM63-1 (NIH registry #0277) was obtained from the University of Michigan and
human ES line H9 (NIH registry #0062) and H1 (NIH registry #0043) was obtained from the WiCell
Research Institute. All experiments using human ES cells were approved by the University of Michi-
gan Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee. ES cell lines are routinely karyo-
typed to ensure normal karyotype, at which time the sex chromosomes of each line are confirmed
(H9 - XX; H1 - XY; UM63-1 - XX). Monthly mycoplasma monitoring is conducted on all cell lines using
the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Human tissue: Normal, de-identified human fetal
lung tissue was obtained from the University of Washington Laboratory of Developmental Biology.
Normal, de-identified human adult lung tissue was obtained from deceased organ donors through
the Gift of Life, Michigan. All research with human tissue was approved by the University of Michigan
institutional review board. Animal use: All mouse work was reviewed and approved by the University
of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals.
Maintenance of hESCs and generation of foregut spheroids and HLOs
Stem cells were maintained on hESC-qualified Matrigel (Corning, Cat#: 354277) in mTesR1 medium
(STEM CELL Technologies). HESCs were passaged as previously described (Spence et al., 2011).
HLOs were generated as previously described (Dye et al., 2015). All HLOs imaged and quantifica-
tions of tHLOs were derived from UM63-1 unless otherwise stated.
Kidney capsule and omentum transplants
Mice were anesthetized using 2% isofluorane. The left flank was sterilized using Chlorhexidine and
isopropyl alcohol. A left flank incision was used to expose the kidney. 35d HLOs were manually
placed in a subcapsular pocket of the kidney of male 7–10 week old NOD-scid IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice
using forceps. An intraperitoneal flush of Zosyn (100 mg/kg; Pfizer Inc.) was administered prior to
closure in two layers. The mice were sacrificed and transplant retrieved after 4 weeks. Foregut sphe-
roids mixed with 100% Matrigel were injected underneath the mouse kidney capsule using a flexible
catheter and transplants were retrieved after 6 weeks. For omental transplants, the abdomen was
prepped and a midline incision was used to expose the greater omentum. 65d HLOs were sutured
into the greater omentum using non-absorbable suture. Transplants were retrieved after 12 weeks.
Scaffolds transplants
PLG scaffolds were generated as previously described (Blomeier et al., 2006). Briefly, 2.5 mg of 6%
PLG and 75 mg of NaCl (250–425 mm diameter) were mixed and incubated at 37˚C for 7 min and
then set at room temperature for 6 min. The mixture was pressed into 2 mm thick, 5 mm wide cylin-
ders at 1500 psi for 30 s. Pressed scaffolds were foamed at 800 psi CO2 for 16 hr. Foamed scaffolds
can be stored in a dry environment for weeks. PLG scaffolds were leeched in ddH2O for two 1-hr
washes to remove NaCl. The scaffolds were then washed in 70% EtOH for 2 min for sterilization prior
to use in experiments and dried for 5 min. PLG scaffolds were flushed with 15 mL of cold hESC quali-
fied Matrigel diluted in DMEM/F12 (dilution factor is lot dependent, Corning Cat#: 354277) and
incubated at 37˚C for 15 min. This step was repeated twice. Lung spheroids were mixed with 100%
Matrigel (Corning, Cat#: 354234) and pipetted into the scaffold. The seeded scaffolds were incu-
bated for 15 min at 37˚C and then overlaid with HLO media (500 ng/mL FGF10 and 1% FBS in basal
foregut media described in [Dye et al., 2015]). Scaffolds were cultured for 5 to 7 days in vitro with
media being changed every other day. Scaffolds cultured with spheroids were removed from culture
and were then immersed in Matrigel supplemented with 500 ng/mL FGF10, allowed to solidify for 5
min or were directly used for transplants. Mice were anesthetized and prepped as for omental trans-
plants. The epididymal fat pads of male 7–10 week old NOD-scid IL2Rgnull (NSG) were exposed
using a lower midline incision. Matrigel coated scaffolds were then placed along the epididymal
blood vessels and covered with epididymal fat. An intraperitoneal flush of Zosyn (100 mg/kg; Pfizer
Inc.) was administered after which the incision was closed in 2-layers using absorbable suture. Mice
were sacrificed between 4 and 15 weeks post-transplant.

 Spheroid dye
Vybrant DiO Cell-Labeling Solution (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used based on manufacture’s pro-
tocol. Briefly, spheroids were incubated with the dye (5 mL dye per 1 mL media) for 20 min at 37˚C.
Spheroids were washed in media two times and were ready to use and image.
Tissue sectioning, immunohistochemistry and imaging
For human tissue sections: Anatomically, we considered the upper airway to be anything above the
terminal bronchioles in the lung. Analyses conducted on human adult airways were carried out on
sections through the lower bronchi of the upper airway, defined by the lack of adjacent cartilage
and pseudostratified, undulated epithelial architecture. Analysis of human fetal airways was carried
out on sections through bronchi and/or bronchioles of the upper airway at a level where
the adjacent cartilage was present. Immunostaining was carried out as previously described
(Rockich et al., 2013). Antibody information and dilutions can be found in Table 2. All images and
videos were taken on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope or an Olympus IX71 epifluorescent micro-
scope. Imaris software was used to render Z-stack three-dimensional images.
Quantification
ECAD+ tissue was counted as airways with or without NKX2.1. In Figure 2H, NKX2.1+ airway-like
tissue within individual tHLOs were quantitated to determine if they possessed ciliated cells, club
cells or goblet cells by co-immunostaining with NKX2.1, ACTTUB, CC10 and MUC5AC antibodies,
respectively. Cell height was measured of the cells facing in toward a lumen of an airway stained
with ECAD by using ImageJ software.
Experimental replicates and statistics
All immunofluorescence (IF) were done on at least three (n = 3) independent biological samples per
experiment except for foregut spheroids injected into the kidney capsule. Only 1 out 3 transplanted
foregut spheroids under the kidney capsule yielded retrievable tissue; therefore only 1 sample was
used for the IF analysis. For the airway quantification and cell height quantification the error bars
represented SEM while the long bar represented the average. Statistical differences were assessed
with Prism software using multiple t tests.
