Following
 binding
 to cannabinoid
 receptors,
 endocannabinoids
 regulate
 a
 variety
 of  central
 nervous
 sys-
tem
 processes
 including
 appetite  and  mood.
 Recent
 evidence
 suggests
 that the  systemic  release
 of  these
lipid
 metabolites
 can  be altered  by  acute  exercise
 and  that  their
 levels  also  vary  across
 the  24-h  sleep-
wake
 cycle.
 The
 present
 study
 utilized
 a within-subject
 design
 (involving
 16  normal-weight
 men)
 to
determine
 whether
 daytime
 circulating
 endocannabinoid
 concentrations
 differ  following
 three  nights
 of
partial
 sleep
 deprivation
 (4.25-h
 sleep  opportunity,
 2:45–7  a.m.  each
 night)  vs.  normal
 sleep  (8.5-h  sleep
opportunity,
 10:30  p.m.–7  a.m.  each  night),
 before
 and after  an  acute  bout  of  ergometer
 cycling  in the
morning.
 In addition,
 subjective
 hunger
 and  stress  were  measured.
 Pre-exercise
 plasma  concentrations
of
 2-arachidonoylglycerol
 (2AG)  were  80%  higher
 1.5  h
 after  awakening
 (vs. normal
 sleep,  p  < 0.05)
 when
participants
 were  sleep-deprived.
 This  coincided
 with  increased
 hunger
 ratings  (+25%
 vs.  normal
 sleep,
p
 <  0.05).
 Moreover,
 plasma
 2AG  was  elevated
 15  min  post-exercise
 (+44%,
 p
 <  0.05).
 Sleep  duration
 did
not
 however
 modulate
 this  exercise-induced
 rise.  Finally,
 subjective
 stress  was  generally
 lower
 on  the  day
after
 three  nights
 of
 short  sleep
 vs.  normal
 sleep,  especially
 after  exercise
 (p  <  0.05).
 Given that  activation
of
 the endocannabinoid
 system
 has  been
 previously
 shown
 to acutely
 increase
 appetite
 and
 mood,
 our
results
 could  suggest
 that
 behavioral
 effects  of acute  sleep  loss,  such
 as  increased
 hunger  and  transiently
improved
 psychological
 state,
 may
 partially
 result  from
 activation
 of  this  signaling
 pathway.
 In contrast,
more
 pronounced
 exercise-induced
 elevations
 of  endocannabinoids
 appear
 to  be
 less  affected
 by
 short
sleep
 duration.

 Introduction
The
 
endocannabinoids
 
anandamide
 
(AEA)
 
and
 
2-
arachidonoylglycerol
 (2AG)
 are
 endogenously
 produced
 lipids
that
 have
 been
 found,
 for
 instance,
 to
 be
 elevated
 in
 blood
 in
response
 to
 psychological
 stress
 (Hill
 et
 al.,
 2009;
 Dlugos
 et
 al.,
2012).
 Due
 to
 their
 highly
 lipophilic
 properties,
 endocannabinoids
can
 readily
 cross
 the
 blood–brain
 barrier.
 Following
 their

to
 central
 nervous
 system
 receptors
 (e.g.
 CB1
 receptors),
 endo-
cannabinoids
 have
 been
 shown,
 e.g.,
 to
 reduce
 anxiety
 (Marsicano
et
 al.,
 2002;
 Lutz
 et
 al.,
 2015)
 and
 increase
 food
 intake
 (Di
 Marzo
et
 al.,
 2001).
 In
 relation
 to
 the
 latter,
 recent
 findings
 suggest
2AG
 to
 be
 more
 linked
 to
 hedonic
 motivation
 for
 food
 whereas
AEA
 seems
 to
 be
 more
 involved
 in
 driving
 homeostatic
 eating
(Monteleone
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Remarkably,
 the
 aforementioned
 effects
of
 endocannabinoids
 resonate
 with
 those
 of
 sleep
 restriction,
 an
increasingly
 prevalent
 stressor
 in
 modern
 society
 (Ford
 et
 al.,
2015).
 Acute
 sleep
 loss
 increases
 food
 intake
 and
 ideal
 portion
sizes
 (Hogenkamp
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 St-Onge
 et
 al.,
 2011),
 accentuates
the
 brain’s
 hedonic
 response
 to
 food
 (Benedict
 et
 al.,
 2012),
 and
relatedly,
 impairs
 the
 ability
 to
 cognitively
 inhibit

responses
 to
 rewarding
 food
 stimuli
 (Cedernaes
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 topics
reviewed
 in
 Cedernaes
 et
 al.,
 2015a).
 Moreover,
 similar
 to
 the
anxiolytic
 effects
 of
 endocannabinoids,
 acute
 sleep
 deprivation
has
 repeatedly
 been
 shown
 to
 acutely
 alleviate
 symptoms
 of
depression
 (Wu et
 al.,
 1999).
 However,
 to
 date,
 only
 two
 studies
have
 been
 able
 to
 link
 systemic
 release
 of
 plasma
 concentrations
of
 endocannabinoids
 to
 acute
 sleep
 loss
 in
 humans
 (Hanlon
 et
 al.,
2016;
 Vaughn
 et
 al.,
 2010),
 and
 have
 not
 tested
 how
 further
physiological
 stress
 impacts
 this
 signaling
 system.
Another
 stressor
 that
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 activate
 the
 endo-
cannabinoid
 system
 is
 physical
 exercise
 (Dietrich
 and
 McDaniel,
2004).
 For
 instance,
 a
 recent
 study
 involving
 11
 healthy
 trained
male
 cyclists
 found
 plasma
 AEA
 concentrations
 to
 be
 increased
 dur-
ing
 and
 shortly
 after
 intense
 exercise
 (i.e., 60
 min
 at
 55%
 followed
by
 30
 min
 at
 75%
 Wmax;
 Heyman
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 In
 another
 study,
treadmill
 running
 resulted
 in
 increased
 blood
 levels
 of
 AEA;
 how-
ever,
 only
 at
 moderate
 –
 versus
 low
 or
 high
 –
 exercise
 intensity
 (i.e.,
at
 70–85%
 of
 age-adjusted
 maximum
 heart
 rate)
 (Raichlen
 et
 al.,
2013).
 Finally,
 a
 study
 involving
 24
 young
 males
 demonstrated
 that
1
 h
 of
 moderate
 intensity
 exercise
 increased
 plasma
 AEA
 concen-
trations.
 In
 the
 same
 study,
 plasma
 2AG
 concentrations
 showed
 a
similar
 trend
 to
 increase
 following
 exercise,
 but
 failed
 to
 reach
 sta-
tistical
 significance
 (Sparling
 et
 al.,
 2003).
 To
 our
 best
 knowledge,
no
 study
 has
 yet
 investigated
 whether
 exercise-induced
 elevations
of
 endocannabinoids
 are
 affected
 by
 short
 sleep
 duration.
 Exercise-
induced
 elevations
 of
 endocannabinoid
 levels
 have
 been
 proposed
to
 account
 partially
 for
 anxiolytic
 (Tantimonaco
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Fuss
et
 al.,
 2015),
 anti-nociceptive
 (Galdino
 et
 al.,
 2014)
 and
 neuro-
protective
 (Hill
 et
 al.,
 2010a)
 properties
 of
 exercise,
 which
 are
 all
responses
 that
 instead
 are
 affected
 in
 a
 negative
 direction
 by
 sleep
loss
 (e.g.
 Roy-Byrne
 et
 al.,
 1986;
 Schuh-Hofer
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 Cedernaes
et
 al.,
 2016).
Against
 this
 background,
 the
 present
 study,
 involving
 16
 healthy
normal-weight
 men,
 sought
 to
 determine
 whether
 short
 sleep
vs.
 normal
 sleep
 duration
 would
 alter
 circulating
 levels
 of
 differ-
ent
 endocannabinoid
 species,
 before
 and
 after
 an
 acute
 bout
 of
ergometer
 cycling.
 In
 addition,
 subjective
 stress
 and
 hunger
 ratings
were
 measured.
 Given
 that
 increased
 systemic
 release
 of
 plasma
concentrations
 of
 endocannabinoids
 has
 recently
 been
 linked
 to
acute
 sleep
 loss,
 we
 expected
 recurrent
 sleep
 loss
 to
 alter
 plasma
endocannabinoid
 concentrations.
 Moreover,
 we
 hypothesized
 that
exercise
 would
 transiently
 increase
 plasma
 endocannabinoid
 con-
centrations.

 Material
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Participants
Sixteen
 male
 non-smokers
 were
 included
 in
 the
 present
 study
[age:
 22.9
 ±
 0.66
 years;
 BMI:
 22.9
 ±
 0.46
 kg/m2].
 An
 anamnestic
interview
 by
 a
 medical
 doctor
 (J.C.)
 before
 study
 inclusion
 ensured
that
 participants
 were
 in
 general
 good
 health
 (also
 verified
 by
clinical
 blood
 parameters,
 e.g.
 white
 blood
 cell
 count),
 not
 on
medication,
 and
 that
 none
 of
 them
 reported
 to
 have
 been
 ever
been
 diagnosed
 with
 or
 treated
 for
 a
 psychiatric
 condition.
 This
evaluation
 included
 general
 questions
 regarding
 current
 and
prior
 depressive,
 anxiety
 or
 other
 psychiatric
 symptoms,
 hered-
ity,
 as
 well
 as
 possible
 current
 or
 prior
 use
 of
 medications
 or
dietary/pharmaceutical
 supplements,
 including
 specific
 questions
about
 psychiatric
 medications.
 Answers
 were
 also
 confirmed
 and
further
 elaborated
 during
 an
 anamnestic
 interview
 prior
 to
 study
inclusion
 (conducted
 by
 J.C.).
 Only
 subjects
 who
 stated
 during
screening
 that
 they
 habitually
 go
 to
 bed
 between
 10
 p.m.
 and
12
 p.m.,
 and
 who
 slept
 7–9
 sleep
 hours
 per
 night,
 were
 included
in
 the
 present
 study.
All
 participants
 provided
 written
 informed
 consent.
 The
 study
was
 conducted
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 Helsinki
 Declaration
 and
 was
approved
 by
 the
 Regional
 Ethical
 Review
 Board
 in
 Uppsala
 (EPN
2014/242/1).
2.2.
 Experimental
 procedure
The
 study
 was
 based
 on
 a
 within-subject
 design,
 meaning
 that
all
 participants
 took
 part
 in
 two
 separate
 experimental
 conditions
(normal
 sleep
 vs.  short
 sleep
 duration),
 each
 of
 which
 lasted
 four
consecutive
 days
 and
 three
 nights
 (day
 and
 night
 1;
 day
 and
 night
2;
 day
 and
 night
 3;
 day
 4)
 in
 our
 sleep
 laboratories
 at
 Uppsala
 Uni-
versity.
 The
 order
 of
 experimental
 conditions
 was
 randomized
 and
counterbalanced
 across
 subjects
 (Fig.
 1).
In
 each
 experimental
 condition,
 upon
 arrival
 at
 5:30
 p.m.
 on
the
 baseline
 day
 (day
 1),
 participants
 were
 provided
 with
 a
standardized
 dinner
 (8
 p.m.),
 and
 were
 then
 prepared
 for
 sleep
polysomnography.
 In
 the
 normal
 sleep
 condition,
 participants
 were
given
 an
 8.5-h
 sleep
 opportunity
 (10:30
 p.m.–7
 a.m.)
 on
 each
 exper-
imental
 day.
 In
 the
 short
 sleep
 condition,
 sleep
 was
 allowed
 for
4.25
 h
 each
 night
 (2:45–7
 a.m.)
 on
 experimental
 days,
 with
 lights
kept
 below
 6
 lx
 at
 eye
 level
 between
 10:30
 p.m.
 and
 2:45
 a.m..
During
 all
 experimental
 wake
 periods,
 i.e.,  when
 sleep
 was
 not
scheduled,
 participants
 were
 allowed
 to
 spend
 their
 time
 with
a
 selection
 of
 movies,
 games,
 and
 books,
 and
 they
 were
 contin-
uously
 monitored
 by
 experimenters.
 On
 each
 experimental
 day,
participants
 were
 provided
 with
 standardized
 meals,
 but
 were
 only
allowed
 to
 drink
 water
 (see
 Fig.
 1).
 The
 sum
 of
 calories
 provided
 by
all
 meals
 on
 each
 experimental
 day
 (except
 for
 the
 first
 day
 where
participants
 arrived
 in
 the
 late
 afternoon)
 corresponded
 to
 individ-
ual
 energy
 requirements
 (based
 on
 the
 Harris-Benedict
 equation
factored
 1.2
 for
 light
 physical
 activity;
 calories
 on
 the
 first
 day
 cor-
responded
 to
 33%
 of
 this
 calculated
 requirement).
 Participants
 were
also
 provided
 with
 three
 supervised
 scheduled
 walks
 on
 day
 2
 and
day
 3
 (daily
 total
 duration
 60
 min);
 otherwise
 they
 were
 confined
to
 their
 rooms
 and
 could
 engage
 in
 sedentary-level
 activities.
 On
day
 4
 (i.e.,
 after
 3
 nights
 of
 either
 short
 or
 normal
 sleep),
 partici-
pants
 were
 kept
 fasted,
 enabling
 the
 investigation
 of
 the
 influence
of
 sleep
 duration
 on
 fasting
 circulating
 concentrations
 of
 endo-
cannabinoids,
 both
 before
 and
 after
 acute
 exercise
 (see
 Section
2.3).
On
 the
 day
 of
 the
 exercise
 intervention
 (day
 4),
 self-reported
hunger
 and
 stress
 were
 measured
 by
 means
 of
 a
 100-mm
 visual
analogue
 scale
 (with
 0
 representing
 “Not
 hungry
 at
 all”/“Not
stressed
 at
 all”
 and
 100
 mm
 representing
 “Very
 hungry”/“Very
stressed”)
 at
 the
 following
 time
 points:
 8:30
 a.m.,
 ∼10
 a.m.,
∼11
 a.m.,
 and
 ∼3
 p.m.
2.3.
 Exercise
 protocol
Exercise
 intensity
 was
 calculated
 prior
 to
 the
 first
 experimental
session
 for
 each
 individual
 by
 using
 a
 step-wise
 increasing
 ergome-
ter
 evaluation
 test
 (the
 Åstrands-Ryhming
 nomogram
 method,
with
 age-adjusting
 correction
 factors;
 Cink
 and
 Thomas,
 1981).
Based
 on
 the
 relationship
 between
 workload
 (in
 Watts),
 and
 heart
rate
 and
 oxygen
 consumption,
 obtained
 during
 this
 test,
 the
 VO2
reserve
 capacity
 was
 calculated
 (which,
 in
 contrast
 to
 VO2 max,
to
 a
 greater
 extent
 takes
 into
 account
 an
 individual’s
 resting
 oxy-
gen
 consumption
 level,
 and
 also
 corresponds
 more
 closely
 to
 heart
rate
 reserve,
 another
 measure
 of
 exercise
 intensity;
 Swain
 and
Leutholtz,
 1997).
 The
 value
 of
 75%
 of
 the
 VO2 reserve
 capacity
was
 then
 converted
 to
 a
 corresponding
 workload
 value
 (in
 Watts),
which
 was
 used
 for
 subsequent
 exercise
 tests
 on
 the
 same
 ergome-
ter.
 The
 ergometer
 evaluation
 test
 took
 place
 1–2
 weeks
 before
 the
first
 session,
 and
 all
 ergometer
 tests
 were
 carried
 out
 on
 a
 standard
stationary
 ergometer
 (Lode
 Corival,
 Intramedic).

The

 protocol
 during

 was
 35
 min
 long,
 and
 consisted
 of
 a
 5-min

 The

 of

 (average

 ±

 and
 was
maintained
 for

 min
 after
 the
 warm-up
 period.
 Preceding
 to
 as
well
 as

 protocol
 on

 4,
 participants
 were
bed-restricted
 and
 could
 only
 engage
 in

 Determination
 of
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
endocannabinoids
Blood
 samples
 were
 taken
 from
 an
 intravenously
 placed
catheter
 at
 five
 different
 time
 points:
 day
 3
 at
 7:30
 p.m.;
 day
 4
at
 8:30
 a.m.,
 ∼10
 a.m.,
 (followed
 by
 the
 35-min
 exercise
 proto-
col),
 ∼15
 min
 and
 ∼4
 h
 after
 the
 end
 of
 the
 exercise
 protocol.
Immediately
 after
 sampling
 with
 EDTA
 collection
 tubes,
 blood
 was
centrifuged
 (4 ◦C,
 10
 min,
 1300g),
 plasma
 was
 removed
 and
 then
frozen
 at
 −80 ◦C.
Plasma
 levels
 of
 2AG
 and
 AEA,
 and
 of
 the
 two
 AEA
 congeners
 [N-
oleoylethanolamine
 (OEA)
 and
 N-palmitoylethanolamine
 (PEA)]
were
 measured
 according
 to
 a
 previously
 described
 method
 (Fanelli
et
 al.,
 2012)
 from
 250-�l
 plasma
 samples.
 Given
 that
 2AG
 is
 chem-
ically
 unstable
 and
 undergoes
 rapid
 isomerization
 to
 1AG,
 we  also
measured
 concentrations
 of
 1AG.
 The
 sum
 of
 1AG
 and
 2AG
 was
therefore
 used
 as
 a
 measure
 of
 biological
 2AG
 levels
 in
 the
 present
study.
Samples
 were
 rapidly
 thawed
 and
 spiked
 with
 deuterated
 inter-
nal
 standards
 before
 being
 extracted
 with
 2
 ml
 of
 toluene
 (Carlo
Erba
 RS
 HPLC
 grade,
 Rodano,
 Italy).
 After
 a
 10-min
 vortex
 and
 cen-
trifugation
 (4 ◦C,
 10
 min,
 2000g),
 samples
 were
 dipped
 for
 5
 min
into
 methanol
 that
 had
 been
 bath
 cooled
 with
 dry
 ice.
 The
 upper
layer
 was
 transferred
 to
 12

 Pyrex
 tubes
 (Bibby
 Scien-
tific,

 and
 dried
 under
 a
 nitrogen
 stream.
Samples
 were
 reconstituted
 with
 100

 MeOH,
 and
 70

 of
 the
resulting

 recorded
 for
 each
 analyte
in
 order
 to
 ensure
 specificity.
 The
 assay
 functional
 sensitivity
 in
plasma
 matrix
 was
 0.039
 pmol/ml
 for
 AEA,
 0.156
 pmol/ml
 for
 2AG
and
 1AG,
 and
 0.390
 pmol/ml
 for
 PEA
 and
 OEA.
As
 previously
 described
 (Fanelli
 et
 al.,
 2012),
 endocannabinoids
levels
 in
 blood
 or
 plasma
 undergo
 a
 rapid
 increase
 in
 a
 time-
dependent
 manner,
 possibly
 because
 they
 are
 released
 by
 blood
cells
 (AEA,
 PEA
 and
 OEA)
 or
 derived
 by
 lipid
 metabolism
 (2AG
 and
1AG).
 In
 order
 to
 minimize
 the
 analytical
 variability
 caused
 by
 this
phenomenon,
 samples
 from
 the
 same
 subject
 were
 processed
 in
the
 same
 batch,
 and
 each
 batch
 included
 two
 replicates
 of
 low
and
 high
 level
 quality
 controls
 (QCs).
 Low
 level
 QCs
 were
 obtained
by

 samples
 derived
 by
 rapid
 blood
 processing
and

 so

 were
 preserved.
 Conversely,
 high
 level
 QCs
 were
 obtained
 by
pooling
 discarded
 plasma
 samples
 kept
 at
 4 ◦C
 for
 48
 h,
 thus
 con-
taining

 levels.
 Each
 QC
 was
 parted
 in
multiple
 individual
 aliquots.
 In
 each
 analytical
 batch,
 QC
 aliquots
were
 strictly
 defrosted
 and
 processed
 as
 unknown
 samples.
 Intra-
batch,
 intra-assay
 and
 inter-assay
 imprecision
 was,
 respectively,
0.5–11.2%,
 2.0–13.9%
 and
 0.6–17.1%
 for
 all
 analytes
 at
 low
 and
 high
level.
2.5.
 Sleep
 assessment
Prior
 to
 the
 first
 experimental
 session,
 participants
 had
 an
overnight
 polysomnography
 in
 our
 sleep
 laboratory
 to
 reduce
 pos-
sible
 bias
 from
 the
 first-night-effect
 on
 sleep
 maintenance
 and
quality
 in
 subsequent
 experimental
 nights
 (see
 also
 Tamaki
 et
 al.,
2016).
 Participants
 were
 considered
 eligible
 for
 inclusion
 into
 the
present
 study
 only
 if
 sleep
 parameters
 during
 their
 adaption
 night
were
 within
 the
 standard
 range
 (e.g.
 sleep
 onset
 latency
 less
 than
30
 min).
 The
 anamnestic
 interview
 prior
 to
 study
 inclusion
 further
ensured
 that
 none
 of
 the
 participants
 reported
 regular
 snoring,
 nor
did
 they
 report
 regular
 excessive
 daytime
 sleepiness,
 and
 finally,
they
 had
 never
 been
 diagnosed
 with
 any
 sleep
 disorder
 or
 psy-
chiatric
 disorder.
 However,
 sleep
 polysomnography
 during
 the
adaption
 night
 was
 not
 performed
 with
 e.g.
 respiratory
 recordings.
Thus,
 although
 unlikely,
 we
 cannot
 completely
 rule
 out
 the
 pos-
sibility
 that
 some
 of
 our
 participants
 may
 have
 suffered
 from
 e.g.
sleep
 disorder
 breathing,
 although
 the
 likelihood
 thereof
 is
 further
reduced
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 only
 studied
 normal-weight,
 young
 and
healthy
 participants.
During
 experiments,
 sleep
 was
 measured
 by
 Embla
 A10
recorders
 (Flaga
 hf,
 Reykjavik,
 Iceland).
 EEG
 signals
 were
 derived
from
 C3,
 C4,
 Fp1,
 Fp2
 and
 referenced
 to
 the
 contralateral
 mastoid.
Sleep
 was
 subsequently
 scored
 by
 an
 experienced
 scorer
 (J.E.B.)
according
 to
 standard
 criteria
 (Silber
 et
 al.,
 2007).
2.6.
 Statistical
 analysis
Repeated
 measures
 ANOVA
 was
 conducted
 to
 investigate
 our
two
 main
 study
 aims:
 (a)
 the
 influence
 of
 recurrent
 short
 sleep
duration
 on
 fasting
 circulating
 concentrations
 of
 endocannabinoids
(within-subject
 factors:
 Sleep
 condition
 and
 Pre/Post-sleep
 →
 day
 3:
7:30
 p.m.,
 day
 4:
 8:30
 a.m.)
 and
 (b)
 whether
 recurrent
 short
 sleep
duration
 would
 alter
 the
 effects
 of
 acute
 physical
 exercise
 on
 circu-
lating
 concentrations
 of
 endocannabinoids
 (within-subject
 factors:
Sleep
 condition
 and
 Exercise
 time
 point
 →
 day
 4:
 ∼10
 a.m.
 (last
 pre-
exercise
 time
 point),
 as
 well
 as
 15
 min
 and
 4
 h
 post-exercise).
Moreover,
 a
 repeated
 measures
 ANOVA
 was
 utilized
 to
 investigate
(c)
 the
 effects
 of
 recurrent
 partial
 sleep
 loss
 vs.
 normal
 sleep
 on
 sub-
jective
 hunger
 and
 stress
 ratings
 on
 day
 4
 (within-subject
 factors:
Sleep
 condition
 and
 Time
 on
 day
 4:
 8:30
 a.m.,
 ∼10
 a.m.,
 ∼11
 a.m.,
 and
∼3
 p.m.).
 The
 Greenhouse–Geisser
 method
 was
 used
 to
 correct
 for
sphericity
 deviations.
 Pearson’s
 correlation
 analysis
 was
 utilized
to
 examine
 putative
 relationships
 between
 circulating
 concentra-
tions
 of
 endocannabinoids
 and
 rating
 scores
 at
 timepoints
 with
coinciding
 blood
 measurements
 and
 subjective
 ratings
 of
 hunger
and
 stress.
Overall,
 two-tailed
 p-values
 below
 0.05
 were
 considered
 signif-
icant.
 Data
 are
 presented
 as

 ±
 standard
 error
 of
 the

(SEM),

 otherwise
 stated.

 Results
3.1.
 Sleep
A
 sleep
 diary
 that
 was
 kept
 by
 the
 participants
 confirmed
 that
average
 self-reported
 sleep
 duration
 in
 the
 week
 before
 the
 start
 of
each
 experimental
 session
 did
 not
 differ
 between
 the
 short
 and
 nor-
mal
 sleep
 conditions
 (range
 7–9
 h
 per
 night;
 p
 >
 0.10,
 as
 determined
by
 a
 paired
 t-test).
In
 the
 normal
 sleep
 condition
 (i.e.,
 where
 subjects
 could
 sleep
for
 8.5
 h
 each
 night),
 the
 polysomnographic
 analysis
 revealed
 that
subjects
 slept
 in
 total
 7.95
 ±
 0.13
 h
 on
 the
 first
 night,
 7.91
 ±
 0.10
 h
on
 the
 second
 night,
 and
 8.02
 ±
 0.10
 h
 on
 the
 third
 night.
 In
 the
short
 sleep
 condition
 (i.e.,
 subjects
 had
 an
 sleep
 opportunity
 of
4.25
 h
 each
 night),
 they
 slept
 in
 total
 3.97
 ±
 0.05

 on
 the

 of
 endocannabinoids
 before
 exercise
In
 the
 morning
 of
 day
 4
 (i.e.,  at
 8:30
 a.m.
 following
 3
 exper-
imental
 nights),
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG
 were
 on
 average
+80%
 higher
 in
 the
 short
 vs.
 normal
 sleep
 condition
 (3.99
 ±

 pmol/ml,
 df
 =

 were,
 however,
 observed
 in

 (i.e.,  fol-
lowing
 2
 experimental
 nights)
 between
 sleep
 conditions
 (p
 =
 0.830,
pairwise

Plasma
 concentrations
 of
 AEA,
 PEA,
 and
 OEA
 did
 not
 differ
between
 the
 sleep
 conditions
 (p

 p
 ≥
 0.423
 for
 all
 interaction
 effects
 of
 Sleep
 condition
 with
Pre/Post-sleep;

 In
 contrast,
 significant
 main
effects
 of
 Pre/Post-sleep
 on
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 AEA
 and
 PEA
were
 found,
 as
 morning
 values
 of
 day
 4
 were
 lower
 than
 those
 mea-
sured
 in
 the
 evening
 before
 (Table

 No
 such
 main

 were,
 however,
 observed
 for
 plasma
 con-
centrations
 of
 OEA
 (p
 =

 Discussion
In
 this

 involving
 16
 healthy
 young
 men,
 we
 aimed
 to
investigate
 if
 recurrent
 short
 sleep
 duration
 over
 three
 consecutive
nights
 would
 alter
 systemic
 concentrations
 of
 endocannabinoids,
both
 prior
 to

 Effects
 of
 sleep
 restriction
 on
 plasma
 1/2AG
 levels
Our
 study
 found
 a
 rise
 in
 plasma
 2AG
 concentrations
 shortly
after
 awakening
 after
 three
 nights
 of
 short
 sleep
 (sleep
 window
2:45–7
 a.m.)
 vs.  normal
 sleep
 (sleep
 window
 22:30
 p.m.–7
 a.m.).
This
 is
 in
 contrast
 to
 results
 from
 a
 recent
 study
 involving
 14
healthy
 young
 adults
 in
 which
 circulating
 concentrations
 of
 2AG
were
 found
 to
 be
 primarily
 increased
 during
 afternoon
 hours
(around
 3
 p.m.)
 following
 four
 nights
 of
 short
 sleep
 (sleep
 win-
dow
 1–5:30
 a.m.)
 vs.
 four
 nights
 of
 normal
 sleep
 (sleep
 window
11
 p.m.–7:30
 a.m.)
 (Hanlon
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Another
 finding
 in
 our
study
 was
 that
 plasma
 2AG
 concentrations
 in
 the
 afternoon
 (around
3
 p.m.)
 returned
 to
 pre-exercise
 values,
 an
 effect
 that
 was
 seen
in
 both
 the
 short
 and
 normal
 sleep
 condition.
 This
 also
 differs
from
 recent
 results
 demonstrating
 that
 plasma
 2AG
 exhibits
 a
distinct
 diurnal
 pattern
 across
 a
 normal
 sleep-wake
 cycle,
 peak-
ing
 in
 early-midafternoon
 (Hanlon
 et
 al.,
 2015).
 Differences
 in
meal
 timing,
 type
 of
 food,
 duration
 of
 fasting,
 and
 gender
 dis-
tribution
 could
 offer
 possible
 explanations
 for
 discrepant
 results
across
 experiments,
 since
 all
 of
 these
 factors
 have
 been
 shown
to
 alter
 endocannabinoid
 production
 (Gatta-Cherifi
 et
 al.,
 2012;
Engeli
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Kirkham
 et
 al.,
 2002;
 Blüher
 et
 al.,
 2006;
 Di
Marzo
 et
 al.,
 2001).
 Additionally,
 differences
 in
 time
 awake
 with
light
 exposure
 in
 the
 morning
 (2-h
 difference
 in
 the
 study
 by
Hanlon
 et
 al.
 (2016)
 compared
 with
 equal
 time
 across
 our
 study
conditions),
 as
 well
 as
 differences
 in
 sleep
 midpoints
 between
the
 sleep
 conditions
 (3:15
 a.m.
 across
 both
 sleep
 conditions
 in
Hanlon
 et
 al.,
 2016;
 2:45
 a.m.
 and
 4:53
 a.m.
 in
 our
 normal
 and
 par-
tial
 sleep
 restriction
 conditions
 herein,
 respectively)
 may
 explain
the
 differing
 results
 observed
 across
 these
 studies.
 Finally,
 phys-
ical
 exercise
 has
 been
 demonstrated
 to
 be
 able
 to
 shift
 circadian
rhythms
 of
 both
 central
 and
 peripheral
 tissues
 (Schroeder
 et

 and

 did

 at

The
 increase
 we
 observed
 in
 plasma
 2AG
 due
 to
 sleep

was
 transient,
 as
 it
 occurred
 shortly
 after

 at

 was
 no

 apparent
 at

 a.m.
 on

 Given
 that
 endo-
cannabinoids
 are
 responsive
 to
 glucocorticoid
 hormones
 (Hill
 et

 and
 mediate
 many
 of
 the
 physiological
 actions
 of
 these

 in

 and
 peripheral
 tissues
 (Bitencourt
 et

 Hill
 et

 an
 elevated
 cortisol

 response
 (CAR)
 following
 partial

 could
 rep-
resent
 a
 mechanism
 underlying
 the
 transient
 increase
 in
 2AG

8:30
 a.m.
 on
 day
 4.
 Supporting
 this
 view,
 a
 recent
 study
 involving
2751

 found
 short
 sleep

 to
 be

 with
an
 increased
 CAR

Thus,
 it

 Effects
 of
 sleep
 restriction
 on
 plasma
 AEA,
 PEA,
 and
 OEA
levels
Plasma
 concentrations
 of
 AEA
 (and
 its
 congeners
 PEA,
 and
 OEA)
did
 not
 differ
 between
 the
 short
 and
 normal
 sleep
 duration
 con-
ditions,
 which
 is
 somehow
 at
 odds
 with
 previous
 findings.
 For
instance,
 in
 a
 study
 involving
 five
 healthy
 humans,
 circulating
AEA
 concentrations
 increased
 from
 nighttime
 to
 morning
 and
 then
declined
 again
 closer
 to
 nighttime
 when
 participants
 were
 kept
under
 a
 normal
 sleep-wake
 cycle.
 In
 contrast,
 this
 pattern
 was
disrupted
 following
 one
 night
 of
 total
 sleep
 deprivation
 (e.g.
 con-
centrations
 of
 plasma
 AEA
 did
 not
 decline
 over
 the
 day),
 indicating
that
 the
 absence
 of
 sleep
 produces
 a
 significant
 dysregulation
 of
 cir-
culating
 AEA
 (Vaughn
 et
 al.,
 2010).
 However,
 others
 have
 reported
that
 total
 sleep
 loss
 did
 not
 alter
 circulating
 AEA
 concentrations
(Koethe
 et
 al.,
 2009),
 whereas
 they
 instead
 found
 increased
 levels
of
 OEA
 in
 CSF
 but
 not
 in
 plasma
 (Koethe
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 The
 latter
finding
 is
 of
 particular
 importance
 for
 the
 interpretation
 of
 our
 null
results,
 as
 it
 suggests
 that
 the
 extent
 by
 which
 sleep
 loss
 alters
endocannabinoid
 signaling
 may
 vary
 across
 tissues
 and/or
 sampled
biological
 fluids.

 Effects
 of
 exercise
 on
 plasma
 endocannabinoid
concentrations
We  found
 that
 exercise
 carried
 out
 in
 the
 fasted
 state
 induced
 a
short-term
 rise
 (15-min
 into
 the
 recovery
 period
 post
 exercise)
 in
plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG,
 whereas
 no
 statistically
 significant
effects
 on
 plasma
 AEA
 concentrations
 were
 found.
 Similar
 effects
have
 been
 found
 after
 acute
 psychological
 stress
 (Hill
 et
 al.,
 2009).
Studies
 utilizing
 acute
 physical
 exercise
 as
 stressor
 have
 however
found
 different
 responses,
 i.e.,  an
 increase
 of
 plasma
 concentrations
of
 AEA
 but
 not
 2AG
 (Heyman
 et
 al.,
 2012;
 Raichlen
 et
 al.,
 2013;
Sparling
 et
 al.,
 2003).
 Differences
 in
 exercise
 intensity,
 circadian
timing
 of
 exercise,
 timing
 of
 blood
 sampling
 (i.e., during
 or
 differ-
ent
 time
 points
 after
 exercise),
 and
 pre-exercise
 conditions
 (e.g.
photic
 preload,
 time
 since
 last
 meal,
 macronutrient
 composition
 of
last
 meal,
 and
 gender
 distribution)
 could
 offer
 possible
 explana-
tions
 for
 why
 we
 observed
 an
 increase
 in
 plasma
 concentrations
of
 2AG
 but
 not
 AEA,
 whereas
 previous
 studies
 found
 exercise
 to
increase
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 AEA
 but
 not
 2AG
 (Heyman
 et
 al.,
2012;
 Raichlen
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 Sparling
 et
 al.,
 2003).
 Another
 consid-
eration
 when
 interpreting
 our
 data
 is
 that
 a
 previous
 study
 found
plasma
 2AG
 concentrations
 to
 increase
 by
 around
 17%
 under
 rest-
ing
 conditions
 from
 10
 a.m.
 to
 11
 a.m.
 (Hanlon
 et
 al.,
 2015),
 i.e.,
corresponding
 to
 the
 time
 period
 during
 which
 we  found
 exer-
cise
 to
 elevate
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG.
 While
 we
 observed
an
 increase
 much
 greater
 (about
 44%)
 than
 this
 observed
 diurnal
fluctuation,
 the
 elevated
 2AG
 levels
 after
 ergometer
 cycling
 may
nevertheless
 partially
 have
 been
 due
 to
 the
 concurrent
 natural
 rise
along
 its
 diurnal
 pattern
 in
 blood.
An
 additional
 finding
 of
 the
 present
 study
 is
 that
 the
 exercise-
induced
 rise
 in
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG
 did
 not
 differ
 between
sleep
 conditions.
 The
 increase
 of
 circulating
 levels
 of
 endocannabi-
noids
 following
 exercise
 has
 been
 proposed
 to
 partially
 account
 for
the
 anxiolytic
 (Tantimonaco
 et
 al.,
 2014),
 anti-nociceptive
 (Galdino
 266
 
J.
 Cedernaes
 et
 al.

 (2016)
 258–268
et
 al.,
 2014)
 and
 neuroprotective
 (Hill
 et
 al.,
 2010a)
 properties
 of
physical
 exercise.
 Indeed,
 recent
 research
 suggests
 that
 at
 least
in
 mice,
 central
 and
 peripheral
 CB1
 and
 CB2
 receptors
 are
 neces-
sary
 for
 inducing
 anxiolysis
 and
 analgesia
 after
 running
 (Fuss
 et
 al.,
2015).
 Our
 results
 could
 therefore
 indirectly
 suggest
 that
 recurrent
partial
 sleep
 loss
 does
 not
 alter
 these
 centrally
 acting
 benefits
 of
exercise.
 Importantly
 however,
 sleep
 deprivation
 may
 have
 mod-
ulated
 post-exercise
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 endocannabinoids
before,
 in
 between,
 or
 after,
 the
 time
 points
 measured
 in
 our
 study,
i.e.,  15
 min
 and
 4
 h
 after
 exercise.
 In
 light
 of
 our
 findings
 that
 par-
tial
 sleep
 loss
 increased
 pre-exercise
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG
only
 at
 8:30
 a.m.
 but
 not
 at
 10
 a.m.,
 differences
 in
 plasma
 endo-
cannabinoid
 concentrations
 between
 sleep
 conditions
 might
 have
occurred
 if
 exercise
 would
 have
 been
 scheduled
 closer
 to
 awaken-
ing.
Finally,
 an
 increase
 of
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 OEA
 (AEA
 con-
gener)
 was
 found
 at
 4
 h
 post-exercise.
 However,
 since
 this
 rise
 in
plasma
 OEA
 occurred
 relatively
 late
 after
 physical
 exercise,
 this
could
 also
 represent
 a
 circadian
 fluctuation,
 rather
 than
 an
 exercise
effect
 –
 the
 circadian
 profile
 of
 this
 endocannabinoid
 has
 how-
ever
 not
 yet
 been
 properly
 defined
 in
 humans.
 Since
 OEA
 has
been
 shown
 to
 activate
 peroxisome
 proliferator-activated
 recep-
tor
 alpha
 (PPAR-alpha)
 (Guzmán
 et
 al.,
 2004),
 a
 major
 regulator
 of
lipid
 metabolism
 that
 is
 activated
 to
 induce
 a
 metabolic
 adaptive
response
 to
 prolonged
 fasting
 (Kersten
 et
 al.,
 1999),
 the
 rise
 of
 this
lipid
 metabolite
 in
 plasma
 could
 also
 stem
 from
 extended
 energy
deprivation,
 exacerbated
 by
 the
 exercise
 intervention.
4.3.
 Sleep
 loss
 increases
 hunger
 feelings:
 possible
 role
 of
 2AG
A
 well-known
 effect
 of
 cannabinoids
 is
 increased
 food
 craving
and
 calorie
 intake
 (Kirkham,
 2009).
 For
 instance,
 intraperitoneal
administration
 of
 rimonabant
 (an
 antagonist
 for
 the
 cannabinoid
receptor
 CB1)
 reduces
 food
 intake
 (Thornton-Jones
 et
 al.,
 2006)
and
 induces
 neuronal
 activation
 in
 several
 hypothalamic
 nuclei
involved
 in
 food
 intake
 regulation,
 such
 as
 the
 paraventricular
nucleus
 (Verty
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 Furthermore,
 administration
 of
 2AG
into
 the
 shell
 of
 the
 nucleus
 accumbens,
 an
 extra-hypothalamic
area
 strongly
 linked
 to
 eating
 motivation
 increases
 food
 intake
(Kirkham
 et
 al.,
 2002).
 With
 these
 findings
 in
 mind,
 it
 could
 there-
fore
 be
 hypothesized
 that
 the
 rise
 in
 plasma
 2AG
 (and
 the
 sum
with
 its
 isomer
 1AG)
 may
 offer
 a
 possible
 molecular
 mechanism
for
 findings
 of
 previous
 studies,
 which
 have
 demonstrated
 that
sleep
 restriction
 increases
 craving
 and
 intake
 of
 food
 during
 morn-
ing
 hours
 (Benedict
 et
 al.,
 2012;
 Cedernaes
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Chapman
et
 al.,
 2013;
 Hogenkamp
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 St-Onge
 et
 al.,
 2011),
 and
 pos-
sibly
 also
 a
 reason
 for
 the
 previously
 observed
 elevated
 risk
 of
 long
term
 weight
 gain
 and
 obesity
 in
 those
 who
 chronically
 suffer
 from
insufficient
 sleep
 (Cappuccio
 et
 al.,
 2008).
 However,
 three
 nights
of
 partial
 sleep
 loss
 increased
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG
 only
shortly
 after
 awakening
 in
 the
 present
 study
 (i.e.,
 8:30
 a.m.),
 which
is
 therefore
 not
 likely
 to
 represent
 the
 main
 mechanism
 that
 pro-
motes
 overeating
 across
 24-h
 in
 sleep-deprived
 people
 (St-Onge
et
 al.,
 2011)
 –
 unless
 it
 is
 able
 to
 produce
 a
 more
 long-lasting
effect
 at
 the
 behavioral
 or
 energy
 homeostasis
 level.
 Supporting
 the
notion
 of
 a
 more
 short-term
 effect
 of
 elevated
 endocannabinoids,
no
 correlations
 were
 found
 between
 plasma
 endocannabinoid
 con-
centrations
 and
 subjective
 hunger
 ratings.
4.4.
 Acute
 sleep
 loss
 reduces
 subjective
 stress:
 possible
 role
 of
 2AG
An
 additional
 observation
 of
 our
 study
 is
 that
 participants
 gen-
erally
 felt
 less
 stressed
 following
 three
 nights
 of
 short
 sleep
 vs.
normal
 sleep,
 particularly
 following
 the
 physical
 exercise
 proto-
col.
 While
 chronic
 sleep
 loss
 has
 been
 associated
 with
 increased
psychological
 stress
 (Akerstedt,
 2006),
 acute
 sleep
 deprivation
 –
foremost
 total
 sleep
 deprivation
 –
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 exert
 tran-
sient
 mood-improving
 effects
 (Wu  et
 al.,
 1999).
 Given
 that
 low
doses
 of
 CB1
 agonists
 tend
 to
 be
 anxiolytic
 and
 high
 doses
 tend
 to
increase
 aversion
 and
 anxiety-related
 behaviors
 (Ganon-Elazar
 and
Akirav,
 2012;
 also
 reviewed
 in
 Viveros
 et
 al.,
 2005),
 it
 could
 be
 that
the
 small
 but
 significant
 increase
 in
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 2AG
shortly
 after
 awakening
 may
 have
 mediated
 the
 subjective
 stress-
reducing
 effects
 of
 short
 sleep
 duration.
 It
 must
 however
 be
 kept
in
 mind
 that
 we
 did
 not
 find
 any
 correlations
 between
 subjective
stress
 and
 plasma
 concentrations
 of
 endocannabinoids.
 Moreover,
caution
 is
 warranted
 before
 concluding
 based
 on
 our
 findings
 that
humans
 can
 cope
 better
 with
 stressors
 under
 conditions
 of
 acute
sleep
 loss.
 For
 instance,
 there
 is
 some
 evidence
 that
 humans
 are
more
 responsive
 to
 the
 effects
 of
 psychological
 stress
 when
 sleep-
deprived
 compared
 to
 when
 they
 are
 well-rested
 (Cedernaes
 et
 al.,
2015b;
 Minkel
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 Finally,
 sleep
 restriction
 has
 also
 been
shown
 to
 promote
 adverse
 psychological
 symptoms
 (Roy-Byrne
et
 al.,
 1986).
5.
 Conclusions
Given
 that
 activation
 of
 the
 endocannabinoid
 system
 has
 been
previously
 shown
 to
 increase
 acutely
 appetite
 and
 mood
 (Di
 Marzo
et
 al.,
 2001;
 Lutz
 et
 al.,
 2015),
 our
 results
 could
 suggest
 that
 behav-
ioral
 effects
 of
 acute
 sleep
 loss,
 such
 as
 increased
 hunger
 and
transiently
 improved
 psychological
 state,
 may
 partially
 result
 from
activation
 of
 this
 signaling
 pathway.
 In
 contrast,
 exercise-induced
elevations
 of
 endocannabinoids
 appear
 to
 be
 less
 affected
 by
 short
sleep
 duration.
 Whether
 our
 findings
 are
 generalizable
 to
 females,
older
 participants,
 or
 obese
 humans
 living
 under
 short
 sleep
 con-
ditions,
 or
 whether
 similar
 results
 would
 be
 seen
 if
 exercise
 would
have
 been
 carried
 out
 following
 an
 energy
 preload,
 is
 currently
unknown
 and
 would
 be
 worth
 investigating.
