Stimulant drugs acutely increase dopamine neurotransmission in the brain, and chronic use leads to neuroadaptive changes in
the mesolimbic dopamine system and morphological changes in basal ganglia structures. Little is known about the mechanisms
underlying these changes but preclinical evidence suggests that iron, a coenzyme in dopamine synthesis and storage, may be
a candidate mediator. Iron is present in high concentrations in the basal ganglia and stimulant drugs may interfere with iron
homeostasis. We hypothesised that morphological brain changes in cocaine addiction relate to abnormal iron regulation in
the brain and periphery. We determined iron concentration in the brain, using quantitative susceptibility mapping, and in the
periphery, using iron markers in circulating blood, in 44 patients with cocaine addiction and 44 healthy controls. Cocaine-addicted
individuals showed excess iron accumulation in the globus pallidus, which strongly correlated with duration of cocaine use, and
mild iron deficiency in the periphery, which was associated with low iron levels in the red nucleus. Our findings show that iron
dysregulation occurs in cocaine addiction and suggest that it arises consequent to chronic cocaine use. Putamen enlargement in
these individuals was unrelated to iron concentrations, suggesting that these are co-occurring morphological changes that may
respectively reflect predisposition to, and consequences of cocaine addiction. Understanding the mechanisms by which cocaine
affects iron metabolism may reveal novel therapeutic targets, and determine the value of iron levels in the brain and periphery as
biomarkers of vulnerability to, as well as progression and response to treatment of cocaine addiction.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroscientific research in stimulant drug addiction has greatly
advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of addiction.
Although these advances have not yet translated into more
effective treatments or prevention strategies, they have clearly
demonstrated that addiction is a brain disorder.1 Critical to this
has been accumulating evidence of the association of morpho-
logical brain changes with stimulant drug addiction, the most
robust of these being the enlargement of the putamen, which is
frequently seen in stimulant-addicted individuals.2–8 Preclinical
animal models have shown that this abnormality is caused by
drug effects, as the stimulant-induced decline in dopamine D2
receptors in the ventral striatum is directly linked with the volume
increase in the dorsal striatum (putamen).9 This is thought to
reflect
a
hypothesized
ventral-to-dorsal
progression
in
the
behavioural shift from voluntary drug use to compulsive drug-
taking10 and increased putamen volume may thus reflect a neural
substrate of the transition to addiction. However, as it has also
been observed in unaffected first-degree relatives of stimulant-
addicted individuals5 and in patients with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD),11 putamen enlargement may partly represent a
predisposing factor for compulsive behaviours.
Although these morphological brain changes in addiction
have been well-characterized, the mechanisms by which stimulant
drugs, whose primary pharmacological effect is to increase
dopamine transmission, result in such changes remains unknown.
One potential candidate mediator may be iron, which has a vital
role in a many physiological processes, including in the synthesis
of dopamine by providing energy for dopamine metabolism and
storage.12 Given the pivotal role that iron plays in both health and
disease, its metabolism is very tightly regulated. As an essential
micronutrient, iron must be obtained from the diet and cannot be
excreted (except by blood loss). Iron homeostasis is particularly
critical in the brain because excess iron can result in neuronal
death through the production of reactive oxygen species,13 and
iron deficiency will impair dopamine synthesis and monoamine
metabolism.14 Homeostasis is thus carefully controlled through
various, highly complex transport systems and feedback loops.15,16
Disruptions in the regulation of iron may therefore occur at
various levels, resulting in a variety of different pathologies,
prominent among which are neurodegenerative disorders.17,18
Critical to the regulation of iron is the blood–brain barrier,
which decouples iron levels in the periphery from the brain. Iron
enters the brain as diferric transferrin (Tf) via the transferrin
receptors (TfR1) and the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1).19
The transmembrane protein ferroportin 1 transports iron from the
luminal to the abluminal side of a cell,16,20 where it is stored as a
ferritin, mainly in the oligodendrocytes but also in microglia and

 astrocytes.21 As the brain is one of the most metabolically active
organs in the body, its demand for iron generally exceeds the rate
of transferrin uptake, which means that the shortfall has to be
covered from internal storage.22 To ensure that the internal
storage is able to meet the demand, even in the event of
inflammation or hypoxia, iron transport in brain parenchyma is
regulated by the peptide hepcidin.20,23 The regional distribution of
iron in the brain is, however, not equal. Dopamine-rich brain
regions like the basal ganglia are particularly susceptible to iron
deposition, but the factors determining the regional distribution
of iron remain elusive.12
Several lines of evidence suggest a dysregulation of iron
homeostasis in stimulant drug addiction. First, regular use of
stimulant drugs increases the permeability of the blood–brain
barrier, allowing more iron to enter the brain parenchyma.13,24
Second, in animal models stimulant exposure has been shown to
be associated with iron deposition in the basal ganglia mainly in
oligodendrocytes.25
Third,
stimulant
drugs
impair
innate
immunity,26 rendering chronic stimulant users vulnerable to
infection and chronic inflammation,27 disrupting peripheral iron
homeostasis by reducing iron absorption or heam synthesis, and
this is reflected by reduced serum iron and transferrin saturation.28
Finally, chronic stimulant drug use may change dietary prefer-
ences, particularly towards fatty foods,29–31 thereby affecting iron
absorption due to lack of iron transporter and bioavailability.
We hypothesised that cocaine addiction is associated with
disruptions in iron regulation, as reflected by increased iron
concentration in the brain and reduced iron levels in the blood.
We therefore sought to determine iron concentration in the brain,
using quantitative susceptibility mapping,32 and in the periphery,
using markers in circulating blood, in patients with cocaine
addiction and age-matched healthy control volunteers. We
predicted that increased levels of brain iron would be associated
with the duration of cocaine use and basal ganglia volume in the
cocaine-addicted patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sample and procedures
We recruited 44 individuals (95% male) with a chronic history of cocaine
use, meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria for cocaine dependence, and 44
matched healthy control volunteers (93% male) without a history of drug
or alcohol dependence. The diagnosis of cocaine dependence was
ascertained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and these
individuals are subsequently referred to as cocaine use disorder (CUD).
None of the control participants had ever met DSM-IV-TR criteria for
substance dependence; for further details see Supplementary Material. All
participants provided written informed consent before they underwent a
medical review and psychiatric screening. Exclusion criteria included major
medical or neurological illness, lifetime history of a psychotic disorder,
history of a traumatic head injury, or any contra-indications to MR-
scanning. Dietary iron intake was calculated from the Food Frequency
Questionnaire (http://www.srl.cam.ac.uk/epic/nutmethod/FFQ.shtml). Diet-
related variations in iron absorption were estimated using the algorithms
developed by Hallberg and Hulthen.33 All participants provided blood
samples for the analysis of iron proteins in serum (that is, ferritin, iron,
transferrin), hepcidin-25, acute inflammation (that is, C-reactive protein
(CRP)) and haematological status. This study was approved by the National
Research Ethics Committee (12/EE/0519; PI: KDE).
Neuroimaging data acquisition
All participants underwent magnetic resonance brain scans at the Wolfson
Brain Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge (UK) using a 3T Siemens
Magnetom
Tim-Trio
scanner.
T1-weighted
images
(MPRAGE)
and
susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) were acquired for all participants.
Brain scans were screened for normal radiological appearance by
neuroradiologists. Scanning data from one control participant and three
CUD patients were removed due to poor quality, leaving a total of 84
participants (43 controls, 41 CUD). Detailed neuroimaging methods are
provided in the Supplementary Material.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using a five-step strategy, as outlined below, and
described fully in Supplementary Material. All statistical tests were two-
tailed. In light of the multiple statistical tests, we applied a more stringent
P-value, by dividing the initial P-threshold (0.05) by 10, resulting in a
threshold of Po0.005. However, as this was an exploratory analysis, results
reaching the Po0.05 threshold are also reported, though not referred to
as significant in the discussion.
1. Demographics, clinical data and peripheral iron markers were examined
in SPSS (v21) using independent-sample t-tests or Mann–Whitney
U-tests. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were used for categorical data.
2. At whole brain level, gray matter volume comparisons were conducted
on the MPRAGE images using FSL-VBM and CamBA for permutation
testing. Quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM), a validated measure of
brain iron concentration,32 were reconstructed from SWI data.34 Briefly,
multi-channel complex data were combined using a modified adaptive
algorithm.35 The combined phase images were unwrapped with a
continuous Laplacian approach,36 and the local field was revealed
through global extraction of the background field with spherical mean
value filtering.37 QSM was estimated with the morphology-enabled,
non-linear dipole inversion method,38 and the maps were warped into a
study-wise space with a previously described processing stream34 using
ANTs (v2.1). Finally, FSL Randomize (v2.9) was used for QSM statistical
analysis (Figure 1).
3. Regions-of-interest (ROIs) were defined for nine iron-rich structures,
which were manually traced on the QSM group template (Figure 2). In
addition, to directly compare QSM in the putamen and globus pallidus
(GP) against gray matter probabilities in the putamen, we applied an
automated, reproducible algorithm for subcortical segmentation to the
MPRAGE template using FSL-FIRST (Figures 3 and 4). Mean and median
values for each ROI were imported into SPSS for group comparison and
correlational analyses.
4. Correlational analyses were performed separately in each group to
examine the relationships between iron concentration in both brain and
periphery, with brain structure, age and duration of cocaine use.
5. Predictors of iron concentration in the GP were examined using a
multiple regression model in SPSS with DSM-IV drug dependency
status, smoking status, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation included
as predictor variables.
RESULTS
Demographics and peripheral iron markers
The two groups were matched in terms of age, gender,
handedness, body mass, and alcohol consumption (Table 1). The
groups did not differ on vital signs, indicating that CUD patients
were not acutely intoxicated.
The estimated iron absorption calculated from dietary iron
intake did not differ between CUD and controls (t81 = − 0.02,
P = 0.988). CUD patients had significantly lower serum iron levels
than controls and significantly higher levels of the acute-phase
reactants CRP and ferritin, indicative of inflammation (Table 1).
Levels

transferrin
(iron

and

deficiency.
Ferritin
concentration
was
correlated
with
hepcidin levels in controls (r = 0.40, P = 0.008) and less strongly
in CUD (r = 0.38, P = 0.016), suggesting that in patients the increase
in ferritin may also be related to inflammation and other factors.
The haematological profile in CUD patients further indicates mild
iron deficiency with a microcytic blood picture (Table 1).
Gray matter volume and brain iron concentration
Compared with the control group, gray matter volume at whole
brain level was significantly increased in CUD in the putamen and
the cerebellum, and significantly reduced in the insula, orbito-
frontal, medial frontal, anterior cingulate and temporoparietal
cortices (Figure 1a). Similarly, comparison of voxel-wise iron

 concentration (as indexed by QSM) at whole brain level, are shown
in Figure 1b.
The ROI analysis showed significantly higher QSM concentration
in CUD patients compared with controls in both segments of the
GP (internal (GPi): t82 = − 2.88, P = 0.005 and external (GPe):
t82 = − 4.05, Po0.001). CUD patients also had reduced QSM in
the red nucleus (t82 = − 2.14, P = 0.036; Figure 2a), but this finding
did not survive the more stringent threshold of Po0.005, which
we
applied
due
to
multiple
statistical
testing
(see
also
Supplementary Table S1).
To evaluate whether the increased putamen volume in CUD
patients was associated with iron concentration in this region,
correlations between gray matter volume and QSM were examined
separately in both groups using (Figure 4, Supplementary Table
S2). As putamen volume is expected to decrease with age (in
contrast to QSM, which increases with age),39 age effects were
also examined. In controls, putamen gray matter volume was
significantly negatively correlated with QSM (r = − 0.53, Po0.001)
and age (r = − 0.37, P = 0.015) but these relationships were not
seen in CUD (QSM: r = − 0.13, P = 0.416; age: r = 0.05, P = 0.770). In
both groups, putamen volume was also unrelated to QSM in the
GP, and was not associated with the duration of cocaine use
(r = 0.19, P = 0.229).
There were no group differences with respect to GP or caudate
volume, and no significant volume — QSM relationships in the GP
(Supplementary Material).
Brain iron accumulation as a function of age and cocaine use
Consistent with prior work in healthy ageing,34,40 in controls iron
concentration was correlated with age in the putamen (r = 0.67,
Po0.001), red nucleus (r = 0.64, Po0.001), substantia inominata
(r = 0.49, P = 0.001), substantia nigra (r = 0.48, P = 0.001), motor
cortex (r = 0.43, P = 0.005), and caudate nucleus (r = 0.39, P = 0.010).
However, in CUD patients, these correlations were only seen in the
motor cortex (r = 0.44, P = 0.005) and substantia nigra (r = 0.43,
P = 0.005), suggesting that the pattern of iron accumulation with
normal ageing is altered in cocaine addiction.
As shown in Figure 2b, the duration of cocaine use correlated
strongly with QSM in the GPe (r = 0.49, P = 0.001), the substantia
nigra (r = 0.34, P = 0.028) and dentate nucleus (r = 0.33, P = 0.034),
but not in the GPi (r = 0.28, P = 0.069). QSM in the red nucleus was
significantly correlated with low transferrin saturation in CUD
patients (r = 0.54, Po0.001, Figure 2c) but not in controls (r = -0.08,
P = 0.628). Only in the dentate nucleus was QSM correlated with
transferrin saturation in both groups (CUD: r = 0.43, P = 0.005,
controls: r = 0.31, P = 0.045). For further details, see Supplementary
Material.
Predictors of iron accumulation in the GP
Multiple regression revealed that a third of the variance (34%) of
QSM in the GPe was explained by drug dependency (R2 = 0.34;
F7,74 = 5.1832, Po0.001), with cocaine dependence (β = 0.57,
P = 0.036) and the absence of opiate dependence (β = − 0.47,
P = 0.001) being the strongest predictors in the model. For the GPi,
the same model explained only 18% of the variance of QSM
(R2 = 0.18; F7,74 = 2.27, P = 0.038) with the absence of opiate
dependence being the only significant predictor (β = − 0.37,
P = 0.018); see Supplementary Material for details.
Given the strong negative relationship with opiate dependence,
the CUD group was divided post hoc into two subgroups with and
without comorbid opiate dependence (CUD+O, n = 27; CUD − O,
n = 14). There were no significant demographic differences
between the CUD-subgroups. As shown in Figure 3b, one-way
ANOVA revealed significant group differences in QSM in GPe
(F2,81 = 13.21, Po0.001) such that QSM was increased in both
CUD-subgroups compared with controls (both Tukey’s Po0.05)
and significantly increased in CUD − O compared with CUD+O
(P = 0.013). As shown in Figures 3d and e, the duration of cocaine
use was significantly correlated with QSM in CUD+O (r = 0.48,
P = 0.017) and in CUD − O (r = 0.54, P = 0.047) (Fisher’s z-score = −
0.34, P = 0.737). The group effect in QSM in the GPi (F2,81 = 6.87,
P = 0.002) was driven by significantly higher levels of QSM in
CUD − O compared with controls (P = 0.001). Differences between
CUD+O and controls (P = 0.253) and CUD+O and CUD − O

 (P = 0.070) were non-significant (Figure 3c). No relationships were
found between QSM in GPi and the duration of cocaine use or the
duration of opiate use (Supplementary Material).
DISCUSSION
We demonstrate for, we believe, the first time in humans that
chronic cocaine use is associated with excessive iron accumulation
in the brain, which is localised to the GP and correlates strongly
with the duration of regular cocaine use, but is unrelated to GP
volume. We further report a significant reduction in serum levels of
transferrin-bound iron (transferrin saturation), which was associated
with low iron concentration in the red nucleus. These findings
suggest that iron regulation is disrupted in cocaine addiction.
Although we replicated the established findings of putamen
enlargement in CUD, we did not find supporting evidence for this
being related to iron accumulation either in the GP or the putamen,
suggesting that both are separate, co-occurring morphological
changes in cocaine addiction (Supplementary Table S3).
Iron accumulation in the GP: a putative consequence of cocaine
exposure?
Excessive brain iron accumulation is a recognised pathological
change in neurodegenerative diseases and conditions caused by
inherited abnormalities of iron metabolism, but not one that has
been described previously in cocaine addiction. Indeed, the
highly localized iron accumulation in the GP in CUD patients is
reminiscent of the ‘eye of the tiger’ sign on T2-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging in pantothenate kinase-associated neuro-
degeneration (formerly Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome); a rare,
rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with childhood
onset and prominent extrapyramidal symptoms. This condition is
characterised by disturbances of systemic iron metabolism caused
by mutations in the PANK2 gene.41 It thus demonstrates a clear
link between iron dysregulation, basal ganglia dysfunction and
excessive iron accumulation selectively in the GP, which may be
very relevant to understanding our finding in CUD, though
the precise mechanisms of how this arises and relates to the
progression of the clinical syndrome remain to be determined.
High

in
the
oligodendrocytes in dopamine-rich basal ganglia structures, the
highest being in the GABAergic interneurons of the GP. Although
the GP itself is not a dopamine-rich structure, its function within
the basal ganglia network is, however, dependent on dopaminer-
gic inputs.42–44 Unlike other regions such as the putamen, which
accumulate iron slowly but steadily throughout the lifespan, iron
concentration in the GP increases rapidly during the first two
decades of life (when iron is essential for growth and myelination),

in QSM of 13% in the red nucleus; however, the 12% reduction in the putamen was non-significant (for statistical details see Supplementary
Material). (b) Excessive iron accumulation in the GPe in CUD patients was significantly associated with the duration of cocaine use. (c) The

 and then begins to plateau around the age of 30 years.21 GP iron
concentration in our CUD group not only exceeded that of age-
matched healthy volunteers (mean age 40 years), but also
correlated strongly with the duration of cocaine use (Figure 2).
Preclinical work in monkeys has shown a similarly selective
increase in iron concentration in the GP following exposure to
methamphetamine, at a magnitude 2.5 times that in control
animals.25 In humans, bilateral GP infarction is a common
symptom of cocaine overdose.45–47 Taken together, these findings
suggest that this excess iron accumulation in the GP is a regionally
specific effect of stimulant drug exposure.
Mechanisms and functional implications of excess iron
accumulation in the GP
Evidence from animal models and human studies revealed that
the stimulant-induced iron increase in the GP occurs with a delay
of up to 18 months after exposure.25 Although iron accumulation
has primary been regarded as a dopamine-driven mechanism,48
this abnormal iron increase in the GP appears to reflect
compensatory GABAergic adaptations to excessive stimulant-
induced dopaminergic excitation in the striatum.49,50 However,
the putative involvement of GABA and glutamate in iron
homeostasis50 might also play a role in this process. Though iron
concentrations in CUD patients were significantly increased in
both segments of the GP, they were only related to the duration of
cocaine use in the GPe. This cocaine-related iron accumulation
further appeared to be attenuated by comorbid opiate addiction
(Figure 3); a finding that requires further investigation. Consistent
with previous work,51 the majority of our CUD+O reported using
heroin in particular to alleviate cocaine-induced over-excitability
and to enhance their control over their cocaine use. Whether
these experiences are related to the attenuated iron increase in
the GP remains to be determined.
The GPe and the subthalamic nucleus form the so-called
indirect striatal pathway,52 which has been hypothesized to act as
‘brake’ for inhibiting ongoing behaviour53 and to mediate learning
of
aversive
outcomes54,55—functions
that
are
substantially
impaired in stimulant-dependent individuals.56,57 Owing to its
‘strategic location’, the GPe has been suggested to exert a
powerful inhibitory control on basal ganglia output structures,58
which are implicated in habit learning and automaticity.59 The
indirect striatocortical pathway is thought to be modulated via
striatal dopamine receptor type 2 function, which has been shown
to decline following repeated stimulant drug exposure9,60 and to
underlie to compulsive drug-taking in addicted individuals.61,62
Intriguingly, selective damage of the GP has repeatedly been
associated
with
compulsive
behaviours
unrelated
to
drug
taking,63–65 it is thus conceivable that GP dysfunction contributes
to disruptions in the balance between goal-directed and habitual
action control that characterises cocaine addiction.10 However,
despite existing histological evidence of the stimulant-induced
increase
in
the
GP25
and
preliminary
preclinical
evidence
suggesting that an imbalance between direct and indirect striatal
pathway activity might mediate the transition to addiction,66 the
underlying mechanisms and functional effects of iron dyregula-
tion on addictive behaviour require further investigation.
Iron dysregulation in the periphery in cocaine addiction
We found evidence of dysregulation of peripheral iron metabolism
in our CUD sample with significantly reduced levels of iron and

iron concentration in the GPe revealed significant differences between the groups, such that QSM levels in CUD patients with comorbid
opiate dependence fell midway between the levels seen in healthy volunteers and CUD patients without comorbid opiate dependence. (c)
Iron concentration in the GPi differed significantly between the groups, which was driven by significantly increased QSM in CUD patients
without opiate dependence compared with healthy control volunteers. (Error bars denote s.e.m., **P o 0.005 and *P o 0.05). (d, e) In both
CUD subgroups, excessive iron accumulation in the GPe was associated with the duration of cocaine use, supporting the notion that chronic
cocaine use is implicated in the observed pathology. No relationships were observed between iron concentration in the GPi and the duration
of cocaine use or with the duration of opiate use (for statistical details see text and Supplementary Material). CUD, cocaine use disorder; GPe,

 transferrin saturation (Table 1). Given that transferrin is the major
iron transporter protein, one would anticipate increased rather
than decreased transferrin saturation in mild iron deficiency.
However, during acute inflammation (as reflected by increased
CRP levels, and abnormal eosinophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil
counts), ferritin levels may increase disproportionately due to
hepatic ferritin production, while iron release remains propor-
tionate to the cellular ferritin content, resulting in low transferrin
saturation as seen in the present study. The rather modest
increase in ferritin during inflammation in CUD patients further
supports the notion of peripheral iron dysregulation.
As iron crosses the blood–brain barrier bound to transferrin,67
the correlation between peripheral transferrin saturation and low
iron levels in the red nucleus in CUD patients also concurs with the
notion of peripheral iron deficiency (Figure 2c). In conditions of
iron overload, the exact opposite pattern has been reported,
namely excessive iron accumulation in the red nucleus and
increased transferrin saturation in the periphery.68
A possible mediating role of peripheral inflammation in central
iron accumulation?
Given that we see elevated serum CRP and ferritin levels in the
CUD, it may be that inflammation is a mediator of the increased
iron brain iron concentration. Although we found no significant
correlations between CRP levels and QSM, this does not rule out
this possibility, as QSM cannot separately detect the ferritin L-
isoform, which is associated with inflammation. Ferritin has two
dominant
isoforms,
light
polypeptide
(L-ferritin)
and
heavy
polypeptide (H-ferritin). H-ferritin has a critical regulatory role in
iron metabolism, whereas the physically more stable L-ferritin is
more involved in iron storage of iron.69 H-ferritin is involved
myelination and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)70 and predomi-
nates in the young adult brain. However with aging, L-ferritin
levels in the brain increase with the accumulation of myelin debris
and the breakdown of neuromelalin,13 and L-ferritin is thought to
play a critical role in neurodegeneration.69 To examine the
association between iron accumulation in the brain and inflam-
mation, it is necessary to specifically measure L-ferritin, which is
not possible at present with QSM, and this remains an important
area of future research.
Putamen enlargement is unrelated to iron levels
Though we replicated the finding of putamen enlargement in
chronic stimulant drug users2–8 in our CUD group, we did not find
supporting
evidence
for
relationships
between
volumetric
changes and abnormal iron concentration. Despite the group
differences in putamen volume, iron concentration in the puta-
men did not significantly differ between the two groups (Figure 4).
However, unlike the control group, CUD patients showed no
correlation between putamen iron and age. Clearly, the pattern
seen in CUD does not seem to accord with either a normal
ageing39 or a neurodegenerative picture.71 Given that enlarge-
ment of the putamen has also been observed in their unaffected
biological siblings,5 it likely represents a vulnerability factor to,
rather than a consequence of, cocaine addiction.
Strengths and weaknesses
The strengths of the study are its methodology, the simultaneous
examination of central and peripheral iron and the relatively large
sample size. For the measurements of brain iron QSM has proven

 superior to R2,40 and has been cross-validated against both other
MR techniques and post-mortem iron measurements.32 Although
QSM primarily indexes iron concentration, it might also capture
other processes such as lower myelin levels,72,73 it remains unclear
to what extent such alterations might have a role in CUD and in the
present results. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, the
lack of behavioural assessments and the absence of measures iron
absorption/transport, such as DMT1 and ferroportin (particularly
iron absorption through gut mucosa), which would help determine
the specific disruptions in iron regulation in CUD patients.
Implications and outlook
Over the last three decades there has been a major conceptual
shift in our understanding of drug addiction, from simply being a
behavioural problem to a brain disorder.1,74 There have also been
significant advances in addressing the basic question of causality,
namely as to whether the observed brain changes in addicted
individuals were causal or consequential to drug addiction.
However, we know surprisingly little about the neurobiological
mechanisms by which stimulant drugs interact with vulnerability
factors leading to the observed neuropathology. In this study, we
provide first evidence of a potential mechanism, which seems to
arise consequent to cocaine exposure, namely the dysregulation
of iron metabolism. Future research is warranted to identify the
precise mechanisms by which stimulant drugs interact with
iron regulation, that is, changing the permeability of the
blood-brain-barrier,
altering
intracellular
iron
trafficking,
or
disrupting cellular iron management. Another possibility that
requires further exploration is the role of peripheral inflammation
in CUD, and its contributory or mediating role in iron accumula-
tion in the brain, given the growing evidence of inflammatory
conditions affecting iron homeostasis through a process of
translational regulation of ferritin.75
The demonstration of iron dysregulation in cocaine addiction
raises several important questions including, how this develops
over time, whether iron deficiency increases the vulnerability to
developing stimulant addiction, contributes to the persistence of
the disorder, or leads to the long-term sequelae such as accelerated
brain ageing and behavioural and motor rigidity that continue in
recovery. These will require longitudinal studies to evaluate the
temporal course and stability of imbalances in iron regulation, and
relate them to other key aspects of the illness. A more critical question
that follows from the above is whether impaired iron regulation
might be a biomarker of disease progression or a therapeutic
target for cocaine addiction, either through addressing peripheral
iron deficiency to modify disease course, or by slowing or
reversing the central accumulation of iron. Given that stimulant
addiction remains a significant public health problem associated
with considerable harm and morbidity, with few pharmacological
treatments and only modestly successful psychosocial treatments,
elucidating this mechanism may offer the possibility of developing
some much needed new interventions.
