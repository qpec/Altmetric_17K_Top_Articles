Robust classification of bacterial and viral infections via
integrated host gene expression diagnostics
Timothy E. Sweeney,1,2* Hector R. Wong,3,4 Purvesh Khatri1,2*
Improved diagnostics for acute infections could decrease morbidity and mortality by increasing early antibiotics for
patients with bacterial infections and reducing unnecessary antibiotics for patients without bacterial infections. Sev-
eral groups have used gene expression microarrays to build classifiers for acute infections, but these have been
hampered by the size of the gene sets, use of overfit models, or lack of independent validation. We used multicohort
analysis to derive a set of seven genes for robust discrimination of bacterial and viral infections, which we then vali-
dated in 30 independent cohorts. We next used our previously published 11-gene Sepsis MetaScore together with the
new bacterial/viral classifier to build an integrated antibiotics decision model. In a pooled analysis of 1057 samples
from 20 cohorts (excluding infants), the integrated antibiotics decision model had a sensitivity and specificity for bac-
terial infections of 94.0 and 59.8%, respectively (negative likelihood ratio, 0.10). Prospective clinical validation will be
needed before these findings are implemented for patient care.
INTRODUCTION
Early and accurate diagnosis of infection is key to improving patient
outcomes and reducing antibiotic resistance. The mortality rate of bac-
terial sepsis increases by 8% for each hour by which antibiotics are
delayed (1); however, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics to pa-
tients without bacterial infections increases rates of morbidity and anti-
microbial resistance. The rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in
the hospital setting is estimated at 30 to 50% and would be decreased by
improved diagnostics (2, 3). In broader use, up to 95% of outpatients given
antibiotics for suspected enteric fever have negative cultures (4). There is
currently no gold standard point-of-care diagnostic that can broadly deter-
mine the presence and type of infection. Thus, the White House has
established the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant
Bacteria, which called for “point-of-need diagnostic tests to distinguish
rapidly between bacterial and viral infections” (5).
Although new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based molecular
diagnostics can profile pathogens directly from a blood culture (6), such
methods rely on the presence of adequate numbers of pathogens in the
blood. Moreover, they are limited to detecting a discrete range of patho-
gens. As a result, there is a growing need for molecular diagnostics that
profile the host gene response. These include diagnostics that can dis-
tinguish the presence of infection as compared to inflammation in the
absence of infection, such as our 11-gene “Sepsis MetaScore” (SMS) (7),
which has been validated across multiple cohorts (8), among others (9, 10).
Other groups have focused on gene sets that can distinguish between
types of infections, such as bacterial versus viral infections (11–13);
however, these gene sets often contain too many genes to translate into
a useful clinical tool. Tsalik et al. described a model that distinguishes
among all three groups—noninfected patients and those with bacterial
or viral illness—but this model required the measurement of 122 probes,
presenting an implementation challenge (14). Similarly, we have de-
scribed a “meta-virus signature” that describes a common response to
viral infection but contained too many genes (396) for clinical application
(15). Overall, although great promise has been shown in this field, no
pragmatic infection diagnostic based on host gene expression has yet
made it into clinical practice.
The data from these biomarker studies and dozens of other genome-
wide expression studies in sepsis and acute infections have been pub-
lished and deposited for further study in public databases such as the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) ArrayExpress. These
data are a largely untapped resource that can be used for both biomarker
discovery and validation. We have previously shown that our integrated
multicohort analysis of gene expression produces robust diagnostic tools
for organ transplant (16), sepsis (7), specific types of viral infections (15),
and active tuberculosis (17). Furthermore, these data are also useful as a
benchmarking and validation tool for new host gene expression diag-
nostics. However, such validation using public data has previously been
limited to only those cohorts that contain at least two classes of interest
(those in which a direct comparison between classes is possible), because
interstudy technical differences preclude direct comparison of diagnostic
scores between cohorts.
Here, we sought to improve the diagnostic power of the SMS by
adding the ability to discriminate bacterial from viral infections. Thus,
to derive an improved biomarker for discriminating infection types, we
applied our multicohort analysis framework to clinical microarray co-
horts that compared the host response to bacterial and viral infections.
We further developed a method to conormalize gene expression data
among multiple cohorts, allowing direct comparison of a diagnostic score
among multiple cohorts. Finally, we combined the previous SMS and
the bacterial/viral diagnostic described here into an integrated antibiotics
decision model (IADM) that can determine whether a patient with
acute inflammation has an underlying bacterial infection.
RESULTS
Derivation of the seven-gene bacterial/viral metascore
Our previously published 11-gene SMS cannot reliably distinguish be-
tween bacterial and viral infections, showing mostly nonsignificant
differences in score distribution between patients with bacterial and

 viral infections (fig. S1). Having previously shown that there is a con-
served host gene response to viral infections (15), we hypothesized that
a classifier for bacterial versus viral infections would allow for an im-
proved diagnostic model. We thus performed a systematic search for gene
expression microarray cohorts that studied patients with viral and/or
bacterial infections. We identified eight cohorts (11, 18–26) [both whole
blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)] that included
n > 5 patients with both viral and bacterial infections (Table 1A). The
eight cohorts were composed of 426 patient samples (142 viral and
284 bacterial infections), including children and adults, medical and
surgical patients, and those with multiple sites of infection. We performed
multicohort analysis on the eight cohorts as described previously (fig. S2)
(7, 15–17). We set significance thresholds at an effect size >2-fold and
a false discovery rate (FDR) <1% in leave–one–data set–out round-robin
analysis. However, to make sure that neither tissue type (whole blood or
PBMCs) biased our results, we further selected only those genes that also
had an effect size >1.5-fold in separate analyses of both PBMC and
whole-blood cohorts. This process resulted in 72 differentially expressed
genes significant at the above thresholds (table S1). We used a greedy
forward search (7) to find a gene set optimized for diagnosis, resulting
in seven genes [higher in viral infections (IFI27, JUP, and LAX1) and
higher in bacterial infections (HK3, TNIP1, GPAA1, and CTSB); fig. S3)].
As expected, a “bacterial/viral metascore” based on these seven genes
robustly distinguished viral from bacterial infections in all eight of the

 discovery cohorts [summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area
under the curve (AUC), 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.89 to
0.99; Fig. 1 and fig. S4].
We next tested the seven-gene set in the six remaining independent
clinical cohorts (13, 14, 27–29) that directly compared bacterial and viral
infections (138 bacterial and 203 viral infections, totaling 341 samples)
and found a summary ROC AUC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.96) (Fig. 1,
Table 1B, and fig. S5; individual test characteristics in table S2). To
measure the generalizability of our signature, we also tested whether
cells stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or influenza
virus could be separated with the bacterial/viral metascore [GSE53166
(30), n = 75; AUC, 0.99; fig. S6].
Global validation via COCONUT conormalization
There are dozens of microarray cohorts in the public domain that studied
either bacterial or viral infections, but not both, thus precluding a direct
(within data set) estimate of diagnostic power for separating bacterial
and viral illness. To apply and compare a gene score across these cohorts,
we needed a method that could remove inter–data set batch effects while
remaining unbiased to the diagnosis of the diseased patients. We de-
signed and implemented a modified type of array normalization that uses
the ComBat (31) empirical Bayes normalization methods on healthy con-
trols to obtain bias-free corrections of disease samples (a method we call
COmbat CO-Normalization Using conTrols or “COCONUT”; fig. S7).
Housekeeping genes remained invariant across both diseases and cohorts
after COCONUT conormalization, and each gene still retained the same
distribution between diseases and controls within each data set (fig. S8).
Because our method assumes that all healthy samples are derived from
the same distribution, we separately normalized the whole-blood and
PBMC samples because different immune cell types have different
baseline gene expression distributions. Using COCONUT conormaliza-
tion, the bacterial/viral metascore has a global AUC of 0.92 (95% CI,
0.89 to 0.96) in the whole-blood discovery cohorts (figs. S9 to S10). We
then applied this method to test the bacterial/viral metascore in all public
domain microarray cohorts that matched inclusion criteria and used
whole blood. These data sets included the four direct validation cohorts
that included control patients and an additional 20 cohorts that mea-
sured either bacterial or viral infections but not both (n = 143 + 897 =
1040) (32–49). These data sets represent a wide variety of clinical con-
ditions, including a range of infection types (Gram-positive, Gram-negative,
atypical bacterial, common respiratory viruses, and dengue) and severities
(mild infections to septic shock). The bacterial/viral metascore showed
an overall ROC AUC of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.94) across these data,
which allowed us to set a single global score cutoff (Fig. 2, Table 1B, and
fig. S11). Finally, we performed the same procedure on PBMC validation
cohorts [six cohorts (50–54), n = 259; global AUC, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87
to 0.97; figs. S12 to S13)]. All three global ROC AUCs using COCO-
NUT conormalization (discovery whole blood, 0.92; validation whole
blood, 0.93; validation PBMCs, 0.92) approximately matched the summa-
ry AUC of the direct validation cohorts (0.91), giving high confidence in
the diagnostic power of this method.
Integrated antibiotics decision model
A key clinical need is diagnosing whether a patient with signs and
symptoms of inflammation has an underlying bacterial infection, be-
cause rapid and judicious administration of antibiotics is key to im-
proving patient outcomes. Neither the SMS nor the bacterial/viral
metascore alone can robustly distinguish between all three classes of
(i) noninfected inflammation, (ii) bacterial illness, and (iii) viral illness.
Thus, to increase clinical relevance, we developed an “integrated anti-
biotics decision model” (IADM), whereby we first apply our previously
described SMS (7) to test for the presence of an infection and then apply
the bacterial/viral metascore to the samples that test positive for infec-
tion (Fig. 3A). As described previously, the only way to establish test
characteristics for the IADM simultaneously across cohorts is to use
COCONUT conormalization. We found that the SMS in COCONUT-
conormalized data is strongly influenced by age, which could be
caused by age-dependent differences in healthy subjects, infected pa-
tients, or both (fig. S14). We thus excluded cohorts focused on infants
(children <1 year old) from the IADM. We also removed the low-
severity outpatient viral illness cohorts (GSE17156 and GSE68310)
because in outpatient settings, the history and physical exam findings
make noninfectious causes of acute in-
flammation less likely. This resulted in a
total of 20 cohorts for testing the IADM
(n = 1057). The resulting global AUC for
the SMS across the available data was 0.86
(95% CI, 0.84 to 0.89) (fig. S15 and table S3).
We set global thresholds for an SMS sen-
sitivity for infection of 95% and a bacterial/
viral metascore sensitivity for bacterial
infection of 95%. Considering all three
classes of noninfectious inflammation,
bacterial infection, and viral infection,
this yielded an overall sensitivity and
specificity of 94.0 and 59.8% for bacterial
infections and 53.0 and 90.6% for viral
infections, respectively (Fig. 3). These
performance characteristics were largely
unchanged if healthy patients were in-
cluded in the noninfected class (fig. S16).
The overall positive and negative likeli-
hood ratios for bacterial infection in the
IADM were thus 2.34 (LR+) and 0.10 (LR−),

 respectively, compared to a recent meta-analysis of procalcitonin that
showed a negative likelihood ratio of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.38) (55).
We plotted negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive val-
ue (PPV) versus prevalence for these test characteristics; the NPV and
PPV for bacterial infection at a prevalence of 15% were 98.3 and 29.2%,
respectively (fig. S17).
There was only one data set [GSE63990 (14)] that included non-
infectious inflammation patients and patients with both bacterial and
viral illness but did not include healthy controls, precluding its addi-
tion to the global calculations. We thus tested the IADM on this cohort
with locally derived test thresholds. We found an overall bacterial
infection sensitivity and specificity of 94.3 and 52.2%, respectively
(fig. S18).

Finally, we used targeted quantitative NanoString nCounter (56) gene
expression assays to prospectively validate these results in independent
whole-blood samples from children with sepsis from the Genomics of
Pediatric SIRS and Septic Shock Investigators (GPSSSI) cohort (total
n = 96, with 36 SIRS, 49 bacterial sepsis, and 11 viral sepsis patients;
Fig. 4 and table S4). The GPSSSI cohort was also used by data set
GSE66099, but the children profiled here were never profiled via micro-
array and are thus not part of the discovery data sets. In the NanoString
validation cohort, the SMS AUC was 0.81 (AUC of 0.80 in GSE66099).
Similarly, the bacterial/viral metascore AUC was 0.84 (AUC of 0.83 in
GSE66099). The microarray AUCs were thus preserved when tested with
a targeted, quantitative gene expression assay in new patients. Applying
the same IADM, the sensitivity and specificity were 89.7 and 70.0% for
bacterial infections (LR−, 0.15; LR+, 3.0)
and 54.5 and 96.5% for viral infections
(LR−, 0.47; LR+, 15.6), respectively.
DISCUSSION
Better diagnostics for acute infections are
needed in both the inpatient and outpatient
settings. In low-acuity outpatient settings,
a simple diagnostic that can discriminate
bacterial from viral infections may be
enough to assist in appropriate antibiotic
usage. In higher-acuity settings, causes of
noninfectious inflammation become more
important to rule out, and so a decision
model for antibiotic prescriptions must
include a noninfected, nonhealthy case.
Thus, a reliable diagnostic needs to dis-
tinguish all three cases (noninfected in-
flammation, bacterial infection, and viral
infection). Here, using 426 samples from
8 cohorts, we derived a parsimonious set
of only seven genes that can accurately dis-
criminate bacterial from viral infections
across a very broad range of clinical con-
ditions in independent cohorts (total of
30 cohorts composed of 1299 patients).
We further demonstrated that by inte-
grating our published SMS (7) (to distinguish the presence or absence
of infection) with the bacterial/viral metascore (to determine infection
type) into a single IADM, we can determine with high accuracy which
patients do not require antibiotics. Finally, we confirmed the diagnostic
power of both the seven-gene set and the IADM in independent
samples using a targeted NanoString assay, showing that the signatures
retain diagnostic power when not relying on microarrays.
The IADM has a low negative likelihood ratio (0.10) and high es-
timated NPV, meaning it would be potentially effective as a rule-out
test. A meta-analysis of procalcitonin that included 3244 patients from
30 studies resulted in an overall estimated negative likelihood ratio of
0.29 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.38) (55). Thus, the IADM negative likelihood
ratio is much lower than the estimate for procalcitonin (on the basis of
nonoverlapping 95% CIs), indicating clinical utility. Moreover, these
test characteristics assume no knowledge of the patient and so are only
estimates of the real-world clinical utility of such a test, because patient
history, physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory values would
all assist in a diagnosis as well. Even given these caveats, a recent eco-
nomic decision model of screening ICU patients for hospital-acquired
infections suggested that a test such as the IADM that can accurately
diagnose bacterial and viral infections could be cost-effective (57).
Ultimately, only interventional trials will be able to establish cost-
effectiveness and clinical utility of a diagnostic test.
We validated our diagnostic in pediatric sepsis patients from the
GPSSSI cohort using a NanoString assay. NanoString is highly accu-
rate and is a useful tool for measuring the expression of multiple genes
at once; however, it is also likely too slow for clinical application (4 to
6 hours per assay). Thus, although the assay confirms that our gene set
is robust in targeted measurements, further work will be needed to

 improve the turnaround time. There are multiple possibilities for de-
veloping a commercial assay based on rapid multiplexed quantitative
PCR that meets the time-sensitive demands of an infection diagnostic
test. However, this technical hurdle is something that all gene expression–
based infection diagnostics must overcome to gain clinical relevance.
A simple linear score generally cannot adequately separate the three
classes (noninfected inflammation, bacterial infections, and viral infec-
tions); other machine-learning techniques, such as multiple regression
or tree-based methods, are typically used. However, because the location
and scale of different genes vary greatly between microarray types, such
techniques cannot usually be truly validated across microarray platforms.
Although COCONUT partially circumvents this issue by allowing for dis-
covery of a model across several cohorts with application of the same
model in COCONUT-conormalized validation cohorts, such method
would be forced to leave out data sets that did not include healthy con-
trols. We thus opted to use our simple, scale-free, difference-of-geometric-
means scores. This allowed us to both discover and validate our diag-
nostic models across multiple cohorts. It may be possible to discover a
gene set using multiple classification techniques, instead of our current
method of starting with the SMS and then adding the bacterial/viral
metascore. However, to discover and then validate in multiple cohorts
requires that all cohorts be appropriate for COCONUT normalization,
and we have instead erred on the side of maximizing the utility of
multiple clinically heterogeneous cohorts.
Several groups have published models for diagnosing infections on
the basis of host gene expression; none have yet made it into clinical
practice. Most of these classifiers were not tested in multiple independent
cohorts, had too many genes to allow rapid profiling necessary for useful
diagnosis, or both. For instance, Suarez et al. created a 10-gene k-nearest-
neighbor classifier but did not test it outside their published data set
(GSE60244) (13). Tsalik et al. created a 122-probe (120-gene) classifier on
the basis of multiple regression models, but in testing it in external GEO
cohorts, they retrained their regression coefficients in each new data set
(14). Such model retraining results in a strong upward bias to these
validation numbers (assuming that a final model would not be locally
retrained). Other groups have made gene expression classifiers for infection
but did not include models for discriminating viral infections (7, 9, 10).
Our IADM is robust across a wide range of disease types and severities
but has a relatively lower sensitivity for viral infections. Non–gene expression
biomarkers have also been used for infection diagnosis. Procalcitonin has
been studied extensively in the setting of sepsis diagnosis but cannot dis-
tinguish between noninfected individuals and those with viral infections

 (58). Protein-panel assays have been shown to discriminate bacterial from
viral infections but cannot discriminate patients with noninfectious inflam-
mation (59, 60). Thus, all of these classifiers have certain strengths and
weaknesses that will become more apparent with further prospective
testing and direct comparison.
Although our goal in this study was to identify biomarkers and not
necessarily mechanistic biology, it is still important for a biomarker set to
have biological plausibility. Of the seven genes in the bacterial/viral meta-
score, six have previously been linked to infections or leukocyte activation.
Both IFI27 and JUP were shown in single-cohort genome-wide expression
studies to be induced in response to viral infection (52, 61), whereas TNIP1
and CTSB are important in modulating the nuclear factor kB and necrotic
responses to bacterial infection (62, 63). Finally, LAX1 (up-regulated in
viral infections) is involved in activation of T and B cells (64), and HK3
is instrumental in the neutrophil differentiation pathway (65). Thus, the
role of these transcripts as biomarkers for infection type is not coincidental.
Here, we developed a method, COCONUT, to directly compare
our model across a large pool of one-class cohorts that would otherwise
be unusable for benchmarking a diagnostic gene set. COCONUT assumes
that all controls come from the same distribution; that is, the genes in each
group of controls are reset to have the same mean and variance, with
batch parameters learned empirically from gene groups. This method cor-
rects for microarray and batch processing differences between cohorts
and thus allows for the creation of a global ROC curve with a single
threshold. This is a more “real-world” measure of diagnostic power than
reporting multiple validation ROC curves, because no single cutoff could
attain the same test characteristics in the different cohorts (17). How-
ever, the COCONUT-conormalized data showed differences in infants
as compared to older children and adults. Therefore, infants were ex-
cluded from the validation, meaning that the efficacy of the IADM in
infants remains unknown. These data also had few children with viral in-
fections between the toddler and teenage years; this is an age group that will
require further study. The most important takeaway from the COCONUT-
conormalized data is that both the bacterial/viral metascore and the IADM
retain diagnostic power across a very broad range of infection types and
severities, with overall AUCs that are similar to the summary AUCs
from head-to-head comparisons within cohorts.
Overall, we have leveraged our proven multicohort analysis pipe-
line to derive a highly robust model for improving infection diagnosis.
Using our method, we were able to validate this in dozens of independent
microarray cohorts. We have also validated using a targeted NanoString
assay in pediatric sepsis patients. Although the IADM still needs to
undergo optimization for rapid turnaround as well as a prospective
interventional trial, it seems clear that molecular profiling of the host
genome will become part of the clinical toolkit in the future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The purpose of this study was to use an integrated multicohort analysis
framework to analyze multiple gene expression data sets to identify a
biomarker that can classify patients with bacterial or viral infections.
This framework has been described previously (7, 16, 17).
Systematic search and multicohort analysis
We performed a systematic search in NIH GEO and EBI ArrayExpress
for public human microarray genome-wide expression studies using the
following search terms: bact[wildcard], vir[wildcard], infection, sepsis,
SIRS, ICU, nosocomial, fever, and pneumonia. Abstracts were screened
to remove all studies that were (i) nonclinical, (ii) performed using tis-
sues other than whole blood or PBMCs, or (iii) comparing patients who
were not matched for clinical time.
In all data sets that included sample-level microbiology data, we
retained only those samples for which pathogens of a single type (either
bacterial or viral) had been identified. Data sets for which sample-level
microbiology data were not available were still retained if the corres-
ponding paper described the cohort as being infected with only bacteria
or only viruses. In three cohorts, the diagnosis was not necessarily micro-
biologically confirmed: GSE11755 (one of six patients described as
culture-negative meningitis), GSE42834 (described as a cohort of bacterial
pneumonia meeting clinical criteria), and GSE57065 (described as a co-
hort of bacterial sepsis for which 86% of patients had microbiological
confirmation). All other samples used in our analysis had confirmed
microbiological diagnoses at the sample or cohort level.
All microarray data were renormalized from raw data (when avail-
able) using standardized methods. Affymetrix arrays were renormalized
using GC robust multiarray average (gcRMA) (on arrays with mismatch
probes) or RMA. Illumina, Agilent, GE, and other commercial arrays
were renormalized via normal-exponential background correction fol-
lowed by quantile normalization. Custom arrays were not renormalized.
Data were log2-transformed, and a fixed-effect model was used to sum-
marize probes to genes within each study. Within each study, cohorts
assayed with different microarray types were treated as independent.
We performed multicohort meta-analysis as described previously
(7, 15–17). Briefly, genes were summarized using Hedges’ g, and the
DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used for meta-analysis,
followed by Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction (66).
Patients with bacterial infections were compared to patients with viral
infections within studies, such that a positive effect size indicates that a
gene was more highly expressed in virus-infected patients and a negative
effect size indicates that a gene was more highly expressed in bacteria-
infected patients. All data sets that matched criteria with n > 5 in both
bacterial and viral cohorts that were published by the time of the initial
search (1 April 2015) were used for discovery; data sets published after
this time were used in validation.
To find a set of genes highly conserved in differential expression be-
tween bacterial and viral infections, we selected all cohorts that directly
compared patients with bacterial and viral infections. Patients with do-
cumented co-infections (both bacterial and viral) were removed. Co-
horts were required to have >5 patients in each group to be included in
the meta-analysis. Both PBMC and whole-blood cohorts were included.
We only included genes present in 7 (k − 1) data sets; thus, there were
14,729 genes included in the analysis. Significant genes were those that
had an effect size >2-fold and an FDR <1% in a leave–one–data set–out
round-robin analysis. However, to ensure that genes from both whole
blood and PBMCs were represented in the final gene set, we also per-
formed separate meta-analyses of the PBMC and whole-blood cohorts
and removed all genes that had an effect size <1.5-fold in either whole blood
or PBMCs separately. The remaining genes were considered significant.
Derivation of the seven-gene set
To find a set of highly diagnostic genes, the significant genes from the
meta-analysis were run through a greedy forward search as described
previously (7). Briefly, this algorithm starts with zero gene and adds one
gene in each cycle that best improves the AUC for diagnosis in the dis-
covery cohorts, until a new gene cannot improve the discovery AUCs

 more than some threshold (an increase in the weighted discovery AUC
of ≥1). The resulting genes are used to calculate a single bacterial/viral
metascore, calculated as the geometric mean of the “viral” response genes
minus the geometric mean of the “bacterial” response genes, times the
ratio of the number of genes in each set. The resulting continuous score
can then be tested for diagnostic power using ROC curves.
Direct validation of the seven-gene set
The resulting gene set was first validated in the remaining public gene
expression cohorts that directly compared bacterial to viral infections
but were too small to be used for meta-analysis. Two cohorts
[GSE60244 (13) and GSE63990 (14)] were made public after our
meta-analysis was completed and so were used for validation. To show
generalizability, we also examined one large in vitro data set comparing
LPS to influenza exposure in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but this
was not included in the summary AUC because it is not expected to
come from the same distribution as the clinical studies.
Summary ROC curves
For both discovery and validation cohorts, summary ROC curves were
constructed according to the method of Kester and Buntinx (67) and as
previously described (17). Briefly, linear-exponential models were made
for each ROC curve, and the parameters of these individual curves were
summarized using a random-effects model to estimate the overall sum-
mary ROC curve parameters. The a-parameter controls AUC (in par-
ticular, distance of the line from the line of identity), and the b-parameter
controls skewness of the ROC curve. Summary AUC CIs were estimated
from the SE of the a and b in meta-analysis.
COCONUT conormalization
There are dozens of public microarray cohorts that profiled patients
with either bacterial or viral infections, but not both. It would be advan-
tageous to be able to compare a gene score across these cohorts, but it
has not previously been possible because each different microarray has
widely different background measurements for each gene, and among
studies using the same types of microarrays, there are large batch effects.
To make use of these data, we needed to conormalize these cohorts in
such a way that (i) no bias is introduced that could influence final clas-
sification (the normalization protocol should be blind to diagnosis), (ii)
there should be no change to the distribution of a gene within a study,
and (iii) a gene should show the same distributions between studies after
normalization. A method with these characteristics would allow our
gene score to be calculated and compared across multiple studies and
thus allow us to broadly test its generalizability.
The ComBat empirical Bayes normalization method (31) is popu-
lar for cross-platform normalization but crucially falls short of our
desired criteria because it assumes an equal distribution across disease
states. We thus developed a modified version of the ComBat method,
which conormalizes control samples from different cohorts to allow
for direct comparison of diseased samples from those same cohorts.
We call this method COmbat CO-Normalization Using conTrols or
COCONUT. COCONUT makes one strong assumption that it forces
control/healthy patients from different cohorts to represent the same
distribution. Briefly, all cohorts are split into healthy and diseased
components. The healthy components undergo ComBat conormaliza-
tion without covariates. The ComBat estimated parameters a
ˇ
, b
ˇ
, s
ˇ
, d*,
and g* are obtained for each data set for the healthy component and then
applied to the diseased component (fig. S7). This forces the diseased com-
ponents of all cohorts to be from the same background distribution but
retains their relative distance from the healthy component (t statistics
within data sets are only different post-COCONUT because of floating-
point math). It also does not require any a priori knowledge of disease
classification (such as bacterial or viral infection), thus meeting our
prespecified criteria. This method does have the notable requirement
that healthy/control patients are required to be present in a data set for it
to be pooled with other available data. Also, because healthy/control pa-
tients are set to be in the same distribution, it should only be used where
such an assumption is reasonable (such as within the same tissue type,
among the same species, etc.).
The ComBat model and the COCONUT method
As described by Johnson et al., the ComBat model corrects for loca-
tion and scale of each gene by first solving an ordinary least-squares
model for gene expression and then shrinking the resulting param-
eters using an empirical Bayes estimator, solved iteratively (31). For-
mally, each gene expression level Yijg (for gene g for sample j in batch i)
is assumed to be composed of overall gene expression ag, design matrix
of sample conditions X with regression coefficients bg, additive and
multiplicative batch effects gig and dig, and an error term eijg
Yijg ¼ ag þ Xbg þ gig þ digeijg
Estimating parameters using ordinary least-squares regression
standardizes Yijg to a new term Zijg (where s
ˇ
g is the SD of eijg)
Zijg ¼
Yijg � a

g � Xb

The standardized data are now distributed according to
Zijg ∼ nðgig; d2
igÞ, where gig ∼ nðYi; t2
i Þ and d2
ig ∼ inverse g ðli; qiÞ.
The inverse g is assumed as a standard uninformative Bayesian
prior. The remaining hyperparameters are estimated empirically, with
the derivation and solution found in the original reference (31). The
estimated batch effects g�

In our modified version of this method (COCONUT), all of the
above are performed according to the original method without modifi-
cation. However, it is applied to only the healthy/control patients in
each data set (Y is a matrix of only healthy patient samples). The esti-
mated parametersa

 Global ROCs
We used COCONUT conormalization to test (i) all discovery cohorts
and (ii) all validation cohorts, even those containing only bacterial or
only viral illness. We did this separately for the PBMC and whole-blood
data, for reasons described previously. After conormalization, the distri-
butions for the individual cohorts were plotted together to allow for di-
rect comparison. For each plot, we show (i) the distribution of scores for
each data set, (ii) the normalized gene expression for each gene within
the diagnostic test, and (iii) the housekeeping genes that are expected to
show no difference between classes based on meta-analysis. The healthy
patients have been removed from these plots. However, to show that the
distributions of genes between healthy and diseased patients within
cohorts do not change after COCONUT conormalization, we have also
shown plots with both patient types with both target genes and
housekeeping genes (fig. S8). Genes with minimal effect size and min-
imal variance in meta-analysis were selected as housekeeping genes.
For each comparison, a single global ROC AUC was calculated, and
a single threshold was set to allow for an estimate of the real-world di-
agnostic performance of the tests. Thresholds for the cutoffs for bacterial
versus viral infection were set to approximate a sensitivity of 90% for
bacterial infection, because a bacterial infection false-negative (the recom-
mendation not to give antibiotics when antibiotics are needed) can be
devastating.
Integrated antibiotics decision model
The SMS can discriminate between patients with severe acute infections
and those with inflammation from other sources, but it cannot distin-
guish between types of infection (fig. S1). We thus tested an IADM, in
which the 11-gene SMS is applied, followed by the 7-gene bacterial/viral
metascore. This model thus identifies (i) whether a patient has an infec-
tion and, if so, (ii) what type of infection is present (bacterial or viral).
We were unable to identify enough validation cohorts with patients
with noninfected inflammation that also included healthy controls;
thus, in constructing the global ROCs, we used both discovery and val-
idation cohorts. Using COCONUT conormalization, we set global
thresholds across all included cohorts, and these were applied to each
individualdata set to test the ability of the IADM to correctly distinguish
patients with noninfectious inflammation, bacterial infection, and viral
infection. Healthy patients were not included as a diagnostic class be-
cause they were used in the conormalization procedure. The IADM was
also applied separately to all cohorts that had no healthy controls but
that included (i) noninfected SIRS patients and (ii) patients with both
bacterial and viral infections.
Because the PPV and NPV are dependent on prevalence and the
prevalence of infections in the data used here does not match the prev-
alenceofinfectionsinahospitalsetting,wecalculatedPPVandNPVcurves
on the basis of the sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infections attained
with the IADM. Formally, NPV = specificity × (1 − prevalence)/((1 −
sensitivity)×prevalence+specificity×(1−prevalence));PPV=sensitivity ×
prevalence/(sensitivity × prevalence + (1 − specificity) × (1 − prevalence)).
NanoString validation
We tested 96 samples from independent patients (those never profiled
viamicroarray)fromtheGPSSSItrials(18–22)usingatargetedNanoString
(56) digital multiplex gene quantitation assay. The 18 genes were re-
normalized to housekeeping genes (FRAS1 and LRRC17). The SMS and
bacterial/viral metascore genes were both assayed, and the diagnostic
performance of the IADM was calculated.
