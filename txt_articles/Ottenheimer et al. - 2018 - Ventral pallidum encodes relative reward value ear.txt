earlier and more robustly than nucleus accumbens

The ventral striatopallidal system, a basal ganglia network thought to convert limbic infor-
mation into behavioral action, includes the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum
(VP), typically described as a major output of NAc. Here, to investigate how reward-related
information is transformed across this circuit, we measure the activity of neurons in NAc and
VP when rats receive two highly palatable but differentially preferred rewards, allowing us to
track the reward-specific information contained within the neural activity of each region. In VP,
we find a prominent preference-related signal that flexibly reports the relative value of reward
outcomes across multiple conditions. This reward-specific firing in VP is present in a greater
proportion of the population and arises sooner following reward delivery than in NAc. Our
findings establish VP as a preeminent value signaler and challenge the existing model of
information flow in the ventral basal ganglia.

 A
daptive reward consumption requires proper valuation of
each rewarded outcome relative to all available options in
order to select the appropriate consummatory response.
One circuit frequently implicated in such reward-related pro-
cessing is the ventral striatopallidal system. This basal ganglia
network, primarily composed of the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
and ventral pallidum (VP), receives dense inputs from limbic
structures, such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amyg-
dala1–3, leading to the hypothesis that this system is a critical
interface between reward processing and motor output4–7.
Accordingly, many reward-related behavioral responses depend
on normal connectivity between NAc and VP8–11. Together, these
results and the anatomical positioning of NAc and VP within the
basal ganglia have contributed to the notion that, within this
circuit, the main purpose of VP is to pass on reward-related
limbic and motor information from its striatal partner, NAc12,13.
A serious limitation thus far in the characterization of the
ventral striatopallidal system is the lack of comparative observa-
tions in NAc and VP on a timescale relevant for the reward-
related processing in which the circuit is functionally implicated.
Understanding the transformation of reward-related information
across the ventral striatopallidal system during a seconds-long
behavioral response requires temporally precise measurements of
neural activity in each region. Previous work has identified neu-
rons in both NAc14–24 and VP25–32 with phasic responses to
rewards (and their predictive stimuli) that track outcome value,
but it is unclear how reward-related neural responses in VP result
from activity in NAc, as the classic model of ventral striatopallidal
function would predict. In fact, a recent comparison of activity in
NAc and VP in the same behavioral task found that the onset of
cue responses in VP frequently precedes their onset in NAc28,
leaving the question of whether VP acts exclusively downstream
of NAc in this reward processing circuit.
To further interrogate the respective roles of VP and NAc in
reward processing, we measured neural activity in a task with
multiple reward outcomes. In addition to permitting a compar-
ison of the onset of phasic activity in response to reward outcome,
this approach allowed us to track over time the reward-specific
information contained within the spiking activity of individual
neurons and neural ensembles in each region. Surprisingly, our
data indicate that a much greater proportion of VP neurons are
reward-selective than neurons in NAc. Moreover, the reward-
specific information signaled by both individual neurons and
ensembles in VP precedes that signaled by NAc neurons. Further,
VP neurons reliably and rapidly track relative value across a
variety of reward conditions. The flexibility of this VP value signal
and its abundance within the neural population establish VP as a
robust value signaler and suggest it does so at least partly inde-
pendently of its classical input, NAc, encouraging consideration
of VP as an important reward processing center rather than
simply a relay for reward-related information to motor outputs.
Results
Rats prefer sucrose over maltodextrin in home cage and task.
To test encoding of multiple rewards in NAc and VP, we chose to
compare responses to 10% solutions of sucrose and maltodextrin,
two palatable carbohydrates with equivalent caloric value but
distinct tastes33–35. After multiple days of free access to the
solutions in their home cages, rats began training on the beha-
vioral task. On each trial, 110 μL of reward solution was delivered
into a metal bowl contingent upon rats’ entry into the reward port
during a 10 s white noise cue (Fig. 1a). Trials with presentation of
a given solution were pseudorandomly interspersed throughout
the session, an approach that obscured the reward identity from
the rat until the solution was delivered. Once rats responded to
the cue on 80% of trials, we implanted drivable tungsten electrode
arrays in either NAc or VP (Fig. 1b). To evaluate reward pre-
ference, we conducted 60-min two-bottle choice tests prior to and
following the first and last recording sessions with sucrose and
maltodextrin; rats consistently showed a preference for sucrose
(Fig. 1c).
Neural recording sessions began after rats recovered from
surgery. To monitor consumption during the task, we recorded
each rat’s individual licks during each recording session. The
overall licking pattern was similar for both rewards; there was no
significant main effect of reward on the total number of licks (F
(1,3142) = 1.24, p = 0.29) or the total duration of licking (F
(1,3142) = 0.303, p = 0.59) within the 15 s following reward
delivery. However, rats licked slightly, but significantly, more for
the preferred reward, sucrose, during the period 1–4.5 s following
reward delivery (23.2 vs. 22.3 licks; F(1,3142) = 66.0, p = 5.3E-6;
Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2). Complementarily, the interlick
intervals following the first 30 licks of each trial were significantly
shorter on sucrose trials (Fig. 1e; F(1,3000) = 33.3, p = 0.000084).
This accelerated consumption of sucrose echoes the rats’
preference for sucrose over maltodextrin in the two-bottle choice
test (Fig. 1c).
More neurons in VP fire reward-selectively than in NAc. We
collected neural activity from six rats with electrodes in NAc (182
neurons, 4–49 per rat, median 32, 36 sessions) and five rats with
electrodes in VP (436 neurons, 32–137 per rat, median 86,
25 sessions). Neurons in both regions responded to reward-
related events: cue onset, port entry (PE), and reward delivery
(RD) (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with prior findings
(NAc:15–21,24,36,37, VP:25–28,31,38,39). To evaluate reward selec-
tivity, we focused on the neural activity following reward delivery,
when the rats first detected the identity of the reward and con-
sumed it. Initial inspection of the average firing rates of all
neurons during this epoch divided into sucrose and maltodextrin
trials revealed greater firing for sucrose among reward-excited
neurons in both regions (Supplementary Fig. 4, see also Fig. 5).
Evidence of reward-specific firing was also evident in peri-event
histograms of individual neurons’ spiking in each region (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5).
To more precisely determine the presence and onset of reward-
selective responding, we divided the time surrounding reward
delivery into overlapping bins with a sliding window of 600 ms
advanced by 100 ms. For each bin, we found the number of
neurons whose firing rates were significantly differentially
modulated across sucrose and maltodextrin trials and categorized
these neurons by which reward elicited greater firing. We
conducted this analysis for all neurons from each region (Fig. 2a,
b), as well as for each individual rat to ensure general consistency
across subjects and recording locations (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Notably, the peak number of reward-selective neurons in any
given bin was greater in VP than in NAc (33% vs. 10%, χ2 = 34.3,
p = 4.7E-9) and this bin with peak reward selectivity was earlier
in VP (centered at 1.1 s) than in NAc (centered at 1.9 s) (Fig. 2a,
b). We compared the time course of selectivity in each region by
subtracting the proportion of selective neurons in VP from the
proportion in NAc in each bin (Fig. 2c), revealing that at no point
was there more reward selectivity in NAc than in VP. We also
compared the onset of reward-selective responses in each region
and found that the distribution of onsets was earlier in VP than in
NAc (Fig. 2d).
To characterize the activity of reward-selective neurons in each
region, we identified neurons that met our criteria for reward
selectivity in any of the bins centered 0.4–3 s after reward
delivery, a period of time that captured the majority of phasic

 reward-selective responses across both regions (Fig. 2a, b). We
then plotted these neurons’ individual and averaged activity on
sucrose and maltodextrin trials (Fig. 2e–p). Within this time
window, 24% of neurons in NAc and 52% of neurons in VP were
at one point reward-selective, a significantly greater proportion in
VP (χ2 = 39.9, p = 2.6E-10). In both regions, we found that most
of the reward-selective responses were excitations for sucrose;
some of these cells were also inhibited for maltodextrin (Fig. 2e–g,
k–m). A smaller subset of reward-selective cells in each region
had greater firing rates for maltodextrin, often due to an
inhibition for sucrose (Fig. 2h–j, n–p). Thus, despite only
minimal differences in licking behavior for each reward, a
substantial proportion of neurons in both VP and NAc fire in a
reward-selective manner, and these reward-selective responses are
represented in a greater proportion of the recorded population in
VP than in NAc.
VP neurons decode trial type earlier and more accurately than
NAc. The analysis above indicates differential encoding of two
rewards, sucrose and maltodextrin, with most selective units
showing greater responding for sucrose, the preferred reward,
over maltodextrin. To complement this analysis, we used linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) to test when and to what extent

 neural activity in each region could be used to predict reward
identity. Using fivefold cross-validation, we determined for each
600 ms bin how accurately LDA models trained on the spike
activity of individual neurons could classify trials as sucrose or
maltodextrin. Models trained on single unit activity classified trial
type at rates above chance in both VP and NAc (Fig. 3a).
Focusing on our window of interest from Fig. 2 (0.4–3s post
reward delivery), we found that VP single unit accuracy improved
over shuffled data more than NAc (shuffled vs true X region: F(1,
31150) = 11.5, p = 0.0019). When comparing the most accurate
bin in NAc (centered at 1.4 s) to that in VP (centered at 1 s), there
was a noticeable shift in classification accuracy in the cumulative

 distribution function (CDF) (Fig. 3b), corresponding to a sig-
nificantly greater improvement in accuracy over shuffled data in
VP (shuffled vs true X region: F(1,1154) = 13.6, p = 0.00037).
Notably, VP single units first improved over shuffled data for the
bin centered at 0.5 s, whereas NAc single units first improved over
shuffled data at 0.9 s (purple and green lines in Fig. 3a). To
control for the larger number of neurons recorded in VP, we
conducted the analysis 20 more times with 182 randomly chosen
VP units. The first bin significantly more accurate than shuffled
data ranged from 0.4–0.6 s (median 0.5 s), consistently earlier
than 0.9 s in NAc.
Although the data from individual neurons points to more
reward-selective activity in VP than NAc, an alternate explanation
is that reward-specific information is more distributed across

 neurons in NAc than in VP. If so, including additional neurons in
the model should improve the accuracy of the NAc decoders
relative to VP. To overcome the limited number of sessions in
NAc with greater than five neurons, we pooled neurons together
into pseudoensembles to compare how much information is
contained within larger groups of neurons in each region. We ran
the same analysis as before using LDA models trained with the
spiking activity of 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 neurons randomly
selected from each region. Increasing the number of neurons
improved accuracy in both regions (Fig. 3c, d), contributing to a
significant main effect of ensemble size on peak bin accuracy (F
(4,490) = 237, p = 4.3E-113). Pseudoensembles in VP had greater
peak accuracy than those in NAc across all levels, evident in a
main effect of region on peak bin accuracy (F(1,490) = 212, p =
3.3E-40; Fig. 3e). Notably, pseudoensembles in VP reliably reached
100% decoding accuracy with 100 neurons; NAc pseudoensembles
reached at most 97% with 150 neurons (Fig. 3e). The smaller
difference in accuracy between the two regions with 150 neurons
was reflected in a significant interaction between ensemble size
and region on decoder accuracy (F(4,490) = 8.73, p = 8.2E-7).
Even at larger sizes, VP pseudoensembles consistently achieved
peak accuracy earlier than those in NAc (Fig. 3f; main effect of
region: F(1,490) = 289, p = 2.5E-51). Overall, our results from
these decoding analyses confirm that VP neurons contain more
reward-specific information than NAc neurons and indicate that
this information arises and peaks earlier in VP than in NAc.
While our initial decoding analysis included all neurons from
each region regardless of their status as reward-selective or not,
we were also interested in directly comparing the amount of
reward-specific information contained in the reward-selective
population in each region, so we conducted the same decoding
analyses but restricted our sample to those neurons classified as
reward-selective in Fig. 2. The accuracy of single unit models
trained exclusively on reward-selective neurons was much closer
across regions (Supplementary Fig. 7a); VP no longer improved
over shuffled data more than NAc in the window 0.4–3 s post
reward delivery (shuffled vs. true X region: F(1, 13612) = 0.0952,
p = 0.7617) nor when comparing the peak bin in each region
(shuffled vs true X region: F(1, 504) = 3.46, p = 0.080). Never-
theless, there continued to be a noticeably earlier rise and peak in
accuracy for VP models than for NAc (Supplementary Fig. 7a).
For pseudoensemble models, we were limited by the number of
reward-selective neurons in NAc, but we found that with groups
of 10 and 25 neurons, there was a main effect of region on peak
bin accuracy (F(1,196) = 38.9, p = 2.7E-9; Supplementary Fig. 7e)
and

of
peak
accuracy
(F(1,196) = 54.8,
p = 3.8E-12;
Supplementary Fig. 7f), indicating that VP pseudoensembles
consisting of reward-selective neurons are more predictive and
achieve peak accuracy earlier than NAc reward-selective pseu-
doensembles. Overall, these data provide evidence that, even
among the reward-selective population, VP neurons represent
reward-specific information earlier and more strongly than NAc.

increased spiking for the preferred reward (sucrose) relative to
maltodextrin, and given the results from previous recording
studies15–17,19,21,22,25,26,31,32,40, we hypothesized that this reward-
specific signal reflects relative reward value. If so, we would
predict that the report of relative value would depend on recent
reward history, which we can approximate by analyzing trials
according to both the current and previously received reward. For
instance, the relative value of sucrose would be greater following
trials where rats received maltodextrin, and maltodextrin’s value
would be lesser following sucrose trials. To look for evidence of
such a scheme, we plotted the mean activity of all neurons in NAc
and VP for each of the four combinations of previous and current
reward (Fig. 4). While there was some evidence for previous-
reward modulation of reward response across the population of
neurons in NAc (Fig. 4a, b), VP neurons showed very prominent
modulation of the reward-related response according to our
prediction: greater firing for sucrose following maltodextrin trials
and lesser firing to maltodextrin following sucrose (Fig. 4c, d).
When analyzing the contribution of reward and previous reward
to the neural activity in each region 0.8–1.3 s following reward
delivery, we found a significant main effect for previous reward in
VP (F(1,1724) = 10.1, p = 0.022) but not in NAc (F(1,704) =
0.0167, p = 0.90), though a test including data from both regions
did not find a significant interaction between previous reward and
region (F(1,2428) = 3.89, p = 0.055).
We next sought to more quantitatively assess the impact of
previous outcomes on the reward-evoked signals in each region
by using a linear model approach that predicts a neuron’s firing
rate based on the reward outcomes on the current trial and each
of the prior six completed trials41. The weights of the coefficients
assigned to each trial reveal how strongly the outcome from that
trial factors into the neuron’s firing rate on the current trial. For
both the current trial and the previous trial, only VP models
showed, on average, coefficients that deviated from chance
(Fig. 4e). Consistent with our relative value hypothesis and with
our observations in Fig. 4c, d, the direction of the coefficients
indicated a strong positive impact of receiving sucrose on the
firing rate in the current trial and a negative impact of sucrose
received on the previous trial. We also found that more neurons
in VP had significant coefficients than in NAc for both the
current and most recent trial (Fig. 4f). We found no impact of
previous trials beyond the most recent on reward-related firing in
either region. We also conducted this analysis on cue- and port
entry-evoked firing in NAc and VP; surprisingly, we found that
receiving sucrose on either of the previous two trials had a
positive impact on the port entry-related firing in VP, and this
effect was greater in reward-selective neurons (F(1,852) = 10.1,
p = 0.024; Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, firing in VP at both the
time of the reward and the reward-seeking action reflects the
recent reward history.
VP signals reward value relative to currently available options.
Our results comparing VP neural responses to sucrose and
maltodextrin are consistent with a relative value signal, but a
stronger test of this hypothesis requires changing the relative
value of the reward outcomes and looking for a corresponding
change in neural activity. Such an approach has demonstrated
that neurons in NAc report relative value21,22,42, but it is unclear
whether VP neural reports of a reward’s value are relative to other
currently available outcomes. We tested for relative value by
conducting an additional session for VP rats in which sucrose was
replaced with water, an outcome much less rewarding than both
sucrose and maltodextrin solutions34,43. We predicted that, if VP
neural activity reflects relative value, then the predominant
reward-specific neural response would be excitations for mal-
todextrin, which in this scenario is the preferred outcome.
Alternatively, if VP activity reflects absolute value, then the neural
responses would remain suppressed to maltodextrin as in the
sessions with sucrose and maltodextrin (Fig. 2k).
Two rats successfully completed this session type, contributing
a total of 125 neurons (79 and 46, respectively). Water was much
less preferred than maltodextrin, evident in the mean lick rate for
each outcome (Fig. 5a). By calculating the number of reward-
selective neurons across 600 ms bins, we saw an even greater
proportion of neurons in VP showed reward-specific responses

 for any given bin (59% at 1.3 s) (Fig. 5b). We plotted the activity
of neurons that met our criteria for reward selectivity during any
bin within the 0.4–3 s window we used in Fig. 2 (Fig. 5c, d); 70%
of neurons were reward-selective during this time, a significantly
greater proportion than the 53% in sessions these two rats
completed with sucrose and maltodextrin (χ2 = 9.68, p = 0.0019).
This higher proportion may reflect the considerable difference in
value between water and maltodextrin compared to the similar
value of the two appetitive reward outcomes, sucrose and
maltodextrin. Consistent with our first prediction, nearly all
these reward-specific neurons were excited by the preferred
reward, maltodextrin, and most were also inhibited by the less
preferred outcome, water (Fig. 5e).
Because this session was the first time rats experienced water
and maltodextrin together, we were able to observe the emergence
of the excitations for maltodextrin delivery, which previously
produced a reduction in firing in reward-selective cells (Fig. 2k),
and the emergence of inhibitions for the novel outcome, water. By
averaging the normalized activity of the reward-selective cells with
greater firing for maltodextrin (the same group of neurons from
Fig. 5c–e), we tracked the population’s responses across each trial
of each reward (Fig. 5f). In both rats, there was a noticeable
increase in firing for maltodextrin and decrease in firing for water
among this population of reward-selective neurons throughout the
session, reflected in a significant interaction between the effects of
reward and the number of trials in both rats (VP2: F(14,1500) =
17.0, p = 2.1E-39; VP5: F(27,1960) = 22.7, p = 6.2E-96). In fact,
despite being classified as having greater firing for maltodextrin
than water, in neither rat did these neurons start out with greater
firing for maltodextrin. These data demonstrate that neurons in
VP modulate their responses within minutes to reflect the relative
value of available outcomes in an altered reward landscape.
VP activity orders three outcomes by relative value. Finally, to
test whether reward-selective neurons in VP can reflect the
relative value of more than two options, we conducted additional
sessions for VP rats where we reintroduced sucrose along with
maltodextrin and water for a total of three possible reward out-
comes. We recorded activity from 254 neurons in three rats (83,
104, and 67 neurons, respectively) across four total sessions. As
before, we looked for neurons with significant reward-selective
responses across the three outcomes for each 600 ms bin and

 classified them by the reward that elicited the greatest firing. At
most, 77% of the population was significantly modulated by
reward outcome (for the bin at 1.1 s), the majority of which had
greatest firing for sucrose (Fig. 6b). We then looked at the activity
of reward-selective neurons with greatest firing for sucrose during
any bin in our standard 0.4–3 s window. Remarkably, this
population showed on average a large excitation for sucrose, a
smaller excitation for maltodextrin, and an inhibition for water,
consistent with the rats’ relative preference for the three rewards
(Fig. 6c, d). As a whole, this population had significantly different
mean normalized firing rates for the time period 0.8–1.4 s after
reward delivery for all three reward outcomes (F(2,561) = 441,
p = 0.000014; all pairs of rewards: p < 1E-6, Tukey test correcting
for multiple comparisons). Therefore, rather than simply indi-
cating good and bad options, VP can reliably report the relative
value of multiple outcomes in a complex reward space.
Discussion
Our data here demonstrate that neurons in both NAc and VP fire
in a reward-selective manner, but this reward-specific firing is
much more prevalent in the VP neural population. This relation
is evident in both the larger number of neurons in VP that fire
selectively for sucrose and maltodextrin, as well as the greater

 decoding accuracy of LDA models trained on the spiking data of
neurons in VP. Moreover, both the onset and peak of reward-
specific information in VP precedes those in NAc. We also found
that neurons in VP tracked the relative value of the reward
outcomes across three different conditions: on a trial-by-trial
basis in sessions contrasting sucrose and maltodextrin, in a new
session replacing sucrose with water where maltodextrin became
the preferred outcome, and, finally, in sessions with all three
outcomes. Thus, our data demonstrate a robust reward valuation
signal in VP that is unlikely to be fully explained by its classical
NAc input.
Previous work has shown that neural responses in NAc for
orally consumed rewards and their predictive stimuli are modu-
lated by the location44, motor response23, size15–17,19,42, and
concentration21,22,24 of the reward outcomes. In VP, reward-
related neural responses are known to be modulated by reward
size25,26 and the rat’s physiological need for a given reward31,32.
Here, we controlled for all of these factors by choosing two
reward solutions (sucrose and maltodextrin) with equivalent
caloric value that were delivered in the same location and elicited
nearly identical motor responses in rats in a normal physiological
state. Thus, aside from their chemosensory properties, the two
rewards differed only in the rats’ preference for each, suggesting
that the reward selectivity reported here was based on preference
or identity. Because the dominant response in both regions was
greater firing rate for the preferred reward, sucrose (Fig. 2e, k), it
is likely that preference is the major contributor to the reward-
selective responses we observed in each region. If NAc and VP
neural activity primarily coded reward identity, we would expect
equivalent numbers of biased responses for each reward, along
with greater rigidity of reward-specific coding in VP across
changing reward contexts, two conditions that were not met. Still,
the existence of a small proportion of cells in both regions with
greater firing for maltodextrin (Fig. 2h, n) could be indicative of
the presence of some identity-based encoding.
Due to its well-defined anatomical role as an output of NAc
within the ventral striatopallidal pathway1–3,12, most studies on
the role of VP in reward processing have been within the context
of NAc function. Such experiments have established an important
role for this pathway in reward-related behavior. For instance,
normal connectivity between NAc and VP is necessary for cues
paired
with
reward
delivery
to
invigorate
reward-seeking
actions10; on the other hand, disconnection of NAc and VP
enhances the attribution of motivational salience to a reward-
predicting cue8, demonstrating that connections between NAc
and VP have important but varying roles in the valuation of and
responding to reward-related stimuli in different tasks. There is
also evidence for the importance of NAc-VP connectivity in
reward consumption. Normalizing plasticity between NAc D2
MSNs and their downstream targets in VP reverses deficits in
hedonic responses and motivation to work for natural reward

 inhibition of NAc D2 MSN terminals in VP increases motivation
to work for food reward45. Additionally, NAc and VP contain
reciprocally connected μ-opioid-agonist-responsive hotspots that
readily alter rats’ reward intake and expression of pleasure11,46.
This collection of findings is consistent with the notion that VP is
a crucial downstream mediator of NAc reward-related functions,
but it does not clarify how reward-related information arrives in
each region and when NAc and VP connectivity is necessary for
proper reward processing, questions readily answered with
in vivo observations of neural activity in each region during a
reward-processing task.
A recent study of NAc and VP activity in vivo found that the
onset of VP excitatory neural responses to a cue indicating reward
availability typically precedes the onset of cue-evoked neural
responses in NAc, demonstrating that NAc cannot be the primary
source of excitatory VP cue responses and, therefore, that VP
does not act exclusively downstream of NAc in the processing of
cues predicting reward28. Likewise, in the present study, we found
that reward-specific information arises and peaks earlier in VP
than in NAc. This reward-specific information is largely con-
tained within phasic excitations to the preferred reward; there-
fore, given that NAc inputs to VP are predominantly inhibitory
(or produce a biphasic response)12,47–50, it is unlikely that this
reward-specific excitation originates in NAc. Nevertheless, our
data do not exclude the possibility that certain aspects of NAc
activity, such as the inhibitions we observe around the time of
port entry and reward delivery (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c), are
permissive of the reward-selective responses in VP, which do not
arise until 0.5 s following reward delivery (Figs. 2b, 3a); addi-
tionally, later-occurring inhibitions to sucrose in VP (Fig. 2b, n,
o) could originate from earlier sucrose-specific excitations in NAc
(Fig. 2a, e, f). Together, our findings support the notion that VP
processes certain aspects of reward independently of NAc, and
they highlight the importance of studying other inputs to VP that
could provide the input for the rapid, phasic reward-specific
signal observed in VP here. Candidate regions include amyg-
dala50,51, lateral hypothalamus52,53 and prefrontal cortex, which,
in addition to direct projections54, could provide input via the
subthalamic nucleus55,56, a route that is reported to be faster than
through striatum57,58.
In our recordings, we sampled a large proportion of the
anterior-posterior extent of medial NAc shell and core and the
majority of the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes of VP
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Despite previous evidence in NAc and
VP
for
subregion
heterogeneity
in
reward-related
func-
tion12,13,46,59–63, we saw no meaningful differences in reward
selectivity across our recorded location (Supplementary Fig. 1,
Supplementary Fig. 6), which is consistent with a previous report
of uniformly distributed relative value responses in NAc21,
although high density recordings in NAc and VP subregions are
required to make definitive conclusions. Given the current data,
our observations on the timing and magnitude of reward-selective
signaling in NAc and VP appear to hold true across subregions in
both structures, but the data do not preclude differences in lateral
NAc shell and more rostral portions of ventrolateral VP, which
we did not record from in our study, nor do they preclude dif-
ferent functions for a relative value signal dependent on local and
long-range connectivity. Another caveat is that the neural data
from each region were collected from separate animals. This
approach introduces the possibility that variations in each sub-
ject’s task performance and reward preference and subtle changes
in the experimental conditions could contribute to the differences
observed between these two groups. Future recordings performed
in the same animal would provide definitive evidence that
reward-specific information arises in VP prior to NAc and fea-
tures more prominently in the VP neural population.
Our data show that VP neurons can flexibly signal a reward’s
value relative to the other currently available outcomes. A similar
scheme has been shown for a small fraction of reward-selective
neurons in NAc by varying the concentrations of available
sucrose solutions21,22 or the magnitude of reward42. While pre-
vious work has shown that VP can signal differences in value
based on size25,26, physiological need31,32, and associative learn-
ing40, relative value, to our knowledge, has not been tested. One
noteworthy finding is that the VP neural response to heavily
salinated water (normally an aversive stimulus) is greater than
that of sucrose when rats are salt-deprived31; however, there was
no significant reduction in firing for sucrose once it became the
less preferred reward, perhaps because salt water and sucrose
were administered in separate blocks, hindering a direct com-
parison. In our experiments, we have shown that the VP neural
response to the same reward (maltodextrin) in the same phy-
siological state is altered when that reward’s value relative to the
other available outcomes changes (Fig. 5), the hallmark of a
relative value signal. The robustness of this signal across the
population invites consideration of the role of ventral pallidum in
the contrast effect64. Despite multiple demonstrations of neural
correlates of negative and positive contrast in both rat and pri-
mate NAc21,42,65,66, NAc lesions affect only instrumental but not
consummatory contrast effects67,68; the strong relative value
signal in VP makes it an appealing candidate to contribute to
both effects. We also found a surprising impact of previous
reward outcomes on port entry-evoked firing in VP (but not in
NAc), suggesting that VP neural activity associated with reward-
seeking actions reflects either an expectation of upcoming reward
or a readout of recent reward history from which a relative value
signal can be computed, a point of interest that could be better
explored with additional studies in which expected outcome is
manipulated. Overall, our findings encourage additional study of
ventral pallidum function and its non-striatal inputs to better
characterize its distinct role in reward processing within the
ventral striatopallidal system.
Methods
Animals. Subjects were male Long-Evans rats (n = 11) from Harlan weighing
250–275 g at arrival and single-housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Rats were given
free access to food and water in their home cages for the duration of the experi-
ment. All experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with
protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins
University.
Reward solutions. Reward solutions were 10% solutions by weight of sucrose
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) and maltodextrin (SolCarb, Solace Nutrition, CT)
in tap water. Rats were first given 24 h of free access to the maltodextrin solution in
their home cages. For three subsequent days, they were given simultaneous free
access to 10% solutions of sucrose and maltodextrin in their home cages.
Behavioral task. Rats were trained to respond to a 10 s white noise cue by making
an entry into the reward port. The cue terminated upon port entry, and 500 ms
following port entry, 110 μl of either reward was delivered into the metal cup
within the reward port. Sucrose and maltodextrin trials were pseudorandomly
interspersed throughout the session such that rats could not detect the identity of
the reward until it was delivered. Individual licks were recorded with a custom-
built arduino-based lickometer using a capacitance sensor (MPR121, Adafruit
Industries, NY) with a 1 kHz sampling rate. Each cue was separated by a variable
intertrial interval (ITI) that averaged 45 s. During the ITI, the reward cup was
evacuated via vacuum pump, flushed with 110 μl of water, and evacuated again.
Maltodextrin, sucrose, and water were each delivered via separate infusion pumps
(Med Associates, VT) and separate metal tubes entering the cup. There were a total
of 60 trials per session. In some sessions that were not included in this analysis, we
presented the rewards in blocks of 30 trials each.
Preference test. To assay rats’ preference for sucrose or maltodextrin, we per-
formed two 60-minute two-bottle choice tests, during which rats had free access to
10% solutions of each reward. Bottles were weighed before and after to determine
the amount of each solution consumed by each rat. The first test was following
recovery from surgery and prior to recording. The second was at least a day after

 the final session with sucrose and maltodextrin and prior to any subsequent ses-
sions with different reward outcomes.
Surgical procedures. Drivable electrode arrays were prepared with custom-
designed 3D-printed plastic pieces assembled with metal tubing, screws, and nuts.
Sixteen insulated tungsten wires and two silver ground wires were soldered to an
adapter that permitted interfacing with the headstage (Plexon Inc, TX). The drives
were surgically implanted in trained rats. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane
(5%) and maintained under anesthesia for the duration of the surgery (1–2%). Rats
received injections of carprofen (5 mg/kg) and cefazolin (70 mg/kg) prior to inci-
sion. Using a stereotactic arm, electrodes were aimed at either NAc (AP + 1.5 mm,
ML + 1.2 mm, DV -7 mm) or VP (AP + 0.5 mm, ML + 2.4 mm ML, DV -8 mm).
The base of the drive and the adapter were secured to the skull with seven screws
and cement. The ground wire was wrapped around a screw and placed superficially
in brain tissue in a separate craniotomy posterior to the recording electrodes.
Recording. Following a week of recovery in their home cages (and the first two-
bottle choice test), rats were trained on the task again until they became accus-
tomed to performing the task while tethered via a cable from their headstage to a
commutator in the center of the chamber ceiling. Once they responded on at least
40 of 60 of trials, recording sessions began. Electrical signals and behavioral events
were collected using the OmniPlex system (Plexon) with a 40 kHz sampling rate.
We continued to record from the same location for multiple sessions if new
neurons appeared on previously unrecorded channels; if multiple sessions from the
same location were included in analysis, the same channel was never included more
than once. If no neurons were detectable or following successful recording, the
drive was advanced 160 μm, and recording resumed in the new location at mini-
mum two days later to ensure settling of the tissue around the wires.
Additional sessions with altered reward outcomes. For three of the rats with
electrodes in VP (VP2, VP3, and VP5), we conducted an additional session with
water (replacing sucrose) and maltodextrin (VP3 did not complete the session,
likely due to low motivation to pursue the new reward outcomes). The session was
otherwise unchanged from those with sucrose and maltodextrin.
Subsequently, all three rats were tested in sessions with all three outcomes
available. The three trial types were pseudorandomly interspersed throughout the
session. The total number of trials was expanded to 90 to permit equivalent
amounts of each trial as before.
Histology. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and electrode sites were
labeled by passing a DC current through each electrode. Rats were perfused
intracardially with 0.9% saline following by 4% paraformaldehyde, after which
brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Brains were
then transferred to 25% sucrose for at minimum 24 h before being frozen on dry
ice and sectioned into 50 um slices on a cryostat. Slices were then stained with
cresyl violet to determine recording sites.
Initial spike sorting and analysis. Spikes were sorted into units using offline
sorter (Plexon); following initial manual selection of units based on clustering of
waveforms along the first two principal components, units were separated and
refined using waveform energy and waveform heights at various times relative to
threshold crossing (slices). Any units that were not detectable for the entire session
were discarded. Event creation and review of individual neurons’ responses were
conducted in NeuroExplorer (Nex Technologies, AL). Cross-correlation was
plotted for simultaneously recorded units to identify and remove any neurons that
were recorded on multiple channels. All subsequent analysis was performed in
MATLAB (MathWorks, MA). Event-related responses were found by constructing
peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for spikes following each event. Neurons
were determined to be modulated by an event if the spike rate in a custom window
following each presentation of the event significantly differed from a 10 s window
prior to cue onset according to a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p < 0.05, two-tailed).
For these tests, we analyzed activity 500 ms after the cue, the 1000 ms centered on
port entry, and 1000 ms after reward delivery.
Optimal bin size for averaged PSTH activity was determined using Akaike
Information Criteria (AIC)14. For our data, we used the smallest possible bin size
that showed less than a 10% change from the optimal AIC value. This bin size,
referred to as the deflection point, typically ranged from 20 to 100 ms. The spiking
activity across these bins was smoothed with a LOWESS function.
To visualize the normalized activity of neurons, the mean activity within each of
the smoothed, optimally-sized bins of the PSTH plots for each neuron was
transformed to a z-score with the equation (Fi – Fmean)/Fsd, where Fi is the firing
rate of the ith bin of the PSTH, and Fmean and Fsd are the mean and the standard
deviation of the firing rate during the 10 s baseline period. Color-coded maps of
individual neurons’ activity and average activity traces were constructed based on
these z-scores.
Analysis of licking behavior. PSTHs for visualizing licking activity around reward
solution delivery were constructed as for neurons (above) with a fixed bin size of
100 ms and LOWESS smoothing. To test for differences in the duration of the
licking bout and the number of licks on sucrose and maltodextrin trials, we ran a
three-way ANOVA on the raw licking data for the fixed effect of reward and the
random effects of session and subject, with session nested within subject (with trial
as our n). We also ran this test on the number of licks 1–4.5 s post reward delivery,
an epoch in which we noticed a visible difference in the average lick rate (Fig. 1d).
We further characterized this difference in licking activity by finding the mean
duration of the interlick intervals following the first 30 licks of each reward. We ran
a three-way ANOVA for the fixed effects of reward and interval # and the random
effect of subject (with each ILI's session mean as our n).
Classification of neurons as reward-selective. For the analysis of reward-
selective activity during reward consumption, we segmented the time surrounding
reward delivery into overlapping 600 ms bins advanced by 100 ms. We only
included trials in which the rat began licking within 2 s of reward delivery to ensure
the rat sampled the reward on each included trial. Neurons were significantly
reward-modulated for a given bin if they there was a significant interaction (p <
0.01) for that neuron between the effect of baseline (−22 to −12 s from reward
delivery) vs. bin firing and the effect of reward solution (with trial as our n) in two
consecutive bins. This approach minimized the amount of noise in the classifica-
tion (measurable as the number of neurons classified as reward selective prior to
reward delivery) while still permitting relatively brief reward-specific responses to
register. We then further classified these reward-selective neurons by the reward for
which they had greater normalized firing in that bin, found with the equation (Fb –
Fmean)/Fsd, where Fb is the firing rate of each bin, and Fmean and Fsd are the mean
and the standard deviation of the firing rate during the 10 s baseline period. This
same analysis was used to classify neurons from the sessions comparing water and
maltodextrin.
To choose which bins best captured the population of reward-selective neurons
across both regions, we plotted the cumulative onset of reward selectivity for all
neurons as a fraction of the total population (Fig. 2a, b). We chose to include all
neurons that were reward-selective in any of the bins from 0.4 to 3 s, which
captured the majority of phasic reward-specific responses following reward delivery
in both regions. To determine which of these neurons were significantly excited or
inhibited by either reward (Fig. 2g, j, m, p), we performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test comparing on each trial the (raw) firing rate during the −22 to −12 s baseline
window from reward delivery to the firing rate in each of the bins centered 0.4–3 s
for each reward (p < 0.05 cutoff, two-tailed). A neuron was considered excited or
inhibited by a given reward if it had a significant increase or decrease in spikes for
any of the bins 0.4–3 s post reward delivery. We also plotted the cumulative onsets
of reward selective neurons as a fraction of total reward selective neurons in each
region to compare the timing of the onsets in each region and compared the
distributions with a two-way ANOVA with the main effect of region and the
random effect of subject (Fig. 2d).
To classify neurons as reward-selective with three reward outcomes, we
performed the same ANOVA analysis as before with the water condition added to
the effect of reward, looking for an interaction between the effects of reward and
baseline vs. bin firing (with trial as our n). We then further classified reward-
selective neurons by the outcome for which they had the greatest spiking in that bin
and found, as before, if a neuron was significantly inhibited or excited by any of the
outcomes in any bin 0.4–3 s with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (p < 0.05 cutoff, two-
tailed). Because there were three outcomes, we also performed a two-way ANOVA
on the effect of reward outcome (and random effect of subject) on the average
normalized firing 0.8–1.4 s post reward delivery (the bin with the most number of
reward-selective neurons) of all selective neurons with greatest firing for sucrose
(Fig. 6c) as well as pairwise comparisons between the three rewards (Tukey test,
correcting for multiple comparisons).
Quantification of firing rate based on current and previous reward. To
examine how average activity in each region was affected by previous reward, we
normalized the average activity of all neurons in each region to their baseline firing
rate in a window −22 to −12 s from reward delivery. We chose to quantify the
average activity 0.8–1.3 s post reward delivery (marked with blue lines in Fig. 4a, c),
a period we visually identified as having the best evidence of previous reward-
modulated activity. Thus, the activity of neurons was normalized with the equation
(Fr – Fmean)/Fsd, where Fr is the mean firing rate 0.8–1.3 s following reward delivery
for each of the four current/previous reward combination, and Fmean and Fsd are
the mean and the standard deviation of the firing rate during the 10 s baseline
period on all trials. We then performed ANOVAs testing the effects of reward and
previous reward (and random effect of subject) on the normalized activity of
neurons in that window for each region (with neuron as our n). To compare the
regions, we also performed a test on all the neurons from both regions with the
added factor of region.
Linear models. To find the impact of previous trials’ outcomes on current trial
firing, we fit linear models (fitlm in MATLAB) to the firing rate of each neuron on
each trial according to the outcomes on the current trial and the previous six trials.
For this analysis, we used the same window as above, 0.8–1.3 s post reward
delivery, and normalized the activity for each neuron on each trial to the activity of

 that neuron during baseline period −22 to −12 s from reward delivery on all trials.
The normalized activity on each trial was paired with a corresponding vector of
seven 0 s and 1 s indicating the reward outcome (0 for maltodextrin and 1 for
sucrose) on the current and previous six trials (this required exclusion of all trials
preceding the seventh completed trial). This convention caused positive coefficients
to indicate a positive influence of receiving sucrose rather than maltodextrin on
firing rate for that trial and vice versa. We then found the coefficients for each of
the seven relative trials for each neuron as well as whether there was a significant
impact of that relative trial on firing rate (p < 0.05, two-tailed t-test). We then did
the same analysis but shuffled the trial outcomes to find what values would be
expected by chance. For each region, we performed ANOVAs testing the main
effects of shuffled vs. true data and trial relative to current (and the random effect
of subject) on coefficient and then performed Tukey tests correcting for multiple
comparisons to find differences on each trial between the coefficients and their
shuffled data (p < 0.05). We tested for significant differences in the proportion of
neurons with significant coefficients across true and shuffled data from both
regions as well as just the true data from each region with chi-squared tests for each
relative trial (p < 0.05). For the PE coefficients in VP, we also performed an
ANOVA testing for the main effect of whether a neuron was classified as selective
in Fig. 2 on the strength of the coefficients in the first two previous trials (in
addition to the effect of trial and random effect of subject).
Emergence of responses to water and maltodextrin. To track how the average
activity of reward-selective neurons changed on water and maltodextrin trials
across the session with those two reward outcomes, we normalized the mean
activity of the reward-selective neurons identified in Fig. 5c–e on each trial to their
baseline activity in the 10 s window −22 to −12 s from reward delivery. We
focused our analysis on each neuron’s normalized activity 0.8–1.8 s following
reward delivery, an epoch we visually identified as representative of the mal-
todextrin excitations and water inhibitions. Thus, neurons were normalized with
the equation (Ft – Fmean)/Fsd, where Ft is the mean firing rate 0.8–1.8 s following
reward delivery on each trial, and Fmean and Fsd are the mean and the standard
deviation of the firing rate during the 10 s baseline period on all trials. We then
plotted the average activity according the number of trials the rat had completed
(Fig. 5f). We performed a two-way ANOVA (reward X trials of reward) on the
normalized activity of the neurons from each rat across each respective trial of each
reward (with each neuron’s normalized activity on each trial as our n). This
approach required capping the total number of trials included in the test at the
maximum number of trials for the reward with the least number of completed
trials.
Decoding. For single unit decoding, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model
(the fitcdiscr function in MATLAB) was trained on one neuron’s spike activity for
one 600 ms bin on 80% of trials. This model was then used to classify the remaining
20% of trials as sucrose or maltodextrin. We performed this five times in a fivefold
cross-validation approach and averaged performance across all five repetitions to
find that unit’s accuracy. We also conducted the analysis with the trial identities
shuffled to determine the accuracy on shuffled data. We then repeated this analysis
for every neuron in each region for each bin. If there were fewer than seven spikes
across all sucrose or maltodextrin trials, we excluded that neuron for that bin to
avoid errors from creating an LDA model on a dataset with too little variance. To
determine when accuracy in each region improved over shuffled data, we found all
bins when the mean accuracy of the true data exceeded the 99% confidence interval
of the shuffled data for at minimum two consecutive bins. To ensure that our
results were not affected by the greater number of neurons in VP (423 vs. 182), we
took 20 random selections of 182 of the unit models from VP and recalculated the
confidence intervals to evaluate if it would affect the results (by and large it did not;
see Results). To compare accuracy in our standard window of 0.4–3 s after reward
delivery (Fig. 2) across regions, we performed an ANOVA testing the effects of
shuffled versus true data (whether or not the accuracy came from a shuffled data
model or a true data model), region, and bins (and the random effect of subject)
with each neuron model’s true or shuffled accuracy in each bin as our n. We also
performed an ANOVA testing the effects of shuffled vs. true data and region (and
the random effect of subject) to compare the accuracy of the most accurate bin in
each region (with the shuffled and true data from each neuron in the respective bin
from each region as our n). To compare only reward-selective neurons (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7), we performed the same tests but included only neurons classified
as reward-selective in Fig. 2.
To look at how model classification accuracy increased with additional units, we
pooled together separately recorded units. This approach requires matched
numbers of trials, so we only included neurons recorded during sessions with at
least 20 trials of each reward. Subsequently, when training our pseudoensemble
LDA models, we restricted the analysis to 20 (randomly selected) trials of each
reward. We found the fivefold cross-validated accuracy for models trained on the
activity of randomly selected levels of 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 units from each
region. For each level, we performed the analysis 50 times. We then performed a
two-way ANOVA on the effects of pseudoensemble size and region on the accuracy
at each level’s peak bin (with each repetition at that peak bin for each level as our
n). We also performed a two-way ANOVA on the effects of pseudoensemble size
and region on the time of most accurate bin for each LDA model replicate (with
each repetition’s peak bin time at each level as our n). We also performed these
analyses on pseudoensembles containing only reward-selective neurons as
classified in Fig. 2 (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. unless otherwise noted.
Statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks) on unsmoothed
data. Specific tests are noted in the text, figure legends, and throughout the
methods. Generally, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests (the anovan
function in MATLAB) to test for main effects and interactions, Tukey tests for
pairwise comparisons corrected for multiple comparisons (multcompare in
MATLAB), and chi-squared tests for contingencies (crosstab in MATLAB). For all
ANOVAs testing behavioral and neural data across subjects, we included the
random effect of subject to account for non-independence in the data.
