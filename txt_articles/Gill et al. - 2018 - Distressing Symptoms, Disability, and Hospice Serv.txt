OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between the
presence and number of restricting symptoms and number
of disabilities and subsequent admission to hospice at the
end of life.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Greater
New
Haven,
Connecticut,
from
March 1998 to December 2014.
PARTICIPANTS: Decedents from a cohort of 754 persons
aged 70 and older (N = 562).
MEASUREMENTS: Hospice admissions were identified
primarily from Medicare claims, and 15 restricting symp-
toms and disability in 13 activities were assessed during
monthly interviews.
RESULTS: During their last year of life, 244 (43.4%) par-
ticipants were admitted to hospice. The median duration
of hospice was 12.5 days (interquartile range 4–43 days).
Although the largest increases were observed in the last
2 months of life, the prevalence of restricting symptoms
and mean number of restricting symptoms and disabilities
in the preceding months were high and trending upward.
During a specific month, the likelihood of hospice admis-
sion
increased
by
66%
(adjusted
hazard
ratio
(aHR) = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30–2.12)
in
the
setting
of
any
restricting
symptoms,
by
9%
(aHR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05–1.12) for each additional
restricting symptom, and by 10% (aHR = 1.10, 95%
CI = 1.05–1.14) for each additional disability. Each addi-
tional month with any restricting symptoms increased the
likelihood of hospice admission by 7% (aHR = 1.07, 95%
CI = 1.01–1.13).
CONCLUSION: Hospice services appear to be suitably
targeted to older persons with the greatest needs at the
end of life, although the short duration of hospice suggests
that additional strategies are needed to better address the
high burden of distressing symptoms and disability at the
end of life. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:41–47, 2018.

T
he Medicare hospice benefit was established in 1982
to ensure that beneficiaries have access to high-quality
palliative care in the last 6 months of life. Despite the
tremendous growth in hospice over the past 30 years, con-
cerns have been raised that it is often underused.1–5 The
median length of stay in hospice is only approximately
3 weeks, and approximately one-third of beneficiaries are
referred to hospice in the last 7 days of life.6 A possible
explanation for this is that the eligibility requirement that
beneficiaries have a life expectancy of 6 months or less for
a defined set of specific conditions6 that no longer includes
debility7 constrains access to hospice. As a second explana-
tion, physicians may not weigh the burden of disability in
their decision-making about hospice referral, despite evi-
dence that functional status is one of the strongest predic-
tors of mortality in older persons.8–10
Because hospice is designed to ameliorate pain and
other distressing symptoms, referral to hospice should be
based, at least in part, on the burden of these symptoms,
but the short duration of hospice, coupled with preliminary
data from our group, suggest otherwise. Specifically, we
found that a large proportion of older decedents have a
high prevalence of restricting symptoms during the last year
of life.11 Moreover, the need for services at the end of life
to assist with essential activities of daily living is at least as
great for older persons dying from organ failure and frailty
as for those dying from a more-traditional terminal condi-
tions such as cancer, and the need is much greater for those
dying from advanced dementia.12 Nevertheless, the evi-
dence indicates that hospice is underused for conditions

 other than cancer.6 As highlighted in a recent Institute of
Medicine report,13 failing to refer or delaying referral of
older persons to hospice at the end of life can place a high
burden on caregivers14 and result in suffering.15
The objective of the current study was to evaluate the
relationship between three clinically relevant exposures
(presence and burden of restricting symptoms and burden
of disability) and subsequent admission to hospice in the
last year of life. We postulated that these associations
would be weak or nonexistent. To test this hypothesis, we
used high-quality data from a unique longitudinal study of
older persons that includes monthly assessments of restrict-
ing symptoms and disability over more than 15 years and
information on hospice admissions obtained from Medi-
care claims.
METHODS
Study Population
Participants were drawn from an ongoing longitudinal
study of 754 community-living persons, aged 70 and older
who were initially nondisabled in activities of daily liv-
ing.16,17 Potential participants were members of a large
health plan (managed care and fee for service). Individuals
with significant cognitive impairment with no available
proxy,18 life expectancy of less than 12 months, plans to
move out of the area, or inability to speak English were
excluded. Only 4.6% of persons refused screening, and
75.2% of those eligible agreed to participate and were
enrolled from March 1998 to October 1999. The Yale
Human Investigation Committee approved the study, and
all participants provided informed consent.
Analytical Sample
The current analysis focused on the last year of life for
two reasons. First, Medicare coverage of hospice requires
a physician to certify that life expectancy is 6 months or
less if the terminal condition runs its normal course, and
second, median survival in hospice was 2 weeks in our
earlier study.19 Of the 623 decedents through December
2014, 29 (4.7%) had dropped out of the study after a
median follow-up of 27 months, 15 (2.4%) had been
admitted to hospice more than 1 year before their death,
14 (2.2%) died suddenly and would not have been consid-
ered for hospice,12 and three (0.5%) did not have sufficient
information available on restricting symptoms and disabil-
ity, leaving 562 participants in the analytical sample.
Data Collection
Comprehensive home-based assessments were completed at
baseline and at 18-month intervals for up to 198 months
(except for 126 months), and telephone interviews were
completed monthly through December 2014, with a com-
pletion rate of 99%. When participants were unable to
complete
the
monthly
interviews,
proxy
data
were
obtained using a standard protocol.18 A proxy completed
45.0% of the 6,629 monthly interviews in the current
analysis. The accuracy of these proxy reports was moder-
ate to substantial,20 with a kappa of 0.66 for restricted
activity11 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.56 for
burden of disability. Deaths were ascertained from the
local obituaries or an informant. A certified nosologist
coded cause of death using information from the death
certificate. During the comprehensive assessments, data
were collected on demographic characteristics; nine self-
reported, physician-diagnosed chronic conditions; body
mass index; cognitive status;21 depressive symptoms;22 and
social support.23
Ascertainment of Restricting Symptoms
During the monthly interviews, the occurrence of restricting
symptoms was ascertained using a standard protocol.16
First, participants were asked two questions related to
restricted activity: “Since we last talked, have you stayed in
bed for at least half a day due to an illness, injury, or other
problem?” and “Since we last talked, have you cut down on
your usual activities due to an illness, injury, or other prob-
lem?” Second, if participants answered “yes” to either ques-
tion, they were asked whether they had any of 24
prespecified symptoms or problems since the last inter-
view.24–27 Third, immediately after each “yes” response to a
specific symptom or problem, participants were asked, “Did
this cause you to stay in bed for at least half a day or cut
down on your usual activities?” As in prior studies,11,28 the
current analysis focused on 15 restricting symptoms: fatigue;
musculoskeletal pain; dyspnea; chest pain or tightness; nau-
sea, vomiting, or diarrhea; depression; anxiety; arm or leg
weakness; difficulty sleeping; dizziness or unsteadiness; diffi-
culty with memory or thinking; swelling in feet or ankles;
cold or influenza symptoms; poor or decreased vision; and
urinary frequency, pain, or incontinence. The test-retest reli-
ability of the protocol was high, with a kappa of 0.90 for
restricted activity and 0.75 or greater for all restricting
symptoms.11 Data on restricted activity were missing for
only 0.6% of the observations.
Assessment of Disability
Complete details regarding the assessment of disability are
provided elsewhere.17,18,29 During the monthly interviews,
participants were asked, “At the present time, do you need
help from another person to (complete the task)?” for each
of four basic activities (bathing, dressing, walking, transfer-
ring), five instrumental activities (shopping, housework,
meal preparation, taking medications, managing finances),
and three mobility activities (walk one-quarter of a mile,
climb flight of stairs, lift and carry 10 pounds). For these 12
activities, disability was defined as the need for personal
assistance or unable to do the task. Participants were also
asked about a fourth mobility activity, “Have you driven a
car during the past month?” Participants who responded
“No” were considered to be “disabled” in driving.29 To
address the small amount of missing data on disability
(0.9% of observations), multiple imputation was used with
100 random draws per missing observation.30

 admission was ascertained from a proxy informant and

cate.
Condition Leading to Death
Information from death certificates and the comprehensive
assessments was used to classify the condition leading to
death, according to the protocol provided in Table S1.12
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome was admission to hospice. Charac-
teristics of the analytical sample were summarized accord-
ing
to
hospice
status
using
information
from
the
comprehensive assessment that immediately preceded the
study period (last year of life), except for age, living situa-
tion, and number of disabilities, which were ascertained
from the telephone interview 12 months before death. The
likelihood of hospice admission was evaluated for each of
the conditions leading to death.
The prevalence of restricting symptoms was calculated
by dividing the number of participants with any restricting
symptoms in a specific month by the total number of par-
ticipants who completed an interview that month. The
mean number (burden) of restricting symptoms (possible
range 0–15) and disabilities (possible range 0–13) were
also calculated each month.
We used Cox proportional hazards models to evalu-
ate the associations between each of the three exposures
and time to hospice admission during the last year of
life.32 Because all exposure variables were time varying,
their value could change monthly. Participants were cen-
sored at the time of death or last completed interview if
they dropped out of the study before their death (n = 5:
n = 2,
hospice;
n = 3,
no
hospice).
The
association
between
each
exposure
and
hospice
admission
was
expressed as a hazard ratio (HR). For the presence of
any restricting symptoms, the HR denotes the likelihood
of hospice admission at month t (current month) based
on the presence (vs absence) of any restricting symptoms
at month t-1 (prior month). For the two other exposures,
the HR denotes the relative risk of hospice admission at
month t per one-unit increment in the number of restrict-
ing symptoms and disabilities at month t-1, respectively.
These models were subsequently rerun with the following
covariates:
age,
sex,
race/ethnicity,
education,
living
situation, number of chronic conditions, cognitive impair-
ment,
depression
symptoms,
low
social
support,
and
number of months since the comprehensive assessment.
The overall fit of the final models was assessed using
residual plots.
To enhance the clinical interpretation of our results,
we calculated the adjusted absolute risk difference (ARD)
for the presence of any restricting symptoms in month t-1,
based on the cumulative probability of hospice admission
over 12 months using the same time-varying Cox regres-
sion model,31 and we estimated 95% confidence intervals
(CI) using 100 bootstrapped samples.33 The ARD denotes
the difference in average probability of hospice admission
between participants who had any restricting symptoms in
month t-1 and those who did not. These calculations were
based on marginal probabilities of the outcome, assuming
that all participants were exposed and all participants were
unexposed, respectively, while holding the covariates fixed.
To determine the association between the cumulative
burden of restricting symptoms (during the exposure per-
iod) and subsequent hospice admission, we refit the Cox
model, substituting the cumulative number of months with
any restricting symptoms (for the presence of any restrict-
ing symptoms at month t-1) as a time-varying exposure
whose value increased by 1 for each month a participant
reported any restricting symptoms.
In a final set of analyses, the associations between the
time-varying exposures and admission to hospice were
evaluated according to the condition leading to death. All
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, NC), and P < .05 (two-tailed) was used to
indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Of the 562 decedents, 244 (43.4%) were admitted to hos-
pice during their last year of life. Persons admitted to hos-
pice were slightly older and more likely to have cognitive
impairment than those who were not admitted to hospice
(Table 1). The most-common condition leading to death
was frailty, followed by organ failure, advanced dementia,
and cancer (Table S2). The likelihood of hospice admission
was highest for cancer and advanced dementia, lowest for
frailty and other conditions, and intermediate for organ
failure. The mean � standard deviation duration of hos-
pice was 40.2 � 69.3 days (median 12.5 days, interquar-
tile
range
4–43 days),
with
no
significant
differences
according to the condition leading to death (P = .77).
Figure 1
provides
information
about
exposure
to
restricting symptoms and disability. The prevalence of
restricting symptoms (Figure 1A) was relatively flat (0.20–
0.24) until about 6 months before death, when it started
increasing, reaching a peak of 0.56 one month before
death. Similarly, the mean number of restricting symptoms
(Figure 1B) was relatively flat (0.8–1.0) until approxi-
mately 6 months before death, when it started increasing,
with the most-pronounced increase observed in the last
2 months of life. In contrast, the mean number of disabili-
ties (Figure 1C) increased progressively throughout the last
year of life, from 7.1 12 months before death to 10.7
1 month before death, with the greatest increases observed
in the last 2 months of life. These patterns were generally
similar for participants who were and were not admitted
to hospice (Figure S1), although the values for each expo-
sure were greater for the former than the latter, particu-
larly in the month before death.
Table 2 shows the associations between the three
time-varying exposures and admission to hospice. In the
setting of any restricting symptoms during a specific
month, the likelihood of hospice admission within the fol-
lowing month increased by 66%, after adjustment for
covariates. The corresponding increase per number of
restricting symptoms was 9%. For each additional disabil-
ity during a specific month, the likelihood of hospice
admission within the following month increased by 10%.
When evaluated as a time-varying cumulative exposure,
each additional month with any restricting symptoms (up

HOSPICE SERVICES AT END OF LIFE
43
 to month t-1) increased the likelihood of hospice admis-
sion at month t by 7% in unadjusted and adjusted analy-
ses. The adjusted ARD for the presence of any restricting
symptoms in a specific month, based on the cumulative
probability of hospice admission over 12 months, was
15.3% (95% CI = 7.5–24.1%).
The associations between the time-varying exposures
and admission to hospice, as denoted using adjusted haz-
ard ratios, were weakest for advanced dementia but were
generally consistent across the four other conditions lead-
ing to death, although several CIs spanned 1 (Table 3).
The point estimates for the presence and number of
restricting symptoms in a specific month were highest for
cancer, whereas the point estimates for the number of dis-
abilities in a specific month were highest for frailty and
other conditions. For the cumulative number of months
with any restricting symptoms, the association was statisti-
cally significant only for organ failure.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective longitudinal study of older persons, we
found strong and consistent associations between three
clinically relevant exposures and subsequent admission to
hospice in the last year of life. During a specific month,
the likelihood of hospice admission was 66% greater in
the setting of any restricting symptoms, 9% greater for
each additional restricting symptom, and 10% greater for
each additional disability. Approximately four of every
nine participants were admitted to hospice, although the
duration of hospice was relatively short (mean 40 days,
median 12.5 days). The timing of hospice admission may
reflect the course of restricting symptoms and disability,
which did not increase greatly in severity until the last
2 months of life.
Our
results
suggest
that
decisions
about
hospice
admission at the end of life are based, at least in part, on
the presence and burden of restricting symptoms and dis-
ability. We found that the likelihood of hospice admission
increased by 7% for each additional month with any
restricting symptoms. In absolute terms, the average prob-
ability of hospice admission was 15% higher in the last
year of life for participants who had any restricting symp-
toms in a specific month than for those who did not.
Based on prior literature suggesting that hospice is
often underused,1–5 especially for conditions other than
cancer,6 we had expected to find weak to no associations
between our three exposures and subsequent admission to
hospice. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the
associations were weak to nonexistent only for advanced
dementia. Although these results should be interpreted
cautiously given the limited power to detect statistically
significant subgroup differences, estimating life expectancy
for advanced dementia is difficult,34 making referral to
hospice particularly challenging.
Although the largest increases were observed in the
last 2 months of life, the prevalence of restricting symp-
toms and mean number of restricting symptoms and dis-
abilities in the preceding months were high and trending
upward. Whether earlier referral to hospice would have
alleviated the burden of distressing symptoms and disabil-
ity is uncertain. In an earlier study,28 we found that the
number
of
restricting
symptoms
at
the
end
of
life
decreased significantly after the start of hospice.
Prior reports have raised concerns that the Medicare
hospice benefit may not adequately address the care needs

 of persons whose illnesses result in a prolonged period of
severe disability.1,3,4 In the setting of distressing symptoms
and progressive disability, an alternative to hospice at the
end of life is palliative care. Prior studies that have shown
beneficial effects of palliative care on symptom burden,
although the benefit on functional outcomes is less cer-
tain.35,36 The absence of information on receipt of pallia-
tive care before the start of hospice is a limitation of the
current study.
Several
other
limitations
warrant
comment.
First,
because participants were members of a single health plan in
a small urban area in Connecticut, our results may not be
generalizable to older persons in other settings or states,
although the demographic characteristics of our cohort
reflect those of older persons in New Haven County, Con-
necticut, which are similar to the characteristics of the U.S.
population as a whole, with the exception of race and eth-
nicity.37 Also, use of hospice in the current study (43.4% of
deaths) was comparable with national estimates (44.6% of
deaths).38 Second, the use of information from death certifi-
cates is an imperfect strategy for classifying conditions lead-
ing
to
death.
Previous
research
has
shown
that
the
concordance between coding of death certificates by a nosol-
ogist and an adjudicated cause of death is high for cancer
and moderate for congestive heart failure and chronic lung
disease but only fair for dementia,39 largely because of
underreporting of dementia on death certificates. We used
data from cognitive testing in addition to coding by a nosol-
ogist to classify advanced dementia as a condition leading to
death. Third, disease-specific information was not available
on severity of illness. Restricting symptoms and disability
are common manifestations of severity of illness in older
persons. Fourth, proxies completed a substantial minority of
the monthly interviews. The relatively high concordance
between proxy and participant reports for restricting symp-
toms and disability diminishes this limitation, which is
inherent in end-of-life studies.
Our study included monthly assessments of restricting
symptoms and disability over an extended period of time,
with little missing data and few losses to follow-up for
reasons other than death. To our knowledge, comparable
data are available in no other study. Additional strengths
of the study include the high participation rate and use of
Medicare claims to ascertain hospice admissions. Our
focus on symptoms leading to restricted activity and dis-
ability
in
basic,
instrumental,
and
mobility
activities
enhances the clinical relevance of our findings because

 proper management of these symptoms and disabilities
may substantially improve quality of life while reducing
caregiver burden.
In summary, hospice services appear to be suitably
targeted to older persons with the greatest needs at the
end of life, although the short duration of hospice suggests
that additional strategies are needed to better address the
high burden of distressing symptoms and disability at the
end of life.
