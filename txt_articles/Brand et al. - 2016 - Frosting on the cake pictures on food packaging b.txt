Abstract
Objective: Food packaging often pictures supplementary extras, such as toppings
or frosting, that are not listed on the nutritional labelling. The present study aimed
to assess if these extras might exaggerate how many calories† are pictured and if
they lead consumers to overserve.
Design: Four studies were conducted in the context of fifty-one different cake
mixes. For these cake mixes, Study 1 compared the calories stated on the nutrition
label with the calories of the cake (and frosting) pictured on the box. In Studies 2,
3 and 4, undergraduates (Studies 2 and 3) or food-service professionals (Study 4)
were given one of these typical cake mix boxes, with some being told that cake
frosting was not included on the nutritional labelling whereas others were
provided with no additional information. They were then asked to indicate what
they believed to be a reasonable serving size of cake.
Settings: Laboratory setting.
Subjects: Undergraduate students and food-service professionals.
Results: Study 1 showed that the average calories of cake and frosting pictured on
the package of fifty-one different cake mixes exceed the calories on the nutritional
label by 134 %. Studies 2 and 3 showed that informing consumers that the
nutritional information does not include frosting reduces how much people serve.
Study 4 showed that even food-service professionals overserve if not told that
frosting is not included on the nutritional labelling.
Conclusions: To be less misleading, packaging should either not depict extras in
its pictures or it should more boldly and clearly state that extras are not included in
calorie counts.

Nutritional labels are designed to promote healthy food
choices and serving sizes(1). However, 70 % of consumers
routinely ignore these labels(2,3), causing researchers to
question to their effectiveness(4). This is particularly
troubling for serving size. Although large serving sizes
contribute to obesity(5), consumers still tend to ignore
serving size information and serve larger portions than
recommended(6). If labels do not drive serving sizes,
what does?
Consumers are heavily influenced by external cues in
their environment when deciding how much to eat(7): they
are influenced by what they believe as convenient,
attractive and normal to serve(8). What people consider
a normal portion may be partly influenced by the
manufacturer(9). One of the most salient cues is the size of
packaging from which a person serves himself or herself.
This effect is often referred to as the ‘pack size effect’ and
is characterized by the fact that large packages cause
consumers to consume more of a product they serve
themselves or of a product for which an exaggerated
portion has been provided(10,11). The pack size effect has
been demonstrated with both meal- and snack-related
foods(12), and also with stale foods. In a study of movie-
goers in a Philadelphia suburb, those who were given a
large-sized bucket of stale, 2-week-old popcorn ate more
than those who were given a medium-sized bucket.
Combined with the fact that package and portion sizes
have increased over the years(13), it is argued that the

 pack size effect significantly contributes to the growing
obesity epidemic(14).
The
most
parsimonious
explanation
for
why
large packages lead to increased consumption is that they
suggest a larger consumption norm; they implicitly suggest
that it is common to consume a larger amount of food than
is appropriate(7). Although the majority of evidence in
favour of this hypothesis has focused on manipulating the
size of the package, pictures that appear on the package
also have the potential to increase consumption norms.
Studies reveal that food shown on packaging often
exaggerates the recommended serving size which causes
consumers to unknowingly overserve. When compared
with the recommended serving size, the majority of ice
cream containers display pictures of ice cream that are,
on average, 130 % more(15). Additionally, when these
containers were shown to consumers, they served more
ice cream than when shown ice cream containers that had
been modified to reflect a single recommended portion.
If what is seen can be more powerful than what is said,
these effects should be even stronger for what is seen and not
said. This is the case with many of the extras that are depicted
on packaging such as sauces on main dishes, syrup on
pancakes, dips with chips, sprinkles on ice creams and
frosting on cake. How might these extras exaggerate how
many calories are pictured and do they lead consumers to eat
more calories than they otherwise would? Such findings
could have wide relevance to consumer welfare, company
packaging policies and to policies from federal organizations
that control labelling, such as the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. Depending on how widespread or significant the
practices are and depending on how they influence con-
sumers, it may mean that simply altering packaging pictures
or clarifying the depicted calories could have an immediate
impact on either what or how much consumers eat.
Exaggerating
consumption
norms
may
legitimize
increased consumption by leading people to unsuspectingly
follow the norm set out by the manufacturer(8,9). Thus, when
a consumer continuously perceives a high consumption
norm, as in the case with exaggerated serving size food
visuals, it may permanently bias the consumer to adopt a
higher consumption norm than what is recommended.
Given this, it is important to understand the components of
food visuals that have the potential to lead consumers to
perceive a larger serving size. To determine if pictured
extras on a package have the potential to suggest a larger
consumption norm, we first conducted an exploratory study
that examined how the addition of frosting on cake
packages increases the number of calories shown compared
with the recommended calories based on the recommended
serving size. If frosting exaggerates the number of calories
shown then this could cause consumers to unknowingly
overserve. In two follow-up studies, we tested this hypoth-
esis by examining the effect that exaggerated frosting visuals
has on single serving size calorie estimations and whether
they cause consumers to serve more cake. In a final study,
we examined the robustness of this effect by testing whether
exaggerated frosting visuals cause food professionals to
overserve.
An
increase
in
intended
serving
size
in
this population would demonstrate that even the most
nutritionally savvy consumers are not immune to the effects
of supplementary extras on how much a person serves.

written consent prior to participating. Study 1 is an
observational study that did not involve human participants.
Study 1: Do the calories pictured on packaging
exceed the calories stated on the nutrition label?
Method
Study 1 investigated how showing a supplementary product –
frosting on a piece of cake – could potentially bias the
serving size information that is found on the nutritional
labelling. We identified cake brands and flavours by
documenting the most common brands found at three US
grocery retailers (Target, Walmart and Wegmans). These
included cake mixes from Betty Crocker (n 20), Duncan
Hines (n 18) and Pillsbury (n 13). Packages were restricted to
only those with images of one slice from a round cake.
The dimensions of the slice of cake on the package
were measured, including height, length and arc length.
Arc length was measured by using a string to trace along
the curve of the cake. Arc length was then calculated using
the equation θ = ðπ = 180Þ ´ r, where r is the radius of the
arc. To determine actual arc length factoring in enlarge-
ment, we calculated an enlargement factor (EF) using the
equation EF = 1 = ðMSL = CSLÞ, where MSL is the measured
slice length and CSL is the calculated slice length. In our
calculation, we used a CSL of 4 inches based on the
assumption that an 8 inch pan was used.* Circumference
was calculated and divided by EF and serving size to
determine the arc length of one serving.
We then determined how much frosting was pictured by
calculating the surface area of the slice. We first measured the
thickness of the frosting by measuring the side of the cake
(A), the top (B) and in between the layers (C). Our mea-
surements A, B and C were multiplied by EF to get estimated
dimensions. Surface area was then calculated using the
following
equation:
surface area = 2πrhA + πr2B + πr2C,
where h is height. The resulting value was multiplied by
grams per square inch and multiplied by calories per gram to
get total frosting calories pictured. The sum of the cake cal-
ories and frosting calories resulted in total calories pictured.
* Cake boxes contain directions for preparing the mix based on different
size pans (e.g. 8 inch (20 cm), 9 inch (23 cm) and 12 inch (30 cm) pans). As
such, it is important to factor in the pan size when calculating depicted
serving size. For the present paper, a baking pan size of 8 inches was
assumed and corrected for by applying the appropriate magnification
factor.

 Results and discussion
Study 1 results are shown in Table 1. When cake calcu-
lations were based solely on the cake, cake boxes did not
display significantly more calories than what is recom-
mended (t (51) = 1·86, P = 0·068), a decrease of 5·13 %.
Breaking down by brand, only Duncan Hines exaggerated
the number of calories shown, displaying 19·89 % more
(t (17) = 4·05, P < 0·001). Both Betty Crocker and Pillsbury
displayed fewer calories than what is recommended,
14·91 %
and
19·00 %,
respectively
(t (19) = 10·08,
P < 0·001) and t (12) = 43·69, P < 0·001).
In contrast, when frosting was included in the calculation,
all cake mix boxes exaggerated the amount of calories
associated with a serving size. On average, cake mix
containers displayed 134·82 % more calories than what is
recommended (t (50) =14·05, P < 0·001). Duncan Hines
brand displayed 209·17% more calories (t (17)=12·93,
P <0·001); Betty Crocker displayed 102·61 % more calories
(t (19) =11·30, P <0·001); and Pillsbury depicted 87·31 %
more calories (t (19) =9·31, P <0·001).
When the number of calories for a piece of cake was
calculated without frosting, 5·13 % fewer calories were
shown than what is recommended. However, when
frosting was included, cake depictions displayed 134·82 %
more calories than what is recommended. Although it is
not surprising that the addition of a calorie-heavy sup-
plement increases the number of calories shown, the
addition of frosting as a supplementary product potentially
suggests it is appropriate to consume a larger number of
calories than what is recommended. Study 2 examined
whether the perception of calories per serving is biased by
the depictions of extras on packaging. If the addition of
frosting suggests a larger consumption norm, then con-
sumers will indicate that it is appropriate to consume a
larger number of calories per serving.
Study 2: Do people take extra ingredient calories
into account when determining serving size?
Method
Participants were forty-five undergraduates from Cornell
University who received partial course credit for their
participation. Undergraduates were provided with two
types of cake mix boxes and asked to estimate the
appropriate number of calories to consume in a single
serving. Fifteen undergraduates in the information condi-
tion and fifteen undergraduates in the no information
condition were presented with a Duncan Hines and a Betty
Crocker cake mix box used in Study 1 (they displayed a
picture of cake with frosting). Fifteen undergraduates in the
control condition were presented with the same cake mix
boxes with the exception that the cake image was altered
so that it did not contain frosting (it displayed a picture of
cake only). Undergraduates in the information condition
were told that recommended serving size did not include
frosting and were presented with the following text:
If you were to serve yourself a single serving of cake
made from this mix, please estimate the number of
calories you believe is an appropriate amount to
consume. Please keep in mind, that the frosting
shown on the front of the packaging is not included
on the nutritional labeling.
Undergraduates in the no information condition were
provided with the same text, with the exception that the
frosting information was removed. Undergraduates in the
control condition saw the same text as the no information
group. Thus, there were a total of two estimations per
person, one for each type of cake mix, and the order in
which cake brand was shown was counterbalanced.
Results and discussion
Study 2 results are shown in Table 2. Group estimations
were entered into a 3 ×2 mixed-model ANOVA. There was
a significant main effect of condition. Calorie estimations
were lowest for those who were shown a cake package
with no frosting (F (2, 42) =3·75, P =0·041). There was no
difference in calorie estimations between the cake mix
brands (478·78 v. 478·53 kcal; F (2, 42) =0·001, P =0·994)
and there was also no significant interaction between the
groups (F (2, 42)=0·030, P =0·970). Planned comparisons
showed that of the participants who were shown cake with
frosting packages, the number of calories estimated by
Table 1 Mean calorie calculations for pictorial representations of cake only and cake with frosting pictured on the front of fifty-one cake
packages in Study 1. Depicting frosting on the front of packaging adds 134% more calories than the serving size recommendation found on
the nutritional labelling (‘calories’ = kcal; 1 kcal = 4·184 kJ)

 people who were told no additional information was
higher than by those who were told that frosting was not
included on the nutritional labelling (593·07 v. 435·67kcal;
t (28)=1·79, P =0·04). Interestingly, there was no difference
in calorie estimations between those who were shown
packages with cake and frosting, but told that frosting was
not included, and those who were shown packages with
cake only (407·23 v. 435·67 kcal; t (28)= 0·37, P =0·710).
In general, people do not take extra ingredients such as
frosting into account when considering how many calories
to serve. Specifically, there are two important findings from
Study 2. The first is that compared with packages with both
images of cake with frosting and serving size text infor-
mation, participants who saw packages with only images of
cake and frosting indicated that it is appropriate to consume
more calories per serving. The second is that there was no
significant difference in calorie estimations between parti-
cipants who were shown packages with cake and frosting,
but no serving size text information, and participants who
were shown packages with cake, but no frosting. Together,
this suggests that the addition of frosting that is not included
on the nutritional labelling causes an increase in what
people believe is an appropriate amount of calories to
consume per serving. Study 3 tested whether exaggerated
frosting visuals cause consumers to overserve.
Study 3: Would clear labelling about extra
ingredients reduce serving size norms?
Method
Seventy-two undergraduates who did not participate in
Study 2 received partial course credit for their participa-
tion. Participants were presented with an unmodified box
of Duncan Hines cake mix (that included a picture of cake
with frosting) and asked to indicate what they thought
would be a normal serving size. To facilitate this, partici-
pants were shown cake slices (including frosting) that
were pre-cut into individual portions that varied in size in
approximate 100-kcal increments (100 to 1200 kcal).
Twenty-four participants were presented with a package
showing cake with frosting and twenty-four participants
were presented with a package showing a cake with
frosting with the words ‘frosting not included on the
nutritional labeling’. In a control condition, twenty-four
participants were shown a modified cake package that
showed a piece of cake, with no frosting and no other text
information present. All undergraduates were presented
with the following text:
In front of you are pieces of cake that are made from
the box cake mix that is directly in front of the cake
slices. Please take a moment to look at the cake mix
box. If you were to select a piece of cake to eat,
please select the slice of cake that you believe is an
appropriate single serving size.

(F (2,

pants were shown a piece of cake with frosting, intended
serving size was lower if the packaging contained the
message ‘frosting not included on the nutritional labeling’
(1083 v. 600 kcal; t (46) = 8·43, P = 0·001), an increase of
approximately 483 kcal.
Similar to Study 2, there was no significant difference in
intended serving size between participants who saw cake
with no frosting and participants who saw cake with frosting
and the phrase ‘frosting not included on the nutritional
labeling’ (595 v. 600kcal; t (46)=0·942, P=0·907).

 The
results
of
Study
3
are
consistent
with
our
hypothesis that showing supplementary products causes
an increase in serving size. However, the use of an
undergraduate
student
sample
limits
are
ability
to
generalize to all consumers. Thus, in Study 4, we
investigated whether the showing of frosting causes food
industry professionals to also serve more cake. If it
does, then this would provide strong evidence that
depiction of supplementary extras causes an increase in
what people believe is an appropriate amount of food to
consume during a single serving.
Study 4: Would labelling about extra ingredients
reduce serving size norms in nutritionally savvy
consumers?
Method
Participants were forty-four conference attendees in the
food-service industry (aged 19–53 years; 80% females) who
volunteered their participation. All procedures were identical
to Study 3, with the exception that there was no condition in
which participants saw a cake package with only cake and
no frosting. The control condition was removed because
Studies 2 and 3 showed that the effect of exaggerated
frosting visuals is not present in that condition. Participants
were presented with a box of Duncan Hines cake mix and
asked to indicate what they thought would be a normal
serving size. Twenty-two participants were presented with a
package
showing
cake
with
frosting
and
twenty-two
participants were presented with package showing a cake
with frosting and the words ‘frosting not included on the
nutritional labeling’.
Results and discussion
Results for Study 3 are shown Fig. 2. Serving sizes were
higher when participants were not told about the addition of
frosting than when they were (575 v. 453kcal; t (42)=1·92,
P=0·061), an increase of approximately 122kcal. Study 3 is
thus
consistent
with
our
hypothesis
that
showing
supplementary products not listed on the nutritional labelling
causes an increase in intended serving size.
Even though participants in Study 4 were professional
food-service workers, they were still influenced to overstate
a serving size unless explicitly told that the supplementary
extras are not included in what is stated on the label. This
shows that these biases are strong enough to unconsciously
influence even the most nutritionally savvy and vigilant
consumers.
General discussion
Our four studies show that the addition of supplementary
frosting to cake packaging causes an increase in serving
size intention. Study 1 shows that pictures of cake shown
on packaging correspond to the recommended serving
size found on the nutritional labelling; however, the
addition of frosting, which is not listed on the nutritional
labelling, increases the number of calories shown by
134·82 %. Study 2 shows that perceived serving size
calories is lower when participants are told that frosting is
not included on nutritional labelling than when they are
told nothing. Study 3 shows that intended serving size is
also lower when packaging contains the message that
frosting is not part of the nutritional information than when
the packaging contains no message. Finally Study 4 shows
that even food-service professionals overserve when not
explicitly told that frosting is not included on the
nutritional
labelling,
suggesting
that
even
the
most
nutritionally educated consumers are affected by the
showing of supplementary extras.
The present results are consistent
with emerging
literature demonstrating that a pictorial representation of
products
appearing
on
packaging
affects
serving
size(15–17). Given the suggestion that increased portion
sizes contribute to the obesity epidemic(5), these results
have important implications for policy officials. To date,
policy officials have targeted serving size by referencing
numerical
labels;
however, these
interventions
have
shown limited effectiveness. The present results suggest
that a more effective way to convey appropriate serving
size information is to combine appropriate serving size
depictions with a clear message about what is included on
the nutritional labelling.
Relatedly,
these
findings
also
have
important
implications for food manufacturers that wish to promote
healthy
serving
sizes.
Recent
efforts
to
promote
appropriate
serving sizes
have
focused
on
creating
multipacks that contain premium-priced individualized
portions(18,19). However, the increased cost of producing
this packaging is often passed on to the consumer.

J Brand et al.
 A potentially more cost-effective way to promote healthy
serving sizes is to explicitly state what is included in the
nutritional
information.
Although
this
proposition
is
supported by the present results, future research is needed
to better understand how visually appropriate serving size
images (and messages) interact with other factors that
are known to influence how much a person serves
(e.g. convenience).
There are several limitations that can be addressed with
future research. First, the present work examined the effect
of adding a calorie-heavy, complementary product on
serving size. It might be interesting to examine how
the perceived healthiness of a supplementary product
influences serving size. Given the ubiquitous presence of
halo effects(20), it is possible that serving size of a particular
product (e.g. a piece of carrot cake) is differentially affected
by showing a healthy complementary product (e.g. a carrot)
compared with an unhealthy complementary product
(e.g. frosting). Second, we did not study consumption
behaviour. Thus, it is possible that after overserving
participants nevertheless do not consume all the food.
However, we interpret this possibility as unlikely. Con-
sumers consume approximately 92 % of what they serve(21)
and
increased
portion
sizes
lead
to
increased
food
consumption(22).
Conclusion
Given that the rise in obesity is associated with increased
consumption that is partly due to increasing serving size, it
is useful to understand what controllable factors influence
how much a person serves. The studies reported here show
that the addition of an extra or supplementary product –
cake frosting – that is not included on the nutritional
labelling causes people to serve more food. Fortunately,
however, if people are alerted that such an extra is not
included in the calorie count for the portion servings, they
reduce how much they think is appropriate to eat.
Although demonstrated in the context of cake frosting,
this misleading practice of picturing extra calories on
packaging is relevant for sauces on foods, toppings and
other supplemental extras. To be less misleading and to
help
consumers
make
more
informed
serving
size
decisions, manufacturers should explicitly state what is
included in the nutritional information.
