BACKGROUND
In most patients with type 1 diabetes, adequate glycemic control is not achieved with 
insulin therapy alone. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of sotagliflozin, an oral 
inhibitor of sodium–glucose cotransporters 1 and 2, in combination with insulin treat-
ment in patients with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS
In this phase 3, double-blind trial, which was conducted at 133 centers worldwide, we 
randomly assigned 1402 patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving treatment with 
any insulin therapy (pump or injections) to receive sotagliflozin (400 mg per day) or 
placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level lower than 
7.0% at week 24, with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis after 
randomization. Secondary end points included the change from baseline in glycated 
hemoglobin level, weight, systolic blood pressure, and mean daily bolus dose of insulin.
RESULTS
A significantly larger proportion of patients in the sotagliflozin group than in the pla-
cebo group achieved the primary end point (200 of 699 patients [28.6%] vs. 107 of 703 
[15.2%], P<0.001). The least-squares mean change from baseline was significantly 
greater in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group for glycated hemoglobin 
(difference, −0.46 percentage points), weight (−2.98 kg), systolic blood pressure 
(−3.5 mm Hg), and mean daily bolus dose of insulin (−2.8 units per day) (P≤0.002 for 
all comparisons). The rate of severe hypoglycemia was similar in the sotagliflozin group 
and the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 2.4% [17], respectively). The rate of 
documented hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level of 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol 
per liter) or below was significantly lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo 
group. The rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was higher in the sotagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 0.6% [4], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving insulin, the proportion of 
patients who achieved a glycated hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% with no severe hy-
poglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis was larger in the group that received sotagliflozin 
than in the placebo group. However, the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was higher in the 
sotagliflozin group. (Funded by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals; inTandem3 ClinicalTrials.gov

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he incidence of type 1 diabetes, 
which currently affects 29 million adults 
worldwide, is rising.1 In the United States, 
the number of patients with type 1 diabetes who 
are younger than 20 years of age may triple 
within 30 years.2 Less than one third of adults 
with type 1 diabetes achieve a glycated hemoglo-
bin level lower than 7.0%, and most are over-
weight or obese.3-5 Patients with type 1 diabetes 
also face risks of complications or death from 
severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.6-10 
The ideal treatment for type 1 diabetes should 
enable patients to maintain a glycated hemoglo-
bin level lower than 7.0% without weight gain or 
an increased risk of hypoglycemia and diabetic 
ketoacidosis.
Sotagliflozin (LX4211) is a new oral inhibitor of 
sodium–glucose cotransporters 1 and 2 (SGLT1 
and SGLT2). SGLT1 inhibition reduces glucose 
absorption in the proximal intestine, which sig-
nificantly blunts and delays postprandial hyper-
glycemia. SGLT2 inhibition decreases renal glucose 
reabsorption.11-13 In phase 2 studies, the admin-
istration of sotagliflozin improved glycemic con-
trol and lowered body weight among patients 
with type 1 or 2 diabetes; it also reduced glyce-
mia, despite a decreased bolus dose of insulin, 
among patients with type 1 diabetes.14,15 No oral 
medication has been approved for use in combi-
nation with insulin to lower the glucose level in 
patients with type 1 diabetes. We report the re-
sults of the inTandem3 trial, a phase 3 clinical 
trial that assessed the effects of sotagliflozin as 
compared with placebo with respect to glycemic 
control and the occurrence of severe hypoglyce-
mia and diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with 
type 1 diabetes who were receiving their usual 
insulin therapy.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial, which was conducted 
at 133 sites in 19 countries, evaluated the safety 
and efficacy of sotagliflozin in combination 
with insulin therapy (pump or injections) in pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes. After a 2-week, single-
blind run-in period during which all patients 
received placebo, eligible patients were randomly 
assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either sota-
gliflozin (400 mg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks. 
Efficacy and safety were assessed at prespecified 
times during the treatment period, and a final 
safety assessment was performed 30 days after the 
last dose of the trial regimen was administered.
The institutional review board at each trial 
center approved the protocol (available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org) and the con-
sent form. All patients provided written informed 
consent before participation. An independent 
clinical end-point committee, whose members 
were unaware of the treatment assignments, 
adjudicated events of special interest, including 
severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, major 
adverse cardiovascular events, drug-induced liver 
injury, and death. An independent data and safety 
monitoring committee reviewed adverse events. 
An independent statistician performed the statis-
tical analysis. The trial was sponsored by Lexicon 
Pharmaceuticals and was conducted as a collabo-
ration between the sponsor and an academic 
steering committee. A clinical research organi-
zation (Covance) executed the trial. The first and 
last authors wrote the first draft of the manu-
script with medical-writing assistance (funded 
by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals). All the authors had 
full access to the trial data and participated in 
preparing the manuscript for submission (for fur-
ther details, see the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org). The first author made 
the decision to submit the manuscript for publi-
cation and vouches for the completeness and 
accuracy of the data and analysis and the fidel-
ity of the trial to the protocol.
Patients
Men and nonpregnant women 18 years of age 
or older who had had type 1 diabetes for at least 
1 year were eligible for participation in the trial 
if they met the following inclusion criteria: treat-
ment with insulin at a stable basal dose for at 
least 2 weeks before the screening visit, a glycated 
hemoglobin level of 7.0 to 11.0%, and a body-
mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters) of at least 
18.5. All the patients were required to perform 
self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. Key ex-
clusion criteria were severe hypoglycemia or dia-
betic ketoacidosis during the previous month, 
two or more episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis 
during the previous 6 months, and an estimated 
glomerular filtration rate lower than 45 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area. (For a

Effects of Sotagliflozin Added to Insulin
complete list of enrollment criteria, see the Sup-
plementary Appendix.)
Procedures
In the sotagliflozin group, patients received the 
400-mg dose of sotagliflozin as two 200-mg 
oral tablets, which they took once daily before 
the first meal of the day. In the placebo group, 
patients took two matching placebo tablets in 
the same manner. The patients continued their 
existing regimens with any approved insulin, 
except on the day that they received the first 
dose of the trial regimen, when they received a 
30% lower dose of mealtime insulin for the first 
meal.14 Investigators subsequently adjusted insu-
lin doses to meet target blood glucose levels 
during self-monitoring (fasting or preprandial 
target level, 80 to 130 mg per deciliter [4.4 to 
7.2 mmol per liter]; 2-hour or peak postprandial 
target level, <180 mg per deciliter [10.0 mmol 
per liter]). (For further details about insulin-dose 
algorithms, see the Supplementary Appendix.) 
Investigators could individualize target levels, and 
use of devices for personal continuous glucose 
monitoring was allowed. Results of laboratory 
tests for glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma 
and urinary glucose levels were masked to trial 
staff after randomization. From week 16 until 
the end of the trial, investigators were informed 
about glycated hemoglobin levels higher than 
11.0% so that necessary changes could be imple-
mented. Investigators maintained patients’ base-
line antihypertensive medications until week 16, 
unless patient safety was compromised.
All the trial participants received information 
about the detection and treatment of ketosis and 
about urogenital hygiene, proper hydration, the 
use of urinary ketone strips, and the use of 
β-hydroxybutyrate meters and strips. Trial centers 
received recommendations for the diagnosis and 
management of ketosis and diabetic ketoacido-
sis (for further details, see the Supplementary 
Appendix).
End Points
The primary end point was a glycated hemoglo-
bin level lower than 7.0% at week 24, with no 
episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic keto-
acidosis after randomization. Prespecified sec-
ondary end points were the change from base-
line to week 24 in glycated hemoglobin level, 
body weight, and mean daily bolus dose of insu-
lin (based on the doses administered during the 
3 to 5 days before the trial visit, including 
correction doses) and the change from baseline 
to week 16 in systolic blood pressure among 
patients who had a systolic blood pressure of 
130 mm Hg or higher at baseline.
Other prespecified end points were defined 
according to various combinations of the follow-
ing criteria: a threshold for glycated hemoglobin 
level (i.e., a level <7.0% or a ≥0.5% reduction in 
the level from baseline), a threshold for body 
weight, and no episode of severe hypoglycemia 
or diabetic ketoacidosis. Single end points includ-
ed the change from baseline to week 16 in dia-
stolic blood pressure and the change from base-
line to week 24 in fasting plasma glucose level, 
urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, calcium-to-
creatinine ratio, glucose-to-creatinine ratio, serum 
creatinine level, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, and mean daily total and basal doses of 
insulin, as well as the number of documented 
hypoglycemic events (on the basis of blood glu-
cose levels of ≤70 mg per deciliter [3.9 mmol per 
liter] and of ≤55 mg per deciliter [3.1 mmol per 
liter] during self-monitoring). The two thresholds 
for hypoglycemia were based on thresholds com-
monly used in previous trials for type 1 diabetes.
Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a hypo-
glycemic event that required assistance from an-
other person or resulted in loss of consciousness 
or a seizure, regardless of the patient’s glucose 
level. The diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis was 
based on the presence of anion-gap metabolic 
acidosis related to excessive ketone production 
without an alternative cause. (For detailed defi-
nitions, see the Supplementary Appendix.)
Safety information, including clinical and 
laboratory values and data on adverse events, 
was collected at each trial visit and during a final 
assessment, which was performed 30 days after 
the last dose of the trial regimen was adminis-
tered. The rates of serious adverse events, adverse 
events of special interest, death, and discon-
tinuation due to adverse events were recorded. 
Acidosis-related adverse events were prespecified.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy and safety analyses were performed in 
the modified intention-to-treat population, which 
included all patients who underwent randomiza-
tion and received at least one dose of the trial 
regimen. We assessed the superiority of sota-

gliflozin (400 mg per day) versus placebo with 
respect to the primary end point. We estimated 
that a sample size of 700 patients per trial group 
would give the trial at least 90% power to detect 
a target effect size in binomial proportions of 
approximately 0.10 for the primary end point, 
assuming that 50% of the participants overall 
would achieve the primary end point (i.e., an 
estimate that yielded a maximum sample size 
independent of the response rate among patients 
receiving placebo). This sample size would also 
allow a large enough safety population to reli-
ably estimate between-group differences in rates 
of severe hypoglycemia. For the primary and 
secondary efficacy variables, the null hypothesis 
of no treatment effect was tested at a two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05. To control the overall type I 
error rate across these tests, a hierarchical pro-
cedure was applied. In a sensitivity analysis, the 
influence of missing data was assessed through 
the application of the imputation method for 
nonresponse for the primary end point and 
through the application of several multiple im-
putation methods for the secondary end points. 
Categorical variables were analyzed as propor-
tions, and the results were summarized as a cor-
responding percentage point. Safety analyses were 
descriptive. (For further details about statistical 
methods, see the Supplementary Appendix.)
Results
Patient Characteristics
From October 2015 through September 2016, a 
total of 1405 patients underwent randomization; 
the trial was completed in April 2017. A total of 
1402 patients (699 in the sotagliflozin group 
and 703 in the placebo group) received at least 
one dose of the trial regimen and were included 
in the modified intention-to-treat population. 
Baseline characteristics of the patients in each 
trial group are shown in Table 1. (For further 
details, see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.)
Prespecified Efficacy End Points
A significantly larger proportion of patients in 
the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group 
achieved the primary end point of a glycated 
hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% at week 24 
and no severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoaci-
dosis (200 of 699 patients [28.6%] vs. 107 of 703 
[15.2%]) (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The estimated 
between-group difference was 13.4 percentage 
points (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0 to 17.8; 
P<0.001). Similarly, in the subgroup analysis ac-
cording to type of insulin therapy (pump vs. no 
pump), approximately twice as many patients in 
the sotagliflozin group as in the placebo group, 
both among those who used an insulin pump 
and those who did not, achieved the primary end 
point. Among patients who had a glycated hemo-
globin level of 7.0% or higher at week 24, the 
rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was significantly 
higher and the rate of severe hypoglycemia was 
nonsignificantly higher in the sotagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group (Table 2).
Significantly more patients in the sotagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group achieved a gly-
cated hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% (207 
patients [29.6%] vs. 111 [15.8%]). The reduction 
in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline 
to week 24 was significantly greater in the sota-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group (dif-
ference, −0.46 percentage points; P<0.001), and 
greater reductions occurred among patients with 
higher baseline levels (including levels ≥7.7%, 
>8.5%, and >9.0%) (Fig. 1). (For further details, 
see Fig. S2 and Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
A significantly larger proportion of patients 
in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo 
group achieved end points defined according to 
various combinations of the following criteria: 
a prespecified threshold for glycated hemoglo-
bin level (i.e., a level <7.0% or a ≥0.5% reduction 
in the level from baseline), a threshold for body 
weight (i.e., no weight gain or a >5% reduction 
in weight from baseline), and no episode of severe 
hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. A glycated 
hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% was achieved 
with no weight gain in 171 patients (24.5%) in 
the sotagliflozin group and 51 patients (7.3%) in 
the placebo group. Among patients in either trial 
group who achieved a target glycated hemoglo-
bin level, less than 2% had severe hypoglycemia 
and less than 2% had diabetic ketoacidosis; 
among those who had a 0.5% or greater reduc-
tion in the glycated hemoglobin level from base-
line, the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was signifi-
cantly higher in the sotagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group. (For further details, see Fig. S3 
and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.)

to week 24 was significantly greater in the sota-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group (dif-
ference, −2.98 kg; P<0.001). In the sotagliflozin 
group, the placebo-corrected reductions from 
baseline in the mean daily total, bolus, and 
basal doses of insulin were −5.3 units per day 
(−9.7%), −2.8 units per day (−12.3%), and −2.6 
units per day (−9.9%), respectively (P<0.001 for 
all comparisons). Among patients with a systolic 
blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher at base-
line, the reduction in systolic blood pressure 
from baseline to week 16 was significantly great-
er in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo 
group (difference, −3.5 mm Hg; P 
= 
0.002). In 
addition, in the modified intention-to-treat pop-
ulation, the reductions in the fasting plasma 
glucose level and in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure were significantly greater in the sota-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group, as 
were the increases in the calcium-to-creatinine 
ratio and glucose-to-creatinine ratio. However, 
the changes in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 
serum creatinine level, and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate did not differ significantly between

Results of sensitivity analyses, which were 
performed for the primary and secondary effi-
cacy end points with the use of various imputa-
tion methods, confirmed the results of the main 
analyses.
Documented Hypoglycemia
The percentage of patients who had an episode 
of documented hypoglycemia with a blood glu-
cose level of 70 mg per deciliter or lower was 
similar in the sotagliflozin group and the pla-
cebo group (96.3% [673 of 699 patients] and 
95.3% [670 of 703], respectively); the corre-
sponding event rates were 69.8 per person-year 
and 77.9 per person-year. The event rate of docu-
mented hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level 
of 55 mg per deciliter or below was significantly 
lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the pla-
cebo group (11.8 per person-year and 15.4 per 
person-year, respectively) (Table 3, and Table S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
The overall rate of adverse events (regardless of 
cause) was similar in the sotagliflozin group 
and the placebo group (55.1% [385 of 699 pa-
tients] and 52.5% [369 of 703], respectively) 
(Table 3). Most adverse events were mild to mod-

These results are from a post hoc analysis that was performed with the use of asymptotic methods to summarize the differences in binomial 
proportions without stratification according to randomization factors. The small number of events suggested that stratified tests would not 
be sensible. This category included patients who had an event of interest and a glycated hemoglobin value of 7.0% or higher at week 24 or 
missing data at the 24-week assessment.

Effects of Sotagliflozin Added to Insulin
erate in severity. Gastrointestinal events (consis-
tent with SGLT1 inhibition) and genital mycotic 
infections (consistent with SGLT2 inhibition) 
were more common in the sotagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group (Table 3, and Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Diarrhea oc-
curred in 29 patients (4.1%) in the sotagliflozin 
group and in 16 (2.3%) in the placebo group, 
and it led to discontinuation in 3 patients (0.4%) 
in the sotagliflozin group and none in the pla-
cebo group. Genital mycotic infection occurred 
in 45 patients (6.4%) in the sotagliflozin group 
and in 15 (2.1%) in the placebo group, and it led 
to discontinuation in less than 1% of patients 
in each trial group. Bone fractures occurred in 
4 and 5 patients in the sotagliflozin and placebo 
groups, respectively. No amputations were re-
ported during the trial.
More patients in the sotagliflozin group than 
in the placebo group had serious adverse events 
(48 patients [6.9%] vs. 23 [3.3%]), and more pa-
tients in the sotagliflozin group withdrew from 
the trial because of an adverse event (44 patients 
[6.3%] vs. 16 [2.3%]). One death (a suicide) oc-
curred in the sotagliflozin group and was judged 
to be unrelated to the trial drug. Two major ad-
verse cardiovascular events occurred in the sota-
gliflozin group.
One or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia 
occurred in 21 patients (3.0%) in the sotagliflozin 
group and in 17 (2.4%) in the placebo group. 
Among patients who used an insulin pump, one 
or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia oc-
curred in more patients in the sotagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group (10 of 275 pa-
tients [3.6%] vs. 5 of 280 [1.8%]); the numbers 
among those who did not use an insulin pump 
were similar in the two groups (11 of 424 pa-
tients [2.6%] and 12 of 423 [2.8%], respectively). 
The trial regimen was discontinued due to se-
vere hypoglycemia in 2 patients in the sota-
gliflozin group and in 1 in the placebo group.
The rate of acidosis-related adverse events at 
week 24 was 8.6% in the sotagliflozin group and 
2.4% in the placebo group. The rate of one or 
more positively adjudicated episodes of diabetic 
ketoacidosis was higher in the sotagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group overall (3.0% vs. 
0.6%), as well as among those who used an in-
sulin pump (4.4% vs. 0.7%) and those who did 
not use an insulin pump (2.1% vs. 0.5%). The 
trial regimen was discontinued due to an adjudi-
cated diabetic ketoacidosis event in 11 patients 
(1.6%) in the sotagliflozin group and in 1 (0.1%) 
in the placebo group.
Discussion
In the inTandem3 trial involving patients with 
type 1 diabetes who were receiving any approved 
insulin, the percentage of patients who achieved 
the primary end point of a glycated hemoglobin 
level lower than 7.0% at week 24 and no episode 
of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis 
was higher in the group that received sota-
gliflozin than in the placebo group (28.6% vs. 
15.2%). However, the rates of diabetic ketoacido-
sis and hypoglycemia were higher in the sota-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group. The 
use of sotagliflozin was also associated with 
significant decreases in glycated hemoglobin 
level, fasting plasma glucose level, insulin dose, 
weight, and systolic blood pressure.
Roughly two thirds of adult patients with 
type 1 diabetes have a glycated hemoglobin level 
of 7.0% or higher, and up to two thirds are over-
weight or obese.3-5 The baseline characteristics 
of the patients in our trial are consistent with 
these data; 71% of the patients had a baseline 
BMI of 25 or higher, and by design, all patients 
who underwent randomization had a glycated 
hemoglobin level of 7.0% or higher at screening. 
Reductions in the glycated hemoglobin level are 
usually associated with an increased incidence 
of hypoglycemia and weight gain.16 However, the 
target glycated hemoglobin level (<7.0%) was 
achieved in approximately twice as many patients 
in the sotagliflozin group as in the placebo 
group, and the target level was achieved without 
weight gain in three times as many patients in 
the sotagliflozin group as in the placebo group.
A composite end point of a glycated hemoglo-
bin level lower than 7.0% and no hypoglycemia 
or weight gain is often used in studies of medi-
cations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.17 
The primary end point in our trial was estab-
lished to assess for a net clinical benefit of 
achieving a target glycated hemoglobin level 
(<7.0%) in the absence of severe hypoglycemia 
and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, this end 
point did not assess for the absence or presence 
of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis

Effects of Sotagliflozin Added to Insulin
among patients in the sotagliflozin group who 
did not achieve a glycated hemoglobin level lower 
than 7.0%.
In phase 2 trials, sotagliflozin, empagliflozin, 
and canagliflozin were associated with signifi-
cant decreases in the glycated hemoglobin level 
among patients with type 1 diabetes.14,18,19 The 
design of our phase 3 trial allowed us to evaluate 
the effects of sotagliflozin in combination with 
insulin therapy in a setting that resembles day-
to-day clinical practice. By week 24, the differ-
ence between the sotagliflozin group and the 
placebo group in the reduction of the glycated 
hemoglobin level from baseline was 0.46 percent-
age points. Slightly more patients in the sota-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group had 
severe hypoglycemia (21 and 17 patients, respec-
tively), but the event rate (the rate per person-
year) of documented hypoglycemia, with a thresh-
old for blood glucose level of either ≤70 mg per 
deciliter or ≤55 mg per deciliter, was lower in 
the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo 
group. Modest but significant weight loss oc-
curred in the sotagliflozin group, possibly be-
cause of increased glycosuria, reduced insulin 
doses, or other unknown factors. Sotagliflozin 
treatment also led to significant reductions in 
blood pressure.

Data are for patients who received at least one dose of the trial regimen and include events that occurred up to 30 days 
after the last dose of the trial regimen was administered. For the definitions of volume-depletion events, renal events, 
and acidosis-related events, see the Supplementary Appendix.
†  
The death was a suicide that was judged to be unrelated to the trial drug.
‡  
Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a hypoglycemic event that required assistance from another person or resulted 
in loss of consciousness or a seizure, regardless of the patient’s glucose level. Documented hypoglycemia was defined 
as a blood glucose level of 70 mg per deciliter or lower, with or without symptoms. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was de-
fined as a hypoglycemic event that occurred between midnight and 5:59 a.m., regardless of whether the patient was 
awake during the event. Hypoglycemia was considered to be an event of special interest, with a specialized case-report 
form. Because the analysis for hypoglycemia was based on data recorded on this case-report form, investigators were 
asked not to report hypoglycemic events on the case-report form for adverse events unless the episode met criteria 
for a serious adverse event.
§ 
 
Percentages are based on the number of patients in the subgroup of patients who used a pump and the subgroup that 
did not use a pump, rather than on the total number of patients. In the sotagliflozin group, 275 patients used an insulin 
pump and 424 did not; in the placebo group, 280 patients used an insulin pump and 423 did not.
¶  
Diarrhea was mostly transient and mild-to-moderate.

These data are reported as events per person-year.
**  
All events of special interest that led to discontinuation were investigator-reported, except for severe hypoglycemia 
and diabetic ketoacidosis, which were adjudicated.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
gliptin, and metformin in patients with type 1 
diabetes have not shown consistent or sustained 
reductions in the glycated hemoglobin level or 
have shown increases in episodes of severe hypo-
glycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.20-23 The use of 
off-label adjunctive therapy is uncommon, and the 
only therapy other than insulin that is approved 
for the treatment of type 1 diabetes is injectable 
pramlintide, which modestly reduces the glycated 
hemoglobin level and weight but is associated 
with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia 
and is thus used infrequently.3,16,24 Reductions in 
the glycated hemoglobin level, systolic blood 
pressure, and weight must be maintained for a 
long-term period to reduce the risk of complica-
tions associated with diabetes, but mean changes 
in these outcomes may be less robust in short-
term studies. Therefore, the decision to use ad-
junctive therapy can currently be based only on 
clinical assessment of metabolic needs in patients 
in whom insulin alone is unlikely to be suffi-
ciently effective.
In our trial, the addition of sotagliflozin to 
existing insulin regimens improved glycemic con-
trol and led to reductions in the total, bolus, and 
basal doses of insulin. A decrease in insulin dose 
may be a risk factor for diabetic ketoacidosis.25,26
Regulatory authorities have required that warn-
ings about diabetic ketoacidosis be added to 
prescribing labels for the SGLT2 inhibitor class, 
because these agents have been associated with 
diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 or 
type 2 diabetes.19,26-34 When SGLT inhibitors are 
administered, monitoring for ketosis, particularly 
during metabolically stressful situations, is re-
quired.26,34 SGLT inhibitors should be discontin-
ued before scheduled surgical procedures, and 
patients and clinicians should remain in close 
consultation regarding other forms of behavior-
al and physiological stress.26,35 Diabetic ketoaci-
dosis may occur more frequently among those 
who use an insulin pump, because of kinked 
catheters, infusion-set problems, and other opera-
tional failures, and therefore, those who use an 
insulin pump may require closer monitoring.36,37 
The basal insulin formulations used in subcuta-
neous-injection regimens, which have a longer 
duration of action than the rapid-acting insulin 
analogues used in pump regimens, may mitigate 
the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Our trial has some limitations. First, the long-
term effects of sotagliflozin cannot be deter-
mined from this 24-week trial. Second, data on 
glycated hemoglobin levels were masked to inves-
tigators after screening to make the trial design 
consistent with other trials of sotagliflozin, and 
if investigators had had access to the data, they 
may have adjusted insulin therapy more aggres-
sively to meet target glycated hemoglobin levels. 
Third, this trial employed measures to mitigate 
the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis that may have 
been more intensive than those used in typical 
clinical practice. Fourth, reductions in the gly-
cated hemoglobin level, fasting plasma glucose 
level, and episodes of documented hypoglycemia 
suggest decreased glucose variability, but data 
from continuous glucose monitoring were not 
analyzed in this trial. Blinded data from continu-
ous glucose monitoring will be analyzed in the 
recently completed inTandem1 and inTandem2 
trials (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02384941 
and NCT02421510, respectively). Fifth, no artifi-
cial pancreas system had been approved at the 
time of trial initiation. Since sotagliflozin treat-
ment was associated with a decrease in insulin 
dose, its use in patients who use a currently 
approved artificial pancreas system may require 
further evaluation.38,39
In summary, among adult patients with type 1 
diabetes who were receiving insulin therapy, the 
proportion of patients who achieved a glycated 
hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% and had no 
severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis was 
larger in the group that received sotagliflozin than 
in the placebo group. However, the rates of dia-
betic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia were 
higher among patients who received sotagliflozin 
but did not achieve the target glycated hemoglo-
bin level than among those who received placebo.
