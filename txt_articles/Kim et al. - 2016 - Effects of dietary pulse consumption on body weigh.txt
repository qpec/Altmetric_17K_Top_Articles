ABSTRACT
Background: Obesity is a risk factor for developing several dis-
eases, and although dietary pulses (nonoil seeds of legumes such
as beans, lentils, chickpeas, and dry peas) are well positioned to
aid in weight control, the effects of dietary pulses on weight loss
are unclear.
Objective: We summarized and quantified the effects of dietary
pulse consumption on body weight, waist circumference, and body
fat by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of random-
ized controlled trials.
Design: We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL,
and the Cochrane Library through 11 May 2015 for randomized
controlled trials of $3 wk of duration that compared the effects
of diets containing whole dietary pulses with those of comparator
diets without a dietary pulse intervention. Study quality was as-
sessed by means of the Heyland Methodologic Quality Score, and
risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data
were pooled with the use of generic inverse-variance random-effects
models.
Results: Findings from 21 trials (n = 940 participants) were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed an overall
significant weight reduction of 20.34 kg (95% CI: 20.63, 20.04 kg;
P = 0.03) in diets containing dietary pulses (median intake of 132 g/d
or w1 serving/d) compared with diets without a dietary pulse
intervention over a median duration of 6 wk. Significant weight
loss was observed in matched negative–energy-balance (weight
loss) diets (P = 0.02) and in neutral–energy-balance (weight-
maintaining) diets (P = 0.03), and there was low evidence of
between-study heterogeneity. Findings from 6 included trials also
suggested that dietary pulse consumption may reduce body fat
percentage.
Conclusions: The inclusion of dietary pulses in a diet may be
a beneficial weight-loss strategy because it leads to a modest
weight-loss effect even when diets are not intended to be calorically
restricted. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of
dietary pulses on long-term weight-loss sustainability. This protocol
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01594567.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity has become a global epidemic. Obesity is a major risk
factor for developing heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
and some cancers. According to the WHO, $2.8 million people
die each year as a result of complications of obesity, which

 makes it one of the leading risk factors for global deaths (1).
However, an important modifiable factor for obesity is the diet.
Previous studies have shown that the consumption of foods that
are high in fiber and protein and low in the glycemic index (GI)
promote weight loss and maintenance (2–4). Dietary pulses, the
edible nonoil seeds of legumes, such as beans, lentils, chickpeas,
and dry peas, are well positioned to aid in weight loss because
they possess all of these ideal nutritional qualities as well as
being low in saturated fat. Although the role of fiber and protein
on weight control has previously been summarized and sup-
ported, the specific role of dietary pulses is uncertain. In addi-
tion, there has been evidence that dietary pulses increase satiety
during meals; however, it is unclear whether this acute benefit
translates into longer-term weight loss (5). Experimental trials
have reported varying effects of dietary pulses on body weight
(6–11), and few observational studies have assessed the asso-
ciation between dietary pulse consumption and weight (11). The
only meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of dietary pulses on
weight was conducted in 2002 (with 8 trials) and failed to
support a role for dietary pulses reducing body weight (12).
However, this study did not clearly document a search and se-
lection strategy, which is a requirement for compliance with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses and is in need of an update because several trials have
been conducted since its publication in 2002.
Although the WHO has suggested the consumption of legumes
to help reduce risks of obesity (1), other dietary guidelines have not
provided a suggestive link between dietary pulse consumption and
healthy body weight. Instead, there have been only general
guidelines that have encouraged the frequent consumption of
dietary pulses and legumes often (13, 14). In addition, optimal
recommended daily intake is not known. To better inform
guidelines for populations with rising obesity rates, we conducted
a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials that have examined the effects of dietary pulse intake
compared with the effects of a comparator diet on body weight. We
further investigated the effects of dietary pulses on other measures
of adiposity such as waist circumference and body fat percentage.
METHODS
Our protocol followed the guideline of the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (15), and findings
are reported according to the guidelines of the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(16). This protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01594567.
Data sources and searches
We searched MEDLINE (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/
pmresources.html), Embase (https://www.embase.com), CINAHL
(https://health.ebsco.com/products/the-cinahl-database), and the
Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com/) through 11
May 2015 (see Supplemental Table 1 for the full search
strategies for MEDLINE and Embase, with similar terms used
for CINAHL and the Cochrane Library). The search was limited
to human studies and had no language restrictions. Reference
lists of selected studies and reviews were also searched to
identify additional articles.
Study selection
We included randomized controlled trials that investigated the
effect of exchanging whole dietary pulses for other dietary
components on body weight, waist circumference, or body fat
percentage in adults. Studies were excluded if they were not
randomized, had a diet duration of ,3 wk [adapted from the US
Food and Drug Administration’s minimum duration for the ef-
fects of a soy intervention on other health claims (17)], used
only dietary pulse extracts, or did not have the intention of using
a calorically matched comparator arm (isocaloric). In cases in
which other dietary components comprised part of the in-
tervention, dietary pulses needed to make up .50% of the in-
tervention. When multiple publications existed for the same
study, the article with the most information was included (n = 2).
Published abstracts were not included.
One reviewer (SJK) assessed the titles and abstracts of all
identified studies. All studies that were potentially eligible for the
systematic review after this assessment were reviewed in full text
independently by a second reviewer (VLC) with discrepancies
resolved by a senior author (RJdS) to obtain a consensus. The
interrater agreement was quantified with the use of a k score.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The 2 investigators independently extracted data from selected
studies with the use of a standardized extraction form that was
developed and piloted for use in other meta-analyses (18–21).
The extraction form outlined information that needed to be re-
corded such as study design, blinding, sample size, participant
characteristics, follow-up duration, types of dietary pulses used,
dose of dietary pulse intake, comparator diet or food, adherence
measures, macronutrient profile, funding source, and endpoint
data.
The quality of each study was determined with the use of the
Heyland Methodologic Quality Score (MQS), which scores the
study quality on the domains of random assignment, blinding,
dropout rate, sample-selection methods, analysis methods (in-
tention to treat or per protocol), and protocol descriptions (22).
Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed with the use of
the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (15). This tool determined the
level of bias as either low (proper methods taken to reduce bias),
high (improper methods creating bias), or unclear (insufficient
information provided to determine the bias level) on the basis
of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, in-
complete outcome data, and selective reporting. Authors were
only contacted if additional information was necessary (n = 8).
No ethical approval was required.
Statistical analysis
Baseline, end-of-study, and between-treatment differences in
body weight, waist circumference, or body fat were recorded as
means 6 SDs. If not provided, between-treatment differences in
change-from-baseline or end differences were calculated by
subtracting means, and variance measures such as SEs were
imputed with the use of published formulas (15). Missing SDs
were imputed with the use of the pooled SD from other studies
included in the analysis (15).
A generic inverse-variance method with random-effects
models was used to calculate pooled mean differences and 95%

 CIs. Random-effects models were preferred over fixed-effect
models even with no evidence of heterogeneity because random-
effects models yield more-conservative estimates in the setting of
between-studies heterogeneity. Change-from-baseline differences
were preferred over end differences except when within-individual
correlation coefficient values were missing. To mitigate a unit-of-
analysis error in the analysis of a study that contained 4 comparison
arms, we pooled the 3 intervention arms with the use of a weighted
mean to create a single pairwise comparison. In addition, we
present results separately according to the energy-balance setting
as follows: in a negative–energy-balance setting, both dietary
pulse and comparator arms were calorically restricted by 30–35%
of total energy (i.e., weight-loss diets), and in a neutral–energy-
balance setting, both dietary pulse and comparator arms had ca-
loric intakes intended to meet their total energy needs (i.e.,
weight-maintaining diets). The significance level for an effect was
set at P , 0.05.
We included crossover and parallel studies in the same pooled
analysis. A paired analysis was applied to the analysis of
crossover trials with the use of a within-individual correlation
coefficient between treatments of 0.5 as described by Elbourne
et al. (23). A sensitivity analysis was conducted with the use of
different correlation coefficient values (0.25 and 0.75) to test for
the robustness of the effect size. An additional sensitivity analysis
included the removal of each single study from the meta-analyses
one at a time and recalculation of the summary effect. An in-
fluential outlier was considered a study whose removal changed
the magnitude of the pooled effect by .10%.
Between-study heterogeneity was detected with the use of
Cochran’s Q statistic set at a significance level of P , 0.10
and was quantified with the use of the I2 statistic where I2 .
50% indicated a large amount of heterogeneity (15). Study
design–level sources of heterogeneity were investigated by
creating categorical subgroups according to a priori study-
design features including study quality (MQS ,8 or $8),
study design (parallel or crossover), dose of dietary pulses
given (,100 or $100 g/d), dietary pulse type (bean, chickpea,
lentil, pea, or mixed), follow-up duration (,12 or $12 wk),
saturated fat intake with a dietary pulse diet (,10% or
$10%), fiber intake with a dietary pulse diet (,28 or $28 g/d),
difference in saturated fat intake between the dietary pulse arm
and comparator arm (greater than or less than the median of
20.4%), difference in fiber intake in the dietary pulse arm
compared with in the comparator arm (greater than or less than
the median of 8 g/d), baseline BMI (in kg/m2; greater than or
less than the median of 30.2), and baseline body weight (greater
than or less than the median of 79.3 kg). We also investigated
whether the effect size was related to these a priori study-level
values of possible effect modifiers such as the dose of dietary
pulses, fiber intake, the change in fiber intake from baseline,
saturated fat intake, and the change in saturated fat intake from
baseline in the intervention arm. The significance of subgroup
differences was assessed with the use of a continuous meta-
regression analysis (P , 0.05). Publication bias was investigated
with the use of a visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s
and Begg’s tests. All analyses were conducted with the use of
RevMan version 5.2 software (The Nordic Cochrane Center, The
Cochrane Collaboration) except for the metaregression analyses
and tests for publication bias, which were conducted with the
use of STATA version 12 software (StataCorp LP).
RESULTS
Search results
We identified 2924 potentially eligible articles (Figure 1), of
which 2806 articles were excluded on the basis of the title or
abstract. In total, 118 publications were retrieved in full and
reviewed in duplicate to determine the final inclusion list. Of
these 118 studies, 99 reports were excluded, which yielded
a final total of 19 reports (with data for 21 trials) that were in-
cluded in our pooled analysis for body weight (24–42). The
search also yielded 6 reports that were included in our pooled
analysis for waist circumference (24, 25, 30, 31, 33, 42) and
body fat percentage (24, 25, 30–32, 42). The interrater k was
0.83 with 94% agreement.
Trial characteristics
Characteristics of all included trials are shown in Table 1. The
19 publications reported results from 21 different trials with 940
participants. Most participants were middle aged (median age:
51.3 y; IQR: 46.6–56.6 y) men and women (median ratio of men
to women: 1:0.9 in available trials). The median baseline BMI
across studies was 30.2 (IQR: 27.6–31.4). The median number
of participants per trial was 27 (IQR: 19–74) with a median
follow-up length of 6 wk (IQR: 4–12 wk). Two of the 9 cross-
over designed trials did not have a washout period (35, 37).
All studies were randomized; however, the crossover trials by
Anderson et al. (27) randomly assigned 3 groups of participants to
receive graded doses of dietary pulses followed by a control diet.
Because the treatment order was not randomly allocated, we used
individual subject data to assign participants to treatment groups
(stratified on weight and age), which minimized order effects and
allowed these data to be analyzed as 3 separate trials. Most of the
trial intervention arms used mixed (38%, n = 8) or bean dietary
pulse types (38%, n = 8), whereas some trials used chickpeas (19%,
n = 4), dried peas (10%, n = 2), or lentils (5%, n = 1) alone. The
median dose of dietary pulses given was 132 g/d [0.5–0.75 cups/d
or w1 serving/d (43, 44)] in cooked weight (IQR: 113–152 g/d).
In each of the trials, the dietary pulse intervention diet and
comparator diet were isocaloric (matched for calories). As for the
overall energy balance, 4 trials (19%) were designed to restrict
caloric intake (by 30–35% of total energy) in both the dietary
pulse and control arms (24, 28, 29, 31). We declared this as-
sessment to be a matched negative–energy-balance diet com-
parison, which invoked a weight-loss diet. The other 17 trials
were designed to provide matched neutral–energy-balance com-
parisons, which were intended to maintain weight.
According to the Heyland MQS, 8 of 19 publications (42%)
were rated high quality (MQS $8). The individual risk-of-bias
evaluation showed 7 reports had low risk of bias because the
majority of their categories were rated as low risk. The re-
maining 12 reports were rated as having unclear risk of bias.
High risk of bias was rated rarely across categories of reports
(see Supplemental Figures 1 and 2 for the risk of bias summary
figure and proportion graph, respectively).
Dietary pulses on body weight
The pooled effect of dietary pulses on body weight is shown in
Figure 2. Compared with control diets, dietary pulses reduced

 body weight under both neutral–energy-balance (weight-
maintaining) and negative–energy balance (weight-loss) diets
[20.29 kg (95% CI: 20.56, 20.03 kg; P = 0.03) and 21.74 kg
(95% CI: 23.19, 20.30 kg; P = 0.02), respectively]. The
overall pooled analysis showed that dietary pulse–containing
arms had reduced body weight by 20.34 kg (95% CI: 20.63,
20.04 kg; P = 0.03) compared with that of control arms with low
evidence of between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 9%, P-heterogeneity =
0.34).
The sensitivity analysis, in which each individual trial was
removed, and the pooled effect was recalculated with the
remaining 20 trials, did not largely affect the overall hetero-
geneity (I2 # 13%, P-heterogeneity $ 0.29). Six studies were
influential study outliers in that their removal altered the
magnitude of the pooled effect in the remaining studies by
.10% (25, 33, 36, 40–42). In addition, the removal of the
studies of Jenkins et al. (33) and Saraf-Bank et al. (40) ren-
dered the results no longer significant [20.19 kg (95% CI:
20.51, 0.12 kg; P = 0.23) and 20.30 kg (95% CI: 20.63, 0.03
kg; P = 0.08), respectively; forest plots not shown). The sen-
sitivity analysis with the use of different levels of correlation
coefficients (0.25 and 0.75) for the crossover studies did not
influence the weight-loss effect or heterogeneity in the overall
pooled results.
Although our main analysis showed no evidence of hetero-
geneity, the lower power of heterogeneity tests conveyed that
important subgroup effects may have been missed despite no
statistical evidence of heterogeneity. Therefore, we undertook
a priori subgroup analyses to explore the possibility that sources
of heterogeneity went undetected (Figure 3). Only the MQS
was a significant effect modifier of the weight-loss effect of
dietary pulses. High-quality trials showed a 0.60-kg weight
loss compared with lower-quality trials that showed a 0.05-kg
weight gain (P = 0.04) (for a forest plot of only high-quality
studies, see Supplemental Figure 3). We also observed
a small but insignificant association for greater weight loss in
the dietary pulse arm (0.58 kg) in studies with a parallel-study
design (P = 0.07).
Metaregression analyses did not reveal any significant linear
associations of between-study–level characteristics and the ef-
fect size in respect to the dose of dietary pulse intake, fiber
intake, change in fiber intake from baseline, saturated fat intake,
and change in saturated fat intake from baseline in the in-
tervention arm (P $ 0.09) (Supplemental Table 2).

 Dietary pulses and waist circumference and body fat
The pooled effect of 6 trials (n = 509 participants) that reported on
dietary pulse consumption on waist circumference is shown in
Figure 4. Diets that included dietary pulses did not significantly
reduce waist circumference (20.37 cm; 95% CI: 21.44, 0.71 cm;
P = 0.51), but a trend was seen in 6 trials (n = 340 participants) that
favored a reduction in body fat (20.34%; 95% CI: 20.71, 0.03 cm;
P = 0.07) (Figure 5). There was no evidence of significant hetero-
geneity for either endpoint (I2 = 43%, P-heterogeneity = 0.12 for
waist circumference; I2 = 0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.97 for body fat).
For waist circumference, the removal of the study by Jenkins et al.
(33) changed the effect direction (0.12 cm; 95% CI: 20.89, 1.13 cm;
P = 0.82), whereas the removal of the study by Veenstra et al. (42)
made the effect significant (21.01%; 95% CI: 21.74%, 20.28%;
P = 0.007). For body fat percentage, no studies were influential out-
liers. Metaregression analyses were not undertaken because of
the small number of studies included for these endpoints.
Publication bias
We showed no evidence of funnel-plot asymmetry or sta-
tistical support for small-study effects across all trials with the
use of either Egger’s or Begg’s tests (P . 0.05 for both)
(Supplemental Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
The current systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the
effects of dietary pulse consumption on weight loss in 21 ran-
domized controlled trials in 940 predominately overweight or
obese, middle-aged men and women. The pooled analysis showed
an overall small but significant weight reduction of 20.34 kg in
diets that contained dietary pulses (from 80 to 278 g/d; median
intake: 132 g/d or w1 serving/d) compared with diets without
a dietary pulse intervention over a median duration of 6 wk (P =
0.03). The stratification of our analysis into subgroups showed
significant weight loss in the dietary pulse arm for negative–
energy balance (weight-loss) conditions but also under neutral
energy balance (weight maintaining) conditions (P # 0.03). Our
findings also provided some evidence that dietary pulse–containing
diets may reduce body fat, which would support the WHO
recommendations to consume legumes to reduce overweight and
obesity (1).
We observed that high-quality trials of dietary pulse in-
terventions yielded larger weight-loss effects than lower quality

 trials did, which was consistent with a need for careful attention
to detail when designing and executing diet and weight-loss
studies.
We showed that dietary pulses produced weight loss under
conditions of neutral energy balance. The consumption of dietary
pulses resulted in significant weight loss at the end of the trials
although the interventions were designed to be weight-maintaining
diets. This result indicated that dietary pulses may be effective for
weight loss even when incorporated into a noncalorically re-
stricted diet, thereby providing a potentially effective alter-
native for calorie-restricted–based diets that may be difficult to
adhere to.
Our findings update the results of a much earlier meta-analysis.
Anderson and Major (12) conducted the only meta-analysis that
examined the effect of dietary pulses on weight in 8 trials in 2002.
They failed to support a significant role for dietary pulses in re-
ducing body weight and reported a 0.93% body weight reduction in
the dietary pulse intervention relative to that in the control arms
(approximated loss of 0.68 kg, P . 0.05) (12). However, the
authors of the meta-analysis did not provide a clear description of
their search and selection strategy, which makes it difficult to
assess the study-selection bias. Although the absolute weight loss
was greater than our reported value, the lack of significance may
have been a result of low statistical power because our study
added 16 new trials that have been published (24, 25, 28–34, 36–
42) since the article by Anderson and Major (12).
Although there is currently limited evidence on dietary pulse
consumption and body weight in observational studies, a cross-
sectional study by Papanikolaou and Fulgoni (45) with the use of
NHANES data reported that bean consumption was associated
with a lower body weight and waist size, and individuals who
consumed beans were 22% less likely to be obese (P = 0.03) than
were those who did not consume beans. Although observational
studies only support causation, Mollard et al. (46) published
a randomized controlled trial that showed that a weight-
maintaining diet that was high in dietary pulses reduced waist

the effect size differed between levels of the subgroup. P values were based on independent-samples t tests of group means. 1The residual I2 is an estimate of
the proportion of unexplained between-studies heterogeneity that remains after accounting for the variability in response because of the specific between-
studies factor. For example, a residual I2 of 0% for Sat fat intake suggested that, after accounting for differences in the change in Sat fat intake between studies,
there was no longer any evidence of unexplained heterogeneity. A residual I2 of 30% for baseline weight suggested that accounting for between-studies
differences in the baseline weight of the enrolled participants did not contribute to a reduction of unexplained heterogeneity. 2Represents the I2 from the

EFFECTS OF DIETARY PULSES ON WEIGHT

 circumference to the same extent as did a calorie-restricted diet
in 24 young-adult healthy men. This result also supports our
findings in that dietary pulse consumption contributed to weight
loss without explicit caloric restriction.
There are several mechanisms that could explain the weight
loss seen in negative–energy-balanced (weight-loss) and neutral–
energy-balanced (weight-maintaining) diets in our system-
atic review and meta-analysis. One mechanism may have
been the satiating properties of dietary pulses (11, 47, 48). A
recent systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated 9
trials in 129 participants revealed a 31% increase in subjective
satiety after a meal that contained dietary pulses compared
with after a control meal, which was determined to be clini-
cally meaningful (5). Dietary pulses may contribute to these
satiety effects because of several physiologic properties, such
as being high in fiber and protein and low in the GI. High-fiber
foods such as dietary pulses contribute to the feeling of fullness
because it increases the chewing time, thereby decreasing in-
take rates and stimulating early satiety signals (2). The soluble
fibers in dietary pulses may also delay gastric emptying and the
absorption of nutrients as they form viscous gels, thereby
slowing their passage through the digestive system (2). The
high-protein content of dietary pulses stimulates the secretion
of the gastric hormones cholecystokinin and glucagon-like
peptide-1, which causes the sensation of fullness (3). Last, low-
GI diets regulate blood glucose concentrations and insulin re-
lease, which may prevent overeating and promote weight
control (4, 6). These satiating effects may improve adherence
to an energy-reduced diet and help prevent overeating in ad
libitum settings.
The reduced bioavailability of calories from nutrients may be
another means by which dietary pulses contribute to weight loss.
Previous human trials have shown that high-fiber diets sub-
stantially reduce the absorption of fat and protein because they
may lower the physical contact of the nutrients with intestinal
villi (2), reduce the absorption in the gut due to the gel-forming
properties of soluble fiber, or increase the rate of passage
by insoluble fiber (49–51). Another important component that
contributes to a reduced nutrient bioavailability is the properties
of the cell walls of dietary pulses. White beans have been ob-
served to have intact cell walls that encapsulate starch granules
after digestion in the ileum that allows the internal content to
escape digestion, thereby reducing their energy content (52).
This protection provided by the cell walls in dietary pulses may
be an important component in the reduction of the bio-
availability of nutrients because the cell wall restricts the access
of digestive enzymes to the dietary pulses’ internal starches (53).
There were several limitations to our analyses. Our sensitivity
analyses indicated that the observed weight-loss effects were
largely driven by one trial (33). This finding merits caution when
interpreting our findings. Many of the trials were of short duration
in terms of seeing an effective weight loss (range: 4–10 wk),
which did not allow us to evaluate the long-term effects of di-
etary pulses on body weight or other endpoints. In addition, only
42% of the included reports were considered to be of high
quality (MQS $8); however, our subgroup analysis showed
a significant trend (P = 0.04) that favored greater weight loss in
higher-quality reports, thus arguing against the undue weighting
of less–methodologically rigorous trials. Last, the majority of
trials were rated to have unclear risks of bias.

 In conclusion, we showed modest weight loss with dietary pulse
consumption in both explicitly calorie-restricted settings and in
settings with intended weight maintenance. These findings are
generalizable to a middle-aged, overweight and obese population
and suggest that the incorporation of 1 serving of dietary pulses/d
may be a useful weight-loss strategy in a normal or calorically re-
duced diet. Although the clinical significance of a ,1-kg weight
loss is likely marginal, this finding is encouraging because it
suggests that dietary pulses do not lead to weight gain when in-
corporated into diets. The maintenance of reduced weight after
weight loss remains a clinical challenge (54). Dietary pulses are
satiating (5), affordable, and a sustainable source of protein and
fiber that can be incorporated into weight-maintenance diets.
Furthermore, there are additional health benefits of including di-
etary pulses in the diet that are related to cardiometabolic risk
reduction because they improve markers of glycemic control (18),
reduce LDL-cholesterol concentrations (19), and lower blood
pressure (21), even without weight loss. Few randomized con-
trolled trials have investigated the effects of dietary pulses on
other measures of adiposity, such as waist circumference and
body fat percentage. Future studies are warranted to clarify this
effect. Additional long-term trials are also suggested to monitor
the sustainability of the observed weight change.
