ABSTRACT
Background: The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)
recommend nutrient needs be met by increasing fruit, vegetable, and
whole-grain intake with the use of low-fat or fat-free dairy products
and by reducing sodium, solid fats, and added sugars. However, the
DGA, as a dietary pattern, have not been tested in an intervention
trial.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a
DGA-based diet compared with a representative typical American
diet (TAD) on glucose homeostasis and fasting lipids in individuals
at risk of cardiometabolic disease.
Design: A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-wk intervention
was conducted in overweight and obese women selected according
to indexes of insulin resistance or dyslipidemia. Women were
randomly assigned to the DGA or TAD group (n = 28 DGA
and 24 TAD). The TAD diet was based on average adult intake
from the NHANES 2009–2010. The DGA and TAD diets had
respective Healthy Eating Index scores of 98 and 62. All foods
and beverages were provided during the intervention. Oral-glucose
tolerance and fasting lipids were evaluated at 0, 2, and 8 wk of the
intervention. Insulin resistance and sensitivity were estimated with
the use of surrogates (e.g., homeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance).
Results: By design, volunteers maintained their weight during the
intervention. Fasting insulin, glucose, triglycerides, oral-glucose
tolerance, and indexes of insulin resistance were not affected by
either of the diets. Systolic blood pressure decreased in the DGA
group (∼−9 mm Hg; P < 0.05). Total and HDL cholesterol
also decreased in both groups (P < 0.05). Exploratory analysis
comparing volunteers entering the study with insulin resistance and
dyslipidemia with those with only dyslipidemia did not show an
effect of pre-existing conditions on glucose tolerance or fasting lipid
outcomes.
Conclusions: The consumption of a DGA dietary pattern for 8 wk
without weight loss reduced systolic blood pressure. There were
no differences between the DGA and TAD diets in fasting insulin,
glucose, indexes of insulin resistance, or fasting lipids. This trial was
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02298725.

INTRODUCTION
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) rec-
ommended a dietary pattern that meets nutrient needs while
increasing intakes of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains with
the use of lower-fat milk and dairy products and by reducing
sodium, solid fats, and added sugars (1). The current 2015
DGA recommendations reaffirmed the general characteristics
of the dietary pattern, adding only that seafood, legumes, and
nuts are desirable protein sources (2). Dietary patterns, more
than individual foods or nutrients, are associated with health
benefits, due to the synergistic or additive influence of individual
constituents (3). With the use of a data-driven approach, on
the basis of epidemiologic studies, several dietary patterns have
been described and associated with modifying the risk of chronic
cardiovascular and metabolic disease (4). When normal-weight
Chinese adults consuming a traditional dietary pattern were
compared with those consuming a Western dietary pattern,
the latter had a higher incidence of insulin resistance (5).
Systematic reviews conducted during the past decade reported an
inverse association between healthful dietary patterns and type
2 diabetes risk, but this relation disappeared when controlled
for confounding variables (6), including BMI (7). Limitations of
epidemiologic research, observational or prospective, should be
considered in interpreting the relation between dietary patterns
and health outcomes (8).
Few randomized controlled trials have evaluated food-based
patterns. To our knowledge, no studies have tested food-
based patterns without weight loss on outcomes related to the
risk of type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance. The Prevención
con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial, although not a
strictly controlled feeding intervention, showed reduced fasting
glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR with 2 Mediterranean dietary
patterns compared with a low-fat diet; body-weight changes were
minimal (9). Apart from PREDIMED, there is little compelling

evidence that a dietary pattern intervention can attenuate the
insulin-resistant state in the absence of weight loss (10). The
Diabetes Prevention Program, one of the most effective, yet
intensive lifestyle interventions tested in an at-risk population,
improved insulin resistance in participants with type 2 diabetes,
and concurrently reduced body weight (11). There are other
controlled trials that manipulated the macronutrient composition
of the diet and showed reductions in plasma glucose, glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c), HOMA-IR, and insulin secretion capacity
in the absence of weight change (12–15), but these were not food
pattern–based interventions.
With these studies in mind, there is clearly a knowledge gap
in the scientific literature with respect to weight-independent
cardiometabolic effects of high-quality, food-based diets, in
particular the DGA. We hypothesized that the consumption of a
diet patterned after the DGA compared with a typical American
diet (TAD) would improve insulin sensitivity and blood lipids in
a cohort of overweight and obese women at risk of metabolic
disease. Our study was designed to keep each participant’
s body
weight stable to eliminate a possible confounding effect of
weight change. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a controlled
intervention trial, providing 2 different dietary patterns, one based
on the recommendations of the 2010 DGA and the other based
on the average reported intake for women aged 20–65 y in
the NHANES 2009–2010 to define TAD. To our knowledge,
this is the first study that has provided all foods to meet DGA
recommendations to test the effects of this dietary pattern on
metabolic health.

≤140/90 mm Hg. Several indexes of glucose intolerance and
insulin resistance were considered as inclusion criteria on the
basis of American Diabetes Association guidelines. Participants
qualified if they had ≥1 of the following: fasting glucose
≥100 and <126 mg/dL; oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) 2-h
glucose >140 and <199 mg/dL; Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity
Check Index (QUICKI) score <0.315, homeostasis model assess-
ment (HOMA) >3.67, or log HOMA >0.085; or HbA1c ≥5.7
and <6.5. The rationale for these cutoffs is detailed in Campbell
et al. (17). As an alternative to qualifying on the basis of indexes
of glucose intolerance alone, volunteers could also qualify on
the basis of ATP III guidelines (Adult Treatment Panel) criteria
(18): fasting triglyceride concentrations >150 mg/dL or HDL
cholesterol <50 mg/dL. Participants were excluded on the basis
of the following criteria: resting blood pressure >140/90 mm
Hg, hemoglobin <11.5 g/dL, total cholesterol >300 mg/dL, LDL
cholesterol >189 mg/dL, triglycerides >400 mg/dL, or clinically
abnormal thyroid or liver function. Other exclusion criteria
included the presence of any metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal
disorders, cancer or other serious chronic disease; pregnancy or
lactation; current use of tobacco; prescribed or over-the-counter
weight-loss medications in the 6 mo before enrollment into the
study; moderate or strenuous physical activity >30 min/d on ≥5
d/wk; weight change of >5% of body weight within 6 mo of entry
into the study; “graveyard”work shifts or forced to stay awake all
night; dietary restrictions that would interfere with consuming the
intervention foods; or use of medications for elevated lipids or
glucose.
Study approvals
The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier:
NCT02298725) and was approved by the University of Cali-
fornia, Davis (UC Davis), Institutional Review Board. Several
primary and secondary outcome measures were evaluated as
part of this trial. In the present report, we focus on primary
metabolic health outcomes, and our other outcomes are listed in
the clinicaltrials.gov study page. Future articles will report on
other outcomes that were evaluated, as data become available.
Participants provided written informed consent to be screened
and, if qualified, provided consent for participating in the
intervention study. No adverse events or unintended harms were
reported by study participants in this intervention trial.
Study design and timeline
The study was conducted as a double-blinded, randomized,
controlled-feeding clinical trial. The trial consisted of an orien-
tation to study procedures, followed by a 1-wk baseline period
during which participants continued to consume their usual
diets, and all preintervention data were collected. The baseline
period was followed by the 8-wk intervention (Supplemental
Table 1). During the orientation, participants were introduced
to study procedures and study requirements were reviewed. The
baseline, preintervention period included activity monitoring,
assessment of usual diet, energy requirement estimation, comple-
tion of an OGTT, and body-composition measurement. Once the
intervention period started, the OGTT test protocol was repeated
after 2 wk and again after 8 wk. Assignment to the dietary
intervention was random.

Participant recruitment and screening for eligibility
Participants were recruited between January 2015 and Febru-
ary 2017 via posted flyers, Western Human Nutrition Research
Center website posting, Craigslist advertising, newspaper and
radio advertising, and referrals from UC Davis and the greater
Sacramento area. A sample of women (n = 52), aged 20–
65 y, were enrolled in the intervention trial after successfully
completing the screening process. The first step of the screening
process consisted of a telephone interview that assessed interest
in the study, medical history, and reported height, weight, and age
of the caller. For those women who met the general screening
criteria for BMI, age, and reported absence of chronic disease,
an in-person appointment was scheduled. At this appointment,
height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the use of
a wall-mounted stadiometer (model S100; Ayrton Corporation)
and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with the
use of a calibrated electronic scale (Tanita BWB-627A Class
III electronic scale; Toledo Scale). Volunteers then sat for a
3-min resting period before systolic and diastolic blood pressure
measurements, pulse, and temperature were taken with the use
of a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (GE DINAMAP vitals
monitor; GE Healthcare). Waist and hip circumferences were
measured in triplicate by using anthropometric tape. The waist
measurement was taken at the minimum circumference between
the iliac crest and the rib cage, whereas the hip measurement
was taken at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks. An
overnight-fasted blood sample was taken for a clinical chemistry
panel, lipid panel, complete blood count, and glucose and insulin
determinations. Finally, volunteers were given a 75-g oral-
glucose-tolerance beverage (Limeondex, lemon-lime flavored;
Fisherbrand), and a 2-h postbeverage blood sample was taken
for glucose and insulin analysis. The screening clinical chemistry
assays were performed by the UC Davis Medical Center clinical
pathology laboratory.
The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)
diagram (Figure 1) shows the total number of people who
responded to the advertisement, who were assessed for their
eligibility via telephone screen, did not qualify after the telephone
screen, moved forward with the in-person clinical screening
appointment, did not qualify after the clinical screening, signed
the intervention study consent form and were oriented to the
study, withdrew from the study, and completed the study.
Disqualifications after the in-person screen included loss of
participant interest, not meeting laboratory inclusion criteria,
BMI based on measured height and weight of <25 or >39.9,
resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg,
dietary restrictions, scheduling conflicts, transportation issues, or
not showing up to the visit. After signing the consent form, a total
of 8 participants withdrew for various reasons, which included
unwillingness to comply with the diet, scheduling conflicts,
or personal reasons related to family or medical concerns.
Recruitment was closed upon enrollment of required volunteers
based on our sample size calculation provided in the “Data
analysis” section.

 NUTRIENT-DENSE DIETARY PATTERN AND INSULIN RESISTANCE
269
Randomization and blinding
Volunteers were stratified by menopausal status (pre- or post-)
and glucose intolerance (normal compared with insulin resistant),
and then randomly assigned within each stratum to the DGA or
TAD diet (1:1 allocation ratio to each group) in blocks of 2 by
using Microsoft Office Excel. The study statistician generated the
randomization lists with the use of colors to indicate treatment
(without knowledge of which would be which), and the principal
dietitian assigned the colors to specific diets and implemented
the randomization scheme. The randomization schedules were
only communicated between the statistician and the dietitian;
the dietitian’
s assistant, in addition to the former 2 individuals,
was aware of and had access to the sequence. Nobody involved
with data analysis had access to the assignment of the subjects.
When the study coordinators sent out an e-mail announcing
enrollment of a new subject, the dietitian added the subject
to the next available slot per the stratification scheme. If the
participant dropped out after commencing the diet, the space
was not reused, and was marked with an “X” to signify that
the participant dropped out. If the participant was enrolled but
never started the diet, then the space was reused. If a participant
enrolled and was randomly assigned but delayed commencement
of the diet, then the space that was assigned was reserved for
that subject until the date at which the participant commenced
the diet. Once randomly assigned, the metabolic kitchen was
given the participant ID, their kilocalorie prescription, and the
color codes that identified the treatment. All of the recipes,
foods, and documentation were coded only with these color codes
according to which treatment the foods belonged. The use of
“DGA” or “TAD” was never indicated on paperwork or through
verbal exchange in the metabolic kitchen. Similarly, participants
only saw diets referred to as the color diets. In addition, study
coordinators and all staff interacting with the subjects knew only
of treatments by colors, and not the true randomized diet group.
Diet interventions and blinding during implementation
Two diets were designed, both with the goals of providing
sufficient energy to maintain body weight and containing
macronutrients falling within the acceptable range, as recom-
mended by the Institute of Medicine (19). The primary objective
of the menu design was to only include foods and beverages
commonly available to consumers in grocery stores. The TAD
was based on dietary intake reported by participants in the
USDA’
s “What We Eat in America” survey, the dietary arm
of NHANES, and the DGA diet was based on the food-group
recommendations set forth by the 2010 DGAs (20). The food
groups for the diets are listed in Table 1, which shows the primary
differences between diets. The DGA diet contained more fruit and
vegetables, whole grains, and dairy, whereas the TAD had more
refined grains, solid fats, and added sugars. Each day’
s menu
included 3 meals and snacks to meet the calculated caloric needs
to maintain weight. Eight-day cyclic menus were designed for
the 2 interventions. Sample menus and ingredients for the DGA
and TAD are found in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3. Additional
specific details of the menu and preparation are the subject
of a follow-up article. All of the study foods were prepared
by the Metabolic Kitchen and Human Feeding Laboratory at
the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (Western Human

Nutrition Research Center). Volunteers received study foods
2 times/wk.
Between the screening appointment and study week 0,
three 24-h dietary recalls (unannounced) were completed on
2 weekdays and 1 weekend day with the use of the Automated
Self-Administered 24-h dietary recall system (21) to obtain
information about the usual dietary habits of each participant.
Data from this were used to calculate Healthy Eating Index (HEI)
scores, as well as prestudy nutrient intake summaries, which are
presented in Supplemental Table 4. HEI scores were calculated
according to guidelines set by the USDA (22) with the use of
linear regression to estimate scores within the cutoffs that have
been provided.
The target food patterns for both the TAD and DGA diets
were adapted from data in Table 5-1 of the 2010 DGA policy
document (1). The nutrient- and food group–controlled study
menus were developed by a registered dietitian using the Nu-
trition Data System for Research 2014 (Nutrition Coordinating
Center, University of Minnesota) and ProNutra3.5 (Viocare, Inc.)
software programs.
The 8-d rotating-cycle menu was scaled to match each partic-
ipant’
s estimated energy requirement (EER), as described below.
The various food-group amounts were scaled proportionately
from the 2200-kcal level in order to maintain equal distribution of
foods in relation to body mass and EER. Each menu was scaled
proportionately to create 3 core energy levels: 1700, 2200, and
2700 kcal. Unit foods were designed to further adjust kilocalories
to match energy levels between the core menus; these foods were
carefully calculated to match both the nutrient and food group
pattern of the core kilocalorie levels in order to keep the overall
dietary pattern proportionate.

KRISHNAN ET AL.
The study diets used foods commonly available in the
American retail market, as well as foods in a variety of forms:
fresh, canned, frozen, juiced, cured, dried, and manufactured.
Specific foods were selected because they were detailed in What
We Eat in America’
s food categories (2001–2010) and the Food
and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, they contained a
specific nutritional profile that aided in the fine-tuning of the diet
calculations, they assisted in improving palatability, or because
they could remain acceptable to participants after portioning.
To design a double-blinded diet, menus were constructed
primarily from a common core of selected foods so that the
same general types of foods were used on both diets. During
enrollment, the participants were never told about the DGA or
TAD dietary patterns, only that we were evaluating 2 nutritionally
adequate, weight-maintaining dietary patterns. Furthermore, the
participants never interacted with each other while eating meals
at the center so as to be able to compare diets. The same
foods appeared in both of the diets (see Supplemental Table
2), but often the menu days did not overlap between volunteers
at different stages (weeks) of the study. The energy density
of the DGA diet (for all foods and caloric beverages, or just
food or just caloric beverages) was lower (0.67, 0.75, or 0.43
kcal/g, respectively) than that of the TAD diet (0.86, 0.94, or
0.54 kcal/g, respectively) (see Supplemental Table 4). The major
differences between the 2 diets were achieved by increasing
or decreasing food groups and nutrients as detailed in the Key
Recommendations of the 2010 DGA (1). Another difference
between the TAD and DGA diets was the use of some healthier
lines of manufactured foods containing fewer solid fats and
added sugars, less sodium, more potassium, and more fruit and
vegetables. Foods that are generally perceived as unhealthful
(e.g., hot dogs) were puréed and stealthily incorporated into
mixed dishes (e.g., chili). Furthermore, the assembly of food
components was ordered in a way to disguise any perceived visual
signs of healthfulness or unhealthfulness. Coffee, tea, and bottled
water (still and sparkling) were provided by the metabolic kitchen
to reduce variability in commonly consumed “free” beverages.
Study foods were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g and produced
in a multistep assembly system with embedded checks-and-
balances to verify correct product and weight of each ingredient.
When foods specific to one diet were received, they were coded
upon delivery to reduce the risk of being used for the incorrect
intervention diet. An inspection checkpoint was implemented at
the final stage of assembly, where preprinted labels for all food
items of each participant’
s meal were affixed to the meal after
being verified. Furthermore, once meals were packed “to go,”
they were inspected by a study coordinator immediately before
handing over to the participant.
Participants were provided a daily meal checklist (Supple-
mental Figure 1) that included each menu item with space for
documenting the amount consumed; the time each item was
consumed; a checkbox to confirm having only eaten study foods;
a checkbox to confirm not taking any medications, supplements,
or other remedies; space for documenting any adverse events
related to eating the meals; and space for documenting any
nonstudy foods, drinks, medications, supplements, or other
remedies. They were also instructed to return all unwashed
packaging; visual inspection was documented by the metabolic
kitchen. In addition to the checklists and returned packaging,
participants were educated on food safety as well as provided tips
on managing challenging social situations while participating in
a feeding study. Repeated reinforcement of the value of honesty
over perfection was provided. Study coordinators reviewed the
returned checklists with the participants to verify completeness.
Estimating energy requirement to maintain body weight
The EER was based on preintervention measurements of
resting energy expenditure (REE), physical activity energy
expenditure (PAEE), and an adjustment for the thermic effect
of food. Participant REE was measured by using an automated
metabolic cart (TrueOne 2400; Parvo Medics) in the fasted
state after quietly resting in a semireclined position for 20 min.
Respiratory gas exchange was then measured for 20 min, with
the goal of obtaining ≥10 min of “steady state” data (minute-by-
minute CV <5% for volume of oxygen consumed and volume
of carbondioxide produced). The Weir equation without urinary
nitrogen correction was used to estimate REE (23). Average
PAEE was measured over 7 consecutive days (kilocalories per
day) with the use of an accelerometer (Actical; Respironics)
beginning on the orientation day. Total energy expenditure was
calculated by the addition of REE and PAEE and adjusting for
the thermic effect of food, so that it represented 10% of REE.
The Actical estimates different intensity physical activities on
the basis of the metabolic equivalents (METs) using activity
counts per unit time (using 60 epochs/count). Three to 6 METs
are considered moderate-intensity physical activity, <1 counts
as sedentary, 1–2.9 counts as light activity, 3–5.9 as moderate
intensity, and vigorous as any activity ≥6 METs. The volunteers’
age, height, weight, and sex were taken into account while setting
up the Actical, which then estimates energy expenditure on the
basis of these factors as well as the measured activity counts and
their corresponding METs. Energy intake was prescribed for each
participant on the basis of her specific estimate of total energy
expenditure. Body-weight measurements during the study were
used to ensure that the caloric prescription was appropriate to
maintain weight. If the body-weight trajectory had a significant
slope, increasing or decreasing at a rate yielding a change of >3%
extrapolated over the first 2 study weeks, the caloric content of
the diet was adjusted to offset the change in weight and then kept
constant for the remainder of the study.
Activity monitoring
In addition to measuring PAEE preintervention, activity was
monitored during study weeks 4 and 7. The accelerometer
was positioned atop the iliac crest of the left hip and secured
with an elastic belt. During the monitoring weeks, participants
wore the device for 7 consecutive days, removing it only for
showering, bathing, or other activities in which the device might
be submerged. Participants kept a daily log of waking and
sleeping times, intervals when the device was removed, and
intervals of activity patterns they considered out of the ordinary.
Body-composition measurement
Once during baseline (week 0) and once during week 8, a
whole-body scan was performed with the use of dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Discovery QDR Series 84994;
Hologic, Inc.). This scan provided values for total lean mass,

total fat mass, estimates of gynoid and android fat distribution,
and percentage body fat, bone density, bone mineral mass. All
premenopausal women were given a commercial urine human
chorionic gonadotropin immunoassay to confirm nonpregnant
status before scanning.
OGTT
At weeks 0, 2, and 8, a standard OGTT was administered
to volunteers after a 12-h overnight fast. A registered nurse
placed an indwelling catheter into the volunteer’
s antecubital
vein and took a fasting blood sample. After this, the volunteer
was given a 75-g glucose bolus to be consumed within
5 min. Four subsequent blood samples were taken at 30, 60,
90, and 120 min after drinking the glucose bolus. Antecubital
vein blood was collected in Vacutainers (Becton Dickinson
VACUTAINER Systems, Rutherford, New Jersey), with no
additives for insulin determination or potassium oxalate/sodium
fluoride for glucose determination. Once blood was obtained, the
serum Vacutainers were kept at room temperature for 30 min,
whereas the plasma Vacutainers were immediately chilled on ice.
All of the Vacutainers were centrifuged in a refrigerated Centra
CL3R (International Equipment Co.) for 10 min at 100 × g at
10°C, and serum and plasma aliquots were stored at –80°C for
analysis. Plasma glucose was determined by using an enzyme-
linked colorimetic assay on a Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
(Cobas Integra 400+; Roche Diagnostics Corporation). Serum
insulin concentrations were determined by using a competitive
binding assay on an immunoanalyzer (Cobas E 411; Roche
Diagnostics). Fasting values for glucose and insulin were used
to calculate HOMA-IR (24), QUICKI (25) and McAuley (26)
indexes. The Matsuda index was calculated by using fasting and
OGTT values for glucose and insulin (27).
Blood pressure and lipids
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured at weeks
0, 2, and 8, as outlined previously. Similarly, fasting plasma
samples were used to measure lipid panels (total, LDL, and HDL
cholesterol) as well as triglycerides at the UC Davis Medical
Center clinical pathology laboratory, as mentioned previously.
Statistical analysis
Power calculation
The sample size for this study was based on a power
calculation conducted with the use of a cohort of sedentary, obese,
insulin-resistant women (n = 21), with repeated (twice) baseline
fasting insulin concentrations, followed by 1 wk of a weight-
maintenance DGA 2005–based diet intervention (17). Fasting
insulin concentrations were measured again after the run-in diet
phase. In order to account for the “regression to the mean effect”
affecting the variation in these measures, a residual-corrected (the
residual after the 2 baseline variances were accounted for) change
in SD for insulin was calculated to be 7.11 mIU/mL. On the basis
of this value, we calculated that 17 subjects/group would enable
us to detect a difference of 5.32 mIU/mL between group means
with 80% probability, assuming a 5% level of significance and a
2-tailed test. This translated to an effect size of 0.75. Adding in
a 25% attrition rate to this number increased the sample size to
22/group, which was our final sample size.
Data analysis
Data from volunteers who started the full 8-wk intervention
and testing were included (DGA = 28, TAD = 24; total: 52),
in a primary intent-to-treat analysis. A secondary per-protocol
analysis with only data from volunteers who completed the full
8-wk intervention was also performed (n = 22 each DGA and
TAD; total: 44), followed by subgroup analyses. All of the
analyses were performed in R single packages nlme and lsmeans
(R statistical software) (28) and JMP Pro 13.1 (SAS Institute).
The normality of data was checked by using the Shapiro-Wilk
test, and nonnormal data were transformed to log or cube root
for use in further analysis (transformed data were confirmed to
be normal before using in parametric tests). Grubbs test was used
to detect univariate outliers; transformed data used in parametric
tests did not have any statistical outliers; van der Wearden’
s
nonparametric tests were used to identify differences at baseline
between volunteers randomly assigned to the DGA and TAD
diet groups, as well as to compare adherence to diet between
the groups. A linear mixed-effects model with subject as the
random effect and group (DGA compared with TAD), week (0,
2, or 8), and blood collection minutes (0, 30, 50, 90, and 120) as
fixed effects, and repeated measures with interactions (group ×
week × minutes) were tested for the outcome glucose and insulin
after the OGTT. Some serum samples were hemolyzed (∼3%
of combined data for all weeks for both groups and at all time
points), which is known to affect insulin analysis. In a sensitivity
analyses, the hemolyzed sample insulin values were removed and
imputed within each subject by using the multivariate imputation
R package Amelia II (29). An ANOVA was conducted comparing
the following 2 models: 1) a linear mixed model using insulin
values from hemolyzed and 2) a similar model using imputed
data. This was performed to evaluate differences between their fit
and found not to be different (P = 0.45). Furthermore, an analysis
comparing insulin outcomes (OGTT, fasting and postprandial)
after removing the hemolyzed samples was also performed and
showed no differences from the reported outcome in this study.
The incremental AUCs (iAUCs) for glucose and insulin were
calculated by using the trapezoidal rule, while correcting for the
fasting value (30). Linear mixed-effects modeling was also used
to compare fasting values for glucose, insulin, HbA1c, HOMA,
QUICKI, the Matsuda index, the Disposition index, the McAuley
index, triglycerides, and LDL, HDL, total cholesterol at weeks
0, 2, and 8, with their week 0 value as a covariate to adjust for
baseline differences between the groups. This was followed by
pairwise least-square means tests with Tukey’
s method, where
appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered significant for all tests.
Subgroup analyses
Exploratory analyses were performed using linear mixed-
effects modeling to determine if certain participant phenotypes
affected study outcomes related to glucose tolerance: fasting
and postprandial glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, HbA1c,
Matsuda index, or iAUC glucose and insulin. The phenotype
subgroup comparisons were as follows: 1) premenopausal
compared with postmenopausal participants, 2) participants

comparison of participants assigned to the DGA intervention who
had improvement in their usual diet quality with participants

calculated as intervention − usual diet, and used to categorize
volunteers into groups on the basis of whether their score
increased (by ≥5 units), decreased (by ≥5 units), or had no

RESULTS
Primary intent-to-treat approach
Study participants were between 21 and 64 y of age, with BMIs
ranging from 25.2 to 39.8. Physical and clinical characteristics
measured at screening were not different between the groups
(Table 2). Across the intervention, fasting glucose, insulin,
lipids, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and indexes related
to glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance/sensitivity are
presented in Table 3.
Systolic blood pressure showed a significant group (P = 0.044)
and week (P = 0.017) effect, and a trend for interaction
(P = 0.090). Tukey’
s adjusted multiple-comparison tests showed
a significant reduction at week 8 compared with week 0 in the
DGA (P = 0.006) but not in the TAD group (P = 0.919). Total
fasting cholesterol had a significant group × week interaction
(P = 0.050); however, multiple-comparison tests identified only
a trend for lowered values at week 8 in the DGA compared
with week 0 (P = 0.090), but not in the TAD group. HDL
cholesterol had a week and a group main effect (P = 0.001), with
no interaction effect. Weeks 0, 2, and 8 were different in both
TAD and DGA groups based on multiple-comparison tests (week
0 compared with week 2: P = 0.004; week 0 compared with week
8: P < 0.001; week 2 compared with week 8: P = 0.053).
Results from the OGTTs at weeks 0, 2, and 8 for DGA and
TAD groups are presented in Figure 2. No significant differences
between the diet groups were identified when analyzed as
repeated measures (glucose: diet effect P value = 0.405, insulin:
diet effect P value = 0.534) and as a summary measure using the
iAUC (iAUC glucose diet effect P value = 0.505; iAUC insulin
diet effect P value = 0.864). There was no effect of week and no
interaction of diet × week on iAUC insulin or glucose.
Anthropometric and physical activity data are presented in
Supplemental Table 5. Body weight and body fat percentage
were maintained during the study in both groups. No participants
experienced >5% weight loss, and n = 14 (DGA = 7, TAD = 7)
experienced weight loss of ∼3%. Lean mass also showed a signif-
icant main effect of week (P = 0.043), with Tukey’
s pairwise test
confirming the difference between weeks 0 and 8 (P = 0.051).
There was a main effect of week (P = 0.015) and group
(P = 0.031) on android fat mass, with no significant interaction
effects (P = 0.206). Pairwise Tukey’
s adjusted P values indicated
significantly different android fat mass at week 8 compared with
week 1 (P = 0.009), but no group differences. No significant
differences by group or week were identified in BMI, percentage
body fat, hip circumference, or gynoid fat mass. Moderate-
intensity physical activity minutes were not different [DGA:

Per-protocol approach
With the use of the per-protocol approach (n = 22 each, TAD
and DGA), our study volunteers’ anthropometric and clinical
characteristics were not different at baseline, with the exception
of systolic blood pressure, which was higher in the DGA group
than in the TAD group (P = 0.051) (Supplemental Table 6).
The study volunteers (96% of the cohort) were considered at
risk on the basis of a combination of fasting glucose, insulin,
and triglycerides (Supplemental Figure 2). The reported usual
food intake in these volunteers yielded HEI scores between 65
and 69 (Supplemental Table 7), which are very similar to the
intervention TAD diet (score: 62), but considerably lower than
the intervention DGA diet (score: 98) (Supplemental Table 4).
Fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, and indexes related to glucose control and insulin
resistance/sensitivity are presented in Supplemental Table 8.
In total cholesterol, significant week (P = 0.020) and group
(P = 0.020) effects were identified with no interaction effects,
and pairwise tests indicated a significant difference between
weeks 2 and 8 (P = 0.020) and a group difference as well
(P = 0.050). HDL cholesterol showed significant main week
(P < 0.001) and group (P < 0.001) effects, with Tukey’
s
adjusted pairwise comparisons indicating a week 0 compared
with week 8 difference (P < 0.001), but no group effect. In
a pairwise test, there was a trend for a difference in LDL
cholesterol between DGA and TAD groups (P = 0.090), but
this was not significant. In systolic blood pressure, there was a
significant week effect (P = 0.002) and a significant group ×
week interaction (P = 0.04). Multiple-comparison tests (adjusted
by Tukey’
s) showed significantly lower systolic blood pressure
at weeks 2 and 8 compared with week 0 in the DGA group
(P = 0.050 and P = 0.001, respectively) but no change in the TAD
group. Furthermore, although 16 women in the DGA group had
reduced systolic blood pressure by ≥ 2 mm Hg, only 9 women in
the TAD group had a reduction of ≥2 mm Hg. No significant
main (week or group) or interaction effects were identified in
fasting and 2-h glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, or the
McAuley, Disposition, or Matsuda indexes. The OGTT time-
course data showed no significant effects for glucose or insulin
(data not shown; similar to intent-to-treat data).
Dietary adherence in completers (n = 22 each, DGA and TAD)
was measured by using diet logs that were scored in combination
with weight maintenance and surveillance of returned packaging.
Taking both groups together, the study volunteers logged an
average of 34 ± 33 deviances from eating 100% of prescribed
foods, and 5 ± 8 deviances in eating nonstudy foods; this
represents adhering an average of ∼88% and ∼95%, respectively.
Both the DGA and TAD diets had equivalent overall adherence
scores, with 30 ± 35 (10.4% ± 0.1% deviation) instances of
reported deviance from full dietary compliance in the DGA group
and 39 ± 31 (13.9% ± 0.1%) instances of reported deviance in
the TAD group. Similarly, there were 3.5 ± 4.3 (1.2% ± 0.1%)
reported instances of eating nonstudy foods in the DGA group
and 5.7 ± 10.6 (2.0% ± 0.1%) instances in the TAD group. No
significant differences were identified between the groups in any
of the nonadherence categories.

test, P = 0.13). No interactions between diet group, week, and
menopausal status were found for fasting glucose, insulin, and
OGTT variables (Supplemental Table 9).
Of the 44 women who completed this study, 18 were
dyslipidemic (n = 9 each in the TAD and DGA groups); the
remaining 26 presented evidence of dyslipidemia and glucose
intolerance/insulin resistance (GIT) (n = 13 each in the TAD and
DGA groups). The distribution of dyslipidemia compared with
dyslipidemia+GIT was not different between DGA and TAD
(chi-square test, P = 1.00). No differences were identified in
fasting or postprandial glucose and insulin, or any of the insulin
resistance measures by group, week, or dyslipidemia compared
with dyslipidemia+GIT interaction (Supplemental Table 10).
All 22 women in the DGA group improved their diet quality
on the basis of a change in HEI score, whereas 2 of the 22 women
in the TAD group increased their diet quality on the basis of
HEI score (Supplemental Table 11). The total HEI score, on
average, relative to the intervention diet increased by 32.7 points
in the DGA group and decreased by 6.5 points in the TAD group.
No interactions between HEI category and week and group were
identified.
Participants who had >3% weight loss did not have sig-
nificantly different diet group responses in fasting or 2-h
OGTT insulin (diet group effects: P = 0.560 and P = 0.760,
respectively) or fasting or 2-h glucose (diet group effects:
P = 0.850 and P = 0.830, respectively), week, or diet × week
interaction compared with the group that experienced <3% body-
weight change.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first controlled-feeding trial
to test the effect of a food-based dietary pattern following
recommendations of the DGA. We measured cardiometabolic
disease risk factors in an at-risk female cohort, while maintaining
body weight, with the use of foods that are accessible and
acceptable to the consumer. The higher quality of the DGA diet
relative to the TAD was confirmed by HEI scores of 98 and
62, respectively. We found that, in the absence of weight loss,
consuming a diet based on recommendations of the DGA did
not change glucose homeostasis or fasting lipids in our cohort.
The 2015 DGA Advisory Committee report concluded that there
was moderate evidence for reduction in type 2 diabetes risk
associated with nutrient-dense diets (2); however, the results from
our short-term intervention trial did not align with this evidence.
By design, the intervention did not lead to significant weight loss,
and because changes in body weight and body fat can play a role
in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (31), this may also explain
why improvements in blood sugar control were not observed
despite the improvement in diet quality.
Evidence based on whole diets
Epidemiologic evidence suggests that dietary patterns are
associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (i.e., a
plant-based dietary pattern reduces risk, whereas an animal-based
dietary pattern increases risk) (32). A recent meta-analysis of
epidemiologic evidence supports the notion that dietary patterns
that score high in diet quality using Mediterranean, Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and the Alternate
HEI techniques have strong potential for preventing type 2
diabetes (33). A recent population-based prospective cohort study
identified that following the 2015 Dutch Dietary Guidelines was
associated with reduced mortality due to some (stroke, colorectal
cancer) but not all (coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
breast cancer) chronic diseases (34). Interventions aimed at
reducing type 2 diabetes risk (31, 35) or managing glycemia
in patients with type 2 diabetes (36) have typically involved
increasing physical activity, reducing body weight, or both. To
our knowledge, no data exist to determine if the consumption
of a DGA-based diet while maintaining excess body weight can
reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The Diabetes Prevention Program
was an effective intervention found to be superior to metformin
in reducing type 2 diabetes risk (37). This intensive intervention
included both diet and exercise guidelines and achieved and
maintained a 7% weight loss as part of the program. Similarly,
the DGA recommend that adults should engage in moderately
intense physical activity for ≥150 min/wk to achieve health
benefits (2), higher than the average activity of the women in
our trial. The results herein suggest that a DGA dietary pattern
alone is not sufficient to elicit significant improvements, at least
over a short period of time, in clinical cardiometabolic risk
factors in women. Furthermore, a recent report that compiled
data from 3 large studies [diet, obesity and genes dietary study
(DiOGenes), dietary intervention with shop model (SHOPUS),
and nutrient-gene interactions in human obesity (NUGENOB)]
identified that high fasting glucose was associated with weight
gain, or lack of weight maintenance, while following a diet
that was low in whole grains and dietary fiber and had a high
glycemic load (38). This indicates an association between fasting
glucose and body weight, as well as the role of dietary pattern
in regulating their association. Hence, intervention trials aimed
at improving cardiometabolic health may require both increased
physical activity, weight loss, or both in tandem with high-quality
dietary patterns to be clinically meaningful.
Furthermore, by design, the study aimed to maintain body
weight, which may be a primary reason we did not observe
the positive impact that the DGA pattern may impart. However,
the use of change in body weight, android fat mass, or waist
circumference in the current study did not have a significant
effect on primary outcome variables—glucose, insulin, and lipids
(data not shown). Hence, the 3% weight loss seen in 50% of
our volunteers, and the significant android fat mass and waist
circumference change in both groups, did not affect our outcomes
or groups differently.
Dietary fiber (whole grains, fruit, and vegetables)
One of the major differences between the 2 intervention diets
was the greater amount of fiber provided in the DGA diet.
Whole-grain intake and type 2 diabetes risk factors have been
inversely associated in epidemiologic studies (39). Whole-grain
foods can reduce insulin resistance and postprandial insulin and
glucose response in hyperinsulinemic adults (40), but this effect
is not apparent in healthy normal-weight (41) or overweight (42)
individuals. Juntunen et al. (43) theorized that the effect of whole
grain on blood sugar and insulin is not due to the fiber content but
to the form and structure of the fiber, with rye showing stronger

diabetes risk (39), with high intakes not having a strong risk-
lowering association. These studies suggest that specific whole-
grain types in a high-quality diet may be important to elicit robust
effects on blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity. Our diet
plans did not include rye, barley, or oats, and wheat and rice were
the major sources of whole grain in the DGA diet. Therefore,
this difference in grain products may have contributed to the lack
of improvement in fasting insulin, glucose, or insulin resistance
surrogates.
Plant-based dietary patterns with an emphasis on fruit and
vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
(32). In the current study, the usual (preintervention) total
vegetable intake (reported to be 1.2 cups/d for both diet groups;
data not shown) increased to 3.4 cups in the DGA group.
However, the true benefits from the antioxidants, carotenoids,
and other phenolics would have to be evaluated by measuring
appropriate markers in blood or other tissues before and after the
intervention, and linking these to specific changes in outcomes.
Dietary added sugars
The DGA diet provided fewer calories as added sugar than did
the TAD diet. Epidemiologic studies have reported a link between
high added-sugar consumption, primarily in the form of sugar-
sweetened beverages, with increased type 2 diabetes risk (44),
likely through weight gain with very high intakes of added sugar
(45). A recent meta-analysis and systematic review, however,
reported no association between total sugar consumption and type
2 diabetes risk (46), while also suggesting that current evidence
is limited, both in the number of studies as well as heterogeneity
of study types, to draw sound conclusions. Intervention studies
conducted in adolescents and young adults, aimed at reducing
type 2 diabetes risk factors by reducing sugar intake (to <10% of
total energy intake), do show significant improvements in glucose
and insulin iAUC, insulin secretion, and body fat (47). Our
current study did not identify a significant impact of the overall
change in dietary pattern and reduced intake of added sugar on
risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Our participants reported (albeit
via self-reports) low added-sugar intake before the intervention,
averaging 15 g/d or ∼3% of total energy intake (see Supplemental
Table 5). Even with the difference in added sugars between the
DGA (7.6% of energy) and TAD (14.2% of energy) groups,
we did not see any effects of the added-sugar contents of the
intervention diets on the outcome measures.
Dietary total and saturated fats
Studies conducted almost 3 decades ago implicated dietary
saturated fat in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (48).
Replacing saturated with mono- or polyunsaturated fats can
improve insulin sensitivity in healthy people (49). In the current
study, we reduced the saturated fat intake by 40–50% compared
with reported usual intake, whereas MUFA and PUFA intake
remained relatively similar to habitual reported intake. This
resulted in an increase in the polyunsaturated-to-saturated ratio.
Higher polyunsaturated-to-saturated ratios are associated with
a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (50). Despite these dietary
fat changes, there was no impact on type 2 diabetes risk
factors or triglyceridemia with the DGA diet, suggesting that
the classification of saturated fat, MUFAs, or PUFAs may be
too general and other considerations, such as the fat matrix or
individual fatty acids, need to be considered.
Dietary sodium and potassium
Reducing dietary sodium intake has been associated with
reduced systolic blood pressure in both individuals with and
without hypertension (51, 52). In the current study, we found
that the DGA diet resulted in an improvement in systolic blood
pressure, but no change in diastolic blood pressure. There was
also no effect of the TAD diet on blood pressure measures.
The decrease in systolic blood pressure could have been due
to reduced sodium, as well as the increased potassium in the
DGA diet (53). However, the study design did not allow for an
evaluation of the salt-specific effects on blood pressure and other
variables. Following the DASH diet recommendations, our study
supports the idea that reducing sodium intake and increasing
potassium intake reduces systolic blood pressure, despite the
lower quantity of potassium than is recommended in both DGA
and DASH studies (only matching the sodium-to-potassium ratio
with the DASH study) (54).
Diet habits and study outcomes
In an exploratory analysis, we examined whether the usual diet
consumed by each participant before entering the study might
have influenced the study outcomes. On the basis of self-reported
diet intake data, the mean preintervention HEI score of the
participants of the DGA group was 69, ∼30 points lower than the
DGA intervention diet score of 98. On the other hand, the mean
preintervention HEI score of the TAD group, 65, was very similar
to the HEI score of the TAD intervention, which was 62. The aver-
age HEI score for adults (aged 18–64 y, which is the age range in
the current study) is 58.3 (55), which is lower than that observed
in our volunteers’ habitual intake, and significantly lower than
that of the DGA diet in the current study. However, this score from
NHANES is a combination for both men and women, and may
likely be different if it is observed just in women. The DGA inter-
vention vastly improved the quality of diet for women assigned
to this group as assessed by the HEI scores. In a subset analysis,
we compared women in the DGA group who improved their HEI
score with women in the TAD group whose pretrial diet HEI was
similar or even higher than the TAD HEI score. This subject strat-
ification did not alter the overall findings—namely, no diet group
differences in the risk factors for type 2 diabetes were detected as
a result of the interventions or as a function of study week.
We monitored adherence to the intervention diets with the
use of a combination of techniques: an adherence scoring tool
(56) based on daily food logs (Supplemental Figure 1), weight
maintenance, meeting the volunteers 2 times/wk to troubleshoot
and reinforce honesty over perfection, ensuring that volunteers
ate 2 meals during the week at the research center, and continually
surveilling and documenting returned foods and packaging. Our
volunteers reported strong adherence to the study foods and low
inclusion of nonstudy foods.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of the study include the selection of “at risk”
volunteers, albeit using diverse endpoints, and the fact that the

study, although relatively small in terms of sample size, was
adequately powered to test our hypotheses. To our knowledge,
this is the first controlled-feeding trial testing the efficacy of
a diet following the food group and nutrient recommendations
of the DGA compared with a more representative American
diet. We did not observe improvements in our primary outcome
variables as a result of consuming the DGA diet pattern,
possibly due to the short, 8-wk duration of the intervention or
the heterogeneity of inclusion criteria. It is also possible that
adherence to the weight-maintenance requirement of the study in
both diet groups had benefit, which could mask between-group
differences. However, because systolic blood pressure improved
in just the DGA group we think that this change can be attributed
to the DGA. Furthermore, volunteers in the TAD group reported
more moderate physical activity than the DGA group, albeit not
significantly different, which could have affected our results. Our
sample size was appropriate for the population of women we
targeted and recruited. However, the diversity in the “at risk”
definition (to include insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and
dyslipidemia) we used to include women may have affected
our results (see Supplemental Figure 2), and a refinement in
metabolic syndrome characteristics to only focus on one outcome
may have yielded different results. Finally, because this was a
controlled-feeding trial, ad libitum intake on such a pattern and
how it affects appetite regulation was not within the scope of our
investigation. Furthermore, self-report and visual inspection of
returned food and packaging are imperfect tools for measuring
adherence. Further investigation with the use of more-objective
measurements of adherence is needed.
The DGA include other recommendations that were not
built into the design of this study, specifically that achieving
and maintaining a healthy body weight is important and that
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity should be included in
one’
s daily routine on most, if not all, days of the week.
Sustaining a practice of consuming a high-quality diet may
provide important benefits, but these other guidelines may
be critical to induce clinically meaningful improvements in
cardiometabolic health.
