Abstract
Wrinkles are just one indicator of facial aging, but an indicator that is of prime importance in our world of facial aesthetics. Wrinkles occur where fault lines
develop in aging skin. Those fault lines may be due to skin distortion resulting from facial expression or may be due to skin distortion from mechanical
compression during sleep. Expression wrinkles and sleep wrinkles differ in etiology, location, and anatomical pattern. Compression, shear, and stress forces
act on the face in lateral or prone sleep positions. We review the literature relating to the development of wrinkles and the biomechanical changes that
occur in response to intrinsic and extrinsic influences. We explore the possibility that compression during sleep not only results in wrinkles but may also
contribute to facial skin expansion.

Wrinkles are inevitable and while a few lines may be en-
dearing, most of us would prefer to keep them in check.
When we consider wrinkles we generally think of the lines
of facial expression. While facial animation is responsible
for the most significant wrinkle patterns, not all wrinkles
of the face are due to muscle contraction. Sleep wrinkles
develop in response to distortion created when the face is
pressed against any sleep surface. Compression, shear, and
stress forces result in facial distortion in side or stomach
sleeping positions. In contrast, the only external forces
acting on the face in the supine position are gravitational.
Wrinkles can become permanent with time and repeti-
tion. In a young face, wrinkling is transient with animation
and sleep wrinkles disappear on awakening. The rate and
severity of wrinkling varies as skin ages in response to in-
trinsic and extrinsic influences combined with repetition of
force patterns.
Sleep wrinkles differ from expression wrinkles in mecha-
nism of origin (external forces vs internal muscle contrac-
tion), location (wrinkles likely occur at the limits of retaining
ligaments vs site of muscle contraction), and directionality
(mostly perpendicular to each other). We suggest these are
sufficient reasons to reconsider wrinkle classification and
consider the possibility that facial distortion during sleep not
only results in sleep wrinkles, but may also contribute to
overall facial aging.
Why do wrinkles occur? Wrinkles are only one compo-
nent of a complex series of changes that occur as we age.
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine biochemical and
cellular aging changes and these, in turn, determine the
biomechanical properties and ability of skin to respond to
internal and external forces.
Wrinkle Classification
Wrinkle scales exist that are oriented toward treatment or
grading of wrinkles for comparisons.1 Various wrinkle clas-
sification systems have been proposed to categorize based
on differences in wrinkle histology and mechanism of
development.2-5 To date, sleep wrinkles have not been rec-
ognized in any classification system.
Pierard recognized 4 categories based on histological dif-
ferences and suggested causes:6-8

 (1) Atrophic wrinkles develop in exposed and non-exposed
skin, disappear with skin traction, change in orientation
with body posture, and are due to atrophy of the extra-
cellular matrix.
(2) Elastotic wrinkles develop in sun exposed skin, exhibit
solar elastosis, become progressively permanent, and
do not disappear with perpendicular traction.
(3) Expressional wrinkles due to subdermal muscle con-
traction, become permanent with repeated wrinkling.
(4) Gravitational wrinkles due to skin sagging in response
to gravitational forces and inelasticity.
Pierard’s “gravitational wrinkles” result from the impact
of external forces due to Earth’s gravity. Compression,
tension, and shear forces applied to the face during sleep
may have an even greater impact on wrinkle development
than gravity alone.
Histology of Aging Skin
Sun exposure (ultraviolet and infrared radiation), smoking,
and other extrinsic, environmental factors combine with in-
trinsic aging signals (chronologic age, hormonal status) to
produce typical histologic features of aging skin.9 The most
consistent feature of skin aging is stiffening of the stratum
corneum and dermis.10-14 Changes in dermal collagen,
elastin fiber quality, proteoglycans, and water content all
contribute to stiffening of the dermis with age.4 The more
superficial epidermis stiffens with age due to drying of the
stratum corneum.10 Increased dermal and epidermal stiff-
ness are important factors in the changes in biomechanical
properties demonstrated with age.
Reported changes in skin thickness vary considerably.
Total skin thickness is increased in sun exposed sites
(except orbital skin) and may decrease with intrinsic aging
alone.12,15,16 Overall, the dermis either thins or remains
unchanged except for the Sub-Epidermal Non-Echogenic
Band (SENEB) which characteristically increases in thick-
ness with UV exposure. The epidermis is either decreased
or unchanged with age.10,15,17,18 The dermoepidermal
junction flattens with fewer and decreased amplitude of
papillae.10,19
Biomechanics of Aging Skin
As skin ages and stiffens, it’s response to applied external
forces also changes. We can consider skin as an elastic tissue
that deforms in response to external loads including com-
pression, tension, and shear forces. Applied forces result in
deformation or strain, and are dependent on the skin’s elas-
ticity, stiffness, resilience, and extensibility. These character-
istics are dynamic and can vary in the short term and with
age.
Elasticity is the ability to recover (recoil) after extension
(stretch) and decreases with age. Extensibility and distensibility
both refer to skin’s resistance to stretch and also decrease with
age.10,13,20-23 The ability to return to its initial position after ex-
tension decreases with repeated cycles. As expected, this skin
fatigue increases with age,23,24
Human skin is also under constant internal tension, ac-
counting for Langer’s lines. They represent the direction of
maximum skin tension at any site. Necessary for growth,
young skin is isotropic, more random in directionality, with
multi-directional furrows seen on microrelief. Older skin
becomes anisotropic, more uniform in directionality, and
represents the direction of maximum tension. Fibroblasts
and collagen fibers orient based on, and parallel to, the di-
rection of tension.18,19,25-27 Ultimate directionality is then
dependent on the predominant direction of external and in-
ternal forces for each skin area.
Wrinkle Formation
Compression of young, elastic skin results in many, thin wrin-
kles whereas older, less elastic skin results in fewer, wider
wrinkles. In elastic skin, reaction to an externally applied force
will diminish gradually over a large area whereas the response
of inelastic skin will be more localized and decay abruptly over
a smaller area.10,28,29
Decreased elasticity (recoil) and decreased extensibility
(stretch) are both associated with increased wrinkle forma-
tion and both occur with age.21,28,30 Wrinkles seem to
occur when a tipping point is reached in the mechanical
balance between skin layers. It has been suggested that epi-
dermal and dermal stiffening occur at different rates and
the layers successively buckle with compression.11,12,31
Repetitive damage ultimately results in permanent wrinkles
and smaller compressive forces generate wrinkles parallel
to the direction of skin movement.31-33
Leveque examined silicone replicas of crows-feet 21 years
apart.34 Compared to early more isotropic (multi-directional)
microrelief, he found the number of wrinkles decreased with
age but increased in length and depth in chronically de-
formed skin. This is consistent with increased anisotropy
(uni-directionality) in response to persistent stress.
As expected, the site of temporary wrinkles created with
expression predicts the site of permanent wrinkles. More in-
teresting, the severity of temporary wrinkles predicts a faster
rate of permanent wrinkle development.34,35 In an 8 year
longitudinal study, the combination of mechanical stress
and degree of skin inelasticity were important determinants
of both age of onset and rate of permanent wrinkling.35,36
The rate of wrinkle formation was highest in women who
were in their 40s and in early menopause compared to those
who were in their teens or 60s at baseline. Menopausal state,
dryness of the skin, and surface pH, even controlling for age
correlated with rate of wrinkling.
While the mechanism for expression wrinkle develop-
ment seems clear, the importance of facial distortion during

 sleep needs further consideration. Distortion can result in
wrinkles, but can it also impact facial aging by skin expan-
sion? There are possible models for external facial distortion
causing not only sleep wrinkles, but also contributing to
further biomechanical changes.
Tissue expansion is an example of skin “stretch” and
slowly increasing expander volume results in short term and
permanent changes, especially in the dermis.37,38 Rapid
intraoperative tissue expansion has similar effect. Although
it requires very high applied forces, external tissue expansion
does not require undermining so may offer a model closer to
sleep distortion.39
We now know that external (and internal) mechanical
forces can signal biochemical changes in the skin. This
mechano-chemical transduction network allows remodel-
ing of epidermal, dermal and matrix components.40-42
Transduction of mechanical signals may have broader rel-
evance. Turlier37 has suggested that injection of hyaluronic
acid results in dermal and subdermal stretch. This strain
change may then activate signaling pathways that result, in
this case, to neocollagenesis. Similarly, Botulinum neurotox-
in A may have a long-term effect on skin biomechanical
properties contributing to improved skin elasticity beyond
the duration of obvious muscle weakness.22
Sleep Wrinkles
The concept of sleep wrinkles is not new.43-45 Fulton et al
postulated that sleep wrinkles develop due to sleep position
and site of SMAS condensation.43 They described the most
common sites that sleep wrinkles develop. Polisak attempt-
ed to show sleep wrinkles in situ using a transparent poly-
vinyl chloride (PVC) pillow.45
During side or stomach sleeping, facial tissue is subject
to shear, compression, and tensile mechanical forces
(Figure 1). The skin is stretched and pulled in all directions
with changes in sleep position. These forces become signif-
icant when we consider the amount of time spent in sleep
and sleep position.
During sleep, the spinal column unloads, intervertebral
discs rehydrate, discs regain elasticity, and peri-spinal muscles
relax.46,47 While our initial sleep position is a conscious deci-
sion, we change positions throughout the night as our bodies
unconsciously attempt to minimize ischemia and discom-
fort.47,48 With age, the number of position shifts decrease from
27 to 16 per night, with an average of 20 position shifts per
night.47-50 Consequently, the time spent in each position in-
creases with age. The lateral sleep position is most common in
all studies averaging 65% lateral, 30% supine, and 5%
prone.47,48,50 It is uncommon for an individual to spend 100%
of their sleep time in a single sleep position.
Wrinkles of facial expression begin as many, small,
superficial creases perpendicular to the axis of muscle con-
traction and parallel to the axis of skin compression. As
skin loses elasticity and stiffens, they progress to fewer,
deeper creases which become permanent with repetition
and age. We expect the same process to occur regardless of
the source of force. The rate of onset and severity would
similarly vary with genetics, sun exposure, smoking, and
hormonal status.

 Lines of facial expression (Figure 2A) are commonly rec-
ognizable and easily confirmed by replication with anima-
tion. Careful examination of the face, however, reveals
other wrinkles that cannot be reproduced with animation
(Figure 2B). These sleep lines are easily reproducible with a
hand, by imitating compression caused by sleep. They tend
to be perpendicular to expression lines. We have identified
the most common sleep wrinkles (Figure 3).
Figures 4 and 5 identify multiple sleep wrinkle sites in a
single patient. The cause of the proposed sleep wrinkles
can be demonstrated with maneuvers to simulate comp-
ressive forces (Figures 5 and 6). Animation does not
significantly reproduce sleep wrinkles as seen in Figures 4
and 7.
The development of sleep wrinkles appears less predict-
able than expression wrinkles. This is expected if we
consider the greater number of variables that influence
sleep wrinkle development. First, the age of onset, rate
of development, and severity of any wrinkle type shows
a wide range among a given population. Susceptibility to

 wrinkling is dependent on genetics, age, hormonal status,
and environmental exposure. Sleep wrinkle pattern will be
additionally influenced by how much time is spent in
various positions, how much force is applied to each area
of the face, and surface area of contact. Expression wrinkles
have little variation in the direction of applied forces.
The system of retaining ligaments of the face have been
described by Furnas, Mendelson, Pessa, and others.51-56
Sleep wrinkles seem to occur at sites where the skin buckles
in response to external forces applied (Videos 1 and 2, avail-
able as Supplementary Material at www.aestheticsurgery-
journal.com). The greatest impact of the forces are expected
to be in the areas where skin is most tethered to underlying
attachments, where retaining ligaments of the face anchor
skin to underlying bone (Figure 8). The overlying skin can
be thought of as seaweed that sways while tethered to a stalk
or retaining ligament. A wrinkle would be expected to occur
along the periphery of the mobile skin segment. Indeed,
sleep wrinkles are mostly seen at the expected sites associat-
ed with retaining ligaments. Only the central medial sleep
wrinkles are not associated with a true retaining ligament.
These include the medial cheek crease at the nasal/cheek
junction, nasal lip crease, and corner lip crease.
Sleep patterns can also reinforce expression lines. Skin
will buckle along weak areas or faults in the superficial
skin layers.3,32 We have observed reinforcement of upper
lip radial expression lines due to sleep position. Although a
wrinkle may initially be caused by muscle contraction, the
wrinkle appears to worsen due to compression as seen in
Figures 7D and 9A. The presence of a crease from any
cause provides an additional fault line that may be prefer-
entially followed. Kotlus did not find an association
between sleep side and wrinkles.57 However, they looked
at all wrinkles and did not differentiate wrinkle types. They
also relied on subjective questionnaires to determine sleep
position which is much more variable than subjects esti-
mate.
DISCUSSION
Wrinkles of facial expression are the most important type of
facial wrinkle and occupy much of the dermatologist’s and
plastic surgeon’s time outside the operating room. However,
review of the literature on facial wrinkles supports recogni-
tion of sleep wrinkles as distinct from expression wrinkles
with a different etiology. Sleep wrinkles could be grouped
with gravitational wrinkles in existing wrinkle classification
systems. Conceptually, they both develop in response to ex-
ternal forces and are influenced by ligamentous attachments.
Few individuals sleep entirely on their back without some
component of non-gravitational forces acting during sleep.
The interplay between sleep forces, internal forces and
aging changes are more complex than gravitational effects
alone.
Facial distortion in sleep contributes to the appearance
of aging with the development of sleep wrinkles which
alone
affect
aesthetic
appearance.

 contribution to aging may be due to the effects of sleep
distortion on the bioelastic properties of skin. We postu-
late a mechanism where skin distortion can act as external
skin expansion. Sleep distortion itself may result in
progressive increases in maximum extension and residual
deformation. Both can occur due to creep (further
extension over time with a constant load), or in response
to cyclic repetition. Some skin expansion seems likely,
and combined with volume loss and other aging factors
may contribute to the appearance of aging. Further study
is warranted to evaluate the importance of distortion on
skin aging.

 CONCLUSION
Treatment options for sleep wrinkles and improvement in
distortion are more limited than those for expression wrin-
kles. Facelift and other tightening procedures will decrease
the amount of skin available to buckle and possibly alter
skin attachments. Fillers can temporarily improve wrinkles
of any type. Mechanical stress contributes to the progression
of temporary to permanent expression lines. Neurotoxin use
improves or prevents wrinkles by eliminating mechanical
stress. However, neurotoxins should have no effect on true
sleep wrinkles since they are not caused by muscle contrac-
tion. The only reliable way to minimize sleep wrinkles is to
avoid facial distortion.
While we recommend back sleeping, it is extremely diffi-
cult to consciously change sleep patterns. Our initial sleep
position is a choice, however we unconsciously change
position throughout the night. The supine position may be
ideal for facial aesthetics but can aggravate conditions includ-
ing sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, and severe snoring.
Specialty pillows now exist that are designed to minimize
facial deformation during sleep (Figure 9). It can take up to 4
weeks to accommodate to a change in bedding system.47,49,58
As plastic surgeons, we advise our patients to control
the variables that influence aging based on current under-
standing. We advise our patients use sunscreen to mini-
mize photoaging, quit smoking, optimize nutrition, and
maximize topical skin care. We should add avoidance of
facial compression during sleep to that list. While avoiding
the development of sleep wrinkles may be important, it is
the facial distortion and its’ potential impact on overall
facial aging that may be even more important. The conse-
quence of repetitive stretching of facial tissue over time is
intriguing and warrants further study.
