Oligomeric species populated during the aggregation process of a-synuclein have been
linked to neuronal impairment in Parkinson’s disease and related neurodegenerative
disorders. By using solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in
conjunction with other structural methods, we identified the fundamental characteristics
that enable toxic a-synuclein oligomers to perturb biological membranes and disrupt cellular
function; these include a highly lipophilic element that promotes strong membrane
interactions and a structured region that inserts into lipid bilayers and disrupts their
integrity. In support of these conclusions, mutations that target the region that promotes
strong membrane interactions by a-synuclein oligomers suppressed their toxicity in
neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons.
T
he aggregation of a-synuclein (aS) into am-
yloid fibrils within Lewy bodies is associ-
ated with Parkinson’s disease and a range
of other debilitating neurodegenerative dis-
orders (1–9). The primary pathogenic agents
in these conditions are thought to be the oligo-
meric species populated during the self-assembly of
aS, particularly through their aberrant interac-
tions with biological membranes (10–16). Here
we investigated two types of stabilized aS oligo-
mers with considerably different toxicities (17, 18),
which we designated as type A* and type B*. Their
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
signatures (Fig. 1A), as well as other structural
and biological properties (Fig. 1), closely match
those of the previously identified transient forms
of nontoxic (type A) and toxic (type B) aS oligo-
mers (19).
The two oligomeric forms of aS had similar
sizes and morphologies (Fig. 1, B and C), yet
exhibited very different abilities to disrupt lipid
bilayers. When incubated in vitro with small uni-
lamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of 1-palmitoyl-
2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine(POPS)lipids,
type-A* oligomers induced only a marginal re-
lease of encapsulated calcein molecules, compa-
rable to that induced by aS monomers and mature
fibrils (Fig. 1D). By contrast, type-B* oligomers
induced greater than 10 times more calcein re-
lease, indicating that these oligomers generate
considerable disruption of acidic lipid bilayers
(Fig. 1D). We observed similar loss of membrane
integrity in vivo upon incubation of type-B* aS
oligomers with human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cells and rat primary cortical neurons and only
marginal effects upon incubation with type-A*
oligomers, monomers, and mature fibrils of aS
(Fig. 1, E and G).
The remarkable disruption of synthetic and
cellular membranes by type-B* aS oligomers, but
not type-A* species, was strongly correlated with
their ability to generate cellular toxicity. Thus,
type-B* aS oligomers—but not monomers, type-A*
oligomers, and aS fibrils—induced substantial
increases of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS, fig. S1A) and reduced the mitochondrial
activity in neuronal cells [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide(MTT)assay,
Fig. 1F]. The cellular damage that type-B* aS oligo-
mers induced in this manner reproduces a variety
of pathophysiological effects observed in neuro-
nal models of PD that were obtained by inducing
pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons from a pa-
tient with triplication of the aS gene (20–22).
To probe the structural properties of the two
types of aS oligomers, we used solid-state nucle-
ar magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy.

 Correlations between carbon atoms of residues
located in rigid regions of the oligomers were
detected using 13C–13C dipolar-assisted rotational
resonance (DARR) correlation spectra, measured
using magic angle spinning (MAS). 13C–3C DARR
spectra of type-A* and type-B* oligomers revealed
fundamental differences in the structural nature
of the two species (Fig. 2A), with considerable
b-sheet content identified in the rigid regions of
the type-B* oligomers and negligible secondary-
structure content associated with the rigid regions
of type-A* oligomers (Fig. 2A and fig. S2). The
assignment of the 13C–13C DARR peaks was per-
formed using an approach (23–25) that combines
information from solution-state chemical ex-
change saturation transfer (CEST) (23, 26, 27)
(see supplementary methods and fig. S3) with
known assignments of fibrillar (5) and monomeric
(25) states of aS. This approach revealed that the
resonances in the 13C–13C DARR spectra of the
two types of oligomers belong to specific regions
spanning residues 3 to 36 and 70 to 88 in type-A*
and type-B* species, respectively (table S1).
Highly mobile regions of the two forms of aS
oligomers were detected by using insensitive nu-
clei enhanced by polarization transfer (INEPT)
measurements in MAS ssNMR (Fig. 2B). Both
types of oligomers contained a large number of
highly mobile residues (45 in type A* and 67 in
type B*, table S1), whose resonances overlapped
with those in the 1H–13C heteronuclear single-
quantum coherence spectra of disordered mono-
meric aS in solution (fig. S4). Although both
oligomeric species possessed a flexible C-terminal
region (43 and 40 highly mobile C-terminal res-
idues for type A* and type B*, respectively), the
N-terminal region of aS was highly dynamic only
in the type-B* oligomers (0 and 26 highly mobile
N-terminal residues for type A* and type B*, re-
spectively). Furthermore, the mobile regions of
the type-A* aS oligomers also included residues
from the nonamyloid-b component (NAC) region
(Fig. 2B), a finding consistent with the low FRET
efficiency observed for the type-A* oligomers rel-
ative to that for the type-B* oligomers when the
fluorophores were attached to residue 90, itself
located in the NAC region (Fig. 1A).
The ssNMR characterization of the two types
of aS oligomers was supported by Fourier trans-
form infrared spectroscopy measurements (fig.
S5), which showed signals characteristic of both
random-coil and b-sheet structure in the case of
the type-B* aS oligomers but indicated a predom-
inantly unstructured conformation for the type-A*
species. Further indication of the association with
the core of the oligomers in type-A* and type-B*
species was provided by CEST experiments (fig.
S3). Type-A* oligomers revealed extensive satu-
ration in the 40 N-terminal residues of the pro-
tein, indicating strong association of this region
with the core of the oligomers. For type-B* oligo-
mers, CEST experiments showed no saturation
associated with either the N- or C- terminal re-
gions of the protein or with residues of three of
the four major hydrophobic segments of the aS
sequence (residues 36 to 41, 47 to 56, and 88 to
95), in contrast to the strong saturation observed
for the hydrophobic segment of residues 70 to
79. The identification of highly dynamic regions
in the two types of aS oligomers was consistent
with a dot blot analysis carried out using a pri-
mary antibody that binds the N-terminal region
of aS. This indicated that the N-terminal region
is more accessible in type-B* than in type-A*
species (fig. S6). By contrast, dot blot analysis
carried out using a primary antibody targeting
the C-terminal region of aS indicated that the C
terminus is accessible to a similar extent in both
types of oligomers (fig. S6).
We next probed the interaction of the two
types of aS oligomers with SUVs composed of
DOPE:DOPS:DOPC lipids in a ratio of 5:3:2 (see
supplementary methods), which are good mimics
of synaptic vesicles for composition and physical
properties (24, 25) (DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-
3-phosphoethanolamine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phospho-L-serine; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine). Fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) in combination with confocal
microscopy showed that both types of oligomers
bind the SUVs with high affinity, with the type-B*
oligomers binding more strongly relative to the
type-A* species (Fig. 3A and fig. S7). Type-B* aS
oligomers also colocalized with the plasma mem-
brane of primary cortical neurons (Fig. 3B).
To characterize the levels of membrane in-
sertion of the two types of aS oligomers, we car-
ried out paramagnetic relaxation enhancement
(PRE) experiments using MAS ssNMR, in which
small quantities of lipid molecules labeled with a
paramagnetic center (PC) were incorporated into
the bilayers (24, 25). When the PC was located in
the hydrophilic head groups of the lipid mole-
cules (see supplementary methods), selective
quenching of a number of 13C–13C DARR reso-
nances was observed in the spectra of both types
of aS oligomers (fig. S8). This indicates, in both
cases, strong interactions with the membrane
surface. By contrast, when the PC was positioned

 within the interior of the lipid bilayer, enhanced
relaxation of 13C–13C DARR resonances was ob-
served only for the type-B* oligomers (Fig. 3C);
this suggests that type-B* oligomers can insert
into the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer,
whereas the type-A* oligomers remain bound
exclusively to the membrane surface (Fig. 3, E
and F). In addition, the 1H–13C INEPT spectra of
the type-B* oligomers showed peak broadening
only in PRE experiments performed when the PC
was located in the lipid head groups (fig. S9); this
suggests that dynamic regions of type-B* oligo-
mers do not insert in the hydrophobic interior of
the lipid bilayer.
To characterize the structural nature of the
regions of aS that are tightly bound to the lipid
bilayers in the two types of oligomers, we mea-
sured 13C–13C DARR spectra at –19°C (Fig. 3D).
This condition enhances the 13C-13C DARR sig-
nals of the protein regions that are tightly bound
with the surface of this type of acidic lipid mem-
brane (24, 25). In the case of the type-A* oligo-
mers, we observed an additional set of peaks
whose resonances are characteristic of lysine
residues, which are abundant in the region of
residues 1 to 97 of the aS sequence. The broad
linewidths of these resonances, however, indi-
cated the absence of a defined structural motif
of type-A* oligomers that is tightly bound to the
membrane. By contrast, for the type-B* species,
we observed a set of additional resonances that
closely matched those of the N-terminal 25 resi-
dues of monomeric aS bound to SUVs in an
amphipathic a-helical conformation (12, 25, 28).
Thus, the N-terminal region in the toxic oligo-
mers is involved in promoting strong membrane
interactions.
We next examined the effects that mutations
in the N-terminal region of aS exert on the ability
of type-B* oligomers to disrupt biological mem-
branes and induce cellular toxicity. The aS variant
aSA30P (A30P, alanine-to-proline substitution at
residue 30) is associated with an early onset form
of Parkinson’s disease and reduces the membrane
affinity of the N-terminal region of aS (24). We
also examined a truncated form of the protein
lacking residues 2 to 9 (aSD2–9), a key region in-
volved in anchoring the N-terminal region of aS
to lipid membranes (25, 29). In vitro measure-
ments of calcein release from POPS SUVs showed
intermediate and negligible levels of membrane
disruption by type-B* oligomers formed from
aSA30P and aSD2–9, respectively, compared to the
effects of wild-type aS (aSWT) type-B* oligomers
(fig. S10A). Similar trends were observed in the
disruption of cellular membranes by these species
(fig. S10B) and in their colocalization with the
plasma membrane (fig. S10, D and E). The partial
and total impairment of the binding and disruption
of cellular membranes by type-B* oligomers of
aSA30P andaSD2–9, respectively, correlated highly
with the levels of cellular toxicity generated by
these species (MTT in fig. S10C and ROS in fig. S1B).
It is well established that the toxic forms of
amyloid-related aggregates of many proteins
bind to membranes and disrupt cellular function
(1, 14). Here we have identified specific structural
elements of aS oligomers that give rise to cellu-
lar toxicity by disrupting the integrity of biolog-
ical membranes (Fig. 3F and fig. S11). In primary
neurons and astrocytes, this leads to an increase
in the amounts of basal intracellular Ca2+ and of
ROS and, consequently, a loss of cellular viability
(20, 21). The first structural element is an ex-
posed highly lipophilic region of the protein in
the oligomers that promotes strong interactions
with the membrane surface. The second is a rigid
oligomeric core that is rich in b-sheet structure
and is able to insert into the lipid bilayer and
disrupt the membrane integrity. These conclu-
sions are strongly supported by the introduction
of specific mutations that partially (A30P) or
completely (D2–9) suppress the membrane affin-
ity of the N-terminal sequence of the protein.

this protein to disrupt cellular membranes and,
