AIMS
Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis. India has among the highest resistance rates and antibiotic con-
sumption internationally. Extensive use of fixed-dose combination (FDC) antibiotics and of unapproved formulations are claimed
contributory factors but there has been no systematic examination of formulations or volumes sold. The aim of the present study
was to investigate the regulatory approval status and sales volumes of systemic antibiotics marketed in India.
METHODS
This was an ecological study using regulatory records in India, the UK and the US to determine the approval status in each country
of systemic antibiotic FDCs and single-drug formulations (SDFs) sold in India. Pharmatrac® sales data were used to determine the
formulations and volumes sold (2007–2012), branded-product numbers and manufacturers.
RESULTS
Of 118 systemic antibiotic FDC formulations sold in India, 43 (36%) were approved but 75 (64%) had no record of regulatory
approval; four (3%) formulations were approved in the UK and/or US. Almost half of formulations (58/118; 49%) comprised dual
antimicrobials, most unapproved in India (43/58; 74%), and many were pharmacologically problematic. In contrast, 80/86
(93%) SDFs were approved in India and over two-thirds in the UK and/or US. Total antibiotic sales increased by 26%, from 2056
million units (2007–08) to 2583 million units (2011–12). FDC sales rose by 38% vs. 20% for SDFs. By 2011–12, FDCs comprised
one-third of sales (872 million units). Over one-third of FDCs sold (300.26 million units; 34.5%) were of unapproved formulations.
Multinational companies manufactured unapproved formulations and accounted for 19% of all FDC and SDF sales annually.
CONCLUSIONS
Sales in India of antibiotic FDCs, including unapproved formulations, are rising. In the context of increasing AMR rates nationally
and globally, unapproved antibiotic FDCs undermine India’s national AMR strategy and should be banned from sale.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• India has among the highest rates globally of antimicrobial resistance and of antibiotic consumption.
• Prescription medicines must have central regulatory approval before they can be sold.
• Indian government reports claim extensive use of unapproved fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations of
antibiotics.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• There were 118 antibiotic FDC formulations on the market in India (2007–2012) compared with four in the UK and/or US.
• Only 43 of the 118 antibiotic FDC formulations (36%) had central regulatory approval; 75 (64%) were unapproved, even
though the sale of unapproved new drugs is illegal in India.
• Multinational companies (MNCs) manufactured 53 of the 118 FDC formulations; only 33 (62%) of these were Central
Drugs Standard Control Organization-approved and four were Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency/European Medicines Agency- and /or Food and Drug Administration-approved formulations.
• Total antibiotic sales volumes increased by 26%, from 2056 million units (2007–08) to 2583 million units (2011–12); FDC
sales rose by 38% vs. 20% for single-drug formulations (SDFs).
• By 2011–12, FDCs comprised one-third of systemic antibiotic sales (872 million units) but over one-third of FDCs sold
(300 million units; 34.5%) were of unapproved formulations.
• MNCs accounted for almost 20% of FDC and SDF sales annually.
Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an acknowledged global cri-
sis but antibiotic consumption is rising, despite access for
many being poor [1–4]. In 2015, the World Health Assembly
endorsed a five-point AMR global action plan [5], and the
World Health Organization (WHO) has urged its adoption.
For decades, the WHO has promoted rational medicines use
and universal access through its Model List of Essential
Medicines, which acts as a guide for individual national lists
of essential medicines (NLEMs) [6]. The WHO classifies
antibiotics in ascending order of priority: important, highly
important, critically important and highest priority critically
important [7]. Highest priority critically important antibiotics
are those for which loss of efficacy due to resistance would
have a major impact on human health owing to high numbers
of people affected by infections for which they are the sole
treatment, or one of few effective treatments. They include
third/fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones,
glycopeptides and macrolides.
During 2000–2010, antibiotic sales across 71 countries
rose by 36% [8]. Five countries (Brazil, China, India,
Russia, South Africa) accounted for 76% of the increase.
Consumption per capita was highest in India, a major pro-
ducer of antibiotics with a fragile health system and
among the highest rates globally of AMR [2, 8, 9]. Parlia-
mentary investigations have highlighted failures of its
drug regulatory system, including approvals of ‘irrational’
fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations of antibiotics
and marketing of FDCs unapproved by the national regu-
lator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization
(CDSCO), despite the sale or supply of unapproved new
drugs being unlawful in India [10–16]. The availability of
FDCs ‘not approved anywhere in the world’ has been criti-
cized and a recommendation made that such formulations
‘may not be cleared for use in India unless there is a specific
disease or disorder prevalent in India, or a very specific reason
backed by scientific evidence and irrefutable data applicable
specifically to India, that justifies the approval of a particular
FDC.’[10] However, no systematic examination has been
conducted of antibiotic FDCs available in India or of their
approval status.
FDCs
FDCs are formulations comprising two or more drugs
combined in a fixed ratio of doses and available in a single
dosage form. Some antibiotic FDCs comprise an antibiotic
plus non-antibiotic drug – e.g. amoxicillin (a beta-lactam
antibiotic) plus clavulanic acid (an inactivation inhibitor)
[17]. Others include dual antimicrobials – e.g. trimethoprim
plus sulfamethoxazole [18]. Dual antimicrobial FDCs are
appropriate in well-defined situations where a particular
combination is of proven efficacy, doses are stable through-
out treatment and the drugs have compatible pharmacolog-
ical characteristics. Dual antimicrobial FDCs are to be
distinguished from the concomitant use of two antibiotics
as single-drug formulations (SDFs). While infection treat-
ment guidelines recommend two antibiotics in some situa-
tions, the antibiotics and their doses vary depending on
epidemiological, host and drug factors, and they are pre-
scribed as SDFs [19–24].
Evaluating drug consumption in India
The AMR global action plan [5] urges improved surveil-
lance of antimicrobial use, but for many countries, includ-
ing India, this is challenging. Studies using antibiotic sales
data as a proxy for use have demonstrated rising sales of
individual antibiotics and pharmacological groups but have
not reported the formulations sold or their approval status
[1, 8, 24, 25]. We therefore analysed systemic antibiotic
sales in India during a 5-year period, 2007–2012, according
to formulation (FDC or SDF) and approval in India and two
other countries, the UK and US. We determined if formula-
tions were listed in the NLEM-India, if they included
highest priority critically important antibiotics [7] and if
they were manufactured by multinational pharmaceutical
companies (MNCs) as well as by Indian companies.

 Aim
To examine the systemic antibiotic formulations sold in India
in the context of their regulation and governance for licens-
ing and to determine if these formulations were approved in
the UK and/or the US.
Objectives
To identify the FDC and single drug formulations on the
Indian market, determine their regulatory approval status in
India, the UK and the US and their NLEM-India listing.
To
examine
12-monthly
sales
trends
(2007–2012),
identify the top-selling antibiotic formulations (2011–12),
and determine sales of WHO-designated ‘highest-priority-
critically-important’ antibiotics categorised in each case
according to approval.
To determine the numbers of branded products on the mar-
ket and manufacture by multi124 national companies (MNCs).
Methods
This was an ecological study quantifying systemic antibiotic
sales in India during 2007–2012 and including a cross-sectional
analysis of the individual formulations sold in 2011–12.
Data sources
Drug sales data.
These were obtained from PharmaTrac®, a
commercial database of Indian pharmaceutical sales [26].
The data comprised monthly sales audits collected through
multiple routes (some 5000 pharmaceutical companies,
18 000 distributers/stockists, 32 000 sub-stockists, 500 000
retailers and hospitals, and dispensing doctors in 23 regions
of India). The audits captured 35% of national sales and
were projected to estimate total national sales. The data
included formulation composition, generic and branded
product names, manufacturers, sales volumes and value,
and date of market launch. Sales volumes were reported
monthly in units (a strip of 10 tablets/capsules or one bottle
(liquid formulations) for oral drugs or one injection for
parenteral drugs). Formulations were coded according to
therapy type and treatment group. For example, the FDC
ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (J1D42) was an anti-infective
in the cephalosporin group of systemic antibacterial agents.
Approvals in India.
The CDSCO website published approvals
for FDCs from 1961–2014 and for SDFs from 1971–2011
[27–29]. Listed chronologically, they included formulation
content, indication and approval date. For the purposes of
the present study, we assumed that CDSCO records were
complete. State drug authority records of licences granted
for drug manufacture/distribution/sale were unavailable.
Approvals in the UK and USA.
The Medicines and Healthcare
Products
Regulatory
Agency
(MHRA)
and/or
European
Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) websites were used to determine the approval status in
the UK and US, respectively, of antibiotic formulations sold in
India [30–32].
NLEM-India.
The 2011 list was used to determine the
antibiotics
recommended
for
use
in
India
by
a
core
committee of experts from the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare during the period of the cross-sectional analysis of
sales, 2011–2012 [6].
Data Extraction
We examined PharmaTrac® data for the period October 2007
to November 2012. Systemic antibiotic formulations were
identified independently by two people (P.M., A.K.). Infor-
mation was extracted in duplicate onto Excel® spreadsheets.
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We excluded anti-
tuberculosis and primary antifungal or antiviral formula-
tions. We categorized systemic antibiotics according to FDC
and SDFs. We subdivided FDCs into formulations compris-
ing: (i) dual antimicrobials – e.g. two antibiotics or one antibi-
otic plus an antiprotozoal or antiviral agent; or (ii) one
antibiotic plus other agents – e.g. amoxicillin plus clavulanic
acid (a beta-lactamase inhibitor). Although they have some
antimicrobial activity, we did not consider beta-lactamase in-
hibitors as antibiotics in their own right because they are not
used as antibiotic monotherapy, so we did not count these
combinations as dual antimicrobials. We counted the num-
bers of brand-named products arising from each formulation,
and the numbers of manufacturers, and noted whether the
manufacturer was Indian or an MNC. We summed monthly
sales volumes (in millions of units) to examine sales during
five 12-month periods from October 2007 to November
2012, where one unit was a strip of 10 oral tablets or capsules,
one injection vial or one bottle of oral medicine.
Formulations
were
further
categorized
by
CDSCO,
MHRA/EMA and FDA approval status, and by NLEM-India list-
ing. For approvals, we focused on the first approval granted. A
formulation was deemed ‘approved’ if ever recorded in the reg-
ulators’ lists of approved medicines, irrespective of dose
amount or modified release variations, and ‘unapproved’ if it
was not included. We adhered to Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology - Anti-Microbial
Studies (STROBE-AMS) guidelines for reporting [33].
Results
FDCs and SDFs marketed in India
There were 132 systemic antibiotic FDC formulations listed
in PharmaTrac; 118/132 FDCs specified the full formulation,
permitting regulatory approval to be determined (‘known
formulations’, Table 1); 13/132 FDCs were described as
‘combinations’, naming the antibiotic but not the other
formulation components. ‘Combinations’ comprised <1%
of antibiotic sales in 2011–12 (Table S1). The study analyses
are based on the 118 ‘known formulations’. There were 86
SDF antibiotics listed in PharmaTrac.

Of the 118 FDC formulations, 43 (36%) were CDSCO
approved and 75 (64%) had no record of approval; 4(3.4%)
were approved in the UK and US; two (2%) were NLEM listed
(Figure 1).

 Sixty FDC formulations (51%) comprised one antibiotic
plus agents including beta-lactamase inhibitors, lactobacil-
lus, mucolytic agents and secretolytic agents. Of these,
28/60 (47%) were CDSCO-approved, 32/60 (53%) had no
record of approval and 3/60 (5%) were approved by the
MHRA/EMA and/or FDA (amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid,
piperacillin plus tazobactam, imipenem plus cilastatin)
(Table S1_FDC118).
Fifty-eight FDC formulations (49%) comprised dual anti-
microbials: 36 were two antibiotics; 17 were an antibiotic plus
an antiprotozoal drug; and five were an antibiotic with
another antimicrobial (e.g. antifungal, antiviral) (Figure 1).
Fifteen dual antimicrobial formulations (26%) were CDSCO
approved and 43 (74%) were unapproved; one (trimethoprim
plus sulfamethoxazole) was approved by the MHRA/EMA and
FDA (Table S1_FDC118).
SDFs.
Of the 86 SDF antibiotics, 80 (93%) were or were likely
to be, CDSCO approved (Figure 1): 62 had approval listed; six
had CDSCO-granted European import licences; two were
NLEM 2011 listed; and 10 had been discovered in the
1950s–1960s, with approval possibly granted prior to 1971,
the earliest CDSCO SDF approval record. Six SDFs (7%) had
no record of CDSCO approval. Twenty-two SDFs (26%) were
NLEM listed, 57 (66%) were MHRA/EMA approved, and 62
(72%) were FDA approved (Figure 1).
T
otal systemic antibiotic sales
Table 1 shows the systemic antibiotic 12-monthly sales
volumes during the 5-year period examined (November
2007–October 2012). Total systemic sales (FDCs plus SDFs)
increased by 26%, from 2055.86 million units in 2007–08 to
2583.07 million units in 2011–12, with FDCs rising by 38%,
and SDFs by 20%. The FDC proportion of annual sales
increased from 31% to 34%, while the SDF proportion fell
from 69% to 66% (Table 1).
FDC sales.
In 2007–08, 53% of FDC sales comprised CDSCO-
approved formulations (Table 1, Figure 2). By 2011–12, this
had increased to 66%. Dual antimicrobials comprised 56% of
FDC sales in 2011–12, most being unapproved formulations
(Figure 2). In total, less than half of FDC sales were of
MHRA/EMA-approved and/or FDA-approved formulations,
and fewer than one-third were NLEM listed (Figure 2).
SDF sales.
Almost all SDF sales were of CDSCO-approved
formulations – 97% in 2007–08 and 98% in 2011–12. Over
90% were MHRA/EMA approved and/or FDA approved, and
two-thirds were NLEM listed (Figure 2).

Table 2, comprised 61% of total FDC sales in 2011–12; 10/20
were dual antimicrobial formulations; 7/20 formulations
had no record of CDSCO approval; 17/20 were unapproved
by the MHRA/EMA and FDA. The two NLEM-listed FDCs
(amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and trimethoprim plus
sulfamethoxazole) together accounted for 29% of sales in
2011–12.
SDFs.
Ceftriaxone was the top-selling SDF, followed by
cefixime, metronidazole and cefotaxime. The 20 top-selling
SDFs, listed in Table 3, comprised 87% of total SDF sales in
2011–12. All had or were likely to have, CDSCO approval;
all had MHRA/EMA approval; 19/20 had FDA approval.
NLEM-listed SDFs made up 65% of SDF sales.

FDCs.
In 2011–12, 42% of FDC sales in India included WHO-
designated highest priority critically important antibiotics
(Table S1). Eight formulations were dual antimicrobial FDCs:
azithromycin plus ofloxacin, cefixime plus azithromycin,
cefixime plus ofloxacin, cefpodoxime plus azithromycin,
cefpodoxime plus levofloxacin, cefpodoxime plus ofloxacin,
ceftriaxone plus vancomycin, levofloxacin plus azithromycin.
They made up 5% of FDC sales volumes in 2011–12. Two
formulations were CDSCO approved (cefixime plus ofloxacin,
cefpodoxime
plus ofloxacin). None
was
FDA
approved,
MHRA/EMA approved or NLEM listed.
SDFs.
Among SDFs, highest priority critically important

54%
of
sales
in
2011–12,
and
carbapenems and polymixins comprised 0.4% of sales.
Numbers of brand-named products and
manufacture by MNCs
FDCs.
The 118 FDC formulations gave rise to 3307 brand-
named products, made by 476 manufacturers, of which 464
were based in India and 11 were MNCs. The FDCs with the
greatest numbers of products were: ofloxacin plus ornidazole,
382 branded products made by 279 manufacturers; amoxicillin
plus clavulanic acid, 293 products, 189 manufacturers; and
ciprofloxacin plus tinidazole, 208 products, 147 manufacturers
(Table S1_FDCproducts).
MNCs manufactured 53/118 (45%) FDC formulations
(Figure 1; Table S1_FDCproducts). These gave rise to 148
brand-named products, manufactured by 11 MNCs including
Abbott, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),
Merck/MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis and Wyeth.
Twenty-eight MNC-manufactured formulations were dual
antimicrobials: 19 with two antibiotics (e.g. ampicillin plus
dicloxacillin,
ceftriaxone
plus
vancomycin);
and
nine
with an antibiotic plus antiprotozoal (e.g. ciprofloxacin

without CDSCO approval, 18 were manufactured by Abbott.
Some other MNCs each manufactured 1–3 unapproved
formulations (Table S1_FDCproducts).
Of the eight formulations comprising two highest priority
critically important antibiotics, all were manufactured by In-
dian pharmaceutical companies and five were manufactured
by Abbott but none were manufactured by other MNCs.
SDFs.
The 86 SDF antibiotics gave rise to 4934 branded
products, made by 532 manufacturers; 515 were based in
India and 13 were MNCs. The antibiotics with the greatest
numbers of products were: ofloxacin, 443 branded products
made by 303 manufacturers; azithromycin, 370 products, 263
manufacturers; cefixime, 341 products; 228 manufacturers
(Table S1_SDFproducts).
MNCs manufactured 62/86 (72%) SDF formulations
(Figure 1; Table S1_SDFproducts). These gave rise to 250
brand-named products, manufactured by 13 MNCs. Fifty-
eight MNC-manufactured SDFs (58/62; 94%) were CDSCO
approved/likely to be approved, 47/62 (76%) were FDA
approved and 44/62 (71%) were MHRA/EMA approved

FDCs and SDFs comprised approximately 19% of both FDC
and SDF sales annually. Among the 20 top-selling FDC and
SDF formulations, 90% and 100%, respectively, were MNC
manufactured (Tables 3 and 4).
Discussion
India was recently shown to be the largest consumer of
antibiotics per capita among 71 countries, and to have
increasing levels of consumption [8]. Our study demon-
strated, for the first time, that its high consumption is
led by rising sales of FDCs of antibiotics, the majority un-
approved by the national drugs regulator, the CDSCO.
The study confirmed parliamentary committee observa-
tions that most FDCs available in India have not been
approved by regulators elsewhere, and also found that
MNCs are among those manufacturing unapproved FDC
formulations.
Of 118 antibiotic FDC formulations on the market during
2007–2012, almost two-thirds had no record of CDSCO
approval and only four were approved by UK and/or US
regulators. In contrast, most of the 86 antibiotic SDFs on
the Indian market were approved by the CDSCO and by UK
and US regulators. Almost half of the FDC formulations
included dual antimicrobials, some combining two highest
priority critically important antibiotics. India’s National List
of Essential Medicines was found to include only two of the
antibiotic FDCs and 22 of the SDFs marketed.

 In the analysis of sales volumes, FDC sales increased by
38% over the 5-year period 2007–2012, compared with 20%
for antibiotic SDFs. By 2011–12, antibiotic FDCs accounted
for over one-third of total antibiotic sales. This is strikingly
high. By comparison, in the UK, 5% of community-dispensed
systemic antibiotics in 2012 were FDCs, and 95% were SDFs
[34]. Although subject to no regulatory scrutiny, unapproved
FDC formulations comprised more than one-third of the FDC
sales annually in India.
SDFs accounted for two-thirds of total antibiotic sales vol-
umes, almost all of which were CDSCO-approved formula-
tions. Of these, two-thirds of sales were for NELM-listed
antibiotics and over half were for highest priority critically
important antibiotics [7]. There were found to be thousands
of brand-named FDC and SDF products on the market,
manufactured by several hundreds of Indian companies and
fewer than 20 MNCs.
MNC manufacture in India of FDCs
unapproved in the UK and US
MNCs manufactured almost 20% of the systemic antibiotic
FDC and SDF volumes sold in India annually. Twenty MNC-
manufactured FDC formulations had no record of CDSCO
approval. Only four of the 53 FDC formulations made in
India by MNCs had UK or US regulatory approval. The
leading manufacturer was Abbott, whose role in the manufac-
ture of unapproved dual-antimicrobial FDC formulations has
been criticized [35–37]. In contrast to FDCs, most MNC-
manufactured SDF formulations were CDSCO approved and
over 70% had UK/US regulatory approval. Pharmaceutical
companies, including some manufacturers of unapproved
FDCs, made a declaration in 2016 on their commitment to
combating AMR [38].
Pharmacological problems of FDCs
Many dual antimicrobial formulations had been poorly con-
sidered pharmacologically. Combinations of broad-spectrum
antibiotics with antiprotozoal drugs were among the most
highly prescribed FDCs – e.g. ofloxacin plus ornidazole and
norfloxacin plus metronidazole. Used to treat diarrhoea, their
intention is to cover possible bacterial and amoebic causes
but as antimicrobials are not first-line diarrhoea treatment,
the combinations are inappropriate and may exacerbate
diarrhoea owing to their effects on normal gut flora.
FDC component drugs were found to be commonly
pharmacologically incompatible, having different half-life
durations requiring different dosing frequencies that cannot
be
accommodated
in
FDC
formulations.
For
example,
ofloxacin, dosed once daily, was combined with ornidazole
or tinidazole, both needing twice-daily dosing or, with metro-
nidazole, needing 8-hourly dosing. Similarly, azithromycin
(once daily) was combined with cefpodoxime (twice daily).
Some
of
the
combinations
have
potentially
serious
interactions. In the case of azithromycin plus ofloxacin or
levofloxacin, all of these, antibiotics are associated with pro-
longation of the cardiac QT-interval, and the combinations
are
potentially
harmful
for
vulnerable
individuals.
Gatifloxacin was withdrawn by regulators, including the
FDA, in 2006 owing to associations with glycaemic disorders,
but the present study found it to be available in India, in
combination with both ornidazole and metronidazole.
Drug regulatory weaknesses
Our study exposed the consequences of acknowledged
weaknesses in India’s drug regulatory system. Although the
government has convened reviews of regulation, actions to
improve matters have been ineffective [10–13, 39, 40]. In
February 2016, the Kokate Committee, constituted ‘for
examining the safety and efficacy of unapproved FDCs which
were licensed by State Drug Licensing Authorities without
due approval of [the Drugs Controller General (India)]
DCG(I)’ published its report to government [13]. Over 6000
brand-named
products
were
examined,
(including
163
systemic antibiotic FDC products) and categorized by the
committee as ‘irrational’, ‘requiring further deliberation’,
‘rational’ or ‘requiring further generation of data’ [40]. In
March 2016, the government banned 344 FDC formulations
from sale because none had ‘therapeutic justification’ and
each was ‘likely to involve risk to human beings, whereas
safer alternatives
to the said
drug are available’ [41].
Following appeals, the ban was overturned by the Delhi High
Court in November 2016 [42]. The matter continues, with the
Supreme Court recently upholding the government’s right to
ban drugs in the public interest [43]. Included in the ban were
16 unapproved systemic antibiotic FDC formulations listed
in PharmaTrac. Of these, 11 were dual antimicrobials and
six were manufactured by MNCs. In 2011–12, these 16
formulations accounted for 14% of antibiotic FDC sales. The
government
did
not
explain
the
selection
criteria
for
banning. Many alternative approved formulations similar to
those classed by the Kokate Committee as ‘irrational’ are
available, so even if the ban had been enforced, the impact
on the sales of antibiotic FDCs would have been negligible.
In a further delay to improving regulation, the govern-
ment announced in June 2016 that it was withdrawing the
Drugs and Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill, 2013, introduced
in the Rajya Sabha on 29 August 2013, and instead would
‘comprehensively review the existing law with two-fold
objectives viz. to facilitate the ease of doing business and
substantially enhancing the quality and efficacy of our
products’ [44].
Actions needed
The sale of unapproved, unscrutinized FDC antibiotics
undermines measures to control AMR. Definitive regulatory
action to ensure that antibiotic formulations sold in India
are rigorously evaluated and approved by the drugs regulator
would permit India to participate effectively in AMR control
measures. A starting point would be a government ban on
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
unapproved
antibiotic
formulations, commencing with dual antimicrobial FDCs
(Table S1). The marketing of centrally unapproved formula-
tions of new drugs is illegal [15]. This approach would not de-
prive
patients
of
clinically
needed
antibiotics
because
approved SDFs are available. In all cases, the evidence base
supporting CDSCO systemic antibiotic approvals, both FDC
and SDF, should be made publicly available. In relation to
MNC-manufactured antibiotic FDCs, the MNCs should be re-
quired to justify the sale of products in India that do not have

 the approval of their own national regulators – and, in multi-
ple cases, not even the approval of the Indian regulator. En-
actment of policies to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial
use is poor in India [45]. Work is needed to understand
why prescribers are choosing antimicrobial FDCs, not ad-
hering to the NLEM and frequently prescribing unap-
proved
formulations.
If
these
actions
were
to
be
implemented, India could participate effectively in the so-
lutions proposed for national [46] and global [1, 23, 47,
48] action on resistance.
Limitations
We used publicly available CDSCO information to determine
antibiotic approvals. We assumed that records were accurate,
and cross-checked sources extensively, but it is possible that
we overlooked information. Pharmatrac® drug sales data are
estimates determined using standard sampling methods and
sales volume, formulation, brand-name and manufacturer in-
formation cannot be double-checked. In common with simi-
lar datasets, they do not distinguish prescription from
nonprescription sales, but with high levels of nonprescrip-
tion antibiotic use in India, sales data provide the most accu-
rate estimate of national antibiotic use. When we categorized
the Pharmatrac® sales volumes by antibiotic class, the rank-
ings matched those reported using another commercial data
source [8, 49].
Conclusions
The present systematic examination of Indian sales data and
regulatory information confirmed government claims about
antimicrobial use. FDCs comprise increasing proportions of
antibiotic sales, but most of the formulations sold are unap-
proved by the CDSCO and only a handful are approved by
regulators in the UK and US. Their manufacture by MNCs
contradicts stated commitments on combating AMR. The
use of unapproved, unscrutinized antibiotic FDC formula-
tions is likely to contribute to India’s rising AMR. Until de-
finitive action is taken to ban most systemic antibiotic
FDCs from manufacture and sale, AMR initiatives in India
are likely to be undermined and the global action plan
impeded.
