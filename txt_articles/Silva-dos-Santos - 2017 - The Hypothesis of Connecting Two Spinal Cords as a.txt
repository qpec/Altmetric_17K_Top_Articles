Direct communication between different nervous systems has been recently reported
through Brain-to-Brain-Interfaces and brainet. Closed loops systems between the brain
and the spinal cord from the same individual have also been demonstrated. However,
the connection between different nervous systems through the spinal cord has not yet
been considered. This paper raises the hypothesis that connecting two spinal cords
(spinal cord – spinal cord connection) is an indirect mean for communication of two
brains and a direct way of communication between two nervous systems. A concept
of electrical fingerprint of a drug is introduced. The notion of connection between two
parts of the same spinal cord to treat a paraplegic patient is also introduced. Possible
applications of this technique are discussed in the context of psychology, psychiatry
and mental health. Also, it is discussed that external information injected to a spinal
cord as well as spinal cord – spinal cord connection can become new tools to (1) study
the physiology of the nervous system, (2) model specific behaviors, (3) study and model
disease traits (4) treat neuropsychiatric disorders and (5) share information between two
nervous systems.

INTRODUCTION
In February 2013, the notion of Brain-to-Brain-Interface was introduced in a pioneering
work reporting that a brain-machine interface can be applied to share real-time sensorimotor
information between the brains of two rodents performing a cognitive task (Pais-Vieira et al.,
2013). Soon after, other works reported similar findings such as the sharing of hippocampus
representations between two rodents (Deadwyler et al., 2013), the transmission of visual
information between a human and a rodent (Yoo et al., 2013) and the transmission of motor
information between two humans (Grau et al., 2014; Rao et al., 2014; Stocco et al., 2015).
In 2015, it was demonstrated that it is possible to connect the brain of more than two animals
creating what was coined brainet (Pais-Vieira et al., 2015; Ramakrishnan et al., 2015). It has been
demonstrated that it is feasible to form a closed loop for artificial communication between a
brain of a primate and its spinal cord (Zimmermann and Jackson, 2014; Capogrosso et al., 2016).
However, the communication between the nervous system of two different animals through a

Connecting Nervous Systems via Spinal Cords
connection of the spinal cords has not been considered. The
hypothesis presented in this paper was inspired, in part, by the
published work and protocol regarding spinal cord stimulation
to treat epilepsy induced with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; Pais-
Vieira et al., 2016), the papers and protocols of brain-to-brain
interface (Pais-Vieira et al., 2013), brainet (Pais-Vieira et al., 2015;
Ramakrishnan et al., 2015) and also by the application of spinal
cord stimulation to treat rodents models of Parkinson’
s Disease
(Fuentes et al., 2009).
THE HYPOTHESIS
This paper proposes the hypothesis that it might be possible to
share information between the nervous system of two rodents
through the connection of the spinal cords.
THE EVALUATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS
To test the hypothesis, adults Long Evan rats weighing between
250–
350 g will be used. Each rat will be implanted with both
brain electrodes and spinal cord electrodes. The brain electrodes
will be implanted in the right M1 and left S1 areas according
to the procedure described in previous works (Pais-Vieira et al.,
2016). These electrode aims to record the Local Field Potential
(LFP; Lin and Gervasoni, 2011) as well as single unit activity
(Wiest et al., 2008). The spinal cord electrode will be implanted
into the epidural space of the dorsal column of thoracic vertebrae
2 (T2) as described by Yadav et al. (2014). As each spinal cord
electrode has two leads, the connection cable will consist of two
wires that will be plugged to each lead. This cable will have a
switch to establish or interrupt the connection between the two
spinal cords. The signal to be transmitted or shared between
the two rats will be seizure activity provoked by the injection
of Pentylenetetrazole. The procedure to induces seizure with
PTZ is described elsewhere (Pais-Vieira et al., 2016). Besides the
electrical recording of LFP and single units, the seizure activity
and the behavior of the animals will also be monitored using a
video recording system. The protocol for the connection of the
two spinal cords is summarized in Figures 1A–C. After injecting
the sender rat with intraperitoneal PTZ, the simultaneous LFP
and video recording session of the two rats will begin. However,
during the first 5 min, no connection between the two spinal
cords will be made to allow a baseline recording where the
sender rat will have seizure episodes and the receiver rat will
not experience seizures. Following this period, the switch of the
connection cable will be turned on to establish the connection
between the two spinal cords. It will be created an induction
period of about 23 min to allow a free communication between
the two nervous system. After this time, the connection will be
switched off for 5 min. After that, it will follow an ON/OFF

periods of 5 min each meaning that the connection will be
established during 5 min and then interrupted during 5 min.
The total duration of this experiment will be 60 min counting
from the beginning of the baseline recording. During the whole
experiment, the seizure activity will be recorded in video, single
units and LFP.
DISCUSSION
The Receiver Rat Will Have Seizures after
the Connection of the Two Spinal Cords
After the first connection of the two spinal cords, it is
expected that the receiver rat will develop seizures after few
seconds/minutes. This seizure would be caused by the electrical
information that codifies the seizures induced by the chemical
substance PTZ. This can show that the spinal cord can be a way
to send codified electrical information from an external source
to the cortical region of a receiver. It may also indicate that the
artificial bridge between two spinal cord will be possible even with
a direct connection without amplifiers.
Once Induced, the Receiver Rat Will
Experience Seizures Episodes even
during the Disconnected Periods
One can speculate that this would be possible due to the property
that neuronal network has to memorize and reproduces repeated
electrical activity and also due to neuroplasticity. The fact that the
information is coming from an external source would not be an
exception to this neurophysiological phenomenon (the source of
neuronal code can be of any kind, either from another animal –
such as in this case – or from a computer for example). This
can be a mechanism with physiological applications such as (1)
modeling and studying of stimulus codifying neurophysiological
mechanisms or behavior that can be injected into the nervous
system through the spinal cord; (2) modeling of disorders: an
information that codifies a particular trait of disease can be
injected into the nervous system via the spinal cord.
The Flow of Neural Information in One
Direction from a Nervous System to
Another or Sharing of Information
between Two Nervous Systems?
This paper presents the notion that the receiver rat will
experience seizures coming from the sender rat. However, it
should be considered that the behavior of the sender might
be affected by the neural signal coming from the receiver (in
other words if the sender rat will experience fewer seizures after
the connection to the receiver – possibly because of diffusion
of energy or extension of nervous system tissue). However,
further research can be conducted to study this phenomenon. For
example (1) a rat with depressive behavior connected to a rat with
manic behavior or (2) a rat with insomnia connected to a rat with
excessive sleep.
Introducing the Notion of a Complex
Biological Neural Code as a Way of
Neuromodulation
An artificial spinal cord stimulation to treat chronic pain can be
considered a simple stimulation paradigm. However, the neural
code caused by seizures induced by PTZ coming from a sender
rat can be regarded as a complex biological stimulation paradigm
due to its nature and also due to a much bigger number of
variables. Hence, further research can be done to study the effects
FIGURE 2 | The notion of an electrical medication. The brain recorded LFP of seizures caused by the PTZ drug can also be caused by PTZ electrical activity
delivered/injected in the spinal cord. The code or electrical activity of PTZ is what the author calls electrical drug. PTZ: pentylenetetrazol.

of complex biological stimulation paradigms as possible new
ways of neuromodulation.
OTHER POSSIBLE FUTURISTIC
APPLICATIONS OF SPINAL CORD –
SPINAL CORD CONNECTION
Of the several futuristic speculations, the author would like to
highlight the notion of an electrical drug (Figure 2). For example,
when PTZ is intraperitoneally injected on an animal, there will be
seizure activity recorded on the brain LFP. If this neural activity
(neuronal code) is injected (or delivered) in the spinal cord of
a second animal, it is hypothesized that the second animal will
have brain LFP that is equal to the LFP caused by the drug that is
injected intraperitoneally.
Another notion is that one can connect two parts of the
same spinal cord in a paraplegic or tetraplegic patient to send
information from the spinal cord portion below the lesion to
the spinal cord segment that is above the segment (Figure 3).
Moreover, this connection can be combined with other treatment
approaches for paraplegic patients such as stem cells graft, walk
again projects or spinal cord stimulation.
Regarding the applications of the notion of spinal cord –
spinal cord connection to the fields of psychology, psychiatry
and mental health, I speculate that, for example, a complex
biological activity codifying relaxation can be recorded on
an electronic device and then sent to the spinal cord of an
individual with anxiety. On Table 1 there is a list of the same
rationale applied to modulate, study or treat different conditions
such as anxiety, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
anorexia, obesity, and emotional instability due to personality
disorder (just to name a few). Due to ethical issues, I do

CONCLUSION
Spinal cord – spinal cord connection can be a new way of
sharing information between two nervous systems. Complex
codified electrical stimulation (such as the PTZ causing
seizures) can be memorized and reproduced by the brain of
a receiver. This principle may allow new methods to study
neurophysiological process in the brain as well as new tools to

model neuropsychiatric disorders. The connection of two spinal
cords causes a shunt of information from an affected animal to
a healthy one. This property can also be used therapeutically.
The protocol proposed here can create a connection between
two spinal cords that does not use amplifiers. A concept of
electrical drug or electrical fingerprint of a drug is introduced.
The notion of the connection between two parts of the same
spinal cord to treat paraplegic or tetraplegic patients is also
introduced. Possible applications of this technique to the fields
of psychology, psychiatry and mental health. It can be said that
information injected into the nervous system through the spinal
cord as well as spinal cord –spinal cord connection can allow
news ways of (1) studying neurophysiology, (2) modeling specific
behaviors, (3) studying and modeling disease traits, (4) treating
neuropsychiatric disorders and (5) information sharing between
two nervous systems.
