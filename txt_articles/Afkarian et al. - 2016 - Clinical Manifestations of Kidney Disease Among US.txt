IMPORTANCE Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of chronic and end-stage kidney
disease in the United States and worldwide. Changes in demographics and treatments may
affect the prevalence and clinical manifestations of diabetic kidney disease.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the clinical manifestations of kidney disease among US adults
with diabetes over time.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Serial cross-sectional studies of adults aged 20 years or
older with diabetes mellitus participating in National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys from 1988 through 2014.
EXPOSURES Diabetes was defined as hemoglobin A1c greater than 6.5% or use of
glucose-lowering medications.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio �30 mg/g),
macroalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio �300 mg/g), reduced estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and severely reduced eGFR (<30
mL/min/1.73 m2), incorporating data on biological variability to estimate the prevalence of
persistent abnormalities.
RESULTS There were 6251 adults with diabetes included (1431 from 1988-1994, 1443 from
1999-2004, 1280 from 2005-2008, and 2097 from 2009-2014). The prevalence of any
diabetic kidney disease, defined as persistent albuminuria, persistent reduced eGFR, or both,
did not significantly change over time from 28.4% (95% CI, 23.8%-32.9%) in 1988-1994 to
26.2% (95% CI, 22.6%-29.9%) in 2009-2014 (prevalence ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86-1.06]
adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity; P = .39 for trend). However, the prevalence of
albuminuria decreased progressively over time from 20.8% (95% CI, 16.3%-25.3%) in
1988-1994 to 15.9% (95% CI, 12.7%-19.0%) in 2009-2014 (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.76
[95% CI, 0.65-0.89]; P < .001 for trend). In contrast, the prevalence of reduced eGFR
increased from 9.2% (95% CI, 6.2%-12.2%) in 1988-1994 to 14.1% (95% CI, 11.3%-17.0%) in
2009-2014 (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.33-1.95] comparing 2009-2014 with
1988-1994; P < .001 for trend), with a similar pattern for severely reduced eGFR (adjusted
prevalence ratio, 2.86 [95% CI, 1.38-5.91]; P = .004 for trend). Significant heterogeneity in
the temporal trend for albuminuria was noted by age (P = .049 for interaction) and
race/ethnicity (P = .007 for interaction), with a decreasing prevalence of albuminuria
observed only among adults younger than 65 years and non-Hispanic whites, whereas the
prevalence of reduced GFR increased without significant differences by age or race/ethnicity.
In 2009-2014, approximately 8.2 million adults with diabetes (95% CI, 6.5-9.9 million adults)
had albuminuria, reduced eGFR, or both.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among US adults with diabetes from 1988 to 2014,
the overall prevalence of diabetic kidney disease did not change significantly, whereas the
prevalence of albuminuria declined and the prevalence of reduced eGFR increased.

D
iabetes mellitus is the most common cause of chronic
kidney disease in the world, leading to multiple com-
plications including end-stage renal disease, cardio-
vascular disease, infection, and death.1 Chronic kidney dis-
ease in the setting of diabetes or diabetic kidney disease (DKD),
manifests clinically as albuminuria, reduced glomerular fil-
tration rate (GFR), or both. Over the last 20 years, the preva-
lence of diabetes and DKD have increased.2
The natural history of DKD traditionally has been de-
scribed as progressive albuminuria followed by a steady loss of
GFR.3However,thisnaturalhistorymayhavechangedoverthe
last 2 decades. In particular, GFR loss has been observed prior
to the development of albuminuria,4-6 a reduced GFR without
albuminuria has been frequently described,6-9 and albumin-
uriahasbeenobservedtobetransientorreversible.10-14Changes
in diabetes management over time include increased use of in-
tensiveglycemiccontrol,improvedbloodpressurecontrol,and
increased use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
inhibitors.2 In this context, the prevalence of reduced GFR was
previously reported to have increased among adults with dia-
betes in the United States from 1988 to 2008, whereas signifi-
cant changes in albuminuria were not observed.2
In this study, temporal trends in albuminuria and re-
ducedGFRwereevaluatedthrough2014.Comparedwithprior
analyses, more advanced DKD manifestations were evalu-
ated, subgroups defined by age, race, and ethnicity were ex-
amined, and new data on persistence of abnormalities were
incorporated.TheoverallgoalwastoidentifyprioritiesforDKD

Methods
Study Population
The population-based National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tionSurvey(NHANES)isaprogramofstudiesconductedbythe
NationalCenterforHealthStatisticsdesignedtoassessthepreva-
lence of disease, disease risk factors, and nutritional status of
adultsandchildrenintheUnitedStates.Itusesaprobabilitysam-
plingdesigntoselectparticipantsrepresentativeofthecivilian,
noninstitutionalizedUSpopulation.15 NHANESIIItookplacein
1988-1994.Startingin1999,NHANESbecameacontinuouspro-
gram,withdatacompiledin2-yearblocks.Healthexaminations
includingphysicalmeasurementsandbloodandurinecollections
are conducted at a mobile examination center. Each NHANES
cycle oversamples persons of black race, Hispanic ethnicity, or
both. The current study includes participants in NHANES III,
NHANES1999-2004,NHANES2005-2008,andNHANES2009-
2014 who were aged 20 years or older, underwent a health ex-
amination in the NHANES mobile examination center, and had
available data for medication use, hemoglobin A1c, serum cre-
atinineconcentration,andurinealbuminandcreatinineconcen-
trations. All NHANES protocols were approved by the research
ethics review board of the National Center for Health Statistics,
and all participants signed written informed consent forms.
Participants with diabetes mellitus, defined as use of
glucose-lowering medications (insulin or oral hypoglycemic
medications), hemoglobin A1c of 6.5% or greater, or both, were
included in the present analyses.16,17 Hemoglobin A1c was mea-
sured in all NHANES cycles using high-pressure liquid chro-
matography (coefficients of variation <3.0%).15 Self-reported
history of diabetes was not used to define it because tempo-
ral changes in diabetes screening and diagnosis could lead to
diabetes populations with differing disease severity over time
andbiasedestimatesofDKDprevalence.Fastingglucoseorglu-
coseconcentrationsfollowinganoralglucosetolerancetestalso
were not used to define diabetes because these criteria would
reduce the numbers of participants available for the analyses
and the power of the study.
Diabetic Kidney Disease
During NHANES mobile examination center screenings, urine
albumin concentration was measured in a random, single-
voided urine sample using a solid-phase fluorescent immuno-
assay and creatinine concentration was measured using a Jaffe
rate reaction. Albuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-
to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30 mg/g or greater, and macroalbu-
minuria was defined as a urine ACR of 300 mg/g or greater.4,16
Serumcreatinineconcentrationsweremeasuredbyakineticrate
Jaffe method, and values from NHANES III and NHANES 1999-
2000 were calibrated as previously described to account for
laboratorydriftinserumcreatinineacrossNHANEScycles.15,18-20
Glomerular filtration rate was estimated from calibrated se-
rum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiol-
ogy Collaboration equation.21 Reduced estimated GFR (eGFR)
was defined as less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and severely re-
duced eGFR as less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.4 Any DKD was de-
fined as albuminuria, reduced eGFR, or both.
To account for the biological variability inherent in urine
ACR and serum creatinine measurements, the persistence of
albuminuria and reduced eGFR was calculated among sub-
sets of participants with repeat measurements of urine ACR
or eGFR. Persistence was evaluated as the proportions of par-
ticipants with abnormal values whose values were also abnor-
mal on repeat testing (described in eMethods in the Supple-
ment). Estimates of persistence were incorporated into the
prevalenceestimatesasdescribedbelowinthestatisticalmeth-
ods section.
Key Points
Question Have the clinical manifestations of kidney disease
among adults with diabetes changed over time?
Findings In serial cross-sectional studies of US adults with
diabetes mellitus participating in National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys, no change in the prevalence of diabetic
kidney disease was observed from 1988 through 2014, but there
was a significant decrease in the prevalence of albuminuria and
a significant increase in the prevalence of reduced glomerular
filtration rate.
Meaning The clinical manifestations of diabetic kidney disease
changed from 1988 to 2014, with a lower prevalence of
albuminuria and a higher prevalence of reduced glomerular
filtration rate in 2014 compared with 1988.

Other Clinical Characteristics
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and duration of diabetes were as-
sessed by questionnaire.15 Race/ethnicity was categorized as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other Hispanic, and other or unknown race (including multira-
cial). Participants of all races and ethnicities were included in
the analyses, and estimates were reported for non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American race/
ethnicity only. Type 1 diabetes was defined for descriptive pur-
poses only using the following criteria: (1) diagnosis prior to 30
years of age; (2) first use of insulin within 2 years of diabetes di-
agnosis; and (3) current insulin use. Medications taken during
a 1-month period preceding the NHANES physical examina-
tion were assessed by in-person interview.15 Medication data

Statistical Methods
Analyses were performed using Stata version 11.1 (StataCorp)

and incorporated recommended NHANES weights to ac-

NHANES cohort, Stata svy commands were used to estimate
the prevalence of DKD and other clinical characteristics among
US adults with diabetes.
Binomial regression was used to test trends in DKD preva-
lence over time. NHANES III, NHANES 1999-2004, NHANES
2005-2008, and NHANES 2009-2014 were modeled primar-
ily as nonordered independent variables. Tests for trend were
performed using a continuous variable defined by the mid-
point of each study period (in years). For each outcome, par-
ticipantswhohadtheoutcomewereconsideredtohaveavalue
equal to the outcome’
s estimate of persistence, which al-
lowed for estimation of DKD prevalence ratios accounting for
possible misclassification of albuminuria, eGFR, or both. To
account for the uncertainty in the estimate of the probability
of persistence, a multiple imputation approach was used to ob-
tain 95% CIs for adjusted prevalence ratios. The final vari-
ance of the prevalence ratios were estimated by using the rules
of Rubin23 to combine between- and within-imputation vari-
ance estimates. Models were adjusted for age (in categories of
20-39 years, 40-59 years, and ≥60 years), sex, and race/
ethnicity. An age or race/ethnicity × time interaction term al-
lowed extraction of subgroup-specific effect estimates. Sig-
nificancetestingforallmodelswas2-sidedandthesignificance
threshold was set at P < .05.

Over time, mean age and sex distribution of the diabetes popu-
lations were similar. However, the fraction of adults with dia-
betes who self-identified as Mexican American was higher and
self-reported non-Hispanic white ethnicity was lower during
later survey years. The mean duration of diagnosed diabetes
increased in the later compared with earlier NHANES cycles.
The mean body mass index also increased from 30.6 in 1988-
1994 to 33.6 in 2009-2014.
Among 731 NHANES participants with diabetes who con-
tributed2urinesamples,ACRofgreaterthan30mg/gwasper-
sistent in 58.9% of the repeat samples and an ACR of greater
than 300 mg/g was persistent in 72.3% of the repeat samples
(eFigure 1 and eTable 1 in the Supplement). Among 2076
NHANES participants with 2 serum samples, an eGFR of
less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was persistent in 70.4% of the re-
peat samples and an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2
was persistent in 100% of the repeat samples (eFigure 2 and
eTable 2).
The proportions of adults taking glucose-lowering medi-
cations, RAAS inhibitors, and statins were higher over time.
Consistent with these changes, mean systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were lower
in later compared with earlier years. These patterns were con-
sistent across categories of age (eFigure 3 in the Supplement)
and race/ethnicity (Figure). However, older adults were more
likely than younger adults to be treated with glucose-
lowering medications, RAAS inhibitors, and statins and
achieved lower levels of hemoglobin A1c and low-density li-
poprotein cholesterol (but not blood pressure) during all pe-
riods. In addition, during all periods, blacks and Mexican
Americans were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to take
glucose-loweringmedications,RAASinhibitors,andstatinsand
did not achieve mean hemoglobin A1c values as low as non-
Hispanic whites.
Clinical Manifestations of DKD
Among US adults with diabetes, the overall prevalence of DKD
did not change significantly from 1988 to 2014 (28.4% in 1988-
1994 and 26.2% in 2009-2014; Table 2). However, the preva-
lence of albuminuria decreased from 20.8% to 15.9%, whereas
the prevalence of reduced eGFR increased from 9.2% to 14.1%
and the prevalence of severely reduced eGFR increased from
1.0% to 2.7%. Further adjustment for eGFR did not substan-
tially alter results for temporal trends in the prevalence of al-
buminuria (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Significant hetero-
geneity in the temporal trend for albuminuria was noted by
age (P = .049 for interaction) and race/ethnicity (P = .007 for
interaction),withadeclineinprevalenceobservedonlyamong
adults younger than 65 years and non-Hispanic whites (Table 3
and Table 4). In contrast, no significant heterogeneity in the
temporal trend for reduced eGFR was observed.

Clinical Characteristics of Adults With Various
Manifestations of DKD
InNHANES2005-2008,usingestimatesthatdonottakeintoac-
count persistence of albuminuria or reduced eGFR, 39.3% of
adultswithdiabeteshadDKDmanifestedasalbuminuria(21.6%),
reduced eGFR (8.9%), or both (8.8%) (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment).ComparedwithparticipantswithoutreducedeGFR,those
with reduced eGFR were older, had a longer duration of diabe-
tes, were more likely to be women and white, and were more
likely to take RAAS inhibitors and lipid-lowering medications,
havelowerhemoglobinA1c,havediabeticretinopathy,andreport
a history of clinically diagnosed macrovascular disease regard-
less of whether albuminuria was also present.
Discussion
Among representative samples of adults with diabetes melli-
tusintheUnitedStates,therewasachangeintheclinicalmani-
festations of kidney disease over the last 26 years, with a de-
cline in the prevalence of albuminuria and an increase in the
prevalence of reduced eGFR. These changes were indepen-
dent of characteristics of adults with diabetes. Changes in the
more severe manifestations of macroalbuminuria and eGFR
of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were consistent with those of
albuminuria and eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2,
respectively.
Significant heterogeneity in the temporal trend for albu-
minuria prevalence was noted by age and race/ethnicity. The
lower prevalence of albuminuria over time was observed
only among adults younger than 65 years and non-Hispanic
whites, whereas the prevalence of reduced eGFR appeared to
increase without significant differences by age or race/
ethnicity. The proportion of US adults with diabetes who met
any criteria for DKD was stable over time, with an estimate of
26.2% (95% CI, 22.6%-29.9%) in 2009-2014. Using 2010 cen-
sus data, this translates to a prevalence of approximately
8.2 million people (95% CI, 6.5-9.9 million people) with any
DKD, including 4.6 million people (95% CI, 3.4-5.8 million
people) with albuminuria, 1.9 million people (95% CI,
1.0-2.8 million people) with macroalbuminuria, 4.5 million
people (95% CI, 3.3-5.7 million people) with reduced eGFR,
and 0.9 million people (95% CI, 0.6-1.3 million) with severely
reduced eGFR.
We previously reported an increase in the prevalence of
reduced eGFR but no significant change in the prevalence of
albuminuria among US adults with diabetes from 1988 to
2008.2Inthisstudy,theanalysesofdatacollectedthrough2014
demonstrated a significant temporal decrease in the preva-
lence of albuminuria in addition to a continuation of the in-
crease in prevalence of reduced GFR. Furthermore, we evalu-

evant subgroups, observing significant age and race/
ethnicity × time interactions and identifying older adults and

for albuminuria. Repeat testing was used to more accurately

define DKD based on the persistence of albuminuria and re-
duced eGFR. Albuminuria and eGFR have substantial biologi-
cal (intraindividual) variation, and current guidelines recom-
mend that only persistent abnormalities be considered
diagnostic of DKD.1
The lower prevalence of albuminuria observed over time
maybeattributabletoahigherrateofprescribeddiabetesthera-
pies (glucose-lowering medications, RAAS inhibitors, and stat-
ins).Loweringbloodglucoselevelhasconsistentlyreducedthe
development of albuminuria in clinical trials,24-26 and an in-
crease in the use of glucose-lowering medications and lower
mean hemoglobin A1c values were observed over time in this
study. Furthermore, RAAS inhibitors and blood pressure con-
trol reduce albuminuria through hemodynamic and other
mechanisms,27,28 and the increasing use of these agents and
lower mean blood pressure levels were also noted over time.
The lack of decline in albuminuria prevalence among blacks
and Mexican Americans may be attributable in part to less fre-
quent use of proven diabetes therapies, as observed herein and
in other reports.29
Reasons for the increasing prevalence of reduced eGFR
cannot be conclusively discerned from these data. Estimated
GFR declines with age, but aging is not likely to be respon-
sible for the observed trends in eGFR because the age distri-
bution of the US adult population with diabetes did not change
significantly over time and trends persisted after adjustment
for demographic factors. It is possible that hemodynamic ef-
fects of RAAS inhibitors and improved blood pressure control
could contribute to lower eGFR. Alternatively, an increasing
duration of diabetes may be contributing to kidney damage.
There was a monotonic increase in diabetes duration from
1988 to 2014. During the same interval, there was no change in
mean age, suggesting that the mean age of diabetes onset may
havedecreased.Earlierageatdiabetesonsetcombinedwithde-

creased mortality due to cardiovascular disease and other dia-
betes complications30 could allow adults with diabetes time to
develop progressive long-term kidney damage. In NHANES
2005-2008,reducedeGFRwasassociatedwithretinopathyand
macrovascular disease, regardless of whether albuminuria was
present, suggesting that reduced eGFR is occurring in the set-
ting of other long-term diabetes complications.
To reduce the prevalence of reduced GFR in diabetes, new
therapies may be needed. The shift in clinical manifestations
ofDKDhasimplicationsforclinicaltrials.Clinicaltrialsofnovel
DKD therapies commonly target patients with macroalbumin-
uria because they are at high risk of GFR loss,14 particularly
when GFR is already low. However, adults with macroalbu-
minuria form a small and diminishing subset of those with dia-
betes, estimated at 5.0% in the 2009-2014 NHANES survey,
and even fewer have concomitant reduced eGFR. To mitigate
the large public health effect of the growing DKD population
in the United States and around the world,1,31 clinical trials will
need to address a broader range of DKD presentations.
This study has limitations. First, it is possible that incom-
plete standardization of serum creatinine, urine albumin, and
creatinine measurements over time may have contributed to
the temporal drift, as previously described.2 Second, the es-
timates of persistence were based on a subsample of each
NHANES cohort, potentially reducing precision; however, re-
liance on these subsamples was unlikely to have biased the
analyses of temporal trends. Third, data were not available to
determine the underlying causes of DKD, and some of the
identified kidney disease was likely caused by processes other
than diabetes. Fourth, the proportion of adults with type 1 dia-
betes was small and therefore results are primarily relevant to
adults with type 2 diabetes. Strengths of this study include use
of nationally representative data, incorporation of persis-
tence into the estimation of prevalence based on relevant re-
peat albuminuria and serum creatinine measurements,
and ascertainment of both moderate and severe DKD.
Conclusions
Among US adults with diabetes from 1988 to 2014, the over-
all prevalence of DKD did not change significantly, whereas the
prevalence of albuminuria declined and the prevalence of re-
duced eGFR increased.
