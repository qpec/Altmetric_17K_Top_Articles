In Brief
Lesioning the lateral septum (LS) causes
exaggerated aggression. Wong et al. find
that LS sends direct inhibition to the
ventromedial hypothalamus,
ventrolateral part, a region essential for
male mouse aggression. This input can
effectively suppress ongoing aggression
by shifting the activity balance between
attack-inhibited and attack-excited cells.

SUMMARY
Aggression is a prevalent behavior in the animal
kingdom that is used to settle competition for limited
resources. Given the high risk associated with
fighting, the central nervous system has evolved an
active mechanism to modulate its expression. Le-
sioning the lateral septum (LS) is known to cause
‘‘septal rage,’’ a phenotype characterized by a
dramatic increase in the frequency of attacks. To un-
derstand the circuit mechanism of LS-mediated
modulation of aggression, we examined the influ-
ence of LS input on the cells in and around the
ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus
(VMHvl)—a region required for male mouse aggres-
sion. We found that the inputs from the LS inhibited
the attack-excited cells but surprisingly increased
the overall activity of attack-inhibited cells. Further-
more, optogenetic activation of the projection from
LS cells to the VMHvl terminated ongoing attacks
immediately but had little effect on mounting. Thus,
LS projection to the ventromedial hypothalamic
area represents an effective pathway for suppressing
male aggression.
INTRODUCTION
Aggression is a fundamental means to defend territory, compete
for mates and food, and protect offspring. However, fighting is
physically demanding and can result in severe injury or death.
Thus, an active neural mechanism is in place to gate the expres-
sion of aggression. Evidence for the existence of such an aggres-
sion control system was first demonstrated by Cannon and Bard
through a knife-cut experiment in cats [1]. Transections between
the cortical area and hypothalamus caused excessive rage re-
sponses, such as hissing and paw striking. However, if the cut
was positioned posterior to the hypothalamus, no such behav-
iors were observed. These results indicated that the hypothala-
mus is necessary for the expression of aggression and that it is
under the tonic inhibition of anterior structures in the brain. Sub-
sequent studies suggested that the septal area might mediate
such control [2]. Immediate early gene mapping revealed a nega-
tive correlation between lateral septum (LS) activity and aggres-
sive behaviors such that hyper-aggressive animals show low
activity in the LS [3]. Human patients with septal forebrain tumors
experience an elevated level of irritability and aggressiveness [4].
In birds and rodents, permanent lesion or pharmacological
inactivation of the LS, especially the rostral part, dramatically in-
creases the number of attacks toward conspecifics [5–11].
Conversely, electrical stimulation of the LS suppresses natural
and artificially evoked aggression [12, 13]. Thus, the LS appears
to be an essential gatekeeper for expression of aggressive
behavior.
How does the LS modulate aggression? To answer this ques-
tion, we considered the connections of the LS. Tracing studies
have revealed that most LS projections end in the medial hypo-
thalamus [14]. These projections can strongly influence the activ-
ities of medial hypothalamic neurons, as shown by the high
percentage of orthodromic responsive cells in the medial
hypothalamus upon LS electric stimulation [15]. The medial hy-
pothalamus has long been recognized as a region essential for
mediating aggression [16–19]. Electric stimulation of the ‘‘hypo-
thalamic attack area,’’ which overlaps with multiple medial hypo-
thalamic nuclei, induces attack in both rats and cats [16, 19].
More recently, we and others pinpointed a subnucleus in the
medial hypothalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolat-
eral area (VMHvl), as a locus required for attack in male mice.
Silencing the VMHvl or killing progesterone receptor (PR)-ex-
pressing cells in the VMHvl abolished naturally occurring inter-
male attack, while optogenetic stimulation of the VMHvl elicited
immediate attack toward males, females, and inanimate objects
[20–22]. Chronic in vivo recording further demonstrated that
VMHvl cells are active during natural inter-male aggression,
and that they signal the imminence and features of future attacks
[23]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the LS
might modulate aggression by influencing the activities of
attack-related cells in the medial hypothalamus, especially those
in and around the VMHvl. To test this, here we optogenetically
activated the LS-VMH pathway; we found that this manipulation
suppressed attack effectively but had little effect on male-female
mounting. Furthermore, we performed optrode recording in so-
cially interacting animals and found that LS inputs decreased
the activity of attack-excited cells but surprisingly increased
the activity of attack-inhibited cells. Thus, the pathway from

 the LS to the VMHvl and its surrounding areas represents an
effective route for controlling aggressive behavior.
RESULTS
LS Suppression Increases Aggression toward Both
Males and Females
‘‘Septal rage’’ has been described in several rodent species
[5–8]. However, in male mice, this rage phenotype has only
been reported after LS electric lesion that damages both cell
bodies and fibers of passage [6]. Thus, we infused the
GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.2–0.3 ml of 0.33 mg/ml)
into the LS to determine whether the LS-lesion-induced rage
response can be recapitulated in male mice by inactivating
LS cells alone (Figures 1A and 1B). Males with relatively low
aggression level (total attack time < 5 s during the 10 min
resident-intruder assay) were used in the test to avoid be-
havioral saturation. 30 min after muscimol infusion, we per-
formed the resident-intruder assay for approximately 20 min,
first with male intruders (10 min) and then with female intruders
(10 min). Consistent with previous lesion studies [6], we
observed a significant increase in attack after LS inactivation
(Figures 1C and 1D). After the vehicle injection, only 1/9 animals
attacked the male intruder, whereas 8/9 animals initiated
attack after muscimol infusion (Figure 1C). More dramatically,
although male residents typically initiate sexual behavior to-
ward females, 5/9 mice attacked females repeatedly after
the LS inactivation, while mounting behavior was nearly abol-
ished (Figures 1D and 1E). This increased aggression was
not accompanied by a general increase in arousal, as locomo-
tion did not significantly change between attacks (Figure 1F).
Whereas the time spent investigating females did not change
significantly after the muscimol injection, the male investigation
time decreased, possibly due to increased time of attack (p =
0.05, paired t test; Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, muscimol inhibi-
tion of LS cells increases aggression in male mice toward both
male and female conspecifics.
Optogenetic Activation of the LS Suppresses Social
Behaviors
As a complementary approach to the loss-of-activity mani-
pulation, we next tested the effect of the LS activation on
aggressive behaviors (Figure 2A). To activate LS cells, we ste-
reotaxically injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing
channelrhodopsin-2
fused
with
yellow
fluorescent
protein
(ChR2-EYFP) into the LS in wild-type animals (N = 16) and im-
planted an optic fiber 0.5 mm above the LS (Figures 2B and
2D). During the surgery, a virus expressing LacZ or tdTomato
was co-injected to help locate the infected cell bodies histolog-
ically. We found that 90.2% ± 3.2% (mean ± SE) of LacZ- or
tdTomato-expressing cells were located inside of the LS (Fig-
ure 2C). Scattered infected cells (ranging from 0% to 34%)
were observed in regions outside of the LS, but mostly in the
median septum (MS) (Figures 2C and 2D). Figure S1 shows
the full range of infection from an example animal. After 3 weeks
of viral incubation, we delivered 473 nm blue light (20 ms,
20 Hz, 1–3 mW) through the optic fibers to activate the LS
cell bodies during male-male interaction. Given that light stim-
ulation is expected to reduce aggression, we started stimula-
tion immediately after an attack was initiated and continued

 the light delivery for 20 s. Sham stimulations (20 ms, 20 Hz,
0 mW for 20 s) were interleaved with real stimulations to
account for natural self-termination of attack (Figure 2E).
Acute activation of LS cells was highly efficient in terminating
attack. During light stimulation, animals stopped ongoing attack
with significantly shorter latency (sham: 3.5 ± 1.0 s, light: 0.7 ±
0.1 s, mean ± SE, p = 0.004) and were much less likely to reini-
tiate attack (sham: 82.9% ± 7.7%, light: 29.6% ± 8.9%, p =
0.0005; Figures 2E and 2G). As a result, the total amount of
time spent in attack was only 10% of that during sham stimula-
tion (sham: 42.1% ± 5.8%, light: 4.6% ± 1.4%, p = 4.8 3 10�6;
Figures 2E and 2G). The stimulated animals remained highly
interested in the male intruder, and in fact they spent more
time investigating the intruder during the real stimulation than
during the sham stimulation (sham: 4.4% ± 1.9%, light: 7.9% ±
0.9%, p = 0.02; Figure 2G). Although the animal continuously
moved around the cage, locomotion during the non-attack
period significantly decreased (p = 0.03; Figure 2G). In addition,
in nine animals that achieved intromission during interaction with
females, the LS stimulation mildly but significantly decreased
the latency to stop mounting (sham: 8.4 ± 1.0 s, light: 5.1 ±
0.8 s, p = 0.002) and reduced the total percentage of time spent
mounting (sham: 43.7% ± 5.1%, light: 27.1% ± 3.7%, p = 0.001),
although the probability of reinitiating mounting did not change
significantly (sham: 50.0% ± 18.9%, light: 59.2% ± 16.2%, p =
0.61; Figures 2F and 2H). Thus, LS activation strongly sup-
pressed aggression but also caused behavioral changes not
related to aggression. In control animals that expressed EGFP
instead of ChR2-EYFP in the LS, light activation of the LS did
not significantly change locomotion, attack, or social investiga-
tion (Figures S2A–S2C).

 suppression of aggression induced by LS activation was medi-
ated partly through interactions with cells in or around the
VMHvl. When we virally expressed ChR2 in the LS and posi-
tioned the optic fiber 0.5 mm above the VMHvl (Figure 3A;
N = 12), we found that light stimulation of the LS-VMHvl
pathway effectively suppressed ongoing attack. Upon light de-
livery, animals quickly aborted attack (stop attack latency:
sham: 3.4 ± 0.6 s, light: 1.4 ± 0.3 s, p = 0.002) and were less
likely to reinitiate the attack (attack re-initiation probability:
sham: 84.9% ± 8.6%, light: 41.4% ± 11.0%, p = 0.006; Figures
3D and 3F). Whereas the total attack time during stimulation
was approximately one-third of that during sham trials (sham:
42.1% ± 5.1%, light: 13.3% ± 3.9%, p = 0.0001; Figures 3D
and 3F). The total investigation time (p = 0.09) and movement
velocity during non-attack period was not significantly altered
(p = 0.51, Figure 3F). In nine animals that achieved intromission
during interaction with females, stimulation caused no change
in latency to stop mounting (p = 0.87), total percentage of
time spent in mounting (p = 0.13), or probability of mounting
re-initiation (p = 0.54; Figures 3E and 3G). Given the known
role of the LS in regulating anxiety [26], we tested the effect
of LS and LS-VMH activation on animals’ performance in an
elevated plus-maze test (EPM) (Figures S2D and S2E). We
interleaved the sham and real stimulation (20 s, 20 Hz, 20 ms,
1–3mW) and compared the percentage of time animal spent
in the open versus closed arm under each stimulation
condition. We found that LS stimulation, but not LS-VMH stim-
ulation, increased movement velocity in the EPM, but neither
manipulation changed the distribution of time in the open
versus closed arms (Figures S2F and S2G). These data suggest
that LS-stimulation-induced anxiogenic response [27] is likely
to be long-term rather than acute and does not account for
the fast suppressive effect of the LS/LS-VMH stimulation on
aggression.

 To determine the range of the light stimulation frequency that
can influence aggression, we systematically varied the optical
stimulation rate from 2.5 Hz to 20 Hz. We found that even at
2.5 Hz, stimulation of the LS-VMH terminals was sufficient to
consistently reduce aggression (Figure 3J; N = 6, p < 0.05, paired
t test). As the frequency increased, the suppression gradually
became stronger and reached a plateau at 10 Hz. Although the
firing properties of the LS cells during social behaviors are un-
known, in vivo recordings during discrimination tasks revealed
that LS spontaneous firing rate activity ranges from 2 to 5 Hz
and can increase to 10–20 Hz in response to a preferred stimulus
[28]. Thus, LS activation could modulate aggressive behavior at
frequencies within its normal activity range.
Unlike most brain regions, which contain mixed glutamatergic
and GABAergic cells, the LS contains largely GABAergic cells.
To test whether long-projecting GABAergic cells in the LS
mediate suppression of aggression, we expressed ChR2 in the
GABAergic cells using a well-characterized transgenic line that
expresses Cre recombinase in cells containing the vesicular
GABA transporter (VGAT) (Figures S3A–S3C) [29]. By crossing
Vgat-ires-Cre mice with a GFP reporter line, we found that
85.2% of cells in the LS were GFP positive (Figure S3D), consis-
tent with the endogenous proportion of GABAergic cells in this
area [30]. Upon optogenetic activation of the GABAergic projec-
tion from the LS to the VMHvl, animals (N = 6) quickly aborted
ongoing attacks (sham: 4.8 ± 2.4 s, light: 1.3 ± 0.3 s, p = 0.03,
paired t test) and reduced the total percentage of time spent
attacking (sham: 40.0% ± 11%, light: 12.4% ± 2.7%, p = 0.03;
Figure 3H). The percentage of trials to reinitiate attack did not
significantly decrease during light stimulation, possibly due to
the variable and lower attack re-initiation probability of Vgat-
ires-Cre mice (Figure 3H). Whereas the locomotion velocity
between attacks did not change (p = 0.51), the total time spent
on investigation increased during stimulation (p = 0.03; Fig-
ure 3H). Mounting behavior against female intruders was not
affected by the stimulation (stop mounting latency: p = 0.42, total
time of mounting: p = 0.90, mounting re-initiation probability:
p = 0.49, N = 5; Figure 3I).
One caveat of terminal stimulation is that it may activate cell
bodies through back propagation of action potentials [31]. If
axons bifurcate, the behavioral changes observed during termi-
nal activation might result from the recruitment of a second
region. To address this issue, we activated the LS-VMH pathway
while simultaneously inactivating LS cell bodies with a locally
injected mixture of lidocaine and tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Figures
4A–C). Before drug infusion, LS and LS-VMH stimulation effec-
tively suppressed attack (p < 0.05, t test between sham and light
trials for each animal), and LS stimulation caused significant
decrease in locomotion (p = 0.02, t test, N = 6; Figures 4D–4F,
LS: solid black bars; LS-VMH: open black bars). After LS drug
infusion, stimulation within the LS itself failed to reduce attack
or affect locomotion (Figure 4D–4F, solid red bars). In contrast,
activation of LS terminals in or around the VMHvl shortened
the latency to stop attack (p = 0.02) and reduced total attack
time (p = 0.01) (Figures 4D and 4E, open red bars). The locomo-
tion was not affected by the LS-VMH stimulation either before or
after drug blocking (Figure 4F, open black and red bars, p = 0.22
and 0.87). Thus, LS input to the VMHvl area is sufficient to sup-
press aggression independent of LS cell body activity.
LS Input Suppresses VMHvl Cell Activity In Vitro
Given the clear suppressive effects of LS-VMHvl projection on
aggression, we next examined the influence of LS input on the
activity of VMHvl cells. After viral expression of ChR2 in LS neu-
rons for 6 weeks, we first confirmed that the LS neurons could
influence the activity of the VMHvl neurons in vitro. We pre-
pared acute brain slices and made whole-cell recordings
from VMHvl neurons. Given that VMH cells are almost entirely
glutamatergic, transgenic mice expressing ZsGreen in glutama-
tergic cells were used for a subset of experiments to facilitate
the identification of the VMHvl (Figure 5A) [32]. After each
recording, cells were filled with biocytin and histologically
confirmed to be within the boundary of the VMHvl (Figures
5B and 5C). During recording, blue light (473 nm) was applied
through a 403 objective centered over the soma of the re-
corded neuron at either 5 or 20 Hz while cells were held at
moderately depolarized values (�–40 mV). In 9/11 cells, we
observed light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs)
ranging from 82 to 330 pA (blue; Figures 5D and 5E) with a la-
tency of 3 ± 0.56 ms (mean ± SD). These currents were blocked
by the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (1 mM; black, Fig-
ures 5D and 5E) but were unaffected by the GABAB receptor
antagonist CGP (1 mM; red, Figures 5D and 5E). Given the short
latency and the small jitter of light-evoked IPSCs, the recorded
cells
are
likely
to
receive
direct
inhibitory
inputs
from
GABAergic LS neurons.
The impact of LS input on VMHvl spiking activity was inves-
tigated by applying 500 ms inward current pulses in 50 pA in-
crements from 0 to 400 pA either with or without blue light
pulses (20 ms, 20 Hz). Across cells, light activation of LS termi-
nals could significantly reduce spiking evoked by large current
steps (paired t test, p % 0.05 for the largest three current
steps) when the firing rate was relatively high (mean ± SD:
7.2 ± 5.8 spikes/s) (Figures 5F and 5H). In 8/11 cells, rebound
spikes were observed after 500 ms hyperpolarizing current
steps ranging from –50 pA to –500 pA (Figure 5I). Interestingly,
in 7 of the 8 cells that showed rebound spiking, we observed a
prominent ‘‘sag’’ in the voltage response to the hyperpolarizing
current (Figure 5I). The magnitude of the sag was significantly
correlated with the number of rebound spikes (Figure 5J), and
the sag was not observed in the three cells without rebound
spiking (Figure 5K), suggesting that the hyperpolarization-acti-
vated cation current (Ih) could be responsible for generating
the rebound spiking.
LS Input Causes Differential Activity Changes in Attack-
Excited and Attack-Inhibited Cells
To understand how the LS input might influence the in vivo ac-
tivity of VMHvl cells, especially those that respond during
aggression, we expressed ChR2 in the LS and implanted an
optrode to record the responses of VMHvl cells during male-
male interaction and during light activation of LS-VMH termi-
nals (Figure 6A) and the LS (Figure 7A). We recorded a total
of 233 units from eight animals with electrode tracks centered
in the VMHvl (Figure 6B). 231 units were tested with LS-VMH
stimulation, and 224 of those units were tested with LS direct
stimulation.
During recording, a group-housed BALB/c male intruder was
introduced into the home cage of the recorded mouse, which
Current Biology 26, 593–604, March 7, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
597
 quickly elicited approach, investigation, and repeated attacks.
Among the 233 recorded units, 65 (27.9%) showed increased
spiking activity during attack (averaged Z score during the last
second of attack > 2), while 26 (11.2%) decreased firing rate
(Z score < –2) (Figures 6C and 6D).
To examine the response of VMHvl cells to LS input, we
delivered blue light pulses (5–10 times for 20 s, 5 Hz, 20 ms
pulses) through the implanted optrode in the presence of a
male intruder regardless of the ongoing behavior. The light
delivered through the optrode was at low intensity (0.2–
0.3 mW), and it did not alter aggressive behaviors significantly
(Figure S4A). The 20 ms LS-VMH terminal activation induced
clear activity fluctuations in the VMHvl cells, starting 8 ms after
the light onset and lasting up to 70 ms post-stimulation (Figures
6E–6G). For those cells that were optically sensitive, we found
that light stimulation mainly suppressed VMHvl cell activity
initially (8–15 ms after light onset), with 43/231 units decreasing

8–15 ms aligned to light onset < –1) and 8/231 units increased
firing (averaged Z score > 1) (Figures 6F and 6G). However, be-
tween 0 to 20 ms after light offset, 72/231 units showed
increased activity (averaged Z score > 1), whereas only 9/231
units showed decreased activity (averaged Z score < –1).
This is surprising, as it suggests that despite receiving inhibitory

 input from the LS, VMHvl cells were actually excited rather than
inhibited by the LS-VMHvl stimulation, which should have
promoted attack based on our previous optogenetic activation
studies in the VMHvl [20]. To further understand the effect of
the optical stimulation on VMHvl attack-related cells, we exam-
ined the relationship between responses during attack and
during light stimulation. We found that the early (8–15 ms) light
responses were not correlated with the attack responses (r =
0.03, p = 0.67; Figure 6H), given that attack-excited and
attack-inhibited units were similarly suppressed. However, the
post-light excitation was significantly inversely correlated with
the attack response (r = –0.34, p = 8.5 3 10�8) such that the
attack-inhibited units were much more likely to show strong
post-light excitation (Figure 6I). When we considered the early
and late light-induced responses together, the overall light
response was significantly negatively correlated with the attack
responses (r = –0.30, p = 3.3 3 10�6; Figure 6J).
To understand how light stimulation affected VMHvl activity in
our optogenetic experiment, we delivered blue light through a
230 mm optic fiber implanted above the LS while recording the
activities of VMHvl cells during social interaction (Figure 7A).
We used a light pulsing protocol (20 ms, 5 Hz, 1–3 mW) similar

 to that used in our optogenetic study, and as expected, attack
decreased during light when compared with the time-matched
period before light (Figure S4B). The effect of LS cell body stim-
ulation on VMHvl activity was qualitatively similar to the LS-VMH
terminal stimulation, but it had a longer delay and was much
more robust (Figure 7B). Across the population, upon each
20 ms light pulse, VMHvl cells were briefly suppressed and
then showed strong excitation (Figure 7C). When the 20 s light
pulsing period was considered as a whole, we observed units
being clearly inhibited or excited during the light delivery (Figures
7D and 7E; additional sample cells in Figures S5A–S5F). Across
the population, the attack response was significantly negatively
correlated with the 20 s light response (r = –0.34, p = 2.6 3 10�7)
such that strong attack-excited units were more likely to be in-
hibited by light, whereas strong attack-inhibited units were
more likely to be excited by light (Figure 7F). The mean firing
rate of attack-excited cells was significantly decreased during
the light stimulation (one-sample t test, p = 0.01, n = 58), whereas

 attack-inhibited cells were strongly excited by LS stimulation
(one-sample t test, p = 0.01, n = 23; Figures 7G and 7H).
Attack-nonresponsive cells were also excited by the light (one-
sample t test, p = 9.4 3 10�5, n = 143), but the response was
significantly weaker than that of attack-inhibited cells (p =
5.9 3 10�6, one-way ANOVA followed by multiple pair compar-
ison) (Figure 7I).
Although attack was suppressed during light stimulation, this
was unlikely to be the only cause of the firing rate change dur-
ing light, given that the response was evident after each 20 ms
light pulse, which was too short for any behavioral change (Fig-
ure 7B). Furthermore, the light-induced response remained
qualitatively the same when we only considered trials when

potentially modulate aggression through its interaction with

 VMHvl by shifting the activity balance between these two
populations.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed that the pathway from the LS to the
VMHvl area is highly effective in modulating aggressive behav-
iors. Optogenetic activation of the GABAergic LS-VMH pathway
terminated both natural inter-male attack and septal rage
but had little effect on male-female mounting. Chronic in vivo
optrode recording revealed that LS input suppressed attack-
excited cells but surprisingly increased firing of attack-inhibited
cells in and around the VMHvl. Thus, the LS can effectively
modulate aggression by shifting the balance between attack-
excited and attack-inhibited cells in the medial hypothalamus.
The LS-VMH Pathway Modulates Aggression
The rage response induced by septal lesion has been reported in
numerous studies [5–7, 33]. More recently, GABAA receptor acti-
vation in the LS was shown to increase aggression in male ham-
sters, whereas GABAA receptor inactivation in the LS decreases
maternal aggression in lactating mice [8, 9]. Consistent with the
septal rage observed in previous studies, here we showed that
LS-inactivation-induced attack differed from naturalistic territo-
rial aggression in that the manipulated animals attacked both
males and females whereas intact males rarely attack females.
Thus, LS inactivation is likely to induce complex emotional and
social recognition deficits beyond increased aggression. Indeed,
the LS has been implicated in the regulation of affect, anxiety,
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and various aspects of
social behaviors [26, 27, 34–38].
Despite the fact that the increased attack induced by the LS
inactivation may be not purely territory related, activating the
pathway from the LS to the VMHvl area suppressed natural
inter-male aggression. Upon LS-VMH stimulation, the test ani-
mals quickly aborted an ongoing attack, but they continuously
moved around the cage and investigated the intruder. Interest-
ingly, LS-VMH stimulation had little effect on male-female
mounting (Figures 3E, 3G, and 3I). During LS-VMH activation,
the latency to stop mounting and the total percentage of time
spent in mounting was not affected. Previous studies showed
that although cells in the VMHvl were weakly excited during
female investigation, VMHvl neuronal activity was largely un-
changed or was even suppressed during advanced sexual be-
haviors [20]. In our current experiment, we presented a female
mouse as an intruder to the recorded animal at the end of our
recording sessions to further evaluate the involvement of the
VMHvl cells in sexual behaviors. We found that 18/233 (7.7%)
of VMHvl cells were significantly activated (Z > 2) during female
investigation, while 42/233 (18.0%) cells were suppressed
(Z < –2). In comparison, 27.9% (65/233) cells increased spiking
activity and 11% (26/233) decreased activity while attacking
males. Notably, among the female-excited cells, the majority
(12/18) also significantly increased firing while attacking males,
indicating that female-excited cells preferentially overlap with
male-excited cells. Thus, as a population, the VMHvl is more
responsive to males than to females and probably plays a
more important role in male aggression than in sexual behaviors
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figures S6 and S7).
Consistent with this hypothesis, reversible pharmacogenetic
or optogenetic inhibition of VMHvl cells significantly suppressed
aggression but failed to stop mounting and intromission [20, 22],
although long-term perturbation, such as killing progesterone
receptor-expressing cells in the area, reduced the number of in-
tromissions and the duration of each intromission [21].
One limitation of the present study is that LS projection to the
medial hypothalamus is not confined to the VMHvl. Areas
lateral and ventral to the VMHvl including the juxtaventromedial
region of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHAjv) and tuberal area
(TU) also contain ChR2-EYFP fibers and may have been
affected by the light. However, several lines of evidence sug-
gest that LHAjv and TU might also play roles in aggression.
Both LHAjv and TU are reciprocally connected with the VMHvl;
show projection patterns similar to those of the VMHvl [39, 40];
show induction of Fos, a molecular surrogate of neural activity,
after fighting [20]; and are parts of the ‘‘hypothalamic attack
area’’ proposed in rats [41]. The main difference between the
LHAjv and TU and the VMHvl is that the former two areas
contain mostly GABAergic cells (see http://www.brain-map.
org experiment ID: 72081554), whereas the cells in the VMHvl
are nearly exclusively glutamatergic. One intriguing possibility
is that some of the recorded attack-inhibited cells are actually
located in the LHAjv and/or TU. The decreased activity of the
GABAergic cells in the LHAjv/TU and increased activity of the
glutamatergic cells in the VMHvl may work synergistically on
downstream cells to initiate attack, while LS input may sup-
press attack by shifting the relative activity between these
two populations. Future studies examining the influence of LS
input on genetically tagged VMHvl or LHAjv/TU cells will help
test this hypothesis.
Differential Responses of Attack-Inhibited and Attack-
Excited Cells to LS Stimulation
Whole-cell in vitro recordings revealed that over 80% of VMHvl
cells were inhibited by LS input. Optrode recording further
demonstrated that the initial light-evoked response (within the
first 15 ms) was predominantly inhibitory (Figures 6F and 6G).
Thus, both attack-inhibited and attack-excited cells are likely
to receive inhibitory inputs from the LS cells. However, their over-
all responses during the LS stimulation were significantly
different. Whereas attack-excited cells were inhibited by LS
optical stimulation, attack-inhibited cells showed an overall in-
crease in firing rate due to the strong post-light excitation. This
difference in light-induced activity change could be caused
either by differences in biophysical properties of the cells or their
placement in the neural network. A potential mechanism for the
post-inhibitory rebound excitation is the activation of hyperpo-
larization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels
and low voltage-activated T-type or L-type calcium channels
[42]. In situ hybridization revealed that both T-type calcium chan-
nels and HCN1 are enriched in the VMHvl [43] (see also http://
www.brain-map.org, experiments 71587822 and 77280561).
Consistent with the expression of these ion channels in the
VMHvl, we found that over 70% of VMHvl cells had rebound
spikes after a brief hyperpolarizing current injection, and the
number of rebound spikes was correlated with the magnitude
of the initial sag, a signature of Ih current (Figures 5I–5K). Thus,
attack-inhibited and attack-excited cells may differ in their
602
Current Biology 26, 593–604, March 7, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
 expression levels of HCN channels and/or T-type calcium chan-
nels, which could contribute to their difference in post-light excit-
atory responses. Under natural conditions, these differential re-
sponses may boost the impact of a transient inhibitory input
onto the aggression circuit to effectively control behavior.
Alternatively, the post-light excitation observed in the attack-
inhibited cells may not be cell autonomous but rather may be a
circuit property. Since LS inputs appear to target both the
VMHvl cells and cells surrounding the VMHvl (Figure 3C),
during the LS stimulation, VMHvl cells could receive both direct
inhibition
and
indirect
disinhibition
from
the
surrounding
GABAergic neurons that collectively determine the changes in
firing rate. These parallel and counter-acting projection pat-
terns, one directly from the upstream region and one relayed
through local GABAergic cells, are prevalent in the CNS [44],
although they have not been studied in the context of the LS
to medial hypothalamic projection and could represent an inter-
esting direction for future studies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Experimental mice were sexually experienced, singly housed, wild-type male
C57BL/6N (12–24 weeks, Charles River) Vgat-ires-Cre and Vglut2-ires-Cre
mice [29]. Intruders were either BALB/c males or C57BL/6 females (both
10–30 weeks). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of NYU Langone Medical Center in accordance
with NIH guidelines.
Stereotactic Injection and Implantation
For
optogenetic
manipulation,
each
wild-type
animal
was
injected
bilaterally with a total volume of 0.2–0.5 ml adeno-associated virus, which
consisted of an equal mixture of AAV2/1 EF1a::DIO.hChR2(H134R).EYFP
(2 3 1012 PFU/ml, UNC Vector Core), AAV2/1 CMV::CRE (2 3 1012 PFU/ml,

into

(coordinates

0.45
mm
ML,
3.0 mm DV). Vgat-ires-Cre mice were injected with 0.125–0.25 ml AAV2/1
EF1a::DIO.hChR2(H134R).EYFP.
Control
animals
were
injected
with
0.25 ml of AAV2/1 CMV::PI.eGFP.WPRE.bGH (3 3 1012 PFU/ml, University
of Pennsylvania Vector Core). Double cannulae were implanted 0.5 mm
above LS injection sites, and 230 mm multimode optic fibers with
1.25
mm
ferrules
were
implanted
0.8
mm
above
the
VMHvl
area
(–1.7 mm AP, 0.68 mm ML, 5.0 mm DV) to allow light delivery. For optrode
recording, a movable optrode containing sixteen 13 mm tungsten micro-
wires and one 105 mm multimode optic fiber (Thorlabs) was implanted
immediately above the putative VMHvl and a 230 mm optic fiber was im-
planted above the LS. For LS inactivation, 0.2–0.3 ml of 0.33 mg/ml musci-
mol (Sigma) (Figure 1) or 8% lidocaine and 0.1 mM TTX mixture (Figure 4) in
saline were injected into the LS through the implanted double cannulae.
Optogenetic Activation
For LS stimulation, experiments started 2–4 weeks after injection. For LS-
VMHvl stimulation, experiments started 4–8 weeks after injection. During the
test, male BALB/c intruders were introduced into the resident’s cage, and light
stimulations (20 ms, 20 Hz, 1–3 mW, 20 s), interleaved with no-light sham stim-
ulations, were initiated after spontaneously occurring attacks were observed.
The same stimulation protocol was used for mounting behavioral tests in the
presence of a C57BL/6 female.
In Vitro Slice Recording
Acute slices of the VMHvl were prepared from adult C57Bl/6N mice that were
used in the optogenetic experiments and Vglut2-ires-Cre 3 Ai6 mice injected
with 0.25 ml AAV2/1 EF1a::DIO.hChR2(H134R).EYFP (2 3 1012 PFU/ml, UNC
Vector Core) into the LS. Somatic whole-cell recordings were made from
VMHvl neurons in either voltage-clamp or current-clamp mode with a Multi-
clamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices).
In Vivo Optrode Recording
During optrode recording, we introduced a male intruder and then delivered
blue light first through the optrode (5–10 repetitions of 20 s, 20 ms, 5 Hz pulses)
and then through the implanted optic fiber at the LS (8–10 repetitions of 20 s,
20 ms, 5 Hz pulses). The light delivery is independent of ongoing behaviors.
After removing the male intruder, we then introduced the female intruder for
10 min without any light delivery. Acquired spikes were sorted using an Offline
Sorter (Plexon). All behavioral and electrophysiological analyses were per-
formed using customized MATLAB software [45, 46].
