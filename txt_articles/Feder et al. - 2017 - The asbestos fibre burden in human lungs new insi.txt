ABSTRACT
The traceability of asbestos fibres in human lungs is a matter of discussion especially for
chrysotile. This issue is of high significance for differential diagnosis, risk assessment and occupational
compensation. At present no intra-individual longitudinal information is available. This study addresses
the question whether the asbestos fibre burden in human lungs decreases with time after exposure
cessation.
The database of the German Mesothelioma Register was screened for patients with asbestos body counts
of at least 500 fibres per gram of wet lung, which had been analysed twice from different tissue excisions
at minimum intervals of 4 years.
Twelve datasets with individual longitudinal information were discovered with a median interval of
about 8 years (range 4–21 years). Both examinations were performed after exposure cessation (median:
surgery, 9.5 years; autopsy, 22 years). Pulmonary asbestos fibre burden was stable between both
examinations (median 1623/4269 asbestos bodies per gram wet lung). Electron microscopy demonstrated a
preponderance of chrysotile (median 80%).
This study is the first to present longitudinal intra-individual data about the asbestos fibre burden in
living human lungs. The high biopersistence of amphiboles, but also of chrysotile, offers mechanistic
explanations for fibre toxicity, especially the long latency period of asbestos-related diseases.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL LUNG DISEASE
 Introduction
The major health hazards associated with asbestos are fibrogenicity and carcinogenicity, with lung cancer
and mesothelioma as the main representatives. It has been shown that the risk of developing
mesothelioma or lung cancer increases proportionally to the asbestos fibre burden of the lungs [1], and
also the extent of pleural plaques has been found to be associated with fibre numbers in lung tissue [2].
Thus fibre clearance and biopersistence are considered the most important factors for diagnosis and risk
assessment of malignant and non-malignant diseases.
The latency period from first asbestos exposure to the manifestation of an asbestos-induced disease may be
10–60 years with shorter times for asbestosis and plaques and longer times for lung cancer and
mesothelioma. Thus an asbestos-related disease might occur a long time after exposure cessation.
Therefore, the question of the traceability of asbestos fibres in lungs tissue after prolonged intervals is of
significance, e.g. for the differentiation of asbestosis and further fibrotic lung diseases, such as idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [3, 4]. In this context lung dust analysis is considered a valuable tool [5, 6].
Asbestos fibre analyses in the lungs of asbestos-exposed workers have a long tradition in establishing a link
between exposure and disease [7]. The tissue is digested, the digestate collected on a membrane filter and
fibres are counted by light microscopy, phase-contrast or scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) may also be used. In addition, the fibre type can be analysed
with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis [6]. It is important to know that for assessing the
asbestos fibre burden a laboratory should be well experienced, have a standardised protocol and established
reference values using the same method [6].
It is well known that chrysotile fibre numbers in the human lungs are lower than amphibole fibre numbers
[8–11], although chrysotile was more frequently used in industry. This may be explained by the fact that
chrysotile fibres tend to fray, are very flexible and disintegrate if exposed to acids [12], thus accelerated
clearance of inhaled chrysotile fibres from the lungs sounds plausible [13]. Although the hazardous nature
of amphibole fibres is not challenged [8, 14], the impact of chrysotile fibres is a matter of discussion [15,
16] and further research is needed [17].
Using diverse approaches, the persistence of asbestos fibres was investigated in experimental animal studies
[18, 19]. Investigations in humans were performed in asbestos miners in Canada [8, 14] and Australia [20]
using analytical electron microscopy for fibre counts and conventional light microscopy for asbestos
bodies. Asbestos concentrations found in the air in the working environment were related to fibre
concentrations in lung tissue from autopsies. In another study autopsy samples from different patients
with different periods of exposure cessation were compared [21]. All these studies suffer from the fact that
they have no measured starting point of the asbestos fibre burden in the human lung tissue to compare
their results to because of their cross-sectional design.
Instead of obtaining the half-lives of asbestos fibres by approximation and extrapolation [8, 14, 20], the
aim of the present study was to present data based on longitudinal intra-individual asbestos quantitation
that was performed in the lung tissues of patients with asbestos diseases over intervals of several years.
Our samples are taken from different tissue excisions from the same patient. The asbestos fibre burden has
been counted by phase contrast microscopy routinely. Additionally an EDX analysis has been done to
determine the asbestos fibre type.
Material and methods
The research was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Tissue removal
occurred for medical reasons only or was carried out during autopsies requested by insurance companies.
Relatives gave consent for all autopsies.
Data screening
The German Mesothelioma Register had 23955 datasets available with asbestos body counts performed
during routine examinations of lung tissue samples or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) generated between
1987 and 2015. This data set was filtered for the following criteria (see also figure 1):
1) Results of asbestos body counts had to be available.
2) Earlier asbestos fibre burden from surgery or bronchoalveolar lavage had to be available.
3) The highest asbestos body count had to be above 500 fibres per gram of wet lung tissue. This filter
ensured a relevant asbestos fibre burden to study a potential decrease of the asbestos concentration in the
lung tissues. According to ROGGLI and PRATT [22], 200 asbestos bodies per gram of wet lung tissue
correspond to two asbestos bodies in a histological specimen of 2×2 cm at a 5 µm section thickness. In
Germany at least two asbestos bodies in a specimen of 1×1 cm are required for the histological diagnosis

 of asbestosis [23]. Given a section thickness of 2–4 µm and two to four section specimens, this is
equivalent to about 500 asbestos bodies per gram of wet lung tissue evaluated in lung dust analysis.
4) Analyses were from different tissue excisions with a time interval of at least 4 years.
Histology
Histopathological evaluation was performed by a pathologist who was highly experienced in the
assessment of asbestos-induced changes. Asbestosis grading followed national [24] and international
criteria [6, 25], i.e. primarily the Helsinki Criteria [5, 26].
Analysis of the asbestos fibre burden in lung tissues or BAL
Lung dust analysis was performed using established methods [27, 28] and is described in detail in the
guideline
on
the
diagnosis
and
medical
appraisal
of
asbestos-associated
diseases
[23].
Briefly,
formalin-fixed lung tissue samples or lavage fluid were digested using 12% sodium hypochlorite. The
lysate was filtered through a 2 µm Millipore nitrocellulose membrane and examined under a light
microscope in a meandering pattern using ×200 or ×400 magnification and phase contrast. Fibres where
analysed by transmitted and polarised light. Asbestos bodies, pseudo-asbestos bodies, asbestos fibres and
structures with a non-identifiable core fibre were counted separately [29]. For comparability of the data, all
counts provided in the original historical counting protocol were calculated to gram of wet lung tissue. In
the following, all concentrations for asbestos bodies/asbestos fibres are per gram of wet lung tissue.
In view of the heterogeneous distribution of asbestos bodies in lung tissue [29], the content of asbestos
fibres was determined at least in duplicate whenever sufficient tissue was available. In autopsy cases,
analyses were performed in the upper and lower lobes of either side if possible. Care was taken to include
healthy tumour-free lung parenchyma in the ashing analysis [28–30]. The sample with the highest asbestos
body concentration determined was used in all cases [23].
Electron microscopy
Electron microscopic analysis was performed by field energy (FE)-SEM (Carl-Zeiss AG, Oberkochen,
Germany), as described previously [31], and TEM (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), both coupled with an EDX
analysis system. For TEM the digestate was filtered through carbon-coated polycarbonate filters. Samples
were cut out and placed onto a grid, then the filter was collapsed with chloroform and finally grids were
evaporated using a second thin layer of carbon. We carried out qualitative analyses only for the purpose of
identifying the nature of the asbestos fibres. This analysis included both fibres that were longer or shorter
than 5 µm.
Results
The database research generated a collective of 12 patients with longitudinal data of the asbestos fibre
burden. Tissue removal was due to a suspected tumour (58.3%), to pleural thickening (16.7%) or to lung
fibrosis of unknown origin (8.3%). In 16.7% of samples, a former BAL was available (table 1). The tissues
were obtained in 50% from the right lung and in 25% from the left lung. No sampling site was given in 8.3%,

 and 16.7% were from BAL. The first tissue excision/BAL with fibre analysis had been performed between
1987 and 2011. At this time the patients’ last exposure to asbestos dated back 3–29 years (median 9.5 years).
Autopsies including fibre analysis for all patients were performed between 1996 and 2015 in the context of
insurance enquiries. Age at death ranged from 62 to 82 years (median 76.5 years). Tumour recurrences
were found in 25%; in 8.3% a second primary tumour was diagnosed, and peritoneal mesothelioma had
developed in another 8.3%. In 16.7% asbestosis grade III was diagnosed, but grade I diseases dominated
(58.3%) (table 2). All patients with higher grade asbestoses had severe pleural complications, including
extensive plaques with rounded or plate atelectases, diffuse pleural fibrosis, hyalinosis complicata, lung
encasement and pleural thickening because of recurrent pleurisy. All patients died of their asbestos-related
disease. The complete findings are listed in the supplementary material. Occupational history is listed in
table 2. The time course of events is illustrated in figure 2.

 The time period between tissue removals varied from 4 to 21 years (median 8 years). Taking the
maximum count from each patient the first analysis produced a median of 1623 (431–9750), and the
second analysis of 4269 (714–53663) asbestos bodies per gram of wet lung tissue (table 1). Taking all
counts from one analysis into consideration the pulmonary asbestos body concentration showed a median
of 1313 (49–9750) in the first tissue excision and 2018 (198–53663) in the second one (figure 3). The
median pulmonary asbestos fibre concentration (total of asbestos bodies and bare fibres ) was 1623 at
surgery and 2202 at autopsy (supplementary material). For the whole group there was no relevant decrease
in the asbestos fibre burden over the investigated time (p=0.9863, one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test).

FIGURE 3 Results of fibre analyses at surgery (first tissue excision) and autopsy (second tissue excision) in relation to time from 10 patients. From
these 10 patients the asbestos fibre burden of the lung has been determined from tissue both times. Two patients with fibre analysis from a
bronchoalveolar lavage are not considered here. Illustrated are the results of the highest asbestos body count in relation to time (a) and all asbestos
body counts from one patient’s lungs separately (b). The corresponding time interval is already illustrated in figure 2 and listed in table 1. It is easily
seen in (b) that the counts from surgery are within the range of the counts from autopsy. For two patients the lower count from surgery tissue could
be explained histologically (supplementary material). Patient 2 had tuberculosis in the first tissue and patient 6 had fibrosis with a multi-etiological
clinical picture with an asbestos-dependent and an asbestos-independent component (see supplementary material for details).

 In only 8% the result of the asbestos body count from autopsy was below the sample obtained during
surgery. Here, amphibole asbestos was the dominant fibre type at autopsy (table 1, figure 4).
Electron microscopic analyses of all available samples were done (n=6). In 33.3% of samples mainly
amphibole was found by FE-SEM/EDX analysis (65% to 90%) (table 1, figure 4), but in the other 66.7%
chrysotile was the dominant asbestos fibre (at different percentages of 80% to 95%) (table 1, figure 5).
When the fibre analysis was done by TEM, the percentages varied a little bit but the statement was
confirmed (table 1). The proportion of chrysotile fibres did not correlate with the duration of asbestos
exposure (p=0.65; rho –0.24, Spearman’s rank correlation) or with the time interval between last asbestos
exposure and tissue analyses (p=0.74; rho 0.18 Spearman’s rank test).
Discussion
Resection of lung tissue for scientific or insurance purposes alone is not admissible and ethically not
justifiable [28]. It is thus impossible to study the asbestos fibre burden in the human lung in vivo within a
prospective systematic study.
This study is the first to present data from intra-individual longitudinal asbestos fibre analyses that were
obtained by means of standardised analytical procedures in the lung tissues of patients with previous
asbestos exposure at intervals of several years (figure 2). Our results show that asbestos continues to be
demonstrable in human lungs, that also chrysotile can be identified after many years, and that there is no
significant reduction of asbestos fibre concentrations in lung tissues over time after exposure cessation.
The unique benefit of the data presented here is to have a measured starting point of the asbestos fibre
burden of the human lung tissue to compare later findings with. Earlier studies defined biopersistence of
asbestos in lung tissue after animal experiments [18, 19, 33] or hypothetical models that estimated baseline

 exposure concentrations from measuring airborne asbestos concentrations at workplaces; these data were
then associated with autopsy results [8, 10, 14, 20]. Other authors compared fibre counts from different time
periods [34, 35]. Our samples have been analysed in a quantitative way by phase contrast microscopy in the
same laboratory using the same method. The laboratory has had experience in this method since 1987.
Individual asbestos concentrations in lung tissue remained stable across intervals of 4–21 years between
the two tissue excisions. Other authors reported a reduction of the asbestos fibre burden in lung tissue
over 25 years of investigation [34], but were easily able to explain this with a reduction in exposure
because of the 1972 asbestos ban for insulating products in the USA. In contrast to other authors, the
analyses reported in this manuscript concerned one and the same patients. Hence, past asbestos exposure
was identical for both analyses, but occurred much earlier in each case (figure 2). Thus, exposure is not a
confounder in the present data.
Assuming a variation by a factor of seven to 10 for asbestos concentrations within a human lung [29]
definitely places the asbestos fibre concentrations in 90% of our patients within the range of the samples
that had been analysed 4–21 years earlier (figure 3). This ties in very well with earlier reports of latency
periods from 10 to 60 years of asbestos-related diseases, which are considered to develop typically while
asbestos is present [36].
In some patients fibre numbers obtained after autopsies were higher than those after surgery. This may be
explained by the well-known requirement to evaluate several tissue samples of one lung because of the
heterogeneous distribution of asbestos bodies in lung tissue [6, 26, 29]. Such multiple tissue samples that
are suitable for fibre analyses can be collected only by autopsies. Tissue from surgery is of limited size or
from the side of the tumour in cases where a tumour is present. The contralateral lobe is available from

 autopsy tissue, as recommended in the guidelines [6, 26]; also, the lower lobe is available, which
commonly contains higher fibre counts. According to the German AMWF guideline [23], we took the
highest count as the result in table 1 but relativised the results in figure 3, when all counts are considered.
With restriction of tissue availability the asbestoses were still clearly confirmed from surgery tissue.
Light microscopy with phase contrast only reveals asbestos fibres with a thickness exceeding 0.2 µm.
However, the result of light microscopic counts are a good measure for the overall asbestos fibre burden of
the lung tissue under investigation and may well serve for comparative analyses [30].
Unlike other authors [28, 29], we did not pool samples but analysed each of them separately. This
approach affords the opportunity of interpreting the asbestos concentrations in direct relation to histology.
Moreover, focal accumulations in a pulmonary lobe can also be detected and be properly assessed because
a given sample from one lobe will not be diluted by samples from other lobes that contain lower
concentrations. Asbestos-related changes of the lung have been shown to predominantly affect the lower
lobe; this will only be reflected adequately when different samples are analysed separately.
In 16.7% where contact with asbestos dated back to between 20 and 29 years, the first lung dust analyses
had been performed on BAL samples. They showed elevated asbestos fibre burden that had been
confirmed at autopsies carried out 8–13 years later. BAL is indeed useful in establishing earlier asbestos
exposure even if it dates back a very long time [35, 37, 38]. This was once more corroborated in the
present study.
A qualitative fibre analysis by EDX analysis demonstrated chrysotile as the main fibre in most tissue
samples (66.7%) with asbestos exposure cessation dating back up to 37 years. This is in line with the
results of other authors who found mainly chrysotile in lungs of German patients [9]. In contrast, only
amphiboles could be detected in cases with pneumoconiosis in the UK [11], but chrysotile concentrations
showed no elevation compared with a control group. The same applies to a study conducted in North
America [39], where again only amphibole asbestos was found in mesothelioma patients. On the other
hand, an increase in asbestos-related diseases has been observed in miners and millers in Canada,
although exposure involved only chrysotile fibres. The fibres were demonstrable in lung tissue over several
years [8, 14]. An explanation for this might be qualitative differences in regional asbestos exposure.
Possibly, the resident times in lung tissues differ with differing origin and shape of chrysotile fibres.
Different techniques of tissue preparation and fibre analysis might be another explanation for different
findings in different studies. In lung dust analysis, only asbestos can be detected that has been extracted
from tissue and which is not lost as a function of this process. Chrysotile is dissolved completely when
acids are applied [12]. Fibres may also be destroyed by uncontrolled use of ultrasound or may be lost
during multiple steps of centrifugation [28]. For electron microscopic analysis main parts of the body of
the fibre are destroyed to access the core fibre. The strong beam needed for TEM might also destroy the
asbestos fibre leading to significant identification errors [40]. In our routine examinations great
importance is set to keep losses at the lowest possible level when processing the samples and
centrifugation is not used. To analyse the core fibre we used FE-SEM, which has a higher resolution than
SEM; there is also less damage to the fibre than with TEM. As TEM is considered to be the gold standard
for fibre analysis [6, 26], we also applied this method to the available samples confirming the FE-SEM
data.
Electron microscopic analyses of fibre types in this study were performed in autoptic tissues. The total
asbestos fibre burden of the lungs had remained constant across the complete period of investigations.
Even at the time of the first tissue/BAL sampling, the patients had no longer been exposed to asbestos.
Thus it is clear that there has been no relevant change in the ratio of amphibole to chrysotile fibres and
that the chrysotile concentration has remained stable over the investigation period of 4–21 years. This also
explains why we could not identify a correlation between the chrysotile content and the time interval from
last exposure or the duration of exposure. Our results perfectly correlate to data published by CHURG and
DEPAOLI [21], who found that the ratio of chrysotile to amphibole (in this case tremolite) concentration did
not change with time by comparing two sets of patients with a short and a long time interval to exposure
cessation.
Since the asbestos fibre concentrations had remained stable in the patients investigated, our data
indicate that the well-known and scientifically recognised reduction of chrysotile fibres in human lung
tissue [8, 11, 39] must have occurred at a very early time point. At the time of the first tissue sampling the
last asbestos exposure had ended 3–29 years ago (median 9.5 years). This means that the reduction of
chrysotile fibres must have occurred within this time span. Our study again confirms what has been
postulated by CHURG and DEPAOLI [21]: both studies “imply that the failure of chrysotile to accumulate in
human lungs reflects events that occur early after exposure rather than long-term clearance mechanisms”

 and is best explained by the natural defence mechanisms of the human lung, e.g. mucociliary clearance in
the bronchi and expectoration, and possibly acid hydrolysis by lysosomes. This is in line with the half-life
times of a few weeks to several months found by Churg for chrysotile in human lung tissues [8]. Apart
from that, the type and geometry of fibres seem to play a part. Certain chrysotile fibres which, like
amphibole fibres, have successfully overcome the defence mechanisms of the lung and penetrated deeply
into the alveoli can no longer be eliminated, and are therefore traceable in the human lung for many years.
Owing to their extreme biopersistence, the fibres cannot be biologically reduced by the lung macrophages.
The macrophages die and form the typical asbestos bodies [7, 33]. By their pin-like/acicular structure the
fibres are prone to get caught in the alveoli of the lung parenchyma, so that clearing them from the system
cannot be achieved. The human lung has no defence mechanisms that could eliminate the invasive fibres
from the alveoli of the lung. Asbestos fibres, therefore, remain in the lung where their sustained presence
causes lung disease. Continuous irritation of the tissue results in chronic inflammation to which the tissue
responds by scar formation [36]. It is not only the amphibole fibres that can be identified in lung tissue
over many years, but also chrysotile fibres, as is typical of pneumoconiosis due to asbestos fibres.
The hazardous nature of chrysotile asbestos is under discussion. The answer to this question is of high
impact for physicians, toxicologists and occupational as well as environmental risk assessment. Our unique
data experimentally confirmed the well-known characteristics of the asbestos fibres (asbestos in ancient
Greek ἄσβεστος=imperishable) for individual human lungs in vivo over many years. Overall, this study
very clearly demonstrates high biopersistence of not only amphibole but also chrysotile asbestos in the
human lung and thus gives mechanistic explanations for the toxicity of the fibre and the long latency
period of asbestos related diseases.
