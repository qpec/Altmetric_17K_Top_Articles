Summary
Adaptive cellular immunity is initiated by antigen-specific interactions between T lymphocytes 
and dendritic cells (DC). Plasmacytoid DC (pDC) support antiviral immunity by linking innate 
and adaptive immune responses. Here we examined pDC spatiotemporal dynamics during viral 
infection to uncover when, where and how they exert their functions. We found that pDC 
accumulated at sites of CD8+ T cell antigen-driven activation in a CCR5-dependent fashion. 
Furthermore, activated CD8+ T cells orchestrated the local recruitment of lymph node resident 
XCR1 chemokine receptor-expressing DC via secretion of the XCL1 chemokine. Functionally, 
this CD8+ T cell mediated reorganization of the local DC network allowed for the interaction and 
cooperation of pDC and XCR1+ DC, thereby optimizing XCR1+ DC maturation and cross-
presentation. These data support a model in which CD8+ T cells upon activation create their own 
optimal priming microenvironment by recruiting additional DC subsets to the site of initial antigen 
recognition.
Graphical Abstract
Introduction
The generation of an adaptive immune response involves multiple myeloid and lymphoid 
cell populations that act in a highly orchestrated manner to permit optimal cellular 
interaction and communication (Qi et al., 2014). The critical interaction that initiates an 
adaptive cell-mediated immune response occurs between antigen-bearing dendritic cells 
(DC) and T cells, leading to proliferation and differentiation of the latter. Key inputs driving 
such responses involve signaling through the T cell receptor (signal 1), costimulatory 
receptors (signal 2), and receptors for inflammatory cytokines (signal 3), along with the 
actions of chemokines and other chemoattractants that fine-tune the localization of

 lymphocytes and DC within secondary lymphoid organs (Chen and Flies, 2013; Curtsinger 
and Mescher, 2010; Fooksman et al., 2010; Thelen and Stein, 2008).
Besides the interaction between antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DC) and T cells other cell 
types contribute to optimal cell-mediated responses (Bendelac et al., 2007; Martin-Fontecha 
et al., 2004; Veiga-Parga et al., 2013). Chief amongst these additional players are 
plasmacytoid DC (pDC) (Yoneyama et al., 2005). pDC morphologically resemble lymphoid 
cells rather than myeloid cells and on a single cell level are known for their ability to 
produce high amounts of interferon (IFN) type I (Swiecki and Colonna, 2015). For this 
function, expression of toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) and TLR9 located in endosomal 
compartments of pDC are critical. This allows them to sense viral infections irrespective of 
viral replication within the pDC.
pDC activity enhances adaptive antiviral CD8+ T cell responses and also contributes to 
innate host defense by inhibiting viral replication during both, acute and chronic viral 
infections (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012; Swiecki et al., 2010). Currently, it is unclear 
how pDC exert these dichotomous functions (Reizis et al., 2011a). While they are the most 
prodigious producers of IFN I on a per cell basis, various other cell types, especially 
macrophages can produce IFN I upon viral infection. Indeed, the total amount of IFN I in 
the serum of mice in various experimental systems is unaltered in the presence or absence of 
pDC (Barchet et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2015). Moreover, pDC appear to be only a transient 
source of IFN I within the first few days of an infection, with the cells then either being 
eliminated or inhibited via an IFN I feedback loop (Swiecki et al., 2011). Some data indicate 
that pDC may support anti-microbial resistance by factors other than IFN I (Ang et al., 
2010), while other studies suggest that pDC can contribute to adaptive immunity by 
acquiring, processing and presenting antigens directly to T cells (Di Pucchio et al., 2008; 
Mouries et al., 2008; Villadangos and Young, 2008). Nevertheless, the majority of published 
work supports the notion that the primary effector function of pDC lays within their capacity 
to produce IFN I (Haeryfar, 2005; Reizis et al., 2011b).
Given that many other leukocytes can produce IFN I, the question then arises as to what the 
special role of pDC IFN I production might be? One possibility could be the ability to 
produce large amounts of IFN I very rapidly or the capacity to secrete a wider array of IFN-
α (Izaguirre et al., 2003). However, using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as model, 
subcapsular macrophages and not pDC proved to be the critical early IFN I source involved 
in host protection (Iannacone et al., 2010). Therefore, we hypothesized that besides the 
timing or amount of IFN I production by pDC, their motility and capacity for relocalization 
might allow them to deliver IFN I at specific sites to promote host defense in a unique 
manner (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2005). This notion is in line with the numerous chemokine 
receptors expressed on pDC that could direct their migrational pattern during infection 
(Miller et al., 2012).
Given this idea, we felt it important to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of pDC 
during an ongoing immune response. To this end we analyzed pDC migration patterns in the 
LN using dynamic intravital 2-photon microscopy (IVM). We found that upon viral 
infection, pDC either migrated to infected macrophages residing in the subcapsular sinus

 (SCS) area in a CXCR3-dependent manner or to CD8+ T cell priming sites in a strictly 
CCR5-dependent manner. We show that pDC were recruited to sites of functional MHCI 
antigen presentation by CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines that were produced in the context of 
productive conventional DC (cDC) – CD8+ T cell interactions. Additionally, CD8+ T cell 
activation led to a rapid production of XCL1, which in turn attracted LN-resident XCR1+ 
DC to CD8+ T cell priming sites. The co-presence of pDC, XCR1+ DC and CD8+ T cells 
within a confined microenvironment allowed for optimal signal exchange, in particular 
involving pDC-derived IFN I. This pDC-derived cytokine optimized the maturation of and 
cross-presentation by XCR1+ DC, enhancing the developing CD8+ T cell response. These 
data reveal a biological concept in which T cells actively orchestrate the local development 
of an optimal priming environment upon their initial successful identification of an antigen-
bearing cDC.
Results
pDC maximize CD8+ T cell responses
To understand how pDC contribute to antiviral immune responses we used modified vaccinia 
virus Ankara (MVA) to study CD8+ T cell responses in the presence or absence of pDC. 
This attenuated cytopathic virus strain does not replicate in vivo and therefore induces a 
highly synchronized immune response in space and time. Additionally, when manipulating 
the IFN I system secondary effects on viral replication and thus antigen abundance that 
impacts the ensuing CD8+ T cell response may be neglected in this experimental approach. 
Clec4C is highly expressed by pDC and Clec4c+/DTR mice provide a means to selectively 
deplete pDC by administration of Diphtheria toxin (DTX) to the animals (Swiecki et al., 
2010) (Figure S1A–D). After footpad infection, we found a significant reduction in both the 
relative and absolute numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells directed against the immuno-
dominant epitope B8R20 in the absence of pDC (Figure 1A–C). Among the smaller cohort 
of activated, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells present on d8 post infection in the DTX-treated 
animals, we only detected modest alterations in CD8+ T cell differentiation using standard 
markers for various effector subsets (KLRG1 and CD127) (Figure 1D, 1E). Functionally, 
there were reduced numbers of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells following in vitro 
restimulation with B8R20 peptide (Figure 1F–H). Among those IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T 
cells, there were no significant changes in polyfunctionality (cells additionally producing 
TNFα and/or IL-2) (Figure 1I, 1J). These data indicate that, in accord with earlier studies, 
pDC help to promote the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell cohort responding to viral infection, 
while having a limited impact on the differentiation and functionality of the reduced number 
of activated T cells.
pDC are recruited to infected macrophages and CD8+ T cell priming sites
To examine whether the specific localization of pDC contributes to these effects on CD8+ T 
cell responses and if so, how such behavior compares to the activity and positioning of pDC 
involved in mediating innate host defense, we employed SiglechGFP/GFP mice that have 
fluorescently marked pDC (Swiecki et al., 2010). IVM was used to visualize and track these 
cells in the steady state and after infection in the LN. In these mice GFP is also expressed in 
medullary macrophages of the LN, however these cells can be easily discriminated from

 pDC based on the brightness of the GFP signal (macrophages are dim) and the morphology 
of the cells (Figure S2A). The MVA used for infection encoded the protein antigen 
ovalbumin (OVA), allowing us to use OT-I T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic OVA-specific 
CD8+ T cells to follow the development of an adaptive immune response at the same time 
(Kastenmuller et al., 2013b).
In the steady state pDC were distributed throughout the LN paracortex and the interfollicular 
area (Figure 2A) with preference around high endothelial venules, similar to human tissue 
(Colonna et al., 2004). Morphologically, pDC resembled lymphocytes and migrated actively 
at an average speed of 5μm/min (Figure 2B, 2C and Movie S1). Track length and 
displacement was significantly lower compared to naïve CD8+ T cells (Figure 2D, 2E), 
indicating that pDC show less extensive tissue scanning as compared to T lymphocytes in 
LN.
Eight hours after infection we found that pDC had translocated to two distinct areas of the 
LN. One fraction of pDC accumulated at the SCS close to the virus-infected macrophages 
(Figure 2F, 2G). Here they arrested and interacted with infected SCS macrophages (Figure 
2H–K and Movie S2). The other fraction of pDC was located around OT-I T cell clusters 
that formed around a virus-infected cDC in the interfollicular area (Figure 2L). These pDC 
directly interacted with the antigen-engaged OT-I T cells and possibly with the infected 
cDC, forming a super-cluster of pDC around the initial CD8+ T cell cluster (Figure 2L–P 
and Movie S3). When imaging pDC behavior early after T cell activation we found evidence 
of pDC migration towards CD8+ T cell clusters in line with either CCR5-dependent 
chemotaxis and/or chemokinesis and subsequent pDC retention at T cell cluster sites (Figure 
2Q).
The direct association between pDC and OT-I T cells might reflect an antigen-specific 
interaction. To examine this possibility, we transferred labelled peptide-pulsed (OVA257) 
splenic cDC and OT-I T cells into pDC reporter mice and visualized their interactions. In 
this experimental set-up antigen-presentation is restricted to the transferred cDC. Twelve 
hours after cDC transfer we found tight interactions between peptide-pulsed cDC and OT-I T 
cells. Importantly, under this condition pDC still formed clusters around OT-I T cells 
suggesting that pDC – CD8+ T cell communication does not require antigen-specific 
interactions (Figure S2B).
In summary, we conclude that pDC show a rapid intranodal relocalization during viral 
infection. Some pDC migrate to the SCS to interact with infected macrophages, while 
another group of pDC accumulates in the vicinity of CD8+ T cells that are activated by 
virus-infected, antigen-presenting cDC.
pDC migrate to infected sites via CXCR3 chemokine receptor
Given the relocation of pDC to two distinct sites within infected LN and some evidence of 
directional migration, we hypothesized that chemokines were playing important roles in 
promoting these positional changes. Several groups have shown that CXCR3 plays a non-
redundant role in controlling lymphocyte migration to the SCS for interactions with infected 
macrophages (Groom et al., 2012; Kastenmuller et al., 2013b; Sung et al., 2012). Therefore,

 we speculated that CXCR3 might also be critical for pDC to migrate to this region of the 
LN. To examine this possibility, we crossed pDC reporter mice to CXCR3-deficient animals 
and infected these mice with MVA OVA tdTomato. In contrast to WT animals, CXCR3-
deficient mice did not show efficient translocation of pDC to the SCS (Figure 3A, 3B and 
Movie S4). Semi-automated quantification supported these visual interpretations (Figure 
3C). The few pDC that were present at the SCS in Cxcr3−/− animals interacted with the 
infected macrophages leading to migrational arrest similar to their WT counterparts (Figure 
3D, 3E). In line with a critical role for CXCR3 for pDC migration to the SCS, we found an 
upregulation of both CXCL9 and CXCL10 after infection with MVA (Figure 3F, 3G). In the 
context of published work showing that SCS macrophages are primary targets of viral 
infection and promote viral replication in the LN, these data suggest that CXCR3-mediated 
pDC recruitment to infected SCS macrophages could contribute to control local viral 
replication and gene expression (Iannacone et al., 2010; Swiecki et al., 2010). To directly 
test this notion, we infected WT, Cle4c+/DTR and CXCR3-deficient animals with replication 
competent VSV in the footpad and analyzed the viral titers 24hrs later. If pDC were 
depleted, we did not detect differences in the viral titers in the popliteal LN but there was a 
significant dissemination of virus to the upstream inguinal LN (Figure S3A). In contrast, in 
CXCR3-deficient animals this enhanced lymphatic viral dissemination was not observed. 
However, CXCR3-deficient animals had significantly increased pDC numbers in the LNs 
before infection as compared to control animals, while the migrational speed was unaltered 
(Figure S3B, S3C). The increased density of pDC in the CXCR3-deficient mice may place 
enough of these cells near to the SCS macrophages in the steady state that chemokine-
mediated guidance is no longer a limiting feature of the response upon infection. These 
findings concerning the innate antiviral properties of pDC left open the question of how 
pDC are differentially recruited to CD8+ T cell priming sites and what possible functions 
they exert in support of T cell activation and adaptive immune responses.
CCR5 guides pDC to CD8+ T cell priming sites
On the assumption that chemokines also direct pDC towards sites of CD8+ T cell priming by 
antigen-bearing cDC, we first sought to determine if virus-induced inflammatory signals 
played a role in this colocalization phenomenon or if the relevant signals arose from the 
interacting T cells and cDC. For this purpose, we designed an in vivo system that activates 
CD8+ T cells, yet lacks virus-associated inflammatory cues. Labeled OT-I T cells were 
transferred into pDC reporter mice that were then immunized with LPS-free OVA. T cell and 
pDC behavior was then visualized in these animals. Similar to what we observed during 
viral infection, pDC colocalized with the arrested OT-I T cells, forming large cellular 
aggregates (Figure S4A, S4B). This indicated that T cell- or cDC-derived rather than virus-
promoted signals might lead to pDC recruitment to T cell priming sites. Besides CXCR3, 
CCR5 is highly and homogenously expressed on pDC and plays an important role for pDC 
transmigration through inflamed vessels (Diacovo et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2012). CCR5 
interacts with CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, chemokines that are produced by activated T cells 
(Dorner et al., 2002) and that prior studies showed played a key role in cell – cell 
interactions involved in the generation of cell-mediated immune responses (Castellino et al., 
2006; Hugues et al., 2007). Indeed, we found a strong increase in CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 in 
LN homogenates 8hrs after infection with MVA OVA (Figure 4A, 4B). To assess the role of

 CCR5 in intranodal migration of pDC, we crossed CCR5-deficient animals to pDC reporter 
mice and visualized pDC behavior in vivo upon viral infection using IVM. In CCR5-
deficient mice, pDC were not found at OT-I T cell clusters (Figure 4C, 4D and Movie S5). 
Similarly to MVA infection, we detected a CCR5-dependent accumulation of pDC around 
OT-I T cell clusters in the context of a low dose VSV OVA infection (Figure S4C–E).
When we visualized pDC after MVA infection in CXCR3-deficient mice, focusing on the 
CD8+ T cell priming sites, we found a significantly enhanced recruitment of pDC that 
formed groups of up to about 60 cells interacting with the OT-I T cell cluster (Figure 4C, 4E, 
4G and Movie S6). However, this enhanced recruitment may be simply based on the 
increased numbers of pDC present in CXCR3-deficient mice (Figure S3B). The steady state 
distribution and migrational speed of pDC in skin-draining LNs was unaltered in the absence 
or presence of CCR5 or CXCR3 (Figure S3C, S4F).
We have previously shown that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are initially activated separately on 
distinct cDC (Eickhoff et al., 2015). Therefore, we wanted to address whether pDC are 
relocalized to and interacted with activated CD4+ T cells and if so whether this process was 
also CCR5-dependent. To this end we transferred TCR transgenic CD4+ T cells (SMARTA) 
into pDC reporter mice and infected them with MVA GP (glycoprotein from LCMV). Eight 
hours after infection we observed CD4+ T cell clusters in the paracortex, in deeper areas of 
the LN than observed for their CD8+ T cell counterparts. Importantly, we did not detect 
large pDC superclusters around activated CD4+ T cells, arguing that pDC are more 
effectively recruited towards activated CD8+ T cells (Figure S4G). However, CD4+ T cell 
clusters consisted of fewer T cells than CD8+ T cell clusters and some pDC did accumulate 
adjacent to CD4+ T cell clusters (Figure S4H and S4I). Therefore, quantitative (number of 
cells producing a chemokine) rather than qualitative differences (selective chemokine 
production by CD8+ vs. CD4+ T cells) may be the basis for the observed differences. To 
gain further insight into this issue, we stimulated purified naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 
the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and probed the supernatant 
for CCL3 using ELISA. Eight hours after activation we detected a robust amount of CCL3 
in the supernatant of CD8+ T cell cultures (Figure 4H). In contrast, we failed to detect CCL3 
in CD4+ T cell cultures. Importantly, the extent of activation as measured by CD69 
upregulation was comparable in both cultures (Figure 4H). These results are in line with a 
predominant recruitment of pDC to CD8+ rather than to CD4+ T cell priming sites based on 
selective production of CCL3 by CD8+ T cells. Prior studies showed that the interaction of 
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells with antigen-bearing cDC led to local generation of a 
combination of CCL3 and CCL4, suggesting that T cell induction of chemokine production 
by cDC could account for the less robust but measurable in vivo recruitment of pDC to 
antigen-driven CD4+ T cell clusters (Castellino et al., 2006).
To further examine whether CCL3 and CCL4 were the critical chemokines leading to the 
recruitment of pDC to CD8+ T cell activation sites, we blocked CCL3 and CCL4 signals in 
vivo using neutralizing antibodies (Castellino et al., 2006) and analyzed the migratory 
behavior of pDC upon viral infection in the presence of OT-I T cells. Such treatment 
significantly reduced the numbers of pDC at CD8+ T cell priming sites as compared to what 
was observed in animals treated with isotype control antibodies (Figure 4I–K). Overall, our

 results are in line with the interpretation that CCR5 instructs specific recruitment of pDC 
towards CD8+ T cell priming sites, where CCL3 and CCL4 are secreted by activated CD8+ 
T cells and likely their interacting cDC.
IFN I signaling involving cDC is critical for optimization of the antiviral CD8+ T cell 
response
Having established how pDC are recruited to CD8+ T cell priming sites, we next examined 
how the presence of pDC contributed to enhancing the CD8+ T cell response. The central 
function of pDC appears to be their capacity to produce high amounts of IFN I upon viral 
infection (Haeryfar, 2005). However, after depletion of pDC we did not observe a reduction 
in the total IFNα response in the draining LN 8hrs after infection (Figure 5A). To assess 
whether IFN I was critical for pDC function in our experimental system, we crossed 
Clec4c+/DTR mice with Ifnar1−/− animals. When analyzing the immune response on d8 after 
infection with MVA OVA, we found no significant differences regarding the antigen-specific 
CD8+ T cell response when comparing Ifnar1−/− animals that did or did not have a pDC 
population (Figure 5B–E and S5A–D). The loss of the augmenting effect of pDC in 
Ifnar1−/− mice indicated that IFN I is critical for pDC function in our experimental model. 
Together with our results that pDC do not substantially alter the total amount of IFNα in the 
LN (Figure 5A), we conclude that pDC derived IFN I acts locally on the interacting cellular 
partners. To identify the cell population(s) on which IFN I is acting to optimize CD8+ T cell 
priming, we first analyzed mice that specifically lack IFNAR1 on T cells (Cd4-cre x 
Ifnar1flox/flox) and compared them to their WT littermates. In four independent experiments, 
we consistently observed a slightly reduced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response among 
the IFNAR1-negative T cells (Figure 5F, 5H and S5E–H). However, the statistical analyses 
of the pooled data sets did not show significant differences (Figure 5G, 5I). While these 
results indicate some contribution of direct IFN I signaling in CD8+ T cells to the effects 
mediated by pDC, this mechanism can only partially account for the differences we 
observed when removing the pDC compartment (Figure 1). Therefore, we speculated that 
pDC-derived IFN I might additionally act on cDC to optimize their function. To address this 
hypothesis, we analyzed mice that specifically lack IFNAR1 on DC (Itgax-cre x 
Ifnar1flox/flox). In such animals, there was a substantially reduced CD8+ T cell response on 
d8 post immunization in comparison to their WT littermates (Figure 5J–M, S5I–L). This 
result pointed to a critical role of IFN I in optimizing DC functionality.
pDC locally cooperate with cross-presenting XCR1+ DC via IFN I
Given the physical proximity among pDC, CD8+ T cells and infected cDC within 
multicellular clusters, we first analyzed the expression of costimulatory molecules on 
infected cDC in the presence or absence of IFN I signaling. We infected Itgax-cre x 
Ifnar1flox/flox and control littermates i.v. with MVA GFP and analyzed the expression of 
CD80, CD86 and CD40 on infected GFP+ cDC 8hrs later. These analyses did not reveal any 
significant differences in the expression of costimulatory molecules on infected DC in the 
presence or absence of IFN I signaling (Figure 6A). To test whether the IFN I might act on 
non-infected cDC, we isolated splenic cDC 36h after infection, identified them by surface 
marker expression (XCR1 vs. CD11b) and analyzed the expression pattern of costimulatory 
molecules. This revealed a striking reduction in CD40, CD80 and in particular CD86

 expression on XCR1+ DC but not CD11b DC, if IFNAR1 was absent on cDC (Figure 6B, 
6C). To determine if this finding was related to pDC function, we depleted pDC, infected the 
animals and analyzed the expression of costimulatory markers on splenic DC 36h later. 
Again, we detected a significant reduction of CD80 and CD86 expression on XCR1+ DC in 
pDC-depleted as compared to non-depleted control animals (Figure 6D, 6E). These data 
indicated that pDC-derived IFN I acted selectively on XCR1+ DC rather than CD11b+ DC. It 
is well established that XCR1+ DC are of particular importance for cross-presentation of 
viral antigens and also serve as a platform that allows interaction with both antigen-specific 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for optimal T cell programming and memory formation in the 
context of viral infections (Bachem et al., 2012; Eickhoff et al., 2015; Hor et al., 2015). 
Since MVA does not replicate and therefore heavily depends on cross-presentation for CD8+ 
T cell priming (Gasteiger et al., 2007), we investigated the role of XCR1+ DC in MVA-
induced CD8+ T cell responses. Indeed, the CD8+ T cell response directed against the 
immunodominant viral epitope (B8R20) was strongly impaired if XCR1+ DC were depleted, 
confirming the critical role of this DC subset for generating functional CD8+ T cell 
responses (Figure S6A–H). To further analyze whether XCR1+ DC functionality was 
enhanced by pDC, we probed the capacity of XCR1+ DC to drive OT-I T cell proliferation in 
the presence or absence of pDC. As we previously demonstrated, the initial activation of 
CD8+ T cells after vaccinia virus infection is independent of cross-presenting XCR1+ DC, 
but is driven by infected DC, predominantly the CD11b DC subset (Eickhoff et al., 2015). 
To discriminate between these two populations (infected DC vs. cross-presenting XCR1+ 
DC), we transferred labeled OT-I T cells 60h after infection and analyzed the proliferation 
profile three days later. At this time point post infection, infected cDC had largely died and 
been cleared, therefore antigen-presentation is dominated by cross-presenting XCR1+ DC 
(Eickhoff et al., 2015; Gasteiger et al., 2007). As expected, depletion of XCR1+ DC largely 
abrogated OT-I proliferation in vivo in this time-frame as compared to control animals 
(Figure S6I, S6J). In a similar experimental set-up using dye labelled OT-I GFP T cells, pDC 
depletion also led to a significantly reduced OT-I proliferation in vivo as compared to non-
depleted animals (Figure 6F, 6G). To look for a link between these data and the requirement 
for CCR5 in directing pDC to CD8 priming sites, we analyzed the proliferation of WT OT-I 
T cells in CCR5-deficient hosts. Similar to pDC-depleted animals, OT-I T cells proliferated 
significantly less in CCR5-deficient hosts (Figure 6F, 6G). Taken together, these results 
indicate that pDC-derived IFN I directly or indirectly activates XCR1+ DC to optimize the 
expression of costimulatory molecules and their ability to activate CD8+ T cells via cross-
presentation.
Activated CD8 T cells recruit XCR1+ DC via XCL1
To better understand where and when pDC provided XCR1+ DC with IFN I-dependent 
stimulation, we analyzed the migration and localization of XCR1+ DC after infection with 
MVA. In the steady state, XCR1+ DC were dispersed throughout the paracortex and the 
interfollicular area of the LN, with some XCR1+ DC located within the subcapsular sinus 
(Kitano et al., 2016) (Figure 7A). Importantly, after infection we found that XCR1+ DC 
accumulated around OT-I T cell clusters in a pattern similar to that of recruited pDC, 
creating a new microenvironment around the initial site of CD8+ T cell engagement with 
antigen-presenting cDC (Figure 7B, 7C, 7F, 7G and Movie S7). Upon activation XCL1 is

 rapidly expressed by CD8+ T cells (Dorner et al., 2002), therefore we speculated that this 
chemokine could be critically involved in the reorganization of the XCR1+ DC network 
observed after infection. To address this, we transferred OT-I cells into XCR1venus/venus mice 
that lacked functional XCR1 expression, infected them with MVA OVA and analyzed LN 
sections 10hrs later. As anticipated, we did not observe a substantial cluster formation of 
XCR1+ DC in XCR1-deficient animals (Figure 7D, 7F, 7G). To test whether CD8+ T cell 
derived XCL1 is critical for XCR1+ DC recruitment, we transferred Xcl1−/− OT-I T cells 
into XCR+/venus mice and analyzed the XCR1+ DC localization 10hrs after infection. We 
observed a significant reduction in the spatial correlation between XCR1+ DC and clustered 
Xcl1−/− OT-I T cells as compared to WT OT-I T cells (Figure 7E–G). To further investigate 
the migrational behavior of XCR1+ DC, we visualized this cell population in vivo shortly 
after T cell cluster formation. Using this approach, we found in vivo evidence for direct 
migration of XCR1+ DC towards clustered OT-I T cells supporting the notion of chemokine 
based attraction of XCR1+ DC (Figure 7H and Movie S8).
In summary, we conclude that XCR1+ DC are recruited to CD8+ T cell priming sites 
allowing them to interact with pDC but also with infected cDC that are localized in the 
middle of the cluster of T cells. This positioning and exposure to IFN I provides XCR1+ DC 
with a microenvironment that provides local access to cell-associated viral proteins once the 
initially infected DC undergoes cell death, thereby optimizing cross-presentation, maturation 
and productive second phase interactions with already activated CD8+ T cells.
Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of pDC to address when and where 
pDC-derived IFN I supports innate and adaptive immunity during viral infection. We found 
that pDC are directed towards two different sites in the LN as a consequence of selective and 
possibly competing chemokine receptor engagement. In particular, CXCL9 and CXCL10 
interaction with CXCR3 directs pDC to subcapsular and medullary macrophages. It seems 
intuitive that this translocation to sites of viral infection may be essential to suppress viral 
replication, although we did not find direct evidence to support this notion. Whether 
CXCR3-mediated pDC migration serves another function or indeed supports the antiviral 
function of pDC, but was masked in our experimental setting due to an increase in pDC 
density within the LN, needs to be further tested.
The second area of pDC accumulation involves the priming sites of CD8+ T cells in the LN, 
which is the focus of this study. The critical chemokines are CCL3 and CCL4 that are 
produced in the context of antigen-dependent CD8+ T cell activation and engage CCR5 to 
direct pDC towards such initial sites of CD8+ T cell priming. The resulting accumulation of 
pDC around activated CD8+ T cells is likely a combination of chemotactic and adhesive 
cues. In this study, we have provided evidence for direct interaction between pDC and 
activated CD8+ T cells, which does not require cognate antigen-presentation by pDC. 
Similarly, pDC may interact with the infected cDC that activated naïve CD8+ T cells 
initially. This may be critical for pDC to sense viral infections and lead to release of IFN I, 
given that we did not find any evidence for direct infection of pDC. Besides pDC, we also 
detected a rapid recruitment of XCR1+ DC towards the activated XCL1-producing CD8+ T

 cells, creating a new microenvironment around the initial site of CD8+ T cell activation. 
Within this microenvironment, pDC-derived IFN I can act on CD8+ T cells as a signal 3 
cytokines and perhaps more importantly on XCR1+ DC to optimize their maturation, 
costimulatory capacity, and ability to cross-present viral antigens. This in turn contributes to 
maximizing the fraction of the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell repertoire recruited into the 
immune response and/or the extent of proliferation of that cohort of CD8+ T cells 
encountering TCR ligand.
Taking these findings together, we propose a concept in which T cells that could locate rare 
antigen-bearing DC early during an infection become the nucleus of a new 
microenvironment that is actively created by signals emitted in response to the initial CD8+ 
T cell – APC interaction. Thus, rather than having to continue to search for the cells 
necessary to optimize their response, this mechanism permits each CD8+ T cell that locates a 
useful antigen-presenting cell to accumulate needed accessory cells at this existing site of 
activation, supporting a robust response without the risk of missing the right partner cells 
during further T cell migration within the lymphoid tissue.
XCR1+ DC, beyond their critical function to cross-present viral antigens, also serve as an 
essential platform to transmit CD4+ T cell-dependent signals to CD8+ T cells (Eickhoff et 
al., 2015; Hor et al., 2015). Chemokines, particularly CCL3 and CCL4, optimize cellular 
encounters between cDC, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells (Castellino et al., 2006; Hugues et al., 
2007). In our previous work we have shown that CD4+ T cell – cDC interactions lead to 
CCL3 and CCL4 production, which is critical to recruitment of activated CD8+ T cells for 
the delivery of helper signals (Castellino et al., 2006). Given our data, the likely cellular 
source of CCL3 in those prior experiments was cDC rather than CD4+ T cells. Several lines 
of evidence argue that activated rather than naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are exchanging 
helper signals (Eickhoff et al., 2015; Jusforgues-Saklani et al., 2008). Activated T cells 
typically have short-term rather than long-term interactions with cDC (Mempel et al., 2004; 
Miller et al., 2004; Stoll et al., 2002). Therefore, it makes sense to induce chemokine 
production by licensed DC to optimize CD8+ T cell recruitment for the delivery of help 
rather than having the source of these chemokines be CD4+ T cells that may have 
disengaged the licensed DC before CD8+ T cell recruitment. This is in line with a 
consecutive rather than simultaneous interaction model for the delivery of helper signals for 
CD8+ T cells (Ridge et al., 1998).
An important aspect of our study is the unraveling of how and where pDC cooperate with 
cDC to support adaptive immunity. Our data indicate pDC – XCR1+ DC cooperativity early 
after viral infection within T cell priming hubs. This is in line with previous studies 
demonstrating that pDC only provide IFN I early after viral infection (Swiecki et al., 2010). 
In our study, pDC do not seem to present antigen, but do promote cross-presentation by 
colocalized XCR1+ DC. Additionally, they optimize the maturation of these DC subset as 
shown by an upregulation of CD86, which is the critical costimulatory molecule for priming 
CD8+ T cells in the context of vaccinia virus infections (Salek-Ardakani et al., 2009). It is 
important to point out that while in our model IFN I is critical, pDC might also support 
adaptive immune responses through the production of other mediators such as IL-12 
(Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001).

 The importance of pDC and XCR1+ DC relocalization in carrying out their specific 
functions as shown here provides strong evidence that the capacity of pDC and XCR1+ DC 
to rapidly migrate within lymphoid tissues is a key aspect of their physiological function. 
Our data further support a concept in which in the initial CD8+ T cell – APC interaction is 
critical for the reorganization of the DC network, allowing for optimal cellular interactions 
and cooperativity to maximize CD8+ T cell priming. With our information about the 
spatiotemporal behavior of pDC and XCR1+ DC in LN during viral infections and the 
dissection of the molecular signals guiding such migration, we provide a framework for 
considering how to harness these cell populations to maximize cellular immunity in the 
context of vaccination.
Experimental Procedures
Animals
Mice were purchased from Jackson or Janvier Labs or maintained at in-house facilities. All 
mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions at an Association for Assessment 
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited animal facility. All procedures 
were approved by the NIAID Animal Care and Use Committee (National Institutes of 
Health, Bethesda, MD) and the North Rhine-Westphalia State Environment Agency (LUA 
NRW), respectively. For details on mouse strains see supplementary information.
Treatment of mice
For depletion of pDC, transgenic mice and control littermates were treated with 0.1 μg DTX 
i.p. (Merck Millipore) on d-2, d-1, d0, d1, d2, d3 (for analysis at d8), on d-2, d-1, d0 (for 
analysis 8h p.i.) and on d-2, d-1, d0, d1 i.p. (for analysis 36h p.i.), respectively. For depletion 
of XCR1+ DC, transgenic mice and control littermates were treated with 0.5 μg DTX i.p. 
(Merck Millipore) on d-1, d0 and d1. For chemokine neutralization, chemokine blocking 
antibodies or isotype matched controls were injected i.v. at the time of infection (R&D; 
CCL3: AF-450-NA, MAB450-100; CCL4: AF-451-NA, MAB451-100; Isotype matched 
controls: AB-108-C, MAB006) (Castellino et al., 2006). For immunization with LPS-free 
OVA (Hyglos), 50 μg were injected into the footpad, pLN were harvested 8h after injection.
Viral Infections
105 PFU VSV OVA or 106-108 IU MVA OVA GFP, MVA OVA tdTomato, MVA OVA or 
MVA WT were diluted in PBS and injected in the footpad (foothock (Kamala, 2007)), or 
intravenously.
Adoptive T cell transfer
OT-I, SMARTA or polyclonal CD8+ T cells were sorted using a MACS CD4+ or CD8+ T 
cell negative selection kit (Miltenyi) combined with biotinylated anti-CD44 (IM7, BD 
Biosciences). 2–4x106 cells were transferred i.v.
