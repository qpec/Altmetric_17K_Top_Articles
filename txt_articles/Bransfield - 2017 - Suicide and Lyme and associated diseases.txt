Purpose: The aim of this paper is to investigate the association between suicide and Lyme 
and associated diseases (LAD). No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive 
assessment of this subject.
Introduction: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association 
between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both 
with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated 
proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and 
glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology 
occurs in LAD.
Method: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed.
Results: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who 
were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with 
multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive 
images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, 
panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance 
abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital–urinary symptoms, chronic pain, 
anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative 
attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute 
to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD 
suicides in the US per year.
Conclusion: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously 
unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting 
in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about 
LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple 
debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater under-
standing and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that 
medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological 
organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.

Plain language summary
Currently, there are over 40,000 well-documented and many more undocumented suicides in 
the US each year, and many are unexplained. A number of infectious diseases, and in particular 
chronic infectious diseases, have also been associated with suicide. This article analyzes the asso-
ciation between suicide and Lyme and associated diseases (LAD). Based upon the medical litera-
ture demonstrating the physiology associated with suicide, a chart review, and epidemiological 
calculations, it was demonstrated there is a causal relationship between LAD and suicide, and 
the pathophysiology of LAD can be explained and it causes a significant number of suicides. 
LAD causes immune effects, biochemical changes, and a number of psychiatric symptoms 
that contribute to suicidal risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over

1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year. Greater understanding and 
a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed.
Introduction
contributors and deterrents of suicide
Suicide is a major and potentially preventable health prob-
lem needing greater attention. It is the result of an interaction 
of multiple known and unknown contributors, deterrents, and 
acute triggers. Some of the well-recognized contributors to 
suicide include anhedonia, depression, psychosis, substance 
abuse, bipolar illness, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress 
disorder, obsessiveness, anxiety, agitation, impulsivity, 
aggressiveness, depersonalization, rigidity, narcissism, bor-
derline personality, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, 
repression, lack of outlets for frustration, sexual issues, 
boundary issues, other mental conditions, chronic pain, dis-
ability, neurological impairments, chronic medical problems, 
infections, immune reactions, genetic vulnerabilities, social 
isolation, adverse life events, abusive relationship(s), family 
dysfunction, family substance abuse, family mental illness, 
separation or divorce, exposure to trauma, abusive develop-
ment (ie, child abuse or neglect), family history of mental 
illness or suicide, incarceration, legal problems, financial 
distress, prior suicide attempts, high crime rates and other 
broader community conditions, limited access to health 
and social services, and easy access by persons at risk to 
lethal means (ie, 90-day supplies of medication or unlocked 
firearm).1,2 Acute triggering events can include window of 
fear, exposure to the suicidal behavior of others, acute sleep 
deprivation, alcohol and/or drug intoxication or withdrawal, 
recent rejection, loss, embarrassment or failure, “intimate 
partner problems, physical health conditions, financial chal-
lenges, and legal problems”.3 Deterrents to suicide include 
mental fitness, frustration tolerance, cognitive abilities, 
coping skills, parenthood, supportive relationships, com-
munity and other social connections, purpose, ethical and 
religious beliefs, good medical and neurological health, and 
access to social services and psychiatric and medical care.4
Understanding suicidality requires a very complex formula 
and is associated with many different sequential events, con-
tributors, deterrents, and acute triggers which are both known 
and unknown. While acknowledging the significance of all of 
these other components to suicidality, the scope of this article 
shall specifically focus upon suicide and (LAD).
epidemiological statistics
Suicide is a major public health concern; however, suicide 
statistics are significantly underreported. Suicidality statistics 
include those with suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans, suicidal 
attempts, self-harm injuries, and completed suicides. The 
2014 US statistics show 9.3 million (3.9%) have suicidal 
thoughts, 2.7 million (1.1%) made a plan, 1.3 million (0.6%) 
attempted suicide, 494,169 visited a hospital for self-harm 
injuries, and 42,773 completed suicide.5 A number of ratios 
are established which include 13/100,000 commit suicide 
per year, there are 25 attempts for every completed sui-
cide, 12 people harm themselves for every completed 
suicide, and 0.3% of those with suicidal thoughts commit 
suicide per year.5
Based upon the CDC research, there are at least 
329,000 cases of Lyme disease diagnosed per year, mostly 
in children and middle-age adults, but only 25,000–40,000 
per year meet their Surveillance Case Definition.6 According 
to the CDC, “Surveillance Case Definitions establish uniform 
criteria for disease reporting and should not be used as the 
sole criteria for establishing clinical diagnoses.”7
Diagnosing laD
Any diagnosis is based upon a thorough clinical examina-
tion combined with physician judgment, and Lyme disease 
is no exception. Clinical practice guidelines may provide 
additional assistance. The US Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality maintains the National Guideline 
Clearinghouse and works closely with the Institute of 
Medicine to maintain standards for trustworthy evidence-
based clinical practice guidelines which can assist with 
diagnosis.8 In the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the 
only guidelines specifically addressing Lyme disease are 
the ILADS Guidelines (2014), but the American Psychiatric 
Association Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evalu-
ation of Adults (2016) are also listed.8–10 These guidelines 
recognize the value of a thorough clinical exam, mental 
status exam, pattern recognition, and clinical judgment, 
and the ILADS guidelines discuss laboratory assessment 
in determining the diagnosis.9,10
Although not currently recognized in the National 
Guideline Clearinghouse, many turn to the Infectious Dis-
eases Society of America (IDSA) Lyme disease guidelines 
(2006) for guidance in diagnosing Lyme disease.11 The 
IDSA guidelines also recognize the value of a thorough 
clinical, laboratory assessment and physician judgment. 
They have a disclosure stating guidelines “are not intended 
to supplement physician judgment”; adherence to them 
are voluntary and their application is to be determined by 
the physician while recognizing “each patient’s individual 
circumstances”.11

suicide and lyme and associated diseases
For diagnosis, there are many similarities between the 
ILADS and IDSA guidelines, and a comprehensive clinical 
assessment is essential.
In addition to Borrelia burgdorferi, a number of other 
tick-borne coinfections, and secondary opportunistic infec-
tions, may also be diagnosed, which explains using the 
term “and associated diseases”.9,11 B. burgdorferi may be 
diagnosed as a persistent infection with immune suppressant 
and evasive capabilities,12 or there may be a postinfectious 
process. In either case, the psychiatric symptoms are associ-
ated with an immune-mediated process.13–17
citations addressing suicide and laD
Currently, there are over 340 peer-reviewed international 
journal articles documenting psychiatric symptoms associ-
ated with LAD.18 Although some patients may have no, or 
minimal, symptoms following a tick bite, others develop 
significant symptoms over time, including a broad spectrum 
of psychiatric impairments, such as the development of 
suicidal risk.19 Combined homicide and suicide have also 
occurred.20 In a prior presentation, homicidal tendencies 
occurred in about 15% of late-stage Lyme/tick-borne dis-
ease patients, and most of these patients also had suicidal 
tendencies.21 No journal article has ever before performed 
a comprehensive assessment of the association between 
LAD and suicide.
Fourteen case reports in the international literature 
describe patients who became suicidal after acquiring 
LAD.22–35 Fourteen additional citations recognize the 
causal association between suicide and LAD.15,16,36–47 One 
article reviewed the clinical course of 57 patients diag-
nosed with Lyme disease and documented four suicide 
attempts in the 57 patients.48 Five articles recognized that 
suicidality associated with LAD has an immune-mediated 
pathophysiology.13,15,28,31,40
Suicide as well as depression, anxiety, brain fog, para-
noia, loss of mental capacities, and other mental symptoms 
were also reported to be associated with the Lyme vaccine 
clinical trial. The Adverse Event Reporting System described 
a 43-year-old man who committed suicide seven months 
after receiving the vaccine who described severe pain and 
an inability “to get relief from 14 different doctors he had 
seen”.29,49
Depression is a well-recognized contributor towards 
suicidal risk. In the general population, there is a 16.2% 
lifetime prevalence and a 6.6% prior 12-month prevalence.50 
Although depression is not prevalent in the early stages of 
LAD in patients who are diagnosed and treated early and 
effectively,51 in the later stages of LAD, the prevalence of 
depression is significantly higher with findings of 37%,52 
37%,53 50%,54 51%,55 64%,56 47% (mood swings),57 and 
80% (with intrusive symptoms).28 Intrusive symptoms can 
also contribute to causing suicide and violence, and 34% of 
patients with a history of LAD acquire intrusive symptoms.28 
Among these patients, 69% become suicidal, while 31% 
develop homicidal tendencies.28
A survey of a patient support group concluded hope-
lessness by lack of educated doctors, isolation, debilitating 
symptoms, depression caused by Lyme disease, feeling like 
a burden, and watching our friends die contributed to suicidal 
feeling in patients with LAD.58
environmental exposure and suicide
Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers, in particu-
lar forestry workers, and veterans.59–63 Recent studies 
demonstrated the rate of suicide was highest among 
persons working in the farming, fishing, and forestry 
group (84.5/100,000), while the lowest rate was found 
in the education, training, and library occupational group 
(7.5/100,000).64,65 While tick-borne disease exposure could 
be a contributor to those working in farming and forestry, 
it might not explain the high rate in fisherman.66 Veterans 
can be at risk for tick-borne diseases from exposure during 
basic training and deployment; however, other causes of 
suicidality must also be considered, such as family disrup-
tion from deployment, being trained to kill, toxic exposure, 
and trauma.67
infections increasing suicidality
Sickness syndrome is a well-recognized response to infec-
tion and is associated with anhedonia and depression, both 
of which are associated with suicidal risk.68 A number of 
infections have been associated with suicide including 
influenza, coronaviruses, cytomegalovirus, HIV/AIDS, 
Toxoplasma gondii, and hepatitis C. Latent infection with 
T. gondii is a prevalent condition that has been linked in 
humans to suicide and suicide attempts. T. gondii titers may 
quantify a proneness to suicidal behavior. In a sample of 
20 European nations, the prevalence of T. gondii was posi-
tively associated with national suicide rates, and T. gondii 
seropositivity was associated with a sevenfold greater risk 
of self-directed violence.69–74
The Danish nationwide register studies demonstrate a 
strong correlation between infections requiring hospitaliza-
tion and suicide. In one study, hospitalization for COPD 
was associated with a significantly increased risk for

suicide.75 Another study looked at all infections requiring 
hospitalization and demonstrated an increased risk of dying 
by suicide was found among people with hospital contacts 
with infections. The relative risk of suicide was increased 
among individuals with any hospitalization with infections 
by 42% compared with individuals without prior infection; 
the greater the number of hospital contacts for infections 
and days spent in treatment, the greater the risk of death 
by suicide. The authors said “The highest risks of suicide 
were found among individuals with hepatitis infection and 
HIV/AIDS infection” and “It will be important to understand 
how milder and long-term infections contribute to depres-
sion and suicidality. Such infections often go untreated and 
remain latent in the body for years.”76
Psychoimmunology of suicide
The infectious disease and suicide association is mediated 
by cytokine and other immune effects. Infections impact 
CNS functioning by provoking cytokines that “can modulate 
the concentration of monoaminergic neurotransmitters and 
their metabolites in various regions of the CNS”.77 There 
is a significant body of research demonstrating a strong 
association between inflammation, brain inflammation, 
elevated cytokine levels, and suicide.78–80 “Most suicide 
attempters, or subjects with suicidal ideation, show an 
imbalance in the immune system.”81 Interferon treatment 
for hepatitis C has been a clinical model demonstrating the 
significance of inflammation-mediated mental symptoms 
including suicide.82 Cytokine activation has been associated 
with both suicide and self-harm behavior.83 “IL-6 is elevated 
in the cerebrospinal fluid of suicide attempters and related 
to symptom severity.”84 The brains of suicide victims had 
significantly increased microgliosis, which demonstrates the 
presence of brain inflammation, compared to subjects who 
died from other causes.85 “Increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6 
and TNF-α were shown in the anterior prefrontal cortex of 
teenage suicide victims.”86 “Suicidal ideation was signifi-
cantly associated with an elevated inflammatory index of 
C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, in patients with 
depression.”87 A meta-analysis on inflammation in suicidal 
patients demonstrated “there are aberrant cytokine levels 
in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain 
samples from suicidal patients. The levels of IL-1β and IL-6 
were most robustly associated with suicidality, and these 
cytokines may help distinguish suicidal from non-suicidal 
patients.”88 In summary, conditions that cause brain inflam-
mation can contribute significantly to suicidality. Lyme 
disease has been associated with the same proinflammatory 
cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 that are associated with 
suicide.89
laD psychoimmunology and suicide
There are multiple known and unknown mechanisms by 
which B. burgdorferi causes immune-mediated neuronal 
dysfunction resulting in clinical symptoms. Although 
some symptoms may be associated with infection within 
the brain or in the brain vasculature, infection in the 
periphery can also provoke significant immune activity that 
crosses the blood–brain barrier.13 These immune-mediated 
effects include activation of proinflammatory cytokines and 
increases in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, 
interferon-gamma, neopterin, C-reactive protein, surface 
lipoprotein E, and the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, 
release of proinflammatory lipoproteins from the outer 
coat of B. burgdorferi, immune effects from the flagella of 
B. burgdorferi, immune effects from outer surface protein A 
of B. burgdorferi inducing apoptosis and astrogliosis, 
autoimmune effects, direct cytotoxicity by proximity of 
B. burgdorferi to neurons and adherence to and invasion of 
neurons, interactions with Schwann and glial cells producing 
nitric oxide, the spirochetes locally inducing cytokines such 
as IL-6 or TNF-α in glial cells, the secretion of cytotoxic 
substances by leucocytes and glial cells contributing to 
damage of oligodendrocytes that are vital for the functioning 
and survival of neurons, and other immune effects from the 
other known and unknown coinfections and opportunistic 
infections.13,17 In addition, metabolic pathophysiological 
changes are also associated with altered tryptophan metabo-
lism, increases in quinolinic acid, oxidative stress, excitotox-
icity, and changes in homocysteine metabolism.13,17,90
Inflammatory-mediated changes in 
tryptophan metabolism, quinolinic acid, 
and glutamate
The effects of inflammation on mood and behavior could 
partially be mediated by the effects upon tryptophan 
metabolism, kynurenine pathway metabolites, and glutamate 
neurotransmission. Inflammation increases indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase which shifts tryptophan metabolism away from 
serotonin and melatonin towards an increase of quinolinic 
acid. Quinolinic acid correlates significantly with guilt, 
and the ratio of quinolinic acid/3-hydroxykynurenine cor-
relates significantly with guilt and psychomotor agitation.91 
Quinolinic acid levels also correlate with increased suicidal 
risk.92 High cerebrospinal fluid quinolinic acid levels corre-
late with high suicidal intent.93 Quinolinic acid levels have

suicide and lyme and associated diseases
been demonstrated to be continuously elevated in the patients 
who had suicide attempts, and the levels were highest in close 
proximity to the attempt.94 Quinolinic acid is an NMDA 
receptor agonist which leads to an excess of calcium influx 
into neurons. Quinolinic acid levels are increased, while 
kynurenic acid, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is decreased 
in suicidal patients which supports a role for a glutamatergic 
mechanism in suicidality. Severe depression is associated 
with increased microglial quinolinic acid in subregions of the 
anterior cingulate gyrus and the anterior midcingulate cortex 
compared to controls.95 Quinolinic acid in cerebrospinal 
fluid is increased in a number of chronic infections includ-
ing B. burgdorferi infections and correlates with “symptom 
severity” and “pathological potential”.96,97
altered neural circuits increasing 
suicidality
Decreased structural and functional connectivity in the 
amygdala–prefrontal neural system impairs emotional 
regulation and is associated with increased suicide risk.98 The 
cingulate cortex is known to recruit other brain regions in 
response to conflict.99 Brain regions and circuits associated 
with impulsive aggressiveness and self-directed aggressive-
ness involve an interaction between the orbital frontal cortex, 
the anterior cingulate cortex, and the amygdala. The orbital 
frontal cortex is significant in restraining impulsive outbursts, 
while the anterior cingulate cortex coordinates other brain 
regions in response to conflict. The amygdala is involved in 
fear response and other aversive emotions. In impulse-prone 
individuals, there is decreased activity in the orbital frontal 
cortex and/or anterior cingulate combined with normal or 
increased activity of the amygdala which demonstrates how 
these two restraining brain regions are not adequately coun-
teracting the fear response when something is perceived and 
threatening and this can result in explosive and impulsive 
behavior.100 It has been found that decreased white matter 
integrity and density in the superior longitudinal fasciculus is 
associated with intermittent explosive disorder.101 LAD has 
been associated with a predominately white matter enceph-
alopathy with white matter-processing impairments.102
Methods
A pilot study was performed to review clinical data. This 
consisted of a retrospective review of randomly selected 
inactive charts of patients with LAD from the author’s 
practice with their identity protected. These patients were 
evaluated with a comprehensive assessment including 
premorbid assessment, history of tick exposure, history of 
the presence of erythema migrans rash, early tick-borne 
disease symptoms, symptoms in the course of illness, and 
current status with a comprehensive neuropsychiatric and 
general medical assessment and review of systems using the 
280-item Neuropsychiatric Lyme Assessment with pattern 
recognition and a review of laboratory assessment, which 
may include enzyme-linked immune assay, immunofluo-
rescent assay, Western blot, DNA-based testing, coinfection 
testing, single-photon emission tomography, magnetic reso-
nance imaging, or other diagnostic testing to determine the 
diagnosis.8–11,103,104 Only testing from laboratories validated 
by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 
the US Department of Health and Human Services Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services was considered valid. 
Charts in which the diagnosis of Lyme disease was unclear 
were excluded from the study. The 253 charts that met the 
criteria were divided into four groups based upon symptoms – 
suicidal and homicidal, suicidal not homicidal, experiencing 
explosive anger not suicidal or homicidal, and not suicidal, 
homicidal, or experiencing explosive anger. The patients 
who were both suicidal and homicidal were considered to 
be the most severe cases, while the patients who were least 
severe were the patients who were not homicidal, suicidal, 
or experiencing explosive anger. Names were converted 
to an identifier before entering findings into a database of 
individual participant data. Clinical findings most relevant 
to the diagnosis and suicidal risk were analyzed. All 29 of 
the suicidal and homicidal charts were reviewed, and a rep-
resentative sample of 20 charts from the suicidal group was 
pulled at random from the suicidal but not homicidal group 
and 20 charts were pulled at random from the not suicidal, 
homicidal, or experiencing explosive anger group. A com-
parison of individual participant data is made by comparing 
the findings for all patients suicidal and homicidal (N=29) 
to the findings for those suicidal and not homicidal (N=20) 
and not homicidal or suicidal or experiencing explosive anger 
(N=20). The premorbid health status is the control for each 
group and is shown in parentheses in Figure 1. Symptoms 
associated with risk were ranked by comparing the prevalence 
of different findings among the three different groups. Two 
representative cases of suicidal LAD patients are described. 
In the case reviews, identifying information was removed to 
conceal identities. In the nonfatal case, written consent was 
obtained for publication. In the fatal case, written consent 
from the next of kin was obtained for publication.
Since there are no databases of LAD suicides, the 
prevalence can only be estimated indirectly by using CDC 
statistics of Lyme disease, calculating the percent with

persistent symptoms that occur each year, multiplying this 
number by the duration based on the medical literature, and 
multiplying this by the percent of patients with suicidal 
thoughts to determine the number of patients with Lyme 
disease and suicidal thoughts. The CDC statistics of the 
ratios of patients with suicidal thoughts to those who com-
pleted suicides were used to calculate the estimated number 
of patients with LAD and suicidal thoughts who completed 
suicide per year in the US.
The Meridian Health Institutional Review Board, Neptune, 
NJ, USA, approved this study (IRB # 201704192J), as 
exempted. Patient consent to review their medical records 
was not required as there was minimal risk to subjects, no 
subject identifiers or links to identifiers were used or col-
lected, and it was a retrospective chart review of already 
existing data. In the case reports, the next of kin of the 
deceased patient signed a consent to publish the case, and the 
patient who survived signed a consent to publish the case.
Results
chart review
A review of 253 inactive charts of patients with LAD (58% 
female, 42% male, age 8–64 years, average age 39 years) 
from the investigator’s practice demonstrated an average of 
8 years before diagnosis and initiating treatment for LAD. 
All of these patients met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis 
of LAD. Many had a history of erythema migrans rashes; 
all had objective clinical findings; most had laboratory 
confirmation and were tested positive for B. burgdorferi; 
some had findings demonstrated by single photon emission 
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or spinal 
taps, and most tested positive for a number of coinfections 
which included Babesia, Bartonella, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia 
chaffeensis, Rickettsia rickettsii, Epstein–Barr virus, cyto-
megalovirus, human herpesvirus-2, Mycoplasma pneumonia, 
Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and hepatitis C virus. The 
laboratory assessment of these patients was often performed 
before referral to the investigator.
Many patients fulfilled CDC Surveillance Case Defini-
tion, while in other patients, Surveillance Case Definition 
was not used as the sole criteria for establishing the clinical 
diagnosis.7 It is recognized Lyme disease Surveillance Case 
Definition based upon immune-based two-tier testing has a 
very low sensitivity (46%)105 and “generated over 500 times 
false-negative results than two stage HIV testing”.106 The 
limitations of this testing are understandable since two-tier 
Lyme testing is an immune-based test for a highly adap-
tive spirochete that is well known to suppress and evade 
the immune system.12,107,108 This also explains the disparity 
between the number of CDC Surveillance Case Definition 
cases and the actual cases of Lyme disease each year.6,7 
Comparing these two groups was not the purpose of this 
study; however, the only distinction that could be seen 
between these two groups in the clinical presentation was a 
higher prevalence of periostitis in the patients fulfilling CDC 
Surveillance Case Definition.

suicide and lyme and associated diseases
Of the 253 patients, 68% (N=172) were suicidal, homi-
cidal, and/or had explosive anger, while 32% (N=81) were 
nether suicidal and homicidal nor had explosive anger. On 
looking at the 172 patients in greater detail, 43% of the 
253 (N=110) were suicidal, 32% (N=81) were suicidal 
but not homicidal, and 11% (N=29) were both suicidal 
and homicidal. Moreover, none of the 253 patients were 
homicidal without also being suicidal, and 25% of the 
253 (N=62) had explosive anger but were neither suicidal 
nor homicidal (Figure 1).
Among the 109 patients who were suicidal, 26% (N=29) 
were also homicidal. A review of patients who were both 
suicidal and homicidal demonstrated an average of 8.4 years 
before diagnosis and initiating LAD treatment. Of all the 
patients, 10% had preexisting depression. After infection, 
97% of this group had depression. One patient (4%) had 
preexisting suicidal and homicidal tendencies, but the date 
of onset of the infection was unclear in this patient and may 
have preceded the onset of these symptoms.
In the chart review of LAD patients, a higher level 
of risk to self and others in the order of significance was 
associated with the presence of explosive anger, intrusive 
images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative epi-
sodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid 
cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, 
substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety dis-
order, genital–urinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, 
depression, low frustration tolerance, posttraumatic stress 
disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, cardiac symp-
toms, cognitive symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms, 
and fatigue, but not gastrointestinal symptoms, vegetative 
symptoms, pulmonary/upper respiratory symptoms, or neu-
rological symptoms (Table 1). Very few of these conditions 
were present in these patients before they were infected with 
LAD (Table 2).
case reviews
a patient who committed suicide
The patient was infected 10 years before being diagnosed 
with Lyme disease with coinfections with clinical symptoms 
and laboratory confirmation. Before diagnosis, there was a 
progressively increasing onset of multiple symptoms that 
included attention span impairments, executive dysfunction, 
sensory hyperacusis, memory impairments, slow processing, 
depersonalization, derealization, aggressive intrusive thoughts 
and images, dissociative episodes, illusions, hallucinations, 
decreased frustration tolerance, feeling overwhelmed, sudden 
abrupt mood swings, agitation, hypervigilance, paranoia, 
disinhibition, explosive anger, suicidal thoughts, guilt, sub-
stance abuse, crying spells, depression, anhedonia, apathy, 
panic attacks, agoraphobia, social anxiety, generalized 
anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, non-restorative sleep, 
anorexia, decreased libido, night sweats, headaches, cranial 
nerve symptoms, neuropathy, burning hands and feet, fatigue, 
weakness, tremors, twitching, myoclonic jerks, musculo-
skeletal symptoms, racing pulse, irritable gut, and spastic 
bladder. The patient had limited response to psychiatric 
treatments, and antibiotics resulted in extreme Jarisch–
Herxheimer reactions with increased severity of symptoms.

Bransfield
Some treatments were denied by the insurance company, and 
disability coverage was denied. The patient became increas-
ingly disabled and demoralized. After three failed attempts, 
a suicide plan that had been in place for an extended period 
of time was implemented.
a veteran who almost committed suicide
In the words of the patient,
I woke up on a beach out of the country with a bottle of 
scotch in one hand and my handgun in the other. I did not 
remember driving there. My doctor said I was in a psycho-
genic fugue state. My life was being destroyed by Lyme 
disease and no one had a clue. At work, I had been highly 
awarded throughout my career but it became a real struggle 
and I did not understand why. When I went to work that 
morning, I was tired, frustrated and in a state of dread and 
fear and I drove 100 miles past the base. I only drank a small 
amount of the scotch; the bottle was still nearly full. I have 
never been a big drinker and as a result I fell asleep on the 
beach. I woke up the next day wondering how I got there 
and why and drove back to the base and turned myself in 
for Away Without Leave (AWOL). After being diagnosed, 
treated and having recovered, I can relate to other veterans 
living with undiagnosed and untreated Lyme disease.
summarizing case review results
There are many patterns of suicide seen in LAD patients, 
and the cases described represent the two most common 
patterns of suicide that have been observed. These cases 
demonstrate not all patients follow the same pattern in the 
development of suicidal risk. In the first case, the suicide 
risk evolved and increased over an extended period of time 
and was well planned with an overwhelming severity of 
multiple symptoms including all of the symptoms associated 
with suicidality that were demonstrated in the chart review. 
This case had similarities to the suicide case described in the 
Lyme vaccine trials. The second case was unpredictable with 
no advanced planning, and these cases are often bizarre and 
senseless. In this case, there appeared to be an acute trigger, 
possibly sleep deprivation, which is a recognized trigger for 
suicidal behavior in the presence of other psychiatric risks 
for suicide.109
lyme disease statistics relevant to suicide
It has been calculated that 28% of Lyme patients progress to 
develop chronic symptoms,110,111 nearly half of the patients 
had Lyme disease for more than 10 years before their initial 
diagnosis,112 once depression occurs it tends to persist,113 and 
psychiatric symptoms associated with LAD often persist 
in spite of antibiotic treatment.114,115 A prior study demon-
strated 41% of children who had been diagnosed with Lyme 
disease had suicidal thoughts and 11% had made suicidal 
gestures,116 another study demonstrated 33% of late-stage 
Lyme disease patients were suicidal,21 and another study 
demonstrated 18% of posttreatment Lyme disease patients 
hade suicidal ideations,117 while another study demonstrated 
69% of Lyme/tick-borne disease patients with intrusive 
symptoms had suicidal thoughts.28
Possible prevalence of suicidality 
associated with laD
There are no direct records of the number of LAD patients 
who commit suicide. Therefore, an indirect method is imple-
mented to estimate the possible prevalence of suicidality

suicide and lyme and associated diseases
associated with LAD. Using the statistics previously stated 
in this article and the CDC statistic of at least 329,000 cases 
per year of Lyme disease and recognizing that initial infec-
tions occur mostly in children and middle-age adults, it 
has previously been calculated that 28% of Lyme patients 
progress to develop chronic symptoms which would mean at 
least 92,120 per year go on to develop chronic symptoms.6,108 
Of the total number of patients, 48% go 10 or more years 
before their initial diagnosis, and symptoms (including 
psychiatric symptoms) often persist when there has been a 
significant delay in initiating antibiotic treatment.112 Since 
many are relatively young with significant longevity, it is 
estimated the average duration of illness is at least 25 years 
which calculates to 2,303,000 having chronic symptoms. 
Studies previously discussed demonstrated persistent suicidal 
ideations were present in 33%, 69% (with intrusive symp-
toms), 18% and 43% in the chart review in this article.21,28,117 
I shall use the most restrictive number of 18% of posttreat-
ment Lyme disease patients having suicidal ideations which 
calculates to 414,540 LAD patients with suicidal ideations.117 
When using this number with the suicidality ratio of 0.3% 
with suicidal ideations of committing suicide per year and 
other ratios, it calculates to 1,244 suicides, 14,928 self-harm 
events, 31,100 suicide attempts, and 414,540 patients with 
suicidal ideations in the US per year from LAD, based on 
indirect calculations.5 This number would be higher when 
adding undiagnosed and untreated cases with persistent 
symptoms and when adding those attributed to the coin-
fections and other associated diseases that may be seen in 
patients with Lyme disease.
Conclusion
LAD contributes to causing suicidal tendencies, suicide, and 
combined suicidal and homicidal tendencies in individuals 
who did not show these tendencies before being infected. 
Suicide risk is greater in veterans and outdoor workers, both 
of whom have greater exposure to LAD. Multiple case reports 
and other journal articles recognize a causal association 
between suicidal risk and LAD. LAD has been associated 
with an increased risk of depression in a number of different 
studies and has also been associated with intrusive symptoms, 
both of which are associated with an increased risk of suicide. 
A suicide was reported in the Lyme vaccine clinical trial.
Multiple studies link infections, in particular chronic 
infections, and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, 
and metabolic changes and neural circuit dysfunction with 
increased risk of suicidal behavior. It appears that suicide 
with infectious diseases and LAD share common immune, 
quinolinic acid, glutamate, and neural dysfunction-mediated 
pathophysiology resulting in a broad spectrum of psychiatric 
and other symptoms that can be associated with increased 
suicidal risk. Tick-borne and other coinfections may further 
contribute to increasing symptoms (Figure 2).
The chart review of 253 patients generally reflects the 
findings in the medical literature. In the chart review, the 
patients were infected an average of 8 years before diagnosis 
and antibiotic treatment, and 43% had suicidal tendencies. 
 
In addition, 26% of these suicidal patients were also 
homicidal, but there were no patients who were homicidal 
without also being suicidal.
A higher level of risk of harm is associated with the 
presence of a number of conditions acquired as part of 
LAD and include explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden 
mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucina-
tions, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, 
depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, 
hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital–urinary 
symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustra-
tion tolerance, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive com-
pulsive disorder, cardiac symptoms, cognitive symptoms, 
musculoskeletal symptoms, and fatigue, but not gastroin-
testinal symptoms, vegetative symptoms, pulmonary/upper 
respiratory symptoms, or neurological symptoms.
Some LAD suicides are associated with being over-
whelmed by severe, multiple neuropsychiatric, and general 
medical symptoms.
Other LAD suicides are impulsive, bizarre, senseless, and 
difficult to predict. It is possible that disabling symptoms, 
feeling like a burden, and negative attitudes about Lyme 
disease from family, friends, doctors, and/or the health care 
system may also contribute to suicidal risk.
The prevalence of LAD suicides calculated by an indi-
rect method is estimated to be possibly 1,244 suicides and 
414,540 patients with suicidal ideations in the US per year 
from LAD.
A means of acquiring accurate direct statistics of suicide 
and LAD is needed. It is suggested medical examiners, the

CDC, and other epidemiological organizations proactively 
evaluate the association between LAD and suicide. Better 
recognition of the significance of LAD, earlier diagnosis 
and treatment, better understanding of the pathophysiology 
of suicide, and screening for suicide risk in LAD patients 
are also needed.
