 Purpose—To synthesize data addressing outcomes of metformin use in populations with type 2 
diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, or chronic liver 
disease with hepatic impairment.
Data Sources—MEDLINE (via PubMed) from January 1994 to September 2016; Cochrane 
Library, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from January 1994 to November 
2015.
Study Selection—English-language studies that examined adults with type 2 diabetes and 
chronic kidney disease with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, congestive heart failure, or chronic liver 
disease with hepatic impairment; compared diabetes regimens that included metformin to 
regimens that did not; and reported all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and 
other outcomes of interest.
Data Extraction—Two reviewers abstracted data and independently rated study quality and 
strength of evidence.
Data Synthesis—Based on quantitative/qualitative syntheses involving 17 observational studies, 
metformin use is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic liver disease with hepatic impairment, and reduced 
heart failure readmission in patients with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure.
Limitations—We identified low strength of evidence and sparse data on multiple outcomes of 
interest. Available studies were observational and had varying follow-up durations.
Conclusions—Metformin use in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease, congestive 
heart failure, or chronic liver disease with hepatic impairment is associated with improvements in 
key clinical outcomes. Our findings support recent changes in metformin labeling.

Introduction
Since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994, metformin has 
become the recommended initial treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States 
(1). Beyond its glycemic benefits, metformin typically does not cause weight gain or 
hypoglycemia and may be associated with lower mortality (2,3). Due to concerns about 
lactic acidosis with phenformin, a related biguanide withdrawn from the market in 1977, the 
FDA applied a boxed warning to metformin concurrent with its approval (4). This warning 
cautioned against using metformin in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which 
may impair excretion of the drug, and recommended caution with conditions that can 
promote lactate accumulation (e.g., congestive heart failure [CHF] and chronic liver disease 
[CLD]) (5).
Despite this warning, recent estimates suggest that 20–30% of metformin users have 
historical contraindications or precautions to its use (6,7). These findings reflect the fact that 
many prescribers have found the FDA boxed warning to be excessively restrictive (8,9). 
Literature reviews indicate no clear association between metformin and lactic acidosis (10),

 and suggest that the drug is safe for patients with moderate CKD or CHF (11,12). In 2006, 
the FDA removed CHF as a contraindication to metformin use, though acute or unstable 
CHF remains a precaution (13,14). In April 2016, the FDA revised its warning regarding 
metformin use in patients with CKD, switching from a serum creatinine-based definition for 
renal impairment to more inclusive criteria based on estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) (15). With this change, an estimated one million additional patients with moderate 
CKD (eGFR 30–<60 mL/min/1.73m2) became eligible for metformin use, though severe 
CKD (eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2) remains a contraindication (16).
In the wake of these changes, utilization of metformin will continue increasing in 
populations with historical contraindications and precautions. Prescribers must therefore 
fully understand the consequences of metformin use in these groups. In order to promote 
informed prescribing, we systematically reviewed existing literature regarding the benefits 
and harms of metformin use (beyond lactic acidosis) among patients with common chronic 
diseases historically identified by the FDA boxed warning as contraindications or 
precautions: moderate-to-severe CKD, CHF, and CLD with impaired hepatic function.
Methods
Study Design
This work was part of a Veterans Health Administration (VHA)–funded report. Additional 
details are available online (www.hsrd.research.va.gov/publications/esp). The present 
analysis focuses on the question: for patients with type 2 diabetes and a historical 
contraindication or precaution to metformin use, what are the benefits and harms (beyond 
lactic acidosis) of treatment with metformin?
This review followed a published protocol for this review (PROSPERO: CRD42016027708), 
and each step was pilot-tested to train and calibrate investigators.
Data Sources and Study Selection
In consultation with an expert medical librarian, we searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts in 
November 2015; our PubMed search was subsequently updated through September 2016. 
We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant completed and ongoing studies. Appendix 
Table 1 contains our exact search strategies. We also screened reference lists of published 
reviews and queried Bristol-Myers Squibb, the manufacturer of the branded formulation of 
metformin, for other relevant studies.
Our prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria are found in Appendix Table 2. We 
included English-language clinical trials and observational cohort studies that: 1) examined 
adults with type 2 diabetes and a metformin contraindication/precaution of interest 
(moderate-to-severe CKD [eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2], CHF, or CLD with hepatic 
impairment); 2) compared antihyperglycemic regimens that included metformin to regimens 
that did not; and 3) reported all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE), glycemic control, lipid control, hypoglycemia, weight gain, or vitamin B12

 deficiency. Our VHA stakeholders and technical expert panel provided guidance on outcome 
selection.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment of Individual Studies
Two investigators screened all citations for eligibility, and citations considered relevant by 
either individual advanced to full-text review. Two investigators reviewed all full-text articles 
and resolved disagreements through discussion or adjudication by a third investigator. Prior 
to excluding any potentially eligible study whose primary analysis did not explicitly address 
a population with a metformin contraindication/precaution, we examined the full text for 
relevant subgroup analyses.
Two investigators independently assessed study quality and resolved disagreements by 
consensus or arbitration by a third investigator. Using published quality criteria, we 
developed a customized risk of bias assessment tool designed to address selection, 
performance, attrition, detection, and reporting biases (Appendix Table 3) (18). We assigned 
each study a risk of bias score (low, moderate, or high).
Data Abstraction
For each included study, an investigator abstracted data using a customized DistillerSR 
database (Manotick, ON, Canada); a second investigator independently reviewed these data 
for accuracy. Relevant data included demographics, study setting, contraindication/
precaution definitions, metformin dose, other antihyperglycemic agents, comparator, and 
outcomes. We treated multiple publications from a single study as a single data point, 
prioritizing the longest term and most complete results. When critical data were missing or 
unclear in published reports, we contacted manuscript authors.
Data Synthesis
We developed summary tables to characterize all included studies for each metformin 
contraindication/precaution of interest. Of note, two studies (19,20) separately compared 
distinct groups of metformin users—those using metformin monotherapy and those using 
metformin/sulfonylurea combination therapy—to patients using sulfonylurea monotherapy. 
In each case, we derived a pooled, weighted hazard ratio (HR) for all metformin users, 
incorporating an approximation of the correlation resulting from the shared sulfonylurea 
monotherapy reference group (see Technical Appendix). For another study (21), we 
estimated HR and variance from the reported frequencies and odds ratio (OR) using an 
established approach (22,23) (see Technical Appendix).
When ≥3 studies were conceptually similar in terms of design, population, intervention, and 
outcomes, we performed quantitative synthesis using a random-effects model to generate 
summary hazard ratios. For analyses with <20 studies, we used the Knapp-Hartung approach 
to adjust the standard errors of the estimated coefficients (24,25). Where appropriate, we 
conducted sensitivity analyses by omitting subgroups with greater contraindication/
precaution severity (e.g., eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2), studies with shorter follow-up 
duration (<2 years), and studies not using propensity score adjustment. We evaluated 
statistical heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics, and for analyses including ≥10

 studies, assessed publication bias using funnel plots and Begg and Egger tests (26,27). When 
there were too few studies to warrant meta-analysis, we performed qualitative synthesis.
We performed all quantitative analyses using R (version 3.1.2), including R package 
“metafor” (version 1.9–7) for meta-analysis.
Strength of Evidence
We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach to evaluate the overall strength of evidence (SOE) for outcomes with 
sufficient data. Utilizing the domains of risk of bias, directness, and consistency/precision of 
treatment effects, an investigator (JWW) rated SOE as high, moderate, low, or insufficient. 
We considered the impact of residual confounders, magnitude of effect, and publication bias 
(28,29).
Role of the Funding Source
This review was funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The funding source had 
no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, preparation of the manuscript, or the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
Results
From 4,849 screened citations, we reviewed 523 full-text articles and identified 17 eligible 
studies (Figure 1). All were observational and addressed populations with moderate-to-
severe CKD (n=5), CHF (n=11), or CLD with hepatic impairment (n=3); 3 studies addressed 
both CKD and CHF. Appendix Table 4 provides details on included studies. Of note, we 
identified no ongoing studies meeting our inclusion criteria in ClinicalTrials.gov.
Chronic Kidney Disease
Six observational studies—4 retrospective cohort (30–33), one prospective cohort (34), and 
one nested case-control derived from a cohort (35)—evaluated metformin’s effect on 
relevant outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe CKD. Sample 
sizes ranged from 1,246 to 11,481 patients with moderate-to-severe CKD, and mean/median 
age ranged from 65 to 76 years. CKD definitions varied among studies, with 4 reporting 
eGFR-based definitions (30,31,34,35), and two using serum creatinine-based definitions 
(32,33). Only one study reported a median daily metformin dose (1100–1900 mg in various 
subgroups) (31). All studies adjusted for multiple baseline population differences between 
metformin users and nonusers; 3 utilized propensity scores (30,31,34). Follow-up ranged 
from one to 3.9 years. Two studies had low risk of bias (ROB) (30,33) and 4 moderate ROB 
(31,32,34,35).
All-cause mortality—Five studies (n=33,442) examined all-cause mortality, defined using 
medical records or administrative data in 5 studies (30–33) and prospective assessment in 
the fifth (34). Rather than comparing metformin to specific alternatives, all studies compared 
diabetes treatment regimens including metformin to regimens not including metformin. On 
meta-analysis, the relative chance of dying during follow-up was 22% lower for patients

 taking metformin than for those not taking metformin (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96; 
Q=29.7 [p<0.001], I2=79.8%) (Figure 2). Sensitivity analyses examining 3 studies 
(30,31,33) with follow-up duration ≥2 years and 3 (30,31,34) that used propensity score 
adjustment yielded similar HR point estimates and statistical heterogeneity to our main 
analysis.
Two studies reported mortality by CKD severity subcategory and suggested that patients 
with eGFR 30–<45 mL/min/1.73m2 experienced less benefit with metformin than patients 
with eGFR 45–<60 mL/min/1.73m2 (Figure 2) (31,34). A sensitivity analysis excluding a 
573 patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2—a level of kidney impairment at which 
metformin remains contraindicated—produced findings similar to the main meta-analysis 
(34).
Major adverse cardiovascular events—Two studies (n=14,408) examined MACE with 
diabetes treatment regimens including metformin versus regimens not including metformin 
(31,32). One used administrative data to identify MACE-related diagnoses (including 
myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, and procedures), and found no difference in outcomes 
with metformin use among patients with eGFR 45–<60 mL/min/1.73m2 (n=6655; HR 0.94; 
95% CI 0.84 to 1.05) and 30–<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (n=1894; HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19) 
(31). The other study used administrative data to examine readmission for CHF and found 
that metformin use was significantly associated with slightly lower readmission (n=5859; 
HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99) (32).
Hypoglycemia—One study (n=1,644 with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2) used diagnosis 
codes to examine hypoglycemia with use of metformin, glyburide, or insulin monotherapy 
(35) With metformin as the reference group, both glyburide (adjusted OR 6.0; 95% CI 3.8 to 
9.5) and insulin (adjusted OR 7.9; 95% CI 5.0 to 12.4) were associated with more 
hypoglycemia. These associations persisted with restriction to patients with eGFR <45 
mL/min/1.73m2 (glyburide OR 7.5; 95% CI 3.7 to 15.3; insulin OR 8.9; 95% CI 4.3 to 17.8) 
and eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 (glyburide OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 14.1; insulin OR 3.2, 95% 
CI 1.1 to 9.5).
Congestive Heart Failure
Eleven observational studies—8 retrospective cohort (19,20,30,32,36,37,39,40), two 
prospective cohort (34,38), and one nested case-control derived from a cohort (21)—
evaluated metformin’s effect on relevant outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and CHF. 
The entire population had CHF in 9 studies (19–21,30,32,36,37,39), and we examined CHF 
subgroups in the remaining two (34, 40). Sample sizes ranged from 346 to 13,930 patients 
with CHF, and mean/median age ranged from 55 to 77 years. CHF definitions varied widely, 
with most studies using diagnosis codes. CHF severity was reported variably; 4 studies 
reported left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (30,32,38,39), two reported New York 
Heart Association class (both of which also reported LVEF) (38,39), two reported other 
clinical criteria (19,37), and 5 did not report CHF severity (20,21,34,36,40). No studies 
reported median metformin dose. All studies adjusted for multiple baseline population 
differences between metformin users and nonusers; 5 utilized propensity scores

 (20,21,30,34,38). Follow-up ranged from one to 4.7 years. Two studies had low ROB (30,38) 
and the others moderate ROB.
All-cause mortality—Eleven studies (n=35,410) examined all-cause mortality, defined 
using medical records or administrative data in 9 studies (19,21,30,32,36–40), prospective 
assessment in one (34), and not defined in one (20). Nine studies compared diabetes 
treatment regimens including metformin to regimens not including metformin, while two 
compared metformin to sulfonylurea monotherapy (19,20). On meta-analysis, the relative 
chance of dying during follow-up was 22% lower for patients taking metformin than for 
those not taking metformin (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.87; Q=26.6 [p=0.003], I2=62.3%) 
(Figure 3). Sensitivity analyses examining 7 studies (19,20,30,36,38–40) with follow-up 
duration ≥2 years and 5 studies (20,21,30,34,38) that used propensity score adjustment 
yielded similar HR point estimates and statistical heterogeneity to our main analysis. 
Inspection of a funnel plot showed no clear evidence for publication bias (Appendix Figure 
1), nor did Begg (p=0.16) and Egger tests (p=0.09).
Two studies examined mortality by CHF severity. One reported mortality by LVEF category 
and found no difference with metformin in subgroups with moderate (LVEF 30% to 39%; 
HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.13) or severe CHF (LVEF <30%; HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.08) 
(32). The other included only patients with LVEF <40% and found no mortality difference 
with metformin (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.71) (39).
Major adverse cardiovascular events—Six studies used medical records or 
administrative data to examine MACE, with 4 (n=26,510) evaluating CHF readmission 
(21,30,32,38), and 3 (n=6,468) examining cardiovascular mortality (19,20,38). In all, 4 
studies compared diabetes treatment regimens including metformin to regimens not 
including metformin, while two compared metformin to sulfonylurea monotherapy (19,20). 
We performed separate meta-analyses for each MACE outcome. On meta-analysis, the 
relative chance of readmission for CHF during follow-up was 13% lower for patients taking 
metformin than for those not taking metformin (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97; Q=11.7 
[p=0.009], I2=74.3%) (Appendix Figure 2). A sensitivity analysis examining 3 studies 
(21,30,38) that used propensity score adjustment yielded a similar HR point estimate to our 
main analysis, but reduced statistical heterogeneity (Q=1.6 [p=0.44], I2=0.0%). The 
summary HR for cardiovascular mortality also favored metformin (Appendix Figure 3) but 
was not statistically significant (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.12; Q=7.8 [p=0.02], I2=74.3%).
Chronic Liver Disease
Three observational cohort studies—two retrospective (41,43) and one prospective (42)—
evaluated the effect of metformin on relevant outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and 
CLD with cirrhosis defined by histology. We therefore considered all patients to have 
“impaired hepatic function,” as specified by the FDA boxed warning (5). Individual sample 
sizes ranged from 82 to 250 patients, and mean/median age ranged from 60 to 61 years. No 
studies reported the median metformin dose. Follow-up ranged from 4.5 to 5.7 years. One 
study had low ROB (43) and one moderate ROB (41). The third study was well-designed

 overall but had high ROB with regard to all-cause mortality (42); the primary outcome was 
liver-specific mortality, and only unadjusted all-cause mortality rates could be derived.
All-cause mortality—Three studies (n=432) examined all-cause mortality, defined using 
medical record or administrative data in two studies (41,43) and prospective assessment in 
one (42). Each study compared diabetes treatment regimens including metformin to 
regimens not including metformin. All studies adjusted for baseline population differences 
between metformin users and nonusers for their primary analyses; however, in two studies 
we could abstract only unadjusted event rates for all-cause mortality (41,42). Because of 
these differences in outcome reporting, we did not attempt meta-analysis.
The low-ROB study found significantly longer survival associated with metformin use 
(n=250; HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.78), regardless of cirrhosis severity (Child-Pugh class A: 
HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.82; B/C: HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) (43). On post-hoc 
subgroup analysis, a positive association between metformin and survival was seen only 
with cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (n=142; HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.17 to 
0.63), and not in the smaller groups with cirrhosis related to alcohol or viral hepatitis.
Trends toward lower all-cause mortality with metformin use were present in the moderate-
ROB study (n=82; 7.3% [3/41] vs. 17.1% [7/41]; p=NR) (41) and high-ROB study (n=100; 
7.7% [2/26] vs. 48.6% [36/74]; p=NR) (42).
Other Outcomes
We identified no studies evaluating metformin’s effects on glycemic control, lipid control, 
weight gain, or B12 deficiency in adults with diabetes and contraindications/precautions of 
interest. We found no studies evaluating hypoglycemia in adults with diabetes and CHF or 
CLD, nor MACE in adults with diabetes and CLD.
Study Quality
Most studies had moderate or low ROB (Appendix Table 5). Common quality concerns 
included: 1) incomplete accounting for baseline population differences and confounding by 
indication, though some studies did utilize propensity scores; 2) limited assessment of 
metformin use throughout the study period (e.g., assessment at baseline without accounting 
for subsequent metformin discontinuation or initiation), though some studies did analyze 
metformin exposure status in “intervals” to account for this concern; 3) incomplete 
assessment and description of attrition; and 4) unblinded outcome assessment.
Strength of Evidence
Table 1 summarizes the overall SOE regarding metformin’s effect on all-cause mortality and 
MACE among patients with moderate-to-severe CKD or CHF. We only assessed SOE for 
outcomes where the number of studies warranted meta-analysis. For all-cause mortality, 
there was low SOE for reduced mortality among metformin users with moderate-to-severe 
CKD or CHF. There was likewise low SOE supporting reduced CHF readmission among 
metformin users with CHF; the evidence for reduction of cardiovascular mortality in this 
group was insufficient.

 Discussion
Following recent FDA labelling changes, metformin use in populations with historical 
contraindications or precautions will continue to rise. This systematic review sought to 
inform prescribing by examining clinical outcomes associated with metformin use among 
adults with type 2 diabetes and comorbid moderate-to-severe CKD, CHF, or CLD with 
impaired hepatic function. Based on available observational evidence, we found that 
metformin appears to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality in moderate CKD, 
CHF, and CLD with impaired hepatic function, reduced CHF readmission among patients 
with moderate CKD or CHF, and a lower rate of hypoglycemia among patients with 
moderate CKD.
Clinical and Policy Implications
As the consensus first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes, metformin is the most widely 
prescribed diabetes drug in the world (44). Beyond its glycemic effects, metformin is 
appealing because it is weight-neutral, safe, and may be associated with improved long-term 
outcomes in general diabetes populations (1–3). Although data were limited, we found no 
evidence to suggest that metformin’s benefits do not extend to patients with moderate CKD, 
CHF, or CLD with impaired hepatic function. Together with reports regarding the safety of 
metformin with respect to lactic acidosis (10,11), our findings support FDA’s recent actions.
This analysis adds to existing knowledge about metformin’s effects on mortality outcomes. 
Based on a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported through 
October, 2009, Lamanna et al. concluded that metformin monotherapy is likely associated 
with improved survival (2). In a subsequent analysis of 6 RCTs and 8 observational studies 
reported between April, 2009, and April, 2015, Bolen et al. reported lower cardiovascular 
mortality with metformin versus sulfonylureas (risk difference 0.1% to 2.9% in RCTs) (3). 
In contrast, Palmer et al. conducted a network meta-analysis of 25 comparative monotherapy 
studies reported through March, 2016, and found that cardiovascular mortality did not differ 
between diabetes medication classes, including metformin (45); of note, this analysis 
included only 67 total cardiovascular deaths. Our review differs from these analyses in that 
we focused on diabetes populations with historical metformin contraindications or 
precautions. Consequently, we analyzed observational studies with longer follow-up periods, 
which are in some ways better suited to examine outcomes that require long-term 
observation (like mortality). Our findings are consistent with those of Eurich et al. (12), who 
found that metformin is associated with reduced mortality in CHF; our analysis included 3 
additional studies (n=6,514) (21,38,40), and excluded another without an active comparator 
(46).
Beyond providing information for prescribers, this review may help inform revision of 
clinical guidelines. The 2016 American Diabetes Association guidelines note that 
“accumulating observational data suggest that metformin may be safely continued down to 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 45 mL/min/1.73m2/1.73m2 or even 30 mL/min/
1.73m2/1.73 m2” (1). Given the apparent mortality reduction associated with metformin use 
in diabetes patients with moderate CKD and other relevant comorbidities, this review may 
support strengthening this endorsement.

 Limitations
Though we utilized a rigorous, protocol-driven approach, our analysis does have limitations. 
First, in order to assure relevance for our VHA stakeholders, we limited our search to studies 
from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (17), 
which may have excluded potentially relevant articles from non-OECD countries. Second, 
although we examined numerous outcomes, we did not examine all outcomes of potential 
interest. Because our objective was informing metformin prescribing, we focused on the 
most clinically relevant outcomes for our stakeholders.
The observational evidence base warrants additional caution when interpreting our findings. 
First, registries like ClinicalTtrials.gov do not include observational studies, which limited 
our ability to assess for publication bias. Second, although most studies adjusted for baseline 
differences between metformin users and nonusers (sometimes including propensity scores), 
confounding by indication remains a potential source for unmeasured population 
differences. For example, many studies did not report outcomes based on contraindication/
precaution severity, so unaccounted-for between-group differences in disease severity could 
potentially have influenced our findings. Of note, sensitivity analyses examining studies 
using propensity score adjustment yielded similar HR point estimates to our main analyses, 
but did substantially reduce statistical heterogeneity in one case (readmission in CHF). 
Third, most included studies analyzed prevalent metformin users, which could introduce bias 
if the hazards associated with metformin (or comparators) vary with time (47). Fourth, 
because included studies typically compared diabetes treatment regimens including 
metformin to regimens not including metformin, intervention and comparator patients alike 
may have used sulfonylureas, insulin, and other medications. This issue prevented 
comparisons between metformin and specific alternatives. Fifth, while some studies 
analyzed outcomes based on time intervals during which patients did or did not receive 
metformin, most defined metformin use at baseline only. Post-baseline medication changes 
could therefore have led to misclassification of patients. Sixth, the timing of outcome 
assessment varied between studies and little information on attrition was typically available, 
potentially affecting study population composition over time. If the hazards of metformin 
use are time-varying, pooling data from studies with different follow-up durations could 
introduce bias (48); however, sensitivity analyses examining studies with follow-up ≥2 years 
yielded similar results to our main analysis.
All these limitations may have contributed to statistical heterogeneity observed in our 
quantitative syntheses. However, because most meta-analyzed studies showed metformin to 
be associated with improved outcomes of interest, this heterogeneity appears related to 
variance in the precise magnitude of an overall effect consistently favoring metformin. As 
such, the observed heterogeneity does not invalidate our findings.
Future Research
To date, most metformin trials have excluded patients with moderate-to-severe CKD, CHF, 
or CLD. As such, the primary evidence gap regarding metformin use for patients with 
historical contraindications or precautions is the lack of RCTs. Various factors reduce the 
feasibility of metformin RCTs for these populations; metformin is a generic medication

 widely viewed as a first-line treatment, and the length of time required for assessment of 
mortality and MACE may be prohibitive. Even without RCTs, new observational studies 
could ensure that deleterious outcomes do not become more apparent as metformin 
prescribing increases in populations with historical contraindications or precautions. Of 
note, we identified no such ongoing studies meeting our inclusion criteria in 
ClinicalTrials.gov.
The impact of contraindication/precaution severity on the apparently beneficial effects of 
metformin remains unclear. For example, although our primary CKD meta-analysis included 
patients with a range of eGFR values <60 mL/min/1.73m2, additional studies focusing 
specifically on cohorts with eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73m2 or even <30 mL/min/1.73m2 
would further inform metformin prescribing and guideline refinement. Data regarding 
precaution severity in CHF and CLD are sparse, and observational research could address 
these gaps.
Building on the issue of severity, the possibility of tailoring metformin prescribing based on 
the severity of historical contraindications/precautions would benefit from further research. 
Canadian prescribing guidelines have long recommended metformin dose reduction based 
on eGFR (49), and U.S. thought leaders have suggested a maximum metformin dose of 2550 
mg for patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2, 2000 mg daily for eGFR 45–<60 mL/min/
1.73m2, and 1000 mg/day for eGFR 30–<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (11). Given that metformin is 
excreted unchanged in the urine (50), dose adjustment has a clear rationale, but there are no 
trial data and limited observational data supporting this approach.
Finally, because diabetes medication classes have varying effects on cardiovascular 
outcomes (51,52), additional research comparing metformin to specific alternative agents in 
populations with historical contraindications/precautions would facilitate refinement of 
prescribing guidelines for these groups.
Conclusions
Based on limited evidence, metformin appears associated with reduced all-cause mortality in 
patients with moderate CKD, CHF, or CLD with impaired hepatic function. Further, 
metformin may be associated with reduced CHF readmission in patients with moderate 
CKD or CHF and reduced hypoglycemia incidence in patients with moderate CKD. 
Available data provide no evidence that the risks of metformin exceed risks associated with 
other antihyperglycemic medications in these populations. Our findings support recent FDA 
labeling changes, point toward areas for future research, and may help inform clinical 
practice and revision of clinical guidelines.
