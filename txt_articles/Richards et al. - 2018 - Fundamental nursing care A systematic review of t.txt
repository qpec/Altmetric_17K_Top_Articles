Aims and objectives: To determine the effects of nursing interventions for people’s
nutrition, elimination, mobility and hygiene needs.
Background: Patient experience of health care is sensitive to nursing quality. A refo-
cus on fundamental nursing care is undermined by lack of evidence of effectiveness
for interventions in core areas such as elimination, nutrition, mobility and hygiene.
Design: Systematic review.
Methods: We searched for and included experimental studies on interventions by
professionally qualified and unregistered nurses that addressed participants’ nutri-
tion, elimination, mobility and hygiene needs. We extracted data on scope, quality
and results of studies followed by descriptive narrative synthesis of included study
outcomes using a novel form of harvest plots.
Results: We included 149 studies, 35 nutrition, 56 elimination, 16 mobility, 39
hygiene and three addressing two or more areas simultaneously (67 randomised
controlled trials, 32 non-randomised controlled trials and 50 uncontrolled trials).
Studies into interventions on participant self-management of nutrition (n = 25), oral
health (n = 26), catheter care (n = 23) and self-management of elimination (n = 21)
were the most prevalent. Most studies focussed their outcomes on observational or
physiological measures, with very few collecting patient-reported outcomes, such as
quality of life, experience or self-reported symptoms. All but 13 studies were of low
quality and at significant risk of bias. The majority of studies did not define primary
outcomes, included multiple measures of identical concepts, used inappropriate anal-
yses and did not conform to standard reporting quality criteria.
Conclusions: The current evidence for fundamental nursing care interventions is sparse,
of poor quality and unfit to provide evidence-based guidance to practising nurses.
Relevance to clinical practice: Researchers in nursing internationally should now
undertake a programme of work to produce evidence for clinical practice in the fun-
damentals of care that is reliable, replicable and robust.

BACKGROUND
When nursing care is sub-optimal, patients experience health care
negatively (Rathert, Wyrwich, & Boren, 2013; Suhonen, Leino-Kilpi,
& Valimaki, 2005). Failure to assure the quality of nursing care leads
not only to distress and dissatisfaction, but also to wider patient
safety failures. Studies internationally (Bureau of Health Information,
2014, Garling, 2008; Kalisch, 2006) have highlighted the prevalence
and potentially catastrophic consequences of poor nursing care
(Department of Health, 2012, 2013). Missed or incomplete nursing
care has been identified as a key mechanism explaining the widely
demonstrated association between nurse staffing levels and patient
outcomes including mortality (Aiken et al., 2014; Ball, Murrells, Raf-
ferty, Morrow, & Griffiths, 2014). Optimising the quality of care is
essential in healthcare settings internationally, particularly for older
people, which for the example of the United Kingdom includes care
for more than half a million people over 65 per annum, and costs
more than £12 billion (Care Quality Commission, 2014).
Arising from such concerns, a number of initiatives have sought to
refocus nursing on central tenets of practice including “compassion”
(Commissioning Board Chief Nursing Officer and DH Chief Nursing
Adviser, 2012) and “fundamental nursing care” (Kitson, Robertson-
Malt, & Conroy, 2013), in the latter case accompanied by an interna-
tional campaign to identify and emphasise the components of essential
(or fundamental) nursing care (Kitson, Conroy, Wengstrom, Profetto-
McGrath, & Robertson-Malt, 2010)—defined as action to address
safety, comfort, communication, dignity, respiration, privacy, eating
and drinking, respecting choice, elimination, mobility, personal cleans-
ing and dressing, expressing sexuality, temperature control, rest and
sleep (Kitson, Conroy, Kuluski, Locock, & Lyons, 2013). Unfortunately,
this drive to refocus nursing on its core values and functions has
exposed the paucity of systematic evidence to guide practising nurses.
In an evidence-based healthcare environment, improving nursing
care requires action to produce robust evidence that ensures nurses
do more good than harm to those in their care. Much recent work
(Richards, Coulthard, & Borglin, 2014) has confirmed the findings of
previous reviews that the nursing research literature remains descrip-
tive (Mantzoukas, 2009), largely irrelevant to practising nurses (Hall-
berg, 2009) and a prime candidate for the term “research waste”
(Chalmers & Glasziou, 2009; Richards et al., 2014). In this situation, it
is difficult for practising nurses to follow clear evidence-based guide-
lines. Therefore, we conducted a review of four of the elements of
fundamental nursing care rated as most important in a previous inter-
national consensus study (Kitson, Conroy, et al., 2013). Although our
overall programme of research has also reviewed nonexperimental
descriptive and qualitative studies, in this report, we outline the find-
ings from our review of experimental interventions only, using the
PRISMA guidelines for reporting reviews of effectiveness.

REVIEW QUESTION
1. What is the effectiveness of nursing interventions that address
the nutrition, elimination, mobility and hygiene needs of people
in hospital and residents in care homes as investigated in experi-
mental studies?

METHODS
3.1
|
Eligibility criteria
We included experimental studies on any intervention undertaken
by either professionally qualified and/or unregistered nurses for peo-
ple in hospital or resident in care/nursing homes that aimed to
address and measure the impact on participants’ nutrition, elimina-
tion, mobility and hygiene needs. We defined interventions related
to nutrition as those assisting or supporting people in consuming
adequate food and fluids to achieve optimum nutritional and hydra-
tion status; elimination to address people’s toileting needs, and assist
them to eliminate urine and faeces conventionally or by catheterisa-
tion; mobility including assistance or support for people to move to
meet their own care needs and to remain independent; hygiene
including assisting or supporting patients to maintain bodily cleanli-
ness and to dress themselves independently.
We included reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs),
nonrandomised controlled trials (nRCTs) and uncontrolled experi-
mental
trials
(UCTs)
such
as
before-after
trials.
We
excluded
reports that solely investigated medical devices (such as catheter
type, washing products, incontinence devices, food supplements
and mobility aids), and observational studies where there was no
experimental manipulation of an intervention. We included studies
in English.
3.2

Information sources
We undertook searches during a period of time from May 2015–
March 2016. We searched all relevant databases including embase,
medline, cinahl, psychlit, psychinfo, science citation, bids and cancerlit,
in process and other nonindexed citations, COCHRANE reviews data-
bases using the OVID� platform, and individual database searches.
We contacted the authors of studies where we were unable to access
the full report through online databases and journals.
3.3
|
Search
We undertook four unique searches, one for each fundamental
care area, using MeSH and free-text terms and adapted to each

 of
the
specific
databases
searched.
Our
search
strategy
was
designed to be extremely sensitive and was part of a larger pro-
gramme of work that also searched for nonexperimental designs.
We had searched identified reviews for all citations identified
in them and identified additional citations through conference
attendance and networks. Appendix S1 details a specimen search
strategy
for
nutrition.
Other
searches
are

from
the
authors.
3.4
|
Study selection
We downloaded all results to a citation management system and
removed duplicates of retrieved reports. Two of our team of review-
ers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, merged
their decisions and resolved disagreements through discussion. We
retrieved full texts of potentially relevant articles and two reviewers
independently assessed each one for inclusion, again resolving dis-
crepancies by discussion or involvement of a third reviewer as nec-
essary.
3.5
|
Data collection
We extracted data from included studies to a bespoke data extrac-
tion sheet adapted from our previous reviews (Richards et al., 2014).
3.6
|
Data items
One reviewer extracted data on lead author, year of publication,
study
origin
country,
participant
demographic
characteristics,
essential nursing care category/ies addressed, interventions, compar-
isons, outcome measures, and study design, and categorised study
design using a priori definitions of study types. A second reviewer
checked 20% of the extracted data at random, discussed discrepan-
cies and advised where further checking was required.
3.7
|
Risk of bias and study quality
We assessed the risk of bias for each study as a combination of
study design and internal quality criteria. We regarded nRCTs and
UCTs as inherently more prone to bias than RCTs, but also assessed
the internal quality characteristics of each individual study, indepen-
dent of design. Using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Tool for Assess-
ing Risk of Bias, we assessed each study report against criteria for
bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, partici-
pant & staff blinding, outcome assessment blinding, incomplete out-
come data, selective reporting) (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011).
Following this procedure, we judged the quality of studies as high
when studies met more criteria for low risk of bias than for high risk
or unclear, assuming that unclear risk of bias represented poor study
reporting according to established standards. Where criteria were
evenly balanced, we applied judgements as to the relative impor-
tance of criteria, guided by the Cochrane procedure. We rated the
remaining studies as of low quality.
3.8
|
Summary measures
We extracted all recorded outcomes in each study report. We
adapted typologies from Valderas and Alonso (2008), Wilson and
Cleary (1995) and the World Health Organisation (2016) to cate-
gorise outcomes as (i) ratings of objective biological/physiological
variables (e.g., blood pressure); (ii) observational measures of perfor-
mance or behaviour (e.g., walking distance); (iii) patient-reported out-
comes (PROs) of phenomena such as symptoms, functional ability,
health perception, quality of life and other health-related constructs;
(iv) nurse variables (e.g., nursing knowledge).
3.9
|
Synthesis of results and risk of bias across
studies
Given the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes reported, we
undertook a descriptive narrative synthesis of results. We examined
each report individually and categorised interventions into conceptual
areas using consensus discussions within the team. We constructed
“harvest plots” (Ogilvie et al., 2008) to map the interventions, research
designs, study quality and reported outcomes for each essential nurs-
ing care area to delineate the scope and strength of the evidence for
each intervention and care area. Mapping study quality allowed us to
examine the risk of bias across all studies. We report in more detail
interventions with the most high-quality evidence of effect.

 of the participants, 280 of 3,241), oral and gastrointestinal including
dysphagia (two studies, 4% of the participants, 127 of 3,241), stroke
(one study, 12% of the participants, 400 of 3,241), musculoskeletal
including hip fracture, hip or knee replacement (one study, 8%, 253
of 3,241) or renal and urogenital (one study, 2% of the participants,
63 of 3,241). The health conditions of 65% (18 studies, 2,118 of
3,241) of the patients/residents remained unspecified. Eleven trials
were undertaken in hospitals, and 24 in nursing/care/residential
homes. Twenty-four of the trials were conducted in multiple sites.
We categorised interventions into three types: (i) nursing interven-
tions using nutritional support compounds; (ii) strategies to promote
patient self-care of nutrition and hydration; (iii) patient feeding proto-
cols. We identified 12 RCTs (three of nutritional support, seven for
self-care and two of feeding), 10 nRCTs (two nutritional support and
eight self-care) and 13 UCTs (one nutritional support, two feeding pro-
tocols and 10 self-care). Methodologically, one of the 12 RCTs was of
high quality, and the remaining 11 were low quality. All of the 10
nRCTs were low quality, and all but one of the 13 UCTs were low
quality (Table S6).
We found a wide range of outcomes reported, with multiple out-
comes per trial and few trials identifying a clear primary outcome.
Thirty-two trials reported observational outcomes, 12 physiological/
biological, eight nursing and only three PROs. Many trials reported an
equivocal mix of outcomes. Findings in favour of the intervention were
more prevalent in nRCTs, inherently more prone to bias, and in poor-
quality trials, or often offset by findings of no difference on other mea-
sures in the same trial. The harvest plot for nutrition (Figure 2) displays
the numbers of trials reporting outcomes in favour of the intervention
(shown as +ve numbers on the x-axis) or outcomes in favour of the
control/comparison or with no between-group or pre–post differences
(�ve numbers) for all trials of nutrition interventions, charted by inter-
vention, research method and methodological quality.
The only high-quality RCT in this area (Hickson et al., 2004),
which
tested
the
introduction
of
supernumerary
nonregistered
healthcare assistants onto ward environments to support staff and
patients with nutritional intake, found an effect in favour of the
intervention in reducing IV antibiotics and fluids but no difference in
a large range of other measures including weight, length of hospital
stay, grip strength and BMI. The UCT trial (Ragneskog, Kihlgren,
Karlsson, & Norberg, 1996) rated as of high quality in terms of its
conduct (albeit in a design inherently prone to bias) tested the use
of music during dining times and found both positive and negative
effects on self-feeding behaviours.

Elimination
The 56 experimental studies of interventions to aid patients’ elimina-
tion needs (Table S2) included 7,361 patient participants, aged from
18–100, with a range of healthcare problems including those post-
surgery 55% (23 studies, 4,061/7,361) such as transurethral resec-
tion of the prostate, hysterectomy, hip replacement, vaginal repair
and bowel resection. About 40% (29 studies, 2,934 of 7,361) of the
study participants experienced incontinence, 31% (nine studies,
2,292 of 7,361) had indwelling catheters and 34% (nine studies,
2,474 of 7,361) had urinary retention.
The health conditions of participants included renal and urogenital
problems (39 studies, 59% of the participants, 4,320 of 7,361), muscu-
loskeletal (two studies, 4% of the participants, 271 of 7,361), stroke
(three studies, 2% of the participants, 143 of 7,361), cancer (one study,
1% of the participants, 110 of 7,361), reproductive health and child-
birth (one study, 3% of the participants, 250 of 7,361) and problems
with mental health and congenital or neurological disorders (one study,
2% of the participants, 151 of 7,361). The health conditions of 29%
(eight studies, 2,101 of 7,361) of the patients/residents were unspeci-
fied. 28 trials were undertaken in hospitals, 28 in nursing/care/resi-
dential homes. 20 of the trials were conducted in multiple sites.
We categorised interventions into four types: (i) interventions for
promoting independent self-care of elimination; (ii) bladder training;
(iii) catheter care; (iv) multi-component management including ele-
ments of the previous three categories. We identified 32 RCTs (eight
promoting self-care, three bladder training and 21 catheter care), 10
nRCTs (six self-care, two catheter care and two multi-component

 management) and 14 UCTs (seven self-care and eight multi-compo-
nent management). Methodologically, six RCTs were of high quality
and 26 of low quality. All of the nRCTs and UCTs were of low quality
(Table S6).
As in other fundamental care areas, a wide range of outcomes
was reported, with multiple outcomes per trial and few trials identi-
fying a clear primary outcome. Fifty-four trials reported observa-
tional outcomes, 29 physiological/biological, three nursing outcomes
and 10 PROs. Most trials were of poor quality and many reported
an equivocal mix of outcomes distributed between those in favour
of the intervention and those showing no difference. The harvest
plot for elimination (Figure 3) displays outcomes using the same con-
ventions as Figure 2.
Of the six high-quality RCTs, one focussed on self-care and five
on catheter care. As can be seen from Figure 3, results were very
mixed. The one self-care trial (Hansen & Olsen, 2015) found that
compared to using bedpans and urine bottles, postoperative ambu-
lant toileting in the recovery room reduced the frequency of
catheterisation but had a mixed effect on variables such as mobilisa-
tion, pain relief and nausea. The catheter care studies included three
investigating immediate or early postoperative vs. delayed catheter
removal (Alessandri, Mistrangelo, Lijoi, Ferrero, & Ragni, 2006; Dunn,
Shlay, & Forshner, 2003; Kamilya, Seal, Mukherji, Bhattacharyya, &
Hazra, 2010). Results were conflicting, with two demonstrating no
between-group differences in infection rates but one positive for
early removal. Other positive effects included less pain and reduced
hospital stays in the immediate groups, but increased frequency of
urinary retention. In a further study (Webster et al., 2006), evening
removal of catheters had no effect on hospital length of stay. Finally,
a study on three different catheter washout regimes (Moore et al.,
2009) found no advantages of saline, acidic washouts vs. no wash-
outs in terms of re-catheterisation or infection rates.

Mobility
The 16 experimental studies of interventions to aid patients’ mobility
needs (Table S3) included 49,917 patient participants, aged from 17–
103, with largely unspecified medical diagnoses (six studies, 97% of
the participants, 48,410 of 49,917), and to a much lesser degree with
neurological (seven studies, 3% of the participants, 1,332 of 49,917),
cardiovascular (one study, 0.2% of the participants, 86 of 49,917),
renal and urogenital (one study, 0.1% of the participants, 65 of
49,917), and blood (one study, 0.05% of the participants, 24 of
49,917) conditions. Ten trials were undertaken in hospitals, six in nurs-
ing/care homes. Eight of the trials were conducted in multiple sites.
We categorised interventions into three types: (i) exercise inter-
ventions; (ii) promoting independent mobility; (iii) risk reduction. We
identified five RCTs (two exercise interventions, one independent
mobility and two for risk reduction), four nRCTs (two exercise inter-
ventions and two independent mobility) and seven UCTs (one exer-
cise intervention, five promoting mobility and one risk reduction).
Methodologically, one RCT was of high quality and four of low qual-
ity. All of the nRCTs and UCTs were of low quality (Table S6).
Similar to other areas, multiple outcomes per trial were reported
and few trials identified a clear primary outcome. Fifteen trials
reported observational outcomes, six physiological/biological, three
nursing outcomes and two PROs. Most trials were of poor quality
and many reported an equivocal mix of outcomes distributed
between those in favour of the intervention and those showing no
difference. Findings in favour of the intervention were more preva-
lent in poor-quality trial designs and often offset by findings of no
difference in the same trial or other trials of the intervention type.
The harvest plot for mobility (Figure 4) displays outcomes using the
same conventions as other Figures.
The one high-quality RCT (Barker et al., 2016) in this area, which
tested a complex intervention of a fall risk tool, combined with an
individualised falls prevention programme (6-PACK), found no effect
of the intervention on fall rates and injuries.

needs (Table S4) included 7,625 patient participants, aged from 18–

 34% of the participants, 2,615 of 7,625), oral and gastrointestinal
(three studies, 3% of the participants, 248 of 7,625), respiratory
(three studies, 14% of the participants, 1,033 of 7,625, two studies
did not specify participant numbers), renal and urogenital (two stud-
ies, 2% of the participants, 176 of 7,625), mental health (two studies,
1% of the participants, 91 of 7,625) and cardiovascular (one study,
1% of the participants, 71 of 7,625). The population of one study
had a combination of neurological, stroke and unspecified health
conditions (2% of the participants, 131 of 7,625). The health condi-
tions of 43% (14 studies, 3,260 of 7,625) of the patients/residents
were unspecified. The participants were admitted to hospital (11 tri-
als) and residential care (28 trials) facilities. Seventeen of the trials
were conducted in multiple sites.
We categorised interventions into three types: (i) the promotion
of self-care of hygiene and dressing; (ii) washing/cleaning patients;
(iii) oral health. We identified 15 RCTs (one self-care, three washing/
cleaning and 11 for oral health), eight nRCTs (one self-care, one
washing/cleaning and six oral health) and 16 UCTs (one self-care, six
washing/cleaning and nine oral health). Methodologically, two RCTs
and one UCT were of high quality, the remaining trials all of low
quality (Table S6).
Multiple outcomes per trial were reported and few trials identi-
fied a clear primary outcome. Twenty-nine trials reported physiologi-
cal/biological outcomes, 15 observational, eight nursing outcomes
and four PROs. All but three trials were of poor quality and many
reported an equivocal mix of outcomes distributed between those in
favour of the intervention and those showing no difference. Findings
in favour of the intervention were more prevalent in trials more
prone to bias. The harvest plot for hygiene (Figure 5) displays out-
comes using the same conventions as other similar Figures.
The two high-quality RCTs in this area (Juthani-Mehta et al.,
2015; Prendergast, Jakobsson, Renvert, & Hallberg, 2012), which
tested comprehensive oral care protocols found no effects in favour
of the interventions on pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections
or oral health. The UCT trial (Cuccio et al., 2012) rated as of high
quality in terms of its conduct (but likewise a design inherently
prone to bias) tested an oral care protocol including chlorhexidine
rinses and found effects in favour of the intervention on ventilator-
associated pneumonia rates.

Studies addressing two or more fundamental
care areas
The three experimental studies about interventions addressing two
or more fundamental care areas (Table S5) included 353 participants
in two of these studies, mean ages between 87–89. Participants in
these two studies had renal and urogenital medical diagnoses. One
study of an organisational quality improvement strategy did not
report the number, ages or diagnoses of patient participants. All
three trials were undertaken in multiple nursing/care home sites.
All three studies were RCTs testing interventions for self-care
(Figure 6). Methodologically, one RCT was of high quality, the other
two of low quality (Table S6). Two trials reported observational out-
comes, one physiological/biological outcomes, two nursing outcomes
and one reported PROs. Similar to other areas, multiple outcomes
per trial were reported.
The high-quality RCT in this area (Schnelle et al., 2002), a combi-
nation of exercise and scheduled toileting, found effects in favour of
the intervention for mobility and incontinence frequency.

DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, we identified 149 experimental trials of
interventions by nurses to address people’s nutrition, elimination,
mobility and hygiene needs; 67 RCTs, 32 nRCTs and 50 uCTs. All
but 13 trials (8.7%) were of low quality and at risk of bias from their
basic methodological design or from their conduct. Studies into
interventions to assist in patient self-management of nutrition
(n = 25), oral health (n = 26), catheter care (n = 23) and interven-
tions to help patient self-manage their elimination needs (n = 21)
were the most prevalent. Studies into nursing interventions to assist
patients with mobility (n = 16) were the least frequently reported,
although there were also surprisingly few studies on interventions to

 assist patients with self-care of their hygiene needs (n = 3) and feed-
ing protocols (n = 4), core fundamental nursing care activities.
Most studies focussed their outcomes on a mix of observational
and physiological measures with very few studies using outcomes
collected directly from patients themselves, such as quality of life,
experience or self-reported symptoms. Further, studies collected
multiple measures and rarely prespecified the primary outcome of
interest. We observed frequent attempts to overestimate the out-
comes of studies. For example, the authors of many RCTs and
nRCTs claimed positive effects for experimental interventions by
reporting within group rather than between-group outcomes. Few
attempts were made to control for other potentially confounding
variables affecting outcomes, and multiple testing was the norm in
these studies.
Although we found papers reporting findings in favour of many
fundamental care interventions, these were generally from low-qual-
ity RCTs at high risk of bias or from equally low quality, less rigor-
ous nRCT or UCT studies and were usually offset by results from
the same trials or from others that demonstrated no effects in
favour of the experimental interventions. The 13 high-quality trials
investigated
interventions
for
improving
self-care
of
nutrition
(n = 2), catheter care (n = 5), self-care of elimination (n = 1), risk
reduction in mobility (n = 1), oral health (n = 3) and interventions
addressing two or more fundamental care areas (n = 1). Few of
these trials provide information on routine care practices that could
be implemented by nurses. For nutrition, the trials of supernumerary
workers and music provide little information to guide nurses giving
fundamental care. In terms of elimination, all but one trial were on
variations of catheter care, mainly removal regimes, and had equivo-
cal results, whilst the self-care trial was only applicable to the speci-
fic postoperative recovery room context. In mobility and hygiene,
the falls prevention and oral health RCTs did not demonstrate any
reliable intervention effects. The only high-quality study to show
real promise tested a multi-component intervention and found
effects in favour of the intervention on mobility and incontinence
frequency.
The sparsity of robust results for the effectiveness of nursing inter-
ventions for fundamental care is sobering indeed. Our mapping of
these results using harvest plots dramatically illustrates the method-
ological status and the sources of the evidence upon which nurses

 must draw when planning the fundamental care of their patients. We
can only surmise that in the absence of clear evidence, nurses must
conduct their duties using a combination of guesswork, folk knowl-
edge and tradition or else utilise evidence from studies that are at sub-
stantial risk of bias. This situation is not tenable for a profession
positioning itself at the heart of modern healthcare provision.

Limitations
We restricted our searches to studies examining interventions
that were undertaken by nurses. Given that health care is a multi-
professional endeavour, there may be studies from other clinical dis-
ciplines investigating fundamental care behaviours that could be
used by nurses. We also restricted our search to studies published in
English so that it is possible that additional studies are present in
professional journals written in other languages. However, it is gen-
erally the case that English is the primary language of science and
we did indeed identify and include studies from a range of countries
outside the native English speaking world. We found it very difficult
to identify primary outcome variables in many studies and, therefore,
synthesised all outcomes as of equivalent importance. This might
mean that we have not represented the most significant variables
accurately, although our strategy was to err on the side of caution
given that many of the studies demonstrating effects in favour of
experimental interventions did so only by collecting many multiple
outcomes. As in all reviews, it is possible that we might not have
found all relevant studies, however, we feel secure that any missed
studies would not alter the overall pattern of results substantially,
given the large number of studies we did include.

CONCLUSIONS
As surmised by the editorial call for papers for this special edition of
the Journal of Clinical Nursing, the evidence base for fundamental
nursing care is characterised by studies at high risk of bias producing
negative or at best equivocal findings. Not one nursing intervention
stands out as a clear evidence-based solution to the many calls to
improve the quality of essential nursing care and enhance the expe-
rience of our patients. It cannot be beyond the wit of the current
generation of researchers in nursing to construct and undertake
high-quality trials using modern health services research methods
such as those espoused by amongst others the UK Medical Research
Council (Craig et al., 2008; Richards & Rahm-Hallberg, 2015) and
reported using transparent criteria. We call on all researchers in
nursing internationally to undertake a programme of work, collabora-
tively if possible, to produce evidence that is reliable, replicable and
robust, evidence that is sorely needed indeed.
