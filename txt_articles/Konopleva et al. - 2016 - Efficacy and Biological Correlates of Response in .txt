ABSTRACT 
 
We present a phase II, single-arm study evaluating 800 mg daily venetoclax, a highly 
selective, oral small-molecule B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL2) inhibitor in 
patients with high-risk relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or unfi
 t for intensive 
chemotherapy. Responses were evaluated following revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. 
The overall response rate was 19%; an additional 19% of patients demonstrated antileukemic activity 
not meeting IWG criteria (partial bone marrow response and incomplete hematologic recovery). Twelve 
(38%) patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, of whom 4 (33%) achieved complete 
response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. Six (19%) patients had BCL2-
sensitive protein index at screening, which correlated with time on study. BH3 profi
 ling was consistent 
with on-target BCL2 inhibition and identifi
 ed potential resistance mechanisms. Common adverse events 
included nausea, diarrhea and vomiting (all grades), and febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia (grade 3/4). 
Venetoclax demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with AML and adverse features. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
 Venetoclax monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with AML (relapsed/
refractory or unfi
 t for intensive chemotherapy) with a tolerable safety profi
 le in this phase II study. Pre-
dictive markers of response consistent with BCL2 dependence were identifi
 ed. Clinical and preclinical 
fi
 ndings provide a compelling rationale to evaluate venetoclax combined with other agents in AML.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous 
disease characterized by impaired differentiation of hemat-
opoietic stem cells and subsequent clonal expansion of 
myeloid blasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and 
extramedullary tissue. Patients older than 65 years derive less 
benefi
 t from standard intensive chemotherapy and poorly 
tolerate toxicities ( 
1, 2 
). 
 
B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL2), an antiapoptotic 
protein commonly expressed in hematologic malignan-
cies, has been shown to be involved in tumor survival and 
chemo 
resistance ( 
3 
). BH3 mimetics are an emerging group of 
agents that bind and inhibit antiapoptotic proteins, freeing 
proapoptotic proteins to initiate apoptosis ( 
4 
). Venetoclax 
(ABT-199/GDC-0199) is a highly selective, orally bioavailable 
BCL2 inhibitor that has shown activity in BCL2-dependent 
leukemia and lymphoma cell lines ( 
5, 6 
). Venetoclax induced 
cell death in AML cell lines and primary patient samples  
in 
vitro and in mouse xenograft models ( 
7, 8 
). BCL2 inhibition 
induced cell death in AML cell lines and in leukemic blasts, 
progenitor cells, and stem cells from patients with AML ( 
9, 
10 
). The unique role of BCL2 in leukemia stem cell survival 
suggests that BCL2 inhibition has the potential to eliminate 
chemotherapy-resistant leukemia stem cells while sparing 
normal hematopoietic stem cells ( 
9–11 
). These data provide 
a rationale for targeted BCL2 inhibition with venetoclax in 
AML. 
 
Venetoclax has demonstrated promising clinical activity as 
a single agent in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia (CLL; ref.  
12 
). This is the fi
 rst clinical study of venetoclax 
monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory AML or 
untreated AML unfi
 t for intensive therapy. The primary 
objective was effi
 cacy; secondary objectives included safety 
and pharmacokinetics. Exploratory objectives evaluated 
biomarkers, including protein expression patterns of BCL2, 
BCL2-like 1 (BCL-X 
L 
) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 
(MCL1), and BH3 profi
 ling. BCL2 family protein expression 
and BH3 profi
 ling using synthetic oligopeptides derived from 
BH3 domains of prodeath BH3 peptides that are applied 
to mitochondria ( 
4 
) have been retrospectively evaluated as 
potential biomarkers of clinical response to venetoclax. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Patient Characteristics and Disposition 
 
Thirty-two patients received at least 1 dose of venetoclax, 
and 26 patients had at least 4 weeks of therapy. Thirteen 
(41%) were reported to have an antecedent hematologic dis-
order or myeloproliferative neoplasms, and 4 (13%) patients 
had therapy-related AML (from prior malignancies) with 
complex cytogenetics. Two previously untreated patients 
were considered unfi
 t for intensive chemotherapy by the 
treating physician and were treatment-naïve at study entry. 
Thirty (94%) patients had received at least 1 prior therapy,

Cytogenetics were evaluated for all patients at the investigator

and 13 (41%) patients had received at least 3 prior treatment

tion therapy (cytarabine + anthracycline), and 23 (72%) had 
received at least 1 hypomethylating agent. The median age 
was 71 years (19–84 years); baseline characteristics are sum-
marized in  
Table 1. 
 
 
 
Molecular markers and cytogenetics were evaluated locally 
for all patients. In addition, AML-associated genetic muta-
tions were assessed in pretreatment specimens using two 
next-generation sequencing panels: the Trusight Myeloid 
Panel for 31 of 32 patients and the FoundationOne Heme 
Panel, which assesses genomic aberrations in over 400 genes, 
for 15 of 32 patients. Key molecular markers and cytogenetics 
data are highlighted in  
Table 1 
. Mutations in isocitrate dehy-
drogenase ( 
IDH 
) 1 or 2 were identifi
 ed in 12 (38%) patients 
( 
n 
 = 2 for  
IDH1 and  
n 
 = 10 for  
IDH2 
). Eleven of the 12  
IDH1/2 
 
mutations were in a known site that leads to production 
of ( 
R 
)-2-hydroxyglutarate (e.g.,  
IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140 
, and 
 
IDH2-R172 
; refs.  
13–15 
). One patient had a mutation in exon 
3 of  
IDH2 (D76 frameshift); the functional signifi
 cance of this 
mutation is unknown. FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3–internal 
tandem duplication ( 
FLT3- 
ITD) mutations were reported in 
4 (13%) patients (3 of which were confi
 rmed in pretreatment 
specimens). These 3 patients had concomitant mutations 
in  
IDH 
. Ten (31%) patients had chromosome 7q deletions 
[del(7q)] and 10 (31%) had complex cytogenetics. 
 
 
Overall Activity 
 
The objective response rate by International Working 
Group (IWG) criteria was 19% (6/32), with 6% ( 
n 
 = 2) achieving 
a complete response (CR) and 13% ( 
n 
 = 4) achieving a CR with 
incomplete blood count recovery (CRi;  
Table 2 
). Except for 1 
CRi, all objective responses were achieved by the week 4 assess-
ment. All IWG-defi
 ned responses were observed in patients 
who had been previously treated for AML. Three of the 6 
responders had an antecedent hematologic disorder. Of the 
24 patients who received prior hypomethylating agents, 25% 
(6/24) achieved CR/CRi. Among the 12 patients with  
IDH1/2 
 
mutations, 4 (33%) achieved CR/CRi. One patient with an 
IDH2 
 mutation (not in a putative hotspot) achieved a CRi 
at week 24 following a 20-day dose interruption after week 
4. The median duration of venetoclax therapy in responders 
was 144.5 days (83–256 days), and the median duration of CR 
was 48 days ( 
Table 3 
). Thirty-four percent (11/32) of patients 
escalated to 1,200 mg daily venetoclax after lack of objective 
response at the fi
 rst assessment on 800 mg and 9% (3/32) 
after relapse following CR/CRi on 800 mg. The 1,200-mg 
dose did not demonstrate additional activity. Median time on 
study was 63.5 days (14–256 days). All patients have discon-
tinued venetoclax: 29 discontinued due to progressive disease, 
1 discontinued due to an adverse event (AE; terminal ileitis), 
1 withdrew consent, and 1 proceeded to allogeneic hemat-
opoietic stem cell transplant after achieving stable disease. 
 
 
Antileukemic activity evidenced by bone marrow blast 
reduction from baseline and incomplete hematologic recov-
ery, which did not meet IWG response criteria, was observed 
in an additional 19% (6/32) of patients. Two patients had per-
sistent antileukemic activity: 1 patient had ≥50% bone mar-
row blast reduction at week 5 and recovery of hemoglobin 
and platelets (until discontinuing venetoclax after 247 days),

1 patient was treatment-naïve. None of the 4 patients with 
therapy-related AML experienced antileukemic activity on 
venetoclax. The median time to progression was 2.5 months 
(1–3 months). The 6-month leukemia-free survival rate was

3/4 AEs were febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, pneumonia, 
hypotension, and urinary tract infection. Serious AEs were 
reported in 27 (84%) patients, with febrile neutropenia being 
the most common (10/32, 31%;  
Table 4 
). There were no events 
of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The incidence of infection 
was consistent with expectations for this patient population. 
Electrolyte abnormalities were related to concomitant sup-
portive therapy for TLS  
prophylaxis and antifungal agents. 
 
 
There were no AEs that required reduction of venetoclax 
dose. Venetoclax interruptions occurred in 8 of 32 (25%) 
patients. Of these, 6 patients had AEs: 4 were grade 3/4 and 2 
were grade 1/2. There were 2 grade 3/4 events of diarrhea and 
2 grade 3/4 events of febrile neutropenia managed by inter-
ruption of venetoclax dosing. In addition, 1 patient had bone 
marrow failure, and 1 patient had disease progression. Other 
events of febrile neutropenia were managed by standard of 
care ( 
n 
 = 9). 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
Venetoclax plasma concentration–time profi
 le at week 6 
day 1 from 13 patients who received the 800-mg dose is 
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Following multiple-dose 
administrations of 800 mg venetoclax, plasma concentrations 
peaked at 6 hours (4–8 hours), and the mean (coeffi
 cient of vari-
ation %) maximum plasma concentration (C 
max 
), trough plasma 
concentration, and AUC over a 24-hour dose interval (AUC 
0–24 
) 
were 3.74 (48) μg/mL, 1.43 (134) μg/mL, and 61.6 (69) μg•h/mL, 
respectively. Venetoclax exposures in the current study are 
consistent with those observed in the fi
 rst-in-human veneto-
clax studies in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL or non-
Hodgkin lymphoma ( 
12, 18 
). Venetoclax IC 
50 
 was <10 nmol/L 
(0.0087 μg/mL) in primary AML patient myeloblast samples 
and <100 nmol/L (0.087 μg/mL) in sensitive AML cell lines ( 
7 
 
). 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Single-agent venetoclax demonstrated a 19% objective 
response rate by IWG criteria in patients with heavily pre-
treated AML. An additional 19% derived had antileukemic 
activity demonstrated by partial bone marrow response and 
incomplete hematologic recovery that did not meet standard 
response criteria. For the majority of patients, activity was 
observed at the fi
 rst assessment (end of week 4). Activity 
was observed in patients pretreated with standard induction 
therapy and hypomethylating agents; 25% of those previously 
treated with hypomethylating agents achieved an objective 
response. 
 
Venetoclax was tolerable in these heavily pretreated patients 
with AML, with AEs consistent with expectations in this 
population ( 
19, 20 
). There were no events of TLS, and no new 
safety signals were identifi
 ed compared with other venetoclax 
monotherapy trials in hematologic malignancies ( 
12, 18 
). 
 
Mutations in  
IDH1/2 
 are present in approximately 15% to 
20% of patients with AML ( 
15, 21 
); in the current study, 12 
(38%) patients had  
IDH1/2 mutations. These mutations are 
acquired early in progression to leukemia ( 
22, 23 
) and appear 
stable during disease evolution ( 
24, 25 
). Mutant  
IDH1/2 
 
proteins catalyze production of the oncometabolite ( 
R 
)-2-hy-
droxyglutarate and elicit epigenetic changes, dysregulated 
mitochondrial function, and increased BCL2 dependence in 
BCL2, BCL-X 
L 
, and the ratio of BCL2/BCL-X 
L 
 in the blasts 
were retrospectively assessed with time on study and reduc-
tion in bone marrow blasts with the goal of identifying 
BCL2 family sensitive or resistant indices based on protein 
expression. Patients were categorized as having a BCL2 fam-
ily sensitive protein index if ≥35% of tumor cells expressed 
BCL2 and <40% of tumor cells expressed BCL-X 
L 
 protein 
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients with <35% of tumor cells 
having detectable BCL2 protein expression and/or >40% hav-
ing detectable BCL-X 
L 
 protein expression were categorized as 
having a BCL2 family resistant protein index. Six of 22 (27%) 
patients had a BCL2 family sensitive protein index; of these, 
1 patient achieved CRi (the other CRi patient with an evalu-
able specimen had a BCL2 resistant profi
 le) and 3 patients 
achieved antileukemic activity not meeting IWG response 
criteria ( 
Fig. 1C 
 and  
Table 3 
). Patients with a BCL2 family 
sensitive protein index at screening experienced longer dura-
tions on venetoclax therapy ( 
P 
 = 0.0381 by Wilcoxon signed 
rank test;  
Fig. 1D 
 and  
Table 3 
). 
 
BH3 profi
 ling is a functional assay with utility for probing 
interactions between antiapoptotic BCL2 family proteins and 
their proapoptotic counterparts to determine BCL2 family 
dependence ( 
4 
). We assessed whether BH3 profi
 ling results 
would correlate with clinical response to venetoclax ( 
16 
). BH3 
profi
 ling with a series of BH3 peptides was performed on 
18 pretreatment bone marrow biopsies or peripheral blood 
samples; 12 samples passed quality-control criteria for data 
analysis (>50% viability on thaw; >5% AML blasts;  
Fig. 2 
). 
Mitochondrial cytochrome  
c 
 release in response to HRK pep-
tide indicated BCL-X 
L 
 dependence, in response to MS1 peptide 
indicated MCL1 dependence, and in response to BAD pep-
tides indicated BCL2 and/or BCL-X 
L 
 dependence. Subtracting 
cytochrome  
c 
 release caused by HRK from that caused by BAD 
(BAD-HRK) provides a rough index of selective BCL2 depend-
ence ( 
17 
). Mitochondrial cytochrome  
c 
 release in response to 
venetoclax correlated with release caused by BAD-HRK ( 
P 
 = 
0.0002;  
Fig. 2A 
), indicating on-target activity within myeloblast 
mitochondria for venetoclax. Cytochrome  
c 
 release caused by 
direct  
ex vivo 
 exposure of myeloblast mitochondria to veneto-
clax correlated weakly with duration on venetoclax ( 
P 
 = 0.0607; 
 
Fig. 2B 
). Although not statistically signifi
 cant, this result is 
consistent with a mitochondrial mechanism of action for 
venetoclax  
in vivo 
. Negative correlation was observed between 
AML blast dependence on the antiapoptotic protein BCL-X 
L 
 
(using the HRK peptide,  
P 
 = 0.0072;  
Fig. 2C 
) or the antiapop-
totic protein MCL1 (using the MS1 peptide,  
P 
 = 0.0231;  
Fig. 
2D 
) correlated with days on venetoclax. Because dependence 
on MCL1 or BCL-X 
L 
 predicted short duration of venetoclax 
therapy, we asked whether we could make a superior predictor 
by arithmetically adding response to HRK to that of MS1 ( 
P 
 = 
0.0049;  
Fig. 2E 
). This  
post hoc 
 metric was a good binary predic-
tor of staying on venetoclax more than 30 days; the AUC of the 
receiver operating characteristic was 1.0 ( 
Fig. 2F 
).

 Venetoclax in Treatment of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
OCTOBER  2016�CANCER DISCOVERY | 1113 
 
BCL2 family protein expression has been previously evalu-
ated as a predictor of clinical response to BH3 mimetics with 
mixed success ( 
27–30 
). We analyzed the predictive capacity 
of protein expression of BCL2, BCL-X 
L 
 and MCL1, and BH3 
profi
 ling, and evaluated putative predictors of response. The 
fi
 ndings of the current study provide evidence that veneto-
clax acts as originally described, through on-target BCL2 
inhibition and subsequent induction of apoptosis ( 
Fig. 3 
; 
ref.  
5 
). BCL2 family protein expression at screening identifi
 ed 
patients with a BCL2 family sensitive or resistant index. Four 
patients with a BCL2 family sensitive index experienced clini-
cal benefi
 t, by achieving either an objective response, anti-
leukemic activity that did not meet IWG criteria, or longer 
durations on venetoclax therapy. 
 
 
BH3 profi
 ling has been used in AML to predict response 
to novel agents ( 
31, 32 
) and to identify primary cells from 
patients with AML sensitive to BCL2 inhibition ( 
7, 11 
). In 
this study, BH3 profi
 ling identifi
 ed patient samples most 
sensitive to BCL2 inhibition by venetoclax. The performance 
of the  
post hoc 
 receiver operating characteristic analysis indi-
cates that BH3 profi
 ling warrants further testing as a predic-
tive assay for venetoclax sensitivity. Dependence on BCL2 
does not seem to be suffi
 cient for prolonged clinical sen-
sitivity to venetoclax; rather, AML blasts also need to lack 
dependence on the resistance factors BCL-X 
L 
 and MCL1. 
This suggests that the best predictor of sustained response 
to a BCL2 inhibitor as a single agent is the lack of read-
ily accessible resistance mechanisms provided by BCL-X 
L
and MCL1. These results also suggest that dependence on 
individual antiapoptotic proteins is more heterogeneous in 
AML than in CLL, in which dependence on BCL2 is relatively 
homogeneous ( 
33 
). 
 
Relapsed/refractory AML in the elderly population has 
an extremely poor prognosis, with overall survival less than 
6 months. The 19% objective response rate plus additional 
examples of myeloblast reduction observed in this study, with 
a relatively well-tolerated oral single agent, is a promising 
clinical achievement. Response rates in this population vary 
greatly based on prognostic factors, ranging from 10% to 85%. 
However, remission rates greater than 20% are rarely obtained 
without the application of intense cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens requiring extended inpatient care ( 
34–36 
). There 
is potential for improvement in the response rate with the 
use of predictive biomarkers to identify and select patients 
responsive to venetoclax therapy. 
 
In summary, this phase II study demonstrated pharmaco-
logic activity of venetoclax as a single agent in AML with an 
acceptable safety profi
 le. These results, along with preclini-
cal data with venetoclax in combination with other agents 
( 
9, 37, 38 
) and observations that AML stem cells may be 
dependent on BCL2 ( 
7, 9, 10 
), support evaluating venetoclax 
in combination with other agents in patients with AML. 
Venetoclax is currently being investigated in phase I studies 
in combination with low-dose cytarabine (NCT02287233) 
and decitabine or azacitidine (NCT02203773). Prelimi-
nary results from clinical trials in treatment-naïve elderly 
patients with AML with combinations of venetoclax and 
hypomethylating agents suggest that response rates com-
parable to standard induction therapy can be obtained with 
tolerable toxicity ( 
39 
).

AML cells ( 
26 
). Four (33%) patients with  
IDH1/2 
 mutations 
achieved objective responses with venetoclax. Three patients 
with  
IDH1/2 mutations had concomitant  
FLT3- 
ITD muta-
tions, a known adverse prognostic factor; these patients did 
not achieve response and had shorter durations on veneto-
clax (Supplementary Table S1). Our data provide evidence 
that AML with  
IDH1/2 mutations exhibits BCL2 dependence 
and validates preclinical data that suggest suppression of 
cytochrome  
c oxidase activity in  
IDH1/2 mutant AML lowers 
the mitochondrial threshold to trigger apoptosis upon BCL2 
inhibition ( 
7, 8, 26 
). However, activity observed in patients 
with wild-type  
IDH1/2 suggests targeting BCL2 with vene-
toclax should not be restricted to patients with mutations 
in  
IDH1 
/2. The number of patients in our study is relatively 
small, and further studies are required to draw full conclu-
sions regarding the clinical activity of venetoclax in patients 
with  
IDH1/2 
 mutations.

METHODS 
 
Patients 
 
Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory AML by the World Health 
Organization classifi
 cation or untreated AML unfi
 t for intensive ther-
apy; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance score 0–2; 
adequate organ function [creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min, aspartate 
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤3.0 × ULN (upper 
limit of normal), bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN]; and did not meet exclusion 
criteria including white blood cell count >25 × 10 
9 
/L (hydroxyurea 
permitted to lower count), unresolved ≥grade 2 clinically signifi
 cant 
nonhematologic toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, other active 
malignancy within 1 year before study entry, major organ dysfunc-
tion, active infections, or pregnancy or breastfeeding. 
 
This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and was approved by an Institutional Review Board at each 
participating institution. Informed consent was obtained from all 
patients. 
 
 
Study Design and Treatment 
 
Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of venetoclax 
monotherapy in patients with AML enrolled between December 31, 
2013, and April 5, 2014 (NCT01994837). The study used a Simon two-
stage optimal design (Supplementary Fig. S3). Nineteen patients were 
to be enrolled and treated with venetoclax monotherapy in the fi
 rst 
stage. If ≥5 patients achieved an objective response by revised IWG 
criteria (CR, CRi, or partial response; ref.  
40 
) in an interim analysis 
after at least 12 weeks of therapy, the second stage would begin and 
enroll an additional 35 patients. The sample size was determined with 
90% power at a type 1 error rate of 0.05 with an uninteresting response 
rate of 20% and an interesting response rate of 40%. During execution 
of the trial, 13 eligible patients were in the screening process when the 
interim analysis of stage one began. Patients were allowed to initiate 
treatment before completion of the stage one interim analysis due to 
the disease severity and prognosis of these patients without available 
options for therapy. A total of 32 patients were enrolled. Enrollment 
stopped after the fi
 rst stage, and no additional patients were screened 
or treated after the interim analysis was completed. 
 
To mitigate risk of TLS ( 
12 
), a stepwise ramp-up of venetoclax 
dosing was used to achieve the target venetoclax dose (800 mg). Oral 
venetoclax was administered daily beginning with 20 mg on week 
1 day 1, and escalated daily to 50 mg on day 2, 100 mg on day 3, 
200 mg on day 4, 400 mg on day 5, and 800 mg on day 6 (and 800 
mg daily thereafter). Patients were hospitalized in the fi
 rst week of 
therapy (day 1 until at least 24 hours after reaching the target dose) 
and received hydration (oral and intravenous) and treatment with a 
uric acid–reducing agent. Blood chemistries were performed on the 
fi
 rst day of dosing and each day of a new dose at 0 (within 4 hours 
before dosing), 8, and 12 hours, and at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the 
fi
 rst 800-mg dose. 
 
Dose interruption, reduction, or continuation at the current level 
was permitted if toxicities were observed. Dose escalation to 1,200 mg 
daily was allowed if CR or CRi was not achieved at fi
 rst assessment 
(end of week 4) and 800 mg was tolerable. Patients continued daily 
venetoclax until unacceptable toxicity or progression. Supportive 
treatment, including anti-infection prophylaxis and growth factor 
support, was allowed at the investigator’
s discretion. 
 
Assessments 
 
Responses were evaluated using the revised IWG guidelines for 
AML; hematologic responses were also evaluated ( 
40 
). The overall 
response rate by IWG criteria included CR/CRi. Patients without 
clinical or cytologic progressive disease who did not achieve IWG 
response were considered to have stable disease. Bone marrow aspi-
rate and biopsy were performed at screening, end of week 4, and every 
8 weeks thereafter. AEs were graded according to National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
CTCAE; version 4.0). Physical exam, vital signs, and clinical labora-
tory tests were performed at screening and throughout the study. 
Clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs was monitored routinely 
throughout the study and for 30 days following discontinuation of 
study drug. 
 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected 8 hours post-dose after 
the fi
 rst dose 
 and the fi
 rst day of each new dose level. Intensive vene-
toclax pharmacokinetic samples (0–8 hours) were collected at week 6 
day 1. For the intensive pharmacokinetic days, venetoclax C 
max 
, the 
time to C 
max 
 (peak time), and AUC 
0-24 
 were determined using non-
compartmental methods. 
 
 
 
BCL2 Family Protein Analysis 
 
Pretreatment bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood sam-
ples for BCL2 family protein mutational analysis were collected 
and analyzed. The presence of mutations in genes associated with 
hematologic malignancies was determined in baseline specimens 
using two next-generation sequencing panels: the Trusight Myeloid 
panel (Illumina) for 31 of 32 patients and the FoundationOne 
Heme panels (Foundation Medicine) for 15 patients. Two millilit-
ers of peripheral blood were added to freshly prepared 1× Lyse/Fix 
buffer (BD Biosciences) in a 1:40 ratio. The sample was inverted 
5 to 8 times, incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, and frozen at 
−70°C. Prior to testing, the specimens were thawed at 37°C, fi
 ltered 
through a 45-μm fi
 lter 
, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes,

The data cutoff for this report was January 22, 2015, when all 
patients had discontinued. Analyses were specifi
 ed in a statistical 
analysis plan. Descriptive statistics including medians, ranges, and 
SDs were calculated. Effi
 cacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic analyses 
were performed on all patients who received at least 1 dose of veneto-
clax. Assessments at screening served as baseline unless repeated on 
week 1 day 1 before dosing. All statistical analyses were performed 
using SAS version 9, and all plots were generated using GraphPad 
Prism Software version 6.05. The Kaplan–Meier method was used 
for time-to-event analyses. Data for leukemia-free survival were cen-
sored at the date of last disease assessment or date of fi
 rst dose plus 
1 day for patients without any disease assessments. Overall survival 
was censored at the date of last study visit or last known date to be 
alive, whichever was later. Correlations were analyzed with one-tailed 
Spearman rank-order correlation tests. 
 
 
 
Study Oversight and Role of Funding Source 
 
 
The study protocol was designed by the sponsors (AbbVie and 
Genentech) in collaboration with the investigators and approved 
by local Institutional Review Boards. The study was conducted 
according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the International 
Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice. Each 
patient provided signed informed consent. Study investigators 
and their research teams collected clinical data; AbbVie confi
 rmed 
and compiled the data. Authors had access to the data and agreed 
to submit the manuscript for publication. Manuscript drafts 
were prepared with assistance from a professional medical writer 
employed by AbbVie.
