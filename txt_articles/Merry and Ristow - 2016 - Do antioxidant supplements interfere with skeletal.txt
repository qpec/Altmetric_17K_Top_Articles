Abstract A popular belief is that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species
(RNS) produced during exercise by the mitochondria and other subcellular compartments
ubiquitously cause skeletal muscle damage, fatigue and impair recovery. However, the importance
of ROS and RNS as signals in the cellular adaptation process to stress is now evident. In an effort to

Troy Merry obtained his PhD from the University of Melbourne investigating the role or reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in regulating skeletal muscle glucose uptake
during exercise. He is now a post-doctoral research fellow at the ETH Zurich and his research focuses
on understand the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic disease and metabolic adaptation to
exercise, and the involvement of ROS in this regard.
Michael Ristow’s research is focused on the
biochemical and molecular basis of longevity – in particular the role played by mitochondria in lifespan
regulation and prevention of metabolic diseases. Contrary to the widely re-iterated Free Radical Theory
of Ageing, Ristow was the first to show that the health-promoting effects associated with low caloric
intake, physical exercise and other lifespan-extending interventions like sirtuin signalling are caused by
increased formation of reactive oxygen species within the mitochondria, causing a vaccination-like adaptive response that culminates in increased stress
resistance and extended longevity, a process called mitohormesis.

reported to have deleterious effects on the response to overload stress and high-intensity training,
suggesting that remodelling of skeletal muscle following resistance and high-intensity exercise is
more dependent on ROS/RNS signalling. Importantly there is no convincing evidence to suggest
that antioxidant supplementation enhances exercise-training adaptions. Overall, ROS/RNS are
likely to exhibit a non-linear (hormetic) pattern on exercise adaptations, where physiological
doses are beneficial and high exposure (which would seldom be achieved during normal exercise
training) may be detrimental.

Abstract figure legend Acute exercise increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen
species (RNS), which contribute to the signalling of skeletal muscle adaptations that occur with training. Preventing
ROS/RNS stress during exercise through antioxidant supplementation could potentially impair the adaptation process.
ROS/RNS are likely to exhibit a hormetic effect on skeletal muscle adaptations during exercise, with physiological
increases promoting, and very low or very high exposure potentially hampering adaptation.

Reactive oxygen species and exercise training
Regular exercise improves the function of multiple organs
in the human body, and reduces the risk of developing
diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
cancer and dementia, and by that increases life expectancy
(Warburton et al. 2006). One of the most plastic and
responsive organs to exercise training is skeletal muscle
(Bassel-Duby & Olson, 2006). Physiological stress applied
throughrepeatedboutsofacuteexercise(training)induces
skeletal muscle adaptations that improve the muscles
ability to deal with future exercise stress, and the potential
to cope with other similar stressors which may be
associated with disease development. Adaptations that
occur in skeletal muscle in response to exercise training
are dependent on the parameters of the exercise stress
applied, with resistance training promoting hypertrophy
and endurance training having greater effects on muscle
oxidative capacity (Bassel-Duby & Olson, 2006). One of
the many stressors that are imposed through exercise is an
increased exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Powers & Jackson, 2008).
During exercise skeletal muscle ROS are produced
from both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial sources,
which include xanthine oxidases, NADPH oxidases and
phospholipase A2, while the parent RNS nitric oxide
(NO) comes from NO synthase (NOS) (Powers & Jackson,
2008). Under most exercise conditions oxidative balance
is maintained within physiological limits, minimizing
the potential for oxidative damage (Powers & Jackson,
2008). This is achieved by a multifaceted antioxidant
defence system that consists of antioxidant enzymes such
as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione
peroxidases (Gpx), peroxiredoxins and thioredoxins that
reduce ROS, and endogenous antioxidant substrates like
glutathione that scavenge ROS and RNS (Powers &
Jackson, 2008). Traditionally, however, exercise-induced
ROS has been seen as an unavoidable by-product of
increased oxidative metabolism that impairs muscle
function and causes oxidative damage. This notion
coupled with the association between oxidative stress
(where ROS production is continuously greater than anti-
oxidant capacity) (Sies, 1985), tissue damage and disease
has led to the popular dogma that ROS and RNS produced

during exercise are detrimental to health and muscle
function. As such, supplements that have the potential to
reduceROSlevelsaremarketedfortheir‘healthpromoting
antioxidant properties’ (Fig. 1). It has become common
practice for athletes and health conscious physically active
individuals to chronically supplement their normal diet
with high doses of antioxidants including vitamins C
(ascorbic acid) and E, α-lipoic acid, selenium, amino acids
and coenzyme Q10 (Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2008b), but this
practicemayactuallybehamperingnormalskeletalmuscle
adaptation process (Fig. 1).
ROS and RNS are important molecular messengers
that act through direct revisable interactions with
redox-sensitive proteins to specifically regulate many
physiological processes including insulin sensitivity, vaso-
dilatation, mitochondrial biogenesis, immune response
and growth factor signalling (Grodstein et al. 2013;
Chandel & Tuveson, 2014; Ristow, 2014; Yun & Finkel,
2014). The laboratory of Michael Reid was the first to
show a non-liner relationship between ROS production
and muscle function (Reid, 2001), with basal and physio-
logical increases of ROS being required for optimal
skeletal muscle force production, and higher levels being
associated with a decline in function and oxidative
damage. This is consistent with hormesis, whereby
favourable biological adaptations occur in response to
low continuous or higher intermitted exposure to a
stressor that would be harmful at large or chronic doses
(Ristow, 2014; Yun & Finkel, 2014). Indeed, antioxidants
can ameliorate adaptions in cellular defences induced
by ROS (Ristow, 2014), making the cell less tolerant
of subsequent stress. It is, therefore possible that anti-
oxidant supplementation during exercise training may
negate favourable adaptations brought about through
exercise-induced increases in ROS and RNS (Fig. 1).

Antioxidant supplementation and skeletal muscle
adaptations to exercise training
Antioxidant treatment modifies skeletal muscle signalling
during and immediately following a single bout of exercise
and this can result in alterations in glucose uptake,
force production, sodium–potassium pump function,
mitochondrial biogenesis markers and insulin sensitivity
(Powers & Jackson, 2008). Transient induction of acute
signalling in response to an exercise stress is required
for exercise training adaptations; however, antioxidants
effects on a single bout of exercise may be over-
come by training. This review focuses primarily on
whether chronic antioxidant supplementation affects
exercise training-induced skeletal muscle adaptations. We
have also limited ourselves to studies that have utilised
supplements whose primary function is ROS or RNS pre-
vention. As such, polyphenols and flavonoids with anti-
oxidant properties like resveratrol and epigallocatechin
gallate, which rather act as indirect antioxidants or may
have additional antioxidant-independent effects, are not
considered.
Antioxidants defences
Exercise acts as an antioxidant by up regulating end-
ogenous antioxidant defence (Gomez-Cabrera et al.
2008b). Since oxidative stress is associated with the
pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including diabetes,
cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative
diseases, the natural antioxidant effect of exercise is
likely to be one of the mechanisms underlying the
health-promoting benefits of regular exercise. However, if
this is the case then why does antioxidant supplementation
appear not to affect, or may even increase, the incidence
of disease in humans (Ristow, 2014)? The answer may
relate to the types of antioxidants supplemented, which
are normally generalized, non-target scavengers of all
ROS such as vitamin C and E. In contrast to these
universal ROS-scavenging antioxidants, our endogenous
regulation of cellular redox status relies on a complex
and compartmentalized network of ROS producing and
eliminating systems (Powers & Jackson, 2008). These
systems allow for discrete, controlled localized production
of specific types of ROS. Disruption of this system by
over-supplementation with exogenous generalised anti-
oxidants will not only affect potentially harmful ROS/RNS
but also ROS/RNS-related signalling that is required
for cellular adaptation. In contrast, exercise and other
stressors are likely to regulate antioxidant responses in a
more specific manner, negating possible unwanted effects
of non-discriminately scavenging ROS/RNS.
One of the early focuses of antioxidant supplementation
on skeletal muscle adaptions was the antioxidant response
to exercise. Work from several independent laboratories

has provided data that antioxidant supplementation
during an acute bout of exercise in humans or rodents,
or the disruption of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α; a central mediatory
of exercise adaptation; Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2008b),
can attenuate exercise-induced increases in skeletal
muscle
antioxidant
gene
expression.
Since
then
a
number of groups have assessed whether antioxidant
supplementation during training reduces the normal anti-
oxidant effect of exercise.
In rodents, supplementation with various general anti-
oxidants during endurance training has been shown to
attenuateincreasesinGpx,SODandperoxiredoxinmRNA
levels (Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2008a; Meier et al. 2013), but
effects on antioxidant protein or activity levels are less
commonly observed (Strobel et al. 2011). This perhaps
suggests that assessing gene expression at a single time
point is insufficient to determine changes at the protein
level during exercise training protocols. Supplementation
with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol alone
does not appear to be sufficient to alter training-induced
increases in SOD1 or SOD2 mRNA levels (Wadley et al.
2013). During very strenuous exercise training (6 h
day−1) vitamin C/E supplementation does not appear
to affect short-term training (3 days) increases in SOD1
or SOD2 protein expression (Higashida et al. 2011), but
does attenuate increases in catalase and Gpx activities
and suppresses reductions in SOD activity associated
with longer duration strenuous training (6 days week−1,
8 weeks) (Chang et al. 2007).
Surprisingly few studies have thoroughly assessed
whether
antioxidant
supplementation
in
humans
influences exercise training-induced alterations in anti-
oxidant capacity. Ristow et al. (2009) reported that
vitamin C/E supplementation during 4 weeks of end-
urance training attenuated increases in skeletal muscle
SOD1, SOD2 and Gpx1 mRNA levels. However, Yfanti
et al. (2010) did not observe any effect of vitamin
C/E supplementation on increases in muscle SOD2
protein expression following 12 weeks of training, while
Cumminings et al. (2014b) saw little effect of either
exercise training or antioxidant supplementation on
Gpx1 or SOD2 expression. It appears, therefore, that
antioxidant supplementation is detrimental to acute
exercise antioxidant response and can impair endurance
training-induced increases in antioxidant enzyme mRNA
levels, but the effects on endogenous antioxidant enzyme
activitiesandproteinlevelsfollowingtrainingarenotclear.
Exercise performance
Successful exercise training enhances the ability of the
body to deal with the physiological stress of a given
exercise task, and thus allows the task to be completed
more efficiently. Improvements in exercise performance,
especially by competitive athletes, are often used to
determine the success of a training programme. Studies
showing that antioxidant treatment can delay fatigue
of skeletal muscles contracted in vitro and in situ and
during electrically stimulated contractions in humans has
prompted the investigation of antioxidants as ergogenic
aids (Reid, 2001; Lamb & Westerblad, 2011). Through
studying isolated muscle and muscle fibres, ROS and RNS
have been shown to alter the contractile apparatus Ca2+
sensitivity (Lamb & Westerblad, 2011). The conditions of
muscle contraction (muscle type, ROS levels, contraction
protocol and temperature) influences the effect ROS
has on Ca2+ sensitivity and determines if antioxidants
promote or impair skeletal muscle contraction force
(Powers & Jackson, 2008; Lamb & Westerblad, 2011).
The effect antioxidant supplementation has on acute
in vivo exercise performance is difficult to interpret due
to the diverse exercise protocols employed, and different
types of antioxidants and supplementation procedures
utilised. An in-depth analysis on the topic is beyond the
scope of this review and readers are referred to Powers
& Jackson (2008) and Braakhuis & Hopkins (2015).
Suffice it to say that there are a handful of studies that
have reported acute antioxidant supplementation can
enhance performance of a single bout of exercise, but
most have yielded negative results showing no effect
or even impairment of performance. In general, those
that have reported antioxidants to improve performance
employed fatiguing-type exercise and supplementation
either immediately before or during exercise, while
the adverse effect of antioxidants on performance
are more commonly associated with longer duration
(several days or longer) supplementation protocols, the
exception being that longer supplementation period may
be beneficial during tournament-type situations, where
multiple high-intensity exercise sessions are completed in
close succession (Cobley et al. 2011).
Although there may be some evidence to support
acute antioxidant supplementation immediately prior to
certain types of acute exercise where performance is
important, it is far more common practice for athletes
to continuously take antioxidants during training. The
premises for this is that antioxidants will reduce muscle
damage and fatigue, thus boosting recovery (although this
may not be the case; see Recovery section) and allowing
improved training in subsequent sessions. Several studies
have assessed the effect of antioxidant supplementation
on short-term training-induced increases in performance.
Overall, the results have been disappointing for those
that market antioxidants as a training supplement,

Endurance performance. In humans the improvement
in maximal oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2max) achieved with
4–12 weeks of training appears not to be affected
by supplementation with vitamin C (Gomez-Cabrera
et al. 2008a; Roberts et al. 2011), or a combination
of vitamins E and C (Yfanti et al. 2010; Paulsen
et al. 2014a). While ˙
VO2max measures maximal aerobic
capacity,itdoesnotalwaysreflectenduranceperformance,
which is commonly assessed with work or time trials,
or time to exhaustion during fixed intensity exercise.
Although Comez-Cabrera et al. (2008a) showed that
vitamin C supplementation blocked improvements in
endurance capacity in rats following 6 weeks of training,
improvements in human (Roberts et al. 2011; Braakhuis
et al. 2014) and mouse (Abadi et al. 2013; Meier et al. 2013)
endurance performance appears not to be greatly affected
by antioxidant supplementation during training. These
contrasting results may reflect species-specific exercise
adaptation processes, or be a result of different antioxidant
supplementation protocols utlised. Gomer-Cabrera et al.
(2008) used 500 mg kg−1 day−1 vitamin C, while
the
human
studies
used
a
much
lower
dose
of
13–16 mg kg−1 day−1, and mouse studies employed
antioxidant cocktails containing such antioxidants as
N-acetylcysteine, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10. It is
also worth noting that some studies have reported what
appeared to be reduced performance during the training
itself (Braakhuis et al. 2014) and blunted reductions in
physiological stress (Sharman et al. 1971; Paulsen et al.
2014a) when exercise training is combined with vitamin
C/E supplementation. In contrast, Asha Devi et al. (2003)
reported that vitamin E supplementation during 12 weeks
ofswimmingtrainingimprovesendurancecapacityofrats.
Unfortunately, these results are difficult to interpret since
endurance capacity was not assessed prior to the exercise
training intervention, and only three rats were used per
group. Interestingly, Aguilo et al. (2007) observed that
3 months of daily supplementation with vitamin E and
β-caroteneleadtogreatertraining-inducedimprovements
in anaerobic threshold; however, this did not translate
to improved performance as determined by ˙
VO2max or
maximal work output trial.
High intensity and resistance exercise performance.
While there is little evidence to suggest that antioxidant
supplementation affects training-induced improvements
in endurance performance, several studies have reported
a detrimental effect of antioxidant supplementation on
high-intensity exercise performance. This may suggest
that ROS are more pivotal in regulating adaptations to
high-intensity exercise. Indeed, this would fit with the
observation that higher levels of ROS are produced during
more intense muscle contractions (Pattwell et al. 2004),
and that improvements in exercise performance that have
been seen following acute antioxidant supplementation
are generally associated with highly fatiguing exercise
(Medved et al. 2004; Matuszczak et al. 2005; McKenna
et al. 2006). In two separate studies Malm et al. (1996,
1997) report that supplementation with the antioxidant
coenzyme Q10 during short-term training attenuated
increases in peak and mean power output for repeated
bouts of 10 s all-out cycling. This is consistent with
the observation that greyhound racing dogs ran slower
during 500 m races over 4 weeks when supplemented
with vitamin C (Marshall et al. 2002). However,
vitamin C supplementation was not seen to affect training
improvements in intermitted high-intensity shuttle runs
(Roberts et al. 2011), suggesting less of a role of ROS in
intermittent endurance exercise training adaptations.
Recently, Paulsen et al. (2014b) assessed the effects of
daily supplementation with a combination of vitamins
C and E on strength following 10 weeks of resistance
training. They showed that antioxidant supplementation
attenuated increases in upper body strength, and a similar
trend was noted for maximal voluntary contractions in the
lower body. However, this does not appear to be a universal
finding and may apply more to concentric-type exercise
since vitamin C/E supplementation does not affect iso-
metric knee extension performance following eccentric
exercise training (Theodorou et al. 2011) or strength
gains during resistance training in the elderly (Bobeuf
et al. 2011), while improvements in muscle function were
reported in old rats supplemented with vitamin E during
exposure to 4.5 weeks of repetitive muscle loading (Ryan
et al. 2010).

and 2 (ERK1/2), AMPK, and several transcription factors

However, whether this suppression of acutely regulated
mitochondrial biogenesis markers translates to impaired
exercise training-induced increases in mitochondrial
biogenesis is less clear.
In 2008 Gomez-Cobrera et al. (2008a) published
the first study linking antioxidant supplementation
to impaired exercise training-induced mitochondrial
biogenesis. They, and subsequently others (Strobel et al.
2011), showed that daily antioxidant supplementation in
rats during treadmill training prevented increases in hind-
limb muscle mitochondrial biogenesis markers (including
PGC1α, mtTFA, NRF1) as well as mitochondrial protein
and activity levels. Since the initial observations that
antioxidants can blunt training-induced increases in
mitochondrial biogenesis, several other rodent studies
have
reported
antioxidants
not
to
affect
exercise
training-induced increase in mitochondrial biogenesis.
Antioxidant treatment of mice was shown to suppress
acute
exercise
and
some
exercise
training-induced
increasesinmitochondrialbiogenesismarkers(Abadietal.
2013; Meier et al. 2013); however, this did not affect
exercise training-induced increases in mitochondrial mass
(Abadi et al. 2013; Meier et al. 2013). In agreement,
Wadley et al. (2013) recently reported that allopurinol (an
xanthine oxidase inhibitor) attenuates acute exercise, but
not exercise training-induced increases in mitochondrial
biogenesis. While initial studies in rats combined anti-
oxidant supplementation only during exercise training
(Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2008a; Strobel et al. 2011),
Higashida et al. (2011) examined the effect of vitamin
C/E supplementation for 5 weeks prior to, and during
3 weeks of very high volume (6 h day−1, 6 days week−1)
swimming training. They report that supplementation
did not affect increases in triceps mitochondrial proteins.
Possibly this suggests that both the type of antioxidant
employed (general vs. targeted) and duration of treatment
(pre-treatment vs. treatment only during training) and/or
volume of training are factors determining the effect
antioxidant supplementation has on exercise training
adaptations.
Soon after antioxidant supplementation was reported
to
impair
mitochondrial
biogenesis
in
rodents
(Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2008a), Ristow et al. (2009)
reported that in humans vitamin C/E supplementation
during exercise training attenuated increases in PGC1α
mRNA. This work has recently been supported by
Paulsen et al. (2014a) who showed that endurance
training-induced increases in PGC1α protein and the
mitochondrial protein cytochrome oxidase 4 expression
were prevented by vitamin C/E supplementation. In
contrast, Yfanti et al. (2010) report that vitamin C/E
supplementation during 12 weeks of cycling training does
not affect increases in citrate synthase activity. Although
no mitochondrial biogenesis markers or protein levels
were reported, this suggests that mitochondrial volume
was not affected by antioxidants.
Nitric oxide can promote mitochondrial biogenesis;
however, its role in exercise-induced mitochondrial
biogenesis is not clear. In muscle cells the NOS
inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME) can attenuate
increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers stimulated
by compounds that mimic exercise stress such as
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
ribonucleotide
(AICAR; an AMPK activator) and caffeine (which
stimulates calcium release) (McConell et al. 2010).

attenuate exercise-induced increases in the downstream
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis mtTFA in some
muscles (Wadley & McConell, 2007). It must be noted
that potentially NO may only be required from one of the
NOS isoforms to effectively modulate exercise-induced
mitochondrial
biogenesis.
Unfortunately,
the
effect
neuronal or endothelial NOS disruption has on training
adaptations has only been assessed following short-term
(9 day) training that had little effect on mitochondrial
biogenesis (Wadley et al. 2007).
The discrepancy in the effect of antioxidants on exercise
training-induced mitochondrial biogenesis could suggest
that there is redundancy in the mitochondrial biogenesis
signalling allowing, in certain conditions, for defects
in ROS signalling brought about through antioxidant
supplementation to be overcome. As such the extent to
which mitochondrial biogenesis is affected by antioxidant
supplementation could depend on numerous factors
including duration and timing of supplementation, type
of antioxidant and parameters of the training protocol.
Insulin sensitivity
Regular physical exercise improves glucose regulation by
transiently enhancing insulin sensitivity for several hours
following a single bout of exercise, and by inducing
adaptations that result in longer-term improvements in
glucose homeostasis. There has been limited research
into whether antioxidants affect acute exercise- or
exercise training-induced increases in insulin sensitivity.
Ristow et al. (2009) provided evidence that vitamin C/E
supplementation in humans during short-term (4 weeks)
exercise training can impair improvements in insulin
sensitivity, as assessed by glucose infusion rates during
a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp. However, this
effect appears to be overcome by longer-term training,
with Yfanti et al. (2011) reporting that vitamin C/E
supplementation does not affect enhancement of insulin
sensitivity or expression of insulin signalling-related
proteins following 12 weeks of endurance training. In rats,
Higashida et al. (2011) observed that three consecutive
days of 6 h exercise training enhanced glucose transporter
4expressionandexvivoinsulin-stimulatedglucoseuptake,
and this was not affected by vitamin C/E supplementation.
However, the short-term very high volume nature of the
training protocol questions whether the effects were the
result of normal exercise training adaptations.
In two separate studies, Saengsirisuwan et al. (2001;
2004) has shown that the antioxidant α-lipoic acid
in combination with exercise training has an additive
effect on enhancing insulin-mediated ex vivo glucose
uptake of muscle from genetically obese Zucker rats. This
suggests that exercise training and α-lipoic acid have a
synergistic effect on improving insulin sensitivity in obese
rats, and that under conditions of obesity α-lipoic does
not interfere with exercise training-induced adaptations
that enhance insulin sensitivity. In partial agreement,
vitamin C supplementation in rats fed a high-fat diet
does not affect training-induced enhancement in insulin
sensitivity (Picklo & Thyfault, 2015).
Interesting,
ROS
have
been
implicated
in
the
enhancement of insulin sensitivity following an acute bout
of exercise. Loh et al. (2009) showed that the enhancement
in insulin sensitivity seen acutely following exercise is
augmented in mice that do not express the antioxidant
enzyme Gpx1, an effect that was abolished by treatment
with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. This may suggest
that enhancing ROS promotes, while decreasing ROS via
antioxidant supplementation may attenuate, post-exercise
enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Indeed, it has recently
been reported that infusion of N-acetylcysteine to humans
during exercise attenuates post-exercise insulin sensitivity
(Trewin et al. 2015)
Hypertrophy
Much of the research regarding antioxidants and exercise
training has focused on endurance adaptions. However,
recent studies have sought to determine the effect anti-
oxidant supplementation may have on overload-induced
muscle hypertrophy in rodents and humans. Makanae
et al. (2013) found that hypertrophy induced in the
plantarismusclethroughthesurgicalremoveofsynergistic
muscles (mechanical overload model) was attenuated by
daily vitamin C supplementation. In humans vitamin
C/E supplementation during resistance training does
not appear to affect hypertrophy in young participants
(Paulsen et al. 2014b), while in older participants
vitamin C has been report to attenuate gains in lean
mass seen during 12 weeks (Bjornsen et al. 2015),
but not 6 months, of resistance training (Bobeuf
et al. 2011). Furthermore, antioxidant supplementation
reduces hypertrophy signalling (namely phosphorylation
of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and p70S6 kinase) and strength
gains in muscle following resistance exercise (Makanae
et al. 2013; Paulsen et al. 2014b).
Through the use of the plantaris mechanical over-
load model and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
null mice, Ito et al. (2013) has provided a mechanism
through which antioxidants can impair muscle hyper-
trophy. They show that following muscle overload, NO
interacts with superoxide (produced by NADPH oxidase
4) to generate peroxynitrite. The latter then acts via
transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily
V, member 1 and Ca2+ signalling to induce hyper-
trophy via the activation of mTOR and downstream
target p70S6 kinase. As such, NOS inhibition and
several different antioxidants were shown to severally
attenuate overload-induced hind-limb muscle hyper-
trophy. Therefore, antioxidant supplementation during

resistance training could potentially blunt signalling of
adaptive hypertrophy.
Muscle recovery
Antioxidant
supplements
are
often
taken
during
exercise training in an effort to reduce exercise-related
oxidative stress damage and hasten recovery. Experiments
conducted in situ and ex vivo have shown that the
parental ROS, superoxide, plays a role in the impairment
of muscle force production at submaximal intensities
following a series of maximal contractions. The over-
expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme
SOD2, or treatment with reducing agents has been
shown to improve short-term recovery in muscle
function (Powers & Jackson, 2008; Lamb & Westerblad,
2011). In support, supplementation with the antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine attenuates deterioration in performance
of repeated bouts of high-intensity intermittent exercise
(Cobley et al. 2011). Therefore, there is some evidence
to support supplementing with antioxidants when
optimal muscle performance is required following
short recovery intervals, where muscle adaptation is
inconsequential.
Antioxidants can prevent protein oxidation during
exercise (Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2005); however, there
is
little
in
vivo
evidence
to
suggest
that
anti-
oxidant
supplementation
is
sufficient
to
attenuate
exercise-induced muscle damage or improve recovery
during longer rest periods. Several studies have monitored
plasma creatine kinase (CK; an index of muscle damage)
following a single bout of exercise (Malm et al. 1996;
Teixeira et al. 2009) or exercise during training (Avery et al.
2003). Surprisingly, the majority report that antioxidant
supplementationaugmentedexercise-inducedincreasesin
plasma CK levels (Childs et al. 2001; Close et al. 2006;
Bailey et al. 2011; Cobley et al. 2011). Some (Close et al.
2006)butnotall(Baileyetal.2011)foundthatthisresulted
in delayed recovery in muscle function, but did not appear
to affect ratings of muscle soreness (Close et al. 2006;
Bailey et al. 2011), while treatment with the NOS inhibitor
L-NAME may delay muscle regeneration following acute
eccentric exercise (Sakurai et al. 2013).
In contrast to the effects on CK levels, there is
evidence that antioxidant supplementation can attenuate
exercise-induced increases in inflammatory markers and
cytokines (Peake et al. 2007) including interleukin 6
(IL-6)andtumournecrosisfactor(TNF)(Vassilakopoulos
et al. 2003; Fischer et al. 2004), although this is
not seen by all (Aguilo et al. 2007; Teixeira et al.
2009; Yfanti et al. 2010; Bailey et al. 2011). Muscle
injury-associated inflammation can cause pain but the
up-regulation of inflammatory mediators is essential for
muscle regeneration (Arnold et al. 2007). It is questionable
whether blunting of the inflammatory response to
exercise by antioxidants is beneficial to long-term muscle
adaptation. In agreement, Yfanti et al. (2010) report that
exercise training induced decreases in circulating IL-6,
and muscle mRNA levels were attenuated by vitamin E/C
supplementation suggesting that normal exercise training
modulation of cytokine levels is modified by antioxidant
supplementation.
Other exercise-mediated adaptations
Fibre
type
transition. An
important
adaptation
to
training is the transition between fibre types, with end-
urance training promoting the transition of fast-type
anaerobic fibres to slower contracting more oxidative
fibres. One of the mechanisms controlling this fibre
type transition is the nuclear translocation of nuclear
factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), which can regulate
the isoform-specific regulation of the contractile protein
myosin heavy chain (MHC) (Bassel-Duby & Olson,
2006). There is evidence to suggest that NO can regulate
NFATc1 nuclear accumulation and this increases the
expression of the slow oxidative MHC-I. Importantly,
the ingestion of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME during
10 days of low-intensity muscle stimulation prevents
faster to slower muscle fibre transition in rodents
(Martins et al. 2012). It must be noted, however,
that chronic low-intensity stimulations applied to the
peroneal nerve for 12 h day−1 result in substantial
fibre type transitions, and shifts of this magnitude
are not seen during normal in vivo exercise training.
Therefore, whether antioxidants prevent fibre type trans-
itionsduringexercisetraininginhumans,andwhetherthis
accounts for antioxidant-induced impairments in end-
urance training adaptations need to be investigated in
detail.
Heat-shock proteins. Acute non-damaging concentric
exercise increases skeletal muscle heat-shock protein
(HSP)
levels,
and
increased
HSP
expression
may
confer some of the cytoprotective effect of exercise
training. Several groups have shown that antioxidant
supplementation attenuates increase in HSPs in response
to acute exercise (Khassaf et al. 2003; Fischer et al.
2006). There appears to be little effect of exercise
training or the combination of exercise training and anti-
oxidant supplementations on basal HSP expression. One
study (Cumming et al. 2014a) has examined whether
antioxidant supplementation affects training-induced
alteration in HSP response to acute exercise. Cyto-
solic HSP27 levels following acute exercise were seen to
decrease in the antioxidant but not the placebo group.
Unfortunately, the effect that the acute exercise protocol
had on HSP27 levels prior to training was not assessed
making it difficult to interpret the interaction between
training and antioxidant supplementation.

Transcriptions factors. Exercise activates transcription
factors that control how skeletal muscle adapts (Fig. 2).
ROS can activate transcription factors by direct oxidation
or through interactions with upstream protein targets.
Several transcription factors have been identified as
being sensitive to alterations in cell redox status that
occur during exercise. PGC1α is viewed as a key
regulator of skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise, and
antioxidant supplementation can impair acute exercise
and exercise training-induced increases in PGC1α and
other mitochondrial biogenesis transcription factors (see
Mitochondrial biogenesis section). The transcription
factors NF-κB and NFE2L2 also appear to be both
redox and exercise sensitive (Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2008b;
Narasimhan et al. 2014). NF-κB and NFE2L2 have
been suggested to regulate exercise-induced changes
in endogenous antioxidant expression and cellular
defences. Indeed, treatment with allopurinol can attenuate
exercise-induced increases in NF-κB in both rodents and
humans (Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2005, 2008b). Disruption
of NFE2L2 interferes with skeletal muscle antioxidant
responses to exercise (Narasimhan et al. 2014), whereas
antioxidant supplementation does not affect increases
in NFE2L2 skeletal muscle protein concentration that
occur with training (Wadley et al. 2013). Overall there is
building evidence that antioxidant supplementation can
affect exercise activation of transcription factors; whether
supplementing with antioxidants during training alters

Figure 3. Non-linear/hormetic effects of ROS/RNS on exercise

Lower doses of ROS/RNS exert beneficial effects, whereas theoretical
high ROS/RNS exposure (which would rarely be achieved during
training) would impair training adaptations and performance.
Antioxidant supplementation during an exercise task that results in
an increase in ROS/RNS production which promotes training
adaption and improves performance would be detrimental (blue and
green bars, respectively). However, if the exercise task resulted in
ROS/RNS exposure that exceeds this level then antioxidant
supplementation may potentially be beneficial. We suggest that the
level of ROS/RNS stress required to reduce performance would be
lower than what would be necessary to hamper training adaptation.
the post-training response to acute exercise has received
little attention.
Angiogenesis. Exercise training induces angiogenesis,
increasing capillary density of skeletal muscle, and
allows for enhanced blood flow and therefore oxygen
(O2) delivery. Although antioxidant supplementation
can impair exercise-mediated vasodilatation and O2
delivery (Copp et al. 2009), exercise-induced increases
in mRNA for vascular endothelial growth factor, a
central regulator of angiogenesis, are not affected by
supplementation with antioxidants (Hellsten et al. 2007).
Interestingly, Wary et al. (2009) report that exercise
training-induced improvements in exercising blood
pressure and flow-mediated dilatation were prevented by
acute antioxidant supplementation prior to exercise. This
may suggest that training enhances ROS regulation of local
blood flow during exercise and this is prevented by anti-
oxidant supplementation.
Limitations and future directions
To date most studies that have assessed the effect of
antioxidant supplementation on muscle signalling and
training adaptations have focused on aerobic endurance
exercise. More recent studies, however, have begun to
provide evidence of a potential negative role of antioxidant
supplementation on resistance training adaptations, while
few have investigated muscle adaptation in response to
anaerobic training.
Global antioxidants, which act by non-specifically
scavenging all free radicals, and include vitamin C/E as
well as coenzyme Q and lipoic acid, have most often been
used in this field of research. This is partly due to these
antioxidants being the most commonly utilised by the
public, but also because they are easily obtainable for
use in research. Given the discrete compartmentalized
nature of ROS signalling, to really understand the
effect ROS and antioxidants are having on particular
training adaptions more targeted approaches are required.
Allopurinol has been utilized to examine the role of
xanthine oxidase-produced ROS in the exercise response,
and impairments in acute signalling (Gomez-Cabrera
et al. 2005; Wadley et al. 2013) but not training-induced
adaptation (Wadley et al. 2013) have been reported. Pre-
venting ROS derived from the NADPH oxidase enzyme
impairs overload-induced muscle adaptation (Ito et al.
2013), and mitochondrial targeted antioxidants can
protect against muscle atrophy (Min et al. 2011). However,
the effects of antioxidants that target the NADPH oxidases,
mitochondria and other ROS production sites have on
exercise-induced adaptions has received little attention.
An alternative approach to organelle-specific anti-
oxidants is to utilize genetic rodent models that
allow the tissue-specific overexpression or disruption of

endogenous
antioxidant,
respectively,
to
assess
the
potential role of ROS in mediating exercise-training
adaptation. In addition, antioxidants that are targeted to
the mitochondria are available, at least for non-human
studies (Murphy & Smith, 2007). These approaches would
help to address questions such as what type, location
of production and target sites of ROS are important for
training adaptations, and what are the best types of anti-
oxidants to use to enhance performance and recovery
without blunting training responses.
Summary
Taken together, the effect antioxidant supplementation
has on skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise training
is still equivocal. While there is no convincing evidence
to support antioxidant supplementation in regards to
training adaptations, there is a growing body of literature
suggesting it may hamper or prevent the signalling of
important adaptations such as muscle mitochondrial
biogenesis, insulin sensitivity and hypertrophy. This is
consistent with hormesis where stressors induce ROS
that act as intracellular signalling molecules to promote
adaptations that equip the cell to better tolerate future
stress (Fig. 3). It is theoretically possible that antioxidants
may aid exercise training if the exercise stress was sufficient
to chronically elevate ROS to levels which impair function
and cause damage; however it is unlikely that such levels
would be achieved solely through exercise training (Fig. 3).
This does not preclude the potential for acute antioxidant
supplementation to enhance performance of certain
types of exercise where following adaptive responses are
irrelevant. The level of ROS required to impair muscle
performance is likely to be lower than that which would
hamper muscle adaption (Fig. 3). Given the potential for
antioxidants to suppress some training adaptations with
little evidence to suggest any positive effects, the authors
tend to reject the use of such supplements.
