Abstract
After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, the air dose gra-
dually decreases every year due to the physical decay of radioactive materials
and environmental changes, as well as countermeasures. However, there is
little information on personal behavioural patterns and individual dose from
external exposure among the inhabitants around the nuclear power plant. To
evaluate the dose from external exposure in Minamisoma city, and compare
the differences with outside Fukushima Prefecture, we started the external

 dose assessment project in cooperation with city officials in Minamisoma and
three other cities in Japan where the natural terrestrial background radiation
level is relatively high. In these four cities, external dose was measured every
hour for two weeks using an individual electronic dosimeter D-shuttle. The
places of activity of participants were recorded every hour to compare and
evaluate the dose from external exposure, and to clarify whether there is a
difference in the exposure dose by behaviour. The annual effective doses from
external exposure for 100 participants from four municipalities ranged from
0.566 to 1.295 with a mean value of 0.784 mSv, which was below the level
where it is necessary to initiate further remedial actions. Mean external dose in
Minamisoma city (0.820 mSv/year) was comparable to those in municipalities
with a relatively high natural radiation background in Japan (0.793, 0.806, and
0.718 mSv/year in Fukuyama, Nanto, and Tajimi, respectively). The time
spent at home and in the workplace accounted for most of the time of the
participants, and this also contributed to the majority of the total dose from
external exposure. The amount of exposure at times other than while at home
or in the workplace was very small regardless of the indoor or outdoor location
in the city. For future dose reduction and radiation protection, continuous
dosimetry and countermeasures at home and in the workplace are important
for individuals who present high values.

Introduction
Radiation exposure can result in long-term health risks, such as tumors, depending on indi-
vidual doses [1]. Health threats have emerged in radioactively contaminated areas after
nuclear accidents, such as the 1986 Chernobyl accident [2]. Cumulative exposure is a serious
public concern in Fukushima, particularly among children, who may face future health risks
[3]. To control doses of cumulative exposure following a major radiation-release accident,
reduction of chronic exposure, which accounts for the majority of total radiation exposure, is
of great importance [4].
Chronic exposure is classified as internal or external. While the total dose from both
internal and external exposure is a crucial risk factor for radiation-related health outcomes,
individual levels of internal contamination are influenced not only by radionuclide soil
deposition, soil properties, and land use in residential areas, but also by dietary habits [5, 6].
Thus, food regulation and identification of high-risk residents who regularly consume highly
contaminated local food products are of particular importance [7]. In contrast, individual
doses from external exposure depend on air dose rates in residential areas, dwelling type,
occupation category, and the locations where people spend long periods of time on a daily
basis [8, 9]. Although such features are common with doses from external exposure, adequate
detailed information on when and where residents received the majority of the dose, and the
amount of external dose at places where people spend long hours, is unavailable.
After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, which followed the Great East
Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, internal exposure among residents in radioactively
contaminated areas appears to have been marginal, owing to the quick and strict response by

274
 the Japanese central government and local authorities [4] and to local soil properties. With
respect to external exposure, the air dose gradually decreases every year due to the physical
decay of radioactive materials and environmental changes, as well as countermeasures, such
as decontamination [10, 11]. Large-scale individual external dose monitoring using radio-
photoluminescence glass dosimeters (Glass Badge) revealed that the annual dose from
external exposure gradually decreased in local municipalities around the nuclear power plant
[12–14]. However, external dose monitoring only measures the total dose from external
exposure over a certain period of time, typically three months, and adequate information on
when and where the residents received the majority of the dose, is unavailable.
In response to such a situation, researchers introduced an individual dosimeter D-shuttle,
which can measure the external dose per hour [15, 16]. Adachi et al [17] showed that there is
no major difference between external doses among high school students in Fukushima pre-
fecture and those in other areas. While they reported dose differences between the high school
students’ homes and schools, they did not provide detailed information on the amount of
external dose that contributed to the total dose as a result of spending long periods of time in
these places, nor on the difference in the amount of doses at such places and that at other
places.
Minamisoma city is located 10–40 km north of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
plant, and an evacuation order was issued immediately after the accident for part of the city
(Odaka-ku), which was within the 20 km radius of the plant. As the air dose rates in Min-
amisoma gradually decreased, the evacuation order of Odaka-ku was lifted (approximately
five years after the accident), and the residents gradually returned. However, there is little
information on personal behavioural patterns and dose from exposure among the inhabitants.
Under the direction of the mayor of Minamisoma, we evaluated the relationship between the
dose from external exposure and behavioural patterns in Minamisoma city. For this, we
started the external dose assessment project in cooperation with city officials in Minamisoma
and three other cities in Japan, where the natural terrestrial background radiation level is
relatively high (figure 1). In these four cities, external dose was measured using the D-shuttle
for two weeks, and the places of activity of participants were recorded every hour to compare
and evaluate the dose from external exposure, and to clarify whether there is a difference in
the radiation dose by behaviour.
This study analyzes the result of the dose assessment project using the D-shuttle
described above. The objectives of this research are as follows: (1) to evaluate the dose from
external exposure in Minamisoma city and compare the differences with other municipalities;
and (2) to evaluate the dose by behaviour, and determine whether it is different for each
municipality.
Materials and methods
Data and setting
The measurements were taken by the city employees of the four municipalities in Japan
(Minamisoma city in Fukushima Prefecture, Fukuyama city in Hiroshima Prefecture, Nanto
city in Toyama Prefecture, and Tajimi city in Aichi Prefecture) (figure 1). Twenty-five city
employees participated in the study from each municipality, and the total number of parti-
cipants was 100. The measurements period was two weeks, from May 29, 2017 to June 11,
2017. Minamisoma city is located 10–40 km north of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
The residences of the Minamisoma participants were evenly scattered throughout the city:
eight in Odaka-ku (previous evacuation area), eleven in Harumachi-ku (equivalent to an
J. Radiol. Prot. 38 (2018) 273

275
 emergency evacuation preparation area or indoor restriction area), and six in Kashima-ku
(equivalent to outside of the evacuation area). In the other three cities, to prevent the deviation
of doses, consideration was given so that the residences were evenly scattered throughout the
city. The three municipalities other than Minamisoma city are located outside Fukushima
Prefecture, and are outside the region contaminated by radioactive materials dispersed from
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. However, these municipalities are located in the
region where the natural terrestrial background radiation level is relatively high in Japan. In
order to avoid the difference of the shielding factor by their dwellings, participants whose
houses were made of wood were selected in all four study areas.

 Individual dosimeter D-shuttle
The D-shuttle is an individual electronic dosimeter jointly developed by the National Institute
of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and Chiyoda Technol Corporation. A
2.7×2.7 mm2
silicon
sensor
is
mounted
on
the
instrument
measuring
68 mm
(height)×32 mm (width)×14 mm (depth). It is possible to measure and record the dose
from external exposure every hour using the D-shuttle [18].
The result of the D-shuttle measurement was expressed as the personal dose equivalent at
a tissue depth of 1 cm (Hp (10)). Hp (10) values obtained in the affected areas in Fukushima
Prefecture are comparable with the effective dose of isotropic or rotation irradiation geo-
metries [19]. In addition to doses from radioactive materials from the nuclear accident, such
as Cs-134 and Cs-137, the doses from natural radiation sources, including the universe
(cosmic rays) and radioactive compounds within the Earth, were measured using the
D-shuttle.
Each device was calibrated using the Cs-137 calibration source for Hp (10), according to
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 4037-3). The relative response was
30% (60 keV–1.25 MeV), and the least detectable value was 0.01 μSv/h.
During the screening, participants were instructed to always carry their dosimeters and
hang the device from the neck, which measured their doses from external exposure for two
weeks. The dosimeters were then returned to the city office, and the measured values were
read using a dedicated instrument (D-shuttle Reader, Chiyoda Technol Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). The number of data points per participant was 24 h×14 d=336, and the total
number of data points of the 100 participants were 33 600.
Behavioural records of participants
Using the questionnaire, each participant recorded their activities every 30 min. These records
were then classified into seven categories: workplaces (in the city hall); houses (home); indoors,
within the city; outdoors, in the city; during transit from one place to another; outdoors, outside
the city; and indoors, outside the city. To estimate the difference in dose by behaviour in
regression, behaviour records were categorized as five variables: home, workplace, inside the
city other than home and work (indoors within the city and outdoors in the city), during transit,
and outside the city (outdoors outside the city and indoors outside the city).
Annual dose calculation for external exposure
The annual effective doses of study participants from external exposure were estimated using
the following methods. We first summed 336 data points to calculate the dose for two weeks,
and then divided the two-week dose measurements by the total measurement period (i.e. 14
days), which was then multiplied by 365. In the present study, we did not consider the
seasonal effects of participant’s behaviour, or weather such as snowfall, on annual dose.
Outlier value management
Although the D-shuttle is well protected from external electromagnetic noise and mechanical
vibration, occasional malfunction of the device is unavoidable, as was demonstrated in a
previous study [17]. Typically, an isolated large spike of external dose is observed in the
readout data. The outlier was set at 0.5 μSv/h, which is more than five times the average dose
of a total of 33 600 measurements. In such cases, based on the behaviour record and participant
interviews, we examined whether the spike was caused by the radiation. When calculating the
J. Radiol. Prot. 38 (2018) 273
M Tsubokura et al
277
 average value (and standard deviation) of individual doses, we used the measured outlier
values as is. Meanwhile, we excluded outliers in the regression model to improve the fit of the
model.
Analysis
To investigate whether there is a difference in the external dose in the four municipalities, and
whether the external dose is influenced by the participant’s behaviour, the following analyzes
were performed.
First, the mean and standard deviation of the two-week measured values and annual
doses of 25 participants were calculated for each municipality. We performed pairwise
comparisons using z-test statistics with Bonferroni corrections to elucidate the difference in
the two-week measured values in the four municipalities.
Second, we used a mixed-effects multilevel linear regression model with Bonferroni
correction to detect any differences in doses after adjustment for behaviours, time, and
municipalities.
Since every participant underwent repeated measurements, the regression models
included a random effect at an individual level to control for the fact that the same indivi-
dual’s data were correlated. An interaction term of ‘behaviour’ and ‘municipality’ variables
was considered in the regression model because a municipality-level difference in the effects
of behaviours on external dose was expected.
Ethics
The Institutional Review Board of Minamisoma Municipal General Hospital approved the
study (authorization number 29-06), and written informed consent was obtained from all 100
participants.
Results
Difference in two-week doses from external exposure in the four municipalities
Table 1 presents the average and standard deviation of the measured values for two weeks.
Figure 2 presents a box-plot diagram of the annual effective dose from external exposure for
25 participants in the four municipalities. While the individual doses from external exposure
for 100 participants ranged from 0.566 to 1.295 with a mean value of 0.784 mSv/year, the
mean external dose in Minamisoma city (0.820 mSv/year) was comparable to those in
municipalities with a relatively high natural radiation background in Japan (0.793, 0.806, and
0.718 mSv/year in Fukuyama, Nanto, and Tajimi, respectively). The results in Minamisoma

 city largely varied compared to those in the other three municipalities. Although the max-
imum amount of exposure was 1.295 mSv/year in Minamisoma city, the minimum value
(0.570 mSv/year) was lower than that in Fukuyama and Nanto (0.669 and 0.608 mSv/year,
respectively). Pairwise comparisons of the measured values for two weeks between the four
municipalities showed significantly lower values in Tajimi city than those in Minamisoma
(p=0.01) and Nanto (p=0.04); the differences were 3.9 and 3.4 μSv for two weeks,
respectively.
Figure 3 presents the trends of the average dose with 95% confidence intervals over the
two weeks. Dose varied depending on the time and day of the week. Although measurement
values during daytime in Minamisoma and Fukuyama cities on weekdays (i.e. from day one
to five, and from day eight to twelve) were lower compared to those during nighttime, the
difference in dose between day and night was reversed in Nanto city. These dose differences
between day and night was unclear on the weekend (i.e. days 6, 7, 13, and 14). This finding
may be attributable to the fact that participants spent most of their time staying within the city
in the office during the daytime on weekdays.
External dose by municipality and behaviour
Table 2 presents the results of behaviour and the average doses from external exposure over
the two weeks. The proportion of time spent by place for the two weeks differed slightly
depending on municipality (chi-squared p<0.001). There was a tendency to spend a longer
time at home in Minamisoma city than in other municipalities. In Fukuyama city, the time
spent outside the city was short, and in Nanto city the time spent indoors within the city other
than in the workplace and at home was short. In Tajimi city, time spent in the workplace was

 shorter than that in the other three municipalities; however, there was a tendency to spend
more time outdoors in the city.
Although time spent by behaviour for each municipality differs to some extent, the time
spent at home and in the workplace (56.9% and 24.0%, respectively) accounted for most of
the time in all four municipalities. While the average of the total dose among all participants
was 30.1 μSv for two weeks, average doses in the workplace and at home, where a long time
is usually spent, were 17.6 μSv and 7.4 μSv. These values account for the majority of the total
dose, and the amount of exposure at times other than at these two is within a few μSv,
regardless of being indoors or outdoors in the city, or outside the city. This trend was similar
in all four municipalities.
Table 3 presents regression estimates of the differences in the mean personal dose
equivalent rate between municipalities, adjusted for covariates, such as behaviours, time and
the interaction term of ‘behaviour’ and ‘municipality’. Of 33 600 measurements, 11 (two from
Minamisoma, two from Fukuyama, and seven from Tajimi) were omitted from the regression.
There was a statistically significant difference in external dose between Tajimi and Nanto
cities (p<0.05), and between Tajimi and Minamisoma cities (p<0.05); the differences
were 0.011, and 0.010 μSv/h, respectively.
In addition, regression estimates of the municipality-level difference in the mean personal
dose equivalent rate between behaviours (home versus the others), adjusted for covariates, is
presented in table 4. Differences in doses between indoors and outdoors differ depending on
the municipality. Minamisoma and Fukuyama had a significantly large difference in doses
depending on behaviour, while Nanto and Tajimi had less dose differences due to behaviour.
As for the dose difference between home and the workplace, where participants spent the
most amount of time, doses for Minamisoma and Fukuyama tended to be higher at home than

intervals) of 25 participants over the two-week time period.

 at home and at work tended to be lower than doses at home (p=0.001, p<0.001, and
p<0.001 in Minamisoma, Fukuyama, and Tajimi, respectively). The dose outside the city
tended to be lower than that at home, and the differences were statistically significant in
Minamisoma (p<0.001) and Fukuyama (p<0.001) cities. The dose during transit tended
to be lower than that when at home, and the differences were statistically significant in
Minamisoma (p<0.001) and Fukuyama (p<0.001).
Discussion
This study showed that the external doses of individuals living in Minamisoma city who were
exposed to radioactive contamination from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant
accident were comparable to those of individuals living in municipalities with a relatively
high natural radiation background in Japan. The mean total dose from external exposure were
below 1 mSv/year, which is the lowest reference level of existing exposure situations among
the public within the band of 1–20 mSv/year, following the recommendation by the Inter-
national Commission on Radiation Protection [20]. This study suggested that external doses
among residents living in Minamisoma city were reduced to a level where it is not necessary
to initiate further remedial actions, presumably due to the physical decay of radioactive
materials, weathering effects, and countermeasures, such as decontamination.
Of note, the standard deviation of the dose in Minamisoma city was larger than that in the
other three municipalities, although the average value in Minamisoma city was comparable to
that in the other three municipalities. This finding suggested that individual doses from
external exposure in a radio-contaminated area may be more variable than those in regions
with relatively high natural background radiation. One possible reason for this is that the
distribution of radio-contamination is strongly influenced by environmental factors, such as
fallout timing, weathering, and topography; thus, the radiation level tends to be more uneven
than the distribution of environmental radiation, and high contamination remains in some
areas. Despite all participants having the same job in this study, such a variation of individual
doses was observed. Although the mean dose from external exposure among all participants
was below 1 mSv/year, if their occupation and lifestyle were different, the variation of
external doses could be large, and there could be some individuals with higher doses.
Therefore, attention should be paid when applying this result to the entire population, and it is
important to identify residents with higher doses in Minamisoma city. Future continuous
monitoring may be necessary for such individuals.
Participants spent most of their time at home and in the workplace, and this also con-
tributed to the majority of the total dose from external exposure. In all four municipalities, the
dose at work and at home was approximately 80% of the total dose. The amount of exposure
at times other than that in these two situations was very small, within a few μSv over the two
weeks, regardless of the indoor or outdoor location in the city, or outside the city. Since the
doses at home and in the workplace contribute to the majority of the dose, dose control at
home and in the workplace is important for controlling the overall radiation dose. When
radioactive contamination occurs, and it is necessary to lower the radiation dose of residents,
it is effective to firmly monitor exposure at places such as the home, workplace, and schools;
preferential countermeasures should be taken to reduce the dose rate in such environments.
However, although residents may request further dose reduction, despite the measures taken
to reduce doses at home or in the workplace, it may not be possible to conduct further dose
reduction. In such cases, continuous counseling, dialog, and administrative intervention are
necessary. On the other hand, since the proportion of total doses in environments other than

 the workplace and home is small, decontamination at such places may not be effective for
dose reduction; however, it may be effective for reducing anxiety. Future research is
necessary to establish a balance between anxiety reduction and cost.
Of note, while homes and workplaces are the most exposed, doses in these two places
differed depending on the municipality. These differences appear to be due to the location of
the city hall and houses and the composition of building materials. The home and workplace
are places where people receive the majority of doses, and which dose is higher is very
important when considering countermeasures to lower the total radiation dose.
There are several limitations of this study. First, this study was conducted with 100 city
officials. Since the behavioural pattern and the area of activity are different from those of
other occupations and age groups, this result cannot be generalized to all residents in each
municipality. Second, compliance with the proper use of the dosimeter could be low among
participants; however, a previous study suggests that possible improper use of the dosimeter
by participants had little to no demonstrable effect on the accuracy of the recorded mea-
surements [21].
Conclusion
The external dose of individuals living in Minamisoma city six years after the Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear power plant accident was comparable to that of individuals living in muni-
cipalities with a high natural radiation background in Japan. However, the standard deviation
of the dose in Minamisoma city is larger than that in other cities, presumably because high
contamination areas still exist in some areas. Thus, it is necessary to identify individuals who
exhibit relatively high doses and take appropriate measures if deemed justified. The dose at
places where long periods of time are spent, such as the home or workplace, accounts for the
majority of the total external dose. For future dose reduction and radiation protection, con-
tinuous dosimetry and countermeasures at such places are important for individuals who
present high values.
