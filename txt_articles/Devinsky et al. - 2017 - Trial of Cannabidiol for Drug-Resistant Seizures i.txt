BACKGROUND
The Dravet syndrome is a complex childhood epilepsy disorder that is associated with 
drug-resistant seizures and a high mortality rate. We studied cannabidiol for the treat-
ment of drug-resistant seizures in the Dravet syndrome.
METHODS
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 120 children and 
young adults with the Dravet syndrome and drug-resistant seizures to receive either 
cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 
placebo, in addition to standard antiepileptic treatment. The primary end point was the 
change in convulsive-seizure frequency over a 14-week treatment period, as compared 
with a 4-week baseline period.
RESULTS
The median frequency of convulsive seizures per month decreased from 12.4 to 5.9 with 
cannabidiol, as compared with a decrease from 14.9 to 14.1 with placebo (adjusted 
median difference between the cannabidiol group and the placebo group in change in 
seizure frequency, −22.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −41.1 to −5.4; 
P 
= 
0.01). The percentage of patients who had at least a 50% reduction in convulsive-
seizure frequency was 43% with cannabidiol and 27% with placebo (odds ratio, 2.00; 
95% CI, 0.93 to 4.30; P 
= 
0.08). The patient’s overall condition improved by at least one 
category on the seven-category Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale in 62% of 
the cannabidiol group as compared with 34% of the placebo group (P 
= 
0.02). The fre-
quency of total seizures of all types was significantly reduced with cannabidiol 
(P 
= 
0.03), but there was no significant reduction in nonconvulsive seizures. The per-
centage of patients who became seizure-free was 5% with cannabidiol and 0% with 
placebo (P 
= 
0.08). Adverse events that occurred more frequently in the cannabidiol 
group than in the placebo group included diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, somno-
lence, and abnormal results on liver-function tests. There were more withdrawals from 
the trial in the cannabidiol group.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with the Dravet syndrome, cannabidiol resulted in a greater reduction in 
convulsive-seizure frequency than placebo and was associated with higher rates of adverse 
events. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02091375.)

S
eizures are difficult to control in 
the Dravet syndrome, a rare genetic form 
of epileptic encephalopathy primarily due 
to loss-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene. 
Interest in cannabidiol for the treatment of epi-
lepsy was generated by media reports of efficacy 
in children with the Dravet syndrome.1 Four small 
trials of cannabidiol had yielded mixed results.2-5 
A series of in vitro and in vivo preclinical models 
of seizure showed that cannabidiol had activity 
against convulsive seizures.6 Subsequently, the 
safety and effectiveness of a standardized oral 
solution of cannabidiol was tested in an open-
label trial involving 214 children and young 
adults with drug-resistant epilepsy.7 We conducted 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial of cannabidiol to treat drug-resistant epi-
lepsy in the Dravet syndrome.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
This was a multinational, randomized, double-
blind trial of adjunctive cannabidiol versus pla-
cebo in children and young adults 2 to 18 years 
of age with the Dravet syndrome whose seizures 
were not controlled by their current antiepileptic-
drug regimen. The trial comprised a 4-week base-
line period, a 14-week treatment period (2 weeks 
of dose escalation and 12 weeks of dose main-
tenance), a 10-day taper period, and a 4-week 
safety follow-up period. The trial was approved 
by the review board or ethics committee at each 
participating institution and was conducted in 
accordance with the principles of the Declara-
tion of Helsinki and the International Confer-
ence on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines. All the patients or their parents or 
legal representatives provided written informed 
consent, and children mature enough to under-
stand the trial provided assent. Patients could 
withdraw at any point without prejudice.
The funding source, GW Pharmaceuticals, was 
responsible for the trial design (with input from 
investigators and other experts), trial manage-
ment, site monitoring, trial pharmacovigilance, 
data analysis, and statistical analysis. GW Phar-
maceuticals prepared and provided the active 
treatment and placebo. Trial procedures were 
reviewed at multisite investigator meetings. Ser-
vices were used for clinical laboratory testing; 
bioanalytical laboratory testing; design of the 
case-report form; data management; trial-agent 
distribution, returns, and destruction; the inter-
active voice-response system; diagnosis of the 
Dravet syndrome and seizure classification; and 
translation of documents. The authors vouch for 
the accuracy and completeness of the reported 
data and analyses and for the adherence of the 
trial to the protocol (available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org). The authors affirm 
that they approved the final draft of the manu-
script.
Patients were eligible if they had an estab-
lished diagnosis of the Dravet syndrome, were 
taking one or more antiepileptic drugs, and had 
had four or more convulsive seizures during the 
28-day baseline period. An independent review 
of the previously documented diagnosis of the 
Dravet syndrome and the classification of seizure 
type was conducted for each patient by an inde-
pendent panel appointed by the Epilepsy Study 
Consortium, under a standard protocol (see the 
protocol). All medications or interventions for 
epilepsy, including a ketogenic diet and vagus-
nerve stimulation, were stable for 4 weeks before 
screening and were to remain unchanged 
throughout the trial. The dose of cannabidiol 
used in the trial was recommended by an inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring committee 
(see the protocol), whose members reviewed 
data from a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic and 
safety evaluation of three doses of cannabidiol 
(5, 10, and 20 mg per kilogram of body weight 
per day) and identified the maximum dose that 
was safe and was not associated with unaccept-
able side effects.
Procedures
After informed consent was obtained, patients 
entered a 4-week baseline period. The investiga-
tor trained the caregiver to record daily seizure 
information. Patients who satisfied all eligibility 
criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive cannabidiol or matching placebo, in ad-
dition to their stable antiepileptic-drug regimens. 
Cannabidiol oral solution contained 100 mg of 
cannabidiol per milliliter. The placebo solution 
was identical to the cannabidiol solution except 
for the absence of cannabidiol. The dose was 
escalated up to 20 mg per kilogram per day (or 
the equivalent volume of placebo) with the use 
of a 14-day dosing regimen that was approved 
by the data and safety monitoring committee.

Cannabidiol for Seizures in the Dravet Syndrome
All doses were administered twice daily. At the 
end of the treatment period, the cannabidiol and 
placebo solutions were tapered (10% each day) 
over a period of 10 days. After trial completion, 
all patients could enter a long-term open-label 
study.
Each day, patients or their caregivers recorded 
the number and type of convulsive seizures 
(tonic, clonic, tonic–clonic, or atonic) for the 
primary end-point measure of convulsive-seizure 
frequency, using an interactive voice-response 
system. Clinical laboratory assessments were 
performed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, and 14 
weeks of the trial regimen, as well as at the end 
of the taper period for those patients who did 
not enter the open-label extension study or who 
withdrew early and tapered the trial agent.
End Points
The primary end point was the percentage change 
per 28 days from the 4-week baseline period in 
convulsive-seizure frequency during the 14-week 
treatment period among patients who received 
cannabidiol as compared with placebo. The 
treatment period extended from randomization 
to the end of the 14-week trial or the date of the 
last dose. The maintenance period extended from 
the end of the 2-week dose-escalation period to the 
end of the 14-week trial or the date of the last 
dose. The intention-to-treat analysis set included 
all patients in the safety analysis set who had 
postbaseline efficacy data.
The secondary end-point measures were the 
Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CGIC), 
assessed on a 7-point Likert-like scale that used 
three categories of improvement (slightly im-
proved, much improved, or very much improved), 
three categories of worsening (slightly worse, 
much worse, or very much worse), and an option 
of “no change”; the number of patients with a 
reduction in convulsive-seizure frequency of at 
least 25%, at least 50%, at least 75%, and 100%; 
reduction in total seizure frequency and reduc-
tion of seizure subtypes; the duration of seizure 
subtypes, as assessed by the Caregiver Global Im-
pression of Change in Seizure Duration (CGICSD) 
on a 3-point scale (decrease, no change, or in-
crease in average duration); sleep disruption, 
assessed on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 
10, with higher scores indicating greater disrup-
tion; the change in the score on the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (range, 0 to 24, with higher 
scores indicating greater daytime sleepiness); 
the score on the Quality of Life in Childhood 
Epilepsy questionnaire (range, 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating better function); the 
age-standardized score on the Vineland Adaptive 
Behavior Scales, second edition (Vineland-II; 
range, 20 to 160, with higher scores indicating 
better behavioral adaptation); the number of hos-
pitalizations due to epilepsy; the number of pa-
tients with the emergence of seizure types that 
had not occurred during the baseline period; 
and the use of rescue medication.
The safety profile of cannabidiol was assessed 
on the basis of the number, type, and severity of 
adverse events as well as the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (for patients ≥6 years of 
age, when appropriate), vital signs, electrocardio-
graphic variables, laboratory safety variables, and 
physical examination variables; safety end points 
were monitored at each visit. The palatability of 
the trial agents was assessed by caregivers on a 
5-point scale, ranging from “liked it a lot” to 
“did not like it at all.”
Statistical Analysis
A total of 100 randomly assigned patients were 
planned. We calculated that this sample size 
would provide 80% power to detect an absolute 
difference of 32 percentage points between groups 
in the primary end point in an intention-to-treat 
analysis, with a standard deviation of 56% and a 
two-sided significance level of 5%. Randomiza-
tion was performed and assigned independently, 
held centrally, and not divulged to any other per-
son involved in the trial until after database lock.
Analysis of the primary end point was per-
formed with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test. An estimate of the median difference be-
tween cannabidiol and placebo, together with 
the 95% confidence interval, was calculated with 
the use of the Hodges–Lehmann approach. Sen-
sitivity analyses of this primary end point were 
prespecified in the trial protocol and statistical 
analysis plan.
The percentage of patients with a reduction in 
convulsive-seizure frequency from baseline of at 
least 25%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or 100% 
was analyzed with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–
Haenszel test and presented with odds ratios. 
The changes from baseline in the CGIC and the 
CGICSD were analyzed with the use of an ordi-
nal logistic-regression model. For the secondary

Results
Trial Population
At 23 centers in the United States and Europe, 
177 patients were screened and 120 underwent 
randomization (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the 
trial groups were similar (Table 1). The mean 
age of the patients was 9.8 years (range, 2.3 to 
18.4), and 52% were male. The baseline convul-
sive-seizure frequency was a median of 13.0 
seizures per month (range, 3.7 to 1717). A total 
of 108 patients (90%) completed the treatment 
period (52 of 61 patients [85%] in the cannabi-
diol group and 56 of 59 patients [95%] in the 
placebo group). A total of 12 patients (10%) 
withdrew from the trial before completion (9 in 
the cannabidiol group and 3 in the placebo 
group). Of the 108 patients who completed 
the trial, 105 entered the open-label extension 
study.
Patients had previously tried a median of 4.0 
antiepileptic drugs (range, 0 to 26) and were tak-
ing a median of 3.0 (range, 1 to 5). The most 
common were clobazam (65%), valproates (all 
forms, 59%), stiripentol (42%), levetiracetam 
(28%), and topiramate (26%). The most common 
type of convulsive seizure was generalized tonic–
clonic, in 94 patients (78%), with secondarily 
generalized tonic–clonic seizures in 25 patients 
(21%) and other convulsive-seizure types less 
frequently. Nonconvulsive seizures were reported 
in 37 patients in the cannabidiol group (61%) 
and 41 patients in the placebo group (69%). 
Developmental delay was observed in 114 of the 
118 children with available data and was de-
scribed as severe or profound in 56 (48%) and 
mild or moderate in 58 (50%).
Adherence to the data acquisition and voice-
response system was 97% for the cannabidiol 
group and 98% for the placebo group during the 
baseline period and 97% and 96%, respectively, 
during the treatment period. The mean (±SD) 
number of days on which a dose was missed was 
0.6±2.1 in the cannabidiol group and 0.6±2.9 in 
the placebo group.
Seizure Frequency
In the cannabidiol group, the primary end point 
of convulsive-seizure frequency decreased from 
a median of 12.4 seizures per month (range, 3.9 
to 1717) at baseline to 5.9 (range, 0.0 to 2159) 
over the entire treatment period (Table 2), repre-
senting a median change of −38.9% (interquar-
tile range, −69.5 to −4.8) from baseline. In the 
placebo group, the median monthly convulsive-
seizure frequency decreased from 14.9 (range, 
3.7 to 718) to 14.1 (range, 0.9 to 709), represent-
ing a median change of −13.3% (interquartile 
range, −52.5 to 20.2). The adjusted median differ-
ence in convulsive seizures between the canna-
bidiol group and the placebo group was −22.8 
percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 
−41.1 to −5.4; P 
= 
0.01). Prespecified sensitivity 
analyses supported the primary analysis (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). The difference in favor of cannabi-
diol was seen in the first month of the mainte-
nance period, during which the median number 
of convulsive seizures per month declined from 
12.4 to 5.0 in the cannabidiol group and from 
14.9 to 13.0 in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.002).
Secondary End Points
The results of the secondary end-point measures 
are shown in Table 3. The end point of a reduc-
tion in convulsive-seizure frequency by 50% or 
more during the treatment period occurred in 
43% of the patients in the cannabidiol group 
and in 27% of the patients in the placebo group 
(odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.93 to 4.30; P 
= 
0.08). 
During the treatment period, 3 patients in the 
cannabidiol group and no patients in the placebo 
group were free of seizures (P 
= 
0.08). For total 
seizures (all seizure types), the median frequency 
of seizures per month decreased from 24.0 to 
13.7 in the cannabidiol group (adjusted reduc-
tion, 28.6%), versus a decrease from 41.5 to 31.1 
in the placebo group (adjusted reduction, 9.0%). 
The adjusted median difference between groups 
of −19.2 percentage points was significant (P 
= 
0.03). 
For reduction in nonconvulsive seizures, there 
was no significant difference between groups 
(P 
= 
0.88). Rescue medication was used by 36 
patients (59%) in the cannabidiol group and by 
41 patients (69%) in the control group.
On the CGIC scale, 37 of 60 caregivers (62%) 
judged their child’s overall condition improved 
in the cannabidiol group, as compared with 20 
of 58 caregivers (34%) in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.02). There was no significant difference 
between groups in the sleep-disruption score

Cannabidiol for Seizures in the Dravet Syndrome
and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, suggesting 
that there was no negative effect of cannabidiol 
on sleep. The Quality of Life in Childhood Epi-
lepsy and Vineland-II scores showed no signifi-
cant difference between cannabidiol and place-
bo. Changes in individual seizure types and the 
number of patients with the emergence of sei-
zure types that had not occurred during the 
baseline period are reported in Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, Treatment Period, and Taper Period.
The primary reason that a patient in the cannabidiol group was withdrawn by an investigator on day 43 was non­
adherence to trial­agent dosing. However, this patient also had seven serious adverse events that emerged during 
treatment by day 32, resulting in discontinuation of the trial agent. The 29 patients in the cannabidiol group who 
continued to taper the dose included 3 patients who were withdrawn during the treatment period and who tapered 
the trial agent. The 5 patients in the cannabidiol group who completed the dose taper but did not enter the open­ 
label extension (OLE) study included 2 patients who were not eligible to enter the OLE study because they were 
withdrawn during the treatment period.

P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. P values for change in CGIC score and percentage change 
from baseline in seizure frequency were calculated with the use of a Wilcoxon rank­sum test. P values for reduction in convulsive seizures for 
baseline were calculated with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. P values for reduction from baseline in duration of seizure sub­
types were calculated with the use of ordinal logistic regression. P values for change from baseline in other variables were calculated with 
the use of an analysis of covariance. P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
‡  
Odds ratios for reduction in convulsive seizures from baseline were calculated with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. Odds 
 
ratios for reduction from baseline in duration of seizure subtypes were calculated with the use of ordinal logistic regression. Values greater 
than 1 are in favor of cannabidiol, and values less than 1 are in favor of placebo.

The number of patients in each category was as follows: reduction of 25% or more, 38 patients in the cannabidiol group and 26 patients 
in the placebo group; reduction of 50% or more, 26 and 16, respectively; reduction of 75% or more, 14 and 7; and 100% reduction, 3 and 
0. Because there were no patients in the placebo group with a 100% reduction, an odds ratio could not be calculated.

to be related to the trial agent, as compared with 
36% in the placebo group. In both groups, the 
first occurrence of an adverse event was most 
commonly reported during the 14 days of dose 
escalation. Common adverse events (>10% fre-
quency) in the cannabidiol group were vomiting, 
fatigue, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infec-
tion, decreased appetite, convulsion, lethargy, 
somnolence, and diarrhea (Table 4). In the canna-
bidiol group, 8 patients withdrew from the trial 
owing to adverse events, as compared with 1 in 
the placebo group. The most common adverse 
event was somnolence, reported in 22 patients 
(36%) in the cannabidiol group and 6 patients 
(10%) in the placebo group. Of the 22 patients in 
the cannabidiol group in whom somnolence was 
reported, 18 were taking clobazam, as compared 
with 5 of 6 patients in the placebo group. Ad-
verse events led to a dose reduction in 10 pa-
tients in the cannabidiol group. After dose re-
duction, the adverse events resolved completely 
in 8 patients and partially in 1 patient; in the 
remaining patient, the adverse event (loss of ap-
petite) was ongoing. There were few dose adjust-
ments of concomitant antiepileptic drugs during 
the trial.
Serious adverse events were reported in 10 pa-
tients in the cannabidiol group and 3 in the 
placebo group. Status epilepticus was reported 
in 3 patients in the cannabidiol group and 3 in the 
placebo group; none of these events led to with-
drawal from the trial, and none were deemed to 
be related to the trial agent. Elevated levels of 
liver aminotransferase enzymes (alanine amino-
transferase or aspartate aminotransferase level 
>3 times the upper limit of the normal range) 
led to withdrawal from the trial of 3 patients in 
the cannabidiol group and 1 in the placebo 
group. Overall, elevated aminotransferase levels 
occurred in 12 patients in the cannabidiol group 
and 1 in the placebo group. All these patients 
were taking a form of valproate. Shift tables (in 
which baseline clinical laboratory values were 
categorized as “low,” “normal,” or “high” and 
any shift between categories was noted for post-
baseline visits) confirmed that raised aminotrans-
ferase levels were more frequent in the canna-
bidiol group than in the placebo group. In the 
9 cases of raised aminotransferase levels in which 
the patient continued in the trial, the enzyme 
levels returned to normal while the patient was 
receiving cannabidiol. There were no other clin-
ically significant changes in clinical laboratory 
safety measures and no instances of suicidal 
ideation on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale in the 77 patients who completed the ques-
tionnaire. There were no deaths.
Discussion
The Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic early-onset 
encephalopathic epilepsy, with a high mortality 
rate,8 for which no antiepileptic drug has been 
approved in the United States. Convulsive sei-
zures are associated with the risk of sudden un-
expected death in epilepsy.9 This randomized, 
controlled trial showed that cannabidiol resulted 
in a greater reduction in convulsive-seizure fre-
quency than placebo among children and young 
adults with drug-resistant Dravet syndrome.
The screening criteria ensured that patients 
in the trial had severe epilepsy and met the Inter-
national League against Epilepsy definition of 
drug-resistant epilepsy.10 In this context, complete 
freedom from seizures was attained in three pa-
tients in the cannabidiol group and no patients 
in the placebo group during the entire treatment

Cannabidiol for Seizures in the Dravet Syndrome
period. An additional four patients were seizure-
free in the maintenance period, but three of them 
withdrew early from the trial.
The global impression of change is an end 
point used in epilepsy studies to indicate the 
clinical relevance of a reduction in seizure fre-
quency,11 and the findings in this trial suggest 
that the reduction in convulsive-seizure frequency 
was meaningful as assessed by caregivers. The 
lack of a significant reduction in nonconvulsive-
seizure frequency suggests that the antiseizure 
effect of cannabidiol may be specific to convul-
sive seizures in the Dravet syndrome or that the 
frequency of nonconvulsive seizures (e.g., brief 
staring spells) cannot be reliably counted by 
parents in developmentally delayed children. Non-
convulsive-seizure frequency was a secondary 
end point but not part of the primary efficacy 
assessment in this trial.
The adverse-event profile of cannabidiol in 
this trial was similar to that in the previous 
open-label trial.7 Serious adverse events were 
more common in the cannabidiol group than in 
the placebo group (16% vs. 5%), and adverse 
events led to the withdrawal of eight patients in 
the cannabidiol group as compared with one in 
the placebo group. Some effects of cannabidiol 
may relate to interactions with other antiepilep-
tic drugs.12 Notable among these are somnolence 
(36% in the cannabidiol group vs. 10% in the 
placebo group), loss of appetite (28% vs. 5%), 
and diarrhea (31% vs. 10%). Abnormalities of 
hepatic aminotransferase levels occurred only in 
patients taking valproate, suggesting an inter-
action in which cannabidiol may potentiate a 
valproic acid–induced change in hepatic amino-
transferase levels. The observation that the in-
creases in hepatic aminotransferase levels mostly 
resolved while the patients continued taking the 
drug suggests that a transient metabolic stress 
on the liver may be responsible.
The trial design used here and the primary 
end point are common to other trials of re-
cently approved antiepileptic drugs. A potential 
limitation to this partially subjective end point 
of convulsive-seizure frequency reported by care-
givers is that the side effects of the drug being 
tested might unblind patients or caregivers to the 
trial-group assignments. However, a post hoc 
analysis of the reduction in seizure frequency 
showed that there was no relationship between 
the most common side effect (somnolence) and 
the treatment effect (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Caregiver assessment showed differences 
in unpalatability between the active treatment 
and placebo (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix), which could have affected blinding in a 
small number of patients.
Cannabidiol lacks appreciable affinity or ac-
tivity at the cannabinoid receptors and lacks the 
psychoactivity of the archetypal cannabinoid, 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabidiol did not 
provoke suicidality according to the approved 
assessment instrument, the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale,13,14 although its applicabil-
ity to the population with the Dravet syndrome 
is unclear, because most patients have cognitive 
impairment.
This trial showed that cannabidiol reduced 
the frequency of convulsive seizures among chil-
dren and young adults with the Dravet syndrome 
over a 14-week period but was associated with 
adverse events including somnolence and eleva-
tion of liver-enzyme levels. Additional data are 
needed to determine the long-term efficacy and 
safety of cannabidiol for the Dravet syndrome.
