Background Patient safety measurement remains a 
global challenge. Patients are an important but neglected 
source of learning; however, little is known about 
what patients can add to our understanding of safety. 
We sought to understand the incidence and nature of 
patient-reported safety concerns in hospital.
Methods Feedback about the experience of safety 
within hospital was gathered from 2471 inpatients 
as part of a multicentre, waitlist cluster randomised 
controlled trial of an intervention, undertaken within 33 
wards across three English NHS Trusts, between May 
2013 and September 2014. Patient volunteers, supported 
by researchers, developed a classification framework of 
patient-reported safety concerns from a random sample 
of 231 reports. All reports were then classified using 
the patient-developed categories. Following this, all 
patient-reported safety concerns underwent a two-stage 
clinical review process for identification of patient safety 
incidents.
Results Of the 2471 inpatients recruited, 579 provided 
1155 patient-reported incident reports. 14 categories 
were developed for classification of reports, with 
communication the most frequently occurring (22%), 
followed by staffing issues (13%) and problems with the 
care environment (12%). 406 of the total 1155 patient 
incident reports (35%) were classified by clinicians 
as a patient safety incident according to the standard 
definition. 1 in 10 patients (264 patients) identified a 
patient safety incident, with medication errors the most 
frequently reported incident.
Conclusions Our findings suggest that patients can 
provide insight about safety that complements existing 
patient safety measurement, with a frequency of reported 
patient safety incidents that is similar to those obtained 
via case note review. However, patients provide a unique 
perspective about hospital safety which differs from and 
adds to current definitions of patient safety incidents.

IntroductIon
There has been considerable investment in 
studying and improving patient safety but 
progress is slow.1–3 Patient safety incident 
(PSI) reporting systems are well estab-
lished, but significant problems remain 
including their accuracy in identifying 
and measuring harm,4 their cost5 and their 
effectiveness in supporting organisational 
learning.6–9 Alternative and complemen-
tary approaches to gathering intelligence 
about safety and using this information 
to stimulate change should be consid-
ered, and there is growing evidence that 
patients and their families may fulfil a 
significant role here.10 
In recent years, the attention given to 
the role of the patient in patient safety has 
increased. Researchers and policymakers 
alike have argued that ‘there is consider-
able scope for [patients] to play an active 
part’ in ensuring that their care is safe 
and appropriate.11 Indeed, we now know 
that patients will provide comments on 
the quality and safety of care using their 
own experiences and can offer consider-
able detail about specific problems that 
might be missed in a staff report. For 
example, patient reports of safety events 
or experiences are often not expressed in 
the limited clinical ‘language’ of safety, 
which can provide services with richer 
contextual details that may be useful for 
both understanding the nature of the 
problem and identifying potential solu-
tions for preventing reoccurrence.12–16 
Further, emergent findings indicate that 
while patients may be reluctant to actively 
volunteer information about safety inci-
dents, if prompted they are able and 
willing to do so.17

proposed a series of recommendations, including 
a renewed commitment to organisational learning 
and meaningful patient involvement at all levels of 
healthcare. In line with this, over the past 5 
years we 
have developed novel approaches to enable patients 
to provide feedback on the safety of care.17 20 21 The 
Patient Reporting and Action for a Safe Environment 
(PRASE) intervention allows patients to anonymously 
report safety concerns using a theory-based and 
evidence-based reporting instrument. The process and 
feasibility of collecting information from patients about 
these safety concerns is described elsewhere.21 22 As 
part of a previously published large cluster randomised 
controlled trial across 33 wards in five hospitals (trial 
registration ISRCTN07689702),23 we collected infor-
mation from inpatients about their safety concerns at 
three time points over a 12-month study period. Here 
we use these data to explore if patient feedback could 
support health services to measure and improve the 
quality and safety of care by addressing the following 
research questions:
1. What concerns about safety do hospital patients report?
2. How do patients make sense of and categorise these safe-
ty concerns?
3. What is the incidence and nature of PSIs experienced by 
this sample of patients?
Methods
sample and design
Data reported here were collected using a short set of 
previously validated survey questions for inpatients,17 
administered by research staff at their bedside during 
their hospital stay. Data collection proceeded between 
May 2013 and September 2014 as part of a multi-
centre, waitlist design, cluster randomised controlled 
trial, conducted in 33 hospital wards across three NHS 
Trusts (five hospital sites) in the north of England. This 
trial was designed to assess the efficacy of the PRASE 
intervention, co-designed with patients and hospital 
staff, the detail of which is reported elsewhere.22 23 In 
total, 15 medical wards and 18 surgical wards agreed 
to host the study across the three NHS Trusts (21 
mixed gender, 6 female, 6 male).
Procedure
Prior to undertaking data collection, all researchers 
were issued with a handbook and underwent a full 
day of training, which included (i) an outline of 
the research, (ii) an overview of the human factors 
involved in patient safety, (iii) the consent process, 
(iv) how to respond to and record a patient incident 
report and (v) how to use the safety netting protocol 
should a patient report a serious event that required 
escalation. They also underwent scenario training and 
were given an opportunity to familiarise themselves 
with the measurement tools using the computer soft-
ware previously developed.21 All researchers who were 
new to the project shadowed and were observed by 
the team who developed PRASE, prior to interviewing 
patients alone.
Patients were eligible for participation if they were 
aged ≥16, able to give informed consent, with a 
minimum period of 4 
hours on the ward. Patients were 
excluded if they were too ill or distressed to take part, 
had already taken part in the study within the previous 
month or were non-English or non-Urdu-speaking 
patients. Feedback was elicited at any point within 
a patient’s stay, after a minimum of 4 
hours on the 
ward. Written consent was obtained from all patients. 
A witnessed consent process was available for those 
who were happy to participate, but unable to sign the 
written consent form due to poor literacy or visual 
impairment, with the consent process witnessed by 
a second member of the research team. We did not 
allow responses from proxies or surrogates within this 
study. Participants were asked to provide basic demo-
graphic information regarding age, gender, ethnicity 
(self-determined), time of present admission and the 
number of admissions over the previous 5-year period. 
Participating patients were asked the question, ‘Do 
you want to tell us something that has concerned you 
about your care?’. Where patients did wish to report a

concern, responses were directly inputted into a tablet 
computer by a member of the research team21–23 using 
the following prompts:
1. Please tell us what happened with your concern or expe-
rience in as much detail as you can.
2. Why do you feel this was a safety concern for you?
3. What do you think could be done to stop this from hap-
pening again to you or other patients in the future?
The collective responses to these questions were 
regarded as one patient incident report and were the 
unit of analysis for this study.
Analysis
These data were analysed in two stages. First, patient 
volunteers were supported by researchers to develop 
meaningful categories for the patient feedback that 
reflected the patient perspective, with all patient 
incident reports then sorted into these categories. 
Second, all patient incident reports underwent a 
two-stage clinical review process for the identifi-
cation of PSIs, with incidence of PSIs documented 
across the categories.
Patient research volunteers recruitment and sample
A patient volunteer panel was recruited through open 
advertisements. Interested volunteers were provided with 
information about the project, what was being asked of 
them, the time commitment and the remuneration avail-
able. All potential volunteers (n=10) with relevant expe-
rience of healthcare were selected to take part (9 out of 
10) and eight attended. Of those attending, seven were 
female and one male, with a mean age of 59 years (range 
44–71). Four reported having a disability.
Patient representative categorisation of patient incident reports
Volunteers attended seven meetings between September 
2015 and February 2016. Between five and seven volun-
teers were in attendance at each meeting. All meetings 
were facilitated by two of the research team (CR and SM). 
In the initial meeting, volunteers were provided with 
information about how the patient incident reports had 
been elicited. They were then presented with a randomly 
selected 20% of the sample of anonymised patient inci-
dent reports (n=231) and asked to group them together 
into categories, creating the categories inductively 
without reference to preconceptions or theories.24 Each 
patient incident report was read out by a facilitator (CR 
or SM) (one of the volunteers was registered as blind) 
and then discussed within the group, with consensus 
about the categorisation being reached through discus-
sion. This was an iterative process, the categories and 
definitions evolved throughout the meetings. Categories 
were reviewed and definitions were agreed, one category 
was eliminated and the patient incident reports moved 
to other categories. The volunteers then worked through 
the rest of the patient incident reports over five meet-
ings. Our approach to the categorisation exercise with 
the volunteers was to be supportive and collaborative, 
an approach that was based on a previous published 
study that worked with non-clinical representatives in 
taxonomy development.24 T
o this end, it was not felt 
appropriate to undertake formal inter-rater reliability 
estimates.
Classifying the patient incident reports as PSIs
To address the third research question, patient inci-
dent reports underwent a two-stage review process 
by health professionals.25 26 While there are a number 
of different approaches for reviewing documenta-
tion for evidence of safety events,25–28 it was felt by 
the research team that this was the most appropriate 
method to use, given the very structured nature of 
the prompts eliciting concerns from patients. Stage 
1 comprised two clinical researchers individually 
reviewing all patient incident reports (n=1155) for 
the presence of a PSI. The nationally accepted defi-
nition for PSIs was used: ‘Any unintended or unex-
pected incident which could have or did lead to harm 
for one or more patients receiving NHS care’.29 Any 
patient incident report that was judged to meet this 
definition by either reviewer was sent to second-
stage medical review, with a total of 603 patient inci-
dent reports (52%) proceeding to the second stage. 
To create a consistent approach to the classification 
process, three doctors (representing respiratory medi-
cine, obstetrics and gynaecology, elderly medicine) 
first independently reviewed a randomly selected 
sample of 50 patient incident reports before coming 
together to discuss and reach consensus about what 
constituted a PSI. The remaining patient incident 
reports (553) were then divided between the medical 
reviewers for second-stage review of the presence of 
a PSI. Following an approach previously used by the 
research team,17 reports classified as a PSI were then 
rated against the standard risk indices of (i) prevent-
ability (using a four-point scale: 1=‘definitely not 
preventable’ through to 4=‘definitely preventable’19; 
and (ii) severity (using a five-point scale: 1=‘negli-
gible’ through to 5=‘catastrophic’). Severity was 
rated as the actual, rather than the potential, severity 
of the PSI, with preventability concerned with the 
event rather than associated harm.

sample
Of the 2471 patients recruited in the trial, 579 
patients (23%) provided a total of 1053 patient inci-
dent reports. In 83 patient incident reports, more than 
one safety event was identified, giving an overall total 
of 1155 patient incident reports for analysis. Table 1 
presents the demographics for the study sample.

Communication
All
a. Staff to patient
b. Staff to staff
c. Patient to staff
251 (21.7%)
Staff to patient:
Patient went for a scan, X-ray, without any warning or information about why 
the scan was being done.
Staff to staff:
One nurse said I could go home after an X-ray and a possible dressing 
change, the doctor said that I would go home as I was and have the X-ray as 
an outpatient and go home as I am.
Patient to staff:
Patient concerned about fire procedures in case a fire started. The patient is 
partially sighted and felt that in an emergency he would be left. The side bars 
to the bed are up and he felt that he would be unable to get out of the bed. 
Fire procedures have not been explained to him.
Staff to patient:
Patient feels there has been some confusion about when they were 
going to surgery and when they could eat. This has led to them not 
being able to eat properly for up to 2.5 days at one point.
Staff to staff:
On some occasions, the night staff do not seem to be aware of the 
patient’s medication, he has to let them know what he should be 
taking.
Patient to staff:
When patient overhears staff talking they assume she is not in pain, 
but she is, they didn't ask her and assume that as they have given 
her painkillers they have worked.

Staff issues
For example, staff availability, insufficient 
staff, not prioritising, buzzers not answered, 
avoiding work
153 (13.2%)
Staff seemed overworked and that meant things sometimes were not done 
on time.
I had a cannula replacement to be done and instead of it being 
done at 18:00 when asked I was knocked awake at 02:00 for it to 
be done. Because there was no trained doctor available.
3
Environment
For  example, light at night, noise from 
staff/other patients/equipment, fixtures and 
fittings, general cleanliness, temperature, 
loneliness (single rooms), missing equipment
141 (12.2%)
Night staff were noisy—talking loudly, shoes—made it difficult to fall asleep. 
Doors slam.
The bath is very difficult to access because the side is high. I have to 
use a step which is dangerous when you are wet.
4
Compassion/dignity/privacy/respect
For example, inappropriate conduct from 
staff, confidentiality breaches, poor staff 
attitude, patients not being treated with 
dignity, overheard private conversation
135 (11.6%)
Consultants need to remember that there is a patient as well as an illness.
On a night time, struggled getting out of bed. The call bell was put 
out of reach, and couldn't get out of bed and second night the call 
bell was again out of reach and the patient had to crawl out of bed 
as the side railings were put up, and when patient got out the staff 
were sat around eating take away.
5
Medication issues
For example, medicine unavailable, late 
medication, missed or wrong medication
114 (9.9%)
Patient stated that there were delays in getting anti-sickness tablets following 
admission. Patient needed them before meals but on several occasions got 
them too late.
Patient was almost given anticoagulant twice in same day, but 
stopped nurse and told them that he had already had it.
6
Delay
For example, feeling like one is waiting 
too long, having to reschedule/postpone, 
results not available, waiting for treatment/
investigation, equipment not available
102 (8.3%)
It takes a long time for the discharge process to happen once discharge has 
been decided, up to 8 hours.
When I came in they told me I would be able to have an operation 
on Thursday, then changed until Saturday then Sunday and now not 
till Thursday.
7
Staff training
For example, staff not knowing how to do 
things, staff not trained how to do things, 
misdiagnosis
63 (5.5%)
Electrically operated bed: staff don't know how to use it, patient knows more. Another patient in the bay has dementia and has been aggressive 
towards the staff. He was punching and grabbing the staff and 
they were unable to get out of his grasp. A senior nurse came and 
showed the staff what to do in this situation.

Food and drink/nutrition
For example, timing of meals and drinks, 
communication about food requirements, 
frequent starving for surgery, specific dietary 
needs, lack of help with eating
54 (4.7%)
Patient has been unable to eat anything but breakfast for the last three days 
as the food is unpleasant.
Patient opposite cannot communicate her needs or feed herself. She 
has not had a drink today or had more than two spoons of soup to 
eat. I felt that the staff feeding her gave up too soon.
9
Ward management
For example, lack of consistency, lack of 
overview, not adhering to a standard, 
inappropriate ward for patient, missing/
mislaid documents
44 (3.8%)
Went to nurses desk to ask a question, and while I was gone they put 
someone else in my cubicle. Had to sit on chairs for around 30 min—until 
porter took me to the surgical assessment ward.
File with the notes has been missing from the bedside for the 
morning—the staff nurse was looking for it, and now the doctor is 
also looking for it.
10
Equipment and systems failure
For example, ward/medical equipment, 
systems not working or failing
32 (2.8%)
The night lights have been flickering, it gives me a headache.
PCAS machine for pain relief stopped working, two further 
machines were not working either and they had to get a technician 
out to come and repair it.
11
Infection risk
For example, spills not cleaned up, poor 
hygiene practice, full bedpans, inappropriate 
glove use, dirty facilities (visible bodily fluids)
27 (2.3%)
Bed pans (full) had been left in the toilets for hours and smell from one of 
them was horrendous.
Patient went into toilet last night and noticed faeces on toilet roll 
holder, she told a member of staff at the time but it was still there 
following day.
12
Health and safety
For example, slips/trips/ falls, clutter, space, 
safety and security, safeguarding, supervision
27 (2.3%)
Patient described a patient in the same bay who has dementia and causes 
some disruption—trying to get in bed with another patient. Sometimes 
patient woke up and saw her standing over her and it is quite scary, especially 
as quite poorly herself.
There are fire doors at the end of the bay that lead directly outside. 
In the middle of the night an elderly confused man walked out of 
them with his Zimmer frame.
13
Repeat procedure/complication
For example, something that should not 
have needed to be done again, unexpected 
complication
11 (1%)
Came in about 6 weeks ago with abdominal pain—went for scan. Said all 
fine and sent me home even though I was still not well, as was sick at home. 
Then readmitted for same problem and now finally having treatment.
I had a blood test that went missing in the laboratory, it had to be 
repeated.
14
Not a concern
1 (0.09%)
The patient was moved from an orthopaedic ward to a surgical ward because 
of bed shortages. The move was made once her care needs were appropriate 
for being moved to a non-specialist area. A nurse from the trauma ward 
will have to attend to make adjustments to knee brace. (Not a concern, the 
patient was involved in the decision to move her.)

Original research
‘Communication’ was the most frequently occurring 
category with a total of 251 patient incident reports 
(22%). Three types of communication issues were 
identified by patients: staff to patient, staff to staff and 
patient to staff, with the first of these being the most 
frequently cited safety concern. Staff issues, such as avail-
ability of staff, insufficient staffing or indicators of this 
(eg, buzzers not being answered), were the second most 
common safety concern representing 13% of the total 
patient incident reports (n=153). Third was ‘environ-
ment’, including issues relating to noise at night, lighting 
levels, the ward layout, and so on (141, 12%). Issues of 
‘compassion/dignity/privacy/respect’ (135, 12%) were 
also mentioned frequently by patients.
research question 2: how do patients make sense of 
and categorise these safety concerns?
The definitions of the categories as agreed by the volun-
teers and research team are shown in table 2. Each cate-
gory definition is illustrated with examples.
research question 3: what is the incidence and nature 
of PsIs experienced by this sample of patients?
Across the two-stage review process, 406 of the total 
1155 patient incident reports (35%) were classified 
by clinicians as a PSI according to the standard defi-
nition. Of the 2471 patients recruited to the study 
in total, 264 reported one or more PSIs (10.68%), 
meaning that 1 in 10 patients identified a PSI during 
their inpatient stay. Eighty-seven individuals (3.52% 
of the total sample) reported more than one PSI 
(range=2–7; median=2). Table 2 provides examples 
of patient incident reports from each patient-derived 
category reported by patients that were and were not 
classified as a PSI.
The number of patient incident reports that were 
classified as PSIs in each patient-derived category is 
presented in figure 1 and table 3. For the first stage 
of classification, inter-rater reliability between the 
reviewers was good, with 62% of the initial classifi-
cations agreed on. Of those categorised as a PSI, the

Original research
The degree to which patient-reported incidents 
were classified as PSIs varied (table 3). In the commu-
nications category, despite having the largest total of 
patient-reported incidents, only 54 of these (21.5%) 
were classified as PSIs following clinical review. Other 
categories with the largest difference (<50%) between 
the number of patient reports and those classified 
as PSIs were ‘staff training’ (49.2%), ‘staff issues’ 
(42.5%), ‘compassion, dignity and respect’ (25.2%), 
‘delay’ (22.5%), ‘food, drink and nutrition’ (22.2%), 
‘environment’ (5.7%) and ‘not a concern’ (0%). Those 
categories where there was found to be closer align-
ment between the number of patient reports and the 
number of classified PSIs (>50%) were ‘medication 
issues’ (83.3%), ‘ward management’ (56.8%), ‘equip-
ment and systems failure’ (56.3%), ‘infection risk’ 
(63%), ‘health and safety’ (66.7%) and ‘repeat proce-
dure/complication’ (54.5%).
Most classified PSIs were rated as ‘negligible, minor 
or moderate’ in terms of severity (99%). However, the 
majority of PSIs were also rated as ‘probably or defi-
nitely avoidable’ (90%).
dIscussIon
The data reveal that patients are an important 
source of safety reporting, with 1 in 10 reporting a 
safety concern that meets the clinical definition of a 
PSI. While this rate may appear strikingly similar to 
long-held estimates of patient harm in hospitals,4 30 
our research team has previously demonstrated that 
patient-reported safety events rarely overlap with 
events identified through other error detection 
methods.31 This suggests that our current methods of 
safety measurement in hospital settings (eg, case note 
review and staff incident reporting) may underestimate 
the level of PSIs. A large observational study of adverse 
events examining a range of safety data32 supports 
this, having found that 17.7% of patients experi-
enced a serious harm event. Further, what patients 
tell us appears to be both concordant with knowl-
edge gained from other existing processes but also 
provides a unique perspective by capturing concerns 
that are important to patients but overlooked by clin-
ical reporting systems.31 33 In our study, 65% of the 
concerns expressed by patients in this study would not

Original research
traditionally be classified as PSIs including concerns 
about physical comfort (eg, noise and light levels, 
food), fear (eg, of other patients), uncertainty (eg, 
about when discharge is happening) and delays (eg, 
in procedure). Patients may sometimes be misplaced 
in their fears or have forgotten the explanation of a 
treatment plan. However, many patient-reported 
safety concerns provide valuable personal insight into 
how care is experienced by the patient, and therefore 
what could be done to improve both patient safety and 
patient experience.
The safety concerns that patients report may be 
ignored by our current error detection methods (such 
as communication, delays in care processes), and yet 
they are known contributory factors to future safety 
events,34 making patient-reported safety concerns 
a possible leading measure of safety. It could also 
be argued that the information provided by patients 
is less biased in its content than incident reporting 
systems and less time consuming to collect than case 
note review. Taken collectively, these advantages over 
existing safety measures in hospitals present strong 
arguments for the positioning of patient feedback on 
safety as a key indicator of safety. In fact, given the 
advantages, one might even go as far as to propose that 
patient feedback could be used as one of the primary 
mechanisms for gathering safety intelligence, with the 
caveat that this approach is used as an improvement 
tool by ward/unit/practice teams rather than as an 
external regulatory or validation tool.
While there has been a number of important studies 
published over the past decade gathering the patient 
perspective of safety,12–16 this is, to our knowledge, 
the largest study of its kind. Further, our approach—
to seek to understand and categorise the patients’ 
reported safety concerns with patient representa-
tives—is novel. One of the recent criticisms of the lack 
of progress in using patient feedback to support patient 
safety improvements is that the information does not 
necessarily fit within our current professionally devel-
oped systems for managing safety and clinical risk.10 
Part of this problem is due to the difficulty in incor-
porating patient feedback into our current methods of 
capturing safety data. In recent work (funded by the 
Health Foundation), hospital volunteers have worked 
with ward teams to collect this patient safety feed-
back from patients and to make improvement plans. 
There is huge potential for this approach to support 
local learning and improvement and move beyond the 
current focus on the collection of safety data alone.
The science and practice of patient safety is argu-
ably undergoing a paradigm shift, with a move towards 
focusing less on past harm, and more on understanding 
what supports safe care and resilience in our services and 
systems.35 36 Gathering patient feedback about safety 
supports this in two main ways. First, through gathering 
patient-reported safety concerns, healthcare organisa-
tions may gain a unique insight into the ‘little’ things 
that are suboptimal in safety terms, but do not cause 
harm—information that is often overlooked by other 
‘error detection’ methods. Our finding that a majority of 
patient-reported PSIs are classified as ‘negligible’ would 
suggest that patients are perfectly positioned as a source 
of these leading indicators of safety. By focusing atten-
tion on the combination of these smaller, more frequent 
events, collecting and acting on patients’ safety concerns 
may facilitate upstream changes that support the 
creation of an environment where more things go right. 
Second, through gathering safety concerns systemati-
cally, patients and their families can provide information 
about perceived safety that can provide insight quickly 
for those managing services. Such real-time insight 
potentially allows services to make small adjustments to 
care delivery, as well as aggregating data over time to 
understand longer-term problems, and build resilience 
in our services and systems.
To realise the potential benefits of gathering feedback 
from patients, however, depends in no small part on 
the ability of services to embed these approaches within 
their current systems and resources, and act on the data 
that arises from this sustained activity. The first problem 
has been explored tentatively by further work under-
taken by our research team which sought to understand 
if patient feedback about safety could be gathered by 
trained hospital volunteers using tablet computers. Early 
findings from this work suggest that such an approach 
is acceptable, feasible and gives rise to data that can be 
used by ward staff to engage in service improvement.37 
The second problem—staff acting on patient feedback 
to improve services and the safety of care—arguably 
represents a wider and more troublesome issue for the 
health service improvement. As part of the randomised 
controlled trial from which the data presented within 
this paper were drawn,23 it was demonstrated that 
through facilitated action planning ward staff were able 
to use patient feedback to make changes to services.38 
However, there are issues that are particular to using 
patient feedback for improvement, for example, the 
credence given to the patient perspective of safety, which 
may undermine the process of acting on this feedback.39 
Further, while patient experience is widely gathered40 
and valued at a policy level,41 there is little evidence that 
these data are used for quality improvement.40 42 It is 
likely that with respect to patient feedback about safety 
this issue will be amplified, and that health services will 
struggle to incorporate patient feedback about safety 
within their current mechanisms for measuring, moni-
toring and managing risk.10 43 It will be important, 
therefore, for the research and healthcare communities 
to consider how to both create space for staff to consider 
and act on patient feedback, as well as meaningfully inte-
grate such feedback into their prospective management 
of patient safety.10 40
This study has a number of limitations. Patients in this 
study were asked to describe concerns about their care, 
rather than specifically about the safety of their care.

Original research
However, we have found and reported elsewhere17 that 
patients may be unsure about what is meant by safety and 
have a less expansive definition of safety from that used 
in this paper. Therefore, the omission of the word safety 
in the question we posed was deliberate and recognised 
that some, although not all, concerns would be classified 
as relating specifically to safety. A further issue relates 
to the process of classifying patient reports as PSIs. All 
judgements about the nature and degree of harm are 
made on the basis of patient feedback alone, with no 
reference to further clinical information. It is therefore 
possible that this either overestimates or underestimates 
the number of classified PSIs within our sample. A final 
limitation relates to the inter-rater reliability estimates 
for both the categorisation of patient incident reports by 
patient volunteers and the classification of these reports 
as PSIs by medical reviewers. No estimates were collected 
as to the degree of variation between volunteers in the 
categorisation exercise. However, given the nature of 
the categorisation process, and the need to facilitate the 
process with those not trained in research methods, it 
was felt that a collaborative, consensus building approach 
was more appropriate. Further, we only calculated inter-
rater agreement figures between the medical reviewers 
for a random sample of 50 patient incident reports in the 
first exercise of classifying the patient incident reports 
as PSIs. This was due to the volume of reports gathered 
from patients (1155). However, of those classified as a 
PSI, all reports were assessed for severity and the likeli-
hood of avoidability, for which the level of agreement 
was large when grouped meaningfully.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that patients 
can provide important insight about safety that 
complements our existing error detection methods. 
Patients report a similar frequency of PSIs to clinical 
and epidemiological reports. However, they provide 
a unique and distinctive perspective about hospital 
safety that encompasses a wider understanding about 
patient experiences that are not captured in current 
reporting systems. As such, gathering and acting on the 
patient perspective of safety has the potential to help 
build resilience in care processes and improve future 
safety performance among clinical teams and across 
organisations.
