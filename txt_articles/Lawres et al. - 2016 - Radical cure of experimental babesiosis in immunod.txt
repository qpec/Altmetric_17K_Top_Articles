Human babesiosis is a worldwide emerging infectious disease 
caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Babesia (Vannier 
and Krause, 2012; Vannier et al., 2015). Most Babesia in-
fections in humans are caused by B. microti and are trans-
mitted by the same Ixodes ticks that transmit Lyme disease 
spirochetes. The disease is endemic in the northeastern and 
northern midwestern United States and has been reported 
in Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America 
(Kjemtrup and Conrad, 2000; Krause et al., 2008). The first 
endemic site in the United States was identified in the 1960s 
in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Since then, the geographic dis-
tribution of Babesia-infected ticks has expanded and there 
has been a concomitant increase in babesiosis case incidence, 
particularly in the last decade (Vannier et al., 2015).
Babesiosis can present with clinical manifestations that 
range from a mild malaria-like illness to severe anemia, mul-
tiorgan system failure, and death. Age is a risk for more severe 
disease, with young children and elderly people the most sus-
ceptible. Severe disease, however, can occur in any age group 
that has a suppressed immune system due to HIV or condi-
tions associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapies 
(Hatcher et al., 2001; T
onnetti et al., 2009).
The current treatment for babesiosis consists of com-
bination therapies with atovaquone + azithromycin or clin-
damycin + quinine (Krause et al., 2000). B. microti parasites 
resistant to atovaquone have been shown to emerge rapidly 
in both animal and human studies (Wittner et al., 1996; Gray 
and Pudney, 1999; Wormser et al., 2010) and recrudescent 
infection or rising parasitemia can occur in humans despite 
therapy (Weiss et al., 1993; Gupta et al., 1995; Falagas and 
Klempner, 1996; Wittner et al., 1996; Marley et al., 1997; 
Krause et al., 1998, 2000, 2008; Shih and Wang, 1998; Dor-
man et al., 2000; Matsui et al., 2000; Hatcher et al., 2001; 
Vyas 
et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2009; Wudhikarn et al., 2011; Raffalli 
and Wormser, 2016). Furthermore, several of the drugs pres-
ently used to treat babesiosis are associated with significant 
side effects. In one clinical trial, 15% of subjects receiving 
atovaquone + azithromycin and 72% of those receiving clin-
damycin + quinine for babesiosis experienced adverse events, 
including tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, diarrhea, and skin rash 
(Krause et al., 2000). One-third of patients receiving clin-
Human babesiosis is a tick-borne multisystem disease caused by Babesia species of the apicomplexan phylum. Most clinical 
cases and fatalities of babesiosis are caused by Babesia microti. Current treatment for human babesiosis consists of two drug 
combinations, atovaquone + azithromycin or quinine + clindamycin. These treatments are associated with adverse side effects 
and a significant rate of drug failure. Here, we provide evidence for radical cure of experimental babesiosis in immunodeficient 
mice using a combination of an endochin-like quinolone (ELQ) prodrug and atovaquone. In vivo efficacy studies in mice using 
ELQ-271, ELQ-316, and the ELQ-316 prodrug, ELQ-334, demonstrated excellent growth inhibitory activity against the para-
site, with potency equal to that of orally administered atovaquone at 10 mg/kg. Analysis of recrudescent parasites after ELQ 
or atovaquone monotherapy identified genetic substitutions in the Qi or Qo sites, respectively, of the cytochrome bc1 complex. 
Impressively, a combination of ELQ-334 and atovaquone, at doses as low as 5.0 mg/kg each, resulted in complete clearance of 
the parasite with no recrudescence up to 122 d after discontinuation of therapy. These results will set the stage for future 
clinical evaluation of ELQ and atovaquone combination therapy for treatment of human babesiosis.

damycin + quinine required either a decrease in dosage or 
discontinuation of the drugs (Krause et al., 2000). These lim-
itations in efficacy and in tolerability emphasize the need for 
more effective therapies with fewer adverse events.
In the absence of a long-term ex vivo culture system, 
mice deficient in B and T cells (e.g., SCID and rag1−/− mice) 
have served as excellent models to study the pathophysiology 
of B. microti (Li et al., 2012; T
erkawi et al., 2015). The mouse 
model of babesiosis, however, is not amenable to large-scale 
chemical screens to identify new drugs or drug combinations 
with desirable efficacy and pharmacological properties for the 
treatment of human babesiosis. T
o circumvent this deficiency, 
we adapted a short-term ex vivo growth assay to identify 
new B. microti agents. These studies identified endochin-like 
quinolones (ELQs) as a novel class of anti–B. microti drugs. 
In vivo efficacy studies and molecular analyses highlighted 
the potency of ELQ derivatives, helped to unravel their novel 
mode of action, and identified a combination therapy reg-
imen that rapidly eliminates bloodstream parasites and pre-
vents relapse in B. microti-infected immunodeficient mice.

Combining short-term ex vivo growth and flow cytometry 
for screening of antiparasitic drugs
T
o develop an assay for rapid and possibly large scale screen-
ing of chemical libraries for new anti-Babesia drugs, we ex-
amined the intraerythrocytic development of B. microti ex 
vivo under different culture conditions, including those pre-
viously described for this parasite and Plasmodium falciparum 
(Trager and Jensen, 1976; Chen et al., 2000; Moitra et al., 
2015). Our analyses indicated that optimal short-term ex vivo 
growth can be achieved when infected RBCs are collected 
from mice during the exponential phase of infection and 
immediately mixed with uninfected mouse erythrocytes in 
complete RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bo-
vine serum. Flow cytometry (not depicted) and microscopic 
analysis of thin blood smears performed at 48 h of cell culture 
showed an increase in parasitemia from ∼1 to 6% (Fig. 1 A 
and B), demonstrating ex vivo growth of the parasites.
Using this short-term in vitro culture system, we as-
sessed growth inhibition of B. microti exposed to four drugs 
currently used in the treatment of human babesiosis: qui-
nine, clindamycin, azithromycin, and atovaquone. We also 
examined the effect of endochin and artesunate, which are 
known for their potent activity against other apicomplexan 
parasites. Potent anti–B. microti activity was measured for 
atovaquone and endochin, moderate anti–B. microti activity 
was measured for artesunate, and no activity could be mea-
sured for quinine, clindamycin, or azithromycin at a 10-µM 
concentration (Fig. 1 A).
Because of the impressive ex vivo activity of endo-
chin, four ELQs analogues belonging to the 4(1H)-quino-
lone-3-diarylether series (Winter et al., 2011; Doggett et al., 
2012; Nilsen et al., 2014; Stickles et al., 2015) were examined 
for activity against B. microti. ELQs are highly effective in

against B. microti LabS1 strain. (A) B. microti LabS1-infected RBCs at 
1% parasitemia were maintained in short-term ex vivo culture for 48 h

et al., 2006), a sensitive DNA dye that labels intracellular parasites. Re-
sults indicate the percent of RBCs found to stain positive for B. microti.

Giemsa stained preparations. At least 5,000 RBCs per smear were counted.

vivo against malaria and toxoplasmosis. Microscopy analyses 
of ELQ-treated B. microti parasites demonstrated signifi-
cant inhibition of parasite growth ex vivo with 41 and 32% 
growth inhibition achieved using ELQ-271 and ELQ-316, 
respectively (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained using 
flow cytometry (unpublished data).
ELQ-271 inhibits B. microti cytochrome bc1 activity
ELQs inhibit mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex activ-
ity, but have different selectivity for specific organisms with 
changes in the substituents at the fifth, sixth, and seventh 
positions of the benzenoid ring of the quinolone core (Qi 
site). For example, the chlorine atom at position 6 of ELQ-
300 significantly decreases potency against T. gondii, whereas 
the unsubstituted quinolone core of ELQ-271 is associated 
with increased activity against cytochrome bc1 complex from 
 
S. cerevisiae (Doggett et al., 2012). T
o assess the inhibitory 
activity of ELQs against B. microti cytochrome bc1 complex, 
B. microti mitochondrial membranes were isolated from 
purified infected RBCs and used to measure cytochrome 
c reductase activity in the absence or presence of ELQ-271 
(Fig. 1 C). Dispersed B. microti mitochondria yielded cyto-
chrome bc1 complexes with a Vmax of 57.2 µM cytochrome 
c reduced s−1 mg−1 protein and a Km of 4 µM. The EC50 of 
ELQ-271 was 120 ± 12 nM, and the fit curve revealed a hill 
slope of 1.1, indicative of a single binding site. By compar-
ison, the EC50 of ELQ-271 for inhibition of T. gondii and 
 
P
. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complexes are 30.6 and 8.9 nM, 
respectively (Doggett et al., 2012; Nilsen et al., 2014).
Efficacy of ELQ compounds against B. microti in mice
We next evaluated the ability of selected ELQ derivatives to 
eliminate B. microti infection in SCID mice, which develop 
persistent, high-level parasitemia. Groups of five mice each 
were inoculated with 107 infected RBCs (iRBCs), and then 
treated for 1 wk with either the indicated ELQ or vehicle 
only, beginning on day 4 of infection. Blood samples were 
obtained at the onset of treatment and every 4 d thereafter to 
measure parasitemia by microscopic examination of Giemsa- 
stained smears (Fig. 2). Parasitemia reached ∼30% by day 12 
after infection (pi) in control mice that received vehicle only 
(Fig. 2 A), as well as those treated with ELQ-300 (Fig. 2 C) 
or ELQ-400 (Fig. 2 E); this parasitemia persisted for the du-
ration of the experiment (50 d). In contrast, mice treated with 
ELQ-271 (Fig. 2 B) and ELQ-316 (Fig. 2 D) exhibited very 
low to undetectable parasitemia levels by day 8 pi, and para-
sites remained undetectable until day 22. T
o compare the ef-
ficacy of ELQ-271 and ELQ-316 to drugs currently used for 
treatment of human babesiosis, in vivo efficacy studies were 
also performed in parallel on groups of five mice each using 
quinine, azithromycin, clindamycin and atovaquone mono-
therapy at similar doses (10 mg/kg; Fig. 2, F and D). Of these 
four drugs, only atovaquone showed potent activity against 
B. microti in vivo (Fig. 2 F). A second independent study 
was also performed using both SCID and rag1−/− mice and 
showed similar results (Fig. 2 B-I, gray lines). Treatment with 
clindamycin up to 50 mg/kg, azithromycin up to 50 mg/kg, 
or quinine up to 100 mg/kg had no significant effect on par-
asite development in mice (Fig. 2, J–M).
Genetic evidence for the B. microti cytochrome bc1 complex 
as a target of ELQ and atovaquone action
Having demonstrated that ELQ-271 and ELQ-316 at 10 mg/
kg exhibit potent antibabesiosis activity through 22 d of in-
fection (Fig. 2, B and D), we followed these mice treated with 
ELQs for reemergence of parasitemia after a more extended 
period post-drug removal (PDR). By 16 d PDR (26 PDI), 
 
B. microti iRBCs could be detected in mice treated with 
ELQ-271 and ELQ-316, and parasitemia levels in these mice 
ranged between 0 and 1% (Fig. 3 A). By day 29 PDR, however, 
the parasitemia in two mice (IL271-2 and IL271-3) treated 
with ELQ-271 rose to 37%, whereas in the third mouse 
(IL271-1) parasitemia reached 0.06% (Fig. 3 B). However, all 
three mice treated with ELQ-316 (isolates: IL316-1, IL316-
2, and IL316-3) reached a mean parasitemia of roughly 40%. 
We found similar reemergence and persistence of parasites in 
mice treated with ELQ-271 and ELQ-316 (Fig. 2, B and D).
 T
o assess whether recurrent parasitemia was associated 
with mutations in the Qi site of the cytochrome bc1 com-
plex, genomic DNA was isolated from blood collected from 
each of the six treated mice, as well as from two vehicle-only 
mice, and used to amplify and sequence the BmCytb gene. 
In mice treated with ELQ-271 or ELQ-316, a single mu-
tation was found to alter codon 218 (alanine to valine) in 
the BmCytb gene, changing GCT to GTT and resulting 
in an amino acid change from alanine to valine in the en-
coded protein (Fig. 3 C).
T
o further examine whether recrudescent infections 
in ELQ-271– and ELQ-316–treated mice were the result 
of resistance of the parasites to ELQ-271 and/or ELQ-316, 
iRBCs collected from mice carrying one resistant isolate 
LabS1-R (isolate IL271-2) were purified and injected into 
SCID mice. After 3 d of infection, mice were subjected to the 
same treatment regimen, with either vehicle alone or ELQ-
316 at 10 mg/kg daily for 7 d. As shown in Fig. 3 D, whereas 
the LabS1 parental isolate remained fully sensitive to ELQ-
316, the LabS1-R strain was resistant to the drug.
We have also evaluated the recrudescence of parasitemia 
with suboptimal dosing with ELQ-271 (0.1 mg/kg). A nude 
mouse was inoculated intraperitoneally with 5 × 107 iRBCs 
(B. microti ATCC PRA-99 strain) and treated with 0.1 mg/kg 
 
of ELQ-271 via oral gavage on days 13, 14, and 15. When 
parasitemia levels were >5%, ELQ-271 was again administered 
on days 25, 26, and 27, as well as days 33 and 34. 
This treatment 
regimen had no effect on the persistence of parasitemia (un-
published data). DNA was extracted from the blood of these 
mice on day 53, and the BmCytb gene of the parental strain 
and the ELQ-271–resistant strain was sequenced (Fig. 3 C). 
Results revealed that the ELQ-271–resistant strain had an ad-
enine substituted for a cytosine that results in the serine 219

Figure 2. Efficacy of endochin-like quinolones and current therapies against B. microti in SCID mice. In the two independent studies, mice were 
injected with 107 iRBCs and treated with a single daily dose of vehicle alone or drugs from day 4 to 10 after infection. Parasitemia in individual mice was 
determined by microscopic counting of Giemsa-stained blood smears. In the first study (black lines), nine groups of five female SCID mice each were treated 
with either vehicle alone (A) or one of the compounds (B–I). In the second study (gray lines), groups of three mice each were treated with either vehicle alone 
or one of the drugs. Drugs used were as follows: ELQ-271 (B), ELQ-300 (C), ELQ-316 (D) or ELQ-400 (E), atovaquone (F), azithromycin (G), clindamycin (H), or 
quinine (I) at 10 mg/kg. P-values comparing parasitemia between untreated and treated mice at days 8 and 22 after infection were determined using the 
Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test (PD8 = 0.0034 and PD22 = 0.0010 for ELQ-271 vs. control; PD8 = 0.0066 and PD22 = 0.0014 for ELQ-316 vs. control; and 
PD8 = 0.0013 and PD22 = 0.3062 for Atovaquone vs. control). (J–M) Groups of three mice each were treated with azithromycin at 50 mg/kg (J), clindamycin 
at 50 mg/kg (K), quinine at 50 mg/kg (L), and quinine at 100 mg/kg (M).

being changed to a tyrosine (S219Y; Fig. 3 C). This finding 
is unique to the ELQ-271–resistant isolate when compared 
with the parental strain and the previously known BmCytb 
sequence for the B. microti ATCC PRA-99 strain. It is note-
worthy that both A218V and the S219Y mutations occur in 
the Qi site of the BmCytb (see Fig. 5 A). Similarly, treatment 
with atovaquone at 10 mg/kg also resulted in recrudescence 
by 14 d PDR. Analysis of the BmCytb gene from these para-
sites identified a single mutation in codon 134 changing ATG 
to ATT, resulting in substitution of amino acid residue Met134 
to Ile in the predicted Qo site of the B. microti cytochrome b 
protein (Figs. 3 C and 5 A).
A combination of ELQ-334 and atovaquone eliminates  
B. microti infection in immunodeficient mice
The finding that ELQs and atovaquone target different sites of 
the cytochrome bc1 complex involved in the electron trans-
port chain suggested that a combination of these drugs could 
be synergistic and prevent the emergence of resistance. Be-
cause of the low oral bioavailability of ELQs (Miley et al., 
2015), we synthesized a prodrug form of ELQ-316, ELQ-334 
(Fig. 4 A), and examined its anti–B. microti activity in vivo 
in groups of five mice each. Similar to the parent drug, treat-
ment with ELQ-334 at 10 mg/kg resulted in rapid clearance 
of B. microti in mice injected with 107 iRBCs (Fig. 4 D). We

tance to atovaquone and ELQs. Blood from 
mice treated with either vehicle, ELQ-271, or 
ELQ-316 was analyzed on days 26 (A) and 39 
(B) after infection. Whereas <1% parasitemia 
was seen in ELQ-271– and ELQ-316–treated 
parasites by 26 d after infection, the parasite-
mia increased to ∼35% in five drug-treated 
mice, with one drug-treated mouse (IS271-1) 
still presenting low parasitemia. Parasite-
mia in individual mice was determined on 
the indicated days by microscopic analysis 
of Giemsa-stained blood smears. Each sym-
bol represents an individual mouse. P-values 
comparing parasitemia between untreated and 
treated mice at days 26 (* = 0.0809 and ** = 
0.0809) and 39 (* = 0.1489 and ** = 0.3865) 
after infection were determined using the 
Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test. (C) 
Genomic DNA was prepared from resistant 
parasites isolated from three different mice 
undergoing independent selections. Each ge-
nomic DNA was used in three independent 
PCR reactions to amplify the BmCytb gene. 
Three independent PCR products were pu-
rified and sent for Sanger sequencing at the 
Yale Keck Sequencing Facility. The sequences 
were analyzed using Geneious Version 81. Re-
sults are shown for resistant parasites isolated 
from SCID mice infected with the parental

subsequently assessed the potency and recrudescence profile 
of different combinations of ELQ-334 and atovaquone in 
mice infected with B. microti. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), 
mice treated with atovaquone or ELQ-334 alone at 10 mg/
kg showed recrudescence (by 16 d PDR for ELQ-334 and 
 
9 d PDR for atovaquone, respectively). Note that similar re-
sults were obtained in a second independent experiment and 
at 10 and 20 mg/kg of ELQ-334 or atovaquone monotherapy 
(Fig. 4, C and D). Recrudescence in these mice after ELQ-
334 or atovaquone monotherapy was associated with single 
mutations in the BmCytb gene (M134I in the Qo site of the 
BmCytb protein for atovaquone and N28S, N28Y
, and A218V 
in the Qi site of the BmCytb protein for ELQ-334; Figs. 3 C 
and 5 A). Reduced parasitemia was achieved at a combina-
tion dose of 1 mg/kg of ELQ-334 and atovaquone. However, 
resistant parasites emerged by day 25 PI, and recrudescence 
after this combination was associated with single mutations 
in the BmCytb gene (either S25N or A218V in the Qi site 
of the BmCytb protein). Notably, in two independent studies, 
mice treated with combinations of ELQ-334 and atovaquone 
at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg of each drug showed no 
parasitemia by the end of therapy, and recrudescence was not 
detected in mice followed for up to 95 d after infection (Fig. 4, 
F–H). At day 133 after infection, radical cure was achieved in 
all 10 mice receiving combination therapies with either 5 or 
10 mg/kg of each drug, and in four out of the five mice re-
ceiving combination of atovaquone and ELQ-334 at 2.5 mg/
kg each. Blood collected 58 d after infection from mice treated 
with 5 and 10 mg/kg drug combinations tested negative for 
B. microti DNA by PCR and failed to cause infection when 
injected into uninfected SCID mice (unpublished data).

Alternative chemotherapeutic options against Babesia microti 
are needed in the wake of the increasing number of treatment 
failures using current combination therapies. The current 
treatment options for mild and severe human babesiosis using 
quinine, clindamycin, azithromycin, and atovaquone were ini-
tially investigated because of their antimalarial activity and are 
associated with significant side effects and drug failures (Weiss 
et al., 1993; Gupta et al., 1995; Falagas and Klempner, 1996; 
Wittner et al., 1996; Marley et al., 1997; Krause et al., 1998, 
2000, 2008; Shih and 
Wang, 1998; Dorman et al., 2000; Matsui 
et al., 2000; Falagas and Hatcher et al., 2001; 
Vyas et al., 2007; 
Zhao et al., 2009; Wudhikarn et al., 2011). Furthermore, the 
mechanisms by which most of these drugs inhibit intraeryth-
rocytic development of B. microti have not been investigated. 
Cell biological studies, as well as genome and metabolic re-
constitution analyses, have indicated that unlike Plasmodium 
parasites, B. microti does not degrade hemoglobin and lacks 
most of the cysteine, aspartic, and metalloproteases known to 
be required for hemoglobin degradation in malaria parasites 
(Cornillot et al., 2012). Additionally, no hemozoin-like struc-
tures can be seen in B. microti–infected RBCs or detected 
in the liver or spleen of mammals infected with this parasite. 
 
Although these findings question the rationale for using qui-
nine in babesiosis therapy, it is possible that considering the 
high clinical dose recommended for this drug, it might func-
tion by targeting other parasite proteins, such as K+ channels or 
methyltransferases (Bobenchik et al., 2010; Kuum et al., 2012; 
Garg et al., 2015). In the case of clindamycin and azithromy-
cin, the mode of action in B. microti remains unknown; al-
though based on knowledge from other parasites, it is believed 
that these drugs may target the parasite apicoplast (Camps et 
al., 2002; Sidhu et al., 2007). The fourth compound used in 
babesiosis therapy is atovaquone, a drug with potent antima-
larial effects. However, resistance to atovaquone monotherapy 
emerges rapidly in malaria-treated patients leading to the for-
mulation of the combination therapy atovaquone-proguanil 
also known as Malarone. Biochemical and structural studies 
have demonstrated that atovaquone targets the cytochrome 
bc1 complex by specifically binding to the Qo site of the Cytb 
subunit (Vaidya and Mather, 2000; Mather and 
Vaidya, 2008).
In vitro drug sensitivity studies of B. microti have thus far 
been hampered by the absence of a continuous culture assay. 
In this study, we used a short-term ex vivo screening assay to 
examine different classes of drugs for their activity against the 
parasite. Of the four drugs presently used in babesiosis therapy, 
atovaquone was the only compound that showed significant 
activity against B. microti. Interestingly, this assay identified a 
different class of drugs, endochin, and its analogues as effective 
anti–B. microti inhibitors. ELQs are analogues of endochin, a 
compound whose antiparasitic activity was described nearly 
70 yr ago (Salzer et al., 1948; Nilsen et al., 2013). Because 
endochin exhibits metabolic instability in liver microsomes 
from a variety of mammalian species (Winter et al., 2011), an-
alogues with better metabolic stability profiles and enhanced 
activity against drug-sensitive and –resistant malaria parasites 
were developed (Nilsen et al., 2014). These analogues have 
potent activity against other intracellular pathogens, includ-
ing T
oxoplasma gondii (Doggett et al., 2012). Interestingly, 
although these analogues are structurally similar, they have 
demonstrated different selectivity for specific organisms with 
changes in the substituents at the fifth, sixth, and seventh po-
sitions of the quinolone ring, whereas the chlorine atom at 
position 6 of ELQ-300 significantly decreases activity against 
T. gondii, compared with ELQ-316, which has a smaller flu-
orine atom in this position. Moreover, the unsubstituted fifth, 
sixth, and seventh positions of ELQ-271 broaden activity to 
include S. cerevisiae and T. gondii, while retaining activity 
against P
. falciparum (Doggett et al., 2012; Nilsen et al., 2013).
In vivo efficacy studies showed that of the four endo-
chin analogues examined in this study, ELQ-271 and ELQ-
316, were found to be most effective against B. microti after 
oral administration at 10 mg/kg (Fig. 2, B and D). The other 
two compounds, ELQ-300 and ELQ-400, were not effective 
at this dose (Fig. 2, C and E).
Our studies in mice infected with B. microti have 
shown that recrudescence of parasitemia after treatment with 
ELQ-271 or ELQ-316 occurs 12 to 15 d after drug removal.

Although the SCID and nude mouse models are more likely 
to have recrudescent babesiosis than an immunocompetent 
human host due to the profound immunocompromised con-
dition of the mice, they proved valuable for understanding 
the mode of action of these drugs, substantiating the obser-
vation of direct inhibition of the B. microti cytochrome bc1 
by ELQ-271 (Fig. 1 C). Sequencing analyses of drug-resistant 
 
parasites from two different strains of B. microti (LabS1 and 
ATCC PRA-99 strain) treated with either 10 or 0.1 mg/
kg identified two independent mutations in the Cytb gene 
that are responsible for the resistant phenotype. The two mu-
tations affect adjacent residues in the Qi site of the parasite 
cytochrome bc1 complex (Fig. 5 A). A known K→M sub-
stitution in the analogous residue of the S. cerevisiae (228) 
Cytb gene causes resistance to 1-hydroxy-2-dodecyl-4(1H)
quinolone (HDQ) and antimycin A (Vallières et al., 2012).

(B–H) Groups of five female SCID (black lines) or three mice (gray lines) each were injected with 107 iRBCs and treated with either a single daily dose of 
vehicle alone (B) or the indicated drugs on days 4 to 10 (C–H). Parasitemia in individual mice was determined by microscopic counting of Giemsa-stained 
blood smears. Drug treatment include atovaquone at 10 mg/kg (C), ELQ-334 at 10 mg/kg (D), and four drug combinations atovaquone + ELQ-334 at 1 mg/
kg (E), 2.5 mg/kg (F), 5 mg/kg (G), and 10 mg/kg (H) each. Untreated SCID and rag1−/− were combined in a single graph. No significant differences were seen 
between these mice independent of the gender. P-values comparing parasitemia between untreated and treated mice at days 8 and 22 after infection were 
determined using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test (PD8 = 0.0007 and PD22 = 0.0006 for ELQ-334 vs. control; PD8 = 0.0009 and PD22 = 0.0006 for 
ELQ-334+Atovaquone [1+1 mg/kg] vs. control; PD8 = 0.0007 and PD22 = 0.0006 for ELQ-334+Atovaquone [2.5+2.5 mg/kg] vs. control); PD8 = 0.0004 and PD22 
= 0.0006 for ELQ-334+Atovaquone (5+5 mg/kg) versus control; and PD8 = 0.0008 and PD22 = 0.0006 for ELQ-334+Atovaquone (10+10 mg/kg) versus control.

In S. cerevisiae, lysine 228 forms a water-mediated hydrogen 
bond with ubiquinone and plays an important role in the Qi 
site proton-uptake pathway (Hunte et al., 2003). Recently, in 
silico modeling of ELQ-300 docking to bovine cytochrome 
bc1 predicts binding of the quinolone carbonyl group in the 
Qi pocket where the conserved 228 position aspartic acid 
residue (position 220 in B. microti, 229 in S. cerevisiae) has 
previously been shown to interact via a water molecule with 
the carbonyl oxygen of ubiquinone (Gao et al., 2003; Capper 
et al., 2015). It is possible that the A218V and the S219Y mu-
tations interfere with the interaction between ELQs and the 
conserved aspartic acid at position 220. Mutations at the N28 
position of the Qi site of ELQ-treated B. microti (N28S and 
N28Y) correspond to the N31 position in S. cerevisiae, where 
it is known that an asparagine to lysine mutation causes resis-
tance to the herbicide, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimeth-
ylurea (Fig. 5 A; Fisher and Meunier, 2008). Mice infected 
with one of the resistant isolates showed increased parasitemia 
over time after treatment with ELQ-316, indicating that the 
parasite isolate was stably and fully resistant to the drug. Qi 
site inhibition is a new mechanism of action for an antipara-
sitic drug that provides a promising strategy for combination 
therapy with the current Qo site inhibitor, atovaquone.
Higher doses or longer duration of ELQs may prevent 
recrudescence in the SCID mouse model, however the chal-
lenging physicochemical properties of these drugs, i.e., high 
degree of crystallinity and poor aqueous solubility, preclude 
administration of doses >10 mg/kg (Nilsen et al., 2013; Miley 
et al., 2015). T
o solve this problem, a prodrug, ELQ-334, was 
designed to deliver higher concentrations of ELQ-316 to the 
bloodstream. In vivo experiments were performed to assess 
the efficacy of ELQ-334 against B. microti and compare it 
to other drugs in clinical use against B. microti infections: 
azithromycin, clindamycin, quinine, and atovaquone. The 
results showed that ELQ-334 is highly effective against the 
parasite at concentrations up to 20 mg/kg. Unfortunately, 
the 7-d treatment regimen resulted in recrudescence by day 
27 after infection. Sequencing of genomic DNA from mice 
presenting recrudescent infection showed different mutations 
depending on the dose of the compound, all of them located 
in the Qi site of the Cytb complex, thereby providing genetic 
validation of selective drug targeting in B. microti.
A critical finding of this study is that a combination of 
atovaquone + ELQ-334 at doses as low as 5.0 mg/kg of each 
drug resulted in apparent cure, as all immunodeficient mice 
showed no detectable parasitemia after treatment. The radical 
cure of experimental babesiosis was confirmed in two inde-
pendent studies after examination of peripheral blood smears 
up to 122 d PDR, as well as by PCR and reinfection studies. 
As this cure was achieved in severely immunodeficient mice, 
it demonstrates the superior efficacy of the combination in 
eliminating infection even in immunocompromised hosts. It is 
possible that this enhancement of in vivo efficacy is a result of 
synergism between atovaquone and ELQ-316 or a prolonged 
half-life of one or both compounds; however, this result also 
suggests that B. microti has a limited capacity to generate mu-
tations at both the Qo and the Qi sites when exposed to si-
multaneous drug pressure. The elevated barrier to resistance is 
possibly caused by intolerable fitness costs in the enzyme com-
plex that may result from having mutations at both active sites. 
In summary, our data demonstrate that ELQs effectively 
treat experimental babesiosis by inhibiting the Qi site of cy-
Figure 5. Mode of action of ELQ and atovaquone. (A) Location of atovaquone and ELQ-316 resistance mutations in the Qo and Qi sites of the cyto-
chrome b. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome b is used to illustrate the approximate location of the corresponding B. microti drug-resistance mutations, 
which are denoted with B. microti amino acid numbering. ELQ-316 resistance mutations A218V and S219Y correspond to the E α helix, whereas N28S and 
N28Y correspond to the N-terminal region of the S. cerevisiae Qi site. The M134I atovaquone-resistance mutation corresponds to the M139 position in S. 
cerevisiae, located on the cd1 helix of the Qo site. The structure and the Qo and Qi sites in this image were generated using the protein structure 4PD4.pdb 
and Molegro software. (B) Quinol oxidation takes place at the Qo site and ubiquinone reduction takes place at the Qi site of complex III (cytochrome bc1 com-
plex) in the mitochondrial membrane of B. microti. Atovaquone inhibits the Qo site where as ELQs inhibit the Qi site of BmCytb protein (Doggett et al., 2012).

tochrome bc1 complex. Moreover, a combination of atova-
quone and ELQ-334 is effective at eliminating parasitemia 
without demonstrable relapse after drug discontinuation in 
experimentally infected immunodeficient mice. This combi-
nation therapy is predicted to effect a complete blockage of 
the electron transport chain through complex III (Fig. 5 B), 
leading to ATP depletion, pyrimidine starvation, and inhibi-
tion of heme biosynthesis (Sarewicz and Osyczka, 2015). We 
propose that this combination is a promising treatment op-
tion for human babesiosis that may eliminate clinical B. mi-
croti recrudescence, including in immunocompromised hosts.

Mouse strains. 
 C.B17 scid C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid and 
CB17/Icr-Prkdcscid/IcrIcoCrl mice were obtained from 
Taconic and Charles River. The C57BL/6 rag1−/− knockout 
mice were a gift from R. Medzhitov (Yale, New Haven, CT) 
and were bred in our animal facility. Nude mice were obtained 
from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal experimental proto-
cols followed 
Yale University and Portland 
Veterans Affairs (VA) 
Medical Center institutional guidelines for care and use of lab-
oratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committees (IAC 
UC) at Yale University and 
Portland 
VA Medical Center. Rules for ending experiments in 
mice were to be enacted if mice showed any signs of distress or 
appeared moribund. This, however, was not the case for any 
animals in the study. Parasitemia was determined using standard 
methods for collecting a drop of blood from the tail vein and 
using this blood to perform Giemsa staining and flow cytome-
try. Randomization of mice to the various groups was per-
formed by randomly picking animals to one group or another.
Chemicals. 
 The chemical structures of ELQ-271, ELQ-300, 
ELQ-316, and ELQ-400 are shown in Fig. 2. The com-
pounds were synthesized as previously described (Nilsen et 
al., 2014). 
The chemical structure of ELQ-334 and its synthe-
sis are described in Fig. 4 A.
Cell culture and materials. 
 B. microti LabS1 (ELQ sensitive 
strain is referred to as LabS1-S) and ATCC PRA-99 strains 
were maintained in SCID (CB17/Icr-Prkdcscid/IcrIcoCrl; 
Charles River) or rag1−/− knockouts, where they reached high 
parasitemia. Short-term ex vivo culture of B. microti LabS1 was 
performed as follows: SCID or rag1−/− mice were infected with 
B. microti LabS1 strain parasites by i.p. inoculation of ∼107 
iRBCs. Infected blood was collected by retroorbital bleeding 
when the parasitemia in the mice was ∼10%. An uninfected 
syngeneic mouse was sacrificed for blood, which was used for 
dilution of infected blood to achieve a final parasitemia of ∼1%. 
The blood was washed three times with RPMI. A 96-well 
flat-bottom plate was used for drug screening. Parasites were 
grown at 10% hematocrit. Complete medium, used for propa-
gation of B. microti culture, consists of RPMI medium 1640 
supplemented with 30 mg/l hypoxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich), 
25 mM Hepes (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.225% NaHCO3 (Sigma- 
Aldrich), 10% FBS (HI FBS; Gibco; 10082–139), Pen Strep 
(Gibco; 15140–122), 100 µg/ml Kanamycin, and 10 µg/ml 
gentamycin (Life 
T
echnologies). 
The cultures were grown using 
a gas mixture of 3% O2, 3% CO2, and 94% N2.
Mitochondrial isolation and enzyme inhibition assays. 
 Infected 
mouse blood was diluted 1:1 in PBS and passed over a micro-
crystalline cellulose (Avicel PH-101; Sigma-Aldrich) column 
to remove white blood cells. The RBCs were then lysed in 
0.075% (wt/vol) saponin at 37°C for 1 h. 
Whole parasites were 
pelleted at 1,000 g for 20 min. The parasites were resuspended 
in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS (containing 1 mM PMSF) and passed 
through a French press at 20,000 psi. 
The resulting mixture was 
then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 45 min to pellet mitochondria. 
The mitochondria were resuspended in 1 ml of cold PBS with 
10% glycerol (vol/vol.) The aliquots were stored at −80°C 
until needed. 
T
o measure cytochrome c reduction, an aliquot of 
mitochondria was allowed to thaw on ice, and n-dodecyl β-D 
maltoside was added to a final concentration of 6 mg/ml. The 
mixture was allowed to rest on ice for 1 h, and then was centri-
fuged at 10,000 g to remove insoluble material. The clarified 
supernatant was used for enzyme assays. Reactions were initi-
ated by adding dispersed mitochondria (∼5 ng/ml protein) to 
reaction buffer (50 mM Tricine, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM sodium 
azide, 50 µM equine cytochrome c, and 50 µM decylubiqui-
nol). The background reduction of cytochrome c by decylubi-
quinol was subtracted from the initial rate of cytochrome c 
reduction after the addition of mitochondria. Cytochrome c 
reduction was monitored at 550 nm minus 542 nm. The reac-
tions were conducted at 30°C. Final DMSO concentrations 
introduced from ELQ-271 solutions were <0.1%.
In vivo efficacy assays. 
 T
wo independent studies were con-
ducted to evaluate the efficacy of compounds against B. mi-
croti in vivo. The first study included groups of five female 
SCID mice each (C.B17 scid C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid; 
Taconic). In the second study, in vivo drug efficacy studies 
were performed in SCID, rag1−/−, or nude mice depending 
on availability in the laboratory. B. microti infection of each 
of these immunodeficient mice results in persistent parasite-
mia in mice (Clark and Allison, 1974). Untreated mice from 
the same genetic background were included as controls. Mice 
were infected with 107 B. microti (LabS1) iRBCs via i.p. in-
jection. Drugs were administered to animals by gavage begin-
ning 4 d after infection and continued for 7 consecutive days. 
Treated animals received 100 µl of drug solution in PEG-400 
via oral gavage. Blood samples were collected every 4 d until 
parasitemia in control mice treated with vehicle alone reached 
50% for at least two blood collections. Parasitemia was deter-
mined using light microscopy and confirmed with Giemsa 
staining of thin blood smears and by flow cytometry using 
YOYO-1 (Borggraefe et al., 2006). Recrudescence was mon-
itored by measuring parasitemia for a minimum of 45 d after 
infection. In the low-dose ELQ-271 treatment experiment, 
two nude mice were inoculated i.p. with 5 × 107 iRBCs (B.

microti ATCC PRA-99 strain). One mouse was treated with 
0.1 mg/kg of ELQ-271 in PEG-400 via oral gavage on days 
13, 14, and 15. Parasitemia was determined using light mi-
croscopy after Giemsa staining of thin blood smears. When 
parasitemia levels >5% were detected, ELQ-271 was admin-
istered on days 25, 26, 27, 33, and 34. Despite the subsequent 
treatments, parasitemia persisted and blood was collected on 
day 53. Blood was obtained from the untreated mouse after 
parasitemia reached >50%.
Genomic DNA isolation and sequencing. 
 Blood was col-
lected in EDTA tubes (Medtronic; 8881311149). The blood 
was passed through a cellulose column (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific; S25241A), PBS was added, and then the blood 
was collected and centrifuged to obtain a blood pellet. Ge-
nomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy Blood and Tissue 
kit (QIA 
GEN; 69504). The isolated DNA was amplified 
using KOD DNA Polymerase (Novagen; 71085–3). PCR re-
actions to amplify the cytochrome b gene were performed 
using the following primers: F4302, 5′-AGA

Flow cytometry. 
 Blood samples were fixed in 0.025% glutar-
aldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich; #G5882) and stored at 4°C. For 
staining, the cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized 
with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were washed 
again with PBS and treated with 0.25 mg/ml RNase (Invit-
rogen; #12091–021) for 1 h at 37°C. After RNase treatment, 
cells were stained with 20 nM 
YOYO-1 (Invitrogen; #Y3601) 
for 1 h at room temperature and in the dark. The cells were 
washed and resuspended in PBS for flow analysis.
Statistical analyses. 
 Statistical analyses were performed using 
an unpaired Student’s t test, as well as the Mann-Whitney 
nonparametric U test. Differences were considered statisti-
cally significant when P < 0.05.
