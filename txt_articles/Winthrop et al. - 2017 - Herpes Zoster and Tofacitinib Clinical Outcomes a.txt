Objective. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
are at increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ), and the risk
appears to be increased in patients treated with tofacitinib.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether concomitant
treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or glucocorticoids
(GCs) contributes to the increased risk of HZ in RA
patients treated with tofacitinib.
Methods. HZ cases were identified from the data-
bases of 2 phase I, 9 phase II, 6 phase III, and 2 long-
term extension studies of tofacitinib in RA patients.
Crude incidence rates (IRs) of all HZ events (serious
and nonserious) per 100 patient-years (with 95% confi-
dence intervals [95% CIs]) were calculated for unique
patients. Within phase III studies, we described HZ
rates according to concomitant csDMARD treatment
and baseline GC use. A multivariable Cox proportional
hazards regression model was used to evaluate HZ risk
factors across studies.
Results. Across all studies (6,192 patients; 16,839
patient-years), HZ was reported in 636 tofacitinib-
treated patients (IR 4.0, 95% CI 3.7–4.4). In most cases
(93%), HZ was classified as nonserious, and the majority
of patients (94%) had involvement of only 1 dermatome.
HZ IRs varied across regions, from 2.4 (95% CI 2.0–2.9)
in Eastern Europe to 8.0 (95% CI 6.6–9.6) in Japan and
8.4 (95% CI 6.4–10.9) in Korea. Within phase III studies,
HZ IRs varied according to tofacitinib dose, background
csDMARD treatment, and baseline use of GCs. The IRs
were numerically lowest for monotherapy with tofacitinib
5 mg twice daily without GCs (IR 0.56 [95% CI 0.07–
2.01]) and highest for tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily with
csDMARDs and GCs (IR 5.44 [95% CI 3.72–7.68]). Age,
GC use, tofacitinib dose, and enrollment within Asia
were independent risk factors for HZ.
Conclusion. Patients receiving treatment with
tofacitinib and GCs appear to have a greater risk of
developing
HZ
compared
with
patients
receiving
tofacitinib monotherapy without GCs.
Shingles, also known as herpes zoster (HZ), is
caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV)
and is a common and potentially debilitating illness (1,2).

 Approximately one-third of the general population will
develop HZ within their lifetime (1), and ;10% of these
patients develop postherpetic neuralgia, which can last
for months to years and cause significant pain and mor-
bidity (3). Rarely, but especially in immunosuppressed
patients, reactivation can result in disseminated or vis-
ceral disease, such as encephalitis, or other complications
(1). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a 1.5-
fold to 2-fold higher risk of HZ compared with similarly
aged individuals in the general population (4,5). This risk
is related in part to the disease itself but can be further
increased by RA treatments (4).
Glucocorticoids (GCs), including prednisone,
are well-documented risk factors for HZ (6,7), and
more recently, use of JAK inhibitors, including both
tofacitinib and baricitinib, has been associated with a
higher rate of HZ (8–10). In addition, although not
all studies have documented an increased risk attribut-
able to biologic therapies (11,12), a recent systematic
review suggested an increased risk of HZ associated
with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist treatment
(13), and a theoretical risk is associated with various
conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX) and
chloroquine (14,15). Given the increased risk of HZ
observed among patients with RA compared with the
general population and the risk associated with RA
therapies, it is possible that the risk of HZ may be fur-
ther increased when such therapies are combined.
Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treat-
ment of RA. We recently reported an increased risk of
HZ with tofacitinib therapy compared with placebo dur-
ing the tofacitinib global clinical development program
for RA (8). Although the risk of HZ was increased
throughout the global program, this risk varied by geo-
graphic region, with significantly higher rates reported
in Japan and Korea. Many of the patients in the phase
III program also used concomitant csDMARDs as well
as GCs (8). We undertook the current analysis to better
characterize the clinical aspects of HZ events with lon-
ger periods of follow-up and exposure, and to evaluate
whether the risk of HZ is greater in patients receiving
tofacitinib and concomitant MTX and GCs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The global tofacitinib RA development program con-
sisted of 2 phase I, 9 phase II, 6 phase III, and 2 open-label
long-term extension (LTE) studies and included a total of
6,192 tofacitinib-treated patients with 16,839 patient-years of
tofacitinib exposure at the time of the datacut (April 2014).
LTE study A3921024 data collection and analyses were still
ongoing at the time of this analysis; because the study database
had not yet been locked, some values may change in the final
locked study database. Details of these trials with regard to
tofacitinib dosing and study conduct have previously been pub-
lished (16–33). Patients with a history of recurrent HZ (.1
episode), disseminated HZ (single episode), or disseminated
herpes simplex (single episode) were excluded from these tri-
als. Patients who had previously experienced an HZ event
involving a single dermatome were eligible to participate.
All studies were conducted in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on
Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the
regulations of the relevant local countries. All enrolled
patients provided written informed consent, and all participat-
ing institutions provided institutional review board or ethics
committee approval prior to participation.
HZ reporting and adjudication.
For each study,
adverse event (AE) data were reported by site investigators
and entered into the Pfizer clinical database. Standard Medi-
cal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities codes were used to
categorize AEs, and infectious AEs, such as HZ, were graded
as “serious” if they were associated with hospitalization or
death, were medically important, or required treatment with
parenteral therapy. All patients with serious HZ events discon-
tinued tofacitinib treatment, according to the study protocols,
but patients with nonserious HZ were permitted to continue
in the trial. All cases of HZ reported to involve .1 dermatome
were evaluated by an independent adjudication committee
and designated as multidermatomal (nonadjacent or .2 adja-
cent dermatomes) or disseminated. Dermatome maps com-
pleted by investigators at the study sites were used during the
adjudication process.
Incidence rate (IR) calculation.
Across the global
tofacitinib RA development program, HZ events in tofacitinib-
treated patients were captured. We calculated crude IRs of the
number of unique patients with HZ events per 100 patient-
years (with 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]), and stratified
the data by race, age, baseline DMARD use, baseline GC use,
and other factors. Patients were censored at the time of the first
HZ event, death, or study withdrawal, whichever came first.
Crude HZ IRs of the first HZ event over the entire phase I,
phase II, phase III, and LTE study time period were calculated.
Due to variability within this pooled data set with respect to
concomitant DMARD treatment and tofacitinib dose, only
phase III data (for which concomitant therapies and tofacitinib
dose were held constant) were used to examine IRs stratified
with regard to these factors.
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of risk
factors for HZ.
To evaluate risk factors for HZ among
tofacitinib-treated patients, we used pooled data from the
phase I, phase II, phase III, and LTE studies. Univariate anal-
ysis using a Cox proportional hazards regression model was
performed on known risk factors for HZ and those of potential
interest based on clinical considerations (see Supplementary
Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40189/abstract). A
pool of factors was then formed to select the final multivariable
Cox proportional hazards regression model for the analysis
of the time to HZ event from the first dose of tofacitinib,
including age, sex, disease duration, baseline 4-variable Disease
Activity Score in 28 joints (34) using the C-reactive protein level
(DAS28-CRP), baseline absolute lymphocyte count, baseline
diabetes mellitus, baseline Health Assessment Questionnaire

and geographic region. A backward selection process with
the criterion to stay in the model fixed at 10% was used to
screen and select the risk factors. The final Cox propor-
tional hazards regression model included all of the risk
factors that were selected using the backward procedure.
The tofacitinib group was added in a time-varying format;
any other risk factors that were not selected by the proce-
dure but were considered as being clinically relevant would
be forced back into the final model. Age, BMI, 4-variable
DAS28-CRP, disease duration, and baseline absolute lym-
phocyte count were evaluated as continuous variables. All
analyses were conducted using SAS software.

 RESULTS
Summary of HZ events during phase I, phase
II, phase III, and LTE studies. Among 6,192 patients
with 16,839 patient-years of tofacitinib exposure, we
identified 636 patients (10%) who developed HZ over a
median follow-up period of 3.0 years of tofacitinib expo-
sure and in whom the median time to first HZ event was
1.6 years. The overall crude IR for the first HZ event in
tofacitinib-treated patients was 4.0 (95% CI 3.7–4.4).
Similar to a previous study by our group (8), the crude
IRs varied widely across regions of enrollment and were
numerically lowest in Eastern Europe (2.4 [95% CI 2.0–
2.9]) and Western Europe (3.3 [95% CI 2.4–4.4]) and
highest in Asia, particularly in Japan (8.0 [95% CI 6.6–
9.6]) and Korea (8.4 [95% CI 6.4–10.9]) (Table 1).
For the first HZ event, the majority of patients
(597 [93.9%]) had single-dermatome involvement, 46
patients (7.2%) were classified as having a serious HZ
event, and no case resulted in death. Most patients (570
[89.6%]) received antiviral therapy while being treated
with tofacitinib. After the first HZ event, tofacitinib
treatment was continued in 274 patients (43.1%), while
267 patients (42.0%) temporarily stopped receiving
tofacitinib, 5 patients (0.8%) reduced the tofacitinib
dose during the event, 51 patients (8.0%) permanently
discontinued
tofacitinib
treatment,
and
treatment
changes were not reported in 39 patients (6.1%). Of the
first HZ events, 602 cases had resolved at the time of
the current analysis, with a median time to resolution of
21 days (range 1–733). The clinical study investigators
reported that 47 (7.4%) of the initial patients developed
postherpetic neuralgia.
Similar outcomes were reported for subsequent
HZ events. Forty-seven patients (0.8% of all patients;
7.4% of patients in whom HZ developed) reported hav-
ing at least 1 additional HZ event later during the study.
None of the patients with a second HZ event had multi-
ple dermatomes or visceral dissemination; 2 patients
(4.3%) were graded as having serious AEs, and these
patients were withdrawn from the study. Among the
patients with a second HZ event, 19 (40.4%) continued
to receive therapy during the event, 22 (46.8%) stopped
tofacitinib temporarily during the event, and 4 (8.5%)
permanently discontinued tofacitinib. The median time
to resolution of a second HZ event was 20 days (range
4–122). Eight patients reported a third HZ event, and 1
patient experienced a total of 6 separate HZ events.

 4.9–5.4 years), baseline characteristics in phase III studies
were similar between patients receiving concomitant
DMARDs and those receiving tofacitinib monotherapy
(Table 2). For patients receiving concomitant DMARDs,
most (92.2%) were receiving MTX. GC use was similar
(;50%) between patients receiving either dose of
tofacitinib with or without concomitant csDMARDs.
Although 681 patients received placebo in the
phase III studies, the exposure time was very limited
(202.7 patient-years), and only 3 patients were reported
as having HZ during their exposure to placebo, with a
crude IR of 1.5 (95% CI 0.3–4.3). As such, placebo data
were not included in this stratified analysis. Details of
these events in placebo-treated patients have previously
been reported (8). All placebo-treated patients who
reported HZ received concomitant csDMARDs, and
1 patient also received background GCs.
Crude IRs varied according to tofacitinib dose as
well as treatment with background GCs and csDMARDs.
Overall, the crude HZ IR among patients receiving
tofacitinib 10 mg was numerically higher than that among
those receiving 5 mg twice daily (4.1 [95% CI 3.3–5.2]
versus 3.3 [95% CI 2.6–4.3]). Trends were seen for both
the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily dosage groups,
in which the HZ IR was numerically lower in the absence
of either background csDMARD or GC treatment
(Figure 1). Numerically, the highest crude IR was
observed in patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice
daily and both background DMARDs and GCs (5.4
[95% CI 3.7–7.7], based on 32 unique patients with
events from among 550 patients with 606 patient-years of
exposure) and the lowest crude IR was observed among
patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily as mono-
therapy without GCs (0.56 [95% CI 0.07–2.0], based on 2
unique patients with events among 296 patients with 361
patient-years of exposure).
Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis of HZ risk factors among
patients treated with tofacitinib in pooled phase I,
phase II, phase III, and LTE studies. In the Cox uni-
variate analysis, a number of factors showed an associa-
tion with an increased risk of HZ (see Supplementary
Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web
site
at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.
40189/abstract). Using the pool of risk factors identified
by the univariate analysis and based on clinical consider-
ation, after applying the backward selection procedure,
4 factors were selected for the final Cox proportional
hazards regression model (Figure 2). These factors
included baseline age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% CI
1.31–1.52; unit 5 10 years), baseline GC use (for .0 to
#5 mg/day versus 0 mg/day, HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22–

Canada/Australia versus Western Europe, HR 1.43,
95% CI 1.02–2.02), and smoking status (former smoker
or nonsmoker versus smoker, HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04–
1.69). The time-varying tofacitinib dose, which was
added to the final model, also appeared to be a risk fac-
tor for HZ (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14–1.54; unit 5 5 mg,
e.g., an increase from 5 mg to 10 mg). Background
csDMARD treatment was considered to be clinically
relevant and was forced back into the final model,
although it was not selected using the backward selec-
tion procedure. This factor did not appear to show an
association with an increased risk of HZ (background
DMARDs versus monotherapy, HR 1.10 [95% CI 0.94–
1.30]).
DISCUSSION
We evaluated the long-term risk of HZ within
the tofacitinib clinical development program for RA,
with specific attention to the contribution of concomi-
tant csDMARD therapy and GCs to the development of
HZ. This analysis was performed following our prelimi-
nary evaluation of this question, in which we noted high
rates of HZ among tofacitinib-treated patients com-
pared with the expected rates in other studies in RA
patients receiving TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy (8).
Our current analysis includes a greater number of
patients and longer exposure to tofacitinib than in the
preliminary study. Analysis of this RA cohort, with
almost 17,000 patient-years of tofacitinib exposure,
suggests that use of concomitant GCs and age contrib-
ute to the risk of HZ, and that patients receiving
tofacitinib at a dosage of 10 mg twice daily may be at
higher risk than those using 5 mg twice daily. Data
from phase III studies also indicated a trend toward
higher rates of HZ in patients receiving background
csDMARDs, particularly when combined with GCs.
Our findings suggest that the use of the Food and
Drug Administration–approved 5 mg twice daily dos-
age, and elimination of concomitant therapies, may
represent potential risk-reduction strategies for physi-
cians and patients, provided disease activity remains
controlled. Overall, the HZ events seemed to be clini-
cally manageable and resolved in the majority of cases.
Regardless of concomitant therapy or tofacitinib dose,
patients from Japan and Korea have the highest risk of
HZ compared with that in other regions. It has also
previously been reported that the HZ incidence is
consistent over time in tofacitinib-treated patients, sug-
gesting no increased risk for HZ with longer exposure
to tofacitinib (10).
In our analysis of phase III studies, we observed
that patients receiving tofacitinib at a dosage of 5 mg
twice daily as monotherapy without GCs had a numeri-
cally 10-fold lower incidence of HZ compared with the
patients receiving tofacitinib at a dosage of 10 mg twice
daily with concomitant csDMARDs and GCs (exposure
time was lower in the former group, which may increase
variance). The incidence of HZ in patients receiving
tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily as monotherapy without
GCs (crude IR 0.56 [95% CI 0.07–2.01]) was similar to
the incidence reported in those receiving biologic thera-
pies, including patients who were and those who were
not receiving concomitant MTX and GCs (6,12). GCs
are a well-described dose-dependent risk factor for HZ
worldwide (6,7).
Several studies have also shown an increased risk
of HZ in association with biologic therapies, with similar
risk factors for HZ identified, including the use of GCs
(6,11–13). There are limited data, however, showing
that MTX itself increases the risk of HZ in patients with
RA (4). A prior meta-analysis of observational studies
in RA failed to identify an association (14), and a subse-
quent population-based study in Minnesota also demon-
strated no increased risk with MTX (36). A study in
patients with psoriasis showed no increased risk of HZ
in patients treated with MTX but did document an
increased risk when MTX was combined with TNF
blockers (37), and an analysis of psoriatic arthritis had
similar findings, in that MTX was a risk only when it
was administered in combination with biologic agents
(38). We could not evaluate whether MTX alone causes
HZ, and although concomitant csDMARD treatment
appeared to increase the incidence of HZ in phase III
studies, csDMARD treatment was not identified as an
independent risk factor for HZ based on the Cox pro-
portional hazards regression model used to evaluate HZ
risk factors across all phases of the tofacitinib program.
The mechanism by which tofacitinib increases
the risk of HZ is not well understood but may be related
to inhibition of interferon (IFN) signaling. Antiviral
defenses rely on type I and II IFN signaling via the
JAK/STAT
pathway
(39),
which
is
inhibited
by
tofacitinib (40,41). This hypothesis is supported by
results from studies of sifalimumab, an anti-IFNa
monoclonal antibody, which showed a substantial dose-
dependent increase in the incidence of HZ following
antibody treatment in patients with systemic lupus ery-
thematosus (SLE) (42). An increase in the incidence of
HZ was also observed in patients with SLE in a phase II
RISK OF HZ WITH TOFACITINIB AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY
1965
 study of the anti-IFN inhibitor anifrolumab (43) and in
a phase I study of rontalizumab (44). The association
between
MTX
treatment,
GC
treatment,
and
an
increased risk of HZ may also be explained by changes
in IFN signaling, because concomitant GC and/or MTX
treatment has been shown to suppress IFN signaling in
patients with RA (45,46). Other mechanisms, including
T cell alterations and cytokine inhibition, may also be
involved.
Similar to the observations in our prior analysis
(8), these data showed the risk of HZ to be substantially
higher in certain areas of Asia. The IRs were shown to
be highest in Japan and Korea, whereas rates elsewhere
in Asia were comparable to those seen in Western
Europe or North America. This raises the possibility
that a genetic predisposition toward HZ under the con-
dition of JAK inhibition might exist in some of these
populations.
However,
regional
differences
in
HZ
reporting due to different access to health care profes-
sionals may also contribute. Bing et al reported 2
polymorphisms that were suggested to be associated
with a higher risk of HZ in tofacitinib-treated patients,
although these polymorphisms were relatively rare and
explained only a fraction of the increased risk observed
in the Japanese patients (47). It is possible that other
genetic factors could explain this. However, it is unlikely
that this is attributable to a difference in background
varicella rates, because the seroprevalence of varicella
in these Asian regions is similar to that in North Amer-
ica (48).
Although we are uncertain how many of the
patients enrolled in this program in North America or
elsewhere received shingles vaccination, because we did
not collect a vaccination history prior to study entry, it is
likely that very few or no patients received the vaccina-
tion prior to entering these studies. Population-based
studies suggested that vaccine uptake during the period
in which these studies were conducted was very poor
among patients with RA in the US (49), and the vaccine
was not available for use in some countries where
enrollment took place (e.g., Japan). Furthermore, the
vaccine is currently contraindicated for use during
tofacitinib or biologic therapy, so it is unlikely that any
patients were vaccinated during the LTE studies. How-
ever, studies are ongoing to evaluate the safety and
immunogenicity of this vaccine when it is given before
starting tofacitinib treatment (50).
Tofacitinib appears to be associated with an
increased risk of HZ compared with TNFi therapy, and
other JAK inhibitors, such as baricitinib, have also been
associated with higher rates of HZ (9,51). However,
direct comparisons with baricitinib are limited by the
considerably shorter follow-up period and number of
patient-years of exposure to baricitinib compared with
tofacitinib. A large proportion of patients continued or
only temporarily discontinued tofacitinib treatment dur-
ing their HZ event, although almost all patients received
antiviral
therapy
while
receiving
tofacitinib,
which
could potentially have protected against dissemination.
According to the tofacitinib product label, treatment
should be temporarily withdrawn during any serious
infection, including HZ, until the infection is resolving,
and patients should be closely monitored during any
infection (52).
A recent analysis showed that postherpetic neu-
ralgia occurred in 9.1% of patients with RA in whom
HZ developed, with the incidence of postherpetic
neuralgia increasing with age (53). In the tofacitinib
development program, 7.4% of patients developed
postherpetic neuralgia following their first HZ event.
However, because reports of postherpetic neuralgia
were not systematically requested, our findings may
represent an underestimation of this complication.
Interestingly, our study showed that current smoking
was protective against HZ. There is some evidence that
smoking can influence IFN signaling in mice (54). How-
ever, to our knowledge, our study is the first to demon-
strate that smoking is protective against HZ. This
finding is in contrast to at least 1 study of zoster
ophthalmicus, in which smokers had a much earlier
onset of HZ compared with nonsmokers (55).
In this analysis, our ability to evaluate the influ-
ence of GC dosage on the risk of HZ was limited. The
exact dose of GCs and the total duration of GC use was
not reported for many patients. In addition, we were
unable to evaluate the influence of MTX dosage on the
risk of HZ. Another limitation of this analysis was the
substantially
smaller
number
of
patient-years
of
tofacitinib exposure in the monotherapy group com-
pared with the combination therapy groups, leading to
less robust incidence estimates for the monotherapy
group.
In summary, we have described the long-term
risk of HZ among patients treated with tofacitinib.
Importantly, we found that the risk of HZ is likely to be
greater in patients receiving tofacitinib in combination
with GCs compared with those receiving monotherapy
without GCs. Given that similar efficacy has been
observed with tofacitinib in phase III clinical studies
regardless of whether it is administered as monotherapy
or in combination with csDMARDs and/or GCs (56),
the use of tofacitinib monotherapy without GCs could
represent a risk-reduction strategy for physicians and
patients with regard to HZ and provide an effective
1966
WINTHROP ET AL
 treatment strategy for reduction of the signs and
symptoms of RA, provided the patient’s RA remains
controlled. It is also notable that HZ events were mostly
nonserious and resolved with standard antiviral treat-
ment. Furthermore, physicians should continue to con-
sider shingles vaccination prior to starting tofacitinib
or biologic therapy. Further research is necessary to
understand why Japanese and Korean patients are at
increased risk, as well as to understand the mechanism
by which JAK inhibition combined with GCs leads to
higher rates of VZV reactivation.
