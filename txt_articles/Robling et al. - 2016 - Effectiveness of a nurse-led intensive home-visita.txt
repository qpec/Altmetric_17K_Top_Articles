Summary
Background Many countries now off
 er support to teenage mothers to help them to achieve long-term socioeconomic 
stability and to give a successful start to their children. The Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is a licensed intensive 
home-visiting intervention developed in the USA and introduced into practice in England that involves up to 
64 structured home visits from early pregnancy until the child’s second birthday by specially recruited and trained 
family nurses. We aimed to assess the eff
 ectiveness of giving the programme to teenage fi
 rst-time mothers on infant 
and maternal outcomes up to 24 months after birth.
Methods We did a pragmatic, non-blinded, randomised controlled, parallel-group trial in community midwifery 
settings at 18 partnerships between local authorities and primary and secondary care organisations in England. Eligible 
participants were nulliparous and aged 19 years or younger, and were recruited at less than 25 weeks’ gestation. Field-
based researchers randomly allocated mothers (1:1) via remote randomisation (telephone and web) to FNP plus usual 
care (publicly funded health and social care) or to usual care alone. Allocation was stratifi
 ed by site and minimised by 
gestation (<16 weeks vs ≥16 weeks), smoking status (yes vs no), and preferred language of data collection (English vs 
non-English). Mothers and assessors (local researchers at baseline and 24 months’ follow-up) were not masked to 
group allocation, but telephone interviewers were blinded. Primary endpoints were biomarker-calibrated self-reported 
tobacco use by the mother at late pregnancy, birthweight of the baby, the proportion of women with a second pregnancy 
within 24 months post-partum, and emergency attendances and hospital admissions for the child within 24 months 
post-partum. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN23019866.
Findings Between June 16, 2009, and July 28, 2010, we screened 3251 women. After enrolment, 823 women were 
randomly assigned to receive FNP and 822 to usual care. All follow-up data were retrieved by April 25, 2014. 304 (56%) 
of 547 women assigned to FNP and 306 (56%) of 545 assigned to usual care smoked at late pregnancy (adjusted odds 
ratio [AOR] 0·90, 97·5% CI 0·64–1·28). Mean birthweight of 742 babies with mothers assigned to FNP was 3217·4 g 
(SD 618·0), whereas birthweight of 768 babies assigned to usual care was 3197·5 g (SD 581·5; adjusted mean diff
 erence 
20·75 g, 97·5% CI –47·73 to 89·23. 587 (81%) of 725 assessed children with mothers assigned to FNP and 577 (77%) 
of 753 assessed children assigned to usual care attended an emergency department or were admitted to hospital at 
least once before their second birthday (AOR 1·32, 97·5% CI 0·99–1·76). 426 (66%) of 643 assessed women assigned 
to FNP and 427 (66%) 646 assigned to usual care had a second pregnancy within 2 years (AOR 1·01, 0·77–1·33). At 
least one serious adverse event (mainly clinical events associated with pregnancy and infancy period) was reported for 
310 (38%) of 808 participants (mother–child) in the usual care group and 357 (44%) of 810 in the FNP group, none of 
which were considered related to the intervention.
Interpretation Adding FNP to the usually provided health and social care provided no additional short-term benefi
 t to 
our primary outcomes. Programme continuation is not justifi
 ed on the basis of available evidence, but could be 
reconsidered should supportive longer-term evidence emerge.

Introduction
Individual, social, and economic circumstances faced by 
teenage mothers can challenge a successful start 
for children and interrupt mothers’ long-term socio 
-
economic stability. Children of teenage mothers are 
more likely to have lower birthweight, not be breastfed, 
be at greater risk of accidents and early death, do worse 
educationally, have more emotional and behavioural 
problems, and become teenage parents themselves.1–4 
Inter 
vention early in the lives of families with young 
mothers might enhance life chances for both mother 
and child.5–8

Several home-visiting interventions have been introduced 
to support families, with evidence of their benefi
 t mostly 
reported from the USA.9 Programmes typically address 
multiple maternal and child outcomes and can improve 
birth outcomes, cognitive and socio 
economic development, 
use of preventive health care, and reduce potential abuse 
(eg, injuries, ingestions, and emergency department 
attendances) and maltreatment.10–13
In England, the Healthy Child Programme (HCP) forms 
the universal off
 er of clinical and public health for children 
and families during pregnancy to adulthood.14 Specifi
 c 
programmes to support children growing up in 
disadvantaged circumstances have included area-based 
Sure Start local programmes and the more targeted Sure 
Start Plus schemes for pregnant teenage girls.15–17 In 2006, 
the UK Government announced its intention to test the 
Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme, University 
of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA, as an intensive preventive 
home-visiting service. FNP was initially adapted from the 
US Nurse Family Partnership programme, one of 
12 programmes meeting criteria for an evidence-based 
model.13,18–21 FNP is a fee-based programme available only 
under licence, with the intellectual property owned by the 
University of Colorado who retain authority for approving 
any alterations. Three US evaluations (in Elmira [NY], 
Memphis [TN], and Denver [CO]) have taken place, as well 
as one in the Netherlands, with positive results for 
mothers and babies.18,20–22
For roll-out in England, an implementation evaluation in 
ten sites involving fi
 rst-time pregnant women aged up to 
23 years at enrolment preceded our trial and reported 
evaluation results (pregnancy and post-partum period) 
focused on feasibility and acceptability from 2008.23–25 As 
the third phase of a model of international replication 
(after adaptation and pilot testing phases), we aimed to 
establish the eff
 ectiveness of FNP when delivered in a 
broadly based, publicly funded, health-care setting.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a pragmatic, open-label, individually randomised 
controlled trial to compare usual care (through primary-
care public health and social care services) plus FNP (FNP 
group) to usually provided health and social care alone 
(usual care group). The protocol has been published.26 The 
18 study sites were partnerships of primary and secondary 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed the existing trial evidence in May, 2008. Because 
intellectual property is owned by the University of Colorado, all 
previous trials were restricted to the three US evaluations (in 
Elmira [NY], Memphis [TN], and Denver [CO]). As is commonly 
found in home-visiting evaluations, each trial in the USA 
identifi
 ed multiple outcomes and was not formally adjusted for 
multiple signifi
 cance testing. The trials reported positive eff
 ects 
in prenatal health behaviours, birth outcomes, sensitive child 
care, child and adolescent functioning, and maternal lifecourse. 
Two outcomes with prior replicated positive eff
 ects by 
24 months post-partum are changes in smoking and second 
pregnancy. In Elmira, the intervention reduced cigarettes 
smoked by four, and in Denver a reduction in cotinine was 
reported in mothers who received the intervention. In Memphis, 
nurse-visited mothers reported fewer second pregnancies by 
24 months post-partum (36% vs 47%). In Denver, nurse-visited 
mothers reported fewer subsequent pregnancies by 24 months 
post-partum (29% vs 41%). In 2013, a trial of the intervention in 
the Netherlands reported lower rates of smoking in 
nurse-visited women in late pregnancy.
Added value of this study
Because the programme was adapted for use in England and 
used young age as an enrolment criteria, we would not regard 
our work as a simple replication study of previous trials, 
although the intervention remained a licensed programme. 
Rather, our trial provides data for the intervention as adapted 
for implementation in a UK setting and delivered in a 
substantially diff
 erent publicly funded and confi
 gured 
health-care system. We show that adding the Family Nurse 
Partnership programme to usual care provided no additional 
short-term benefi
 t for our selected primary outcomes (smoking 
in pregnancy, birthweight, emergency hospital attendance and 
admission for the child, and subsequent pregnancy). The study 
fi
 ndings are the most directly applicable to practice and setting 
in the UK, where the programme is now provided in England 
under the operating framework for the NHS to about 
16 000 concurrent women in parallel and subsequent to the 
trial period. The lack of benefi
 t evidenced for changes in 
smoking during pregnancy and second pregnancies therefore 
limits the degree to which programme benefi
 ts shown 
elsewhere can be assumed in diff
 erent health-care settings and 
to diff
 erent service populations, even when objective 
programme fi
 delity from US trials was maintained.
Implications of all the available evidence
Continued provision of the Family Nurse Partnership 
programme cannot be supported on the basis of the trial 
evidence found for its eff
 ectiveness in the UK setting. 
Subsequent changes to the intervention itself, to usually 
provided care, or to the population targeted would justify 
re-examination. Similarly, any positive benefi
 ts observed 
through longer-term follow-up of the current trial cohort might 
shift the evidentiary balance in favour of the intervention and 
warrants continued evaluation of the trial cohort. Nevertheless, 
the overall level of unaddressed clinical need such as smoking in 
pregnancy (56%) and rate of subsequent pregnancies (66%) 
remains high in this population and a public health challenge 
that remains unresolved.

local National Health Service (NHS) organisations and 
local authorities. Sites applied to the Department for 
Health to deliver FNP and additionally to participate in the 
trial with selection against set eligibility criteria (appendix).
To be eligible, women had to be nulliparous, aged 
19 years or younger, living within the catchment area of a 
local FNP team, of less than 25 weeks’ gestation, and able 
to provide consent and speak English. Women expecting 
multiple births and those with a previous pregnancy 
ending in miscarriage, stillbirth, or termination were 
eligible. Women planning to have their child adopted or 
to move outside of the FNP catchment area for longer 
than 3 months were not eligible. Women were identifi
 ed 
and approached via local maternity services and recruited 
usually at their home by locally based researchers. The 
study was approved by the Wales NHS Research Ethics 
Committee (09/MRE09/08) and received governance 
approval from all participating NHS sites. All women 
provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Women were randomly assigned to FNP or usual care, 
with randomisation stratifi
 ed by site and minimised by 
gestation (<16 weeks vs ≥16 weeks), smoking (yes vs no), 
and preferred language of data collection (English vs non-
English) and weighted towards minimising the imbalance 
in trial groups with probability 0·8. The allocation 
programme was created by a programmer at the Bristol 
Randomised Trials Collaboration, a registered Clinical 
Trials Unit, and allocation was concealed using a remote 
computer-based system, accessible via telephone and 
internet by the recruiting researcher. Mothers and fi
 eld-
based researchers (even if also assessors) were not masked 
to group allocation, but assessors collecting data by 
computer-assisted telephone interview were masked to 
allocation.
Procedures
FNP involves up to 64 structured home visits by specially 
recruited 
and 
trained 
family 
nurses 
(appendix). 
Developed in the USA for fi
 rst-time pregnant women, it 
was adapted under licence for delivery in England from 
early pregnancy until children were 2 years old. FNP 
aims to aff
 ect risks and protective factors within prenatal 
health-related behaviours, sensitive and competent care-
giving, and early parental lifecourse. Core specialist 
training for nurses includes motivational interviewing 
and the adoption of a guiding autonomy-supportive 
communication style with clients.
All participants (both groups) were eligible to receive 
usually provided publicly funded health and social care. 
This included the HCP (universally off
 ered screening, 
education, immunisation, and support from birth to the 
child’s second birthday) delivered by either family nurses 
(FNP group) or specialist community public health 
nurses (usual care group), and maternity care appropriate 
to clinical need.
Routine data were collected by fi
 eld-based researchers 
from maternity units, by direct data download by a trial 
statistician from the Health and Social Care Information 
Centre (HSCIC), by fi
 eld-based researchers or practice 
staff
  from primary care centres, from the Abortions 
Statistics Manager at the Department of Health for 
abortion statistics, and from COVER (Coverage Of 
Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly) contacts directly from 
primary health-care authorities and used to obtain 
information about birthweight, emergency department 
attendances and admissions and second pregnancies, as 
well as for some secondary outcomes. Additionally, 
information about emergency department attendance 
and admissions, and second pregnancies was collected by 
maternal report. Information about tobacco use was 
collected by self-report and from urine samples. Self-
report data for secondary outcomes (appendix) were 
collected at baseline (before allocation) and 24 months 
post-partum by local researchers using a face-to-face 
structured 
computer-assisted 
personal 
interview; 
interviewers were not blinded to allocation but 
independent 
of 
service 
provision. 
Offi
  ce-based 
researchers who were blind to allocation used computer-
assisted telephone interviews to collect self-reported data 
at late pregnancy (34–36 weeks’ gestation), and 6, 12 and 
18 months post-partum.
Urine samples for cotinine assay were obtained during 
the 
baseline 
interview 
and 
at 
late 
pregnancy 
(34–36 weeks’ gestation). At both timepoints women 
were categorised as non-smokers if they reported not 
smoking in the 3 days before interview and had a urinary 
cotinine concentration lower than 100 ng/mL. When 
only baseline cotinine concentrations were available, 
women reporting not smoking at late pregnancy and 
who were classifi
 ed as either accurate or over-reporters of 
tobacco use (from comparing baseline self-report and 
cotinine concentrations; appendix) were also categorised 
as non-smokers. All other women were categorised as 
smokers in the primary analysis. 
To measure the number of contacts between women 
and support workers in both groups, mothers reported 
access to health care during the trial (including visits 
from community midwives and health visitors) and 
family nurses reported contact with their clients.
Participants were able to withdraw at any time and had 
the right to withdraw use of data already collected. 
Women who wanted to discontinue the intervention were 
off
 ered the opportunity to still provide follow-up data. All 
participants who had not formally withdrawn were asked 
if they would complete the 24 month post-partum 
assessment, even if they had previously not responded to 
data collection in preceding waves of follow-up. Women 
were regarded as mandatory withdrawals should 
miscarriage, death, or adoption of the child occur. Adverse 
events notifi
 ed to the trials offi
  ce by standard reporting 
template were reviewed by a senior clinical researcher 
(JS) to establish relatedness and severity.

Outcomes
Primary outcomes were tobacco use at late pregnancy 
(34–36 weeks’ gestation), birthweight, emergency 
attendances and hospital admissions for the infant 
within 24 months of birth, and the proportion of women 
with a second pregnancy within 24 months post-partum 
(appendix). Secondary prespecifi
 ed outcomes were 
collected for many measures of pregnancy and birth, 
child health and development, and parental lifecourse 
from late pregnancy up to 24 months post-partum; a full 
list is in the appendix and the published protocol.26 
Adverse events were reported via standard template and 
were categorised as an adverse event, serious adverse 
event, and expected serious adverse event (appendix).
Statistical analysis
We estimated eff
 ect sizes detectable given the number of 
available sites, recruitment period, and eligibility, 
consent, and follow-up rates. We calculated that a sample 
of 1418 women was needed to provide at least 90% power 
at the two-sided 2·5% α level to detect diff
 erences 
between trial groups of 10% (30% vs 40%) in proportion 
having any emergency attendance or hospital admission, 
and of 7·5% (12·5% vs 20·0%) in proportions of women 
with a second pregnancy by 24 months post-partum (ie, 
one child and one maternal outcome). We allowed for a 
pregnancy loss of 1·5% on the basis of clinically informed 
estimates (>16 week miscarriage rate of around 1%, 
terminations for fetal anomalies 0·02%, and a stillbirth 
rate of 0·5%) in our calculations. We expected to obtain 
follow-up data for three primary outcomes for 90% of 
participants using medical records. Therefore, we aimed 
to recruit 1600 pregnant women. We chose a 2·5% α level 
to allow for multiple primary outcomes within each 
individual population (ie, two primary outcomes each for 
mother and child).
All analyses were done by intention to treat without 
imputation, with outcome values compared between 
groups using mixed-eff
 ects three-level regression models 
to adjust for site as a stratifi
 cation variable and to allow 
for clustering by a family nurse in the intervention 
group. When clustering was negligible in the FNP group 
at level of family nurse, as assessed by the Family Nurse 
level variance component from the three-level model, the 
simpler two-level model was used. Models were also 
adjusted for minimisation variables. For continuous 
outcomes, we fi
 tted a linear-regression model and 
presented results as diff
 erence in adjusted means 
(FNP minus usual care). Estimates were obtained using 
restricted maximum likelihood. For binary outcomes a 
logistic model was used and the result presented as 
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) comparing the odds of an 
event in FNP compared with usual care group. Count 
data were analysed using a Poisson multilevel model or a 
negative binomial model if overdispersion was evident.
Where applicable, an analysis of covariance model was 
used with baseline measurement as a covariate. Where 
data were collected over several timepoints, a repeated 
measures model (using a generalised linear mixed model) 
was used with timepoints (6, 12, 18, and 24 months) nested 
within participants (nested within family nurse and site) 
and included an interaction term for time and trial group 
to investigate any divergent or convergent pattern in 
outcomes. The global interaction eff
 ect was tested and 
was in all cases non-signifi
 cant, and the interaction and 
time term were both dropped from the model. Both the 
intercepts and slopes of participants’ measures were 
allowed to vary randomly when possible. Various 
hierarchies were investigated, and the Akaike information 
criterion (AIC) used to establish the best fi
 tting model.
We estimated costs per participant (including all health-
related costs and intervention costs) from the perspective 
of the NHS and personal social services and discounted 
where appropriate. We did multiple imputation to allow 
for missing data and sensitivity analysis to assess 
robustness of results from this and other assumptions.
We assessed intervention delivery against FNP-
specifi
 ed fi
 delity goals including gestation at programme 
enrolment, number of valid visits received, attrition 
rates, visit duration, and coverage of planned visit content 
(appendix). Additional qualitative and quantitative 
substudies were also done to map usual care and assess 
use of motivational interviewing in routine FNP 
consultations, programme clients’ experience, and 
perspectives of professionals (health visitors, midwives, 
and family nurses), but these are reported separately. 
Analyses were done by two statisticians (RC-J and 
ZESR) using SPSS version 20 and Stata version 13. An 
independent data monitoring committee, reporting to an 
independent steering committee, oversaw the study. The 
trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number 
ISRCTN23019866.
Role of the funding source
The Department of Health (England) commissioned and 
funded the study, managed the grant application process, 
and acted as sponsor. The funder required the inclusion 
of specifi
 ed policy-relevant primary outcomes and 
determined the number of study sites, but played no role 
in fi
 nalising study design, data collection, data analysis, 
data interpretation, or report writing. The corresponding 
author had full access to all study data, vouches for data 
accuracy and completeness, and had fi
 nal responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between June 16, 2009, and July 28, 2010, 3251 women 
were screened (fi
 gure). 1645 women were recruited, with 
fi
 ve subsequently excluded due to non-eligibility. 
22 women who chose to withdraw also removed consent 
for use of their data. 121 women had withdrawn by late 
pregnancy and a further 72 subsequently, either electively 
or mandatorily, hence 215 women withdrew in total. 
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between trial

according to timing of planned assessment and data 
source (fi
 gure). 24 month post-partum participant 
assessments were completed by April 24, 2013, and 
HSCIC data retrieved by April 25, 2014.
The proportion of mothers who smoked at late 
pregnancy did not diff
 er between women assigned to 
FNP (56%) and those assigned to usual care (56%) for 
those with a calibrated smoking score (adjusted OR 0·90, 
97·5% CI 0·64–1·28; table 2). This fi
 nding was robust to 
sensitivity analyses, which included only women with 
complete self-report data and recorded cotinine 
concentrations at both baseline and follow-up (n=870; 
appendix). Reported number of cigarettes smoked 
per day at late pregnancy did not diff
 er between groups 
for women (n=610) classifi
 ed at baseline as smokers 
(adjusted diff
 erence in means 0·12 cigarettes, 97·5% CI 
–0·73 to 0·97; table 2). Mean birthweights of babies were 
3217·4 g (SD 618·0 g) for babies of women assigned to 
FNP and 3197·5 g (581·5 g) for those of women assigned 
to usual care, an adjusted diff
 erence of 20·75 g 
(97·5% CI –47·73 to 89·23). The proportion of women 
with a second pregnancy within 24 months of their fi
 rst 
child’s birth did not diff
 er between the FNP (66%) and 
usual care (66%) groups, with an adjusted OR of 1·01 
(97·5% CI 0·77–1·33; table 2). Sensitivity analyses for 
second pregnancy are in the appendix. Rates of 
emergency attendances or hospital admissions within 
24 months of birth included in the analysis were 81% for 
FNP and 77% usual care group (OR 1·32, 97·5% CI 
0·99–1·76). No diff
 erential eff
 ects due to maternal age, 
deprivation, participation in employment, education or 
training, or basic life skills were found for any primary 
outcome in planned subgroup analyses.
Some secondary outcomes suggested small positive 
impacts of the FNP (appendix). These were intention-
to-breastfeed, maternally reported child cognitive 
development 
(at 
24 
months 
only), 
language 
development using a modifi
 ed maternal-reported 
assessment (at 12 and 18 months) and using a 
standardised 
assessment 
(the 
Early 
Language 
Milestone; at 24 months), levels of social support, 
partner-relationship quality, and general self-effi
  cacy.

The mean number of visits of community midwives 
between baseline and 24 months post-partum were 
roughly the same between groups (10·40 [SD 5.34] for 
the FNP group [n=459] vs 10·68 [SD 5·25] for the usual 
care group [n=422]). Mean number of visits from health 
visitors were nearly double for those assigned to usual 
care (8·60 [13·74] for the FNP group [n=363] vs 16·25 
[12·15] for the usual care group [n=321]). The FNP group 
(n=709) received 39·28 (15·19) FNP nurse visits (the 
usual care group [n=10] received 0·45 [4·26] because of 
enrolment to the FNP group in error).
A full-sample base case analysis (782 in FNP group vs 
786 in usual care group) with use of multiple imputation 
showed an incremental cost for FNP of £1993 per 
participant. Although individual types of resource use 
were similar across trial groups, intervention delivery 
costs (FNP calls and visits) accounted for the substantial 
incremental cost of FNP. Sensitivity analysis that 
included complete cases only (217 in FNP group vs 186 in 
usual care group) suggested the incremental cost of the 
FNP was £4670 (95% CI 3322–6017).
The sample was similar to other populations of women 
off
 ered FNP in non-trial sites in England, and in trial sites 
after the closure of the trial (appendix). Attrition at key 
assessments (24 month interview, smoking) resulted in 
mostly small diff
 erences in women not included in 
analysis between groups (appendix). The delivery of FNP 
assessed against programme fi
 delity goals is described in 
the appendix. 
The proportion of participants with at least one serious 
adverse event (mainly clinical events associated with 
pregnancy and infancy period) was similar (310 [38%] of 
808 mother–child dyads in the usual care group vs 357 
[44%] of 810 participants in the FNP group) and no events 
were considered related to the intervention.
Discussion
In this randomised controlled, pragmatic trial, we show 
no evidence of benefi
 t from FNP for smoking cessation, 
birthweight, 
rates 
of 
second 
pregnancies, 
and 
emergency hospital visits for the child (table 2).

number. FNP was delivered mostly in-line with FNP 
fi
 delity goals and as it could be provided in usual local 
NHS settings. In the absence of evidence of benefi
 t, the 
programme cannot be considered cost eff
 ective for the 
primary outcomes of most relevance to FNP—ie, 
smoking cessation and second pregnancies.
Some short-term eff
 ects in the US trials were most 
evident in more vulnerable women (eg, with multiple risk 
factors or low psychological resources) at enrolment.18,21 In 
the Dutch VoorZorg trial22 a two-stage selection process 
included women with multiple risk factors. In England, 
young maternal age was chosen as an easily measurable 
proxy for low income and its associated long-term adverse 
child outcomes.27 This programme criterion might have 
resulted in greater heterogeneity and comparatively less 
disadvantage than in previous studies. Although the 
absence of any interactions suggests that broad FNP 
enrolment criteria did not mask intervention eff
 ects in 
subgroups defi
 ned by a-priori markers of vulnerability, 
diff
 erential eff
 ect by subgroup could be explored further—
we did not power this study to detect such eff
 ects.28
Unlike women in the US settings in which the 
intervention originated, teenage mothers in England can 
access many statutory supportive health and social services, 
including community based family doctors, midwives, and 
public-health nurses, and, in most trial sites, specialist 
teenage pregnancy midwives. Obstetric antenatal care, 
child surveillance, and access to emergency medicine were 
provided for usual care group participants in the US trials 
of NFP; however, in this UK-based trial, the extent of care 
provision accessible to the usual care group might have 
diluted any eff
 ect of FNP. Although our data do not quantify 
duration of health-care contact episodes, the overall rate of 
reported community midwifery contact was similar 
between groups. Women assigned to usual care saw health 
visitors eight more times than did those in the FNP group, 
but women assigned to FNP had had an average of 
39 specialist nurse visits, each lasting on average longer 
than 1 h. Therefore, it is not likely that an equivalent level of 
health care was provided to women in the usual care group 
and that can itself explain a reduction in level of intervention 
eff
 ect. Further exploration of diff
 erential health-care 
provision (either usual care or FNP care) to the most 
vulnerable woman in our sample (who have previously 
been found to derive particular benefi
 t most from FNP) 
could explain the relative absence of eff
 ects in our trial.

The intervention was originally developed by David Olds 
as the Nurse Family Partnership and adapted for use in 
England under licence by the Family Nurse Partnership 
National Unit, originally located within the Department 
of Health. The Department of Health commissioned the 
trial as the sole experimental and independent evaluation 
of the programme. The programme specifi
 cation is in 
part summarised by the programme’s core model 
elements and fi
 delity goals. Our assessment against these 
targets shows that the intervention has been delivered as 
intended, giving us confi
 dence in its validity.
Eff
 ective planning of subsequent pregnancies should 
enable parents to complete education, manage work, and 
provide more focused parental nurture and guidance for 
their children.29–31 We did not fi
 nd subsequent pregnancies 
to be more eff
 ectively planned in our study, reducing the 
potential to modify maltreatment and unintentional 
injury. The benefi
 ts of the intervention on maltreatment 
comes from the Elmira and Memphis studies,18,20 
evidenced through eff
 ect on injury and ingestions that 
resulted in emergency department visits, hospital 
admission, and length of hospital stay.32 Higher rates of 
safeguarding initiation for FNP-group children in our 
study might have resulted from surveillance bias, with 
higher levels of health-care contact and nurses adopting 
a lower threshold for intervention. Similarly, the higher 
presentation rates for emergency secondary care for 
children of mothers in the FNP group might refl
 ect lower 
maternal thresholds for accessing care infl
 uenced by the 
FNP. Admissions rates for injuries and ingestions might 
be a more direct assessment of maltreatment compared 
with overall presentation to emergency departments. 
However, there remained no evidence of a diff
 erence 
between groups when we focused on this outcome 
(appendix). Only longer-term follow-up can establish 
whether any preventive eff
 ect exists.
Rates for all-cause attendances and admissions rates of 
emergency department episodes were higher than we 
anticipated. Factors such as changes to out-of-hours 
services for family doctors and diffi
  culties in securing 
appointments might have contributed to such rates, 
although mothers reported frequent access overall to 
primary care for both themselves and for their child.
The Building Blocks trial was independent of 
programme delivery and adequately powered to detect 
intervention eff
 ects by the child’s second birthday. Routine 
data sources enabled high levels of ascertainment for 
three of the primary outcomes. Previous US trials of the 
intervention were single-centre studies (one semi-rural, 
two urban), involved a small number of nurses delivering 
the intervention (eg, ten in Denver, CO, USA), and led by 
the intervention developers. By contrast, our trial was led 
independently of the 131 family nurses working in locally 
managed teams delivering the intervention in 18 trial sites 
across England. Our trial therefore represents a more 
pragmatic evaluation of FNP compared with previous 
trials, which had a greater emphasis on effi
  cacy.
Due to the number of comparisons, conclusions must 
be drawn cautiously about secondary outcomes for which 
diff
 erences were shown, such as in language. Aside from 
safeguarding concerns, we show no evidence for 
diff
 erences between the two groups for maltreatment, 
prenatal health behaviour, and poor birth outcomes, all 
expected predictors of child neuro 
development by the 
FNP model.33 Similarly, language and cognitive delays 
should be reduced by sensitive and competent caregiving. 
We did fi
 nd small improvements in maternal self-
effi
  cacy, social support, and relationship quality, which 
would be consistent with mothers providing such care. 
We show no evidence of diff
 erences in maternal–child 
interaction or parental-role strain between groups, 
although these were the only assessments of parenting 
that we did. The observed development benefi
 ts were 
maternally reported and might be subject to reporting 
bias, but the relative importance of language development 
and the reduction in language delay that has been 
previously observed by age 2 years (in the Denver trial) 
would warrant further assessment in an older age group.
In commissioning the trial, the Department of Health 
Research Programme that funded this study specifi
 ed 
inclusion of prenatal tobacco use, childhood injuries 
requiring 
emergency 
department 
attendance 
or 
admission, and interbirth interval as primary outcome 
domains that were considered on the basis of previous 
trials to be modifi
 able by FNP. Other primary outcomes, 
including birthweight, were also recommended by the 
meeting of an advisory committee to the funders as part 
of the development of the commissioning brief and 
included input from the representatives of the 
programme. Therefore, we included birthweight as a 
policy-relevant and readily measurable outcome that was 
applicable to all trial participants. It is identifi
 ed as an 
outcome addressed by the programme (eg, on the current 
FNP website), although we would recognise that only the 
Elmira effi
  cacy study has shown diff
 erences for the 
subgroup of younger women (as summarised in the logic 
model). We selected all emergency episodes as a primary 
outcome because we were confi
 dent that it could be 
reliably ascertained (ie, episodes of care more likely to be 
recorded than not, whereas reason for visit less accurately 
recorded), although episodes for injuries and ingestions 
were included as key secondary outcomes. An episode 
rate for all attendances can include both addressable and 
non-addressable reasons, hence the importance of the 
outcomes that focus on injury and ingestions alone. 
Events specifi
 c to injuries and ingestions therefore 
represent outcomes of most relevance to FNP, and 
clearer markers of programme impact. Focusing on 
injury and ingestion episodes alone in primary care, 
attendance of accident and emergency department, and 
hospital admission still did not show any group 
diff
 erence. Although length of stay has also been taken as 
an indicator of maltreatment, diff
 erences might exist 
between health-care settings in the UK and the USA that

aff
 ects its interpretation. Length of stay is dependent not 
only on injury severity but also time and day of 
attendance, management required, and the availability of 
appropriate senior staff
  including anaesthetists to do 
relevant investigations. These considerations might 
distance length of stay from factors such as amounts of 
supervision, causative factors, or intent to injure. 
Although this was not recommended at commissioning, 
nor included as a trial outcome, it can be further explored 
in secondary analyses. Transparent reporting in this 
paper of all a-priori outcomes allows for further 
assessment of the relative benefi
 ts of the programme by 
policy makers and service commissioners.
 In conclusion, we show substantial additional cost, no 
benefi
 t for policy relevant main outcomes, and some 
advantage for a few secondary outcomes for mother and 
child when adding FNP to existing health service provision 
in England. Evidence for benefi
 t for child developm 
ent 
outcomes would mainly arise in children after the age of 
2 years, requiring longer-term follow-up for this outcome.
