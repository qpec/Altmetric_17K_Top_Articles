Introduction
In 2000, measles was a leading cause of vaccine-preventable 
child mortality, with an estimated global mortality burden 
of 535 000 deaths.1 Measles resulted in approximately 
110 000 deaths annually, according to 2017 estimates.2 
However, despite observed decreases in mortality in under-
5s,3 we have not seen any noticeable changes in case-
fatality ratio estimates for measles, which are used in the 
underlying assumptions for measles mortality models. 
These estimates might be expected to change as the 
characteristics of measles-susceptible populations evolve 
with immun 
isation coverage, as the age of infection 
increases, and as nutritional status improves.4,5 For 
example, greater vaccination coverage has been known to 
increase the age of infection; this can subsequently lower 
mortality, which previous analyses have addressed with 
age-specific case-fatality ratios for measles.5,6 Although 
several analyses have explored time trends in measles 
mortality estimates,1,2,7–9 many measles modelling efforts 
rely on a review6 of case-fatality ratios in low-income and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), published in 2009. The 
work reviewed age-specific case-fatality ratios for measles 
in community-based studies published between 1980 and 
2008, but did not include hospital-based studies or analyse 
time trends.
Comprehensively reviewing and updating our know-
ledge of case-fatality ratios for measles will better account 
for the past health improvements and economic benefits 
driven by measles vaccination and for the potential 
improvements in the future.10–12 As a case in point, 
an analysis11 published in 2016 has estimated that 
immunisations done during 2011–20 would return an 
economic benefit approximately 16 times greater than cost 
and, within these estimates, preventing measles would 
return an economic benefit approximately 58 times 
greater than the cost. The assessment of the measles 
mortality burden in such estimations,3,7 as well as 
the contribution of measles vaccination to mortality 
reductions, remains highly dependent on the estimates 
used for case-fatality ratios for measles, which can vary

Summary
Background In the 21st century, increases in immunisation coverage and decreases in under-5 mortality have sub-
stantially reduced the global burden of measles mortality. However, the assessment of measles mortality burden is 
highly dependent on estimates of case-fatality ratios for measles, which can vary according to geography, health systems 
infrastructure, prevalence of underlying risk factors, and measles endemicity. With imprecise case-fatality ratios, there 
is continued uncertainty about the burden of measles mortality and the effect of measles vaccination. In this study, we 
aimed to update the estimations of case-fatality ratios for measles, to develop a prediction model to estimate case-fatality 
ratios across heterogeneous groupings, and to project future case-fatality ratios for measles up to 2030.
Methods We did a review of the literature to identify studies examining measles cases and deaths in low-income and 
middle-income countries in all age groups from 1980 to 2016. We extracted data on case-fatality ratios for measles 
overall and by age, where possible. We developed and examined several types of generalised linear models and 
determined the best-fit model according to the Akaike information criterion. We then selected a best-fit model to 
estimate measles case-fatality ratios from 1990 to 2015 and projected future case-fatality ratios for measles up to 2030. 
Findings We selected 124 peer-reviewed journal articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2016, for inclusion 
in the final review—85 community-based studies and 39 hospital-based studies. We selected a log-linear prediction 
model, resulting in a mean case-fatality ratio of 2∙2% (95% CI 0∙7–4∙5) in 1990–2015. In community-based settings, 
the mean case-fatality ratio was 1∙5% (0∙5–3∙1) compared with 2∙9% (0∙9–6∙0) in hospital-based settings. The mean 
projected case-fatality ratio in 2016–2030 was 1∙3% (0∙4–3∙7).
Interpretation Case-fatality ratios for measles have seen substantial declines since the 1990s. Our study provides an 
updated estimation of case-fatality ratios that could help to refine assessment of the effect on mortality of measles 
control and elimination programmes.

according to geography, health systems infrastructure, 
prevalence of underlying risk factors, and measles 
endemicity. With imprecise case-fatality ratios, there is 
continued uncertainty about the burden of measles 
mortality and the effect of measles vaccination, including 
its cost-effectiveness and return on investment.13
In this Article, we build upon the previous review6 by re-
examining the literature published in 1980–2008, 
extending the scope of the search to add articles published 
in 2008–16, and including hospital-based studies in our 
analysis. We first did a literature review of case-fatality 
ratios for measles in both community-based and hospital-
based cases in LMICs from empirical data in the published 
literature from 1980–2016. We subsequently developed a 
prediction model to estimate case-fatality ratios across 
hetero 
geneous groupings (by country, income level, year, 
and age) from 1990–2015. Finally, we projected future case-
fatality ratios for measles up to 2030.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We identified studies to supplement the previous review 
by Wolfson and colleagues6 by searching PubMed for 
community-based and hospital-based studies with 
primary data on measles cases and deaths from Jan 1, 1980, 
to Dec 31, 2016, in LMICs, as classified by 2017 World 
Bank income level. Primary data were defined as directly 
collected data from outbreak investigations, cohort 
studies, analyses of routine surveillance, cross-sectional 
studies, and hospital-based studies. The search strategy 
used a combination of controlled vocabulary (MeSH) 
terms and free text terms. For community-based studies, 
we used the following key search terms: (measles[MeSH 
Terms] OR measles) AND (mortality[MeSH Terms] OR 
mortality OR “case fatality rate” OR “case fatality ratio”). 
For hospital-based studies, the key search terms were 
the following: (measles[MeSH Terms] OR measles) AND 
(mortality[MeSH Terms] OR mortality OR “case fatality 
rate” OR “case fatality ratio”) AND (hospitals[MeSH 
Terms] OR hospital). We excluded articles that were not 
human studies, were outside the specified data range, 
contained outcomes from a study already reported in 
another article, did not include primary data, contained 
an abstract in a language other than English, or were 
otherwise considered irrelevant because of the study 
design, setting, or absence of  information on measles 
cases and deaths. We also excluded articles that referred to 
measles outbreaks in camps of refugees or internally 
displaced people, per the methods described in Wolfson 
and colleagues.6 All studies identified in Wolfson and 
colleagues6 were included a priori and, therefore, removed 
as duplicates in the literature review. The full search 
strategy is described in the appendix.
Data extraction and preliminary analysis
We extracted data on case-fatality ratios for measles overall 
and by age, where possible. The data extracted included 
study year, first-level administrative region (eg, state) 
in countries with populations greater than 50 million 
people, age group (if listed), setting (urban or rural, if 
available), number of cases, number of deaths, labora-
tory confirmation of measles (yes or no), and timeframe 
following the rash onset for death to be considered 
attributable to measles, if applicable. A summary table 
of laboratory confirmation and timeframe following rash 
onset is provided in the appendix. The case-fatality ratios

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We systematically reviewed the literature in PubMed to identify 
both community-based and hospital-based studies examining 
measles cases and deaths, published between Jan 1, 1980, 
and Dec 31, 2016. We identified 124 studies from which we 
obtained case-fatality ratios for measles in low-income and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) in all age groups. These 
studies used different study designs across different types of 
settings and were not always nationally representative. Few 
studies included information about laboratory confirmation of 
measles and there were varying definitions of the timeline 
following rash onset for a death to be considered attributable 
to measles. Many measles modelling efforts rely on a previous 
review of case-fatality ratios for measles in LMICs published 
in 2009, which reviewed age-specific case-fatality ratios in 
community-based studies published between 1980 and 2008. 
In our study, we build upon this previous review by 
re-examining literature published in 1980–2008, extending its 
scope to add articles published in 2008–16, and including 
hospital-based studies in our analysis.
Added value of this study
From the data gathered in our literature review, we developed a 
prediction model to estimate case-fatality ratios for measles 
across heterogeneous groupings (by country, income level, 
year, and age). We found that estimated case-fatality ratios for 
1990–2015 would be about 2%, and projected case-fatality 
ratios would decline to about 1% by 2030. Overall, the 
estimated case-fatality ratios were highest in hospital settings 
and in children younger than 5 years, consistent with other 
analyses that reported a larger burden of measles mortality in 
this age group.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study and model can help to improve predictions of the 
effect and cost-effectiveness of measles control and elimination 
programmes and can elucidate some of the uncertainty 
surrounding this effect.

included all suspected measles cases as defined in each 
included article. A measles death was defined according to 
the article, if a timeline was not given, or as any death 
within 30 days of rash onset, if such data were extractable. 
Therefore, any potential effect of measles on longer-term 
mortality, including the effect of subacute sclerosing 
panencephalitis, was beyond the scope of this review.9,14
We extracted data from community-based and hospital-
based cases separately because we expected the hospital-
based case-fatality ratios to be higher, given that children 
are often hospitalised with measles because of increased 
severity and complications.6 We also extracted data by 
age, where possible, because the case-fatality ratios in 
children younger than 5 years were expected to be higher 
than those in individuals aged 5 years or older.7,15
Prediction model
First, we aggregated the following preliminary list of 
country-level covariates1,6,15 that were often associated with 
case-fatality ratios for measles in the literature: previous 
history of vaccination,6,15 estimated measles incidence, 
approximate attack rate for measles (estimated measles 
incidence divided by annual birth cohort),16 and prevalence 
of HIV.16 Additionally, the following covariates were 
hypothesised to be indirectly associated with case-fatality 
ratios for measles: gross national income per capita,16 
under-5 mortality,16 total fertility rate,16 percentage of 
population living in urban areas,16 population density (per 
km2 of land area),16 and educational attainment.17 Because 
we were unable to obtain individual history of vaccination 
from most studies, we used estimated coverage of the 
routine first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) 
as a proxy.18
We estimated the annual measles incidence for all 
countries by use of previously described methods1,19 applied 
to reported measles cases from 1980 to 2014.20 Briefly, the 
input data used were reported annual cases of measles (as 
collected with the WHO joint reporting form), national 
estimates of coverage with the first and second dose of 
MCV, coverage of national and subnational supplementary 
immunisation activities, and annual UN estimates of 
birth rates and population size from 1980 to 2014. The 
incidence of unreported cases was estimated by use of an 
extended Kalman filter.1,19 The Kalman filter, and its non-
linear extension called extended Kalman filter, is a general 
method for fitting partly observed time-series processes 
(eg, underreported disease incidence through time).19 This 
model was fitted independently to each country, resulting 
in country-specific estimates of the reporting rate and 
estimates of the unreported cases.
We obtained each covariate for the year of each study, 
with the midpoint year used for studies done across 
multiple years. We also included in the model the study 
year (as a continuous variable) and dummy indicators 
for community-based studies and case-fatality ratios in 
children younger than 5 years. The extracted case-fatality 
ratios for measles from the studies were age specific, 
where available. Therefore, the under-5 dummy indicator 
was used only for case-fatality ratios that were specific 
to children younger than 5 years. Likewise, this dummy 
indicator was not used for case-fatality ratios in 
individuals aged 5 years or older. For studies that did not 
provide age-specific case-fatality ratios, the dummy 
indicator was not applied. For studies that reported more 
than one case-fatality ratio—including one or more age-
specific ratios, ratios across one or more timeframes, and 
so on—the analysed data incorporated each individual 
case-fatality ratio observation.
Because several studies did not disaggregate by age, but 
were likely to represent a mixture of ages older or younger 
than 5 years, we ran the model without these studies and 
then ran two scenario analyses: one assuming that these 
studies’ case-fatality ratios were attributable to children 
younger than 5 years, and another assuming that they 
were attributable to individuals aged 5 years or older.
Afterwards, we examined several types of generalised 
linear models (ie, log-linear, Poisson, quasi-Poisson, and 
negative binomial) to fit the dataset of case-fatality ratios 
for measles in all LMICs across 1990–2015. Our model 
predicts case-fatality ratios from 1990 onwards because 
measles control efforts in this period are more relevant to 
current efforts than those during the 1980s, which were 
markedly different, with MCV1 coverage ramping up, 
no supplementary immunisation activities or routine 
second-dose coverage, and large measles outbreaks. We 
used an offset term (measles incidence) to account for 
over-dispersion in the Poisson model. Because of overlap 
and relevance of the preliminary list of covariates, we 
removed covariates with more than 10% of data missing 
and subsequently examined model fit with the remaining 
covariates.
Although not all doses of MCV are delivered through 
routine services, comprehensive data were not available 
to capture additional coverage from supplementary 
immunisation activities. Similarly, patient-level factors 
that are associated with measles mortality risk, such as 
vaccination, nutritional, and treatment status, were not 
comprehensively available for individual cases in most 
included studies. Therefore, these patient-level factors 
were not included in the prediction model.
Given the importance of a prediction model that pro-
duces results with limited data, we determined the best-fit 
model according to the Akaike information criterion. 
Because selected studies were of varying quality and size, 
the analysis weighted the model estimation by the number 
of measles cases from each study. The best-fit model was 
validated by a cross-validation method of training the 
model on 80% of the dataset and testing the predictive 
capacity of the model on the remaining 20% (appendix).
Projection of future case-fatality ratios

estimations with the covariates for which projected 
estimates were available up to 2030. These included 
covariates were the following: year, an indicator for 
community-based studies, an indicator for studies in 
children younger than 5 years, MCV1 coverage,18 under-5 
mortality,21 total fertility rate,21 percentage of population 
in urban areas,21 and population density.21 Population 
density was available with annual projections, whereas 
under-5 mortality, total fertility rate, and urban 
percentage were available only by 5-year increments.21 
We projected future MCV1 coverage on the basis of 2015 
WHO-UNICEF estimates of coverage,18 assuming a 1% 
coverage increase per year, in line with previous analyses 
of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.22 Future MCV1 coverage 
was capped at 95%, unless a country had a higher 
projected coverage as of 2015, in which case the coverage 
was capped at the maximum coverage reached. We also 
included a sensitivity analysis with MCV1 coverage 
capped at 90% and holding WHO’s estimated MCV1 
coverage for 2015 constant across the 2016–30 pro-
jection period.
To address model uncertainty in our estimations, we 
explored the distribution of predicted and projected 
case-fatality ratios when drawing simulated regression 
coefficients from a multivariate normal distribution 
(n=1000), with use of the model’s estimated coefficients 
and variance–covariance matrix. Equations of the fitted, 
prediction, and projection models, with accompanying 
definitions and sources, are presented in the appendix. 
We used R statistical software, version 3.5.1, for all 
analyses.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
We identified 2788 articles in our initial literature review 
(figure 1). After filtering for human studies across the 
relevant timeframe (studies published between Jan 1, 1980, 
and Dec 31, 2016) and excluding duplicates, 1592 of these 
articles were considered potentially relevant. The titles 
and abstracts of these remaining articles were further 
screened for inclusion in the review. Full texts were 
reviewed only if no clear exclusion criteria appeared in the 
abstract. Articles that discussed clinical trials, measles 
outbreaks in refugee camps or camps of internally 
displaced people, measles in developed countries (defined 
as high-income countries, with a gross national income 
per capita of US$12 476 or higher23), or otherwise did not 
include measles deaths and cases in LMICs were excluded. 
A total of 124 articles were selected for inclusion in 
the final review—85 community-based studies and 
39 hospital-based studies. A full list of the studies included 
is provided in the appendix. Three review articles were 
selected for community-based studies,24–26 but original 
sources were obtained where available (19 additional 
original sources obtained and four not available). Case-
fatality ratios in the original sources were prioritised 
over the data in the published reviews, where applicable. 
One study included both community-based and hospital-
based measles cases and was included in both datasets.27 
The community-based studies contained 158 observations 
across 35 countries (including 68 observations in children 
younger than 5 years, 41 in individuals aged 5 years or 
older, and 49 that were not disaggregated by age), whereas 
hospital-based studies contained 68 observations across 
23 countries (24 observations in under-5s, 12 in individuals 
aged 5 years or older, and 32 that were not disaggregated 
by age).
Of the 226 case-fatality ratio observations for measles, 
65 were done in low-income country settings and 
161 were done in middle-income country settings, as 
classified by 2017 World Bank income level. The 
unweighted median case-fatality ratio in community-
based studies was 3∙0% (mean 5∙4%). The median 
case-fatality ratio in hospital-based studies was 8∙0% 
(mean 10∙8%). A histogram of the case-fatality ratios 
reported for all age-groups in all studies is included in 
the appendix. The number of measles cases in all 
community-based and hospital-based studies analysed 
was 523 885. The number of measles cases by study 
varied considerably, with a median of 349 cases in 
community-based studies (range 8–124 865) and a 
median of 357 in hospital-based studies (range 29–7447).

observations by year of study (results by income level 
are included in the appendix).
The time period of the studies tended to be more recent 
in community-based studies than in hospital-based 
studies, but, overall, tended towards the beginning of the 
search period of our study, with a midpoint year mean of 
1991 (median 1989) among community-based studies and 
of 1989 (median 1986) among hospital-based studies. 
The majority of community-based studies were done in 
rural areas (59%), whereas nearly half of hospital-based 
studies were done in urban areas (48%), with only 
three studies done in rural areas and the remaining 
studies done in both urban and rural areas. For nine 
studies done at the national level, the urban or rural 
indicator was assigned according to the percentage of 
population in urban areas, resulting in two studies 
classified as urban and seven studies classified as rural.16 
A majority of community-based studies were done during 
measles outbreaks (67%), whereas a minority of hospital-
based studies took place during outbreaks (19%). The 
largest community-based studies took place in China, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Malawi (62% of 
all measles cases included in the community-based 
analysis)—all of which occurred in outbreak settings.
According to model selection and goodness of fit tests, 
we selected a log-linear model (table 1). The Poisson 
models had non-significant p values on tests for over-
dispersion, indicating that a quasi-Poisson model was 
not necessary. For the final model, we also eliminated 
covariates with more than 10% of data missing across the 
136 LMICs, but non-significant covariates were preserved 
as relevant to the prediction of case-fatality ratio. The 
model used to predict case-fatality ratios for measles 
during 1990–2015 relied on study year, MCV1 coverage, an 
indicator for community-based studies, an indicator for 
studies in children younger than 5 years, measles attack 
rate, under-5 mortality, population density, total fertility 
rate, and percentage of population in urban areas. The 
regression results are presented in the appendix. The log-
linear model selected posits that these covariates predict 
case-fatality ratios for measles by acting as proxies for how 
case-fatality ratios are likely to differ across time and 
geography. The model achieves this by assuming that 
case-fatality ratio estimates scale by study year, measles 
vaccine coverage, and country-level differences based on 
the distribution and health of the population (eg, under-5 
mortality, population density, and so on). The final model 
that we used to predict case-fatality ratios had R²=0∙74. 
A direct comparison of observed versus predicted case-
fatality ratio values is shown in the appendix.
The mean predicted case-fatality ratio for 1990–2015 
was 2∙2% (95% CI 0∙7–4∙5). In community-based case-
fatality ratios, the mean predicted ratio was 1∙5% 
(0∙5–3∙1), compared with 2∙9% (0∙9–6∙0) in hospital-
based ratios. In children younger than 5 years, the mean

predicted ratio was 3∙3% (1∙1–6∙4) across this period, 
compared with a mean predicted ratio of 0∙9% (0∙2–3∙4) 
in individuals aged 5 years or older. Table 2 shows the 
estimated case-fatality ratios for measles categorised by 
under-5 mortality and by setting. Figure 3 shows the 
mean predicted case-fatality ratio in all countries for 
1990–2015 (the predicted ratio unweighted by the number 
of measles cases from each literature review study and 
the population-averaged predicted ratio are included in 
the appendix). Although the predicted case-fatality ratios 
included outliers, only 0∙3% of the estimated values 
were greater than the maximum case-fatality ratio found 
in the literature reviewed. When comparing children by 
age group, predicted case-fatality ratios were highest in 
under-5s, but our analysis resulted in lower mean 
predicted case-fatality ratios in under-5s in 1990–2015 
compared with those in the original data in 1980–2016 
(appendix). The estimated case-fatality ratios by World 
Bank income level were, as expected, highest in low-
income countries and decreased as gross national 
income per capita increased (figure 4). Likewise, the 
predicted case-fatality ratios decreased as under-5 
mortality decreased (figure 4).
In the first scenario analysis, we assumed that the 
81 case-fatality ratios from studies that were not disag-
gregated by age were attributable to children younger 
than 5 years: this resulted in a mean predicted ratio for 
1990–2015 of 1∙8% (95% CI 0∙6–3∙8). In the second 
scenario analysis, we assumed that the 81 case-fatality 
ratios from studies that were not disaggregated by age 
were attributable to children aged 5 years or older: this 
resulted in a mean ratio of 2∙5% (1∙0–4∙4).
Because not all prediction model covariates had 
projected estimates available in 2016–30 (ie, attack rate), 
we relied on a projection model with adjusted covariates.

A comparison between the goodness of fit statistics of 
the prediction model and the projection model is 
presented in the appendix. With only one less parameter 
(attack rate) than the prediction model, the projection 
model showed better fit (–323) compared with most 
examined models, but worse fit compared with 
the prediction model (–337), according to the Akaike 
information criterion.
The mean projected case-fatality ratio for 2016–30 was 
1∙3% (95% CI 0∙4–3∙7). In community-based case-
fatality ratios, the mean projected ratio was 0∙8% 
(0∙3–2∙2), compared with 1∙8% (0∙6–5∙4) in hospital-
based case-fatality ratios. In children younger than 
5 years, the mean projected ratio was 1∙9% (0∙7–5∙2), 
compared with a mean projected ratio of 0∙6% (0∙1–2∙5) 
in individuals aged 5 years or older.
When examining projected case-fatality ratios for 
2016–30 in the sensitivity analysis capping MCV1 
coverage at 90%, rather than 95%, we found that the 
mean projected case-fatality ratio overall remained at 
1∙3% (95% CI 0∙4–3∙6), whereas the mean projected 
ratio in children younger than 5 years increased slightly 
to 2∙0% (0∙7–5∙3) compared with a projection capping 
MCV1 coverage at 95%. In the sensitivity analysis holding 
MCV1 at constant 2015 coverage levels, we also found that 
the mean projected case-fatality ratio overall remained the 
same compared with capping coverage at 95%. Figure 5 
shows the mean projected case-fatality ratio in 2016–30 
(projected case-fatality ratios by under-5 mortality are 
included in the appendix).
Discussion
In our study, we did a literature review of case-fatality 
ratios for both community-based and hospital-based 
measles cases from the published literature in LMICs to 
develop a prediction model to estimate case-fatality ratios 
for measles. We found that estimated case-fatality ratios 
for 1990–2015 would be about 2%, and projected case-
fatality ratios would decline to about 1% by 2030. Overall, 
the estimated case-fatality ratios were highest in hospital 
settings and in children younger than 5 years, consistent 
with other analyses that reported a larger burden of 
measles mortality in this age group.15 
Our analysis attempted to address the uncertainty 
surrounding case-fatality ratios for measles and to better 
estimate the burden of measles mortality. Our case-fatality 
ratio estimates are a stepping stone towards improving 
mortality estimations, particularly for the WHO burden 
of disease assessments, including their tracking pro-
gress toward measles control, elimination, and mortality 
reduction. In concertation with academics and technical

experts, our work could enable us to provide case-fatality 
ratio estimates as inputs into the modelling projections of 
WHO.1,20
Our study found lower mean case-fatality ratios in 
community-based studies compared with those found in 
the previous descriptive analysis done by Wolfson and 
colleagues,6 both in the articles we reviewed and in our 
estimations. Our study reviewed articles published from 
1980 to 2016, whereas Wolfson and colleagues6 relied 
on articles published from 1980 to 2008. Our review 
identified six additional articles between 1980 and 2008 
that were not captured by Wolfson and colleagues,6 as 
well as 26 articles between 2008 and 2016. Additionally, 
our analysis examined both community-based and 
hospital-based studies, whereas the previous work 
included only community-based studies (appendix). Our 
analysis also went beyond the previous descriptive 
analysis by developing a model to provide estimations of 
case-fatality ratios.
Previous models of measles burden and vaccine 
impact, including dynamic transmission models, have 
attempted to estimate the burden of measles mortality 
globally. Although some models directly relied on verbal 
autopsy data,28 many models estimated measles burden 
by applying age-specific and country-specific case-fatality 
ratios to the values estimated in the associated model.1,2,29 
In this respect, our analysis addressed these underlying 
limitations by focusing on the case-fatality ratio inputs 
and providing selected disaggregations of case-fatality 
ratio estimates (including variation by time and setting).
Nevertheless, our analysis has several limitations. First, 
we assumed that case-fatality ratio data from each 
published study were nationally representative. We also 
assumed that all studies that included measles cases and 
deaths in individuals aged 5 years or older could be 
grouped and analysed together, although the age ranges 
were not consistently or transparently defined in each 
study. However, because of the small number of studies, 
we chose to include more data in our analysis rather than 
to reduce our dataset further. We also included some 
analyses of routine surveillance data (12% of all selected 
study observations) that directly reported on primary data 
collection. However, because routine surveillance might 
not capture all outcomes associated with cases, including 
deaths, our case-fatality ratio estimates for measles might 
be biased. Moreover, these studies used different study 
designs across different types of settings, and the 
exclusion of four studies in refugees and displaced 
populations might have biased the estimates towards 
lower case-fatality ratios, because these are typically high-
risk populations. The inclusion of uncertainty and 
scenario analyses aimed to address these limitations by 
estimating uncertainty intervals. However, additional 
uncertainty due to limitations and quality in the original 
data might have remained. Additionally, although 
43 countries were represented in the original dataset, 
five countries (Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, India, Nigeria, and 
Senegal) represented 46% of all 226 observations. When 
considering the number of cases used in weighting 
the final model, three countries (China, Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, and Malawi) represented 62% of 
all cases. However, most of these cases have been included 
in studies since 2000. Additionally, when running the 
model without these countries’ observations, the mean 
estimated case-fatality ratio in 1990–2015 increased from 
2∙2% to 2∙5%. Overall, the majority of the observations 
included were also based on data from the 1970s and 
1980s, with approximately 55% of the observations having 
a midpoint study year earlier than 1990. Moreover, 
the studies since 2000, which represent 23% of the 
observations in this study, did not show as clear a declining 
trend as seen in earlier years. However, case-fatality ratios 
higher than 10% during this period represent less than 
3% of cases in our study, and when these outliers were 
removed, the declining trend was more pronounced.
A second limitation of our study was the existence of 
several factors that could not be addressed in our model-
ling approach because of data constraints, including a 
previous history of vaccination at the individual level, a 
subgroup analysis for individuals with HIV infection, the 
effect of malnutrition, and the effect of improved measles 
case management. However, we used estimated coverage 
of MCV1 as a proxy for individual vaccination status, 
which might not capture the heterogeneity at the 
individual level. Because of the number of countries with 
high prevalence of HIV included among LMICs, the 
increased mortality from measles among individuals with 
HIV infection is a relevant, but unaddressed factor in 
our analysis.30 Malnutrition also contributes to measles 
mortality, and improvements in vitamin A deficiencies 
and nutrition over time might also support the declining 
case-fatality ratio trend for measles.31 Additionally, measles 
case management has improved since 1980, and is 
probably a further contributing factor to subsequent 
improvements in measles mortality.32–34
A third limitation was the varying quality in the articles 
included. Few studies included information about labora-
tory confirmation of measles, and there were varying 
definitions of the timeline following rash onset for a 
death to be considered attributable to measles (appendix). 
Approximately 50% of the community-based studies 
included in the analysis defined the timeline as 1 month 
following rash onset (ie, 1 month, 4 weeks, 28 days, 30 days, 
or 31 days). However, hospital-based studies typically had 
a follow-up on a much shorter timeline and, therefore, 
might have missed deaths according to this definition. 
For both community-based and hospital-based studies, 
the period of measurement of death, as well as the 
completeness of ascertainment of deaths, was not 
standardised and often not known. We assumed that the 
suspected measles cases and deaths as defined in each 
article were sufficient to estimate the case-fatality ratio for 
measles, which might have introduced bias if either the 
number of suspected cases was greater than the true

e480
number of measles cases or if the deaths attributable to 
measles were greater than the timeline by which data were 
defined and collected. Although our analysis weighted 
case-fatality ratios in studies by the number of cases, we 
also could have used a grading scheme that incorporated 
some sense of the quality of each study. To address the 
specific issues related to quality in the context of each 
study, we would need to develop some kind of weighting 
based on criteria such as laboratory confirmation, loss to 
follow-up, and time following rash onset for death to be 
attributable to measles not defined. However, given the 
scarcity of detailed information in each study, this approach 
was impractical and we chose to rely on the number of 
measles cases alone.
A fourth limitation was that the models presented 
here do not represent a causal relationship between the 
covariates of interest and the outcome. Additional factors 
that are important considerations for mortality risk—
such as vaccination, nutritional, and treatment status of 
the individual cases—were not included because of 
absence of patient-level data in the study reports. Our 
study also needs compre 
hensive information on supple-
mentary immunisation activities. Because of this need, 
measles immunisation coverage in this study reflected 
only routine immunisation coverage and not the 
supplemental coverage of the country at the time of data 
collection for each included article. We also optimistically 
projected MCV1 coverage by capping it at 95% (although 
50 LMICs had achieved 95% or higher MCV1 coverage as 
of 2015, according to WHO estimates18), so as to not 
arbitrarily limit coverage estimates by 2030 and to reflect 
the higher expected coverage due to supplementary 
immunisation activities. Additionally, for both prediction 
and projection models, we assumed that the relationship 
between the analysed covariates and case-fatality ratios 
for measles have the same functional form over time. 
Although we did incorporate more than one observation 
per study for some studies that included age-specific case-
fatality ratios in both under-5s and individuals aged 
5 years or older, this was done only for a minority of the 
studies (approximately 30%). Finally, because the attack 
rate covariate was excluded from the projection model 
and the relationship between attack rate and case-fatality 
ratio for measles is positive, we might expect that the 
potential infor 
mation loss in the projection model 
could result in underestimation of case-fatality ratios for 
measles.
Nonetheless, our analysis enabled us to draw several 
conclusions. First, as expected, hospital-based measles 
cases, which are likely to be more severe, were associated 
with higher case-fatality ratios compared with those of 
community-based measles cases. Second, the highest 
case-fatality ratios were found in under-5s, the most 
susceptible group and with the highest measles mortality. 
Third, as under-5 mortality—a population-level pre-
dictor of case-fatality ratio—decreases, case-fatality ratio 
logically decreases.
International organisations such as WHO, UNICEF, 
the Measles & Rubella Initiative, and Gavi provide 
support and subsidies for measles immunisation. 
However, despite this widespread support, many 
countries have still not achieved the WHO target of 
95% reduction in measles mortality between 2000 and 
2015.35 Our data serve to help improve predictions of the 
effect of measles control and elimination programmes 
and can serve to elucidate some of the uncertainty 
surrounding this effect.
