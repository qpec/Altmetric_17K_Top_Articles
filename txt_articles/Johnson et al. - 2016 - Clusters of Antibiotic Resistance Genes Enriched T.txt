ABSTRACT
Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide health risk, but the influence of animal agriculture on the genetic context and
enrichment of individual antibiotic resistance alleles remains unclear. Using quantitative PCR followed by amplicon sequencing,
we quantified and sequenced 44 genes related to antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and bacterial phylogeny in mi-
crobiomes from U.S. laboratory swine and from swine farms from three Chinese regions. We identified highly abundant resis-
tance clusters: groups of resistance and mobile genetic element alleles that cooccur. For example, the abundance of genes confer-
ring resistance to six classes of antibiotics together with class 1 integrase and the abundance of IS6100-type transposons in three
Chinese regions are directly correlated. These resistance cluster genes likely colocalize in microbial genomes in the farms. Resis-
tance cluster alleles were dramatically enriched (up to 1 to 10% as abundant as 16S rRNA) and indicate that multidrug-resistant
bacteria are likely the norm rather than an exception in these communities. This enrichment largely occurred independently of
phylogenetic composition; thus, resistance clusters are likely present in many bacterial taxa. Furthermore, resistance clusters
contain resistance genes that confer resistance to antibiotics independently of their particular use on the farms. Selection for
these clusters is likely due to the use of only a subset of the broad range of chemicals to which the clusters confer resistance. The
scale of animal agriculture and its wastes, the enrichment and horizontal gene transfer potential of the clusters, and the vicinity
of large human populations suggest that managing this resistance reservoir is important for minimizing human risk.
IMPORTANCE
Agricultural antibiotic use results in clusters of cooccurring resistance genes that together confer resistance to
multiple antibiotics. The use of a single antibiotic could select for an entire suite of resistance genes if they are genetically linked.
No links to bacterial membership were observed for these clusters of resistance genes. These findings urge deeper understanding
of colocalization of resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in resistance islands and their distribution throughout
antibiotic-exposed microbiomes. As governments seek to combat the rise in antibiotic resistance, a balance is sought between
ensuring proper animal health and welfare and preserving medically important antibiotics for therapeutic use. Metagenomic
and genomic monitoring will be critical to determine if resistance genes can be reduced in animal microbiomes, or if these gene
clusters will continue to be coselected by antibiotics not deemed medically important for human health but used for growth pro-
motion or by medically important antibiotics used therapeutically.

A
ntibiotic resistance is recognized as a worldwide health threat
(1–5), especially from Gram-negative pathogens (6). Antibi-
otic resistance is an ancient trait (7) that has coevolved with nat-
ural antibiotic production (8) to result in widespread resistance in
nature (9, 10). Humanity’s use of thousands of tons of antibiotics
annually (11) has provided a selective advantage for resistant bac-
teria to flourish in the clinic (2, 12) and the environment (13).
Subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations are sufficient to enrich
for resistant bacteria (14), and mixtures of subinhibitory doses of
antibiotics, such as are common in agriculture, select for the high-
est level of resistance (15). The fight against infectious disease is
approaching a crisis situation (16), especially considering that
while antibiotic use (12) and resistance increase, the process of
antibiotic discovery has nearly halted (6).
Governments are increasingly regulating the use of antibiotics
in agriculture. The European Union (17), led by Denmark, has
banned the use of antibiotics as growth promoters (18). In the
United States, the use of antibiotics important for human medi-
cine will cease for animal growth promotion after 2016, and vet-
erinary oversight will be required for therapeutic uses (5). Obser-
vations that agricultural antibiotics increase the abundance of
resistance genes in manure (19, 20) and manure-amended soil

 (21, 22) and potentially in the general public (23) provide a clear
scientific basis for the regulation of agricultural uses of antibiotics.
Compliance with new regulations will likely require alternative
management practices (24) to overcome the losses of antibiotic
growth-promoting and disease-controlling benefits (25, 26) and
to maintain agricultural productivity (18).
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can uncouple gene content
and phylogeny (27) and allows for rapid (28) acquisition of resis-
tance or multidrug resistance (29), in some cases from environ-
mental to pathogenic bacteria (30, 31). Genetic elements mobiliz-
ing genes within a cell (integrons and transposons) and between
cells (plasmids and phage) are known to be enriched in agriculture
due to the use of antibiotics (19, 32–35). We will refer to both
types of elements as mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Insertion
sequences confer a DNA cut-and-paste functionality at inverted
repeat sequences (36). Integrons allow for the recruitment, ge-
netic integration, and promotion of exogenous genes as integron
cassettes (34). Class 1 integrons in clinical strains are thought to
have all arisen from a single source due to widespread occurrence
of identical intI1 sequences (34, 37). Both of these within-cell mo-
bile genetic elements can lead to the evolution of multidrug resis-
tance plasmids (28, 38), which can be transferred horizontally by
conjugation (27).
In this study, we identify high correlations in the cooccurrence
of clusters of identical antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mo-
bile genetic element sequences in Chinese swine farms and farm-
impacted soils as well as U.S. laboratory swine. Despite consis-
tency of detection and abundance of ARGs across sample types,
the phylogenetic membership of these communities is distinct
between farms and sample types. These results provide a strong
impetus to further study the effects that swine agriculture has in
possibly developing multidrug resistance islands and plasmids
and their dispersal throughout these communities. This is the first
study to perform high-throughput quantitative PCR (qPCR) fol-
lowed by sequencing of all amplicon products to describe the ef-
fects of antibiotic use in animal agriculture.
RESULTS
Samples and DNA extraction. We continued the investigation of
two classes of swine manure samples that were collected and have
been described and studied previously by our laboratories (19,
20). Briefly, we sampled individual swine feces from the USDA
National Animal Disease Center (NADC), Ames, IA, from swine
living in highly controlled environments, sampled immediately
preceding (0 days) and 14 days following continued antibiotic-
free feeding (not medicated [NM], n � 3) or introduction to in-
feed antibiotics (medicated [M], n � 3), which contained a mix-
ture
of
chlortetracycline,
sulfamethazine,
and
penicillin
(ASP250). These sample names were abbreviated with the treat-
ment group (NM or M) and the day sampled (0D or 14D). The
other class of samples comes from industrial-size swine farms in
north (Beijing [B]), central (Jiaxing [J]), and southern (Putian
[P]) China as well as a pristine Chinese soil (CS). At each of these
farms, the manure piles (M), composted manure (C), and soil
amended with composted manure (S) were each sampled in trip-
licate. Samples were given a two-letter abbreviation: the first is the
city (B, J, or P) and the second is the sample type (M, C, or S). In
addition, we obtained feral pig feces (n � 4) as a reference sample
(39) for antibiotic-free swine without contact with modern agri-
cultural systems. These were abbreviated F (feral) with a pig iden-
tification (ID) number.
Cooccurrence of ARG and MGE sequences. Among the Chi-
nese farm sites, despite their distant geographic locations or sam-
ple types, the abundance and occurrence of the most abundant
allele of multiple genes were significantly correlated. For example,
the abundance of the most prevalent allele of intI1 compared with
that of qacE�1 and IS6100 resulted in r2 values of 0.92 and 0.87,
respectively. When we perform Spearman correlations with all the
complete pairs of genes from the Chinese farms, we observe ex-
tensive clusters of statistically significant abundance-correlated al-
leles (Fig. 1A). In general, there are two major clusters of genes
that cooccur in the Chinese farms, with little cross-correlation
between the two clusters. The first cluster is composed of intI1,
qacE�1, IS6100, aminoglycoside phosphotransferases and nucle-
otidyltransferases, tetracycline efflux, sul2, dfrA1, cmlA1, and in-
compatibility group IncW plasmids. We designate this group of
genes the intI1-IS6100 cluster (Fig. 1A, left cluster). The average
correlation coefficient (�) within the cluster of significant cooc-
currences is 0.86, showing very high between-gene correlations.
Tetracycline ribosomal protection protein resistance genes and
two transposase alleles (IS614 and IS1216) dominate a second
abundance-correlation cluster. We designate this group of genes
the IS1216-tet cluster (Fig. 1A, right cluster). Also included in this
cluster is mefA (macrolide efflux pump) and aphA3, an aminogly-
coside phosphotransferase gene. Throughout the manure man-
agement process, i.e., from fresh manure to composted manure to
soils receiving composted manure, the IS1216-tet cluster steadily
declines, while the abundance of the intI1-IS6100 cluster is much
more dynamic between sample types (Fig. 1C and D; see also
Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The sequences from the
IS1216-tet cluster are most commonly associated with Gram-
positive bacteria, while the intI1-IS6100 alleles are associated with
Gram-negative bacteria as determined using the Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) with the nr database from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
The NADC research animals exhibited a different set of cooc-
curring ARGs and MGEs than the Chinese pigs: the blaTEM-sul2
cluster (Fig. 1B). The gene cooccurring with the greatest number
of other genes within the cluster was blaTEM, and it was shown to
cooccur with nearly every other gene of the cluster, including ami-
noglycoside phosphorylases (strA and strB), nucleotidyltrans-
ferases (aadA), sulfonamide resistance (sul2), and multiple mobile
genetic elements (intI2, IS6100, IS4, and incN plasmids). The av-
erage � within the blaTEM cluster was 0.79. Tetracycline resistance
(tetO and tetW) clustered separately. Figure 1A and B show only
the most abundant allele of each gene. We also observed high
intragene cooccurrence (cooccurrence between alleles of the same
gene), especially within the Chinese samples (see Fig. 4A and B),
when more alleles were included in the analysis.
Enrichment of ARG and MGE allele sequences. Individual re-
sistance gene alleles (sequences) were enriched with a relative
change in the adjusted cycle threshold (��ACT) up to 15, which is
equivalent to about 32,000-fold enrichment compared to the pris-
tine soil. The level of enrichment of the resistance cluster gene
alleles is unified across sample types and farms (see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material). Interestingly, in the Beijing farm, enrich-
ment in manure is highest, followed by compost and soil, while in
the Putian farm, some gene alleles follow this same trend (blue
background in the figure), while for others (green background)

 enrichment in the manure is lowest and compost is the highest
(see Fig. S1). These genes make up a large portion of the commu-
nity; for example, the most abundant intI1 allele was 5.7% as
abundant as 16S rRNA in the BM, PC, and JC samples and 0.16%
as abundant in the soil across all the farms but 0.93% as abundant
in the PS sample. The aphA3 allele was the most abundant gene, up
to 34% as abundant as 16S rRNA. This allele-specific analysis
aided in the detection of enrichment of the most abundant blaTEM
allele. When only the results of qPCR are used, it appears that the
abundance of blaTEM is decreased (see Fig. S2). However, this is
due to the presence of a different blaTEM allele in the control soil,
and a different allele was enriched in both the NADC animals and
the Chinese farms.
ARG-MGE clusters in sequenced genomes. We searched
known sequenced genomes to ascertain if there was a precedent
for resistance cluster alleles that we observed (Fig. 1) to cooccur in
individual microbial genomes, and if the genes colocalize into
resistance islands. We found supporting evidence for both cases.
Genes from the intI1-IS6100 gene cluster were found to colocalize
most often in plasmids or resistance islands from Gram-negative
organisms at 100% identity to the most abundant alleles that we
obtained (Table 1). Acinetobacter baumannii strain AYE contains
an extensive 86-kb resistance island, likely obtained through hor-
izontal gene transfer (40). Amplicons from our study map with
100% identity along the entire amplicon length for 18 of the genes
in this resistance island. Acinetobacter was found to correlate with
FIG 1 Cooccurrence network with primer names as node labels of the ��ACT values of the most abundant allele of each antibiotic resistance gene and mobile
genetic element together with genus-level classification of 16S rRNA sequences within all Chinese farm samples (n � 25; JS1 and JS2 were excluded) (A) and all
NADC pigs (n � 12) (B). Nodes connected by a line have a statistically significant Spearman correlation and are cooccurring. Various requirements were required
to call two alleles cooccurring: codetection in at least half the samples (for cooccurrence to a genus, this requirement was relaxed to n � 4), false-discovery
correction q value of �0.05, and � of �0.75. Node size is dependent on the number of connections to other nodes (degree). Shaded circles were added post hoc
to clusters of alleles that have high degrees of abundance among all members of that cluster and limited abundance outside the cluster. (C to E) Representative
correlations from the intI1-IS6100, IS1216-tet, and blaTEM-sul2 resistance clusters, respectively. The intI1-IS6100 cluster is enriched and diluted differently in all
farms, while the IS1216-tet cluster steadily declines from manure to soil in all farms. Note that the ��ACT detection limit for ARGs was �15. Axis labels are
followed by _1 to indicate that they are the most abundant allele of the amplicons obtained.

 the abundance of the intI1-IS6100 resistance cluster in manure
(Fig. 2C). The colocalization of intI1 and IS6100, together with
resistance genes from our survey, was identified in multiple Esch-
erichia coli plasmids as well as a Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid (see
Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) that also encodes the
BlaNDM-1 protein in another of its plasmids. These strains also
carry up to 11 additional genes from the intI1-IS6100 cluster map-
ping at least 50 kb away from the identified intI1 and IS6100 genes.
Genes from the IS1216-tet cluster were not observed together
in known genomes as frequently as those of the intI1-IS6100 clus-
ter. Only pairs of these genes were frequently observed in Gram-
positive organisms. In one instance, colocalization of four of the
genes (mefA, aphA3, tetQ, and IS614) was observed in a trans-
poson of Bacteroides fragilis (accession number KJ816753), a

 Gram-negative organism, but these genes all came from a region
of the transposon which was horizontally transferred, likely from
Gram-positive organisms (41).
Community analysis using V4 16S rRNA gene amplicons.
Bacterial communities from all the samples clustered by sample
type but with a moderate level of heterogeneity between replicates
(Fig. 3A). The NM (a composite of NM0D, M0D, and NM14D),
manure, compost, and soil sample cluster centers were statistically
distinct based on an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
Bonferroni-corrected P value of �0.01 for all comparisons be-
tween these samples. The stress calculated in this ordination was
0.24, which indicates only a fair representation of the data based
on the two axes. The feral samples did not cluster distinctly from
any of the other sample types.
All manure samples, independent of their treatment, were
dominated by the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla, and soil
samples were dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria
(Fig. 3B). The Access Array platform required primer annealing at
60°C for all reactions. This annealing temperature limited ampli-
fication of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum (see Text S1 in the
supplemental material), which was expected to be a major phylum
in manure samples.
While there are taxonomic differences between individual
samples across sample types, noise within sample types resulted in
only the few following statistical differences (q value, �0.05). Soil
samples were enriched in Acidobacteria and decreased in Firmic-
utes compared with the NM, manure, and compost samples. The
NM samples were enriched in Spirochaetes (Fig. 3B) compared
with the Chinese samples. At the genus classification level, there is
even greater variation within and between sample types, but some
statistically significant shifts were observed. Within Gammapro-
teobacteria (Fig. 3C), Succinivibrio was enriched in the NM com-
pared to the Chinese samples. While there were elevated levels of
Acinetobacter in manure and compost compared to NM, this re-
lationship was not statistically significant (P value, �0.05; q value,
�0.5). Within Bacilli (Fig. 3D), compared to all other samples,
Lactobacillus and Aerococcus were enriched in manure, while Gra-
cilibacillus and unclassified Bacillaceae 2 were enriched in com-
post. Streptococcus enrichment in manure was nearly significant
compared to compost (q value, 0.07). Within Clostridia, unclassi-
fied Ruminococcaceae and unclassified Lachnospiraceae were en-
riched in manure and NM compared with compost and soil, while
Clostridium sensu stricto and unclassified Clostridiales were en-
riched in manure compared to soil.
ARG-MGE cluster cooccurrence with phylogenetic groups.
We sought to determine if the abundance of resistance genes cor-
related with abundance of specific phylogenetic groups. Lactoba-
cillus cooccurred with the Chinese IS1216-tet cluster (average � �
0.78) within the Chinese samples (Fig. 2A). Comparatively, the
ARG-ARG correlation coefficient cluster average (� � 0.90) was
significantly higher than that for Lactobacillus (P value, 1.0 �
10�8). There are only three cooccurrence relationships between
genera and the intI1-IS6100 cluster (average � � 0.76) (Fig. 1A). A
housekeeping gene (gapA) allele was identified as E. coli, which
cooccurs with three genes of the IS1216-tet cluster, but this allele is
fully integrated with the blaTEM-sul2 cluster. Another housekeep-
ing gene, mdh, also cooccurs with the blaTEM-sul2 cluster, but this
allele does not have 100% identity or match well with any distinct
taxonomic group.
We explored possible relationships by considering only a single
farm or a single sample type at a time. When considered alone, the
Beijing farm intI1-IS6100 and IS1216-tet Beijing clusters are co-
correlated. Further, Clostridium sensu stricto and unclassified
Clostridiales are well correlated with this Beijing cluster. Within
manure, Acinetobacter and unclassified Clostridiales are associated
with the intI1-IS6100 cluster (Fig. 2C). Within Jiaxing, Putian,
compost, or soil samples, each considered individually, there were
only a combined eight cooccurrence relationships (edges) be-
tween any genera and the most abundant ARG or MGE alleles,
indicating nearly no ARG-taxonomic cooccurrence.
ARG diversity. On average, the top 40 functional gene alleles
account for 91% of all sequences of each sample of the genes (see
Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). For many of the genes,
especially within the intI1-IS6100 cluster, a single sequence repre-
sented more than 90% of all the sequences obtained (Fig. 4). In
silico PCR of the reference sequences also commonly showed
dominance of a single sequence, which indicated a conserved am-
plicon region. The Shannon diversity of all alleles of functional
genes was low, often ~1 (Fig. 4C). However, the diversity of some
genes (e.g., tetG, intI2, and mefA) was much higher. Despite the
FIG 2 Correlations between the ��ACT values of the most abundant ARG alleles and representative cooccurring phylogenetic groups. (A) Lactobacillus
cooccurs with six of the eight genes in the IS1216-tet cluster (Fig. 1); however, Lactobacillus was present in all nine manure samples but was detected in only one
of the 16 soil and compost samples. (B) Unclassified Xanthomonadaceae sequences cooccurred with two genes (Fig. 1) within the intI1-IS6100 cluster and were
detected in 10 of 25 samples. (C) Acinetobacter was detected in 5 manure samples and showed high cooccurrence with the intI1-IS6100 cluster but only within
manure samples. Note that the ��ACT detection limit for taxa was 7.8 and that the one for ARGs was �15. Gene names in the axis label are followed by _1 to
indicate that they are the most abundant allele.

ysis was performed with the top five alleles of every gene, if all five

(noted on the bars in Fig. 4A and B).
DISCUSSION
Clusters of highly abundant cooccurring resistance genes and mo-
bile genetic elements of identical sequence were found in swine
farms across China and another resistance cluster in laboratory
swine at the U.S. National Animal Disease Center. Cooccurrence
resistance clusters could be the result of a number of actual sce-
narios, including simultaneous enrichment of numerous strains
with single or few resistance genes from the clusters, and/or en-
richment of strains with multiple resistance genes scattered or
clustered within their genome. While our results are congruent
with the selection for multidrug-resistant bacteria in animal agri-
culture, our experimental design did not test this hypothesis di-
rectly. Several lines of evidence from this study highlight a need to
understand the phylogenetic and genomic context of resistance
genes and mobile genetic elements in animal agriculture environ-
ments. (i) The abundance of resistance genes and mobile genetic
elements with no sequence divergence are tightly correlated across
many sample types in and between swine farms. (ii) The resistance
genes cooccur with integrases and insertion sequences which are
known for the assembly of resistance islands (28, 38). (iii) Identi-
cal sequences in our resistance clusters are found in known resis-
tance islands (40) and multidrug-resistant plasmids (42), and
most of the intI1-IS6100 cluster genes (including aadA, aadA2,
cmlA1, qacE�1, aadA5, dfrA1, aadA9, sul2, and dfrA2) have been
observed previously as integron cassettes (43, 44). The cooccur-
rence of intI1, qacE�1, and aadA is not unexpected, as these are the
canonical integron cassettes (37), together with sul1 (which was
not included in our set of primers). Colocalization of intI1 with
IS6100 has been previously identified in multidrug-resistant plas-
mids in the soil bacterium Corynebacterium (42), enterobacterial
plasmids (45), Aeromonas from a Spanish river (46), Acinetobacter
baumannii (40), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates
(47). The combination of intI1 and IS6100 allows for the recruit-
ment of resistance genes by the integrase and the duplication and
transfer of large chromosomal inversions by IS6100 (47). Conse-
quently, resistance genes tend to colocalize, and the development
of complex resistance gene loci has been shown in single strains
(reviewed in reference 48) and recently to a small degree in met-
agenomic sequences (49). Less abundant resistance alleles cooccur
with these clusters as well (numbers in Fig. 4A and B), indicating
rare instances of different allelic composition of resistance clus-

 ters. (iv) The resistance genes confer resistance to antibiotics both
fed and not fed to the animals. With certainty, the NADC swine
were never fed aminoglycosides; however, the aminoglycoside
phosphotransferase strA [synonymous with aph(3�)-Ib] was
found to be statistically enriched with ASP250 feed (20). The
aph(3�)-Ib sequences obtained in this study were amplified with
the same primer as in reference 20 and are shown to cooccur with
blaTEM and in the same cluster as sul2, genes that were enriched
presumably because of the use of penicillin and sulfamethazine
(20). This potentially indicates their coselection by colocalization
of blaTEM and aph(3�)-Ib in single genomes, as has been observed
in E. coli strain 2009C-3133 (Table 1). Interestingly, E. coli gapA
alleles cooccur with the blaTEM-sul2 cluster, and E. coli was shown
previously to be enriched with ASP250 feed (20). Now, we show
the cooccurrence of E. coli, blaTEM, sul2, and aph(3�)-Ib, implicat-
ing E. coli, as the carrier of all the resistance genes, as the possible
mechanism of the coenrichment. In a similar manner, coselection
of resistance genes likely occurred with the intI1-IS6100 resistance
cluster. While each Chinese farm used different antibiotic cock-
tails for therapy and growth promotion (antibiotic usage reported
in reference 19), no farm reported the use of all the antibiotics for
which this cluster confers resistance (e.g., no farm used chloram-
phenicols or trimethoprim, Jiaxing did not use sulfonamides, and
Putian did not use aminoglycosides, while resistance to these an-
tibiotics is found across all farms). Thus, independent of antibiot-
ics used, the same genes, which may be ubiquitously distributed in
China, are maintained by selection and coselection of genetically
linked resistance genes.
Persistence of resistance genes despite their discontinued use
will be an obstacle in reversing the prevalence of antibiotic resis-
tance genes now present in the environment, on animal farms,
and in clinical settings, as has been observed in human popula-
tions (50). Coselection for resistance genes can occur when an
antibiotic (49, 51, 52), heavy metal (19, 53, 54), or disinfectant
(53) is introduced for which resistance to that agent and other
resistance genes are genetically clustered. The abaR1 resistance
island in Acinetobacter baumannii strain AYE is a case in point: it
has 45 antibiotic resistance genes, operons encoding arsenic and
mercury resistance, and the disinfectant efflux pump qacE�1 (40).
Our data highlight two important different cases of resistance
FIG4 (A and B) Average percent abundance of the five most abundant alleles (100% identity OTUs) from all primer sets in the Chinese farms (A) and the NADC
pigs (B). Allele abundance was determined for all samples combined (NADC and China). For this reason, the same allele number in both the Chinese and NADC
samples represents the same allele. For a detailed heat map of the abundance of the 40 most abundant alleles in all samples individually, see Fig. S4 in the
supplemental material. The genes are organized based on clustering structure of the data in the cooccurrence network (Fig. 1). Numbers on the bars indicate the
number of intergene edges (number of edges between the top five alleles of each gene; number of maximum intergene edges possible � 20) when the network
analysis is performed with the top five alleles rather than what is shown with only the most abundant allele. (C) Shannon diversity indices for both China and

 clusters. First, the IS1216-tet cluster, while very abundant in the
manure (the most abundant of all resistance alleles), is well elim-
inated by composting and land application. This may be due to the
degradation of tetracycline in these sites (55) and other IS1216-tet
cluster-related selective agents. However, the intI1-IS6100 cluster
remained abundant in all farms, and composting sometimes sig-
nificantly increased its enrichment, potentially due to chemical
persistence of sulfonamide molecules that were enriched by com-
posting (19) or by some other nondegraded coselective agent,
such as copper. As the use of many antibiotics will be phased out as
growth promoters in agriculture, monitoring of all antibiotic re-
sistance genes should continue in order to estimate the new prac-
tice’s impact on the total resistome.
Perhaps the most significant question in the field of antibiotic
resistance gene ecology is the frequency of horizontal resistance
gene transfer in the real world. Swine manure has been shown to
contain individual strains with transferable resistance plasmids
(21). Several studies have shown specific instances of horizontal
gene transfer of resistance genes in the human gut (56), swine
(57), and soil (30). Smillie et al. showed that the horizontal gene
transfer of resistance genes is more common than that of all other
genes and 25 times more likely in the gut than in other environ-
ments (58). Agricultural antibiotics have been shown to induce
resistance gene transfer by prophages (35). Metagenomic se-
quencing projects have shown that phylogeny is a strong predictor
of the antibiotic resistance profile in soil (59). In this study, Lac-
tobacillus was an indicator organism of the IS1216-tet resistance
cluster; however, there was no phylogenetic predictor of intI1-
IS6100. It is possible that our 16S rRNA primers did not amplify or
that the amplicon libraries were not sequenced sufficiently deeply
to identify the strains that cooccur with (and, by inference, carry)
these resistance genes. Another possible explanation is that a de-
coupling of resistance genes and phylogeny occurred in these
farms via horizontal gene transfer. Resistance clusters persisted
and were even enriched in multiple environments (especially in
the Putian soil) with different oxygen, nutrient, and water con-
tents where the original bacterial communities were vastly differ-
ent (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results provide a strong impetus
to more fully understand the genetic context of antibiotic resis-
tance genes in high-selection-pressure environments and the dis-
tribution of resistance elements throughout the associated bacte-
rial community.
In human-impacted environments, integrons have been
shown repeatedly to be important elements in assembling arrays
of antibiotic resistance cassettes, often on plasmids (37, 60, 61).
Clinical class 1 integrase (intI1) sequences showed very high en-
richment in the Chinese farms while the gene is hardly detected (3
to 4 orders of magnitude less abundant than Chinese manure) in
the pristine soil, NADC, and feral fecal samples (see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material). The obtained intI1 amplicon sequences
were dominated (89.4% of 125,847 total intI1 sequences) by a
single sequence which is 100% identical to “clinical” (34) type 1
integron integrase and is the allele that overwhelmingly cooccurs
with antibiotic resistance genes. When including all other opera-
tional taxonomic units (OTUs) within a single nucleotide poly-
morphism of the dominant sequence, these sequences account for
98.2% of the obtained sequences. These findings reinforce the
potential to use intI1 as a marker for anthropogenic antibiotic use
(34) and support the theory of broad dissemination of a single
genotype of class 1 integrons associated with antibiotic resistance
genes (37).
Antibiotic resistance genes are becoming recognized as con-
taminants independent of their bacterial host (28, 62). To pose a
human health risk, an agricultural ARG must be in or transferred
to a human pathogen, and the ARG must be transported to a
location with which humans have direct physical contact (63).
The probability of a resistance cluster from these farms contami-
nating surrounding heavily populated eastern China (~1 billion
people), through routes previously observed (aerial [64], water
[65], or farmer transport [66]), seems to be elevated by both the
thousands-fold enrichment resulting in up to 0.1 to 5% of the
bacterial community having resistance genes and the proximity to
high-population centers. Furthermore, the probability for these
resistance clusters to cross the commensal-pathogen barrier (due
to coenrichment with MGEs) also seems to be elevated (63). Hor-
izontal gene transfer elements like the intI1-IS6100 combination
allow not only resistance gene recruitment by the integrase but
genetic relocation, potentially to plasmids, by the transposases.
Transposons with both intI1 and IS6100 have been identified in
plasmids or chromosomes in multiple phyla (40, 42, 45–47), dem-
onstrating their potential for future horizontal gene transfer. On
the Chinese farms, one mobile genetic element, IS4, cooccurs with
many genes both within and outside the intI1-IS6100 cluster. This
gene might allow a future colocalization of its cooccurring genes
(IS26, aphA1, dfrA2, tetM, and IS613) together with the intI1-
IS6100 cluster. This genetic platform could allow for future inte-
gration and subsequent horizontal gene transfer of troublesome
resistance genes, should these strains be introduced to the human
microbiome or a hospital environment. This highlights the risk
and importance of these microbial communities and manure dis-
posal management.
Future sequencing projects should use advanced technologies
to sequence longer DNA amplicons to increase resolution of the
gene identity. Shotgun metagenomics cannot yet rival the cost,
depth, specificity, and quantitative value of this highly parallel
targeted-metagenomics approach. The future direction for anti-
biotic resistance ecology research is clear: to directly establish the
genetic context surrounding resistance genes in microbial com-
munities. This will allow us to understand the mobility of individ-
ual genes and groups of resistance genes, the assemblage of resis-
tance islands and plasmids, and their distribution across the
microbial community. This should be central to more informed
stewardship programs and contribute to the U.S. National Action
Plan (5) and international plans to combat antimicrobial resis-
tance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Amplicon library preparation and sequencing. All purified DNAs (46
samples in total) were stored at �20°C until use in this study. The 46
samples (50 ng/�l) and 47 primer sets were input into a 48.48 Access Array
integrated fluidic circuit (Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions for 4-primer amplicon tagging in 2,209
individual 30-nl qPCR mixtures. EvaGreen dye was added to the reaction
mixture to allow for real-time quantification of amplification products
during cycling. Threshold cycle values were obtained following cycling,
and the barcoded amplification products were pooled into one mixture.
The amplicon pool was prepared using Fluidigm FL1 and FL2 workflow
and sequencing primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Se-
quencing was performed using 150-bp paired-end reads plus the barcode
indexing read on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer, and 6.7 million raw reads

 were obtained, of which 6.0 million passed the MiSeq quality filter and
had a barcode detected. Each sample had an average of 128,679 sequences
matched to it by the barcode.
Genes targeted. We used a novel highly parallel qPCR and amplicon
library-generating platform (Fluidigm Access Array). Using this system,
we obtained quantitative information on the abundance of the genes in
the original sample and harvested sequencing-ready barcoded amplicons.
We selected primer sets that target antibiotic resistance genes, trans-
posases, integrases, plasmid mobility genes, and housekeeping genes (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material). We used two universal 16S rRNA
gene primers: one amplifies a 60-bp region, ideal for qPCR, while the
other amplifies the 16S rRNA gene V4 region to determine bacterial com-
munity membership. We selected for this study the genes that were found
to be enriched in the NADC or China samples from our previous studies
(19, 20), as well as primer sets to target additional mobile genetic elements
(32, 54, 67) and housekeeping genes (68, 69). Among the primer sets are
some that target the same genes. Amplicons of the same gene obtained
with different primers are differentiated with a gene suffix (for example,
aadA and aadA.1).
Resistance gene quantification and analysis. Threshold cycle values
obtained during library generation were quality checked by the Fluidigm
software and compared to values obtained previously with other high-
throughput qPCR platforms (19) to access the reliability of the gene quan-
tification. Following these quality checks, the data were processed as de-
scribed previously (19) to calculate the average ��CT for each sample
type, using the Chinese pristine soil as the reference sample. Heat maps
were generated for the ��CT using RStudio (R version 3.1.2) using the
heat map.2() function.
Sequence processing and analysis. In total, 5,490,078 forward and
reverse sequences (90.8%) were assembled with the RDP paired-end read
assembler (70) using default parameters and with the minimum overlap
set to 10 bp and a minimum read quality score of 25. Amplicons less than
195 bp from each primer had similar assembly rates ranging from 83% to
97% of raw reads. Longer amplicons were assembled at a lower rate (see
Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Assembled sequences were analyzed
to detect and remove chimeras using the Uchime software (71). RDP
FrameBot was used to correct frameshifts caused by indels. Sequences
were quality filtered with primers removed by RDP’s Initial Process tool
(70), allowing a minimum length of 20 bp, 0 N base calls, and 1 mismatch
to the forward or reverse primers. The resulting 5,289,504 quality-filtered
sequences in all samples and primer sets were clustered at 100% nucleo-
tide similarity using the RDP tool McClust. Project-wide single and dou-
ble sequences were removed, and the 16S rRNA gene sequences were
processed using mothur according to the Schloss standard analysis pro-
tocol (72). OTUs were binned by their taxonomic classification within
mothur v.1.36.0 by comparison to the RDP database using the phylo-
type() and classify.otu() commands. Metastats implemented within
mothur v.1.34.4 was used to find statistical differences (false discovery rate
q value, �0.05) in phylogenetic groups between samples.
Sequences were compared to the NCBI database both for primer spec-
ificity (see the supplemental material) and for multiple amplicon colocal-
ization in known genomes. Amplicon colocalization analysis was accom-
plished by submitting a concatenated sequence of all the most abundant
amplicons obtained from each primer set.
Cooccurrence analysis and network generation. In order to compare
the abundances of individual functional gene alleles to each other, we
adjusted the CT value of each functional gene to calculate an allele-specific
adjusted CT (ACT): ACT � CT �log2(allele % abundance), where CT is the
CT value of the primer set (the abundance of all alleles) specific to the allele
in question and the difference with log2(allele % abundance) adjusts that
CT value to estimate the contribution of each allele individually. This
calculation assumes 100% PCR efficiency and assumes that an allele with
a percent abundance of 0.5 will increase the CT by 1. For genes that were
not detected by qPCR or sequencing, the limit of detection was used to
calculate the ACT, and the percent abundance was set to 1/2,500, mimick-
ing the library sizes that were typically obtained. After generating the ACT,
the traditional ��CT approach was used, using the ACT only in place of
the CT to calculate a ��ACT rather than a ��CT. One deviation from this
protocol was ��ACT � �CT(control sample) � �ACT(experimental sample),
where the �CT used was that of the detection limit �CT of the pristine
Chinese soil. This use of a single value for �CT(control sample) was used to
avoid correlation artifacts between gene data sets. This resulted in a no-
detection ��ACT value of 7.8 for 16S OTUs and �15 for non-16S rRNA
genes.
Abundance
relative
to
16S
rRNA
was
calculated
using
log2(��ACT). The ��ACT for all 16S rRNA gene OTUs and the top 5
alleles for all other genes were concatenated into a single file and used as
input for cooccurrence analysis as described previously (73). Networks
were additionally rendered using Cytoscape v. 3.0.2. Networks were orga-
nized by the software’s “preferred layout” option, with node size depen-
dent on number of cooccurring genes (edges).
Sequence accession numbers. Assembled sequences separated by
sample and gene have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(SRA) under accession numbers SAMN04523341 to SAMN04523367 in
association with BioProject PRJNA313201.
