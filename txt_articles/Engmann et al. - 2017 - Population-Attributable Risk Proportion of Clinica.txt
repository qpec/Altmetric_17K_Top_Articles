Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Many established breast cancer risk factors are used in clinical risk prediction 
models, although the proportion of breast cancers explained by these factors is unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the population-attributable risk proportion (PARP) for breast cancer 
associated with clinical breast cancer risk factors among premenopausal and postmenopausal 
women.

 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Case-control study with 1:10 matching on age, 
year of risk factor assessment, and Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registry. Risk 
factor data were collected prospectively from January 1, 1996, through October 31, 2012, from 
BCSC community-based breast imaging facilities. A total of 18 437 women with invasive breast 
cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were enrolled as cases and matched to 184 309 women without 
breast cancer, with a total of 58 146 premenopausal and 144 600 postmenopausal women enrolled 
in the study.
EXPOSURES—Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density 
(heterogeneously or extremely dense vs scattered fibroglandular densities), first-degree family 
history of breast cancer, body mass index (>25 vs 18.5–25), history of benign breast biopsy, and 
nulliparity or age at first birth (≥30 years vs <30 years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Population-attributable risk proportion of breast 
cancer.
RESULTS—Of the 18 437 women with breast cancer, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (3.7) years 
among premenopausal women and 61.7 (7.2) years among the postmenopausal women. Overall, 
4747 (89.8%) premenopausal and 12 502 (95.1%) postmenopausal women with breast cancer had 
at least 1 breast cancer risk factor. The combined PARP of all risk factors was 52.7% (95% CI, 
49.1%–56.3%) among premenopausal women and 54.7% (95% CI, 46.5%–54.7%) among 
postmenopausal women. Breast density was the most prevalent risk factor for both premenopausal 
and postmenopausal women and had the largest effect on the PARP; 39.3% (95% CI, 36.6%–
42.0%) of premenopausal and 26.2% (95% CI, 24.4%–28.0%) of postmenopausal breast cancers 
could potentially be averted if all women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts shifted 
to scattered fibroglandular breast density. Among postmenopausal women, 22.8% (95% CI, 
18.3%–27.3%) of breast cancers could potentially be averted if all overweight and obese women 
attained a body mass index of less than 25.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Most women with breast cancer have at least 1 breast 
cancer risk factor routinely documented at the time of mammography, and more than half of 
premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers are explained by these factors. These easily 
assessed risk factors should be incorporated into risk prediction models to stratify breast cancer 
risk and promote risk-based screening and targeted prevention efforts.
One of the challenges in promoting the widespread utility of breast cancer risk prediction 
models has been the assertion that most women with a diagnosis of breast cancer have no 
established clinical breast cancer risk factors or are not considered to be high risk.1,2 
Although it is impossible to determine the cause of breast cancer in any individual case,3 
easily assessed risk factors that explain a substantial proportion of incident breast cancers 
can be used to stratify breast cancer risk for targeted screening4 and primary prevention5 and 
improve public health interventions to reduce breast cancer risk.
The population-attributable risk proportion (PARP) represents the proportion of disease 
cases in a population that would not have occurred in the absence of a risk factor. The PARP 
can be calculated for a single risk factor or combinations of risk factors and quantifies the 
proportion of cases averted if exposure to the risk factor was removed from the entire 
population, holding all other factors constant. The PARP incorporates both the prevalence of

 the risk factor and the magnitude of its association with disease; therefore, rare exposures 
with a high relative risk may explain a similar proportion of cases as common exposures 
with modest relative risks.
Previous studies of PARP have largely focused on quantifying the potential reductions in 
postmenopausal breast cancer incidence by intervening on modifiable factors.6–13 Estimates 
of the proportion of postmenopausal breast cancers that could be averted through lifestyle 
interventions range from 26%6,11 to 40.7%,12 and estimates for combinations of 
nonmodifiable factors range from 37.3% to 57.3%.6,12,14 To our knowledge, no studies have 
quantified the contributions of risk factors for pre-menopausal breast cancer, only 1 small 
study has included breast density as a risk factor,15 and none have examined the PARP for 
breast density using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scale,16 
which is the standard for reporting breast density in clinical practice in the United States.
We aimed to estimate the proportion of breast cancers attributable to breast cancer risk 
factors commonly documented in clinical practice and used in breast cancer risk prediction 
models, including BI-RADS breast density. We used data from a large cohort of women 
undergoing mammography at facilities participating in the Breast Cancer Surveillance 
Consortium (BCSC).
Methods
Study Population
Women with breast cancer and those serving as matched controls were selected from the 
BCSC, which comprises regional registries from across the United States that collect clinical 
characteristics and breast imaging data from community radiology facilities. Breast cancer 
diagnoses and tumor characteristics are obtained through linkage to pathology databases and 
regional Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programs or state cancer registries. 
Each registry and the statistical coordinating center received institutional review board 
approval for either active or passive consenting processes or a waiver of consent to enroll 
participants, link data, and perform analytic studies. The present study received approval 
from the institutional review boards of the Group Health, North Carolina, San Francisco, 
Vermont, and New Hampshire registries. All procedures are Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act compliant, and all registries and the statistical coordinating center 
received a federal certificate of confidentiality and other protection for the identities of 
women, physicians, and facilities. The BCSC cohort is described in further detail 
elsewhere.17,18
Five BCSC registries (New Hampshire, North Carolina, San Francisco, Vermont, and Group 
Health) contributed data for this analysis. Eligible cases were women aged 40 to 74 years 
who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ between 1996 
and 2015 and with a BI-RADS breast density measure and risk factor data available within 5 
years before their diagnosis. Risk factors and strength of associations with invasive cancer 
and ductal carcinoma in situ are similar,19,20 so both were included. Women with a history 
of breast cancer or missing menopausal status were excluded, as well as women with 
incomplete breast cancer risk factor data (Figure). We selected risk factor information

 associated with mammography examinations 1 year or more before diagnosis. For 4499 of 
18 437 women (24.4%), risk factor information was not available more than 1 year before 
the diagnosis, and data from within a year of diagnosis were used. Risk factor information 
was collected a mean (SD) of 20.4 (15.46) months (range, <1–60 months) before breast 
cancer diagnosis. As a sensitivity analysis, we excluded cases with risk factor information 
obtained within 1 year of diagnosis and our findings remained unchanged.
Ten controls were matched to each breast cancer case on menopausal status, age and year of 
risk factor assessment, and BCSC registry data. Eligible controls had no breast cancer 
diagnosis between the year of risk factor assessment and the year of diagnosis of her 
matched case. For age and year of risk factor information, we matched to controls differing 
up to ±5 years, selecting controls with the closest match to the case. A total of 17 607 cases 
(95.5%) matched to 10 controls on age and year exactly, and 16 cases (0.09%) matched to 
fewer than 10 controls. A total of 18 437 women with breast cancer and 184 309 matched 
controls were included.
Exposure Assessment
Demographics and breast cancer risk factors were obtained through questionnaires 
completed at each mammography visit. Questionnaires included birth date, race, ethnicity, 
height, weight, first-degree family history of breast cancer, menopause status, parity, and age 
at first birth. Body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters 
squared) was calculated as underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight 
(25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.4), and obesity class II or III (≥35.0).21 History of 
benign breast biopsy was obtained by self-report and through linkages with pathology 
databases. The American College of Radiology’s BI-RADS system, assigned by clinical 
radiologists, was used to classify breast density as a, almost entirely fat; b, scattered 
fibroglandular densities; c, heterogeneously dense; and d, extremely dense.22
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were stratified by menopausal status. We used descriptive statistics to assess 
differences in demographics and clinical characteristics for cases and controls. Risk factors 
selected a priori for analysis were dense breasts (heterogeneously dense or extremely dense), 
first-degree relative with breast cancer, history of benign breast biopsy, and nulliparity or age 
at first birth 30 years or older. We considered BMI of 25 or more to be a risk factor only for 
postmenopausal breast cancer. Multivariable conditional logistic regression, stratified by 
matched set, was used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% CIs associated with each risk 
factor.
The PARP was calculated using the generalized regression-based approach described by 
Bruzzi et al,23 allowing for the calculation of joint PARP for combinations of risk factors. 
The multivariable combined PARP was measured by the equation

 where pdi is the proportion of cases in stratum i of the risk factor distribution and RRi is the 
multivariable adjusted relative risk associated with that stratum of the risk factor. Odds ratios 
from the multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used as relative risk 
estimates.23 The PARP was calculated for individual risk factors and combinations of risk 
factors. For each factor, the reference level reported in Table 1 is considered the low-risk 
category. For combinations of factors, the PARP represents the proportion of cases 
eliminated in the population if everyone shifted to the referent category for all included 
variables. When the referent category for PARP was not the lowest level of exposure, the 
lowest level of exposure was assumed to remain unchanged. The 95% CIs were calculated 
using bootstrapping.24 All analyses were conducted in R, version 3.2.1 (R Foundation).
Results
A total of 5286 premenopausal women with breast cancer were matched to 52 860 women 
without breast cancer, and 13 151 postmenopausal women with breast cancer were matched 
to 131 449 women without breast cancer. The mean age of pre-menopausal women was 46.3 
(3.7) years compared with a mean age of 61.7 (7.2) years for postmenopausal women. The 
sample was predominantly non-Hispanic white (>75% of women) with smaller percentages 
of Asian, Hispanic, and African American women. Women with breast cancer were more 
likely to have a first-degree family history of breast cancer, a history of benign breast biopsy, 
dense breasts, and an older age at first birth compared with the controls (Table 1). 
Postmenopausal women with breast cancer were more likely to be overweight or obese.
Overall, 89.8% (n = 4747) of premenopausal women with breast cancer and 95.1% (n = 12 
502) of postmenopausal women with breast cancer had at least 1 risk factor, compared with 
81.6% (n = 43 111) of premenopausal controls and 91.5% (n = 120 227) of postmenopausal 
controls. Most premenopausal cases (56.5% [n = 2988]) had 2 or more risk factors compared 
with only 42.2% (n = 22 318) of premenopausal controls. Postmenopausal women, on 
average, had more risk factors, with 66.2% (n = 8699) of cases having 2 or more risk factors 
compared with 53.7% (n = 70 566) of the control women.
First-degree family history of breast cancer, history of benign breast biopsy, dense breasts, 
and nulliparity or age at first birth older than 30 years were associated with an increased risk 
of breast cancer (Table2). Obesity was not associated with breast cancer risk among 
premenopausal women, but overweight and obese postmenopausal women were at a higher 
risk of breast cancer. This association showed a statistically significant positive association, 
with overweight, obesity class I, and obesity class II or III women having 1.23, 1.39, and 
1.54 times the odds of breast cancer relative to normal weight women.
Among premenopausal women, the largest individual PARP was for breast density, with 
39.3% (95% CI, 36.6%–42.0%) of breast cancers potentially removed by reducing breast 
density from BI-RADS heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts to scattered 
fibroglandular densities. The PARP for breast density increased to 65.5% (95% CI, 60.4%–
70.6%) if all premenopausal women reduced their breast density to the lowest category of 
almost entirely fat. A more modest reduction of all women shifting to a single lower BI-
RADS category would result in a PARP of 13.4% (95% CI, 11.0%–15.8%). Among

 premenopausal women, the combination of first-degree family history, history of benign 
breast biopsy, age at first birth, and breast density had a PARP of 52.7% (95% CI, 49.1%–
56.3%) (Table 3).
Individual PARPs for first-degree family history, age at first birth, and history of benign 
breast biopsy were similar for pre-menopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. However, 
overweight and obesity accounted for a large proportion of postmenopausal breast cancers, 
with a PARP of 22.8% (95% CI, 18.3%–27.3%) if all obese and overweight women 
achieved a normal BMI. The estimated PARP for shifting all postmenopausal women to the 
BI-RADS category of almost entirely fat was 43.9% (95% CI, 39.6%–48.2%), whereas 
shifting only extremely or heterogeneously dense breasts to scattered fibroglandular 
densities was 26.2% (95% CI, 24.4%–28.0%). The PARP was 12.7% (95% CI, 11.2%–
14.3%) for reductions of a single BI-RADS category. The combination of first-degree family 
history, history of benign breast biopsy, nulliparity or age at first birth older than 30 years, 
breast density (with scattered fibro-glandular densities as reference) and BMI yielded a 
combined postmenopausal PARP of 54.7% (95% CI, 51.6–57.8) (Table 3).
Discussion
We found that routinely collected clinical risk factors included in breast cancer risk models 
may explain 52.7% of pre-menopausal and 54.7% of postmenopausal breast cancers. A 
substantial proportion of breast cancers can be attributed to high breast density alone, 
suggesting that behaviors or interventions that reduce breast density have the potential to 
eliminate a large proportion of breast cancers in both premenopausal and postmenopausal 
women. These easily assessed breast cancer risk factors are highly prevalent among 
premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer; more than half of the breast 
cancer cases in the population are attributable to these factors and thus they offer promise for 
risk-based screening and prevention strategies.
Although breast density is a well-established, strong, and prevalent breast cancer risk factor, 
few studies have quantified the PARP of breast density and, to our knowledge, none have 
used the BI-RADS classification utilized in clinical practice. In a study of Canadian women, 
Boyd et al15 found a PARP of 16% if women with more than 50% breast density reduced 
their breast density to 50% or less,15 and this PARP was much greater (approximately 40%) 
for cancers detected within 12 months of a negative screening examination, reflecting the 
increased probability of a masking effect in dense breasts.25 We found a PARP 
approximately 2-fold higher than that of Boyd et al if the breast density in all women shifted 
to the BI-RADS scattered fibroglandular density category and the PARP was unaltered in a 
sensitivity analysis excluding women with breast density measured within 1 year of 
diagnosis. Differences between our and Boyd et al’s study may reflect distinctions between a 
classification of greater than 50% density using quantitative measures that include a smaller 
proportion of women with substantial amounts of density, whereas the qualitative BI-RADS 
classification of heterogeneously or extremely dense includes larger proportions of 
women.26 Furthermore, the use of 50% or less as a reference category is likely to attenuate 
the relative risk used in the PARP, since the literature suggests that women with 10% to 50%

 breast density have an increased breast cancer risk compared with women with less than 
10% density.27
We found that reductions in breast density of a single BI-RADS category would avert 13.4% 
of breast cancers among premenopausal women and 12.7% among postmenopausal women; 
such a reduction would prevent more cases than reducing any other risk factor in this study, 
with the exception of BMI in postmenopausal women. Studies of longitudinal changes in BI-
RADS breast density suggest that a reduction of a single BI-RADS category reduced breast 
cancer risk relative to density that remained stable or increased.28,29 Our results suggest that 
shifting the distribution of breast density down a single category would still result in a 
substantial reduction in breast cancers in the population. Reductions of a single BI-RADS 
category could potentially be achieved through increased breastfeeding, as well as primary 
prevention with tamoxifen citrate for those at highest risk.30–33 These interventions 
effectively reduce breast density, but must be carefully considered in the context of 
anticipated harms. Our results highlight the necessity for new approaches to reduce breast 
density that could be widely adopted without adverse consequences, as reductions in breast 
density have the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of breast cancer.
To our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated the PARP of clinical breast cancer risk 
factors in combination with breast density. However, our results are broadly consistent with 
previous literature evaluating nonmodifiable clinical risk factors, with PARP estimates 
ranging from 37.2%6 to 57.3%12 combining the risk factors of age at menarche, menopause, 
and first full-term pregnancy; parity; family history of breast cancer; and benign breast 
disease. Estimates of the PARP of BMI in postmenopausal women have been disparate 
across studies; Barnes et al6 estimated a PARP of 2% by shifting all women to a BMI of 
22.4 or lower, Mezzetti et al9 estimated a PARP of 10.2% by shifting all women to a BMI of 
23.3, and 3 additional studies found PARPs of 8.0%, 9.5%, and 24.8% by shifting women to 
a BMI of less than 25.8,10,34 It is difficult to directly compare our results with previous 
findings because of different reference categories. Our finding of a PARP of 22.8% may 
reflect the high prevalence of overweight and obese postmenopausal women in the United 
States compared with studies in European populations. Our results suggest that excess 
bodyweight plays an important role in postmenopausal breast cancer, further reinforcing the 
need for weight reduction and management to prevent a substantial proportion of breast 
cancers. In the absence of interventions, the PARP for obesity will increase with the 
prevalence of obesity in the United States.35
Our study included more than 200 000 women from BCSC community breast imaging 
registries, which is broadly representative of the demographic composition of women in the 
United States18 and with clinical risk factor distributions nearly identical to the distributions 
estimated in the population-based National Health Interview Survey (eFigure 1 and eFigure 
2 in the Supplement). The BCSC 5- and 10-year absolute risk calculator was developed 
within the same cohort of women,36,37 although the use of breast cancer risk models to 
identify women for primary and secondary preventions has been controversial, with a 
commonly expressed concern that most women with breast cancer have no known risk 
factors. We found that only 10% of premenopausal and less than 5% of postmenopausal 
breast cancers in our study had no clinical risk factors. The impact of assessing clinical

 breast cancer risk factors in combination with breast density is considerable, explaining 
more than half of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers and identifying risk 
factors where targeted public health interventions would have the greatest impact. These 
factors represent clinically available information that can and should be used by clinicians to 
stratify breast cancer risk for improved risk-based screening and primary and secondary 
prevention efforts.4
Strengths and Limitations
Estimates of the PARP are sensitive to changes in category definitions that alter the 
prevalence and relative risk of the risk factor.3,38 We chose categories based on clinical 
relevance, but examined how robust our findings were to changes in the reference group 
corresponding to ideal compared with more realistic interventions to change risk factor 
distributions. Close attention to risk factor prevalence should be considered when applying 
our results to other populations. We were unable to measure other behavioral and genetic 
risk factors; thus, our estimated PARP likely underestimates the joint PARP of all known 
risk factors. Our study uses risk factor and breast density information from 1996–2015—a 
period when the BI-RADS density category definitions changed. Despite these changes, 
there is no evidence of a difference in the distribution of breast density over time in the 
BCSC.22 Studies have found mixed results for interrater and intrarater reliability of the BI-
RADS categories39–42; however, relative risks for breast cancer are similar comparing BI-
RADS with more objective quantitative density measurements.43 Most importantly, BI-
RADS is presently the only measure of breast density used routinely in clinical practice; 
thus, using BI-RADS enhances the clinical utility of our estimates for risk stratification and 
screening and prevention efforts.
Our study has several strengths, including collection of clinically available breast cancer risk 
factors. We provide novel insights into the contributions of breast density on a population 
level, reinforcing existing interventions to reduce breast density among high-risk women and 
the need for acceptable behaviors and novel interventions to reduce risk in women at high 
and average risk. Finally, we provide what we believe to be the first estimate of PARP for 
clinical risk factors in pre-menopausal women, and our results suggest that, with the 
exception of BMI, the PARP of most risk factors is similar among premenopausal and 
postmenopausal women.44
Conclusions
In what we believe to be the largest study of PARP in US women, we found that most 
premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer have at least 1 breast cancer 
risk factor, and that breast density and clinical risk factors may explain more than half of 
breast cancer cases. These risk factors represent clinically available data that can and should 
be used to stratify risk, using established risk models that include breast density, to promote 
risk-based screening and targeted prevention efforts. Future research should assess whether 
PARP estimates differ by molecular subtypes of breast cancer, where the magnitude and 
direction of risk factors may differ.45–48

 Key Points
Question
What proportion of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers are attributed to 
commonly collected clinical risk factors?
Findings
In this population-based, case-control, cohort study of 202 746 women, breast density 
and body mass index had the largest individual population-attributable risk proportion. 
Thirty-nine percent of premenopausal and 26% of postmenopausal breast cancers could 
be prevented if breast density in women with dense breasts was reduced to scattered 
fibroglandular densities on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scale, and 
postmenopausal breast cancer incidence would be reduced by 23% if all women achieved 
a body mass index less than 25.
Meaning
Clinical breast cancer risk factors explain a large proportion of breast cancer incidence 
and should be used in the clinical setting for risk stratification and targeted screening and 
prevention efforts.
