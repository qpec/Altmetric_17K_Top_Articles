Summary
Background Progesterone administration has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth and neonatal morbidity 
in women at high risk, but there is uncertainty about longer term effects on the child.
Methods We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of vaginal progesterone, 200 mg daily taken 
from 22–24 to 34 weeks of gestation, on pregnancy and infant outcomes in women at risk of preterm birth (because 
of previous spontaneous birth at ≤34 weeks and 0 days of gestation, or a cervical length ≤25 mm, or because of a 
positive fetal fibronectin test combined with other clinical risk factors for preterm birth [any one of a history in a 
previous pregnancy of preterm birth, second trimester loss, preterm premature fetal membrane rupture, or a history 
of a cervical procedure to treat abnormal smears]). The objective of the study was to determine whether vaginal 
progesterone prophylaxis given to reduce the risk of preterm birth affects neonatal and childhood outcomes. We 
defined three primary outcomes: fetal death or birth before 34 weeks and 0 days gestation (obstetric), a composite of 
death, brain injury, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (neonatal), and a standardised cognitive score at 2 years of age 
(childhood), imputing values for deaths. Randomisation was done through a web portal, with participants, 
investigators, and others involved in giving the intervention, assessing outcomes, or analysing data masked to 
treatment allocation until the end of the study. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ISRCTN.
com, number ISRCTN14568373.
Findings Between Feb 2, 2009, and April 12, 2013, we randomly assigned 1228 women to the placebo group (n=610) 
and the progesterone group (n=618). In the placebo group, data from 597, 587, and 439 women or babies were 
available for analysis of obstetric, neonatal, and childhood outcomes, respectively; in the progesterone group the 
corresponding numbers were 600, 589, and 430. After correction for multiple outcomes, progesterone had no 
significant effect on the primary obstetric outcome (odds ratio adjusted for multiple comparisons [OR] 0·86, 95% CI 
0·61–1·22) or neonatal outcome (OR 0·72, 0·44–1·17), nor on the childhood outcome (cognitive score, progesterone 
group vs placebo group, 97·3 [SD 17·9] vs 97·7 [17·5]; difference in means –0·48, 95% CI –2·77 to 1·81). Maternal or 
child serious adverse events were reported in 70 (11%) of 610 patients in the placebo group and 59 (10%) of 616 patients 
in the progesterone group (p=0·27).
Interpretation Vaginal progesterone was not associated with reduced risk of preterm birth or composite neonatal 
adverse outcomes, and had no long-term benefit or harm on outcomes in children at 2 years of age.

Introduction
Several studies have assessed either vaginal progesterone 
or intramuscular 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for 
the prevention of preterm birth in asymptomatic women 
with singleton pregnancy at high risk of preterm birth. 
An individual patient data meta-analysis of women with 
a short cervix showed that vaginal progesterone reduced 
the risk of preterm birth before 33 weeks (relative risk 
[RR] 0·58, 95% CI 0·42–0·80) and reduced a composite 
of neonatal mortality and morbidity (RR 0·57, 
0·40–0·81).1 Although there is debate whether vaginal 
and intramuscular therapies have similar mechanisms 
or efficacy, the Cochrane Library meta-analysis groups 
the two treatments together, but reports separately for 
different maternal risk groups.2 Reduced risk of preterm 
birth before 34 weeks was shown in women with a short 
cervix (RR 0·64, 95% CI 0·45–0·90), without effect 
on perinatal mortality or neonatal death (perinatal 
mortality RR 0·74, 0·42–1·29; neonatal death RR 0·55, 
0·26–1·13).2 By contrast, in women with previous 
preterm birth, progestogens reduced the incidence of 
preterm birth (RR 0·31, 95% CI 0·14–0·69), perinatal

mortality and neonatal death.2 Although intramuscular 
17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate is licensed for women 
with a previous preterm birth, an independent analysis 
of data on vaginal progesterone for a US Food and Drug 
Administration advisory panel showed no benefit, with 
the panel concluding that “the overall risk/benefit profile 
[is] not acceptable” to support approval of vaginal 
progesterone in women with a short cervix.3
Despite recommendations for progesterone use4 there 
are few data on long-term benefit or safety for the baby 
beyond the neonatal period. Adverse childhood effects of 
preterm birth include neurodevelopmental and cognitive 
impairments, and increase with degree of prematurity.5 
Progesterone, by delaying birth and reducing prematurity, 
might reduce risk of impairment, but this could be offset 
by direct fetal harm by continuing prolonged exposure to 
intrauterine infection or inflammation, commonly 
associated with preterm labour. Furthermore, therapies 
applied in pregnancy might have differing effects in the 
neonatal period and early childhood (benefit in one and 
harm in another), as shown in the ORACLE II trial of 
antibiotics in spontaneous preterm labour6,7 and in trials 
of multiple doses of corticosteroids.8 Hence, further 
information 
on 
childhood 
outcomes 
following 
progesterone treatment is required to determine the 
risk–benefit ratio of this therapy.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Vaginal progesterone administration has been shown to reduce 
the risk of preterm birth and neonatal morbidity in women at 
high risk, but there is uncertainty about longer term effects on 
the child. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth 
Group’s Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library) until Feb 4, 2016, on 
MEDLINE (Jan 1, 1996, to Feb 4, 2016), and PubMed (Jan 1, 
1974, to Feb 4, 2016) using the terms “progesterone/
progestogen” AND “preterm birth prevention” AND 
“randomised trial” with no language restrictions. We also 
searched reference lists of trials and other review articles 
identified from this initial search and from our records. We 
excluded women with multiple pregnancy and those with 
symptoms of preterm labour. We identified two systematic 
reviews that compared preterm birth rates, neonatal outcomes, 
or childhood outcomes in women treated with progesterone or 
progestogens compared with those treated with placebo: a 
conventional meta-analysis published by the Cochrane 
collaboration  and an individual patient data meta-analysis. No 
additional randomised trials were identified which were not 
included in the Cochrane review. Neither of the meta-analyses 
reported on our three primary outcomes, those of fetal death or 
delivery, either occurring before 34 weeks and 0 days of 
gestation (obstetric primary outcome); a composite of death, 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and brain injury on cerebral 
ultrasound (neonatal primary outcome); or the Bayley-III 
cognitive composite score at 22–26 months of chronological age 
(childhood primary outcome). One individual patient data 
meta-analysis of women with a short cervix reported the effect 
of vaginal progesterone on the outcomes of preterm birth before 
33 weeks (relative risk [RR] 0·58, 95% CI 0·42–0·80), and on a 
composite of neonatal mortality and morbidity (RR 0·57, 
0·40–0·81). This individual patient data meta-analysis was 
restricted to women treated with vaginal progesterone. The 
Cochrane Library meta-analysis grouped women treated with 
any progestogen and reported on risk of preterm birth before 
34 weeks review for women with a short cervix (RR 0·64, 95% CI 
0·45–0·90), and on perinatal mortality (RR 0·74, 0·42–1·29) or 
neonatal death (RR 0·55, 0·26–1·13). Regarding women with a 
previous preterm birth, the Cochrane Library reported that 
progestogens reduced the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0·31, 
95% CI 0·14–0·69), and both perinatal mortality (RR 0·50, 
0·33–0·75) and neonatal death (RR 0·45, 0·27–0·76). Neither the 
individual patient data meta-analysis nor the Cochrane review 
were able to report on childhood outcomes, with the Cochrane 
review noting that  “there is limited information available 
relating to longer-term infant and childhood outcomes, the 
assessment of which remains a priority”.
Added value of this study
The OPPTIMUM study is, to our knowledge, the largest study to 
compare obstetric, neonatal, and childhood outcomes in 
high-risk women with singleton pregnancy treated with vaginal 
progesterone to prevent preterm birth. It is one of the few studies 
to look at childhood effects. In OPPTIMUM, by contrast with 
some of the published literature, vaginal progesterone was not 
significantly associated with reduced risk either of preterm birth 
or of composite neonatal adverse outcomes. Additionally, 
progesterone had no significant long-term benefit or harm on 
outcomes in children at 2 years of age. The primary outcomes 
reported in OPPTIMUM were different from the outcomes 
reported in the meta-analyses described above (and indeed 
different from the primary outcomes in the source studies), hence 
meta-analysis of the evidence to provide a meaningful pooled 
estimate was not possible. We plan an individual patient data 
level analysis that will be able to address complexities such as 
different inclusion criteria for the studies, different progestogens 
used (vaginal progesterone or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone 
caproate), and the differences in outcome reporting.  
Implications of all the available evidence
The findings from OPPTIMUM are different to some of those 
reported in the literature. For the first time, we show childhood 
outcomes of progesterone to prevent preterm birth. The results 
of OPPTIMUM should prompt a major review of the use of 
progesterone for preterm birth prophylaxis, a search to identify 
specific women who might specifically benefit, and a 
redoubling of efforts to find alternative strategies to prevent 
preterm birth in women at risk.

Therefore, we did a double-blind randomised trial to 
determine whether vaginal progesterone prophylaxis 
given to reduce the risk of preterm birth affects neonatal 
and childhood outcomes.
Methods
Study design and participants
OPPTIMUM (dOes Progesterone Prophylaxis To prevent 
preterm labour IMprove oUtcoMe?) is a multicentre 
randomised 
double-blind 
placebo-controlled 
trial. 
Women were recruited from 65 UK National Health 
Service hospitals and one Swedish hospital. An 
abbreviated protocol has been published.9
The study was granted approval by the Scotland A 
Research Ethics Committee (reference 08/MRE00/6). 
Clinical trials authorisation was given by the Medicines and 
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA reference 
22931/0009/001-0001 later revised to 01384/0208/001). A 
trial steering committee and a Data Monitoring Committee 
supervised the conduct of the study (appendix).
The study comprised a screening phase at 18–24 weeks 
and 0 days gestation and a treatment phase, starting at 
between 22 and 24 weeks of gestation. Written informed 
consent was obtained for both the screening phase (at 
18–24 weeks and 0 days gestation) and treatment phase 
(between 22 and 24 weeks gestational age). All women 
had a singleton pregnancy, with gestational age 
established by ultrasound scan before 16 weeks, and were 
16 years or older at screening. Women with clinical risk 
factors for preterm birth (any of a history in a previous 
pregnancy of preterm birth, or second trimester loss, or 
preterm premature fetal membrane rupture, or any 
history of a cervical procedure to treat abnormal smears) 
and a positive fetal fibronectin test at 22–24 weeks of 
gestation were eligible for random allocation in the 
treatment phase from the beginning of the trial, and 
designated fibronectin positive. After analysis of 
preliminary (masked) data in July, 2010, and the 
publication of a systematic review on screening for 
preterm birth,10 we realised that our initial selection 
strategy erroneously missed women at medium-to-high 
risk of preterm birth. Thus, from Sept 1, 2010, after 
recruitment of the initial 84 women, fibronectin-negative 
women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth at 
34 weeks or less of gestation, or a cervical length of 
25 mm or less were also eligible for inclusion, and 
designated a fibronectin-negative group (see appendix 
for detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
fibronectin-positive 
or 
fibronectin-negative 
group 
allocation). 
There 
are 
no 
nationally 
agreed 
recommendations on which pregnant women should be 
screened for preterm birth risk by measuring cervical 
length, nor did the OPPTIMUM protocol include 
recommendations on who should undergo cervical 
length screening, hence any such measurements were 
made by clinicians on an individual patient basis before 
the woman’s recruitment to OPPTIMUM. A cervical 
length of 25 mm or less at any time between 18 and 
24 weeks and 0 days gestation in the index pregnancy 
conferred eligibility for recruitment.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible 
women 
were 
allocated 
(1:1) 
to 
either 
progesterone 200 mg soft capsules (Utrogestan, Besins 
Healthcare) 
or 
an 
identical 
appearing 
placebo. 
Assignment to treatment allocation was done through a 
web portal hosted by the study data centre at the 
Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, at the Glasgow 
Clinical Trials Unit, University of Glasgow. The 
randomisation schedule was computer-generated at the 
Robertson Centre, using the method of randomised 
permuted blocks of length four, stratified by history of a 
previous pregnancy of more than 14 weeks of gestation 
and by study centre. Allocation concealment was 
achieved by use of a placebo, which appeared identical 
to the active drug. Participants were asked for informed 
consent and enrolled by collaborating clinicians (listed 
in this Article and the appendix), who used the web 
portal described above to randomly assign participants 
to treatment. Treatment allocation corresponded to a 
box number in the local pharmacy, containing either 
active or placebo drug. Participants, investigators, 
pharmacists, and others involved in giving the 
intervention, assessing outcomes, or analysing data 
remained masked to treatment allocation until the end 
of the study. There was no formal attempt made to 
assess the success of masking.
Procedures
The participant administered the vaginal study medication 
daily at bedtime, commencing from about 22–24 weeks of 
gestation until 34 weeks or delivery of the baby, whichever 
was sooner. Co-administration of bromocriptine, rifamycin, 
ketoconazole, or ciclosporin was prohibited due to potential 
drug interactions. Rules for individual women to stop 
treatment on safety grounds (eg, after development of 
symptomatic placenta praevia) are defined in the protocol. 
Compliance (assessed for each woman using a 
combination of medication pack returns, patient diaries, 
and patient self-reports) was calculated as the percentage 
of doses of study medication used divided by the expected 
doses. Adequate compliance was taken as 80% of 
prescribed medication.
Data were collected at screening, randomisation, 34 weeks 
of gestation, during labour and delivery, during the neonatal 
stay and at 1 and 2 years post-delivery to determine clinical 
outcomes. 2 year assessments, based on chronological age 
because of the mixed term and preterm population, were 
done at the local hospital clinic or at home. This assessment 
comprised the parent-completed structured clinical history, 
a parent-completed behavioural measure (the Strengths 
and Difficulties Questionnaire) and the cognitive scale of 
the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd 
Edition (Bayley-III). All assessments were undertaken by

assessors who had received training, either from the study 
centre or via a national course; all met prespecified criteria 
of 90% agreement or more on an item-by-item basis with an 
independent psychologist. Record forms were checked 
centrally for consistency and completeness. For children for 
whom we could not arrange a clinic assessment we 
requested information from the family doctor concerning 
general health and the presence of motor, sensory, and 
developmental concerns. 
Outcomes
We defined three primary outcomes: either fetal death or 
delivery occurring before 34 weeks and 0 days of gestation 
(obstetric outcome); a composite of death, broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia, and brain injury on cerebral 
ultrasound (neonatal outcome); and the Bayley-III 
cognitive composite score at 22–26 months of 
chronological age (childhood outcome).
Brain injury was defined as any intraventricular 
haemorrhage (excluding subependymal haemorrhages), 
parenchymal cystic lesion or haemorrhagic lesion, 
or 
persistent 
ventriculomegaly 
(ventricular 
index 
>97th percentile). All scans were reported locally. All 
abnormal scans and 10% of normal scans were reviewed 
centrally 
masked 
to 
the 
local 
report 
(NM). 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (severe chronic lung 
disease) was defined as need for at least 30% oxygen or 
positive pressure (positive pressure ventilation or nasal 
continuous positive airway pressure) at 36 weeks 
postmenstrual age or discharge, whichever came first.
Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were as follows: 
gestational age at delivery (weeks); deaths up to 2 years of 
age; death after trial entry up to the end of study; daily 
category of care after delivery room (normal or special or 
high dependency or intensive); surfactant administration; 
suspected or confirmed necrotising entercolitis; neonatal 
infections (one or more discrete episodes with positive 
blood culture among those with infection, one or more 
discrete episodes with positive CNS culture among those 
with infection); maternal or child serious adverse events 
during pregnancy and birth; composite outcome of death 
or moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 
2 years; moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impair-
ment; individual components of disability; admissions to 
hospital during follow-up; behavioural scale scores at 
2 years assessed in strengths and difficulties questionnaire; 
change in EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) from baseline to birth; 
change in EQ-5D from baseline to 12 months; and 
women’s perception of treatment 1 month post-delivery 
(the proportion extremely or fairly satisfied). Outcomes 
were 
categorised 
as 
moderate 
or 
severe 
using 
published definitions.11
Statistical analysis
A statistical analysis plan was finalised before data lock. 
Statistical analyses were done by C-MM and AM at the 
Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, Glasgow University 
according to the intention-to-treat principle. The three 
primary outcomes and secondary outcomes were 
compared between the treatment groups using mixed

effects logistic regression (or, for continuous variables, 
linear regression) models including treatment allocation 
and previous pregnancy (≥14 weeks) as fixed effects, with 
study centre as a random effect. According to the 
prespecified statistical analysis plan, p values were initially 
reported without adjustment for multiple comparisons, 
then adjusted using a Bonferroni-Holm procedure.12 The 
planned sample size was around 1125 participants, 
depending on the relative numbers of fetal fibronectin-
positive and fetal fibronectin-negative women recruited.9 
Detailed sample size calculations are available in the 
published protocol, but in brief the study had at least 80% 
power to detect what was considered the minimal 
important clinical difference for each of the three primary 
outcomes at a nominal 5% level of significance.9
Sensitivity analyses included repeating the primary 
analyses in a per-protocol dataset (which excluded data 
from women who were found not to be compliant with the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria, or who had a structural or 
chromosomal fetal anomaly discovered after inclusion, or 
who had a multiple pregnancy discovered after inclusion 
or who were not adequately compliant with treatment by 
the prespecified definition), and the use of multiple 
imputation of missing primary outcome data. Preplanned 
subgroup analyses for primary outcomes were done by 
extending the main regression models to include 
interaction terms for the following subgroups: fibronectin 
positive or fibronectin negative, cervical length of at most 
25 mm or longer than 25 mm, cervical length of at most 
15 mm or longer than 15 mm, chorioamnionitis yes or no, 
history of spontaneous preterm birth or no such history, 
and history of preterm birth or no such history. Safety 
outcomes (adverse events) were assessed in a safety 
population, excluding women for whom it was documented 
that no study medication was taken. This trial is registered 
with ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN14568373.
Role of the funding source
Neither the funders of the study nor the provider of active 
and placebo medication had any role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. C-MM and AM had full access to all 
the data in the study and JEN had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication. 
Results
We reviewed the case notes of 15 132 women for eligibility, 
between Feb 2, 2009, and April 12, 2013. 1228 (8%) were 
subsequently randomly assigned, 610 allocated to placebo 
and 618 to progesterone (figure). Two of these women 
were randomised in error and were excluded from 
initiating on treatment and the intention-to-treat 
population. Baseline characteristics of participants in the 
intention-to-treat population were balanced across the 
two allocated groups (table 1). The number of women 
randomly assigned per site ranged from one to 165; three 
sites screened but did not randomly assign participants. 
Information on the obstetric, neonatal, and childhood 
primary outcomes was available for 1197 (97%), 
1176 (96%), and 869 (71%) of participants, respectively. 
There were few differences in baseline characteristics 
between those for whom primary outcome data was or 
was not available (appendix).
Information from diary returns for 1011 (82%) women 
showed 80% or more compliance in 361 (71%) of 509 in 
the placebo group and 333 (66%) of 502 in the 
progesterone group. For compliant women, the median 
percentage 
of 
medication 
taken 
was 
92·3% 
(IQR 71·6–98·7) and 92·9% (59·0–98·6), respectively. 
No woman terminated treatment because of prespecified 
discontinuation rules.
Although the point estimate of the odds ratio (OR) was 
in the direction of benefit, administration of progesterone 
did not significantly alter the risk of the obstetric (fetal 
death or birth before 34 weeks) or neonatal (a composite of 
death, brain injury, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia)

outcome after the prespecified adjustment for multiple 
comparisons (Bonferroni-Holm procedure): OR 0·86 
(95% CI 0·61–1·22) for the obstetric outcome and OR 0·72 
(0·44–1·17) for the neonatal outcome (table 2). Similarly, 
there was no effect on childhood outcomes (cognitive score 
97·7 [SD 17·5] for placebo and 97·3 [17·9] for progesterone; 
difference in means –0·48, adjusted 95% CI –2·77 to 1·81).
Among the components of the primary obstetric and 
neonatal outcomes, the proportion of babies with observed 
neonatal brain injuries on cerebral ultrasound scanning 
was lower in the progesterone group (18 [3%] of 584 vs 34 
[6%] of 574; OR 0·50, 95% CI 0·31–0·84; table 2). A 
reduction in brain injury was also observed in a sensitivity 
analysis restricted to participants in whom a neonatal 
brain scan was done (n=776; OR 0·54, 95% CI 0·32–0·88). 
There were no obvious differences in neonatal death 
between the two groups, and the low numbers precluded 
planned adjustment for the covariate previous pregnancy 
at 14 weeks or longer gestation.
Similar results for primary outcomes were achieved in 
per-protocol analyses (687 [56%] of 1226 patients in the 
intention-to-treat population; appendix); in analyses with 
multiple imputations of missing data on the primary 
outcomes (appendix); and in alternative multiple com-
parison procedures, including the Sidak-Holm method 
and permutation adjustment (50 000 permutations; data 
not shown). Comparison of characteristics of women 
included and not included in the per-protocol analysis are 
shown in the appendix. An additional sensitivity analysis 
with imputations for the variable smoking was done post 
hoc because of the difference in smoking prevalence in 
those with and without outcome data: again this generated 
similar results to the main analysis (data not shown). A 
post-hoc survival curve of time to death or delivery 
(primary obstetric outcome) showed that the differences 
between the progesterone and placebo groups appeared 
greatest at our prespecified gestational cutoff of 34 weeks 
(appendix).
Rates of preterm birth were higher in the predefined 
subgroups of women with a positive fetal fibronectin 
test, women with a cervical length of at most 25 mm, 
and women with a cervical length of at most 
15 mm (appendix). However, there were no significant 
interactions between these groups and the effect of 
progesterone on any of the obstetric, neonatal, or childhood 
outcomes. Within subgroups there was no significant 
effect of progesterone on any of the primary outcomes 
(table 3). However, caution is needed in interpreting all 
these findings given the number of prespecified subgroup 
analyses undertaken on three primary outcomes. 
Most of the other secondary outcomes did not differ 
statistically between progesterone and placebo groups 
(table 4). Although neurodevelopmental impairments 
were similarly distributed in each group, somatic 
impairments in renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory 
systems though of low frequency, were more common in 
the progesterone group. There were no apparent

Discussion
OPPTIMUM is the largest randomised trial of vaginal 
progesterone for prevention of preterm birth in women at 
high risk. By contrast with published reports,13–15 we show 
no effect of progesterone on rates of either preterm birth 
or neonatal composite outcome. For the first time using a 
direct assessment, we provide strong evidence that the 
use of progesterone from 22–24 to 34 gestational weeks 
has no demonstrable effect on 2 year neuro 
developmental 
outcomes, either as cognitive scores or impairments, 
suggesting that progesterone prophylaxis to prevent 
preterm birth appears safe for the baby (at least up to 
2 years of age). Only one previous study has determined 
long-term effects of progestogens given to singleton 
pregnancies in a randomised trial of intra 
muscular 
17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate,16,17 but this study used 
parent report and had a smaller sample size with a higher 
proportion lost to follow-up. The other published studies 
are restricted to questionnaire or health record-based 
assessments in twins whose mothers were enrolled in 
randomised trials of progesterone versus placebo.18,19
OPPTIMUM was a pragmatic trial, set up to examine 
effects of progesterone on outcomes in a heterogeneous 
group of women at risk of preterm birth. We extended 
our recruitment criteria early in the study, when newly 
available information suggested we were missing women 
at high risk of preterm birth. Notably, the fibronectin-
negative group recruited under the extended criteria, had 
rates of the primary outcome (death or preterm birth 
before 34 weeks) of 13% (appendix), some three times 
those of the background population of pregnant women 
in the UK.20 Hence, our decision to extend the recruitment 
criteria appears correct. Importantly, although we were 
able to define at baseline subgroups of women with 
higher rates of preterm birth (including those with a 
short cervix and those with a positive fibronectin test), 
our data suggest that the efficacy of progesterone (for all 
outcomes) is similar across groups. Therefore, our data 
do not support the premise that vaginal progesterone is 
specifically effective in women with a short cervix.
Although we showed no overall effect, point estimates 
of the reduction in the odds of the obstetric outcome 
(0·86) and the neonatal composite outcome (0·62) are in 
the direction of benefit, but with CIs that show no 
advantage. Additionally, point estimates in the short 
cervix subgroups are similar to those reported in meta-
analyses of the effect of progesterone in such women. 
For example, the OR for preterm birth prevention was 
0·69 in OPPTIMUM, compared with a RR of 0·64 
(before 34 weeks) in one systematic review 21 and a RR of 
0·58 (before 33 weeks) in an individual patient data 
meta-analysis.1 The corresponding figures for effects on a 
neonatal composite are OR 0·54 in OPPTIMUM and 
RR 0·57 in the individual patient data meta-analysis.1 An 
individual patient data meta-analysis, including the 
OPPTIMUM findings, to understand what the totality of 
evidence indicates, particularly within subgroups of 
interest, is likely to be helpful. 
 Although we have shown no significant effect on the 
overall neonatal composite outcome, there appeared to be 
a 
reduction 
in 
neonatal 
brain 
injury. 
Progesterone-associated 
reduction in brain injury is plausible given supportive 
preclinical data in adult models showing potentially 
neuroprotective effects of reduced inflammatory cytokine 
production, reduced activation of microglial cells, and 
limited apoptosis,22,23 although a recent trial of over 
1000 adult participants with traumatic brain injury has 
shown no clinical therapeutic effect.24 However, in the 
absence of long-term improvements in cognitive function, 
a protective effect of progesterone on brain injury (defined 
by ultrasound) might not be important clinically: not only 
was brain injury on ultrasound a relatively rare event in 
OPPTIMUM but other studies have shown no correlation 
between this finding and longer term neurosensory 
impairment.25 Additionally, these non-significant red-
uctions in the neonatal composite adverse outcome need

to be considered against the non-significant increase in the 
childhood adverse outcome of death or moderate-to-severe 
neurodevelopmental impairment.
OPPTIMUM strongly suggests that the efficacy of 
progesterone in improving outcomes is either non-
existent or weak. Given the heterogeneity of the preterm 
labour syndrome we cannot exclude benefit in specific 
phenotypic or genotypic subgroups of women at risk. 
However, the subgroups of women who might benefit do 
not appear to be easily identifiable by current selection 
strategies, including cervical length measurement and 
fibronectin testing. 
Reassuringly, our study suggests that progesterone is 
safe for those who wish to take it for preterm birth 
prophylaxis. The overall rate of maternal or child adverse 
events was similar in the progesterone and placebo groups. 
There were few differences in the incidence of adverse 
secondary outcomes in the two groups, with the exception 
of a higher rate of renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory 
complications in childhood in the progesterone groups. 
Importantly, the absolute rates of these complications was 
low. Follow-up of other babies exposed in utero to vaginal 
progesterone would be helpful in determining whether the 
increased rate of some renal, gastrointestinal, and 
respiratory complications is a real effect or a type I error. 
A potential weakness in our trial is that overall 
compliance was only 69%. This contrasts with a reported 
compliance of 88·5% in the study by Hassan and 
colleagues,13 but is greater than the compliance seen in 
routine clinical practice.26 Additionally, the assumption 
in the Hassan study that women who did not return 
study medication were fully compliant might have 
erroneously inflated their estimate of compliance. No 
information on compliance was reported in the other 
large study on vaginal progesterone in singletons.15 
Notably, in OPPTIMUM, the effect size for each of the 
primary outcomes was very similar in the per-protocol 
analysis (restricted to those with adequate treatment 
compliance) compared with the intention-to-treat group, 
suggesting that suboptimum compliance did not have a 
major effect on overall results. 
We believe that OPPTIMUM should prompt a major 
review of the use of progesterone for preterm birth 
prophylaxis, a search to identify specific women who 
might specifically benefit, and a redoubling of efforts to 
find alternative strategies to prevent preterm birth in 
women at risk. For those clinicians and women who 
wish still to use progesterone for preterm birth 
prophylaxis, our data provide reassurance that it appears 
safe, at least until 2 years of age of the child.
