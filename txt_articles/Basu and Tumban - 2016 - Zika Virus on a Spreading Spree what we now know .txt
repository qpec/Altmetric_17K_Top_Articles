Zika Virus on a Spreading Spree: what we
now know that was unknown in the 1950’s
Rupsa Basu and Ebenezer Tumban*
Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is transmitted through the bite of Aedes spp mosquitoes and less
predominantly, through sexual intercourse. Prior to 2007, ZIKV was associated with only sporadic human infections
with minimal or no clinical manifestations. Recently the virus has caused disease outbreaks from the Pacific Islands,
the Americas, and off the coast of West Africa with approximately 1.62 million people suspected to be infected in
more than 60 countries around the globe. The recent ZIKV outbreaks have been associated with guillain-barré
syndrome, congenital syndrome (microcephaly, congenital central nervous system anomalies), miscarriages, and
even death. This review summarizes the path of ZIKV outbreak within the last decade, highlights three novel modes
of ZIKV transmission associated with recent outbreaks, and points to the hallmarks of congenital syndrome. The
review concludes with a summary of challenges facing ZIKV research especially the control of ZIKV infection in the
wake of most recent data showing that anti-dengue virus antibodies enhance ZIKV infection.
Keywords: Zika virus, Sexual transmission, Neurological development, Microcephaly, Antibody-dependent
enhancement
Highlights
� ZIKV can be transmitted sexually and during
pregnancy from a mother to her fetus.
� In addition to microcephaly, ZIKV causes
miscarriage.
� ZIKV persists in whole blood for close to 2 months.
� Dengue viral infections enhance ZIKV infections.
� Anti-ZIKV antibodies in domestic animals suggest
that ZIKV can infect domestic animals.
Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA
virus in the genus Flavivirus. The virus is related to other
flaviviruses (dengue viruses-DENVs, yellow fever virus-
YFV, Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis
virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus,
Langat virus, Powassan virus, Modoc virus, Rio Bravo
virus) in terms of genome size and genome organization
[1, 2] (Fig. 1). The genome is ~10.7 kb in length and codes
for a single polyprotein (~10.2 kb), which is processed into
three structural proteins (Capsid-C, pre-Membrane/
Membrane-prM/M and Envelope-E) and seven non-
structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A,
NS4B, and NS5) (Fig. 1). The genome is flanked by the
5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) [1, 3, 4]. ZIKV
has been associated with a lot of disease outbreaks
within the last decade. With this in consideration, we
searched
peer-reviewed
articles,
government
news
briefings in Associated Press, and press releases by
international organizations for information related to
ZIKV. We searched specifically for ZIKV isolation, what
was known when the virus was first isolated (clinical mani-
festations), modes of transmission, the vectors that can
transmit the virus, disease outbreaks especially from 2007,
and the clinical/pathological manifestations observed in
recent outbreaks. The information gathered from these
searches was then used to write this review, which
summarizes incidences & global distribution of ZIKV
infection (within the last decade), modes of transmis-
sion, and challenges associated with ZIKV research.
Epidemiology
Although ZIKV is closely related to other flaviviruses in
terms of genome size and genome organization, the

 virus is most closely related to DENVs and YFV in terms
of mosquito vector transmission. ZIKV is a mosquito-
borne virus that is transmitted primarily through the
bite of Aedes spp mosquitoes. The virus was first isolated
in 1947 from monkeys in Zika forest in Uganda, Africa
[5]. Since then, the virus has been isolated from other
Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus,
Aedes africanus, Aedes hensilli, Aedes polynesiensis,
Aedes furcifer, Aedes vitattus) [6] and more recently
from a domestic mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus [7].
In sylvatic habitats, ZIKV is transmitted in an enzootic
cycle between non-human primates by mosquitoes. In
an epidemic cycle, the virus is transmitted between
humans primarily by infected mosquitoes [5, 8, 9]
(Fig. 2). Introduction of the virus to a human commu-
nity may be initiated by a spillover mosquito from syl-
vatic habitats; alternatively, the virus may be imported
by humans from countries with ZIKV breakout. Anti-
bodies against ZIKV have been detected in domestic
animals such as goats, sheep, rodents [10] but it is
unknown whether mosquitoes can transmit the virus
between domestic animals or between domestic animals
and humans.
Phylogenetically, ZIKV can be divided into two main
lineages—African
and
Asian—based
on
geographic
origin. The African lineage is further sub-divided into
West and East African sub-lineages [11]. ZIKV has been
associated with a number of sporadic human infections,
based on the detection of anti-ZIKV antibodies in
serum, starting from 1952 in Africa [12] and 1954 in
Asia [13]. In 2007, the virus caused the first major out-
break in the Pacific Islands [14], which later spread to
other countries.
a) ZIKV outbreak path since 2007
From 2007, ZIKV outbreaks have been reported in
many islands and continents as follows:
i) Pacific Islands: In 2007, a ZIKV outbreak from
autochthonous transmission was reported in Yap
Island in the Federated States of Micronesia with
185 people infected (includes confirmed, probable,
and suspected cases) [14]. This outbreak was
caused by the Asian lineage of ZIKV. Six years
later (in 2013), another outbreak was reported
~5000 miles from Yap Island, in French Polynesia
(Fig. 3); more than 28,000 people were infected

nucleotides and ~428 nucleotides , respectively
Fig. 2 ZIKV transmission cycles. ZIKV is transmitted in sylvatic habitats in an enzootic cycle by infected mosquitoes to rhesus monkeys and vice
versa. Humans can be infected with the virus in sylvatic habitats following a mosquito bite or if there is a spillover of an infected mosquito from
sylvatic habitats (middle dotted black line) to rural/urban areas. An epidemic cycle starts when humans are bitten by an infected mosquito
followed by viral replication in humans and viremia. The virus can spread to the reproductive organs and can be transmitted during sexual
intercourse. Infected pregnant women can also transmit the virus to the fetus during pregnancy. The virus can then be transmitted from an
infected person back to mosquitoes through mosquito bites. The virus then replicates in mosquitoes and it is transmitted back to humans and
the cycle continues. It is not known whether the virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes between domestic animals and humans (right dotted
gray lines with question mark) or whether the virus can be transmitted sexually between monkeys (left dotted gray line with question mark)

 with ZIKV in this outbreak [15, 16]. The ZIKV
strain in the French Polynesia outbreak had
99.9 % nucleotide and amino acid identities with
the Asian strain outbreak in the Yap Island
[1, 3, 15] suggesting that the French Polynesia
outbreak originated from Yap Island. Given the
distance between the two Islands, it is unlikely
that the virus was introduced into French
Polynesia my mosquitoes; this suggests that ZIKV
was imported into French Polynesia. The French
Polynesia outbreak was subsequently spread to
other Pacific Islands. Towards the end of 2013,
imported cases from French Polynesia were
reported in New Caledonia and cases of
autochthonous transmission were reported in
January 2014 [17, 18] (Fig. 3). At the same time
in January, an outbreak was reported in Easter
Island, off the coast of Chile [19] and in
February, another outbreak was reported in Cook
Islands [17, 18], (Fig. 3). The nucleotide sequence
of the ZIKV strain in Easter Island was 99.9 %
identical to the ZIKV strain in the outbreak in
French Polynesia, thus suggesting that the Easter
Island outbreak originated from French Polynesia.
Then in March 2015, first cases of ZIKV outbreak
(from autochthonous transmission) were reported
in Bahia, Brazil. Nucleotide sequence analysis
from this outbreak showed 99 % identity with the
ZIKV strain that caused the 2013 outbreak in
French Polynesia [20] thus suggesting that ZIKV
was introduced to the Americas from any of the
Pacific Islands (French Polynesia, New Caledonia,
Easter Island, or Cook Islands). It is likely that
the outbreaks in almost all these islands including
the one in Brazil were first imported to these
islands/country by an infected individual(s), who
later served as reservoir host(s) for mosquito
transmission to naïve individuals; ZIKV vectors
are endemic in the Pacific Islands and in Brazil
[21, 22]. Alternatively, the virus could have been
transmitted sexually from an infected traveler to a
naïve person in any of these countries.
ii) The Americas: The first cases of ZIKV outbreak in
Latin America were reported in Brazil (March 2015).
Since then, more than 1.5 million people are
estimated to have been infected in Brazil alone [23].
Mosquito-transmitted cases of the virus have been
reported throughout the Americas (except Canada
and Chile) [23–26], as predicted by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO) (Fig. 4), with more
than 65,000 confirmed and suspected cases reported
in Colombia alone [27]. Although the number of
cases are decreasing in most countries in the
Pacific Islands
Fig. 3 ZIKV outbreaks and transmission paths in the Pacific Islands. The first ZIKV outbreak in the Islands was reported in Yap Island in Micronesia
(2007) and it was later transmitted (indicated as red arrow number 1) to French Polynesia in 2013. From French Polynesia, the virus was then
transmitted to New Caledonia, Easter Island, and to Cook Island (in the order listed and indicated as red arrow numbers 2, 3, 4)
Basu and Tumban Virology Journal  (2016) 13:165 
Page 3 of 9
 Americas and the Caribbean [28], the number of
mosquito-transmitted cases are increasing in some
countries. For example, as of mid September, more
than 85 cases of autochthonous transmissions have
been reported in the State of Florida in continental
United States [29]. Furthermore, the number of
ZIKV imported and sexually transmitted cases
continue to increase; more than 3130 imported
cases (numbers correct as of mid September) have
been reported in the continental United States
since the outbreak started in Brazil [30] (Fig. 4). In
Cuba, the number of imported cases increased from
1 case in March to 33 cases (3 local transmissions)
as of mid September [31]. In summary, an estimated
1.6 million people are suspected to be infected in the
Americas.
iii)Off the cost of West Africa, Cape Verde: ZIKV
outbreak has also been reported in the Islands of
Cape Verde, off the coast of West Africa. The first
ZIKV cases in the Islands were reported in late
September to mid October of 2015 and as of August
2016, more than 7550 people were already infected
[32] (Fig. 4). The genetic sequence of the ZIKV
strain in Cape Verde has recently been determined
and it is identical to the Asian strain in the outbreak
in Brazil [32]. The virus was likely imported into the
Islands from Brazil by traveler(s) and it was
subsequently transmitted from the traveler(s) to
naïve individuals through mosquito bites or
through sexual contact. Brazil and Cape Verde are
close countries (distance-wise) that speak the
same language (Portuguese), share almost the
same culture and as such, their citizens travel
frequently between the two countries. This made
it very easy for an asymptomatic ZIKV-infected
individual to carry the virus from one country to
the other.
It is worth mentioning that since the 2015 outbreak
in Brazil, imported cases of ZIKV by travelers from
countries with outbreaks have been reported all over
the world.
b) Imported cases around the world:
In North America, the number of ZIKV imported
cases from Latin America continue to increase. As of
mid September 2016, the number of imported ZIKV
infections reported in Canada were more than 279 [33]
(Fig. 4). The number of imported cases are also increas-
ing in Europe; the number of imported cases increased
from 224 in March 2016 to 1265 cases in August 2016.
The highest number of imported cases have been re-
ported in France and Spain [34]. In Eurasia/Asia, 6

Fig. 4 Autochthonous and imported cases of ZIKV around the world from 2015. ZIKV was first introduced to the Americas (Brazil) from the Pacific
Island (indicated as red dotted circle with red arrow). From Brazil, the virus then spread to countries in South America, Central America, the
Caribbean, and off the cost of West Africa (Cape Verde). Countries with only imported ZIKV cases, from the Americas, are shown in purple color.
Countries with both mosquito-transmitted and imported cases are shown in different colors with an estimated number of suspected ZIKV cases
in the respective countries. Countries with white colors have not reported any imported cases since 2015 (numbers correct as of September)

Page 4 of 9
 imported cases have been reported in Russia and more
than 21 cases have been reported in China [35, 36]. In
Singapore and Thailand, more than 300 and 200 cases
have been reported, respectively (numbers correct as of
mid September) [37]. In Africa, 1 imported case from
Columbia has been reported in South Africa [38]. In-
between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, 12 and >44
imported cases have been reported in Hawaii [30] and
Australia [39], respectively. Thus, the virus has been
imported to at least one country in every continent
except Antarctica, making this the first ZIKV pandemic
the world has ever experienced.
Transmission
ZIKV was believed (until less than a decade ago) to be
transmitted to humans only through the bites of Aedes
spp mosquitoes. Recently, other modes of human trans-
mission have been documented as follows:
i) Sexual transmission. ZIKV has been detected in the
urine and semen of ZIKV-infected patients [40, 41]
with more than 30 cases of sexual transmission from
male to female, 1 case from male to male and 1 from
female to a male have been reported [42–47].
This observation shows that the virus can be
transmitted between both sexes but the highest
frequency of transmission is from male to
female.
ii) Vertical transmission from mother to fetus. ZIKV has
been detected in amniotic fluid, fetal brain, and also
in the serum of babies, 4 days after birth [48–51],
thus demonstrating that the virus can be
transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy (Fig. 2).
iii)Blood transfusion. Two cases of ZIKV transmission
by blood transfusion have been reported in Brazil
[52]. This observation will make ZIKV transmission
more complicated given the fact that a majority of
ZIKV-infected patients do not show symptoms; in
fact, 3 % of ZIKV asymptomatic blood donors
have tested positive for ZIKV [53]. This makes it
very easy for the virus to be transmitted from
blood donors to blood recipients. The situation is
also exacerbated by the fact that the virus can
persists in whole blood of patients for close to
2 months [46, 54].
Clinical manifestations
When anti-ZIKV antibodies were first detected in hu-
man sera in the early 1950s, the authors pointed out
that “The effects of this agent in man are quite un-
known” [13]. The reason they made this statement was
due to the fact that the population sampled at that
time did not show any clinical or pathological manifes-
tations, that could be associated with ZIKV infection.
As mentioned above, most people infected with ZIKV
are asymptomatic. However, 20–25 % of infected
patients develop symptoms such as fever, skin rash,
joint
pains,
headache,
and
conjunctivitis
within
1 week after infection; in addition to this, some
patients
experience
hematospermia
[43,
46,
55].
Although ZIKV infection is not life threatening in
healthy adults, the virus can cause the following de-
bilitating conditions:
i) Neurological problems such as guillain-barré
syndrome (GBS; an autoimmune disease) [56].
Ninety-eight to a hundred % of patients diagnosed
with GBS during the French Polynesia ZIKV
outbreak had anti-ZIKV antibodies, compared to
56 % of patients without GBS [57]. The mechanism(s)
underlying the contribution of these anti-ZIKV
antibodies to GBS is still unknown.
ii) Miscarriage and congenital syndrome such as
microcephaly (a neurodevelopmental disorder
whereby babies are born with an abnormally
small head) or an abnormally developed
congenital central nervous system [48, 56, 58, 59].
ZIKV infects a population of developing brain
cells including embryonic forebrain-specific
human neural progenitor cells, neurospheres
and brain organoids thus causing increased cell
death, cell cycle dysregulation and ultimately
reduced cell growth [60, 61]. These developmental
changes are probably the hallmarks of congenital
syndrome. In fact, these observations may explain
the reason behind the increase in the number of
congenital syndrome cases reported in ZIKV-
infected countries in the Americas and Cape Verde;
more than 16 countries have reported cases of
ZIKV-related congenital syndrome (Fig. 5). In
Brazil alone, 1911 cases have been confirmed
with 371 neonatal deaths reported; in Columbia
and Cape Verde, 40 and 14 cases, respectively, of
ZIKV-related congenital syndrome have also been
reported (numbers correct as of September) [31, 62].
Additionally, cases of ZIKV-related miscarriages have
been reported in other countries [51, 59]. These
devastating effects have prompted many countries
to advise pregnant women to avoid visiting
regions (most recently, Florida in the US,
Singapore and Thailand in Asia) with ZIKV
outbreaks [42, 63]. Overall, ZIKV infection
seems to have the highest morbidity in newborn
infants.
Challenges associated with ZIKV infections
i) There are no vaccines to protect against ZIKV
infection or drugs to treat infected patients. The
majority of ZIKV infected patients recover from the
infection and do not need treatment. However, as
Basu and Tumban Virology Journal  (2016) 13:165 
Page 5 of 9
 mentioned above, transmission of the virus from
pregnant women to fetuses affects normal fetal
neurological developments. As such, women,
especially those who plan to be become pregnant,
need to be immunized. Thus, there is an urgent
need to develop a vaccine to stop the spread of
ZIKV infection, especially from pregnant women to
fetuses. The development of an effective ZIKV
vaccine will be challenging for the following reasons:
a) although 9 % of anti-dengue virus monoclonal
antibodies can cross-neutralize ZIKV infections,
a majority of anti-dengue virus antibodies are
not neutralizing [64]; instead, they enhance
ZIKV and dengue viral infections, a condition
known as antibody-dependent enhancement of
infection [65, 66]. This observation may
complicate ZIKV infections in countries were
ZIKV and dengue viral infections co-circulate
and especially in countries (Brazil, Mexico, El
Salvador, and the Philippines) where dengue
virus vaccine (dengvaxia) has been licensed; the
effect of the vaccine on ZIKV infection needs
to be evaluated. With this in mind, an ideal
ZIKV vaccine should not enhance dengue
infection and vice versa.
b) a candidate ZIKV vaccine should protect
against all ZIKV strains. Additionally, it should
lack the propensity to be accidentally
transmitted by mosquitoes from vaccinees to
unvaccinated population. This will be a big
challenge for an attenuated ZIKV vaccine given
the fact that the virus is transmitted by
mosquito-bites.
c) the vaccine should be safe in pregnant women
in order to avoid complications during
pregnancy.
d) an effective ZIKV vaccine should elicit a systemic
immune response in addition to genital immunity
given the fact that the virus can also be
transmitted sexually. A ZIKV vaccine that cannot
protect against sexual transmission may not be
highly valuable.
ii) ZIKV is transmitted by some of the same Aedes
mosquitoes (e.g. Aedes aegypti) that transmit DENVs,
YFV, and Chikungunya virus (an alphavirus) [18,
67]. To aggravate the situation, the symptoms (fever,
skin rash, joint pains, and headache) for ZIKV
infection are similar to those caused by these three
viruses. As such, most ZIKV infections are clinically
misdiagnosed as DENV infections.

related congenital syndrome

ZIKV-related congenital syndrome cases have been reported in Brazil, Colombia, Cape Verde, Martinique, Panama, El Salvador, Paraguay, French
Guiana, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United States, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Suriname
Basu and Tumban Virology Journal  (2016) 13:165 
Page 6 of 9
 iii)Serological tests for ZIKV targeting the envelope
glycoprotein domains, EI and EII, are not specific;
they cross-react with other flaviviruses such as
DENVs and YFV [1, 4, 65, 68]. These domain-
cross-reactive antibodies can misdiagnose ZIKV
infections as dengue and vice versa.
iv) ZIKV RNA/viral particles have been isolated or
detected in nasopharynx [69], saliva [49, 70, 71], and
in breast milk [49]. Nevertheless, it is not known if
the virus can be transmitted through saliva, nasal
secretions, or breast milk. Moreover, it is unknown
if anti-ZIKV antibodies are present in these secre-
tions. Studies are needed to assess if the virus can be
transmitted through these routes and if anti-ZIKV
antibodies are present in body secretions such as
saliva and breast milk.
v) Although ZIKV RNA and viral particles have been
isolated from saliva, non-invasive methods using
saliva to diagnose ZIKV are lacking. As such, there
is need for rapid diagnostic kits for detecting ZIKV
infection using saliva.
vi) Although we know that ZIKV can be transmitted
sexually from male to female, male to male, and
female to male, there has been no report on
transmission from female to female couples.
Studies are required to assess transmission
between female-sex partners.
vii)Recent isolation of ZIKV infection from Culex
quinquefasciatus mosquitoes [7] may also make the
control of ZIKV infection challenging. Culex
quinquefasciatus just like Aedes mosquitoes is a
domesticated mosquito that breeds in standing
water, is widespread in the Americas (except
Canada), Africa, Asia, the United Kingdom, and
Pacific Islands [72], and feeds on humans, domestic
animals, including birds [73]. Thus, measures to
control Aedes mosquitoes also have to take the
control of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes into
consideration.
viii)It is unknown why some patients (65 %) with
anti-ZIKV antibodies do not develop GBS whereas
some patients do. Does the genetic make-up of an
individual pre-dispose that individual to ZIKV-
associated GBS or microcephaly?
Conclusions
ZIKV infection is a major public health problem that
has already spread to many countries around the globe,
and is likely to spread to more given the fact that the
virus can be transmitted sexually and by mosquitoes to
humans. Imported ZIKV by asymptomatic travelers will
likely be transmitted to sexual partners thus increasing the
number of infected people and consequently the availabil-
ity of ZIKV-infected blood meal for naïve mosquitoes. A
blood meal from infected patients, following a mosquito
bite, will be all it takes to establish an outbreak in coun-
tries with imported cases, as has been demonstrated in
the United States. This observation puts China, Singapore,
Thailand and Europe, which all have Aedes aegypti and
Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, at high risk for mosquito
transmission given the fact that ZIKV has already been
imported to these regions [21, 22, 37]. An infected
mosquito in any of these regions can cross, irrespective
of country borders, from one country to another thus
increasing the spread of the virus. It is also likely that
people moving across country borders will spread the
virus to other countries.
We now know, unlike in the 1950s, that ZIKV cannot
only be transmitted through mosquito bites; it can also be
transmitted sexually, via blood transfusion, and from
mother to fetus. We also know that the virus is associated
with symptoms such as joint pains, skin rash, and that it
causes neurological problems such as GBS, microcephaly
and abnormally developed congenital central nervous
system. Nevertheless, there are a lot of things we still do
not know about ZIKV; we do not know whether the virus
can be transmitted through nasal secretions, saliva or
breast milk. Also, there are still unanswered questions as
to why the outbreak in Brazil spread to almost all of the
Americas and why this outbreak had a higher mortality
and morbidity compared to sporadic outbreaks prior to
2007. With these in consideration, there is an urgent
need to develop vaccines and therapeutics to prevent or
stop the spread of ZIKV infections. In addition to this,
there is an urgent need to develop robust diagnostic
tests that can detect and discriminate ZIKV infections
from other flaviviruses (DENVs, Chikungunya, and YFV),
5 days after onset of symptoms. Fortunately, recent studies
have shown that antibodies targeting NS1 proteins are
ZIKV-specific and can be used to develop ZIKV-specific
diagnostic kits [65]. If an antigen diagnostic test targeting
ZIKV NS1 is successfully developed, it can be used to
diagnose ZIKV infections from the onset of viremia. In
fact, a ZIKV antigen diagnostic test will be more valuable
because they can detect ZIKV infections prior to the
appearance of anti-ZIKV antibodies in serum. Such a test
can be used along-side with a specific molecular test, such
as reverse transcription (RT) PCR, to confirm ZIKV infec-
tion. Until then, specific detection of ZIKV infections has
to rely on RT-PCR.
