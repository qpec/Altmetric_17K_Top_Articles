 Abstract
Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition with no approved therapies apart from avoidance and injectable epinephrine for 
treatment of acute allergic reactions. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an experimental treatment in which patients consume gradually increasing 
quantities of the food to which they are allergic in an attempt to induce some level of desensitization. While desensitization is possible in 
most patients, OIT carries significant risks for allergic reactions, and the ability to induce longer-term tolerance has not yet been established. 
This review focuses on selected studies of OIT for the treatment of common food allergies such as cow’s milk, hen’s egg, and peanut.

 Resumen
La alergia alimentaria es una condición potencialmente mortal para la que no existen tratamientos aprobados, excepto la evitación y la 
epinefrina para tratar reacciones alérgicas graves. La inmunoterapia oral (OIT) es un tratamiento experimental en el cual los pacientes 
ingieren cantidades gradualmente crecientes del alimento al que son alérgicos, con el fin de inducir algún nivel de desensibilización. Si 
bien la desensibilización es posible en la mayoría de los pacientes, OIT conlleva riesgos importantes de reacciones alérgicas y la capacidad 
de inducir tolerancia a más largo plazo todavía no ha sido establecida. Este artículo de revisión se centra en una selección de estudios de 
OIT para el tratamiento de alergias a alimentos comunes, como son la leche de vaca, huevos de gallina y cacahuete.

Introduction
Food allergy is now estimated to affect up to 8% of 
children and up to 2%-3% of adults in the United States of 
America [1,2], where cow’s milk, hen’s egg, peanut, tree 
nut, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish are the foods most often 
associated with food allergy [2]. Food allergy is potentially 
life-threatening and has a major impact on quality of 
life [3,4]. Avoidance is currently the only approved therapy, 
and, although effective, avoidance diets can be difficult and 
may also put children at risk of nutritional deficiencies and 
impaired growth [5,6]. While at least 80% of milk- and egg-
allergic children are expected to achieve natural tolerance to 
these foods by adulthood, only 15%-20% of peanut- or tree 
nut–allergic individuals “outgrow” their allergies [7]. Peanut 
allergy is common in developed countries, affecting 1%-2% of 
children in the United States of America [4,8], and peanut is 
implicated in over half of all food allergy–related deaths in the 
United States of America [9,10]. Effective therapies for peanut 
and other common food allergies are therefore highly desirable. 
What is Oral Immunotherapy? 
Oral immunotherapy (OIT) involves mixing an allergenic 
food into a vehicle and consuming it in gradually increasing 
doses [11]. OIT protocols vary in the type of food and vehicle 
used, with some using commercially available foods in their 
natural forms (eg, liquid milk or peanut flour), while others 
use specifically prepared products such as dehydrated egg 
white. Currently, although OIT essentially uses food materials, 
research studies in the United States of America require 
investigational new drug approval, and forms of therapy 
regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
require additional standards and safeguards. For example, 
allergenic proteins must be identified and quantified, and the 
product must be shown to be free of microbial contaminants.
Most OIT protocols include an initial escalation phase, 
followed by a dose build-up phase and maintenance 
phases, which may vary considerably depending on the 
study (Figure) [11]. The initial escalation phase is typically 
conducted over 1-2 days using rapid up-dosing, which starts 
from a very small dose (extremely unlikely to cause an adverse 
reaction) and progressing to a dose that is still likely safe 
for home administration. Generally, the initial doses are in 
microgram quantities of allergenic protein, which progress to 
several milligrams by the end of this phase. If well tolerated, 
the dose is escalated incrementally (usually biweekly or 
weekly) until a target maintenance dose is reached or the 
patient reaches dose-limiting symptoms. There is considerable 
variation between studies regarding the target maintenance 
dose, which ranges from 300 mg to 4000 mg. Maintenance 
therapy continues with daily administration in the home, and 
the length of maintenance therapy is heterogeneous, lasting 
from a few months to several years [12]. The Table illustrates 
some of the variability in study design in terms of maintenance 
dosing, length of therapy, and outcomes.
Efficacy of OIT
The potential efficacy of food OIT depends on the defined 
endpoints, including the ability to tolerate the treatment, the 
induction of a transient state of desensitization, and/or the 
development of a more durable state of clinical tolerance, 
which is often referred to as sustained unresponsiveness 
(SU) [13,14]. Desensitization is defined as a temporary 
increase in the threshold for reactivity, with maintenance of 
the desensitized state requiring continued consumption of the 
allergenic protein to prevent the reappearance of reactivity. In 
some trials, patients who are successfully desensitized are then 
required per protocol to restrict the allergenic food from their 
diet for a period of weeks to months, after which another oral 
food challenge is conducted to determine whether or not they 
have achieved SU. While all studies have demonstrated that 
the majority of patients treated with OIT can be successfully 
desensitized to a particular food, SU is less commonly 
achieved. This lack of sustained protection against allergic

immunotherapy and highlights the experimental nature of 
this treatment. 
Summary of Clinical Trials
Peanut OIT
The use of subcutaneous peanut immunotherapy was first 
reported in 1992, but this approach was abandoned owing 
to an unacceptable systemic reaction rate [15]. Following 
2 case reports of successful peanut OIT in 2006 [16,17], the 
first open-label trial of peanut OIT was published in 2009 in 
a prospective cohort study [18,19], which showed successful 
desensitization and an overall reassuring safety profile, as well 
as immunologic changes consistent with those seen in other 
forms of immunotherapy. With a maintenance dose of 1800 mg 
of peanut protein, 93% of the 29 patients who completed 
the protocol were able to tolerate an oral challenge with a 
cumulative dose of 3.9 g of peanut protein at 36 months [18]. 
In 2010, Blumchen et al [20] reported results for 23 children 
maintained on 500 mg of peanut protein daily over a 9-week 
period, with a 60% success rate for passing an oral food 
challenge at the completion of treatment.

In 2011, Varshney et al [21] reported the first multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of peanut 
OIT. The study included 28 patients aged 1 through 16 who 
underwent treatment with peanut or placebo with a daily 
maintenance dose of 4 g for about 1 year. Three patients 
withdrew early owing to adverse reactions; however, in a 
posttreatment double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge 
(DBPCFC), the 16 patients who completed active OIT were 
able to ingest a maximum cumulative dose of 5 g of peanut 
protein (~16 peanuts) compared with the placebo group of 
9 patients, who tolerated a median of 280 mg. The study 
also showed a significant decrease in skin test responses, 
as well as changes in serum IL-5 and IL-13 levels and 
CD4
+CD25
+FoxP3
+ regulatory T cells in the active group 
compared with the placebo group. 
In 2011, Anagnostou et al [22] reported results from a 
prospective cohort study of peanut OIT, in which 22 children 
received a daily maintenance dose of 800 mg of peanut protein 
for 32 weeks. The authors demonstrated a significant increase 
in the peanut challenge threshold, with 86% of patients 
tolerating up-dosing and 14/22 (64%) tolerating 6.6 g of peanut 
protein at the completion of treatment. In 2014, the same group 
completed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with peanut 
OIT at a maintenance dose of 800 mg [23]. In the first phase, 
each arm underwent 26 weeks of peanut OIT versus peanut 
avoidance, after which patients underwent a food challenge 
to 1400 mg of peanut protein. In the active OIT group, 
24 of 39 participants (62%) had no reaction compared with no 
participants in the control group. The second phase allowed 
participants in the control group to receive active peanut OIT, 
with 84% of the active group at the end of the first phase and 
91% of the control group at the end of the second phase able 
to tolerate daily ingestion of 800 mg protein for 26 weeks. 
The first study of SU following peanut OIT was published 
in 2014 [14]. Twenty-four patients aged 1 to 16 years 
completed OIT with maintenance dosing of 4000 mg of 
peanut protein for up to 5 years. One month after stopping 
OIT, 50% of the patients demonstrated SU to a 5000-mg oral 
challenge. Patients demonstrating SU were also found to have 
greater evidence of immunomodulation, with smaller wheals, 
lower peanut IgE levels, including Ara h 1 and Ara h 2, and 
lower ratios of peanut-specific IgE/total IgE. In another study 
that was designed primarily to compare peanut sublingual 
immunotherapy (SLIT) with OIT, while OIT was far superior to 
SLIT, only 4 of 20 patients on OIT were shown to have SU [24].
In a more recent open-label RCT analyzing peanut OIT in a 
population aged 9 to 36 months [25], patients were randomized to 
goal maintenance doses of 300 mg/d or 3000 mg/d. In the intent-
to-treat analysis, 29 of 37 patients (78%) achieved SU 4 weeks 
after completing treatment, with similar rates in the 300-mg group 
(85%) and the 3000-mg group (71%) after a median treatment 
period of 29 months. Per protocol, 29 of 32 patients (91%) 
achieved SU. It was also reassuring that the therapy was well 
tolerated, even in children of such a young age.
Egg OIT
Two early studies from Patriarca et al [26,27] reported on 
small numbers of patients treated with egg OIT, demonstrating 
successful desensitization in most patients. In another early 
trial, Buchanan et al [28] reported on 7 children aged 14 months 
to 7 years who received 24 months of egg OIT at a maintenance 
dose of 300 mg of daily, with 57% passing an oral food 
challenge at completion of treatment. In a follow-up study at 
the same center, patients treated with a higher, individualized 
dose (median 2400 mg) for a median of 33 months had an 
SU rate of 75% (6 of 8 patients) 1 month after stopping 
treatment [29]. 
In one of the first randomized OIT trials, Staden et al [30] 
reported on 45 children who were treated with either egg 
or milk OIT, with maintenance dosing of 1.6 g/d or 3.5 g/d, 
respectively, or an avoidance diet as a control. Eleven of the 
patients were egg-allergic. Although the milk and egg results 
were not reported separately, after a median of 21 months of 
therapy, 16/25 (64%) were able to introduce the allergenic food 
into their diet, 9 with complete tolerance and 7 with partial 
tolerance, compared with 7 of 20 children (35%) in the control 
group. Morisset et al [31] also published a randomized study of 
60 children with milk allergy and 90 children with egg allergy. 
Patients were randomized to OIT or allergen avoidance, and 
after 6 months of treatment, 69% of those receiving egg OIT 
were successfully desensitized. 
In 2012, Burks et al [13] reported results from the first 
multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trial of egg OIT in which 55 patients aged 5-11 years were 
treated with a maintenance dose of 2 g of egg protein, with 
egg DBPCFCs performed at 10 and 22 months. For those who 
did not experience a reaction at the 22-month challenge, OIT 
was discontinued for 6-8 weeks with a repeat food challenge 
to test for SU. At the 10-month DBPCFC, none of the placebo 
patients (n=15) were desensitized compared with 55% of 
those treated with active OIT. After 22 months of OIT, 30 
of 40 patients (75%) were effectively desensitized, but only 
11 (28%) demonstrated SU on rechallenge 6 to 8 weeks later. 
Other studies of egg OIT included the small RCTs by Dello 
Iacono et al and Meglio et al, who reported desensitization 
rates of 80%-90% in children with severe egg allergy, and 2 
studies using rush protocols with desensitization induced in 
as few as 5 days [32-35]. 
Milk OIT
As with egg, Patriarca et al [26,27] performed 2 small-
scale trials and reported the first studies on milk OIT, with 
desensitization rates of 65.5% and 100%. In 2004, Meglio 
et al [36] performed a pilot study of 21 children treated 
with 6 months of OIT that resulted in a 72% success rate of 
tolerating a target dose of 200 mL of cow’s milk daily, with an 
additional 14% of patients achieving partial desensitization. Of 
note, after a 4-year follow up, 70% at least partially tolerated 
milk, with significant reductions in serum-specific cow’s 
milk IgE and skin prick test results [37]. A number of other 
nonrandomized milk OIT studies also demonstrated overall 
success in achieving desensitization [38-40].
As noted above for egg OIT, the first RCT of milk OIT was 
reported by Staden et al [30]. In 2008, Longo et al [41] reported 
an RCT of 60 children with a history of severe cow’s milk 
allergy and high CM-specific IgE levels who were randomized 
to milk OIT or avoidance. While all those in the control group 
failed the DBPCFC at the 1-year mark, 36% of treated patients

passed the OFC and an additional 54% were partially tolerant. 
The year 2008 also marked the first placebo-controlled OIT trial 
in a study of milk OIT by Skripak et al [42], who demonstrated 
a rise in the median milk challenge threshold from 40 mg at 
baseline to 5140 mg after just 3-4 months of treatment, with 
no change in the placebo group. An open-label follow-up study 
based on individualized, ongoing milk intake demonstrated the 
ability to tolerate from 1000 mg to 16 000 mg (median 7000 
with 33% tolerating 16 000 mg) of cow’s milk protein over 3 
to 17 months of follow-up [43]. 
Other studies of milk OIT included those of Pajno et al [44] in 
2010, as well as a study from the same group in 2013 suggesting 
that maintenance dosing after desensitization is equally successful 
daily or twice weekly [45]. In 2011, Martorell et al [46] completed 
an RCT of 60 children aged 24 to 36 months and demonstrated 
desensitization in 90% at 1 year. In 2012, Salmivesi et al [47] 
reported the results of an RCT in school-aged children, showing 
similar effectiveness for milk OIT. 
In 2012, Keet et al [48] also published an open-label RCT 
comparing milk OIT with SLIT. All patients were initially 
treated with SLIT, after which they were randomized to 
continue SLIT or switch to OIT. The study demonstrated 
greater efficacy with OIT, as well as a higher incidence of 
significant adverse effects. The study also examined SU after 
stopping therapy for 1 and 6 weeks, showing that only 40% 
of patients passed an OFC when treatment was discontinued 
for 6 weeks and that 2 lost protection in the first week off
 
therapy. An additional follow-up report on 32 patients from 
the study by Keet et al [49] on milk OIT showed that only 31% 
of patients appeared to be fully milk-tolerant 3 to 5 years after 
completing treatment, with many patients appearing to lose 
tolerance after successfully completing treatment, even some 
with demonstrated SU.
Over the past decade, many patients with milk allergy have 
been shown to tolerate milk that has been extensively heated; 
in addition, this exposure helps to promote eventual tolerance 
to unheated milk [50]. A recent study by Goldberg et al [51] 
sought to use this concept in patients who had been unable 
to tolerate milk OIT and were treated with OIT using baked 
milk. Unfortunately, in this highly select group of patients with 
severe milk allergy, only 3 of 14 achieved the primary outcome 
of tolerating 1.3 g of baked milk. Of the 11 treatment failures, 
8 failed because of IgE-mediated reactions, and 3 did not 
complete the program because of non–IgE-mediated factors. 
OIT to Other Foods and Multiallergen OIT
While most research to date has focused on milk, egg, and 
peanut, there is great interest in the potential to treat other 
common food allergies. Studies are currently ongoing using 
OIT to treat allergy to wheat, tree nut, fish, and possibly other 
food allergens. A recent study by Sato et al [52] investigated 
the efficacy of OIT in patients with wheat-induced anaphylaxis. 
The treatment was open-label with a historical control group of 
untreated patients, and the dose was 200 g of Japanese wheat 
noodles that contained 5.2 g of wheat protein. The target dose 
was achieved by 16 of the 18 patients, 11 of whom (61.1%) 
passed an OFC to assess SU 2 weeks later. The authors 
concluded that even in patients with very severe wheat allergy, 
OIT using boiled noodles was safe and effective [53]. 
There is also interest in the potential to treat multiple food 
allergies simultaneously, since so many children are allergic 
to more than 1 food. Numerous OIT studies with multiple 
food allergens are currently underway, some with and some 
without coadministration of omalizumab. To date, preliminary 
data from one study demonstrated similar reaction rates and 
efficacy comparing monotherapy with peanut to OIT based on 
up to 5 foods [54], while a second Phase 1 study demonstrated 
successful desensitization to multiple foods using rush OIT 
after pretreatment with omalizumab. Reaction rates were 
relatively low (median of 3.2 reactions per 100 doses) [55].
Immunologic Changes With OIT
The mechanisms by which OIT induces desensitization, 
and possibly longer-term effects, remain under active 
investigation. Studies have consistently demonstrated specific 
immunologic changes, including increases in food-specific 
IgG4 and decreased basophil and mast cell responsiveness 
[13,14,18,56]. Some studies have shown alterations in the 
binding pattern of antigen to antigen-specific IgE, either by 
reduction in the diversity of epitope recognition or altered 
IgE affinity [57]. After 6-12 months of OIT, there appears 
to be a shift away from TH2 cytokine production towards 
a proinflammatory profile characterized by increased 
production of IL-1β and TNF-α [18]. Syed et al demonstrated 
increased function of antigen-specific CD4
+CD25
+FoxP3
+ 
regulatory T cells following OIT, thus supporting the theory 
of active suppression of immune responses [56,58]. 
Gorelik et al [59] studied the mechanisms and duration of 
suppression of immune responses during peanut immunotherapy 
reported in the study by Narisety et al [60] and found that 
spontaneous and allergen-induced basophil reactivity, including 
IL-4 production, were suppressed during dose escalation 
and after 6 months of maintenance dosing. Many markers 
of immunologic suppression reversed after withdrawal of 
immunotherapy and, more surprisingly, in some cases during 
ongoing maintenance therapy. The authors concluded that while 
both peanut OIT and SLIT induce rapid suppression of basophil 
effector functions, dendritic cell activation, and TH2 cytokine 
responses during the initial phases of immunotherapy, in many 
patients suppression appeared to be transient.
Begin et al [61] addressed changes in allergen-specific T-cell 
phenotypes during immunotherapy. While prior studies have 
shown an overall skewing of the pathological TH2 response toward 
a normal TH1 or regulatory T-cell response, questions have been 
raised about the specificity of this approach and whether these 
changes result from a reprogramming of existing allergen-specific 
clones (re-education hypothesis) or from their replacement by 
different clones to determine the dominant response (replacement 
hypothesis). The authors undertook next-generation sequencing 
of peanut-proliferative TCRβ in patients undergoing peanut OIT 
and found an extremely diversified polyclonal response with a 
very small fraction of consistent clones over time. 
Safety of OIT 
Adverse reactions are very common in OIT, with rates that 
are similar for each of the foods studied to date. Reactions are

generally mild, and local symptoms such as oral itching are 
most common. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom 
leading to withdrawal from treatment, and moderate reactions 
such as wheezing, vomiting, and urticaria occur in a small 
percentage of cases. However, given that doses are given 
daily over an extended period of treatment, the risk for each 
patient is substantial. For example, in a study of milk OIT 
in young children, 47% developed moderate reactions over 
the course of treatment [46]. More severe reactions requiring 
treatment with epinephrine and ß-agonists are most common 
during dose escalation but can also occur during maintenance 
therapy [24,41,42,44,46]. Wasserman et al [62] reported that 
95 reactions requiring epinephrine occurred during peanut OIT 
in 352 patients. It is especially concerning that most severe 
reactions occur unpredictably, with a dose that has previously 
been tolerated, and that they are often associated with cofactors 
such as infection, exercise, anxiety, or allergen coexposure 
[19,23,42,43].
A major impediment to moving these treatments to clinical 
practice is the high percentage of patients who cannot tolerate 
OIT. Overall, 10%-20% of patients drop out of OIT trials, with 
rates as high as 36%. While some participants withdraw owing 
to anaphylaxis or other acute reactions, the vast majority of 
withdrawals are due to chronic abdominal pain. Eosinophilic 
esophagitis has been documented in some of these cases, 
and it is not clear how frequently undiagnosed disease may 
complicate OIT [63,64]. Further studies aimed at minimizing 
adverse reactions are therefore critically important if these 
treatments are to be moved forward for use in clinical practice.
Adjunctive Therapies
Several potential adjunctive therapies to OIT have been 
studied, with the goal of improving both safety and efficacy. 
Two initial pilot studies have examined the use omalizumab 
in combination with OIT, one with milk and the other with 
peanut [65,66]. In both cases, it is suggested that OIT can be 
escalated more rapidly when combined with omalizumab, 
although adverse reactions are still relatively common. 
Two more recent RCTs also studied the adjunctive effects 
of omalizumab. In the first, Wood et al [67] studied the addition 
of omalizumab or placebo to open-label milk OIT. At the 
completion of treatment, 88.9% of the omalizumab-treated 
patients and 71.4% of the placebo-treated patients passed the 
10-g "desensitization" OFC (P=.18). Two months later, SU 
was demonstrated in 48.1% in the omalizumab group and 
35.7% in the placebo group (P=.42). Adverse reactions were 
significantly reduced during OIT escalation in omalizumab-
treated patients with regard to the percentage of doses with 
symptoms (2.1% vs 16.1%, P=.0005), dose-related reactions 
requiring treatment (0.0% vs 3.8%, P=.0008), and doses 
required to achieve maintenance (198 vs 225, P=.008). The 
authors concluded that omalizumab led to improvements safety 
but not efficacy.
In the second study, open-label omalizumab was 
administered in a placebo-controlled study of peanut OIT [68]. 
After 12 weeks of treatment with omalizumab, patients 
underwent a rapid 1-day desensitization of up to 250 mg of 
peanut protein, followed by weekly increases up to 2000 mg. 
The median peanut dose tolerated on the initial desensitization 
day was 250 mg for omalizumab-treated patients compared 
with 22.5 mg for placebo-treated patients. Subsequently, 79% 
of those receiving omalizumab tolerated 2000 mg of peanut 
protein 6 weeks after stopping omalizumab compared with 
12% of those receiving placebo (P<.01). Reaction rates were 
not significantly lower in omalizumab-treated patients than in 
placebo-treated patients (odds ratio, 0.57; P=.15), although 
omalizumab-treated patients were exposed to much higher 
peanut doses. The authors concluded that omalizumab enables 
patients with peanut allergy to be rapidly desensitized and that 
in most cases, this desensitization is sustained after omalizumab 
is discontinued. 
It has also been suggested that probiotics may have 
adjuvant effects for inhalant allergen immunotherapy [69]. 
Tang et al [70] expanded this concept to food immunotherapy 
with a trial adding the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus to 
peanut OIT or placebo. The primary outcome was induction 
of possible SU 2 to 5 weeks after discontinuing OIT, which 
was achieved in 82.1% of those receiving OIT and 3.6% of 
those receiving placebo. While these results are limited by the 
fact that the probiotic treatment was not placebo-controlled 
and the period off treatment was as short as 2 weeks, the 
proportion of patients achieving SU was higher than in other 
studies, thus raising the possibility that probiotics may truly 
enhance this effect.
Case reports and small open-label trials have been 
conducted with a number of other adjunctive therapies, 
including interferon gamma, ketotifen, and leukotriene receptor 
antagonists [71-75]. In 2013, a randomized single-blind 
placebo-controlled study of 6 patients undergoing peanut OIT 
showed that premedication with ketotifen at 2 mg twice daily 
might reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms during 
active OIT [73]. Furthermore, Takahashi et al [74] studied 
the use of montelukast with OIT in a retrospective study of 
5 children, where leukotriene receptor antagonists appeared 
to help patients reach their target dose. Each of these possible 
adjunctive therapies requires further study. 
Future Considerations/Conclusions
Food allergy is common and potentially life-threatening. 
Despite the significant impact of food allergy on patients and 
health care systems, there are currently no approved therapies for 
food allergy apart from strict avoidance. Milk, egg, and peanut 
OIT studies have consistently shown successful desensitization, 
although longer-lasting tolerance does not appear likely at this 
stage of investigation. Further mechanistic studies are needed 
to improve our understanding of the immunologic changes 
induced by OIT and to identify biomarkers of response. Safety 
is a significant concern, as adverse events are common during 
OIT, thus limiting its use in some patients. Incorporation of 
novel therapies such as modified food allergens, probiotics, and 
other immunomodulator therapies in conjunction with OIT is 
underway with the goals of improving both safety and efficacy. 
Larger, well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials 
are needed to determine the efficacy and short- and long-term 
safety of OIT before it can be implemented in general clinical 
practice.
