ABSTRACT
Use of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) increased
∼100-fold from 1974 to 2014. Additional increases are
expected due to widespread emergence of glyphosate-
resistant weeds, increased application of GBHs, and
preharvest uses of GBHs as desiccants. Current safety
assessments rely heavily on studies conducted over
30 years ago. We have considered information on GBH
use, exposures, mechanisms of action, toxicity and
epidemiology. Human exposures to glyphosate are rising,
and a number of in vitro and in vivo studies challenge
the basis for the current safety assessment of glyphosate
and GBHs. We conclude that current safety standards for
GBHs are outdated and may fail to protect public health
or the environment. To improve safety standards, the
following are urgently needed: (1) human biomonitoring
for glyphosate and its metabolites; (2) prioritisation of
glyphosate and GBHs for hazard assessments, including
toxicological studies that use state-of-the-art approaches;
(3) epidemiological studies, especially of occupationally
exposed agricultural workers, pregnant women and their
children and (4) evaluations of GBHs in commercially
used formulations, recognising that herbicide mixtures
likely have effects that are not predicted by studying
glyphosate alone.
INTRODUCTION
Glyphosate is an active ingredient in a number
of
commercially
available
herbicides,
including
several that are used in concert with genetically
modified crops. The herbicidal action of glyphosate
derives from its inhibition of a key plant enzyme,
5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, which
is involved in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.
Since this enzyme is not present in vertebrates, it has
long been believed that glyphosate would not affect
non-target species, including humans. However,
multiple lines of evidence suggest that this conten-
tion is inaccurate.
Methods used in environmental health sciences
to examine the potential health effects of chemi-
cals, including pesticides, have undergone substan-
tial changes over the past 30 years. Cutting-edge
tools currently employed by federally funded scien-
tists bear little resemblance to the archaic standar-
dised assays required by regulatory agencies and
used in formal risk assessments.1 W
e are concerned
that the assays used to assess glyphosate safety,
including the toxicity studies requested by the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2009,
may be insufficient to address the full complement
of health effects that could be induced by exposure
to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs).
In this commentary, we summarise these key
findings as well as trends in increased use of GBHs.
Since commercial applications of GBHs began four
decades ago, their use has diversified and expanded
considerably. W
e offer recommendations on how to
reduce significant uncertainties concerning GBH
risks.
GLYPHOSATE USE HAS INCREASED SINCE
SAFETY EVALUATIONS WERE CONDUCTED
Glyphosate was registered in 1974 in the USA as a
broad-spectrum contact herbicide to kill weeds in
fields prior to the planting of crops. It was also
approved for weed control in a variety of non-crop
settings. Glyphosate use is the highest of any pesti-
cide in the USA, with rapid increases in use over
the last two decades; worldwide estimates of use
suggest that enough GBH was applied in 2014 to
spray nearly 0.5 kg glyphosate on every hectare of
cropland on the planet.2
In addition to their use as weed-control herbi-
cides, GBHs are now used as desiccants prior to
harvest3 to accelerate natural drying of seeds. These
use patterns are expected to increase glyphosate
residue levels in harvested products. Although such
effects still need to be evaluated in controlled studies,
residues of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic
acid (AMPA) (the major bioactive metabolite of gly-
phosate) are now routinely detected in soybeans,
wheat, barley, and many other crops and foods.4 5
Although GBH use has increased dramatically in
the last 10 years, most of the science used in the
risk assessment process to support its safety was
conducted more than 30 years ago. In the US EPA’s
1993 registration review of GBHs,6 for example,
73% of the almost 300 citations were published
prior to 1985; importantly, only 11 were peer-
reviewed.
A
search
of
PubMed
(conducted
6
November 2016) reveals more than 1500 published
studies on glyphosate in the last decade alone. It is
incongruous that safety assessments of the most
widely used herbicide on the planet rely largely on
fewer than 300 unpublished, non-peer-reviewed
studies while excluding the vast, modern literature
on glyphosate effects.
Considering the ∼100-fold increase in GBH use
in the last four decades, increased human exposure
is almost certain. Unfortunately, no systematic data
have tracked changes in glyphosate or AMPA con-
centrations in human tissues or bodily fluids during

 this period. For this reason, we recommend that glyphosate and
AMPA should be monitored by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (US CDC) in its National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) biomonitoring pro-
gramme, as well as other biomonitoring programmes around
the world. Studies of the general population to evaluate actual
exposures via diet (rather than hypothetical inferred exposures),
as well as studies in occupationally exposed individuals (eg,
pesticide sprayers as well as production workers), are both
needed.
ARE HUMANS AFFECTED BY GBHS?
There are few human epidemiology studies examining the
impact of glyphosate on human diseases. Unexplained chronic
kidney disease has killed thousands of rice farm workers in Sri
Lanka7 and sugarcane workers in Central America;8 exposure to
herbicides including GBHs has been documented in some of
these populations.9 Some epidemiologists have hypothesised
that epidemics of chronic kidney disease among male agricul-
tural workers result from the interactions of the herbicide with
hard drinking water and associated metals.7
9 Others have
attributed these health conditions to dehydration.10 Neither
explanation is plausible because such plantation work in these
regions has been going on for centuries while the epidemic of
kidney failure and herbicide use are recent phenomena.
A number of other studies have evaluated the association
between exposures to GBHs and other health effects in humans
including cancer. In fact, some of the most compelling studies in
human populations suggest associations between GBHs and
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.11 12 Cancer end points will be dis-
cussed later in this commentary.
Without
appropriate
epidemiological
and
biomonitoring
studies, any association between glyphosate and AMPA concen-
trations found in human tissues and fluids with disease will
remain uncertain. Epidemiological studies are urgently needed
to augment the ability of risk assessors to draw better conclu-
sions about the safety of GBHs. Such studies should evaluate
short-term and long-term health outcomes including DNA
damage and cancer.
RECENT STUDIES RAISE NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT GBH
SAFETY
In laboratory animals, glyphosate can disrupt reproductive
development in male rats,13 and male and female fish.14
15
Studies in fish and the amphibian Xenopus laevis demonstrate
that developmental exposures to GBHs induce malformations in
craniofacial structures and the brain, although the mechanism
underlying these effects is not fully understood.16 17 Research
from controlled laboratory studies also suggests that GBHs may
contribute
to
liver,18
hepatorenal19–22
and
cardiovascular
damage;23 24 some of these effects may be due to altered ion
flux in these tissues.25 GBHs are also recognised to cause
serious
eye
damage
based
on
evaluation
of
six
separate
studies.26 Finally, GBH exposures have been shown to induce
oxidative stress27 and genotoxicity28 in vitro and in vivo.
In a previous consensus statement, we analysed these data and
raised concerns over the setting of ‘safe’ levels of exposure by
regulatory agencies around the world;29 other comprehensive
reviews of the toxicity literature also provide an excellent over-
view of the effects of glyphosate and GBHs on a range of end
points.30 31
Recently, there has been debate over the possibility that gly-
phosate is an endocrine disruptor.13
14
32–34 Studies in cell
culture showed that glyphosate induces endocrine-mediated
effects on end points relevant to toxicity, as well as cell prolifer-
ation.32
33
In
contrast,
using
their
Endocrine
Disruptor
Screening Program (EDSP), the US EPA’s recent review of gly-
phosate dismissed statistically significant differences consistent
with oestrogenic activity in some assays (eg, altered vitellogenin
levels in a fish short-term reproduction assay) because they fol-
lowed a non-monotonic dose response.35 The final conclusion
of the US EPA was that ‘there was no convincing evidence’ that
glyphosate interacts with endocrine pathways. Significant criti-
cisms of the EDSP assays have been raised by endocrinologists,
and others have expressed concern about the failure of the EPA
to acknowledge non-monotonic dose responses, which have
been documented for other endocrine disruptors.36 Other agen-
cies including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have
used the EDSP data to suggest that there is not sufficient evi-
dence to conclude that glyphosate is an endocrine disruptor, but
the 2015 EFSA report does note that ‘signs of endocrine acti-
vity… could not be completely ruled out’ in some of these
assays.37
In December 2009, the US EPA issued a ‘Glyphosate Final
W
ork Plan (FWP) registration review’38 that identified uncer-
tainties about the toxicity of glyphosate. For example, the EPA
announced its plan to require that registrants conduct acute and
subchronic neurotoxicity studies as well as an immunotoxicity
study. The EPA also acknowledged that AMPA had not been
evaluated for ecological risk assessments. Since this testing is
supposed to be conducted by the registrants, it is unclear
whether testing is underway, will actually be completed, or will
be published in the peer-reviewed literature. Thus, additional
studies, using state-of-the-art approaches, are needed to better
elucidate the effects of glyphosate and GBHs on non-target
species. W
e recommend that scientists and entities independent
of the registrants, (eg, the US National T
oxicology Program
(NTP)) should prioritise glyphosate and GBHs for hazard assess-
ments. In fact, the US EPA also proposed a collaborative
research plan with the NTP
, which calls for NTP to help
provide answers to four research questions: (1) comparisons of
the toxicity of glyphosate versus GBH formulations; (2) provide
publicly available data on glyphosate’s effects on cancer-related
end points; and (3) non-cancer end points; (4) finally, investigate
the mechanisms by which glyphosate and GBHs induce toxic
and adverse effects.39 Several of these points are addressed
further below.
GBHS ARE CHEMICAL MIXTURES, AND MAY BE MORE
TOXIC THAN GLYPHOSATE ALONE
GBHs are always used as a mixture of glyphosate plus numerous
other so called inert ingredients, which are added to alter the
herbicide’s physicochemical properties and enhance its herbici-
dal action. Some inert ingredients or chemicals are used to
enhance the adhesion of glyphosate to plant surfaces (eg, alkyl
polyglycosides), whereas others facilitate its penetration of plant
cell walls and into plant tissues (eg, ethoxylated tallow amines)
to exert its herbicidal effects. Unfortunately, the full list of these
chemicals, collectively known as adjuvants or coformulants, is
treated as a trade secret by the manufacturers; the composition
of GBHs are unknown and available data on the hazards posed
by different mixtures remain limited.
Chemical mixtures can have effects that are more potent than
the effects of individual ingredients.40 GBHs have been shown
to be more toxic than glyphosate.41–44 It also should be noted
that some of the studies discussed in the previous section of this
review evaluated GBHs, and thus likely reveal effects that may
not be observed if studies examined only the active ingredient.

 These results reveal that GBH safety evaluations focused on gly-
phosate alone can underestimate toxicity and are insufficient to
assess
relevance
to
human
and
environmental
exposures.
Although the number of commercial formulations is extensive
and will be difficult to study comprehensively, we propose that
the most widely applied GBH formulations should be tested in
parallel with glyphosate alone.
IS GLYPHOSATE A HUMAN CARCINOGEN?
Over the last few years, glyphosate has received significant atten-
tion by the public as well as regulatory agencies around the
world. In the European Union, safety evaluations on glyphosate
have recently been conducted by the European Chemicals
Agency (ECHA) and EFSA; in the USA, meetings by evaluation
committees within the US EPA scheduled for fall 2016 were
cancelled so the agency could supplement the panel of experts
with additional members who have expertise in epidemiology.
In December 2016, an EPA scientific advisory panel was
charged with evaluating the human carcinogenic potential of
glyphosate only, not GBHs. The conclusions of this panel have
not yet been released.
The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) working group’s 2015 decision to classify glyphosate as
a grade 2A probable human carcinogen followed an extensive
review and evaluation of the weight of all available evidence.45
The outcome was driven by: (1) limited human evidence from
case–control epidemiology studies, including high-quality studies
reporting a link with non-Hodgkin lymphoma;11 12 (2) sufficient
evidence from unpublished animal studies analysed by the US
EPA, which identified an elevated frequency of rare kidney
tumours in male mice, hemangiosarcoma in male mice, pancre-
atic islet-cell adenoma in male rats, and skin tumours and other
non-malignant growths in mice and (3) strong mechanistic evi-
dence, such as numerous studies demonstrating that glyphosate
is genotoxic and can induce oxidative stress in humans, human
cells, non-human mammals and non-mammalian species (data
reviewed in depth in ref. 46). Other data from unpublished
studies that have been reviewed in the peer-reviewed literature
could not be evaluated by IARC because the data were not pub-
licly available; some of these studies also suggest increases in
lymphoma in male mice exposed even to the lowest doses evalu-
ated (14.5 mg/kg/day) (see study 13 evaluated in ref. 47).
A joint meeting on pesticides residues ( JMPR) in the WHO
used the IARC hazard assessment evaluation (eg, concluding
that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen) to establish a
safe level of exposure for humans. In their most recent evalu-
ation, JMPR would not exclude the possibility that glyphosate is
a human carcinogen, but concluded that it ‘is unlikely to pose a
carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet’.48
The JMPR did not conduct a quantitative assessment to estimate
cancer risk at current dietary exposures, and, more crucially, did
not evaluate actual dietary exposures in any population.
The IARC classification was made based on an analysis of the
entire body of evidence, including the evaluation of GBH (mix-
tures) and not glyphosate alone, as IARC requires that ‘the body
of evidence is considered as a whole…’.49 A 2016 review of the
carcinogenic potential of glyphosate by EFSA contrasts with the
IARC
conclusions.37
EFSA
concluded
that
‘glyphosate
is
unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans’ but notes that
it drew its conclusions based only on studies of glyphosate
alone; studies of GBHs were not included in the EFSA assess-
ment. Other agencies in the European Union, including the
German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, have similarly
focused on studies of the active ingredient, failing to consider
all studies of GBHs.50 Furthermore, the EFSA monograph notes
that studies that demonstrate the genotoxicity of glyphosate that
were considered by IARC were not considered by EFSA because
they did not follow prescribed guidelines for study reporting
(eg, good laboratory practices, or GLP);37 this argument has
also been made to eliminate studies conducted within academia
in other risk assessments,1 despite evidence that academic
laboratory research can be well designed and properly reported
in the absence of GLP
.51 Importantly, studies conducted accord-
ing to GLP (including study 13 evaluated in ref. 47) that suggest
causal links between glyphosate and cancer in exposed rodents
have been dismissed by agencies including the EPA and EFSA
due to speculation about a viral infection in the animal colony,
even though no adverse health effects of such an infection have
been shown.26
After the release of the IARC and EFSA expert conclusions,
there were a number of public discussions and articles written
for lay audiences describing how these organisations could
come to conflicting results after reviewing the same literature.
These discussions revealed that the same literature often was not
evaluated: IARC examined studies of GBH and glyphosate
whereas EFSA only evaluated studies of glyphosate; IARC exam-
ined all studies whereas EFSA gave priority to studies conducted
according to GLP
. Finally, IARC has strict conflict of interest
rules about the experts that serve on its panels, whereas other
agencies including EFSA do not exclude experts that have
received monetary compensation from chemical manufacturers.
There is evidence that the presence of individuals with conflicts
of interest on regulatory panels can influence the integrity of
decision making.52 53
WHERE DOES THE BURDEN OF PROOF OF SAFETY LIE?
The EFSA report, evaluating only studies of glyphosate and not
GBH mixtures, concluded that there was no evidence to con-
clude that it is a carcinogen.37 The European Commission has
not yet accepted the EFSA conclusion; in 2016, because
European Union member states failed to take action against gly-
phosate, the European Commission extended its approval for its
use under certain circumstances for 18 months, giving ECHA
this time to review glyphosate’s classification. In the interim, the
Commission recommended that an adjuvant, ethoxylated tallow
amine, be banned from GBHs; that spraying of public parks,
playgrounds and gardens be minimised; and that preharvest uses
be minimised.54 It will be up to the individual member states to
approve and enforce these recommendations.
In
the
USA,
the
Federal
Insecticide,
Fungicide,
and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA, (7 U.S.C. §136 et seq. (1996)))
requires chemical manufacturers to demonstrate that a pesticide
will not cause ‘unreasonable adverse effects on the environ-
ment’. Although FIFRA allows risks to humans and the envir-
onment to be balanced by the benefits of a pesticide’s use, this
can only be accomplished if sufficient data are available to
support safety. It also can only be accomplished if the full costs
of exposure, including costs to human health, are quantified
(see ref. 55 for a discussion of the costs of other environmental
chemicals).
FIFRA places the burden to demonstrate that a pesticide is
safe on the manufacturers and registrants. Yet the knowledge
gaps that currently exist preclude the drawing of conclusions
that GBHs are safe as currently used. FIFRA provides the US
EPA with the means to restrict the use of pesticides, to update
registered pesticides (like glyphosate) with new safety informa-
tion, and to take action when new evidence of adverse environ-
mental or human health effects are reported (7 U.S.C. §136 et

 seq. (1996)). The studies we have outlined in this commentary,
together with the burden of proof for safety on the chemical
manufacturer, clearly suggests that such actions are needed.
CONCLUSIONS
In this commentary, we have identified factors that heighten
concerns over the adequacy of safety assessments, and by exten-
sion, permitted levels of exposure to glyphosate and GBHs.
These factors include increased use of GBHs on crops and for
non-crop weed control, leading to measurable concentrations of
glyphosate and AMPA in foodstuffs and likely increases in
human exposures. The lack of biomonitoring data and epi-
demiological studies remain important data gaps. A small
number of controlled laboratory studies using contemporary sci-
entific approaches have identified adverse effects of glyphosate
and GBHs at much lower doses than those used to make risk
assessment decisions. Although there is controversy and debate
regarding the carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting potential
of these compounds, conclusions such as those drawn by IARC
call into question the safety of GBHs beyond ‘reasonable cer-
tainty of no harm’. Considering what is now known about gly-
phosate from studies published over the last three decades, as
well as the knowledge gaps that continue to raise concerns, we
conclude that current safety standards for GBHs are outdated
and may fail to protect public health and the environment.
What is already known
▸ Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide, and its use continues
to rise
▸ Epidemiology studies suggest associations between GBH
exposures and adverse health outcomes including chronic
kidney disease and some cancers
▸ A small number of rodent studies suggest that glyphosate
can induce cancers
▸ The effects of chemical mixtures can be more toxic than the
effects of individual compounds
What this study adds
▸ We call for improved biomonitoring of glyphosate and its
metabolites in human populations
▸ We recommend that hazard assessments using state-of-the-
art technical approaches be conducted on glyphosate and
GBHs
▸ Epidemiological studies examining occupationally exposed
workers, pesticide manufacturers, and vulnerable
populations are needed
▸ After review of all evaluations, we conclude that the current
safety standards are outdated and fail to protect public
health and the environment.
