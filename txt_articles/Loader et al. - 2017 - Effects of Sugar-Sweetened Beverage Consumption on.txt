ommercial sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are one of 
the most frequently consumed drinks worldwide.1,2 As 
such, they represent a major source of added sugar in the 
modern diet. Habitual consumption of SSB induces frequent 
episodes of acute hyperglycemia and is linked to an increased 
risk of developing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 
diabetes mellitus.2–4 Furthermore, excessive SSB consump-
tion is also associated with a higher incidence of advanced 
forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD),2 which remains the 
single leading cause of death representing 31% of the global 
mortality rate.5 Impaired vascular function is considered to 
be a main precursor to the pathogenesis of CVD and may be 
present long before atherosclerotic vascular changes occur.6

Normal vascular function involves a continuous interaction 
between the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) 
that is regulated by numerous vasodilators and vasoconstric-
tors.7,8 In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, our 
research group provided evidence that acute hyperglycemia 
induced by an oral sugar load transiently impairs endothelial 
function not only in patients with cardiometabolic disease, 
but also in those who are considered healthy.9 It has been sug-
gested that such endothelial dysfunction may be attributed 
to increased oxidative stress mediated by acute hyperglyce-
mia.10,11 Indeed, nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in the vascu-
lar wall is highly sensitive to redox modulation of the cellular

Objective—To assess vascular function during acute hyperglycemia induced by commercial sugar-sweetened beverage 
(SSB) consumption and its effect on underlying mechanisms of the nitric oxide pathway.
Approach and Results—In a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial, 12 healthy male participants consumed 600 mL 
(20 oz.) of water or a commercial SSB across 2 visits. Endothelial and vascular smooth muscle functions were assessed 
in the microcirculation using laser speckle contrast imaging coupled with iontophoresis and in the macrocirculation 
using brachial artery ultrasound with flow- and nitrate-mediated dilation. Compared with water, SSB consumption 
impaired microvascular and macrovascular endothelial function as indicated by a decrease in the vascular response to 
acetylcholine iontophoresis (208.3±24.3 versus 144.2±15.7%, P<0.01) and reduced flow-mediated dilation (0.019±0.002 
versus 0.014±0.002%/s, P<0.01), respectively. Systemic vascular smooth muscle remained preserved. Similar decreases 
in endothelial function were observed during acute hyperglycemia in an in vivo rat model. However, function was fully 
restored by treatment with the antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and apocynin. In addition, ex vivo experiments revealed that 
although the production of reactive oxygen species was increased during acute hyperglycemia, the bioavailability of nitric 
oxide in the endothelium was decreased, despite no change in the activation state of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.
Conclusions—To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the vascular effects of acute hyperglycemia induced by 
commercial SSB consumption alone. These findings suggest that SSB-mediated endothelial dysfunction is partly due to 
increased oxidative stress that decreases nitric oxide bioavailability.

environment.12,13 However, due to a limited availability of 
microcirculatory data and discrepant reporting of macrovas-
cular data, the impact of acute hyperglycemia on vascular 
function remains inconclusive and the underlying mecha-
nisms not fully understood.
In this context and considering the surge in commercial 
SSB consumption, as well as its potential link to a sustained 
epidemic of CVD, this study aimed to provide a comprehen-
sive assessment of the effect of SSB-mediated acute hyper-
glycemia on microvascular and macrovascular function in a 
healthy population. In addition, considering that experimental 
exploration of healthy vascular tissue in humans is difficult to 
perform, due to ethical barriers, this study also aimed to fur-
ther investigate the underlying mechanisms of the interaction 
between acute hyperglycemia and endothelial function via an 
in vivo and ex vivo rat model.

Supplement.
Results
Twelve healthy male participants were recruited and completed 
this randomized, single-blind, crossover trial between June 9, 
2014 and July 4, 2014 (Figure 1). To examine the acute vascular 
effects of commercial SSB consumption in humans, variables 
of blood glucose concentration, heart rate, arterial pressure, and 
vascular function were assessed after the ingestion of 600 mL 
(20 oz.) of a commercial SSB and compared with values mea-
sured after water consumption (Figure 2). Nutritional informa-
tion for each beverage is presented in Table 1.
Participant Characteristics
Participants included in the study were aged 31±1.9 years with a 
body mass index of 24.68±0.71 kg/m2. At each visit, before the 
consumption of the test beverage, basal measurements of fasting 
blood glucose (4.95±0.15 versus 4.78±0.16 mmol/L, P>0.05), 
heart rate (64.08±3.1 versus 62.25±3.2 bpm, P>0.05), and 
mean arterial pressure (80.50±1.66 mm Hg versus 79.86±1.48 
mm Hg, P>0.05) were found to be similar (Figure 3).
SSB Consumption Increased Blood Glucose 
Concentration With No Major Effect 
on Heart Rate or Blood Pressure
Ingestion of the SSB significantly elevated blood glucose 
concentrations above basal values 20 minutes (7.77±0.38 
versus 4.78±0.16 mmol/L, P<0.05) after the beginning 
of consumption, with peak hyperglycemia (8.85±0.36 
mmol/L, P<0.05) recorded at 40 minutes (Figure 3A). A 
progressive decrease in blood glucose concentrations was 
observed between 40 and 75 minutes thereafter. However, 
blood glucose concentrations at 75 minutes were still sig-
nificantly greater than basal blood glucose values (6.39±0.3 
versus 4.78±0.16 mmol/L, P<0.05), and all blood glucose 
values measured over time after water consumption. Blood 
glucose concentrations did not deviate from basal measure-
ments after water consumption. Sugar-sweetened beverage-
mediated acute hyperglycemia had no major effect on mean 
arterial pressure. However, a slight but significant reduction 
in mean arterial pressure was observed during peak hyper-
glycemia when compared with that at the baseline measure-
ment (P<0.05; Figure 3B). No variations in heart rate were 
observed during acute hyperglycemia (Figure 3C).
SSB Consumption Decreased Microvascular 
and Macrovascular Endothelial Function
During acute hyperglycemia, all assessments of microvas-
cular and macrovascular function were completed between 
20 and 75 minutes after the beginning of SSB consumption. 
Vascular function was assessed in the same time period after 
water consumption to allow for comparison between the 2 test 
beverages.
Assessment of Cutaneous Microvascular Function
Cutaneous microvascular endothelial and VSM functions 
were assessed using laser speckle contrast imaging in con-
junction with iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium 
nitroprusside, respectively. Before the beginning of iontopho-
resis, there were no differences in baseline measurements of 
basal cutaneous blood flux between each visit (23.6±1.8 ver-
sus 26.4±1.6 perfusion units, P=0.23; Table 2). An increase 
in cutaneous blood flux was observed after iontophoresis 
of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (Figure 4A). 
However, the relative percentage increase in cutaneous 
blood flux in response to acetylcholine iontophoresis was 
significantly lower during SSB-mediated acute hyperglyce-
mia when compared with that during normoglycemia after 
water consumption (129.76±11.18 versus 196.78±20.61%, 
respectively, P<0.01; Figure 4B). Even after accounting for 
differences in blood pressure between visits by converting 
cutaneous blood flux from perfusion units to cutaneous vas-
cular conductance, the relative increase in cutaneous blood 
flux mediated by acetylcholine iontophoresis was still lower 
after ingestion of the SSB than that measured after water 
consumption (144.2±15.7 versus 208.3±24.3%, respectively, 
P<0.01). In contrast, the vascular responses to iontophoresis 
of sodium nitroprusside were similar after the consumption 
of each test beverage.
Macrovascular Measurements
Endothelial and VSM functions were then assessed in the 
macrocirculation using ultrasound of the brachial artery in 
conjunction with flow-mediated dilation and nitrate-medi-
ated dilation, respectively. After the consumption of each 
test beverage, there were no differences in basal brachial 
artery diameter or blood flow between visits (4.7±0.1 ver-
sus 4.7±0.1 mm, P=0.68 and 48.0±5.7 versus 53.0±6.5 mL/

min, P=0.67, respectively; Table 2). Increases in brachial 
blood flow and the ∆shear rate induced during hyperemia 
were also similar between each visit (408.3±27.6 ver-
sus 445.1±34.5 mL/min, P=0.19 and 484.3±32.8 versus 
501.6±37.1%/s, P=0.51, respectively). However, flow-medi-
ated dilation was significantly reduced (−23.86±5.33%) 
during SSB-mediated acute hyperglycemia when compared 
with that during normoglycemia after water consumption; 
when expressed solely as the percentage change in diam-
eter (6.53±0.61 versus 8.56±0.54%, respectively, P<0.01; 
Figure 5) and as the percentage change in diameter with 
respect to the change in shear rate (0.014±0.002 versus 
0.019±0.002%/s, respectively, P<0.01). In contrast, there 
were no differences in the responses to nitrate-mediated 
dilation between each visit.
Endothelial Dysfunction After SSB 
Consumption May Be Associated With an Acute 
Hyperglycemic–Mediated Increase in Oxidative 
Stress That Decreases NO Bioavailability
Given that both flow-mediated dilation and the vascular 
response to acetylcholine iontophoresis were reduced dur-
ing SSB-mediated acute hyperglycemia, while the vascular 
responses to nitrate administration were preserved, clinical 
findings clearly suggest that acute hyperglycemia impairs 
microvascular and macrovascular function via an endothe-
lium-dependent pathway. However, considering that further 
experimental exploration within vascular tissues of healthy 
humans is, for ethical reasons, difficult to perform, the under-
lying mechanisms by which acute hyperglycemia mediates 
endothelial dysfunction were evaluated further, both in vivo

iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were performed. Immediately after the conclusion of iontophoresis, 
flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) were also performed. Blood glucose (GL), blood pressure (BP), and 
heart rate (HR) were measured after the 20 minutes resting period, 15 minutes after consuming the test beverage, at the end of ionto-
phoresis, at the end of FMD and at the end of NMD. All 12 participants were administered water or the commercial SSB in a randomized 
order.

and ex vivo, using an experimental rat model (Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Furthermore, as it is not 
possible to administer rats with an intraperitoneal injection 
of commercial SSB, this study used an intraperitoneal injec-
tion of glucose to examine the underlying mechanisms of 
SSB-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Importantly, previous 
research has revealed that acute changes in vascular function 
after SSB consumption are more related to the glucose, than 
the fructose, in sucrose15; and that fructose has a minimal 
effect on endothelial function in rats.16 Moreover, the adverse 
vascular effects of glucose consumption in humans has been 
further demonstrated in this study with the online-only Data 
Supplement indicating that macrovascular endothelial func-
tion is decreased during glucose-mediated acute hypergly-
cemia, compared with that during normoglycemia, when 
expressed as the percentage change in diameter (6.17±0.66 
versus 9.92±1.26%, respectively, P<0.05) and as the percent-
age change in diameter with respect to the change in shear rate 
(0.011±0.001 versus 0.018±0.003%/s, respectively, P=0.07; 
Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).
In Vivo Experimental Exploration
Acute hyperglycemia was induced in each rat using an intra-
peritoneal injection of glucose that mediated a hyperglycemic 
plateau between 10 and 20 minutes after administration, with 
peak hyperglycemia occurring at 15 minutes (Figure IIIA 
in the online-only Data Supplement). To allow for compari-
sons between the acute hyperglycemic and normoglycemic 
conditions, a group of control rats received a placebo injec-
tion of sodium chloride 0.9% (saline). During the acute hyper-
glycemic plateau, iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium 
nitroprusside was performed inducing a significant increase 
in cutaneous microvascular blood flux (Figure 6A). However, 
similar to the findings obtained in human trials, the relative 
increase in cutaneous blood flux in response to iontophoresis 
of acetylcholine was decreased during acute hyperglycemia 
when compared with normoglycemic controls, while the vas-
cular response to sodium nitroprusside iontophoresis remained 
preserved (Figure 6B). Such endothelial dysfunction may be 
primarily caused by an acute hyperglycemic-mediated increase 
in oxidative stress.17 Considering this, a third group of rats 
were treated with a dose of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, 
during normoglycemia and before the induction of acute 
hyperglycemia. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine had no 
effect on vascular function during normoglycemia. However, 
although the acute hyperglycemic responses to the intraperi-
toneal injection of glucose between N-acetylcysteine–treated 
and untreated rats were similar (Figure IIIB in the online-only 
Data Supplement), the increase in cutaneous blood flux in 
response to acetylcholine iontophoresis was fully restored in 
rats treated with the antioxidant (Figure 6B), supporting the 
implication of increased oxidative stress in acute hyperglyce-
mia-mediated endothelial dysfunction.
Ex Vivo Experimental Exploration
Given that endothelial function is highly dependent on NO bio-
availability, which itself is dependent on endothelial NO syn-
thase (eNOS) and its activation by phosphorylation at serine 
1177 (eNOSser1177), ex vivo experiments were then performed 
on rat aortic tissue to investigate the interaction between oxi-
dative stress and the NO pathway; and whether this interac-
tion contributes to the endothelial dysfunction observed during 
acute hyperglycemia. Similar to that observed after SSB con-
sumption in human trials and the intraperitoneal injection of 
glucose in in vivo experimental exploration, acute hyperglyce-
mia induced by the hyperglycemic solution decreased the relax-
ation response to acetylcholine administration in precontracted 
aortic rings in a dose-dependent manner (Figure IVA and IVB 
in the online-only Data Supplement). However, pretreatment 
with the nonspecific antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine restored the 
relaxation response in aortic rings during acute hyperglyce-
mia. Interestingly, similar results were observed when apocy-
nin, a specific inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase,18 was administered 
(Figure 6C). Although these results were supported by elec-
tron paramagnetic resonance assessments, which measured an 
elevation in the production of reactive oxygen species during 
acute hyperglycemia when compared with the normoglycemic 
condition (Figure 6D), Western blotting revealed that acute 
hyperglycemia had no effect on the expression of eNOS or its 
activation in aortic rings (Figure 6E). Moreover, eNOS dimer-
ization, evaluated by the SDS-resistant dimer/monomer ratio, 
was not affected by acute hyperglycemia (Figure 6F). Despite 
this, there was still a marked reduction in the bioavailability of 
NO in the aortic tissue, indicated by a lower concentration of 
nitrites, during acute hyperglycemia (Figure 6G).

Discussion
This study aimed to assess the effect of acute hypergly-
cemia induced by the ingestion of a commercial SSB on 
vascular function in healthy sedentary participants. It was 
found that SSB consumption decreased both microvascu-
lar and macrovascular endothelial function, whereas VSM 
function remained unaffected during acute hyperglycemia. 
Considering these findings, in vivo and ex vivo explorations 
were then performed in an experimental rat model to further 
investigate the interaction between acute hyperglycemia and 
vascular function and examine the underlying mechanisms 
that may mediate such endothelial dysfunction. Similar to 
that observed in human trials, acute hyperglycemia mediated 
a decrease in endothelial function in both in vivo and ex vivo 
experimental rat models. Interestingly, endothelial function 
was fully restored during acute hyperglycemia in rats that 
were pretreated with the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, and in 
aortic rings that were pretreated with either N-acetylcysteine 
or a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, apocynin. Further 
to this, it was found that acute hyperglycemia was associated 
with increased production of arterial reactive oxygen species 
and reduced bioavailability of NO. Collectively, these find-
ings suggest that acute hyperglycemia induces endothelial 
dysfunction by mediating an increase in oxidative stress that 
disrupts the NO pathway.
It is currently unknown how acute hyperglycemia induced 
by commercial SSB consumption affects vascular function 
because of limited and discrepant data. Previous research 
has most commonly assessed vascular function during acute 
hyperglycemia induced by a typical oral glucose load using 
measures of macrovascular reactivity, such as brachial artery 
ultrasound with flow-mediated dilation.9 However, emerging 
evidence suggests that coronary microvascular disease may 
explain the occurrence of myocardial ischemia, heart failure, 
and CVD mortality after myocardial infarction without appar-
ent coronary macrovascular disease,19 highlighting the need 
to assess the microcirculation, which represents most of the 
arterial vascular network and exerts dominant control over 
local blood flow,20 in conjunction with the macrocirculation 
when investigating mechanisms that contribute to the patho-
genesis of CVD. The results of this study are consistent with 
those in previous research, which demonstrated that commer-
cial SSB consumption mediates a decrease in macrovascular 
endothelial function as indicated by reduced flow-mediated 
dilation during acute hyperglycemia.21 Importantly, it should 
be noted that this previous study induced acute hyperglyce-
mia by administering a commercial SSB in conjunction with 
a high caloric commercial candy bar. In contrast, the micro-
circulatory findings contradict a separate study, which found 
that consumption of commercial SSB enhances microvascular 
endothelial function, as indicated by an increased cutaneous 
blood flux response to iontophoresis of acetylcholine during 
acute hyperglycemia.22 However, in this study, acute hyper-
glycemia was induced using a commercial SSB that is defined 
as an energy drink containing caffeine, which is an ingredi-
ent that has been found to increase microvascular reactivity 
in healthy participants.23 Considering the possible confound-
ing vascular effects of these additional foods or ingredients, 
this present research is, to our knowledge, the first to examine 
the effects of acute hyperglycemia induced by commercial

reduction in shear stress, a disruption of the NO pathway may 
be implicated in SSB-mediated endothelial dysfunction.24,25
Current evidence suggests that acute hyperglycemia 
induces endothelial dysfunction by mediating an abnormal 
elevation in oxidative stress that disturbs normal underlying 
mechanisms of NO synthesis.26,27 In the postprandial state, 
oxidative metabolism initiates oxidative phosphorylation of 
adenosine triphosphate at the electron transport chain of the 
mitochondria, which via the phenomenon of electron leakage 
causes superoxide generation of reactive oxygen species.28 
Moreover, it has been clearly reported that increased glycemia 
is responsible for the activation of NADPH oxidase, which 
also contributes to production of the superoxide anion.10 
Although these reactive oxygen species are normally readily 
detoxified, elevated activity within this mechanism such as 
that after commercial SSB consumption increases production 
to a rate beyond suppressive capabilities of the antioxidant 
systems.29 The implication of oxidative stress in acute hyper-
glycemia-mediated endothelial dysfunction is further sup-
ported by ex vivo findings in this study, which demonstrated 
that acute hyperglycemia increased reactive oxygen species 
in rat aortic rings. Moreover, treatment with the antioxidants, 
N-acetylcysteine and Apocynin, were found to attenuate the 
impaired relaxation response to acetylcholine iontophore-
sis observed during acute hyperglycemia. Importantly, the 
applicability of this oxidative stress–dependent mechanism 
to acute hyperglycemia–mediated endothelial dysfunction in 
living organisms was also demonstrated in this study, which 
revealed for the first time in an in vivo experimental rat model 
that antioxidant treatment also fully restores cutaneous micro-
vascular endothelial function during acute hyperglycemia. 
This study also found that eNOSser1177 and the eNOS dimer/
monomer ratios remained preserved during acute hypergly-
cemia, whereas the concentration of nitrites was decreased. 
Such experimental findings provide evidence that SSB-
mediated endothelial dysfunction is due, at least in part, to 
decreased bioavailability of NO that is not caused by a disrup-
tion to the synthesis of NO via the eNOS pathway. Indeed, the 
reaction between NO and free radical superoxide results in the 
formation of peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxic molecule.30 This 
nitro-oxidative stress could be a primary mechanism respon-
sible for the decrease in NO bioavailability that was observed 
in our model of acute hyperglycemic stress.
Despite not being affected in this study, previous research 
has demonstrated decreased VSM function mediated by VSM 
cell proliferation in as little as 6 hours after the induction of 
hyperglycemia in animal and in vitro studies,31 suggesting a 
need to extend the typical assessment period of vascular func-
tion after SSB consumption in future research. Moreover, con-
sidering the global rate of commercial SSB consumption and 
its role in transient endothelial dysfunction, even in a healthy 
population, research must also quantify the relative loading 
of SSB over time that mediates significant vascular remodel-
ing and contributes to the pathogenesis of CVD in humans.9 
In addition to examining the underlying mechanisms of 
NO-mediated microvascular function, future research may 
also assess the effect of SSB consumption on other main 
vasoactive mediators such as prostaglandin I2, endothelium-
derived hyperpolarizing factor, and endothelin-1, all of which 
have varying influence between the microvascular and mac-
rocirculation.7,11,32 Finally, these studies need to be conducted 
across a variety of ethnicities, some of which have previously 
demonstrated decreased vascular function even at rest and, 
therefore, may be more severely affected by the deleterious 
vascular-related effects of acute hyperglycemia than that 
observed in white populations.33,34
Several inherent limitations must be considered when 
interpreting this data. Whereas the main sugar in SSB is 
sucrose, which is comprised of glucose and fructose, only 
glucose was used to induce acute hyperglycemia in the exper-
imental rat model that aimed to explain the effects of SSB 
consumption on underlying mechanisms of vascular function. 
However, it has been suggested that acute deleterious cardio-
vascular effects of sucrose are more related to glucose rather 
than fructose,11,15 with previous findings also demonstrating 
that fructose has no significant effect on endothelial func-
tion in rats.16 Nevertheless, although normal VSM function 
remained preserved after SSB consumption in this study, pre-
vious research has found that fructose can decrease the VSM 
relaxation response to the administration of sodium nitro-
prusside in rats,16 and therefore, it cannot be completely dis-
counted that fructose may also contribute, to some extent, to 
the observed SSB-mediated endothelial dysfunction. It must 
also be considered that ingredients other than sucrose that 
comprise commercial SSB were not evaluated individually in 
this research and, therefore, it is not known how they may 
contribute to the observed SSB-mediated endothelial dysfunc-
tion. Indeed, increases in plasma sodium may also contribute 
to a decrease in NO bioavailability.35 In addition, it was not 
possible to blind participants to the intervention by using a 
sugar-free placebo such as a commercial diet soda because 
of previous research suggesting that even artificial sweeteners 
may interact with taste receptors stimulating insulin secretion, 
which may induce a vascular response.36 Given that changes in 
blood insulin concentration in response to SSB consumption 
were not monitored in this study, it was not possible to explore 
what effect SSB consumption may have on mechanisms of

insulin-mediated vasodilation. Finally, vascular function was 
assessed in a focussed sample and, therefore, the effect of SSB 
consumption may vary across health groups, ethnicities, and 
genders.
In conclusion, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to 
assess vascular function during acute hyperglycemia induced 
by SSB consumption alone. The findings of this study dem-
onstrate that commercial SSB consumption induces micro-
vascular and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction in a 
healthy population. Furthermore, data from the experimen-
tal rat model suggest that this commercial SSB-mediated 
endothelial dysfunction is partly because of increased oxi-
dative stress, which reduces NO bioavailability. Ultimately, 
these results inform international public health policy on the 
adverse effects of both commercial SSB and general excess 
sugar consumption, and how they contribute so acutely, even 
in those considered healthy, to the upregulation of mecha-
nisms that are the primary precursors to the pathogenesis 
of CVD.37

Highlights
• To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects of acute hyperglycemia induced by consumption of a commercial sugar-
sweetened beverage alone on vascular function.
• Consumption of commercial sugar-sweetened beverages induces acute hyperglycemia that mediates a transient endothelial dysfunction in the 
microvascular and macrocirculation, even in those considered to be healthy.
• Findings from an in vivo and ex vivo experimental rat model suggest that acute hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in oxidative stress 
that decreases nitric oxide bioavailability that subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction.
