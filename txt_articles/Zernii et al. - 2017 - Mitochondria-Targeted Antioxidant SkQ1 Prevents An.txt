Dry eye syndrome (DES) is an age-related condition increasingly detected in younger people of risk groups, including patients who
underwent ocular surgery or long-term general anesthesia. Being a multifactorial disease, it is characterized by oxidative stress in
the cornea and commonly complicated by ocular surface inflammation. Polyetiologic DES is responsive to SkQ1, a
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant suppressing age-related changes in the ocular tissues. Here, we demonstrate safety and
efficacy of topical administration of SkQ1 at a dosage of 7.5 μM for the prevention of general anesthesia-induced DES in rabbits.
The protective action of SkQ1 improves clinical state of the ocular surface by inhibiting apoptotic and prenecrotic changes in
the corneal epithelium. The underlying mechanism involves the suppression of the oxidative stress supported by the
stimulation of intrinsic antioxidant activity and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, foremost glutathione peroxidase and
glutathione reductase, in the cornea. Furthermore, SkQ1 increases antioxidant activity and stability of the tear film and
produces anti-inflammatory effect exhibited as downregulation of TNF-α and IL-6 and pronounced upregulation of IL-10 in
tears. Our data suggest novel features of SkQ1 and point to its feasibility in patients with DES and individuals at risk for the
disease including those subjected to general anesthesia.
1. Introduction
Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a multifactorial ocular pathology
characterized by corneal epithelium lesions, inflammation of
ocular surface, and symptoms of discomfort including irrita-
tion, itching, and burning eyes [1, 2]. According to the epide-
miological studies, DES affects more than 300 million people
worldwide and represents the major reason for seeking eye
care in developed countries [3]. Ageing, prolonged eye strain,
environmental factors, medication intake, and refractive sur-
gery are the major contributors to DES development [4].
General anesthesia is another risk factor for DES, which is
becoming more prominent with wider use of surgical inter-
ventions in modern medicine [5, 6].
DES is commonly associated with reduced tear produc-
tion and/or alterations in the tear composition, resulting in
the loss of protective and nourishing qualities of tears [1].
The integrity of the outermost layers of the ocular surface is
highly dependent on hydration and lubrication, provided
by the tear film, as well as on the tear cytokines and growth
factors, which promote wound healing and containment of
inflammatory responses in the corneal epithelium and
stroma. Consistently, current treatment of DES involves
usage of lubricating eye drops and ointments or, in more
Hindawi

 severe cases, anti-inflammatory medication [7]. Unfortu-
nately, therapeutic strategies relying on the moisturization
and lubrication of eye surface only provide temporary relief
from DES symptoms and have no effect on the pathogenic
processes underlying the disease. Treatment with anti-
inflammatory drugs, such as steroids, cyclosporine A, and
tetracycline, significantly improves clinical state of DES
patients. However, prolonged use of corticosteroid eye drops
may cause complications, namely, elevated intraocular pres-
sure and cataract, which place restrictions on the duration
of such treatment. Cyclosporine instillations cause burning
eye sensation, which is a major factor limiting its employ-
ment in DES. Antibiotics, such as tetracycline and azithro-
mycin, are applied successfully for the treatment of the
disease, but it is strongly recommended to avoid using them
at high doses because they are known to cause a number of
side effects [8]. Lately, therapeutic application of proteins
and peptides has been suggested as a prospective approach
to the treatment of DES-associated corneal defects. Yet, such
medications are generally based on cytokines, growth factors,
hormones, and other naturally occurring tear components
and, as such, could produce multifaceted and often contra-
dictory effects on the corneal homeostasis. In addition, the
majority of protein-based medications are not yet approved
for clinical use [9]. All things considered, the demand for
novel approaches to treating DES remains a highly relevant
problem in current ophthalmology.
Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of DES [10]. Normally,
the tear film provides effective antioxidant protection for
the ocular surface. It is enriched in both low molecular weight
antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbic acid, and others) and
enzymes involved in the replenishment of glutathione pool
and first-hand scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide
dismutase, etc.) [11, 12]. In DES, acute elevation in ROS
levels affects corneal epithelial cells directly, by causing
irreversible oxidative modifications of nuclear acids, lipids,
and proteins, and indirectly, via the increased expression of
proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, oxidative stress is known
to induce and prolong local inflammatory responses leading
to corneal injury [13]. With this in mind, antioxidant prepa-
rations to compensate for the loss of intrinsic antioxidant
activity might be regarded as a feasible approach to the
treatment of DES.
To date, a promising outlook on applying antioxidant
therapy for the treatment of DES was demonstrated in exper-
imental and clinical research. Thus, it has been shown that
certain antioxidants can suppress inflammation of corneal
epithelium and improve lacrimation [14–19]. The positive
effect of this therapy could potentially be explained by its
ability to balance redox status of tears and corneal epithe-
lium. However, the most potent antioxidants are expected
to be those targeting ROS directly in their intracellular
sources such as mitochondria [20]. Indeed, intramitochon-
drial oxidative stress is associated with processes, governing
cell survival, such as mitochondrial plasticity, apoptosis,
and autophagy [21, 22]. Since the mitochondria are impene-
trable to conventional antioxidants, the latter have low
effectiveness against ROS formation in these organelles.
Thus, a necessity for mitochondria-targeted antioxidants
emerged. In the last 15 years, several antioxidants of this class
were synthesized, including SkQ1, MitoQ, and SS31 [23–25].
These molecules are able to bypass plasma membrane and
outer mitochondrial membrane and accumulate in the mito-
chondria, thereby displaying exceptional antioxidant activity
even in nanomolar concentrations [20, 26]. As a result, they
massively outperform all the conventional antioxidants in
terms of specificity and activity levels. The employment of
this new class of antioxidants represents an attractive
pharmacological approach to the therapy of pathologies
associated with oxidative stress and peroxidation of proteins
and lipids of the inner membrane of mitochondria [20, 26].
Recent studies have demonstrated that administration of
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 improves the tear
film stability and regeneration of corneal epithelium in poly-
etiological DES [27, 28]. Furthermore, SkQ1 was found to
reduce age-related alterations in lacrimal gland in animals
[29]. However, detailed effects of SkQ1 on corneal state and
morphology as well as the biochemical mechanisms underly-
ing therapeutic effect of the antioxidant in DES remain
scarce. These questions could be addressed using animal
models of the disease such as recently characterized rabbit
model of anesthesia-induced DES. Indeed, the decline in tear
production and tear film stability under general anesthesia
leads to erosive processes involving all layers of corneal
epithelium, which are highly reminiscent of DES-associated
corneal lesions [5]. Furthermore, under these conditions, sig-
nificant alterations in biochemical and antioxidant properties
of tears are observed, similar to those in DES patients [6, 10].
All these features make the rabbit model of anesthesia-
induced DES highly convenient for investigating therapeutic
strategies for the disease, including antioxidant treatment
using SkQ1.
In this work, we employed the experimental model of
anesthesia-induced
DES
to
investigate
the
effect
of
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 on clinical status,
morphology, and biochemical properties of the cornea as
well as on the secretion, stability, and protective qualities of
the precorneal tear film. It was demonstrated for the first
time that the application of SkQ1 results in a prominent
improvement of clinical state of the ocular surface by inhi-
biting apoptotic and necrotic changes in the corneal epi-
thelium. Unexpectedly, this effect was produced not only
via suppressing oxidative stress in the cornea but also by
stimulating the intrinsic antioxidant defense of this tissue,
accelerating the recovery of redox status and integrity of
the tear film and dampening the local proinflammatory
response. Our data suggest novel mechanisms of SkQ1
action and point to its feasibility in patients with DES
and individuals at high risk for the disease including those
subjected to general anesthesia.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Materials. Anesthetic preparation containing 50mg/ml
tiletamine and 50mg/ml zolazepam was purchased from
Virbac (France). Xylazine hydrochloride was bought from
2
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
 Bioveta (Czech Republic). Fluorescein sodium solution was
from Novartis (Switzerland). Ultragrade Tris was pur-
chased from Amresco (USA). Molecular biology grade
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was bought from Gibco.
Hemoglobin, luminol, hydrogen peroxide solution, and
Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic
acid) were from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Other chemicals used
in this study were from Sigma-Aldrich, Amresco, or Serva
(Germany) and were at least of reagent grade. All buffers
and other solutions were prepared using ultrapure water.
The Schirmer test tear strips were from Contacare Ophthal-
mics & Diagnostics (India). SkQ1 (10-(6′-plastoquinonyl)-
decyltriphenylphosphonium) was synthesized and provided
by the Institute of Mitoengineering of Moscow State Univer-
sity (Moscow, Russia).
2.2. Experimental Animals and Ethics Statement. The study
involved a total of 182 healthy pigmented rabbits (6 months
old, weight of 2.3 to 3 kg) purchased from a certified farm
(Krolinfo, Russian Federation). The rabbits were housed at
a 12 h light-dark cycle at a temperature of 22–25°C and
humidity of 55–60% with free access to food and water.
The animals’ treatment was performed according to the 8th
edition “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”
of the National Research Council and “Statement for the Use
of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research” of The Asso-
ciation for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO).
The protocol was approved by the Belozersky Institute of
Physico-chemical Biology Animal Care and Use Committee
(Protocol number 1/2016).
The experiments were performed using a single-blind
method. The rabbits were divided into 29 (22 experimental
and 7 control) groups of 6–8 animals (see supplementary
Table S1 available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/
9281519) and treated as described in Results. To assess safety
of SkQ1 administration in a form of eye drops, the animals
were medicated by conjunctival instillations of 50 μl of either
vehicle solution (7 mM NaH2PO4, 2.6 mM Na2HPO4·12H2O,
containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.0001% benzalkonium chloride)
or the same solution containing 0.25, 2.5, 7.5, or 25 μM
SkQ1 (SkQ1 eye drops) in each eye 3 times a day for 7–30 days.
To induce general anesthesia, the animals were placed in
prone position in a restraining device and subjected to intra-
muscular injection of anesthetic preparation containing
50 mg/ml tiletamine and 50 mg/ml zolazepam. The injections
were repeated pro re nata to achieve continuous narcotic sleep
of the required duration (see supplementary Table S1). Anti-
oxidant premedication was performed as follows. On the
day before anesthesia, the animals received conjunctival
instillations of either vehicle solution or the same solution
containing 0.25 μM, 2.5 μM, or 7.5 μM SkQ1, 1 drop 3 times
a day. On the next day, an additional instillation of the vehi-
cle/total solution was carried out, and the animals were
exposed to general anesthesia. For the antioxidant therapy,
the animals were firstly exposed to general anesthesia and
then they received conjunctival instillations of the vehicle
solution or the same solution containing 0.25 μM, 2.5 μM,
or 7.5 μM SkQ1, 1 drop 3 times a day, for 30 days, starting
from the moment of recovery from the narcosis. In the course
of all experiments, the animals were kept under normal condi-
tions described above. After the characterization of corneal
state and/or tear collection, the animals were rehabilitated
for 3 days and returned to the farm. For biochemical and his-
tological studies of the cornea, the rabbits were humanely
euthanized by introduction into general anesthesia and subse-
quent intracardiac injection of the 1 ml of 20mg/ml xylazine
hydrochloride. Enucleating of the eyeballs and corneal
excision were performed postmortem.
2.3. Clinical Examination of the Cornea. The development of
corneal injury was monitored by fluorescein staining of the
ocular surface [30]. Briefly, 2 μl of 1% sodium fluorescein
was instilled under the lower eyelid of the animal and
distributed over the cornea by 2-3 movements imitating eye
blinking. The corneal status was then examined under the
slit-lamp microscope with or without cobalt blue filter. The
registered corneal injuries were assigned with clinical scores
(CS) of 0–4 depending on the size of the affected corneal
surface (fluorescein rating scale): no fluorescein staining
(CS = 0), staining of 0–12.5% of the corneal
surface
(CS = 1), staining of 12.5–25% of the corneal surface
(CS = 2), staining of 25–50% of the corneal surface (CS =3),
and staining of >50% of the corneal surface (CS =4). Mean
clinical scores (MCS) were derived by adding the clinical
scores for all eyes of the animals in a group and dividing by
the number of eyes ±standard deviation (SD). Incidence of
DES was determined as percent of eyes with diagnosed
corneal injury regardless of its score.
2.4. Histological Analysis. The animals were sacrificed after
fluorescein staining of the cornea given that the fluorescein
exposure does not impact tissue morphology [31, 32]. The
eyeballs were enucleated immediately postmortem and fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) for 24 hours at room temperature or in Carnoy’s
solution (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% glacial
acetic acid) for 3 hours at room temperature. The corneas
and irises were trimmed out of the fixed eyeballs along the
corneal limbus, dehydrated by incubation in absolute isopro-
panol for 5 h and embedded in Histomix paraffin medium.
Ten four-micron thick nasotemporal cross-sections of the
cornea with iris were prepared and mounted on glass slides.
The sections were then deparaffinized (xylene, 5 minutes,
two times), placed to absolute isopropanol (5 minutes, two
times), hydrated, and stained with Carazzi’s hematoxylin
and 0.5% eosin Y in water or with periodic acid and Schiff
(PAS) reagent [33]. Stained sections were dehydrated by
96% ethanol and xylene, cleared in BioClear tissue clearing
agent, mounted into BioMount synthetic medium, and
examined using an Axio Scope.A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Germany). Lesions in the cornea were assigned with severity
scores of 0–5, representing unremarkable, slight, mild,
moderate, marked, and severe, respectively. Mean severity
scores (MSS) were derived by adding the severity scores for
all animals (eyes) in each treated group and by dividing by
the number of animals (eyes) in the group [34]. Incidence
of the lesions was determined as a percent of eyes with diag-
nosed lesion regardless of its score. Microphotographs were
3
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
 obtained by an AxioCam MRc 5 megapixel color camera
(Carl Zeiss, Germany) and processed using AxioVision
v.3.0 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and Photoshop CS3 software
(Adobe Systems, USA). For the safety study, the lens and
optic nerve were histologically processed and microscopically
examined as described above. The retina was analyzed as
described previously [35].
2.5. Schirmer’s Test. Tear secretion was measured by means
of standardized the Schirmer test [36]. Briefly, gauged
Schirmer’s test paper strips were placed under the lower eye-
lid and removed after 5 minutes of soaking, and the length
of the moistened paper (in mm) was recorded. The proce-
dure was repeated at least three times, and the average
values were considered.
2.6. BUT Test. Stability of the tear film was examined using
standard tear film breakup time (BUT) test [37]. The instilla-
tions of fluorescein into the rabbit eye were performed
exactly as for clinical examination of the cornea (see above).
After each instillation, the time of appearance of the first dry
spot in the central cornea seen under a slit-lamp microscope
was measured.
2.7. Corneal and Tear Samples. To obtain corneal homoge-
nates, the full-size rabbit corneas were excised, placed into
400 μl of PBS, and frozen at −70°C. After thawing, the
homogenate was sonicated for 10 min on ice. Corneal
extracts for biochemical evaluations were obtained by centri-
fugation of the homogenates (15000g, 10min) at +4°C. The
tear samples were collected using gauged Schirmer’s test
strips. To this end, the length of the moistened strip was
allowed to reach exactly 20mm and its 15 mm fragments
were cut off and extracted with 150 μl of PBS.
2.8. Malondialdehyde Assay. MDA concentration was mea-
sured in corneal extracts using commercially available kits
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Intensity of colorimetric reaction was determined
using MR-96A Microplate Reader (Mindray, China). The
data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 11 (SYSTAT Software).
2.9. Total Protein Concentration. Protein concentration in
corneal extracts and tear samples was measured by the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using a BCA protein assay
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2.10. Total Antioxidant Activity. The corneal and tear sam-
ples were analyzed using hemoglobin-H2O2-luminol model
system [38]. Standard solutions, containing 1–8 μM Trolox
in PBS, were used as a reference. Thirty microliters of stan-
dard solution or tear samples diluted 1 : 4 by PBS was added
to 0.44 ml of reaction mixture, containing 0.01 mM luminol
and 0.5 mM hemoglobin in PBS. Luminol oxidation reaction
was stimulated by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to reach
6 μM. Chemiluminescence of the sample was registered each
1 second for 10 minutes using Glomax-Multi Detection Sys-
tem luminometer (Promega, USA). The data were analyzed
using SigmaPlot 11 (SYSTAT Software, USA), and total anti-
oxidant activity (AOA) was expressed in Trolox equivalent.
2.11. Antioxidant Enzyme Activity. The activity of tear
enzymes involved in antioxidant protection (superoxide dis-
mutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione
reductase (GR), and glutathione-SH transferase (GST)) was
evaluated in the corneal and tear samples, using commer-
cially available kits (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. Intensity of colorimetric
reactions was determined using MR-96A Microplate Reader
(Mindray, China). The acquired data were analyzed using
SigmaPlot 11 (SYSTAT Software). The activity of the
enzymes in corneal extracts was normalized to 1 mg of the
total protein.
2.12. Inflammatory Cytokine Content. The content of tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins 4 (IL-4), 6
(IL-6), and 10 (IL-10) was examined in the tear samples
using Rabbit ELISA kits (Cusabio Biotech, China) according
to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. The colori-
metric reaction was digitalized using MR-96A Microplate
Reader (Mindray).
2.13. Statistics. The data were analyzed by the mean standard
deviation method, using SigmaPlot 11 Software (SYSTAT
Software). The bars in the figures represent standard devia-
tion (SD). Mean scores, SD, and statistical significance were
calculated using SigmaPlot 11 Software or BioStat 2009
version 5.8.3.0 software (AnalystSoft, USA). Statistical signif-
icance was assessed using paired t-test (for safety evaluations)
or unpaired two-tailed t-test. The probability of 0.05 was
considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Safety of SkQ1 Eye Drop Administration. Since SkQ1 is a
nonnatural antioxidant, we firstly studied whether repetitive
conjunctival instillations of SkQ1 eye drops can induce
ocular toxicity in rabbits. To this end, the animals were
medicated with the solution containing 0.25, 2.5, 7.5, or
25 μM SkQ1 during one week and their eyes/eye tissues were
examined visually (lids, lacrimal apparatus, and conjunctiva),
ophthalmoscopically (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, iris,
and vitreous humor), and histologically (cornea, lens, iris,
retina, and optic nerve). It was found that administration of
SkQ1 eye drops was generally well tolerated at a dosage of
0.25, 2.5, and 7.5 μM SkQ1. Instillations of 25 μM SkQ1
induced conjunctival redness in one animal. Thus, the dose
of 0.25, 2.5, and 7.5 μM SkQ1 was considered safe for the
further applications. Given that the main hallmark of DES
is the altered tear secretion, we assessed this parameter in
animals before and after the instillation of 0.25, 2.5, or
7.5 μM SkQ1 3 times a day for 1 month. The divergence of
the results of the Schirmer test did not exceed 15% (p > 0 05)
in all cases, indicating almost no effect of the drug on the tear
secretion (Table 1).
3.2. Experimental Model of General Anesthesia-Induced DES
for Trialing of SkQ1 Treatment. A rabbit model of
4
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
 anesthesia-induced DES developed in our previous studies
[6, 39] was selected for further trialing of the antioxidant
therapy using SkQ1 eye drops. In order to characterize the
basic parameters of the model, we determined the incidence
of DES symptoms in rabbits depending on the duration of
general anesthesia. To this end, the animals were exposed
to general anesthesia for 0.5-6 h and their corneas were
subjected to clinical and morphological examination imme-
diately after the narcosis. The results of fluorescein test
indicated
anesthesia
time-dependent
accumulation
of
corneal epithelium injury in accordance with our previous
findings [39]. Statistical analysis revealed that the incidence
of the corneal damage rose with the duration of the narcotic
sleep reaching 100% of animals after 5-6 h of the anesthesia
(Figure 1(a)). Similar observations were made upon histo-
pathological examination of corneal samples obtained from
animals
exposed
to
1 h,
3 h,
and
6 h
of
anesthesia
(Figure 1(b), Table 2), while in control rabbits, the cornea
displayed normal structure (Figure 1(b), A, E), and in 1 h
anesthetized animals, it exhibited a loss of superficial epithe-
lial layer as well as coagulation, desquamation, and shedding
of the squamous cells (Figure 1(b), B, F). Exposure to 3 h
anesthesia resulted in focally more extensive corneal injuries
such as degenerative and necrobiotic alterations in outer
wing cells denuded after superficial cell loss (Figure 1(b), C,
G). These multifocal epithelial defects included cytoplasmic
changes (swelling and lightening) and nuclear changes
(enlargement and lightening) (Figure 1(b), G, arrows), that
corresponded to typical hydropic degeneration [40]. In some
cases, the injured wing cells were separated from the inner
layers with only one layer of degenerating basal cells remain-
ing at the damaged locus (Figure 1(b), H, asterisk). After 6 h
of anesthesia, the corneal injuries became much more severe
and diffused (Figure 1(b), D). Hydropic cell degeneration was
more pronounced and detected in both wing and basal cells
(Figure 1(b), I). Furthermore, progressive cell loss was
accompanied by signs of apoptosis that include cell shrink-
age, chromatin condensation, nuclear changes (pyknosis or
karyorrhexis), dense staining, and the formation of apoptotic
bodies (Figure 1(b), I-J, arrows). In addition, separated cells
at different morphological stages of necrotic (Figure 1(b), L,
asterisk) or apoptotic (Figure 1(b), M, arrows) cell death were
found. Full-thickness epithelial damage resulted in the dis-
ruption of basal cell adhesion to the basal lamina, total loss
of epithelial layer, and denudation of underlying stroma
(Figure 1(b), N). The most pronounced areas of denudation
in 6 h treated animals were more than 1 mm in diameter
(Figure 1(b), D). Overall, by the end of 3–6 h general
anesthesia, the full-scaled pathomorphological picture of
DES was developed in the majority of the animals. Consider-
ing that exposure to anesthesia of similar duration reduces
tear secretion significantly [6], the condition developed
after 6 h narcosis was recognized as a model of severe
DES, which is feasible for the proper trialing of the pro-
posed antioxidant therapy.
3.3. Efficacy, Dosage, and Administration Scheme for SkQ1 in
Treatment of General Anesthesia-Induced DES. To assess the
efficacy of SkQ1 eye drops for the treatment of anesthesia-
induced DES, the experimental animals were treated accord-
ing to the following alternative schemes. The animals were
either premedicated using instillations of SkQ1 at a concen-
tration of 0.25, 2.5, or 7.5 μM prior to induction of DES or
medicated with the same dosage of the antioxidant starting
immediately after narcosis and continuing during one month
after the induction of the disease. In both cases, the clinical
state of the cornea was examined by fluorescein test immedi-
ately after the narcosis and on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 30th
days of the subsequent time period. In addition, some of the
animals were withdrawn right after the anesthesia (for pre-
medicated groups) or on the 14th day of the postanesthetic
period (for treated groups) for histological and biochemical
studies of the cornea. As it can be seen from Figure 2(a),
SkQ1 premedication had a pronounced protective effect on
the cornea that was enhanced with an increase of the drug
dosage. Thus, 7.5 μM SkQ1 prevented pathological changes
in the cornea after recovering from the narcosis and
completely neutralized clinical signs of DES as early as the
first day of the postanesthetic period. By contrast, the treat-
ment by the antioxidant after the induction of DES was less
effective and less dose-dependent, although a complete
recovery of the corneal injuries was also accelerated becom-
ing reduced to one week (Figure 2(b)). These observations
are generally in accord with the results of histological exam-
ination of the corneas (Figure 2(c)). Thus, in contrast to the
untreated animals (Figure 2(b), B-C), the animals premedi-
cated with eye drops containing different concentrations of
SkQ1 exhibited no foci of total destruction of the epithelium
by the end of the anesthesia (Figure 2(c), D–I). Moreover, no
prenecrotic and necrotic changes and no cells with enlarged
and enlightened cytoplasm were found in such animals.
The minor changes in this case included the presence of
single apoptotic cells (Figure 2(c), C–F) and consequent
reduction of corneal epithelium thickness in some areas
(Figure 2(c)). The least decrease of the epithelium thickness
was found following administration of 7.5 μM SkQ1

 (Figure 2(c), H-I). By contrast, in the animals medicated with
the same dosage of SkQ1 after anesthesia, the morphology
of the corneal epithelium returned to the normal state
only at the fourteenth day of the postanesthetic period
(Figure 2(d), K-L). It should be added that by that
time the signs of active reepithelialization were absent,
assuming that this process was already completed.
We concluded that SkQ1 possesses a positive effect on
corneal state and that this effect is more pronounced when
the drug is administrated prior to anesthesia-induced DES.
Thus, SkQ1 more likely exhibits protective action on healthy
corneal epithelium, rather than participate in the corneal
wound healing. Since the most prominent protective effect
was observed in the case of premedication using 7.5 μM
SkQ1, this dosage and administration scheme was considered
optimal for reproducing in subsequent experiments.
3.4. Oxidative and Antioxidant State of the Cornea in
General Anesthesia-Induced DES with or without SkQ1
Premedication. The simple explanation of the revealed
positive
effect
of
SkQ1
premedication
in
anesthesia-
induced DES was its direct antioxidant action on corneal
epithelial cells. With that in mind, we compared oxidative
stress and intrinsic antioxidant activity in the corneas of
the control and SkQ1-premedicated animals. Without pre-
medication, the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA)
in corneal homogenates increased noticeably with the
duration of anesthesia reaching more than 10-fold excess
by the 6th hour of the narcosis (Figure 3). By contrast,
the antioxidant premedication using 7.5 μM SkQ1 attenu-
ated the increase in the MDA concentration after 6 h anes-
thesia by 50%. This effect can be partially associated with
an increase in the antioxidant protection in the cornea
due to its amelioration by the drug action. Indeed, without
antioxidant treatment, the animals with anesthesia-induced
DES exhibited no noticeable changes in AOA, SOD activ-
ity, and glutathione-metabolizing enzymes (GR and GPx)
in corneal extracts (Figures 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), and 3(e)).
An exception was the growth of GST activity that may
be related to the detoxification of the injected anesthetic
(Figure 3(f)). By contrast, the animals premedicated with
7.5 μM SkQ1 demonstrated a significant increase in activ-
ities of GR and GPx, which were higher than the respec-
tive values registered both in the animals with untreated
DES (Figures 3(d) and 3(e)). In the case of GPx, the effect
was the most pronounced reaching a 5–10-fold excess of the
baseline control value (Figure 3(e)). Finally, the increase in
GST activity was attenuated in the cornea of SkQ1-treated
animals (Figure 3(f)). Thus, the anesthesia-induced DES
was associated with oxidative stress of the corneal cells with-
out a compensatory increase in their own antioxidant protec-
tion. Under these conditions, SkQ1 possessed prominent

 protective activity both by inhibiting oxidative stress in the
cornea and upregulating its intrinsic antioxidant defense
enzymes, foremost GPx and GR.
3.5. Tear Secretion and Stability in General Anesthesia-
Induced DES with or without SkQ1 Premedication. In addition
to the direct effect on the corneal cells, SkQ1 may positively
affect tear-producing ocular tissues and improve tear quantity
and/or quality thereby producing the revealed protective
effect on the cornea. To test this suggestion, we further exam-
ined the effect of premedication using 7.5 μM SkQ1 on the tear
secretion and stability in rabbits with anesthesia-induced DES
by means of standardized Schirmer’s and BUT tests, respec-
tively. Exposure of the animals to general anesthesia for 6 h
resulted in 2.3-fold reduction of their tear secretion, which
returned to the normal values by 12h of the postanesthetic
period regardless of SkQ1 administration (Figure 4(a)).
Meanwhile, the decrease in tear stability in the control
animals recovered much slower (48 h), whereas the antioxi-
dant premedication significantly accelerated the recovery
(Figure 4(b)). Thus, SkQ1 had no effect on the tear secretion,
but may alter tear composition thereby increasing stability
and protective features of the tear film.
3.6. Antioxidant Activity of the Tear Fluid in General
Anesthesia-Induced DES with or without SkQ1 Premedication.
As the next step, we monitored the effect of SkQ1 on
antioxidant properties of the tear in the animals with
anesthesia-induced DES. Tear samples were collected from
control and 7.5 μM SkQ1-premedicated rabbits prior to 6-
hour general anesthesia, immediately after the recovery from
narcosis or following 1 hour, 24 hours, 3 days, 1 week, or 2
weeks of the postanesthetic period. It was found that the
development of the corneal injury in the control animals
was associated with a pronounced decrease in AOA and
the activity of antioxidant enzymes in their tear fluid. In
such self-limited DES, these parameters restored only in
1-2 weeks after the narcosis (Figure 5). The premedication
using SkQ1-containing eye drops had no effect on the
total protein concentration in tears (data not shown),
but it accelerated significantly the normalization of AOA
and SOD activities (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Indeed, in
the SkQ1-treated animals, these parameters returned to
their baseline values as early as the first day of the post-
anesthetic period. Thus, the revealed therapeutic action of
SkQ1 in anesthesia-induced DES may include protection
of the tear-producing tissues and associated improvement
of the antioxidant activity of the tear film.
3.7. Inflammatory Cytokines of Tear Fluid in General
Anesthesia-Induced DES with or without SkQ1 Premedication.
It is widely regarded that DES pathogenesis involves
inflammatory component [9, 39]. The oxidative stress of
the cornea detected in our DES model can induce inflam-
matory responses of the ocular surface tissues [41] that
may be sensitive to SkQ1 action. To test this assumption,
we examined profiles of the common tear cytokines in
the 6h anesthetized rabbits with or without premedication
using 7.5 μM SkQ1 (Figure 6). Approximately a 2-fold
increase in proinflammatory cytokines was observed in the
control animals with DES, namely, the fast growth of
TNF-α concentration (within 6 hours) followed by the
delayed growth in IL-6 (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). These
effects were associated with a prominent reduction in
anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 (Figures 6(c)
and 6(d)). Without treatment, TNF-α and IL-4 restored
to their normal levels within 1h and 1 day, respectively
(Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). In contrast, premedication using
7.5 μM SkQ1 considerably suppressed the release of both

 proinflammatory cytokines and accelerated the recovery of
IL-4. Interestingly, it produced a pronounced stimulatory
effect on the secretion of IL-10, the concentration of which
reached ~550% of the normal value within an hour after
anesthesia (Figure 6(d)). Overall, the protective effect of
SkQ1 may involve the inhibition of inflammatory responses
of the ocular surface via suppression of the preceding oxi-
dative stress and/or by specific overstimulation of secretion
of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

The goal of this study was to determine the safety, efficacy, and
optimal dosage regimen of administration of mitochondria-
targeted antioxidant SkQ1 for prevention and treatment of
DES and to suggest cellular and biochemical mechanisms
underlying therapeutic action of SkQ1. To this end, it was
necessary to monitor alterations in morphological and bio-
chemical properties of the cornea, as well as biochemical

 and biomechanical parameters of tears, under the course of
the disease. However, performing these experiments in
humans was hindered by limited availability of the patients
for ophthalmological examination and by impossibility of
obtaining the required tissue samples. Considering these
limitations, we employed the rabbit model of the disease
since these species share many features of ocular anatomy
with humans including eyeball size, its internal structure,
and optical system as well as biomechanical and biochemical
features [42]. DES was simulated in rabbits by their exposure
to general anesthesia [6, 39, 41]. Indeed, anesthetic injections
are known to inhibit lacrimal gland innervations and sup-
press tear production [43]. These complications are often
observed in humans during and after surgery, leading to
manifestation of iatrogenic corneal lesions or so-called
perioperative DES. Yet, the exposure of rabbits to general
anesthesia resulted in the development of the majority of
symptoms characteristic of common age-related DES, which
makes such a model appropriate for testing general
approaches to treatment of this disorder [5].

 animals. According to the histological study, they were
caused generally by cell desquamation or degeneration, cell
death (necrotic and apoptotic variants), and separation of
the dying cells from the basement membrane. The injuries
exhibited as marked attenuation or thinning of epithelium
or its total loss (denudation) [34]. However, they did not
extend into the stroma thereby representing corneal abra-
sion (erosion), but not corneal ulcer [44]. The signs of
apoptotic and necrotic cell death were detected in middle
and deep layers of corneal epithelium most commonly after
6 h of general anesthesia. By this time, the animals addition-
ally exhibited alterations in biochemical properties of tears,
in particular, decline of redox status and anti-inflammatory
qualities of the tear film and loss of its stability. Thus, after
6 h of general anesthesia, the full-scale picture of DES, simi-
lar to the one found in patients [45], can be observed in
experimental animals. These results provided the rationale
for using this model in the treatment studies.
Like most age-related disorders, DES is associated with
development of oxidative stress, which makes antioxidant
therapy a favorable approach to its treatment. The feasibility
of such strategy was demonstrated previously in both exper-
imental models and clinical studies with a wide range of anti-
oxidants, including alpha-lipoic acid, blueberry components,
essential omega-3 fatty acids, L-carnitine, and selenium
compounds [14–19]. However, despite their therapeutical
efficiency, these chemicals have a common limitation,
namely, their inability to suppress ROS formation in mito-
chondria [22]. In addition to providing cells with energy,
the mitochondria take part in the regulation of many sig-
naling cascades, triggered by the oxidative stress, and
remain as the major source of ROS [46]. Correspondingly,
in many disorders and pathological syndromes, the mito-
chondria are viewed as attractive targets for therapy [47–49].
Since mitochondria are impermeable to natural (conven-
tional) antioxidants, two novel approaches to their targeting
were developed recently [23–25]. Firstly, specific peptide
structures were designed to penetrate into mitochondria
thereby delivering protein-based antioxidants. Secondly,
membrane-permeable cations were created to transport low
molecular weight antioxidants to these organelles. The latter
compounds demonstrated their efficacy in, for instance, pre-
venting ROS-induced modifications of cardiolipin, the key
phospholipid component of mitochondria and a common
target of oxidation [50, 51]. In the current study, we used
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 (10-(6′-plastoqui-
nonyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium), which was designed
previously using the second approach. It is comprised of nat-
urally occurring antioxidant plastoquinone, conjugated with
transport molecule triphenylphosphonium, which ensures
the penetration of the drug into the cell and its accumulation
in the mitochondria [23].
All mitochondria-targeted antioxidants developed so far,
including SkQ1, are purely synthetic with no natural ana-
logues. As such, it is important to examine thoroughly their
toxicological properties before administering them to the
patients. It is known that topical application of pharmaceuti-
cals typically excludes unwanted systemic effects on the
organism. In ophthalmology, this can be achieved by using
eye drops. Our safety tests reveal that 3 instillations of
SkQ1 per day are well tolerated in animals when concentra-
tion of the antioxidant did not exceed 7.5 μM, which was
recognized as the maximum admissible dose. We further
demonstrated protective activity of SkQ1 towards the cornea
in anesthesia-induced DES on clinical and morphological
levels. The premedication with SkQ1 produced dose-
dependent effects in the 0.25–7.5 μM range. Consistently,
dose-dependence of SkQ1 action was demonstrated in
patients with polyetiological DES [27, 28]. It is noteworthy
that SkQ1 had poor dose-dependency when used in treat-
ment after anesthesia. Apparently, premedication with
higher dose of the antioxidant results in its faster and more
effective accumulation in the cornea, which is less essential
in the case of continuous long-term treatment. Overall,
regular prophylactic instillations of 7.5 μM SkQ1 can be con-
sidered as safe and effective preventive care strategy for DES.
As the next step, we attempted to specify cellular and bio-
chemical mechanisms underlying therapeutic action of SkQ1
in DES. Our histological studies demonstrated that premedi-
cation with the antioxidant prevented corneal injury by inhi-
biting necrotic, prenecrotic, and apoptotic changes in the
corneal epithelium. The similar protective activity of SkQ1
was demonstrated for a number of tissues. For instance, it
exhibited a noticeable protective effect on heart and kidney
infarction caused by ischemia/reperfusion, as well as on
ischemic stroke or renal failure [52, 53]. In addition, antia-
poptotic activity of SkQ1 towards neurons was demonstrated
in the models of Alzheimer’s disease and age-related retinop-
athy [54–57]. The simplest possible explanation of the
protective effect of SkQ1 on the cornea is that its accumula-
tion in the mitochondria of corneal epitheliocytes suppresses
generation of ROS and propagation of oxidative stress.
Indeed, the application of SkQ1 reduced the amount of mal-
ondialdehyde in corneal homogenates indicating decrease of
oxidative stress in the cornea. Unexpectedly, SkQ1 also stim-
ulated intrinsic antioxidant defense of this tissue. Two major
antioxidant systems are distinguished in the cornea and other
tissues. Nonenzymatic antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E)
can provide direct protection from oxidative damage and
enhance endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity via syner-
gic scavenging of free radicals [58]. Enzymatic antioxidant
system is comprised of superoxide dismutases (cytoplasmic
Cu/Zn-SOD (SOD1) and mitochondrial Mn-SOD (SOD2)),
catalase, glutathione peroxidases (GPx), and glutathione
reductase (GR) [59]. SOD reduces superoxide radicals to
hydrogen peroxide, which is decomposed into oxygen and
water by catalase or (with oxidation of glutathione) by GPx.
Inactivation of these enzymes leads to accumulation of per-
oxide and its eventual conversion into highly toxic hydroxyl
radical. Finally, GR is able to reduce oxidized glutathione,
replenishing its necessary pool [60–63]. We have found that
premedication with SkQ1 increases GPx and GR levels in
the cornea, while having almost no effect on low molecular
antioxidant activity (AOA) and SOD activity in this tissue.
It should be mentioned that anesthetic conditions by them-
selves did not cause alterations in GPx and GR activity and
the observed trends might be attributed to SkQ1 treatment.
The obtained data agree with the effect of another
13
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
 mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ, which was dem-
onstrated to induce GPx1 expression in vitro in leukocytes
isolated from the second-type diabetic patients [64]. Yet,
our data is the first demonstration of such effect of
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant in vivo. Overall, applica-
tion of SkQ1 provides dual action on corneal state in DES
by both neutralizing ROS directly and enforcing the key
elements of the antioxidant defense.
Normal maintenance of the ocular surface relies on the
tear film, which prevents the cornea from desiccative stress
and infection and provides it with nourishing and antioxi-
dant compounds [65]. Consistently, in our previous studies,
we have shown that development of anesthesia-induced
DES in experimental animals is accompanied by a decline
in tear film stability as well as by reduction in its antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory activity [6]. Such alterations were
found in patients with DES and suggested to play the key role
in its pathogenesis [10]. Remarkably, administration of SkQ1
in general anesthesia-induced DES not only affected cornea
state but also improved tear qualities. In particular, it attenu-
ated a decline in total AOA and SOD. Meanwhile, no
substantial change in GPx and GR activities was observed,
in contrast to the alterations observed in the cornea. This
divergence can be tied to the fact that the antioxidant compo-
nents accumulate in corneal tissue and tear fluid via distinct
mechanisms. In particular, SOD and low molecular antioxi-
dants are secretable compounds therefore entering tear fluid
[58]. It is known that DES can be induced by denervation of
the lacrimal glands, which resembles the effect of anesthetic
on their activity [66, 67]. Thus, exposure to anesthesia likely
results in fast suppression of lacrimal gland function, conse-
quent alteration of tear biochemistry, and development of
DES symptoms. Consistently, SOD content in tears and
intrinsic antioxidant activity of the tear fluid would be highly
sensitive to protective action of SkQ1 on tear-producing
glands. On the other hand, GPx and GR are predominantly
intracellular proteins [68, 69] and their alterations in tears
as a result of antioxidant premedication would be less notice-
able, which agrees with our results. As for the cornea, the
activities GPx and GR have been found in both corneal
epithelium and endothelium [68, 69], and in our records,
these enzymes become specifically upregulated within
these cells under the SkQ1 action via a mechanism that
is yet to be specified.
Apart from the improvement of tear antioxidant status,
SkQ1 suppressed the development of proinflammatory reac-
tions of the eye surface detectable in tears. In particular, the
premedication averted completely acute elevation of TNF-α
and delayed growth in IL-6 content, as well as promoted
accumulation of anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 in tear
fluid. Interestingly, the concentration of IL-10 increased
more than 5-fold indicating a specific effect of SkQ1 on
its expression/secretion. The revealed anti-inflammatory
potential of SkQ1 agrees with its ability to prevent TNF-
α-induced ICAM-1 overexpression in endothelium in vitro
and in vivo and with its therapeutic effect in the case of var-
ious inflammatory disorders. Furthermore, similar antioxi-
dant MitoQ mitigated symptoms of experimental colitis,
which is governed, at least partially, by the prevention of
IL-1β and IL-18 release [70]. In our case, anti-inflammatory
effect may be associated with the upregulation of IL-10 by
SkQ1. Indeed, overexpression of IL-10 was beneficial in
treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases such as herpetic
keratitis [71]. Furthermore, IL-10 is known to antagonize
proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α [72]. The
latter is widely regarded as a master cytokine, downregu-
lating of which would generally inhibit proinflammatory
signaling [73].
The
described
increase
in
antioxidant
and
anti-
inflammatory activity in the presence of SkQ1 agrees with
our observations that premedication accelerates substantially
tear film recovery. Given the fact that SkQ1 does not affect
tear production, it can be suggested that the premedication
generally improved biochemical properties of the tear film.
Since the latter is produced by lacrimal and meibomian
glands, as well as goblet cells of conjunctiva [65], it is possible
that SkQ1 protects these tissues from the oxidative stress.
Consistently, our preliminary results indicated positive effect
of SkQ1 on clinical condition of conjunctiva of rabbits with
anesthesia-associated DES (data not shown).
Taken together, our results demonstrate safety and effi-
cacy of 7.5 μM SkQ1 eye drop administration for prevention
and treatment of DES. Such medication can be recom-
mended for the patients and individuals at risk for the
disease, including elderly people and those who were sub-
jected to general anesthesia. In addition, our findings provide
better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms that
are susceptible to antioxidant treatment in DES. These
mechanisms include oxidative stress and inflammation that
manifested in the cornea and tear film and resulted in
apoptotic and necrotic changes in the corneal epithelium.
SkQ1 and probably other mitochondria-targeted antioxi-
dants can be used to suppress effectively these degenerative
processes. Finally, we described novel qualities of SkQ1, such
as its ability to upregulate antioxidant enzymes and anti-
inflammatory cytokines. These data point to the feasibility
of SkQ1 for treatment of various ocular surface pathologies
different from DES, such as trauma, corneal erosions, and
ulcers, as well as inflammatory disorders of the cornea and
other eye tissues.
