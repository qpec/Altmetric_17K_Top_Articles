Summary
Background Low birthweight (LBW) of less than 2500 g is an important marker of maternal and fetal health, predicting 
mortality, stunting, and adult-onset chronic conditions. Global nutrition targets set at the World Health Assembly in 
2012 include an ambitious 30% reduction in LBW prevalence between 2012 and 2025. Estimates to track progress 
towards this target are lacking; with this analysis, we aim to assist in setting a baseline against which to assess 
progress towards the achievement of the World Health Assembly targets.
Methods We sought to identify all available LBW input data for livebirths for the years 2000–16. We considered 
population-based national or nationally representative datasets for inclusion if they contained information on 
birthweight or LBW prevalence for livebirths. A new method for survey adjustment was developed and used. For 
57 countries with higher quality time-series data, we smoothed country-reported trends in birthweight data by use of 
B-spline regression. For all other countries, we estimated LBW prevalence and trends by use of a restricted maximum 
likelihood approach with country-level random effects. Uncertainty ranges were obtained through bootstrapping. 
Results were summed at the regional and worldwide level.
Findings We collated 1447 country-years of birthweight data (281 million births) for 148 countries of 195 UN member 
states (47 countries had no data meeting inclusion criteria). The estimated worldwide LBW prevalence in 2015 was 
14·6% (uncertainty range [UR] 12·4–17·1) compared with 17·5% (14·1–21·3) in 2000 (average annual reduction rate 
[AARR] 1·23%). In 2015, an estimated 20·5 million (UR 17·4–24·0 million) livebirths were LBW, 91% from low-and-
middle income countries, mainly southern Asia (48%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%).
Interpretation Although these estimates suggest some progress in reducing LBW between 2000 and 2015, achieving 
the 2·74% AARR required between 2012 and 2025 to meet the global nutrition target will require more than doubling 
progress, involving both improved measurement and programme investments to address the causes of LBW 
throughout the lifecycle.

Introduction
Low birthweight (LBW) is defined as a birthweight below 
2500 g regardless of gestational age1 and is usually applied 
to livebirths only. LBW includes both appropriately grown 
preterm neonates (<37 completed weeks of gestation) 
and term and preterm growth-restricted neonates 
(<10th centile of weight for gestational age and sex) but 
remains an important public health indicator, especially 
in settings where accurate gestational age assessment is 
not possible.2 LBW is a substantial public health problem 
in every country, associated with a range of both short-
term and long-term consequences affecting human 
capital.3 More than 80% of neonatal deaths are in LBW 
newborns, of which two thirds are preterm and one third 
are term small-for-gestational-age.3–6 LBW newborns also 
have a higher risk of morbidity, stunting in childhood, 
and long-term developmental and physical ill health 
including adult-onset chronic conditions such as 
cardiovascular disease.7–10 Factors influencing LBW 
include extremes of maternal age (especially younger 
than 16 years of age or older than 40 years), multiple 
pregnancy, obstetric complications, chronic maternal 
conditions (eg, hypertensive disorders of preg 
nancy), 
infections (eg, malaria), and nutritional status.11–14 Other 
contributors include exposure to environ 
mental factors, 
such as indoor air pollution, and tobacco and drug use.15
In 2012, the World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed a 
Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant 
and Young Child Nutrition, which specified six global 
nutrition targets, including a 30% reduction in the 
number of LBW livebirths between 2012 and 2025.16 LBW 
is thus a key indicator of progress towards the achievement

of the global nutrition targets and monitoring LBW 
trends is an essential component of the Global Nutrition 
Monitoring Framework approved by member states at the 
WHA in May, 2015.17 These targets are reiterated in the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Previously, it was estimated that there were 20·6 million 
LBW livebirths in the year 2000;18 however, there are no 
contemporary standardised worldwide, regional, and 
national estimates or systematic trend estimates for 
LBW, which are essential for tracking progress towards 
the global nutrition target. The LBW prevalence and 
trends presented here aim to fill this gap and assist in 
setting the baseline against which to assess progress 
towards the achievement of the WHA targets.
Methods
Overview
Our study was a systematic analysis of livebirth LBW 
input data from national administrative sources and 
nationally representative surveys. We sought to identify 
all available LBW input data for livebirths. We accessed 
data that met preset inclusion criteria, and implemented 
data preprocessing steps, including adjustments to raw 
data where applicable, to calculate an LBW prevalence 
from each datapoint—ie, the number of livebirths 
(regardless of the gestational age) with a birthweight of 
less than 2500 g divided by the total number of liveborn 
babies who are weighed or for whom a birthweight could 
be imputed. Finally, we estimated the LBW prevalence 
for 195 countries for the years 2000–15 and summed the 
results to obtain regional and global estimates. We report 
national-level estimates for 148 countries with data 
meeting our inclusion criteria. We present our methods 
in a manner that follows the Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
checklist, which promotes transparency, including the 
sharing of input data and modelling code (appendix).16
Input data
Figure 1 summarises the administrative and survey 
data inputs and estimation methods. We considered 
population-based national or nationally representative 
datasets for inclusion if they contained information on 
birthweight or LBW prevalence for livebirths (appendix). 
Nationally representative estimates of LBW prevalence 
can be derived from a range of sources, broadly defined 
as administrative data or representative household 
surveys. National administrative data are defined as data 
from national systems including Civil Registration and 
Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems, national Health 
Management Information Systems (HMISs), and birth 
registries. Nationally representative household surveys 
include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs), 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs), and other 
national surveys.
The optimal data source is a CRVS system that records 
details on all births, including their birthweight, on a 
continuous basis.19 Where all newborns are weighed 
accurately at birth, birthweight is recorded, registration 
is complete, and the system functions efficiently, the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Low birthweight (LBW; <2500 g), a composite measure of fetal 
growth and gestational length, is an important indicator of 
maternal and perinatal health and a predictor of adverse 
short-term and long-term health outcomes. LBW is a key 
outcome in global nutrition targets. However, LBW data from 
administrative data sources have not been systematically 
collated, existing methods for adjusting survey LBW data are 
recognised to have several limitations, and no standardised, 
systematic estimates for LBW prevalence have been produced.
Added value of this study
Through systematic searches (eg, of national statistical offices, 
ministry of health websites, and websites of the major household 
survey programmes of Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and 
Demographic and Health surveys), we compiled a global LBW 
dataset (1447 datapoints from 148 countries). New methods to 
adjust survey data were developed with UNICEF. We estimate that 
20·5 million (uncertainty range 17·4–24·0) livebirths had a 
birthweight of less than 2500 g in 2015. Most (91%) were in 
low-income and middle-income countries, with nearly 
three-quarters in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Reported 
data from 57 mostly high-income countries with relatively low 
baseline suggests almost no change in LBW prevalence. For the 
remaining countries, we estimate a 17% reduction in LBW 
prevalence over the years 2000–15, most notably in the countries 
with the highest LBW prevalence in 2000. Globally, the annual 
rate of reduction in LBW from 2000 to 2015 was 1·23%.
Implications of all the available evidence
Data meeting inclusion criteria were available for three quarters 
of all UN member states, with survey data remaining the 
primary source in low-income and middle-income countries 
and administrative data the major source in high-income 
countries. Data adhering to the inclusion criteria were not 
available for 47 countries. Closing this data gap is an important 
priority. Data quality remains a concern, with evidence of 
missing birthweights and heaping. Our methods attempt to 
correct for heaping in survey data, but correction was not 
possible for administrative data. To increase data quality and 
availability, every newborn, whether live or stillborn, must be 
weighed, and data systems improved to capture the 
birthweight of every newborn, including those at home or in 
private facilities. Rates of LBW reduction worldwide will need to 
more than double to reach the annual rate of reduction of 
2·74% required to meet the ambitious global nutrition target of 
30% reduction of LBW by 2025. Action is required both to 
tackle the underlying causes of LBW and to improve the data.

resulting LBW prevalence will be accurate and timely. 
However, existing administrative data systems might not 
cover all births, or might not collect birthweight data at 
all. In these settings, household surveys, such as the 
UNICEF-supported MICS and the USAID-supported 
DHS are important data sources for estimates of child 
health, including LBW, but are recognised to have biases. 
These data systems rely on accurate birthweight measure-
ment, but despite increasing prevalence of facility births, 
many newborns are not weighed, and when weighed, so-
called heaping at specific birthweights (eg, multiples of 
100 g or 500 g) is common. We excluded subnational or 
other non-population-based data such as those from 
demographic surveillance sites and individual hospital 
data from the LBW data searches as they are rarely 
nationally representative.
To identify national administrative data, we searched 
the websites of the national statistical offices (NSOs) and 
ministries of health of all countries. Data from years 
2000–16 were included. For countries with more than 
one source of national administrative data available for a 
given year, we gave preference to NSO website data 
where available. Where NSO data were unavailable, we 
used data obtained from the Ministry of Health website. 
We used WHO regional databases and a UNICEF 
database (TRANSOMNEE)20 to identify countries with 
national administrative data not retrieved through initial 
searches. These data were only included if they contained 
a reference to their source or could be verified as national 
administrative data from the NSO or Ministry of Health. 
Where necessary we contacted WHO and UNICEF 
regional and country offices to request further details of 
data sources.
We obtained datasets for all DHSs and MICSs with a 
midpoint of data collection of 1998 or later, and for which 
raw datasets were publicly available and contained 
birthweight data.21–23 A national team from the China 
Health Information and Statistics Center of the National 
Health Commission reanalysed data from the Chinese 
National Health Services Surveys. If data were available 
from both national administrative or nationally repres-
entative surveys for a given country, all data meeting the 
inclusion criteria were included in the database and 
subsequent modelling process.
Where no national administrative or nationally 
representative survey data were readily available through 
web-based searches, we contacted UNICEF and WHO 
regional and country offices in September–December, 
2014, and again in autumn 2015 and invited them to 
provide details of any available national LBW data.
From October, 2017, to January, 2018, we did a joint 
WHO–UNICEF country consultation process to enable 
each country to provide feedback on the LBW input data 
used, modelling methods, and preliminary estimates for 
their country. We received further data from 55 countries 
through the consultation process, resulting in 341 new or 
updated country-year observations.
Exclusions based on population representativeness at a 
national level
We excluded national administrative data covering less 
than 80% of the population, or from countries with less 
than 80% facility births in the data source year or 
less than 80% of the UN estimated livebirths in a given 
year. We also excluded survey data that were not 
nationally representative, as well as those with less than 
30% weighed at birth. We applied a lower threshold 
for coverage of livebirths weighed to surveys (≥30%) 
compared with administrative data sources (≥80%) 
because raw data are available for surveys, allowing 
multiple imputation of missing birthweights by use of 
other covariates from the survey. This was not possible 
for data from administrative sources.
Data quality assessment
We identified several potential sources of bias in LBW 
data sources (table 1). These include errors in birthweight 
measurement and recording (including heaping of 
recorded birthweights on 2500 g), misclassification 
between livebirths and stillbirths, missing birthweight 
data, and, for administrative data, non-representativeness 
at national level of births captured in the data sys-
tem. Overall, these biases are likely to result in an 
underestimate of LBW prevalence. We took a two-step 
approach to seek to adjust for possible biases. First, we

of extreme heaping around three values, nine because more than 10% of births weighed at least 4500 g, one because

did a quality assessment of all the available data. Second, 
where possible, we adjusted included data.
Raw individual-level data were available from house-
hold surveys as the datasets are in the public domain, 
allowing analysis of data quality and recording errors. 
We excluded surveys with inadequate data quality in 
three areas as follows. First, implausible birthweight 
distribution defined as extreme heaping whereby more 
than 55% of all birthweights in the dataset fall on only 
three values (eg, >55% of birthweights in the dataset 
were 2500 g, 3000 g, or 3500 g); more than 10% of births 
weighed at least 4500 g; or excessive heaping on the tail 
end of the birthweight distribution with more than 5% of 
birthweights at 250–500 g and 5500 g. Second, inability 
to obtain from adjustment procedures of multiple 
imputation or fitting of a mixture of two normal curves, 
or both. Third, data from surveys with very low numbers 
of livebirths weighed (<200) and hence high stochastic 
variation.
We made no further categorisation of data quality 
among included surveys. We made adjustments to the 
data from nationally representative household surveys by 
use of a revised methodology to seek to overcome the 
limitations of the previously used approach to address 
missing birthweights and heaping. We implemented 
a modelling approach that comprised multiple impu-
tation with individually linked variables for all surveys 
(appendix). We replicated multiple imputations five times 
per survey and used several variables related to 
birthweight available in the survey datasets, including 
maternal factors (height, body-mass index [BMI], and 
parity), and newborn factors (sex, singleton–multiple 
status, and perceived size at birth).
To address heaping, we fitted a mixture of two normal 
distributions to each survey dataset. Whereas previous 
studies have found that, under ideal conditions such as 
low-risk full-term singleton livebirths included in the 
WHO child growth standards, birthweight is approxi-
mately normally distributed,24 this assumption might 
not apply to all national populations. We tested this 
assumption in an analysis of high-quality administrative 
data from the USA.25 Fitting a single normal distribution 
to this data from which the proportion of LBW could be 
estimated resulted in an overestimate of the proportion 
of livebirths with LBW compared with the raw data. This 
might indicate that the population of all births comprises 
two or more subpopulations with different distributions. 
Fitting a mixture of two normal distributions resulted in 
an estimated proportion of LBW very close to that seen in 
the raw data. We also investigated fitting a mixture of 
three normal distributions. However, this did not sub-
stantially improve the estimate of the proportion of LBW.
In summary, we estimated the proportion of LBW 
livebirths from each survey by the use of five steps. First, 
we developed five datasets that had a birthweight for each 
livebirth (reported where available or imputed). Second, 
we fitted two normal distributions to the datasets. Third, 
we calculated the LBW Z score for each of the two normal 
distributions:
Fourth, we estimated the percentage of LBW (LBW[%]) 
for each of the two distribution curves:
(ie, the percentage of the area under the curve <Z2500). 
Finally, we estimated the overall LBW prevalence by 
calculating the LBW(%) of the full dataset, which was a 
weighted average of the LBW(%) from both curves. The 
weights used were based on the proportion of the 
population estimated to belong to each subpopulation.
Since data from administrative data sources in the 
public domain usually only provide an aggregate number 
Likely effect on LBW 
prevalence estimates*
Coverage of weighing: bias in newborns weighed at birth
Many newborns in LMICs are not weighed at birth, especially if born at home. These 
are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged and at higher risk of LBW.
↓
Extremely preterm or sick babies, those stillborn or dying soon after birth and 
those born around threshold of viability are the most likely to not be weighed. 
These babies are at high risk of being LBW.
↓
Coverage of data system: bias in newborns included in data source
Low coverage of administrative data systems in many LMICs (eg, lower coverage of 
birth registration for those who die shortly after birth, missing home births, 
and births in private facilities even if weighed). Births in private facilities are more 
likely to be socioeconomically advantaged and at lower biological risk of LBW; 
however, high prevalence of medical interventions (eg, caesarean sections both 
indicated and elective before 37 weeks, may increase risk of LBW).
↓ or ↑
Loss of birthweight data: biases in missing birthweight data†
In surveys, biases in card retention (eg, birthweight not available for babies who 
died who are more likely to have been LBW).
↓
Missing administrative birthweight data on sickest babies (frequently LBW) who 
are transferred immediately to (and weighed in) a newborn ward.
↓
Measurement errors: individual measurement or recording error
Heaping of recording of birthweight on 2500 g. As definition excludes babies with 
birthweight exactly 2500 g, those LBW newborns with birthweight near the 
threshold frequently heaped at 2500 g.
↓
Errors in birthweight measurement (eg, poorly calibrated scales, inappropriate 
devices), suboptimal weighing practices (eg, clothed or delayed weighing until 
days after birth).
↓ or ↑
Extremely preterm or sick babies and those born around threshold of viability who 
die soon after birth are more likely to be misclassified as stillbirth. These babies are 
at high risk of being LBW.
↓
Measurement units error
Confusion in surveys collecting data in both lbs and grams (eg, LBW baby weighing 
4·0 lb recorded as 4·0 kg).
↓
Denominator calculation errors in LBW prevalence calculation
LBW prevalence calculated as: number with birthweight <2500 per all livebirths 
(whether weighed or not).
↓
LBW=low birthweight. *↓=the potential bias is likely to lead to a decreased LBW prevalence. ↑=the potential bias is likely 
to lead to an increased LBW prevalence. †For newborns who are both included in the data source and weighed at birth.

of LBW livebirths—ie, total livebirths or the reported 
LBW prevalence without individual-level data, or both—
it was not possible to adjust LBW estimates to account 
for missing data and heaping in these data. To our 
knowledge, there are no previously used markers of 
data quality specifically for reported aggregated LBW 
prevalence. To assess and categorise the quality of 
available national level routine data, we reviewed 
previously used data quality criteria from other related 
maternal and perinatal global estimation exercises.6,26,27 
Of these, only population representativeness, assessed by 
completeness of birthweight data, was feasible to apply 
(appendix). Datapoints from countries with less than 
80% facility births or reporting a birthweight for less 
than 80% of the UN estimated livebirths in a given year 
were excluded. We further categorised included data into 
higher quality administrative data (data from countries 
with a facility birth prevalence ≥90% and with the data 
source covering ≥90% of UN estimated livebirths in the 
given year) and moderate quality administrative data 
(data from countries with a facility birth prevalence of at 
least 80% and with the data source covering at least 
80% of UN estimated livebirths in the given year, not 
fulfilling higher quality criteria).
Exclusions based on implausibility
We used conservative cutoffs to identify implausible LBW 
data. We excluded datapoints with an LBW prevalence of 
less than 2·1%, on the basis of the lowest population-based 
LBW prevalence in any country from the INTERGROWTH 
study.28 Since the INTERGROWTH study only included 
healthy women at low risk of pregnancy complications, 
including preterm birth and fetal growth restriction, the 
national LBW prevalence for all countries would be 
expected to be substantially higher than this cutoff. For 
example, the lowest national LBW prevalences from 
countries with strong national report 
ing systems are 
around 4%. The highest population-based LBW prevalence 
from any data source was 37%.29 We therefore decided to 
exclude datapoints with LBW prevalence greater than 40%; 
however, no datapoints were excluded on the basis of LBW 
prevalence of more than 40% (figure 1).
Estimation of LBW prevalence by year and country
We defined higher quality time series administrative data 
for LBW prevalence as data from countries with the 
earliest year of data available before 2005, the latest year 
after 2010 with data available for at least half of all years, 
and no evidence of large year-on-year variability in LBW 
prevalence (coefficient of variation <15%). We estimated 
LBW prevalence for all other countries by means of a 
regression model. We modelled the logarithm of LBW 
prevalence as the outcome variable by use of restricted 
maximum likelihood estimation and including a country-
level random effect.
We investigated multiple predictor variables associated 
with LBW, including distal determinants such as 
geographical and socioeconomic factors, more proximal 
demographic and biomedical factors, and markers of 
perinatal outcome (appendix). We included dummy 
variables in the model to account for systematic bias in 
different data types (higher quality national administrative 
data, moderate quality national administrative data, and 
nationally representative survey). We included all potent-
ial predictors with time series data or estimates available 
by country for 2000–15 in the model selection process 
(appendix).
We assessed correlations between predictors by use of 
the variance inflation factor. We dropped predictors with a 
variance inflation factor of greater than 10 as this is likely 
to indicate high correlation with other predictors. We 
retained predictors when the direction of the coefficient 
was biologically plausible. We sought to maximise the 
predictive power of the model, while avoiding overfitting. 
We removed one predictor at a time from the model, 
commencing with the predictor with the largest value of 
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) on univariate 
analysis, and refitted the model. If removing this predictor 
improved the model (lower BIC compared with the model 
containing the predictor), we dropped the predictor from 
the model. If the BIC was higher, we retained the 
predictor. We cycled through all the predictors once.
The final model included the logarithm of neonatal 
mortality rate, the proportion of children underweight 
(below −2SDs from median weight for age of reference 
population), data type (higher quality administrative data, 
lower quality administrative data, household survey), 
UN region (southern Asia, sub-Saharan Africa or other 
region), and a country-specific random effect (table 2). We 
assessed model performance by use of diagnostic plots. 
The model seemed to fit the data reasonably well overall 
(R² = 0·48), and both the estimates of the country-specific 
random effects (SD 0·31) and the residuals for the 
individual datapoints included (SD 0·11) appeared to be 
approximately normally distributed (appendix).
For the 91 countries with data in the input dataset, we 
included the best linear unbiased prediction of the

country-specific effect in the LBW prediction. For 
countries with no data, contributing only to the regional 
and global levels, we assumed the country random 
effect to be zero. We used high-quality national 
administrative data as the reference standard for 
prediction purposes for all countries in the higher-
income regions (North America, Europe, and Australia 
and New Zealand). We used nationally representative 
household surveys as the reference for prediction 
purposes for countries from all other regions. We 
generated uncertainty ranges (URs) for modelled 
estimates by use of a bootstrap approach. When 
presenting by region we used an aggregate grouping of 
the United Nations regional subgroups (appendix). To 
obtain worldwide and regional estimates of uncertainty 
we summed the country LBW estimate at worldwide or 
regional level for each of the 1000 samples obtained 
from the bootstrap or B-spline approach and used the 
2·5th and 97·5th centiles of the resulting distributions 
(appendix). Analyses were done with Stata 14.
We used livebirth estimates from the World Population 
Prospects: the 2017 revision30 to estimate the absolute 
number of LBW livebirths (livebirths × low birthweight 
rate) in a given year. LBW estimates generated from all 
195 countries contributed to the regional and global 
estimates. National-level estimates are presented for the 
57 countries with higher quality time series data and 
91 other countries with at least one LBW prevalence 
datapoint since 2000 meeting the inclusion criteria (total 
148 countries; figure 2; appendix). The modelled national-
level estimate generated is not shown for 47 countries 
without any input data.

Results
Our final dataset was 1447 country-years of birthweight 
data (281 million births), comprised of 1026 high-
coverage and 192 moderate-coverage datapoints from 
administrative data sources and data from 229 surveys 
(figure 1; table 3; appendix). Although data were available 
for 148 countries, most datapoints were categorised 
as national administrative data, predominantly from 
high (65%) or upper middle-income (28%) settings. The 
majority (54%) of LBW datapoints meeting inclusion 
criteria from low-income and lower middle-income 
settings were from household surveys. Countries from 
high-income regions had an average of 13 datapoints

included compared with eight for upper-middle-income, 
four for lower-middle-income, and two for low-income 
regions (appendix). For 47 countries, no data fulfilling 
the inclusion criteria were located.
We estimate that the global LBW prevalence in 2015 
was 14·6% (UR 12·4–17·1), compared with 17·5% 
(14·1–21·3) in 2000 (table 4). This represents an estimated 
16·6% decline in the LBW prevalence over this period 
(average annual rate of reduction [AARR] 1·23%). 
Although the uncertainty around these estimates is 
sizeable, they suggest some reduction in LBW prevalence 
over this time period. The highest burden of LBW is in 
the southern Asian, southeastern Asian, and sub-
Saharan African regions (table 4; figure 3). The estimated 
rate of reduction in LBW prevalence is fastest in the 
regions with the highest baseline LBW prevalence and

slowest in high-income regions and Latin America and 
the Caribbean (table 4; figure 4). In 2015, 85 of the 
148 countries with data had an estimated LBW prevalence 
of less than 10%, whereas six countries were estimated to 
have LBW prevalence of at least 20% (appendix).
The absolute number of livebirths with LBW globally 
is estimated at 20·5 million (UR 17·4–24·0) in 2015 
compared with 22·9 million (18·4–27·8) in 2000 
(figure 4). This represents a 10·6% decline in the point 
estimate against a 7·7% increase in the number of 
livebirths overall during this period. However, in some 
regions, despite reducing LBW prevalence, the overall 
estimated number of LBW livebirths has increased owing 
to demographic trends. In sub-Saharan Africa, the 
number of LBW livebirths is estimated to have increased 
from 4·4 million in 2000 to 5·0 million in 2015 (table 4). 
Southern Asia remains the region with the largest burden 
in terms of numbers, despite progress in reducing LBW 
prevalence (AARR 1·37%). An estimated 9·8 million 
LBW livebirths were born in this region in 2015—nearly 
half (48%) of the worldwide total.
Discussion
We present global, regional, and national estimates for 
LBW with trend estimates, which are essential for 
tracking progress towards the Global Nutrition World 
Health Assembly target regarding LBW. Our estimates 
suggest that 20·5 million (UR 17·4–24·0) livebirths had a 
birthweight of less than 2500 g in 2015. Estimated 
progress in reducing LBW prevalence is slower than that 
required to meet the global nutrition target16—with an 
AARR of 1·23% between 2000 and 2015 compared with 
the required 2·74% between 2012 and 2025 to reach the 
target of a 30% reduction.

A strength of this work is that this LBW dataset is 
the largest compilation to date, including data from 
148 countries and a more than 281 million births. In 
addition to the increased data quantity, we have applied 
new methods to adjust estimates on the basis of survey 
data that are more able to account for both data heaping 
and missing data. However, an important challenge is 
that almost half (48%) of all datapoints are from the high-
income regions of North America, Europe, and Australia 
and New Zealand, which account for 4% of the world’s 
LBW livebirths. By contrast, only 13% of data are from 
sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, the regions with 
the highest LBW prevalence, accounting for nearly 
three quarters of all LBW livebirths in 2015. 47 countries—
the majority (87%) low-income or middle-income—that 
account for 23% of all births worldwide had no data 
meeting inclusion criteria. This is a classic example of 
the inverse data law—the least data for the highest 
burden settings.31 In addition, when available, these data 
tend to be lower quality with more heaping and other 
challenges, which probably lead to underestimates of 
LBW (table 1).
Regarding trends, no high-quality LBW trend data were 
available for 138 countries (91 with some LBW data 
meeting inclusion criteria and 47 without such data), 
and we therefore predicted LBW prevalence by use of a 
statistical model. The regions with the highest estimated 
change in LBW prevalence (and numbers) are sub-Saharan 
Africa and southern Asia, where the data are most 
uncertain and the estimated trends are driven by changes 
in predictors, which might not accurately reflect true 
changes in LBW prevalence over the same time period. 
Hence, it is plausible that the true change in prevalence for 
LBW worldwide is lower than our estimation of 1·23%, 
and the gap to reach the target is even greater.
The LBW data available from the highest burden 
settings are predominantly from household surveys and 
are susceptible to bias owing to missing birthweights and 
heaping. From 2004 to 2017, UNICEF used a simple cross 
tabulation to adjust for missing birthweight by use of data 
from a single variable (perceived size at birth), and a 
crude standard adjustment for heaping that assumed that 
25% of birthweights reported as 2500 g were actually 
below 2500 g in every survey.18,32 This previously used 
method had a number of important limitations.33 Hence, 
we used multiple imputation to impute missing birth-
weights. We used several variables including perceived 
size. We sought to address heaping throughout the 
birthweight distribution by fitting a mixture of two 
normal distributions to the observed data to obtain an 
estimate of the proportion of livebirths with a birthweight 
of less than 2500 g. Although we believe our approach 
represents an advance on the previous method, it does 
require assumptions—namely, that missing birthweights 
are missing at random and that the true distribution of 
birthweights in a population can be well approximated by 
a mixture of two normal distributions.
Although we were able to adjust for heaping in the 
survey data for which we had individual birthweight data, 
we were unable to do so for national administrative data 
sources for which such data were unavailable. This might 
lead to an underestimate of the LBW prevalence from 
these sources when LBW livebirths with birth 
weights of 
less than 2500 g are recorded as (heaped on) 2500 g and 
categorised as normal birthweight.
Global estimates have well recognised limitations,34 and 
investments in data systems are needed to improve 
multicountry tracking of progress towards global targets. 
Large countries, such as India, are taking steps to improve 
the data. However, ongoing efforts are required to support 
countries in strengthening their routine reporting systems 
to 
decrease 
missing 
and 
erroneous 
birthweight 
measurements as part of their commitment to report on 
the Global Nutrition Monitoring Framework and SDGs.17 
Improving measure 
ment of birthweight must occur 
alongside improvements in recording and reporting of all 
birth outcomes for mothers and their newborns, whether 
live or stillborn.35,36 Challenges arising from the low quality 
of some data are compounded by absence of clear, 
internationally harmonised guidelines on how to assess 
LBW data quality.
More than 80% of all births worldwide are now in 
health facilities, yet despite this, most of the included 
datapoints from the highest burden regions are from 
household surveys, often with relatively low proportions 
having a reported birthweight. Improving the coverage 
Potential approaches
Ensure accurate birthweight for all births
Equipment
Improve availability and maintenance of suitable devices for birthweight 
measurement in all locations where births occur (facility or community). 
Establish minimum standards for equipment, including precision and scale type.
Training–human 
resources
Develop and disseminate protocols and guidelines. Preservice and in-service 
birthweight measurement training. Promote culture of weighing all babies 
(including the smallest and sickest). Identify and address barriers to weighing 
(eg, layout, staffing, etc). Improve awareness of clinical and public health 
importance of birthweight (eg, local data use in birthweight specific mortality).
Ensure all birthweights captured in data systems
Data management
Standardise and streamline recording process for clinical staff, reduce repetitive 
recording.
Data coverage
Improve coverage of routine data systems in all facilities (including private) and 
timeliness of reporting. In settings with high rates of home birth, strengthen 
weighing in the community (eg, by CHW or TBA and link to health data system). 
Improve coverage of birth certificates and health cards including birthweight and 
motivate for birthweight to be included on all birth certificates.
Maximise data quality
Data quality
Ensure minimum data collated (including number LBW, number weighed, number 
missing birthweight). Data quality checks and feedback as required. Correct data for 
heaping where required. Promote data literacy so that poor data are recognised and 
improved.
Use data to inform policy
Data use
Improve timely data availability and use at local, district, and national level for 
policy, programming, and practice.

and quality of birthweight data is crucial to drive actions 
to reduce LBW and will require action at many levels of 
the health system (table 5). Closing the gap between 
facility births and accurate birthweight recording should 
be feasible and would transform data availability. At the 
individual clinical level, appropriate equipment and 
trained staff are needed in both the public and private 
sectors. Weighing devices have been available since 
antiquity and routine birthweight measurement has been 
standard practice in Europe since the late 19th century; 
however, accurate information on birthweight is absent 
for most births worldwide. For example, heaping has 
been shown to be worse when analogue scales are used 
rather than digital ones and where scales with low 
precision are used.37,38 There is a pressing need to develop 
affordable, robust, portable, and accurate weighing 
devices for use in both facility and community settings.
Recording of birthweight data on health cards, which 
can be used as a data source at the time of the survey, 
could substantially improve the quality of survey 
birthweight data and reduce the need for adjustments 
(table 5).
The sickest and smallest newborns are often missing 
from the data systems, including those who die soon 
after birth, or are admitted to another ward. Data system 
improvements and linkages are required to capture 
information on these most vulnerable newborns.
Misclassification of early neonatal deaths as stillbirths 
remains an issue. Since these babies are more likely to be 
LBW, this can lead to an underestimate of LBW prevalence 
if stillbirths are excluded.39 Therefore, it is important that 
every newborn, whether live or stillborn, is weighed at 
birth and that core information including birthweight 
and gestational age is captured within the data system.
Societal and family demand for birthweight data is an 
understudied issue. Little is known about family and 
community perceptions and demand for birthweight 
measurement, including cultural barriers to birthweight 
measurement, especially in some community settings, 
and for stillbirths. Innovations that increase the value 
parents attach to birthweight data might help recall, and 
lead to improved recording on handheld health cards and 
birth certificates.
Birthweight reflects both intrauterine fetal growth and 
length of gestation. Assessing measures of weight for 
gestational age, for example small-for-gestational age, 
enables these two components to be distinguished. 
However, challenges in assessing gestational age accurately 
in many low-income and middle-income countries limit 
its use as a routine public health measure.40,41 Debate has 
focused on the appropriateness of a single birthweight-for-
gestational age cutoff for defining fetal growth restriction, 
with ethnic-specific standards associated with more 
accurate prediction of neonatal mortality and morbidity.42-44 
Clear guidance on appropriate standards will be required 
as more data on gestational age become available at a 
national level worldwide, enabling tracking of fetal growth.
Reducing LBW requires a multifaceted approach.46 
Even in the absence of accurate gestational age data at a 
national level, an understanding of the underlying 
pathways to LBW in a given setting is required to reduce 
the burden. For example, in southern Asia around half of 
LBW newborns are phenotypically term but small-for-
gestational age, which is driven by underlying maternal 
undernutrition including maternal stunting.4 Conversely 
preterm birth is the major contributor to LBW in set-
tings with many adolescent pregnancies or with high 
prevalence of infection (eg, in east and southern Africa) 
or where pregnancy is highly medicalised with high 
levels of fertility treatment and intensive obstetric 
management including high prevalence of caesarean 
sections (eg, the USA and Brazil).47 Improved birthweight 
data, coupled with high-quality data on gestational age, 
will be needed to target interventions appropriately and 
to track progress. Ongoing initiatives to improve CRVS 
and HMISs should be designed to ensure that this 
information is captured for all births.
We estimate that there were 20·5 million LBW 
livebirths in 2015 worldwide, nearly three quarters of 
them in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Progress 
in reducing LBW prevalence (AARR 1·23%) is insuf-
ficient to reach the global nutrition targets, which will 
require an AARR of 2·74%. Accurate birthweight data 
are needed for all births to improve both individual 
clinical care and public health action. There are large 
data gaps for the countries with the highest burden. In 
addition to better birthweight data, better gestational age 
assessment would help to identify the most appropriate 
interventions in a given setting. Targeted action to 
address the underlying causes of LBW (preterm birth 
and fetal growth restriction) and improved care for those 
born with LBW is needed to ensure that all realise their 
full potential to survive and thrive. In the SDG era, these 
most vulnerable babies must not be left behind.
