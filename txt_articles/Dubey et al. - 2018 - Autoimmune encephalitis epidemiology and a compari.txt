Abstract
Objectives—We evaluate incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis and compare the 
epidemiology of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis.
Methods—We performed a population-based comparative study of the incidence and prevalence 
of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis in Olmsted County, USA. Autoimmune encephalitis 
diagnosis and subgroups were defined by 2016 diagnostic criteria and infectious encephalitis 
diagnosis required a confirmed infectious pathogen. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and 
incidence rates were calculated. Patients with encephalitis of uncertain etiology were excluded.
Results—The prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis on January 1, 2014 of 13.7/100,000 was 
not significantly different from that of all infectious encephalitides (11.6/100,000; p=0.63) or the 
viral subcategory (8.3/100,000; p=0.17). The incidence rates (1995–2015) of autoimmune and 
infectious encephalitis were 0.8/100,000 and 1.0/100,000 person-years respectively (p=0.58). The 
number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune than infectious 
encephalitis (p=0.03). The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased over time from 
0.4/100,000 person-years (1995–2005) to 1.2/100,000 person-years (2006–2015) (p=0.02), 
attributable to increased recognition of autoantibody-positive cases. The incidence (2.8 vs 
0.7/100,000 person-years; p=0.01) and prevalence (38.3 vs 13.7/100,000; p=0.04) of autoimmune

 encephalitis was higher among African-Americans than Caucasians. The prevalence of specific 
neural autoantibodies was: myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG) (1.9/100,000); glutamic 
acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) (1.9/100,000); unclassified neural autoantibody (1.4/100,000); 
leucine-rich glioma-inactivated-protein-1 (LGI1) (0.7/100,000); collapsin response-mediator 
protein-5 (CRMP5) (0.7/100,000); N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) (0.6/100,000); anti-
neuronal nuclear antibody-2 (ANNA-2/anti-Ri) (0.6/100,000) and glial fibrillary acidic protein-α 
(GFAPα) (0.6/100,000).
Interpretation—This study shows that the prevalence and incidence of autoimmune encephalitis 
is comparable to infectious encephalitis and its detection is increasing over time.

Introduction
The cost of hospitalization in the United States in 2010 for encephalitis (2 billion US 
dollars) illustrates its severe disease burden.1 Earlier epidemiology studies have primarily 
focused on infectious causes.1–4 Autoimmune encephalitis is increasingly recognized as a 
common treatable cause of encephalitis, yet population-based studies on its incidence and 
prevalence are lacking. This is in part due to the only recent neural autoantibody discovery 
as biomarkers (e.g., N-methyl D-aspartate receptor [NMDAR] autoantibodies)5 allowing 
confirmation of the diagnosis and its distinction from other causes of encephalitis. In the last 
15 years, the number of validated autoantibody biomarkers of encephalitis has increased 
dramatically. Awareness of the epidemiology of autoimmune encephalitis is essential for 
allocation of resources and health care planning. The diagnostic criteria for autoimmune 
encephalitis and its subcategories published in 2016 are utilized in this study.6 Herein we 
describe the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis in Olmsted County (MN), 
a geographically defined region of the USA and compare the epidemiology of autoimmune 
encephalitis and infectious encephalitis.
Methods
Study design and participants
For this population-based study of the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis 
among residents of Olmsted County, USA, we included patients of both sexes and all ages, 
including children and ethnic minorities. The study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Boards of the Mayo Clinic, and Olmsted Medical Center.
Olmsted County in southeastern Minnesota (USA) has a population of 155,285 (January 1, 
2014) primarily of northern European descent and includes the city of Rochester. The 
medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project includes all medical 
practitioners in Olmsted County.7 We identified all patients with encephalitis by searching 
the medical records from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2015 for all potentially relevant 
diagnostic codes (Figure 1).

 Data Collection
Electronic and paper medical records were reviewed, for demographic details (age, sex, race/
ethnicity), period of follow-up, co-existing autoimmunity, clinical data, laboratory results, 
radiologic findings and outcome at last follow-up using the modified Rankin score (mRS). 
All patients included had given consent for the passive use of their medical record for 
research purposes and patients that did not authorize the use of their medical records for 
research were excluded.
Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnoses were assigned by three neurologists (D.D., E.P.F., A.S.L.) from independent 
medical record review and categorized as infectious or autoimmune encephalitis.
Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis utilized criteria from a recent position paper on a 
clinical approach to this diagnosis.6 The initial criteria to be met for consideration of 
possible autoimmune encephalitis include: 1) a compatible clinical syndrome of subacute/
rapidly progressive altered mental status, memory loss or psychiatric symptoms; 2) One or 
more of: A) focal CNS findings; B) new seizures; C) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis; 
D) MRI abnormalities consistent with autoimmune encephalitis; 3) Reasonable exclusion of 
other etiologies.6 Patients with possible autoimmune encephalitis are then stratified via a 
diagnostic algorithm into specific subcategories of probable and definite autoimmune 
encephalitis including: definite autoimmune encephalitis, autoantibody-defined disease (e.g., 
antibodies against intracellular antigens, synaptic receptors, ion channels or other cell 
surface proteins that strongly associate with autoimmune encephalitis); definite autoimmune 
limbic encephalitis; definite acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM); autoimmune 
NMDA-receptor encephalitis (probable and definite); Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis 
(probable and definite); Hashimoto encephalopathy (probable autoimmune); and 
“autoantibody-negative but probable” autoimmune encephalitis.6 Patients with a final 
diagnosis of possible autoimmune encephalitis not meeting criteria for a probable or definite 
autoimmune encephalitis category were excluded.
Comparison group of infectious encephalitis
For a comparison group, we evaluated the incidence and prevalence of infectious 
encephalitis including meningoencephalitis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) per previously published criteria,8,9 but additionally we required conformation of an 
infectious pathogen (bacterial/viral/fungal/parasitic) for inclusion. Those with presumed 
infectious encephalitis without a confirmed pathogen or a prion disorder were excluded 
(Figure 1).
Neural Autoantibody markers with high specificity for autoimmune encephalitis
As outlined in the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune encephalitis we only considered 
patients whose serum or CSF was positive for one or more IgG neural autoantibodies that 
strongly associate with and are highly specific for encephalitis as “autoantibody positive”. 
The following autoantibody specificities were screened for by standardized indirect 
immunofluorescence assay (IFA): α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid 
(AMPA) receptor [GluA1 and GluA2 subunits], amphiphysin, anti-neuronal nuclear

 antibody (ANNA)-1 [anti-Hu], ANNA- 2 [anti-Ri], ANNA-3, collapsin response-mediator 
protein (CRMP)-5, contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), dipeptidyl-peptidase-like 
protein 6 (DPPX), ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor, glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), glutamic acid decarboxylase (65 kD isoform; GAD65), leucine rich glioma-
inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), Ma2 (performed through Athena diagnostics), metabotropic 
glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), NMDA-receptor [GluN1 subunit] and purkinje cell 
cytoplasmic autoantibody type 2/Microtubule associated protein 1B.10,11 GAD65 IgG was 
assessed via radioimmuno-precipitation assay and for this study GAD65 positivity was an 
inclusion criterion for the antibody positive subgroup only if detected in CSF or if the serum 
titer exceeded 20 nmol/L (normal, ≤0.02 nmol/L).12 Cell-based assays (CBAs) using human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with appropriate expression plasmids were 
used to confirm AMPA receptor, CASPR2, DPPX, GABAB, mGluR5, LGI1 and NMDA-
receptor specificities (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). IFA patterns consistent with GFAPα 
were confirmed similarly by in-house CBA.11 Myelin oligodendrocyte (MOG) IgG were 
detected by live in-house (CLIA approved) flow cytometry (FACS) assay. Patients 
seropositive for any unclassified neural autoantibody recognized in our Neuroimmunology 
Laboratory’s unpublished experience to be strongly associated with autoimmune 
encephalitis, were included in the “autoantibody positive” group. We retested 13 specimens 
(11 sera, 2 CSF) for neural antibodies not tested at the time of service evaluation.
Neural autoantibodies not highly specific for autoimmune encephalitis
For this study the following autoantibodies were considered not specific for autoimmune 
encephalitis and seropositivity for one or more of these antibodies was insufficient to be 
designated antibody positive: voltage-gated Kv1 potassium channel-complex autoantibodies 
but negative on subtyping for CASPR2 and LGI1;13 ganglionic acetylcholine receptor 
autoantibodies; GAD65 positivity in serum of lower serum titer (<20 nmol/L); muscle 
acetylcholine receptor binding autoantibody; N or P/Q type voltage gated calcium channel 
autoantibodies; and striated muscle autoantibodies.12 These patients were excluded and 
considered antibody negative for this study unless they had a co-existing antibody strongly 
associated with autoimmune encephalitis or they fulfilled the much more stringent criteria 
for probable or definite autoimmune encephalitis subcategories that do not require 
antibodies.
Infectious evaluation of CSF
Infectious testing included one or more of: gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial 
culture, mycobacterial culture and AFB stain (selected cases), cryptococal antigen, fungal 
culture, IgM and IgG specific for west nile virus (WNV), LaCrosse virus and lyme disease, 
PCR for lyme, ehrlichia, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, human herpes virus (HHV) 6, 
varicella zoster virus (VZV), John Cunningham virus (JCV) and California encephalitis 
virus.
Statistical methodology
Patient and clinical characteristics were compared between autoimmune and infectious 
encephalitis sub-groups using Kruskal-Wallis or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

 Age- and sex-specific population counts were obtained from the Rochester Epidemiology 
Project Census of Olmsted County for January 1, 2014 and annually for 1995 through 2015. 
Prevalence rates were calculated as the number of patients with autoimmune or infectious 
encephalitis (or their specific sub-groups) divided by the population count as of January 1, 
2014, and were reported per 100,000 people. The incidence rates were calculated as the 
number of patients with autoimmune or infectious encephalitis (or their specific sub-groups) 
divided by the total number of person-years at risk and were reported per 100,000 person-
years. These rates were adjusted using the direct method to the sex and age distribution of 
the total United States population in 2010.
Prevalence and incidence rates for autoimmune and infectious encephalitis were compared 
using generalized logit models in which the 3 patient levels were those that were disease 
free, those with autoimmune encephalitis and those with infectious encephalitis. Prevalence 
and incidence rates for autoimmune encephalitis were separately calculated for non-
Hispanic white (Caucasian) patients and for African-American patients using the 
corresponding race-specific Olmsted County population counts. Incidence rates were 
separately calculated within each encephalitis group and sub-group for 1995–2005 and for 
2006–2015. Poisson regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to compare the 
race-specific rates as well as the incidence rates across the two-time periods. Analyses were 
performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Excluded patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology and immune related disorders
Fifty-two patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology and immune related disorders were 
excluded (Figure 1). Twenty-five of these patients were tested for neural antibodies and 4 
were seropositive for antibodies not specific for autoimmune encephalitis including: voltage 
gated potassium channel complex autoantibody negative for LGI1 and CASPR2 subtyping, 2 
(0.17 nmol/L and 0.48 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]); ganglionic acetylcholine receptor 
autoantibody, 1 (0.06 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]); and glutamic acid decarboxylase 
autoantibody, 1 (0.06 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]). Eight excluded patients with possible 
autoimmune encephalitis received immunotherapy treatment trials and six responded.
Results
Comparison of Autoimmune Encephalitis and Infectious Encephalitis
The prevalence and incidence rates for autoimmune and infectious encephalitis did not differ 
(respectively, 13.7 vs 11.6/100,000; p=0.63 and 0.8 vs 1.0/100,000 person-years, p=0.58; 
Tables 2 & 3). Autoimmune encephalitis prevalence slightly exceeded that of viral 
encephalitis but the difference was not significant (13.7 vs 8.3/100,000; p=0.17); incident 
rates were about equivalent (0.8 [autoimmune] vs 0.6 [viral] per 100,000 person-years; 
p=0.36). The number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune 
than infectious encephalitis (Table 1) but neither mRS at last follow-up nor the number of 
documented deaths differed significantly. Demographics and clinical data for the 2 patient 
groups are compared in Table 1. The prevalence and incidence data for autoimmune 
encephalitis and infectious encephalitis, and their sub-groups, are summarized in Table 2 and

infectious encephalitis etiologies.
Disproportionate African-American ethnicity representation in autoimmune encephalitis
The prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis was higher among African-American population 
(38.3/100,000) than Caucasians (13.7/100,000; p=0.04), particularly for autoimmune 
GAD65 encephalitis (2) and ADEM (2 [1 patient MOG-IgG positive]). The incidence of 
autoimmune encephalitis also was higher among African-Americans (2.8/100,000 person-
years) than Caucasians (0.7/100,00 person-years, p=0.01). The ethnic proportionality did not 
differ among incident/prevalent infectious encephalitis.
Time trends in autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis
The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased from the 1995–2005 interval to the 
2006–2016 interval (0.4 [1995–2005] to 1.2 [2006–2015], p=0.02) (Figure 2C). An increase 
in neural-specific IgG-associated encephalitis was the major contributor to this trend (0.1 
[1995–2005] to 0.6 [2006–2015], p=0.03). Incident rates of infectious encephalitis remained 
unchanged over the two decades (0.9 [1995–2005] to 1.0 [2006–2015], p=0.87) (Figure 2C).
Categories of encephalitis for all incident and prevalent autoimmune encephalitis cases
Definite autoimmune encephalitis, autoantigen designated—One or more neural-
specific IgGs were detected in 13 autoimmune encephalitis cases: all four patients who were 
MOG-IgG positive in serum met criteria for ADEM; two of them had coexisting serum 
GAD65 autoantibodies (0.06 nmol/L, 0.15 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]). One, a boy aged 2 
years at onset who was dual seropositive for NMDA-receptor-IgG and MOG-IgG, had 
recurrent encephalitis, seizures, optic neuritis and multifocal MRI abnormalities (Figure 
3A). NMDA-receptor-IgG was detected in CSF by cell-based assay alone and MOG-IgG 
was detected in serum by FACS (titer 100 [normal<2.5]). Clinically, diagnostic criteria were 
met for autoimmune NMDA-receptor encephalitis and ADEM; no tumor was found. Three 
patients had isolated GAD65-IgG (patient 1: serum 697 nmol/L, CSF 13.3 nmol/L; patient 2: 
serum 147.0 nmol/L; patient 3: CSF 4.9 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]). Their clinical findings 
included altered mental status, brain stem dysfunction, neuropsychiatric manifestations, 
seizures and refractory status epilepticus. In one patient a multifocal neurologic disorder 
developed including autoimmune encephalitis accompanied by focal epilepsy, dysautonomia 
and myasthenia gravis leading to the diagnosis of thymoma. His serum was positive for 
LGI1-IgG by cell-based assay, CRMP5-IgG (titer 960 [normal, <240] confirmed by western 
blot), GAD65-IgG (23.1 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]), acetylcholine receptor binding 
autoantibodies (6.08 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]) and striated muscle autoantibodies (titer 
30720 [normal, <120]). One patient with serum GFAP-IgG positivity on tissue 
immunofluorescence confirmed by cell-based assay using GFAPα isoform had the hallmark 
clinical syndrome of meningoencephalitis accompanied by bilateral optic disc edema, 
tremors, radial enhancement on head MRI (Figure 3B)14 and brain biopsy showed 
perivascular chronic inflammatory infiltrates, comprised mainly of mature T-lymphocytes, 
microglial activation and focal microglial nodules. One patient with limbic encephalitis 
accompanied by bilateral mesial temporal T2-hyperintensity with subsequent atrophy on

 MRI (Figure 3C) was seropositive for AMPAR-IgG in serum by immunofluorescence (no 
titer available) and cell-based assay leading to the detection of breast carcinoma; serum 
GAD65 autoantibody coexisted (0.11 nmol/L; normal, ≤0.02]) in this patient. Another 
patient in whom breast carcinoma was found after the onset of neurologic symptoms 
presented with jaw dystonia, laryngospasm and neuropsychiatric manifestations and was 
ANNA-2-IgG seropositive in both serum (titer=7680 [normal, <240]) and CSF (titer=16 
[normal, <2] and was confirmed by western blot. Two patients with CSF unclassified neural-
specific antibodies (serum titers 1920, 15360 [normal, <240]) and CSF titers 128, 1024 
[normal, <4]) one with coexisting serum GAD65 autoantibody (0.03 nmol/L [normal, 
≤0.02]), had subacute cognitive decline and brainstem symptoms and signs. The serological 
findings prompted a search for cancer leading to diagnosis of seminoma in both cases.
Definite autoimmune limbic encephalitis—Five patients without detectable neural 
autoantibodies met criteria for diagnosis of definite autoimmune limbic encephalitis (clinical 
criteria, 5; bilateral MRI mesial temporal signal changes, 5 [Figure 3D]; CSF pleocytosis, 2, 
or EEG criteria, 3) and alternative etiologies were excluded.
Definite ADEM—Five patients without a detected neural autoantibody fulfilled diagnostic 
criteria for ADEM.
Bickerstaff encephalitis—No patients met diagnostic criteria for probable or definite 
Bickerstaff encephalitis.
Hashimoto encephalitis—One patient met criteria for Hashimoto encephalitis with 
encephalopathy, myoclonus, thyroid disease, thyroid peroxidase antibody seropositivity, 
normal MRI brain, no neural autoantibody detected in serum or CSF and response to 
immunotherapy.
Seronegative probable autoimmune encephalitis—Four patients with a compatible 
clinical syndrome met at least two of the three criteria for this diagnosis: Head MRI findings 
consistent with encephalitis (right medial temporal lobe T2/FLAIR hyperintensity [n=1], 
multifocal cortical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities [n=1], multifocal subcortical T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensities [n=2]); CSF inflammation (pleocytosis, 1; supernumerary oligoclonal 
bands/elevated IgG index, 1); brain biopsy showing inflammatory infiltrates and excluding 
other disorders (n=3). One of the four patients had ganglionic (α3) acetylcholine receptor 
(titer 0.11 nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]) and muscle acetylcholine receptor antibodies (titer 0.07 
nmol/L [normal, ≤0.02]) both considered less specific for autoimmune encephalopathy and 
thus was not included in the antibody positive section.
Cancer associations of autoimmune encephalitis
Six patients had paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis with the following neoplasms 
identified (3 after a predictive neural autoantibody profile was detected): breast carcinoma 
(2), seminoma (2; both were seronegative for Ma1 and Ma2 IgGs), thymoma (1), lymphoma 
(1).

 Treatments and response in autoimmune encephalitis
Immunotherapy was administered to 26 of 28 patients (93%). High-dose corticosteroids 
(23), IVIG (2) and plasmapheresis (1) were the initial immunomodulatory therapies. 
Twenty-one (81%) improved clinically following immunotherapy, either as sole initial 
treatment (86%) or in combination with cancer therapy (14%). Thirteen patients (46%) 
received second line or maintenance treatment (mycophenolate mofetil [4], 
cyclophosphamide [3], extended IVIG [>6 months, 3], rituximab [2], extended prednisone 
course [>6 months, 1]).
Discussion
This study shows that the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis 
approximates that of infectious encephalitis at a population level. Furthermore, the detection 
of autoimmune encephalitis is increasing over time. Although both infectious and 
autoimmune etiologies are associated with considerable morbidity, the tendency to relapse 
was greater in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, thus increasing the disease burden.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the epidemiology of autoimmune 
encephalitis at a population level; showing an incidence of 0.8/100,000 person-years and 
prevalence of 13.7/100,000. Antibody-positive definite autoimmune encephalitis was the 
most prevalent category; next was ADEM. The most frequently identified neural 
autoantibody specificities were MOG and GAD65 (in CSF or in serum at high titer), with a 
single case of NMDA-receptor encephalitis identified with coexisting MOG-IgG. Prior 
epidemiology studies of encephalitis have mostly focused on infectious etiologies, with 
“immune-mediated” syndromes occasionally analyzed as a subgroup. Studies have either 
utilized administrative data2,4, hospital evaluation data, or sample referral from selected 
hospitals to a centralized organization for epidemiological evaluation.15 A prospective study 
of encephalitis in the United Kingdom that enrolled patients from 24 hospitals over a period 
of 2 years found infectious etiology to be twice as common as autoimmune (42% vs 21% 
[the remainder were of uncertain etiology]); ADEM and NMDA-receptor encephalitis were 
the most common subcategories.16 A direct comparison to our study is limited, as that study 
was hospital-based rather than truly population-based, the repertoire of antibodies available 
has expanded, and diagnostic criteria that we used were not available at that time. 
Additionally, among young patients tested at a referral laboratory for infectious encephalitis 
agents in California (the California encephalitis project), the frequency of NMDA-receptor 
encephalitis was found to equate to viral causes in young individuals.17 The incident rate of 
encephalitis (combined autoimmune and infectious) was lower than an Olmsted County 
study from 1950–1981 (1.8 vs 7.4/100,0000 person-years) reflecting our exclusion of 
encephalitis of unknown etiology and aseptic meningitis, the increased availability of 
vaccines in recent years and access to MRI during our time period which is very helpful in 
refining diagnosis.18
Autoimmune encephalitis is a broad term that encompasses many different neurological 
diseases depending on the definition used; we used the 2016 diagnostic criteria for 
autoimmune encephalitis.6 In utilizing these criteria, we took numerous steps to avoid an 
overestimate of autoimmune encephalitis frequency. Firstly, only patients with probable or 
Dubey et al.

 definite autoimmune encephalitis per the 2016 criteria were included (Figure 1). Secondly, 
diseases with more chronicity (e.g., Morvan syndrome), clinical presentations different to 
classic limbic encephalitis (e.g., progressive encephalomyelitis rigidity and myoclonus 
[PERM]) or immune related disorders (e.g., Rasmussen encephalitis [Figure 1]) were 
excluded per the 2016 diagnostic criteria. Thirdly, only antibodies highly specific for 
autoimmune encephalitis (often detected by cell-based assay), were included in the antibody 
positive category and these antibodies are only rarely found in disease or healthy controls 
(0.2%).19 Many patients designated antibody positive had CSF antibody detection which is 
preferred for some antibodies (e.g., NMDA-R). However, antibody detection in serum alone 
can also be highly specific and may be required if CSF testing is not available (e.g., MOG-
IgG) or preferred if sensitivity is optimal in serum without loss of specificity (e.g., serum 
LGI1 autoantibodies); all patients in this study with serum antibody positivity alone had 
syndromes compatible with autoimmune encephalitis.20–22 With the exception of GAD 65 
(serum >20 nmol/L or detectable in CSF), patients with neural autoantibodies less specific 
for autoimmune encephalitis detected by older generation techniques (e.g., 
immunoprecipitation assay) which can be found in controls (up to 6%)19 were designated 
antibody negative for the purposes of this study. Such patients were excluded unless they 
had a coexisting highly specific antibody or they met more stringent criteria for antibody 
negative autoimmune encephalitis. Care is needed in those with neural antibodies not 
strongly associated with autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., voltage-gated potassium-channel 
autoantibodies negative for LGI1 and CASPR2) as a positive result can lead to premature 
diagnostic closure, an alternative diagnosis being overlooked and iatrogenic morbidity from 
inappropriate immunosuppression.6,13,23 A positive antibody test result should never replace 
clinical judgement.
The 2016 diagnostic criteria focus on the limbic encephalitis phenotype. Patients with 
paraneoplastic/autoimmune encephalitis involving the brainstem alone (e.g., accompanying 
Ma2 autoantibodies) may not meet criteria. Additionally, patients with faciobrachial 
dystonic seizures and LGI1 autoantibodies would not meet diagnostic criteria until cognitive 
impairment occurred, yet rapid diagnosis and early treatment may prevent cognitive 
impairment.24 Future criteria need to consider how to best capture such cases, particularly if 
such criteria are to be used for enrollment in clinical trials. Treatment response was not a 
component of the 2016 criteria which aimed at diagnosis prior to treatment and sought to 
distinguish autoimmune encephalitis from other steroid-responsive-disorders (e.g., 
lymphoma). However, this could result in under-representation of some autoimmune 
encephalitis cases as 6 excluded patients met criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis 
and responded to immunotherapy but lacked the classic features of limbic encephalitis 
required for inclusion into a subcategory of autoimmune encephalitis.
The detection of autoimmune encephalitis is likely to increase over time and the prevalence 
and incidence in our study is likely an underestimate. This is evident by the tripling of its 
incidence from 1995–2005 to 2006–2015, markedly in antibody-positive cases (Figure 2B). 
Other contributors to under-representation may include the lack of widespread recognition 
of what we now recognize as classic syndromes (e.g., neuropsychiatric syndrome of anti-
NMDA-receptor encephalitis; faciobrachial dystonic seizures in LGI1-antibody encephalitis) 
over the duration of our study (1995–2015),25,26 lack of availability of samples in those with

discovered in the future. Infectious encephalitis may also be underrepresented as next-
generation sequencing for infectious agents was not available for this study.27,28
The higher incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis among African-Americans 
is consistent with our prior reports of their predisposition for autoimmune GAD65 
encephalomyelitis and for a similar CNS autoimmune disease, aquaporin-4-IgG seropositive 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.29 This observation in autoimmune encephalitis is 
preliminary. Given that this population in general has less access to and receives lower 
quality medical care,30 further study of populations with higher proportions of African-
Americans are needed.31
Distinguishing paraneoplastic/autoimmune encephalitis from infectious or other etiologies 
can be difficult but is aided by laboratory testing for infectious/autoimmune etiologies and 
the presence of clinical and radiologic clues (Figure 3). As infectious meningoencephalitis 
and PML (which may lack accompanying inflammation) may mimic autoimmune 
encephalitis these were included in the infectious category. Infection may be a trigger for 
CNS autoimmunity (e.g. NMDA-receptor encephalitis post HSV-1 infection) though we did 
not encounter such cases in this study.32,33
Strengths of our study are, firstly, that Olmsted County is an excellent population for 
epidemiologic study due to its almost complete population coverage.31 Secondly, the 
availability of the Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory located within this county 
allowed comprehensive analysis and re-analysis of samples. Limitations of our study include 
the lack of standardized testing for all infectious and autoimmune etiologies inherent in a 
population-based epidemiology study and differences in diagnostic criteria between 
infectious encephalitis (confirmation of pathogen) and autoimmune encephalitis (probable or 
definite by 2016 diagnostic criteria). When interpreting the frequency of specific 
autoantibodies one must be mindful of inherent variability of incidence/prevalence of rare 
disorders. For example, the detection rate for NMDA-receptor autoantibody in the Mayo 
Neuroimmunology service Laboratory (12/month) is more frequent than for AMPAR 
autoantibody (2/month) yet their incidence was equal in this population-based study. 
Nonetheless, our study provides an overview of the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune 
encephalitis by contemporary diagnostic criteria.
In summary, this study shows that autoimmune encephalitis represents a large proportion of 
encephalitis whose detection is increasing over time. More population-based studies of 
autoimmune encephalitis are needed to evaluate the frequency of these disorders in other 
populations.
