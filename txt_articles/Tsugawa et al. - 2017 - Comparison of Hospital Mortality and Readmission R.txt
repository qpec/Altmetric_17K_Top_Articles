Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Studies have found differences in practice patterns between male and female 
physicians, with female physicians more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines and evidence-based 
practice. However, whether patient outcomes differ between male and female physicians is largely 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether mortality and readmission rates differ between patients 
treated by male or female physicians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—We analyzed a 20% random sample of Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries 65 years or older hospitalized with a medical condition and treated by 
general internists from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014. We examined the association 
between physician sex and 30-day mortality and readmission rates, adjusted for patient and 
physician characteristics and hospital fixed effects (effectively comparing female and male 
physicians within the same hospital). As a sensitivity analysis, we examined only physicians 
focusing on hospital care (hospitalists), among whom patients are plausibly quasi-randomized to

 physicians based on the physician’s specific work schedules. We also investigated whether 
differences in patient outcomes varied by specific condition or by underlying severity of illness.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Patients’ 30-day mortality and readmission rates.
RESULTS—A total of 1 583 028 hospitalizations were used for analyses of 30-day mortality 
(mean [SD] patient age, 80.2 [8.5] years; 621 412 men and 961 616 women) and 1 540 797 were 
used for analyses of readmission (mean [SD] patient age, 80.1 [8.5] years; 602 115 men and 938 
682 women). Patients treated by female physicians had lower 30-day mortality (adjusted mortality, 
11.07% vs 11.49%; adjusted risk difference, −0.43%; 95% CI, −0.57% to −0.28%; P < .001; 
number needed to treat to prevent 1 death, 233) and lower 30-day readmissions (adjusted 
readmissions, 15.02% vs 15.57%; adjusted risk difference, −0.55%; 95% CI, −0.71% to −0.39%; P 
< .001; number needed to treat to prevent 1 readmission, 182) than patients cared for by male 
physicians, after accounting for potential confounders. Our findings were unaffected when 
restricting analyses to patients treated by hospitalists. Differences persisted across 8 common 
medical conditions and across patients’ severity of illness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Elderly hospitalized patients treated by female 
internists have lower mortality and readmissions compared with those cared for by male internists. 
These findings suggest that the differences in practice patterns between male and female 
physicians, as suggested in previous studies, may have important clinical implications for patient 
outcomes.
There is evidence that men and women may practice medicine differently. Literature has 
shown that female physicians may be more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines,1–3 provide 
preventive care more often,4–11 use more patient-centered communication,12–15 perform as 
well or better on standardized examinations,16 and provide more psychosocial counseling to 
their patients than do their male peers.14 Although studies suggest differences in practice 
patterns and process measures of quality between male and female physicians, these studies 
have not examined patient outcomes, what we arguably care about the most. In fact, whether 
patient outcomes differ between male and female physicians is largely unknown.
Female physicians now account for approximately one-third of the US physician 
workforce17 and comprise half of all US medical school graduates.18 Despite evidence 
suggesting that female physicians may provide higher-quality care,1–4,7,8,10,12–16 some have 
argued that career interruptions for childrearing, higher rates of part-time employment, and 
greater tradeoffs between home and work responsibilities19 may compromise the quality of 
care provided by female physicians and justify higher salaries among male physicians.20–22 
Therefore, empirical evidence on whether patient outcomes differ between male and female 
physicians is warranted.
In this context, using a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with medical 
conditions, we sought to investigate 3 key questions. First, are there important differences in 
clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients cared for by female internists compared with 
those treated by male internists? Second, does the influence of physician sex on patient 
outcomes differ across a variety of conditions for which patients are commonly 
hospitalized? Finally, do these differences in outcomes vary with the underlying severity of a 
patient’s illness?

 Methods
This study was approved by the Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Board and 
patient consent was not required.
Data Source
We analyzed a 20% sample of the Medicare Inpatient and Carrier Files to identify Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries 65 years or older who were hospitalized in acute care hospitals 
from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2014. Our study population was restricted to 
patients who were hospitalized owing to medical conditions as defined by the presence of a 
medical diagnosis-related group (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group). To allow for 
sufficient follow-up, patients admitted in December 2014 were excluded from the analyses 
of 30-day mortality. Patients discharged in December 2014 and patients who were out of the 
hospital for fewer than 30 days at the time of admission were excluded from the analyses of 
30-day readmission. Patients who were transferred between acute care hospitals had their 
hospital stays combined into a single episode of care, with the patient outcome attributed to 
the first hospitalization.23,24 We restricted our sample to non-elective hospitalizations. We 
also excluded patients who left against medical advice.
We assigned each hospitalization to a physician based on the National Provider Identifier in 
the Carrier File that accounted for the largest amount of Medicare Part B spending during 
that hospitalization.25 Part B spending comprises professional and other fees determined by 
the physician. On average, these physicians were responsible for 51.1% of total Part B 
spending for a given hospitalization. We restricted our analyses to hospitalizations for which 
the physicians with the highest amount of Part B spending were general internists to avoid 
comparing physicians across different specialties. Physician data, including physician age, 
were obtained by linking the Medicare data with a comprehensive database of US physicians 
assembled by a company that provides online networking services for US physicians 
(Doximity; https://www.doximity.com/) through data partnerships, including the American 
Board of Medical Specialties, state licensing boards, and collaborating hospitals and medical 
schools.26,27
Adjustment Variables
We accounted for patient characteristics, physician characteristics, and hospital fixed effects. 
Patient characteristics included patient age in 5-year increments (the oldest group was 
categorized as ≥95 years), sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
Hispanic, and other), primary diagnosis (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group), 27 
coexisting conditions (determined using the Elixhauser comorbidity index28), median annual 
household income estimated from residential zip codes (in deciles), an indicator variable for 
Medicaid coverage, and indicator variables for year. Physician characteristics included 
physician age in 5-year increments (the oldest group was categorized as ≥70 years), 
indicator variables for the medical schools from which the physicians graduated, and type of 
medical training (ie, allopathic vs osteopathic29 training).

 Statistical Analysis
We first examined the association between physician sex and 30-day mortality (whether 
patients died within 30 days of the admission date) and 30-day readmissions (whether 
patients were readmitted within 30 days of the discharge date) by using 3 regression models. 
Model 1 compared patient outcomes (mortality and readmissions) between male and female 
physicians, adjusting for patient characteristics. Model 2 adjusted for all variables in model 
1 plus hospital fixed effects (ie, hospital indicators), effectively comparing male and female 
physicians within the same hospital.30 Model 3 adjusted for all variables in model 2 plus 
physician characteristics, to evaluate if the differences in patient outcomes between male and 
female physicians could be explained by other physician characteristics that are correlated 
with physician sex. We used a multivariable linear probability model30,31 (ie, fitting ordinary 
least-squares to binary outcomes) as our primary model for computational efficiency and 
because there were problems with complete or quasi-complete separation in logistic 
regression models. To account for potential correlation between patient outcomes within the 
same physician, SEs were clustered at the physician level. After fitting regression models, 
we calculated adjusted patient outcomes using the marginal standardization form of 
predictive margins.32
Next, we assessed whether differences in patient outcomes between male and female 
physicians differed according to the primary condition for which a patient was admitted. We 
evaluated the 8 most common medical conditions treated by general internists, according to 
the Medicare data: sepsis, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, arrhythmia, and 
gastrointestinal bleeding. A list of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, 
codes is available in eTable 1 in the Supplement.33
Finally, we assessed whether differences in outcomes between male and female physicians 
varied according to illness severity. We used a logistic regression model with 30-day 
mortality as an outcome, and the patient-level adjustment variables listed above as 
explanatory variables to determine each patient’s likelihood of death. Within each quintile of 
expected mortality, we then examined patient outcomes between male and female 
physicians, adjusting for patient and physician characteristics and hospital fixed effects.
Analysis of Potential Mechanisms
We explored potential mechanisms for observed differences between male and female 
physicians, including differences in length of stay, use of care, patient volume (number of 
hospitalized Medicare patients each physician treated annually), and discharge location of 
patients (home, skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation facility, hospice, or other). Use of care 
was measured by total Part B spending per hospitalization. Length of stay and use of care 
were used as continuous variables with quadratic and cubic terms, and patient volume was 
categorized into deciles. In addition, to address the possibility that physicians’ age may not 
fully account for the differences in clinical experience between female and male physicians, 
we further adjusted for physicians’ years in practice as measured by years since completion 
of residency. We did not include this variable in our main models because of collinearity 
with physicians’ age and because data were missing for 27 447 physicians (47.4%).

 Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, to address the possibility that female 
physicians may treat healthier patients, we restricted the study population to hospitalized 
patients treated by physicians who specialize in the care of hospitalized patients 
(hospitalists). Hospitalists typically work in shifts; therefore, within the same hospital, 
patients treated by hospitalists are plausibly quasi-randomized to a given physician based on 
when patients become sick and based on hospitalists’ work schedule.34 We defined 
hospitalists using a validated approach: general internists who filed at least 90% of their total 
evaluation and management billings in an inpatient setting.35 Second, to evaluate whether 
our findings were sensitive to how we attributed patients to physicians, we tested the 
following 2 alternative attribution methods: attributing patients to physicians who had the 
largest number of evaluation and management claims and attributing patients to physicians 
who billed the first evaluation and management claim for a given hospitalization.25,36,37 
Third, within some hospitals, male internists may be more likely to work in intensive care 
units and have severely ill patients. To address this issue, we reanalyzed our data after 
excluding hospitals with a medical intensive care unit. Fourth, to test whether our findings 
were sensitive to follow-up periods for measuring patient outcomes, we used 60-day 
mortality and readmissions instead of 30-day patient outcomes. Fifth, we modeled physician 
and patient age as continuous rather than categorical variables with quadratic and cubic 
terms to allow for nonlinear associations. Finally, we used logistic regression models instead 
of linear probability models.
Data preparation was conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and analyses were 
performed using Stata, version 13 (StataCorp). Additional details are provided in the 
eAppendix in the Supplement.
Results
Characteristics of Female and Male Physicians
During the study periods, 58 344 general internists treated at least 1 Medicare beneficiary 
who was hospitalized with a medical condition (Table 1). Among those, 18 751 physicians 
(32.1%) were female. Female physicians were younger (mean [SD] age, 42.8 [9.4] vs 47.8 
[11.4] years), were more likely to have undergone osteopathic training (1577 [8.4%] vs 2770 
[7.0%]), and treated fewer patients (131.9 vs 180.5 hospitalizations per year) compared with 
male physicians. Patient characteristics were similar between those treated by female 
physicians vs those treated by male physicians, with 1 modest exception: female physicians 
treated slightly higher proportions of female patients than male physicians did (258 091 
[62.1%] vs 722 038 [60.2%]). We also found that female physicians were more likely to 
work in large (7460 [41.9%] vs 13 628 [35.7%]), nonprofit (13 947 [78.2%] vs 28 850 
[75.6%]), major teaching hospitals (5168 [29.0%] vs 8061 [21.1%]) located in the Northeast 
region (4746 [26.8%] vs 8574 [22.7%]) compared with male physicians (eTable 2 in the 
Supplement).

 Physician Sex and Patient Mortality
The final sample for the analyses of 30-day mortality rates included 1 583 028 
hospitalizations treated by 57 896 physicians. Overall 30-day mortality for the entire sample 
was 179 162 (11.32%). Patients cared for by female physicians had lower 30-day mortality 
than did patients treated by male physicians (10.82%vs11.49%; risk difference [RD], 
−0.67%; 95% CI, −0.80% to −0.54%; P < .001; number needed to treat [NNT] to prevent 1 
death, 149) after accounting for patient characteristics (Table2). The difference in mortality 
persisted after adjustment for hospital fixed effects (female physicians, 10.91% vs male 
physicians, 11.46%; adjusted RD, −0.55%; 95% CI, −0.67% to −0.42%; P < .001; NNT, 
182). Further adjusting for physician characteristics had a limited effect on these results 
(female physicians, 11.07% vs male physicians, 11.49%; adjusted RD, −0.43%; 95% CI 
−0.57% to −0.28%; P < .001; NNT, 233).
Physician Sex and Patient Readmissions
The analyses of 30-day readmission rates included 1 540 797 hospitalizations treated by 57 
876 physicians. The overall 30-day readmission rate for this sample was 237 644 (15.42%). 
Patients of female physicians had significantly lower readmission rates than those with male 
physicians, after accounting for patient characteristics (15.01% vs 15.57%; RD, −0.55%; 
95% CI, −0.71% to −0.41%; P < .001; NNT to prevent 1 readmission, 182) (Table 2). 
Adjusting for hospital fixed effects (female physicians, 15.00% vs male physicians, 15.57%; 
adjusted RD, −0.56%; 95% CI, −0.70% to −0.42%; P < .001; NNT, 179) and further 
accounting for physician characteristics (female physicians, 15.02% vs male physicians, 
15.57%; adjusted RD, −0.55%; 95% CI, −0.71% to −0.39%; P < .001; NNT, 182) had little 
effect on these results.
Physician Sex and Patient Outcomes by Primary Diagnoses
Patients of female physicians had lower mortality and readmission rates across all medical 
conditions we examined, although the magnitude of the difference varied by condition and 
was not always statistically significant. Patients of female physicians had lower mortality for 
sepsis (23.05% vs 25.09%), pneumonia (10.11% vs 11.03%), acute renal failure (12.54% vs 
13.30%), and arrhythmia (5.08% vs 6.02%) vs patients of male physicians; however, we did 
not observe a statistically significant difference in mortality for congestive heart failure 
(11.69% vs 11.95%), urinary tract infection (5.79% vs 6.11%), and gastrointestinal bleeding 
(9.70% vs 10.27%) (Table 3). Patients’ readmission rates were significantly lower for female 
physicians than male physicians for most of the conditions (Table 4).
Physician Sex and Patient Outcomes by Severity of Illness
The association between physician sex and patient outcomes was consistent across patients’ 
severity of illness (Figure, A and B). With regard to mortality, patients of female physicians 
had significantly lower mortality rates than did patients of male physicians in all subgroups 
except for patients in the second lowest quintile of expected mortality (eTable 3 in the 
Supplement). The interaction between physician sex and expected mortality of patients was 
statistically significant.

 Readmission rates of patients were lower for female physicians than for male physicians for 
all subgroups except for the least sick patients. The interaction between physician sex and 
patient illness severity was not statistically significant.
Analysis of Potential Mechanisms
We found that additional adjustment for length of stay, use of care, discharge location, 
patient volume, or physicians’ years of practice did not affect our findings (eTable 4 in the 
Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses
We found similar patterns when we restricted our sample to patients treated by hospitalists 
(24 429 of 57 896 general internists [42.2%] were defined as hospitalists). Patients receiving 
care by female hospitalists had lower mortality and readmission rates compared with 
patients receiving care by male hospitalists (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Our findings were 
not qualitatively affected by attributing physicians according to evaluation and management 
claims (eTable 6 and eTable 7 in the Supplement), excluding hospitals with a medical 
intensive care unit (eTable 8 in the Supplement), using 60-day patient outcomes (eTable 9 in 
the Supplement), or modeling age as a continuous variable (eTable 10 in the Supplement). 
Our findings were also unaffected by estimating multivariable logistic regression models 
instead of linear probability models (eTable 11 in the Supplement). Patients treated by 
female physicians had 0.95 times the odds of death (95% CI, 0.93–0.97; P < .001) and 0.96 
time the odds of readmission (95% CI, 0.95–0.97; P < .001) compared with patients cared 
for by male physicians.
Discussion
We found that elderly patients receiving inpatient care from female internists had 30-day 
lower mortality and readmission rates compared with patients cared for by male internists. 
This association was consistent across a variety of conditions and across patients’ severity of 
illness. Taken together with previous evidence1–15 suggesting that male and female 
physicians may practice differently, our findings indicate that potential differences in 
practice patterns between male and female physicians may have important clinical 
implications for patient outcomes.
Our findings that female internists appear to have better outcomes for inpatient care than 
their male peers are consistent with results from prior studies of process measures of quality. 
There is evidence in the primary care setting suggesting that, compared with male 
physicians, female physicians are more likely to practice evidence-based medicine,3 perform 
as well or better on standardized examinations,16 and provide more patient-centered 
care.12–15 Patients of female primary care physicians also experience fewer emergency 
department visits compared with patients of male primary care physicians.38 Data from 
other industries suggest that men may be less deliberate in their approach to solving 
complex problems.39–41 If these findings also apply to how male and female physicians 
approach clinical problems and decisions, these patterns of behavior may provide a plausible 
mechanism linking physician sex with patient outcomes.

 Although the difference in patient mortality between male and female physicians was 
modest, an observed effect size of a 0.43-percentage point difference or a relative risk 
reduction of 4% in mortality is arguably a clinically meaningful difference. For context, 
there has been widespread recognition that patient outcomes have improved substantially 
during the past decade; all-cause mortality declined from 5.0% in 2003 to 4.5% in 2013 
among Medicare beneficiaries.42 This reduction in mortality is recognized as the result of 
large national investments in innovation, new treatments, and quality improvement that 
allow us to treat patients better. The difference in mortality rates between patients of male 
and female physicians in our study was of a comparable magnitude. Furthermore, given that 
there are more than 10 million Medicare hospitalizations due to medical conditions in the 
United States annually and assuming that the association between sex and mortality is 
causal, we estimate that approximately 32 000 fewer patients would die if male physicians 
could achieve the same outcomes as female physicians every year.43 The effect would be 
even larger if the associations between physician sex and patient outcomes also hold for non-
Medicare populations.
An important issue in interpreting our findings is whether they can be explained by 
differences in unmeasured severity of illness of patients treated by male vs female 
physicians. The inpatient setting, compared with the outpatient setting, offers a unique 
advantage when studying patient outcomes between male and female physicians: within a 
given hospital, there is plausibly less selection of the physician by the patient or of the 
patient by the physician. Although some patients choose their primary care physician, and 
sex of the physician may be a factor in making their decision, patients hospitalized urgently 
or emergently are less likely to select their physicians. We found that nearly all observable 
characteristics typically associated with illness severity were well balanced between female 
and male physicians. Even for hospitalist physicians, among whom patients are plausibly 
more likely to be randomly assigned, we found that patient characteristics were balanced 
between male and female physicians and that patients of female physicians continued to 
have lower patient mortality and readmission rates.
We are aware of only 1 other study examining the association between physician sex and 
patient mortality. Jerant and colleagues44 analyzed a small cohort of relatively healthy 
outpatients (who are, in general, healthier than hospitalized patients) and found no 
associations between physician sex and patient mortality. However, several analyses 
investigating differences in processes of care between male and female physicians have 
yielded results that align with our findings. For instance, Kim et al1 and Berthold et al2 both 
found that female physicians outperform male physicians on process measures for patients 
with diabetes.
Limitations
First, as is the case for any observational study, we could not fully account for unmeasured 
differences in the risk of death and readmissions between patients of male and female 
physicians. Although we addressed this issue in several ways, including the use of a natural 
experimental design exploiting the quasi-randomized assignment of patients to hospitalists, 
it is still possible that unmeasured confounding (eg, residual differences in socioeconomic

 status of patients that are not explained by patient race/ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility, and 
household income level) could explain the observed differences in patient outcomes. 
However, the residual confounding would have to be of substantial magnitude to explain the 
differences we found. Second, we were unable to identify exactly why female physicians 
have better outcomes than male physicians. Given that physician sex by itself does not 
determine patient outcomes, sex should serve as a marker of differences in practice patterns 
between male and female physicians that meaningfully affect patient outcomes. Further 
studies using clinical data would be helpful in understanding which practice patterns of 
physicians are driving the differences in patient outcomes. Third, we used self-reported data 
to identify physician sex, which requires respondents to categorize themselves as either male 
or female; therefore, we could not capture respondents who were transgender. It is possible 
that transgender physicians chose to either leave this question blank or select 1 of the 2 
available categories, which may lead to a low degree of misclassification. Any 
misclassification in self-reported sex would likely bias our estimates toward the null. Finally, 
our analysis was limited to Medicare patients hospitalized with medical conditions treated 
by general internists. Thus, our findings may not be generalizable to surgical conditions, to 
patients treated by physicians of other specialties, or to outpatient care.
Conclusions
Using a national sample of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries, we found that patients who 
receive care from female general internists have lower 30-day mortality and readmission 
rates than do patients cared for by male internists. These findings suggest that the differences 
in practice patterns between male and female physicians, as suggested in previous studies, 
may have important clinical implications for patient outcomes. Understanding exactly why 
these differences in care quality and practice patterns exist may provide valuable insights 
into improving quality of care for all patients, irrespective of who provides their care.

 Key Points
Question
Do patient outcomes differ between those treated by male and female physicians?
Findings
In this cross-sectional study, we examined nationally representative data of hospitalized 
Medicare beneficiaries and found that patients treated by female physicians had 
significantly lower mortality rates (adjusted mortality rate, 11.07% vs 11.49%) and 
readmission rates (adjusted readmission rate, 15.02% vs 15.57%) compared with those 
cared for by male physicians within the same hospital.
Meaning
Differences in practice patterns between male and female physicians, as suggested in 
previous studies, may have important clinical implications for patient outcomes.
