 HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
A Comprehensive Measure of the Costs of Caring for a Parent:
Differences According to Functional Status
Norma B. Coe PhD,*† Meghan M. Skira PhD,‡ and Eric B. Larson, MD, MPH§
Approximately 34 million family and friends provided
unpaid care to individuals aged 50 and older in 2015. It
is difficult to place a value on that time, because no pay-
ment is made to the caregiver, and multiplying caregiving
hours by a wage does not account for the value of lost lei-
sure time, implications for future employability and
wages, or any intrinsic benefits accrued to the care pro-
vider. This study used a dynamic discrete choice model
to estimate the costs of informal care provided by a
daughter to her mother, including these other costs and
benefits not typically accounted for, and compared these
cost estimates for 4 categories of the mother’s functional
status: doctor-diagnosed memory-related disease, limita-
tions in activities of daily living (ADLs), combination of
both, cannot be left alone for 1 hour or more. We studied
women aged 40 to 70 with a living mother at the start of
the sample period (N=3,427 adult daughters) using data
from the Health and Retirement Study (1998–2012). The
primary outcome was the monetized change in well-being
due to caregiving, what economists call “welfare costs.”
We estimate that the median cost to the daughter’s well-
being of providing care to an elderly mother ranged from
$144,302 to $201,896 over 2 years, depending on the
mother’s functional status. These estimates suggest that
informal care cost $277 billion in 2011, 20% more than
estimates that account only for current foregone wages. J

nformal care, unpaid care that family and friends pro-
vide, is a cornerstone of the care and support system of
elderly adults in the United States. More than 35 million
Americans provided informal care to someone aged 50 and
older in 2015.1 Most studies focus on the direct healthcare
costs of aging, ignoring the costs associated with informal
care. When the costs of informal care are computed, studies
tend to use relatively straightforward methods, primarily
relying on a replacement cost or forgone wage approach.
Replacement cost methods multiply the hours of informal
care by the wage of a formal home healthcare provider.
The foregone wage approach uses the caregiver’s own
potential market wage to value each hour of informal care
provided.
Both of these methods ignore important aspects of the
true cost of informal care. Individuals providing informal
care are affected beyond current forgone earnings. For
example, all caregivers provide care at the cost of some
other
activity—leisure
or
employment.
Forgone
wage
approaches do not incorporate the value of forgone leisure.
For individuals who leave work or decrease their work
hours to provide care, future labor market opportunities
can be affected, making it difficult to return to work at their
previous wage or hours. Finally, people who provide infor-
mal care might do so because it gives them some intrinsic
benefit, such as fulfilling a family duty.2 Neither the replace-
ment cost nor the forgone wage approaches consider these
long-term costs and nontangible benefits.
Furthermore, these methods do not capture heterogene-
ity in the costs of care due to the health status of the care
recipient. There are 3 reasons this is important: (1) Provid-
ing informal care for someone with a memory-related dis-
ease may be a different experience than caring for someone
with only ADL limitations. (2) Memory-related diseases,
such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD),

 use a disproportionate share of informal care. In 2014, one-
third of caregivers providing care to someone aged 65 and
older reported that their loved one has a memory problem.
(3) Memory-related diseases currently affect more than
5 million Americans, and their prevalence is predicted to
double within the next 30 years.3 It has been estimated that
informal care increases the cost of ADRD by 50% to 100%
over the healthcare costs4–9 but, again, use static methods
that ignore the dynamic nature of the cost to the caregiver’s
well-being.1
This study estimated a more comprehensive cost of
informal care that includes the value of time, the implica-
tions for future employability and wages, and any intrinsic
benefits that accrue to daughters who provide care to their
mothers. Economists refer to this collection of costs as
“welfare cost.” Using a dynamic discrete choice model, we
allow those costs to differ according to whether the mother
has a memory-related disease, with and without accompa-
nying ADL limitations, allowing us to more directly com-
pare our cost estimates with those that focus on ADRD
care using more traditional, static methods.
METHODS
Data
Survey data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
a longitudinal survey with information on labor supply,
family structure, intergenerational transfers, health, income,
and assets, were used. Baseline interviews occurred in 1992,
with biennial follow-up. We used data from 1998 to 2012,
when questions about parental memory-related diseases
were asked. All HRS data used were de-identified, and all
respondents provided informed consent under protocols
that the University of Michigan institutional review board
approved.
For two reasons, we focused on daughters at risk of
providing informal care to their mothers by limiting the
sample to female respondents aged 40 to 70 who had a liv-
ing mother at the start of the sample period. First, the effect
of caregiving on well-being may differ based on the charac-
teristics of the caregiver and the care recipient, such as sex
concordance.10 Second, the most prevalent intergenera-
tional caregiving arrangement, nationwide3 and in survey
data,11 is daughters providing care to their mothers. The
final sample consisted of 3,427 adult daughters and 14,645
person-wave observations.
Measures
In the HRS, respondents are asked whether they or their
spouses had spent 100 or more hours in the past 2 years
helping their parents with “basic personal needs like dress-
ing, eating, and bathing.” Follow-up questions are asked
about who was helped and how many hours of care the
respondent and her spouse separately provided. Respon-
dents were also asked whether they helped with “household
chores, errands, transportation, etc.,” with similar follow-
up questions. A woman is defined as a caregiver if she pro-
vided either type of care, and the hours she spent providing
both types of care are summed to determine the amount of
care provision. We distinguish between light (<1,000 hours
of care over 2 years) and intensive (≥1,000 hours of care)
caregiving. In implementing the model, we assigned the
median number of hours of care to each group: 200 hours
of
care
per
period
for
light
and
1,560
hours
for
intensive care.
In the model, women could not work, work part-time,
or work full-time. Those who worked part-time were
assumed to work 2,000 hours per 2-year period, and those
who worked full-time were assumed to work 4,000 hours
per
2-year
period.
Additional
covariates
include
the
woman’s education, nonlabor income, and family structure.
In particular, in each wave, the woman reported her marital
status and the number and sex of living siblings.
The HRS asks each respondent about her parent’s
health. In particular, the respondent is asked whether her
mother needs help with activities of daily living (ADLs),
whether she can be left alone for 1 hour or more, and after
1996, whether a doctor has ever told the mother that she
has a memory-related disease. We used these measures to
define 6 health states: healthy, ADL limitations only, a
memory-related disease only, ADL limitations and a diag-
nosed memory-related disease, cannot be left alone for
1 hour or more, and death. Although a variety of ailments
could lead to an individual not being able to be left alone,
two-thirds of this group were reported to have a doctor-
diagnosed memory-related disease.
Analysis
Discrete choice models describe and predict the choices peo-
ple make when deciding between 2 or more alternatives, for
example, working or not, providing informal care or not.
Dynamic discrete choice models recognize that these deci-
sions are not static, one-time decisions but have implica-
tions for future periods, particularly future well-being. We
used a dynamic discrete choice model that follows directly
from previous work.11 Details of the model can be found in
Appendix S1. The main point of departure from the earlier
model is the more granular classification of maternal
health.11
This methodology allowed us to perform the following
mental exercise. In each 2-year period, the adult daughter
makes decisions about how to spend her time between lei-
sure, work (no work, part time, full time), and informal
care (no care, light care, intensive care) to maximize her
well-being not just today, but also over her lifetime. For
example, a daughter who decides to work full or part time
today knows her expected wage offer will be higher in the
next period because of the returns to experience and human
capital formation. If she decides to work part time today
rather than full time, her hourly wage may be lower if part-
time jobs earn less than full-time jobs, and her ability to
find a full-time job in the future may be lower if there are
difficulties moving between full- and part-time employment.
Finally, if she opts not to work at all, working in the future
may be difficult because it is likely that she will have limited
job offers and lower wages because of the loss of human
capital.
Informal care can affect individual well-being in the fol-
lowing ways:
Direct utility effect: Caregiving can directly affect well-
being—one could like it or dislike it. Caregiving effects on

 well-being can vary according to duration (first time provid-
ing care vs continuing providing care), parent’s health
(ADL limitations, memory-related disease, combination of
the two, cannot be left alone), and whether there is a sister
who could share the responsibility.
Indirect effect through change in leisure time: Some
individuals may value leisure more than others, and this
valuation may change with age (e.g., after retirement, indi-
viduals may value each additional hour of leisure more
or less).
Indirect effect through change in labor market opportu-
nities and earnings: Providing informal care may affect how
much one works today, affecting consumption today, as
well as their wages and employability in the future.
The value of these effects is determined by observing a
daughter’s decisions about caregiving, work, and leisure as
a mother progresses through these health states.
The daughter’s well-being is measured by observing her
choices, what economists refer to as “revealed preference.”
Individuals choose the options that give them the highest
expected lifetime well-being. Variation in choices between
individuals and over time allows us to estimate the prefer-
ence parameters (along with functional form assumptions,
distributional assumptions, and normalizations), and well-
being is quantified using these parameters and observed
choices about caregiving, work, and leisure as the mother’s
health status and the daughter’s work opportunities change.
We used the estimated model to calculate the well-
being of each daughter when she had the choice of provid-
ing informal care (baseline model). In a separate simulation
exercise, for all women aged 55 and 56 with an ill mother,
we removed the choice of not providing care and “forced”
them to provide informal care in that period. When we
“forced” women to provide care, they still optimized their
well-being through their remaining choices regarding time
spent working and time spent on leisure. We then compared
the daughter’s well-being between the two scenarios. For
women who provided care in the baseline scenario, their
change in well-being was 0.
We calculated the costs of informal care for women
whose caregiving behavior changed from not providing care
in the baseline scenario to providing it in the simulation.
We calculate costs to well-being, which is the lump-sum
amount of money a woman would have to receive to be
equally well off in the 2 scenarios, and report the median
costs. We calculated labor earnings forgone because of care-
giving by limiting the sample to women who changed their
caregiving behavior and their work decisions when we
removed the option not to provide care.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for our (unweighted)
sample of women based on their current caregiving status
(with a mother no longer alive), noncaregiver (with a
mother alive), light caregiver, intensive caregiver). Not sur-
prisingly, caregiving becomes more prevalent with age.
There was also a positive relationship between not working
and caregiving intensity, which suggests difficulty in com-
bining work with caregiving responsibilities, but education
is less correlated with caregiving activity. Caregiving fre-
quency and intensity increased as the mothers’ health
declined. The percentage married varied across these cate-
gories, likely reflecting an increase in widowhood as women
age and resulting differential time and availability to
provide care.
In Figure 1, we present estimates of the direct utility
effects of care provision according to the health state of the
mother and the intensity of care provision. (Main model
parameter estimates are available in Supplementary Table S1.)
Providing informal care to a mother who has neither ADL
limitations nor memory-related disease decreases the well-
being of the daughter no matter how many hours of care are
provided. Light caregiving has a concave relationship with
well-being across the health states, positively affecting the
well-being of the daughter across all health states except the
healthiest and the sickest.
Intensive caregiving does not exhibit the same concave
pattern. The most noteworthy difference is between ADL
limitations (only) and memory-related disease (only). Inten-
sive caregiving for mothers with memory-related disease
decreases well-being, whereas caregiving for mothers with
ADL limitations increases well-being. Only when memory
impairment is combined with ADL limitations does inten-
sive caregiving yield positive direct effects on well-being.
Figure 2 presents 2 estimates of the cost of care provi-
sion according to the health state of the mother; median
current forgone earnings and median cost to well-being.
The first methodology leads to an estimate of $24,500 over
2 years over all health states, with little variation over the
health states. These estimates align with those found in the
literature, which range from $21,220 to $26,043 (in 2008
dollars).11–14
The estimate of the median cost to well-being over all
health states is approximately $180,000 over 2 years,
approximately 7 times the cost estimate using the current
forgone wage approach. In addition, there is variation in
the cost to well-being across health states. The costs to a
daughter’s well-being of caring for someone with memory-
related disease varies considerably, depending on whether
there are also ADL limitations. For example, caring for
someone with memory-related disease but no ADL limita-
tions costs approximately $163,000—similar to the costs of
providing care for a mother who has only ADL limitations
($167,000)—but when memory problems are paired with
ADL
limitations,
the
costs
of
caregiving
decrease
to
$144,000 because of the direct positive utility effect of care-
giving for mothers with memory-related disease and ADL
limitations (Figure 1). When the mother cannot be left alone
for more than 1 hour, the costs again rise to more
$200,000 over 2 years.
DISCUSSION
Focusing on the most prevalent caregiving dyad, we esti-
mate the effects of caregiving on the well-being of the infor-
mal care provider. We compare forgone wages because of
caregiving with a more comprehensive measure of cost that
accounts for the dynamic nature of caregiving, the long-
term effect on earnings and work, the effect on leisure, and
the direct effect of caregiving on well-being. Our preferred
method suggests that the median cost to well-being is
approximately $180,000, 7 times the forgone wage esti-
mate. To put these costs into perspective, the average cost

 of a semiprivate bed in a nursing home was $85,775 in
2017—a 2-year cost of nursing home care of $171,550.15
Our results suggest that the costs of informal care to a
daughter’s well-being are similar to those of full-time insti-
tutional care. The cost comparability suggests that further
work is needed in assessing the benefits of these 2 different
types of care. The BrightFocus Foundation’s recent recom-
mendations include making home the nexus of dementia
care but recognize the need to put in place numerous
community-based interventions to maximize quality of
life.16
This work highlights that there is heterogeneity in the
costs of informal care to the daughter’s well-being based on
the health of the mother. There are a variety of plausible
mechanisms that could explain the nonlinear relationship
between the direct utility effects of caregiving and the
mother’s health. The direct utility effects reflect utility gains
from care provision, which may be derived from reciproc-
ity, responsibility norms, or altruism, as well as the utility
losses from care provision, which may stem from caregiving
being stressful and burdensome. Providing care may lead to
larger net benefits to the caregiver as the care recipient gets
sicker, but when health impairments become severe, care-
giving may become more burdensome. Providing intensive
care to someone with memory problems provides lower
direct utility to the caregiver than providing care to some-
one with ADL limitations. This difference could be driven
by a clearer understanding by the caregiver and other

 support systems of what is needed to provide care for some-
one with an ADL limitation as opposed to a memory prob-
lem. Although caring for someone with memory problems
seems to have the same implications for well-being as caring
for someone with only ADL limitations, combining the 2 types
of health problems makes a big difference in terms of cost.
To gauge the economic importance of caregiving, we
made a quick calculation. There were an estimated 14.7
million family and unpaid caregivers in 2011, approxi-
mately half of whom were children providing care to par-
ents, and approximately half of the care recipients had
dementia.17 Using the most conservative estimates of the
median
costs
to
the
daughter’s
well-being
related
to
memory-related disease and assuming they were a lower
bound for other caregiving dyads, the cost of informal care
was at least $277 billion in 2011, 20% greater than the cur-
rent estimate of $230.1 billion3.
Our study has limitations. Structural models in general,
of which dynamic discrete choice models are one, require a
detailed specification of the decision-making problem. We
must specify the constraints, preferences, and determinants
of well-being and the choices people face. Although we
tested many assumptions and conducted numerous sensitiv-
ity analyses to ensure the robustness of our estimates, they
may be biased if we misspecified the model. For example,
we missed small adjustments in hours worked because of
the discrete nature of the choices. We limited our analysis
to mother–daughter dyads, the most common intergenera-
tional caregiving relationship observed. Our estimates may
not be generalizable to other intergenerational caregiving
pairs. Finally, we are limited in our definition of the health
of the care recipient because of the survey data; these are
self-reported health measures by the daughter and not clini-
cal assessments. Furthermore, we could not separate condi-
tions distinctly or identify the presence or severity of
behavioral problems which are likely to have complicated
the caregiving relationship.
CONCLUSION
As the long-term care service and supports policy continues
to discuss “rebalancing,”18 or reducing the bias toward
institutionalization in insurance coverage, the costs to care-
givers’ well-being must be kept in mind. Moving someone
from full-time institutional care to home, even with the sup-
port of formal home health care or community-based care,
as the BrightFocus Foundation recommends,16 inevitably
requires additional support from the family.19 When con-
sidering only forgone earnings because of caregiving, these
policy changes may seem to be cost reducing on a societal
level, but accounting for the cost to the well-being of the
caregiver may alter the calculation.
