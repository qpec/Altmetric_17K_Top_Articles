Abstract
Purpose There is growing evidence of significant harmful
effects of loneliness. Relatively little work has focused on
how best to reduce loneliness in people with mental health
problems. We aim to present an overview of the current
state of the art in loneliness interventions in people with
mental health problems, identify relevant challenges, and
highlight priorities for future research and implementation.
Methods A scoping review of the published and grey lit-
erature was conducted, as well as discussions with relevant
experts, to propose a broad classification system for types
of interventions targeting loneliness.
Results We categorised interventions as ‘direct’, targeting
loneliness and related concepts in social relationships, and
‘indirect’ broader approaches to well-being that may
impact on loneliness. We describe four broad groups of
direct interventions: changing cognitions; social skills
training and psychoeducation; supported socialisation or
having a ‘socially-focused supporter’; and ‘wider com-
munity approaches’. The most promising emerging evi-
dence appears to be in ‘changing cognitions’, but, as yet,
no approaches have a robust evidence base. Challenges
include who is best placed to offer the intervention, how to
test such complex interventions, and the stigma surround-
ing loneliness.
Conclusions Development of clearly defined loneliness
interventions, high-quality trials of effectiveness, and
identifying which approaches work best for whom is
required. Promising future approaches may include wider
community initiatives and social prescribing. It is impor-
tant to place loneliness and social relationships high on the
wider public mental health and research agenda.

Introduction
Loneliness refers to a subjective unpleasant feeling arising
from a mismatch between a person’s desired level of
meaningful social relationships, and what they perceive
they actually have [1]. It is related to (but distinct from) a
range of concepts, such as social isolation, social capital,
and social network, which are measured using objective
means (Table 1). Crucially, it is the persistent subjective
feeling of loneliness that has been shown to be a strong
independent indicator of multiple physiological changes
and poor health outcomes [2–8].
Transient loneliness may have an adaptive purpose [9],
driving the individual to find ways to reduce it, but pro-
longed loneliness is increasingly recognised as a significant
public health issue [10, 11]. Over a third of over-50s report
experiencing loneliness in the UK [12], and one in five US
adults, with evidence the prevalence may be increasing
[13]. There is also a peak in adolescence [14].

 demonstrating both increased morbidity and mortality
[15–17]. In comparison, relatively little work has focused
on the impact of loneliness in people with mental health
problems, and consequently how best to tackle it.
Marked
cross-sectional
associations
exist
between
loneliness and mental health problems [18], including
depression (OR 10.85) and anxiety (OR 11.56) [19]. People
who feel lonely are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease
and cognitive impairment [7, 20, 21]. Loneliness is also
correlated with eating disorders [22], sleep problems [23],
and both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts [24]. Fewer
studies look at its relationship with psychosis, but one
survey showed 80% of people reported it as a ‘major
challenge’ with levels significantly higher than in the
general population [25], while another highlighted loneli-
ness in ultra-high-risk-for-psychosis states [26].
The UK National Health Service (NHS) Five-Year-
Forward View for Mental Health [27] mentions peoples’
wish for good quality relationships, but does not discuss the
impact of loneliness. We argue that there is an urgent need
to consider how best to address this issue. This comes in
the context of a renewed drive to consider social determi-
nants of mental health outcomes [28].
Aim
We aim to present an overview of the current ‘state of the
art’ in interventions to address loneliness (and closely
related constructs) in people with mental health problems.
This has been achieved through a scoping review of the
literature as well as discussions with relevant experts,
including academics, clinicians, service users, and social
entrepreneurs. All the interventions included have the
potential to alleviate loneliness, although we have included
studies with varying primary targets (i.e., loneliness, social
isolation, social networks, and social support), given the
potential relevance to future loneliness interventions. We
draw on the available evidence and emerging themes to
describe existing approaches and challenges, and propose

 future priorities in the complex field of improving social
relationships and mental health.
Existing reviews
Early reviews on tackling social isolation in older people
highlighted the value of social skills training and suggested
educational groups were most effective, while others con-
cluded that there was little evidence for effective inter-
ventions at all [29, 30].
A 2011 meta-analysis of loneliness and social isolation
interventions [31] identified four primary strategies: (1)
improving social skills; (2) enhancing existing social sup-
port; (3) increasing opportunities for new social contact;
and (4) addressing maladaptive social cognitions. Only one
small study included people with ‘serious and persistent’
mental health problems. Compared with other designs in
the meta-analysis, the 20 randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) showed the smallest effect size (-0.198). Of the
four intervention strategies, the four RCTs of cognitive
interventions yielded the greatest effect size (-0.598)
compared with, for example, 12 studies enhancing social
support (-0.162). This sits well alongside evidence of
cognitive changes in people who feel lonely [32], but the
small effect sizes and few studies of people with mental
health problems included limit generalisation of these
findings.
A more recent systematic review looked at interventions
targeting social networks (not loneliness) in psychosis, and
found five trials of highly varied interventions, with some
limited evidence of effectiveness [33].
A classification system
Our literature search and discussions with relevant experts
contributed to a proposed classification system (Table 2).
We refer to interventions explicitly targeting loneliness and
related concepts in social relationships as ‘direct’ inter-
ventions. In contrast, ‘indirect’ broader approaches to
health and well-being do not specifically aim to address
loneliness but nevertheless may have important impacts on
loneliness. Under direct interventions, we describe four
groups: ‘changing cognitions’, ‘social skills and psychoe-
ducation’, ‘supported socialisation’, and ‘wider community
approaches’. The interventions fitted broadly into these
categories based on their main approach, but they are not
mutually exclusive. We describe the interventions, along
with relevant evidence where available, in more detail
below.
Changing cognitions
These interventions aim to shift the so-called ‘maladaptive’
cognitions in people experiencing loneliness. There is
evidence people who feel lonely (whether they have mental
health problems or not) have particular cognitive biases
and attributional styles, which may overlap with cognitions
contributing to mental health problems. Loneliness can
lead to negative evaluations of other people, for example,
and a lack of interpersonal trust [5]. Different cognitive
mechanisms may contribute to maintaining loneliness at
different stages of life [34] and recent studies highlight the
potential for negative schemata in leading to paranoia in
psychosis [26, 35].
The intended mechanism is changing an individual’s
thinking, for example, the way they think about themselves
in relationships, their possible assumptions about other
peoples’ views, or their expectations of ‘success’ at over-
coming loneliness. The hypothesis is that these changes can
in turn lead to changed social behaviours and a reduction in
individual loneliness over time. Such interventions can be
delivered on a one-to-one basis, in groups or through dig-
ital technology.
As part of an ongoing related systematic review, we
identified ten published RCTs on cognitive approaches to
improving loneliness or related concepts (social sup-
port/social networks/social isolation) in people with mental
health problems [36–45]. In depression, ‘online cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) plus motivational interviewing
(MI)’ was compared with ‘online CBT plus brief advice’ in
primary care. Both interventions reduced loneliness at 12
months, with no advantage in adding the MI component
[37]. Another study tested whether cognitive ‘reframing’ of
loneliness led to greater perceived control over reducing it,
but found no significant impact [36].
In mothers with depression postpartum, neither ‘spe-
cialised CBT’ nor ‘internet-based behavioural activation’
had a significant impact on perceived social support [40],
and an older study showed no benefit in adding ‘cognitive
modification’ in social phobia [44]. In children experienc-
ing grief and trauma, there was no added benefit from
narrative therapy on social support [38]. Two small, related,
trials of narrative exposure therapy in post-traumatic stress
disorder provided mixed results: one showed an improve-
ment in social support, while the other did not [43, 45].
Considering the general population, a recent integrative
review concluded that a range of approaches to reduce
loneliness and social isolation in older people are currently
being tested or developed. It identified ‘psychological
therapies’ as having the most ‘robust’ evidence to date.
However, all the interventions were delivered in groups,
Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:627–638
629
123
 and it was not possible to determine the relative contribu-
tions of general group interactions compared with the
specific therapeutic intervention [46]. In younger people, a
recent feasibility trial of a mindfulness intervention in
Chinese college students suggested that it could reduce
loneliness scores [47].
A key consideration in interventions of this type is that
the people offered treatment have definite cognitive biases,
which in turn impact on their loneliness. However, none of
the studies identified take steps to specifically measure
such biases at baseline. Targeting a mixed group of lonely
people, who may or may not demonstrate such cognitive
patterns, could mean important treatment effects are
missed.
All in all, the evidence base for cognitive interventions
for loneliness is in its infancy, despite being the best
studied of the intervention types described here. Larger,
adequately powered studies with longer follow-ups, and
loneliness as a primary outcome, will be more informative.
Future studies should explore the mechanisms involved in
bringing about any changes and how delivery mode (e.g.,
digital, group, or individual) influences effectiveness.
Social skills training and psychoeducation
These interventions focus on practical ‘training’, educa-
tion, or improving awareness of ‘social skills’, to reduce
loneliness or improve social support. ‘Skills’ include a
broad range, such as conversational ability and reflecting
on body language. Psychoeducational programmes may
be aimed at individuals, groups, and/or families, are
typically diagnosis-focused, and include information on
the importance of social relationships. The hypothesis is

These broad groups are not designed to be mutually exclusive, and there is scope for approaches to be combined in some interventions. Some

 that such practical advice and information will better
equip the individual to form meaningful relationships and
have better skills to prioritise and maintain them over
time. There is of course scope for such interventions to
be combined with psychological therapy approaches,
such as CBT.
RCTs of social skills/psychoeducation have been con-
ducted with people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia,
but all measured perceived social support, and not loneli-
ness. An online self-help intervention, including psychoe-
ducation and group discussion boards, led to a significant
improvement in social support [48], though the study had a
high attrition rate. Four further RCTs did not show sig-
nificant changes in social support after psychoeducation
programmes, including a mixed diagnosis peer-delivered
recovery course [49–52].
A social skills, psychoeducation, and physical health
group in older people with depression had no impact on
social support [53]. A recent review of social skill groups
to reduce loneliness in high-functioning autism concluded
that there was ‘tentative’ evidence, they are effective, but
the studies included were either quasi-experimental or
single-arm trials [54].
Dr. Catherine Haslam, clinical psychologist and aca-
demic, discussed the ‘Groups 4 Health’ project (inter-
view with JB), which takes a ‘social identity’ approach.
It features modules educating people about the impor-
tance of social relationships and strengthening relevant
resources. There was a notable dropout rate, but in stu-
dents with mood disturbance, there was a reduction in
loneliness [55]. Social identity theory essentially posits
that people derive an important part of their identity and
self-esteem through belonging to groups (e.g., being
‘American’/being a football fan). The hypothesis is that
such a sense of social identity is a key mechanism in
why groups (such as psychoeducation or indeed psy-
chological therapy groups) may have beneficial effects
on mental health [56].
Of note, a recent systematic review found that active
therapy groups were no more effective than sham therapy
groups in schizophrenia [57]. An important consideration
in all group interventions addressing loneliness will,
therefore, be to take steps to consider group interaction
effects.
It is possible that social skill programmes may work best
in combination with other approaches, or may be suited to
people who prefer not to engage with in-depth psycho-
logical therapy or wish for ‘preparation’ before attending
wider community groups. There is scope for such inter-
ventions to be delivered to individuals, groups, by peers or
digitally. The evidence of an impact on loneliness, how-
ever, is at this point limited.
Supported socialisation or having a ‘socially-
focused supporter’
Here, people are offered support and guidance to select and
attend activities. There is some overlap with ‘social skills’,
but in these interventions, there is a particular person
assigned to help the individual work towards specific goals
(usually attendance at groups to reduce loneliness). The
support may be from professionals, family, other volun-
teers, or peer support workers and is typically (though not
necessarily) time-limited. The ‘supporter’ aims to improve
the chances of successfully reducing loneliness by sup-
porting the person to make their own decisions, jointly
reviewing their needs, identifying what support might be
helpful,
helping
select
the
most
appropriate
activi-
ties/groups,
and
providing
relevant
motivation
and
guidance.
An RCT of ‘supported socialisation’ involved volun-
teers identifying suitable community activities for an
individual, and supporting the person to attend for 3–6
months [58]. They found social network improvement but
did not measure loneliness and the improvement was not
found for the people classed most clinically unwell.
An RCT including people with severe mental health
problems compared matching with a volunteer plus a sti-
pend (20 Euros), against offering a stipend alone, to pro-
mote group attendance [59]. Both conditions led to an
improvement in social loneliness with no additional benefit
from having the volunteer. The authors comment: ‘…it is
possible the demand to establish a ‘friendship’ with a
stranger within the study timeframe…mitigated against
realising the benefits of such friendships in the short term.’
A previous review suggested that the majority of benefits
accrued through befriending programmes tend to occur
after the first year [60]. Whether provision of a stipend
alone (compared with treatment as usual) provides addi-
tional benefits may be worth exploring in the future.
Formal peer support (PS) refers to organised support
provided by people with lived experience of mental health
problems (as opposed to naturally occurring informal
support). PS trials identified were relatively new and con-
ducted in mixed diagnostic groups [61–63], but had no
significant impact on loneliness.
A systematic review on PS interventions (without a
specific focus on loneliness) concluded that there was
limited evidence on their effectiveness in severe mental
illness, and suggested that new interventions are best rolled
out in the context of well-designed research studies [64].
One challenge is accounting for the wide variation in what
peers deliver, and demonstrating that it is indeed the active
peer support element that is driving change. RCT data from
an ongoing UK study trialling a PS intervention in people

631
123
 with mental health problems are expected in the near future
[65], including assessing its impact on loneliness.
Mark Swift (social entrepreneur at Well-being Enter-
prises) [66] discussed employing ‘well-being officers’ who
offer one-to-one support around well-being, including
loneliness. Such ‘well-being officers’ offer particular
knowledge about their local communities, and insights into
what specific opportunities may be available for the indi-
vidual they see, as well as advice on how to develop new
groups or activities in the community. The ‘Hounslow
Well-being Network’ [67] builds on ‘network-mapping’
research and offers ‘asset mapping’ to help people better
understand their social networks [68].
A feasibility trial employing ‘community navigators’ to
work with clients in secondary mental healthcare is cur-
rently under way [69]. The ‘navigator’s role is to collab-
oratively map out and review an individual’s existing
relationships (including any strengths), develop an ‘action
plan’ to engage in any activities identified, and offer
practical and financial supports. Such link workers are an
important part of social prescribing (discussed below).
None of the identified studies explored any role for
personality features, e.g., introvertedness, and how these
influence ‘responsiveness’ to such interventions. Baseline
measures of such characteristics may give more informa-
tive results.
The ‘Campaign to End Loneliness’, in a recent report,
discussed the importance of one-to-one support for people
for whom the barriers to ‘getting out’ were too great [70].
In the general population, they point out that the evidence
is ‘too weak’ to state that such initiatives (though ‘highly
valued’) are effective at reducing loneliness.
Wider community groups
Given the apparent modest impact of cognitive approaches
or social skills training, one argument is that they do not
take into account the wider context in which the individual
exists. Targeting an individual’s cognitions and preparing
them to ‘get involved’ in their community may have lim-
ited impact if there are no efforts to create a broader sense
of connectedness in the community itself. Groups that
appeal to a wider range of members, with or without
mental health problems, may facilitate better integration,
reduce stigma, and boost one’s confidence as a member of
wider society.
Social prescribing (SP)
There is currently no widely agreed definition of SP with
the 2016 SP Annual Report highlighting 56 different
variations [71]. In essence, SP can refer to either: a) the
process of healthcare professionals (e.g., a general practi-
tioner) prescribing time with a link worker (e.g., a com-
munity navigator) or b) both the process of prescribing a
link worker and the subsequent community group/activity
that is recommended to the service user. SP establishes a
link between health services and potentially a very broad
range of social interventions, with the aim of improving
health and well-being (‘‘Box 1’’). With an estimated 76%
of family doctors reporting between one and five patients a
day attend primarily due to loneliness (whether or not they
identify it as the reason themselves), primary care is one
important point at which to identify lonely people [70].
The UK government has previously called for the
development of SP approaches in managing ‘chronic health
problems’. However, a 2015 report on SP [72] found little
evidence to support widespread commissioning, making
this a research priority.
Asset-based community development (ABCD)
Several experts interviewed and discussed the importance
of involving various groups within communities in identi-
fying and mobilising individual and community ‘assets’, as
opposed to only focusing on deficits. ABCD supports and
encourages people to develop their own community pro-
jects, with the aim of improving both relevance of the
groups to local individuals and sustainability (e.g., [73]).
People who feel lonely may, therefore, be identified by a
family doctor and prescribed a social intervention. This in
turn comprises time with a person exploring their social
networks and circumstances, and referring on to commu-
nity groups that have developed as a result of ABCD, or
encouraging the individual to set up their own group
(promoting social entrepreneurship). Numerous promising
ABCD initiatives currently exist, but, as far as we are
aware, none have been subjected to peer-reviewed research
as yet.
Promoting city-wide loneliness initiatives
In 2016, ‘Macc’ (a voluntary sector organisation) sum-
marised the results of a series of projects aimed at reducing
loneliness and social isolation across the UK city of
Manchester [74]. Various organisations ran groups ranging
from befriending to communal eating and psychological
therapy, taking referrals from health and social services and
primary care. Again, there is no peer-reviewed evidence
published, but their own evaluation suggested improve-
ments in self-reported health and well-being. Such inter-
ventions may be a mix of direct and indirect approaches
(e.g., a ‘loneliness’ psychology group versus a ‘managing
diabetes’ group). Trials of such complex that varied com-
munity-wide interventions will be challenging to design
632
Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:627–638
123
 and evaluate; we suggest that researchers draw inspiration
from trials in other priority public health areas, such as
dietary education [75].
The aim is to bring about much wider awareness and
active participation in promoting social relationships and
reducing (or preventing) loneliness. This in turn theoreti-
cally provides people experiencing loneliness and mental
health problems with a more receptive environment within
which to develop. This is a potentially valuable approach,
given evidence that various social factors can influence the
likelihood of experiencing loneliness.
Across these interventions, there is a pressing need to
match the growing service report and non-peer-reviewed
evidence on well-being, with high-quality research on
effectiveness across outcomes, including loneliness. There
is otherwise a risk of commissioning services that may not
have any lasting impact on loneliness and related health
outcomes.
Indirect interventions
There are a potentially vast range of indirect interventions
that may plausibly impact on loneliness. For example,
loneliness is known to be associated with poverty [76], thus
efforts to improve inequalities may have a significant
impact on loneliness levels. Wider initiatives to improve
employment opportunities (e.g., individualised placement
and support), education (e.g., recovery colleges), or hous-
ing may also be highly relevant. Initiatives that bring
people together for other purposes, such as physical health
programmes, may also be valid approaches to reducing
loneliness. Consideration of loneliness as an outcome in
these and other relevant policies/interventions should be a
priority.
Primary prevention
It is important to place loneliness higher on the public
mental health agenda. A key component of this could be
raising public awareness of the value of healthy social
relationships, similar to campaigns for other aspects of
healthy living, such as eating well or exercise. Communi-
ties that are better informed may be more likely to actively
engage in supporting those at risk of prolonged loneliness.
In an interview for this paper (with FM), Professor de
Jong Gierveld discussed her concern that the modest
impact of loneliness interventions to date may reflect the
need to focus on intervening much earlier, preventing more
chronic or ‘harder to shift’ loneliness from becoming
established. She highlighted the need to educate people
about actively investing in their ‘social convoys’ (the range
of existing social bonds in their life, such as family and
friends), but also pointed out the critical importance of
boosting the individual’s own motivation to actively
change their situation [77].
The NHS Five-Year-Forward View [27] calls for a focus
on prevention in important ‘lifestyle’ areas, such as obe-
sity, but not specifically social relationships. Similarly, the
UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
guidance on, e.g., schizophrenia or depression, do not
currently promote social relationships as areas to focus on
assessments. There has, however, been recent NICE guid-
ance issued on managing loneliness in the elderly [78].
Challenges
Who is lonely?
In older people, methods, such as using ‘geographical
information systems’, aim at identifying vulnerable people
[79]. In the UK, older people who have frequent hospital
attendances are identified as vulnerable to isolation. In the
mental health setting, the ‘Connecting People’ Study
showed that people using secondary mental health services
had better access to social capital than those only accessing
voluntary services [80], but we lack similar information in
people with mental health problems who experience
loneliness.
Stigma
Experts interviewed for this paper discussed how people
find it difficult to talk about loneliness, including the fact
that they may under-report it in questionnaires. Public
education initiatives would be one way of trying to reduce
negative or shameful attitudes to being lonely. There is
then the added stigma of mental illness, both from others
and internalised.
Dr.
Louise
Hawkley
(psychologist
and
senior
researcher) emphasized the societal barrier to inclusion as
being one of the biggest hurdles faced by people with
mental health problems (interview with FM). Addressing
issues of social exclusion and marginalization of course
require consideration of wider societal issues, including
where people with mental health problems are living or
employment opportunities.
What about the measures?
The two most commonly used loneliness scales are the
UCLA Loneliness Scale [81] and the de Jong Gierveld
loneliness scale [82]. Both were initially developed in the
general population, but have been used widely in mental
Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:627–638
633
123
 health studies. Two recent reviews explored a wide range
of tools used to measure social relationships [83, 84],
highlighting overlap between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’
scales. Having reliable and valid measures and clear defi-
nitions is fundamental to good quality research. Yet, when
trying to measure a concept as individual and nuanced as
feeling ‘lonely’, they can only go so far.
The most detailed means of unravelling the experience
is sound qualitative research and using the findings to sit
alongside and inform quantitative work. This should
extend to qualitative work exploring the acceptability of
current loneliness scales and developing more accept-
able tools if necessary. In several interviews, including
with academic psychiatrist Dr. Domenico Giacco, we dis-
cussed the difficulty of measuring the more ‘abstract’
concept of loneliness and questioned whether more tangi-
ble concepts, such as social networks, present a more
practical target. Another challenge is ascertaining how
loneliness relates to other meaningful improvements in
people’s lives, including clinical outcomes, and trajectories
of loneliness over time.
One size does not fit all
There is a need to consider the needs of less well-re-
searched groups, such as people with physical disabilities
and people that typically get excluded from large trials
(e.g., substance misuse populations [85] or different cul-
tural groups [86]. One way of accounting for such differ-
ences is to explore each person’s needs early on in any
intervention.
Mapping
an
individual’s
‘well-being
network’ is one way of having a conversation about
existing networks and activities, as well as their impact on
well-being. Mapping allows people to explore whether
certain relationships are harmful to well-being, as well as
identifying where changes could be made. The process has
been evaluated positively in qualitative interviews [87].
The ‘Connecting People’ study used ethnographic methods
to explore how professionals and people with psychosis
discussed social networks and developed a tool to support
this process [80].
Any exploration of the complex feeling of loneliness
should ideally explore the person’s individual circum-
stances, including their views on what may have ‘led’ to
their feeling lonely. An intervention for a bereaved older
man may be different to the approach chosen to help an
adolescent struggling with social skills, for example.
Whose problem is it anyway?
A key consideration is the issue of where various respon-
sibilities lie. Professionals can find it hard to recognise
where the boundaries between their role(s) and the indi-
vidual’s own responsibilities begin in this context [87].
Thinking more broadly, there is the distribution of
responsibilities between various levels in society (Fig. 1).
With social prescribing projects potentially funded by
health or social care, and provided by local authorities,
third sector or health services, there is potentially no clear
‘ownership’ of such projects. Qualitative work with older
people has highlighted some peoples’ reluctance to discuss
loneliness in healthcare settings [88].

for interventions in loneliness.
Examples of possible
interventions for loneliness in
people with mental health
problems at each level. There is
overlap and crossover between
the levels, e.g., supported
socialisation requires someone
to help the individual socialise
and groups and activities for the
person to attend. Interventions
at the community level may also
require societal change

 Other research priorities
Synthesizing evidence
Synthesizing existing evidence systematically, demon-
strating effectiveness and subjecting it to peer-review, will
strengthen arguments for investment and wider develop-
ment of such approaches. This is best achieved through a
combination of quantitative and qualitative work. It will
require partnerships between third sector (non-statutory) or
other organisations and academic institutions, each bring-
ing their own expertise. A centralised database, dedicated
to innovations or information-sharing on social relationship
interventions, could be helpful.
Which aspect(s) should we focus on?
It has been argued that social isolation is of greater rele-
vance in predicting poor physical health [89], while others
have argued that loneliness is a stronger predictor [8].
There is also evidence of the impact of social capital on
mental health [90], as well as other aspects of social rela-
tionships. Future studies that tease out how such distinct
but related factors interact will be crucial in improving our
understanding of mechanisms involved.
Missing mechanisms?
Further exploration of the mechanisms involved in leading
to, or maintaining, loneliness will also be crucial. Most
existing work has been in the general population, but one
study suggests that loneliness mediates a relationship
between internalised stigma and depression in people with
psychosis, while another suggested that loneliness is a
contextual moderator that may strengthen the trauma–
psychosis relationship [91]. Other relevant psychological
phenomena, such as motivation and level of perceived
control/autonomy, were also highlighted as under-investi-
gated. Dr. Hawkley pointed out trials that demonstrated
loneliness interventions to be effective only when the
participants had greater perceived control over various
aspects of the intervention [92]. There is also a growing
body of evidence for likely physiological impacts/corre-
lates of loneliness [13].
Conclusion
An impressively wide range of interventions to reduce
loneliness and related constructs are already being run in
various different communities. These typically involve
older people, but some support adults with mental health
problems. As yet, no types of intervention have a robust
evidence base. Development of clearly defined interven-
tions, high-quality trials of effectiveness, and exploration
of which approaches might work best for whom is required.
Promising future approaches may include: public health
initiatives to create accepting communities, better designed
psychological intervention studies, greater use of digital
technology and programmes to link people with supportive
social activities, and opportunities within local communi-
ties. All of these must be considered in the context of wider
social policies, including housing, employment, welfare
benefits, and infrastructure, to support forming meaningful
social relationships that may improve health outcomes and
quality of life for people with mental health problems.

social
prescribing
pro-
grammes in the UK, although many more programmes are
in existence across the UK and beyond. These programmes
aim to improve health and well-being by linking people to
a range of community-based activities and increasing
social connections.
Men’s Sheds [93]
Having originated in Australia, Men’s Sheds are venues,
where members share tools and resources to work on
community projects. Sheds mostly attract older men, but
anyone can join and some have included women and young
people. Sheds facilitate skill-sharing, community projects,
and social interaction.
The Bromley by Bow Centre [94]
A healthcare professional can refer any adult to a social
prescribing coordinator. They discuss what is important for
the person’s well-being, identify beneficial local activities

 and services, and support people to start using them. Ser-
vices may include financial support, volunteering, arts, or
support groups.
The Rotherham Social Prescribing Service [95]
People with long-term health problems can be referred to
Social Prescribing Workers who identify suitable voluntary
or community services. For those with poor mobility,
transport or low confidence, workers will help them access
services and activities to improve their health and well-
being.
Well-being Enterprises [66]
Anyone can self-refer to a ‘Community Well-being Offi-
cer’ who performs a ‘well-being review’, including social
connections and how to overcome challenges. Officers
enrol people in activities, such as practical, well-being-
focused, or creative courses, where they can meet others
and learn new skills.
