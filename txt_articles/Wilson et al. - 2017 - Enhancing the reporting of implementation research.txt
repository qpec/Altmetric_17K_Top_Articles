Abstract
In the 10 years since the inception of Implementation Science, we have witnessed a continued rise in the number
of submissions received, reflecting the continued global interest in methods to enhance the uptake of research
findings into healthcare practice and policy. We receive over 750 submissions annually, and there is now a large
gap between what is submitted and what gets published. In this editorial, we restate the journal scope and
current boundaries. We also identify some specific reporting issues that if addressed will help enhance the
scientific reporting quality and transparency of the manuscripts we receive. We hope that this editorial acts as a
further guide to researchers seeking to publish their work in Implementation Science.
Background
In the 10 years since the inception of Implementation
Science, we have witnessed a continued rise in the num-
ber of manuscripts submitted. We now receive over
750 submissions annually (see Fig. 1), reflecting the
continued interest from researchers, funders and health
professionals and policy makers in promoting the uptake
of research findings into healthcare practice and policy.
The number of manuscripts published in Implementation
Science remains steady at around 150 per year.
The large gap between what is submitted and what
gets published is driven by two key issues, namely scope
and scientific quality. This editorial aims to address both
of these issues and act as a further guide to researchers
seeking to publish their work in Implementation Science.
Scope and boundaries
In 2015, we reviewed and provided a detailed explanation
and elaboration of our journal scope [1]. As of 2017, we
have no plans to expand further the boundaries of our
scope at this point in time. Therefore, our focus remains
on the publication of studies examining the implementa-
tion of evidence-based healthcare interventions, practices
or policies or the de-implementation of those demon-
strated to be of low or no clinical benefit or even harmful.
For implementation effectiveness, we seek to publish
studies that employ rigorous experimental or quasi-
experimental designs regardless of whether they report
effects or no effects. By rigorous, we mean those designs
that would be eligible for inclusion in the Cochrane
EPOC reviews [2]. This can include type 2 or type 3
hybrid designs where there is a dual a priori focus on
assessing
clinical
effectiveness
and
implementation
strategies, [3] but only where there is a clear justifica-
tion and major element of implementation research.
Type 2 designs have dual focus effectiveness and imple-
mentation outcomes, here, for example, testing both
the effectiveness of brief cognitive behavioural therapy
and the implementation strategies [4]. A type 3 is
where the primary emphasis is on evaluating imple-
mentation, in this instance of a diabetes prevention
programme, but where data on clinical outcomes are
also collected [5].
We continue to receive a considerable number of
studies testing novel clinical or population health inter-
ventions, where the effectiveness of the intervention or
practice has yet to be established. As our scope focuses
on the implementation of interventions of demonstrated
effectiveness, we routinely reject these manuscripts (and
offer transfer to other BMC journals). These exclusion
criteria extend also cover type 1 hybrid designs where
the focus is on testing effects of a clinical intervention
on relevant outcomes whilst observing and gathering

 information on implementation [3]. For instance, a clin-
ical trial of primary care management of survivors of
sepsis focused on patients’ quality of life as the primary
outcome also comprised a range of measures of imple-
mentation aspects [6]. Studies of this type fall outside of
our journal scope.
Alongside effectiveness, the journal scope also in-
cludes economic evaluation and qualitative research
that examines different aspect of interventions and con-
text which contribute to effectiveness. This includes the
study of adaptation and fidelity, mechanisms of impact
and contextual influences on implementation and out-
comes, sustainability and scalability as well as the study
of influences on provider, patient and organisational be-
haviour. Crucially, we expect the methods employed in
such studies to be an appropriate fit to the question(s)
being addressed and be informed by relevant concep-
tual frameworks.
We also welcome articles that present new methods
and articles that question or challenge existing imple-
mentation policies, practices, evidence or theory and
suggest modifications or alternatives. However, it is
worth noting that there is no shortage of frameworks
and theories relevant to implementation research [7, 8].
So rather than adding to the current pot, our preference
is for empirical studies that build and advance the exist-
ing theoretical base. With debate papers, we reject those
that fail to ground the central argument within the
existing implementation research literature. Many de-
bate papers would be of greater relevance if the argu-
ments posed were based upon systematic reviews of the
relevant evidence.
Table 1 presents the types of manuscripts likely to be
accepted by or rejected from Implementation Science.
This should assist prospective authors to judge whether
the journal is a suitable home for their research.
Enhancing reporting
Alongside failure to meet scope requirements, poor sci-
entific quality remains a common reason for rejection.
Promoting the development, refinement and quality of
implementation research was a key aim of the founding
editors [9] and remains so today. We therefore continue
to support and promote efforts to improve research
quality and transparency.
Prospective trial registration
Implementation Science supports initiatives to improve
the reporting of randomised trials. We have adopted the
ICMJE recommendation [10] and only normally con-
sider for publication trials that have been registered with
an appropriate publicly available trials database prior to
enrolment of the first participant/cluster. We will con-
sider retrospectively registered trials on a case by case
basis but will require authors to explain the reason(s) for
the delayed registration.
Whilst there are no fixed rules about the registration
of other study designs, we strongly encourage authors of
systematic reviews to prospectively register their review
with PROSPERO or other publicly accessible registries.
Enhancing research reporting
Over the last decade we have routinely required
authors submitting manuscripts that report trials to
complete the CONSORT checklist or relevant exten-
sion.
Similarly,
a
requirement
to
complete
the
PRISMA checklist has been enforced for authors sub-
mitting systematic reviews. No other checklists have
been routinely or uniformly enforced. As a journal
that receives manuscripts covering a wide range of
study designs, this has resulted in variation in the
standards of reporting of the research that we publish.

 Because our aim is to promote research quality and
transparency, and as an aid to our readers, reviewers
and editors, we now require authors submitting manu-
scripts (regardless of study design) to complete and in-
clude a design appropriate reporting checklist.
The website of the EQUATOR Network provides
details of all available reporting guidelines (www.equa-
tor-network.org). Authors of manuscripts (regardless
of study design) should refer to EQUATOR and ensure
that they complete and include a design appropriate
reporting checklist with their submission. Table 1 in-
cludes details of our preferred reporting formats; for
those research types where consensus is lacking on
reporting format (for example, in qualitative research),
we
encourage
authors
to
select
their
preferred
checklist.
Improving the quality of intervention description is as
much an issue for implementation research as it is for
other evaluations of complex interventions. Without suf-
ficient detail, it is difficult for readers to determine what
was actually implemented and/or for other researchers
to use or replicate the intervention in other studies.
Whilst TIDieR has been proposed for use in conjunction
with the CONSORT guidelines for trials, [11] improved
intervention description is relevant across all evaluative
study designs. Other relevant standards for reporting
implementation interventions (Standards for Reporting
Implementation studies —StaRI) [12] and for report-
ing behaviour change interventions (Workgroup for
Intervention Development and Evaluation Research—-
WIDER) [13] have been developed and are available.
We encourage authors to select their preferred guide-
line to enhance reporting of interventions.
With all submissions, we expect authors to clearly ar-
ticulate what is already known and what their work adds
to existing knowledge, theory and thinking in the field.
Many submissions currently fail to set the work in the
context of the existing literature. And so we will con-
tinue to reject manuscripts that do not clearly build on
current knowledge and understanding or appear to pro-
vide limited contributions.
Open Science
As an open access journal (with open peer review), we
are committed to making research and the datasets upon
which it is based, publicly accessible. A number of differ-
ent data sharing approaches have now been adopted
across the health and medical literature [14]. At Imple-
mentation Science, we have adopted the policies on data
availability of our publisher BMC. As part of online art-
icle submission, we now ask authors to include an
“Availability of Data and Materials” section in their
manuscript detailing the conditions by which the data
supporting their findings can be accessed. Authors who
do not wish to share their data must include a formal
statement that data will not be shared and give the rea-
son why. Full details of BMC policies can be found
under the Instructions for Authors section of our
website.
Conclusion
In this editorial, we have identified some specific report-
ing issues that if addressed will help enhance the scien-
tific
reporting
quality
and
transparency
of
the
manuscripts we receive. We also encourage prospective
authors to familiarise themselves with the journal scope

ward to the next 10 years as the field continues to grow
and evolve and to receiving research that continues to en-
hance the uptake of evidence-based practices or policies
to improve the quality and delivery of healthcare.
