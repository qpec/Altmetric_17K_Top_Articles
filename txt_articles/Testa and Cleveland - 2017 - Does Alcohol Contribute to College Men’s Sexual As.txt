ABSTRACT. Objective: The current longitudinal study was designed
to consider the time-varying effects of men’s heavy episodic drinking
(HED) and drinking setting attendance on college sexual assault perpe-
tration. Method: Freshman men (N = 992) were recruited in their first
semester and completed online measures at the end of their first five
semesters. Using multilevel models, we examined whether men with
higher frequency HED (or party or bar attendance) were more likely to
perpetrate sexual assault (between-person, Level 2 effect) and whether
sexual assault perpetration was more likely in semesters in which HED
(or party or bar attendance) was higher than each individual’s average
(within-person, Level 1 effect). Results: The between-person effect of
HED on sexual assault was not significant after accounting for the be-
tween-person effects of antisocial behavior, impersonal sex orientation,
and low self-control. The within-person effect of HED on sexual assault
perpetration was not significant. However, models substituting frequency
of party attendance or bar attendance revealed both between- and within-
person effects. The odds of sexual assault were increased for men with
higher bar and party attendance than the sample as a whole, and in
semesters in which party or bar attendance was higher than their own
average. Supplemental analyses suggested that these drinking setting ef-
fects were explained by hookups, with sexual assault perpetration more
likely in semesters in which the number of hookups exceeded one’s own
average. Conclusions: Findings point toward the importance of drink-
ing contexts, rather than drinking per se, as predictors of college men’s
sexual assault perpetration. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 78, 5–13, 2017)

A
LCOHOL IS BELIEVED TO PLAY a significant
role in college sexual assault, with half of sexual as-
sault incidents occurring when the perpetrator, the victim,
or both have been drinking (Abbey, 2002, 2011). College
women’s heavy episodic drinking (HED) increases risk
for sexual assault victimization, particularly incapacitated
rape (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2004; Parks et al., 2008; Testa &
Livingston, 2009). Because men and women drink together,
men’s drinking may also contribute to sexual assault; how-
ever, evidence has been limited. The current study examined
the independent role of college men’s drinking on sexual
assault perpetration over the first five semesters of college.
We considered whether men’s HED predicts sexual assault
perpetration (between-person effect) independent of whether
time-varying HED predicts when risk of perpetration is
elevated (within-person effect). Similarly, we considered
the between- and within-person effects of drinking contexts
(parties, bars) on sexual assault.
Effects of alcohol on sexual assault perpetration
Men’s HED is thought to contribute to sexual assault
perpetration via alcohol’s acute, pharmacological effect on
physical and sexual aggression (see Crane et al., 2015; Ito
et al., 1996, for reviews of this experimental literature). This
acute effect is consistent with the Alcohol Myopia Model
(see Giancola et al., 2010), which posits that intoxication
narrows attention to more salient, typically instigatory cues
(e.g., sexual arousal, Simons et al., 2016), while impairing
the ability to attend to less salient inhibitory cues (e.g.,
woman’s reluctance). In natural drinking settings, pharma-
cological effects may be enhanced by alcohol expectancy
effects (Abbey, 2011), i.e., the belief that alcohol enhances
sex (George et al., 2000) and that drinking women are more
interested in sex (George et al., 1995).
Consistent with these presumed mechanisms, cross-sec-
tional studies reveal a positive association between college
men’
s drinking and sexual assault perpetration (Abbey, 2011;
Abbey et al., 2014). Compared with nonperpetrators, per-
petrators drink more heavily (Koss & Gaines, 1993; Locke
& Mahalik, 2005; Tuliao & McChargue, 2014) and more
frequently within dating and sexual situations (Abbey et al.,
2001; Schwartz et al., 2001). Although the positive associa-
tion between drinking and sexual assault is consistent with
a pharmacological effect, heavy drinking men also possess
characteristics associated with sexual assault perpetration
(e.g., impulsivity, delinquency; Abbey et al., 2006; Thomp-
son et al., 2011). Within the influential Confluence Model
 6
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / JANUARY 2017
(Malamuth et al., 1991; 1995), sexual assault perpetrators
are characterized by impersonal sexuality (promiscuity) and
hostile masculinity, robust predictors of sexual assault both
independently (Abbey & McAuslan, 2004; DeGue & DiLi-
llo, 2004; Murnen et al., 2002) and synergistically (Jacques-
Tiura et al., 2007). Men’s alcohol use adds modest predictive
power to the Confluence Model (Abbey et al., 2006; Parkhill
& Abbey, 2008). For example, Abbey et al. (2011) found
an indirect effect of HED on sexual assault via increased
impersonal sex and sexual misperception.
Identifying men at risk for sexual assault is important for
targeting sexual assault prevention. However, few studies
have used longitudinal designs to determine whether col-
lege men’s drinking increases the risk of later perpetration.
Gidycz and colleagues (2007) found a relationship between
baseline HED and later perpetration that became nonsig-
nificant after accounting for prior sexual assault. Abbey and
McAuslan (2004) found that college students who perpe-
trated at more than one point in time were heavier drinkers
than those who perpetrated only once or not at all. A third
longitudinal study failed to find either a prospective or a
cross-sectional relationship (Loh et al., 2005).
In a prospective study of college men, Thompson et al.
(2011) found an indirect effect of Time 1 (T1) HED on T2
sexual assault mediated via T1 perceived peer norms sup-
porting sexual aggression. A subsequent path model revealed
that T1 HED predicted T3 sexual assault via T2 fraternity
membership, T2 peer norms supportive of sexual aggression,
and T2 HED (Kingree & Thompson, 2013). Taken together,
analyses suggest indirect effects of HED on sexual assault
via drinking contexts and social networks that facilitate
perpetration. Person-centered analyses were used to predict
high, increasing, and decreasing trajectories of perpetration
relative to no sexual assault over all 4 years. Changes in
sexual assault over time were associated with changes in
impulsivity, sexual compulsivity, peer norms, and hostile
masculinity but not with changes in drinking (Thompson et
al., 2013; 2015). However, men who never perpetrated drank
less than men with increasing, decreasing, or high perpetra-
tion trajectories (i.e., there was a between-person effect of
HED on sexual assault) (Thompson et al., 2015).
Effect of drinking settings on sexual assault perpetration
The indirect effects of HED on sexual assault via frater-
nity membership and peer norms (Kingree & Thompson,
2013) and via sexual misperception and impersonal sex
(Abbey et al., 2011) suggest the potential importance of
drinking settings. HED cannot lead to sexual assault unless
it occurs in a context in which a potential victim is present.
College students typically drink at parties and bars (Clapp et
al., 2006; Harford et al., 2002), settings that facilitate sexual
activity and attract people seeking to “hook up” (Norris et
al., 1996; Owen et al., 2011). These settings include women
who are sexually vulnerable because of their intoxication
(Graham et al., 2014; Testa & Livingston, 2009) and may
offer peer support for sexual aggression (Swartout, 2013).
Not surprisingly, college women’s party attendance is associ-
ated with sexual victimization (Cranney, 2015; Franklin et
al., 2012). Similarly, frequency of attending bars increases
women’s risk of sexual victimization independent of drink-
ing (Pino & Johnson-Johns, 2009), and men frequently
make sexual advances toward women in bars (Thompson &
Cracco, 2008). Men’s attendance at parties and bars may in-
crease the risk of sexual assault. However, to our knowledge,
the effects of drinking setting on sexual assault perpetration
previously had not been examined.
Present study
The current study examined the role of men’s alcohol use
on sexual assault perpetration over five semesters of college.
Most previous studies have used a between-participant ap-
proach to examine whether heavier drinking men are more
likely to perpetrate sexual assault. However, multilevel models
with repeated measures permit disaggregating within-person
from between-person effects (Curran & Bauer, 2011), allow-
ing testing of the hypothesis that sexual assault will be more
likely during semesters in which men drink more than their
average amount relative to semesters of less-than-average
drinking (i.e., a within-person effect). A positive within-
person effect of HED on sexual assault perpetration indicates
that changes in HED coincide with the odds of sexual assault,
independent of the association of sexual assault with being
a heavier drinker (i.e., the between-person effect). Because
the settings in which alcohol is consumed are also associated
with sexual assault, we considered the effects of party and bar
attendance as independent between- and within-person predic-
tors, hypothesizing positive associations for both effects.
We hypothesized that men who reported more frequent
HED, on average, would have increased odds of sexual as-
sault perpetration over time (a between-person effect). We
included as between-person covariates individual difference
variables associated with sexual assault perpetration: imper-
sonal sex orientation, hostility toward women, antisocial be-
havior (Abbey & Jacques-Tiura, 2011; Abbey & McAuslan,
2004), and self-control, which is negatively associated with
aggression in a variety of contexts (DeWall et al., 2011).
These covariates allowed us to determine whether there is a
between-person effect of drinking or drinking settings inde-
pendent of personality factors.
Method
Participants and procedures
All procedures were approved by the university’s institu-
tional review board. Participants included 994 freshman men
 TESTA AND CLEVELAND
7
who entered a large Northeastern public university in fall
2011. Sample composition was 72.2% White; 3.9% African
American; 5.2% Hispanic; 14.6% Asian American; and 4.1%
mixed, other, or not reported, slightly overrepresenting White
students from the class of 2011 overall (65.5% White). Most
lived on campus (67.0%), slightly less than the proportion
for all freshmen (74.0%).
Participants were recruited by email to participate in
a study of college men’s behaviors and attitudes over five
semesters of college. All first-semester freshman men
who resided in the United States, allowed their univer-
sity email address to be included in the student directory
(about 85% of the class), and were 18 or 19 on November
1, 2011, were invited. Nonresponders were sent up to five
email reminders and a letter to their permanent address
at Thanksgiving. Email invitations included a link to a
secure site, which required that participants provide a stu-
dent ID number to enter. After providing online informed
consent, respondents were directed to the 30-minute sur-
vey. On completion, they were asked to provide contact
information (preferred email address, phone number). The
response rate for the initial recruitment was 68.9% (994 /
1,442).
For the next four semesters, in November or April, par-
ticipants were sent a similar email invitation containing a
link to the survey, followed by up to five email reminders
and phone calls, if necessary. Men were able to continue
participation if they left the university; however, such men
accounted for no more than 8% of the participants (at
T5).
The participants were compensated $25 in Campus Cash
(or check) for completing Waves 1, 3, and 5 and $10 for
completing the briefer spring semester surveys at Waves 2
and 4. To encourage completion, each semester there was a
lottery in which one student was selected to win $400.
Measures
Time-varying indicators of HED, sexual assault perpetra-
tion, bar and party attendance, and hookups were assessed
each semester (T1–T5). Between-person indicators (self-
control, antisocial behavior, impersonal sex orientation,
hostility toward women) were assessed at T1.
Sexual aggression perpetration. This variable was as-
sessed using a 16-item version of the Sexual Experiences
Survey (SES) that measures unwanted contact, attempted
intercourse, and intercourse using verbal, physical force,
and incapacitation tactics (Abbey et al., 2007; Testa et al.,
2015a). Men were asked how many times they had done
each behavior over the past semester (never, once, or 2 or
more times). They were classified as perpetrators if they
reported one or more items.
Heavy episodic drinking. HED was assessed with the
item, “During the past semester, how often did you drink
5 or more drinks in a row in a single occasion (e.g., in the
same evening)?” Seven response categories ranged from 0
(never) to 6 (3 or more days per week). Students who indi-
cated in response to an earlier question that they never drank
skipped the questions and were assigned a 0.
Bar and party attendance. Men were asked, “During
the past semester, how often did you attend a party?” and
“. . . how often did you go to a bar or club?” Frequency
was assessed using the same 7-point scale used to assess
drinking.
Hookups. Respondents were provided the definition of a
hookup (“a romantic or sexual encounter between two people
who are strangers, friends, or acquaintances. Some physical
interaction is typical but it may or may not involve sexual
intercourse”) and asked how many hookups they had had in
the past semester. At Waves 1 and 3, hookups were assessed
with an open-ended scale and responses were Winsorized
to the 95th percentile (Reifman & Keyton, 2010). At others
waves, hookups were assessed with a 6-point scale ranging
from 0 to 5 or more.
Self-control (T1). This variable was assessed using the 13-
item Brief Self-Control Scale (Tangney et al., 2004). Items
(e.g., “Sometimes I can’t stop myself from doing something
even if I know it is wrong”) were assessed on 5-point scales
ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) and summed (α
= .82).
Antisocial behavior (T1). Antisocial behavior was as-
sessed using the 18-item Antisocial Behavior Checklist,
adolescent version (Zucker, 2005), which includes items
such as “cursed at a teacher,” “skipped school,” or “beat
someone up.” Four response options included never, rarely,
sometimes, and often. Responses were assigned scores from
0 to 3 and summed (α = .82).
Hostility toward women (T1). This scale consisted of 10
items such as, “I am easily angered by women” and “I feel
that many times women flirt with men just to tease them or
hurt them” (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1995). These were rated
on 7-point scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree) and summed (α = .84).
Impersonal sex (T1). This composite variable was based
on the Sociosexuality Index (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991).
Three items assessed attitudes toward impersonal sex (e.g.,
“sex without love is okay”), using 9-point scales ranging
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree, α = .79). The
number of lifetime sex partners and the number of partners
desired in the next 5 years were assessed using open-ended
responses and then were Winsorized (to 95th percentile,
Reifman & Keyton, 2010) to reduce outliers. Men were
asked, “How often do you fantasize about having sex with
someone (other than your current dating partner if you have
one)?” using a 7-point scale (0 = never, 6 = at least once a
day). The four components (lifetime and 5-year sex partners,
sexual fantasies, impersonal sex attitudes) were standardized
and combined (α = .71).

Analytic strategy
Because the outcome variable was a dichotomous mea-
sure (sexual assault perpetration each semester), a series of
hierarchical generalized linear models were estimated to
examine the effects of HED on repeated measures of sexual
assault perpetration across the five semesters. Following es-
tablished recommendations (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002), the
between-person predictors (measured at T1) were centered
on the sample mean (i.e., grand-mean centered) to provide
between-person effects of these covariates. The time-varying
predictors were centered on each individual’s overall mean
(i.e., person-mean centered) to provide a within-person effect
(Level 1). Each individual’
s overall mean value was also cen-
tered on the grand mean to provide a between-person effect
(Level 2) for each time-varying predictor.
The resulting models specified a binomial distribution and
a logit link function to estimate the odds of sexual assault
perpetration each semester. We tested hypotheses by estimat-
ing three separate generalized linear mixed models. Model A
included only the between-person effects of HED. Model B
also included between-person effects of self-control, antiso-
cial behavior, impersonal sex, and hostility toward women.
Model C added the within-person effects of HED. Thus, the
hierarchical logistic model estimated in Model C can be
expressed as follows:
Level 1 (within-person) model:
logit (SA)it = �0 + �1iHEDit + eit
Level 2 (between-person) model:
�0i = �00 + �01HEDi + �02Time1 Covariatesi + u0i
�1i = �10
To test hypotheses regarding effects of drinking settings,
the three modeling steps described above were repeated with
the between-person and within-person effects of party atten-
dance and bar attendance replacing HED effects. All models
were estimated with SAS Proc Glimmix (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC) using the adaptive quadrature approach, the
recommended estimation procedure for hierarchical gener-
alized linear models (Hedeker, 2015). To take advantage of
full information maximum likelihood (FIML) for missing
data (Enders & Bandalos, 2001; Larsen, 2011), means,
variances, and covariances of predictors with missing data
were estimated. FIML addresses missing data by computing
parameter estimates and standard errors using all available
information from partially missing cases and produces less
biased and more efficient results than listwise deletion (Gra-
ham, 2009).
Results
Retention
Of 994 men who completed the T1 survey, 2 had missing
data on all 16 SES items and were dropped from subsequent
analyses. Of the remaining 992, 786 completed T2, 738 com-
pleted T3, 625 completed T4, and 658 completed T5. Nearly
90% completed at least two waves of data and 77.6% com-
pleted three or more waves. Subsequent analyses revealed
that the data were not missing completely at random, �2(229)
= 424.60, p < .001 (Little, 1988). However, univariate t test
comparisons revealed that the likelihood of missing data on
the sexual assault perpetration measures was significantly
associated with three of the four T1 covariates (self-control,
antisocial behavior, and impersonal sex) but not with T1
sexual assault perpetration or hostility toward women. In-
clusion of these variables in all subsequent analyses allowed
us to meet the missing-at-random assumptions that underlie
FIML estimation techniques (Enders, 2010).
Descriptives
The proportion of men who reported any sexual assault
(positive response to at least one SES item) was 5.9% at
T1, 7.0% at T2, 9.5% at T3, 6.6% at T4, and 9.3% at T5. Of
992 men, 175 (17.6%) reported sexual assault in at least one
semester (106 perpetrated it in one semester, 44 in two se-
mesters, and 25 in three or more). As shown in Table 1, men
who perpetrated sexual assault differed significantly from
those with no sexual assault on all key T1 variables. All vari-
ables in the table were positively and linearly associated with
whether perpetration occurred in zero, one, two, or three or
more semesters, all ps < .001. T1 correlations among pre-
dictors are presented in Table 2. The frequencies of HED,
party attendance, and bar attendance were highly correlated
at this and other waves (rs range: .43–.82), supporting our
decision to examine the effects of the three alcohol variables
in separate models.
Twenty-eight men reported on at least one survey that they
perpetrated all 16 SES items. Although this seemed implau-
sible and suggested frivolous responding, we believed it likely
that they had perpetrated some sexual assault. Men with this
unusual response pattern did not differ from other perpetrators
on key variables, and 15 of 28 (54%) reported perpetrating in

at least one other semester. We retained these men; however,
removing them from analyses did not alter results.
Preliminary model
Preliminary unconditional models revealed a small, linear
increase in sexual assault over time (b = 0.18, p < .001) but
no evidence for a quadratic effect. Thus, a random intercept
and a fixed linear slope term were included in all models.
Participants were more likely to report sexual assault on
long-form fall surveys compared with short-form spring sur-
veys; hence, a dummy-coded variable (0 = fall, 1 = spring)
was included as a main effect in all models. All models also
included an indicator of the participants’ relationship status
(0 = no, 1 = yes) reported each semester.
Model building to test hypotheses
Results of the series of hierarchical generalized linear
models are presented in Tables 3–5. In each table the esti-
mated binary logistic regression coefficients are presented
along with the corresponding standard errors; these represent
the log odds of reporting sexual assault perpetration for a
1-unit increase in the predictor variable. For ease of interpre-
tation, the associated odds ratios (ORs) for each predictor are
also provided. Table 3 displays the results for the within- and
between-person effects of HED on sexual assault perpetra-
tion. Model A revealed, as hypothesized, that sexual assault
was more likely among men who reported more frequent
HED than the sample as a whole (between-person effect, OR
= 1.51). However, HED was not significant after adding the
T1 covariates in Model B, which indicated between-person
effects of self-control (OR = 0.94), antisocial behavior (OR
= 1.07), and impersonal sex orientation (OR = 1.70) in the
expected directions. The within-person effect of HED, added
in Model C, was not significant.
Table 4 displays results substituting frequency of party
attendance for the within- and between-person effects of
HED. The positive between-person effect of party attendance
remained significant in Model B after controlling for T1
covariates (OR = 1.30). The results of Model C indicated
that the within-person effect of frequency of party atten-
dance was also significant (OR = 1.15). Thus, sexual assault
perpetration was more likely to occur in semesters in which
frequency of party attendance was higher than one’s own
average and among students who, on average, reported more
frequent party attendance than the sample as a whole. The
results for frequency of bar attendance (Table 5) were nearly
identical to those for party attendance.
Supplemental analyses
To better understand how drinking settings contribute to
sexual assault perpetration, we considered the role of hookup
frequency in the party and bar models, reasoning that these
casual sexual encounters may explain the link (e.g., Flack
et al., 2007). Thus, we added Model D, which included the
between- and within-person effects of frequency of hookups,
to Tables 4 and 5. When added to either the party or the bar
frequency model, the within-person effect of hookups was
significant (OR = 1.12 in both models), whereas the within-
person effect of party and bar attendance became nonsignifi-
cant. The between-person effect of hookups was significant
in the party model (OR = 1.27) but not significant in the bar
model. After controlling for hookups, the between-person
effect of bar frequency remained significant (OR = 1.61),
whereas the effect of party frequency was not.
Discussion
College men with higher frequency HED were more
likely to perpetrate sexual assault over the first five semes-

ters of college. However, this between-person effect was
completely explained by characteristics shared by heavier
drinkers and perpetrators—impersonal sex orientation, an-
tisocial behavior, and low self-control. The absence of an
independent between-person effect of HED is consistent
with the results of previous studies that have found weak or
nonsignificant effects of men’s alcohol use on perpetration
relative to strong effects of personality variables (Parkhill
& Abbey, 2008; Thompson et al., 2013; 2015). In contrast,
when we substituted frequency of party or bar attendance
for HED, we found independent, between-person effects,
indicating that men who frequent these settings more than
average are at a higher risk for perpetrating sexual assault
over time.
We also failed to support the hypothesis that sexual as-
sault would be more likely to occur in semesters in which
HED was more frequent than one’s own average. However,
we found within-person effects for party and bar frequency
on sexual assault, with a higher risk in semesters in which
attendance exceeded one’s own average frequency. College
students, aware of the strong link between drinking, drinking
settings, and sexual assault, attend parties and bars to drink
and find sex partners (Lindgren et al., 2009; Norris et al.,
1996). Predatory men may seek out these settings to target
vulnerable, intoxicated women for sexual advances (Graham
et al., 2014; Mumford et al., 2011). Accordingly, when we
entered time-varying hookup behavior, the within-person
effects of party and bar attendance became nonsignificant,
as hookups emerged as a significant predictor of sexual as-
sault. Consistent with research linking hookups with sexual
aggression (Flack et al., 2007; Testa et al., 2015b), casual
sexual behavior may be an even more proximal driver of
sexual assault than drinking settings.
Limitations
Because these are not event-level data, we do not know
whether within-person effects reflect perpetration occurring

samin et al., 2012; Graham et al., 2014). The choice to fre-
quent these settings reflects not only the desire to drink but
also personality characteristics, expectancies about alcohol
within these settings, and desire to have sex or possibly to
use sexually aggressive tactics to obtain sex (Mumford et al.,
2011). Although eliminating college parties and bars seems
unrealistic, it may be possible to make these social settings
safer (e.g., Glindemann et al., 2007)—for example, through
server or bystander intervention training (e.g., Salazar et al.,
2014).

within drinking settings (or hookups) or on separate occa-
sions within the same semester. There are always limitations
associated with self-report data; these may be relatively more
significant for assessment of sexual assault perpetration, a
socially proscribed behavior. Although the SES is a standard,
widely used measure, there has been little psychometric
evaluation of its validity (Kolivas & Gross, 2007). Because
personality variables were not assessed at all waves, we were
unable to model their time-varying effects on sexual assault
(see Thompson et al., 2015). Finally, although we had good
retention in this large sample, it is possible that missing data
influenced the results in unknown ways.
Implications for preventing college sexual assault
Consistent with Thompson et al. (2015), sexual assault
perpetration did not decline over the course of college.
Y
et, the risk of sexual assault victimization among women
declines from a peak in the first year (Humphrey & White,
2000; Parks et al., 2014). Because this pattern suggests
that upperclassmen may be targeting vulnerable freshman
women, sexual assault prevention efforts need to include
these older men.
Although we did not find an independent between- or
within-person effect of HED on sexual assault, heavier
drinkers were more likely to perpetrate over the next several
semesters than lighter drinkers. Because heavy drinkers are
potentially identifiable (e.g., mandated for intervention), it
may be feasible to provide them with sexual assault preven-
tion programming (see Orchowski et al., 2016), although our
results do not imply that reducing men’s HED in itself will
prevent sexual assault perpetration. The between- and within-
person effects of party and bar attendance are consistent
with a growing body of research pointing toward drinking
settings as “hot spots” for sexual victimization (e.g., Ber-
