Introduction
Chronic low back pain is a complex disorder, with multiple
physical, psychological and social factors contributing to poorer
recovery and prolonged disability.1–3[15_TD$DIF] Clinical practice guidelines
recommend evaluation of biopsychosocial factors when deciding
on
a patient’s
management1–3 because they are important
determinants of outcome2,4,5 and because a biopsychosocial
approach is superior to a biomedically focused approach in
chronic low back pain.6 Despite this endorsement by guidelines,1–3
physiotherapists tend to adhere poorly to this guidance.7–10
Physiotherapists have traditionally been at the forefront of the
management of chronic low back pain. Training physiotherapists in
the management of chronic low back pain focuses on a biomedical
approach, where pain is attributed to a structural or biomechanical
deficit and treatment aims to address these factors. However,
training physiotherapists in a biopsychosocial approach to chronic
low back pain remains limited.11,12 Physiotherapists, for the most
part, tend to approach the management of chronic low back pain
on the premise of a biomedical model of disease, with treatment
focus on a physical pathology and on addressing the symptoms and
physical impairments.11,12
The attitudes and beliefs about health and illness held by
healthcare professionals are likely to play a key role in the
approach they take in treating their patients. According to the
theory of planned behaviour, behaviour is determined by the
attitudes
and
beliefs
that
a
person
has
about
the
likely
consequences of the behaviour.13 Beliefs have been described as

Question: What influence do physiotherapists’ beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain have on
their clinical management of people with chronic low back pain? Design: Systematic review with data
from quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative and qualitative studies were included if they
investigated an association between physiotherapists’ attitudes and beliefs about chronic low back pain
and their clinical management of people with chronic low back pain. Results: Five quantitative and five
qualitative studies were included. Quantitative studies used measures of treatment orientation and fear
avoidance to indicate physiotherapists’ beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain. Quantitative
studies showed that a higher biomedical orientation score (indicating a belief that pain and disability
result from a specific structural impairment, and treatment is selected to address that impairment) was
associated with: advice to delay return to work, advice to delay return to activity, and a belief that return
to work or activity is a threat to the patient. Physiotherapists’ fear avoidance scores were positively
correlated with: increased certification of sick leave, advice to avoid return to work, and advice to avoid
return to normal activity. Qualitative studies revealed two main themes attributed to beliefs and
attitudes of physiotherapists who have a relationship to their management of chronic low back pain:
treatment orientation and patient factors. Conclusion: Both quantitative and qualitative studies showed
a relationship between treatment orientation and clinical practice. The inclusion of qualitative studies
captured the influence of patient factors in clinical practice in chronic low back pain. There is a need to
recognise that both beliefs and attitudes regarding treatment orientation of physiotherapists, and
therapist-patient factors need to be considered when introducing new clinical practice models, so that
the adoption of new clinical practice is maximised. [Gardner T, Refshauge K, Smith L, McAuley J,

 ‘a cognitive process resulting in a concrete cognition of how we
think things are’.14 Attitudes are ‘a more complex cognitive state
involving beliefs and feelings as well as values and predispositions
to act in a certain way’.14 Defining attitudes and beliefs is difficult,
due to the complexity and fluidity of the cognitive processes that
underpin them and the influence of environmental and social
interaction. This is relevant in chronic low back pain where the
individual presentation of a patient and clinical setting can
influence the personal attitudes and beliefs of the healthcare
professional.15–17 The patient’s expectations, perceived passivity of
the patient, and a desire to maintain a therapeutic relationship
have been shown to be factors in the choice of practice.15[16_TD$DIF] Clinical
practice is also influenced by the perceived lack of time a clinician
has to fully explore the complexities of chronic low back pain.15
Clinical practice in chronic low back pain is influenced by the
patient’s pain perception, the patient’s psychosocial status, and the
degree of consistency between objective measures and behaviour
of the patient.16
The uncertainty of a definition of attitudes and beliefs is
reflected in the difficulty of their measurement. In research,
measures of treatment orientation, fear avoidance, and intolerance
of uncertainty are utilised to indirectly imply the attitudes and
beliefs of healthcare professionals. The most commonly used
measure of attitudes and beliefs in physiotherapy research is the
Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT).18
The PABS-PT is a validated measure that provides a score of
treatment orientation of the healthcare professional.19 Treatment
orientation has been shown to have high correlation with clinical
practice, but it is important to ask whether it truly captures the
complexity of attitudes and beliefs regarding chronic low back
pain.
Healthcare professionals’ attitudes and beliefs have been
shown to influence adherence to guidelines for low back pain,
such that a healthcare professional with a biomedical treatment
orientation and high fear avoidance beliefs is more likely to show
poor adherence.20 Other factors associated with poor adherence
to chronic low back pain guidelines include: lack of knowledge;
lack of concordance between the biomedical approach and
guidelines; and a belief of the healthcare professional that they
are poorly trained and under-prepared to adopt a biopsychosocial
approach.8,21 The attitudes and beliefs of a healthcare profes-
sional affect patients’ attitudes and beliefs, and health out-
comes.20
Existing studies have largely focused on the attitudes and
beliefs of general practitioners or a combination of healthcare
professionals.20,22 There is less clarity about the influence of
physiotherapists’ attitudes and beliefs regarding chronic low back
pain on their approaches to treatment of chronic low back pain.
Considering that each profession has differing training, practice
and treatment goals, it is difficult to assume that general results
can be applied to all groups.
Physiotherapists remain at the forefront of chronic low back
pain treatment and so it is imperative to have a clear understand-
ing of their attitudes and beliefs. An understanding of these
attitudes and beliefs, and possible barriers, will enable more
effective implementation of existing guidelines and new treatment
models, as well as effective education of physiotherapists about
chronic low back pain.8
This systematic review aimed to synthesise the existing
literature to determine the effect of physiotherapists’ beliefs and
attitudes about chronic low back pain on clinical practice decisions
in the management of people with chronic low back pain. A
synthesis of both quantitative and qualitative studies was chosen
to provide both a measure of association and a richer understand-
ing of the association with the inclusion of qualitative studies.
Therefore, the research question for this systematic review was:
What influence do physiotherapists’ beliefs and attitudes about
chronic low back pain have on their clinical management of
people with chronic low back pain?
Method
Identification and selection of trials
Data sources and search strategy
This
systematic
review
was
conducted
and
reported
in
accordance with the PRISMA statement.23 Electronic searches of
Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PubMed and Cochrane
Library were conducted from January 1995 to February 2016. Hand
searches for relevant articles were also conducted on bibliogra-
phies of identified articles and systematic reviews. The search
strategy was developed in consultationwith a medical librarian, and
used a combination of keywords and MeSH terms (detailed search
strategies are presented in Appendix 1 on the eAddenda). The
search strategies had three main components: terms for attitudes
and/or beliefs; terms for healthcare professional, physical therapist
and/or physiotherapist; and terms for chronic low back pain.
Study selection and eligibility criteria
Quantitative and qualitative studies were included if they
investigated an association between physiotherapists’ attitudes/
beliefs about chronic low back pain and their clinical management
of people with chronic low back pain. The inclusion criteria are
presented in Box 1. No limit was placed on the measurements used
for physiotherapists’ attitudes and beliefs or clinical practice.
Studies were excluded if: they were published in a non-English
language; they were published before January 1995, in order to
capture the timeframe in which current clinical practice guidelines
were developed; the study primarily focused on acute or subacute
low back pain; or they primarily investigated the association
between physiotherapists’ attitudes and beliefs and patients’
attitudes and beliefs, outcome expectations, patient satisfaction
and treatment outcomes.
Two reviewers independently reviewed the titles and abstracts
of the studies retrieved by the search against the eligibility criteria.
Full papers were retrieved for evaluation if the paper fulfilled the
inclusion criteria, if eligibility was unclear based on the abstract
content, or if no abstract was available.
Data extraction and analysis
Quality
Studies meeting the eligibility criteria were assessed for
methodological quality. The quality of the quantitative studies
was assessed using a checklist compiled from quality scores for
observational studies.24[17_TD$DIF] The individual criteria that comprised the
checklist are presented in Table 1. The quality of qualitative studies
were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
checklist, as used in a systematic review by Fullen et al25 and is
recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration qualitative methods
group.26[18_TD$DIF] The individual criteria that comprise this checklist are
presented in Table 2. No formal system for interpreting either
checklist was available; therefore, for the purpose of this review, a
rating system was devised based on one previously used in another
review.25 If > 60% of the criteria on the checklist were met, the

 study was rated as ‘strong’ quality; if 40 to 60% were met, it was
rated as ‘moderate’ quality; and if < 40% were met, it was scored as
‘poor’ quality. For each included study, two authors (TG, LS)
independently carried out assessment of methodological quality.
Disagreements were resolved by discussion or resolved by a third
author.
Study characteristics
The characteristics extracted from the quantitative studies
were: study design, study population, sample size, study aim,
whether the sample was random, survey response rate, the
measures used for attitudes and beliefs (eg, PABS-PT, Attitudes to
Back Pain Scale for musculoskeletal practitioners (ABS-mp)), and
the measures used for clinical practice (eg, patient vignettes,
questionnaire). The characteristics extracted from the qualitative
studies were: method of data collection, method of data analysis,
study population, sample size and study aim.
Outcome data
Data were extracted from the published reports. Where studies
reported data for a mixed group of healthcare professionals,
attempts were made to obtain data specific to physiotherapy
participants, with requests made to the original authors.
For the quantitative studies, the outcome data extracted were
correlation and/or regression coefficients for association between
attitudes/beliefs of physiotherapists and clinical practice mea-
sures.
For the qualitative studies, the first author (TG) conducted the
data synthesis, as described by Sandelowski and Barroso.27[19_TD$DIF] The
analytic process initially consisted of extraction of findings relating
to belief and attitudes of physiotherapists, and effect on clinical
practice and coding of findings for each article. The second stage
was grouping of findings according to their topical similarity (eg,
therapist factors, patient factors). The third stage was abstraction
of findings – analysing the grouped findings to form a set of concise
themes that captured the content of all findings. Frequency of
statements regarding identification and support of a subtheme
within each article was also extracted.
Results
Flow of studies through the review
Following the search and screening, 262 articles were retrieved

Measures of beliefs and attitudes
There was no consistent method of measuring beliefs and
attitudes across the five quantitative studies; all studies used a
different combination of measures. Four of the five quantitative
studies10,29,30,31[20_TD$DIF] used measures of treatment orientation to indicate
beliefs and attitudes of physiotherapists. To measure treatment
orientation, three studies10,29,31 included the PABS-PT18 and
two10,30 included the ABS-mp.34 One study28 used a measure of
fear avoidance to infer beliefs and attitudes of physiotherapists.
This study28 derived a fear avoidance questionnaire from several
existing and validated questionnaires: the Tampa Scale for
Kinesiophobia, the Fear Avoidance Behaviour Questionnaire, and
the Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale. One study31 used

 several measures to measure beliefs and attitudes, including fear
avoidance, treatment orientation and intolerance of uncertainty.
Measures of clinical practice
Clinical practice was measured using patient vignettes in three
of the five10,29,31 included quantitative studies. All three of these
studies used vignettes presenting a moderate-risk and low-risk
case for the physiotherapist to assess and indicate level of spinal
pathology, risk of developing low back pain disability, return to
work advice and return to activity advice. One study28 developed a
clinical practice questionnaire to indicate three items regarding:
sick leave, advice regarding return to activity and confidence in
predicting long-term disability. Another study30 developed a work
behaviour questionnaire
that
asked
about
workplace
visits,
support of sick leave, recommendations of short breaks, and
prescription of exercise suitable in the workplace.
Association between attitudes and belief measures and clinical
practice
Correlation coefficients for association between attitudes and
beliefs of physiotherapists and clinical practice measures were
extracted from all five quantitative studies (Table 4). Meta-analysis
was not conducted due to the heterogeneity of measures used in
the studies.
Treatment orientation: A higher biomedical orientation score
was associated with advice to delay return to work (correlation
coefficients ranging from r = 0.19 to 0.24 for low-risk patient
vignettes, and r = 0.08 to 0.27 for moderate-risk vignettes) and
advice to delay return to activity (correlation coefficients ranging
from r = 0.00 to 0.25 for low-risk vignettes, [2_TD$DIF]and r = 0.21 to 0.28 for
moderate-risk vignettes). One study30[21_TD$DIF] reported that a biomedical
orientation was associated with a tendency to not limit number of
treatment sessions (rs = 0.23).
Fear avoidance: Physiotherapists’ fear avoidance scores were
examined in one study28 and were positively correlated with
increased certification of sick leave (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.19) and
advice to avoid return to work and return to normal activity (RR
1.71, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.57). Physiotherapists with a higher fear
avoidance score also had less confidence in determining the long-
term disability due to low back pain (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.35).
Three of the five quantitative studies conducted regression
analyses to further determine whether treatment orientation
predicted clinical practice. Figure 2 summarises the relationships
found between treatment orientation and return to activity advice.
Derghazian et al10[23_TD$DIF] performed a stepwise linear regression to
determine whether the PABS-PT was predictive of recommenda-
tion of activity. The PABS-PT-Behavioral score accounted for 12% of
the variance (R2 = 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.18). The ABS-mp Biomedical
and ABS-mp Confidence and Concern subscores explained a
further 6% variance for the moderate-risk patient. The ABS-mp
Biomedical score accounted for 12% variance for the low-risk
patient.
Houben et al29 performed regression analyses to determine if
the PABS-PT scores were predictive of recommendation for work
and activity. This analysis showed that both treatment orientation
factors of the PABS-PT score were significant predictors of work
(PABS-PT-Biomedical R2 = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.44 and PABS-PT-
Behavioural R2 = 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.36) and activity recom-
mendations (PABS-PT-Biomedical R2 = 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.42 and
PABS-PT-Behavioural R2 = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40).
Simmonds
et
al31[24_TD$DIF]
performed
stepwise
linear
regression
analyses to determine if PABS-PT scores were predictive of
treatment and activity recommendations. They found PABS-PT-
Behavioural scores to be a significant predictor of treatment
(R2 = 0.158, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.25) and activity recommendation
(R2 = 0.117, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.18) for moderate-risk patient vignettes.
In addition, PABS-PT-Behavioural score together with postgraduate
training in chronic pain was a significant predictor of treatment
(R2 = 0.108, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18) and activity recommendation
(R2 = 0.109, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.18) for low-risk patient vignettes.
Qualitative studies
Table 5 summarises the descriptive characteristics of included
qualitative studies and the main findings from each study.
Qualitative studies (n = 5) revealed two main themes attributed
to beliefs and attitudes of physiotherapists that have a relationship
to the clinical practice of physiotherapists in chronic low back pain:
treatment orientation and patient factors.
Table 6 presents the two main themes and their subthemes,
with examples of supporting statements, the number of times each
subtheme was identified by a study, and the total number of times
it was supported by a statement in any of the included studies.
Table 6 demonstrates that when discussing chronic low back pain,
physiotherapists have a consistent bias towards a biomedical
approach, which is contrasted by the preoccupation of the ‘passive’
patient.
Theme 1: Treatment orientation
Five subthemes were derived relating to the theme of treatment
orientation. Chronic low back pain was approached with a strong
biomedical model, and clinical practice was aimed at addressing
biomedical factors. Physiotherapists classified patients according
to a biomedical approach, and clinical practice decisions were
made according to the classification. Therapists expressed a lack of
confidence in their ability to follow and implement a biopsycho-
social model in clinical practice. Therapists disliked treating
difficult
patients
and
had
poor
self-efficacy
and
outcome
expectancies regarding their treatment of these patients. Thera-
pists thought that assessment of psychosocial factors was not their
role.

 Theme 2: Patient factors
Three subthemes were derived relating to the theme of patient
factors. Intervention that was provided was influenced by patient
beliefs and treatment expectations. Patient characteristics and
consideration of the therapist-patient relationship influenced the
therapist’s choice of intervention. Physiotherapists often chose
interventions that facilitated a relationship with and satisfied the
patient. Clinical decisions were based on the classification of the
patient according to the perceived ‘passivity of patient’. The degree
to which a therapist thought a patient would engage in treatment
and/or self-management influenced the treatment provided and
led to an individual approach for each patient.
Discussion
This systematic review synthesised, for the first time, both
quantitative and qualitative studies investigating the influence of
beliefs and attitudes on clinical practice by physiotherapists in
chronic low back pain. High-quality quantitative and qualitative
studies are considered to contribute equally to evidence.35
Qualitative studies can provide a validation of quantitative
measures and give an extra dimension of understanding of
complex conditions and interventions.36 Understanding why an
intervention failed is just as important as understanding why it
was a success, and qualitative investigation into such complex and
layered factors such as beliefs, attitudes and behaviour change is
important.36,37 A degree of concordance was shown between
qualitative and quantitative studies, both revealing that treatment
orientation was associated with clinical practice in chronic low
back pain. This finding is consistent with a previous review that
investigated the association of attitudes and beliefs of various
other healthcare professional groups with clinical management of
chronic low back pain in a range of settings.20 The inclusion of
qualitative studies further revealed patient-related factors that
influence physiotherapists’ beliefs and attitudes, and subsequent
clinical practice in chronic low back pain. These factors included
patients’ beliefs and treatment expectations, the patient-therapist
relationship and the perceived ‘passivity’ of the patient.
The strength of this review was that both quantitative and
qualitative studies were included. This approach provides a much
richer perspective, and has previously been used in similar
systematic
reviews.20,26 The

To examine PTs’ pain beliefs their role
within the management of patients with
cLBP
� Experience and development of work craft skills was important in the
treatment of cLBP and PTs sort biomedically focused knowledge and
skills to enhance their own treatment repertoire
� Patients are classified into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ patients, with poor outcome
often attributed to the passive nature of the patient; a belief that ‘bad’
patients will have a poor outcome often leads to clinical practice and
communication being modified
� PTs had biomedical view and this informed clinical practice reasoning
and explanations given to the patient as well as attributions regarding
the patient

To understand how the personal
experiences and feelings of PTs might
influence their decision making when
treating patients with cLBP
� PT believe cLBP has an underlying mechanical and recurring nature
� PTs attitude toward managing cLBP is to empower patients to exercise
and self-manage their pain and functional problems
� PT experience feelings of tension between the advice and treatment they
feel is best for the patient and the patient’s own beliefs and attitudes

To explore and describe what PTs need to
know about patients with cLBP to be able
to make decisions about intervention
� PT clinical practice was determined by the complexity of the patient.
Several factors (pain history, body structure, body function, activity,
participation, mental function, health-related behaviour, workplace
environment, personal factors) interplayed to determine the complexity
of the patients and subsequent intervention.
� Easy case: clinical practice decisions based on structure, pain location and
joint/muscle function
� Complex case: decisions on clinical practice mainly based on
combinations of aspects related to movement and mental function
� Very complex case: described as having a high degree of psychosocial
problems and troublesome life situations and required several
intervention components, therefore collaboration with other
professionals

To investigate how PTs talk about choice
of intervention for patients with cLBP,
particularly regarding how professionals
manage clinical encounters that may be
experienced as challenging
PTs talk about choices of intervention as a problem solving process,
including questions on four main themes:
� health responsibility: patients responsibility and their ability for own
health and PT role in patient’s health
� normalization: back pain as an ordinary medical condition and normal
feature of ordinary life, normal for patient to want a ‘quick fix
� change process: need for patient to change their whole life or routine
� individualisation: PT adapt intervention to specific patient preferences
and one’s own professional skills
The process has implications on the intervention the individual patient
will be offered and has consequences on outcome.

clinical practice was aimed at addressing biomedical factors

The x-ray identifies L3-4 as being visibly osteo-arthritic, I feel that he does have
some degenerative change within his back . . . indication would be to treat, to try
and resolve the particular problems that present at the moment, which are the
stiffness that I felt below the active level, that’s painful, and then by loosening that
up, hopefully reduce the discomfort at the over active level- the 3-4 level, and then
get him on a home program to maintain flexibility of the lower lumbar vertebrae11[12_TD$DIF]
PTs classify patients according to a biomedical approach and
treat accordingly

I would probably explain to her that it was most likely postural strain . . . There
could be an underlying facet joint degenerative problem evident. I would then go
on to explaining how her work or habits, hobbies and posture may be exacerbating
the problem.14
Josephson et al32 describe three levels of complexity that merged in their
analysis: easy case, complex case and very complex case, with each level
influencing the decision about intervention.
Easy case: An uncomplicated back that feels well and allows someone to lead a
rewarding life while still experiencing back pain is easy to treat.32
Complex case: They have so much pain that they lie in bed and say ‘I can’t get out
of bed’; they are just lying in bed and are very scared of every little move they have
to make and then I think it’s something that has to be.32
Very complex case: When it’s time for pain rehabilitation its very complex; then it
is not only the back pain anymore, it’s very much influenced by long service leaves
with everything that means to their self esteem, when they get there its very
complex. 32
PTs lacked confidence in treating with a biopsychosocial
model in clinical practice

Asking physiotherapists whether they felt equipped to help patients with
associated psychological factors . . . the responses varied from ‘it depends on the
patients’ to ‘a professional should deal with those issues’.11
PTs disliked treating difficult patients and had poor self-
efficacy and outcome expectancies regarding their treatment
of these patients

Difficult patients contributed to ‘bad days’ at work . . . you . . . switch off a little
bit . . . I think you become less sympathetic . . . write them off quickly.11
You can treat until you’re blue in the face, but you’ll take two steps forwards and
the patient will go away, do whatever they want to and take two steps back . . .
and this is when you get frustrating, unresolved cases.11
I don’t know how successful I’m going to be . . . I might not get that far with her.11

Difficult patients presented with unrealistic expectations, you can’t get across to
them that you haven’t got a magic wand.11
Whether they’re motivated to actually do something for themselves or they just
want you to . . . sort of . . . click your fingers; wave your magic wand, and the
pain’ll be gone.14

If it’s someone I feel I don’t have good contact with, I feel that the things I do, the
things I say, just bounce back; then I complete the intervention fairly fast, while I
can go considerably further with someone I have the kind of collaboration with.32
PTs were likely to make clinical decisions based on their
classification of the patient according to the perceived
‘passivity of patient’.

I struggle with people who . . . I’ve explained to them several times what’s wrong
with them, what they need to do about it, and they’re still not ‘buying into it’.14
You can’t do it for them, and they’re the ones who you really struggled with, and
you had to really explain to them that if they didn’t start taking . . . the
responsibility for themselves, then there was little you could do, really.14
You choose an intervention based on patients ability and experiences.32

Gardner et al: Physiotherapists’ attitudes in chronic low back pain

 quantitative studies10,30,31 and four qualitative studies8,14,32,33 that
have not previously been included in a combined systematic
review design such as this one. Chronic low back pain is a complex
presentation and it is well known that the interaction of the
therapist and patient will have an influence on the outcome.38 If
only quantitative measures were used, this dimension of patient
factors and patient-therapist interaction would be missed.
The current review found that treatment orientation and fear
avoidance beliefs of the physiotherapist had an influence on
clinical practice and advice given to patients. A therapist with
higher biomedical orientation and fear avoidance beliefs towards
chronic low back pain was associated with advice to restrict return
to work duties and restrict return to activity, a higher perception of
risk associated with work or activity, and increased certification of
sick leave. Healthcare professionals’ beliefs about chronic low back
pain have been shown to have an influence on patient beliefs.11,39,40
High levels of fear avoidance beliefs in healthcare professionals
have been shown to be associated with high levels of fear
avoidance
beliefs
in
their
patients.41,42 Reinforcement
of
a
cautionary and passive approach from treating physiotherapists
may lead to long-term passivity, unhelpful beliefs about activity,
and disengagement from a patient-focused self-management
approach. The qualitative studies included in this review also
showed the strong biomedical bias of physiotherapists in chronic
low back pain. These studies suggested that physiotherapists have
a strong focus on a biomedical approach to chronic low back pain,
placing importance on the severity of tissue damage, classifying
patients accordingly and choosing intervention aligned with the
biomedical model rather than embracing the model that pain and
function loss may be influenced by psychological and social factors
in addition to biomechanical factors.
The findings of the qualitative studies provided an extra
dimension to what influences clinical practice, by exploring the
factors associated with the patient. Patients with low back pain
expect a clear diagnosis, pain relief and manual therapy as part of
their care, which may reflect the patient’s biomedical beliefs
regarding their back pain.43 It has also been shown that a good
therapist-patient relationship has a positive effect on patients’
outcomes.38 Guidelines in line with a biopsychosocial approach
recommend that physiotherapists need to consider the patient and
their expectations in order to facilitate a good therapist-patient
relationship. This may leave the physiotherapist in conflict
between what clinical guidelines recommend and what the
patient wants. To reduce the tension between the two approaches,
therapists may choose to give advice and treatment more closely
aligned to the patient’s biomedical understanding and expectation,
in order to avoid conflict and facilitate a more helpful therapist-
patient relationship.
An important step in improving skills and confidence in
addressing the complexity of chronic low back pain is training
physiotherapists in the identification and management strategies
of psychosocial issues. The current review revealed a preference for
physiotherapists to treat biomechanical issues, a perception that
they lacked skills to address psychosocial issues, and a tendency to
stigmatise those behaviours that may suggest a psychological or
social aspect to low back pain. Treatment only addressing
structural or biomechanical factors often does not show good
effect, and the therapist is then left with judging the patient as
difficult or passive. Therapists’ poor misinterpretation of patient
behaviour may reflect a lack of awareness that these behaviours
may be indicative of underlying cognitive, psychological and social
factors, and may contribute to these aspects not being addressed.
Furthermore,
the
perception
of
stigmatisation
of
persons
experiencing chronic back pain may hinder the patient-therapist
relationship, which further compromises a positive effect of the
intervention.21 Our findings correlate well with a recent review
investigating physiotherapists’ perceptions about identifying and
managing the cognitive, psychological and social factors in chronic
low back pain, which reported a lack of confidence in physiother-
apist skills in identifying and addressing psychosocial aspects of
chronic low back pain.21 Physiotherapists should consider whether
some characteristics, such as poor motivation, or dependence on
passive therapies, may indicate the presence of other factors such
as depression, anxiety or poor self-efficacy, which require greater
consideration.21
It is important to identify that the patient’s role is integral to
clinical care, and this review was able to capture this influence. To
date, investigations into attitudes and beliefs in chronic low back
pain have for the most part given attention to the patient or
clinician in isolation from each other. A patient-centred approach,
where the patient and therapist work collaboratively, and beliefs
and attitudes of both are addressed, may be more effective for
facilitating self-management, patient satisfaction and improve
outcomes.25,44,45
Studies of chronic low back pain guideline implementation
have shown low or modest effects at changing clinical prac-
tice.46,47,48,49 The majority of these interventions focus on therapist
knowledge and skills in isolation from the patient. Clinical practice
is affected by therapist attitudes and beliefs, which are influenced
by patient factors such as patient expectations, belief systems
and the therapeutic relationship developed in a clinical interac-
tion. When considering the design of interventions to improve
guideline adherence, a better approach may be addressing both
the therapist[4_TD$DIF]’s and patient’s contribution to the clinical interven-
tion (Box 2). The clinical intervention should be considered as
a dynamic relationship, where both therapist and patient are
involved in an interchange, rather than two separate silos in
isolation from one another, and perhaps training in chronic low
back pain intervention needs to reflect this.
There were some limitations in regard to the studies included in
this review. Direct measurement of clinical behaviour is difficult.
Clinical practice measures were limited to advice on work, exercise
and exercise prescription in the workplace. It is questionable
whether the measures used in the included studies captured all
that is practised in the clinical setting.9[25_TD$DIF] Measurement of clinical
behaviour was collected by self-report questionnaires or patient
vignettes. Responses provided on a questionnaire may reflect a
therapist’s knowledge of guidelines rather than their actual
behaviour. This tendency towards desirable answers is a well-
known bias in self-report measurement.31 Patient vignettes are
easy to manipulate, and there is a reduced impact of social
desirability and observer bias; however, they may elicit attitudes

 and opinions rather than actual behaviour in real situations.50,51 It
has also been demonstrated that physiotherapy management of
back pain can be composed of numerous interventions, which vary
during the episode of care,52 a dynamic which is difficult to capture
with case scenarios. Measurement of clinical behaviour would be
best attained by direct observation and audit of clinical behaviour
with blinded participants.
The beliefs and attitudes of physiotherapists as well as
therapist-patient factors have an influence on clinical practice in
chronic low back pain. This may impact the uptake of current
clinical guidelines and new treatment models of care. Future
research is needed to investigate the most effective approach when
developing training and implementation tools for clinical guide-
lines that considers both the therapist and patient factors as
mutual influences on clinical practice.
What is already known on this topic: Clinical practice
guidelines recommend evaluation of biopsychosocial factors
in people with chronic low back pain, but many physiothera-
pists do not assess and treat these factors.
What this study adds: Quantitative and qualitative studies
confirm a relationship between treatment orientation and
clinical practice. Both beliefs and attitudes regarding treatment
orientation of physiotherapists as well therapist-patient factors
need to be considered when introducing new clinical practice
models so that the adoption of new clinical practice is max-
imised.
