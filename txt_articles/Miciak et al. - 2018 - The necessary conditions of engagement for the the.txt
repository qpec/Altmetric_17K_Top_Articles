Abstract
Background: The therapeutic relationship between patient and physiotherapist is a central component of
patient-centred care and has been positively associated with better physiotherapy clinical outcomes. Despite
its influence, we do not know what conditions enable a physiotherapist and patient to establish and maintain
a therapeutic relationship. This knowledge has implications for how clinicians approach their interactions with
patients and for the development of an assessment tool that accurately reflects the nature of the therapeutic
relationship. Therefore, this study’s aim was to identify and provide in-depth descriptions of the necessary
conditions of engagement of the therapeutic relationship between physiotherapists and patients.
Methods: Interpretive description was the qualitative methodological orientation used to identify and describe the
conditions that reflect and are practically relevant to clinical practice. Eleven physiotherapists with a minimum 5 years
of clinical experience and seven adult patients with musculoskeletal disorders were purposively sampled from private
practice clinics in Edmonton, Canada. The in-person, semi-structured interviews were completed in a location of the
participant’s choice and were audio recorded and transcribed. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the
textual data and constant comparison techniques were integrated to refine the categories and sub-categories. Rigour
strategies used throughout the study were peer debrief, interview notes, reflexive journaling, memoing, member
reflections, audit trail, and external audit.
Results: Four conditions were identified as necessary for establishing a therapeutic relationship: present, receptive,
genuine, and committed. These conditions represent the intentions and attitudes of physiotherapists and patients
engaging in the clinical interaction. Although distinct, the conditions appear related as being present and receptive
create a foundation for being genuine and committed.
Conclusions: These conditions of engagement are needed for physiotherapist and patient to “be” in a therapeutic
relationship. Although communication skills are important for advancing therapists’ relational abilities, awareness and
integration of intentions and attitudes are essential for shaping behaviors that develop the therapeutic relationship.
These findings also suggest there are characteristics of the therapeutic relationship specific to physiotherapy. Therefore,
theories from other contexts (e.g., psychotherapy) should be used judiciously to guide physiotherapy practice and
research.

 Background
The therapeutic relationship between patient and pro-
vider is considered a central component of patient-
centred care [1, 2] and patient engagement [3, 4]. In
physiotherapy, the therapeutic relationship is integrated
into various practice standards [5], indicating its import-
ance in shaping competent care. Research demonstrating
a positive association between better therapeutic rela-
tionships and patient satisfaction [6], adherence with
treatment [7], and clinical outcomes [8–10] supports
physiotherapists’ beliefs that the therapeutic relationship
influences clinical outcomes [11].
Study of the therapeutic relationship in physiotherapy
is in its infancy, especially when compared to theoretical
development and empirical investigation in the psycho-
therapy context. Despite its potential to impact clinical
outcomes, we know very little about what constitutes a
therapeutic relationship in physiotherapy. Due to this
gap in physiotherapy literature, combined with the ad-
vanced knowledge development in psychotherapy relative
to other healthcare disciplines (e.g., medicine) and the po-
tential benefits of adopting a psychologically-informed
perspective in rehabilitation [12], physiotherapy research
and practice have been influenced by psychotherapy the-
ory [9, 10, 13]. For instance, physiotherapy researchers
have used Bordin’s theory of the working alliance [14],
while educators reference Freudian [15, 16] and Rogerian
principles [15]. Of these theories, Rogers’ [17] “necessary
and sufficient conditions” of genuineness (freedom to be
one’s self), empathic understanding (understanding of the
patient’s feelings and meanings combined with congruent
interactional behaviours) and unconditional positive re-
gard (accepting attitude) have contributed, implicitly or
explicitly, to the understanding of the therapeutic relation-
ship in psychotherapy [18]. These guiding principles are
broad and arguably extend to human relationships in
general [17, 19] and in a way that can be understood
by practitioners and patients alike. Meta-analyses have
demonstrated that empathy [20] and positive regard
[21] are moderately associated with clinical outcomes
in psychotherapy.
While Rogers’ conditions are broad and could apply to
physiotherapy as well as other healthcare disciplines
[17], there might also be aspects specific to physiother-
apy [22]. For instance, physiotherapists often use touch
during assessment and treatment, which is likely not the
case
in
psychotherapy-oriented
disciplines,
such
as
psychology. It is also relevant to note that delivery of
physiotherapy services differs practically from other
healthcare professions. For instance, physiotherapy treat-
ment sessions can be longer in duration and occur on a
more frequent basis during a particular treatment period
(e.g., number of sessions per week) compared to phys-
ician visits. In addition, physiotherapists may be more
likely to form consistent relationships with their pa-
tients (i.e., same therapist sees the patient) over the
course of a treatment period than, for example,
nurses working in a hospital where shift changes re-
quire a patient work with more than one nurse.
These factors could shape how physiotherapists ap-
proach interactions with patients and create an en-
vironment that provides the opportunity to develop
the therapeutic relationship as a central component
of the clinical interaction, as well as direct how the
therapeutic relationship should be assessed.
The concept of engagement is an influential factor in
outcomes and has been linked to the therapeutic rela-
tionship. In their content analysis of patient engagement,
Higgins et al. [3] determined that the therapeutic alli-
ance (a term used broadly as synonymous with the
therapeutic relationship) was an attribute of patient en-
gagement because, as a supportive partnership, it en-
courages patients to engage in rehabilitation. But who is
responsible for engaging the therapeutic relationship,
physiotherapist or patient? For instance, Higgins et al.
[3] define engagement as “.. . the desire and capability to
actively choose to participate in care in a way uniquely
appropriate to the individual in cooperation with a
healthcare provider or institution for the purposes of
maximizing outcomes or experiences of care” (p. 33).
This implies a substantial degree of patient investment
along side the provider.
Given the importance placed on patient engagement
in rehabilitation, understanding the therapeutic relation-
ship in physiotherapy from patient and physiotherapist
perspectives is needed. Although this view is supported
in research of physiotherapy services [23], historically,
patient involvement in research of the therapeutic rela-
tionship has focused more on therapist perspectives.
Moreover, patients’ experiences of the therapeutic rela-
tionship may have greater weight than therapists’ consid-
ering their ratings of therapeutic relationship quality can
be more predictive of successful psychotherapy interven-
tions [24]. Therefore, patient contributions are essential
for developing foundational knowledge of the thera-
peutic relationship in physiotherapy.
Assuming meaningful engagement relies on a positive
supportive relationship between patient and provider,
we posed the question: what conditions are necessary
for both physiotherapist and patient to engage in a
therapeutic relationship? Given the nature of the ques-
tion and the limited understanding of the therapeutic
relationship in physiotherapy, we undertook a qualita-
tive investigation, using physiotherapist and patient
perspectives, to identify and provide in-depth descrip-
tions of the conditions of engagement necessary for a
therapeutic relationship between physiotherapist and
patient.

 Methods
Research team and reflexivity
The research team consisted of 4 clinicians (2 physio-
therapists, 1 occupational therapist, and 1 psychologist),
and a qualitative methodologist from human ecology.
Two of the 5 researchers had significant experience
using qualitative methods in health research and a third,
the lead author, was completing this project as a compo-
nent of her doctoral thesis and led all aspects of the
study. In doing so, the lead author was informed by pre-
vious and extensive training in qualitative methods as
well as meta-theoretical perspectives from critical real-
ism [25, 26] and psychotherapeutic contextual theory
[27]. The lead author also applied experience gained as a
contributor on other qualitative research studies. It is
also relevant to note that the lead author had post-
graduate training in psychotherapy, which informed
prior clinical practice as a physiotherapist as well as her
interest in therapeutic relationship as a research topic.
The therapeutic relationship was a central component of
the clinical psychologist’s research program.
Design
Interpretive description was the qualitative methodo-
logical orientation [28, 29] used to address the research
question [28]. Grounded in naturalistic inquiry [30], in-
terpretive description is a framework that guides re-
searchers to maintain a path toward pragmatic versus
theoretical findings when addressing clinical or applied
problems. Interpretive description does not prescribe the
use of a specific theoretical framework, as do traditional
methods (e.g., grounded theory, phenomenology). When
designing a study, Thorne suggests researchers consider
various factors that could influence practice, including
the disciplinary mandate (e.g., physiotherapy’s social
mandate to help others), current practice theories or
models (e.g., patient-centred care), and the research
question. This practice-oriented scope is meant to en-
sure that “... at least one foot be firmly placed on the
solid ground that is the ‘real world’...”(p 201) of clinical
practice. For this reason, an inductive approach was
taken, eliminating the use of a theoretical framework or
themes at the outset of the study, including psychother-
apy theories or approaches.
Setting
The setting was private practice physiotherapy clinics in
Edmonton, Canada. Reasons for situating the study in
these clinics included: the notable percentage of physio-
therapists working in these settings (48.2% in 2016) [31];
their community location, which provided direct and
possibly greater access to physiotherapy services; and the
potential that a for-profit business model could influence
how much emphasis physiotherapists placed on the
therapeutic relationship to build a caseload.
Participants
Physiotherapists were eligible if they had a minimum of
5 years of clinical experience and were currently working
in private practice. Adult (18–64 years of age) patients
with musculoskeletal complaints were eligible if they re-
ceived at minimum 3 treatment sessions and were
within 12 weeks of their last session. Patients were ineli-
gible if they had co-morbid conditions limiting their
cognitive capacity or ability to communicate, neuro-
logical or systemic inflammatory conditions, or if they
had received wage replacement or pain and/or suffering
compensation.
Sampling strategy and recruitment
Physiotherapist sampling strategy and recruitment
Purposive sampling was used to recruit 11 physiothera-
pists (6 female). Two authors (including the lead author)
who are physiotherapists used their knowledge of the
private practice community to identify physiotherapists
who could provide in-depth accounts of their thera-
peutic relationship experiences. Administrative staff in
the Department of Physical Therapy, University of Al-
berta sent an email invitation to therapists, directing
them to contact the first author with questions or if in-
terested in participating. Upon contact, the lead author
reviewed the study information sheet with all potential
participants. Three therapists did not respond to the
email and 1 declined to participate after speaking with
the lead author. Purposive sampling enabled sampling
across factors such as treatment specializations (e.g.,
manual therapists) and areas of interest (e.g., chronic
pain). Therapists’ ages ranged between 36 and 60 years
(mean age 47.8 years); demographic data were missing
for 2 therapists. All physiotherapists had been practicing
in private practice for at least 10 years. The majority
(10/11) used at least one advanced restricted activity
(i.e., activity requiring authorization from the regulatory
body), such as acupuncture or spinal manipulation [32].
Post-graduate training was reported in women’s health,
vestibular rehabilitation, temporomandibular joint re-
habilitation, and sports physiotherapy.
Patient sampling strategy and recruitment
Purposive and convenience sampling were used to re-
cruit 7 patient participants (4 male). Ages ranged be-
tween 18 and 62 years (mean age of 42.3 years).
Administrative staff in 3 clinics purposively identified
patients they believed would be able to provide candid
accounts of the relationships with their therapists. Staff
provided patients with study information sheets and di-
rected them to contact the lead author with questions or
Miciak et al. Archives of Physiotherapy  (2018) 8:3 
Page 3 of 12
 if interested in participating. Study information was also
distributed to a large athletic club via a coach’s email,
with instructions to contact the lead author. Upon con-
tact, the study information sheet was reviewed with all
potential participants. One patient was deemed ineligible
for the study after speaking with the lead author. Most
patients (6/7) had previously accessed physiotherapy
services and most (5/7) had experienced their physical
issues for greater than 3 months prior to seeking
treatment.
Data generation and analysis
Data generation and analysis were inductive and itera-
tive. After receiving informed consent, semi-structured
one-on-one interviews were completed in a public loca-
tion of the participant’s choice, audio-recorded, and pro-
fessionally transcribed. One interview lasting between 40
and 90 min was completed with each participant, al-
though participants were informed they may be con-
tacted to clarify their statements. An interview guide
[33] of open-ended questions was used to facilitate de-
scriptions of participants’ experiences of the therapeutic
relationship. Although physiotherapists and patients had
separate interview guides, they were similar in that both
began with broad questions to provoke responses on the
clinical interaction in general (e.g., What do you call
yourself – a patient or a client?) then became specific to
aspects of the interaction that physiotherapists and pa-
tients believed could influence or were a part of the
therapeutic relationship. However, questions in the inter-
view guides differed since physiotherapists form thera-
peutic relationships with many patients whereas patients
will not have this breadth of experience. For example,
physiotherapists were asked about their views on ‘fixing
patients’ in order to encourage responses regarding their
treatment philosophies in general whereas patients could
be asked to compare their therapeutic relationship with
their physiotherapist to the one with their physician. We
have described the rationale for both patient and physio-
therapist interview guides elsewhere [34]. Probing ques-
tions (e.g., How did that make you feel? or What
happened then?) or contact statements to check for clar-
ity (e.g., It sounds like your physiotherapist was con-
cerned about your well-being?) were used to build on
participant responses in-the-moment to encourage thor-
ough description and to disrupt the researcher’s pre-
conceived notions. Various rigour strategies, described
below, were used to critique the data generation process
in order to continually inform interview quality. For ex-
ample, interview notes were a component of the lead au-
thor’s intersubjective reflection on the “... situated,
emergent, and negotiated nature of the research encoun-
ter” ( [35] p8). Interview notes were completed after
each interview to capture the researcher’s impressions
and critique of, for example, the interview setting as well
as the interaction between researcher and participant,
including how the researcher’s perspectives on the thera-
peutic relationship might have influenced the interview.
Two mock interviews were completed, which informed
refinement of the interview guides prior to initiating par-
ticipant interviews. Concurrent data generation and ana-
lysis allowed for interview guide revisions to reflect the
evolving analysis. The lead author completed all inter-
views and data analysis. Data were generated until a
point of saturation [36] was achieved representing a
meaningful reflection of clinical reality.
Data analysis occurred in 2 concurrent phases: (1) a
systematic process of data (audio and transcript) review,
reflexive journaling, and memoing prior to coding; and
(2) formal coding guided by qualitative content analysis
[37] and constant comparison principles [38]. To sup-
port an inductive process that would generate findings
congruent with the physiotherapy context, psychother-
apy theory (e.g., Rogerian theory) was not used to guide
the analysis. Content analysis began with initial coding
[38] or the assignment of a specific word or phrase to
summarize a key attribute of a portion of text [39]. As
patterns of codes were recognized [40, 41], they were
grouped into categories and sub-categories [42]. At this
point, constant comparison strategies were integrated to
refine the analysis and assist in the process of thinking
about the categories’ properties (i.e., characteristics of
the category) and conditions (i.e., circumstances that
foster the category) [36]. Negative cases [43] within par-
ticipant accounts contributed to clarifying aspects of the
conditions of engagement.
The lead author completed all interviews and analysis
in partial fulfillment of her doctoral thesis. It is worth
noting that the lead author had not met the patient par-
ticipants prior to the study. However, given the lead au-
thor
had
previously
worked
in
private
practice
physiotherapy, she knew some of the physiotherapist
participants on a professional basis, to varying degrees,
prior to the study commencing. Various rigour strategies
that involved researcher, participants, and external re-
views were used throughout the study to address trans-
parency and trustworthiness of the research process and
findings. Personal researcher strategies involved journal-
ing to: maintain an audit trail [44, 45]; reflexively engage
[46] throughout the research process; and memo ques-
tions and ideas during the analysis [47]. Two patient
participants engaged in member reflections [45] about
the ongoing analysis and 2 researchers and healthcare
providers were involved in peer debrief [44, 47]. An ex-
ternal audit [44] was completed at project completion,
confirming that the research process was thorough and
the quality and nature of the findings were congruent
with the process. NVivo 10 for Windows software (QSR

analysis.
Results
Four foundational conditions fostering engagement be-
tween physiotherapist (PT) and patient within a thera-
peutic relationship were identified and labeled: (a)
Present, (b) Receptive, (b) Genuine, and (d) Committed.
Present
Being present reflects physiotherapists’ and patients’ in-
tentions and abilities to be in-the-moment or embodied
in time and space. Physiotherapists make conscious
choices about the amount of time they spend in direct
proximity with patients in a potentially chaotic setting
laden with competing responsibilities. Therapists de-
scribed instances when remaining with the patient was be-
lieved to be of utmost importance, such as when a patient
needed “more one-on-one time” (PT-J) for guidance with
exercises or when experiencing emotional distress:
PT-B:... they start crying. .. the biggest thing. .. is don’t
pull away. Don’t walk out of the room. Don’t leave them.
While scheduling longer sessions (e.g., 30 min) was an
option, physiotherapists also described many impromptu
situations where a decision was made to remain with a
patient, despite the allotted timeframe:
PT-I: I think that if I’m with somebody who’s gone
through 20 years of struggle with this, I think I have to
take more time at the beginning.
Patients noticed their therapists’ efforts to “spend
more time with me than they should” (Patient-B).
Patient-E appreciated that “time was of no consequence”
because it gave the impression that the therapist was
willing to do “whatever it takes” to address the issue. Pa-
tients also noticed when therapists were not present and
the negative impact this had on their experiences, such
as when they perceived therapists were rushing. More-
over, patients were able to distinguish between a ‘busy’
therapist and a ‘rushed’ therapist, where a busy therapist
could be present despite the hectic environment:
Patient-D: They were busy as can be, just on a cycle
going from one to the next to the next and coming back.
They always took the time to make you feel like you
were a decent person.
In addition, physiotherapists and patients described
the importance of creating a “bubble” (PT-K) that allows
full engagement. Although therapists could be distracted
by multiple responsibilities, a busy caseload, and per-
sonal factors (e.g., family stressors), they took personal
responsibility to “turn those issues off” (PT-G) when
with patients. Therapists also described using non-verbal
cues and manipulating material space, such as adjusting
seating arrangements and using private rooms versus
curtained cubicles to help patient and therapist “narrow
down” (PT-E). Patients also spoke of their need to be
present during the interaction. Notably, they spoke of
being in-the-moment to understand their bodies and
“feel the treatment” (Patient-E) because “if I can’t tell
her [PT] how it’s feeling or how it’s reacting, I can’t help
her” (Patient-A).
Receptive
To be receptive, physiotherapists and patients must
enter interactions with: a) an open attitude to negotiate
appropriate treatment plans; and b) a focused receptivity
to identify salient issues and needs.
Open attitude
Having an open attitude requires physiotherapists and
patients to manage personal agendas and be willing to
be “open to all these things [treatments]” (Patient-A).
Even though therapists have specific knowledge and
skills that inform treatment plans, they also need “... to
be open and listening and not go into this [interaction]
with a pre-determined agenda”(PT-B). This includes a
willingness to listen to the patient’s story because it is “...
important to me as the patient that you hear and under-
stand what I need you to help me [with]” (Patient-E).
Allowing patients to tell their stories can be important
for developing a safe and receptive atmosphere:
PT-I: The big thing is that patients that are struggling
and... really have big problems, they need to tell their
story. You need to listen and shut your mouth.
The same is true for patients. Just as therapists need
to “... listen to all their [patients’] fears, all their issues...”
(PT-G), to create a working relationship, patients also
need
to
listen
and
be
open
to
physiotherapists’
suggestions:
PT-G: You try to explain what you are doing and they
keep interrupting you. They keep challenging everything
you say... They don’t listen to anything you say. That I
find really difficult.
Focused receptivity
In addition to an open attitude, physiotherapists must
also be attentive to the situation at hand. This is
achieved by actively considering patients’ verbal and
non-verbal cues. For example, focused receptivity helps
therapists gain insight into patients’ physical and psy-
chological states:
PT-B: They are guarded, they are tightening. .. you can
just see that they are upset.
PT-A: If they are not talking to you. .. or if their tone
has raised or heightened then you know something is
going on...
In addition to focusing on behaviours, therapists also
spoke of how being receptive to patients’ comments,
often noted either mentally or in the chart, was essential
Miciak et al. Archives of Physiotherapy  (2018) 8:3 
Page 5 of 12
 for identifying how to connect with patients about their
lives. This enabled them to “... gauge where that person’s
at and what their interests are...” (PT-E). This receptivity
fosters deeper engagement during the immediate inter-
action and provides opportunity for the same in the
future.
Genuine
To be genuine is to be real or convey sincerity in the
present. Being genuine in a therapeutic relationship has
three aspects: a) being yourself; b) being honest; and c)
investing in the personal.
Being yourself
To convey genuineness, individuals must remain con-
gruent with their personal qualities and values, while
maintaining an accepting attitude. To do this, physio-
therapists and patients must feel comfortable enough to
sincerely present themselves, not putting on a facade:
PT-I: I’m pretty open with people. I can talk to any-
body... I don’t change who I am in any role in my life. ..
I am who I am. I think patients probably feel comfort-
able asking me that because that’s kind of how we inter-
act as people.
Patients notice when physiotherapists are being them-
selves or have “warm”, “personable”, or “approachable”
personalities. In doing so, therapists create an environ-
ment where patients can also express themselves. Thera-
pists curb judgment of patients and are open to “where
that individual is” (PT-E) by acknowledging their unique
personalities, life stories, and social and cultural realities.
In addition, freedom for patients to be themselves ex-
tends to their bodies and injuries. Physiotherapists can
mitigate patients’ feelings of vulnerability that give rise
to negative perceptions of their bodies and injuries:
Patient-D:... [he] was very good at making me feel like
you weren’t abnormal... I don’t want to be singled out as
out of shape or old or... I didn’t quite know what to ex-
pect when the physiotherapist came in... I expected a fair
bit of judgmenty-type things the way that doctors would
sometimes.
Being honest
While honesty is likely a necessary condition for any
healthy relationship, there are two main qualities that
describe being honest in the physiotherapy context:
transparency and directness. Being transparent involves
therapists and patients providing the necessary informa-
tion to help the patient progress in a safe and meaning-
ful way. This can include impressions of the physical
problem and rehabilitation process; personal limitations
in skill and knowledge; patient participation and out-
come
expectations;
and
the
therapist’s
role
and
responsibilities:
PT-B:... being realistic about what’s going to happen. ..
I’m really honest with people about that and I explain to
them and especially with those more complex, that they
are 80% of what’s going to make a difference.
Patients must also be transparent about information
related to their conditions, or as Patient-C claims, it “...
is important for the patient to tell the whole truth...”
Physiotherapists agreed they needed to trust that “... they
[patients] are telling you the truth... all the factors that
are contributing.” (PT-E).
In addition to being transparent, the physiotherapist
must also be direct in the tone and manner of communi-
cation. Specifically, therapists must be clear and forth-
right. Although being direct might be interpreted as
stern, especially in challenging situations, the tone can
also convey concern or compassion. Ultimately, the ther-
apist’s intention is to be clear, leaving little doubt about
the message:
PT-H: She did have an injury but I had to explain to
her that, “The injury that you have cannot cause all of
the problems that you are having. Let’s try to figure out
what else is causing it.”
Investing in the personal
A primary focus of physiotherapy is to restore or main-
tain physical mobility and function. However, many pa-
tients and physiotherapists revealed that a personal
aspect was important to the overall quality of the thera-
peutic relationship. Being invested in the personal was
revealed through an interest in the person and a willing-
ness to disclose about self.
Taking an interest in the person pertains to therapists’
or patients’ desires to broaden the scope of caring to an
interest in the other’s life beyond the reason for referral:
PT-C:... folks that ask me how I’m doing, folks that ask
me how things are going, we end up talking about things
unrelated to their condition or the weather... We have
an interest in each other.
Even though therapists often need to know about pa-
tients’ lives for therapeutic reasons, those invested in the
personal are willing to get to know the patient as a per-
son, demonstrating an authentic interest in people’s
lives. This investment can put the patient at ease:
PT-I: Even when my questioning starts, you know I al-
ways ask them about them first. So, I always make it
clear that that’s really important to me... I ask them to
tell me a little bit about yourself outside of what’s
brought you here... What sorts of things do you enjoy
doing? Even the way I ask those questions is very differ-
ent. ... I can get to a person’s level of comfort and they
can relax a little bit if I ask them questions that are not
directed to their sore knee or sore shoulder. . .
Even though roles and professional boundaries might
make it difficult for patients to express an interest in
Miciak et al. Archives of Physiotherapy  (2018) 8:3 
Page 6 of 12
 their physiotherapists’ lives, they could be “genuinely in-
terested” in getting to know their therapists, asking “...
almost as many questions as you ask them” (PT-J). Fur-
thermore, some patients found value in knowing their
physiotherapists on a human level:
Patient-B: It makes a huge difference knowing that
they can relate to you, first of all and they have a real life.
They are not just a physio... these people go home and have
kids and have a family. It’s nice. You are both real people so
you should probably treat each other like people.
Another aspect of investing in the personal is demon-
strating a willingness to disclose. Being willing to disclose
means offering something more personal and not neces-
sarily related to the primary intent of the interaction.
Therefore, disclosures can be social or therapeutic. Most
therapists recalled they had different perceptions of what
constituted an appropriate disclosure:
PT-F: ... you can talk about personal interests and not
get personal so hobbies and what you might do in your
non-professional life that doesn’t have to do with any-
thing intimate... sports are good, music is good, leisure
activities. . .
Patients’ investments in the personal also included dis-
closing more personal aspects of their physical and emo-
tional challenges, including issues pertaining to sexuality
or mood. Although one therapist commented that there
are some patients who “... are comfortable disclosing
that information to you” (PT-A), this same therapist also
claimed that patient disclosures sometimes required a
“leap of faith” in the therapist. Patients agreed, com-
menting that disclosure of their physical issues and per-
sonal lives was easier as “... you get more comfortable so
you’re more willing to tell them what you are feeling”
(Patient-C).
There is a spectrum of how much physiotherapists
and patients are willing to invest in the personal (see
Fig. 1). For example, PT-D was very clear he was not in-
terested in his patients’ personal lives, making “... a point
to stay outside of those kinds of conversations”, nor was
he interested in discussing anything outside of the clin-
ical problem:
PT-D: I really don’t talk much on the personal side. I
really don’t think any of my patients even know how
many kids I have or what I do in my spare time. I don’t
think any one of them knows that... that’s purely on the
personal side.
Therefore, it appears there are different ways to be in
a therapeutic relationship:
PT-K: My partner is exactly the opposite of me. .. my
professional boundaries and his professional boundaries
are on either side of the continuum of professional
boundaries.
Committed
To be engaged, physiotherapists and patients must be
committed to their roles within the therapeutic relation-
ship. A patient’s well-being matters, or, as PT-A claimed,
“their well-being is your well-being...” This speaks to an
ethic of care that encompasses physiotherapists’ profes-
sional duty and the desire to be of service to others to
restore patients’ well-being. Some physiotherapists and
patients stated that therapists do not “fix” patients, but
that both have roles they must commit to:
Patient-B: You have to take care of yourself in order
for them [physiotherapists] to be able to take care of you
too. If you are just going to go and expect them to do it
all for you, it’s not going to happen. You’re not going to
get better, I find.
These points considered, there are two aspects that
characterize being committed: (a) committed to under-
standing and (b) committed to action.
Committed to understanding
Both physiotherapists and patients must be motivated to
understand the patient’s situation. When the physiother-
apist is committed to understanding the patient, there is
Fig. 1 Spectrum of Personal Engagement. The figure illustrates personal engagement as a spectrum involving a relationship between the nature
of engagement and the degree of personal engagement. The degree of personal engagement is dependent on the intentions and behaviours of
physiotherapist and patient
Miciak et al. Archives of Physiotherapy  (2018) 8:3 
Page 7 of 12
 a “... need to understand more about what you [patient]
are describing...”(PT-B). Therapists were not satisfied
with a generic overview of the patient’s situation:
PT-D:. .. if you give out the impression that you know
what’s happening in this person’s back without showing
them the interest or without making an effort in under-
standing it, you won’t be able to help them.
The physiotherapist is not only dedicated to under-
standing the patient’s physical situation, but also “a pic-
ture of the unspoken” (PT-C) or the psychosocial factors
that could be influential:
PT-H: If a person has what we would call a chip on
their shoulder let’s say, you try to find out what the chip
is. I see it as part of my job to get over that chip... If I
can find out what brought it on... Empathize. Sort of
understand.
Even though the physiotherapist is expected to try to
understand, it was also clear that patients needed to in-
vest in understanding their situations:
Patient-E: I felt I needed to understand as much of my
own physiology and biology in order to help what it is
that she was trying to do for me, so I could help myself.
Committed to action
Being committed to action involves making “all efforts”
(PT-D) to honour the best interests of the patient. Phys-
iotherapists “... do their best to do the best that they
can...” (Patient-C), and will go beyond due diligence to
help patients achieve goals. Therapists committed to ac-
tion recognize there are many facets of care to be con-
sidered, and that they may need to “go that extra little
mile” (PT-A) in complicated situations.
Patients must also be committed to act in their own
best interests. Physiotherapists spoke about the necessity
of patient “buy in” or as PT-G stated, “... they also have
to agree with what you are saying and be motivated to
take part in the treatment themselves because it's not
just passive.” Patients seemed to understand that their
motivation to participate was essential:
Patient-G:... they [patients] are expecting the physio-
therapist to “fix them” and they don’t need to fix them-
selves... I understand what physio means and how I need
to aid myself as well.
Patients highlighted that continuity, described as the
patient seeing the same therapist versus being shuttled
between therapists, is an important part of being com-
mitted. Having “your therapist” (Patient-B) facilitates
progression of the session, reduces the need for the pa-
tient to familiarize a new therapist, and allows the
physiotherapist to get to know the patient’s body, activity
levels, and treatment history:
Patient-G: “What’s your past injuries? How many in-
juries have you had? What's your sport history?” All that
stuff. When I saw (name of physiotherapist), it was like,
“Oh hey (name of patient). What do we need to work on
today?” He already knows how much I exercise and
everything.
The Conditions of Engagement Form a Safe Therapeutic
Container
The conditions of engagement work in concert to form
a safe therapeutic container for the therapeutic relation-
ship to manifest (Fig. 2). The foundational components
of the container – the bottom and the walls – are repre-
sented by the cornerstone conditions being present and
being receptive. Being present is the foundation that al-
lows the other conditions to unfold, while being receptive
provides the structure that enables pertinent information
to be gathered. There is more of a personal aspect to be-
ing genuine and being committed; the degree to which ei-
ther condition is established is reliant upon individuals’
uniqueness and circumstances. Essentially, the condi-
tions of engagement set the tone for “being” with
other and self, representing the dynamic intent to en-
gage that both physiotherapist and patient bring to
the relationship.
Discussion
We found there are necessary conditions of engagement
that facilitate the therapeutic relationship in physiother-
apy. In addition to providing needed clarity specific to
physiotherapy, these conditions offer insight into the
relevance of psychotherapeutic principles in physiother-
apy and how they can best serve practice and research.
Fig. 2 The Safe Therapeutic Container Formed by the Conditions
of Engagement. The foundation and the walls of the therapeutic
container represent the two cornerstone conditions, “present”
and “receptive”, respectively. “Committed” and “genuine” are
more variable and are therefore represented by the mobile
nature of the lids of the container

 The Relevance of Psychotherapeutic Principles in
Physiotherapy
Physiotherapy has previously borrowed theory from psy-
chotherapy to inform research and practice. In fact,
physiotherapy can be seen to clearly align with the ele-
ments of a psychotherapeutic process that involves an
individual seeking healing (e.g., patient) and a healing
agent (e.g., physiotherapist) investing in a relationship in
order to relieve disability and suffering while addressing
the individual’s beliefs and attitudes [27, 48]. This is a
compelling perspective as researchers and clinicians turn
their attention to psychological aspects rehabilitation,
such as patient expectations, beliefs, and emotions
alongside addressing physical impairment and function
[12, 48]. Given our results appear to have similarities
with Rogers’ necessary conditions of patient-centred care
[49], and that these principles inform motivational inter-
viewing [50], an intervention increasingly being used in
healthcare settings with positive results [50–53], we feel
there is an opportunity to consider their relevance in
physiotherapy. This is also important considering the
pragmatic differences between physiotherapy and psy-
chotherapy, including the conditions (e.g., mental illness
versus physical conditions) [12] and the subsequent
treatment goals.
Aspects of Rogers’ genuineness, unconditional positive
regard, and empathic understanding weave into our con-
ditions of engagement. For instance, Rogers describes
genuineness as being the expression of an integrated self
through self-awareness and transparency [18], which is
congruent with our description of genuine as physiother-
apists honouring their personal psychosocial situations,
disclosing personal information, and being direct with
patients.
While our findings complement Rogers’ conditions,
clear nuances are also present. Specifically, we added be-
ing present and receptive. Rogers [17] limits his discus-
sion of being present to the basic level of patient and
therapist being “in contact” (p. 90), and to some degree
influencing the experience of the other. However, we de-
fine being present as a foundational condition and
clearly describe the focused manner and intentional use
of time and space in creating a safe therapeutic environ-
ment. In addition, we explicitly identify receptive as a
condition. Although some might interpret being recep-
tive as an aspect of Rogers’ empathic understanding, we
understand it to have distinguishing characteristics,
namely that a therapist can be receptive but not be
empathic.
One difference between Rogers’ and our conditions re-
lates to who is responsible for developing the conditions
of engagement. Rogers describes the psychotherapist as
cultivating the conditions of engagement whereas our
findings indicate both physiotherapists and patients
must contribute. We agree that the practitioner is re-
sponsible for establishing the conditions that provide a
safe space for the patient to engage. Indeed, the physio-
therapist’s capacity to do so could be the deciding factor
in some patients’ willingness to engage. However, our
participants were clear that engagement involves the de-
liberate participation of both patient and therapist for
the conditions to flourish. This is consistent with Bright
et al.’s [4] concept analysis of engagement in rehabilita-
tion, which concluded that both clinicians and patients
have roles in patient engagement. Lequerica et al. [54]
also found that therapists’ ability to facilitate patient en-
gagement was supported by “... taking time to simply
talk to the patient about their life...” (p. 757), indicating
that engagement is two-way and that both therapist and
patient engagement can be essential in developing the
conditions.
The Impact of Conditions of Engagement on
Physiotherapy Research and Practice
Psychotherapeutic theories such as Rogers’ conditions
[17] and Bordin’s working alliance [14] are claimed to be
universal. Moreover, physiotherapy researchers tend to
assume that these theories directly transfer to physio-
therapy. By clarifying physiotherapy-specific conditions
of engagement, our findings clearly have the potential to
impact physiotherapy research and practice.
Regarding research, we need to consider whether
measurement scales developed through a psychothera-
peutic lens are valid within the physiotherapy context.
This view is congruent with Besley et al.’s conceptual
[22] and evaluative [55] findings. In particular, the evalu-
ative findings clarify that while the measurement proper-
ties
for
the
Working
Alliance
Inventory
[56]
and
Helping Alliance Questionnaire [57] were “adequate”
[55], there were also aspects missing. The authors called
for a better conceptual understanding within the physio-
therapy context in order to develop more rigorous meas-
urement tools.
Regarding practice, the conditions of engagement
speak to the essence of what is required to have a meaning-
ful therapeutic relationship. Much literature has focused on
the importance of communication in developing the thera-
peutic relationship [58]. However, relationships are more
than a compilation of skills and behaviours that can be
dutifully checked off when completed. Relationships are dy-
namic, requiring intent to ensure behaviours and skills are
congruent with the situation. Additionally, it is important
to note that a personal aspect can be important for physio-
therapy therapeutic relationship. Even though participants
described a spectrum of perspectives and practices regard-
ing the nature and boundaries of the personal, the majority
agreed that a personal aspect, understood as patients’ and
therapists’ authentic interest in the other’s life outside of
Miciak et al. Archives of Physiotherapy  (2018) 8:3 
Page 9 of 12
 the rehabilitation context or the disclosure of information
perceived as private, was important. This study illustrates
that patients and therapists may want to know one another
as people while respecting professional boundaries. More-
over, the conditions provide the foundation for a patient-
centred approach to be operationalized in clinical practice.
Being receptive, committed, and genuine create the safe
therapeutic space necessary for a patient-centred exchange
that highlights collaboration in order to establish meaning-
ful patient-driven goals [1].
As alluded to above, it is worth noting that the condi-
tions supporting the therapeutic relationship do not ‘just
happen’ by completing a list of behaviours. The condi-
tions in this context exist, at least in part, as a function
of physiotherapist and patient states or the quality of
consciousness experienced by an individual in any given
moment, whereas a condition of engagement can be de-
scribed as the sentiment or circumstances between two
individuals. An individual’s state is informed by a com-
plex merging of momentary thoughts, feelings, and sen-
sations in addition to more enduring attitudes, values,
and beliefs, which will inform that individual’s intentions
and ability to behave in ways that carry out those inten-
tions. Moreover, behaviours that are genuine and con-
gruent with a situation arise from appropriate states.
Therefore, if physiotherapists are aware of and able to
critique their thoughts, emotions, attitudes and assump-
tions [59] and adjust as needed, conditions can be devel-
oped, maintained, or deepened. This reflection can
occur outside of the clinical interaction, which is more
likely with novice physiotherapists or within the clinical
interaction, otherwise known as ‘reflection-in-action’
[59]. Reflective practice targeting therapeutic relation-
ships is critical for encouraging physiotherapists’ abilities
to cultivate the conditions of engagement. Without it,
physiotherapists risk self-limiting their ability to influ-
ence what is considered a key contextual factor [48]
impacting clinical outcomes [8–10].
Limitations of the study
There are three main limitations in this study. First, both
patient and physiotherapist accounts often centred on
therapists’ contributions to the therapeutic relationship
and conditions of engagement. Although this might be
expected given the therapist’s role and position of power
within the clinical interaction, a second interview with
patients would have provided opportunity to probe them
about their role in establishing the conditions of engage-
ment. Second, the exclusion of some patients limited the
nature of the data and hence, the possible breadth of the
findings. Other populations likely have additional con-
siderations (e.g., long term therapy and family involve-
ment for patients with neurological conditions) that
require focused investigation beyond the scope of this
study. Third, these findings would likely be most ap-
plicable for therapists in private practice physiotherapy.
Future research in other settings (e.g., hospitals, rehabilita-
tion centres) and systems (e.g., workers compensation)
will contribute to understanding the conditions that influ-
ence patients’ and physiotherapists’ abilities to engage in
the therapeutic relationship. However, because the condi-
tions of engagement are conceptual in nature, they could
be useful across a wide range of physiotherapy contexts
and health care professions as a foundational starting
point regardless of practice area.
Conclusions
Participants in this study have made it clear that thera-
peutic relationships do not ‘just happen’. Through par-
ticipants’ candid accounts we have highlighted that
conditions specific to the physiotherapy encounter cre-
ate a safe environment and facilitate mutual engagement
of therapist and patient. Cultivating these conditions, in
conjunction with applying communication skills (e.g., ac-
tive listening), will result in situation-appropriate re-
sponses. Findings suggest that theories developed in
other disciplinary contexts (e.g., psychotherapy) should
be used judiciously when developing theory that guides
physiotherapy practice and research regarding the thera-
peutic relationship.
