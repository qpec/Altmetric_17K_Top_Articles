 Gastrointestinal Cancer
TOUCH MEDICAL MEDIA

As is the case with most solid tumors, gastrointestinal (GI) tumors are treated 
in a variety of modalities, which are used singularly or in combination, 
including surgery, targeted therapies, radiation, and chemotherapy. Survival 
rates by stage in colon and rectal cancer are given in Table 1. 
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be malignant cells that have the 
capacity to initiate and maintain tumor growth and survival.1 They are more 
resistant to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents than other cancer cells.2 
The presence of CSCs following cancer therapy may explain the initiation of 
metastasis and later recurrence of cancers, which can occur even when there 
is a good initial response to radiation or chemotherapy.3 The first experiments 
suggesting the presence of CSCs in GI cancers were conducted in 2007.4,5 The 
investigators used flow cytometry to isolate CSCs using CD133 as a marker and 
then demonstrated the ability of these CD133-positive cells to form xenografts 
in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice.
Origin of cancer stem cells of the 
gastrointestinal system 
A schematic representation of an individual colon crypt is depicted in 
Figure 1. Stem cells lie at the bottom of the crypt and through asymmetric 
division are responsible for generating all epithelial cell types along the 
crypt–villus axis. GI stem cells may be intrinsically prone to forming CSCs 
because of their long lifespan combined with rapid turnover and it is widely 
believed that CSCs are derived from normal stem cells.6,7 Other possible 
sources for GI CSCs include dedifferentiated intestinal cells, possibly via 
nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) modulation of Wnt signaling7,8 and bone 
marrow-derived progenitor cells progressing through metaplasia and 
dysplasia to cancer.9 
Cancer stem cell biomarkers 
CD133
The CD133 molecule, which is also known as prominin-1, is a pentaspan-
transmembrane glycoprotein that has been shown to be located mainly in 
membrane protrusions.10 It was first identified as a surface protein marker 
of a subset of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as early as 1997,11 
but its biologic function has yet to be elucidated. In 2007, CD133-positive 
cells separated from colorectal tumor cells were demonstrated to possess 
self-renewal properties and high tumorigenic potential.4,5 Systematic 
reviews have indicated that CD133 is a prognostic factor in colorectal 
cancer (CRC)12 and gastric cancer.13 Carbon nanotube-conjugated CD133-
Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of phenotypically distinct cancer cells that may play an important role in tumor pathogenesis. The 
gastrointestinal (GI) system provides a good example for investigation of the role of CSCs in tumor proliferation; GI CSCs are suitable for study due 
to their abundance, proliferative potential, and consistent structural arrangement that is maintained under tightly controlled signaling pathways. 
GI stem cells have a long lifespan and this, combined with their rapid turnover, may predispose them to forming CSCs. Alternative possible 
sources of GI CSCs include differentiated intestinal cells, bone marrow, and cancer cells. Therapies that specifically target CSCs present an exciting 
opportunity to treat patients with cancer. Enhanced understanding of CSC markers, such as CD133, CD44, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule 
(EpCAM), may facilitate development of therapies that target them. Among the stemness pathways that have been targeted are Wnt/β-catenin, 
STAT, Notch, and Nanog.

Gastrointestinal Cancer
ONCOLOGY & HEMATOLOGY REVIEW 
positive monoclonal antibodies led to photothemolysis of CD133-positive 
glioblastoma cells in vivo and in mice,14 suggesting that CD133 may 
represent a useful target to selectively inhibit CSCs in CD133-expressing 
tumor types.
CD44
CD44, a cell surface adhesion molecule, is the principal receptor for 
hyaluronate, which is the most abundant extracellular matrix component.15,16 
CD44 has been suggested to perform functions in CSCs such as mediation 
of adhesion and homing to the stem cell niche, enhancement of anti-
apoptotic proteins and surface efflux pump expression, regulation of the 
cellular redox status and the response to the activation of the canonical Wnt 
pathway.17–19 Future research is needed to elucidate the suitability of CD44 
as a CSC marker in GI cancer and its role in tumorigenesis.
EpCAM
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), initially described in human CRC 
as a tumor-associated antigen,20 is expressed highly in a range of human 
epithelial normal and cancer tissues, including the colon.21 Several lines of 
evidence indicate that EpCAM is involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, 
migration, and cancer and stem cell signaling.22,23 
Other potential markers
More recently, identified possible markers of CSCs include: CD29/integrin 
β1, a mucin-like cell adhesion molecule;24 CD24/HSA, a extracellular matrix 
protein receptor that is involved in regulation of cell migration, proliferation, 
survival, differentiation, and death;25 Lgr5/Gpr49, a receptor for R-spondin 
proteins;26 and CD166/ALCAM, a cell adhesion molecule.27
Limitations of cancer stem cell markers
Identification and isolation of CSCs using putative surface markers has 
received much attention in cancer research. However, heterogeneity 
among GI tumors and GI tumor subtypes has led to difficulty in pinpointing 
unique markers. Expression of surface markers varies at different tumor 
stages and their main regulatory functions are not understood fully.28 Lack 
of universal expression of surface markers has obfuscated their use and no 
optimal combination of markers has been confirmed for the identification 
of CSCs. Further, non-CSCs have been shown to also express some of these 
markers.29 CSC markers are an area of continuous development as more 
studies identify molecules that may serve as new CSC markers and help to 
identify CSCs in GI cancers in a tissue-specific manner.
Cancer stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition 
Stemness, initially taken to mean expression of stem cell genes, such 
as Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, is a defining property of embryonic and adult 
stem cells.30 Stemness can be measured by a cell’s ability to form spheres 
when cultured in stem cell media.31 Chemotherapy32 and radiation33 have 
been found to induce the expression of stemness genes in cancer cells in 
vitro, thereby enriching the CSC population in the residual tumor. 
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the capacity of epithelial cells 
to acquire mesenchymal traits to allow local invasion into surrounding 
tissues and systemic dissemination to distant organ sites.3 Recent evidence 
indicates that EMT can induce differentiated cancer cells into a CSC-like 
state, suggesting a functional link between stemness and EMT.34 
Stemness pathways associated with cancer 
stem cells in gastrointestinal malignancies—
therapeutic targets
The desired aim is to overcome resistance to chemotherapeutics and 
reduce therapy-related toxicity by developing treatments that are specific 
for CSCs and that are not toxic to healthy tissues. Examples of stemness 
pathways as therapeutic targets are discussed below.
Nanog
Nanog, an essential regulator of embryonic stem cell self-renewal that 
inhibits differentiation, is overexpressed in a variety of cancers including

those of the GI system35,36 High levels of Nanog expression are associated 
with advanced stages of cancer and a poor prognosis, suggesting that it 
may play a key role in tumor transformation, tumorigenesis, and tumor 
metastasis.35 Nanog is involved in a complex regulatory network that 
determines cell fate, proliferation, and apoptosis (Table 2). It is therefore 
a promising therapeutic target. Genetic ablation of Nanog in SW620 
colorectal carcinoma cells suppressed both tumor growth in athymic 
nude mice and cell proliferation in vitro.37 Further, ablation mediated by 
short hairpin RNA decreased the expression of core CSC transcription 
factors, supporting a role for Nanog as a signali ng hub in CSCs.38
BBI503 is an orally administered investigational agent designed to inhibit 
Nanog and other CSC pathways by targeting kinases. Early signs of anti-
tumor activity have been observed in pre-treated patients with advanced 
cancer (BBI503-101, NCT01781455).39 In this ongoing, first-in-human, 
open-label phase I dose-escalation study, 11 of 20 evaluable patients 
(55%) had stable disease with a median time to progression of 16 weeks. 
Of these 11 patients, tumor regression and/or prolonged stable disease 
(≥16 weeks) were observed in 10 patients (50% all enrolled patients). 
Further, in biopsied tumor tissues, dose-dependent pharmacodynamics 
effects of decreased expression level of Nanog were observed. The 
recommended phase II dose of continuous once daily BBI503 was 300 
mg/day. At this dose, BBI503 was shown to be well tolerated and the 
pharmacokinetic profile supports once-daily dosing as an acceptable 
administration schedule. Mild GI adverse events were observed, including 
grade 1 and 2 diarrhea, adnominal cramps, nausea, and anorexia. Grade 3 
diarrhea was noted in two patients at 450 mg once daily. 
In an extension study of BBI503-101, BBI503 was administered to patients 
with advanced CRC.40 Patients (n=47) with heavily pre-treated CRC were 
enrolled. The disease control rate in evaluable patients (n=39) with high 
Nanog expression (biomarker positive) was 56%, whereas in biomarker-
negative patients, the disease control rate was 13% (p=0.04). Median 
overall survival in biomarker-positive patients (intent-to-treat) was 38 
weeks compared with 16 weeks in biomarker-negative patients (p=0.089 
Log-Rank). BBI503 was well tolerated at the recommended phase II dose 
of 300 mg once daily; grade 3 adverse events were diarrhea (n=5), fatigue 
(n=4), nausea (n=1), and weight loss (n=1).
STAT3
STAT3 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that appears to be 
activated constitutively in many cancers, to play a pivotal role in metastasis 
and tumor growth, and is associated with decreased survival.41–43 It was 
first discovered in 1994 as a signal transducer from cell surface receptors 
to the nucleus.44 STAT activation has been suggested to be important at 
every stage of metastasis (Figure 2). 
Napabucasin (BBI608) is an orally administered investigational agent that 
has been designed to inhibit CSC pathways including STAT3, Nanog, and 
β-catenin pathways by targeting STAT3.41,45 Pre-clinical data indicate that 
BBI608 inhibits STAT3-driven transcription and suppresses metastasis

and cancer relapse.45,46 An ongoing phase Ib study has demonstrated that 
BBI608 and weekly paclitaxel can be combined at full dose in patients 
with advanced malignancies (NCT01325441).47 Early anti-tumor activity 
was shown across several tumor types, especially in those patients with 
gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. BBI608-201 (NCT 
01325441) is a phase Ib/II study of BBI608 combined with paclitaxel in 
advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.48 
BBI608 at doses of 480 mg twice daily (BID) and 500 mg BID plus weekly 
paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) was well tolerated. Common adverse events 
included grade 1 to 2 diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting. 
Grade 3 adverse events including vomiting, diarrhea of five days’ duration 
or longer, fatigue, abdominal cramps, nausea, and dehydration. Early 
signs of anti-cancer activity were observed in a cohort of heavily pre-
treated patients. The BRIGHTER trial is a phase III randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel 
versus placebo plus weekly paclitaxel in adult patients with advanced, 
previously treated gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma 
(NCT02178956).49 There is also early indication in BBI608-246, that BBI608 
can be administered with folinic acid, 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan 
(FOLFIRI) with and without bevacizumab in patients with advanced CRC 
(NCT02024607),50 and in BBI608-224 with panitumumab in KRAS wild-type 
patients with metastatic CRC (NCT01776307).51 Early signs of anti-cancer 
activity in these studies warrant further investigation of BBI608. A phase 
III randomized study of BBI608 plus best supportive care versus placebo 
plus best supportive care is being assessed in patients with pre-treated 
advanced colorectal carcinoma (NCT01830621).52 
Notch 
Notch plays a role in embryogenesis, cellular homeostasis, differentiation, 
EMT, and apoptosis (Figure 3).53–56 Notch signaling is initiated by ligand 
binding to the Notch receptor, which then undergoes a two-step 
proteolytic cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteases family 
proteases and γ-secretase.57 Notch signaling can be inhibited by two 
major classes of Notch inhibitors: γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), including 
RO4929097, MRK-003, MK-0752, and PF03084014, and monoclonal 
antibodies directing against Notch receptors or ligands. GSIs have been 
shown to provide clinical benefit; for example, PF0308414 demonstrated 
early anti-tumor activity in a phase I dose-finding study in patients with 
advanced-stage solid tumors.58 A phase II study of 37 patients with 
metastatic CRC who had received at least two prior lines of therapy 
in the metastatic setting found that RO4929097 monotherapy did not 
demonstrate significant drug activity.59
Notch mediates biologic process through: a canonical pathway (involving 
ligand-induced cleavage of Notch for transcriptional regulation that includes 
Notch 1–4 and five Notch ligands Delta like, 1, 3 and 4 and Jagged 1 and 2;60 
and non-canonical pathways.55,61 Notch has also been implicated in crosstalk 
with other oncogenic pathways such as Hedgehog and Wnt signaling.62 Phase 
I/II trials of Notch inhibitors in solid tumors are in progress (NCT01647828, 
NCT01859741, NCT01277146, NCT01957007, NCT02259582, NCT01952249, 
NCT01189929, NCT01952249, NCT01189929). Examples of Notch inhibitors 
include the compounds tarextumab (OMP-59R5) and demcizumab (OMP-
21M18). OMP-59R5, which blocks both Notch2 and Notch3 signaling, has 
demonstrated any anti-tumor effect in patient-derived xenograft tumors.63 
A phase I trial (n=55) of OMP-21M18, which targets Notch ligand Delta like 4, 
revealed anti-tumor activity and good tolerability at doses of ≤5 mg weekly.64
Wnt/β-catenin 
Notch signaling can also interact with Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Figure 
4).55,61 The Wnt pathway has a key role in embryogenesis, with effects that

Post-Translational Regulation of β-Catenin Protein by Notch. Notch can negatively regulate 
active β-catenin levels an a non-canonical fashion. In the presence of Wnts., membrane-bound 
Notch forms a complex with active β-catenin and degrades active β-catenin through an endo-
lysosomal pathway· The degradation is independent of GSK3β-dependent destruction complex. 
Whether Notch is recycled back to the membrane is unclear. Notch intracellular domain (NICD) 
can also regulate active β-catenin levels in a similar mechanism but it is unknown whether 
endogenously processed NICD regulates active β-catenin protein. Protein interaction can be 
either direct or indirect. Reproduced with permission from Anderson et al.61

demonstrated to inhibit patient-derived xenograft tumor growth and to 
decrease CSC numbers.69
Additional signaling pathways 
There are many other signaling pathways currently under investigation. Focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase70 with important roles 
in adhesion, survival, motility, metastasis, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, 
cancer stem functions, tumor microenvironment, and EMT.71–76 Current FAK 
inhibitors mostly target the FAK kinase domain with the ATP-binding site 
to inhibit FAK kinase activity.77 Transforming growth factor-β signaling is 
important for self-renewal and maintenance in the formation of GI cancers.78,79 
Hedgehog describes a complex of molecules that regulate cell differentiation, 
regeneration, and stem cell properties.80 It is central to the development and 
homeostasis of gut tissue and is deregulated in GI cancers.81 The stemness 
factor Nanog is one of the major targets for Hedgehog signaling.82 Specific 
inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling, such as vismodegib (GDC-0449), and 
sonidegib (LDE225) are being examined in clinical trials in addition to the 
approved indication for basal cell carcinoma.83 Addition of vismodegib to 
oxaliplatin with 5-FU and folinic acid (FOLFOX) chemotherapy did not improve 
progression-free survival in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal 
 
junction cancer.84 
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a phosphatase that antagonizes 
the activity of PI3 kinase; PTEN-deficient mice demonstrate an increase in 
intestinal stem cells, which results in excess crypt formation.85 The PTEN 
pathway helps regulate the proliferative rate and number of intestinal 
stem cells.
Induction of cellular quiescence
An alternative to the CSC inhibition discussed involves the chemical 
induction of cellular quiescence. This is a state of reversible cell cycle 
arrest, associated with reduced translation rate, activation of autophagy, 
and a low metabolic rate as characterized by decreased glycolysis.86 
This is a burgeoning area of research and it has been suggested that the 
efficacy of CSC inhibitors and conventional therapies may be enhanced 
if used in combination with chemoquiescence-inducing agents such as 
chloroquine and its analogues.87–89
Cancer stem cell inhibitor trial design
Given that the CSCs constitute only a small proportion of an established 
tumor, a response rate read-out might not be the most suitable endpoint 
for a CSC inhibitor trial. The effect could be delayed and may better be 
captured with time-related endpoints using response criteria developed for 
immunotherapies.90
Conclusion
The discovery of CSCs—which have been described in GI neoplasms such 
as colon, pancreas, liver, and gastroesophageal tumors—provides promise 
of a suitable target for improving future oncological treatment. CSCs of 
the GI system are well suited to research as they are abundant, and have 
proliferative potential, as well as a uniform structural arrangement which 
is maintained under tightly controlled signaling pathways. The CSC model 
has been criticized for failing to take into account the heterogeneous nature 
of GI cancers. However, CSCs themselves may evolve over time, giving 
rise to cells that are both genetically and functionally heterogeneous.29 
Accurate targeting of CSCs must be preceded by precise identification 
and characterization of those cells. More research is therefore needed to 
determine which and how many markers need to be considered in the 
identification of GI CSCs.
CSC-targeted therapies may represent a new treatment modality in 
patients with cancer. Research continues to target CSCs to render them 
more chemo- and radio-sensitive, inhibit their potential to proliferate 
and undergo EMT, thus decreasing the incidence of metastases. 
Future challenges include optimizing the study design for determining 
investigational agents’ efficacy in cancer. ■
