IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether a lifestyle intervention can maintain glycemic control in
patients with type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE To test whether an intensive lifestyle intervention results in equivalent glycemic
control compared with standard care and, secondarily, leads to a reduction in
glucose-lowering medication in participants with type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, assessor-blinded, single-center study
within Region Zealand and the Capital Region of Denmark (April 2015-August 2016).
Ninety-eight adult participants with non–insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes who were
diagnosed for less than 10 years were included. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1;
stratified by sex) to the lifestyle group (n = 64) or the standard care group (n = 34).
INTERVENTIONS All participants received standard care with individual counseling and
standardized, blinded, target-driven medical therapy. Additionally, the lifestyle intervention
included 5 to 6 weekly aerobic training sessions (duration 30-60 minutes), of which 2 to 3
sessions were combined with resistance training. The lifestyle participants received dietary
plans aiming for a body mass index of 25 or less. Participants were followed up for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
from baseline to 12-month follow-up, and equivalence was prespecified by a CI margin of
±0.4% based on the intention-to-treat population. Superiority analysis was performed on the
secondary outcome reductions in glucose-lowering medication.
RESULTS Among 98 randomized participants (mean age, 54.6 years [SD, 8.9]; women,
47 [48%]; mean baseline HbA1c, 6.7%), 93 participants completed the trial. From baseline to
12-month follow-up, the mean HbA1c level changed from 6.65% to 6.34% in the lifestyle group
and from 6.74% to 6.66% in the standard care group (mean between-group difference in change
of −0.26% [95% CI, −0.52% to −0.01%]), not meeting the criteria for equivalence (P = .15).
Reduction in glucose-lowering medications occurred in 47 participants (73.5%) in the lifestyle
group and 9 participants (26.4%) in the standard care group (difference, 47.1 percentage points
[95% CI, 28.6-65.3]). There were 32 adverse events (most commonly musculoskeletal pain or
discomfort and mild hypoglycemia) in the lifestyle group and 5 in the standard care group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than 10
years, a lifestyle intervention compared with standard care resulted in a change in glycemic
control that did not reach the criterion for equivalence, but was in a direction consistent with
benefit. Further research is needed to assess superiority, as well as generalizability and
durability of findings.

irst-linetreatmentoftype2diabetesincludesdiet,physi-
cal activity, and weight loss prior to or in parallel with
initiation of pharmacological therapy.1 Whereas medi-
cation is effective in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)2 in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes, it is also associated with potential
adverse drug interactions,3 discomforts,4 increased eco-
nomic costs5 and decreased quality of life.6 Therefore, life-
style interventions are needed that are able to maintain gly-
cemic control to at least the same extent as medication.
In the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study,
reductionsinHbA1candglucose-loweringmedicationwereob-
served after 12 months of lifestyle intervention compared with
diabetes support and education.7 However, the clinical rel-
evance of this and other lifestyle interventions is limited due
to self-reported medication changes, use of drug-assisted
weight loss and weight maintenance, and the subjective na-
ture of unblinded, target-driven regulation of glucose-
loweringmedication.8-10Toourknowledge,only2studieshave
implemented objective target-driven regulation of glucose-
lowering medication when assessing the effect of lifestyle in
patients with type 2 diabetes.11,12 A randomized clinical trial
showed that an intensive diet intervention maintained glyce-
mic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, preventing an in-
creased need for glucose-lowering medication.11 The addi-
tion of walking provided no further improvements.11 In
contrast, improvement in glycemic control was reported when
adding supervised exercise, but with no concurrent reduc-
tion in glucose-lowering medication.12
The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to test
thehypothesisthatanintensivelifestyleinterventionisequiva-
lentcomparedwithstandardcareinmaintainingglycemiccon-
trol in participants with type 2 diabetes diagnosed less than
10 years, and secondarily leads to a reduction in glucose-
lowering medication.
Methods
Study Design
This study was a single-center, assessor-blinded, random-
ized clinical trial that took place in Region Zealand and the
Capital Region of Denmark from April 2015 to August 2016.
The full protocol is included in Supplement 1. This study was
approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee at the Capital
Region of Denmark. Guidelines from the Helsinki Declara-
tion were followed and reporting in this article is aligned with
CONSORT standards. All participants provided oral and writ-
ten informed consent.
Participants and Eligibility Criteria
Participants were recruited via media and the Danish Diabe-
tes Association and screened through telephone interview and
medical examination. Inclusion criteria were type 2 diabetes
diagnosed less than 10 years, body mass index (BMI; calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) of 25 to 40, and taking 2 or fewer glucose-lowering
medications. Exclusion criteria were HbA1c level greater than
9%, insulin-dependence, or presence of 1 or more of the fol-
lowing complications: diabetic retinopathy, macroalbumin-
uria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio ≥300 mg/g) or nephropa-
thy (plasma creatinine ≥1.47 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L,
multiply by 88.4]). At least 6 weeks prior to baseline measure-
ments, all participants had their glucose-lowering, lipid-
lowering,andbloodpressure–loweringmedicationstitratedby
the study endocrinologist to obtain prespecified treatment
targets.13 Response to the medical standardization did not con-
stitute reason for exclusion. Medical standardization was per-
formed to assess the effect of the lifestyle intervention with-
out amplifying the result due to poorly regulated HbA1c levels
at baseline. The data were collected at Rigshospitalet,
Copenhagen, Denmark.
Randomization and Blinding
Participants were randomized in permuted blocks of 3 and 6,
stratified by sex, to either the lifestyle group or the standard
care group in a 2:1 ratio. A computer-generated random num-
ber sequence was created by an independent statistician. The
sequence was given to an external data manager with no in-
volvement in the study procedures and concealed on a pass-
word-protected computer. After baseline measurements, par-
ticipants were given consecutive numbers, which were
forwarded to the external data manager, who subsequently re-
turned the corresponding allocation to the study nurse. Blind-
ing of the participants and the study nurse was not possible
after group allocation. However, the study nurse solely deliv-
ered the standard care treatment and had no role in assessing
the treatment actions, analyzing, or interpreting the data. All
test personnel and adjudicators of outcomes were blinded.
Interventions
All participants received standard care that included medical
counseling, education in type 2 diabetes, and lifestyle advice
bythestudynurseatbaselineandevery3monthsfor12months.
The study endocrinologist, who regulated all glucose-
lowering, lipid-lowering, and blood pressure–lowering medi-
cation, was blinded to group allocation and received all clini-
cal variables from the study nurse. To minimize the risk of bias,
prespecified treatment targets and algorithms13 for glucose-
lowering, lipid-lowering, and blood pressure–lowering medi-
cationwerefollowedbythestudyendocrinologisttoreachstan-

Question Can an intensive lifestyle intervention achieve glycemic
control comparable with standard care in patients with type 2
diabetes?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 98 adults with type 2
diabetes diagnosed for less than 10 years, and which was designed
to assess equivalence, the lifestyle intervention vs standard care
resulted in a mean change in hemoglobin A1c level of −0.31% vs
−0.04%, respectively. The 95% CI around the difference (−0.52% to
−0.01%) exceeded the prespecified equivalence margin of ±0.4%.
Meaning An intensive lifestyle intervention did not meet the
criterion for equivalence for glycemic control, but the direction of
findings suggests potential benefit.

 control was 6.5% for HbA1c level, and if this target was reached,
the glucose-lowering medication dose was halved. If the HbA1c
level was unchanged or lower at the following medical consul-
tation, the glucose-lowering medication was discontinued.
If the participant experienced hypoglycemic events between
medicalconsultations,theywouldcontactthestudynurse,and
the blinded study endocrinologist would consider whether
a reduction in glucose-lowering medication was necessary.
If HbA1c level exceeded 7.5%, the glucose-lowering medica-
tion was increased according to the prespecified algorithm.13
The lifestyle participants additionally received an inten-
sive lifestyle intervention, described in detail previously,13
which consisted of 5 to 6 weekly aerobic sessions (duration
30-60 minutes), of which 2 to 3 sessions were combined with
resistance training. For the first 4 months, all exercise ses-
sions were supervised, and supervision was progressively re-
duced during the 12 months. All supervised training was per-
formed in groups of 4 to 8 participants. Participants were given
an individual dietary plan with a macronutrient distribution
of 45% to 60% carbohydrate, 15% to 20% protein, and 20% to
35% fat (<7% saturated fat). During the first 4 months the total
energy intake was restricted. Individual and group-based di-
etary counseling were offered by clinical dieticians and pro-
gressively reduced during the 12 months. Additionally, par-
ticipantswereencouragedtobephysicallyactiveintheirleisure
time (≥10 000 steps per day). Steps and exercise sessions were
objectively monitored with a smartwatch (Polar V800).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in HbA1c level from base-
line to 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcome was re-
duction in glucose-lowering medication from baseline to
12-month follow-up. Exploratory outcomes included changes
from baseline to 12-month follow-up in total cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipo-
protein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-hour
glucose concentration following an oral glucose tolerance test,
maximal oxygen uptake (V
˙ O2max), weight, BMI, fat mass
(total and abdominal), and lean body mass. We also explored
the reduction in blood pressure lowering and lipid-lowering
medication. Additionally, we analyzed the proportions of par-
ticipants who discontinued their blinded, target-driven,
glucose-lowering medical therapy between baseline to
12-month follow-up as well as the proportion of participants
who increased their treatment according to the same prespeci-
fiedalgorithmbetweenbaselineto12-monthfollow-up.Incase
of any adverse events the participants in the lifestyle group
were encouraged to contact the intervention center and those
in the standard care group were advised to contact the study
nurse. At each medical consultation, the study nurse inter-
viewed all participants about potential adverse events. All out-
comes were presented to a blinded, adjudicated writing com-
mitteeandgroupallocationwasonlyrevealedwhenconsensus
was achieved.
Measurements were performed in 1 laboratory and
biochemical analyses were completed at the central labora-
tory (Rigshospitalet, Denmark) using standard procedures
(Supplement 1). Primary, secondary, and exploratory mea-
surements were performed in 1 day, except the 2-hour oral glu-
cose tolerance test, which was performed on a separate day 48
hoursafterdiscontinuationofglucose-loweringmedicationand
exercise cessation.
Sample Size
The predefined margin of equivalences was ±0.4% for HbA1c
level in relation to between-group comparison and was de-
cided by 2 clinical content experts (AAV and KBH). This mar-
gin was based on half of the effect that was considered a clini-
cally relevant reduction in HbA1c level leading to a reduction
intheriskofmicrovascularcomplicationsinpatientswithnewly
diagnosedtype2diabetes.14,15 Moreover,theminimumdetect-
able significant change in HbA1c level and what is recom-
mended as an acceptable noninferiority margin defined by
the US Food and Drug Administration were considered.16,17
This margin has been widely used in trials testing glucose-
lowering medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.18-21
In a two 1-sided test analysis for additive equivalence of
2-sample normal means with bounds ±0.4% [95% CI] for the
mean difference and a significance level of .05, assuming a
mean difference of 0 and a common SD of 0.9%, a total sample
sizeof120participantsassuminganallocationratioof2:1would
correspond to a power less than 50% (0.476). However, based
on a superiority approach (in potential favor of standard care)
it was decided (MR-L and RC) that a 95% CI excluding differ-
ences between groups of greater than 0.4 units would be in-
terpreted as indicating the absence of a clinically meaningful
difference.22 According to the principle of sensitivity, a con-
cept that refers to the sensitivity of the overall conclusions to
various limitations of the data, assumptions, and analytic ap-
proaches to data analysis,23 our estimates showed that includ-
ingonly90participants(60:30)wouldresultinreasonablecon-
fidence limits. Thus, the sample size was based on feasibility
within the local context enabling up to 120 participants to be
enrolled.Thesamplesizewastruncatedbasedonaformalstop

Statistical Analysis
The full statistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 2.
The analysis of the primary outcome was performed accord-
ing to the intention-to-treat principle. Imputations were not
used to replace missing data in the primary analysis, but were
included in a sensitivity analysis to assess missing data. Ac-
cording to Piaggio et al,24 equivalence is declared if the entire
2-sided CI ([1-α] × 100%) is included within the equivalence
margin. Accordingly, a 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in
change in HbA1c level from baseline to 12-month follow-up
between groups was derived from a repeated-measures mixed
linear model and equivalence was declared if the 95% CI of
HbA1c level change was completely within the prespecified
equivalence range (−0.4% to +0.4%).25 Equivalence was tested
using two 1-sided tests.26 The repeated-measures mixed lin-

The analyses of the secondary outcome and the explor-

presented as mean difference with 95% CI and P values for su-
periority. The secondary outcome (reduction in glucose-
lowering medication) was reported as the between-group dif-
ference in the proportion of the participants (risk difference,
percentage point), who reduced their need for glucose-
lowering medication according to the prespecified algorithm
from baseline to 12-month follow-up.13 A reduction from base-
line was scored as 0 (no reduction) or 1 (a reduction). Addi-
tionally, we explored the between-group difference in the pro-
portion of participants, who completely discontinued their
blinded,target-driven,glucose-loweringmedicaltherapyfrom

tion at 12-month follow-up compared with baseline was tested

 medication score from baseline to 12-month follow-up was
tested using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Sensitivity analyses included the baseline-observation
carried forward imputation technique, complete-case and
multiple linear imputation analysis. In the multiple imputa-
tion procedure the missing values at 12-month follow-up
were imputed including all covariates from the main model
(eTable 2 in Supplement 3). β-Coefficients and standard
errors were obtained from 30 imputed data sets and adjusted
for the variability between imputations.27 A per-protocol
population was defined by adherence to medication and
attendance at medical consultations in both groups and the
completion of 70% or more of the prescribed exercise ses-
sions for the lifestyle participants.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/IC
(StataCorp), version 13.1, and the statistical significance level
was set at α <.05 (2-tailed). A statistical analysis plan was de-
scribed prior to analysis.
Results
Between April 2015 and August 2015, a total of 878 partici-
pants were screened for inclusion, and, of these, 356 were
excluded primarily due to having a diagnosis of type 2 diabe-
tes for more than 10 years and insulin-dependence. Addition-
ally, 382 participants withdrew primarily because of geo-
graphical distance. Of the 98 participants who were enrolled
in the study, 64 participants were allocated to the lifestyle
group and 34 participants to the standard care group
(Figure 1). At baseline, the participants had a mean age of
54.6 years (SD, 8.9) and mean HbA1c level of 6.7% (Table 1).

 At 12-month follow-up,no significant difference (P = .22) in
retention rates was observed between the groups (97% for
the lifestyle group and 91% for the standard care group).
From baseline to 12-month follow-up, the mean HbA1c
level changed from 6.65% to 6.34% in the lifestyle group,
and from 6.74% to 6.66% in the standard care group, with a
mean between-group difference for change of −0.26% (95%
CI, −0.52% to −0.01%). For the primary outcome, the differ-
ence in change for HbA1c level from baseline to 12-month
follow-up was not contained within the equivalence margin
of ±0.4%, thus equivalence could not be declared in the
intention-to-treat analysis (P = .15) (Table 2). In the per-
protocol analysis the mean change in HbA1c level decreased
from 6.71% to 6.15% in the lifestyle group, and from 6.71%
to 6.50% in the standard care group with a mean between-
group difference of −0.36% [95% CI, −0.65% to −0.08%]
(P = .18). Thus, equivalence could not be declared (eTable 1
in Supplement 3). The analysis of the secondary outcome
showed that the proportion of participants, who reduced
the use of glucose-lowering medication from baseline to
12-month follow-up was higher in the lifestyle group (73%)
compared with the standard care group (26%) (risk differ-
ence, 47.1% [95% CI, 28.6% to 65.3%]) (Table 2), with a
number needed to treat of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.5). The least-
squares mean of HbA1c level is shown in Figure 2, and the
mean reduction in glucose-lowering medication from base-
line to 12-month follow-up is shown in Figure 3.
Exploratory outcomes are presented in Table 2. No group
differences were observed in relation to reductions in lipid-
lowering or blood pressure–lowering medication during the
12 months. Adherence to lipid-lowering and blood pressure–
lowering medication are reported in eTables 4 and 5 in
Supplement 3, whereas the proportion of participants that
reduced the use of lipid-lowering and blood pressure–
lowering medication is illustrated in eFigures 1 and 2 in
Supplement 3. Post hoc analysis showed that more partici-
pants in the lifestyle group eliminated the use of glucose-
lowering medication (56.3%) than the standard care group
(14.7%) from baseline to 12-month follow-up (risk difference,
41.5% [95% CI, 24.5% to 58.6%]). A larger proportion of the
standard care participants increased the use of glucose-
lowering medication (44.1%) compared with lifestyle partici-
pants (10.9%) (risk difference, 33.2% [95% CI, 51.5% to
14.8%]). Thirty-two adverse events occurred in the lifestyle
group (Table 3). One participant in the lifestyle group experi-
enced atrial fibrillation. Several sensitivity analyses con-
firmed the robustness of the primary analysis (eTable 2 in
Supplement 3).
At 12-month follow-up, 71% of lifestyle participants and
83% of standard care participants adhered to the prescribed
glucose-lowering medication (eTable 3 in Supplement 3).
The lifestyle participants completed 82% of the prescribed
exercise sessions, both aerobic and resistance training, dur-
ing the 12 months (eTable 6 in Supplement 3) and atten-
dance was 78% at the individual and dietary group sessions
throughout year 1 (eTable 7 in Supplement 3).
Discussion
The main finding was that an intensive lifestyle intervention
was nonequivalent compared with standard care in relation
to maintaining glycemic control, with the modest reduction
in HbA1c favoring the lifestyle group. Additionally, the life-
style intervention led to a substantial and parallel reduction
in glucose-lowering medication.
The finding that the lifestyle intervention resulted
in a rejection of the equivalence hypothesis may appear
unexpected as the utilized initial medical titration resulted
in all participants being very close to the HbA1c level treat-
ment target at baseline measurement prior to the lifestyle

 intervention. Additionally, the treat-to-target approach
intentionally induced a ceiling effect on HbA1c level
in both groups. Earlier studies have also addressed the
effect of lifestyle on glycemic control and target-driven
regulation of glucose-lowering medication. However,
the results have been conflicting11,12 and may to some ex-
tent be explained by reliance on advice-based exercise in-
terventions11 as opposed to supervision of exercise.28 Fur-
thermore, greater improvement in glycemic control is
associated with higher levels of physical activity,29 beyond
the current physical activity recommendations for patients
with type 2 diabetes.30
In the Look AHEAD study, a baseline HbA1c level of 7.2%
was reduced by 0.6% in the lifestyle group after 1 year.7 The
corresponding numbers in the current study were 6.7% at
baseline and −0.3% at year 1. The proportion of participants
in the lifestyle group who reduced the use of glucose-
lowering medication after 12 months was 73.5% in this
study compared with 7.8% in the Look AHEAD study.7 This
may be due to several factors including different levels of
supervised exercise and total exercise volume (duration,
frequency, and intensity), which in this study far exceeded
what was implemented in the Look AHEAD study.31 The use
of drug-assisted weight loss in Look AHEAD also differed
markedly from this study and may limit the true effect of
lifestyle intervention. Besides an extensive exercise inter-
vention, the blinded, highly standardized, algorithm and
target-driven approach to regulate glucose-lowering medi-
cation in both the lifestyle and standard care group was
a major strength of this study compared with other studies.
However, more adverse events were observed in the life-
style group compared with standard care, which may be
ascribed to higher susceptibility in this group in relation to,
for example, mild hypoglycemia because of the combina-
tion of lifestyle and medical therapy.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, only participants
with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than 10 years were
included. Prolonged diabetes duration, poor glycemic con-
trol, and insulin dependence8,12,32 may reflect a more pro-
gressive disease state. As observed in the Look AHEAD
study, better glycemic control and short diabetes duration at
baseline were associated with a higher probability of meet-
ing optimal care goals and remission of type 2 diabetes
at 1-year follow-up.8,33 Thus, the inclusion criteria in this
study may limit generalizability. Second, the lifestyle inter-
vention included several lifestyle elements, which chal-
lenges the interpretation of individual effects of each inter-
vention component. Third, the self-reported dietary intake
in this study is subject to biases and limitations.34 Fourth,
to be able to discriminate between the combined effect
of medication and lifestyle in contrast to medication alone,
a prespecified treatment algorithm using recommended
first-line medical treatments35 was employed, which led to
a limited number of medications. Therefore, it is not pos-
sible to generalize the results to other combinations of
glucose-lowering medications.

 Conclusions
Among adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than
10 years, a lifestyle intervention compared with standard
care resulted in a change in glycemic control that did not
reach the criterion for equivalence, but was in a direction
consistent with benefit. Further research is needed to
assess superiority, as well as generalizability and durability
of findings.
