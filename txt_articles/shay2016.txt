Objectives/Hypothesis: Determine the national incidence and disparities for common pediatric otolaryngologic
conditions.
Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative database.
Methods: The National Health Interview Survey (2012) was analyzed, extracting children with frequent ear infections
(FEI), nonstreptococcal sore throat (NSST), streptococcal pharyngitis (SP), hay fever, and sinusitis. Demographic data includ-
ing age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, geographic region, poverty level, and insurance status were extracted. The annual inci-
dences of these conditions were determined. Disparities in the incidence of each condition was determined according to race
and ethnicity, adjusting for other demographic variables.
Results: Among 73.3 million children (average age, 8.6 years; 51.1% male), the incidences were: FEI (4.0 million, 5.5%
of children), NSST (11.9 million, 20.6% of children), SP (8.0 million, 13.8% of children), hay fever (6.6 million, 9.0% of chil-
dren), and sinusitis (4.5 million, 7.9% of children). Black and Hispanic children were less likely to be diagnosed with FEI
than white children (odds ratio: 0.503 [95% confidence interval: 0.369-0.686] and odds ratio: 0.661 [95% confidence inter-
val: 0.515-0.848]), adjusting for all other demographic variables. Black and Hispanic children were also less likely to be diag-
nosed with SP than white children (odds ratio: 0.433 [95% confidence interval: 0.342-0.547] and odds ratio: 0.487 [95%
confidence interval: 0.401-0.592], respectively). Similar decreased odds ratios for black and Hispanic children were evident
for hay fever (odds ratio: 0.704 [95% confidence interval: 0.556-0.890] and odds ratio: 0.708 [95% confidence interval:
0.565-0.888], respectively) and for sinusitis (odds ratio: 0.701 [95% confidence interval: 0.543-0.905] and odds ratio: 0.596
[95% confidence interval:0.459-0.773], respectively).
Conclusions: Black and Hispanic children are consistently less likely to be identified or diagnosed with FEI, hay fever,
SP, and sinusitis compared to white children. These data likely highlight a significant health care disparity according to race/
ethnicity in otolaryngology.

INTRODUCTION
Racioethnic and socioeconomic health care dispar-
ities in the United States have garnered significant
interest in recent years. One of the overarching goals of
the national Healthy People 2020 initiative is to “create
social and physical environments that promote good
health for all” and address social determinants of health
in the United States.1 This emphasis on eliminating
health care disparities is shared by the Department of
Health and Human Services Disparities Action Plan
released in 20112 and the World Health Organization’s
Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2008.3
A large body of research has been dedicated toward
characterizing
the
considerable
disparities
that
face
many American children, particularly those of lower
socioeconomic status (SES) and minority backgrounds.4–8
Health care inequalities are well established regarding
pediatric asthma, obesity, appendicitis, and emergency
department care.9–13 Much of the existing literature
within pediatric otolaryngology has been dedicated to
identifying racioethnic or socioeconomic disparities in
relation
to
sleep-disordered
breathing,
acute
otitis
media, and chronic rhinosinusitis.14–19 However, there
remains a paucity of data regarding the incidence and
disparities of more common pediatric otolaryngologic
conditions
encountered
by
pediatricians,
emergency
department physicians, and otolaryngologists in a varie-
ty of health care settings.
In the current study, we sought to determine the
national incidence of common pediatric otolaryngologic

 conditions, including frequent ear infections (FEI), non-
streptococcal sore throat (NSST), streptococcal pharyngi-
tis (SP), hay fever, and sinusitis. We also evaluated the
demographics of US children presenting with the afore-
mentioned diagnoses to identify potential socioeconomic
and racioethnic disparities. We used the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS), a household-based interview
survey of a statistically representative sample of the US
civilian, noninstitutionalized population that provides
epidemiological data on various diseases. We hypothe-
sized that there are currently significant socioeconomic
and racioethnic health care disparities facing children
with these conditions. Awareness of the prevalence and
disparities of common pediatric otolaryngologic condi-
tions will allow health care providers, health policy mak-
ers, and government institutions to more effectively
target the needs of these children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NHIS data for the calendar year 2012 sample were
analyzed. This was a deidentified, publicly available dataset;
therefore, institutional review board approval was not required.
The data were restricted to sampled children (age <18.0 years)
based on the child flag variable within the dataset. Children
with frequent ear infections (FEI, �3 or more ear infections in
the previous 12 months), NSST, SP, hay fever, and sinusitis
were extracted. For each child, demographic data included age,
sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, poverty level, and insurance sta-
tus. Race was classified as white, black/African American, and
Asian/other. Ethnicity was further classified with Hispanic and
non-Hispanic. Income level was characterized relative to the
federal poverty level (FPL), which is determined annually by
the United States Census Bureau. Patients were divided into
four income groups: 1) 0%–99% FPL, 2) >100% but <200%
FPL, 3) >200% but <400% FPL, or 4) >400% FPL. Insurance
status was classified as a binary variable based on whether or
not the child was covered by active health insurance at the
time of the survey.
The presence of diagnoses was based on responses to the
following questions:
FEI: “During the past 12 months, has your child had three
or more ear infections?”
NSST: “During the past 12 months, has your child had
sore throat other than strep or tonsillitis?”
SP: “During the past 12 months, has a doctor or other
health professional told you that your child had strep throat or
tonsillitis?”
Hay fever: “During the past 12 months has your child had
hay fever?”
Sinusitis: “During the past 12 months has a doctor or oth-
er health professional told you that your child had sinusitis?”
Data were then imported into SPSS version 22.0 statisti-
cal software (IBM, Armonk, NY) for analysis. Standard demo-
graphic information was computed for the childhood population.
Univariate analysis was conducted to determine the relation-
ships between the presence or absence of each of the conditions
and racioethnic status, income level, and insurance status. Mul-
tivariate logistic regression was then conducted to determine
the influence of the demographic variables on the prevalence of
each of the conditions. Odds ratios were computed for signifi-
cant variables. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.
RESULTS
The overall study population consisted of 7.33 3
107 children with an average age of 8.58 6 0.6 years;
51.1% 6 0.5% were male and 48.9% 6 0.5% were female.
For
the
variables
of
NSST,
SP,
and
sinusitis,
the
responses were only collected on children ages 4 to 17
years on a subset population consisting of 5.77 3 107
children. The distributions of race/ethnicity and family
income are presented in Figure 1. Overall, 6.5% 6 0.3%
of children did not have health insurance at the time of
survey. The univariate analyses of the distribution of
each diagnosis stratified by race/ethnicity is described in
Table I. Logistic regression analyses were also conducted
with interaction terms for race/ethnicity with family
income level. No statistically significant interactions
were noted for FEI, SP, hay fever, and sinusitis.

 Frequent Ear Infections
Annually, 4.02 6 0.20 million children (5.5% 6
0.3%)
were
reported
to
have
FEI.
Black
children
reported FEI half as often as white counterparts, where-
as Hispanic children were diagnosed with FEI at 0.661
the rate compared to non-Hispanic children (P < .001).
Children from homes below the FPL and at 100% to
199% FPL presented with FEI at 2.1 and 1.7 times the
rate of children living above 400% FPL, respectively (P
< .001). Male children were also found to have a signifi-
cantly higher likelihood of having FEI than female coun-
terparts (P < .001). Children without health insurance
were slightly less likely to have FEI than children with
health insurance (P 5 .043). These findings are summa-
rized in Table II.
Non-streptococcal Sore Throat
NSST was reported by 11.89 6 0.35 million children
(20.6% 6 0.5%) during the year 2012. The findings of
multivariate logistic regression for NSST are summa-
rized in Table III. Black children experienced NSST at
0.574 times the rate of white children (P < .001), where-
as Hispanic children reported NSST at 0.663 times the
rate of non-Hispanic children (P < .001). Children living

 significantly less likely to have NSST (P 5 .017). Males
were also found to have statistically significant lower
likelihood of having NSST than female counterparts (P
5 .006). Logistic regression conducted with interaction
terms for race/ethnicity with family income found a sin-
gle interaction effect with Hispanic patients of the low-
est income group having further decreased odds ratios
for the diagnosis of NSST than would be expected for
Hispanic ethnicity and the lowest income level alone.
Streptococcal pharyngitis
SP was reported by 7.95 6 0.32 million children
(13.8% 6 0.5%) during the year 2012. The findings of
multivariate logistic regression for SP are summarized
in Table IV. Black children experienced SP at 0.574
times the rate compared to white children (P < .001),
whereas Hispanic children experienced SP at 0.663
times the rate compared to non-Hispanic children (P <
.001). Household income was not a significant demo-
graphic factor in being diagnosed with SP (P 5 .80).
Males were also found to have a lower likelihood of hav-
ing SP than female counterparts (P < .001).
Hay Fever
Hay fever was reported by 6.64 6 0.25 million chil-
dren (9.0% 6 0.3%) during 2012. The findings of multi-
variate logistic regression for hay fever are summarized
in Table V. Black children experienced hay fever at
0.704 times the rate compared to white children (P 5
.014), whereas Hispanic children experienced hay fever
at
0.708
times
the
rate
compared
to
non-Hispanic
children (P 5 .003). Families with household incomes
below 400% FPL were less likely to have children who
experienced hay fever in the previous year (P < .001).
Males were also found to have 1.34 times higher likeli-
hood of having hay fever than female counterparts (P 5
.001).
Sinusitis
Sinusitis was reported by 4.55 6 0.21 million chil-
dren (7.% 6 0.3%) during 2012. The findings of multi-
variate logistic regression for sinusitis are summarized
in Table VI. Black children were diagnosed with sinusi-
tis at 0.701 times the rate compared to white children (P
5 .013), whereas Hispanic children were diagnosed with
sinusitis at 0.596 times the rate compared to non-
Hispanic children (P < .001). Sinusitis was slightly more
prevalent
in
children
from
families
with
household
incomes below 400% FPL (P 5 .030).
DISCUSSION
It is well established that significant racioethnic
and
socioeconomic
disparities
exist
within
pediatric
health care in the United States.5–8 However, very little
is known about common otolaryngologic presentations
such as frequent ear infections, sore throat, hay fever,
and sinusitis in relation to pediatric disparities. This
study establishes the prevalence of these common pre-
sentations in relation to race/ethnicity and SES within a
large, representative sample population of US children.
The vast majority of research within the pediatric
otolaryngology community has focused on acute otitis

 media.15,17,19,20 The annual national incidence of FEI in
the pediatric population has decreased in recent years,
with a 1988 NHIS estimate of 9%, to 8% in 1997, and
6.6% between 1997 and 2006.21,22 Our findings reflect
this continuous downtrend of FEI (5.5% 6 0.3%). The
overall decline of FEI may be attributable to early vacci-
nation, aggressive antibiotic management, surgical inter-
ventions, and air quality improvement.23
We found a higher prevalence of FEI among white
children compared to black, Hispanic, and Asian/other
children,
which
is
consistent
with
existing
litera-
ture.6,19,21,22 Vernacchio et al.24 reported lower rates of
otitis media among Asian and black infants, though the
literature regarding disparities facing Asian children is
limited. Racioethnic disparities are controversial and
complex, and may result from physician biases regarding
clinical practice, patient biases in seeking health care, or
actual inequalities of health care access. White children
appear
to
undergo
tympanostomy
tube
insertion
at
higher rates compared to black or Hispanic children,
which may result from delayed access to surgical man-
agement for minority children.15,25 The senior authors
previously reported a larger proportion of black and His-
panic children with FEI who were unable to afford pre-
scription medications when indicated, compared to white
children.17 Although the senior authors also previously
found no race-based differences in antibiotic prescrib-
ing,26 others have reported that black children received
antibiotics
at
lower
rates
compared
to
nonblack
children.27,28
Regarding primary expected payer, we found that
FEI were less prevalent among uninsured children,
perhaps related to lower rates of formal diagnoses with-
in this population. Among insured children, Patel and
Schroeder20
previously
found
that
children
with
Medicaid-based insurance had delayed referrals for tym-
panostomy tube placement, with longer disease course,
older age, and fewer primary care visits prior to referral
than non–Medicaid-based patients. Our data support
previous reports of a greater prevalence of FEI among
children from lower-income households, though the liter-
ature regarding the relationship between SES and FEI
is variable, and the etiology for this disparity remains
unclear.15,29–31
Other
social
and
household
factors
known to be associated with FEI, including day care,
absence of breastfeeding, number of children in the
household, and passive exposure to tobacco smoke, may
potentially influence observed disparities.24,32
Pharyngitis accounts for 6% of pediatric visits in
the primary care setting, with a substantial estimated
annual societal cost of SP ranging from $224 to $539
million.33,34 Despite the large burden of NSST and SP,
very little literature exists regarding disparities of phar-
yngitis. We found significantly lower rates of both NSST
and SP among black, Hispanic, and Asian/other children
compared to white children. Children from lower income
families had lower rates of NSST, although we did not
find the same difference with SP. Unlike FEI, which is
more likely to acutely present with pain and fever, par-
ticularly among younger children, both NSST and SP
are more indolent and perhaps more likely to go unde-
tected by parents early in the disease course.
The higher prevalence of NSST and SP among
white children is unlikely the result of a higher predis-
position for upper respiratory tract infections. Instead,
white children may be diagnosed with and treated for
NSST and SP at higher rates, perhaps inappropriately.
Regardless of race, there is an overall underutilization of
group-A b-hemolytic streptococcal testing, and persis-
tently excessive antibiotic prescribing for children pre-
senting
with
sore
throat,
despite
clinical
practice
guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infec-
tious Disease Society of America to the contrary.35–42
Payne and Puumala43 found that minority children pre-
senting to the emergency department with fever or
upper respiratory symptoms were less likely to undergo
laboratory testing. Additionally, white children may be
more likely to receive antibiotics for SP compared to
nonwhite children.35–37 Thus, we propose that white
children may inappropriately be diagnosed with and
treated for strep throat. Conversely, black children are
more likely to be hospitalized for late complications of
untreated acute upper respiratory illnesses and influen-
za, suggesting barriers to health care access for early
diagnosis and timely management.44
Hay fever is often associated with atopy and aller-
gic asthma. Despite a reported higher incidence of asth-
ma
among
minority
and
lower-SES
children,10
the
current study demonstrates a lower prevalence of hay
fever among black and Hispanic children than white
children. We also found that children of lower-income
families were less likely to report hay fever. Although

 few studies have attempted to illustrate the complex
relationship of health care disparities and hay fever,45
hay fever is considered a disease of affluence and has
been associated with higher SES backgrounds and socio-
economic variation in allergen exposure.46–50 Similarly,
the racioethnic disparity of allergic disease and asthma
may be explained by differences in socially mediated pat-

Sinusitis is difficult to diagnose in the pediatric
population, and is often overdiagnosed in children with
upper respiratory symptoms. Our study found the preva-
lence of sinusitis to be significantly lower among black,
Hispanic, and Asian/other children. This is consistent
with data by Smith et al.,16 who found that white chil-
dren were more likely to be diagnosed with chronic rhi-
nosinusitis. Similarly, Soler et al.18 found that minority
adults with chronic rhinosinusitis had delayed medical
and surgical management and increased symptom sever-
ity at presentation.18
We also found that lower-SES children were more
likely to be diagnosed with sinusitis compared to their
wealthier counterparts. Physicians may overdiagnose
sinusitis in lower-SES populations based on upper respi-
ratory symptoms alone without diagnostic radiologic
evaluation, whereas wealthier children are more likely
to undergo definitive radiologic testing. Sedaghat et al.51
found that higher-SES and privately insured children
were more likely to undergo radiologic testing in the
emergency department for sinus-related complaints.51
Children with Medicaid coverage or lack of insurance
have been found to present with intracranial, and thus
more severe, complications of acute bacterial sinusitis.52
Despite the higher incidence of sinusitis reported among
children of lower SES families, there is a discordance
with the severity of the sinus-related complications seen
among these children. This may be potentially explained
by inequalities in referral rates, health care access, and
physician tendencies in diagnosis.
There are several limitations to this study. As a
cross-sectional survey, this study is unable to differenti-
ate between nuances involved in each diagnosis, such as
acute versus chronic sinusitis. Similarly, the FEI vari-
able might aggregate cases of acute otitis media, otitis
media with effusion, and otitis externa. As with any
survey-based study, the responses may be influenced by
the parent or guardian’s ability to accurately recall the
details of their child’s illness without the ability to cross-
reference with the child’s medical records.
Our study does have several notable strengths. The
data are based on a national household-based survey
with a large sample size, which allows for adequate sta-
tistical
power
and
sampling
of
multiple
racioethnic
groups. Our findings are generalizable to the US popula-
tion, as this is a household survey rather than an evalu-
ation of patients from a particular clinic or a specific
region of the country. Finally, the study minimizes sam-
pling biases because it is able to evaluate children
regardless of formal medical evaluation, in contrast to
insurance claims-based studies.
Although there is growing literature concerning
pediatric health care disparities, there still remains a
paucity of data regarding common pediatric otolaryngo-
logic presentations. The implications of these findings
are widespread, as these ailments are commonly man-
aged by nonotolaryngologists, such as general pediatri-
cians, family practitioners, and emergency department
providers.
CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this study provides the most
thorough contemporary evaluation of these common pre-
sentations through a well-established, nationally repre-
sentative
population.
These
findings
highlight
the
pervasive health care disparities that face American
children at a time when health care reform is at the
forefront of national attention. We hope that this study
inspires future prospective studies in otolaryngology to
improve outcomes for all American children.
