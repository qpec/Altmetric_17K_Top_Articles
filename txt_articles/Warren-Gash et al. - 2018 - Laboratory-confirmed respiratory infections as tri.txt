ABSTRACT
While acute respiratory tract infections can trigger cardiovascular events, the differential
effect of specific organisms is unknown. This is important to guide vaccine policy.
Using national infection surveillance data linked to the Scottish Morbidity Record, we identified adults
with a first myocardial infarction or stroke from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2014 and a record of
laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection during this period. Using self-controlled case series analysis, we
generated age- and season-adjusted incidence ratios (IRs) for myocardial infarction (n=1227) or stroke
(n=762) after infections compared with baseline time.
We found substantially increased myocardial infarction rates in the week after Streptococcus pneumoniae
and influenza virus infection: adjusted IRs for days 1–3 were 5.98 (95% CI 2.47–14.4) and 9.80 (95% CI
2.37–40.5), respectively. Rates of stroke after infection were similarly high and remained elevated to
28 days: day 1–3 adjusted IRs 12.3 (95% CI 5.48–27.7) and 7.82 (95% CI 1.07–56.9) for S. pneumoniae
and influenza virus, respectively. Although other respiratory viruses were associated with raised point
estimates for both outcomes, only the day 4–7 estimate for stroke reached statistical significance.
We showed a marked cardiovascular triggering effect of S. pneumoniae and influenza virus, which
highlights the need for adequate pneumococcal and influenza vaccine uptake. Further research is needed
into vascular effects of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
INFECTION
 Introduction
Ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory tract infections have been the three
leading causes of death globally for >15 years [1, 2]. Acute respiratory tract infections are associated with a
short-term increase in the risk of acute cardiovascular events [3, 4]. A systematic review of observational
studies
showed
that
cardiovascular
complications
affected
∼18%
of
patients
hospitalised
for
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with 5% experiencing acute coronary syndrome [5]. As the
population ages and the prevalence of multimorbidity increases, understanding and preventing interactions
between diseases will become increasingly important.
In population-based studies using primary care electronic health records, acute respiratory tract infections
are typically defined by clinical or syndromic criteria, as microbiological testing is rare. In hospital settings,
laboratory testing for respiratory organisms is comparatively more common, but is still likely to be limited
for patients with a cardiovascular, rather than respiratory, presentation. Despite extensive use of diagnostic
tests, no causative organism is identified in ∼40% of hospitalised patients with CAP [6, 7]. Inability to
discriminate between different causative organisms therefore limits the utility of many existing studies for
informing vaccine policy.
An alternative approach is to investigate whether existing vaccines against the two most common
preventable respiratory organisms affecting older people, i.e. influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae,
reduce vascular risk. Meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials of influenza vaccine versus
placebo in people with existing cardiovascular disease shows a 36% reduction in the risk of major adverse
cardiovascular events (risk ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48–0.86) associated with influenza vaccine [8]. For
pneumococcal vaccine, data on cardiovascular outcomes from randomised controlled trials are lacking and
selection biases associated with observational vaccine studies are well described [9]. Nevertheless, a recent
systematic review and meta-analyses of case–control and cohort data suggested that receipt of
pneumococcal vaccine was associated with a modest cardioprotective effect (pooled risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI
0.71–0.97) from a random effects model [10], which was consistent with the pooled estimate from a
similar systematic review [11].
In humans, both influenza virus and S. pneumoniae can have direct myocardial effects [12, 13] in addition
to nonspecific pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant changes, which are also seen in CAP and viral upper
respiratory tract infections, and may exacerbate underlying atherosclerotic disease [14]. Understanding the
relative contributions of different respiratory organisms to cardiovascular hospital admissions will inform
health
service
planning
and
guide
the
development
and
targeting
of
interventions
to
reduce
infection-related vascular risk.
Here, we aimed to quantify the association between laboratory-confirmed respiratory bacteria or virus
infections and risk of first myocardial infarction or stroke using self-controlled case series analysis of
anonymised linked electronic health records from Scotland in the UK. This study design is particularly
suited to the investigation of transient exposures and acute outcomes, and has the major advantage of
controlling implicitly for fixed between-person confounding [15], which may be otherwise difficult to
account for using routinely collected health data.
Methods
Data sources
We used general/acute hospital inpatient data from the Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01; www.ndc.scot.
nhs.uk). This is a large national dataset containing details of all episodes of admitted patient care
including day cases from acute specialities from hospitals in Scotland. Data are available from 1968
onwards
with
more
than
1.4
million
records
are
added
each
year.
SMR01
records
include
sociodemographic details, clinical data on diagnoses and procedures undergone as well as administrative
information such as admission and discharge dates.
We also obtained data on a range of laboratory-confirmed respiratory organisms from the Electronic
Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS; www.hps.scot.nhs.uk) dataset. ECOSS comprises
information on all identifications of organisms or infections of clinical and public health significance

 reported from National Health Service laboratories throughout Scotland. Samples tested for respiratory
organisms identified in ECOSS could originate from patients seeking medical attention for respiratory
symptoms in either primary or secondary care settings. Extracts from these datasets were linked by the
indexing team at National Services Scotland using a deterministic approach based on the CHI
(Community Health Index) number (a unique patient identifier).
Study design
We conducted a self-controlled case series study to investigate the relative incidence of myocardial
infarction or stroke occurring in time periods following laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections
compared with baseline time periods for each individual. Derived from cohort logic, self-controlled case
series is a design in which individuals act as their own controls during different time periods. This has the
major advantage of eliminating time-invariant confounding [15, 16], which is particularly important for
analyses involving routine health datasets in which potential confounding factors may not be adequately
recorded. Self-controlled case series analysis also allows for the inclusion of time-varying confounders such
as age and season in the models. Our null hypothesis was that exposure to acute respiratory organisms
would not affect myocardial infarction and stroke incidence.
Self-controlled case series designs are statistically efficient relative to the cohort method [16]. Our sample
size calculation, based on a relative incidence of 3, a post-exposure risk period of 28 days and 10 years
median follow-up duration, showed that 654 cases would be needed to estimate results with 90% power at
the 5% significance level.
Exposures and outcomes
Records of all hospital admissions for first International Classification of Diseases-10-coded acute
myocardial infarction (codes I21 and I23) and stroke (codes I60, I61 and I63) occurring in individuals
aged ⩾40 years during the study period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2014 were obtained from
the SMR01 dataset. We included a look-back period of 10 years to ensure that individuals did not have a
myocardial infarction or stroke diagnosis before the study period. All linked ECOSS records were then
extracted for specimens testing positive for one of the following respiratory organisms: influenza virus,
parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus or S. pneumoniae
during the same study period. Supplementary table S1 lists the specimen types and testing methods
used for different respiratory organisms. For inclusion, a sample had to test positive by any one of the
methods listed.
For each person, records of multiple respiratory organisms dated within 28 days of each other were
de-duplicated within strata of virus or bacteria. For example, two virus records within 28 days were
considered to represent a single episode of infection, with the onset date and diagnosis taken from the
earliest record. For inclusion in our analysis, each individual required a record of first myocardial
infarction or stroke and a record of at least one laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (defined in
supplementary table S1) during the study period. We restricted analyses to participants’ first myocardial
infarction or stroke, because experiencing a cardiovascular event may alter the risk of subsequent events
and self-controlled case series is based upon the assumption that recurrent events occurring within
individuals are independent.
Statistical analysis
We used conditional Poisson regression to calculate the relative incidence of first myocardial infarction
and stroke occurring in pre-defined exposure periods after confirmed respiratory infections compared with
unexposed or baseline time periods. We divided the exposure period into days 1–3, 4–7, 8–14 and 15–28
after acute respiratory tract infection (figure 1).
We defined a separate pre-exposure period of day 0–14 before isolation of a respiratory organism and
excluded this from baseline time: having a cardiovascular event in this period (e.g. a stroke) may affect the
subsequent likelihood of recording of respiratory organisms (e.g. an episode of hospital-acquired
pneumonia after stroke). We calculated the incidence ratio (IR) for myocardial infarction or stroke
occurring in each exposure period compared with baseline time using conditional Poisson regression
models that also adjusted for the time-varying confounders age in 5-year age groups and season in
3-month blocks.
We presented results separately for myocardial infarction and stroke and for respiratory bacteria
(S. pneumoniae) and respiratory viruses (combined). In self-controlled case series analysis, the outcome
should not censor follow-up so we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of excluding records
for individuals who died within 30 days of myocardial infarction or stroke [15]. We also investigated the
effect of stratifying by age at cardiovascular event (age <65 versus ⩾65 years) and by whether respiratory

Results
Description of study participants
We included 1227 individuals with first myocardial infarction (61% male) and 762 with first stroke (51%
male) with a median (interquartile range (IQR)) age of 68 (59–77) years at the date of cardiovascular
event. Patients with myocardial infarction had records for 924 separate episodes of S. pneumoniae
infection and 491 episodes of respiratory virus infection during the study period (mean±SD 1.15±0.55
samples per person). For stroke patients, the equivalent figures were 576 episodes of S. pneumoniae
infection and 276 episodes of respiratory virus infection (mean±SD 1.12±0.45 samples per person)
(supplementary table S2). Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of participants.
Effect of respiratory organisms on first myocardial infarction and stroke
The age- and season-adjusted IR for first myocardial infarction was markedly raised in the first 1–3 days
after both respiratory bacterial and viral infections (IR for S. pneumoniae 5.98, 95% CI 2.47–14.4; p<0.001
and IR for viruses 5.59, 95% CI 1.77–17.6; p=0.003), and persisted for ∼1 week. For first episodes
of stroke, the point estimate was even higher (adjusted IR for S. pneumoniae 12.3, 95% CI 5.48–27.7;
p<0.001 and adjusted IR for viruses 6.79, 95% CI 1.67–27.5; p=0.007) for days 1–3. Elevated rates of stroke
following both bacterial and viral infections persisted to 28 days (p<0.001). Full results are shown in table 2.
Sensitivity analysis removing fatal events
Excluding 101 myocardial infarction records with a date of death within 30 days (8% of the total) made
little difference to the overall findings: in this analysis, the age- and season-adjusted IR for myocardial
infarction associated with S. pneumoniae was 5.41 (95% CI 2.02–14.5) in days 1–3; for respiratory viruses,
the equivalent adjusted IR was 6.20 (95% CI 1.97–19.6). Patterns across the 1–28-day risk period were
similar to the main model. For stroke, 107 records of fatal events (14% of the total) were excluded. After
this, the new adjusted IR associated with S. pneumoniae was 9.87 (95% CI 3.67–26.5) in days 1–3 and all
IRs remained elevated to 28 days. In contrast, for respiratory viruses, although all point estimates were
elevated, only the day 8–14 and 15–28 estimates reached statistical significance. Table 3 shows the full
results of this sensitivity analysis.
Stratified analysis
By organism (influenza versus all other respiratory viruses)
In general, influenza virus was associated with higher IRs for both myocardial infarction and stroke than
all other respiratory viruses combined, although numbers in some cells were small and confidence
intervals overlapped. For myocardial infarction, the adjusted day 1–3 IR for influenza virus was 9.80

 (95% CI 2.37–40.5) and for other respiratory viruses it was 2.81 (95% CI 0.39–20.3). For stroke, the
adjusted day 1–3 IR after influenza virus was 7.82 (95% CI 1.07–56.9) and for other respiratory viruses it
was 4.86 (95% CI 0.67–35.4). IRs for other time periods are shown in table 4.
By age
Stratifying by age at cardiovascular event was also hampered by small numbers and some cells contained
zero events. Nevertheless, those aged <65 years tended to have higher adjusted IRs for myocardial
infarction and stroke after respiratory bacteria and virus infections than those aged ⩾65 years, although
there were overlapping confidence intervals. Full results are shown in table 5.
Discussion
We show that infection with S. pneumoniae and a range of different respiratory viruses is associated with
increased rates of first myocardial infarction and stroke in a Scottish adult population. The period of
elevated risk associated with infections persisted to 28 days for stroke, but was more transient for
myocardial infarction, suggesting potentially different mechanisms. While the vaccine-preventable
organisms influenza virus and S. pneumoniae were associated with particularly high IRs for vascular

 events, we also showed an effect of other viruses, for which vaccines are not currently available, although
this was significant only for stroke. The finding of higher IRs in people aged <65 years warrants further
exploration but may relate to vaccine: influenza vaccine uptake reached 77% in Scotland during the period
of observation among those aged ⩾65 years [17] but was much lower in younger people, who may not be
eligible for vaccination. This highlights the need to consider other prevention and treatment options for
acute respiratory tract infections, especially among patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.
Strengths of our study include the novel use of data on laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from
11 years of national surveillance in Scotland linked to robust vascular outcome measures from national
hospitalisation records. A unique advantage of the self-controlled case series method is its ability to
control for fixed confounders [15], which may distort findings from other similar studies using routine
health data. We also controlled for the time-varying effects of age and season, so residual confounding by
other time-varying factors is unlikely. We showed a biological gradient of stroke and, to a lesser extent,
myocardial infarction risk after acute respiratory tract infections, which is likely to indicate a causal
relationship. Use of laboratory-confirmed infection measures improved diagnostic specificity and therefore
the relevance of results for vaccine policy. Our population-based approach means that results should be
generalisable to similar Northern European populations.
Our study nevertheless had some limitations. Although primary analyses were well powered and
self-controlled case series is an efficient design, the relatively small population size in Scotland meant that
the study lacked power for some subgroup analyses. It was not possible to investigate the effects of
individual noninfluenza respiratory viruses on vascular events or to examine age effects in detail. We were
also unable to investigate the effect of co-infections separately, although the number of patients
experiencing co-infections was extremely small. During the study period there were changes in
microbiological testing practices, e.g. PCR was not widely used in 2004. However, if testing methods were
relatively less sensitive in the earlier years of our study, this would potentially reduce the number of
patients meeting inclusion criteria (and therefore statistical power) rather than introduce bias. While we

 could not exclude the chance that some organisms isolated might represent incidental colonisation rather
than symptomatic infections, this would have the effect of biasing results towards the null. In addition, we
used the day after the date of respiratory sampling as the start of the risk period. However, the infection
onset date would have occurred earlier, most likely during the 14-day period excluded from baseline time,
which would have led to underestimation of the true effect size.
The effect of influenza virus on cardiovascular hospital admissions and deaths is well documented in
different settings [18, 19]. Recent studies describe high rates of morbidity and seasonal mortality among
older adults infected with other respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza
virus, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus [20–23]. We recently showed that circulation of adenovirus,
human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus was associated with
hospitalisations for cardiovascular disease at the population level [24]. In this self-controlled case series
analysis, we confirm and extend findings from individual-level studies using primary care data that show an
acute triggering effect of clinically diagnosed acute respiratory tract infections on myocardial infarction and
stroke [25, 26]. The higher point estimates for influenza compared with other respiratory viruses are
consistent with previous findings suggesting that cardiovascular complications are more frequent with
influenza than other viruses such as rhinovirus among hospitalised adults [20].
Our findings that both influenza virus and S. pneumoniae have specific triggering effects on myocardial
infarction and stroke emphasise the need to encourage uptake of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines
wherever indicated, especially among populations with existing heart disease in whom influenza vaccine
uptake is suboptimal [27]. Trials are ongoing to investigate the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine
against cardiovascular events [28], and the effects of different formulations and target populations for
influenza vaccination on individual cardiovascular end-points (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02831608,
NCT02762851, NCT02787044 and NCT02268500). Demonstration of significant cardiovascular protection
will inform updated cost-effectiveness analyses and consideration of extending indication for these
vaccines to at-risk groups who do not meet current guidelines for vaccination.
The finding that other respiratory viruses for which vaccines are not available also act as cardiovascular
triggers merits further exploration. It potentially strengthens the case for considering antithrombotic
strategies during acute respiratory tract infections for vulnerable groups, especially as recent evidence
points
to
a
dual
effect
of
acute
respiratory
tract
infections
and
symptomatic
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug treatment on cardiovascular risk [29]. Future research should focus on informing
development and delivery of stratified interventions to reduce vascular risk associated with a range of
respiratory organisms. Large robust population studies are needed to investigate the effects of acute
respiratory tract infections on vascular risk in different population subgroups, e.g. those with individual
cardiovascular risk factors, and for subsets of infections such as bacteria causing atypical pneumonias and,
in particular, noninfluenza respiratory viruses.
In conclusion, we show a marked cardiovascular triggering effect of S. pneumoniae and influenza virus, as
well as raised point estimates for myocardial infarction and stroke associated with other confirmed
respiratory viruses.
