ABSTRACT
Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a devastating disease in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
Based on the unsatisfactory results of autologous mononuclear cell transplantation for patients
with CLI undergoing HD, we conducted a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy
of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood-derived autologous
purified CD34 positive (CD34+) cell transplantation for CLI in patients undergoing HD. Six patients
with CLI (two with Rutherford category 4 and four with Rutherford category 5) were enrolled. As
for primary endpoint, there were no major adverse events related to this therapy. As for efficacy,
the amputation-free survival rate was 100% at 1 year after cell therapy. Both rest pain scale and
ulcer size were significantly improved as early as 4 weeks after therapy compared with baseline
(p < .01), and three out of five ulcers completely healed within 12 weeks after cell transplantation.
Clinical severity, including Fontaine scale and Rutherford category, significantly improved at
24 weeks after cell transplantation (p < .05), and further improved at 52 weeks (p < .01) compared
with baseline. The improvement rate from CLI stage to non-CLI stage was 83.3% at 52 weeks. Toe
skin perfusion pressure and absolute claudication distance were also significantly improved. In
conclusion, G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cell transplantation was safe, feasible, and
effective for patients with CLI undergoing HD. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Improvement of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is often very difficult. Because outcome in CLI
patients, especially in hemodialysis (HD) patients, is very poor, effective treatment is urgently
needed. CD34 positive cells have potential to vascular regeneration. However, the number of
peripheral blood CD34 positive cells is severely decreased in HD patients with CLI due to uremic
condition and inflammation. Mobilization by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) sig-
nificantly increased the number of CD34 positive cells in peripheral blood, and potential of
CD34 positive cells was also confirmed in this study. Although this is a small study, regenerative
therapy using autologous G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood CD34 positive cell transplantation
was highly effective in HD patients with CLI. This result may encourage novel cell-based therapy
for patients with CLI requiring HD.
INTRODUCTION
The prognosis of patients with critical limb
ischemia (CLI) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is
poor [1, 2]. In patients with CLI, revasculariza-
tion therapy, including bypass surgery or endo-
vascular
therapy
(EVT),
is
an
essential
treatment strategy. However, revascularization
therapy
still
has
significant
limitations
in
patients with HD. Infrapopliteal arteries are the
most frequent affected sites for CLI in patients
undergoing HD, and these arteries usually
show extensive vascular calcification [3]. A

HUMAN CLINICAL ARTICLE
 recent report demonstrated that the restenosis rate is high
after EVT for below-knee arteries in patients with CLI undergo-
ing HD, that is, 73% and 84% at 3 and 12 months, respectively
[4]. Moreover, outcomes after revascularization therapy are
suboptimal. The amputation-free survival (AFS) rates after EVT
for infrapopliteal lesions in patients undergoing HD are 65.7%
and 34.4% at 1 and 5 years, respectively [5]. Another report
demonstrated that the mortality rate is high after EVT, that is,
191 deaths among 547 patients (35%) after a median observa-
tion period of 557 days [6]. In terms of outcomes after bypass
surgery for below-knee arteries in patients undergoing HD, the
1-year AFS rates were 64% [7] and 60% [8], respectively.
In 1997, Asahara et al. isolated CD34 positive (CD34+) cells
from the peripheral blood (PB) as endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs) [9] and confirmed the vasculogenic potential of these
EPCs using a model of hind limb ischemia. Subsequently, sev-
eral clinical trials of regenerative therapy for CLI using autolo-
gous mononuclear cells (MNCs) derived from bone marrow
(BM) or PB were conducted [10–22]. Two types of MNCs
were used, that is, whole MNCs containing several cell types
and purified CD34+ cells after selection from MNCs. Transplan-
tation of unselected peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMNCs) resulted in favorable outcomes in non-HD patients
with CLI (2-year AFS 83%) [15]; however, the outcomes in
patients with CLI undergoing HD were disappointing (2-year
AFS 49%) [15]. Transplantation with bone marrow mononu-
clear cells (BMMNCs) or PBMNCs [13, 15–17] did not provide
advantages in AFS or overall survival rates for patients under-
going HD compared with those in revascularization ther-
apy [5–8].
In comparison with transplantation of whole PBMNCs, few
attempts have been made to transplant purified CD34+ cells
for CLI in patients undergoing HD, and the efficacy of treat-
ment has not been confirmed [14, 22]. Furthermore, these tri-
als were not performed in a prespecified manner for patients
with CLI undergoing HD. Human CD34+ cells express tran-
scripts for, and secrete detectable amounts of vascular endo-
thelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like
growth factor-1, fibroblast growth factor 2, Flt-3 ligand, and
interleukin 8 [23]. Exosomes secreted from mobilized human
CD34+ cells had significant vasculogenic paracrine activity
in vitro and in vivo [24].
Therefore, this study conducted a prospective interven-
tional phase II clinical trial using autologous granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PB-derived CD34+
cell transplantation focusing on HD patients with CLI.
METHODS
Study Design and Criteria for Enrollment
The article was designed to prospectively evaluate the safety,
feasibility, and efficacy of autologous G-CSF-mobilized CD34+
cells in patients with CLI requiring HD. The study protocol con-
formed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by
the institutional ethics committees (no. TGE00301-024) and
special committee for Class II regenerative medicine certified
by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan
(no. SKRM-001). The article was registered to an official clinical
trial registration site (UMIN no. 000015266).
Eligible subjects fulfilled all inclusion criteria as follows
(a) atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with
greater than or equal to 70% luminal stenosis or obstruction in
the leg arteries by digital subtraction angiography; (b) more
than 3 months since the initiation of HD; (c) more than
6 months since the onset of lower limb ischemia; (d) CLI with
a Rutherford category of 4–5; (e) failure of or no indication for
transluminal angioplasty/stenting and bypass surgery; (f ) men
or women ages 20–80 years; and (g) provided written
informed consent. The exclusion criteria were as follows:
(a) Buerger’s disease; (b) CLI of Rutherford category 6;
(c) within 1 month after revascularization therapy (bypass sur-
gery or EVT) or low-density lipoprotein apheresis; (d) within
1 month after myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris,
or stroke; (e) malignancy or history of malignancy within past
5 years; (f ) diabetic retinopathy (new Fukuda Classification
[25]: B II—BV); (g) severely decreased cardiac function (left
ventricular ejection fraction <25% on cardiac ultrasonography);
(h) interstitial pneumonitis proved on chest computed tomog-
raphy; (i) allergic reaction to G-CSF or other reagents used in
this study; (j) splenomegaly on computed tomography or ultra-
sonography; (k) at least one laboratory abnormality (white
blood cell [WBC] ≤3000 per microliter or ≥15000 per microliter,
hemoglobin concentration ≤8 g/dl, platelet count ≤104 per
microliter, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransfer-
ase ≥100 IU/l, serum albumin ≤2 g/dl); (l) liver cirrhosis;
(m) hematologic disease (leukemia, myeloproliferative or dys-
plastic disorder, and sickle cell anemia); and (n) pregnancy.
After evaluation of the eligibility of each candidate for this
cell-based therapy by the case enrollment committee, appro-
priate case selection was confirmed at the independent case
registration center in the Translational Research Informatics
Center (TRI), Kobe, Japan.
Rules and Definitions
During the study period, the basic protocol treatment accord-
ing to Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II (medication,
wound treatment) [26] was given to all patients. Anti-platelet
drugs and prostaglandin E1 or I2 analog were not allowed to
be added during the study period. If these drugs had already
been prescribed, the drug dose was not changed. Pain
control was essentially performed using nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatories if needed.
Major cardiovascular events were defined as death due
to coronary artery disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
resuscitation after cardiac arrest, stroke, or EVT and/or
bypass surgery involving the cerebral, coronary, aortic, or
peripheral arteries. Major and minor amputations were dis-
tinguished by amputation sites proximal and distal to the
ankle joint.
Treatment Procedures
Patients received subcutaneous administration of G-CSF to
mobilize EPCs from the BM. The dose of G-CSF was 5 μg/kg
per day for 5 days, and leukapheresis (COMTEC, Fresenius
Kabi Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) was performed to harvest
PBMNCs on day 5. G-CSF was scheduled to be cancelled
when the WBC count was greater than or equal to 75,000
per microliter; however, the leukocyte count never exceeded
75,000 per microliter in any patient. The leukapheresis prod-
uct was kept at a concentration of 2 × 108 cells per milliliter

 in autoplasma at 4�C–8�C overnight (≤18 hours) until the
magnetic separation of CD34+ cells was started on day 6 using
a CliniMACS Instrument (MiltenyBiotec, BergischGladbach,
Germany), anti-CD34 antibody-labeled magnetic nanobeads,
phosphate-buffered
saline/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid
buffer, and a tubing set (MiltenyiBiotec, BergischGladbach,
Germany).
Cell transplantation was performed under general anes-
thesia immediately after CD34+ cell separation. All CD34+
cells dissolved in 10 ml physiological saline were adminis-
tered intramuscularly into 40 sites (0.25 ml per site) of the
leg with more severe ischemia in each patient. When the
Rutherford severity was the same in bilateral legs, half of the
cells were injected in each leg. The administration points con-
sisted of 30 sites in the calf muscle, 6 sites in the sole mus-
cle,
and
4
sites
in
the
intertie
muscle,
as
described
previously [14].
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was safety for 52 weeks after cell ther-
apy. Safety was evaluated by adverse events, the severity of
which was graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common
Terminology
Criteria
for
Adverse
Events
(ver-
sion 3.0).
The secondary endpoint was efficacy, including the follow-
ing parameters: (a) AFS; (b) rate of improvement from CLI
stage to non-CLI stage assessed by Fontaine stage and Ruther-
ford category; (c) major and minor amputations; (d) death due
to CLI; (e) all-cause death; (f ) cardiovascular event-free sur-
vival; (g) changes in ulcer size, pain score, total walking dis-
tance, and pain-free walking distance by the 6 minutes’
walking test, and physiological tests including ankle brachial
pressure index (ABI), toe-brachial pressure index (TBI; Form
PWV/ABI: Omron Colin, San Antonio, TX, USA), skin perfusion
pressure (SPP; S3000; Kaneka, Tokyo, Japan), and transcutane-
ous partial oxygen pressure (TcPO2; PO-850; Sumitomo Electric
System Solutions, Tokyo, Japan); and (h) efficiency of Clini-
MACS, including purity, viability, and recovery of CD34+ cells.
If the number of transplanted CD34+ cells per limb was over
5 × 104 per kilogram, both safety and efficacy were evaluated.
When the number of transplanted CD34+ cells per limb was
below 5 × 104 per kilogram, only safety evaluation was per-
formed,
and
the
patients
were
excluded
from
efficacy
evaluation.
Evaluation of Parameters
Rest pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS).
Ulcers were evaluated by the maximum length and depth of
the ulcer. Walking distance was evaluated using 6-minute
walking tests for determination of the absolute and initial clau-
dication
distance.
Regarding
microcirculatory
impairment
besides ABI, TBI, SPP, and TcPO2 were evaluated using Form
PWV/ABI
(Omron
Colin),
S3000
(Kaneka),
and
PO-850
(Sumitomo
Electric
System
Solutions)
as
previously
described [14].
Data Management and Statistical Analysis
Data were managed at an independent data center of the TRI.
Following data input, data cleaning, and logic check were per-
formed to guarantee the data quality.

CD34+ Cell Transplantation for HD Patients with CLI
 We presented categorical data as numbers (percentage)
and continuous data as means (�SD). Wilcoxon rank sum tests
were used for analysis of paired data (WBC count and CD34+
cell count between baseline and day 5 after G-CSF treatment).
Analysis of mean response over time was conducted using a
mixed effects model for repeated measures. AFS and cardio-
vascular event-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan–
Meier method. All tests were two-sided, and p values of less
than .05 were considered significant. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA).
RESULTS
Patients
Six patients undergoing HD and seven legs with CLI were
enrolled in the article from January 2015 to February 2016.
All patients were men and five had diabetes mellitus. The
cause of renal failure was diabetic kidney disease in four
patients and nephrosclerosis in two patients. Although ische-
mic heart disease was frequently observed (83.3%), left ven-
tricular ejection fraction was preserved in these patients
(Table 1).
Two patients with Rutherford category 4 (Fontaine stage
3) and four patients with Rutherford category 5 (Fontaine
stage 4) underwent cell therapy (Table 2). Cell therapy was
performed in the right leg in cases 1–5. Case 6 had ulcer
lesions in bilateral legs, and cell therapy was performed in
bilateral legs. As shown in Table 2, VAS ranged from 2 to
7, and ulcer size ranged from 5 to 35 mm.
Outcomes of Mobilization, Harvesting, and Isolation of
CD34+ Cells
Injection with G-CSF (5 μg/kg) for 5 days significantly increased
WBC count and CD34+ cell count in the PB from 5,700 � 710
per microliter at baseline to 26,480 � 4,614 per microliter and
from 0.37 � 0.14 per microliter at baseline to 2.80 � 1.36 per
microliter at day 5, respectively (Fig. 1). CD34+ cell count at
baseline in patients with diabetes did not differ from that in a
patient without diabetes. CD34+ cell count increased 7.6-fold
in total following G-CSF administration. The CD34+ cell count
in the PB increased 5.6 � 2.6-fold in diabetic patients and
9.9-fold in nondiabetic patient following G-CSF administration
(not statistically significant).
Cell products (apheresis products and magnetic sorting
products) are shown in Table 2. The total MNC count and
CD34+ cell counts obtained by apheresis on day 5 were

 2.6 � 0.24 × 1010 and 4.4 � 2.0 × 107, respectively. The CD34+
cell count after magnetic sorting was 2.5 � 3.1 × 107 with a
purity of 51.2% � 9.3% and viability of 93.5% � 1.9%. Finally,
magnetically sorted cells (8.4 � 5.4 × 105 per kilogram) were
transplanted into the ischemic limb. The transplanted cell num-
ber varied from 0.72 to 39 × 105/kg per limb. Cases 6 and
3 underwent minimum and maximum cell transplantation,
respectively (Table 2).
Safety Evaluation
Adverse events during the 52-week follow-up after cell therapy
are listed in Table . Angina pectoris, inguinal hernia, pneumo-
nia, brain contusion, and skin ulcers due to worsening of arte-
rial stenosis were serious adverse events for which in-hospital
treatment was necessary. However, none of these events were
thought to directly relate to cell therapy. Nonserious adverse
events, including constipation, colitis, neck pain, and fever due
to G-CSF injection, were found during the study period. Dia-
betic retinopathy was found in three patients at baseline, all
of whom had the A3/A3 non-proliferative stage according to
the New Fukuda Classification. In these patients, case 6 showed
mild vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye 5 months after cell
transplantation.
The
hemorrhage
subsided
spontaneously
without any treatment thereafter.
Efficacy Evaluation
All patients survived for 1 year without major or minor ampu-
tation. Thus, the 1-year AFS rate was 100%. Cardiovascular
event-free survival was 83.3% at 24 weeks and 66.7% at
52 weeks (Fig. 2). The improvement rate from CLI stage to
non-CLI stage at 52 weeks after cell transplantation was 83.3%
(five of six patients).
Both rest pain and intractable ulcers dramatically improved
as early as 4 weeks after cell transplantation, and these effects
continued with further improvement during the observation
period (Fig. 3). Three out of five ulcers completely healed within
12 weeks after cell transplantation, and rest pain in two patients
with Rutherford category 4 completely disappeared. As a result,
the category of clinical severity significantly improved following
cell therapy. Both Fontaine stage and Rutherford category signif-
icantly improved at 24 weeks after cell transplantation com-
pared with those at baseline (p < .05), and further improvement
was observed at 52 weeks after cell transplantation (p < .01;
Fig. 3). Clinical severity did not improve only in one patient
(case 6 receiving the minimum dose of CD34+ cells to bilateral
legs). Ulcer size in case 6 once improved at 12 weeks after cell
therapy (from 20 to 6 mm in the right leg and from 35 to
20 mm in the left leg). However, these ulcers did not heal at
52 weeks after cell therapy.
Improvement of clinical severity was accompanied by
improvement in walking distance and microcirculation of ische-
mic limbs (Fig. 4). Absolute claudication distance significantly
improved from 243.0 � 51.4 m at baseline to 299.1 � 51.9 m
at 12 weeks (p < .05). Initial claudication distance also showed a
tendency to improve from 89.5 � 80.8 m at baseline to
304.1 � 65.8 m at 24 weeks, although this change was not sta-
tistically significant. Mean dorsal SPP increased above 40 mmHg
at 4 weeks (50.0 � 7.0 mmHg), and remained above 40 mmHg

CD34+ Cell Transplantation for HD Patients with CLI
 until 52 weeks after cell transplantation. Toe SPP significantly
increased from 27.3 � 6.2 mmHg at baseline to 49.3 � 6.2 mmHg
at 52 weeks after cell transplantation (p = .024). TBI also
increased from 0.51 � 0.22 at baseline to 0.90 � 0.25 at
52 weeks, although this change was not statistically significant
(p = .25). ABI and TcPO2 did not show significant changes during
the observational period.
Whether the existence of diabetes affected the efficacy of
this cell therapy was not clearly evaluated because of the
small sample size of this study.
DISCUSSION
Although this was a small study, we demonstrated that G-CSF-
mobilized CD34+ cell therapy was safe and dramatically
improved CLI in HD patients. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report evaluating the effects of autologous
CD34+ cell transplantation for patients with CLI undergoing HD
as prespecified manner for HD patients. In consideration of
the poor limb salvage rate after revascularization therapy and
poor prognosis in patients with CLI undergoing HD, this result
may encourage novel cell-based therapy for patients with CLI
requiring HD.
The number of CD34+ cells in the PB is usually signifi-
cantly decreased in patients undergoing HD compared with
that in patients not undergoing HD [27, 28] and is correlated
with poor cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in
patients undergoing HD [29, 30]. The chronic uremic milieu
injures BM hematopoietic function in patients undergoing
HD. Furthermore, several inflammatory cytokines suppress
BM function to produce hematopoietic stem cells in patients
with CLI [31]. Therefore, patients with CLI undergoing HD
may be considered a severely affected population with “BM
failure”
or
“BM
exhaustion.”

(NO) production in patients with HD [32] may further
decrease the mobilizing capacity of CD34+ cells to peripheral
circulation, because NO is one of the strongest stimuli for
CD34+ cell mobilization [33]. However, G-CSF administration
augmented the mobilization of CD34+ cells, which have
important functions in vascular repair, in patients undergoing
HD. The potential of CD34+ cells for vasculogenesis in
patients with CLI is reported to be weak compared with
those in patients without CLI [31]. However, autologous CD34
+ cells in patients with CLI undergoing HD also showed signif-
icant potential for repairing severely ischemic intractable
wounds. Diabetes did not influence on the efficacy of this cell
therapy, and this cell therapy was significantly effective in
diabetic patients with CLI undergoing HD as well.
PBMNC transplantation did not improve CLI in patients
undergoing HD. Horie et al. [15] reported unsatisfactory results
by transplantation of crude PBMNCs for patients with CLI
undergoing HD. While their study provided good results in
patients with PAD not undergoing HD, the 1-year AFS rate after
PBMNC transplantation was as high as 60% in patients with CLI
undergoing HD. Furthermore, other reports of transplantation
of BMMNCs [13] or PBMNCs [16] for patients with CLI undergo-
ing HD have also shown poor clinical outcomes (overall survival
and AFS). The 1-year AFS rate was 52% following BMMNC trans-
plantation and 46% following PBMNC transplantation. A pooled
analysis of these two studies revealed no differences in overall
survival rates and AFS rates between BMMNCs and PBMNCs
[17]. Unselected total MNCs contain several cell types, including
inflammatory macrophages and fibroblasts, and worsened car-
diac fibrosis has also been observed [34].
This study used a monoclonal antibody-labeled magnetic
sorting technique and found that the purity of CD34+ cells after
the magnetic sorting in patients undergoing HD was not supe-
rior, but was instead inferior, to that in patients without HD in a
previous report (92.7% � 16.4%) [14]. In our study, flow cyto-
metry analysis of the cell population after magnetic sorting
revealed significant amounts of cell aggregations, with platelets
and/or cell debris with monocytes. We have previously
reported that platelet/monocyte aggregation is enhanced in
patients undergoing HD [35]. This phenomenon may explain
the decreased CD34+ cell purity in patients with CLI undergoing
HD. Another possible reason for the low purity may be the dra-
matically reduced concentration of CD34+ cells in PBMNCs in
patients undergoing HD.
Ulcer size and transplanted cell number may be an impor-
tant factor predicting improvements in CLI [17]. Ulcers measur-
ing 35 and 20 mm in diameter in case 6 did not heal after cell

 transplantation of 0.72 × 105 CD34+ cells per kilogram for
each limb, which was the lowest cell dose used in this study.
In contrast, ulcers measuring 22 mm in case 4 and 15 mm in
case 2 completely healed following cell transplantation of
13.3 × 105, and 0.95 × 105 CD34+ cells per kilogram per limb,
respectively. These results suggested that more cells might be
beneficial.
The small sample size and lack of control arm were major
limitations in this study. However, this prospective interventional
phase II study provided encouraging findings. Patients with CLI

CD34+ Cell Transplantation for HD Patients with CLI
 requiring HD showed improvement following autologous CD34+
cell transplantation. The AFS was 100%, and the CLI-free ratio
was 83.3% 1 year after cell therapy.
CONCLUSION
Autologous G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cell transplantation cell was
safe, feasible, and effective in patients with CLI undergoing
HD. Long-term observation and larger-scale clinical studies are
urgently needed to further confirm the potential benefits of
this cell-based therapy, particularly for patients with life-
threatening CLI who require HD.
