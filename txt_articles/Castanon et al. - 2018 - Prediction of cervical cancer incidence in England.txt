Prediction of cervical cancer incidence in England, UK, up to 
2040, under four scenarios: a modelling study
Alejandra Castanon, Rebecca Landy, Francesca Pesola, Peter Windridge, Peter Sasieni
Summary
Background In the next 25 years, the epidemiology of cervical cancer in England, UK, will change: human 
papillomavirus (HPV) screening will be the primary test for cervical cancer. Additionally, the proportion of women 
screened regularly is decreasing and women who received the HPV vaccine are due to attend screening for the first 
time. Therefore, we aimed to estimate how vaccination against HPV, changes to the screening test, and falling 
screening coverage will affect cervical cancer incidence in England up to 2040.
Methods We did a data modelling study that combined results from population modelling of incidence trends, 
observable data from the individual level with use of a generalised linear model, and microsimulation of unobservable 
disease states. We estimated age-specific absolute risks of cervical cancer in the absence of screening (derived from 
individual level data). We used an age period cohort model to estimate birth cohort effects. We multiplied the absolute 
risks by the age cohort effects to provide absolute risks of cervical cancer for unscreened women in different birth 
cohorts. We obtained relative risks (RRs) of cervical cancer by screening history (never screened, regularly screened, 
or lapsed attender) using data from a population-based case-control study for unvaccinated women, and using a 
microsimulation model for vaccinated women. RRs of primary HPV screening were relative to cytology. We used the 
proportion of women in each 5-year age group (25–29 years to 75–79 years) and 5-year period (2016–20 to 2036–40) 
who have a combination of screening and vaccination history, and weighted to estimate the population incidence. The 
primary outcome was the number of cases and rates per 100 000 women under four scenarios: no changes to current 
screening coverage or vaccine uptake and HPV primary testing from 2019 (status quo), changing the year in which 
HPV primary testing is introduced, introduction of the nine-valent vaccine, and changes to cervical screening 
coverage.
Findings The status quo scenario estimated that the peak age of cancer diagnosis will shift from the ages of 25–29 years 
in 2011–15 to 55–59 years in 2036–40. Unvaccinated women born between 1975 and 1990 were predicted to have a 
relatively high risk of cervical cancer throughout their lives. Introduction of primary HPV screening from 2019 could 
reduce age-standardised rates of cervical cancer at ages 25–64 years by 19%, from 15·1 in 2016 to 12·2 per 
100 000 women as soon as 2028. Vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18 (HPV 16/18) could see cervical cancer rates 
in women aged 25–29 years decrease by 55% (from 20·9 in 2011–15 to 9·5 per 100 000 women by 2036–40), and 
introduction of nine-valent vaccination from 2019 compared with continuing vaccination against HPV 16/18 will 
reduce rates by a further 36% (from 9·5 to 6·1 per 100 000 women) by 2036–40. Women born before 1991 will not 
benefit directly from vaccination; therefore, despite vaccination and primary HPV screening with current screening 
coverage, European age-standardised rates of cervical cancer at ages 25–79 years will decrease by only 10% (from 
12·8 in 2011–15 to 11·5 per 100 000 women in 2036–40). If screening coverage fell to 50%, European age-standardised 
rates could increase by 27% (from 12·8 to 16·3 per 100 000 by 2036–40).
Interpretation Going forward, focus should be placed on scenarios that offer less intensive screening for vaccinated 
women and more on increasing coverage and incorporation of new technologies to enhance current cervical screening 
among unvaccinated women.

Introduction
The epidemiology of cervical cancer in high-income 
countries is changing. In England, UK, women 
vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) in 
2008 at age 17 years have been invited to screening for 
the first time in 2016–17
. Furthermore, the cervical 
screening pro 
gramme is preparing for the introduction 
of HPV testing as the primary screening test.1 So, not 
only will cohorts of women entering the screening 
programme have a lower risk of cervical cancer, but the 
sensitivity of the screening test to precancer will be 
increased. Additionally, the European Commission has 
in April, 2016, granted marketing authorisation for two-
dose Gardasil nine vaccination (ie, the nine-valent 
vaccine), which protects against HPV types that cause 
about 90% of cervical cancers compared with the current

bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines that protect against 
about 70% of cervical cancers.2
Organised cervical screening was introduced in 
England in 1988 to women aged 20–64 years. Since 2003, 
cytology-based screening is offered once every 3 years to 
women aged 25–49 years and once every 5 years to 
women aged 50–64 years. HPV bivalent vaccination was 
introduced in 2008 as a school-based programme to girls 
aged 12–13 years, although a catch-up cohort of women 
aged 14–18 years were also offered the vaccine.
In the next 25 years, women aged 50 years and older 
will not benefit from prophylactic vaccination, and with 
screening ceasing by age 64 years for women with 
negative results, one might expect the burden of 
cervical cancer to once again move towards older age 
groups. Furthermore, population projections for the 
UK estimate a substantial increase in the number of 
women older than 60 years: a 29% increase (from 
9·4 million in 2012 to 12·1 million in 2037) in the 
number of women aged 60–74 years and a 90% increase 
in those older than 75 years (from 5 million to 
9·5 million).3
Because the aim of the cervical screening programme 
is to prevent the development of cancer by identifying 
and treating precancerous disease, age-specific incidence 
estimates (rates and numbers of cases) of cervical cancer 
for the next 25 years will help policy makers and local 
commissioning groups to adequately determine where 
the demand on preventive services will be.
In this study, we aimed to estimate the age-specific 
incidence of cervical cancer in England over the next 
25 years from 2015 to 2040 in four policy scenarios: no 
changes to current screening coverage or vaccine uptake 
and HPV primary testing from 2019 (ie, the status quo), 
changing the year in which HPV primary testing is 
introduced, introduction of the nine-valent vaccine, and 
changes to cervical screening coverage.
Methods
Model design
We did a data modelling study that combined results from 
three levels: population modelling of incidence trends 
(level 1), observable data from the individual level with use 
of a generalised linear model (level 2), and unobservable 
disease states modelled through a microsimulation 
(level 3). We chose this approach because the 
microsimulation model focuses on a single cohort of 
women progressing from age 12 years to 80 years. Hence, 
we needed age-specific cohort effects to model rates in the 
future. Additionally, where possible, we used individual 
level data because it is more accurate and requires fewer 
assumptions than microsimulation data. The appendix 
(p 1) summarises how the different components of the 
model were brought together. Our model software is 
available from the corresponding author, so that those 
interested can consider other scenarios.
We started by estimating the risk of cervical cancer in 
the absence of screening on the basis of women’s 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed with the search terms “cancer screening” 
AND “projections” OR “cancer prevention” AND “projections” 
to identify studies with a similar study design, which would 
provide evidence for time trends that took into account cancer 
prevention activities. We did not use date or language 
restrictions. We noted that age period cohort models have been 
used to estimate the effect of screening by assuming that 
period effects reflect the impact of screening. However, such 
models cannot explore the effect of decreasing screening 
coverage. Dynamic transmission models consider the effects of 
human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and transmission, 
cervical screening, and HPV vaccination on cervical cancer 
incidence, and are almost always used to produce relative 
measures of effect. We are not aware of any dynamic transition 
models that allow for underlying changes in risk on the basis of 
cohort effect.
Added value of this study
Our study combined an age period cohort model (underlying 
rates of disease) with a dynamic model to estimate the 
reduction in risk of cervical cancer following screening by 
attendance status and vaccination status. It not only allowed 
for the estimation of absolute changes to incidence of cervical 
cancer, but also allowed us to vary screening coverage and 
vaccine uptake to estimate the effect on absolute rates.
In combining the three levels of modelling, this study is the first 
to explore the effect of introducing HPV testing, changes in 
screening coverage, and vaccine uptake on cervical cancer 
incidences over the next 25 years. The study provides the 
absolute impact these changes will have at a population level in 
England, UK. In particular, it highlights the need for continued 
innovation within the programme to ensure cervical cancer 
rates decrease. We project that given current coverage and 
vaccine uptake, and accounting for the introduction of HPV 
primary screening, rates of cervical cancer will see only a 
modest decrease in the next 25 years.
Implications of all the available evidence
Evidence presented in this study suggests the cervical screening 
programme will need to adapt swiftly to the changing 
epidemiology of cervical cancer. Going forward, focus should be 
placed on scenarios that offer less intensive screening for 
vaccinated women and more on increasing coverage and 
incorporating new approaches to enhance current cervical 
screening in unvaccinated women.

individual screening histories. We used data from cases 
with cervical cancer diagnosed between April, 2007, and 
March, 2012 (and women with no history of cervical 
cancer matched on age and area of residence as the 
control), from the audit of invasive cervical cancers,4 a 
case-control study nested in a cohort that included 
more than 90% of cervical cancers diagnosed in 
England along with their full screening histories. This 
study design allowed us to obtain absolute risks by 
fitting a generalised linear model using the binomial 
family and log link function for each age group and 
staging of cervical cancer (stages 1A, 1B, and 2+), 
weighted so the number of cases in the audit diagnosed 
in each year and age group matched the number of 
cases recorded in the Office for National Statistics 
(ONS) cancer registration statistics (2011–15).5 These 
estimates were multiplied by five to estimate the 5-year 
risk. This first step provided absolute risks per 
100 000 women by age for 2011–15 in the absence of 
screening and vaccination (appendix p 1).
To allow the underlying cancer incidence to vary over 
the next 25 years in the absence of vaccination and 
screening, we used a modified age period cohort 
model to fit cancer incidence data from 1971 to 
2013 (cervical cancer incidence data were provided by the 
National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service 
[request ODR_2014_335]), and extrapolated it to 2040. 
The model includes a period effect, to capture the effect 
of screening, which was set to zero for years before the 
introduction of organised screening in England in 1988. 
To estimate future incidences in the absence of screening 
(ie, a counterfactual baseline), we used the combined age 
and cohort effects only. We used these baseline rates to 
calculate age-specific cohort effects relative to the 2011–15 
cohort. Further details can be found in the appendix 
(pp 2, 3). In the second step, this model was used to 
obtain the risk for each period given age relative to 
2011–15 in a population not offered screening or 
vaccination (appendix p 1). Although the age cohort 
model could be used to provide estimates of the absolute 
risks of cervical cancer among unscreened women, we 
chose to use risks estimated from individual level data 
(from the audit), because stronger assumptions are 
required in the age cohort model. The absolute risks 
from the first step were multiplied by the cohort effects 
of the second step to provide absolute risks of cervical 
cancer for unscreened women for each 5-year period 
from 2016–20 to 2036–40.
To allow for the effect of screening in unvaccinated 
women, we used relative risks of being diagnosed with 
cervical cancer by screening history calculated from the 
audit of invasive cervical cancers4 (appendix p 1). Hence, 
the relative effect of screening is dependent on age and 
screening history, but does not depend on the underlying 
risk of the birth cohort. Screening histories were 
categorised as never screened (either no tests or tests only 
more than 15 years earlier), regularly screened (screened 
at least once every 3·5-year [5·5 years after age 50 years] 
period in the previous 15 years), and lapsed attender 
(screened within a 15-year interval but not often enough 
to be defined as regularly screened). We used data from 
the cervical screening programme statistics (2014–15)6 to 
establish the proportion of women by age group in each 
of the screening history categories. We consider this to be 
the current screening coverage by age group in England 
and consider current incidence to be the observed average 
rate reported between 2011 and 2015 (appendix p 10). 
Women are not offered cervical screening beyond age 
65 years in England. We estimated the risk of cervical 
cancer as a function of age (65–69 years, 70–74 years, and 
75–79 years) in women regularly and irregularly screened 
at age 50–64 years relative to that in those not screened in 
the same age group. The risk of cancer at age 65–79 years 
is thereby determined by the screening history between 
ages 50 and 64 years.
Unvaccinated women are screened with use of cytology 
until HPV primary screening is implemented. We have 
taken the relative effectiveness of primary HPV screening 
compared with cytology screening from previously 
published research (appendix p 1), which concluded that 
in addition to the cervical cancer already prevented by 
cytology-based screening a further 24% of currently 
observed cases can be prevented each year once HPV 
screening has been fully introduced.7 More details are 
presented in the appendix (p 4).
The introduction of HPV primary screening into the 
programme was made under four assumptions. Firstly, 
in 2019, the test will be introduced to all labora 
tories in 
England at the same time. Secondly, HPV screening will 
not prevent any additional cancers within 12 months of 
the test, and the first women to benefit are those who 
test positive for HPV but negative with use of cytology 
who will be recalled for repeat testing 12 months later. 
Thirdly, the full effect of switching to HPV primary 
screening will be observed (in terms of cancer 
prevention) at the next screening round (ie, once every 
3 years for those aged 25–49 years and once every 5 years 
for those aged 50–64 years). In any given year, 33% of 
women younger than 50 years will be invited for 
screening (20% of those aged 50–64 years); therefore, 
the full effect of the primary HPV screening roll-out will 
not be seen for 6 years in women aged 25–29 years and 
for 10 years in those aged 50–64 years (appendix p 8). 
Lastly, the introduction of primary HPV screening will 
affect women 65 years and older in the cohort who 
received HPV testing at age 60–64 years. No woman 
aged 65–69 years will be tested with HPV before 2021, 
whereas from 2026 onwards all women aged 65–69 years 
who were screened at age 60–64 years would have 
benefited from an HPV test.
The effect of screening in vaccinated women was 
estimated from a microsimulation model8 (appendix 
pp 4–7). Vaccinated women in the model are offered 
screening with use of HPV testing with a 6-year interval.

The effect of vaccination was estimated using HPV 
16/18 vaccination (ie, the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine) 
and nine-valent vaccination. Vaccination with the 
16/18 vaccine was assumed to prevent all HPV 16 and 
18 infections as well as 15% of non-HPV 16 and 
18 infections,9 corresponding to 74·5% of cervical 
cancers, whereas the nine-valent vaccine was assumed to 
prevent 90% of cervical cancers.10 The 16/18 vaccine was 
introduced in England and in the model in 2008–09 to 
girls aged 12–13 years (born from Sept 1, 1995, to 
Aug 31, 1996) and to a catch-up cohort aged 14–18 years 
(born from Sept 1, 1990, to Aug 31, 1995). Coverage 
among girls aged 12–13 years was 86%.11 The assumed 
effect of vaccination on the catch-up cohort is summarised 
in the appendix (p 8).
Changes to vaccine uptake at age 12 years cannot affect 
women aged 25–29 years until 2031. Before 2031, women 
were assumed to have a 16/18 vaccine uptake of 
86% throughout the model. For women aged 30–34 years, 
vaccine uptake was allowed to vary from 2036. No changes 
in vaccine uptake were allowed for women aged 
35–49 years, and no women older than 49 years were 
protected by vaccination by 2040.
To calculate the incidence in the population as a whole 
(appendix p 1), we used the proportion of women in each 
age category and interval who have a specific combination 
of screening and vaccination history, and apply these as 
weights to the corresponding rates of cervical cancer to 
obtain a weighted average. To calculate absolute numbers of 
cancers from the incidence, we use the ONS population 
projections for England up to 2039.12 Average 5-yearly 
population estimates can be found in the appendix (p 9). 
Current cervical cancer rates were taken as an average of 
age-specific rates between 2011 and 2015,5 using the 
estimated mid-2014 population. Rates across ages were 
standardised with use of the European standard population.13
To validate the model, we applied weights so the model 
exactly replicated observed age-specific incidence of 
cervical cancer in England between 2011 and 2015.
We coded the microsimulation model in C++ 
(version 11), and we did the age period cohort model and 
data analyses using Stata (version 13.1).

Scenarios
We explored four different policy scenarios using our 
model. The first scenario comprises no changes to 
current screening or vaccination coverage—ie, the 
so-called status quo scenario. In this scenario, age-specific 
screening coverage remains as currently observed up to 
2040. Cytology screening is offered to women until 2019 
when HPV screening is implemented. Implementation 
of HPV screening from 2019 means that a woman will 
first be offered this test between 2019 and 2023, depending 
on when she is next due to be screened. The second 
scenario considers the introduction of primary HPV 
screening. In this scenario, we compared cervical cancer 
incidences under the following scenarios: no HPV 
primary testing to assess effect of cytology only, the status 
quo (ie, primary HPV from 2019), bringing forward the 
introduction of HPV primary screening to 2017, and 
delaying the introduction until 2023. In the third scenario, 
unless otherwise stated, all assumptions remain same as 
the status quo scenario with the exception of the 
introduction of the nine-valent vaccine. Given that the 
government’s contract for the supply of the four-valent 
vaccine ends in June, 2018, we have assumed that the 
earliest the nine-valent vaccine could be introduced to 
girls aged 12–13 years will be 2019.14 The last scenario 
involves changes to cervical screening coverage. Between 
2011 and 2016, age-specific coverage decreased from 
75·7% to 72·7% for those aged 25–64 years.6 Interventions 
to increase coverage have at best had a moderate effect 
(with the exception of offering vaginal self-sampling).15 
Hence in addition to a scenario where screening coverage 
increases, we consider a decrease to show the importance 
of high population coverage. We hope that this decrease 
in coverage is not a realistic scenario, but one that it is 
important to understand the implications of.
When considering changes to screening coverage, 
it was increased or decreased from the current coverage 
at a steady rate to achieve the nominal coverage by 2031. 
The women who entered or exited the regularly screened 
group were equally split between the lapsed group and 
the never screened group. Details of how the coverage 
decreased in the scenario where screening is phased out 
completely can be found in the appendix (p 10). When 
screening coverage is increased, women who have never 
been screened become irregularly screened, and irregu-
larly screened women become regularly screened. 
Similarly, when coverage is decreased, women who were 
regularly screened become irregularly screened, and 
irregularly screened women become never screened 
(ie, no screening in the past 15 years).

between 1975 and 1990 were predicted to have a 
relatively high risk of cervical cancer throughout their 
lives. Consequently, cancers in these women will 
dominate cancer incidence over the next 30 years. By 
contrast, age-specific rates in women aged 30–34 years 
were reduced by 53% from 17·5 in 2011–15 to 8·3 per 
100 000 women by 2036–40.
Figure 2 shows the estimated reduction in European 
age-standardised 
rates 
per 
100 000 
women 
aged 
25–64 years among the scenario for which HPV primary 
screening is introduced to the English cervical screening 
programme. Provided that HPV primary screening is 
introduced by 2023, we estimated that cervical cancer 
rates at ages 25–64 years could be reduced by 
2·9 (19%) cases per 100 000 women by 2028–32 (from 
15·1 in 2016 to 12·2) by introducing this new test. In 
absolute terms, delaying the introduction of HPV primary 
screening from 2017 to 2019 resulted in 1400 extra cervical 
cancers diagnosed in women aged 25–64 years between 
2018 and 2028, because it takes 10 years for the full effect 
to be observed.
Scenarios discussed from here onwards assume primary 
HPV screening is introduced in 2019, with all women 
(aged 25–64 years) offered screening by HPV testing by 
2023. By 2021, all women aged 25–29 years will have been 
offered vaccination against HPV at age 12–13 years; 
therefore, changes to screening coverage make only a 
slight effect on cervical cancer rates in this age group. 
Cervical cancer rates per 100 000 women decreased by 
55% from 20·9 in 2011–15 to 9·5 in 2036–40 among 
women aged 25–29 years vaccinated against HPV types 16 
and 18 and by 71% from 20·9 in 2011–15 to 6·1 in 2036–40 
among those receiving the nine-valent vaccine (figure 3). 
The additional benefit of the introduction of the nine-
valent vaccine compared with continuing vaccination 
against HPV types 16 and 18 by 2036–40 was a further 
reduction of 36% in cervical cancer rates (ie, from 9·5 to 
6·1 per 100 000 women in 2036–40). In this age group, the 
biggest modifier of cervical cancer risk in the future was 
vaccine uptake. In the most extreme scenario in which 
uptake of the nine-valent vaccine decreased to 40% by 
2036–40, rates of cervical cancer were 144% higher 
(14·9 per 100 000 women) than the scenario in which 
uptake remained at 86% (6·1 per 100 000 women; figure 3).
Maintaining or increasing cervical screening coverage 
until 2025 in women aged 30–34 years will be important 
because few women will have been vaccinated before 
becoming sexually active. In fact, the effect of changes in 
coverage among this age group can be seen as early as 
2016–20 (figure 3). The additional benefit of introducing 
the nine-valent vaccine compared with continuing HPV 
16/18 vaccination by 2036–40 was a 28% reduction in 
cervical cancer rates (from 8·3 to 6·0 per 100 000 women). 
Among those vaccinated with the nine-valent vaccine 
cervical cancer rates decreased by 66% (from 17·5 to 
6·0 per 100 000 women) and by 53% in those vaccinated 
against HPV types 16 and 18 (from 17·5 to 8·3 per 
100 000 women) by 2036–40. If nine-valent vaccine uptake 
were to decrease to 40% in girls aged 12–13 years we 
would see its effect on cervical cancer incidences from 
2036 onwards with a 127% increase in rates (from 
6·0 when uptake is 86% to 13·6 per 100 000 women).

nine-valent vaccine by 2040, 24% will have received the four-valent vaccine instead.

summarised in table 1. Table 2 summarises the 
cumulative number of cancers and European age-
standardised incidences in women aged 25–79 years. 
Because cervical screening is already preventing the 
majority of cervical cancers, the effect of screening was 
most apparent in the scenarios where the coverage 
decreased. Despite vaccination and primary HPV 
screening with current screening coverage, the European 
age-standardised rates of cervical cancer at ages 
25–79 years showed only a moderate 10% decrease by 
2036–40 (from 12·8 in 2011–15 to 11·6 per 100 000 women 
in 2036–40).
Discussion
As a public health policy, HPV immunisation will deliver 
the biggest reduction in cervical cancer diagnosed. 
Provided vaccine uptake is maintained, and even without 
the introduction of the nine-valent vaccination, cervical 
cancer rates in women aged 25–34 years will decrease by 
more than 50%. Introduction of the nine-valent vaccine 
from 2019 would decrease cancer rates by a further 
36% in women aged 25–29 years and 28% in those aged 
30–34 years by 2036–40. However, in the next 25 years, 
the vaccination strategy will have no direct effect on 
women born before 1991 who were not vaccinated before 
HPV exposure. In the short term, the timeliness of the 
introduction of HPV primary screening into the screening 
programme will be the most important determinant of 
the potential reduction in the number of cervical cancers 
diagnosed among unvaccinated women. Unfortunately, 
the risk of acquiring an HPV infection that will progress 
to cancer has increased in unvaccinated individuals born 
since 1960 (data sourced from the Genitourinary Medicine 
Clinic Activity dataset and Public Health England [KC60]), 
suggesting that current screening coverage is not 
sufficient to maintain—much less reduce—cervical 
cancer incidence in the next 20 years.
Age period cohort models have been used to estimate the 
impact of screening by assuming that observed period 
effects reflect the outcome of screening.16,17 Dynamic 
transmission models18 consider the effects of HPV 
prevalence and transmission, cervical screening, and HPV 
vaccination on cervical cancer incidence. For absolute 
efficacy, they need to be carefully calibrated to each 
population but relative efficacy is largely invariant to 
calibration. The current study combined an age cohort 
model with a dynamic model to estimate the effect of

*In this scenario, screening is no longer offered from 2016 onwards; it takes several years for women who had been 
regularly screened to eventually become never screened because they must become lapsed attenders first. Hence, 
some degree of protection against cervical cancer remains in this population until 2031–35 (appendix p 10).

screening, taking into account screening attendance and 
vaccination coverage. We used population-based data to 
estimate the risk of being diagnosed with cervical cancer by 
screening attendance. This method enabled the estimation 
of absolute changes to cervical cancer incidence and 
allowed us to vary screening coverage and vaccine uptake to 
estimate absolute effect on rates. We know of no similar 
studies with cancer as an outcome, although we did identify 
a similar study with stroke as the main outcome.19 Other 
studies of cervical cancer in the UK use just one type of 
modelling; these include an economic evaluation of HPV 
vaccination,20 a dynamic model exploring the effect of HPV 
vaccination,21 and a microsimulation study considering 
screening in England following the introduction of 
nine-valent vaccination.22 None of them have estimated 
age-specific absolute risks by calendar time.
The age cohort model used to underpin this research 
was adapted to ensure that cervical cancer rates in the 
absence of screening were not predicted to increase 
substantially beyond the greatest rates observed 
historically. This constraint was particularly important 
for more recent cohorts, which have seen rates in young 
women more than double in the past 15 years. We have 
assumed, on the basis of published literature,23,24 that 
opportunistic screening had no effect on cervical cancer 
incidence before 1988. However, if screening before 
1988 did have an effect, our age period cohort model will 
have underestimated cervical cancer rates in the absence 
of screening up to 2040. This effect would mostly affect 
birth cohorts born before 1955.
It was recently estimated, using individual level 
screening history data, that in the absence of screening, 
cervical cancer incidences in England would be 2·5 times 
higher than current rates.25 The projected increases in 
incidence from the age cohort model used in our study 
suggest a similar (3·1-times) increase in rates (appendix 
pp 2, 3). Although the benefit of screening in the model 
could be overestimated because of a higher underlying 
risk of cervical cancer in women who do not attend 
screening, given the similarity between the age cohort 
estimates and those from individual level screening data, 
the magnitude of the overestimation must be small.
The model does not take into account the effect of herd 
immunity. Because of sexual mixing patterns, the 
majority of the impact of herd immunity would occur in 
women born after 1985, so its effect on overall rates will 
be small. It will be more substantial when looking at 
age-specific rates, particularly where vaccine uptake 
decreases. We also do not account for type replacement 
(eg, from HPV types 16 and 18 to HPV 59), which would 
diminish the effect of HPV 16/18 vaccination.26 
Furthermore, the model does not take into account 
changes to the effectiveness of cervical screening by 
cytology. On the one hand, with the prevalence of disease 
decreasing among vaccinated women, and less cytology 
taking place following the introduction of HPV 
screening, it is possible that the cytology workforce 
 
might become less skilled, leading to a decreased effect 
of screening. On the other hand, fewer cytoscreeners 
looking only at HPV-positive samples (in which 
high-grade precancerous lesions will be more common) 
might increase the sensitivity of cytology.
The multidisciplinary nature of the screening 
programme means that a great number of organisations 
and individuals are involved in delivering the programme, 
which has resulted in extensive piloting and planning so 
that there has been wide variation in when different 
programmes have introduced HPV testing in primary 
cervical screening. For example, Kaiser Premanente 
Northern California introduced primary HPV screening 
in combination with primary cytology in 2003.27 The 
Netherlands, Sweden, and Australia are expected to roll 
out HPV primary screening by the end of 2017
.28,29 In 
England, six pilot sites covering about 5% of the 
population have been offering primary HPV screening 
since 2013. In 2015, baseline results from the pilot sites 
confirmed that screening by HPV primary screening 
achieved a higher detection rate of CIN 2 (cervical 
squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 2) or worse than does 
cytology screening.30 National roll-out is planned for 
2019.31 The complexity of implementing any new 
intervention into a successful screening programme and 
the potential for harm has in the past led to a cautious 
reaction to change. For example, the roll-out of liquid-
based cytology took almost 5 years.32 In our model, we 
estimated that failure to introduce HPV testing nationally 
in 2017 will lead to the missed opportunity of preventing 
about 1400 cervical cancer cases between 2018 and 2028.
Increasing screening coverage in unvaccinated women 
will remain a considerable challenge for the programme. 
We have assumed that increasing coverage brings in 
never-screened women and lapsed attenders in equal 
proportions. Engagement of women who have never 
attended 
screening 
is 
substantially 
harder 
than 
convincing women who have previously engaged with the 
programme.33,34 There is concern that cervical cancer will 
become a disease of the underprivileged. Marginalised 
women are less likely to be vaccinated and have lower 
awareness of screening than those who are not marginal-
ised.35 Engagement with these women is essential.
Once HPV primary screening is fully introduced, 
screening intervals are expected to increase to at least 
5-yearly at all ages.36 The cost-effectiveness of delivering 
HPV screening once every 5 years to vaccinated women 
needs to be reassessed because there is evidence to 
suggest that one test every 10 years might be sufficient.37 
Furthermore, it seems possible that the programme will 
use new technologies, such as genotyping or DNA 
methylation testing, which will allow for individual 
risk-profiling with variable time to next screening 
invitation depending on risk. Vaccination of women 
older than 25 years has been proposed; however, the 
protection offered to these women appears to be 
considerably lower than the protection observed in

women aged 12–13 years.38 Clear screening campaign 
messages will become essential if we are to continue 
engaging women with screening.
To meet these challenges, policy makers need to ensure 
that there is a well thought-out mechanism to introduce 
change into the screening programme swiftly and 
effectively without compromising quality.
