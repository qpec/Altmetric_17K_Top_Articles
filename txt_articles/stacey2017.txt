Background
Decision aids are interventions that support patients by making their decisions explicit, providing information about options and
associated benefits/harms, and helping clarify congruence between decisions and personal values.
Objectives
To assess the effects of decision aids in people facing treatment or screening decisions.
Search methods
Updated search (2012 to April 2015) in CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; and grey literature; includes CINAHL to
September 2008.
Selection criteria
We included published randomized controlled trials comparing decision aids to usual care and/or alternative interventions. For this
update, we excluded studies comparing detailed versus simple decision aids.
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes, based on the
International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS), were attributes related to the choice made and the decision-making process.
Secondary outcomes were behavioural, health, and health system effects.
We pooled results using mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs), applying a random-effects model. We conducted a subgroup
analysis of studies that used the patient decision aid to prepare for the consultation and of those that used it in the consultation. We
used GRADE to assess the strength of the evidence.

 Main results
We included 105 studies involving 31,043 participants. This update added 18 studies and removed 28 previously included studies
comparing detailed versus simple decision aids. During the ’Risk of bias’ assessment, we rated two items (selective reporting and blinding
of participants/personnel) as mostly unclear due to inadequate reporting. Twelve of 105 studies were at high risk of bias.
With regard to the attributes of the choice made, decision aids increased participants’ knowledge (MD 13.27/100; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 11.32 to 15.23; 52 studies; N = 13,316; high-quality evidence), accuracy of risk perceptions (RR 2.10; 95% CI 1.66 to
2.66; 17 studies; N = 5096; moderate-quality evidence), and congruency between informed values and care choices (RR 2.06; 95% CI
1.46 to 2.91; 10 studies; N = 4626; low-quality evidence) compared to usual care.
Regarding attributes related to the decision-making process and compared to usual care, decision aids decreased decisional conflict
related to feeling uninformed (MD −9.28/100; 95% CI −12.20 to −6.36; 27 studies; N = 5707; high-quality evidence), indecision
about personal values (MD −8.81/100; 95% CI −11.99 to −5.63; 23 studies; N = 5068; high-quality evidence), and the proportion
of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.83; 16 studies; N = 3180; moderate-quality evidence).
Decision aids reduced the proportion of undecided participants and appeared to have a positive effect on patient-clinician communi-
cation. Moreover, those exposed to a decision aid were either equally or more satisfied with their decision, the decision-making process,
and/or the preparation for decision making compared to usual care.
Decision aids also reduced the number of people choosing major elective invasive surgery in favour of more conservative options (RR
0.86; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; 18 studies; N = 3844), but this reduction reached statistical significance only after removing the study on
prophylactic mastectomy for breast cancer gene carriers (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97; 17 studies; N = 3108). Compared to usual
care, decision aids reduced the number of people choosing prostate-specific antigen screening (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98; 10
studies; N = 3996) and increased those choosing to start new medications for diabetes (RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.56; 4 studies; N =
447). For other testing and screening choices, mostly there were no differences between decision aids and usual care.
The median effect of decision aids on length of consultation was 2.6 minutes longer (24 versus 21; 7.5% increase). The costs of the
decision aid group were lower in two studies and similar to usual care in four studies. People receiving decision aids do not appear to
differ from those receiving usual care in terms of anxiety, general health outcomes, and condition-specific health outcomes. Studies did
not report adverse events associated with the use of decision aids.
In subgroup analysis, we compared results for decision aids used in preparation for the consultation versus during the consultation,
finding similar improvements in pooled analysis for knowledge and accurate risk perception. For other outcomes, we could not conduct
formal subgroup analyses because there were too few studies in each subgroup.
Authors’ conclusions
Compared to usual care across a wide variety of decision contexts, people exposed to decision aids feel more knowledgeable, better
informed, andclearerabouttheirvalues, andtheyprobablyhave amore active role in decision making and more accurate risk perceptions.
There is growing evidence that decision aids may improve values-congruent choices. There are no adverse effects on health outcomes
or satisfaction. New for this updated is evidence indicating improved knowledge and accurate risk perceptions when decision aids are
used either within or in preparation for the consultation. Further research is needed on the effects on adherence with the chosen option,
cost-effectiveness, and use with lower literacy populations.

Decision aids to help people who are facing health treatment or screening decisions
Review question
We reviewed the effects of decision aids on people facing health treatment or screening decisions. In this update, we added 18 new
studies for a total of 105.
Background
Making a decision about the best treatment or screening option can be hard. People can use decision aids when there is more than
one option and neither is clearly better, or when options have benefits and harms that people value differently. Decision aids may be

 pamphlets, videos, or web-based tools. They state the decision, describe the options, and help people think about the options from a
personal view (e.g. how important are possible benefits and harms).

For research published up to April 2015, there were 105 studies involving 31,043 people. The decision aids focused on 50 different
decisions. The common decisions were about: surgery, screening (e.g. prostate cancer, colon cancer, prenatal), genetic testing, and
medication treatments (e.g. diabetes, atrial fibrillation).The decision aids were compared to usual care that may have included general
information or no intervention. In the 105 studies, 89 evaluated a patient decision aid used by people in preparation for the visit with
the clinician, and 16 evaluated its use during the visit with the clinician.
Key results with quality of the evidence
When people use decision aids, they improve their knowledge of the options (high-quality evidence) and feel better informed and more
clear about what matters most to them (high-quality evidence). They probably have more accurate expectations of benefits and harms
of options (moderate-quality evidence) and probably participate more in decision making (moderate-quality evidence). People who
use decision aids may achieve decisions that are consistent with their informed values (evidence is not as strong; more research could
change results). People and their clinicians were more likely to talk about the decision when using a decision aid. Decision aids have
a variable effect on the option chosen, depending on the choice being considered. Decision aids do not worsen health outcomes, and
people using them are not less satisfied. More research is needed to assess if people continue with the option they chose and also to
assess what impact decision aids have on healthcare systems.

Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions (Review)

 B A C K G R O U N D
Many health treatment and screening decisions have no single
’best’ choice. These types of decisions are considered ’preference-
sensitive’ because there is insufficient evidence about outcomes or
there is a need to trade off known benefits and harms. Clinical
Evidence analyzed 3000 treatments, classifying 50% as having in-
sufficient evidence, 24% as likely to be beneficial, 7% as requiring
trade-offs between benefits and harms, 5% as unlikely to be ben-
eficial, 3% as likely to be ineffective or harmful, and only 11% as
being clearly beneficial (Clinical Evidence 2013). Not only does
one have to take into account the strength of the evidence, but
even for the 11% of treatments that show beneficial effects for pop-
ulations, physicians need to translate the probabilistic nature of
the evidence for individual patients to help them reach a decision
based on informed values. Patient decision aids are an intervention
that can be used to present such evidence (Brouwers 2010). This
review is an update of the review last published in 2014 of the
comparisons between patient decision aids and usual care (Stacey
2014b). To provide a more focused review, we removed 28 studies
that compared detailed versus simple decision aids.
Description of the intervention
According to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards
(IPDAS) Collaboration (Elwyn 2006; IPDAS 2005a; Joseph-
Williams 2013), decision aids are evidence-based tools designed to
help patients make specific and deliberated choices among health-
care options. Patient decision aids supplement (rather than re-
place) clinicians’ counselling about options. The specific aims of
decision aids and the type of decision support they provide may
vary slightly, but in general they:
1. explicitly state the decision that needs to be considered;
2. provide evidence-based information about a health
condition, the options, associated benefits, harms, probabilities,
and scientific uncertainties;
3. help patients to recognize the values-sensitive nature of the
decision and to clarify, either implicitly or explicitly, the value
they place on the benefits and harms. (To accomplish this,
patient decision aids may describe the options in enough detail
that clients can imagine what it is like to experience the physical,
emotional, and social effects, or they may guide clients to
consider which benefits and harms are most important to them.)
Decision aids differ from usual health education materials. Deci-
sion aids make the decision being considered explicit, providing
a detailed, specific, and personalized focus on options and out-
comes for the purpose of preparing people for decision making.
In contrast, health education materials help people to understand
their diagnosis, treatment, and management in general terms, but
given their broader perspective, these materials are not focused on
decision points and thus do not necessarily help them to partici-
pate in decision making. Many decision aids are based on a con-
ceptual model or theoretical framework (Durand 2008; Mulley
1995; O’Connor 1998b; Rothert 1987).
In response to concerns about variability in the quality of patient
decision aids, the IPDAS Collaboration reached agreement on cri-
teria for judging their quality (Elwyn 2006). More than 100 re-
searchers, clinicians, patients, and policymakers from 14 coun-
tries participated. Participants addressed three domains of quality:
clinical content, development process, and evaluation of a patient
decision aid’s effectiveness. A series of background papers inform-
ing the original IPDAS criteria were updated in 2013 (IPDAS
2013). Subsequently, an international team of researchers reached
consensus on a shorter set of qualifying and certifying criteria
(Joseph-Williams 2013). Informed by IPDAS, the Washington
State Health Authority launched the first programme for certify-
ing patient decision aids in 2016 (Washington State 2016).
How the intervention might work
Decision aids can be used before, during, or after a clinical en-
counter to enable patients to become active, informed partici-
pants. Providing the patient decision aid in preparation for the
consultation allows people more time to digest the information
and be ready to discuss the decision, but this may not be feasi-
ble in some health decisions (e.g. antibiotics for upper respiratory
infections). Decision aids can also facilitate shared decision mak-
ing. Shared decision making is defined as a process through which
clinicians and patients make healthcare choices together (Charles
1997; Makoul 2006), representing the crux of people-centred care
(Weston 2001). However, the way the clinician provides infor-
mation may strongly affect people’s preferences (Hibbard 1997),
prompting the need for standardized information such as patient
decision aids. Patients who are more active in making decisions
about their health have better health outcomes and healthcare ex-
periences (Hibbard 2013; Kiesler 2006). In summary, patient de-
cision aids may help clinicians and patients come to quality de-
cisions, grounded in patients’ values and taking into account the
potential trade-offs in benefits and risks of different options.
Why it is important to do this review
Given the broad range of stakeholders interested in patient deci-
sion aids and the rapidly expanding field of research, there was a
need to update this review to identify studies on new decisions
or conducted in new countries and to strengthen the synthesized
evidence supporting use of patient decision aids for outcomes that
do not yet have high-quality evidence. In fact, the 2014 publica-
tion was the most cited Cochrane Review in 2015 based on 1888
reviews published in 2013 and 2014. With growing development
of patient decision aids for use in the consultation, we wanted
to conduct a subgroup analysis of patient decision aids used in
preparation for versus within the consultation.

 Results from previous reviews were used to inform clinical practice
guidelines such as Patient Experience in Adult NHS Services (
NCGC/NICE2012)andDecisionSupportforAdultsLiving with
Chronic Kidney Disease (RNAO 2009). Subgroup analyses of
includedstudieshave focusedonanxiety(Bekker 2003), adherence
(Trenaman 2016), values congruence (Munro 2016), participant
trial identity (Brown 2015), and heterogeneity (Gentles 2013).
Other systematic reviews have been conducted on the use of pa-
tient decision aids as one type of intervention to facilitate shared
decision making in clinical practice (Coyne 2013; Duncan 2010;
Elwyn 2013; Legare 2010; Legare 2014).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included all published studies that used a randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) design evaluating patient decision aids.
Types of participants
We included studies involving adults aged 18 years or older who
were making decisions about screening or treatment options for
themselves, a child, or an incapacitated significant other. We ex-
cluded studies in which participants were making hypothetical
choices.
Types of interventions
We included studies that evaluated a patient decision aid as part
of the intervention. Decision aids were defined as interventions
designed to help people make specific and deliberated choices
among options (including the status quo), by making the deci-
sion explicit and by providing (at the minimum) information on
the options and outcomes relevant to a person’s health status as
well as implicit methods to clarify values. The aid also may have
included: information on the disease/condition; costs associated
with options; probabilities of outcomes tailored to personal health
risk factors; an explicit values clarification exercise; information
on others’ opinions; a personalized recommendation on the basis
of clinical characteristics and expressed preferences; and guidance
or coaching in the steps of making and communicating decisions
with others.
We excluded studies if interventions focused on: decisions about
lifestyle changes, clinical trial entry, or general advance directives
(e.g. do not resuscitate); education programmes not geared to a
specific decision; and interventions designed to promote adher-
ence or elicit informed consent regarding a recommended option.
We also excluded studies when the relevant decision aid(s) were not
available to us and not adequately described in the article(s), be-
cause we could not determine the aids’ characteristics and whether
or not they met the minimum criteria to qualify as patient decision
aids.
Types of comparisons
We included studies that compared patients exposed to a patient
decision aid to patients in comparison groups that were exposed to
usual care, general information, clinical practice guideline, placebo
intervention, or no intervention. For the purposes of this review,
we refer to all such control comparisons as ’usual care’.
We excluded studies that compared two different types of patient
decision aids.
Types of outcome measures
To ascertain whether the decision aids achieved their objectives, we
examined a broad range of outcomes. Although the decision aids
focused on diverse clinical decisions, many had similar objectives
such as improving knowledge scores, the accuracy of risk percep-
tions, and participation in decision making. Many of these eval-
uation criteria mapped onto the International Patient Decision
Aids Standards (IPDAS) criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of
decision aids (Elwyn 2006; IPDAS 2005b; Sepucha 2013). The
IPDAS criteria were attributes related to the choice (e.g. match
between the chosen option and the features that matter most to the
informed patient) and to the decision-making process (e.g. helps
patients to recognize that a decision needs to be made; know the
options and their features; understand that values affect the deci-
sion; be clear about the features that matter most; discuss values
with their clinician; and become involved in their preferred ways).
A complete list of outcomes, specified in advance of the review,
included primary and secondary outcomes.
Primary outcomes
Evaluation criteria that map onto the IPDAS criteria
• Attributes of the choice made: does the patient decision aid
improve the match between the chosen option and the features
that matter most to the informed patient (demonstrated by
outcomes such as knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, values-
choice congruence)?

 • Attributes of the decision-making process: does the patient
decision aid help patients to recognize that a decision needs to be
made, feel informed about the options and their features, be
clear about the option features that matter most, discuss values
with their clinician, and become involved in decision making?
Other decision-making process variables
• Decisional conflict
• Patient-clinician communication
• Participation in decision making
• Proportion undecided
• Satisfaction with the choice, with the process of decision
making, and with the preparation for decision making
Secondary outcomes
Behaviour
• Choice (the actual choice implemented; if not reported, the
participants’ preferred option was used as a surrogate measure)
• Adherence to chosen option
Health outcomes
• Health status and quality of life (generic and condition-
specific)
• Anxiety, depression, emotional distress, regret, confidence
Healthcare system
• Costs, cost-effectiveness
• Consultation length
• Litigation rates
Search methods for identification of studies
Our search strategy for the review included:
1. searching electronic medical and social science databases;
and
2. searching other resources.
Electronic searches
For this update, we used the same search strategy that was revised
by the Trials Search Coordinator at the Cochrane Consumers and
Communication Group in the last update (Stacey 2014b).
Therefore, the cumulative search of electronic databases is as fol-
lows.
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library (searched
to 24 April 2015).
• MEDLINE Ovid (1966 to 24 April 2015).
• Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 April 2015).
• PsycINFO Ovid (1806 to 24 April 2015).
• CINAHL Ovid (1982 to September 2008), then in Ebsco
(to 24 April 2015).
We present the search strategies in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.
Searching other resources
On 18 December 2015 we also searched trial registries (World
Health Organization, ClinicalTrials.gov), the Internet using
Google and Google Scholar, and the Decision Aid Library Inven-
tory (decisionaid.ohri.ca). Finally, reference lists of all newly in-
cluded trials were searched.
Data collection and analysis
For this current update, we focused only on new publications
that had appeared since the previous publication (Stacey 2014b),
and we limited the inclusion to patient decision aids versus usual
care. As such, we removed studies from the previous reviews that
compared detailed versus simple patient decision aids to provide
a more focused review.
Selection of studies
Pairs of eight review authors (CB, DS, RT, MB, MHR, KE, NC,
DR) screened all identified citations. We retrieved the full text of
any papers identified as potentially relevant by at least one au-
thor, listing all papers excluded from the review at this stage, with
reasons, in the ’Characteristics of excluded studies’ table. We also
provided citation details and any available information about on-
going studies, and we collated and reported details of additional
publications, so that each study (rather than each report) was the
unit of interest. We report the screening and selection process in
Figure 1.

 Data extraction and management
Two research assistants extracted data independently (KL, IS). We
compared findings and resolved inconsistencies through discus-
sion with the principal investigator (DS) and, when necessary, with
a co-author (CB). No review authors extracted data for their own
studies in this update nor in any other versions of this review.
One review author entered all extracted data into Review Manager
5 (RevMan 5), and a second one worked independently to check
for accuracy against the data extraction sheets (RevMan 2014).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two research assistants independently appraised studies using the
Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool (current update: KL, IS) (Higgins
2011, Chapter 8). We judged each item as conferring high, low,
or unclear risk of bias as set out in the criteria provided by Higgins
2011, and we provided a quote from the study report and a justi-
fication for our judgement for each item in the ’Risk of bias’ table.
For the item on ’other’ potential sources of bias, the assessment in-
cluded: whether the same clinician provided consultation to both
the intervention and usual care groups with measures taken post-
consultation, whether clustering was accounted for in the analysis;
and potential sources of bias reported by the authors in the study
limitations.
We resolved inconsistencies by discussion with the principal in-
vestigator (DS) and, when necessary, with a co-author (CB). No
review authors appraised risk of bias for their own studies in this
update nor in any other versions of this review.
Studies were deemed to be at the highest risk of bias if they were
scored as at high risk on any of the items of the risk of bias tool
(Higgins 2011).
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous outcomes, we analyzed data based on the num-
ber of events and the number of people assessed in the interven-
tion and comparison groups. We will use these to calculate the
risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous
measures, we analyzed data based on the mean, standard deviation
(SD) and number of people assessed for both the intervention and
comparison groups to calculate mean difference (MD) and 95%
CI.
First, we described study characteristics individually. The a pri-
ori comparison was usual care versus decision aids. For studies in
which there were more than one intervention group, we extracted
data from the groups that provided the strongest contrast between
the intervention and control groups. We pooled results across stud-
ies in cases where investigators used similar outcome measures and
the effects were expected to be independent of the type of deci-
sion studied. For example, we expected decision aids to improve
knowledge and create accurate percetions of options, benefits, and
harms; to reduce decisional conflict; and to enhance active partic-
ipation in decision making. Therefore, we pooled data from in-
cluded RCTs for these outcomes if trials used comparable mea-
sures. To facilitate pooling of data for some outcomes (e.g. knowl-
edge, decisional conflict), we standardized the scores to range from
0 to 100 points. When analysing the effects of decision aids on
choices, we pooled outcomes on more homogeneous subgroups
of decisions (choice of major surgery versus conservative options;
screening test or not, etc.).
Unit of analysis issues
We checked for unit-of-analysis errors. Where we found errors
and sufficient information was available, we re-analyzed the data
using the appropriate unit of analysis by taking account of the
intracluster correlation (ICC). We obtained estimates of the ICC
by contacting authors of included studies, or we imputed them us-
ing estimates from external sources. For two studies (Kupke 2013;
Lewis 2010), it was not possible to obtain sufficient information
to re-analyze the data, and we reported these studies as being at
high risk for ’other’ bias based on these unit-of-analysis errors. We
made no adjustments to the data based on these two studies that
were included in meta-analysis for knowledge only.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Where possible, we
conducted analysis on an intention-to-treat basis; otherwise, we
analyzed data as reported. We reported on the levels of loss to
follow-up and assessed this as a source of potential bias.
Assessment of heterogeneity
For this update and in previous versions of the review, we grouped
studies together across populations and settings. The aim was to
enable an assessment of the effectiveness of decision aids across
conditions, rather than to focus on disease-specific contexts. Given
that decision aids are a well-defined and clearly delineated type of
intervention, we decided that this approach was defensible. On
the basis of grouping studies across populations and decision aid
elements, we anticipated that there would be a substantial degree
of heterogeneity in our pooled effect estimates. However, we de-
cided that we would consider the direction of effects and variabil-
ity in these rather than variability in the size of effects, as the ma-
jor basis for our interpretation of heterogeneity. This meant that
for those pooled effect estimates where the direction of effect was
11

 consistent across studies, we did not downgrade for inconsistency,
despite some variability in the size of effects across individual stud-
ies. We did downgrade for inconsistency for one outcome: con-
gruence between the chosen option and informed values. This was
because there is no accepted gold standard measure for assessing
this outcome, and we considered that variability in measurement
by the included studies added further uncertainty about the effects
of decision aids for this outcome.
Where heterogeneity was present in pooled effect estimates, we
explored possible reasons for variability by conducting subgroup
analysis in the 2009 update (O’Connor 2009b). The post hoc
analysis included the IPDAS effectiveness criteria to explore het-
erogeneity according to the following factors: the type of decision
(treatment versus screening), the type of media of the decision aid
(video/computer versus audio booklet/pamphlet), and the possi-
bility of a ceiling effect based on usual-care scores (resulting in the
removal of studies with lower scores for knowledge and accurate
risk perception and higher scores for decisional conflict using the
subscales measuring levels of informedness and clarity of values).
We analyzed the effect of removing the biggest outlier(s) (defined
by visual inspection of forest plots). Given that the post hoc analy-
sis did not alter the findings from the 2009 update, we did not re-
conduct the post hoc analysis for the IPDAS effectiveness criteria.
Assessment of reporting biases
We used funnel plots to assess publication bias.
Data synthesis
We used RevMan 5 software to estimate a weighted intervention
effect with 95% confidence intervals (RevMan 2014). For contin-
uous measures, we used mean differences (MD); for dichotomous
outcomes, we calculated pooled relative risks (RR). We analyzed all
data with a random-effects model because of the diverse nature of
the studies being combined and then anticipated variability in the
populations and interventions of the included studies. We sum-
marized all of the results for the primary outcomes and rated the
strength of evidence using GRADE (Andrews 2013), presenting
these in a ’Summary of findings’ table (Higgins 2011).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
For this update, we conducted a subgroup analysis to compare
the effects of the intervention when used in preparation for the
consultation with the effects of those used during the consultation
to usual care.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed post hoc sensitivity analyses to examine the effect
of excluding studies of lower methodological quality. The analysis
excluded studies that were at high risk of bias for any of the cate-
gories in the ’Risk of bias’ assessment (Higgins 2011).
’Summary of findings’ table
We prepared a ’Summary of findings’ table to present the results
of meta-analysis, based on the methods described in Chapter 11
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Schünemann 2011). We presented the results of meta-analysis
for the major comparison of the review for each of the key out-
comes. We provided a source and rationale for each assumed risk
cited in the table and used the GRADE criteria to rank the quality
of the evidence for each outcome on each of the following do-
mains: risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and
publication bias. Two authors independently assessed the quality
of the evidence using the GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro) software
(GRADEpro GDT).

 studies), Spain (1 study), Sweden (1 study), the UK (16 studies),
the USA (50 studies), and Australia plus Canada (1 study). We
present study details below and in the Characteristics of included
studies table.
Unit of randomization
Ninety studies randomized individual patients, and 15 random-
ized clusters. For cluster trials, Allen 2010 randomized 12 com-
pany worksites; Fraenkel 2012, 2 groups of primary care physi-
cians; Hamann 2006, 12 inpatient psychiatric units; Kupke 2013,
49 dental students; Legare 2011, 4 family medicine group prac-
tices; Legare 2012, 12 family medicine group practices; Lewis
2010, 32 family medicine group practices; Loh 2007, 30 gen-
eral practitioners; Mathers 2012, 49 general medicine practices;
McAlister 2005, 102 primary care practices; Mullan 2009, 40 clin-
icians; Nagle 2008, 60 general practitioners; Shourie 2013, 50
general medicine practices; Weymiller 2007, 21 endocrinologists;
and Whelan 2004, 27 surgeons.
For 10 studies (Allen 2010; Legare 2011; Legare 2012; Loh
2007; Mathers 2012; Mullan 2009; Nagle 2008; Shourie 2013;
Weymiller 2007; Whelan 2004), the cluster effect was taken into
account in the published outcome data, and the meta-analysis used
published results. Although Hamann 2006 did not account for
the cluster effect in the published outcome data, the way this study
was reported did not allow us to include it in the meta-analysis,
so we did not re-analyze the data and report the study separately.
For McAlister 2005, meta-analysis was done applying the design
effect (based on the published intracluster correlation coefficient
(ICC)). For Fraenkel 2012, the authors stated that adding a ran-
dom effect for physician clusters did not contribute to better-fit-
ting regression models, and we removed it from the analysis. The
analysis by Kupke 2013 and Lewis 2010 did not account for clus-
tering.
Decision aids and comparisons
The 105 included studies evaluated decision aids that focused on
50 different decisions (Table 1). The most common decisions were
about prostate cancer screening (14 studies), colon cancer screen-
ing (10 studies), medication for diabetes (4 studies), breast cancer
genetic testing (4 studies), prenatal screening (4 studies), medi-
cation for atrial fibrillation (4 studies), and surgery (mastectomy
for breast cancer, 4 studies; hysterectomy, 3 studies; prostate can-
cer treatment, 4 studies). New decision topics added in this up-
date included surgery for prolapsed pelvic organs (1 study) and
asymptomatic aortic abdominal aneurysm (1 study); restoration
for tooth decay (1 study); measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine
for infants (1 study); treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder
(1 study); and radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer (1
study).
The decision aids used different formats and were compared to a
variety of control interventions (e.g. usual care, general informa-
tion, no intervention, guideline, placebo intervention). We noted
the nature of usual care when reported (see Characteristics of
included studies table). For this review, we have grouped control
interventions and refer to them as ’usual care’.
According to the definition of a patient decision aid, all of the
studies evaluated patient decision aids that included information
about the options and outcomes and provided at least implicit
clarification of values. Most patient decision aids included infor-
mation on the clinical problem (90.5%) as well as outcome proba-
bilities (89.5%). Fewer patient decision aids provided guidance in
the steps of decision making (65.7%), explicit methods to clarify
values (57.1%), and/or examples of others’ experiences (41.0%)
(see table Characteristics of included studies).
Excluded studies
We excluded 302 studies upon close perusal of the relevant papers
(see Characteristics of excluded studies). The reasons for exclusion
were: the study was not a randomized controlled trial; the deci-
sion was hypothetical, with participants not actually at a point of
decision making; the intervention was not focused on making a
choice; the intervention offered no decision support in the form
of a decision aid or did not provide enough information about
the decision aid; no comparison outcome data were provided; the
study did not evaluate the decision aid; the study was a protocol;
the decision aid was about clinical trial entry, lifestyle choice, or
advanced care planning; the study involved testing the presenta-
tion of the decision aid, but with no difference in the content of
the decision aid between study groups; or the study compared a
detailed versus simple decision aid.
We also identified 61 ongoing RCTs through trial registration
databases, personal contact, and published protocols in the elec-
tronic database searches (see references to Ongoing studies and
table Characteristics of ongoing studies).

 Allocation
When assessing risk of selection bias, we rated all 105 studies
as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Allocation concealment
methods prompted a rating of low or unclear risk of bias in 104
studies and high risk of bias in 1 study (Kupke 2013).
Blinding
We judged 102 studies to be at low or unclear risk of performance
and detection bias for the blinding of participants and personnel,
while 3 (2.9%) studies were at high risk of bias. High risk of
bias was due to lack of blinding of physicians to the status of
patients randomized to the patient decision aid and alternative
interventions (Auvinen 2004; Krist 2007; Man-Son-Hing 1999).
We rated the blinding of outcome assessment as leading to low or
unclear risk of bias in all 105 studies.
Incomplete outcome data
For 103 studies, aspects related to incomplete outcome data con-
ferred low or unclear risk of bias. In two (1.9%) studies (Chambers
2012; Mott 2014), there was high risk of bias due to high attrition
rates.
Selective reporting
We rated all 105 studies as being at either low risk of bias because
the protocol was registered publicly or at unclear risk of bias be-
cause we could not assess the extent or the impact of any reporting
bias.
Other potential sources of bias
Of 105 studies, we rated 98 as being at low or unclear risk of
other potential sources of bias. The other seven (6.7%) discussed
other potential risks of bias (Brazell 2014; Clancy 1988; Hamann
2006; Knops 2014; Kupke 2013; LeBlanc 2015; Lewis 2010).
We rated Brazell 2014 and LeBlanc 2015 as being at high risk
of bias given that the same physicians provided consultation to
both intervention and control groups, and measures were taken
after physician consultation. Clancy 1988 describes a potential
for selection bias because non-randomized medical residents were
added to the decision aid group, and there was a low response rate
among those offered decision aid. We rated Knops 2014 as being at
high risk of bias given that a large number of potential participants
did not participate in the study. Hamann 2006, Kupke 2013, and
Lewis 2010 did not account for clustering in their analyses.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
In addition to Summary of findings for the main comparison,
see the Data and analyses figures for pooled data and Additional
tables for outcome data that we did not pool. This section presents
the attributes of the choice made, the attributes of the decision
process, and secondary outcomes.
Primary outcomes
Attributes of the choice made: does the patient decision aid
improve the match between the chosen option and the
features that matter most to the informed patient?
The randomized controlled trials used three measures that corre-
spond to this outcome: knowledge scores, accuracy of risk percep-
tions, and congruence between the chosen option and the patient’s
values.
Knowledge
Seventy-one of the 105 studies (67.6%) assessed the effects of de-
cision aids on knowledge. The studies’ knowledge tests were based
on information contained in the decision aid. The proportion of
accurate responses was transformed to a percentage scale ranging
from 0% (no correct responses) to 100% (fully correct responses).
There is high-quality evidence that patient decision aids were more
effective than usual care (52 studies) on knowledge scores (MD
13.27, 95% CI 11.32 to 15.23; Analysis 1.1). In absolute terms
the group receiving usual care had, on average, 57 of 100 answers
correct. Those in the decision aid group scored better, with 70 of
100 answers correct on average (from 68 to 72 correct).
Nineteen additional studies presented knowledge scores that could
not be included in the pooled outcome (see Table 2). Most of these
other studies reported statistically-significantly higher knowledge
scores for those exposed to the decision aid compared to usual care.
The funnel plot for knowledge as an outcome in studies comparing
decision aid to usual care shows that these studies are at low risk
for publication bias (Figure 4).

Accurate risk perceptions (i.e. perceived probabilities of
outcomes)
Of 105 studies, 25 (23.8%) examined the effects of patient de-
cision aids on the accuracy of patients’ perceived probabilities of
outcomes (see Analysis 2.1; Table 3). We classified the accuracy of
perceived outcome probabilities according to the percentage of in-
dividuals whose judgments corresponded to the scientific evidence
about the chances of an outcome for similar people. For studies
that elicited risk perceptions using multiple items, we averaged the
proportion of accurate risk perceptions.
There is moderate-quality evidence that patient decision aids were
more effective than usual care for transmitting accurate risk per-
ceptions (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.66, 17 studies;
Analysis 2.1). This means that for every 1000 people receiving
usual care, 269 were likely to accurately interpret risk, whereas far
more people (565 people per 1000; from 447 to 716) accurately
interpreted risk after using a decision aid.
Eight studies reported results that were not amenable to pooling
(see Table 3). Fraenkel 2012; Hanson 2011; Kuppermann 2014;
Mathieu 2010; and Smith 2010 reported a statistically significant
improvement in accurate perceptions of outcomes for the decision
aid group compared to usual care, and Miller 2005 reported no ef-
fect on risk perception. In another study, Weymiller 2007 reported
participants allocated to the decision aid had a significantly more
accurate perception of their estimated cardiovascular risk without
statin therapy compared to the usual care group; this effect was
greater when the clinician used the decision aid during the con-
sultation rather than when the researcher used the decision aid in
preparation for the consultation (Pinteraction= 0.03). For the final
study by Mann E 2010, three of eight knowledge test items mea-
sured accurate risk perceptions, but results were presented for total
knowledge and not individual items.The funnel plot for accurate
risk perception as an outcome in studies comparing decision aid
to usual care shows low risk for publication bias.
Congruence between chosen option and values
Of 105 studies, 16 (15.3%) measured congruence between the
chosen options and the patients’ values. Six measured values-
choice congruence without considering knowledge (Arterburn
2011; Berry 2013; Frosch 2008a; Legare 2008a; Lerman 1997;
Vandemheen 2009). Of 10 studies that measured informed values-
choice congruence, eight used the Multi-Dimensional Measure
of Informed Choice (Bjorklund 2012; Fagerlin 2011; Mathieu
2007; Mathieu 2010; Nagle 2008; Smith 2010; Steckelberg 2011;
Trevena 2008), which assesses the extent to which the choice is

 based on relevant knowledge, is consistent with a person’s values/
attitudes, and is behaviourally implemented (Michie 2002). These
studies operationalized the measure in terms of knowledge scores
higher than the mid-point of the scale, attitude scale scores higher
thanthe mid-point, andchoice beingcongruentwith attitude.Two
other studies measured informed values-based choice: Schwalm
2012 assessed the extent to which the choice was based on knowl-
edge score ≥ 60% and a score for three values-importance ratings
that matched the choice; and Stacey 2014a assessed the extent to
which the choice was based on knowledge score ≥ 66% and mea-
sured values-choice congruence using a logistic regression model.
For the 10 studies that measured informed values-choice congru-
ence, two used preferred choice (Mathieu 2010; Trevena 2008),
and the other eight used actual choice.
There is low quality evidence that patient decision aids were more
effective than usual care for selecting an option that was congruent
with their informed values (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.91, 10
studies; Analysis 3.1). Of the 10 studies, 8 individually showed
statistically higher congruence scores for the patient decision aid
compared to usual care, and 2 showed no difference (Bjorklund
2012; Mathieu 2010). Repeating this analysis using the studies
that measured actual choice and not preferred choice revealed a
pooled RR of 2.13 (95% CI 1.44 to 3.14; 8 studies). A sub-anal-
ysis of studies using the Multi-Dimensional Measure of Informed
Choice revealed a pooled RR of 2.08 (95% CI 1.40 to 3.08, 8
studies; Analysis 3.3).
There was no difference between patient decision aid and usual
care for the six studies that measured values-choice congruence
without considering knowledge scores (Arterburn 2011; Berry
2013; Frosch 2008a; Legare 2008a; Lerman 1997; Vandemheen
2009; see Table 4). We did not pool these studies because of how
they reported results. Arterburn 2011 reported that, compared to
the control group, those exposed to the decision aid experienced a
more rapidearlyimprovementof value-choice concordance imme-
diately after exposure. Legare 2008a reported that women’s valu-
ing of the non-chemical aspect of natural health products was
positively associated with their choice of natural health products
in managing menopausal symptoms (P = 0.006). The other four
studies reported no differences between groups. However, Frosch
2008a observed that men exposed to the decision aid who chose
not to have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test rated their con-
cern about prostate cancer lower than men who requested a PSA
test, while men assigned to the usual care group provided similar
ratings of concern regardless of their PSA choice.
Attributes of the decision process: does the decision aid help
patients to recognize that a decision needs to be made,
know the options and their features, understand that values
affect the decision, be clear about the features that matter
most to them, discuss values with their clinician, and
become involved in their preferred ways?
In relation to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards
(IPDAS) decision process criteria, no studies evaluated the extent
to which patient decision aids helped participants to recognize that
a decision needed to be made or understand that values affect the
decision. Some studies measured participants’ self-reports about
feeling informed and clear about personal values. The measures
used to evaluate these criteria were two subscales of the previously
validated Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) (O’Connor 1995).
Decisional conflict
Of 105 studies, 63 (60.0%) evaluated decisional conflict using
the DCS (O’Connor 1995). The DCS is reliable, discriminates
between those who make or delay decisions, is sensitive to change,
and discriminates between different decision support interven-
tions (Morgan 2000; O’Connor 1995; O’Connor 1998b). The
scale measures the constructs of overall decisional conflict and the
particular factors contributing to uncertainty (e.g. feeling uncer-
tain, uninformed, unclear about values, and unsupported in de-
cision making). A final subscale measures perceived effective de-
cision making. The scores were standardized to range from 0 (no
decisional conflict) to 100 points (extreme decisional conflict).
Scores of 25 or lower are associated with follow-through with de-
cisions, whereas scores that exceed 38 are associated with delay
in decision making (O’Connor 1998b). When decision aids are
compared to usual care, a negative score indicates a reduction in
decisional conflict, favouring the decision aid.
Analysis 4.1.1 summarizes the decisional conflict results for the 42
studies that compared decision aids to usual care. We report on
21 studies that were not amenable to pooling in Table 5 (original
DCS), Table 6 (low literacy version), and Table 7 (SURE test
version).
The mean difference (MD) for total DCS scores was −7.22 points
out of 100, favouring the patient decision aid over usual care
groups (95% CI −9.12 to −5.31; see Analysis 4.1.1). Sixteen
studies that could not be pooled (Table 5) reported mixed results
on the original DCS. Of four studies that used the low literacy ver-
sion (Fraenkel 2012; Smith 2010; Taylor 2006; Williams 2013),
all reported statistically significant improvement (i.e. reduced) in
total (or subscale) decisional conflict scores in the decision aid
group, compared to usual care (Table 6). Stacey 2014a reported
no difference between groups using the SURE test version.
The ’feeling uninformed’ subscale of the DCS measures self-re-
ported comfort with knowledge, not actual knowledge. We elected
to consider this as a process measure and to reserve the gold stan-
dard of objective knowledge tests for assessing decision quality.
There was high-quality evidence that patient decision aids were
more effective than usual care in reducing patients’ ’feeling unin-
formed’ about options, benefits, and harms (MD −9.28, 95% CI
−12.20 to −6.36; 27 studies; Analysis 4.1.2). The funnel plot for
’feeling uninformed’ as an outcome in studies comparing decision
aid to usual care shows low risk for publication bias (Figure 5).

Unclear subscale
Patient-clinician communication
Of 105 studies, 10 (9.5%) measured the effect of decision aids on
patient-clinician communication. Of these 10 studies, 5 evaluated
a patient decision aid used primarily within the consultation with
the clinician, and 5 evaluated a patient decision aid used in prepa-
ration for the consultation.
Five studies compared the effect of usual care versus a decision aid
used within the clinical encounter (or, in Weymiller 2007, half the
decision aid participants were exposed just prior to the encounter),
evaluating the extent of shared decision making communication
by analyzing the audio recordings using the OPTION scale (Hess
2012; LeBlanc 2015; Montori 2011; Mullan 2009; Weymiller
2007). The OPTION scale measures the extent to which health-
care providers use behaviours that involve patients in decision
making (Elwyn 2005). All five studies reported statistically higher
mean OPTION scores in the patient decision aid group compared
to usual care (see Table 8).
Four of five studies reported that compared to those in the usual
care group, significantly higher proportions of participants ex-
posed to the patient decision aid in preparation for the consulta-
tion reported that they discussed the decision with their clinician
(Fraenkel 2012; Hanson 2011; Lepore 2012; Sheridan 2011; see
Table 8). The fifth study showed no between-group difference in
discussion of cardiovascular disease with the clinician (Sheridan
2006; see Table 8).
Participation in decision making
Of 105 studies, 24 (22.9%) measured the effect of decision aids
on patients’ perceived participation in decision making (Analysis
5.1; Table 9). Davison 1997 used the Control Preferences Scale
(Degner 1992). This scale uses five response statements to measure
the role in decision making: two represent an active or patient-con-
trolled role; one a shared or collaborative role; and two response
statements represent a passive or clinician-controlled role. Most
other studies used comparable response statements that could be
classified within each of the three groupings of the Control Pref-
erences Scale, except for Hamann 2006, which used the COM-
RADE instrument to measure patient perception of involvement,
and two others that used other measures of perceived involvement
(Hanson 2011; Loh 2007; see Table 9).
Using the groupings of the Control Preferences Scale, 16 of 24
studies reported on clinician-controlled decision making. Consis-
tent with the hypothesis that patient decision aids increase patient
participation in decision making, there was moderate-quality ev-
20

 idence that patient decision aids were more effective than usual
care for reducing clinician-controlled decision making (RR 0.68;
95% CI 0.55 to 0.83; Analysis 5.1.1). In this field, there is no
consensus on the hypothesized effects of decision aids on measures
of patient-controlled decision making or shared decision making.
Of 24 studies, 15 reported on participants assuming an active
(patient-controlled) role in decision making and were pooled for
analysis. Compared to usual care, decision aid use increased pa-
tient-controlled decision making (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.55;
Analysis 5.1.2). The 15 studies that reported on a shared decision-
making role showed no difference between decision aid and usual
care (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; Analysis 5.1.3).
Of eightstudiesthatcouldnotbe pooled, Allen 2010, Leighl 2011,
Rubel 2010, and Van Peperstraten 2010 reported no between-
group differences in these roles (Table 9). Three studies reported
that a statistically significant proportion of patients exposed to
the decision aid either participated (Sheridan 2011) - or at least
felt involved - in decision making (Hamann 2006; Loh 2007).
However, Hamann 2006 did not analyze results accounting for
the use of design clusters. Hanson 2011 reported that a higher
proportion described feeling involved (83% vs. 77%), but the
difference between groups was not statistically significant.
Proportion undecided
Of 105 studies, 24 (22.9%) measured the proportion of partici-
pants remaining undecided: of these, 22 studies could be pooled.
A significantly lower proportion of people remained undecided
after exposure to a decision aid (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79;
Analysis 6.1).
Kasper 2008 measured progress in decision making using a single
item ranging from ’0 = completely undecided’ to ’100 = made my
decision’. Given the difference in the measure Kasper used, these
results were not included in the meta-analysis. In this study, both
the patients exposed to a decision aid and the usual care group
progressed in their decision making, with no difference between
the groups (Table 10). Sawka 2012 reported that 10.8% in the
patient decision aid group versus 21.6% in the usual care group
reported not knowing if they preferred taking adjuvant radioactive
iodine.
Satisfaction
Nineteen included studies (18.1%) measured satisfaction as it re-
lates to the choice and the preparation for and the process of deci-
sion making. When possible, we standardized the scores to a 0 to
100 point scale, with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction.
Nineteen studies (18.1%) measured satisfaction with the choice.
Of these 19 studies, 4 reported that people exposed to the decision
aid had higher satisfaction with their choice compared to usual
care, and the other 15 reported no statistically significant differ-
ences (Chabrera 2015; Heller 2008; Laupacis 2006; Montgomery
2007; see Analysis 7.1 and Table 11). For results that used a sim-
ilar measure (Analysis 7.1), there was high satisfaction for all par-
ticipants, with a median score of 82.5% for the decision aid and
80.0% for the usual care groups.
Of 105 total studies, 11 (10.5%) measured satisfaction with the
decision, 11(10.5%)measuredsatisfactionwith the decision-mak-
ing process (see Analysis 7.6; plus Hess 2012 and Vodermaier 2009
in Table 12), 4 measured satisfaction with information provided
(LeBlanc 2015; Laupacis 2006; Montori 2011; Oakley 2006), 3
measured satisfaction with the clinician (Laupacis 2006; Miller
2005; Vodermaier 2009), and 1 measured satisfaction with par-
ticipating in decision making (Kennedy 2002). There were mixed
results, but no studies reported that those exposed to patient de-
cision aids were significantly less satisfied compared to usual care.
For results that used a similar measure of satisfaction with the de-
cision-making process (Analysis 7.4), there was high satisfaction
for all participants, with median scores of 83.8% for the decision
aid and 77.8% for the usual care groups. Although there were no
differences between participant groups in satisfaction with the in-
formation in the Montori 2011, clinicians using the decision aid
had higher satisfaction.
Three studies (2.9%) measured satisfaction with preparation for
decision making using the Preparation for Decision Making Scale
(Bennett 2010) (Table 13). Compared to usual care, two stud-
ies reported significant improvements in people’s satisfaction with
their preparation for making decisions: in Fraenkel 2007 after us-
ing decision aids about management of knee osteoarthritis, and in
Vandemheen 2009 regarding referral to a lung transplant centre.
The third study found no statistically significant difference on this
subscale’s four items (Stacey 2014a).
Secondary outcomes
Behaviour
Choice
Choice was defined as the actual choice implemented. However,
when studies did not report the actual choice, we used the patients’
preferred option as a surrogate measure. Actual choices or prefer-
ences were reported as the percentage of individuals actually im-
plementing or stating a preference for the most intensive or most
invasive option.
In summary, patient decision aids decreased the number of pa-
tients choosing elective surgical procedures (excluding prophy-
lactic mastectomy) and PSA testing in multiple studies. Single
studies showed that decision aids increased the number of people
choosing hepatitis B vaccination, psycho-educational therapies for
mental health conditions, and medication for cardiovascular dis-
ease prevention. In contrast, decision aids decreased the rate of
cardiac stress testing, the number of embryos being transplanted,

 and the rate of antibiotic use for upper respiratory infections. The
effect on patients’ choice in other situations was more variable.
There were mixed results for the choice of colon cancer screening,
genetic testing, prenatal testing, anti-thrombosis therapy, breast
screening, and diabetes medications. There was no difference be-
tween groups for choices about natural health products, hyperten-
sion therapy, breast cancer chemotherapy, schizophraenia medi-
cation, immunotherapy for multiple sclerosis, vaccines (for flu or
measles, mumps, rubella), diabetes screening, birth control, osteo-
porosis treatment, chemotherapy for advanced cancer, chemopre-
ventive medications, use of blood transfusions, childbirth proce-
dures, treatment of prolapsed pelvic organs, or radioactive iodine
treatment for thyroid cancer.
Choice for major elective surgery
Eighteen studies (17.1%) focused on choices regarding major elec-
tive surgery (Analysis 8.1).
Using intention-to-treat analysis, there was a non-significant re-
duction in the number of patients choosing major elective surgery
in the group receiving the decision aid compared to usual care (RR
0.86; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00, 18 studies; Analysis 8.1.2). Schwartz
2009a reported a statistically significant uptake of prophylactic
mastectomy for women who are BRCA1/2 gene carriers (114%).
And after removing this study from the pooled results, there was a
statistically significant reduction in the number of patients choos-
ing major elective surgery (RR 0.84 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97; 17
studies; Analysis 8.1.3).
Four other studies showed statistically significant reductions in
surgery rates: −29% for cardiac revascularization and bariatric
surgery (Arterburn 2011; Morgan 2000), −33% for orchiectomy
(Auvinen 2004), and −74% for mastectomy (Whelan 2004). The
other 15 studies showed no difference between the decision aid or
usual care groups.
Choice for other elective surgery
Two studies evaluated the effect of decision aids versus usual care
on other elective surgical decisions. Decision aids did not signifi-
cantly influence surgical abortion rates in Wong 2006 or feeding
tube insertions in Hanson 2011 (Table 14).
Choice for prostate-specific antigen screening
The effects of decision aids on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
screening decisions were variable in 13 studies (12.4%) that com-
pared decision aids to usual care. The pooled RR for 10 studies
was 0.88 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.98; Analysis 8.2.1); Frosch 2008a,
Lepore 2012, and Williams 2013 could not be included in the
pooled data (Table 14). Frosch reported a reduction in screening
rates and the other two reported no difference.
Choice for colon cancer screening
Of 10 studies (9.5%) on colon cancer screening, 3 reported sta-
tistically significant differences in choices, and 7 showed no dif-
ference. Two studies reported that compared to usual care, the
decision aid significantly increased the screening rates by 64%
and 70% (Pignone 2000; Ruffin 2007). The other study reported
a statistically significant reduction of 21% for screening (Smith
2010). There was an increase in screening rates in five studies,
by 6% to 39%, but the difference was not statistically significant
(Lewis 2010; Miller 2011; Schroy 2011; Steckelberg 2011; Wolf
2000). In two studies (Dolan 2002; Trevena 2008), there was a
73% and 4% decrease in screening rates that was not statistically
significant. The pooled RR was 1.12 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.31, 10
studies; Analysis 8.2.2).
Choice for cancer genetic screening
Four studies reported preferences or uptake rates for breast cancer
genetic screening (3.8%). The decision aid did not significantly
affect preferences for breast cancer genetic screening when com-
pared to usual care. The pooled RR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.71 to
1.38, 3 studies; Analysis 8.2.3). One study reported an increase in
screening rates by 14% (Lerman 1997), a second study reported
an increase of 18% (Green 2001), and a third study reported a de-
crease of 29% (Schwartz 2001). Miller 2005 reported that women
exposed to the decision aid who were at higher risk of breast cancer
increased their intention to obtain genetic testing, while those at
average risk decreased their intention (Table 14).
Choice for breast screening
There were lower mammography screening rates among women
aged 38 to 45 years of age (Mathieu 2010), but no between-group
difference in women aged 70 or older who were exposed to a
decision aid versus usual care (Mathieu 2007; Table 14).
Choice for prenatal screening
In all four studies focusing on decisions around prenatal screening,
prenatal testing rates were not affected by a decision aid compared
to usual care (Bekker 2004; Bjorklund 2012; Kuppermann 2014;
Nagle 2008). Meta-analysis included two studies, showing no ef-
fect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, 2 studies; Bjorklund 2012;
Kuppermann 2014; Analysis 8.2.4).

Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Choice for stress test for chest pain
Compared to usual care, adults presenting with chest pain in the
emergency department who received the decision aid had signifi-
cantly lower rates of stress testing (58% versus 77%) (Hess 2012;
Table 14).
Choice for screening for diabetes
Compared to usual care, there was no difference in diabetes screen-
ing rates in Marteau 2010 or preferences for screening in Mann E
2010 in adults exposed to a decision aid (Table 14).
Choice to take antibiotics for upper respiratory infection
Compared to usual care, using a decision aid in the consultation
decreased prescriptions for antibiotics for upper respiratory infec-
tions in Legare 2012, although this difference was not statistically
significant in Legare 2011 (Table 14).
Choice for atrial fibrillation treatment
Three studies evaluated the effect of a decision aid on the use
of anti-thrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation versus usual care
(Table 14). One study demonstrated a non-significant reduction
in warfarin use of 25% (Man-Son-Hing 1999). The second study
evaluated the proportions of patients choosing the option that was
appropriate relative to their level of risk, and found no significant
difference between the groups (McAlister 2005). Thomson 2007
reported that patients in the usual care group (guided by practice
recommendations) were much more likely to start warfarin (15/
16; 93.8%) compared to the decision aid group (4/16; 25%; RR
0.27; 95% CI: 011 to 0.63).
Choice to take breast cancer prevention medication
There was no difference in medication use among women at risk
of breast cancer who were exposed to the decision aid versus usual
care (Fagerlin 2011; Table 14).
Choice for cardiovascular disease prevention
There was an increase in patient preferences for any effective car-
diovascular disease risk-reducing strategy (including medication)
when using a decision aid versus usual care (63% versus 42%)
(Sheridan 2011; Table 14).
Choice for chemotherapy for cancer
There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of che-
motherapy for adults with advanced colorectal cancer (77% ver-
sus 71%) (Leighl 2011; Table 14). Whelan 2003 also found no
significant effect on preferences for adjuvant chemotherapy versus
no chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer.
Choice for diabetes treatment with new medications
Four studies evaluated patient decision aids compared to usual care
on decisions about starting new medications for diabetes (Mann D
2010; Mathers 2012; Mullan 2009; Weymiller 2007). Although
there was no statistically significant difference between groups for
individual studies, pooled results indicated a significant increase in
starting new medications (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.56; Analysis
8.3).
Choice to take hypertension medication
Montgomery 2003 found no significant effect for decision aids
over usual care on the initiation of medication for hypertension
(Table 14).
Choice for menopausal symptom treatment
In a study comparing a decision aid to usual care (Murray 2001b),
there was a non-significant decrease of 8% in hormone therapy
(Table 14). Preferences for natural health products in women ex-
periencing menopausal symptoms were no different for women
exposed to the decision aid compared to women exposed to the
usual education materials (Legare 2008a).
Choice for multiple sclerosis immunotherapy
Kasper 2008 reported no difference in the uptake of immunother-
apy in people with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to a deci-
sion aid compared to usual care based on practice guidelines (Table
14).
Choice to take osteoporosis treatment
There was no difference in prescriptions for bisphosphonates for
osteoporosis treatment (LeBlanc 2015; Table 14). Montori 2011
found no significant effect of decision aids over usual care on the
uptake of medication for osteoporosis treatment.

 Mental health
Hamann 2006 found no difference in prescription rates for an-
tipsychotic medications but reported a statistically significant in-
crease in the uptake in psycho-education (P = 0.003) in people
with schizophraenia exposed to the decision aid compared to usual
care (Table 14). Mott 2014 reported that a higher proportion of
participants in the decision aid group with post-traumatic stress
disorder completed psychotherapy sessions (4 of 9) compared to
usual care (1 of 11).
Obstetrical choices
Childbirth procedures
Three studies focused on childbirth issues, using a decision aid
compared to usual care. There was no difference in preference for
vaginal birth in Shorten 2005 or actual vaginal mode of delivery
in Montgomery 2007 following a previous cesarean section. An-
other study found no difference in actual choice to undergo exter-
nal cephalic version for women with breech presentation (Nassar
2007).
Birth control approaches
There was no difference in the birth control methods chosen for
those in the decision aid versus usual care groups (Langston 2010).
Embryo transplantation
Compared to usual care, those in the decision aid group were
significantlymore likelytochoose asingle embryotransplant(43%
versus 32%) (Van Peperstraten 2010).
Vaccines
Compared to usual care, there was a non-significant increase in
intentions to get the flu vaccine in those exposed to the decision
aid (46% versus 27%) (Chambers 2012), a statistically significant
increase in uptake of hepatitis B vaccination with decision aids
(Clancy 1988), and no difference in uptake of measles, mumps,
rubella vaccine in infants (Shourie 2013).
Other choices
Blood transfusions
There was no difference in the uptake of preoperative autologous
blood donation when a decision aid was compared to usual care
(Laupacis 2006).
Lung transplant referral
There was no difference in referral rates for consideration of lung
transplant in people with advanced cystic fibrosis exposed to a
decision aid versus usual care (Vandemheen 2009).
Pelvic organ prolapse treatment
There was no difference in treatment rates for prolapsed pelvic
organs (Brazell 2014).
Thyroid cancer radioactive iodine treatment
There was no difference in the rates of adjuvant radioactive iodine
treatment for thyroid cancer (Sawka 2012).
Adherence (continuance/compliance) with chosen option
Of 105 studies, 16 (15.2%) measured adherence using various
approaches (Table 15).
Based on the measurement framework by Trenaman 2016, we
grouped adherence according to adherence to the baseline choice
and adherence to the treatment. Six studies measured only adher-
ence to the baseline choice (Langston 2010; Legare 2012; Lepore
2012; Man-Son-Hing 1999; Mathers 2012; Trevena 2008), 6
studies measured only adherence to treatment (Loh 2007; Mann
D 2010; Mott 2014; Mullan 2009; Oakley 2006; Sheridan 2011),
and 4 studies measured both (LeBlanc 2015; Montgomery 2003;
Montori 2011; Weymiller 2007).
For the 10 studies that measured adherence to choice, two studies
reported that patients exposed to decision aids had higher adher-
ence compared to usual care (Mathers 2012; Montori 2011), and
8 reported no difference between groups. For example, Mathers
2012 asked participants, 6 months after their decision, whether or
not they had changed their initial choice about starting insulin for
type II diabetes (decision aid 68.1% versus 56.3% usual care; P
= 0.041). Montori used pharmacy records to determine if partici-
pants who chose bisphosphonates actually took their medication
on more than 80% of the days for which it was prescribed (100%
decision aid versus 74% usual care; P = 0.009).
For the 10 studies that measured adherence to treatment, 2 studies
reported that patients exposed to decision aids had higher adher-
ence compared to usual care (Mott 2014; Sheridan 2011), 1 study
reported that patients exposed to decision aids had lower adher-
ence (Mullan 2009), and 7 reported no difference. Mott reported
the percentage of participants at four months who engaged in nine
24

 or more psychotherapy sessions (4 of 4 decision aid group partic-
ipants versus 1 of 5 usual care). Sheridan measured the percent-
age of participants who, 3 months after initiating therapy, were
continuing (59% decision aid versus 34% usual care; P < 0.01).
Mullan used pharmacy records to determine the days covered by
medication use (97.5% decision aid versus 100% usual care).
Health outcomes
General health outcomes
Eleven studies (10.5%) compared a decision aid to usual care in
terms of general health outcomes (Table 16). Ten of these used
either the previously validated Medical Outcomes Study 36-item
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) or the 12-item Short-Form
Health Survey (SF-12) (Stewart 1992), while Vuorma 2003 used
the RAND-36 (Hays 1993). As shown in Table 16, there were no
significant differences for mental health function or social func-
tion in any of the seven studies. In one study (Barry 1997), general
health andphysical functionoutcome scoreswere significantlybet-
ter in the decision aid group compared to usual care for men con-
sidering treatments for benign prostatic disease. Of the two stud-
ies evaluating the effect of a decision aid for women considering
treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding, Kennedy 2002 found
a statistically significant improvement in role physical function,
and Vuorma 2003 found a statistically significant improvement in
emotional role functioning for women.
In two studies measuring health utilities using the Euroqol EQ-
5D (Murray 2001a; Murray 2001b), there was no difference be-
tween the decision aid and usual care groups. There was also no
between-group difference in the LeBlanc 2015 study, which used
the Euroqol 5D health thermometer.
Condition-specific health outcomes
Seven studies (6.7%) used various measures to assess condition-
specific health outcomes (Table 17). Outcomes included uri-
nary symptoms (Barry 1997; Murray 2001a), angina (Bernstein
1998), functional assessment of cancer therapy (Leighl 2011),
menopausal symptoms (Murray 2001b), and menstrual symp-
toms (Protheroe 2007; Vuorma 2003). Five studies found no sig-
nificant effects on condition-specific health outcomes (Bernstein
1998; Leighl 2011; Murray 2001a; Murray 2001b; Vuorma 2003).
Protheroe 2007 reported significantly higher menorrhagia-related
quality of life scores in women exposed to the decision aid com-
pared to usual care. Barry 1997 showed an improvement in uri-
nary symptoms in favour of the decision aid group, but it was not
statistically significant.
Other health outcomes
Seven studies (6.7%) reported on other health outcomes (Table
18), including death (Auvinen 2004; Knops 2014), glycated
haemoglobin (Mathers 2012), angina (Morgan 2000), stroke
(Thomson 2007), successful pregnancy (Van Peperstraten 2010),
and pain (Vuorma 2003). There were no statistically significant
differences between groups.
Preference-linked health outcomes
None of the 105 studies measured preference-linked health out-
comes - that is, whether the patients experienced the outcomes
they preferred and avoided the outcomes they wanted to avoid.
Anxiety
Of 105 studies, 31 (29.5%) measured anxiety, with 24 using the
previously validated State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger
1970), 2 using the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (Knops 2014; Lam 2013), 2 using questions
about worry (Fraenkel 2012; Smith 2010), 2 measuring intrusive
thoughts(Lewis 2010; McCaffery2010), and1usingasingle ques-
tion on a seven-point Likert scale (Johnson 2006; see Table 19).
Of 18 studies that used the State Trait Anxiety inventory within
1 month postintervention, 2 (11.1%) reported that the decision
aid group had significantly lower anxiety scores for people con-
sidering birthing options after a previous caesarean (Montgomery
2007) and for women considering options for the treatment of
menorrhagia (Protheroe 2007). None of the studies demonstrated
significant differences in effects on people’s state anxiety at one
month (2 studies), three months (6 studies), six months (4 stud-
ies), or one year (2 studies). There was no significant difference
between groups for the other instruments that measured anxiety.
Depression
Of 105 studies, 6 (5.7%) measured the effect of decision aids on
depression using various instruments (Table 20). None of the stud-
ies reported a statistically significant difference between groups for
decisions about cancer treatment (Davison 1997; Whelan 2004),
depression (Loh 2007), prenatal genetic testing (Nagle 2008), or
for women considering the number of embryos to transplant (Van
Peperstraten 2010). At 10 months’ postintervention, there were
lower levels of depression in women deciding about breast cancer
surgery who were exposed to the patient decision aid versus the
usual care, but no differences at 1 week, 1 month, or 4 months
postintervention (Lam 2013).
Regret
Of 105studies,7(6.7%)measuredthe effectof decisionaidsonde-
cision regret, using the five-item Decisional Regret scale (Brehaut
25
Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 2003; see Table 21). At 4 and 10 months postintervention, women
with breast cancer who were considering surgery and used a deci-
sion aid reported lower regret scores compared to women receiv-
ing usual care (Lam 2013). There was no statistically significant
between-group difference in the other six studies.
Confidence
Of 105 studies, 8 (7.8%) measured the effect of decision aids on
confidence levels (see Table 22). Four of these studies used the De-
cisional Self-efficacy Scale (Allen 2010; Arterburn 2011; Fraenkel
2007; Smith 2010). Four studies reported a statistically significant
improvement in confidence or self-efficacy with decision making
in the decision aid compared to the usual care groups (Chambers
2012; Fraenkel 2007; Gattellari 2003; McBride 2002), and the
other studies reported no difference between groups.
Healthcare system effects
Cost and resource use
Of eight studies (7.6%) examining cost and resource use, one
conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis (Kennedy 2002), five eval-
uated the effect of decision aids compared to usual care on to-
tal costs (Montgomery 2007; Murray 2001a; Murray 2001b; Van
Peperstraten 2010; Vuorma 2003), and two measured resource use
(Legare 2012; Thomson 2007) (see Table 23).
The cost-effectiveness analysis (Kennedy 2002) was conducted
from the healthcare system perspective, using USD values from
1999 to 2000 and calculating costs over two years. The decision
aid with nurse coaching demonstrated the lowest mean cost (USD
1566) compared to decision aid alone (USD 2026) or usual care
(USD 2751).
Of the five studies that evaluated total costs, two reported no statis-
tically significant difference in the patient decision aid compared
to usual care (Montgomery 2007; Vuorma 2003). Two studies re-
ported higher costs for the patient decision aid group when in-
cluding the cost of the interactive video disc equipment (USD 216
at 1999 prices) and no statistically significant difference between
groups when removing this cost (Murray 2001a; Murray 2001b).
The fifth study reported that the mean total savings in the deci-
sion aid group versus usual care was EUR 169.75 per couple (Van
Peperstraten 2010).
For healthcare resource use in upper respiratory infection, Legare
2012 reported no difference in the rates of repeat consultations
for the same reason, and Thomson 2007 reported no difference
in the rates of general clinician consultations in the three months
following the intervention. Both studies used the patient decision
aid in the consultation.
Consultation length
Of 105 studies, 10 (9.5%) evaluated the effect of a decision aid
compared to usual care on consultation length (see Table 23).
The median consultation length was 24 minutes (range 3.8 to
68.3) for patient decision aid compared to 21 minutes (range 4.2
to 65.7) for usual care. The difference was 2.6 minutes longer
(7.5% increase) than usual care consultations (range 0.4 minutes
shorter to 23 minutes longer). The length of consultation was
significantlylongerforthe patientdecisionaidgroupintwostudies
(Bekker 2004; Thomson 2007), and eight studies reported no
difference. Bekker2004 reportedthatconsultationsaboutprenatal
diagnostic testing were 5.9 minutes longer, and Thomson 2007
reported consultations about treatment for atrial fibrillation were
23 minutes longer when using a computerized decision aid with
standard gamble method within the consultation.
Litigation rates
None of the 105 studies examined the effect of decision aids on
litigation.
Adverse events
There were no adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction,
and no other adverse events reported.
Subgroup analysis - in preparation for versus during
the consultation
Of 105 studies, 89 (84.8%) primarily evaluated the patient deci-
sion aid when used by the patient in preparation for the consulta-
tion, and 16 (15.2%) primarily evaluated the patient decision aid
when used within the consultation. The patient decision aids used
during the consultation focused on prenatal screening (Bekker
2004); cardiac stress testing (Hess 2012); dental surgery (Johnson
2006); restorationof tooth decay(Kupke 2013); antibioticsforup-
per respiratory infection (Legare 2011; Legare 2012); medication
use for depression (Loh 2007), diabetes (Mann D 2010; Mullan
2009; Weymiller 2007), osteoporosis (LeBlanc 2015; Montori
2011), preventionof breastcancer(Ozanne 2007), andatrial fibril-
lation (Thomson 2007); surgery for breast cancer (Whelan 2004);
and chemotherapy for breast cancer (Whelan 2003).
Knowledge
When considered separately by subgroups, there was no differ-
ence between knowledge scores for those exposed to the decision
aid in preparation for the consultation compared to those used in
the consultation itself (Analysis 1.2: MD 13.77% versus 10.57%,
test for subgroup difference P = 0.31, I2: 3%). Weymiller 2007
reported a higher mean difference when the decision aid was ad-
ministered during the consultation but not if it was administered
26

 by research staff in preparation for the consultation. For the stud-
ies evaluating decision aids used in the consultation not included
in the pooled outcome, two showed a statistically significant im-
provement in knowledge (LeBlanc 2015; Ozanne 2007), and two
showed no difference (Mann D 2010; Thomson 2007).
Accurate risk perceptions
When analyzing pre-consultation and in-consultation decision
aids further, accurate risk perceptions were not different between
studies that used the decision aid in preparation for the consulta-
tion and those where the intervention occurred during the con-
sultation (Analysis 2.2: RR 2.25 versus RR 1.79, test for subgroup
differences: P = 0.33, I2: 0%). The only study evaluating a de-
cision aid within the consultation that was not included in the
meta-analysis, Weymiller 2007, reported a higher proportion with
accurate risk perception when the decision aid was administered
during the consultation, but found no difference between groups
when administered by research staff in preparation for the consul-
tation.
Decisional conflict uninformed subscale
Too few studies measured the uninformed subscale in those ex-
posed to decision aid within the consultation to be able to com-
pare with those who used decision aids in preparation for the
consultation. Weymiller 2007 reported that participants felt less
uninformed when the decision aid was administered during the
consultation, but not if it was administered by research staff in
preparation for the consultation.
Decisional conflict unclear values subscale
Too few studies measured the unclear values subscale in those ex-
posed to decision aid within the consultation to be able to compare
with those who used decision aids in preparation for the consul-
tation. Weymiller 2007 reported that participants felt less unclear
about values when the decision aid was administered during the
consultation, but not if it was administered by research staff in
preparation for the consultation.
Patient-clinician communication
Due to variation in the reporting of data for this outcome, we were
unable to investigate the effect of intervention timing on the vari-
ation in the effect on communication. Five studies evaluated a pa-
tient decision aid primarily used within the consultation with the
clinician, and five evaluated a patient decision aid used in prepa-
ration for the consultation (see Table 8). All five studies that used
the decision aid during consultations reported statistically higher
mean OPTION scores in the patient decision aid group compared
to usual care (Hess 2012; LeBlanc 2015; Montori 2011; Mullan
2009; Weymiller 2007). Four of five studies assessing the effects
of pre-consultation decision aid delivery (Fraenkel 2012; Hanson
2011; Lepore 2012; Sheridan 2011) reported that, compared to
those in the usual care group, significantly higher proportions of
participants exposed to the patient decision aid in preparation for
the consultation reported that they discussed the decision with
their clinician, and the fifth study showed no between-group dif-
ference (Sheridan 2006).
Participation in decision making
There were too few studies on decision aids used during the con-
sultation to interpret findings from the subgroup analysis (Analysis
5.2; Analysis 5.3).
Length of the consultation
Due to variation in the reporting of data for this outcome, we
were unable to investigate the effects of intervention timing on
the length of consultation. Of seven studies that evaluated de-
cision aids used within the consultation (Bekker 2004; LeBlanc
2015; Loh 2007; Ozanne 2007; Thomson 2007; Weymiller 2007;
Whelan 2003), two reported that the length of the consultation
was significantly longer for the patient decision aid group (Bekker
2004; Thomson 2007). There was no difference for the other
studies. The three studies that evaluated decision aids used in
preparation for the consultation reported no between group dif-
ference in the length of the consultation (Bozic 2013; Krist 2007;
Vodermaier 2009).
Other outcomes
For values-choice congruence and proportion undecided, none of
the studies of patient decision aids used during the consultation
measured these outcomes. For satisfaction, there were a range of
different approaches to measuring this outcome with mixed results
and too few studies to make any descriptive comparisons. For
choice, there were too few studies to conduct a subgroup analysis
of pooled comparisons.
Post hoc analysis
Effects of study quality
To examine the potential bias arising from including studies of low
methodological quality, we excluded 12 studies with a high risk
of bias for any of the seven risk of bias criteria from the analysis
(Auvinen 2004; Brazell 2014; Chambers 2012; Clancy 1988;
Hamann 2006; Knops 2014; Krist 2007; Kupke 2013; LeBlanc
2015; Lewis 2010; Man-Son-Hing 1999; Mott 2014; see Figure
3). Overall, the results remained the same (Table 24; Analysis 1.3;
Analysis 2.3; Analysis 3.5; Analysis 4.4).

 Heterogeneity
When comparing patient decision aids to usual care, there was
statistically significant heterogeneity in five of six of the IPDAS
effectiveness criteria: knowledge scores, accurate risk perceptions,
congruence between values and choice; feeling uninformed, and
feeling unclear regarding personal values. There was no statistically
significant heterogeneity for participation in decision making. It
should be noted that the heterogeneity of the effect was not man-
ifested in its direction but only in its size. For the 2009 update
(O’Connor 2009b), we explored the potential factors contributing
to heterogeneity (Table 25). Overall, regardless of the subgroup
analyses conducted, scores for outcomes were similar to the overall
effect, as indicated by overlapping confidence intervals.

Summary of main results
In this updated review, we added 18 new studies for a total of 105
studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care. This up-
date also removed 28 studies that compared detailed versus simple
patient decision aids that were included in the previous update.
Based on the GRADE assessment (Summary of findings for the
main comparison), there is high-quality evidence that compared
to usual care, decision aids improve people’s knowledge regarding
options and reduce the decisional conflict stemming from feel-
ing uninformed and unclear about their personal values. There is
moderate-quality evidence that decision aids stimulate people to
take a more active role in decision making and increase the accu-
racy of their risk perceptions. There is lower-quality evidence that
decision aids improve congruence between the chosen option and
personal values. This outcome is measured using a variety of differ-
ent approaches, and the evidence could be strengthened by more
standardized measurement. Moreover, decision aids decreased the
proportion of people remaining undecided.
Although not a primary outcome of the review, the effect of de-
cision aids on patients’ choosing particular options continues to
be variable. The numbers of patients choosing to have major elec-
tive surgery continues to decrease in favour of more conservative
options, except when the baseline rates are low (e.g. surgery for
benign prostate hyperplasia, prophylactic mastectomy for women
who are carriers of the BRCA gene). The numbers of men choos-
ing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing were fewer after expo-
sure to decision aids.
Decision aids do no better than usual care in terms of their effects
on people’s satisfaction with decision making or health outcomes
such as general quality of life or condition-specific quality of life.
However, no studies measured preference-linked health outcomes,
nor were adverse events reported. There was also no difference in
anxiety. For length of consultation, eight studies found no differ-
ence, while two studies found a median increase of 2.6 minutes
(7.5%) in the decision aid group compared to usual care consulta-
tions.There continue to be too few studies to determine the effects
of decision aids on costs/resource use (Trenaman 2014). Although
there may be additional costs involved in delivering decision aids,
an independent review of decision aid studies with economic out-
comes concluded that “this was likely to be small relative to the
benefit to patients in terms of improved decision quality when
effective decision aids are used” (NCGC/NICE 2012). Given the
variability in measurement strategies, it difficult to determine the
effect of patient decision aids on adherence to the chosen option
or treatment.
New for this update, we analyzed the pooled data for decision aids
used in preparation for the consultation separately from decision
aids used in the consultation, and we found that there were sim-
ilar improvements in knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and
patient-clinician communication.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Main effects of decision aids
The largest and most consistent benefits of decision aids, relative
to usual care, are better knowledge of options and outcomes, and
more accurate perceptions of outcome probabilities. These ob-
servations are clinically important because the usual care groups’
scores for knowledge and perception of outcome probabilities were
lower than the intervention groups’; both knowledge and percep-
tion of outcome probabilities are important for ensuring informed
decisionmaking.These effectssuggestthatcurrent’usual care’ may
not be good enough when informing people about these complex,
values-sensitive decisions. People need to comprehend the options
and outcome probabilities in order to consider and communicate
to their clinicians the personal value they place on the benefits ver-
sus the harms. Likewise, pooling results from additional studies in
this update shows a significant increase in informed values-based
choice when decision aids were compared to usual care, and the
results appear to be similar across subgroup analyses of studies that
used the same composite measure.
Decision aids also help people feel more comfortable with their
choices than usual care. This is revealed by the reduced scores for
overall decisional conflict and for the decisional conflict subscales.
People who use decision aids generally feel more informed about
options and clearer regarding their personal values.
Compared to usual care strategies, decision aids improve individ-
uals’ perception of involvement in decision making. This obser-
vation suggests that the International Patient Decision Aids Stan-
dards criterion of helping patients participate ’in ways that they
prefer’ needs to be assessed after a patient has adequate informa-
tion about what involvement means using interventions such as
patient decision aids. People may have a mistaken preference for
28

 passivity because they believe that the best choice relies on the
expertise of the clinician (which option is medically reasonable?)
rather than understand the importance of their own preferences
for outcomes of options (which outcomes matter most to me?).
Evidence continues to build that decision aids have a positive ef-
fect on the patient-clinician consultation (in 9 of the 10 studies
that assessed this effect). Of the studies that measured patient-
clinician communication, five involved using decision aids within
the consultation and five in preparation for the consultation. At
the same time, evidence on length of consultation indicates either
no difference (8 studies) or slightly longer (2 studies) consultations
in the decision aid group compared to usual care consultations.
However, few studies have reported on the impact of the context
in which the patient decision aids are used. A previous subgroup
analysis of 29 studies evaluating patient decision aids for treatment
decisions reported greater improvement in knowledge scores (P
= 0.03) when the patient decision aid was evaluated within the
clinical pathway of care, compared to when patients volunteered
to participate in the study independent of their clinician (Brown
2015).
Variable effects of decision aids
There may be several reasons for the variable effect of decision aids
on the outcome of choices. First, most studies were under-powered
to detect important differences in the outcome of choices. Second,
notenough isknownaboutbaseline ratesforoptimal use of specific
options. Third, in the studies reporting the outcome ’choices’ at
baseline and postdecision aid, some options may have been under-
usedandothersover-used,relative tothe choicesindividualswould
make if they were more fully informed. Under these circumstances,
one could expect to observe directional effects on choices once
people become better informed and more involved in decision
making.
Relatively under-used options at baseline were prostate surgery
for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prophylactic mastectomy for
breast cancer gene carriers. In this prostate-related example, there
was a shortage of urologists and low referral rates for benign pro-
static hyperplasia, whereas the breast-related example reflects the
growing number of women who test gene positive and become
aware of their options for preventing breast cancer. Hence, under-
use of an option may be corrected with exposure to a decision aid.
In the other surgical decision aid studies, there were higher num-
bers of people choosing surgery in the control group (e.g. cardiac
revascularization, back surgery, hysterectomy, orchiectomy, mas-
tectomy). The procedure may have been chosen due to people’s
inflated perceptions of the probabilities of benefits, lack of appre-
ciation of the probabilities of harms, and lack of awareness of al-
ternatives (Hoffman 2015). Exposure to the decision aid reduced
the number of people choosing elective surgery in favour of more
conservative alternatives.
Limited effects of decision aids
The limited effects of decision aids on reported satisfaction with
the decision-making process and with the actual choice made may
indicate that decision aids have a limited effect on satisfaction.
The null effects may also be due to measurement insensitivity.
This is especially likely when satisfaction with usual care is already
quite high (e.g. ceiling effects) and when choices are inherently
difficult to make because of competing benefits and harms. Fur-
thermore, once the decision is made, people may find it psycho-
logically more comforting to say that they are satisfied rather than
entertain doubts about what they have chosen (Gruppen 1994).
There is a need to establish the ’essential ingredients’ in decision
aids and to identify the people who are most likely to benefit from
them. As the body of available research grows, it will become easier
and more important to assess the usefulness of different compo-
nents of decision support for different clinical contexts, decision
problems, and groups of people. For example, an analysis of deci-
sion aids used in higher versus lower socioeconomic groups indi-
cated greater improvements for those of lower socioeconomic sta-
tus(Durand 2014). Recently, the IPDAS Collaborationcompleted
a set of evidence reviews underlying the IPDAS checklist (IPDAS
2013), proposing criteria for defining the intervention as a pa-
tient decision aid and minimal certifying criteria (Joseph-Williams
2013). These are being used to inform the certification of patient
decision aids in the USA, England, and Norway.
It is not surprising that decision aids had limited effects on health
outcomes. One reason for using a decision aid is that there is of-
ten no option with a clear health outcome advantage. For exam-
ple, when men with localized prostate cancer consider active treat-
ment options, their health outcomes can be different, depending
on whether they choose surgery with higher risks of impotence or
radiation therapy with higher risks of longer term bowel irritation.
Therefore, if health outcomes are used in future investigations of
decision aids in situations in which there is clearly no health out-
come advantage, the key question to pose is: do patients experi-
ence the health outcomes they prefer and avoid the outcomes to
which they are averse?
More recently, decision aids are being used in situations in which
there may be a longer-term health advantage, for example, in pre-
ventive decisions about the management of type II diabetes and/
or hypertension, when the longer-term health outcome may be to
avoid stroke (Mann D 2010; Mathers 2012; Montgomery 2003;
Mullan 2009; Weymiller 2007). Interestingly, the pooled results
showed a statistically significant increase in medication initiation
when participants were exposed to the decision aid compared to
usual care.
Unknown effects of decision aids
The effect of patient decision aids on adherence to the chosen
option is an area of uncertainty. The adherence results are difficult
to interpret due to incomplete data, primarily self-reported data,
29

 varying length of follow-ups, and small sample sizes. Moreover,
studies reporting this outcome such as Man-Son-Hing 1999 had
very little variation in choice (over 90% of long-term aspirin users
decided to stay on aspirin). When examining adherence, it would
be important to do so in the early phase, when presumably the
issue is actually decisional in nature (e.g. filling the prescription,
picking up the prescription, refilling the prescription) rather than
involving the management of side effects and in a manner that
separates those choosing to change versus those remaining with
the status quo.
Despite the positive effects of decision aids on patient-clinician
communication, some authors are concerned about the potential
negative influence that decision aids may have on the relational
aspects of the decision-making process; this concern highlights the
need for further evaluation when decision aids are implemented as
part of the routine process of care (Charles 2010; LeBlanc 2010).
In the context of decision aid use, cost-effectiveness and health
utilities are other secondary outcome measures about which little
is known and further evaluation is required (Trenaman 2014).
We also need to establish ways of measuring preference-linked
health outcomes to better determine the effect on quality of life.
It is unlikely that we will observe the effect of decision aids on
litigation rates in studies of decision aids, given the time delay to
litigation and the rarity of this type of event. There do not appear
to be any adverse events from using decision aids, but this could
be more clearly examined in future studies. In fact, a mock trial
that used a patient decision aid for prostate-specific antigen testing
found that the majority of jurors (94%) would indicate that the
standard of care had been met (Barry 2008). A recent systematic
review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine
if patient decision aids could reduce medical malpractice litigation
(Durand 2014).
Quality of the evidence
Risk of bias ratings reveal between-study variability. We rated few
studies as being at low risk of bias for blinding of participants
and personnel and most studies as being at unclear risk of bias.
Likewise, the majority of studies were rated as being at unclear
risk of bias for selective reporting. When we conducted a post
hoc analysis that involved removing studies at high risk of bias
from the meta-analysis, there was no effect on the results. The
conclusions of this review are limited by inadequate power to
detect important between-subgroup differences in effectiveness
and by the wide variability in the decision contexts, the elements
within the patient decision aids, the type of comparison delivered
(collectively referred to as usual care here), the targeted outcomes,
and the evaluation procedures. The small number of studies for
most outcomes did not allow for analysis of publication bias due
to failure to publish negative studies. Moreover, most studies were
at unclear risk of selective outcome reporting, indicating that there
may have been bias arising from a failure to report all negative
findings.
We rated the six primary outcomes in the ’Summary of findings’
table using GRADE and assessed outcomes as high quality (knowl-
edge, feeling uninformed, feeling unclear values), moderate qual-
ity (accurate risk perception, clinician-controlled role in decision
making), and low quality (values-choice congruence). For values-
choice congruence, the GRADE rating was downgraded for lack
of consistency, directness, and precision. More specifically, con-
gruence was measured using various approaches, as there is no
gold standard measurement approach (Munro 2016). Several of
the outcomes demonstrated statistically significant levels of het-
erogeneity. For the outcome of knowledge, for example, hetero-
geneity would be expected, given that the knowledge tests them-
selves were not standardized. However, we did not downgrade
the ratings for knowledge, feeling uninformed, and feeling un-
clear values based on heterogeneity given the consistent direction
of findings across studies. Moreover, the heterogeneity found in
the various outcomes reflects differences across clinically diverse
studies; therefore, the pooled effect size and confidence intervals
should be interpreted as a range across conditions, which may not
be applicable to a specific condition.
Potential biases in the review process
The strength of this systematic review is that patient decision aids
improve several key primary outcomes across a wide variety of pop-
ulations and decision contexts. The potential biases in the review
process are due to limitations associated with having inadequate
power to detect potentially important differences in effectiveness
between subgroups, to differentiate between the most effective
elements within the patient decision aid, and to investigate any
differences associated with the type of comparison interventions
used in studies. Several of the outcomes demonstrated statistically
significant heterogeneity. This reflects differences across clinically
diverse studies; therefore, the pooled effect size and confidence
intervals should be interpreted as a range across conditions, which
may not be applicable to a specific condition. In the Gentles 2013
subgroup analysis exploring three potential sources of heterogene-
ity (e.g. type of control intervention, decision aid IPDAS quality
score, participants’ baseline accurate risk perception), participants’
baseline accurate risk perception was an important variable for ex-
plaining heterogeneity. Authors reported that when participants’
baseline scores for accurate risk perception were lower, decision
aids led to great improvement. Furthermore, we limited the ex-
tracted study data to only two comparison groups (e.g. most inten-
sive intervention including a patient decision aid and usual care);
therefore, we did not investigate the possibility of intermediate
effects with less intensive decision aid interventions.

 Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Our results confirm many of the observations reported in the
previous versions of our review and in a comparative effectiveness
review that focused on studies evaluating oncology-specific patient
decision aids (Trikalinos 2014). We published the first systematic
review of 17 randomized trials of decision aids in 1999 (O’Connor
1999b; O’Connor 2001), followed by updates in 2003 with a total
of 35 studies (O’Connor 2003), in 2009 with a total of 55 studies
(O’Connor 2009b), in 2011 with a total of 86 studies (Stacey
2011), and 2014 with a total of 115 studies (Stacey 2014b).

Implications for practice
The positive effects of decision aids on improving people’s knowl-
edge of risks and benefits, feeling informed, and feeling clear about
their values across a wide variety of decision contexts provides suf-
ficient evidence for using them in clinical practice. They proba-
bly also facilitate accurate risk perception and active participation
in decision making. However, several conditions may be neces-
sary for successful implementation, including: good quality deci-
sion aids that meet the needs of the population; clinicians who
are willing to use decision aids in their practice; effective systems
for delivering decision support; and clinicians and healthcare con-
sumers who are skilled in shared decision making. Although there
have been some strides in achieving these conditions (Elwyn 2013;
O’Connor 2007), the use of patient decision aids will not occur
without adequate attention to implementation barriers to imple-
mentation and careful design of effective strategies for introduc-
ing and maintaining their use in routine clinical practice (Elwyn
2013; Gravel 2006; Legare 2008b; Legare 2010; Legare 2014).
New in this update was a subgroup analysis of the findings based
on timing of decision aid used either before or during a consul-
tation. Although knowledge scores and accurate risk perceptions
were significantly higher in the decision aid group compared to
the usual care, there was no difference in these outcomes when
comparing decision aids used in preparation for versus during the
consultation.
Implications for research
Studies are needed to deepen our understanding of interactions
between patient decision aid use and the patterns of patient-clin-
ician communication; format issues such as the web-based deliv-
ery of patient decision aids; and downstream effects on cost, re-
source use, and adherence. Although this update shows new stud-
ies conducted in Spain and China, most studies have taken place
in North America, the UK, Europe, and Australia. There were far
fewer studies of patient decision aids used within the consultation
than those delivered pre-consultation, and this is an area of further
research given the important issue of implementation.
With the addition of more studies in the systematic review, it may
be possible to tease out the reasons for heterogeneity of results,
including variability in: study quality; comparison intervention;
elements within patient decision aids; decision type; setting where
it was used; and format of decision aid (e.g. video, Internet, book-
let). Research should also explore the degree of detail in patient
decision aids that is required for positive effects according to the
IPDAS criteria. In particular, evaluation is needed to compare the
effect of those decision aids that meet the minimal IPDAS criteria
for certification versus those that meet the full roster of IPDAS
quality criteria (Joseph-Williams 2013).

New search has been performed
We updated the search in April 2015 and added 18 new stud-
ies comparing decision aids to usual care. For this update,
we removed 28 studies that were focused on detailed versus
simple decision aids. We also conducted a subanalysis of de-
cision aids used within the consultation and those used in
preparation for the consultation

6 April 2017
New citation required and conclusions have changed
New for this update is growing evidence that decision aids
may improve informed values-congruence choices and the
sub-analysis indicated improved knowledge and accurate risk
perceptions when decision aids are used either within or in

New citation required and conclusions have changed
This update added 33 new studies for a total of 115
studies involving 34,444 participants. GRADE was
used to summarize the quality of the evidence, and
findings were reported using a ’Summary of findings’
table. We excluded three previously-included trials on
the basis of their quasi-randomized controlled trial (q-
RCT) design identified using the more rigorous ’Risk
of bias’ assessment tool, as well as one other study that
used the same decision aid content for both groups but
varied the format used
Overall, the results are similar to the previous update,
but this update indicates the quality of the evidence to
support the reported outcomes (high-quality evidence
that decision aids compared to usual care improve peo-
ple’s knowledge and reduce their decisional conflict re-
lated to feeling uninformed and unclear about their
personal values; moderate-quality evidence that deci-
sion aids compared to usual care stimulate people to
take a more active role in decision making and im-
prove accurate risk perceptions when probabilities are
included; and low-quality evidence that decision aids
improve the congruence between the chosen option
and their values)
We added two new authors to the review, LT in Sydney
and JW in Ottawa who helped coordinate this update

New citation required but conclusions have not
changed
This update added 31 new studies, and all 86 included
studies were assessed for risk of bias. Overall the results
were consistent with the previous update
New in this update is the meta-analysis of informed
values-based choices for decision aids including explicit
values-clarification compared to those with no explicit
values-clarification. We have also conducted a post-hoc
analysis to evaluate the effect of risk of bias assessment
ratings on outcomes

29 April 2009
New citation required and conclusions have changed
A substantially updated version of this review was pub-
lished on issue 1 2009 of The Cochrane Library. The
changes are outlined in the ’History’ (date 28 July
2006). The updated review ought to have had a new
citation to reflect the new authorship and substantial
changes to the review and its conclusions; however be-
cause of a technical error this new citation was not given
to the updated review
The new citation for this review for issue 3 2009 (
O’Connor 2009b) reflects the updated review contents
as actually published from issue 1 2009 onwards

28 July 2006
New search has been performed
Changes for the 2006 update (first published on issue
1 2009 of The Cochrane Library):
• Outcomes focus on the new effectiveness criteria
of the International Patient Decision Aids Standards
(IPDAS) Collaboration.
• There are now 55 randomized controlled trials
evaluating decision aids in the review. Twenty-five
new randomized controlled trials have been added for
this update. Four trials that were previously included
were excluded from this review as the decision
support intervention was not available to determine
whether it met the inclusion criteria - a requirement
for this update in light of the new IPDAS standards.
There are an additional 15 trials in progress.
• The number of included countries has doubled
from the last update. We now have results from 7
countries (AU, CA, China, Finland, Netherlands, US,
UK).

 (Continued)
Findings from the 2006 update (*new to this update):
• * Thirty-eight trials used at least one measure
that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion.
No trials evaluated the extent to which patient
decision aids achieve the IPDAS decision process
criteria: helped patients to recognize that a decision
needs to be made, understand that values affect the
decision, or discuss values with their practitioner.
• * Exposure to a decision aid with probabilities
resulted in a higher proportion of people with
accurate risk perceptions; the effect was stronger when
probabilities were measure quantitatively rather than
qualitatively.
• Compared to usual care, exposure to decision
aids improved knowledge, decreased decisional
conflict, reduced the proportion of people who were
passive in decision making, reduced the proportion
who remained undecided, and reduced rates of
elective invasive surgery.
• Detailed decision aids (compared to simpler
decision aids) improved knowledge and reduced the
uptake of hormone replacement therapy.
• * Compared to usual care, exposure to decision
aids reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening.
• There are too few studies to comment on the
effects of decision aids on length of the consultation,
patient-practitioner communication, persistence with
chosen option, costs, and resource use.
21 February 2003
New search has been performed
For the 2002 update (O’Connor 2003), the following
changes were made:
• There are now 221 decision aids (increased from
87) that have been identified for the inventory with
131 available and up-to-date: many of which are
available on the Internet. However few have
undergone any form of evaluation for impact on
decision making.
• There are now 35 randomized controlled trials
evaluating decision aids in the review. Eleven new
randomized controlled trials have been added for this
update including 1 large scale trial that evaluated a
suite of 8 decision aids in a number of health services.
• There are an additional 6 trials pending
publication and 24 trials in progress.
• In conjunction with the benefits reported in the
earlier reports, there is now evidence that decision
aids compared to usual care also help with making
actual choices and there is a statistically-significant
reduction in major elective surgery by a quarter.

Detailed compared to simple decision aids also show
an improved agreement between values and actual
choice.
• There continues to be too few studies to
comment on the effects of decision aids on persistence
with chosen therapy, costs, resource use, or efficacy of
dissemination.

Several of the investigators have developed patient decision aids (DS, FL, HL, MHR, MB, KE, RT, LT, KL), but none reviewed their
own studies.
Within the last five years, two investigators (HL, MB) have received financial support from the not-for-profit Informed Medical
Decisions Foundation (IMDF). MB serves on the Board of and received salary and grant support as President of the Foundation. In
2014, the Foundation merged with another not-for-profit, Healthwise. MB continues to receive salary and grant support as Chief
Science Officer at Healthwise. Healthwise develops, licenses, and distributes patient decision aids. Several investigators (DS, FL, HL,
MHR, MB, KE, RT, LT) who were involved in a special issue in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making that included a series
of 14 papers focused on the theoretical and empirical evidence underlying the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS),
received partial funding from the Foundation to cover publishing costs.

There are three main differences between the original protocol and the review. We re-structured the 2009 update, O’Connor 2009b,
to organize the long list of outcomes into primary and secondary outcomes based on the new effectiveness criteria of the International
Patient Decision Aid (IPDAS) Collaboration (Elwyn 2006). For the 2011 update, Stacey 2011, we changed the study quality assessment
to the ’Risk of bias’ assessment (Higgins 2011). For the 2014 update, Stacey 2014b, we used GRADE to summarize the quality of the
evidence and reported the results using Summary of findings for the main comparison.
For the 2016 (current) update, we removed 28 studies that compared detailed versus simple decision aids. This update is limited
to comparisons of patient decision aids versus usual care to provide a more focused review. This change resulted in removal of
these comparisons for pooled results including knowledge scores, decisional conflict, perceived participation in decision making,
proportion undecided, choice, and satisfaction. For other outcomes including congruence between chosen option-values and accurate
risk perception, the new pooled comparisons only focus on patient decision aid versus usual care, rather than previous comparisons
that reported on patient decision aids with explicit values clarification and probabilities of outcomes versus any comparisons without
these features.
