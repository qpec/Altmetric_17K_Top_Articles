Abstract
It is unclear which of four popular contemporary diet patterns is best for weight maintenance among postmenopausal women. Four dietary
patterns were characterised among postmenopausal women aged 49–81 years (mean 63·6 (SD 7·4) years) from the Women’s Health Initiative
Observational Study: (1) a low-fat diet; (2) a reduced-carbohydrate diet; (3) a Mediterranean-style (Med) diet; and (4) a diet consistent with
the US Department of Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). Discrete-time hazards models were used to compare the risk of
weight gain (≥10 %) among high adherers of each diet pattern. In adjusted models, the reduced-carbohydrate diet was inversely related to
weight gain (OR 0·71; 95 % CI 0·66, 0·76), whereas the low-fat (OR 1·43; 95 % CI 1·33, 1·54) and DGA (OR 1·24; 95 % CI 1·15, 1·33) diets were
associated with increased risk of weight gain. By baseline weight status, the reduced-carbohydrate diet was inversely related to weight
gain among women who were normal weight (OR 0·72; 95 % CI 0·63, 0·81), overweight (OR 0·67; 95 % CI 0·59, 0·76) or obese class I (OR 0·63;
95 % CI 0·53, 0·76) at baseline. The low-fat diet was associated with increased risk of weight gain in women who were normal weight
(OR 1·28; 95% CI 1·13, 1·46), overweight (OR 1·60; 95% CI 1·40, 1·83), obese class I (OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·43, 2·09) or obese class II (OR 1·44;
95% CI 1·08, 1·92) at baseline. These findings suggest that a low-fat diet may promote weight gain, whereas a reduced-carbohydrate diet may
decrease risk of postmenopausal weight gain.

Postmenopausal women
Many women gain weight during menopause(1,2), which can
increase the risk of obesity and related chronic diseases such as
diabetes, cancer and CVD(3,4). Identifying one or more diet
patterns that may prevent weight gain could reduce the burden
of obesity and related diseases among women in this age group.
Although the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) every 5 years, a number
of conflicting dietary patterns continue to be investigated for
their ability to induce weight-loss(5–9). Despite their popularity,
diets such as a Mediterranean-style diet, a low-fat diet and a
reduced-carbohydrate diet, have not been compared with the
USDA DGA for their role in prevention of weight gain in free-
living postmenopausal women. Moreover, in this area of research,
where the majority of studies aim to achieve an energetic deficit,
how diet influences weight maintenance when individuals are not
asked to reduce their energy intake is largely unexplored. Thus, it
remains unclear what overall dietary advice should be provided
to this population for the maintenance of weight.
In this study, the relationship between four common diet
patterns and weight gain in a heterogeneous sample of US

 postmenopausal women was examined in order to inform
population-level dietary guidelines for the prevention of weight
gain among free-living postmenopausal women in the USA.
Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational
Study (WHI/OS), four diet patterns were characterised: (1) a low-
fat diet; (2) a reduced-carbohydrate diet; (3) a Mediterranean-
style (Med) diet; and (4) a diet consistent with the USDA’s DGA.
In separate models, hazard ratios were computed by comparing
the risk of weight gain in high and low adherers of each diet
pattern. Overall hazards by diet pattern and stratified hazards by
category of baseline weight status were computed.
Methods
Sample
Data were included from women who participated in the WHI/
OS, a longitudinal study of postmenopausal women aged 49–81
years who were enrolled between 1994 and 1998, and followed
for up to 8 years (n 93 676). Details regarding the sample
and design of WHI/OS have been published elsewhere(10).
Respondents with a BMI < 18·5 kg/m2 (n 1107), or those who
reported following a diabetic diet at baseline (n 3764), were
excluded, leaving 88 805 respondents in the final analytic
sample. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. This study (no. PA16-0039) is exempt
from approval by internal review board (reviewed by University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Office of Human
Research Ethics).
Outcome
Height and weight were measured at baseline to classify
respondents
as
normal
weight
(BMI:
18·5–24·9 kg/m2),
overweight (BMI: 25·0–29·9 kg/m2), obese class I (BMI: 30·0–
34·9 kg/m2), obese class II (BMI: 35·0–39·9 kg/m2) or obese
class III or more (BMI ≥ 40·0 kg/m2). Respondents’ self-reported
highest weight since last follow-up, assessed at years 1, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7 and 8, was used to compute weight change from baseline.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the correlation
between measured weight at baseline, and highest reported
weight in the time since last follow-up at year 1 (Pearson’s r: 0·87;
P< 0·001). Participants were identified as having experienced the
‘outcome’ if their reported highest weight since last follow-up
was ≥10 % higher than baseline weight. In sensitivity analyses
comparing 3, 5 and 10 % weight gain, and the average BMI at
baseline (27·4 kg/m2), a 10 % increase in weight was found to be
the smallest increment to shift the average BMI to the obese range
(30·1 kg/m2). Thus, ≥10 % was the threshold used to define the
outcome, which was modeled as a binary variable to accom-
modate a time-to-event analysis. Respondents were censored
after developing the outcome, or when lost to follow-up. A sen-
sitivity analysis was also performed using continuous weight
change as the outcome of interest.
Dietary data
At baseline and year 3, dietary data were ascertained using
a FFQ comprising 112 items. Dietary intake data from the
baseline FFQ was used to assign respondents to a diet pattern.
Food, beverage and nutrient intake was computed utilising the
University of Minnesota Nutrition Coding Center nutrient data-
base(11,12). The 2010 Healthy Eating Index (2010-HEI)(13)
(available
from
http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/hei/tools.
html), and the MyPyramid Equivalents Database 2.0(14), were
used to characterise adherence to the DGA diet. Baseline total
2010-HEI scores and component scores were computed for
total vegetables; dark green vegetables, peas and beans; total
fruit; whole fruit; whole grains; total dairy products; seafood
and plant proteins; fatty acids; Na; and refined grains. The
Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMed) score was used to
evaluate adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet(15). In brief,
the aMed assigns 1 point for each of the following categories if
intake is above the sample median: (1) vegetables; (2) legumes;
(3) fruit; (4) nuts; (5) whole grains; (6) fish; and (7) ratio of
monounsaturated fat:saturated fat. Before computing aMed
component scores, intakes were adjusted for total energy, and
thus component scores were based on the resulting ‘relative’
sample medians. In addition, 1 point is given if intake of total
red and processed meats is below the median, or if alcohol
(ethanol) intake is in the range of 5–25 g/d(15). The aMed gives a
score of 0–9, which we rescaled to a 100-point scale for con-
gruence with the 2010-HEI. For the 2010-HEI and aMed, a
higher score indicates greater adherence with the DGA diet and
the Mediterranean-style diet patterns, respectively. Quintile
of total score was used to delineate high (top quintile) and
low adherers (bottom quintile) of the Mediterranean-style
and the DGA diet patterns. Below, we use ‘DGA diet’ to
refer to those in the highest quintile of 2010-HEI score, and
‘Mediterranean-style diet’ to reference those in the highest
quintile of aMed score. Quintiles of ‘percentage of total energy
from fat’ and ‘percentage of total energy from carbohydrates’
were used to delineate high and low in the low-fat diet and the
reduced-carbohydrate diet, respectively. Accordingly, ‘low-fat
diet’ and ‘reduced-carbohydrate diet’ are used below to refer to
those in the lowest quintile of intake fat and carbohydrates,
respectively. To accommodate their continuous nature, the four
diet patterns were compared using estimates from separate
models (one for each diet pattern), rather than from a single
combined model.
Covariates
Sociodemographic information was collected at baseline using
a standard questionnaire. This information included annual
family income, race/ethnicity (American Indian or Alaskan
Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American,
Hispanic/Latino, White (not of Hispanic Origin), or other), age
and highest education level completed. Alcohol intake was
assessed by self-report at baseline, with possible responses
ranging from ‘none to <1/month’ to ‘ ≥3 each day’. Lifetime
smoking status at the time of survey was also ascertained at
baseline (current, former and never). Physical activity was
assessed at baseline using a standard questionnaire previously
shown to have acceptable validity and reliability(16–18). Mild
activity was defined as walking. Moderate activity was defined
as ‘not exhausting’ and included biking outdoors, callisthenics,

 easy swimming and dancing. Strenuous or very hard exercise
was defined as activities during which ‘You work up a sweat
and your heart beats fast’. Waist circumference was measured at
baseline using a standard protocol.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute
Inc.) and Stata (version 14; StataCorp). Discrete-time hazards
models were used to model the relationship between diet and
weight gain. This approach is appropriate for estimating the
hazard when the time to event is represented by a small number
of wide intervals such that there are a preponderance of
individuals with tied event times(19).
In separate models, the hazard for ≥10 % weight gain from
baseline was compared among quintiles of a single dietary
pattern of interest. All adjusted models controlled for baseline
total energy intake (continuous) in order to adjust for potential
measurement error in the ascertainment of dietary variables(20).
In addition, adjusted models included diet type at year 3 to
control for instability of diet class and associated measurement
error over time, as well as the following potential con-
founders(8,15,21–26): (1) age (continuous); (2) baseline total mild,
moderate and hard physical activity as metabolic equivalents of
task (MET)-h/week (three continuous variables); (3) race/
ethnicity; (4) annual family income; and (5) baseline smoking
status. All categorical variables were modeled using disjoint
indicator variables. Completes case analysis was used, whereby
respondents with missing data for one or more covariates were
excluded from the analyses.
Sensitivity analyses
We repeated our unadjusted and adjusted analyses specifying
the hazard for weight gain from baseline to be ≥5 %.
Results
Sample characteristics are given in Table 1 for the eligible
sample (n 88 805) and by level of weight gain at last follow-up.
In all, 11 % of respondents (n 10 109) were missing data for one
more covariates. At baseline, women were aged 49–81 years
(mean: 63·6 (SD 7·4) years). Respondents were followed an
average of 6·9 (SD 1·8), during which 19·5 % (n 17 290) of the
sample gained ≥10 % of baseline weight. Degree of weight gain
was significantly related to age, baseline weight status, waist
circumference,
education
level,
household
income
level,
race/ethnicity, weekly MET-h of mild physical activity, smoking
status and alcohol use (P < 0·01). In addition, baseline total
energy intake, 2010-HEI score, aMed score, percent of total
energy intake from fat, and percent of total energy from
carbohydrates, were related to degree of weight gain over time
(P < 0·01).
Selected dietary characteristics for high adherers of each
dietary pattern are shown in Table 2. The Mediterranean-style
diet was highest in energy content (7870 kJ/d (1881 kcal/d)),
followed closely by the reduced-carbohydrate diet (7251 kJ/d
(1733 kcal/d)). The low-fat diet was characterised by low
dietary fat intake (32 (SD 14) g/d), low dietary cholesterol
(132 (SD 72) mg/d) and moderate intake of total dietary fibre
(18 (SD 8) g/d). The reduced-carbohydrate diet was char-
acterised by low intake of carbohydrates (163 (SD 86) g/d), high
intake of total fat (79 (SD 47) g/d) and high intake of dietary
cholesterol (299 (SD 199) mg/d). The Mediterranean-style diet
was highest in carbohydrate intake (258 (SD 86) g/d), total grains
(6 (SD 3) servings/d) and alcohol intake (6 (SD 9) servings/
week). The DGA diet was low in fat intake (42 (SD 20) g/d),
moderate in carbohydrate intake (205 (SD 71) g/d) and highest
in intake of total fibre (19 (SD 7) g/d). Macronutrient composi-
tion and mean total energy intake among high adherers of each
diet pattern is given in Fig. 1. The proportion of total energy
from carbohydrates was highest in the low-fat diet (61 %),
whereas the proportion of total energy from fat was highest in
the reduced-carbohydrate diet (41 %).
Pooled models
Risk of weight gain among high adherers of each diet was
compared with that of low adherers in Table 3. In unadjusted
models, high adherence to the low-fat (OR 0·86; 95 % CI 0·82,
0·91), Mediterranean-style (OR 0·68; 95 % CI 0·64, 0·73) and
DGA (OR 0·77; 95 % CI 0·73, 0·81) diets was associated with
decreased risk of weight gain. High adherence to the reduced-
carbohydrate diet was weakly associated with increased risk of
weight gain in unadjusted models (OR 1·05; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·11;
P < 0·05). In adjusted models, high adherence to the low-fat
(OR 1·43; 95 % CI 1·33, 1·54) and DGA (OR 1·24; 95 % CI 1·15,
1·33) diets was associated with increased risk of weight gain.
There was no longer a significant relationship between diet
pattern and risk of weight gain among high adherers to the
Mediterranean-style diet (OR 0·95; 95 % CI 0·88, 1·03) in
adjusted models. However, high adherence to the reduced-
carbohydrate diet was associated with a sharply lower risk of
weight gain in adjusted models (OR 0·71; 95 % CI 0·66, 0·76).
Stratified models
Baseline weight status was found to be a significant (P < 0·10)
modifier of the relationship between diet pattern and weight
gain. Pooled models therefore included an interaction term for
baseline weight with diet pattern to obtain a unified estimate of
the odds ratios across categories of baseline weight status. The
results of these models are shown in Table 4. High adherence to
the low-fat diet was associated with increased risk of weight
gain among women who were normal weight (OR 1·28; 95 %
CI 1·13, 1·46), overweight (OR 1·60; 95 % CI 1·40, 1·83), obese
class I (OR 1·73; 95 % CI 1·43, 2·09) or obese class II (OR 1·44;
95 % CI 1·08, 1·92) at baseline.
High adherence to the reduced-carbohydrate diet was asso-
ciated with decreased risk of postmenopausal weight gain
among women who were normal weight (OR 0·72; 95 % CI 0·63,
0·81), overweight (OR 0·67; 95 % CI 0·59, 0·76) or obese class I
(OR 0·63; 95 % CI 0·53, 0·76) at baseline.

 related to risk of weight gain, although the relationship
approached significance among women who were normal
weight at baseline (OR 0·90, 95 % CI 0·90, 1·01; P = 0·083).
Conversely, high adherence to the DGA diet was associated
with increased risk of weight gain in women who were normal
weight (OR 1·13; 95% CI 1·00, 1·28; P= 0·049), overweight
(OR·089; 95 % CI 1·15, 1·48), obese class I (OR 1·41; 95 % CI 1·17,
1·70) and obese class III (OR 1·86; 95% CI 1·18, 2·95). The rela-
tionship approached significance among women who were obese
class II at baseline (OR 1·33; 95% CI 0·99, 1·80; P=0·059).
In sensitivity analyses, a ≥5 % weight gain (as opposed
to ≥10 % weight gain) was used as the primary outcome. The
pattern and directionality of the findings were similar to those of
the primary analyses with only one exception. In our adjusted
model, the relationship between the low-fat diet pattern
and weight gain was in the opposite direction of our primary
analysis (OR 0·85; 95 % CI 0·80, 0·90).
Discussion
Overall, we found that postmenopausal women with high
adherence to a reduced-carbohydrate diet, with moderate fat and
high protein intake, were at decreased risk for postmenopausal
weight gain. This finding is consistent with prior related works.
Gardner et al.(27) found that free-living overweight/obese women
who consumed reduced-carbohydrate (34·5 % of total energy
intake at 12 months) had significantly greater weight loss
than those who with higher intake of carbohydrates (range:
45·4–52·4 % of total energy at 12 months). Moreover, those
consuming a low-fat diet (29·8 % of total energy intake at
12 months) lost significantly less weight than those consuming
diets with higher intakes of fat(27). Similarly, Shai et al.(5) found
that,

Diet and postmenopausal weight gain

 or Mediterranean diet. In each of these studies, respondents
consuming the reduced-carbohydrate and low-fat diet patterns
had similar macronutrient intake profiles to the respondents in
our study with high adherence to the reduced-carbohydrate and
low-fat diets, respectively.
Whereas the reduced-carbohydrate diet was protective against
weight gain overall, greater adherence to a low-fat diet was
associated with markedly increase of postmenopausal weight
gain. This relationship persisted in stratified models (by weight
status), wherein high adherence to the low-fat diet pattern was
associated with greater risk of weight gain in women who were
normal weight to obese class II at baseline. The relationship
between the low-fat diet and weight gain was also positive among
those with class III obesity at baseline, but did not reach statistical
significance. This result stands in contrast to findings from long-
term (≥2 years) weight loss trials, in which a low-fat diet has been
reported to facilitate weight loss(5,28,29). Nonetheless, weight loss
trials differ from our study in two important ways that may
invalidate comparisons between the two. Foremost, our sample
was heterogeneous with the majority of individuals classified as
normal weight or overweight by BMI, whereas weight loss trials
typically comprise predominantly individuals with obesity(5,28,29).
Moreover, achieving an energetic deficit is commonly the goal of
weight loss trials, whereas the aim of the current study was to
examine the relationship between diet and incident weight gain
independent of energetic intake.
Despite these differences, we observed a hierarchical rela-
tionship with weight gain among the low-fat, Mediterranean-style
and reduced-carbohydrate diets that is consistent with findings
from the weight loss trial literature. Shai et al.(5), who compared
2-year weight loss among adults with moderate obesity rando-
mised to a Mediterranean, low-fat, or low-carbohydrate diet,
reported that the low-carbohydrate diet was associated with the
greatest weight loss, followed by the Mediterranean diet and
the low-fat diet (low carbohydrate > Mediterranean > low fat).
Similarly, we observed OR of 0·62, 1·24 and 2·05 for the reduced-
carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style and low-fat diets, respectively,
thereby indicating a hierarchical structure consistent with that
reported by Shai et al.(5).
We also found that regardless of diet pattern they followed,
postmenopausal women with a BMI ≥ 35·0 kg/m2 gained ≥10 %
of their baseline weight. Although prior studies in adults have
found those who were overweight or obese at baseline were
more likely to gain weight than those who were normal weight
at baseline(30–32), we are unaware of any prior study of weight
change over time among adult women in which researchers

Diet and postmenopausal weight gain
1195
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 77.173.35.219, on 03 Jun 2019 at 10:00:50, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114517000952
 further stratified their analyses to sub-classify individuals with
obesity into class I, II or III. Moreover, our observation that no
diet was protective against weight gain among those with a
baseline BMI ≥ 35·0 kg/m2 would suggest the need for inter-
vention in these individuals before their progression from class I
to class II obesity. Future studies are needed to identify the
point at which this transition occurs in order to inform such
intervention efforts.
There are several limitations to our approach that warrant
mention. Foremost, it should be noted that our sample comprised
women who were predominantly non-Hispanic White (85·1%),
and thus findings may not be generalisable to minority popula-
tions. Second, although we found measured weight at baseline
to be highly correlated with highest reported weight since last
follow-up at year 1, it has been previously shown that self-
reported weight is prone to reporting error, and the magnitude
and direction with which individuals misreport may vary by sex,
age and weight status(33,34). In addition, an epidemiological
approach may have missed important confounding variables
between dietary intake and weight gain. Additional limitations
include the use of FFQ data to characterise diet and self-reported
body weight, as measured weight was only available at two time
points. Measurement error in diet assessment may have attenuated
the relationship between diet and weight gain in our sample(35,36).
However, FFQ are better at capturing ‘usual’ diet than other
transient methods (e.g. 24-h recall, food record, etc.)(37), and
intake from FFQ tend to be stable over time(37). Thus, FFQ are
well-suited for our study, in which greater within-person diet class
stability over time would enhance our ability to examine the
relationship between diet and weight gain. Moreover, it has been
previously shown that dietary intake from the WHI FFQ had
acceptable correlations with dietary intake from food records(38).
The inclusion of covariates related to misreporting of intake
via FFQ(39), as well as total energy intake, may have minimised the
influence of FFQ-related measurement error on our findings.
Fourth, although each of the four diet patterns was characterised
using distinct criteria, it was possible for individuals to fall into
more than one diet pattern. Nonetheless, diet patterns were
modeled separately, thereby eliminating the possibility for an
individual to represent more than one diet pattern within a given
model. Finally, we chose a weight gain threshold of≥10% to
characterise weight gain, as the majority of women in our study
gained weight during the course of follow-up. In sensitivity
analyses, in which we explored the use of ≥5% weight gain as the
outcome, we observed a similar pattern of findings for all but the
low-fat diet pattern, thereby suggesting a degree of robustness to
our principal findings. Nonetheless, in adjusted models using
the lower threshold for weight gain, the relationship between the
low-fat diet and risk of weight gain was in the opposite direction of
that which we observed in our primary analyses. Notably, the
significance of this finding is not clear. A possible explanation is
that, because most women in our sample gained weight over
time, the lower threshold of ≥5 % weight gain resulted in little
heterogeneity in the risk of weight gain between high and low
adherers of each diet pattern. If true, then cautious interpretation
of these findings would be warranted.
Despite these limitations, this study addresses a gap in research
regarding the relationship between diet and long-term weight
change among free-living individuals. Unlike weight loss trials,
wherein the goal is for subjects to consume fewer energy content
than expended, this study provides an examination of the
relationship between diet and long-term weight change when
subjects were not asked to change their diets. Moreover, whereas
most prior studies have focused on weight loss, our focus on
prevention of weight gain provides a unique contribution to the
literature. Our results address the question ‘which diet is optimal
for weight maintenance among free-living postmenopausal
women who follow a diet of their own choosing?’ We found that a
reduced-carbohydrate diet, high in fat and protein intake, was
associated with reduced risk of weight gain in postmenopausal
women overall, whereas a low-fat a low-fat diet was associated
with increased risk of postmenopausal weight gain.
Conclusion
Consuming a reduced-carbohydrate diet, with moderate fat and
high protein intake, may decrease the risk of weight gain in post-
menopausal women. However, prevailing dietary recommenda-
tions call for limiting fat intake in order to promote optimal health
and prevent chronic disease. Our findings therefore challenge
prevailing dietary recommendations, suggesting instead that a low-
fat may promote rather than prevent weight gain after menopause.
