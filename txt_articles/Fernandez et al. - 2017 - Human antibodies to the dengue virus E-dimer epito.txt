Abstract
The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic has resulted in congenital abnormalities in fetuses and neonates. 
Although some cross-reactive DENV antibodies can enhance ZIKV infection in mice, those 
recognizing the E-dimer epitope (EDE) can neutralize ZIKV infection in cell culture. We 
evaluated the therapeutic activity of human EDE monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for their ability to 
control ZIKV infection in the brains, testes, placentas, and fetuses of mice. A single dose of 
EDE1-B10 antibody given three days after infection protected against lethality, reduced ZIKV 
levels in brains and testes, and preserved sperm counts. In pregnant mice, wild-type or engineered 
LALA variants of EDE1-B10, which cannot engage Fc-γ receptors, diminished ZIKV burden in 
maternal and fetal tissues, and protected against fetal demise. As neutralizing EDE antibodies, in

 addition to their established inhibitory effects against DENV, have therapeutic potential against 
ZIKV, it may be possible to develop therapies that control disease caused by both viruses.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-transmitted, positive-sense RNA virus that is closely 
related to viruses causing significant human disease such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever 
(YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. Historically, ZIKV 
infection in humans was associated with a self-limiting mild febrile illness1. Since its 
epidemic emergence in 2007, ZIKV infection has become linked to more severe clinical 
syndromes. For example, infection of pregnant women, particularly during the first trimester, 
can result in congenital Zika syndrome, which includes microcephaly, neurodevelopmental 
abnormalities, and fetal demise2–4. In adults, ZIKV infection is associated with Guillain-
Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by ascending paralysis and 
polyneuropathy5,6.
The ZIKV genome is organized as a single open reading frame that encodes for three 
structural (capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E)) and seven non-
structural (NS) genes. ZIKV E protein is composed of three domains: a central β-barrel 
domain (domain I, DI), an extended dimerization domain containing a hydrophobic fusion 
loop (FL) epitope at the distal end (domain II, DII), and an immunoglobulin-like segment 
implicated in receptor-binding and entry (domain III, DIII)7. In the immature state, prM and 
E form 60 spiky heterotrimers that protrude from the membrane surface8. Maturation during 
transit through the trans-golgi network results in furin-mediated cleavage of prM to M. Upon 
cleavage, E protein homodimers re-arrange in an anti-parallel orientation forming a 
herringbone array and a smooth virion surface. The transitions undergone by viral particles 
expose different epitopes on the E protein that are essential for receptor-binding, entry, and 
fusion. The E protein also is the primary target for neutralizing antibody responses.
ZIKV strains are classified into two genetic lineages, African and Asian/American. As their 
neutralization by serum and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is quite similar, ZIKV is 
categorized as a single serotype9. Genetic clustering places ZIKV in close relationship to 
DENV, with a 54–59% amino acid identity in E proteins10,11.
The humoral response to ZIKV infection has been studied by several groups with advances 
made in our understanding of the epitopes engaged by protective mAbs12. MAbs targeting 
the cross-reactive DII-FL epitope generally are poorly neutralizing against ZIKV; despite 
this, passive transfer studies in mice suggest these mAbs can protect to some degree against 
ZIKV infection, possibly because of ‘virus breathing’ and further exposure of this 
epitope7,13,14. DII-FL-specific mAbs generated against DENV or ZIKV also have the 
potential to induce reciprocal antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV or DENV 
infection in myeloid cells bearing Fcγ receptors (Fc-γR)15,16 and in mice17. In comparison, 
strongly neutralizing and protective mouse and human anti-ZIKV mAbs have been described 
that bind epitopes in DIII (lateral ridge or A-strand18,19,20), across adjacent dimers in DII19, 
or to sites in DI21. A distinct class of cross-reactive mAbs that engage the DII-FL are the E-
dimer epitope (EDE) mAbs. These mAbs were isolated from DENV-infected patients, bind

 to an inter-dimer quaternary epitope with contact residues in DI, DII, and DIII, and cross-
react with ZIKV10,11,16,22. EDE mAbs are classified by their binding in the context of N-
linked glycosylation at position N154 of the E protein. EDE1 mAbs, which bind in the 
absence of the N-linked glycan, inhibit ZIKV more potently than do EDE2 mAbs10,23.
Studies in mice, non-human primates, and humans have shown that ZIKV can infect and 
persist in several immune-privileged sites including the eye4,24,25, brain24,26,27, testis28,29, 
and the placenta26,30. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic activity of EDE1 mAbs in ZIKV 
infection. Although EDE1-B10 showed protective activity when administered within 5 days 
of infection, it was less effective at clearing infection from immune-privileged tissues once 
ZIKV disseminated to these sites. In the context of pregnancy, EDE1 LALA genetic 
variants, which cannot bind Fc-γR, protected against ZIKV infection as well as recombinant 
wild-type mAbs. Our studies suggest it may be possible to develop EDE1 LALA mAb 
therapeutics that prevent both ZIKV and DENV infection without the possibility for 
pathological immune enhancement.
RESULTS
Anti-DENV human mAbs inhibit ZIKV infection
Previous studies have established that EDE1-C8 and EDE1-C10 bind to and neutralize 
ZIKV infection with EC50 values ranging from 9–14 ng/mL10,31. We compared the ability of 
another EDE1 mAb, EDE1-B10, to neutralize the four serotypes of DENV and the two 
lineages of ZIKV. EDE1-B10 strongly neutralized DENV serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (EC50 ~ 28–
138 ng/mL), with weaker activity against the more distantly related DENV-4 serotype (Fig 
1a). When tested against ZIKV strains representing the genetic diversity of the two lineages 
(African (HD78788) and Asian/American (Brazil PE243), EDE1-B10 had a stronger 
neutralization profile (EC50 ~ 2–4 ng/mL) than did EDE1-C8 and other published EDE 
mAbs10,23 (Fig 1b). As with other EDE mAbs, EDE1-B10 engages a quaternary epitope on 
the virion and does not bind monomeric E protein although the epitope is restored on 
covalently linked E-dimers31,32. Like many other flavivirus antibodies, sub-neutralizing 
concentrations of EDE mAbs can trigger ADE of Fc-γR expressing myeloid cells. To 
prevent possible ADE, we engineered leucine-alanine (LALA) mutations into the Fc region 
of EDE1-B10 and EDE1-C8; these substitutions disrupted engagement with Fc receptors 
and prevented ADE but did not change neutralizing activity against ZIKV (Fig 1c, d)33. 
Thus, anti-DENV EDE mAbs strongly neutralize ZIKV infection, and LALA variants that 
do not promote ADE can be generated without a loss of inhibitory activity in cell culture.
EDE1 mAb therapy controls ZIKV infection
We tested EDE human mAbs for their ability to protect mice against ZIKV-induced lethality 
when administered as a post-exposure therapy. To create a lethal challenge model in 4 to 5 
week-old C57BL/6 mice, we passively transferred a blocking anti-Ifnar1 antibody one day 
prior to infection with 103 focus-forming units (FFU) of a mouse-adapted African strain of 
ZIKV (ZIKV-Dakar)18,19. Mice then were treated with a single dose of EDE1-B10, EDE1-
C8, EDE2-A11 (EC50 of 69–125 ng/ml)10 or an isotype control mAb (Flu 28C) at day +1 
(100 μg), +3 (250 μg), or +5 (250 μg) after infection, and weight and survival were

 monitored for 21 days (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 1). Mice treated with EDE1-B10, EDE1-
C8, or EDE2-A11 were protected against lethality when treated at one or three days after 
infection. Furthermore, EDE1-B10 treatment at 5 days after infection resulted in partial 
protection against lethality and weight loss. Given the greater neutralization activity of 
EDE1-B10 in vitro and robust protection against lethality, most subsequent in vivo studies 
were performed only with EDE1-B10.
As a first step toward determining how EDE1 mAbs protect against disease, we defined the 
kinetics of viral dissemination at the tissues of interest. Within two days of infection, ZIKV 
RNA was readily detectable in the serum (Fig 2b, 1.7 × 105 FFU equivalents per mL), brain 
(Fig 2c, 3.5 × 103 FFU equivalents per g), testis (Fig 2d, 4.8 × 103 FFU equivalents per g), 
epididymis (Fig 2e, 5.0 × 102 FFU equivalents per g), and eye (Fig 2f, 8.8 × 102 FFU 
equivalents per g). At the last time point assessed (day +5), viral titers were still increasing 
in these organs.
We then evaluated the efficacy of EDE1-B10 therapy on the control of ZIKV infection at 
different immune privileged sites during the acute and persistent phases. Adult C57BL/6 
male mice were pre-treated with anti-Ifnar1 blocking antibody and inoculated with 105 FFU 
of mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar. Mice then were administered a single dose of EDE1-B10 or 
an isotype control mAb at day +1 (100 μg), +3 (250 μg), or +5 (250 μg) after infection, and 
viral RNA levels were assessed at day +5 (acute phase) or day +21 (persistent phase) after 
infection. Treatment at day +1 decreased the levels of ZIKV RNA circulating in serum at 
day +5 (52-fold, P < 0.001; Fig 2g). Similarly, EDE1-B10 therapy at day +1 reduced viral 
RNA levels in the brain (1,760-fold and 42-fold, P < 0.001), testis (1,650-fold and 312-fold, 
P < 0.001), and epididymis (4,780- fold and 206-fold, P < 0.001) at day +5 (Fig 2h–j) and 
day +21 (Fig 2l–n), respectively, compared to the isotype-control mAb. Whereas reduced 
levels were observed in the eye at day +5 after EDE1-B10 therapy at day +1 (1,550-fold, P < 
0.001; Fig 2k), ZIKV RNA levels were low at day +21 in EDE1-B10 and isotype control 
mAb groups suggesting clearance occurred independently of mAb treatment (Fig 2o).
In another set of experiments, we treated mice with EDE1-B10 at D+3 and evaluated effects 
on tissue viral burden at D+5 and D+21. Treatment at day +3 with EDE1-B10 had less effect 
on viral RNA levels at day +5 with smaller reductions observed in serum (4-fold, P < 0.05), 
the brain (9-fold, P < 0.001), testis (3-fold, P > 0.05), epididymis (116-fold, P < 0.001), and 
eye (3-fold, P < 0.05) (Fig 2g–k). In comparison, EDE1-B10 treatment at D+3 resulted in 
decreased ZIKV RNA levels in the testis (62-fold, P < 0.05) and epididymis (1,800-fold, P < 
0.05) at D+21 although levels in the brain were not affected (Fig 2l–n).
Finally, we evaluated EDE1-B10 therapy at D+5 for its effect on viral burden at D+21. 
However, treatment with EDE1-B10 beginning D+5 after infection failed to inhibit ZIKV 
RNA levels at day +21 in any of the sites tested. To begin to define why EDE1-B10 
protected at some sites but not others, we measured mAb levels in tissues at D+5 after 
therapy was initiated at D+1 or D+3 (Supplementary Fig 2). Although levels of EDE1-B10 
in serum at D+5 were relatively equivalent, levels in the brain and testis were lower (P < 
0.01) when therapy was started at D+1 than D+3. This may reflect the dimished systemic 
viral burden associated with D+1 treatment, which we speculate limits pro-inflammatory

 immune responses that compromise the blood-brain-barrier and blood-testis barrier function 
and allows EDE1-B10 access. Notably, lower levels of EDE1-B10 penetrated into the eye at 
D+5 regardless of day of treatment, which may be due to a less permeable blood-retinal 
barrier34. As treatment at D+5 failed to reduce viral RNA levels at D+21, once immune-
priviledge sites are seeded, it may be difficult to accumulate sufficient levels of EDE1-B10 
mAb to control or clear infection. In summary, these experiments show a narrow window 
after infection where treatment with EDE1-B10 mAb reduced ZIKV RNA levels in some but 
not other immune privileged sites, once viral seeding had occurred.
To corroborate the protective effects observed with EDE1-B10 therapy, we evaluated ZIKV 
infection in the male reproductive tract at day +21 using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). 
RNA ISH confirmed the absence of ZIKV RNA in the testis and epididymis of mice treated 
with EDE1-B10 at day +1 after infection and showed reduced viral RNA levels when 
treatment was initiated at day +3 after infection (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 3); in 
comparison, isotype control mAb treated animals had high viral RNA levels as reported for 
untreated, infected mice28. Treatment at day +1 or day +3 with EDE1-B10 also protected 
against ZIKV-induced inflammation and damage to the seminiferous tubules that was seen 
with the isotype control mAb (Fig 3b, Supplementary Fig 3) and described previously28,29. 
In contrast, treatment beginning at day +5 minimally protected against ZIKV infection or 
injury. We also evaluated the functional effect of EDE1-B10 in the testis by computer-
assisted sperm analysis. Whereas isotype-control mAb treated ZIKV-infected mice showed 
low numbers of motile sperm, treatment with EDE1-B10 at days 1 or 3 but not 5 resulted in 
higher levels (16 and 100-fold respectively, P < 0.001) at day +21 (Fig 3c), which 
approached those from age-matched uninfected male mice. These data suggest that EDE1-
B10 can reduce viral persistence in select immune privileged sites (e.g., brain and testis) and 
protect against tissue injury when administered within a few days of infection.
EDE1-B10 therapy in maternal and fetal tissues
Placental damage and fetal infection and injury occurs in pregnant mice deficient in type I 
IFN signaling after ZIKV infection25,30,35,36. To assess the protective ability of EDE1-B10 
during pregnancy, we mated Ifnar1−/− dams with wild-type C57BL/6 sires and on embryonic 
day 6.5 (E6.5), inoculated them subcutaneously with a Brazilian ZIKV strain (Paraiba 
2015)19,35. One day after infection (E7.5), we administered a single 250 μg dose of EDE1-
B10 or an isotype-control mAb and monitored effects on the Ifnar1−/− dam and the Ifnar1+/− 
placenta and fetus. Seven days after ZIKV inoculation (E13.5), the isotype-control mAb 
treated group sustained a 90% rate of fetal demise compared to a 10% rate in the dams 
treated with EDE1-B10 (P < 0.0001) (Fig 4a, left). Histological analysis confirmed that the 
fetal demise caused by ZIKV infection was prevented with EDE1-B10 therapy (Fig 4a, 
right). Consistent with these data, EDE1-B10 treatment at day +1 reduced viral RNA burden 
in the maternal serum (~71-fold, P < 0.01) and brain (~39,000-fold, P < 0.05) at day +7 after 
infection (Fig 4b and c). Analysis of the placentas by ISH showed ZIKV RNA in the 
maternal decidua and the junctional layer of the placenta in the isotype-control mAb treated 
mice; in contrast, viral RNA staining was not observed in dams treated with EDE1-B10 (Fig 
4d). Histological analysis after ZIKV infection showed reductions in the size of the labyrinth

 layer of the placenta in isotype-treated dams, which was reversed with EDE1-B10 treatment 
at day +1 after infection (Fig 4e).
The extent of fetal demise after ZIKV infection of Ifnar1−/− dams precluded virological 
assessment of EDE1-B10 protection in the fetus. To obtain such data, we utilized a second 
model of ZIKV infection in pregnancy with an acquired deficiency of type I IFN 
signaling19,35. WT females mated with WT males were treated with anti-Ifnar1 blocking 
mAb at E5.5. One day later (E6.5), dams were inoculated subcutaneously with mouse-
adapted ZIKV-Dakar, and one (E7.5) or three (E9.5) days later treated with EDE1-B10 or an 
isotype-control mAb. Treatment of pregnant dams at day +1 EDE1-B10 reduced viral RNA 
in the maternal serum (~240-fold, P < 0.001) and brain (~3,000-fold, P < 0.05) from the 
level in isotype-control mAb treated dams (Fig 5a, b). When treatment was initiated at day 
+1, we observed markedly reduced if not abolished ZIKV RNA levels in the placenta and 
fetal head (660,000-fold and 4,900-fold respectively, P < 0.0001) of EDE1-B10 treated dams 
relative to the isotype control (Fig 5c, d). Treatment of dams with EDE1-B10 at day +3 also 
reduced ZIKV RNA levels in the maternal serum (22-fold, P < 0.05) and brain (114-fold, P 
< 0.001) (Fig 5a, b). Although ZIKV levels in the placenta (23-fold, P < 0.0001) and fetal 
head (19-fold, P < 0.0001) were lower in the EDE1-B10-treated groups, therapy at this time 
point did not prevent virus seeding (Fig 5c, d).
We next evaluated whether antibody effector functions were required for EDE1-B10 
mediated protection. We generated a mutant version of the EDE1-B10 mAb (LALA 
variant33) that was unable to bind to Fc-γR and promote ADE (Fig 1c) and tested its 
efficacy in vivo during pregnancy. Like therapy with the recombinant wild-type EDE1-B10 
mAb, treatment of dams with EDE1-B10 LALA at day +1 after infection resulted in reduced 
viral RNA levels in the maternal serum (240-fold, P < 0.01), maternal brain (3,000-fold, P < 
0.05), placenta (633,000-fold, P < 0.0001), and fetal head (4,600-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig 5a–
d). Analogous experiments with paired recombinant wild-type and LALA EDE1-C8 mAbs 
yielded similar results (Supplementary Fig 4). Thus, in utero protection mediated by EDE1 
mAbs occurs independently of Fc effector functions and likely is mediated by direct virus 
neutralization. The Fc-γR-binding mutant mAbs could be safer immunotherapies, as they 
lack the potential to mediate ADE and immunopathogenesis.
To corroborate the protective effects in the placenta, we analyzed tissue sections for virus 
infection and tissue injury. RNA ISH of placentas from dams treated at day +1 showed a 
virtual absence of ZIKV-infected cells in the decidua and placenta, and animals treated at 
day +3 also showed reduced viral RNA staining compared to isotype-control treated dams 
(Fig. 5e). Histological measurements of placental layers showed that treatment at day +1 but 
not day +3 with EDE1-B10 restored the area and width of the junctional area, the total 
placental area, and overall fetal size (Fig. 5f–i) compared to the isotype-control mAb. These 
data confirm a narrow therapeutic window for EDE1-B10 for preventing ZIKV infection and 
injury to the developing placenta and fetus.
Sexual transmission is an established route of ZIKV infection37–42. Male-to-female 
transmission of ZIKV has been modeled in pregnant mice through direct intravaginal 
inoculation of virus30. Although recent vaccine studies indicate that adaptive immune

 responses can protect against in utero transmission if ZIKV is inoculated subcutaneously43, 
no study has shown this in the context of vaginal transmission. We assessed whether 
administration of EDE1-B10 through a peripheral route could prevent in utero transmission 
following intravaginal inoculation of ZIKV. WT dams mated with WT sires were treated 
with anti-Ifnar1 blocking mAb and a single 250 μg dose of EDE1-B10 or isotype-control 
mAb at E5.5. At E6.5, dams were inoculated via intravaginal route with mouse-adapted 
ZIKV-Dakar. On E7.5, dams were given a second dose of anti-Ifnar1 blocking mAb. At day 
E13.5, we determined viral RNA burden in maternal and fetal tissues, including those of the 
female reproductive tract. Treatment with EDE1-B10 reduced ZIKV RNA levels in the 
maternal serum (427-fold, P < 0.05) and brain (45,490-fold, P < 0.01) (Fig 6a, b) compared 
to isotype control mAb-treated mice. In EDE1-B10-treated dams, ZIKV RNA levels were 
diminished in all female reproductive tract tissues including the vagina (106,840-fold, P < 
0.01), cervix (12,450-fold, P < 0.01), and ovaries (341,300-fold, P < 0.01) (Fig 6c–e). As 
EDE1-B10 also reduced ZIKV RNA levels in the placenta (1,725,600-fold, P < 0.0001) and 
fetal head (3,020-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig 6f and g), circulating neutralizing antibodies can 
prevent transvaginal transmission of ZIKV to the placenta and fetus. Consistent with these 
data, staining by ISH showed a virtual absence of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and decidua of 
EDE1-B10 treated compared to isotype-control treated dams (Fig 6h). Overall, these 
experiments establish that EDE1-B10 therapy can protect against ZIKV infection and 
transmission to the fetus after subcutaneous or intravaginal inoculation routes.
DISCUSSION
A primary goal of this study was to identify human mAbs that could potently neutralize 
ZIKV and provide post-exposure protection in vivo, including reduction of infection in key 
immune privileged sites. Prior studies showed that E-dimer epitope (EDE) mAbs, isolated 
from DENV-infected subjects, can neutralize DENV and ZIKV in vitro10,11 and protect 
against ZIKV lethality in vivo when administered as prophylaxis22. Studies with more 
ZIKV-specific human mAbs that do not cross-react to DENV also have demonstrated post-
exposure therapeutic activity in lethality models in mice17,19–21. Based on in vitro 
neutralization studies, we defined EDE1-B10 as a candidate because of its strongly 
inhibitory activity against three strains encompassing the genetic diversity of ZIKV as well 
as its neutralizing activity against DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. Of interest, EDE1-B10 
failed to bind or neutralize DENV-4 efficiently; this phenotype was similar to that described 
for cross-reactive mouse anti-DENV mAbs that react with the DII-FL epitope44.
We compared EDE1-B10 with previously published EDE mAbs10,11, EDE1-C8 and EDE2-
A11, for their post-exposure therapeutic activity against lethal ZIKV challenge. Although all 
three EDE mAbs completely protected when given 3 days after ZIKV inoculation, EDE1-
B10 also reduced lethality when administered 5 days after infection. The combination of 
increased neutralizing and protective activity led us to select EDE1-B10 for subsequent 
studies. We assessed how EDE1-B10 functioned at immune privileged sites, which were 
seeded within two days of virus inoculation. ZIKV replication in immune sanctuary sites 
may contribute to its persistence in human and animal body fluids including semen, urine, 
and saliva28,29,45,46. During the acute phase of infection, EDE1-B10 markedly reduced viral 
RNA in multiple immune privileged sites when administered at day +1. However, the

 reductions were lower in magnitude when EDE1-B10 was initiated at day +3. 
Correspondingly, persistence of ZIKV RNA at day 21 was markedly diminished at most 
immune privileged sites when therapy was initiated at day +1. However, when therapy was 
started at day +3, viral RNA persisted at day +21 at several immune privileged sites (eye, 
brain, and testis). Thus, the likely protective role of the EDE1 mAbs is to limit ZIKV 
dissemination, with antibody-mediated clearance of already infected immune privileged sites 
being substantially less efficient. Consistent with this observation, protection of the placenta 
and fetuses by wild-type and LALA variants of EDE1-B10 and EDE1-C8 was equivalent in 
the dam infection model and was not dependent on Fc-dependent interactions. These results 
contrast with HIV33, Ebola virus47, influenza A virus48, and respiratory syncytial virus49 
studies where antibody effector functions enhanced protection. Fc effector functions may 
contribute to antibody-mediated protection of these viruses because unlike ZIKV, they bud 
from the plasma membrane and express structural proteins on the cell surface, which can 
serve as targets of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
Sexual transmission is an established route of ZIKV spread and of concern to those within 
and traveling to endemic regions, particularly for those of child-bearing age. Our study 
shows that systemic mAb administration can protect against intravaginal transmission of 
ZIKV infection in the context of pregnancy. This observation is relevant since macaque 
studies suggest that ZIKV replication in the female reproductive tract precedes infection of 
peripheral organ tissues that contribute to viremia50. Our passive antibody transfer 
experiments in mice suggest that ZIKV vaccines that induce robust neutralizing antibody 
responses and protect against in utero transmission after subcutaneous virus challenge43 may 
also prevent sexual transmission.
ZIKV epidemics in the Americas now occur in DENV endemic regions. Cross-reactive 
antibodies against ZIKV and DENV could protect or mediate pathogenesis51 depending on 
the stoichiometry of binding and mechanism of action32. Our pre-clinical studies with 
LALA variants of EDE1-B10 and EDE1-C8 provide a first step toward developing a safe 
and effective therapeutic antibody against both ZIKV and DENV, without the possibility for 
pathogenic immune enhancement. Nonetheless, as the extent to which these findings in mice 
translate to humans remains unclear, protection studies with EDE1 mAbs in non-human 
primate models of ZIKV infection in pregnancy are warranted. If these data are promising, 
human clinical trials will be required to show efficacy. The design of such trials will be 
challenging given the ephemeral nature of mosquito-transmitted virus epidemics in a given 
locale and the absolute need for safety in the context of transmission studies with pregnant 
women.

 DENV-1 (02-0435; GenBank accession No. JQ740878), DENV-3 (2-1969; GenBank 
accession No. JQ740881) and DENV-4 (1-0093; GenBank accession No. JQ740883) were 
obtained from DENV-infected patients in Thailand (provided by P. Malasit and S. 
Noisakran). DENV-2 (DF-699; GenBank accession No. FM210221) was isolated from a 
patient in Vietnam (provided by C. Simmons). DENV-2 strain 16681 was a gift from 
AFRIMS. Additional ZIKV strains from Brazil (PE243, provided by A. Kohl, R.F. de 
Oliveira Freitas and L.J. Pena) and Africa (HD78788, provided by A. Sakuntabhai) were 
used for neutralization assays. Virus stocks were titered by focus-forming assay (FFA) on 
Vero cells as described52.
Antibody generation
Activated antibody secreting cells (CD19+, CD3−, CD20lo or CD20−, CD27hi and CD138hi) 
were sorted by flow cytometry. To amplify VH and VL genes, one step RT-PCR (Qiagen) 
and nested PCR (Qiagen) were performed. The nested PCR products were cloned into 
expression vectors encoding the human IgG1 constant region or the LALA variant IgG1 
(leucine to alanine substitutions at positions 116 and 117) for the VH gene and the human 
Igκ constant region for the VL gene. Plasmids encoding heavy and light chains were co-
transfected into HEK 293T cells by the polyethylenimine method (Sigma). Wild-type and 
LALA variant IgG1 were purified by Protein G plus/Protein A agarose (Merck).
Neutralization assays
Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with 102 FFU of the different DENV serotypes or 
ZIKV strains for 1 h at 37 °C. The mAb–virus complexes were added to Vero cell 
monolayers in 96-well plates for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were overlaid with 1.5% 
(w/v) carboxymethyl cellulose in Modified Eagle Medium (MEM) supplemented with 3% 
heat-inactivated FBS. Plates were fixed 72 h later for DENV and 48 h later for ZIKV with 
4% PFA in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 
room temperature. Plates were stained with mAb 4G2 supernatant (cross-reactive mouse 
anti-flavivirus mAb targeting the FL epitope) at 37 °C for 1 h followed by peroxidase-
conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in 0.05% 
Tween-PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Foci were visualized by adding DAB substrate 
(Sigma) at a concentration 0.6 mg/ml.
ADE assay
Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with virus at an MOI of 5 at 37°C for 1 h before 
adding to U937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, cells were 
harvested and washed with FACS buffer (2% FBS, 0.5% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 in PBS). 
Cells were fixed and permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature with 4% PFA in PBS 
and 0.5% (w/v) saponin in FACS buffer, respectively. Finally, cells were stained with Alexa 
Fluor 647 conjugated 4G2 mAb and analyzed using a BD LSRFORTESSA X-20 flow 
cytometer.

 Mouse experiments
Animal studies were carried in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health, and were approved 
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington University School of 
Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01). Mice were inoculated with ZIKV after induction 
of anesthesia using ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to 
minimize pain and suffering. Antibody protection studies were performed in the following 
models: a lethal challenge model in which WT C57BL/6 mice (4–5 week-old, Jackson 
Laboratories) were administered 2 mg anti-Ifnar1 mAb (MAR1-5A3, Leinco Technologies) 
by an intraperitoneal injection one day prior to inoculation with 103 FFU of mouse-adapted 
ZIKV-Dakar by subcutaneous route in the footpad. Cross-reactive EDE mAbs (EDE1-C8, 
EDE1-B10, or EDE2-A11) or isotype control (Flu 28C) human mAbs were administered by 
intraperitoneal route as a single dose at day +1 (100 μg, 5 mg/kg), day +3 (250 μg, 12.5 mg/
kg), or day +5 (250 μg, 12.5 mg/kg) after infection. All animals were monitored for lethality 
for 21 days. Time course studies in which WT C57BL/6 mice (8–9 week-old, Jackson 
Laboratories) were treated with 0.5 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb by intraperitoneal injection one 
day prior to inoculation with 105 FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar by subcutaneous 
route. Animals were euthanized at day +1, day +2, day +3, day +4, or day +5 after infection. 
Acute phase mAb protection studies in which WT C57BL/6 mice (8–9 week-old, Jackson 
Laboratories) were treated with 0.5 mg anti-Ifnar1 mAb by intraperitoneal injection one day 
prior to inoculation with 105 FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar by subcutaneous route. 
Cross-reactive EDE1-B10 or an isotype control mAb (Flu 28C) was administered by 
intraperitoneal route as a single dose at day +1 or day +3 after infection as described above. 
All animals were euthanized at day +5, and tissues were harvested following extensive 
perfusion with PBS. Persistence phase mAb protection studies in which WT C57BL/6 mice 
(8–9 week-old, Jackson Laboratories) were treated with 0.5 mg anti-Ifnar1 mAb by 
intraperitoneal injection one day prior to inoculation with 105 FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV-
Dakar by subcutaneous route. Cross-reactive EDE1-B10 or an isotype control mAb (Flu 
28C) was administered by intraperitoneal route as a single dose at day +1, day +3, or day +5 
as described above. All animals were euthanized at day 21, and tissues were harvested.
Pregnancy studies in which WT C57BL/6 mice were bred in a specific-pathogen-free facility 
at Washington University School of Medicine. In some experiments, Ifnar1−/− females and 
wild-type males were mated. At embryonic day E6.5, dams were inoculated with 103 FFU of 
ZIKV-Brazil (Paraiba 2015) by subcutaneous route. At E7.5, dams were treated by 
intraperitoneal route with a single 250 μg dose of EDE1-B10 or an isotype control mAb. In 
another series of experiments, WT female and male mice were mated. At E5.5, dams were 
treated with 1 mg of anti-Ifnar1 by intraperitoneal route. At E6.5, mice were inoculated with 
103 FFU mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar by subcutaneous route. At E7.5, all mice received a 
second 1 mg dose of anti-Ifnar1 mAb through an intraperitoneal route. For treatment, mice 
received a single 250 μg dose of EDE1-B10, EDE1-B10 LALA, EDE1-C8, EDE1-C8 
LALA, or isotype-control mAb by intraperitoneal route on E7.5 (day +1) or E9.5 (day +3, 
excluding the LALA mutants). All animals were euthanized at E13.5, and placentas, fetuses, 
and maternal tissues were collected. Finally, in another series of studies, WT female and 
male mice were mated. At E5.5, dams were treated via an intraperitoneal route with 1.5 mg

 of anti-Ifnar1 and a single 250 μg dose of EDE1-B10 or isotype control mAb. At E6.5, mice 
were inoculated with 105 FFU mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar by intravaginal route in 10 μl 
following swabbing. At E7.5, all mice received a second 1 mg dose of anti-Ifnar1. At E13.5, 
mice were euthanized, and placentas, fetuses, and maternal tissues were collected.
Measurement of viral burden
ZIKV-infected tissues were weighed and homogenized with stainless steel beads in a Bullet 
Blender instrument (Next Advance) in 600 ul (brain) or 200 μl (testis, epididymis, eye, 
vagina, cervix, and ovaries) of PBS. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 
10 min). All homogenized tissues from infected animals were stored at −80°C. Tissue 
samples and serum from ZIKV-infected mice were extracted with RNeasy 96 Kit (tissues) or 
Viral RNA Mini kit (serum) (Qiagen). ZIKV RNA levels were determined by Taqman one-
step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) on an ABI7500 Fast Instrument using 
published primers and conditions53. Viral burden was expressed on a log10 scale as viral 
RNA equivalents per g or ml after comparison with a standard curve produced using serial 
tenfold dilutions of ZIKV RNA.
Measurement of EDE1-B10 in tissues
ZIKV-infected tissues from perfused mice were weighed and homogenized with stainless 
steel beads in a Bullet Blender instrument (Next Advance) in 600 μl (brain) or 300 μl (testis, 
epididymis, and eye) of PBS. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 10 
min). All homogenized tissues from infected animals were stored at −80°C. Flat-bottom 96-
well MaxiSorp (ThermoFisher) plates were coated with goat anti-human (IgG H+L chain) 
antibody (KPL) and then blocked with PBS + 2% BSA (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Tissue 
homogenates were diluted in PBS + 2% BSA and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Plates were 
washed six times and then incubated with AffiniPure horseradish peroxidase conjugated 
goat-anti human IgG (Jackson Immuno) for 1 h at 4 °C and developed with TMB-substrate. 
The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 N H2SO4, and emission (450 nm) was read using 
a TriStar LB 941 reader (Berthold Technologies). EDE1-B10 levels are shown in μg/ml after 
comparison with a standard curve and logistic regression produced using serial threefold 
dilutions of EDE1-B10 in corresponding naïve tissue homogenate tissues.
Viral RNA in situ hybridization
RNA in situ hybridization was performed with RNAscope 2.5 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PFA-fixed paraffin embedded placental 
sections were deparaffinized by incubation for 60 min at 60°C. Endogenous peroxidases 
were quenched with H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were boiled for 15 min in 
RNAscope Target Retrieval Reagent and incubated for 30 min in RNAscope Protease Plus 
before probe hybridization. The probe targeting ZIKV RNA was designed and synthesized 
by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (catalogue number 467771). Negative control (targeting 
bacterial gene dapB) probe was also obtained from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (catalogue 
number 310043). Tissues were counterstained with Gill’s haematoxylin and visualized with 
standard bright-field microscopy.

 Histology
Testis and epididymis were collected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 
PBS. Subsequently, 5-μm-thick sections from EDE1-B10 or isotype-control mAb treated 
mice were processed for histology by haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining. Collected 
placentas were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at room temperature and embedded in 
paraffin. Placentas were sectioned and stained with H & E to assess morphology. Surface 
area and thickness of placenta and different layers were measured using Image J software.
Computer-assisted sperm analysis
Mature sperm from the cauda epididymis of EDE1-B10 or isotype-control mAb treated mice 
at day +21 after infection were collected immediately after euthanasia as reported54. The 
sperm suspension, in vitrofert medium (Cook Medical), was analyzed using the HTM-IVOS 
Vs12 integrated visual optical system motility analyzer (Hamilton-Thorne Research) as 
described previously55. All measurements of motile sperm were made within 60 min of 
dissection of the cauda epididymis.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were 
analyzed by the log-rank test. Viral burden and viremia were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney 
test. Motile sperm and placental and fetal measurements were analyzed by ANOVA using 
either a Kruskal-Wallis or Holm-Sidak’s test with a multiple comparisons correction. Fetal 
outcome was assessed by Fisher’s exact test. Additional detail can be found in the Life 
Sciences Reporting Summary.

EDE1-B10 is an anti-DENV human mAb that cross-neutralizes ZIKV infection. (a) Serial 
dilutions of EDE1-B10 were tested for neutralization of DENV-1-4 serotypes using a focus 
reduction neutralization test. b. EDE1-B10 was tested for neutralization of ZIKV strains 
from Africa (HD78788) and Brazil (PE243). The data is expressed as the percentage of 
neutralized virus, and are representative of two to three independent experiments. c–d. ADE 
(c) and neutralization (d) studies with wild-type and LALA recombinant variants of EDE1-
B10 and EDE1-C8 with DENV-2 (16681) and ZIKV (HD78788). Infection of U937 cells (c) 
in the presence of mAbs EDE1-B10, EDE1-C8, or the LALA mutants is presented as the 
percentage of infection. Wild-type and LALA EDE1-B10 and EDE1-C8 antibodies 
exhibited equivalent neutralizing activity (d). Data are representative of three independent 
experiments.

EDE1-B10 protects against ZIKV induced lethality and viral burden. a. Four to five week-
old WT male mice were treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAb followed by subcutaneous infection 
with mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar. Mice were then treated with isotype-control mAb or 
EDE1-B10 at day +1 (100 μg, left), day +3 (250 μg, middle), or day +5 (250 μg, right). 
Weight and survival data were pooled from two to three independent experiments (isotype, n 
= 19 and EDE1-B10, n = 10 per group; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; log-rank test). b–f. 
Eight to nine week-old WT male mice were treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAb followed by 
subcutaneous inoculation with mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar. Viral RNA was measured by
