Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this work was to study the poten-
tial long-term impact of a 7.8 years intensified, multifactorial
intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
microalbuminuria in terms of gained years of life and years
free from incident cardiovascular disease.
Methods The original intervention (mean treatment duration
7.8 years) involved 160 patients with type 2 diabetes and
microalbuminuria who were randomly assigned (using sealed
envelopes) to receive either conventional therapy or intensi-
fied, multifactorial treatment including both behavioural and
pharmacological approaches. After 7.8 years the study contin-
ued as an observational follow-up with all patients receiving
treatment as for the original intensive-therapy group. The pri-
mary endpoint of this follow-up 21.2 years after intervention
start was difference in median survival time between the orig-
inal treatment groups with and without incident cardiovascu-
lar disease. Non-fatal endpoints and causes of death were ad-
judicated by an external endpoint committee blinded for treat-
ment allocation.
Results Thirty-eight intensive-therapy patients vs 55
conventional-therapy patients died during follow-up (HR 0.55
[95% CI 0.36, 0.83], p=0.005). The patients in the intensive-
therapy group survived for a median of 7.9 years longer than the
conventional-therapy group patients. Median time before first
cardiovascular event after randomisation was 8.1 years longer
in the intensive-therapy group (p=0.001). The hazard for all
microvascular complications was decreased in the intensive-
therapy group in the range 0.52 to 0.67, except for peripheral
neuropathy (HR 1.12).
Conclusions/interpretation At 21.2 years of follow-up of
7.8 years of intensified, multifactorial, target-driven treat-
ment of type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria, we demon-
strate a median of 7.9 years of gain of life. The increase in
lifespan is matched by time free from incident cardiovas-
cular disease.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder often featuring
adiposity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and increased blood
platelet aggregation in addition to hyperglycaemia, giving rise
to an increased risk of macro- and microvascular damage and
reduced life expectancy. Over the past two decades, a number
of single-risk-factor intervention and post-trial studies have
provided evidence for recommending multifactorial treatment
of this common disorder (as reviewed in [1]). Still, patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus have increased risk for early
mortality [2] and may suffer from multiple organ damage with
recurrent event rates of up to 15% per year during follow-up of
various trials [3–8] even though recent surveys suggest
favourable changes in diabetes-related complications includ-
ing death [9, 10].
Therefore, this follow-up, a randomised trial of intensified vs
standard multifactorial intervention for 7.8 years in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, was de-
signed to address the median differences in lifespan with and
without incident cardiovascular events between the originally
intensified vs conventionally treated patients. We use the term
‘years of life gained’ to emphasise the decreased life expectancy
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria.
In the present follow-up study the patients were observed
for a median of 13.2 years after the formal interventional part
of the study ended.
Methods
Study design The Steno-2 study was initiated in 1993, enroll-
ing 160 Danish patients of European descent with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus and microalbuminuria [11–13]. The design and
methods for patient inclusion, randomisation, treatment and
initial follow-up have been reported in detail previously
[11–13].
Briefly, patients were randomised 1:1, stratified in blocks
by sex, age, known diabetes duration and urinary albumin
excretion rate (<100 mg/day vs >100 mg/day) using sealed
envelopes, to receive either conventional multifactorial treat-
ment with treatment goals at all times according to existing
national guidelines or to receive intensified, multifactorial
treatment targeting co-existing risk factors for late diabetic
complications. Eighty patients were assigned to each group.
Conventional-therapy patients were followed by their general
practitioner, but at all times had the opportunity of being re-
ferred to specialist treatment. The treatment in the intensive-
therapy group at a specialised diabetes clinic was target-driven
with stepwise implementation of both behavioural and phar-
macological treatment following a structured approach.
Treatment goals for the groups are shown in Section 1 of the
electronic supplementary material (ESM) in ESM Table 1.
Patients completed up to six study visits at Steno Diabetes
Center, namely at baseline and after an average of 1.9, 3.8, 7.8
and 13.3 years, respectively, and at the termination visit after
21.2 years.
Study population Of the 160 patients originally enrolled in
the Steno-2 study, 130 completed the interventional part of the
study. Patient flow is depicted in Fig. 1. All patients complet-
ing the interventional part of the study provided written in-
formed consent to continue participation in the observational
post-trial follow-up. In the entire follow-up period, one patient
in the conventional group and none in the intensive group
were lost to follow-up. The loss was due to emigration and
data collection on that patient terminated in 2007. All other
patients were followed to death or study termination.
Due to ethical concerns, following the marked risk reduc-
tions found with intensive therapy after 7.8 years, all patients
were subsequently offered intensified multifactorial treatment
according to the original protocol using targets resembling
current EASD/ESC and ADA guidelines [14, 15].
The protocol for the follow-up trial was in accor-
dance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved
by the local ethics committee (Ethics committee,
Capital Region of Denmark; protocol ID number: H-
KA-99035-GS, add. 41104) and by the Danish Data
Protection Agency (J.Nr. 2015-41-4042).
Procedures, measurements and endpoints The follow-up
investigations were initiated to investigate the difference in
median time to 50% mortality in each of the two original
treatment groups. This follow-up study was done as an
amendment to the original study protocol.
The primary endpoint for the present study was the dif-
ference between the two treatment groups in the survival
time after randomisation without and with cardiovascular
disease (CVD). The secondary endpoint was defined as a
composite of cardiovascular events (time to incident CVD
and number of cardiovascular events) as well as mortality
and CVD rates. The tertiary endpoints were rate of incident
diabetic nephropathy, rate of end-stage renal disease and
the development or progression of diabetic retinopathy and
neuropathy.
For the follow-up examinations, all living patients were
invited to an outpatient clinic visit assessing anthropometric,
biochemical and physiological variables as well as detailed
status on micro- and macrovascular complications. The exam-
inations were conducted by a single laboratory technician who
was unaware of the original randomisation assignments.

 Supplementary clinical evaluations were collected from
nationwide registries when not obtainable at the study visit.
All measurement methods were in accordance with previous
follow-up protocols [13].
For endpoint assessment, all patients were tracked by their
unique, static Central Personal Registration number using the
Danish Civil Registration System. All hospital contacts diag-
nosed to possibly fulfil the pre-specified criteria (see ESM
Section 2) or relating to the criteria (including ICD-10
[www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/] observation-diagnoses
[DZ0.3x] and symptom-diagnoses [e.g. DR0.74, chest pain])
were extracted from the Danish National Patient Registry and
used as cases for the endpoint committee. Complete health
records for cases were obtained from nationwide electronic
health records and adjudicated for endpoints by an external
committee masked for patients’ original treatment allocation.
The registries have proven highly valid and complete [16, 17].
Hospitals report mandatorily to the registries and the reported
data on diagnoses and procedures translates directly to the
funding of the hospitals. The data provide information from
1978 onwards. Hospitals mandatorily keep individual patient
records related to hospitalisations and outpatient treatment for
at least 10 years after the last record.
Cardiovascular events were defined as a composite of
death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction,
stroke, amputation due to ischaemia and cardiac or peripheral
revascularisation. If an event occurred as a direct consequence
of, or as an adverse event related to another, immediately prior
event (e.g. percutaneous transluminary coronary angioplasty
immediately after acute myocardial infarction; see ESM sec-
tion 2.1), this latter event was not considered in the analyses of
separate endpoints. Self-reported cardiovascular events prior
to randomisation were not considered. Microvascular compli-
cations were defined, measured and evaluated as described in
ESM Section 3.
Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were conducted
using the intention-to-treat principle. Adherence to the

 treatment was assessed at study visits in both groups based on
interviews with patients.
Overall cumulative survival, as well as CVD-free survival,
by time since randomisation was calculated for the two treat-
ment groups by the Kaplan–Meier estimator. Median survival
time from randomisation was compared between the treatment
groups. CIs for the medians were calculated using
bootstrapping. We specifically chose difference in median sur-
vival time between groups to make a clear statement in easily
understandable terms in addition to the more extensively used,
but more difficult to interpret, HR and RR reduction.
Proportional hazards Poisson models were fitted for mor-
tality (both from cardiovascular causes and from other causes)
and cardiovascular events, taking treatment group, age, sex
and current CVD status into account, using smooth underlying
hazards (time since baseline). Current CVD status was includ-
ed in models for all-cause mortality as 0, 1, 2 or 3 or more
cardiovascular events after randomisation. Thus, we modelled
both death and (extra) CVD events as outcome, and the
models were used to compute the average years of life lived
and the years of life free of CVD during the study period and
thereby the average number of years gained by intensive treat-
ment. Models were checked for proportional hazards between
randomisation groups by likelihood-ratio tests. Diabetes dura-
tion at baseline, as well as the interaction with treatment allo-
cation, was included in a model to assess the effect of diabetes
duration on mortality.
Except for end-stage renal disease (where exact date of
transplantation or first dialysis treatment was known), the sta-
tus of microvascular complications was only assessed at study
visits, and the exact event date is therefore unknown. For
analysis purposes a random date between the last day without
and first day with the specified complication was imputed as
the event date. When the progression between states jumped
more than one category (e.g. from EURODIAB-score 2 to 5
between two observation points), random dates between the
two observations for the steps were generated and used in
analyses of transition rates. Sensitivity analyses were per-
formed by repeating the random allocation of dates.
Transition rates between states and group comparison were
analysed as for cardiovascular events. For each of the four
types of outcome (retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, periph-
eral neuropathy and albuminuria) we estimated the rates of
transition between states of increasing severity and used these
to construct plots showing the fraction of patients in each state
at different times after randomisation.
A fuller account of statistical approaches and detailing of
analyses can be found in ESM Sections 4–7. For the anthro-
pometric, biochemical and physiological variables, the t test,
Mann–Whitney U test and χ2 statistics were applied for the
comparison of means, medians and proportions, respectively.
In the results section all estimates are followed by 95% CIs in
parentheses. Analyses were conducted using R, version 3.3.0,
using the Epi package version 2.5 or Stata/IC version 14.1 for
Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Forty-two patients in the original intensive-therapy group and
24 in the original conventional-therapy group completed the
entire follow-up period. Median observation time for patients
completing follow-up was 21.2 years (range 20.2–21.9 years).
Demographic, anthropometric, clinical variables and pre-
scribed drug intake are presented in Table 1.
Mortality At the end of follow-up, 38 (48%) of the original
intensive-therapy patients had died compared with 55 (69%) of
conventional-therapy patients. Median survival time in the
conventional-therapy group was 13.3 years, and the difference
in median survival time after randomisation was therefore at
least 7.9 years (95% CI 2.2, 9.6 years) (Fig. 2a). However,
formally we were not able to calculate median survival time
after randomisation in the intensive-therapy group (since 48%
[and not 50% as required] of intensive-therapy group patients
died before the end of follow-up) and the calculated differences
in median survival might thus underestimate the real difference.
The observed median time to first CVD event or death was
8.0 years in the conventional-therapy group and 16.1 years in
the intensive-therapy group; a difference of 8.1 years (95% CI
4.0, 12.6 years) (Fig. 2b).
HR (95% CI) estimates for secondary and tertiary end-
points are shown in Fig. 3. The overall, adjusted mortality rate
in the original intensive-therapy group was reduced by 45%
during the entire follow-up period. The absolute risk reduction
in mortality in the intensive-therapy group was 21%.
Death from cardiovascular causes was reduced by 62% in
the intensive-therapy group and no difference in non-
cardiovascular mortality between groups was observed. No
evidence that the mortality rate in the original conventional-
therapy group increased after treatment intensification at
7.8 years was found (ESM Fig. 1); however, the CVD mortality
rates were not proportional (the HR for intensive vs conven-
tional were higher during the first 5 years after randomisation
and lower later on). Following neutralisation of the intervention
after 7.8 years, the rate-ratio for all-cause mortality was signif-
icantly in favour of the original intensive-therapy group.
We found a trend towards an effect of diabetes duration on
mortality (HR 1.03 per year [95% CI 1.00, 1.07], p=0.074;
ESM Fig. 2). This association was equal for the two groups
(p=0.29).
Cardiovascular disease In the intensive-therapy group, 35
patients experienced a cardiovascular event compared with 51
patients in the conventional-therapy group, corresponding to a
51% RR reduction and 20% absolute risk reduction for incident

 CVD. Transitions between, and time in, different states of CVD
(0, 1, 2 or 3 or more events since randomisation, respectively)
are shown in ESM Fig. 5. Twenty-eight patients (35%) in the
intensive group vs 13 (16%) in the conventional group com-
pleted the entire follow-up without any incident macrovascular
events; HR for CVD event in the intensive-therapy group 0.55
(95% CI 0.39, 0.77; p<0.001).
Patients in both groups with one post-baseline cardiovascular
event had a higher mortality rate than patients without; HR 3.08
(95% CI 1.82, 5.19) and an almost linear increase in mortality of
2.08 (95% CI 1.73, 2.51) per extra event. A similar pattern was
seen for further CVD events. When the hazard for mortality was
adjusted for CVD status, there was no difference in mortality
between groups (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.54, 1.30], p=0.43). Thus,
the reduced mortality was primarily due to reduced risk of CVD.
The patients in the intensive group experienced a total of 90
cardiovascular events vs 195 events in the conventional
group. Nineteen intensive-group patients (24%) vs 34
conventional-group patients (43%) experienced more than
one cardiovascular event. No significant between-group dif-
ference in the distribution of specific cardiovascular first-
event types was observed (Table 2 and Fig. 4).
Microvascular complications Hazard rates of progression
rates in microvascular complications compared with baseline
status are shown Fig. 3. Sensitivity analyses showed a negli-
gible effect of the random dates imputation.
Progression of retinopathy was decreased by 33% in the
intensive-therapy group (Fig. 5). Blindness in at least one eye
was reduced in the intensive-therapy group with an HR of 0.47
(95% CI 0.23, 0.98, p=0.044). Autonomic neuropathy was
decreased by 41% in the intensive-therapy group (Fig. 5). We
observed no difference between groups in the progression of
peripheral neuropathy (Fig. 5). Progression to diabetic ne-
phropathy (macroalbuminuria) was reduced by 48% in the
intensive-therapy group (Fig. 5). Ten patients in the
conventional-therapy groups vs five patients in the intensive-
therapy group progressed to end-stage renal disease (p=0.061).
Discussion
In the current report from the Steno-2 study we demonstrate
that intensified treatment for 7.8 years was associated with a
7.9 years longer median lifespan over a period of 21.2 years
follow-up. Furthermore, the increased lifespan was matched
by the years gained free from incident CVD. The reduced
mortality was caused by a decreased risk of incident CVD
and cardiovascular mortality.
Absolute risk and RR reductions for all endpoints were
well in line with earlier reported findings, confirming the du-
rability of the intensified, multifactorial approach [13].
The frequency of recurrent events was high in both groups,
but patients in the original conventional-therapy group expe-
rienced more than twice as many cardiovascular events per
person than patients from the original intensive-therapy group.
Only a few studies have reported results on recurrent events;
none of these have been exclusively in patients with type 2
diabetes [2, 3] and the follow-up periods were much shorter,
hence direct comparison is difficult.
In the Steno-2 study, we observed high rates of progression
for microvascular complications with the vast majority of pa-
tients progressing in one or more complication types. Yet, we
found significant and clinically relevant risk reductions for au-
tonomic neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, as well as
blindness, and a trend towards reduced risk for end-stage renal

intensive-therapy group was at least 7.9 years longer than in the conven-
tional-therapy group (48% of patients in the intensive-therapy group died
during follow-up, so formally this might be an underestimate, since 50%
mortality is required to calculate the median). The median difference in
survival before first CVD event was 8.1 years in favour of the original

 disease. Retinopathy grading was not corrected for cataract
development and surgery, which made the longitudinal com-
parison less exact. For the rarer and later-onset complications
(i.e. end-stage renal disease and blindness) competing risk from
death might be a serious issue, underestimating the true effect
of the intervention.
The risk reductions reported are high compared with those
reported in single-risk-factor intervention trials [18–21].
Concomitant treatment of multiple risk factors seems to be of
profound importance. A recent report from VADT (Veterans
Affairs Diabetes Trial) demonstrated larger risk reductions in
patients with diabetes mellitus achieving both HbA1c and LDL-
cholesterol goals compared with patients achieving only one of
these goals [22]. Similar findings have been reported from the
ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax
and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation) trial examining a
combined approach of intensified blood pressure lowering and
intensive glucose control [23] as well as from registry-based
studies [2, 10]. In addition, analysis of the relation between
number of risk factors simultaneously in control and cardiovas-
cular outcomes in the BARI-2D (Bypass Angioplasty
Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial found a clear
beneficial effect of having more risk factors in control [24],
further supporting the concept of multifactorial treatment.
Long-term beneficial effects of glucose-lowering treatment in
reducing microvascular complications have been demonstrated
beyond the duration of a clinical trial in both type 1 and type 2
diabetes [20, 25, 26]. Lipid-lowering treatment has proven long-
term beneficial effects with regards to CVD reduction [6].
However, the beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes of

 blood pressure- and glucose-lowering treatments seem to atten-
uate when treatment is relaxed post intervention [19, 21, 27].
Long-term beneficial effects in these trials have been termed
‘metabolic memory’ or ‘legacy effect’. In these trials, intensified
intervention according to protocol was stopped at the end of the
trial and the subsequent risk factor control was relaxed or not
reported. In contrast, patients in the Steno-2 study’s intensive-
therapy group continued treatment according to the original treat-
ment goals while patients in the original conventional-therapy
group started intensified treatment with identical targets during
the follow-up period. Thus, from year 8 onwards all patients in
both treatment arms in the Steno-2 study received identical treat-
ment with similar post-trial risk factor levels in the two groups.
We interpret the continuing beneficial effects seen in the trial as a
direct consequence of early intervention intensification in pa-
tients at lower absolute risk for late diabetic complications com-
pared with a situation wherein increased vascular damage is

significant difference in the

interpretation: for autonomic
neuropathy, it is shown that the
fraction of patients that died with
no progression is similar in the two

progression (light orange) was
significantly larger in the

 already present with intensification in later stages of the disease.
This concept of early intervention in patients at lower risk has
just proven beneficial for combined treatment of lipid and blood
pressure lowering in patients at intermediate risk of, but without,
CVD [28].
The Steno-2 study is robust in the sense that data on end-
points are considered complete due to the quality of relevant
databases combined with low dropout rate and endpoint adju-
dication by an external expert committee blinded for treatment
allocation. Additionally, the study design resembles a real-life
situation, where researchers did not have direct influence on
medicine compliance or lifestyle.
In conclusion, we found that intensified, multifactorial
treatment of type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria for
7.8 years compared with conventional treatment increases me-
dian life length by 7.9 years over 21.2 years of follow-up, and
that these gained years were matched by years free from car-
diovascular complications.
We must emphasise the significance of early, intensified
risk factor control in patients with complicated type 2 diabe-
tes. This approach is already broadly implemented according
to clinical guidelines and the present findings should lead to
even more focus on the potential preventive effects.
