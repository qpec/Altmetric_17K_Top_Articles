 The Time Is Right for a New
Classification System for Diabetes:
Rationale and Implications of the
b-Cell–Centric Classification
Schema
Diabetes Care 2016;39:179–186 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-1585
The current classification system presents challenges to the diagnosis and
treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), in part due to its conflicting
and confounding definitions of type 1 DM, type 2 DM, and latent autoimmune
diabetes of adults (LADA). The current schema also lacks a foundation that readily
incorporates advances in our understanding of the disease and its treatment. For
appropriate and coherent therapy, we propose an alternate classification system.
The b-cell–centric classification of DM is a new approach that obviates the inherent
and unintended confusions of the current system. The b-cell–centric model pre-
supposes that all DM originates from a final common denominatordthe abnormal
pancreatic b-cell. It recognizes that interactions between genetically predisposed
b-cells with a number of factors, including insulin resistance (IR), susceptibility to
environmental influences, and immune dysregulation/inflammation, lead to the
range of hyperglycemic phenotypes within the spectrum of DM. Individually or in
concert, and often self-perpetuating, these factors contribute to b-cell stress, dys-
function, or loss through at least 11 distinct pathways. Available, yet underutilized,
treatments provide rational choices for personalized therapies that target the in-
dividual mediating pathways of hyperglycemia at work in any given patient, with-
out the risk of drug-related hypoglycemia or weight gain or imposing further
burden on the b-cells. This article issues an urgent call for the review of the current
DM classification system toward the consensus on a new, more useful system.
A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT HAS PETERED OUT?
The essential function of a classification system is as a navigation tool that helps direct
research, evaluate outcomes, establish guidelines for best practices for prevention and
care, and educate on all of the above. Diabetes mellitus (DM) subtypes as currently
categorized, however, do not fit into our contemporary understanding of the pheno-
types of diabetes (1–6). The inherent challenges of the current system, together with
the limited knowledge that existed at the time of the crafting of the current system,
yielded definitionsfortype1 DM, type2 DM,and latentautoimmune diabetes in adults
(LADA) that are not distinct and are ambiguous and imprecise.
Discovery of the role played by autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of type 1 DM
created the assumption that type 1 DM and type 2 DM possess unique etiologies,
disease courses, and, consequently, treatment approaches. There exists, however,
overlap among even the most “typical” patient cases. Patients presenting with otherwise

PERSPECTIVES IN CARE
 classic insulin resistance (IR)-associated
type 2 DM may display hallmarks of
type 1 DM. Similarly, obesity-related IR
may be observed in patients presenting
with “textbook” type 1 DM (7). The late
presentation of type 1 DM provides a
particular challenge for the current clas-
sification system, in which this subtype
of DM is generally termed LADA. Lead-
ing diabetes organizations have not ar-
rived at a common definition for LADA
(5). There has been little consensus as
to whether this phenotype constitutes a
form of type 2 DM with early or fast de-
struction of b-cells, a late manifesta-
tion of type 1 DM (8), or a distinct
entity with its own genetic footprint
(5). Indeed, current parameters are in-
adequate to clearly distinguish any of
the subforms of DM (Fig. 1). Discussions
and critiques of the current DM classi-
fication system are found in the litera-
ture (1–6).
The use of IR to define type 2 DM
similarly needs consideration. The fact
that many obese patients with IR do
not develop DM indicates that IR is in-
sufficient to cause type 2 DM without
predisposing factors that affect b-cell
function (9).
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMA CAN
RAISE BARRIERS TO OPTIMAL
PATIENT CARE
The current classification schema im-
poses unintended constraints on individ-
ualized medicine. Patients diagnosed
with LADA who retain endogenous insulin
production may receive “default” insulin
therapy as treatment of choice. This de-
cision is guided largely by the categoriza-
tion of LADA within type 1 DM, despite
the capacity for endogenous insulin
production. Treatment options that do
not pose the risks of hypoglycemia or
weight gain might be both useful and
preferable for LADA but are typically
not considered beyond use in type 2
DM (10). Incretins and sodium–glucose
cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are
examples of newer agents that have
demonstrated potential and are being
rigorously evaluated in the treatment
of type 1 DM and LADA (10–17).
The categorization of LADA within
type 1 DM also leads to myopia on the
part of insurers. Medications that could
be logical choices as adjunctive or alter-
native therapies to insulin for candidate
patients with LADA are not designated
as approved processes of care under the
current classification system and ac-
cordingly are not covered by insurers.
We believe that there is little ratio-
nale for limiting choice of therapy solely
on the current definitions of type 1 DM,
type 2 DM, and LADA. We propose that
choice of therapy should be based on
the particular mediating pathway(s) of
hyperglycemia present in each individ-
ual patient, as will be discussed. Only
large clinical trials can fully validate the
best use of various agents across the
spectrum of DM. In the interim, how-
ever, an evidence-based practice ap-
proach can allow for broader utility in
routine care. Metformin and pioglitazone
may be safe and efficacious adjunctive
therapies regardless of the current diag-
nostic category, as may be incretins
(11,15,17–23) and SGLT-2 inhibitors
(14,24–26). It is reasonable that broader

and steroid-induced DM.
b-CELL–CENTRIC CONSTRUCT: A
POTENTIAL MODEL FOR THE
CLASSIFICATION OF DM
Given the above discussion, the issue is
not “what is LADA” or any clinical pre-
sentation of DM under the current sys-
tem. The issue is the mechanisms and
rate of destruction of b-cells at work in
all DM. We present a model that
provides a more logical approach to
classifying DM: the b-cell–centric classi-
fication of DM. In this schema, the ab-
normal b-cell is recognized as the
primary defect in DM. The b-cell–centric
classification system recognizes the in-
terplay of genetics, IR, environmental
factors, and inflammation/immune sys-
tem on the function and mass of b-cells
(Fig. 2). Importantly, this model is uni-
versal for the characterization of DM.
The b-cell–centric concept can be ap-
plied to DM arising in genetically predis-
posed b-cells, as well as in strongly
genetic IRsyndromes, such asthe Rabson-
Mendenhall syndrome (28), which may
exhaust nongenetically predisposed
b-cells. Finally, the b-cell–centric classi-
fication of all DM supports best practices
in the management of DM by identifying
mediating pathways of hyperglycemia
that are operative in each patient and
directing treatment to those specific
dysfunctions.
The b-Cell: At the Root and
Crossroads of Multiple Mediating
Pathways of Hyperglycemia
The b-cell–centric construct suggests a
more logical rationale to the eight core
defects described by the ominous octet
(29). Our model recognizes a total of 11
interlocking pathways that contribute to
hyperglycemia (Fig. 3A). These mediat-
ing pathways of hyperglycemia are in-
duced by the translation of genetic
predispositions to IR, susceptibility to
environmental influences, or immune
dysregulation and inflammation to ge-
netically predisposed, dysfunctional
b-cells. The b-cell construct can incor-
porate newly discovered pathways to

tions, different forms of immune changes, C-peptide secretion, and the need for insulin therapy.

 dysglycemia as these evolve, such as
emerging research linking osteocalcin
levels to A1C and HOMA of b-cell func-
tion status (30).
The mediating pathways of hypergly-
cemia that contribute to b-cell dysfunc-
tion include liver, muscle, and adipose
tissue (organs associated with IR) and
brain, colon, and immune dysregulation.
This damage results in downstream hy-
perglycemia arising from increased glu-
cagon secretion, as well as a reduction in
insulin production, incretin effect, and
amylin levels. Even mild hyperglycemia
resulting from b-cell dysfunction can
upregulate SGLT-2 protein in the kidney,
which further contributes to hypergly-
cemia (31). Hyperglycemia, regardless
of its source, leads to glucotoxicity,
which further impairs b-cell function.
In a given patient, the specific mediating
pathways of hyperglycemia at work are
variable, though likely to involve multi-
ple pathways (Fig. 3A).
Three additional mediating pathways
of hyperglycemia to those of the omi-
nous octet (29) have been identified.
Systemic low-grade inflammation is ob-
served in type 2 DM, type 1 DM, and
LADA (32,33) and has been shown to
accompany the endoplasmic stress im-
posed by increased metabolic demand
for insulin (34). Early studies show
incretins exert anti-inflammatory ef-
fects (35,36), which may account in
part for their benefit. Inflammation is
being clinically evaluated as a therapeu-
tic target. It would be of interest if a re-
cent 1-year trial reporting the ability of a
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor to delay
the progression of disease in LADA pa-
tients (17) proved durable and repro-
ducible.
Changes in gut microbiota may con-
tribute to the diabetic state (37–40).
Gut microbiota has been shown to be
associated with type 1 DM, type 2 DM,
and obesity and has been proposed to
help explain the observation that only a
portion of overweight individuals de-
velop frank DM (38,39). Probiotics and
prebiotics may address this mediator of
hyperglycemia.
Reductions in amylin production in the
diabetic state are a consequence of b-cell
dysfunction. Decreased amylin levels lead
to accelerated gastric emptying and in-
creased glucose absorption in the small
intestine, with corresponding increases
in postprandial glucose levels. This
pathway of hyperglycemia could theo-
retically be addressed, at least in part,
by the ability of incretins to slow gastric
emptying.
A key premise is that the mediating
pathways of hyperglycemia are common
across prediabetes, type 1 DM, type 2
DM, and other currently defined forms
of DM. Accordingly, we believe that the
current antidiabetes armamentarium has
broader applicability across the spectrum
of DM than is currently utilized.
The ideal treatment paradigm would
be one that uses the least number of
agents possible to target the greatest
number of mediating pathways of hy-
perglycemia operative in the given pa-
tient. It is prudent to use agents that will
help patients reach target A1C levels
without introducing drug-related hypo-
glycemia or weight gain. Despite the
capacity of insulin therapy to manage
glucotoxicity, there is a concern for
b-cell damage due to IR that has been
exacerbated by exogenous insulin-
induced hyperinsulinemia and weight
gain (41). Sulfonylureas have been
shown to induce apoptosis of b-cells in
culture (42,43). In contrast, early data
on some newer agents are suggestive
of b-cell–sparing abilities. An improve-
ment of early and late b-cell response to
glucose load has been reported with di-
peptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor treatment
(18,21). Incretins have been shown, in
preclinical evaluations, to halt apoptosis,
stimulate proliferation of b-cells, increase
insulin availability, improve a-cell re-
sponse to insulin (44–46), and, in animal
studies, preserve b-cells (47).
Genetic Influences on the b-Cell
The b-cell–centric model recognizes
that the final common denominator of
DM is the genetically predisposed, dys-
functional b-cell, which ultimately leads
to compromised b-cell function, loss in
b-cell mass, or depleted insulin content
in the face of IR. These may include
monogenic or polygenic defects that
predispose to hyperinsulinemia, IR,
more recently understood mechanisms
such as inflammation by the immune
system (48–51), susceptibility to envi-
ronmental factors (37,51,52), or other
physiological factors that increase de-
mand on or otherwise damage b-cells
such as elevated circulating lipids
(37,53–55) (Fig. 2). As not all carriers
of genes associated with DM develop
DM, susceptibility likely relies on com-
binations of genetic abnormalities, en-
vironment, and lifestyle factors to
exacerbate underlying genetic predis-
positions. Though research is nascent,
implicated environmental factors have
Figure 2—Genetic determinants influence IR (whether centrally or peripherally induced), loss of
b-cell function and mass, environmental triggers (such as viruses, endocrine disruptors, food
advanced glycosylation end products, gut biome), and immune modulation and inflammation.
Singly or, more commonly, in various combinations, these factors converge on the genetically
susceptible b-cell, impinge on b-cell function and biology, and orchestrate the shift from nor-
moglycemia to hyperglycemia. As this process takes place regardless of subtype of DM, the
dysfunctional b-cell is the final common denominator in all DM.

 included endocrine disruptors (56),
food additives (52), abnormal gut bi-
ome (38,39,57), and ingested advanced
glycation end products (58). There is
also evidence that certain environmen-
tal factors may epigenetically alter the
genotype in reproductive cells, produc-
ing inheritable DM factors in future gen-
erations (59,60) (Fig. 2).
Clinically evident DM ensues at or after
the juncture when the combined gene–
environment trigger reaches a tipping
point for sufficient b-cell compromise to
be expressed as phenotypic hyperglyce-
mia. This fundamental concept applies
to all forms of DM, substantiating that
the final common denominator in DM is
at the level of the b-cell.
In our model, as typical in obesity, IR
is a monogenic or, more commonly, a
polygenic disorder (59). Additional con-
tributing factors to IR may include inflam-
mation (48–51), changes in the gut
microbiota (37–40), and brain-modulated
changes in metabolism (51,61,62). Re-
sulting hyperinsulinemia feeds back to
the hypothalamus to further exacerbate
peripheral IR (61,62). Downstream ef-
fects of IR cause detriment to b-cell
function by mechanisms that may in-
clude inflammatory cytokines, adipocy-
tokines, lipotoxicity, and decreased
adiponectin, potentially representing a
physiological scenario similar to that in-
duced by hyperinsulinemia (63,64).
b-CELL–CENTRIC SCHEMA AND
INDIVIDUALIZED CARE
We propose that the b-cell–centric
model is a conceptual framework that
could help optimize processes of care
for DM. A1C, fasting blood glucose,
and postprandial glucose testing remain
the basis of DM diagnosis and monitor-
ing. Precision medicine in the treatment
of DM could be realized by additional
diagnostic testing that could include
C-peptide (1), islet cell antibodies or
other markers of inflammation (1,65),
measures of IR, improved assays for
b-cell mass, and markers of environ-
mental damage and by the development
of markers for the various mediating
pathways of hyperglycemia.
We uphold that there is, and will in-
creasingly be, a place for genotyping in
DM standard of care. Pharmacoge-
nomics could help direct patient-level
care (66–69) and holds the potential
to spur on research through the
development of DM gene banks for
analyzing genetic distinctions between
type 1 DM, LADA, type 2 DM, and
maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
The cost for genotyping has become in-
creasingly affordable.
Lifestyle modification is the starting
point for intervention in prediabetes and
DM as is normalization of dyslipidemia,
given the links of prolonged lipid exposure
with b-cell dysfunction (9,53–55). Our ap-
proach advocates intervention early in the
process of b-cell dysfunction. It is intui-
tively obvious that the constellation of
mediating pathways of hyperglycemia in
frank DM is likely the same as those in
prediabetes. Pharmacotherapy for predi-
abetes should be considered if lifestyle
approaches do not produce normoglyce-
mia. Preferential use of agents with
proven or strong evidence for b-cell pres-
ervation is logical (70).
The optimal strategy is to use the
least number of agents to target the
greatest number of mediating pathways
of hyperglycemia operative in the given
patient. It would use regimens that sta-
bilize hyperglycemia across multiple
causes, act synergistically to reduce car-
diovascular and other risk factors, and
preserve b-cells. Figure 3B illustrates
the mediating pathways of hyperglyce-
mia addressed by various available
agents and provides a logic for the se-
lection of complementary modes of ac-
tion in combination therapy.
Our approach for using combination
therapy is consistent with the recom-
mendations within the 2015 American
Diabetes Association (71) and 2015
American Association of Clinical Endo-
crinologists (72) guidelines. We advo-
cate the introduction of combination
therapy early in the pharmacological
management of the disease. Critically,
we avoid stratifying first-, second-, and
third-line treatment sequencing. This
stratification establishes undue competi-
tion between classes, which should more
rightly be viewed as complementary op-
tions rather than salvage therapy after in-
evitable treatment failure (19,73).
The ideal treatment regimens should
not be potentially detrimental to the
long-term integrity of the b-cells. Spe-
cifically, sulfonylureas and glinides
should be ardently avoided. Any bene-
fits associated with sulfonylureas and
glinides (including low cost) are not en-
during and are far outweighed by their
attendant risks (and associated treat-
ment costs) of hypoglycemia and weight
gain, high rate of treatment failure and
subsequent enhanced requirements for
antihyperglycemic management, poten-
tial for b-cell exhaustion (42), increased
risk of cardiovascular events (74), and
potential for increased risk of mortality
(75,76). Fortunately, there are a large
number of classes now available that
do not pose these risks. Empagliflozin
has been recently shown to reduce car-
diovascular outcomes and mortality in
type 2 DM, while reducing weight and
posing a low risk for hypoglycemia (24).
Newer agents present alternatives to
insulin therapy, including in patients
with “advanced” type 2 DM with resid-
ual insulin production. Insulin therapy
induces hypoglycemia, weight gain,
and a range of adverse consequences
of hyperinsulinemia with both short-
and long-term outcomes (77–85). Newer
antidiabetes classes may be used to de-
lay insulin therapy in candidate patients
with endogenous insulin production
(19). In patients requiring basal insulin,
clinical research on novel combinations
of classes, such as pramlintide (86) and
incretins (19,22), may reduce or elim-
inate the need for bolus insulin. Bolus
insulin accounts for most of the hypo-
glycemia seen with basal–bolus insulin
therapy (87). When insulin therapy is
needed, we suggest it be incorporated
as add-on therapy rather than as sub-
stitution for noninsulin antidiabetes
agents. Outcomes research is needed
to fully evaluate various combina-
tion therapeutic approaches, as well as
the potential of newer agents to address
drivers of b-cell dysfunction and loss.
The principles of the b-cell–centric
model provide a rationale for adjunctive
therapy with noninsulin regimens in pa-
tients with type 1 DM (7,12–16). Thiazo-
lidinedione (TZD) therapy in patients
with type 1 DM presenting with IR, for
example, is appropriate and can be ben-
eficial (17). Clinical trials in type 1 DM
show that incretins (20) or SGLT-2 inhi-
bitors (25,88) as adjunctive therapy to
exogenous insulin appear to reduce
plasma glucose variability.
FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL AND
TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH

 of glucose dysregulation and the medi-
ating pathways of hyperglycemia sur-
rounding the b-cell as the basis for
treatment decisions. A b-cell–focused
schema can integrate knowledge to
date and incorporate new discoveries.
It can provide sage advice for preferen-
tial use of pharmacological interven-
tions that address the mechanisms of
hyperglycemia operative in an individ-
ual patient, avoid hypoglycemia and
weight gain, and appear to be b-cell
sparing. Preferred therapies will be
those that affect multiple mediators of
hyperglycemia. Novel anti-inflammation
agents currently in phase 2 and 3 clinical
development should be evaluated for
safety and efficacy, and we should fur-
ther explore suggestions that this ap-
proach could effectively treat, reverse,
or even prevent DM with an inflamma-
tory component (89).
The
b-cell–centric
classification
schema was envisioned as a stimulus
to guide basic research, as well as clini-
cal and translational research. It is
hoped to help direct research on the
genes involved in DM, the functions
that these genes serve, the mechanisms
that lead to b-cell damage, the down-
stream effects of reduced b-cell function,
and any novel mechanisms of b-cell path-
ophysiology. Also needed is research to-
ward improved diagnostic markers for
the development of DM.
The b-cell–centric model can be
readily retrofitted into the terminology
of the existing classification system.
However, we submit that an entirely
new nomenclature may likely best fulfill
the imperative of bringing the classifica-
tion in line with the known etiology and
disease course.
A CALL TO ACTION
For all the above-stated reasons, we
urge that the time is right to convene a
committee of diabetes community lead-
ers and researchers to reevaluate the
current outmoded DM classification sys-
tem. Members of the American Diabe-
tes Association, American Association of
Clinical Endocrinologists, European As-
sociation for the Study of Diabetes, In-
ternational Diabetes Federation, and
World Health Organization should
come together to address this immense,
but vital, task toward delivering state-
of-the-art, optimal patient care and di-
recting future research.
