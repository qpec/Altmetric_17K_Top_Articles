 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Primary outcomes at 3 months were quality of 
communication (QOC, questionnaire scored 0–10 with higher ratings indicating better quality), 
family report of concordance with clinicians on the primary goal of care (endorsing same goal as 
the “best goal to guide care and medical treatment,” and clinicians’ “top priority for care and 
medical treatment”), and treatment consistent with preferences (Advance Care Planning Problem 
score). Secondary outcomes at 9 months were family ratings of symptom management and care, 
palliative care domains in care plans, Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST) completion, 
and hospital transfers. Resident-family dyads were the primary unit of analysis, and all analyses 
used intention-to-treat assignment.
RESULTS—Residents’ mean age was 86.5 years, 39 (12.9%) were African American, and 246 
(81.5%) were women. With the GOC intervention, family decision makers reported better quality 
of communication (QOC, 6.0 vs 5.6; P = .05) and better end-of-life communication (QOC end-of-
life subscale, 3.7 vs 3.0; P = .02). Goal concordance did not differ at 3 months, but family decision 
makers with the intervention reported greater concordance by 9 months or death (133 [88.4%] vs 
108 [71.2%], P = .001). Family ratings of treatment consistent with preferences, symptom 
management, and quality of care did not differ. Residents in the intervention group had more 
palliative care content in treatment plans (5.6 vs 4.7, P = .02), MOST order sets (35% vs 16%, P 
= .05), and half as many hospital transfers (0.078 vs 0.163 per 90 person-days; RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 
0.26–0.88). Survival at 9 months was unaffected (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.54–1.08; P = .13).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—The GOC decision aid intervention is effective to 
improve end-of-life communication for nursing home residents with advanced dementia and 
enhance palliative care plans while reducing hospital transfers.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01565642
Background
Alzheimer disease and related dementias are a cause of functional dependency and death. 
Over 5 million Americans have dementia, and 1 million have advanced disease with loss of 
meaningful communication and total functional dependency.1 Medical complications 
include nutritional problems, infections, and falls. Median survival in these patients is 1.3 
years.2
Family members make difficult choices on behalf of persons with dementia. Common 
decisions include resuscitation, tube feeding, treatment of infections, and hospital transfer.3 
Decisions are made in nursing homes, where 67% of persons with dementia die.4 Families 
report limited communication and support for these choices.5,6 The CASCADE study 
followed 323 nursing home residents with advanced dementia for 18 months. Only 38% of 
decision makers recalled involvement in treatment choices. Half spent less than 15 minutes 
discussing advance directives, and limited understanding was associated with more 
aggressive treatment.2,3
Treatments should align with medical goals such as survival, function, or comfort.7 Shared 
decision making helps patients and families prioritize goals to guide treatment.8 Decision 
aids improve shared decision making by informing and framing health care choices.9

 However, few decision aids are designed for dementia.10–12 To address this gap we 
developed the Goals of Care (GOC) intervention, consisting of a video decision aid and 
structured care plan meeting for family decision makers for persons with advanced 
dementia. Our primary aim was to learn if the GOC intervention improves quality of 
communication and decision-making. Our second aim was to test whether the intervention 
would improve palliative care for advanced dementia.
Methods
Trial Design
The study was a single-blind cluster randomized trial of the GOC intervention compared 
with an attention control. Nursing homes were randomized to minimize contamination and 
parallel how decision aids are implemented. Outcomes were assessed at the level of the 
resident-family dyad. The University of North Carolina institutional review board approved 
the protocol (Supplement 1) prior to initiation of research, and 2 data safety monitors 
reviewed procedures and preliminary data every 6 months. Family decision makers provided 
written informed consent for themselves and the resident with advanced dementia. Family 
decision makers were compensated for their participation.
Randomization of Nursing Home Sites
Nursing homes were eligible within a 60-minute driving radius of the University of North 
Carolina-Chapel Hill. Administrators and medical directors agreed to site participation, and 
treating physicians gave permission to recruit families. The study statistician (F.-C.L.) 
randomized 22 nursing homes in blocks of 4, except for a final block of 2, matched by profit 
vs nonprofit status and percent African American residents.
Participants
From April 2012 to September 2014 we enrolled dyads of persons with advanced dementia 
and family decision makers. Nursing homes sent initial letters and referred those who agreed 
to contact with researchers. Residents were eligible if they were aged 65 years or older, had 
severe to advanced dementia, and had an English-speaking family decision maker. Nurses 
verified dementia stage (5–7 on the Global Deterioration Scale [GDS]).13 Persons with GDS 
5 dementia cannot live independently and are frequently disoriented, while those with GDS 
7 have sparse speech, dependency for all activities, and cannot recognize family. Family 
decision makers were eligible if they were legally authorized representatives for health care 
decisions as guardian, possessed health care power of attorney, or the decision maker under 
North Carolina law was sequenced as spouse, adult children, or sibling.
Intervention and Control
Intervention decision makers had the 2-part intervention, consisting of an 18-minute GOC 
video decision aid and a structured discussion with the nursing home care team. The 
decision aid was developed using International Patient Decision Aid Standards, and tested 
for feasibility and acceptability.14,15 It provided information on dementia, goals of 
prolonging life, supporting function, or improving comfort, treatments consistent with each 
goal, and how to prioritize goals. Decision makers saw the decision aid with research staff

 during their initial study visit, and received a print copy of the decision aid and guide called 
“Questions to Consider in Care Planning” (available on request from the authors).
To prepare staff for a goals of care discussion, investigators gave a 1-hour training session to 
nurses, social workers, therapists, and nutritionists who create care plans. They viewed the 
GOC decision aid, learned the VALUE (value family comments, address emotions, listen, 
understand the patient as a person, and elicit family questions) principles for family 
communication, and observed a short role play of a goals of care discussion.16 Research 
staff also provided them with a written discussion guide, and reminders to meet with 
decision makers. Physicians and nurse practitioners were invited to these discussions, but 
rarely attended. Research staff monitored the intervention, and required retraining if 70% 
fidelity was not achieved. One facility required retraining, and fidelity was achieved for 90% 
of participants.17
Family decision makers in control sites experienced an informational video on interaction 
with someone with dementia and a usual care plan meeting with staff. Nursing home staff 
received a 45-minute training on study procedures. All other procedures were identical for 
both arms.
Data Collection
Research assistants blinded to participant assignment assessed outcomes. They interviewed 
family decision makers in person at baseline, and by telephone at 3, 6, and 9 months. They 
also completed structured resident medical chart reviews at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 9 
months. On a resident’s death, interviews were modified to address care during dying.
Family provided data about age, sex, race, education, and relationship for themselves and the 
person with dementia. Medical chart reviews provided data to calculate the Advanced 
Dementia Prognostic Tool (ADEPT), derived from standardized variables in nursing home 
records. The ADEPT scores range from 1 to 32.5, with higher scores indicating higher 
mortality risk.18 Medical chart reviews were also the source of data on treatment in domains 
of palliative care, hospice enrollment, and transfers to emergency departments or hospitals.
Outcomes
Primary and secondary outcomes were compared at 3 months, 6 months, and a final end 
point of 9 months or death. Study outcomes for the primary aim were 3 family-rated 
measures of quality of communication and decision making at 3 months: (1) Quality of 
Communication (QOC) scores for nursing home staff, (2) concordance with clinicians on 
goals of care, and (3) the Advance Care Planning problem score. The valid and reliable QOC 
questionnaire is a 13-item instrument with an overall score and 2 subscale scores for 
“general communication skills” and “communication about end-of-life care.”19 Scores range 
from 0 (“poor”) to 10 (“absolutely perfect”); responses of “clinician did not do” are recoded 
0. To measure concordance with clinicians on the primary goal of care, family decision 
makers reported whether prolonging life, supporting function, or improving comfort was the 
“best goal to guide the resident’s care and medical treatment,” and separately reported which 
goal was the nursing home staff and physician’s “top priority for the resident’s care and 
medical treatment.” Concordance meant the same response to both items. Finally, the

 Advance Care Planning Problem score was used to measure use of resident preferences to 
guide treatment.20,21 Three dichotomous items ask family decision makers if the resident’s 
preferences were discussed, used to guide treatment, and if treatment was consistent with 
preferences. The score is reported as percent with 1 or more unfavorable responses.
Secondary outcomes measured quality of palliative care at 6 months and at 9 months or 
death. Families rated quality of symptom management and overall care using the validated 
Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD) and Satisfaction with 
Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD) instruments. The SM-EOLD ranges from 
0 to 45 and the SWC-EOLD ranges from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating better 
quality.22 Investigators developed a Palliative Care Treatment Plan Domain score to capture 
the palliative care content of residents’ treatment plans. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 1 
point assigned when each of the following domains was addressed in the written care plan: 
prognosis, goals of care, treatment for physical symptoms, emotional needs, spiritual needs, 
and decisions to use or avoid use of 5 treatments: resuscitation, artificial feeding, 
intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and hospitalization. Research assistants completed paired 
medical chart reviews until they achieved an inter-rater reliability of greater than 0.85 on all 
items. To describe additional details of the treatment plan, research assistants also recorded 
do not resuscitate orders, orders not to hospitalize or use tube feeding, and completion of a 
Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), the North Carolina version of the 
Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) order set. Medical chart reviews 
recorded hospice enrollment, hospital transfers, and resident deaths.
Statistical Analysis
Resident-family dyads were the primary unit of analysis, and all analyses used intention-to-
treat assignment. Participants in the intervention and control groups were compared on 
baseline characteristics to explore possible between-group differences despite cluster 
randomized. Nursing home characteristics were compared using χ2 tests for categorical 
variables and t tests for continuous variables.
Intervention and control dyads were compared on primary and secondary outcomes 
measured at 3 months, 6 months, and at the final time point of 9 months or death. Rates of 
hospital or emergency department transfer were calculated as events per person-day at risk, 
to account for differential follow-up owing to death. In the longitudinal analysis, intraclass 
correlations were considered at 2 levels: residents clustered within nursing homes, and 
repeated measures for the same individual over time. Investigators fit a generalized mixed 
effects model with both a random intercept and random slope (in time) to control for the 
variation between nursing homes and correlation among residents within nursing homes, 
with treatment, time and interaction between treatment and time as covariates. Time was 
included as a categorical variable. They fit a simpler random intercept model with 
adjustment for baseline measures for the final 9-month or death outcomes and a fixed effects 
model with robust variance estimation when the random intercept model did not converge. 
Resident survival times were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models for 
comparison between intervention and control groups, adjusted for nursing home cluster

 effects. All of the analyses used SAS statistical software (version 9.3, SAS institute) and P 
values less than .05 were considered significant.
With a sample size of 300 dyads, the trial was powered to detect a 0.8 mean difference in the 
overall QOC score, and a 1.5 mean difference in the QOC end-of-life subscale score 
between the control and intervention arms. Estimation included adjustment for cluster 
effects, and a 6-month mortality risk of 28%.
Results
Enrollment
Administrators and all physicians agreed to participate in 22 of 25 nursing homes 
approached. These 22 sites were paired and randomly assigned to intervention or control 
groups; sites did not differ in organizational characteristics (eTable A in Supplement 2). 
Nursing home staff identified 534 potentially eligible dyads; of these 118 (22%) decision 
makers refused contact, and 27 (5%) could not be reached. Of the 387 eligible family 
decision makers contacted, 302 (78%) agreed to participate and were enrolled. Accounting 
for expected deaths, participation was 99% complete at 3 and 6 months, and 100% at 9 
months (Figure 1).
Participant Characteristics
Residents with dementia had a mean age of 86.5 years, 246 (81.5%) were women, and they 
had a 12-month mortality risk of 33% based on ADEPT (Table 1). Family decision makers’ 
mean age was 63 years, and most were daughters or daughters-in-law. Characteristics did 
not differ between study arms.
Communication and Decision-Making Outcomes
With the GOC intervention, family decision makers reported better overall scores on the 10-
point QOC questionnaire at 3 months compared with those in the control group (6.0 vs 5.6, 
P = .05) (Table 2). Improvement corresponded to higher ratings of end-of-life 
communication (QOC end-of-life subscale, 3.7 vs 3.0; P = .02). The intervention group 
continued to report better quality end-of-life communication compared with controls in the 
final time period (QOC end-of-life subscale, 3.9 vs 3.1; P = .03), despite somewhat less 
positive ratings of general communication (QOC general subscale, 8.2 vs 8.6; P = .03). 
Compared with controls, family decision makers with the GOC intervention perceived 
greater concordance with providers regarding the primary goal of care by the final 
assessment (88.4% vs 71.2%, P = .001); concordance showed a trend favoring the 
intervention at 3 months. Comfort was increasingly the primary goal of care over time for 
both groups. Intervention and control decision makers did not differ on Advance Care 
Planning Problem scores. Examining individual items in this score, over 90% of decision 
makers in both groups reported treatment was consistent with resident preferences, but that 
discussion of residents’ preferences to guide treatment was relatively infrequent (eTable B in 
Supplement 2). Family often discussed medical treatment choices with nurses or social 
workers, and a minority reported communication with nursing home physicians or nurse 
practitioners.

 Quality of Palliative Care Outcomes
Family ratings of symptom management (SM-EOLD) and satisfaction with care (SWC-
EOLD) did not differ between groups (Table 3). However, following the intervention 
residents had more palliative care domains addressed in their treatment plans by 6 months, 
compared with residents in the control group (5.6 vs 4.7, P = .02). The most directly related 
domain—goals of care documentation—increased at 6 months (91% vs 42%, P < .001), and 
at the final assessment (95% vs 52%, P < .001).
Nursing home physicians or nurse practitioners completed a MOST order set more often for 
residents in the intervention group (35% vs 16%, P = .05). Do not resuscitate (DNR) orders 
were common, although somewhat less common in the intervention group (85% vs 91%, P 
= .04). During 9 months follow-up there were 33 hospital or emergency transfers in the 
intervention group and 67 in the control group. Adjusting for person-days at risk, residents 
in the intervention group were half as likely to experience hospital transfers (0.078 vs 0.163 
transfers per 90 person-days; RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26–0.88). During 9 months follow-up, 33 
(22%) control residents and 27 (18%) intervention residents died; survival time did not differ 
significantly (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54–1.08; P = .13) (Figure 2).
Discussion
The GOC decision aid intervention was effective to improve quality of communication about 
end-of-life care for nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Over time, family 
decision makers in both arms increasingly chose comfort as the primary goal of care, but 
those with the GOC intervention experienced better communication and enhanced 
confidence that health care providers were prioritizing the same goal. They typically 
communicated with nurses or social workers, not physicians, reflecting current roles in 
nursing home care.
These study outcomes are aligned with widely endorsed measures of quality palliative 
care.23 Though improvements in quality of communication were modest, they were followed 
by greater attention to palliative care in treatment plans. The GOC intervention resulted in 
increased use of MOST to record goals of care and treatment choices. Though the 
intervention did not explicitly promote its use, the GOC intervention is consistent with 
MOST and may make it easier to introduce. This GOC study provides the first evidence that 
a decision aid can be used to enhance implementation of the POLST paradigm.24
The GOC intervention also resulted in half as many hospital transfers for nursing home 
residents with advanced dementia, without affecting survival. Residents in both study arms 
had severe underlying illness, but the GOC decision aid allowed families to consider options 
of hospitalization or care at the nursing home for acute illness. Hospital transfers were a 
secondary outcome, but the finding is important because persons with dementia have a high 
rate of transfers.25 Transitional care interventions have excluded persons with dementia, and 
the GOC intervention provides initial evidence that this outcome can be improved.26
Results from the GOC intervention are promising, yet they highlight elements of dementia 
palliative care that are in need of improvement. Family ratings of end-of-life communication

 improved, yet remained lower than QOC scores in intensive care units.27 While 
communication with nursing home staff was common, only 1 in 4 family decision makers 
talked with physicians. Lack of physician communication may account for continued gaps in 
the quality of end-of-life communication. Further, ratings of symptom management and care 
were fairly good, but unchanged. The GOC intervention addresses shared decision-making, 
but targeted interventions are needed to improve symptoms and comfort in patients with 
dementia.
The GOC study was an efficacy trial, but the intervention was designed for practical 
implementation in nursing homes.28 The video decision aid made evidence-based 
information easily accessible. After brief training, nursing home staff used a print guide to 
conduct all goals of care discussions. Further, the study was conducted in a diverse group of 
nursing homes, increasing potential for broad use. Finally, the intervention was designed to 
support shared decision making in a setting with limited physician presence, and to integrate 
with the national standardized care planning process for nursing home residents.29 The 
research was completed prior to Medicare reimbursement for advance care planning 
communication, but this policy change may enhance physician involvement in the future.
Limitations
Findings should be interpreted in the context of study limitations. Although sites had diverse 
characteristics, all were within a single state. Characteristics match national data on nursing 
homes, but the GOC intervention could be more or less effective in other regions. The GOC 
framework was chosen for its relevance to shared decision making in dementia care.30,31 
Alternative frameworks may be as or more useful to guide family decision makers. Interview 
questions about goals of care may have prompted some control families to seek discussions 
with nursing home clinicians, thus reducing measured effects of the intervention. Study 
findings apply to a long-stay population of residents who live in the nursing home, but 
should not be generalized to the short-stay rehabilitation population.
The GOC intervention was designed to rely on existing communication skills and strategies 
used in nursing homes. This study is the first randomized clinical trial to address dementia 
palliative care needs in nursing homes, and future research is needed to expand on these 
results. Less pragmatic, but potentially higher impact interventions could include 
communication skills training for staff, specialty palliative care consultation, or payment 
reform to engage physicians and nurse practitioners as active participants in interdisciplinary 
teams in nursing home care.
Conclusions
The GOC decision aid intervention was effective to improve quality of communication for 
nursing home residents with advanced dementia, and to improve elements of palliative care. 
Hospital transfers were reduced for these frail patients, without any adverse effects on 
survival. The GOC study provides evidence for a promising new approach to enhance shared 
decision making for nursing home residents with advanced dementia and for their families.

 Key Points
Question
Can a decision aid intervention about goals of care improve communication, decision-
making, and palliative care for patients with advanced dementia?
Findings
In this randomized trial of 302 nursing home residents with advanced dementia, family 
decision makers reported better end-of-life communication with clinicians. Clinicians 
were more likely to address palliative care in treatment plans, use Medical Orders for 
Scope of Treatment, and less likely to send patients to the hospital.
Meaning
The goals of care decision aid intervention is effective in improving quality of 
communication, palliative care treatment plans, and reducing hospitalization rates for 
nursing home residents with advanced dementia.
