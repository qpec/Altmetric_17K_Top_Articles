Dietary Supplements and Young 
Teens: Misinformation and 
Access Provided by Retailers
Maguire Herriman, Laura Fletcher, Alexis Tchaconas, Andrew Adesman, MD, Ruth Milanaik, DO
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendations 
against pediatric use of creatine and testosterone boosters, research suggests that many 
young teenagers take these dietary supplements. Our objective was to determine to what 
extent health food stores would recommend and/or sell creatine and testosterone boosters 
to a 15-year-old boy customer.
METHODS: Research personnel posing as 15-year-old high school athletes seeking to increase 
muscle strength contacted 244 health food stores in the United States via telephone. 
Researchers asked the sales attendant what supplements he/she would recommend. If a 
sales attendant did not mention creatine or testosterone boosters initially, each of these 
supplements was then specifically asked about. Supplement recommendations were 
recorded. Sales attendants were also asked if a 15-year-old could purchase these products 
on his own in the store.
RESULTS: A total of 67.2% (164/244) of sales attendants recommended creatine: 38.5% 
(94/244) recommended creatine without prompting, and an additional 28.7% (70/244) 
recommended creatine after being asked specifically about it. A total of 9.8% (24/244) 
of sales attendants recommended a testosterone booster. Regarding availability for sale, 
74.2% (181/244) of sales attendants stated a 15-year-old was allowed to purchase creatine, 
whereas 41.4% (101/244) stated one could purchase a testosterone booster.
CONCLUSIONS: Health food store employees frequently recommend creatine and testosterone 
boosters for boy high school athletes. In response to these findings, pediatricians should 
inform their teenage patients, especially athletes, about safe, healthy methods to improve 
athletic performance and discourage them from using creatine or testosterone boosters. 
Retailers and state legislatures should also consider banning the sale of these products to 
minors.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Teenage boy 
athletes often take supplements to improve their 
performance and typically purchase these supplements 
at health food stores. To date, however, no studies have 
analyzed the recommendations these stores make to 
young teenage boys about supplement use.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study documents that 
health food stores nationally often recommend age-
restricted supplements to young boy teenagers. It 
highlights the need to review how supplements are 
promoted and the important role pediatricians play in 
counseling youth about the risks of supplement use.

HERRIMAN et al 
Young boy athletes often perceive 
themselves as less muscular than 
their ideal body image, and therefore 
may take supplements to try to 
increase their muscle mass. 
1, 
 
2 In 
2005, Field et al 
3 reported that 12% 
of boys reported using supplements 
to improve appearance, muscle 
mass, or strength. More recently, in 
a 2012 study of 2793 adolescents at 
20 urban middle and high schools in 
Minnesota, 34.7% of boys reported 
using protein supplements, 5.9% 
used steroids, and 10.5% used some 
other muscle-enhancing substance. 
4 
Similar prevalences were noted in 
the recent Growing Up Today study; 
in this national cohort, 12% of boys 
13 to 18 years old reported using 
muscle-building products (ages 
13–15 years: 3.2%; ages 16–18 years: 
9.5%).5
Creatine is one of the most popular 
weight gain supplements among 
this age group; 8.8% to 21% of 
high school boy athletes report 
creatine use. 
6 
 
– 
9 In a study of 37 
public high schools in Wisconsin, 
30.1% of high school football 
players reported creatine use.6 
Clearly, there is widespread use 
of creatine among adolescents 
despite the recommendations of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
and the American College of Sports 
Medicine against creatine use by 
those <18 years of age. 
10, 
 
11 The 
physiologic effects claimed by dietary 
supplement companies in advertising 
and marketing are often not 
supported by research. 
12 Moreover, 
use of creatine and/or testosterone 
boosters may pose significant health 
risks to adolescents.
Although minimal research on 
adolescent creatine use is available, 
anecdotal evidence suggests that 
creatine may impair hepatic and 
renal function as well as cause 
dehydration and muscle cramps. 
13 
– 
15 
A systematic review by Lopez et al, 
 
16 
however, refuted the supposed causal 
connection between creatine use and 
dehydration. Creatine use has also 
been associated with an increased 
risk of compartment syndrome, a 
condition where pressure builds 
in a muscle compartment and 
prevents bloodlfow.17 Furthermore, 
because dietary supplements are 
subject to little oversight by the 
Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), the safety and efficacy of 
supplements available on the market 
are not rigorously established. 
18, 
 
19 
Pomeranz et al 
20 note that dietary 
workout supplements, such as 
creatine, are often adulterated with 
pharmaceutical drugs and can lead to 
adverse effects, such as hypertension, 
stroke, and liver injury.
An additional concern of adolescent 
creatine use is that teenagers often 
do not get their information on 
supplement use from physicians or 
dieticians, leading to improper usage 
against medical recommendations. 
20 
Smith and Dahm 
8 found that 78% of 
high school creatine users either did 
not know how much creatine they 
were taking or were intentionally 
taking more than the dose 
recommended on packaging provided 
by manufacturers. The same study 
found that 86% of creatine users 
purchased their creatine at a health 
food store and that high school users 
list friends and health food stores as 
their primary sources of information 
on creatine. 
8 These results suggest a 
great deal of misinformation among 
high school athletes regarding 
creatine use. In another study, 
physicians ranked behind other high 
school athletes, friends, parents, 
coaches, and teachers as information 
sources that discourage creatine use. 
6
Testosterone boosters are another 
workout supplement that are 
advertised as improving one’s 
strength and endurance, and 
therefore are also appealing to young 
boys. A testosterone booster is a type 
of herbal or synthetic supplement 
that increases testosterone levels 
in the bloodstream by either 
inducing the body to produce 
more testosterone or inhibiting 
the conversion of testosterone to 
estrogen. However, the efficacy 
and safety of these products 
are questionable. Research on 
supplemental use of testosterone 
boosters in adults has found that it 
can cause polycythemia, increased 
blood viscosity, prostatic hyperplasia, 
hepatotoxic effects, hepatic 
neoplasia and dysfunction, and the 
exacerbation or development of 
sleep apnea. 
21 In 1 study examining 
the effectiveness of the purported 
testosterone booster N-Methyl-D-
aspartate, investigators found it 
has no effect on body composition 
or muscle performance for those 
participating in resistance training. 
22 
Although less well studied, there 
are concerns that adolescent use 
of testosterone boosters can also 
cause the body to shut down its 
natural production of testosterone as 
well as increase acne and halt bone 
growth. 
23, 
 
24
Teens commonly get information 
about muscle supplements from 
health food stores and are most 
likely to purchase these supplements 
from these types of stores. 
8 Because 
many health food stores present 
their employees as “expert(s) in 
health and wellness products” 
25 
(GNC) or “knowledgeable, courteous, 
and extensively trained Health 
Enthusiasts ready to help with all 
your health and wellness needs” 
26 
(Vitamin Shoppe), teenagers may be 
led to believe that they are receiving 
the best possible advice. However, 
no research to date has investigated 
the quality of the information these 
health food stores provide to young 
customers. The current study aimed 
to fill this gap by determining what 
muscle gain supplements (if any) 
health food store personnel would 
recommend for a 15-year-old and the 
ability of a minor to purchase these 
supplements. The supplements of 
interest for this study were creatine 
and testosterone boosters, both of 
which are not recommended for 
adolescent populations by health care

health risks.
METHODS
Participants
This study identified 300 health 
food stores in the United States for 
inclusion in this study. Forty-nine 
states were included in the sample. 
The institutional review board (IRB) 
required that New Jersey be excluded 
due to pending state legislation that 
would ban the sale of creatine to 
minors (www. 
njleg. 
state. 
nj. 
us/ 
2006/ 
Bills/ 
S2000/ 
1951_ 
I1. 
PDF). In each 
of the other states, sale of creatine 
and testosterone boosters to minors 
was legal at the time of the study. 
Although Massachusetts introduced 
a bill in January 2015 to ban the sale 
of dietary supplements for weight 
loss or muscle building to minors, 
this study was conducted in August 
2014, before the introduction of 
that legislation (https://

pdf). Both the 
New Jersey and Massachusetts bills 
ultimately failed to be signed into 
law.
A health food store was defined as 
a store that primarily sells dietary 
supplements. This study divided 
health food stores into 2 categories: 
national chain and nonnational 
retailers. A national chain was 
defined as a retailer that operates 
at least 1 store in at least 45 states 
nationwide. Two national chains of 
health food stores were identified 
that fit this criterion. A nonnational 
retailer was any health food store 
that did not fit this criterion. 
Nonnational retailers may operate 
regionally or as independently owned 
and operated single-store locations. 
The initial national sample consisted 
of 200 national chain locations and 
100 nonnational retailers. Although 
the intent was to have 4 national 
chain stores in each state included 
in the study, in some states, <4 
eligible national chain stores could be 
identified. For these states, additional 
national chain stores were added 
from states in the same geographic 
region as the deficient state. The 4 
geographic regions defined by the 
US Census Bureau (Northeast, South, 
Midwest, and West) were used for 
this purpose. An additional 100 
nonnational retailers (25 per region) 
were identified using the Web site 
www. 
VPXSports. 
com. This Web site 
was used because it offers a registry 
of health food store locations that is 
searchable on a state-by-state basis.
From the initial sample of 300 stores, 
stores were excluded if they did not 
require that all employees were >18 
years of age. These age requirements 
were introduced at the direction of 
the IRB. The 2 national chain retailers 
included in this study require that 
sales attendants are at least 18 years 
old. For the nonnational retailers, 
a female researcher made initial 
screening calls to the 100 identified 
locations and asked about the age 
requirements for employment. Stores 
that employed minors or that were 
out of business were excluded. A 
store was considered out of business 
if researchers were not able to 
connect on a screening call after 3 
separate attempts during normal 
business hours. Sixty-six nonnational 
retailers were excluded by these 
criteria. The final sample consisted of 
244 health food stores, of which 200 
were national chain locations and 44 
were nonnational retailers.
Procedures
A 20-year-old male researcher 
contacted each health food store in 
the sample by phone during normal 
business hours. All calls were made 
during August 2014. Once a sales 
attendant answered the phone, the 
researcher identified himself as a 
15-year-old football player going 
into his sophomore year of high 
school. The researcher then stated 
that he was doing strength training 
and asked if the sales attendant 
had any products that he/she 
would recommend. Recommended 
products were documented. 
If the sales attendant did not 
initially mention creatine and/or 
a testosterone booster, then the 
researcher asked the sales attendant 
for recommendations regarding 
these products. Creatine and 
testosterone boosters were asked 
about in separate questions, and the 
sales attendants’ recommendations 
on each were documented. The 
researcher also asked whether 
he could purchase creatine or a 
testosterone booster on his own 
in the store. Again, the ability to 
purchase creatine or a testosterone 
booster without a parent or adult 
guardian was asked about in separate 
questions, and the sales attendant’s 
responses to both questions were 
documented.
This study protocol was approved 
by the IRB at North Shore–Long 
Island Jewish Health System. Our 
application to the IRB acknowledged 
the fact that the protocol required 
elements of deception and that 
informed consent could therefore 
not be obtained from respondents. 
Protocol modifications were 
required by the IRB to ensure that 
all respondents were >18 years 
of age, that the data would be 
de-identified with respect to the 
identity of the retailers, and that New 
Jersey would be excluded for fear of 
self-incrimination.
Data Handling and Statistical 
Analysis
For each retail store location, data for 
creatine and testosterone boosters 
were documented separately. If 
a sales attendant recommended 
not using a supplement either 
initially or after prompting, this was 
recorded as “recommend against.” 
If a sales attendant recommended 
a supplement after initially asking 
for any recommendations, this 
was recorded as “recommend 
without prompting.” If a sales 
3

Downloaded from 
 attendant did not spontaneously 
suggest a supplement initially, 
but then recommended it when 
asked specifically about it, this was 
recorded as “recommend after 
prompting.” Sales attendants who 
refused to make a recommendation 
over the phone were recorded as “no 
recommendation offered.”
For both creatine and testosterone 
boosters, the percentage of sales 
attendants in each of the 4 response 
categories detailed above was 
calculated. The percentage of sales 
attendants who stated that a 15-year-
old could purchase each supplement 
was also calculated. Responses were 
analyzed by region (Northeast, South, 
Midwest, or West), sex of the sales 
attendant (male or female), and type 
of store (national chain or nonnational 
retailer) using a difference in 
proportions hypothesis test. Results 
were considered significant at P < .05.
RESULTS
A national sample of 244 health food 
stores that primarily sell dietary 
supplements was contacted by 
phone. A total of 77.0% (188/244) 
of sales attendants contacted were 
classified as male by the research 
personnel making the phone calls.
In total, 67.2% of all sales attendants 
(164/244) recommended creatine for 
a 15-year-old boy. A total of 38.5% 
(94/244) recommended creatine 
without prompting. An additional 
28.7% (70/244) recommended 
creatine after prompting. A total of 
30.3% (74/244) of sale attendants 
recommended against creatine, 
whereas 2.5% (6/244) refused to 
make a recommendation on creatine 
use over the phone. A total of 74.2% 
(181/244) of sales attendants stated 
that a 15-year-old could purchase 
creatine on his/her own, whereas 
22.5% (55/244) stated one had to 
be ≥18 years of age to purchase 
creatine.
Overall, 9.8% (24/244) of all 
sales attendants recommended 
a testosterone booster. Only 2 
sales attendants recommended 
a testosterone booster without 
prompting, but 9.0% (22/244) 
recommended one after prompting. 
A total of 88.5% (216/244) of 
sales attendants recommended 
against a testosterone booster, and 
1.2% (3/244) refused to make a 
recommendation over the phone. 
A total of 41.4% (101/244) stated 
a 15-year-old could purchase a 
testosterone booster, and 55.7% 
(136/244) stated one needed to be 
≥18 years of age. Reasons given for 
why a teenager could not purchase 
one or both of these products included 
store policy and/or that the product(s) 
was not recommended for minors.
 
Table 1 summarizes sales attendants’ 
recommendations for creatine 
and testosterone boosters. Of 
the 164 sales attendants who 
recommended creatine, only 13.4% 
also recommended testosterone 
boosters. Twenty-two of the 24 
sales attendants who recommended 
testosterone boosters had also 
recommended creatine. Of the 2 
sales attendants who recommended 
a testosterone booster without 
prompting, 1 recommended creatine 
after prompting and 1 did not 
recommend creatine.
Although male sales attendants 
were significantly more likely 
to recommend creatine without 
prompting than female sales 
attendants (χ2 = 7.81, P = .005), 
no sex difference was found for 
creatine recommendation after 
prompting (χ2 = 0.33, P = .57). No sex 
difference was noted for testosterone 
booster recommendation. No other 
significant differences were found for 
either supplement when comparing 
results by region or store type.
Research personnel noted that 
in many instances, when asked 
if the teen caller could purchase 
either product independently, sales 
attendants reviewed the labels of 
the actual products or scanned the 
products at their checkout counter 
looking for additional information. 
Many sales attendants stated 
that although the label stated the 
supplement was not recommended 
for those <18 years of age, there 
was no prohibition on a minor 
purchasing it. One sales attendant 
said, “It’s not like I’m selling alcohol”; 
another noted that he is allowed to 
sell creatine and other weight gain 
supplements “to a 10-year-old.”
DISCUSSION
Teenagers are often unaware 
of health risks associated with 
specific supplements. Research 
has shown that they rely heavily 
on information provided by staff

at health food stores. 
4, 
 
8 Despite the 
American Academy of Pediatrics’ 
and the American College of Sports 
Medicine’s recommendations 
against adolescent use of creatine 
and testosterone boosters, most 
health food stores recommended 
≥1 of these products to a young 
teenage boy. Specifically, more than 
two-thirds of sales attendants in 
this study recommended creatine 
to a 15-year-old, and nearly 10% 
recommended a testosterone 
booster. More than one-third of sales 
attendants recommended creatine to 
young customers even without their 
expressing interest in it. Given that 
many health food stores claim that 
their sales attendants are experts in 
health and wellness products and 
emphasize the ability of their staff 
to provide consumer education, it is 
likely these recommendations will 
be accepted. Thus, recommendations 
from sales staff that run counter to 
product labeling and expert medical 
opinion pose potentially significant 
health risks to young teenagers who 
use creatine and/or testosterone 
boosters.
Not only are many health food 
stores making recommendations 
contrary to expert medical opinion, 
but pediatricians themselves rarely 
discuss supplements, such as 
creatine, with their patients. In a 
2001 cross-sectional survey of 37 
public high schools in Wisconsin, 
12% to 13% of football players 
reported that their physicians 
recommended against creatine use, 
whereas 8% to 9% stated their 
physicians recommended its use. 
The large majority of teen athletes 
either did not discuss creatine use 
with their physicians, or were neither 
encouraged nor discouraged from 
using it. 
4 Without proper counseling 
by physicians on the risks associated 
with supplement use, adolescents are 
likely to continue to use potentially 
dangerous supplements based on 
misguided information they receive 
from health food stores.
Just as health food stores were 
more likely to recommend creatine 
for use by teens compared with 
testosterone boosters, sales staff 
were far more likely to state that 
a 15-year-old could purchase 
creatine than a testosterone booster 
without an accompanying adult. 
Although product labels provided 
by supplement manufacturers often 
state the products are recommended 
for use only by adults, it is worth 
noting that there currently are no 
legal restrictions limiting sales of 
these supplements to minors. One 
sales attendant highlighted this lack 
of legal restrictions by comparing the 
sale of dietary supplements to other 
substances, stating, “It’s not like I'm 
selling alcohol.”
The comparison with alcohol is 
striking because, although state and 
federal laws regulate the sale of 
alcohol, cigarettes, and spray paint 
to minors, no regulation is placed on 
the sale of dietary supplements to 
minors. Supplements do not require 
safety approval by the FDA or other 
agencies before reaching store 
shelves, and the process of removing 
a dangerous supplement from the 
market is reactionary and delayed. 
18, 
 
20 
Furthermore, advertisements for 
supplements often fail to include 
required disclaimers and, when 
present, they are “often presented in 
a hard-to-find way, whether through 
tiny type or (on television) a fleeting 
appearance.” 
27, 
 
28 Inadequate product 
labeling, in conjunction with the fact 
that the majority of sales personnel 
are recommending these products to 
minors, increases the likelihood that 
parents and young adolescents will 
not get accurate information about 
the safety of these products.
Although the FDA is concerned 
about the marketing of dietary 
supplements in general, it does 
not have the authority (per the 
1994 Dietary Supplement Health 
and Education Act) to approve 
dietary supplements before they 
are marketed to consumers. The 
FDA can take actions only after a 
product is on the market in cases 
where the dietary supplement is 
adulterated (eg, unsafe), misbranded 
(eg, misrepresentations are made on 
the product labeling), or cannot be 
marketed as a dietary supplement 
(eg, an unapproved new drug). 
29 
Thus, under its current mandate, 
the FDA’s role with respect to 
dietary supplements is reactive, 
not proactive, thereby allowing 
for unprecedented growth in the 
development and marketing of these 
untested products. Because of the 
limited power of federal regulation, 
Pomeranz et al 
20 have suggested that 
individual states implement more 
proactive policies to keep children 
safe, such as imposing minimal 
age requirements on the purchase 
of dietary workout supplements 
similar to those placed on alcohol 
and cigarettes. Given that annual 
sales of dietary supplements in the 
United States have risen sixfold since 
1994 from $5.8 billion to about $35 
billion, greater consideration needs 
to be given to how these products are 
labeled and marketed to children and 
young adolescents.

CONCLUSIONS
Supplements, such as creatine and 
testosterone boosters, can pose 
significant health risks if used by 
young adolescents. These products 
are not recommended by some 
product manufacturers for anyone 
<18 years of age and should elicit 
warnings from medical professionals 
for individuals of any age due to 
the minimal regulation and safety 
screening for supplements. Yet, there 
are no legal restrictions at present 
limiting the sale of these products 
to minors. Of greater concern, 
these products are often being 
recommended to young teen athletes 
by the “product experts” at health 
food stores. Although these stores, 
like all retailers, are profit-conscious, 
they should give serious consideration 
5

Downloaded from 
  
HERRIMAN et al 
to revising their policies regarding 
recommending products like these 
to minors. This is especially true 
for the national retail chains, given 
their professed expertise and stated 
concern for consumer health and 
safety. Simple solutions could include 
improving the knowledge of their staff 
about supplements not recommended 
for youth, enabling their point-of-sale 
software to caution about use of these 
products by minors, and conducting 
audits to verify compliance with 
these policies. Furthermore, although 
the Massachusetts and New Jersey 
bills mentioned above that would 
have restricted the sale of creatine 
and other supplements to minors 
both failed to gain the power of law, 
states should consider introducing 
and passing similar legislation to 
address this problem. Until additional 
safeguards are introduced by retailers, 
states, or the FDA, pediatricians 
should counsel all adolescents, not 
just teen athletes, about the risks 
associated with supplement use.
