Summary
High-grade gliomas (HGG) are a devastating group of cancers, representing the leading cause of 
brain tumor-related death in both children and adults. Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to 
the glioma cell have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need to 
also target elements of the tumor microenvironment that promote glioma progression. We recently 
demonstrated that neuronal activity robustly promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and 
clinically distinct HGG types, including adult glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 
pediatric GBM, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)1. An important mechanism mediating 
this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic

 molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR 
pathway1. However, neuroligin-3 necessity to glioma growth, proteolytic mechanism of secretion 
and further molecular consequences in glioma remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate a 
striking dependence of HGG growth on microenvironmental neuroligin-3, elucidate signaling 
cascades downstream of neuroligin-3 binding in glioma and determine a therapeutically targetable 
mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of pediatric GBM, DIPG and adult 
GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. Neuroligin-3 stimulates numerous oncogenic 
pathways, including early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR, and induces 
transcriptional changes including upregulation of numerous synapse-related genes in glioma cells. 
Neuroligin-3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 
sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent release of neuroligin-3 into the tumor microenvironment 
and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting 
neuroligin-3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.
To determine the necessity of microenvironmental neuroligin-3 to glioma growth, we 
xenografted patient-derived HGG cells expressing GFP and luciferase into Nlgn3 knockout 
mice2 (Nlgn3y/−;NSG). Patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma xenografts (SU-pcGBM2) to 
the frontal cortex were monitored using in vivo bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging over the 
course of six months (Fig. 1a) and evaluated histologically (Fig. 1b). Initial engraftment was 
equivalent in neuroligin-3 KO and WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). A striking inhibition 
of glioma growth was evident in Nlgn3 KO animals for up to six months (Fig. 1a-f and 
Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). By 4.5 months, a subset of tumors circumvented this apparent 
neuroligin-3 dependency and began to exhibit growth (Fig. 1e,f, Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). 
The observed degree of growth inhibition was unexpected, as our previous work indicated 
that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also contributes to activity-regulated glioma 
proliferation1. Conditioned medium (CM) from optogenetically-stimulated acute cortical 
slices from Nlgn3 WT or KO;Thy1::ChR2 mice demonstrated that the increase in glioma 
cell proliferation induced by active CM is incompletely abrogated in the context of Nlgn3 
KO (Extended Data Fig. 2a), replicating the degree of differential proliferation previously 
accounted for by activity-regulated Bdnf1. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
glioma growth is more dependent on neuroligin-3 in vivo than would have been predicted 
from these in situ/in vitro experiments.
The nearly normal neurological function of Nlgn3 knockout mice3–5 is attributed to 
compensatory expression of other neuroligins2,6. We found no effect of NLGN1, 
NLGN4X/Y (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) or NLGN21 on glioma proliferation. Thus, 
compensatory expression of other neuroligins would not be expected to influence glioma 
growth, supporting a unique role for NLGN3 in glioma pathobiology.
To determine the role of neuroligin-3 in the growth of additional HGG types, patient-derived 
xenografts of DIPG (SU-DIPG-VI and SU-DIPG-XIII-FL) and adult glioblastoma (SU-
GBM035) were tested in the Nlgn3-deficient brain. We found that DIPG, xenografted to 
pons or to frontal cortex, and adult glioblastoma each exhibited marked growth stagnation in 
Nlgn3 KO mice (Fig. 1g-k). In contrast, patient-derived HER2+ breast cancer brain 
metastasis xenografts (DF-BM354)7 did not exhibit differential growth in Nlgn3 WT or KO

 brains (Fig. 1l). These results indicate a conserved dependency on neuroligin-3 across 
molecularly and clinically distinct types of HGG.
The observed growth inhibition is more robust than can be explained by known effects of 
NLGN3 on glioma PI3K-mTOR signaling1. To better delineate the signaling consequences 
of neuroligin-3 exposure in glioma, we utilized phophoproteomics (Fig. 2a, Extended Data 
Table 1). Phospho-antibody array analyses at 5 and 30-minutes following NLGN3 exposure 
revealed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and numerous phosphorylation 
events classically downstream of FAK, including activation of the SRC kinase cascade, 
PI3K-mTOR cascade, and SHC-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade (Fig. 2a). Additional 
oncogenic proteins exhibiting increased phosphorylation include integrin β3, growth factor 
receptors EGFR, FGFR and VEGFR, and others (Extended Data Table 1). FAK activity is 
central to many of these signaling events. Phospho-tyrosine pull-down analysis at 5-minutes 
following NLGN3 exposure similarly demonstrated FAK phosphorylation. FAK inhibition 
blocked the effects of NLGN3 on glioma proliferation (Fig. 2b-c). FAK phosphorylation 
peaked at 5-10 minutes following NLGN3 exposure, placing FAK early in the signaling 
cascade (Fig. 2d). FAK activity was necessary for PI3K stimulation by NLGN3 as 
demonstrated by AKTS473 phosphorylation (Fig. 2e).
We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) following glioma exposure to NLGN3. Genes 
involved in cell proliferation were upregulated, as were numerous genes known to promote 
malignancy in glioma, including PDGFA8–10, TTYH111 and several potassium channel 
genes12 (Extended Data Fig. 3). In addition to NLGN31, numerous genes involved in 
synapse function were upregulated following NLGN3 exposure (Extended Data Fig. 3). 
While the meaning of this intriguing observation remains to be clarified, it suggests the 
biology of NLGN3 may extend beyond the role of mitogen.
The dramatic glioma growth inhibition observed in the Nlgn3-deficient brain highlights its 
therapeutic potential. Blocking release into the tumor microenvironment is one therapeutic 
strategy, so we sought to determine the proteolytic and cellular details of neuroligin-3 
shedding. Full length neuroligin-3 is cleaved and secreted in an activity-regulated fashion 
with shedding of the N-terminal ectodomain1 (Fig. 3a-c). Optogenetic stimulation of acute 
cortical slices increased Nlgn3 shedding while the addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) inhibited 
Nlgn3 shedding (Fig. 3c).
Neuroligin-3 is highly expressed in both neurons and in oligodendrocyte precursor cells13 
(OPCs; Extended Data Fig. 4a), known to form bona fide synapses with presynaptic neurons 
and serve as a post-synaptic cell14–16. To test the relative contribution of neurons and OPCs 
to neuroligin-3 secretion, mice expressing cell type-specific, inducible Cre drivers were bred 
to Nlgn3fl/fl mice. Tamoxifen was administered for 5 days beginning at P28, resulting in 
recombination in ~40% of cortical neurons in the CamKIIa::CreER driver mouse and in 
~80% of OPCs in the PDGFRa::CreER driver mouse (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Using the 
acute slice paradigm together with inducible, conditional deletion of Nlgn3 from either 
neurons or from OPCs, we find that both cells types contribute to activity-regulated 
neuroligin-3 secretion, and notably OPCs are a major source of secreted neuroligin-3 (Fig.

 3d,e), defining a role for OPCs as a microenvironmental cell type contributing to glioma 
growth.
Neuroligin-3 exposure results in feed-forward glioma expression of NLGN31, and we thus 
asked if glioma cells contribute to the pool of secreted NLGN3. Elevated neuroligin-3 levels 
were found in CM from glioma xenograft-bearing, Nlgn3 WT brain slices compared to non-
xenograft-bearing slices (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). CM from NLGN3-primed glioma 
cultures also exhibit upregulated secretion (Extended Data Fig. 5c). In contrast, xenograft-
bearing brain slices from Nlgn3 KO mice secrete no detectable NLGN3 (Extended Data Fig. 
5b). These data indicate that glioma cells contribute to NLGN3 in the tumor 
microenvironment in a manner regulated by neuroligin-3 exposure from normal stromal 
cells.
To determine the enzyme responsible for the cleavage of neuroligin-3, we analyzed the c-
terminal transmembrane domain for putative cleavage sites (https://
prosper.erc.monash.edu.au/home.html). This indicated MMP and ADAM family proteases 
as candidate enzymes, a prediction consistent with the reported enzyme(s) responsible for 
Nlgn1 cleavage17,18 and neural ADAM10 targets19. Active slice CM generated in the 
absence and presence of various protease inhibitors exhibited decreased neuroligin-3 
shedding with MMP9 and ADAM10 inhibitors (Fig. 3f-g). Increased full-length neuroligin-3 
was observed in brain slice lysate concomitant with the observed decrease in cleaved 
neuroligin-3 in CM with either MMP9 or ADAM10 inhibitors (Fig. 3g). ADAM10 
inhibition blocks neuroligin-3 shedding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3h). Neither 
protease inhibitor directly affects glioma proliferation despite intrinsic expression of 
ADAM10 (Extended Data Fig. 5d). However, decreased neuroligin-3 levels in active CM in 
response to protease inhibition elicit correspondingly reduced proliferation of exposed 
glioma cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a-d), and add back of NLGN3 rescues proliferation 
(Extended Data Fig. 6d). MMP9 and ADAM10 thus emerge as candidate enzymes 
mediating neuroligin-3 cleavage.
Given the possibility of cross-inhibition with pharmacological protease inhibition, genetic 
models were employed to more definitively determine the proteolytic mechanism. Acute 
cortical slices from Mmp9 knockout mice showed no change in neuroligin-3 secretion (Fig. 
3i), suggesting that MMP9 is not responsible for neuroligin-3 cleavage. Conditional 
knockout of Adam10 from CamKIIa+ neurons resulted in ~50% decrease in secreted 
neuroligin-3 (Fig. 3j), whereas conditional deletion of Adam10 from OPCs did not influence 
neuroligin-3 secretion (Fig. 3k). Incubation with tetrodotoxin (TTX) substantially abrogates 
ADAM10 release into active slice CM (Fig. 3l), demonstrating activity-regulated release of 
ADAM10, a finding consistent with reports of ADAM10 localized to synaptic vesicles20. 
Taken together, these data indicate that ADAM10, released in activity-dependent fashion 
from neurons, is the chief enzyme responsible for neuroligin-3 shedding.
We next investigated the therapeutic potential of ADAM10 inhibition. ADAM10 is 
expressed in gliomas as reported in the literature21,22 and demonstrated in gene expression 
datasets from pediatric and adult HGG samples (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Cell-intrinsic 
effects of ADAM10 inhibition have been reported in adult HGG22–24, so we assessed

 possible direct effects of ADAM10 inhibition on the pHGG cells used here. ADAM10 
inhibition did not change proliferation, cell viability or invasion of pHGG cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 6e-g). ADAM10 inhibition mildly affected pHGG self-renewal (Extended Data 
Fig. 6h-i).
We next tested the influence of ADAM10 inhibition on HGG growth in vivo. Brain 
penetration of the specific ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X was assessed and found to be 
sufficient (Extended Data Table 2). Given effects of ADAM10 inhibition on glioma self-
renewal and therefore tumor initiation, drug treatment started well after engraftment. Mice 
bearing pediatric glioblastoma (SU-pcGBM2) or DIPG (SU-DIPGVI or SU-DIPG-XIX) 
orthotopic xenografts were treated with GI254023X or vehicle control. pGBM and both 
DIPG xenografts in mice treated with the ADAM10 inhibitor exhibited robust growth 
reduction compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4a-c). Histological analyses revealed 
reduced glioma proliferation in ADAM10 inhibitor-treated animals (Fig. 4d-e and Extended 
Data Fig. 7a). Furthermore, ADAM10 inhibition abrogated glioma cell secretion of 
neuroligin-3 from both xenograft-bearing brain slices and NLGN3-primed glioma cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b,c), suggesting this therapeutic strategy addresses all cellular sources 
of neuroligin-3.
ADAM10 inhibitors have been developed for clinical use, and the ADAM10/17 inhibitors 
INCB7839 and XL-784 have been through Phase II clinical trials for other diseases25,26. 
Brain penetration of INCB7839 was superior to XL-784 (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7b) 
and sufficient to inhibit ADAM10 enzymatic function25,26 (Fig. 4f). INCB7839 robustly 
inhibited growth of pGBM orthotopic xenografts (Fig. 4g). ADAM10 mediates cleavage of 
numerous cell surface proteins, prominently targeting synapse-associated proteins19, and 
also plays an important role in amyloid protein processing27. While ADAM10 inhibition 
appears well-tolerated in clinical trials25,26, and caused no overt neurotoxicity here 
(Extended Data Fig. 8), long-term effects on neurological function should be carefully 
evaluated.
The dependency of HGG growth on microenvironmental neuroligin-3 is conserved across 
multiple classes of pediatric and adult HGG (Supplementary Note 1). The magnitude of this 
effect both underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and suggests that the mechanisms 
by which NLGN3 promotes HGG growth (Fig. 4h) are incompletely understood. Future 
work will need to elucidate further mechanisms by which NLGN3 regulates glioma 
progression and clarify how the cancer may circumvent this dependency. Targeting the 
ADAM10 sheddase represents a potentially transformative strategy to modulate neuroligin-3 
levels in the tumor microenvironment for HGG therapy.
Methods
Mice and housing conditions
All in vivo experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the 
Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and performed 
in accordance with institutional guidelines. Animals were housed according to standard 
guidelines with free access to food and water in a 12-hour light/dark cycle. For brain tumor

 xenograft experiments, the IACUC does not set a limit on maximal tumor volume but rather 
on indications of morbidity; mice were euthanized if they exhibited signs of neurological 
morbidity or if they lost 15% or more of their body weight.
For constitutive Nlgn3 knockout studies, Nlgn3 KO mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were 
intercrossed with NSG mice (NOD-SCID-IL2R gamma chain-deficient, The Jackson 
Laboratory) to produce the Nlgn3 KO;NSG genotype. All Nlgn3 mouse model experiments 
were performed with male mice, either hemizygous WT Nlgn3 (Nlgn3y/+;NSG) or 
hemizygous null Nlgn3 littermates (Nlgn3y/−;NSG).
For conditional knockout experiments, Nlgn3fl/fl mice (a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Sudhof) 
or ADAM10fl/fl mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were crossed to CamKIIa:CreER (The 
Jackson Laboratory) or PDGFRa::CreER (The Jackson Laboratory). Cre+ or control Cre− 
floxed mice were treated with 100mg/kg tamoxifen i.p. for 5 days and experiments were 
performed 7 days after the end of treatment. Tamoxifen was given from postnatal day 28 
(P28) to P33 and brain slice experiments performed at P40.
Mmp9−/− mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used in brain slice experiments at P40. 
Thy1::ChR2 (Jackson Labs, line 18) were used in brain slice experiments at 4-7 weeks of 
age.
Bioluminescent imaging
For in vivo monitoring of tumor growth, bioluminescence imaging was performed using an 
IVIS imaging system (Xenogen). Mice orthotopically xenografted with luciferase-
expressing glioma cells were placed under isofluorane anesthesia and injected with luciferin 
substrate. Animals were imaged at baseline and randomized based on tumor size by a 
blinded investigator so that experimental groups contained an equivalent range of tumor 
sizes. All total flux values were then normalized to baseline values to determine fold change 
of tumor growth. Statistical analysis between tumor burden in each group was assessed 
using Student’s two-tailed t-test (parametric data) or Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric 
data). Based on the variance of xenograft growth in control mice, we used at least 3 mice per 
genotype to give 80% power to detect an effect size of 20% with at a significance level of 
0.05.
Orthotopic xenografting
Patient-derived DIPG cells (SU-DIPG-VI, from a pontine DIPG tumor or SU-DIPG-XIII 
FL, from a frontal lobe DIPG metastasis), adult glioblastoma cells, (SU-GBM035 cells) or 
HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis cells (DF-BM354 cells) expressing firefly luciferase 
were xenografted into the orthotopic location of derivation in Nlgn3y/+;NSG and 
Nlgn3y/−;NSG mice. A single-cell suspension from cultured neurospheres was prepared in 
sterile PBS immediately prior to the xenograft procedure. Animals at P34-36 were 
anesthetized with 1-4% isoflurane and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. The cranium was 
exposed via midline incision under aseptic conditions. 600,000 glioma cells in 3 μL sterile 
PBS were stereotactically implanted in either the premotor cortex (M2) (SU-pcGBM2, SU-
DIPG-XIII FL and SU-GBM035) or the pons (SU-DIPGVI and SU-DIPGXIX) through a 
31-gauge burr hole, using a digital pump at infusion rate of 0.4 μL/minute and 31-gauge

 Hamilton syringe. For breast cancer brain metastasis studies, 100,000 DF-BM354 cells were 
similarly xenografted in the premotor cortex. Stereotactic coordinates used were as follows: 
for premotor cortex, 0.5 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.75 mm deep 
to cranial surface; for pons, 1.0 mm lateral to midline, −0.8 mm posterior to lambda, −5.0 
mm deep to cranial surface. At the completion of infusion, syringe needle was allowed to 
remain in place for a minimum of 2 minutes, then manually withdrawn at a rate of 0.875 
mm/minute to minimize backflow of the injected cell suspension.
Perfusion and immunohistochemistry
Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal Avertin (tribromoethanol), then 
transcardially perfused with 20 mL of PBS. Brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
overnight at 4°C, then transferred to 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were embedded 
in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura) and sectioned in the coronal plane at 40 μm using a sliding 
microtome (Microm HM450; Thermo Scientific). For immunohistochemistry, coronal 
sections were incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 
in TBS) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Chicken anti-GFP (1:500, Abcam), Rat anti-
MBP (1:300, Abcam), Mouse anti-human nuclei clone 235-1 (1:100; Millipore), rabbit anti-
Ki67 (1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:200, Cell Signaling), or mouse anti-
NeuN (Millipore, 1:2000) were diluted in 1% blocking solution (1% normal donkey serum 
in 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Sections were then rinsed 
three times in 1X TBS and incubated in secondary antibody solution (Alexa 488 donkey 
anti-chicken IgG, 1:500 (Jackson Immuno Research); Alexa 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG, 
1:500 (Life Technologies); Alexa 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500 (Life Technologies); 
Alexa 594 donkey anti-rat IgG, 1:1000 (Life Technologies)) in 1% blocking solution at 4°C 
overnight. Sections were rinsed 3 times in TBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Mounting 
medium (Life Technologies).
Cell culture
For all human tissue studies, informed consent was obtained and tissue was used in 
accordance with protocols approved by the Stanford University or Dana Farber Cancer 
Institute Institutional Review Board (IRB). For all patient-derived cultures, short tandem 
repeat (STR) DNA fingerprinting was performed every three months to verify authenticity. 
The STR fingerprints and clinical characteristics for the patient-derived cultures used have 
been previously reported1 with the exception of SU-DIPG-XIX which is a H3.3K27M 
mutant tumor that was derived from the brainstem at the time of autopsy from a male who 
was 2 years of age at diagnosis, treated with radiotherapy and cabazitaxel, and survived 18 
months. STR fingerprint for SU-DIPG-XIX is: X/Y (AMEL), 10/11 (CSF1PO1), 13/14 
(D13S317), 9/13 (D16S539), 30/30 (D21S11), 11/12 (D5S818), 10/10 (D7S820), 9.3/9.3 
(TH01), 8/11 (TPOX), 17/18 (vWA). All cell cultures were routinely tested for mycoplasma.
All high-grade glioma cultures were generated as previously described1. In brief, tissue was 
obtained from high-grade glioma (WHO grade III or IV) tumors at the time of biopsy or 
from early post-mortem donations. Tissue was dissociated both mechanically and 
enzymatically and grown in a defined, serum-free medium designated “Tumor Stem Media 
(TSM)”, consisting of Neurobasal(-A) (Invitrogen), B27(-A) (Invitrogen), human-bFGF (20

(10 ng/mL) and PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) (Shenandoah) and heparin (2 ng/mL) (Stem Cell 
Technologies).
Breast cancer brain metastasis line, PDX DF-BM354, was provided by the Zhao lab and 
developed as previously described7.
Generation of conditioned medium from acute cortical slices
Conditioned medium was generated as previously described1. Mice (genotype varied based 
on experiment) between the ages of 4-7 weeks were briefly exposed to 4% isofluorane and 
immediately cervically dislocated and decapitated. Extracted brains were placed in 
oxygenated high-sucrose solution and sliced in 350-μm sections. Slices were then placed in 
buffering solution (aCSF) and allowed to recover for at least one hour. After recovery, slices 
were then moved into fresh aCSF in a 24-well plate and slices optogenetically stimulated 
using a blue-light LED to observe the effects of elevated neuronal activity (in the case of 
Thy1::ChR2 brain slices) or unstimulated to observe the effects of baseline neuronal activity. 
Following recovery, medium was conditioned for 30 minutes. For various experiments, 
conditioned medium was prepared in the presence of various protease inhibitors (described 
below) or tetrodotoxin at 1uM (Tocris). Surrounding medium was then collected for 
immediate use or frozen at −80°C for future experiments. All slice experiments were 
performed in three biological replicates unless otherwise indicated.
EdU incorporation assay
8-well chamber slides were coated with poly-L-lysine. Cells were then seeded at 40,000 
cells per well and exposed to various conditions based off the assay (aCSF, aCSF plus the 
relevant inhibitor (see below), active conditioned medium (conditioning methods vary by 
assay), recombinant NLGN3 (Origene Technolgies), NLGN1 (R&D Systems), NLGN4 
(R&D Systems), or NLGN4Y (R&D Systems)). 10 μM EdU was added to each well. Cells 
were fixed after 24 hours using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained using the Click-iT 
EdU kit and protocol (Invitrogen). Proliferation index was then determined by quantifying 
percentage of EdU labeled cells using confocal microscopy at 200× magnification. Group 
mean differences were otherwise assessed using one-way analysis of variance (one-way 
ANOVA) with Tukey’s post-hoc tests to further examine pairwise differences. All 
experiments were performed in three biological replicates.
CellTiter-Glo assay of cell viability
To assess overall cell number, 5000 glioma cells were seeded in minimal growth medium in 
a 96-well plate with varying concentrations of ADAM10 inhibitor. After 24, 48, or 72 hours, 
CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added at a 1:1 ratio. Luminescence was measured after 
10-minute incubation at room temperature to stabilize signal. All experiments were 
performed in three biological replicates.

Analysis of NLGN3 secretion from glioma
For in vivo studies demonstrating NLGN3 secretion from xenograft-bearing slices, mice 
were xenografted as above with SU-DIPG-XIII or SU-GBM035 cells in premotor cortex. 
Brains were extracted and used for conditioned medium experiments in comparison to non-
xenografted littermate controls at 5 months (SU-DIPG-XIII) or 6 weeks (SU-GBM035). 
These experiments were performed in duplicate for SU-DIPG-XIII xenograft-bearing 
cortical slices and in triplicate for SU-GBM035 xenograft-bearing cortical slices (five 
biological replicates in total). For in vivo studies demonstrating neuroligin secretion from 
xenograft-bearing slices can be blocked by ADAM10 inhibition, mice were xenografted as 
above with SU-GBM035 cells in premotor cortex and brains were extracted at 6 weeks post 
xenograft. Cortical slices were made and incubated in the presence or absence of 200nM 
ADAM10 inhibitor, GI 254023X. CM was then analyzed using Western blot analyses, 
comparing non-xenograft bearing slices to xenograft-bearing slices from WT or Nlgn3 KO 
mice in the presence of absence of ADAM inhibitor. These experiments were performed in 
triplicate.
For in vitro studies of NLGN3 secretion from glioma cells, SU-pcGBM2 cells were seeded 
at 5 million cells/well in the presence of either vehicle, 100nM recombinant NLGN3, 
200nM GI 254023X, or 100nM NLGN3 + 200nM GI254023X for 48 hours. After thorough 
rinsing of the cells, cells were left in either fresh medium or 200nM GI 254023X for another 
48 hours in the presence or absence of ADAM10 inhibition. After 48 hours, medium was 
collected and analyzed for presence of cleaved NLGN3 using Western blot analyses as 
described below. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates.
Spheroid invasion assay was performed as previously described12.
Neurosphere formation assay
ELDA (extreme limiting dilution analysis) was performed to evaluate self-renewal 
capacity30. SU-pcGBM2 cells were dissociated in TrypLE (+ DNase and HEPES) for 5min 
at 37C. Cells were triturated into a single cell solution. The solution was incubated with 
Hoechst (Thermo, cat. 33342) for 30min at 37°C. Live cells were identified using a LIVE/
DEAD staining kit (Thermo, cat. L10119). Live cells were sorted into 96 well plates. 
Spheres were counted at 14 days. Cell density per well ranged from: 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 
500, 1000. Each condition was tested in 10 independent wells. Volume of medium per well 
was 200 μl medium with growth factors spike-ins every 3-4 days. The ADAM10 inhibitor 
was reconstituted in DMSO. Each well was adjusted to have 0.1% DMSO, except for the no-
DMSO control wells. Neurosphere-forming capability was determined using the Extreme

Western Blot analyses
Western blot analyses were used to probe for protein levels present in either brain slice 
homogenate or secreted into slice conditioned medium. For slice homogenates, brain slices 
were lysed using RIPA buffer and protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 
minutes and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4°C. All samples were normalized to protein 
concentration, mixed with Laemmli loading buffer (1:4), boiled for 5 minutes, and loaded 
onto BioRad Mini-Protean TGX precast gels. Protein was transferred to PVDF membranes 
and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST for one hour. Anti-Neuroligin-3 
(NovusBio; 1:250), Anti-phospho FAK pTyr861 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:500), and anti-
FAK (Cell Signaling Technologies; 1:500), or anti-ADAM10 (Abcam; 1:500) were diluted 
in 1% BSA/TBST and incubated with the membrane overnight. Secondary anti-rabbit 
conjugated to HRP (BioRad) was then added for one hour (1:1000). Proteins were visualized 
using Clarity ECL Western Substrate (BioRad) and quantified and analyzed using ImageJ.
Phospho-antibody array
The Phospho Explorer antibody array assay was performed by Full Moon Biosystems on 
patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma (SU-pcGBM2) cells. Cell lysates were prepared using 
Protein Extraction Kit (Full Moon BioSystems). Clear supernatant of the lysates was 
separated, biotinylated, and incubated with Phospho Explorer Antibody Arrays (Full Moon 
BioSystems) for two hours at room temperature. The array slides were washed with Wash 
Buffer (Full Moon BioSystems) and rinsed with DI water. The slides were then incubated 
with Cy3-Streptavidin for 45 minutes at room temperature, then washed, rinsed and dried. 
Arrays were scanned on GenePix Array Scanner (Molecular Devices). Image quantification 
was performed on GenePix Pro (Molecular Devices). Signal intensity data for each spot on 
the array was extracted from array images. Since there are two replicates printed for each 
antibody, the mean signal intensity of the replicates is determined. The data is then 
normalized to the median value (signal intensity) of all antibodies on the slide. Finally, fold 
change between Control Sample and Treatment Sample is determined using the normalized 
data (Treatment Sample’s signal is divided by Control Sample’s signal).
Phospho-tyrosine pull down assay—Samples were analyzed using the Cell Signaling 
Technology PTMScan method as previously described31–33. Cellular extracts were prepared 
in urea lysis buffer, sonicated, centrifuged, reduced with DTT, and alkylated with 
iodoacetamide. 15mg total protein for each sample was digested with trypsin and purified 
over C18 columns for enrichment with the Phosphotyrosine pY-1000 antibody (#8803) and 
the PTMScan Direct Tyr Kinases Reagent33. Enriched peptides were purified over C18 
STAGE tips (Rappsilber). Enriched peptides were subjected to secondary digest with trypsin 
and second STAGE tip prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.
Replicate injections of each sample were run non-sequentially for each enrichment. Peptides 
were eluted using a 90-minute linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid delivered 
at 280 nL/min. Tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner with an

 LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer running XCalibur 2.0.7 SP1 using a top-twenty 
MS/MS method, a dynamic repeat count of one, and a repeat duration of 30 sec. Real time 
recalibration of mass error was performed using lock mass34 with a singly charged 
polysiloxane ion m/z = 371.101237.
MS/MS spectra were evaluated using SEQUEST and the Core platform from Harvard 
University35–37. Files were searched against the NCBI rattus norvegicus FASTA database 
updated on May 22, 2015. A mass accuracy of +/−5 ppm was used for precursor ions and 
1.0 Da for product ions. Enzyme specificity was limited to trypsin, with at least one LysC or 
tryptic (K- or R-containing) terminus required per peptide and up to four mis-cleavages 
allowed. Cysteine carboxamidomethylation was specified as a static modification, oxidation 
of methionine and phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues were allowed 
as variable modifications. Reverse decoy databases were included for all searches to 
estimate false discovery rates, and filtered using a 5% FDR in the Linear Discriminant 
module of Core. Peptides were also manually filtered using a -/+ 5ppm mass error range and 
reagent-specific criteria. For each antibody reagent results were filtered to include only 
phosphopeptides matching the sequence motif(s) targeted by the antibodies included. All 
quantitative results were generated using Progenesis V4.1 (Waters Corporation) to extract 
the integrated peak area of the corresponding peptide assignments. Accuracy of quantitative 
data was ensured by manual review in Progenesis or in the ion chromatogram files.
RNA Sequencing—Samples were processed and analyzed as previously described12 with 
minor modifications as indicated below:
RNA was extracted from Trizol-lysed cells and 1 μg of total RNA was used for each sample. 
Polyadenylated RNA was selected using Ambion Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (Life 
Technologies 61006) and fragmented with Fragmentation Buffer (Ambion, #AM8740). First 
strand synthesis was performed using Random Hexamer Primers (Invitrogen, #48190-011) 
and SuperScript II (Invitrogen, #18064-014). Second strand synthesis was performed using 
DNA Pol I (Invitrogen #18010-025) and RNA was removed using RNaseH (Invitrogen 
#18021-014).
Libraries were end-repaired, 3′ A-tailed, and ligated to NEBNext Multiplex Oligo Adaptors 
(NEB E7335S). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 by Stanford 
Functional Genomics Facility.
Reads were mapped to hg19 annotation using Tophat238 (version 2.0.13) and transcript 
expression was quantified against RefSeq gene annotations using featureCounts39. 
Differential testing and log2 fold change calculation was performed using DESeq240 with 
default multiple hypothesis adjustment to reduce false positives (Benjamini-Hochberg, FDR 
= 0.1). Gene Ontology analyses were performed using DAVID41,42.
Pharmacokinetic studies

 chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Tissues samples were weighed 
and 1 volume of bullet blender beads (Next Advance) and 3 volume of Milli-Q water were 
added. Tissues were homogenized by a bullet blender (Next Advance) at 4°C according to 
manufacturer’s instruction. The neat stock solution of GI254023X was dissolved in DMSO 
at 5 mg/ml and further diluted in 50% methanol to prepare spiking solutions. For spiked 
standard curve, 25 μl of GI254023X spiking solutions (0.5 - 1000 ng/ml for brain samples 
and 1 – 100 μg/ml for serum and kidney samples) was mixed with 25 μl of blank tissue 
homogenate or serum. For samples, the spiking solution was replaced by 25 μl of 50% 
methanol to make up the volume. After vortexing all standards and samples, 150 μl of 
methanol/acetonitrile 20:80 (v/v) was added to the mixture and vortexed vigorously for 1 
min followed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted 3 times in 
Milli-Q water for brain samples and 100 times in 25% methanol for serum and kidney 
samples. The LC-MS/MS system consists of a QTRAP 4000 mass spectrometer (AB 
SCIEX) coupled to a Shimadzu UFLC system. LC separation was carried out on a 
ZORBAX SB-Phenyl column (4.6 mm × 50 mm, 3.5 μm) (Agilent) at room temperature. 
The analysis time was 3 min. The injection volume was 5-10 μl. Isocratic elution was carried 
out with a mobile phase composed of 55% water and 45% acetonitrile with 0.1% of formic 
acid and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode 
with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) with the transition m/z 392.2→361.2. Data 
acquisition and analysis were performed using the Analyst 1.6.1 software (AB SCIEX).
LC-MS/MS analysis of INCB7839 (Aderbasib) and XL-784 in brain tissue and 
serum: Aderbasib was purchased from Astatech, Inc. XL-784 was provided by True 
Pharmachem, Inc. A single 50 mg/kg dose of INCB7839 (aderbasib) or XL-784 was 
delivered i.p. in NOD-SCID-IL2R γ chain–deficient (NSG) mice, and tissue samples 
collected at various time points for analysis using liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). NSG mice were purchased from the Model Animal Research 
Center of Nanjing University. Study was conducted by Crown Biosciences, Inc. in 
accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC) of CrownBio and in accordance with the regulations of the Association for 
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Compounds were 
formulated in 2% DMSO, 2% Tween 80, 48% PEG300, 48% water. Compounds were 
administered i.p., with a dosing volume of 10 μL/g and concentration of 5 mg/ml. 
Compounds were dosed at 50 mg/kg. A cohort of 24 male, NSG mice, age 6-8 weeks, body 
weight 18-22 grams, were used for each study. Animals were housed at room temperature, 
under 40-70% humidity, with a 12 hour light/12 hour dark schedule. Mice were fed with 
Co60 dry granule food, with free access to reverse osmosis water. Eight time points were 
collected for each compound (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h), with an n=3 for each time 
point. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture and collected into potassium-EDTA 
Eppendorf tubes. Samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes to afford plasma samples. 
Brains were collected at each time point, PBS (4X) was added, and the material 
homogenized with a Tissue Lyser II to give a fine homogenate. Brain homogenate (50 μL) 
was treated with 250 μL acetonitrile (containing 200 ng/mL tolbutamide), which was then 
vortexed and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and 
mixed with a 0.1% aqueous formic acid solution. Samples were analyzed on a Waters UPLC

 or Agilent 1200 Liquid chromatography system, with an API 4000 mass spectrometer, and a 
10 μL injection volume, with tolbutamide as an internal standard. Pharmacokinetics were 
analyzed using WinNonlin6.3 (non-compartmental model).
Mouse drug treatment studies: For all drug studies, NSG mice were xenografted as above 
with either SU-pcGBM2, SU-DIPGVI, or SU-DIPG-XIX cells. Four weeks post-xenograft, 
animals were treated with either systemic administration of ADAM10 inhibitor, GI254023X 
(Sigma-Aldrich; formulated in 10% DMSO in 0.1M carbonate buffer) via intraperitoneal 
injection 5 days per week at 100mg/kg or systemic administration of ADAM10/17 inhibitor, 
INCB7839 (Astatech, Inc; formulated in 2% DMSO, 2% Tween 80, 48% PEG300, 48% 
water) via intraperitoneal injection 5 days per week at 50mg/kg. For both studies, controls 
were intraperitoneally injected with an identical volume of vehicle. Drug treatment began 
four weeks after xenografting and continued through week six. Bioluminescence imaging 
was performed by a blinded investigator before treatment, and again 7 days and 14 days 
later, using an IVIS imaging system (Xenogen) under isoflurane anesthesia. Similar to 
above, tumor burden was assessed as fold change in total flux from the beginning to end of 
treatment. All differences were statistically verified using Students two-tailed t-test.
Confocal imaging and quantification of cell proliferation: Cell quantification was 
performed by a blinded investigator using live counting at 400× magnification using a Zeiss 
LSM700 scanning confocal microscope and Zen 2011 imaging software (Carl Zeiss Inc.). 
The area for quantification was selected as follows: of a 1 in 6 series of 40-μm coronal 
sections, 3 consecutive sections were selected at approximately 1.1–0.86 mm anterior to 
bregma (Figures 22, 23, 24; Franklin & Paxinos, The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic 
Coordinates, 3rd Ed. 2008); using our stereotactic coordinates for tumor xenograft, these 
sections are expected to include the tissue most proximal to the site of tumor cell 
implantation in the coronal plane. For each of the three consecutive sections, the cingulum 
bundle was first identified as an anatomic landmark, and six 160×160-μm field area for 
quantification were selected centered around this landmark within cortical layer 6b of M2. 
Within each field, all human nuclear antigen (HNA)-positive tumor cells were quantified to 
determine tumor burden within the areas quantified. HNA-positive tumor cells were then 
assessed for double-labeling with or Ki67. To calculate proliferation index (the percentage 
of proliferating tumor cells for each animal), the total number of HNA-positive cells co-
labeled with Ki67 across all areas quantified was divided by the total number of human 
nuclei-positive cells counted across all areas quantified. Differences in proliferation indices 
were calculated using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests (parametric data) or Mann-
Whitney test (non-parametric data).
Statistical Analyses: Statistical tests were conducted using Prism (GraphPad) software 
unless otherwise indicated. Gaussian distribution was confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk 
normality test. For parametric data, unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests and one-way 
ANOVAs with Tukey’s post-hoc tests to further examine pairwise differences were used. For 
non-parametric data, two-sided Mann-Whitney test was used. The limiting dilution assay to 
test for neurosphere forming capacity was analyzed with a chi-squared test using the 
Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) web-based tool (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/

 software/elda/). A level of P < 0.05 was used to designate significant differences. Based on 
the variance of xenograft growth in control mice, we used at least 3 mice per genotype to 
give 80% power to detect an effect size of 20% with a significance level of 0.05. For all 
animal experiments, the number of independent mice used are listed in figure legend. For all 
Western blots, analyses were done in biological triplicate, except in the case of Figure 2d-e 
and Extended Figure 6a, where analyses were done in biological duplicates and technical 
triplicates.
Statistical analyses for proteomic and RNA-seq data are described above in the respective 
sections.

appeared morphologically normal and non-pyknotic. Extremely few cleaved caspase-3+ 
cells were identified in either group; a total of one cleaved caspase-3+ cell was found in each 
group across all mice examined (white arrows). Scale bar = 200 μm.
