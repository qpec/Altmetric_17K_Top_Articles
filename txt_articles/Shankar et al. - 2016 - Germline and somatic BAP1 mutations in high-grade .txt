Germline and somatic BAP1 mutations in high-grade 
rhabdoid meningiomas
Abstract
Background. Patients with meningiomas have widely divergent clinical courses. Some entirely recover following 
surgery alone, while others have relentless tumor recurrences. 
This clinical conundrum is exemplified by rhabdoid 
meningiomas, which are designated in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours as high grade, 
despite only a subset following an aggressive clinical course. Patient management decisions are further exac-
erbated by high rates of interobserver variability, biased against missing possibly aggressive tumors. Objective 
molecular determinants are needed to guide classification and clinical decision making.
Methods. To define genomic aberrations of rhabdoid meningiomas, we performed sequencing of cancer-related 
genes in 27 meningiomas from 18 patients with rhabdoid features and evaluated breast cancer [BRCA]1–associated

Shankar et al.: Germline and somatic BAP1 mutations in high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas
protein 1 (BAP1) expression by immunohistochemistry in 336 meningiomas. We assessed outcomes, ger-
mline status, and family history in patients with BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas.
Results. The tumor suppressor gene BAP1, a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase, is inactivated in a subset 
of high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas. Patients with BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas had reduced 
time to recurrence compared with patients with BAP1-retained rhabdoid meningiomas (Kaplan–Meier analy-
sis, 26 mo vs 116 mo, P < .001; hazard ratio 12.89). A subset of patients with BAP1-deficient rhabdoid men-
ingiomas harbored germline BAP1 mutations, indicating that rhabdoid meningiomas can be a harbinger of 
the BAP1 cancer predisposition syndrome.
Conclusion. We define a subset of aggressive rhabdoid meningiomas that can be recognized using routine 
laboratory tests. We implicate ubiquitin deregulation in the pathogenesis of these high-grade malignancies. 
In addition, we show that familial and sporadic BAP1-mutated rhabdoid meningiomas are clinically aggres-
sive, requiring intensive clinical management.

Meningiomas are the most common primary tumor of the 
CNS and comprise over a dozen subtypes.1 The genetic 
aberrations that drive tumorigenesis have been identified 
for many of the common benign subtypes, but not for some 
of the rare World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and III 
subtypes for which achieving surgical cure is less likely.2–7 
While many meningiomas are sporadic, some arise as part 
of tumor predisposition syndromes such as neurofibroma-
tosis type 2 due to mutations in NF2 
8 and familial multiple 
meningioma syndrome due to mutations in SMARCE1.6,9 
Identifying patients with inherited forms of meningiomas 
can illuminate the pathogenesis of these tumors as well as 
guide genetic counseling.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the patterns of 
mutations and chromosomal aberrations in many spo-
radic meningiomas are strongly associated with distinct 
histologic subtypes as well as the location of the tumors 
within the CNS.3,4,7 Anterior skull base meningiomas often 
harbor mutations in SMO or in the ubiquitin ligase TRAF7. 
Mutations in AKT1, PIK3CA, or KLF4 often co-occur with 
TRAF7 mutations.4,7 Posterior skull base meningiomas 
and meningioma of the cerebral convexities often harbor 
sporadic mutations in NF2, and such meningiomas often 
display fibroblastic histology. Angiomatous meningiomas 
generally lack NF2 mutations but have multiple chromo-
somal polysomies.2
Rhabdoid meningioma is a meningioma subtype10,11 
codified in the WHO Classification of Tumours as a highly 
aggressive grade III malignancy with high rates of recur-
rence and mortality. However, clinical experience suggests 
that meningiomas with rhabdoid features are biologically 
heterogeneous; some tumors have anaplastic high-grade 
histologic features, while others lack overt features of 
malignancy.12 Those lacking anaplastic features appear to 
follow a benign clinical course, even if rhabdoid features 
are well developed and extensive throughout the tumor.12 
Defining the rhabdoid meningioma subtype is also con-
founded by their rarity and heterogeneity, leading to signif-
icant variations in diagnosis,13 with attendant implications 
for determining which patients require adjuvant therapy. 
Therefore, understanding the genetic drivers of high-grade 
rhabdoid meningiomas would more precisely facilitate 
diagnosis, prognosis, and management for patients with 
meningiomas.
Methods
Pathologic Examination and Clinical History
Histopathologic diagnosis and tumor purity were con-
firmed by review of the hematoxylin and eosin stained 
Importance of the Study
Meningiomas with rhabdoid features represent a class 
of potentially aggressive tumors with high rate of recur-
rence, though not all meningiomas with these histolog-
ic findings display the same natural history. To under-
stand the molecular signature that discriminates this 
spectrum of clinical course, we performed a genomic 
characterization of rhabdoid meningiomas. We show 
that the tumor suppressor gene BAP1 is inactivated 
in 6 high-grade, rhabdoid meningiomas. In addition to 
patients with somatic BAP1 loss, 2 patients carried 
germline mutations, indicating that such meningiomas 
can arise as part of the BAP1 cancer predisposition 
syndrome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BAP1 
loss can be detected by immunohistochemistry, and 
the addition of this routine test can help risk-stratify 
which patients require intensive clinical management 
with close surveillance and consideration for adjuvant 
therapies.

sections by 2 neuropathologists (S.S., M.A.) and a sub-
set of cases were reviewed by R.A.V, A.P
, and C.G. 
Information of the clinical history was collected from 
the patients’ electronic medical records. This study was 
approved by the human subject institutional review board 
of the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, 
Massachusetts General Hospital, the Mayo Clinic, and the 
University of California–San Francisco.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using a 
commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody to 
BAP1 (C-4; Santa Cruz #sc-28383) on paraffin-embedded 
formalin-fixed tissue. Staining details can be found in the 
Supplementary materials. Cases were scored as negative 
for BAP1 when staining was lost in essentially all or nearly 
all (>95%) cells that were overtly tumor cells. Staining was 
deemed technically successful in cases with BAP1 immu-
noreactive stromal cells such as fibroblasts, lymphocytes, 
and endothelial cells, which serve as a robust and reliable 
positive control for staining.
DNA Sample Preparation
DNA was prepared using standard techniques as described 
in the Supplementary materials.
Targeted Exome Sequencing
Samples RM-6, RM-15, RM-16, and RM-5924 were 
sequenced using one of 2 different assays as previously 
described2,14 (see Supplementary materials). Sequencing 
was performed to a mean depth of 80X and analysis was 
performed as previously described.2,14 Raw sequencing 
data were processed using the Picard tools pipeline and 
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).15,16 Mutation analy-
sis for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was performed 
using MuTect v1.1.417; indel calling was performed using 
the GATK SomaticIndelDetector tool; SNVs and indels 
were annotated using Oncotator. To analyze somatic copy 
number alterations from whole exome data, we used the 
ReCapSeg algorithm, which assesses homologue-specific 
copy ratios (HSCRs) from segmental estimates of multi-
point allelic copy ratios at heterozygous loci incorporating 
the statistical phasing software (Beagle) and population 
haplotype panels (HapMap3).18–20
Whole Exome Sequencing and Phylogenetic 
Analysis
Whole exome sequencing for RM-23 and RM-31 and 
matched normal DNA from the corresponding patients 
was performed using Broad Institute platforms as pre-
viously described.3 Libraries were constructed and 
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 76 bp paired-end 
reads as previously described.21,22 Reads were aligned 
using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, de-multiplexed with 
Picard tools, and sorted using Samtools. Quality control 
and germline single nucleotide polymorphism finger-
printing were conducted using the previously described 
firehose pipeline.21 Somatic mutations were called using 
MuTect22 and Strelka.23 Somatic copy number altera-
tions for individual alleles were inferred from sequenc-
ing read depth of whole exome sequencing data, and 
cancer-cell fraction values for each mutation were inferred 
from allelic fractions and corresponding copy number 
alterations using Absolute v1.2 as previously described.20 
Phylogenetic trees were generated based on somatic 
mutations only using a branched-sibling evolutionary 
model under the assumption that related cancer tissues 
are descended from a common ancestral clone.24 Data, 
including sequence data and analyses, will be avail-
able for download from the database of Genotypes and 
Phenotypes (dbGaP).
Array-Based Comparative Genomic Hybridization 
Analysis
To confirm the single copy loss of a large portion of 3p 
that was inferred from sequencing data, we performed 
array-based comparative genomic hybridization on sam-
ples from RM-23 using a stock 1 × 1M Agilent SurePrint 
G3 Human CGH Microarray chip in a lab certified by the 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments as previ-
ously described.2,25
Loss of Heterozygosity Analysis
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was performed 
using standard methodologies as described in the 
Supplementary materials.
Statistical Analysis
We performed statistical analyses using standard method-
ologies as described in the Supplementary materials.
Results
We sequenced 560 cancer-associated genes in 14 meningi-
omas that had been diagnosed as rhabdoid meningioma 
or meningioma with some degree of rhabdoid features 
and performed LOH analysis (Supplementary Table 1, 
Supplementary Fig. 1). This discovery cohort reflected the 
nosologic uncertainty prevalent in this tumor subtype. In 
some cases, rhabdoid features were suggestive but not 
definitive; in others, focal clusters of rhabdoid cells were 
noted; and in others rhabdoid cells with well-developed 
features were widespread and associated with grade 
I, II, or III features. We determined whether the rhabdoid 
features were present in <20%, 20%–50%, or >50% of the 
tumor cells.
We detected a total of 749 nonsynonymous variants and 
47 insertions/deletions (Supplementary Tables 2, 3). In 8 
samples without grade III anaplastic features but with rhab-
doid or “rhabdoid-like” cells, we identified chromosome 22 
  538
Shankar et al.: Germline and somatic BAP1 mutations in high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas
LOH (Supplementary Fig. 1). We detected nonsynonymous 
variants in the NF2 gene in 5 of these 8 specimens and the 
AKT1 E17K mutation in 4/14 mutually exclusive specimens 
(Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 1). None of 
these specimens was noted to have mutations in the TERT 
promoter. Thus, the principal genetic aberrations in this 
diverse collection of meningiomas with rhabdoid features 
overlapped with those already reported in more common 
subtypes.3,4
However, in one sample (RM-5924) with distinct ana-
plastic histology including well-developed rhabdoid cells 
and poorly differentiated cells (Supplementary Fig. 2), 
we detected a splice-site mutation in the BAP1 gene 
(p.G220_splice; Fig. 1; Supplementary 
Tables 2, 3), a tumor 
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.26–28 This tumor 
had copy neutral chromosome 3 LOH, maintaining 2 cop-
ies of mutant BAP1 consistent with endoreduplication 
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
Furthermore, we analyzed BAP1 protein expression 
using IHC in this cohort of 14 meningiomas with rhabdoid 
features. Samples lacking genetic aberrations in BAP1 had 
intact BAP1 expression. However, in sample RM-5924, 
BAP1 was lost in the tumor cells in both the rhabdoid and 
poorly differentiated tumor nuclei (Fig. 1a; Supplementary 
Fig. 2), with retained expression in nonneoplastic nuclei 
providing a positive internal control.
Germline mutations in BAP1 result in a tumor predispo-
sition syndrome, which confers a high risk for developing 
a variety of tumors, including uveal and cutaneous mela-
noma, lung adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma, renal cell 
carcinoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma.26,29–32 When 
we reviewed the medical record of the patient affected by 
rhabdoid meningioma RM-5924, we found that her father 
had a mesothelioma. Consistent with this family history, 
we detected the p.G220 splice-site BAP1 mutation in the 
patient’s constitutional DNA (Supplementary 
Table 1).
To assess the frequency of BAP1 loss by IHC in rhabdoid 
meningiomas, we collected a set of 57 samples from 47 
patients who had been diagnosed with rhabdoid men-
ingioma or meningioma with some degree of rhabdoid 
features determined by the reviewing surgical patholo-
gist (Supplementary Table 4). Similar to our discovery 
set, the tumors had considerably heterogeneous histol-
ogy. We performed BAP1 IHC on these tumors and on 265 
additional meningiomas of diverse subtypes and grades 
(Supplementary Table 5), including 26 anaplastic grade III 
samples lacking any rhabdoid cells. BAP1 was expressed 
in all 265 non-rhabdoid meningiomas. However, among 
the 47 patients, we identified 5 with BAP1-negative rhab-
doid cells (Supplementary Figs. 4–6). Each of these five 
patients had tumors with distinctly well-developed rhab-
doid cytomorphology and all tumors had high-grade 
histology.
Across these 57 samples there was a correlation between 
loss of BAP1 and the extent of rhabdoid features (BAP1 
was lost in 3 of the 37 samples composed of ≤50% rhab-
doid cells; BAP1 was lost in 9 of 20 samples composed of 
>50% rhabdoid cells; chi-square statistic = 10.6; P = .0011), 
between loss of BAP1 and mitotic rate (BAP1 was not 
lost in any of the 40 samples with <5 mitoses per 10 high 
powered fields; BAP1 was lost in 12 of 17 samples with 
≥5 mitoses per 10 high powered fields; chi-square = 35.8; 
 
P < .0001) and between loss of BAP1 and WHO grade (chi-
square = 12.3; P < .0021).
Clinical follow-up was available for 4 of these 5 patients 
and showed that BAP1 loss correlated closely with poor 
outcomes. 
Two patients died of disease (RM-6, RM-31), one 
had 3 recurrences and remains alive with significant mor-
bidity (RM-23), and the other had 2 recurrences, including 
systemic metastases (RM-15). 
Thus, BAP1-deficient menin-
giomas were clinically aggressive and more likely to recur 
compared with BAP1-retained grades II and III meningi-
omas (hazard ratio [HR] = 12.9 in all grades; HR = 6.0 in 
grade II/III; Kaplan–Meier analysis log-rank test P < .001 for 
all grades, P = .002 for higher grades (Fig. 2; Supplementary 
Table 4). Whereas WHO grades II and III meningiomas as a 
group had a median time to progression of 72 months, the 
median time to progression for patients with BAP1 intact 
grades II and III meningiomas was 116 months but only 
26 months for patients with BAP1-deficient grades II and III 
meningiomas. 
The association of BAP1 and recurrence was 
independent of grade in a multivariate model (P = .015). 
Further multivariate model building was limited by small 
numbers.
To identify the genomic aberrations in BAP1 that underlie 
the BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas, we performed 
whole exome sequencing or focused sequencing of all 
exons from 300 cancer-associated genes from 12 avail-
able samples from these 5 patients. In all cases, we found 
mutations or deletions that inactivate BAP1 coupled with 
chromosome 3 LOH (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Table 6–8). 
One case (RM-6) had 2 samples with both copies of BAP1 
deleted—a single copy loss of part of chromosome 3p and 
an intrachromosomal fusion between the IQCF4 gene and 
the PBRM1 gene deleting ~700 kilobases encompassing 
BAP1 and the C-terminal 20 amino acids of polybromo-1 
(PBRM1), including the stop codon (Fig. 1b). This event 
is predicted to inactivate PBRM1. Interestingly, 2 of these 
BAP1-mutant cases (RM-6 and RM-23) showed significant 
papillary morphology in addition to widespread rhabdoid 
cytomorphology (Fig. 3a), indicating a genetic connection 
between 2 WHO grade III subtypes of meningioma that to 
date have been largely considered distinct entities.
Constitutional DNA was available for 3 of these 5 patients. 
In 2 cases (RM-6, RM-31), the BAP1 gene was wild-type in the 
constitutional DNA, whereas one case (RM-23) showed the 
same germline 
Y173X mutation that we had identified in the 
patient’s meningioma. Because our work is a retrospective 
analysis, our ability to access family history in RM-23 was 
limited, and a full pedigree analysis was not currently pos-
sible. Nonetheless, we found that that patient’s father and 2 
paternal uncles had mesotheliomas, tumors known to arise 
as part of the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome.32–34
We next used the whole exome sequencing data to 
assess heterogeneity and evolutionary relationships24 in 
tumor samples from 2 patients with multiple recurrences—
RM-23 with a germline Y173X BAP1 truncating mutation 
and RM-31 with a sporadic delGGKG (aa 578–581) BAP1 
frameshift event (c.1733_1742delGTGGGAAGGG). This 
analysis demonstrated the clonal relationships between 
the primary and recurrent tumors within each patient 
(Fig. 3 and 4, Supplementary Figs. 7–11).
As predicted, RM-23 (Fig. 3) had BAP1 protein loss in 
the primary tumor (RM-23-a; Fig. 3b). We found extensive

genomic heterogeneity with related but distinct subclones 
emerging in the last 2 recurrences (RM-23-c, RM-23-d; 
Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 7; Supplementary Table 7). 
In those latter recurrences, the tumor was nodular, form-
ing multiple spatially distinct masses, unlike the primary 
and first recurrence, which were distinct solitary masses 
(Fig. 3c). These anatomically distinct outgrowths may 
explain the extensive subclonal evolution we detected.
On the other hand, RM-31 (Fig. 4) had BAP1 protein 
intact in the primary tumor (RM-31-a; Fig 4a) and we found

a branched evolutionary relationship between the primary 
and the recurrent tumors (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 10, 
Supplementary Table 8). In the primary tumor (RM-31-a), 
one BAP1 allele was inactivated due to monosomy of 3p, 
but the second BAP1 allele was intact (Supplementary 
Fig. 11), consistent with the retained BAP1 expression. 
This 
primary tumor also harbored a frameshift mutation in NF2 
(W60fs; c.179delG). The clonally related recurrent tumor 
(RM-31-b) harbored this NF2 mutation but also was BAP1 
negative due to inactivation of the second BAP1 allele 
because of a delGGKG (aa 578–581) frameshift event (Figs. 
1b, 4a; Supplementary Fig. 10; Supplementary Table 8). 
Overt rhabdoid features were absent in the primary tumor 
(RM-31-a) but present in the recurrent tumors, following 
biallelic BAP1 inactivation. These findings suggest that 
meningiomas with monosomy 3p and intact BAP1 protein 
expression may recur as high-grade rhabdoid tumors if the 
second BAP1 allele is inactivated (Fig. 4b).

ples RM-23-c and RM-23-d comprised related but genetically distinct subclones. A list of mutation calls made for each of these 4 samples (RM-23-a to

Discussion
Our work has practical implications for the care of patients 
with meningiomas, which comprise one-third of pri-
mary brain tumors. First, by demonstrating that rhabdoid 
meningiomas often harbor BAP1 mutations, we further 
sharpen the emerging molecular-genetic taxonomy of 
meningiomas that was described in the introductory sec-
tion. Assessing the BAP1 expression status of suspected 
rhabdoid meningiomas—ones with either focal or wide-
spread rhabdoid cytomorphology—will help remedy the 
nosologic dilemma that has muddled the diagnosis and 
prognosis of rhabdoid meningiomas. Such an assessment

Shankar et al.: Germline and somatic BAP1 mutations in high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas

can be performed routinely using simple and inexpensive 
IHC testing for BAP1 protein expression, which has been 
validated in uveal melanoma to capture tumors with non-
synonymous mutations, in addition to those with epige-
netic mechanisms of gene silencing.35 Of note, a caveat of 
our current study is that the number of rhabdoid menin-
gioma cases we have analyzed is small, given the relative 
rarity of this meningioma subtype. Hence, the association 
of BAP1 mutations with rhabdoid meningiomas and fur-
ther assessment of the clinical implications of BAP1 inac-
tivation will require an even larger multi-institutional effort 
for future validation.
The straightforward IHC staining which we utilized will 
provide a molecular criterion that can now be assessed 
prospectively as a tool for risk-stratifying patients, iden-
tifying those requiring closer postoperative surveillance 
imaging or even adjuvant radiation therapy. Highlighting 
the need for an objective molecular marker that could 
potentially guide patient management, we found that 
13 of 40 patients who had BAP1-intact WHO grades I–III 
meningiomas with rhabdoid features had received radia-
tion therapy following the diagnosis. It is conceivable that 
a portion of these patients may have been overtreated. 
Additional multicenter prospective studies will be required 
to assess the value of BAP1 IHC in guiding adjuvant care. 
In our study, cases with inactivation of BAP1 had nega-
tive staining in essentially all tumor cells. In principle, IHC 
staining may help identify cases with loss of BAP1 in a 
subclonal population, and the clinical significance of such 
changes and the potential underlying genetic modifica-
tions resulting in focal BAP1 loss will need to be assessed.
Of additional clinical importance, our work links a distinct 
meningioma subtype with a tumor predisposition syn-
drome that principally gives rise to tumors that occur out-
side of the CNS, including uveal and cutaneous melanoma, 
mesothelioma, and renal cell carcinoma. Identification of 
BAP1-deficient meningiomas should elicit an evaluation 
for the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, although 
a subset of these BAP1-negative tumors clearly arise due 
to sporadic somatic BAP1 mutations. Moreover, our work 
suggests that patients with known germline BAP1 muta-
tions may warrant monitoring for the development of 
meningiomas.
Our work also suggests that meningiomas with one copy 
loss of chromosome 3p and retained BAP1 protein expres-
sion may have the propensity to evolve into BAP1-deficient 
high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas, as in the case of 
RM-31 (Fig. 4). In addition to characterizing traditional bio-
markers,36 assessing the genomic aberrations of meningi-
omas is becoming an increasingly integral part of patient 
management.14,37–42 This increase in molecular testing will 
allow the identification of patients with “monosomy 3p 
meningiomas.
” Additional multicenter studies with larger 
cohorts can now be used to assess whether such meningi-
omas indeed have a higher propensity to evolve into rhab-
doid meningiomas.
We found that BAP1-mutant rhabdoid meningiomas also 
harbor mutations in genes that are altered in other BAP1-
mutant tumors such as mesothelioma34 and clear cell renal 
cell carcinoma.43 For example, BAP1-mutant rhabdoid 
meningiomas also had genomic aberrations in the tumor 
suppressor genes NF2 (RM-15: p.A367fs, c.1100_1101CA>C 
and RM-31: p.W60fs, c.179delG) and FBXW7 (RM-6: 
p.N635fs, c.1905_1924CTTTGTAATTACCAGCTCAG>G and 
RM-15: p.G246X; c.736G>T), which have both been found 
to be altered in mesothelioma. In mesothelioma, altera-
tions in BAP1 and NF2 tend to occur together in sarcoma-
toid subtypes, ones that have more aggressive behavior. 
We also describe a BAP1-mutant rhabdoid meningioma 
that also harbors an inactivating event in PBRM1 (RM-6). 
BAP1 and PBRM1 occur together in a subset of renal cell 
carcinomas that also display rhabdoid features.43 Such 
rhabdoid renal cell carcinomas are associated with poor 
outcome. The finding that genes altered in BAP1-mutant 
rhabdoid meningiomas are also altered in other BAP1-
mutant tumors suggests that these tumors may share 
mechanisms of pathogenesis. Moreover, further studies 
will be able to assess whether patients with meningiomas 
that have BAP1 mutations co-occurring with NF2, FBXW7, 
or PBRM1 mutations have worse outcomes than those not 
harboring mutations in these additional genes.
Consistent with the poor prognosis seen in other BAP1-
mutant tumors, our work shows that BAP1-deficient men-
ingiomas appear to be highly aggressive and often lethal 
malignancies. All BAP1-deficient cases in our cohort had 
WHO grade II or III histology, and the ones with sufficient 
clinical follow-up demonstrated aggressive clinical behav-
ior. 
Thus, novel treatment approaches are urgently needed 
for this molecular genetic subtype of meningioma. Recent 
work has shown that BAP1-deficient tumor cells are highly 
sensitive to genotoxic stressors43 and to inhibitors of 
enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2),44 providing promis-
ing therapeutic avenues to explore in pre-clinical models 
and clinical trial testing.
