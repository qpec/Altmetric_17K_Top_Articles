Received 21 December 2015; revised 8 January 2016; accepted 11 January 2016
Background: Current cancer mortality statistics are important for public health decision-making and resource allocation.
Age-standardized rates and numbers of deaths are predicted for 2016 in the European Union (EU).
Patients and methods: Population and death certification data for stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast,
uterus, prostate, leukaemias and total cancers were obtained from the World Health Organization database and Eurostat.
Figures were derived for the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. Projected numbers of deaths by age
group were obtained for 2016 by linear regression on estimated numbers of deaths over the most recent time period iden-
tified by a joinpoint regression model.
Results: Projected total cancer mortality trends for 2016 in the EU are favourable in both sexes with rates of 133.5/
100 000 men and 85.2/100 000 women (8% and 3% falls since 2011) corresponding to 753 600 and 605 900 deaths in
men and women for a total number of 1 359 500 projected cancer deaths (+3% compared with 2011, due to population
ageing). In men, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer have fallen 11%, 5% and 8%, respectively, since 2011. Breast and
colorectal cancer trends in women are favourable (8% and 7% falls, respectively), but lung and pancreatic cancer rates
have risen 5% and 4% since 2011 reaching rates of 14.4 and 5.6/100 000 women. Leukaemias show favourable
projected mortality for both sexes and all age groups, with stronger falls in the younger age groups. All ages rates are
4.0/100 000 men and 2.5/100 000 women, with falls of 14% and 12% respectively.
Conclusion: The 2016 predictions for EU cancer mortality confirm the favourable trends in rates particularly for men.
Lung cancer is likely to be the leading site for female cancer rates. Continuing falls in mortality, larger in children and
young adults, are predicted in leukaemias, essentially due to advancements in management and therapy, and their sub-
sequent adoption across Europe.

introduction
We previously published short-term cancer mortality predic-
tions for the European Union (EU) as a whole, and for its six
more populous countries up to the year 2015 [1–5]. On the basis
of the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database
[6], here we provide the corresponding figures for the year 2016.
In the present paper, we also focus specifically on leukaemias,
giving predicted numbers of deaths and death rate estimates for
this important group of neoplasms in various age groups, and
discuss their declines across sexes, countries and age groups.
materials and methods
This work is an update to the previous articles on predicted European cancer
mortality; hence, similar methods are used [1, 5].
We obtained official death certification data from the WHO database
(WHOSIS) [6] for the stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus
(cervix and corpus), prostate, leukaemias and total cancer (malignant and
benign) mortality.
Figures were derived for the EU (28 countries as of July 2013) in the period
1970–2011 and up to the most recent available year for 6 major European
countries: France (2011), Germany (2013), Italy (2012), Poland (2013), Spain
(2013) and the UK (2013). Details on data sources and preparation are given
in a supplementary Appendix, available at Annals of Oncology online.
From the matrices of certified deaths and resident populations, we computed
age-specific number of deaths and rates for each 5-year age group (from 0–4 to
85+ years) and calendar year. Age-standardized rates (world standard popula-
tion) per 100 000 men and women, at all ages, were computed using the direct

 method, on the basis of the world standard population [7]. For leukaemias,
rates for the 0–14, 15–44 and 45–69 years age groups were also computed.
We fit a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint regression model to the
numbers of certified deaths for each 5-year age group to identify the most
recent trend segment (see supplementary Appendix, available at Annals of
Oncology online) [8].
We applied a linear regression to mortality data for each 5-year age group
over the most recent trend segment identified by the joinpoint model to com-
pute the predicted age-specific certified numbers of deaths and the corre-
sponding 95% prediction intervals (PIs) [9]. Predicted age-specific numbers
of deaths and the predicted population data from Eurostat were used to
compute the predicted age-standardized death rates with 95% PIs [10].
results
Table 1 shows the total numbers of predicted cancer deaths
(rounded to the nearest hundred) and the death rate predictions
with corresponding 95% PIs for selected neoplasms for 2016,
in the EU as a whole, as well as the 2011 recorded data. Overall,
1 359 500 EU citizen are projected to die of cancer in 2016
(753 600 men and 605 900 women), compared with the 1 314 787
cancer deaths recorded in 2011 (734 259 men and 580 528
women). These figures correspond to age-standardized rates of
133.5/100 000 men and 85.2/100 000 women predicted for 2016,
compared with 144.6 men and 88.1 women recorded in 2011.
Thus, a 7.7% fall in rates for men and a 3.3% one in women are
predicted between 2011 and 2016, despite an increase of ∼45 000
(+3.3%) in the absolute number of cancer deaths.
Figure 1A shows bar plots of death rates per 100 000 popula-
tion and numbers of deaths from all cancers for the year 2011
for EU men and women, and the predicted values for 2016 with
corresponding 95% PIs. Figure 1B shows bar plots of death rates
per 100 000 population for 2011 and the predicted rates for
2016 with 95% PIs for the eight neoplasm sites considered for
the EU (in men and women).
Lung cancer is responsible for nearly 274 000 predicted deaths
in both sexes combined in 2016, corresponding to over 20% of
total cancer deaths, and it has the highest predicted rates in both
sexes, in men 34.0/100 000, corresponding to 183 800 predicted
deaths (24.4% of total male cancer deaths), despite a 10.7% fall in
rates since 2011. In women, mortality from lung cancer is still
rising and it is likely to be the neoplasm with the highest mortal-
ity rate in the EU in women in 2016, with a predicted rate of 14.4/
100 000, corresponding to 89 700 predicted deaths (14.8% of total
female cancer deaths), and to a 5.4% rise in rates since 2011.
Breast cancer has the second highest projected rate (14.3/
100 000, with a 7.6% fall since 2011), but the total number of
deaths remains highest for this neoplasm (92 300). Between the
ages of 55 and 79 years, more deaths from female lung than
breast cancer were predicted whereas, in elderly women, an
excess in breast cancer deaths persisted.
The cancer with the second largest impact in men is that of
the colorectum, with a predicted rate of 16.2/100 000 corre-
sponding to a 4.6% fall, followed by prostate cancer, with a pre-
dicted rate of 10.6/100 000 men with a 7.8% fall since 2011. In
women, colorectal cancer shows the third highest predicted rate
(9.3/100 000, with a 7.0% fall since 2011); deaths from this
cancer represent 12.8% of total cancer deaths in the EU in 2016,
with 173 400 projected deaths.
Pancreatic cancer shows rising predicted death rates in
women (5.6/100 000, +3.9%), whereas the predicted rate of

 7.9/100 000 in men only shows a 0.5% fall compared with 2011.
The corresponding total deaths are 85 600, that is 6.3% of all
predicted cancer deaths. Cancer of the uterus, stomach and leu-
kaemias each represent <5% of total cancer deaths and show
persistent declines.
Figure 2 illustrates trends in all age-standardized cancer mor-
tality rates for men and women in quinquennia centered from
1972 to 2007, and the predicted rates for 2016 with PIs for all
cancers. Trends in total cancer mortality in the EU are favour-
able in both sexes; in men, rates have been falling since the late
1980s, whereas in women they have been favourable over the
entire period, though in recent years the falls in women were
less pronounced than in men.
Figure 3 gives corresponding trends for major cancer sites.
Stomach cancer mortality shows the greatest falls over the whole
period. In men, lung cancer also has shown appreciable falls in
mortalitysincethe late1980sasbreast cancerhasshowninwomen.
The only exceptions to these generally favourable trends in the
EU are pancreatic cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women:
pancreatic cancer mortality rates have been showing steady rises
in women, whereas in men it seems to have stabilized. Over the
last decades, female lung cancer has shown strong rises. See sup-
plementary Appendix, available at Annals of Oncology online, for
individual country data and analyses (supplementary Tables S1–
S9 and Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Table 2 gives age-standardized leukaemia mortality rates in
the 2000–2004 and 2005–2009 quinquennia, the predicted mor-
tality rate for 2016 and the percent difference between the 2016
prediction and 2007 (2005–2009 quinquennium), for all ages,
0–14, 15–44 and 45–69 years age groups, for male and female,
in the six studied countries and the EU as a whole. In 2000–
2004, leukaemia mortality rates for all ages in men were between
5 and 6/100 000, and showed favourable trends in all countries
and the EU as a whole, giving predicted rates for 2016 between 4
(Spain and the UK) and 5/100 000 (Poland and Italy). Similarly,
in women, in 2000–2004, leukaemia mortality rates for all ages
in women were around 3/100 000, and predicted rates for 2016
are between 2 and 3/100 000 (the UK and Italy). The overall
decline between 2007 and 2016 approached 16% in women and
19% in men. The falls, however, were greatest in children (38%
in males, 20% in females) and young adults (26% in males, 22%
in females). The predicted rates for 2016 in the EU are

 favourable compared with 2011, with values of 4 at all ages, 0.5
at 0–14 years, 1 at 15–44 years and 6.8/100 000 at 45–69 years in
men, and values of 2.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 4.2/100 000 in women, re-
spectively.
Figure 4 illustrates joinpoint analysis of EU leukaemia mortal-
ity rates for men and women in the four age groups considered,
with predictions for 2016 and relative PIs. In both sexes, rates
for all age groups display a similar pattern with important falls
over the whole studied period, except for men aged 45–69 and
all ages, where the favourable trends start in the late 70s.
discussion
The 2016 projections confirm the favourable outlook for total
cancer mortality previously reported [3–5]. Total cancer mortal-
ity rates in the EU are projected to decrease in both sexes, in
spite of the slight rise in number of deaths due to the ageing of
the European population [11]. In fact, the median age of the
total EU population was 41 in 2011 and rose to 42 in 2016, cor-
responding median ages for men were 39 in 2011 and 41 in
2016, and in women 42 in 2011 and 44 in 2016. The greater falls
seen, over the studied period, in men (over 10%) when com-
pared with women (∼3%), are mainly driven by the different
trends in cancer related to tobacco smoking between the sexes
[12]. The fall in tobacco-related cancer mortality is the main
driver for the fall in overall cancer mortality in men, whereas in
women the fall is mainly due to cancers amenable to treatment
and subject to early diagnosis, i.e. cancers of the breast and
uterus (as well as stomach and colorectum), whereas lung
cancer trends remain upwards [4, 5].
Lung cancer mortality reflects the differences between smoking
prevalence trends between the sexes and European countries [12].
The 2016 projection confirms the steady declines of lung cancer
mortality in men and the increases in women, with lung cancer
rates much higher than breast cancer rates in young and middle
age women, indicating that the excess lung cancer mortality is
likely to be greater in the near future. In the UK, where female pro-
jections for this cancer have been unstable, updated data to 2013
brought about a downward projected trend; this would be in line
with lung cancer age-period-cohort analyses for this country [13].
Improved therapeutic procedures and advancements in diag-
nosis and screening have determined favourable trends in
several cancer sites and are among the main drivers of the
decline in cancer mortality in women, including breast and cer-
vical cancer. However, a slowdown in the falls in uterine cancer
mortality is apparent for several countries. The exception to
these descending rates is the UK, particularly in elderly women
and hence likely due to endometrial cancer linked to overweight
and diabetes [14]. National mortality data do not allow separate
analysis of cervix and corpus uteri cancers.
Prostate cancer trends are also descending, albeit with vari-
able degrees across countries. The role of screening practices is
still debated, but it may have had a role in the measured and
projected falls in mortality [15, 16]. Effective modern therapies,
including radiotherapy and anti-androgens, and management
protocols are, however, the major determinants of the favour-
able trends, not only in the middle aged but also in the elderly
[15]. The excess in mortality for elderly Polish men is likely due
to delayed adoption of these therapies.
EU colorectal cancer mortality reductions are brought mainly
by northern and western European countries thanks to better
awareness of the disease, screening, early diagnosis and patient
management protocols and treatments [17, 18]. However, pro-
jected rises in Spain and particularly in Poland (which has the
highest rates in Europe) emphasize the need to rationalize these
strategies in southern and eastern Europe.
The favourable trends in mortality from stomach cancer are
projected to continue into 2016. Thus, gastric cancer remains
one of the main drivers of the total favourable trends in both
sexes; the most probable determinants of these trends are a
more affluent and varied diet, better food conservation and the
fall in Helicobacter pylori infection across generations [19, 20].
However, falls seem to be slowing down, particularly in women
and in countries where rates are already low [20, 21]. This sug-
gests that mortality levels of this tumour are reaching an asymp-
tote. National mortality data do not allow to discriminate
cardias versus corpus and pyloric cancer. It is therefore possible
that such a levelling in rates is due to lack of declines in cardias
and cardio-oesophageal-junction cancer mortality.
Pancreatic cancer is the tumour with the least favourable out-
look in both sexes. However, in men, projections for the EU
give a stable mortality rate rather than a rising one, while in
women the unfavourable trend is confirmed [3–5]. Aetiology for
this cancer is still largely uncertain, but smoking plays a relevant

 role accounting for 20%–30% of cases in various populations
[22–24]. Consequently, the observed differences in trends
between sexes may well be explained by the different smoking
trends. The other relevant recognized risk factors are obesity
and diabetes, whose prevalence has increased over recent years
in most populations [25].

 Inferences on leukaemia mortality are complicated by the
nature of this heterogeneous group of diseases; national mortal-
ity data do not allow for their individual separation and analysis.
Projections for these cancers in 2016 are favourable in both
sexes for most age groups and countries, but the falls are appre-
ciably larger at younger ages. Therapeutic advancements are the
main drivers of these trends; these include better diagnosis, mul-
tidrug chemotherapy and immunotherapy protocols assisted by
toxicity limiting therapies and improved radiotherapy [26, 27].
The distribution of leukaemias by type varies by age. Children
are generally affected by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that
is also frequent in adolescents and young adults. In contrast,
chronic leukaemia, in particular chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
(CLL), is common in the elderly. ALL is mostly curable and 5-year
survival in children has reached over 90% in optimum conditions
[28]. Improvements have also been observed in adolescents and
adults; these are attained through improved disease management
and, in recent years, relapse control using allogenic haematopoietic
stem-cell transplants and immunotherapy, as well as using paedi-
atric inspired regimens in young adults [29–33]. Stem-cell trans-
plants and new chemotherapy regimens have also brought
improvements in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) that is
relatively common in adult and elderly patients [34, 35]. Chronic
leukaemia is hardly curable, but long-term survival has been
achieved in chronic myeloid leukaemia, since the introduction of
tyrosine kinase inhibitors [36–39]. Some improvement in survival
in Europe, though not as strong as in the United States [40], has
also been observed in CLL even though it is mainly in patients
under 75 years of age. These improvements are due to better diag-
nosis, management and therapy including anti-CD20 antibodies
like obinutuzumab combined with chlorambucil [41, 42].
Given large size of the underlying population, EU cancer
mortality predictions should not be affected by random oscilla-
tions or major unexpected factors. However, if some factors
were to determine changes within the last few years, the model
would not be able to account for them. Also the linear models
used tend to underestimate future rates, particularly under
certain conditions (e.g. asymptotic behaviours after strong des-
cending trends); hence, in some scenarios, predictions may be
overly optimistic within a global picture of declining trends [43].
Updated data from the WHO made it possible to compute
EU age-standardized mortality rates for 2011, and compare
these data with our predictions [1]. All estimates, with the
exceptions, in women, for stomach and uterine cancers and leu-
kaemias, are within a 5% difference. Stomach and uterine cancer
trends fall within the model’s predictive limits, while for leukae-
mia, discrepancy between predicted and observed rates affects
the younger age groups that are weighted heavily in the world
standard population.
In conclusion, EU cancer mortality predictions for 2016
confirm the favourable trends in rates (although in the absence
of a decline in the absolute number of deaths) particularly for
men. This is essentially due to larger declines in tobacco
smoking in men than in women in recent decades. Despite the

 steady favourable trends in breast and uterine (mainly cervix)
cancer mortality, they also confirm that lung cancer is likely to
be the leading site for cancer rates in EU women. With specific
reference to leukaemias, they confirm the favourable trends in
mortality due to the advancement in therapy, particularly for
acute leukaemia in children and young adults.
