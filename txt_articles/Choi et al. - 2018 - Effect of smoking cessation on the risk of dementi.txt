Abstract
Objective: To determine the risk of developing dementia in relation to dura-
tion of smoking cessation by using a nationwide health claims database.
Methods: This cohort study included 46,140 men aged 60 years or older from
Korean National Health Insurance System – National Health Screening Cohort,
a population-based national health screening program from 2002 to 2013. The
changes in smoking habit from a questionnaire during the first (2002 and
2003) and second (2004 and 2005) health examination periods, participants
were divided into continual smokers, short-term (less than 4 years) quitters,
long-term (4 years or more) quitters, and never smokers. Participants were fol-
lowed-up for 8 years from January 1, 2006 for the development of overall
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia. Results: Compared to
continual smokers, long-term quitters and never smokers had decreased risk of
overall dementia (hazard ratio, HR 0.86 95% CI, confidence interval 0.75–0.99
and HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71–0.91, respectively). Never smokers had decreased
risk of Alzheimer’s disease (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70–0.96) compared to contin-
ual smokers. Finally, both long-term quitters (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48–0.96)
and never smokers (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54–0.95) had decreased risk of vascu-
lar dementia compared to continual smokers. Interpretation: Smoking was
associated with increased risk of dementia. Smokers who quit for a prolonged
period of time may benefit from reduced risk of dementia. Therefore, smokers
should be encouraged to quit in order to reduce the risk of developing demen-
tia, especially in the elderly population who are already at risk.
Introduction
Cigarette smoking is one of the most important causes of
preventable death in the world.1 At least 14 million cases
of serious morbidities are known to attributed by the
smoking in the United States,2 including chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease,3 stroke,4
and cancer.5 It is also known that 480,000 deaths are
attributable to smoking in the United States alone.6 How-
ever, relatively less is known on the risk of smoking on
neurodegenerative
disease.
Interestingly,
early
studies
funded by the tobacco company have suggested a possible
beneficial role of smoking in cognitive function due to
the effects of nicotine.7 Furthermore, several early case–
control studies funded by the tobacco industry have
reported a preventive effect of smoking on Alzheimer’s
disease.8–10 However, since then, a number of cohort
studies have shown that smoking was associated with
increased risk of dementia.11 The most recent longitudinal
study with a long-term follow-up duration12 and meta-
analysis13 have also reported smoking as a risk factor for
dementia.
As there appears to be a consensus on the risk increas-
ing effect of smoking on dementia,14,15 it is important to
address whether or not smoking habit change, namely
smoking cessation, alters the risk of developing dementia
next. However, only a few previous studies investigating
the association of smoking on dementia evaluated the
effect of smoking cessation.12,13,16 Numerous studies have
compared current, former and never smokers, but few if

 any studies have examined duration of smoking cessation.
Finally, most studies investigating the effect of smoking
on dementia
were conducted
with Western popula-
tions,13,17 with relatively few studies conducted in Asia.
As there are differences in prevalence18 and type distribu-
tion19 of dementia among Western and Asian popula-
tions, the effect of smoking on the risk of dementia might
also differ between ethnic groups. Therefore, we aimed to
investigate the effect of smoking habit change on the risk
of developing dementia in this population-based study
using the Korean National Health Insurance System –
National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HealS).
Methods
Study population
The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea
provides mandatory health insurance for Korean citizens
since the National Health Insurance Act in 1989.20,21
With an enrollment rate of 97%, the NHIS provides bian-
nual health examinations for all enrollees who turn
40 years old. Using data from the health examinations,
the NHIS constructs and provides datasets by a simple
random
sampling
method.
The
constructed
cohort,
NHIS-HealS, provides information on sociodemographics,
hospital use, examinations, pharmacy visits and other
data, which can be used for research purposes. The data
used in this study is directly available via the NHIS data-
base registration system. A number of previous studies
have used this NHIS database for epidemiological studies,
and its validity has been described in detail elsewhere.22,23
A total of 51,849 men aged 60 years or older who partici-
pated in health examinations between the first (2002 to
2003) and second (2004 to 2005) periods were recruited.
Among them, those without information on smoking habit
(4744 participants) were excluded. Furthermore, 362 par-
ticipants who died and 603 participants who were diag-
nosed with dementia before the index date of January 1,
2006 were excluded. Women were excluded due to extre-
mely low smoking rates in Korea. Ultimately, the final
study population consisted of 46,140 participants.
Smoking habit change
The smoking status of the study participants were assessed
by a questionnaire during the health examination. Based on
the answers to the questionnaire from both the first and
second health examinations, the participants were divided
into continual smokers, short-term quitters (quitting dura-
tion of less than 4 years), long-term quitters (quitting
duration of 4 years or longer), and never smokers.24 Con-
tinual smokers were participants who were current smokers
during the first and second health examinations. Short-
term quitters were defined was those who were current
smokers during the first health examination but quitters
during the second health examination. Long-term quitters
were those who were quitters for both the first and second
health examinations. Finally, never smokers were defined as
those who were never smokers for both the first and second
health examinations.
Assessment of dementia
Hospital use records, including hospitalizations and out-
patient visits were used to identify new cases of dementia.
Dementia was defined using the codes from the Tenth
Revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-
10) from the World Health Organization. Participants
who were hospitalized at least once or visited the outpa-
tient department at least three times with an ICD-10 code
pertaining to dementia (F00, F01, F02, F03, G30, G31,
and G32) were considered to have developed dementia.25
Since it is required to fulfill Korean National Health
Insurance reimbursement criteria to receive payment in
Korea, physicians need to document the evidence for cog-
nitive dysfunction according to strict criteria to submit a
valid claim for: (1) Minimal Mental State Examination
score ≤ 26 and (2) either a Clinical Dementia Rating ≥ 1
or a Global Deterioration Scale score ≥ 3.26,27 Among
dementia patients, we further categorized patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (F00 or G30) and vascular dementia
(F01). The earliest date of hospital use with an ICD-10
code pertaining to dementia was considered the date of
diagnosis for dementia patients.
Covariates
Information on potential confounding covariates was
extracted from 2005 and missing values were categorized
into a separate group for each covariates. The covariates
considered were age, body mass index (<18.5, 18.5–22.9,
23.0–24.9, and ≥25.0 kg/m2), blood pressure (<120/80,
120/80-139/89, and ≥140/90 mmHg), fasting serum glu-
cose (<100.0, 100.0–125.9, ≥126.0 mg/dL, and missing),
total cholesterol (<200.0, 200.0–239.9, ≥240.0 mg/dL, and
missing), physical activity (none, 1–2, 3–4, 5–7 times per
week, and missing), drinking habit (none, 1–2, ≥3 drinks
per week, and missing), and household income (lower
half and upper half). Household income was categorized
according to each patient’s insurance premium status.
Finally, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI, 0, 1–2, and
≥3),
another
potential
confounding
covariate,
was
extracted from 2002 to 2005. The algorithm for CCI cal-
culation by ICD-10 codes was adapted from a previous
study.28

Smoking Cessation and Dementia
 Statistical analysis
All participants were followed-up starting January 1, 2006
and ended at the date of dementia diagnosis, date of
death, or December 31, 2013, whichever came first. Tak-
ing into account the fact that dementia is a chronic,
slowly developing disorder while also trying to minimize
the possibility of reverse-causality, we applied a washout-
period of 5 years, in which we did not consider new cases
of dementia for those diagnosed from January 1, 2006 to
December 31, 2010. The risk of developing dementia due
to smoking habit change was assessed by calculating the
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.
In all analyses, the continual smoker group was used as
the reference group, in which the HR and 95% CI was
calculated for the short-term quitter, long-term quitter,
and never smoker groups.
Multivariable-adjusted (adjusted for age, household
income, physical activity, drinking habit, body mass
index, change in body mass index, blood pressure, fasting
serum glucose, total cholesterol, and Charlson Comorbid-
ity Index) analyses were conducted for the risk of overall
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and vascular dementia.
Furthermore, P for trend values were calculated in the
order of continual smoker, short-term quitter, long-term
quitter, and never smoker, which pertains to decreasing
amounts of total tobacco exposure. Stratified, multivari-
ate-adjusted analyses according to subgroups divided by
covariates were conducted. Sensitivity analysis was con-
ducted by changing the washout period of dementia cases
by 6 years and 7 years. Finally, the association between
smoking habit change and dementia among women was
determined.
Statistical significance was defined as a p value of less
than 0.05 in a two-sided manner. Statistical software SAS
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and STATA 13.0 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX) were used for data collection
and statistical analyses, respectively.
IRB approval
This study was approved by the Seoul National University
Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB number: X-
1701/378-902). The IRB waived the requirement for
informed consent from the study participants as the
NHIS-HealS database is anonymized according to strict
confidentiality guidelines.
Results
A total of 46,140 participants were followed up for a
mean of 7.11 years, with 328,274 person-years. Table 1
depicts the descriptive characteristics of the study popula-
tion. The number continual smokers, short-term quitters,
long-term quitters, and never smokers were 12,672, 4,175,
9,268, and 20,025 men, respectively. The majority of par-
ticipants were aged between 60 and 69 years, with the
group containing the highest proportion of men aged
between 60 and 69 years being continual smokers. Fur-
thermore, compared to other groups, continual smokers
tended to have lower body mass index, lower blood pres-
sure, exercise less, drink alcohol more, and have lower
household income.
Table 2 shows the effect of smoking habit change on
the risk of dementia. A total of 1644 participants were
diagnosed with dementia during the follow-up duration.
Compared to continual smokers, long-term quitters and
never smokers had decreased risk of overall dementia
(HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75–0.99 and HR: 0.81; 95% CI:
0.71–0.91, respectively). Furthermore, as the total amount
of tobacco exposed decreased in order of continual smok-
ers, short-term quitters, long-term quitters, and never
smokers, the risk of developing overall dementia signifi-
cantly decreased (P for trend 0.001). Similarly, never
smokers had decreased risk of developing Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (HR 0.82 95% CI 0.70–0.96) compared to continual
smokers. Finally, long-term quitters and never smokers
also had decreased risk of vascular dementia (HR: 0.68;
95% CI: 0.48–0.96, HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54–0.95, respec-
tively) compared to continual smokers.
Table 3 shows stratified, multivariate-adjusted analyses
according to subgroups divided by covariates for the risk
of overall dementia. Never smokers tended to have
decreased risk of overall dementia compared to continual
smokers, albeit with attenuated results, most likely due to
the decreased number of cases upon dividing the study
population by subgroups. Similarly, compared to contin-
ual smokers, long-term quitters tended to have decreased
risk of overall dementia, although most values were not
statistically significant.
The results of the sensitivity analyses by changing the
duration of washout period to 6 years and 7 years are
shown
in
Table
S1.
There
was
a
tendency
toward
decreased risk of overall dementia, Alzheimer’s disease,
and vascular dementia for long-term quitters and never
smokers, albeit with statistical attenuation due to the
decreased number of events. Similarly, there was a ten-
dency toward reduced risk of dementia according to
decreasing amounts of tobacco exposed after washout
periods of 6 and 7 years. In addition, the effect of smok-
ing habit change on the risk of dementia with never smo-
ker being the reference group is shown in Table S2.
Compared to never smokers, long-term quitters and
short-term quitters was not associated with increased risk
of dementia (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.94–1.22, HR: 1.08; 95%

increased risk of dementia (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.10–1.40).
Finally, the association between smoking habit change
and dementia among women is shown in Table S3. There
was a tendency toward a reduced risk of dementia
according to a decreasing amount of tobacco exposure
without significant result.
Discussion
In this large-scale longitudinal study, we have shown that
prolonged
smoking
cessation
was
associated
with
decreased risk of overall dementia among Korean men.
While numerous previous studies12,13,16 have shown that
smoking increases the risk of dementia in Western popu-
lations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to evaluate the effects of smoking cessation on the
risk of developing dementia in a large Asian population.
Results from most previous studies investigating the
association between smoking and dementia are consistent
with the findings in this study.10,12,13,29 A recent meta-
analysis of 19 prospective studies and 26,374 participants
revealed that current smokers had increased risk of Alz-
heimer’s disease (relative risk, RR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.43–
2.23), vascular dementia (RR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28–2.47),
and overall dementia (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.02–1.60) com-
pared with never smokers.13 Furthermore, another previ-
ous study studying the effects of smoking on dementia in
the Western population revealed that former smokers had
decreased risk of dementia compared to current smokers
(RR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.25–2.31).13 The results from this
study support previous studies by showing never smokers
had decreased risk of dementia compared to continual
smokers.
Furthermore,
this
study
demonstrates
that
smokers who quit for a prolonged period benefit from
decreased risk of overall dementia among Korean men.
Previous studies investigating the association between
smoking and Alzheimer’s disease have been controversial.
Few studies have shown that nicotine may actually
improve short-term cognitive performance7,30 and inhibit
amyloid formation.31,32 On the other hand, various other
studies have shown that smoking is a risk factor for Alz-
heimer’s disease, namely due to reactive oxygen species
produced by smoking.33–37 Smoking directly delivers reac-
tive oxidant species from the cigarette into the blood-
stream, promotes the generation of endogenous reactive
oxidant species and causes weakening of antioxidant
defense systems.38,39 Reactive oxygen species caused by
smoking can then contribute to cellular damage by oxi-
dizing lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.38 Specifically,
the brain is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due
to the high proportion of oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty
acids in membranes and the high metabolic requirement
of oxygen.40
In our study, there was a tendency toward decreased
risk of Alzheimer’s disease upon decreasing amounts of
tobacco consumed. The trend toward risk reduction upon
decreasing amounts of tobacco implies that the detrimen-
tal effects of tobacco on the development of dementia.
Therefore, smoking should be considered a risk factor for
Alzheimer’s disease and smoking cessation should be

Smoking Cessation and Dementia
 encouraged in order to reduce the risk of developing Alz-
heimer’s disease.
Smoking is also known to increase the risk of cardio-
vascular diseases through oxidative damage,3,39 increased
fibrinogen levels3,41 and induction of a hypercoagulable
state.42 Since cerebrovascular infarction is the key patho-
physiological mechanism for vascular dementia, the risk
factors of cerebrovascular diseases, which include smok-
ing,43,44 are also considered to be risk factors of vascular
dementia. As smoking cessation reduces the risk of car-
diovascular disease due to decreased inflammatory mark-
ers and oxidative stress45–47 upon smoking cessation,
similar mechanisms may contribute to the decreased risk
of vascular dementia.
There are several limitations to consider upon inter-
preting the results of our study. First, as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease is defined as a chronic neurodegenerative disease
that usually starts slowly and worsens over time,48 there-
fore the follow-up duration of 8 years may not have been
enough to fully determine the effects of smoking cessa-
tion on Alzheimer’s disease. We also did not take into
account other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkin-
son’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which
might also be related to smoking. Future studies with a
longer
follow-up
duration,
including
other
possible
related neurologic disorders are needed to validate the
findings of our results. Second, as the change in smoking
habit was not monitored after the second health exami-
nation, possible changes in smoking habit were not
accounted for. Third, as the smoking status was deter-
mined by a questionnaire, it may not reflect the exact
smoking status of each participant. Thus, future studies
that use biomarkers as a way of determining smoking sta-
tus are needed to validate our findings. Also, we could
not determine smoking duration among smokers, a factor
which may alter the effect of smoking on the risk of
dementia. Fourth, we were not able to obtain and adjust
for the participant’s level of education, an important fac-
tor upon assessing cognitive function. However, we have
adjusted for and conducted subgroup analyses for house-
hold income, which could serve as a surrogate marker for
education level. Finally, we did not include women in the
main analysis, which limits the generalizability of our
findings. Therefore, we conducted a separate analysis
determining
the
association
between
smoking
habit
change
and
dementia
among
women
(Table
S3).
Although there was a tendency toward a decreased risk of
dementia according to smoking cessation, we could not
obtain significant results since the majority of women
were never smokers. Future studies with a large popula-
tion of women and longer follow-up duration are needed
to
elucidate
the
association
between
smoking
habit
change and dementia among women.
Despite these limitations, to the best of knowledge,
this
is
the
first
study
to
examine
the
association
between
smoking
cessation
and
dementia,
using
an
Asian population. We have also shown that smokers
who quit for a prolonged period may benefit from
decreased risk of dementia. Furthermore, the relatively
large study population and wide range of potential con-
founding covariates also add to the strengths of this
study. Finally, the results were consistent across exten-
sive sensitivity and stratified analyses, reinforcing the
reliability of our findings.

Smoking Cessation and Dementia
D. Choi et al.
 In conclusion, smokers should be encouraged to quit
in order to reduce the risk of developing dementia.
Smoking should be understood as a risk factor for
dementia, especially in the elderly population as our study
showed, and proper education regarding the benefit of
smoking cessation should be done. Future studies with a
longer follow-up duration investigating the effect of
smoking cessation on Alzheimer’s disease are needed.
