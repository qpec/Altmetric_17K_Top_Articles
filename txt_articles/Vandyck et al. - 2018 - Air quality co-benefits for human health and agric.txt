Local air quality co-benefits can provide complementary support for ambitious climate action
and can enable progress on related Sustainable Development Goals. Here we show that the
transformation of the energy system implied by the emission reduction pledges brought
forward in the context of the Paris Agreement on climate change (Nationally Determined
Contributions or NDCs) substantially reduces local air pollution across the globe. The NDCs
could avoid between 71 and 99 thousand premature deaths annually in 2030 compared to a
reference case, depending on the stringency of direct air pollution controls. A more ambitious
2 °C-compatible pathway raises the number of avoided premature deaths from air pollution
to 178–346 thousand annually in 2030, and up to 0.7–1.5 million in the year 2050. Air quality
co-benefits on morbidity, mortality, and agriculture could globally offset the costs of climate
policy. An integrated policy perspective is needed to maximise benefits for climate and
health.

ausing 5.6–6.6 million premature deaths in 20161, air
pollution is an important externality that interacts with
climate change. Researchers2–5 have called for a coordi-
nated effort to combat climate change and to improve air quality,
but little work has been done to analyse the global synergies
between the Paris Agreement on climate change6 and air pollu-
tion. This paper combines extensive data sets and models on
emissions, climate, the energy system, the dispersion and impacts
of ambient air pollutants, and the economy to quantify the impact
of actual climate change mitigation policies proposed in the run-
up to the 21st Conference Of the Parties in Paris on three inter-
related Sustainable Development Goals7: Good health (SDG3),
Clean energy (SDG7), and Climate action (SDG13). As empha-
sised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC)8, a comprehensive analysis of co-benefits and adverse side
effects is essential to estimate the actual costs of mitigation
policies. In a political context, the co-benefits on air pollution are
particularly relevant because they are mainly local and short term,
while the averted climate change impacts occur globally over a
decadal temporal scale.
While earlier regional estimates present a broad range of values
for the co-benefits of climate policy on air quality (between 2 and
196$ per tonne of carbon dioxide, with mean value of 49$/tCO2)9,
recent work10–12 highlights that the improved human health
outcomes due to cleaner air can largely offset the costs to reduce
greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly in heavily polluted
regions. Here we assess the global and regional mortality, mor-
bidity, and agricultural air quality co-benefits in the context of the
Paris Agreement while accounting for future uncertainty in air
pollution control measures. The main contribution lies in the
quantification of ancillary benefits of actual (pledged) climate and
energy policy elements in the Nationally Determined Contribu-
tions (NDCs), thereby capturing the heterogeneity in country-
specific ambition levels and in sector coverage, in contrast with
scenarios studying global and economy-wide carbon pricing, and
complementing recent studies for the US13–15 and China16–19.
Considering the regional differentiation in pledges is crucial
because the transboundary effects of air pollution can be
substantial20. The results show that the NDCs as pledged in the
run-up to the Paris Agreement could improve health outcomes
substantially, avoiding 71–99 thousand premature deaths in the
year 2030. Present study furthermore compares the value of the
air quality co-benefits with the macroeconomic cost of climate
change mitigation policies, the latter also depending on the
relative ambition levels across countries through industry com-
petitiveness and international trade. We find that the value of co-
benefits differs widely across regions and outweighs the costs of
reducing GHGs on a global level in the majority of scenarios.
Results
Climate change mitigation pathways and the energy system.
The climate scenarios encompass three trajectories of GHG
emissions (global aggregate shown in Fig. 1; details by region in
Supplementary Table 1). The Reference (REF) assumes no climate
change mitigation policies beyond those already in place and
compares best to Current policy scenarios in the literature21. The
NDC scenario implements the GHG emission reductions and
related policies in the Paris pledges, including the emission
reductions that are conditional on other aspects of the Paris
Agreement such as financing. Jointly, the current pledges repre-
sented by this scenario imply a likely increase in global average
temperature of 2.5–3.2 °C, in line with the range provided by
other studies21. The 2 °C scenario considers policies that result in
a trajectory of GHG emissions that is consistent with at least 75%
probability of limiting the average rise of global temperature to 2 °
C by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels.
Air quality policies are likely to develop in parallel of climate
policies and may affect the potential scope of co-benefits of
climate policy22. We address the implications of air pollution
policy uncertainty for the co-benefits by exploring three story-
lines.

 pollutants, with the exception of carbon monoxide (CO), for
which a rising trend is offset by ongoing progress in energy
technology and corresponding efficiency improvements. Because
high levels of air pollution provide a broad base for reductions,
the estimates of the co-benefits of climate policy derived under
the assumption of Fixed air quality Legislation will be considered
here as an upper bound. A gradual adoption and diffusion of air
pollution control measures is included in the Stringent Legislation
(SLE) scenario, which better reflects ambitious recent policy
objectives in fast-growing countries, such as China. In the Best
Available Technologies (BAT) scenario, countries fully adopt the
maximum technically feasible air pollutant emission reduction
technologies by 2030. This hypothetical benchmark identifies how
structural changes induced by climate policy can improve air
quality beyond what can be expected by end-of-pipe air pollution
abatement technologies alone. By implementing stringent air
pollution abatement, the BAT scenario leaves less room for co-
benefits of climate action and will be used here to quantify a lower
bound for the co-benefits.
Air pollutants affect global and local temperature changes and
regional precipitation patterns23,24. The effect of air pollution
control on climate change is a priori unclear, because the
radiative forcing of some pollutants, such as black carbon (BC), is
positive, while other pollutants (NOx, SO2) have a cooling effect
on the climate. In addition to the median estimate of global
average temperature change and the 50% probability bounds for
the SLE scenario, Fig. 1 (dotted lines) includes the median
estimate in case of less (FLE) and more (BAT) stringent air
pollution control measures. The figure shows that the tempera-
ture change relative to pre-industrial levels in the REF climate
policy under more ambitious air pollution controls (BAT)
exceeds the central case estimate (SLE) by 0.08 °C in 2100, while
the higher end of the air pollution projection (FLE) implies
temperature changes that are 0.32 °C below the SLE case in 2100.
Hence, the end-of-pipe reduction of air pollutants with a cooling
effect outweighs the decrease in air pollutants that contribute to
global warming in our scenarios, leading to a net upward effect on
global mean temperatures, in line with other work25,26. This
result does not consider the effect of air pollution controls on
GHG emissions and is less pronounced in more ambitious
climate mitigation scenarios. Compared to the REF, the decrease
in GHG emissions in the 2 °C scenario implies larger reductions
in global mean temperature in the case of cleaner air (1.84 °C
under BAT vs. 1.62 °C under FLE, REF—2 °C in 2100), since co-
reduction of cooling aerosols plays a smaller role when stringent
air pollution controls (BAT) are in place.
Ambitious climate policies are to reshape the energy landscape
in the coming decades27–29. The decarbonisation of the energy
supply mix combined with reduced energy consumption through
efficiency gains will be key factors in the transformation of energy
systems (Fig. 1; regional numbers are given in Supplementary
Tables
2–5).

consumption down by approximately 10% in the NDC scenario
and by more than a quarter (27%) in the 2 °C scenario in the year

renewables represents a structural change in the energy sector,
especially in electricity generation.
The impact of climate policy measures on air quality. Policies
that aim to mitigate climate change tend to reduce emissions of
GHGs and local air pollutants22,30, particularly when both share
the same underlying drivers. The extent to which CO2 reductions
are correlated with changes in air pollutants differs by region and
type of air pollutant (Fig. 2). For pollutants that mainly result

 from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as SO2 and NOx,
emission reductions tend to be strongly correlated with decreas-
ing emissions of CO2. This co-movement is less obvious for
regions with large GHG abatement potential from options other
than the burning of fossil fuels, such as land use in Brazil (see
Supplementary Table 6), and for regions with important indus-
trial sources of pollutants, such as SO2 from production of metals
in Russia. Figure 2 shows that air quality co-benefits generally
outweigh adverse side effects on the aggregate level for most
pollutants and regions, although there are some trade-offs
embedded in technological choices such as carbon capture and
storage31,32, biomass energy33, and biofuels34. For organic carbon
and CO in particular, Fig. 2 shows that not all models in the
IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report35 agree on the sign of the change
in emissions on the global level, indicating uncertainty in the
estimates. Figure 2 furthermore indicates the sensitivity of co-
reductions with respect to the implemented air pollution control
technologies (Supplementary Tables 7–28 provide numbers by
region and scenario). Low air pollutant emission intensities
(BAT) in the benchmark in key climate change mitigation sectors
reduce the scope for co-benefits, as can be seen from the sulphur
dioxide emission reductions in India, for instance, where the
implementation of BAT implies less polluting coal-fired elec-
tricity generation facilities.
The impacts of air pollution are not confined to national
borders as air pollutants are dispersed geographically20,36. The
changes in the concentration of particulate matter with diameter
smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone mixing ratio
mapped in Fig. 3 are the results of emissions, transportation, and
atmospheric chemistry reactions of pollutants (see detailed
numbers in Supplementary Tables 29–34). Hence, results for PM
include both direct emissions from primary sources, such as BC
and organic matter, and secondary PM that derives from
emissions of NH3, NOx, SO2, and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs). Ozone is formed by the reaction of precursor gases NOx,
VOCs, and CO in the presence of sunlight. By 2030, the time
horizon of most NDCs, the Paris pledges lead to globally
relatively small but locally significant reductions in the concen-
tration of PM2.5, while a decrease in ozone mixing ratio spreads
more widely across the globe. Over the long run (2050), the
impact of a more ambitious climate policy setting (2 °C) reveals
that the potential contribution of GHG abatement policies to
improved air quality is substantial, particularly in China, India,
and the Middle East, where benchmark concentrations are
comparably high.
Air quality co-benefits for human health and agriculture. The
benefits of improved air quality include avoided premature mor-
tality due to related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and
lung cancer37. Consistent with other research38, outdoor air
pollution-related premature mortality is projected to roughly
double by 2050 compared to 2010 when considering the current
climate (REF) and air pollution (FLE) policies combined with
population and economic growth, whereas ambitious policies
(2 °C—BAT) bring the number of premature deaths below the
level of 2010 despite population growth by 2050 (premature
mortality per scenario, region, and pollutant are detailed in Sup-
plementary Tables 35–40). Climate policies as currently pledged
under the NDCs lead to between 71 and 99 thousand avoided
premature deaths globally in the year 2030 compared to current
climate policies (REF), while bringing greenhouse emissions in
line with a 2 °C temperature goal prevents between 178 and 346
thousand premature deaths globally in the year 2030. In the year
2050, 2 °C-compatible climate action reduces the premature
deaths from air pollution by 0.7–1.5 million compared to the REF,
of which more than two thirds are prevented in India and China
(Fig. 4). The gap between the NDC and 2 °C scenarios is explained
by countries like India, for which the current NDC up to 2030 fails
to capture the potential air quality co-benefits of climate action. In
addition to avoided premature mortality, reductions in air pollu-
tion bring benefits in terms of reduced sickness days, thereby
boosting labour markets (see Supplementary Table 41).

 reducing ozone precursor emissions, global climate policy can
improve crop yields. Using exposure–response functions (ERFs)
for seven crop types, we calculate the crop yield impact of climate
policy-induced reductions in tropospheric ozone mixing ratios.
Projecting future changes in crop yield onto current values of
agricultural output, we obtain the impacts shown in Fig. 5, where
monetary agricultural co-benefits are expressed in per capita
terms. The results for the NDC scenario highlight the areas where
ozone reductions overlap with high production values of ozone-
sensitive crops, such as maize, soybeans, and wheat in the US or
sugar cane and soybeans in Brazil. Whereas the NDCs globally
raise the yields of maize, rice, soy, and wheat by 0.4–0.7%,
0.1–0.3%, 0.8–1.1%, and 0.4–0.6% in 2030, respectively, more
ambitious climate policy limiting global warming to 2 °C
increases productivity of those crops by 0.8–1.5%, 0.2–0.8%,
1.8–2.7%, and 0.9–1.7% compared to the REF in 2030 (see also
Supplementary Table 42). Estimates of monetary agricultural co-
benefits corresponding to yield impacts for the year 2050 exceed
10$ per capita in some regions, when calculated using current-day
value of agricultural production. Importantly, increased agricul-
tural crop yields could contribute to reaching the Sustainable
Development Goal No hunger (SDG2).
Comparing climate policy’s costs and co-benefits. The air
quality co-benefits of the NDC and 2 °C-consistent climate
policies on avoided premature mortality, reduced lost work days
due to sickness, and improved agricultural crop yields more than
offset the cost of climate change mitigation policies on a global
average over the 2015–2050 period under the majority of scenario
settings (Fig. 6). This result implies that air quality provides
further justification to GHG abatement policies, in addition to
avoided climate change damages, which are not considered here.
Whereas crop yields and work days are reflected by a (agriculture
and labour) market value, the avoided premature mortality is
largely a nonmarket co-benefit, evaluated here by using the Value
of Statistical Life (VSL). The low, medium, and high VSLs are
heterogeneous across regions and grow with income over time
(Supplementary Table 43), as empirical studies typically find that
the willingness-to-pay for health risk reductions varies with
income. For comparison, we also include the results with a VSL
that is homogeneous across regions and fixed in time at a more
conservative value. Compared to an approach based on years of
life lost, the use of the same VSL for all deaths may bias the
valuation upwards when the population affected is characterised
by relatively old age, poor health conditions, and comparably
short life expectancy.
The value of air quality co-benefits per tonne of GHGs abated
differs substantially across regions. Relatively high values for
China confirm earlier findings10,12,41, while high numbers for
India point to the potential domestic gains if the country were to
step up the level of climate policy ambition. The results for
Europe reveal the transboundary benefits of the Paris Agreement
on a reduction of ozone mixing ratio worldwide. As relatively
ambitious climate policies are already adopted in the EU (hence
included in the REF), the additional GHG reductions to reach the
NDC target are relatively small, while the region’s air quality
improves also due to climate change mitigation efforts in other
regions. A high population density, relatively clean air in the REF
(which places the starting point for the health analysis in the steep
part of the non-linear ERF), strong energy efficiency improve-
ments in the residential and transport sectors, and an important
component of secondary PM (for which reductions tend to
correlate well with CO2 emission reductions, see SO2 and NOx in
Fig. 2) in overall particulate composition42 further contribute to
the co-benefits in Europe. The bottom–up nature of the Paris
pledges results in a wide range of mitigation costs across
countries. Results presented in Fig. 6 account for the impact on
competitiveness on international markets and incorporate the
macroeconomic cost of decreasing global demand for fossil fuel-
producing
countries’
exports.
The

on
crop
yields
(Supplementary Table 44) accounts for the growth of the
agricultural sector over time, in contrast to the results presented
in Fig. 5. Induced technological change is not included, which
may lead to the cost estimate to be biased upwards. In order to
attribute the impacts uniquely to climate policy, we derive the
costs (as well as the co-benefits) of climate policy by comparing
the NDC and 2 °C scenario with the REF under the same
assumption for air pollution control (e.g. REF—FLE vs. NDC—
FLE) and therefore exclude the costs of air pollution control
technologies.

 Discussion
Climate policy’s co-benefits related to air quality that are not
covered here include the reduced cost of air pollution control
measures43–46, the avoided health-care expenditures47–49, the
nonmarket value of reduced morbidity, the implications of GHG
reduction via land use for forest fires and related air pollution50,
indoor
air
quality
and
corresponding
human
health
outcomes51,52, the effects of acidification and eutrophication on
ecosystems (SDG15), and the impact of air pollution on human
capital formation and on-the-job performance53,54. Future work
could shed light on these issues in the context of the Paris
Agreement. The analysis presented here illustrates that the co-
benefits of climate policy depend on the stringency of air pollu-
tion control measures and the valuation of avoided premature
mortality, but additional sources of uncertainty can be found in
each step of the methodology. Future research efforts could assess
the combined uncertainty throughout the modelling chain based
on a multi-model assessment. A better measurement of (exposure
to) air pollution55,56, the inclusion of additional health endpoints
such as diabetes57, and revised estimates of disease-burden47,58
can further contribute to an improved understanding of the
health impacts of air pollution.
The analysis presented here quantifies the local and global air
quality co-benefits of climate policies (1) as pledged in the NDCs
and (2) in a scenario where countries ratchet up ambition levels
in order to curb global GHG emissions to reach the 2 °C tem-
perature goal, complementing recent work on the health effects of
a pathway compatible with 1.5 °C warming59. In addition to other
co-benefits of climate action, such as improved human health
through diet change60 and enhanced ecosystem services via land
use-based mitigation measures61, the synergies with air quality
call for an integrated policy perspective to enable progress in a
broader context of sustainability, as represented by the Sustain-
able Development Goals. This paper takes climate policy objec-
tives as a starting point, but long-term strategies to be submitted
by 2020 in accordance with Article 4 (Paragraph 19) of the Paris
Agreement can reach benefits beyond those presented here when
an integrated policy is designed explicitly to balance trade-offs
and ancillary benefits from the outset. Effective policymaking
should therefore account for multiple externalities in the pricing
of food and energy62, consider the interplay of various policy
design features, such as taxes and cap-and-trade mechanisms63,
and cover a broad range of pollutants, including short-lived cli-
mate forcers64–68. Future research should aim to show how
policies that provide the right market incentives for technology
trade-offs can exploit synergies and avoid lock-in effects in
infrastructure by combining effective short-term air pollution
control measures with an ambitious decarbonisation roadmap to
maximise benefits for climate and human health simultaneously.
Methods
GHG emissions and energy system. The energy and GHG emissions projections
were done using the POLES-JRC model. POLES-JRC69 is a global sectoral simu-
lation model for the development of long‐term energy demand and supply path-
ways with worldwide coverage. Projections are made on the basis of exogenous
economic growth, demographic projections, and energy resources for each region,
with prices driving the balance of supply and demand and international trade for
each type of energy. POLES-JRC describes energy and emissions balances for 54
individual countries and 12 regions; it identifies 14 fuel supply branches and 15
energy demand sectors, and >40 energy technologies with endogenous technical
progress. Energy-related GHG emissions are directly derived from the energy
balances; emissions from the industry sector are calculated using marginal abate-
ment curves derived from Environmental Protection Agency70; emissions for the
agriculture and land use emissions are obtained by using data from the GLOBIOM
model71,72 and are sensitive to the carbon price. The scenarios presented here were
developed using a methodology similar to that described in earlier work27, with

 similar sources for the assumptions on macroeconomic development and the same
set of policies considered for the REF, NDC, and 2 °C scenarios. The full detail on
GHG emissions per region and scenario is presented in the additional results. The
REF considers current and announced energy and climate policies only up to 2020.
The NDC scenario assumes attainment of the objectives put forward in the NDC
documents with the time horizon of 2025–2030. After 2030, we assume continued
decarbonisation effort such that at the world (not regional) level the rate of
decrease of the emissions intensity of the economy over 2030–2050 is the same to
that of 2020–2030. Importantly, the NDC scenario has been developed by scanning
all NDCs submitted to the UNFCCC and incorporating explicitly the policy details
on renewables, biofuels, electric vehicles, etc. The 2 °C takes the NDC scenario as a
starting point and lower limit and considers a 2011–2100 global carbon budget of
1100 GtCO2. Regionally differentiated carbon prices reflect common but differ-
entiated responsibilities as included in the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, negotiated at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 by assuming
carbon price convergence only by the year 2050, with convergence speed
depending on GDP per capita.
Air pollutant emissions. Air pollutant emissions, historical and projected, were
obtained using emission factors data multiplied by activity data for each sectoral
flow, endogenously produced by POLES-JRC. This was done for 35 sectoral flows
(sectoral and fuel-specific energy demand, industrial activity, population) for each
of the 6 pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO, BC, organic carbon, non-methane volatile
organic compounds). The emission factors were derived from the GAINS model73,
using information from the ECLIPSE exercise74.
Temperature changes. The corresponding ranges of temperature change, shown
in Fig. 1 for all three climate scenarios, are derived from the probabilistic version of
the MAGICC6 climate model75 with Bayesian sampling of parameters from a prior
probability distribution76.
Air pollution concentrations and mixing ratios. To compute pollutant con-
centrations from pollutant emission scenarios, we use the TM5-FASST model77, a
reduced-form air quality assessment tool, built on pairwise emission–concentration
sensitivities (so-called source–receptor coefficients (SRCs)) between 56 source
regions and individual 1°×1° receptor grid cells for each relevant emitted pollutant
or precursor.
The embedded sensitivities have been derived with the global two-way nested
chemistry-transport model TM578 with year 2001 meteorology, from a large set of
emission perturbation experiments, using Representative Concentration Pathway
(RCP) year 2000 emissions as a reference79, applying a −20% emission
perturbation on each precursor and for each single source region. The TM5-FASST
model delivers relevant exposure metrics (annual mean PM2.5, highest occurring
6-monthly mean of daily maximum hourly ozone, crop-growing season mean
daytime ozone). For the evaluation of arbitrary emission scenarios, the stored
sensitivities are linearly extrapolated using an appropriate scaling factor, thus by-
passing computationally expensive simulations and allowing for a fast screening of
large sets of scenarios or scenario ensembles.
TM5-FASST takes as input annual anthropogenic emission strengths of
individual pollutants and pollutant precursors (SO2, NOx, NH3, primary PM2.5
including BC and organic carbon, volatile organic components) aggregated at the
level of 56 pre-defined source regions (as identified in Supplementary Figure 1) and
produces approximate resulting pollutant grid maps of PM2.5 and ozone, based on
an implicit underlying spatial distribution of the emissions, originating in the
gridded reference RCP emissions on which the SRCs are based. Examples of
emission–pollutant source–receptor matrices include SO2 to sulphate, NOx to
nitrate and to ozone, NH3 to ammonia, and BC to BC (as primary pollutant). The
current study does not consider changes in natural PM2.5 components (mineral
dust, sea salt) to uniquely attribute changes in air quality to the climate policies.
Ambient PM2.5 is obtained as the sum of ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate,
and primary emitted PM2.5. Ozone is evaluated from NOx and volatile organic
compounds, including the long-term feedback of methane on background ozone.
In general, chemical processes leading to secondary pollutants involving multiple
precursors are non-linear and the embedded linearisation in TM5-FASST may lead
to biased estimates of PM2.5 concentrations and ozone mixing ratios. However,
validation studies77 have shown that the linearity assumption in TM5-FASST holds
sufficiently well for regionally averaged (population-weighted) PM2.5 and ozone
responses to precursor emission changes that deviate from −80% to +100% from
the reference emissions.
As described in earlier work77, TM5-FASST includes an optional urban
increment adjustment for sub-grid PM2.5 gradients. This adjustment was, however,
not applied in the current analysis as it requires gridded sector-wise emission fields
of the evaluated scenarios, which are not available in this study. Therefore,
resulting PM2.5 should be considered as lower bound values. For the health
analysis, PM2.5 concentrations from TM5-FASST have been adjusted to match the
World Bank data (2010) on PM2.5 exposure consistent with the Global Burden of
Disease (GBD) 201580 and taking into consideration improved exposure estimation
methods complemented by satellite and ground-level measurements56.
As described above, TM5-FASST takes as input emissions aggregated at the
level of the 56 pre-defined regions. For this study, native emission data were
available at the aggregation level as listed in additional results, except for the
European Union (28 countries) where data for individual countries were provided.
The available aggregation was remapped to the 56 TM5-FASST regions by first
downscaling POLES-JRC native regions to individual countries and subsequently
re-aggregating countries to the 56 TM5-FASST source regions. The downscaling
was done by individual IPCC sector, using RCP sector-segregated gridded
emissions as a proxy to establish the weight coefficient of each country within a

For each climate policy scenario in the current study, the closest matching RCP
scenario was selected to guide the mapping of the regional emissions to TM5-
FASST source regions. For the REF, NDC, and 2°scenario, we used RCP6.0,
RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively.
POLES-JRC sectors are mapped to the IPCC sectors as shown in Supplementary
Table 45. In order to reduce artefacts associated with the downscaling and
remapping of emissions between POLES-JRC and FASST regions, impacts are
aggregated to the regional scale. Population-weighted regional pollutant exposure is
obtained by interpolating TM5-FASST 1°×1° pollution grid maps to 0.5°×0.5° and
overlaying them with SSP gridded population maps at the same resolution for the
corresponding scenario year81. The regional population-weighted exposure to
pollutant P is then obtained as

where index i runs over all grid cells of the considered region and popi and Pi are

Co-benefits on avoided premature mortality. Here we use an impact pathway
analysis or alternatively labelled a systems approach that quantifies the pollutant
emissions from the moment they are released into the environment, followed by
atmospheric dispersion, and removal by deposition and chemical transformation,
and, finally, the impact on human health and the corresponding valuation. Five
causes of premature death linked to the PM2.5 pollution have been considered in
this study: ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and lower respiratory infection. For
the health impact of ground-level ozone, we consider chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease.
Health effect of changes in air pollution are calculated using epidemiological
associations (relative risks (RRs)) linking ambient air concentration to specific
health hazards in the general population. RR is defined as the ratio of health events
in a risk group exposed to air pollution compared to a control group that is
unexposed. RR of unity implies no risk difference between the two subpopulations.
ERFs are based on the GBD 201580. These associations are distinguished by
specific cause of death and in the case of cardiovascular mortality according to
different age groups37. The PM2.5 risk functions are non-linear with greater slope at
lower ambient air exposures above the minimum threshold of 2.4 μg m−3,
gradually levelling off at higher concentration values. The steepness varies
according to illness and age group. For ozone mortality, the ERFs are shaped like a
hockey stick, with no increase in the mortality risk up to a minimum concentration
of 37.6 ppb (75 μg m−3), also known as the theoretically minimum risk exposure
level, and thereafter the risk varies as a log-linear function of the concentration
level (measured in ppb units) above the threshold. For pollutant p, cause of death c,
country i and year t, the ERF translates concentration (C) to an RR factor:
RRp;c;i;t ¼ ERFp;c;aðCp;i;tÞ
ð4Þ
This RR factor is the basis to calculate the Population Attributable Fraction
(PAF), which measures the attributable share of the total burden of disease that is
related to ambient air pollution:
PAFp;c;i;t ¼ 1 �
1
RRp;c;i;t
ð5Þ
Note that the formula above is equivalent to the WHO definition (http://www.
who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_paf/en/) since we calculate
premature mortality based on population-weighted country-level aggregate levels
of concentration with the RR under ideal exposure to air pollution equal to unity.
The number of premature deaths (PD) is then obtained by multiplying the PAF
with the cause-specific Baseline Mortality (BM):
PDp;c;i;t ¼ BMc;i;t � PAFp;c;i;t
ð6Þ
Although we interpret these deaths as linked to air pollution, we should note
that air pollution acts in combination with other underlying diseases in the
population that ultimately result in premature mortality or otherwise loss of
expected remaining life. Deaths solely caused by air pollution, i.e. initiated by air
pollution in isolation of other health risk factors, are likely to be lower. In the above
expression, the cause-specific BM is specified based on GBD 2015 as
BMc;i;t ¼ ABMi;t �
BMc;i;t¼2015
P
c BMc;i;t¼2015

in which the All-cause, natural Baseline Mortality (ABM) is obtained by
multiplying UN forecasts of population (medium fertility scenario) with UN crude
mortality rate projections82 and a scaling factor to reconcile UN data with GBD
2015:
δi ¼

ð8Þ
The numbers are presented by region in Supplementary Table 46.
Co-benefits on lost work days. Pollution-related illness was calculated assuming
that the percentage change in the number of cases of morbidity between scenarios
were proportional to changes in the projected mortality. In particular, lost work
days from air pollution-related illnesses were calculated using a morbidity-to-
mortality multiplier of 547 avoided lost work days per avoided premature mor-
tality, derived from the WHO-HRAPIE83 recommendations, based on earlier
work84, and applied in the context of EU Clean Air Package85. More specifically,
based on the supporting document86, we calculate a multiplier on the EU aggregate
level:
Lost work days2010
Premature mortality2010 ¼ 121378612 days
380196 deaths ¼ 319 lost work days per premature mortality ð9Þ
Next, this number is corrected by a calibration factor that reflects the use of
GBD 2015 ERFs in this study relative to WHO-HRAPIE:
Premature mortalityHRAPIE ERF
2015
Premature mortalityGBD ERF
2015
¼ 441326 deaths
257544 deaths ¼ 1:71
ð10Þ
The resulting morbidity-to-mortality multiplier is in the same order of
magnitude as the multiplier used in other studies87,88 of approximately 445 lost
work days per premature mortality. One advantage of this approach is that the
non-linear health response to air pollution is automatically accounted for.
However, applying the same morbidity-to-mortality multiplier across space and
time is a rough approximation that should be interpreted with caution and could be
improved in future work by expanding the evidence base on air pollution-related
morbidity and labour supply responses, as illustrated by recent work89.
Co-benefits on crop yields. Translating changes in ground-level ozone mixing
ratios to yield impacts is done through ERFs. These crop-specific functions relate
ozone exposure to yield and are based on literature90 for wheat, maize, rice, and
soy. Three generic classes of ERFs were estimated for high, medium, and low
sensitivity crops. Based on a meta-analysis91, another 23 crop categories were
allocated to these generic categories (see Supplementary Table 47). Using the
changes in ozone mixing ratios across climate scenarios (keeping air pollution
control scenario fixed to FLE, SLE, or BAT) and the ERFs, we obtain the yield
impact in percentage terms by crop, climate scenario, air pollution control sce-
nario, country, and year. Next, we aggregate crop productivity impacts across crops
and regions using 5-year average (2009–2013) gross production values from
FAOSTAT (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV).
Integrated economic framework. For the economic valuation of co-benefits, we
follow a hybrid approach that combines market and nonmarket benefits, mirroring
the methodology recently applied in the literature assessing the economic impacts
of climate change92. The market co-benefits for labour markets through a reduc-
tion of lost work days due to illness (PM2.5) and for agriculture markets via
improved crop yields (O3) are fed into the global economy-wide computable
general equilibrium (CGE) model JRC-GEM-E3 to assess the broader economic
impacts. Avoided lost work days translate to an expansion of the labour supply,
while crop yield benefits are implemented through raised total factor productivity
in the agricultural sector. The methodology builds on earlier work on air pollu-
tion93 and allows inclusion of feedback effects via firms’ supply chains, via
households’ income, and via international trade. The impact of changes in com-
petitiveness on international trade may be especially important for agricultural
crops that are traded on global markets, while general equilibrium effects could be
substantial for the impact through changes in labour supply because a rise in
income generates additional demand for goods. The valuation of avoided pre-
mature mortality does not enter the CGE model but is monetised by using the
VSLs discussed in the next section. For mortality, earlier work92 shows that the
nonmarket component by far exceeds the market component (e.g. lost earnings).

 The JRC-GEM-E3 model describes consumer and producer behaviour;
represents government policies such as taxes, subsidies, transfers, and emission
caps; captures endogenously the international trade flows based on (changes in)
relative prices; and includes macro feedback mechanisms via forward and
backward supply chain linkages and via labour market, wages, and employment
effects. The model is designed to also estimate the cost of climate change mitigation
policies, as presented in Fig. 6 and in earlier work27. In addition to common
baseline pathways for economic growth, population projections, and GHG
emissions, the POLES-JRC and JRC-GEM-E3 are fully harmonised in terms of
GHG emissions and the regional electricity generation technology mix in the
scenarios studied. A more extensive description of the model and the mathematical
expressions can be found in the model documentation94. The regional aggregation
used in this paper is shown in Supplementary Table 48. The metric best used to
assess cost and benefits in this framework is welfare changes in terms of equivalent
variation, which measures the difference in expenditure needed to bridge the
change in utility levels at base prices. The costs and co-benefits presented in this
paper are undiscounted.
VSL across regions and time. The VSL, taking into account heterogeneity across
regions i and over time t, is specified in relation to real income per capita (It
i) in the
following way:
VSLt
i ¼ VSL2005
USA �
It
i
I2005
USA
�
�0:8
ð11Þ
In this equation, It
i is expressed as GDP per capita at purchasing power parity.
The income elasticity is chosen to be 0.8, which is more conservative than some
earlier studies10 but still within the range recommended by the OECD95. We
should note here that some studies96 discuss income elasticity values >1, which
would lower the valuation of avoided premature mortality for regions with GDP
per capita lower than the level in the USA in 2005. The low and high values for
VSL2005
USA are based on values found in previous literature10, while the medium value
provides an intermediate case. The resulting values of statistical life are given in
Supplementary Table 43. The alternative case with a VSL of 1.5 million US$(2005)
that is constant over time is included to address ethical concerns, for comparability
across regions, and because from the perspective of a global policymaker,
introducing distributional weights that reflect inequality preferences in welfare
aggregation would counteract heterogeneity in VSL across regions97.
