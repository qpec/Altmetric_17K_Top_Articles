 Summary
Pharmacological ascorbate has been proposed as a potential anti-cancer agent when combined 
with radiation and chemotherapy. The anti-cancer effects of ascorbate are hypothesized to involve 
the autoxidation of ascorbate leading to increased steady-state levels of H2O2; however, the 
mechanism(s) for cancer cell-selective toxicity remain unknown. The current study shows that 
alterations in cancer cell mitochondrial oxidative metabolism resulting in increased levels of O2•− 
and H2O2 are capable of disrupting intracellular iron metabolism thereby selectively sensitizing 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma (GBM) cells to ascorbate through pro-
oxidant chemistry involving redox active labile iron and H2O2. In addition, preclinical studies and 
clinical trials demonstrate the feasibility, selective toxicity, tolerability, and potential efficacy of 
pharmacological ascorbate in GBM and NSCLC therapy.
Graphical Abstract
Schoenfeld et al. show that cancer cells are selectively sensitive to ascorbate due to their altered 
redox active iron metabolism. They present preclinical and clinical data demonstrating the 
feasibility, tolerability, and potential efficacy of pharmacological ascorbate for treating 
glioblastoma and lung cancer.
Introduction
Intravenous pharmacological doses of ascorbate have recently re-emerged as a potential anti-
cancer therapy with clinical trials in ovarian and pancreatic cancer subjects demonstrating 
tolerability with similar or reduced toxicities, relative to chemotherapy alone (Ma et al., 
2014; Monti et al., 2012; Welsh et al., 2013). Preclinical studies with ascorbate have 
consistently demonstrated cancer cell-selective cytotoxicity in a variety of disease sites (Du 
et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2014; Riordan et al., 1995). Although the mechanism(s) of selective 
toxicity remain unknown, mounting evidence suggests that ascorbate toxicity is dependent

 on ascorbate’s action as a pro-drug for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation (Chen et al., 
2005, 2007; Olney et al., 2013).
Interestingly, both H2O2 toxicity and ascorbate oxidation forming H2O2 are dependent upon 
metal ion redox chemistry (Buettner and Jurkiewicz, 1996; Du et al., 2015a; Halliwell and 
Gutteridge, 1990). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that perturbations in cancer cell 
oxidative metabolism result in increased steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), including superoxide (O2•−) and H2O2 (Bize et al., 1980; Szatrowski and Nathan, 
1991; Spitz et al., 2000; Aykin-Burns et al., 2009), and that these species may be capable of 
disrupting cellular iron metabolism leading to increased labile iron pool (LIP) levels 
(Caltagirone et al., 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2013; Pantopoulos et al., 1997). Indeed, many 
cancer cells exhibit disruptions in iron metabolism with up-regulation of several iron-uptake 
pathways, such as transferrin receptor (TfR), as well as down-regulation of iron export and 
storage pathways (Torti and Torti, 2013).
The current study examines the role of O2 •−- and H2O2-mediated disruptions in cancer cell 
iron metabolism in the selective toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate. Additionally, this 
study investigates the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of pharmacological ascorbate 
in combination with standard-of-care radio-chemotherapies in GBM and advanced stage 
NSCLC subjects.
Results
Pharmacological ascorbate selectively sensitizes NSCLC and GBM cells, as compared to 
normal cells, to radio-chemotherapy
The efficacy of ascorbate in pre-clinical NSCLC and GBM models was assessed using 
clonogenic survival assays and murine xenografts. Comparisons of the effects of ascorbate 
in cancer vs. normal cells in vitro were performed in identical media preparations due to the 
dependence of ascorbate toxicity on media constituents including pyruvate, metal ions, pH, 
and serum (Olney et al., 2013; Buettner, 1988; Nath et al., 1995; Clément et al., 2001; Mojić 
et al., 2014). Additionally, ascorbate was dosed per cell (pmol cell−1), rather than by 
concentration, due to the dependence of ascorbate and H2O2 toxicity on cell density (Figure 
S1A) (Doskey et al., 2015; Spitz et al., 1987). In all in vitro experiments, both dosing 
metrics are indicated, where available, as concentration-based metrics will be vital in future 
clinical applications of ascorbate. Importantly, doses utilized to demonstrate mechanistic 
aspects of ascorbate toxicity all fall within the range of tissue concentrations likely achieved 
in vivo after intravenous administration (Chen et al., 2008; Kuiper et al., 2014; Campbell et 
al., 2016).
Exposure of NSCLC cells (H292 and H1299) and GBM cells (U87 and U118) to increasing 
doses of ascorbate demonstrated dose-dependent clonogenic cell killing (Figures 1A, 1B). In 
all cases, ascorbate was significantly more toxic to NSCLC and GBM cells, relative to 
normal human bronchial epithelial primary cells (HBEpCs) or normal human astrocytes 
(NHAs) (Figures 1A, 1B; Figures S1B–D). Furthermore, ascorbate selectively sensitized 
NSCLC and GBM cells, but not HBEpC or NHA, to ionizing radiation (IR) combined with 
chemotherapy (Figures 1C, 1D).

 NSCLC and GBM xenograft studies demonstrated that ascorbate [4 g kg−1 intraperitoneal 
injection (IP), daily] combined with radio-chemotherapy significantly increased overall 
survival, as compared to radio-chemotherapy alone (Figures 2A, 2B). Ascorbate treatment 
was well tolerated as monitored by mouse weight (Figure 2C), and IP delivery significantly 
increased ascorbate levels in the plasma, tumor, and cerebrospinal fluid in samples collected 
at a single time point 1 hr (therefore, not necessarily peak levels) after ascorbate 
administration (Figures 2D, 2E). These data establish the tolerability and efficacy of 
pharmacological ascorbate in preclinical models of NSCLC and GBM and support the 
existence of an intrinsic mechanism of selective ascorbate toxicity in cancer vs. normal cells.
Selective ascorbate toxicity is not dependent on dehydroascorbate (DHA) uptake
A recent report by Yun et al. (2015) suggested that the differential uptake of the 2-electron 
oxidation product of ascorbate, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), by glucose transporters 
(GLUTs) in KRAS and BRAF mutant isogenic colorectal cells mediates the energetic crisis 
underlying the differential toxicity of ascorbate in cancer versus normal cells (Yun et al. 
2015). However, in the more complex genetic background used in the current report (Table 
S1), KRAS status alone did not predict ascorbate sensitivity in NSCLC cells (Figure S1B). 
Furthermore, competitive inhibition of GLUT transporters with 20 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose 
(2-DG) did not suppress ascorbate toxicity and appeared to potentially enhance ascorbate 
toxicity, suggesting that uptake through GLUT-transporters does not contribute to the 
observed effects in these model systems (Figure 3A). Importantly, previous reports 
demonstrate inhibition of DHA uptake by 20 mM 2-DG (Rumsey et al., 1997), and in the 
current model, 20 mM 2-DG inhibited total ascorbate/DHA uptake by 37% (Figure 3B). 
Furthermore, DHA was significantly less toxic as compared to ascorbate (Figure 3C). Taken 
together, these results support the conclusion that ascorbate, not DHA, is the cancer cell-
selective toxic species in the current model system.
Ascorbate toxicity is dependent on the intracellular reactions of H2O2 and redox-active 
labile iron
Confirming the generality of the previously reported dependence of ascorbate toxicity on the 
generation of H2O2 (Chen et al., 2005, 2007; Olney et al., 2013), ascorbate toxicity in 
NSCLC and GBM cells was inhibited by exogenous catalase or adenoviral-mediated 
overexpression of catalase (AdCat) or glutathione peroxidase 1 (AdGPx1) (Figures 4A–C; 
Figure S2A). As both H2O2 toxicity and ascorbate oxidation to generate H2O2 are dependent 
upon metal ion redox chemistry (Buettner and Jurkiewicz, 1996; Du et al., 2015a; Halliwell 
and Gutteridge, 1990), it follows that ascorbate toxicity may be dependent on intracellular 
pro-oxidant metal ion chemistry, as has previously been suggested in breast and prostate 
cancer (Verrax and Calderon, 2009). Indeed, chelators that inhibit redox cycling of iron 
(desferrioxamine, DFO; diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, DTPA) (Buettner, 1986) 
significantly inhibited ascorbate toxicity in both NSCLC and GBM cell lines (Figure 4D; 
Figures S2B, S2C).
To further test the role of redox active metal ions, H292 cells were pre-incubated for 3 hr 
with DFO/DTPA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; known to enhance iron redox 
cycling) (Buettner, 1986) and washed prior to ascorbate treatment or chelator treated media

 was added to the cells only during ascorbate exposure, providing conditions in which the 
chelators were either primarily intracellular or extracellular during ascorbate exposure. 
Intracellular DFO/DTPA inhibited ascorbate toxicity while intracellular EDTA enhanced 
ascorbate toxicity relative to control or extracellular chelators (Figure 4E; Figure S3). 
Additionally, increasing the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) with exogenous Fe2+, as 
ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS), sensitized H292 NSCLC cells to ascorbate (Figure 4F). 
These results support the hypothesis that the combination of H2O2 and intracellular redox-
active metal ions is necessary and sufficient for ascorbate toxicity and suggest that 
differences in cellular iron metabolism regulating the level of redox active iron may mediate 
the mechanism of cancer cell-selective ascorbate toxicity.
Disturbances in oxidative metabolism selectively sensitizes cancer cells to ascorbate 
through disruptions in iron metabolism
There is a growing body of literature demonstrating that disruptions in cancer cell oxidative 
metabolism results in increased steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
including superoxide (O2•−) and H2O2 (Bize et al., 1980; Springer, 1980; Spitz et al., 2000; 
Aykin-Burns et al., 2009; Szatrowski and Nathan, 1991). Furthermore, O2•− and H2O2 have 
been proposed, under certain conditions, to disrupt homeostatic cellular iron metabolism 
(Caltagirone et al., 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2013; Pantopoulos et al., 1997), and a growing body 
of literature suggests that, in general, cancer cells demonstrate increased levels of 
intracellular labile iron (Torti and Torti, 2013). Given these previous observations, we 
hypothesized that increased mitochondrial-derived ROS leading to disruptions in cellular 
iron metabolism may underlie the selective mechanism of ascorbate toxicity.
Supporting this hypothesis, following lobectomy, fresh frozen NSCLC tissue, demonstrated 
increased steady-state levels of O2•− as determined by superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic 
(GC4419)-inhibitable dihydroethidium (DHE) oxidation (Figure 5A; Figures S4, S5A), as 
well as increased labile iron (Figure 5B; Figure S4) compared to adjacent normal tissue. 
These results support the hypothesis that increased steady-state levels of O2•− lead to an 
increased LIP that could sensitize cancer cells to ascorbate in human tissues.
To directly test this hypothesis, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was utilized to delete the 
mitochondrial superoxide dismutase gene, SOD2, in A549 NSCLC cells (SOD2−/−) (Figures 
S5B, S5C), which are relatively resistant to ascorbate-mediated cell killing. As predicted, 
SOD2−/− cells demonstrated increased steady-state levels of O2•− (Figure 5C), a significantly 
increased LIP (Figure 5D), as well as increased susceptibility to pharmacological ascorbate-
induced clonogenic cell killing (Figure 5E). Demonstrating the generality of this finding, 
identical results were obtained in HEL 92.1.7 erythroleukemia SOD2−/− cells (Figures S5D–
I). The above results demonstrate that increased steady-state levels of O2•− are capable of 
disrupting cellular iron metabolism, increasing the intracellular LIP, and sensitizing 
ascorbate-resistant cancer cell lines.
Consistent with results from a large immunohistochemical study demonstrating increased 
transferrin receptor (TfR) levels in NSCLC tissue as compared to adjacent normal lung 
tissue (Kukulj et al., 2010), NSCLC and GBM cell lines demonstrated increased TfR levels 
compared to HBEpCs or NHAs, respectively (Figure 5F; Figure S5J) Interestingly, in cancer

 cells, increased TfR is seen in the context of increased labile iron content (Figure 5B). 
Further supporting the role of increased O2•− in disruption of iron metabolism in cancer 
cells, SOD2−/− cells exhibited increased TfR protein levels compared to WT parental cells in 
the context of an increased basal LIP (Figures 5D, 5G; Figures S5G, S5H). Demonstrating 
the causal role of cancer cell-specific TfR up-regulation in ascorbate sensitivity, siRNA 
knockdown of TfR significantly decreased the cellular LIP and protected H1299 cells from 
ascorbate toxicity (Figures 5H, 5I).
In order to overcome technical limitations of genetic approaches in non-immortalized human 
cells, a pharmacological approach was utilized to increase mitochondrial O2•− in NHAs by 
inhibiting electron flow through complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC) with 
antimycin A (AntA). Exposure of NHAs to 25 μM AntA significantly increased DHE 
oxidation, cellular labile iron, and sensitized NHAs to ascorbate-mediated cell killing 
(Figure 5J). Consistent with the proposed mechanism that the lower LIP in normal cells 
limits ascorbate toxicity, exposure of NHAs to exogenous Fe2+, as FAS, increased the 
intracellular LIP and sensitized NHAs to ascorbate toxicity (Figure 5K). Together, these data 
support the conclusion that cancer-cell specific increases in LIP, as a result of perturbed 
mitochondrial O2•− metabolism, significantly contributes to the differential sensitivity of 
human lung and brain cancer cells to ascorbate toxicity.
Ascorbate selectively increases cancer cell LIP through H2O2-mediated disruptions of Fe-
S containing proteins
In addition to basal differences in labile iron (Figure 5B), NSCLC and GBM cells 
demonstrated significant dose-dependent ascorbate-induced increases in cellular LIP that 
were not seen in HBEpCs or NHAs (Figures 6A, 6B; Figures S6A). This finding was 
consistent with previous ex vivo studies showing ascorbate increased labile iron in 
pancreatic cancer xenograft lysates (Boyer and McCleary, 1987; Moser et al., 2014). 
Importantly, although these doses induce cancer cell clonogenic cell killing, metabolic 
viability determined with trypan blue dye or the reduction of resazurin 1–1.5 hr post 
ascorbate exposure was unchanged, demonstrating that changes in LIP seen at 1 hr are not a 
consequence of metabolic cell death (Figure S6B). In intact cells, disruption of the integrity 
of Fe-S cluster proteins may contribute to ascorbate-mediated increases in LIP as evidenced 
by the inactivation of the Fe-S cluster-containing proteins aconitase and mitochondrial ETC 
complexes I and II, while having no effect on ETC complex IV activity, which contains no 
Fe-S clusters (Figure 6C, 6D). The loss of Fe-S cluster protein activity as well as the 
increased LIP seen in ascorbate-treated cancer cells was prevented by catalase 
overexpression (Figures 6C, 6E, 6F) but not SOD1 or SOD2 (Figure 6G), implicating H2O2 
as the causative agent in ascorbate-induced increases in LIP.
Consistent with LIP redox cycling contributing to the selective toxicity of ascorbate in 
cancer cells, ascorbate increased steady-state levels of H2O2 (as measured by the H2O2 
sensitive fluorescent probe PeroxyOrange-1) from baseline in NSCLC cells while remaining 
unchanged in HBEpCs, a phenomenon not seen with excess genuine H2O2 used as a positive 
control (Figure 6H; Figures S6C, S6D). Additionally, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of 
Ft heavy chain (Ft-H; contains ferroxidase activity required for iron storage) significantly

 decreased basal LIP as compared to cells overexpressing Ft light chain (Ft-L; lacks 
ferroxidase activity) or control cells (Figures 6I, 6J). Interestingly, only Ft-H overexpression 
inhibited ascorbate-induced increases in LIP as well as ascorbate-mediated toxicity (Figures 
6K, 6L; Figure S6E).
Pharmacological ascorbate is safe, tolerable, and potentially efficacious in combination 
with radio-chemotherapy in GBM and advanced stage NSCLC
These preclinical studies in GBM led to a phase I clinical trial assessing the safety and 
tolerability of pharmacological ascorbate in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) and 
temozolomide (TMZ) in GBM subjects (NCT 01752491) (Table S2; Figure S7A). Following 
maximum safe surgical resection or biopsy (if unresectable), subjects received radiation 
(daily), temozolomide (daily), and intravenous (IV) ascorbate infusions (three times a week) 
for approximately 7 weeks (radiation phase; Stupp et al., 2005a). For each subsequent 
subject, ascorbate doses were escalated during the radiation phase (15 – 125 g infusion) with 
a 20 mM target plasma concentration (infusion dose denoted next to each subject # in Figure 
7A; Welsh et al., 2013). Following conclusion of the radiation phase, all subjects were dose 
escalated to achieve ≥ 20 mM plasma ascorbate in combination with temozolomide for 
approximately 28 weeks (for a total therapy duration of ~35 weeks; Figure 7A). The desired 
mean therapeutic blood level was achieved in all subjects receiving the 87.5 g infusions (Fig. 
7B; Figures S7B, S7C).
Pharmacological ascorbate was safe and well tolerated in all 13 subjects who participated in 
the trial with minimal grade 3 and 4 toxicities, which compared favorably to Stupp et al. 
(2005) (Tables S3, S4). Non-hematological toxicities observed in the phase 1 trial during the 
radiation phase included grade 2 and 3 fatigue, grade 2 and 3 nausea, grade 2 infection, and 
grade 3 vomiting. In the adjuvant phase, observed toxicities included grade 2 fatigue, grade 
2 nausea, grade 1 vomiting, grade 3 leukopenia, and grade 3 neutropenia. No serious adverse 
events in the radiation phase or adjuvant phase were ascribed to pharmacological ascorbate 
treatment and all subjects maintained their performance status throughout the treatment.
Although the small number of subjects prevent a statistically significant assessment of 
efficacy (11 subjects; 2 subjects were removed from longevity analysis due to limited 
protocol dictated therapy due to unrelated co-morbidities), average progression free survival 
(PFS) currently stands at 13.3 months (median: 9.4 months) vs. the historical median PFS of 
7 months (Stupp et al., 2005a), and average overall survival (OS) is currently 21.5 months 
(median: 18.2 months) vs. historical median of 14 months. Furthermore, 4 subjects remain 
alive, with 1 showing no evidence of disease based on MR imaging (Figures 7A, 7C). 
Importantly, the characteristics of the subject population were not significantly different than 
the subject characteristics from Stupp et al. (2005) (Table S5).
Most interestingly, a companion study published by Stupp et al. (2005) analyzed the 
methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene (MGMT) 
promoter (Hegi et al., 2005) and demonstrated a significant reduction in survival in GBM 
subjects receiving concurrent radiation and temozolomide that lacked MGMT promoter 
methylation (median overall survival = 12.7 vs. 21.7 months). In the Stupp et al. (2005) trial 
(Hegi et al., 2005), MGMT promoter methylation was absent in 57% of the GBM subjects.

 In comparison, MGMT promoter methylation was absent in 73% of the subjects in the 
current phase I clinical trial and median overall survival for subjects lacking MGMT 
promoter methylation is 23.0 months (vs. 12.7 months in Hegi et al., 2005). Additionally, 3 
of 8 subjects lacking MGMT promoter methylation in the current trial remain alive, with 1 
showing no evidence of disease based on MR imaging (Figures 7A, 7D).
Furthermore, the initial results (n = 14 subjects) from a phase II clinical trial assessing the 
efficacy of pharmacological ascorbate with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in advanced 
stage NSCLC (NCT 02420314) (Figure S8A; Table S6) also demonstrate promising results 
in achieving therapeutic ascorbate blood levels (16.4 ± 0.5 mM; Figure S8B, S8C) and 
achieved a disease control rate of 93% and a confirmed objective response rate of 29%, as 
compared to historical controls with 40% disease control rates and 15–19% confirmed 
objective response rates (Figure 7E, 7F) (Schiller et al., 2002; Sandler et al., 2006).
Discussion
The combination of high-dose intravenous and oral ascorbate was first proposed as a 
potential anti-cancer agent in 1976 (Cameron and Pauling, 1976). However, two randomized 
clinical trials testing the efficacy of high-dose oral ascorbate failed to demonstrate any effect 
on survival (Creagan et al., 1979; Moertel et al., 1985). Subsequent pharmacokinetic studies 
demonstrated the inability of oral ascorbate dosing to reach therapeutic plasma levels 
(Padayatty et al., 2004). This finding revitalized interest in ascorbate as an adjuvant to 
cancer therapy and demonstrated the need to confirm plasma levels of ascorbate to ensure 
therapeutic concentrations are achieved (Welsh et al., 2013). With this more complete 
understanding of ascorbate pharmacokinetics, this work, and others in pancreatic and 
ovarian cancer, have consistently demonstrated selective toxicity to cancer cells as compared 
to normal cells both in vitro and in vivo (Du et al., 2010; Monti et al., 2012; Welsh et al., 
2013; Ma et al., 2014). Furthermore, the results of the current clinical trials, together with 
the results of all previous clinical trials that we are aware of, continue to demonstrate a lack 
of ascorbate toxicity in normal tissue when combined with chemotherapy or radio-
chemotherapies. Additionally, preliminary data from both the GBM and NSCLC trials 
presented here show promising results for potentially increasing efficacy of current 
treatment regimens.
The mechanism underlying the cancer cell-selective toxicity of ascorbate has remained 
incompletely understood since Cameron and Rotman first hypothesized the utility of 
pharmacological ascorbate in cancer therapy (Cameron and Rotman, 1972). Recently, Yun et 
al. hypothesized that the selective toxicity of ascorbate in KRAS and BRAF mutant clones 
was facilitated by increased glucose transporter (GLUT)-mediated uptake of 
dehydroascorbate and subsequent NAD+ depletion and energetic crisis (Yun et al., 2015). In 
the current study, GLUT-mediated DHA uptake demonstrated a minimal role in ascorbate 
toxicity in these model systems. Furthermore, consistent with the mechanism of ROS-
mediated disruptions in cellular iron metabolism underlying the selective toxicity of 
ascorbate, KRAS and BRAF mutant cells have been suggested to demonstrate increased 
mitochondrial-derived ROS (Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013; Liou et al., 2016).

 The results of the current study demonstrate that increased LIP levels, resulting from 
increased mitochondrial O2•− and H2O2, significantly contribute to the cancer cell-selective 
toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate combined with standard radio-chemotherapy in 
NSCLC and GBM models. The theoretical model (Figure 8) illustrates that increased labile 
iron in cancer cells results in increased oxidation of ascorbate to generate H2O2 capable of 
further exacerbating the differences in labile iron in cancer vs. normal cells. This occurs, at 
least partially, due to H2O2-mediated disruption of Fe-S cluster containing proteins. The 
increased levels of H2O2, in the presence of an increased LIP, result in increased Fenton 
chemistry to generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) causing oxidative damage. These reactions 
most likely occur at sites of macromolecule-associated weakly chelated redox-active iron 
due to the diffusion-limited kinetics of •OH.
In normal cells, with reduced levels of basal and ascorbate-mediated increases in O2•−, 
H2O2, and labile iron, H2O2 is rapidly metabolized prior to participating in pro-oxidant 
chemistry. Under normal cell conditions, therefore, the pro-oxidant actions of ascorbate are 
neutralized by increased H2O2 metabolism (Doskey et al., 2016) in the presence of a 
restricted labile iron pool, and the antioxidant actions of ascorbate prevail. In support of this, 
pharmacological ascorbate has been proposed to protect IR-mediated damage to jejunal 
crypts in mice (Du et al., 2015b) and decrease chemotherapy-associated adverse events in 
ovarian cancer subjects (Ma et al., 2014).
Since cancer cells, in general, have been hypothesized to demonstrate increased steady-state 
levels of O2•− and H2O2 due to fundamental defects in oxidative metabolism (Bize et al., 
1980; Spitz et al., 2000; Aykin-Burns et al., 2009; Oberley et al., 1980) and increased labile 
iron (Torti and Torti, 2013; Caltagirone et al., 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2013; Pantopoulos et al., 
1997), the current findings, combined with similar findings in pancreas and ovarian cancer 
(Monti et al., 2012; Welsh et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2014), continue to support the potential for 
the general application of pharmacological ascorbate in cancer therapy. Given these data, 
ascorbate may represent an easily implementable addition to current anti-cancer therapies 
and further large-scale clinical studies are warranted to determine the overall efficacy of 
ascorbate in NSCLC and GBM. Finally, manipulations of redox active metal ions in cancer 
cells may represent both a target and a biomarker for predicting responses to 
pharmacological ascorbate in cancer therapy.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Cell Lines and Primary Cultures—NSCLC cell lines H292 (source: female), H1299 
(source: male), H23 (source: male), and A549 (source: male) and HEL 92.1.7 cells (source: 
male) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were gown in proprietary HBE

 medium and growth supplements (Cell Applications, Inc). HBEpCs from both a male and 
female source were utilized in this manuscript. GBM cell lines U87 (source: male), U118 
(source: male), U251 (source: male), and normal human astrocytes (NHA) (sources: two 
male cultures) were grown in DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 10 μg 
mL−1 insulin, 7.5 ng mL−1 fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 15 mM 
HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), and 100 units/100 μg mL−1 penicillin/streptomycin.
As primary cells in culture grow better under normoxic conditions (4% O2) (Packer and 
Fuehr, 1977) and this manuscript investigates intrinsic differences between cancer and 
primary cells, all cells were incubated at 4% O2 in a humidity controlled environment 
(37 °C, 5% CO 2; Forma Scientific). Importantly, we did not see any difference in toxicity in 
cancer cells exposed to ascorbate for 1 hr in 21% or 4% O2 (data not shown). In all 
experiments utilizing HEL 92.1.7 and A549 parental and SOD2−/− cells, cells were 
maintained and experiments were performed at 21% O2 to maximize effects on superoxide 
production. All cell lines were utilized before passage 20 and treated in exponential growth 
phase at 50–75% confluence. Doubling times of HBEpCs and NHAs were monitored and 
cells were utilized until doubling time increased by 50%.
In Vivo Mouse Studies—Female 4–6 week old athymic nude mice (Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu) 
were purchased from Envigo (previously Harlan Laboratories) and housed in the Animal 
Care Facility at The University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA), and all procedures were approved 
by The University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to 
NIH guidelines. All mice were treatment naïve at the time of tumor cell introduction. For all 
xenograft studies, after tumors were established, mice were randomly assigned to 
experimental groups. Mouse weights throughout the experiments are illustrated in Figure 
2C.
Clinical Trials—For the phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety of combining 
pharmacological ascorbate with standard radiation and temozolomide in glioblastoma 
(GBM) patients, approval was sought, and obtained, from The University of Iowa 
Institutional Review Board (Biomedical IRB-01; IRB 201211713). For the phase II clinical 
evaluating the efficacy of combining carboplatin and paclitaxel with pharmacological 
ascorbate in advanced stage (stage IIIB and IV) NSCLC patients, approval was sought, and 
obtained, from The University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (Biomedical IRB-01; IRB 
201412760). Both trials were registered with clinicaltrials.gov prior to enrollment of the first 
subject (NCT01752491 and NCT02420314, respectively). Both clinical trials were 
conducted compliant with good clinical practice, including obtaining informed consent 
directly from all trial participants; none of the elements of consent were waived.
Method Details
Ascorbate and Ascorbate Exposure—L-Ascorbic acid stock solution (approx. 1 M) 
was made in Nanopure® Type 1 water (18 MΩ) with the pH adjusted to 7.0 with 1 M NaOH, 
stored in sealed glass tubes with minimal head space, and the precise concentration was 
confirmed spectrophotometrically as previously described (265 nm, ε = 14.5 mM−1 cm−1) 
(Buettner, 1988). For all experiments directly comparing the effects of ascorbate on cancer

 and normal cells, ascorbate is dosed per cell due to previous literature demonstrating that 
H2O2 and ascorbate toxicity is dependent on cell number/density (Doskey et al., 2015; Spitz 
et al., 1987). Furthermore, the media conditions, including media volume, during cancer vs. 
normal comparisons are identical, as media constitution (i.e. serum, pyruvate and other α-
ketoacids, metal ions, etc.) and media pH (i.e. lactate production) modulate ascorbate 
toxicity and can account for apparent differences in cell sensitivity to ascorbate within a 
given cell type (Buettner, 1988; Spitz et al., 1987; Olney et al., 2013; Nath et al., 1995; 
Clément et al., 2001; Mojić et al., 2014). For NSCLC and HBEpC comparisons, cells were 
exposed to ascorbate in serum-free RPMI supplemented with HBE media supplements and 
returned to their normal maintenance media for cloning. For clinical dosing, the studies 
utilize commercially available, prescription-only L-ascorbic acid for intravenous injection 
(500 mg mL−1).
Although the data investigating tissue ascorbate concentrations following pharmacological 
ascorbate administration is limited, initial measurements of ascorbate levels in syngeneic 
mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma tumors following 1 g kg−1 IP ascorbate resulted in peak 
plasma concentrations of 4.7 ± 0.6 mM that resulted in peak tumor tissue homogenate 
concentrations of 1.04 μmoles g−1 wet weight (Campbell et al., 2016). This would convert to 
approximately 1.04 mM tissue concentrations assuming the wet weight of tissue is 
approximately the same as H2O (1 g mL−1). In a different study when nude mice with 9L 
glioma xenografts were treated with 4 g kg−1 ascorbate IP (Chen et al., 2008), peak tumor 
concentrations of >30 mM ascorbate were reported. Given these previous results, all in vitro 
ascorbate doses utilized in the current report (0.5–20 mM) are well within the range of likely 
ascorbate concentrations achieved in tumor and normal tissues in vivo (Campbell et al., 
2016; Chen et al., 2008).
Ionizing Radiation—Ionizing radiation (IR) was delivered in the Iowa Radiation and Free 
Radical Research Core facility using a Pantak Therapx DXT 300 X-ray machine operated at 
200 kVp with added filtration of 0.35 mm Cu + 1.5 mm Al, resulting in a beam quality of 
0.95 mm Cu. For in vitro studies, cells were irradiated in 60 mm cell culture dishes. For in 
vivo murine xenograft studies, mice were anesthetized using an 87.5 mg kg−1 ketamine and 
12.5 mg kg−1 xylazine mixture and placed in lead boxes with only their right flank exposed.
Clonogenic Survival, Viability, and Metabolic Activity Assays—Cells (1–2 × 105) 
were plated in 60 mm cell culture dishes and grown in their respective media for 48 hr 
before exposed to experimental conditions. For radio-chemotherapy sensitization 
experiments, the cells were sequentially exposed to 1 h chemotherapy, 1 h pharmacological 
ascorbate, and then 2 Gy IR. For bovine catalase experiments, catalase was added 1 min 
prior to ascorbate exposure. For AdGPx1 experiments, cells were supplemented with 30 nM 
sodium selenite following transduction and throughout clonogenic growth. For iron 
chelation or iron addition experiments, chelators were added 3 hr prior to and during 
ascorbate exposure to ensure that labile metal ions were sufficiently bound. For experiments 
investigating the role of intracellular versus extracellular iron, chelators were either added 3 
h prior to ascorbate exposure and washed before ascorbate exposure, or media that was to be 
added later during ascorbate exposure was pre-chelated for 3 hr at 37 °C. For experiments

 testing the ability of AntA to sensitize NHAs to ascorbate, trypsinized NHAs were exposed 
in solution to 25 μM AntA in the presence or absence of 10 pmol cell−1 (2 mM) AscH− prior 
to flow cytometry or clonogenic cell survival analysis. For 2-DG experiments, 20 mM 2-DG 
was added only 15 min prior to ascorbate exposure to ensure minimal 2-DG-mediated effect 
of cellular redox potential. For the comparison of the toxicity of AscH− vs. DHA, DHA was 
dissolved in acetate buffer (pH 5) prior to exposure and equivalent acetate buffer was added 
to control cultures ([]final = 3.15 mM).
After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and clonogenic assay was completed in their 
respective media. Briefly, floating and attached cells were collected and total cells per plate 
were counted. An experimentally derived number of cells were plated into each well of a 6-
well cell culture plate in their respective media. For HEL92.1.7 suspension cells, cells were 
seeded in a top layer of 0.4% (w/v) agarose to allow for quantifiable colony formation. After 
sufficient time (7–12 days, cell type-dependent), cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained 
with a Brilliant Blue methanol solution. Cell colonies containing greater than 50 cells were 
counted and utilized to calculate plating efficiency for each treatment group. Normalized 
survival fractions were calculated by comparing plating efficiencies of each treatment group 
against the control group within a given experiment.
Trypan blue viability assay was performed immediately after 1 hr exposure to ascorbate on a 
Countess™ Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) as per the accompanying manufacturer’s 
protocol and normalized to control untreated cells.
Resazurin (a.k.a. Alamar Blue) was utilized to assess metabolic activity. Following 1 hr 
exposure to ascorbate, cells were washed, and stained in 6 μM resazurin for 1.5 h at 37 °C. 
Cells were then washed twice in PBS, trypsinize d, and spun at 1200 rpm × 5 min. Pellets 
were resuspended in PBS and 10,000 cells were assayed for the reduction of resazurin (non-
fluorescent) to resorufin (fluorescent) and analyzed on a LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD 
Biosciences; λex = 561 nm, λem = 582/15 nm).
Murine Xenograft Models—1 × 106 H292 or U87 cells were injected subcutaneously 
into the right rear flank. Once tumors were established, treatment was initiated with daily 
ascorbate (4 g kg−1 or equivalent dose of NaCl, IP), weekly carboplatin (5 mg kg−1 for 
H292) or temozolomide (2.5 mg kg−1 for U87), and/or IR (12 Gy/2 frx). Ascorbate/NaCl 
and chemotherapy was continued for the full extent of the study. Tumors were measured 
every other day with Vernier calipers (volume = (length × width × (width/2)) and mice were 
euthanized and sacrificed when tumor length exceeded 1.5 cm in any dimension.
Ascorbate Quantification—Tumor xenografts were excised and flash frozen in liquid 
nitrogen until analysis. Cell culture lysates were collected, and immediately assayed for 
ascorbate concentration. Mouse whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and plasma 
was collected after the sample was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min and frozen until analysis. 
For patient samples, whole blood was collected from clinical trial patients (NaHeparin 75 
USP units, BD Vacutainer® green top blood collection tube, 4 mL), and plasma was 
collected after centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min and aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until 
analysis.

 Total ascorbate in cell culture lysates, mouse samples, and GBM subjects was quantified as 
previously described (Vislisel et al., 2007; Welsh et al., 2013). Briefly, samples were 
extracted in a buffer containing 90% methanol and 10% water with 250 μM DETAPAC 
(90:10, v/v), mixed, and incubated on ice for 10 min to precipitate protein. The samples 
were clarified by centrifugation (16 g, 10 min) with an Eppendorf model 5415D Microfuge. 
Specifically, samples were diluted at a ratio of 50 μL of plasma to 450 μL extraction buffer. 
These samples were then further diluted another 77.5 to 105-fold (therefore, 775 to 1,050 
fold overall) in a buffer containing 72% methanol and 28% water with 250 μM DETAPAC 
(72:28, v/v). L-ascorbic acid standards were prepared in 72% methanol and 28% water with 
250 μM DETAPAC (72:28, v/v) with stock solution concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 50 
μM. This protocol ensured that all samples had identical methanol content which is critical 
for accurate quantification (Vislisel et al., 2007).
Aliquots (100 μL) of the samples or standards were placed in 96-well optical bottom black 
plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA). The assay was initiated at room 
temperature by adding 100 μL of 2.3 mM 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl 
(Tempol) in 2 M sodium acetate trihydrate buffer previously adjusted to pH 5.5 with acetic 
acid. The samples were then incubated for 10 min in the dark, allowing for Tempol-mediated 
oxidation of ascorbate to dehydroascorbate (DHA). Subsequently, 42 μL of 5.5 mM ortho-
phenylenediamine (oPDA) in 2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) was added to the samples. 
Kinetic measurements were immediately initiated and collected every 22 s using a TECAN 
SpectraFluor Plus plate reader (Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) for the fluorescent 
condensation product of the reaction of oPDA with DHA (3-(dihydroxyethyl)furo[3,4-
b]quinoxaline-1-one; λex = 345 nm, λem = 425 nm). Plasma ascorbate concentrations were 
determined against the linear portions of the standard curve and corrected for previous 
dilutions.
Total ascorbate in NSCLC subject’s plasma was quantified as previously described (Witmer 
et al., 2016). Briefly, plasma samples were measured spectrophotometrically (265 nm; ε = 
13,000 M−1 cm−1) using an Implen Nanophotometer P-330 with a 250x dilution lid, path 
length = 4.00 × 10−3 cm. The blank for each sample was a pair- ‘pre-infusion’ plasma 
sample, which allowed removal of the background absorbance of plasma proteins and other 
constituents.
CSF Ascorbatel Radical Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)—CSF was 
collected from nude athymic female mice that had received daily IP injections of ascorbate 
(4 g kg−1) for two weeks as previously described (Liu and Duff, 2008). Briefly, mice were 
anesthetized (17.5 mg ml−1 ketamine/2.5 mg ml−1 xylazine mixture), restrained in a 
stereotaxic frame with an acute head angle, and the dura mater covering the foramen 
magnum was surgically exposed. CSF was collected by capillary action following minimal 
puncture of the dura mater and frozen until EPR analysis. Ascorbate radical EPR spectra 
were obtained by placing the capillary tube into the bottom of a 250 mm × 3 mm (ID) thin 
walled quartz EPR tube (707-SQ-250M Wilmad-Lab Glass, Vineland, NJ) centered in a 
Bruker HS EPR cavity (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Spectra of the ascorbate radical (g = 2.0052) 
were acquired by a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer at room temperature while using a 
microwave power of 3.2 mW; frequency, 9.858 GHz; scanning 10 G with a sweep time of

 20.972 s; receiver gain, 5.02 × 104; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 
0.70 G; signal channel time constant, 327.680 ms. Spectra were collected in the additive 
mode using 5 scans.
Adenovirus Transduction—Replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors, Ad-empty 
(AdE), 25 MOI AdCMV catalase (AdCat), 25 MOI AdCMV glutathione peroxidase 1 
(AdGPx1), 50 MOI AdCMV SOD1 (AdSOD1), and 50 MOI AdCMV SOD2 (AdSOD2) 
vectors are previously described (Zwacka et al., 1998; Ahmad et al., 2005, 2008). 20 MOI 
AdFerritin heavy and light chain (AdFtH and AdFtL, respectively) were generated by 
ViraQuest (North Liberty, IA) using commercially available iron regulatory element (IRE)-
lacking vectors (OriGene). All transductions were performed in serum-free DMEM for 8–12 
hr once cells reached 50–70% confluency. Cells were washed and grown in full media for an 
additional 36 hours before experiments were conducted. All transductions were confirmed 
by activity assay and/or western blot for each individual experiment.
Radiolabeled 14C-EDTA Uptake—H292 NSCLC cells were exposed to 1 mM ‘cold’ 
EDTA spiked with 5 × 105 predicted disintegrations per minute (DPM) 14C-EDTA, which 
had a negligible effect on overall EDTA concentration, for 3 hr. To control for any effects of 
salt composition on radioactivity quantification, all sample vials contained 15 mL liquid 
scintillation cocktail + 5 mL of media, PBS, or trypsin. All samples were divided into 
‘media,’ ‘wash,’, or ‘cells’ vials. The ‘media’ vial contained 4 mL spiked media + 1 mL 
PBS wash. The ‘wash’ vial contained 5 × 1 mL wash. The ‘cells’ vials contained 1 mL 
tyrpsin + H292 cells + 4 × 1 mL PBS washes. For the standard curve, all standards were 
added to 5 mL PBS + 15 mL liquid scintillation cocktail. All radioactive counts were 
collected on a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman #L2100) and fraction of EDTA in 
samples were calculated after subtraction of background counts:
Human Tissue Sample Collection and Inclusion Metrics—Tumor and adjacent 
normal was collected from patients with suspected or confirmed NSCLC patients through 
the IRB-approved University of Iowa Tissue Procurement Core and was frozen in Tissue-
Tek® O.C.T. Compound. A board certified pathologist from the University of Iowa Hospital 
and Clinics histologically confirmed the NSCLC diagnosis. Samples were utilized for 
further studies if histology revealed >75% tumor or normal tissue, respectively, in adjacent 
tissue slices both before and after the samples were collected.
Tissue DHE Staining and Quantification—From OCT-frozen patient tissue, 10 μm 
sections of both tumor and adjacent normal tissue were cut and placed on the same slide to 
control. Tissue sections were stained with 10 μM DHE for 30 min in PBS + 5 mM sodium 
pyruvate prior to analysis by confocal microscopy (Olympus FLUOVIEW FV1000). For 
treatment groups, tissue sections were pretreated for 30 min with 0.25 μM GC4419 SOD 
mimetic or, alternatively, as a positive control, tissue sections were co-treated with 10 μM 
antimycin A (AntA) during the last 15 min of DHE staining. Each image obtained was

 quantified by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of at least 200 cell nuclei (ImageJ), 
and normalized to nuclei from untreated normal tissue cell nuclei.
To test the specificity of GC4419, any reaction with H2O2 was tested spectrophotometrically 
(240 nm; ε = 39.4 M−1 cm−1) by measuring the disappearance of H2O2 in the presence of 
0.25 μM GC4419 or 15 mkU mL−1 bovine catalase in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).
Tissue Iron Quantification—Labile iron in patient NSCLC and adjacent normal tissue 
was quantified as previously described (Moser et al., 2014). Wherever possible, metal 
instrumentation was avoided to prevent contamination from adventitious labile iron. Briefly, 
tissue sections were homogenized in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube by plastic pestle in 350 μL 
PBS (pH 6.5) that was previously treated with Chelex® 100 beads to remove any 
adventitious labile iron. To this homogenate, 2 mM DFO (final concentration) was added 
and samples were incubated on ice for 1 hr and frozen at −80 °C unti l analysis. For analysis, 
samples were placed in 4 mm O.D. EPR tubes (Wilmad-LabGlass, Vineland, NJ, 707-
SQ-250M) and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then analyzed for 
labile iron by using EPR (Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer), monitoring for the high spin 
ferrioxamine (Fe3+-DFO) signal at g = 4.3 at 100 K (Bruker ER4111VT variable 
temperature accessory) with the following EPR instrument parameters: center field 1575 G, 
sweep width 500 G, typical microwave frequency 9.766 GHz, power 20 mW, receiver gain 2 
× 105, modulation frequency 100 kHz, modulation amplitude 2 G, time constant 163.84 ms, 
conversion time 20.48 ms, resolution 1024 points, and with 5 additive scans. All samples 
were analyzed three times, repositioning the sample in the cavity before initiating each 
additional scan. The mean signal intensity was quantified and the labile iron content was 
calculated using a standard curve (0 – 15 μM FAS with 1 mM DFO) and normalized to total 
tissue protein by the Pierce™ BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), which is not 
susceptible to interference from residual OCT as opposed to the Lowry method (data not 
shown). Furthermore, equimolar DFO was added into the standard curve to control for any 
potential interference of DFO in the assay system (data not shown).
CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Deletion of SOD2—The CRISPR/Cas9 system was utilized to 
delete mitochondrial SOD2 from A549 and HEL 92.1.7 cells as previously described in 
HEK293T cells (Cramer-Morales et al., 2015). Briefly, cells were electroporated (200 V, 30 
μF) with the custom synthesized pD130-GFP expression vector containing expression 
cassettes for green fluorescent protein (GFP), Cas9 endonuclease, and a CRISPR chimeric 
cDNA with a gRNA moiety designed to target SOD2 (DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, CA). Cells that 
transiently expressed GFP were sorted by flow cytometry and cloned. Deletion of SOD2 was 
confirmed by western blot and activity assays (Figure S5).
SOD Activity Assay—MnSOD activity was measured in cell lysates as previously 
described (Spitz and Oberley, 2001). Briefly, dry cell pellets were homogenized in 50 mM 
phosphate buffer with 1.34 mM DETAPAC. To measure MnSOD activity only, the sample is 
incubated with 5 mM NaCN− for 30 min to inhibit CuZnSOD activity. To measure the 
MnSOD activity, the rate of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction was measured during the 
reaction of 100 μL of increasing amounts of total sample protein (0 – 500 mg), 100 μL of 
10−2 U mL−1 xanthine oxidase, and 800 μL of 50 mM phosphate buffer (1 mM DETAPAC,

 0.13 mg mL−1 BSA, 1.0 U mL−1 catalase, 5.6 × 10−5 M NBT, 1 × 10−4 M xanthine, 5 mM 
NaCN−, 50 μM bathocuproine disulfonic acid) at 560 nm for 2 min. One unit of SOD 
activity is measured as the amount of protein necessary to reach 50% of maximum inhibition 
of NBT reduction.
To account for incomplete CN−- mediated inhibition of CuZnSOD activity, MnSOD and 
CuZnSOD activity was more specifically differentiated by a SOD activity gel as adapted 
from techniques previously described (Ornstein, 1964). Briefly, a 12% polyacrylamide gel 
was made and pre-electrophoresed for 1 hr at 40 A (188 mM Tris-base, 1.3 mM EDTA, pH 
8.8). The following day, a 5% polyacrylamide stacking gel with 0.004% riboflavin-5′-
phosphate with a 1.5 mm comb was solidified under a fluorescent light for 15 – 30 min. 100 
μg total protein was electrophoresed for approximately 3 hr at 40 A (50 mM Tris base, 300 
mM glycine, 2.3 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) while the gel electrophoresis box was placed in a ice 
bath to maintain protein activity. The gels were then soaked in the staining solution (2.43 
mM NBT, 28 mM TEMED, 2.8 × 10−5 M riboflavin-5′-phosphate in ddH2O) for 20 min at 
room temperature in the dark. The gels were then rinsed, placed in 50 mM phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.8) and exposed to fluorescent light to initiate superoxide production. Achromatic 
bands indicate the presence of SOD activity. Once developed, the gels were further 
developed at room temperature overnight and imaged.
Cellular Labile Iron Pool Quantification—The labile iron pool (LIP) was visualized 
using the fluorescent dye Calcein-AM as previously described with modifications (Epsztejn 
et al., 1997). Briefly, after sample treatment, cells were trypsinized, spun at 1,200 rpm for 5 
min, and resuspended at approximately 1 × 106 cells mL−1 in 500 nM Calcein-AM in PBS. 
Samples were incubated for 15 min at 4% O2 in a humidity controlled environment (37 °C, 
5% CO 2). Subsequently, samples were pelleted, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 1 mL 
PBS before dividing each sample into two flow cytometry sample tubes, to which 100 μM 
2′,2′-bipyridyl (BIP) was added to one tube. Samples were kept at room temperature and 
10,000 cells were analyzed on a LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences; λex = 488 nm, 
λem = 515/20 nm). BIP tubes were incubated for at least 15 minutes before analysis to allow 
for full chelation of intracellular labile iron. The LIP (A.U.) = MFIBIP – MFINoBIP was 
normalized against the control samples to calculate the relative labile iron pool.
To determine any interaction with ascorbate, BIP-mediated change in calcein fluorescence 
(100 nM Calcein; 20 nM FAS) was measured in Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50B 
(Perkin Elmer) in the presence or absence of 5 mM ascorbate after incubation at 37 °C for 
20, 40, or 60 min.
Western Blots—Exponentially growing cells were washed with PBS before the addition 
of lysis buffer (Cell Signaling), incubated on ice for 5 minutes, and scraped. The lysate was 
collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The protein concentrations were 
determined on the cleared lysate using the Bio-Rad DC Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA. Total protein (25μg) was electrophoresed on a 4–20% gradient 
gel (Bio-Rad) at 80 V for approximately 1 h. The separated proteins were transferred onto 
PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, CA) and non-specific binding was blocked using 5% 
nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween (0.2%) for 1 hr at room temperature. The membranes were

1:10,000, both antibodies from Abcam, Cambridge, MA, Transferrin receptor, 1:1000, 
Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) at 4° C overnight. Actin served as a loading control (1:4,000; 
Sigma-Aldrich). Following 3 × 5 min PBS-Tween washes, the membranes were blotted with 
secondary antibodies (1:25,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) that were conjugated with 
horseradish peroxidase for 1 hour. The washed membranes were incubated with Super 
Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 
exposed to CareStream BioMax MR Film (CareStream Health, Rochester, NY). 
Quantification of western blots were performed in ImageJ.
Transferrin Receptor siRNA—For siRNA-mediated knockdown of TfR, we utilized a 
commercially available pre-validated siRNA construct (s727, Silencer® Select; Ambion, 
Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific) as well as a scrambled siRNA transfection 
control (Silencer® Select Negative Control No. 1). Cells were plated and allowed to grow 
36–48 hr until they reached 30–40% confluence. siRNA (25 pmol per dish) and 
Lipofectamine® 2000 (10 μL per dish) were prepared as instructed in OptiMEM transfection 
media (Gibco). A master mix of siRNA (25 pmol per dish) and lipofectamine (10 μL per 
dish) were individual diluted in 500 μL OptiMEM per dish and allowed to incubate for 5 
min at room temperature. These solutions were then combined, mixed gently, and allowed to 
incubate for an additional 20 min before adding 1 mL of the solution to each washed cell 
culture dish. The cells were exposed to the transfection medium for 8 – 12 hr, washed, and 
grown in full media until 80 – 90% confluence (~36 h). Further experiments were conducted 
as described above. Because TfR mRNA is mostly regulated post-transcriptionally, and our 
endpoint was knockdown of TfR, knockdown in each experiment was confirmed by western 
blot of immune-reactive TfR protein (representative image: Fig. 4M)
Aconitase Activity—Exponentially growing cells were scraped and frozen as dry pellets 
until assayed for total aconitase activity adapted from as previously described (Case et al., 
2011). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 with 0.6 mM 
MnCl2 and 5 mM Na-citrate and sonicated 3 × 10 s each. Protein was quantified by the 
Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951). Aconitase activity was measured as the rate of 
appearance of NADPH (at 340 nm; Beckman DU 800 spectrophotometer, Brea, CA) for 45 
min during the reaction of 200 μg total sample protein with 200 μM NADP+ and 10 U 
isocitrate dehydrogenase.
ETC Complex Activity—Exponentially growing cells were scraped and frozen as dry 
pellets until assayed for protein content (Lowry) and maximal ETC complex activity as 
previously described (Birch-Machin et al., 1994). Briefly, dry cell pellets were resuspended 
in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer and sonicated 3 × 10 s each. Rates of activities were 
normalized to total protein. Complex I activity was quantified as the rate of rotenone-
inhibitable NADH oxidation (320 nm; ε = 6.22 mM−1 cm−1). Samples were assayed in the 
presence or absence of 200 μg mL−1 rotenone in 25 mM potassium phosphate working 
buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM KCN, 2.5 mg mL−1 BSA, 0.13 mM NADH, 200 μg mL−1 
antimycin A, 7.5 mM coenzyme Q1). Complex II activity was measured in the presence and 
absence of 0.2 M succinate in 25 mM potassium phosphate working buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 2

 mM KCN, 2.5 mg mL−1 BSA for 10 minutes at 30 C. After incubation, 200 μg mL−1 
antimycin A, 200 μg mL−1 rotenone, 5 mM 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP), and 7.5 mM 
coenzyme Q1 were added to each cuvette and incubated for 1 min before quantifying 
Complex II activity as the difference in the rate of DCIP reduction in the presence and 
absence of succinate (at 600 nm; ε = 19.1 mM−1 cm−1). Complex IV activity was assayed as 
the rate of oxidation of cytochrome c (500 nm; ε = 19.6 mM−1 cm−1). Whole cell lysates 
were assayed in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (0.5 mM n-dodecyl β-maltoside, 1.5 
mM reduced cytochrome c).
Quantification of Intracellular H2O2 with PeroxyOrange-1—To visualize 
intracellular H2O2 levels, the selectively sensitive fluorescent probe PeroxyOrange-1 was 
utilized as previously described with modifications (Dickinson et al., 2010). 1 × 105 cells 
were plated and grown in their respective media for 48 hr. The complete protocol was 
conducted in the dark with minimal ambient lighting. Cells were washed with PBS and 
incubated with 10 uM PO-1 in phenol red free RPMI supplemented with HBE growth 
supplements for 1 hr at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS and placed back in phenol red 
free RPMI supplemented with HBE growth supplements. At this time, treatment with 15 
pmol cell−1 ascorbate or 100 μM H2O2 (every 30 min) was initiated and cells were placed 
back at 37 °C. At times indicated, cells were placed on ice for the remainder of the protocol, 
washed, and trypsinized with phenol red free 0.5% trypsin. After 15 min, cells still attached 
were scraped and all cells were collected in 15 mL conical vials containing PBS + 10% FBS 
to neutralize the trypsin reaction. Cells were spun at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, 
resuspended in 300–500 uL PBS and 10,000 cells were analyzed on a LSR II Flow 
Cytometer (BD Biosciences) with λex=561nm, λem=585/20nm. The mean fluorescence 
intensity (MFI) was analyzed (FlowJo™) and corrected for autofluorescence against 
unlabeled cells. Normalized MFI was calculated by comparing MFI for a given treatment 
group against control.
To determine any interaction with ascorbate PO-1 fluorescence (10 μM PO-1, 100 μM 
H2O2) was measured in Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50B (Perkin Elmer) in the presence 
or absence of 1 mM ascorbate.
Phase I Clinical Trial of Pharmacological Ascorbate in Combination with 
Chemoradiation in GBM—A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted at the University of 
Hospitals and Clinics to evaluate the safety of combining pharmacological ascorbate with 
standard radiation and temozolomide in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Approval was sought, 
and obtained, from the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (Biomedical IRB-01; 
IRB 201211713). This phase 1 study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01752491) 
prior to enrollment of the first subject. Newly diagnosed GBM patients referred for standard 
therapy (Stupp et al., 2005b) were invited to participate. Post-consent screening procedures 
included evaluating for glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase deficiency as well as 
osmolarity tolerance by challenging the consented subjects with a 15 g ascorbate infusion.
The study was broken into two phases: radiation phase and adjuvant phase. Radiation phase 
was defined as the time period from day 1 of radiation through adjuvant cycle 1, day 1. 
Doses of pharmacologic ascorbate were escalated utilizing Storer’s phase I clinical trial

 design BD (Storer, 1989). Cohorts were defined as 15 g, 25 g, 50 g, 62.5 g, 75 g, 87.5 g, 100 
g, and 125 g. Pharmacologic ascorbate was combined with sterile water for a targeted 
osmolarity of 500–900 mOsm L−1. Ascorbate infusions were three times weekly, with 
maximum infusion rate of 500 mL hr−1. Radiation (61.2 Gy in 34 fractions) and 
temozolomide (75 mg m−2 daily for a maximum of 49 days) similar to the treatment 
paradigm put forth by Stupp et al. (Stupp et al., 2005b) (Figure 7A). After completing 
radiation, ascorbate infusions were reduced to twice weekly; dose remained unchanged from 
the radiation phase.
Adjuvant phase was defined as the time period from cycle 1 day 1 through cycle 6 day 28. 
During this phase, subjects underwent intrapatient escalation utilizing Simon’s Accelerated 
Titration Design (Simon et al., 1997). Prescribed doses utilized the same cohorts as the 
radiation phase. Subjects were dose-escalated after 2 infusions until a plasma level of 20 
mM was achieved. Ascorbate infusions were performed twice weekly. Temozolomide was 
prescribed consistent with the Stupp regimen: 150 mg m−2 for days 1 through 5 of a 28 day 
cycle. A one-time dose escalation was allowed to 200 mg m−2 if cycle 1 was tolerated 
(Figure 7A). Subjects were evaluated for disease progression every 2 cycles utilizing the 
MacDonald criteria (Macdonald et al., 1990).
On a given day, during the radiation phase, GBM subjects received ascorbate infusions of 30 
– 180 min in duration (depending on the total dose) followed by radiation therapy. The dose 
escalation aspect of the study and the maximum infusion rate of ascorbate at 50 g hr−1 
required this range of infusion times. The protocol did not specify when the radiation was to 
be administered relative to the infusion time, so for higher ascorbate doses, requiring longer 
infusion times (> 50 g), the subject received radiation therapy during the last hour of 
ascorbate infusion or immediately following infusion. Temozolomide chemotherapy was 
administered orally in the evening by the patient at home and the time between ascorbate 
infusion and temozolomide administration was not defined. This timing of ascorbate and 
temozolomide was continued throughout the adjuvant phase.
MGMT status was determined by a PCR-based analysis at ARUP National Reference 
Laboratory (Salt Lake City, UT). IDH subject status was determined 
immunohistochemically by the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics Clinical 
Histopathology Laboratory.
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the study included grade 4 infection, grade 3 nausea or 
vomiting despite maximum supportive care, grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, and 
serious adverse events (SAE) with causality to the investigational agent. In addition to DLT, 
criteria for removal included progressive disease, patient’s refusal to continue treatment, and 
extraordinary medical circumstances (e.g., the constraints of the protocol are considered 
detrimental to patient health).
All subjects agreed to, and participate in, lifelong follow-up for this study. Subject numbers 
are for convenience and are not representative of case ID numbers. Subjects 12 and 13 
(Table S2) are included in the toxicity analysis (Tables S3, S4), but were not included in the 
progression free survival and overall survival analysis (Figure 7A, 7C, 7D) because they

 received limited protocol-dictated therapy due to unrelated co-morbidities. Due to the small 
number of subjects in the longevity analysis we reported the average progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Phase II Clinical Trial of Pharmacological Ascorbate in Combination with 
Chemotherapy as a first line treatment in advanced stage NSCLC—This phase II 
clinical trial is being conducted at the University of Hospitals and Clinics to evaluate the 
efficacy of combining carboplatin and paclitaxel with pharmacological ascorbate in 
advanced stage (stage IIIB and IV) NSCLC patients. Approval was sought, and obtained, 
from the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (Biomedical IRB-01; IRB 
201412760). This phase II clinical trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 
02420314) prior to enrollment of the first subject. Newly diagnosed advanced stage NSCLC 
patients were invited to participate. Post-consent screening procedures included evaluating 
for glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase deficiency as well as osmolarity tolerance by 
challenging the consented subjects with a 15 g ascorbate infusion.
The study included treating patients with 4 cycles of carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 
mg m−2 every 21 days as first line chemotherapy combined with pharmacological ascorbate. 
Ascorbate was administered intravenously twice per week at a fixed dose of 75 g per 
infusion for 6 treatments per each 21 days cycle of chemotherapy. Pharmacologic ascorbate 
was combined with sterile water for a targeted osmolarity of 500–900 mOsm/L. Blood 
ascorbate levels and measures of reactive oxygen species were collected each cycle from 
subjects immediately prior to and after completing ascorbate infusions. On a given therapy 
day, chemotherapy infusions (paclitaxel followed by carboplatin) were initiated ~1 h 
following the completion of the ascorbate infusions.
So far, no grade 3/4 toxicities attributed to ascorbate have occurred. The regimen is well 
tolerated and no patients have withdrawn consent due to toxicities. We have not seen any 
unexpected or unusual increase in Grade 3/4 toxicities as compared to previously published 
literature, although it remains too early for a direct comparison. Responses to therapy were 
determined per RECIST 1.1 criteria (Eisenhauer et al., 2009). Currently, a total of fourteen 
subjects are currently evaluable for response. Four of fourteen subjects have completed the 
trial with imaging-confirmed partial responses to therapy. Nine additional subjects 
demonstrated stable disease. Finally, one subject has progressed with the appearance of new 
lesions, although the target lesions are stable. All subjects agreed to, and participate in, 
lifelong follow-up for this study.
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
For all analyses, significance was determined at p < 0.05. *, **, or *** represent 
significance between exposure conditions. All analyses, unless specified elsewhere, were 
performed in GraphPad Prism® (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Ascorbate toxicity curves 
(Figure 1A, B) were generated using IGOR Pro version 6.36 (WaveMetrics, Inc.).
Where appropriate, figure legends define n and the definition of center and dispersion and 
precision measures. For analyses limited to two groups, Student’s t-test was utilized. To 
study differences between three or more groups, one-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey’s

 post hoc test was used. For all survival curves, the log-rank Mantel-Cox test was used. For 
NSCLC LIP curves (Figure 6A) and GBM/NHA toxicity curves (Figure S1D) non-linear 
regression curves were compared by the extra sum-of-squares F test. For GBM and NSCLC-
Ft LIP curves (Figure 6B, K) deviation from non-zero slope was determined from linear 
regression analyses. Box and whisker blot of patient plasma ascorbate concentrations 
(Figure 7B) are determined by the Tukey method The line and box represent the median 
value ± 25th and 75th percentiles or the interquartile range (IQR). Whiskers represent 1.5 
times IQR. Any data points outside 1.5 times IQR are represented by individual dots.
Data are expressed as mean ± 1 S.E.M., unless otherwise specified. For each experiment, 
unless otherwise noted, n represents the number of individual biological replicates. For each 
biological replicate, n ≥ 3 technical replicates for all in vitro and ex vivo studies.
For GBM subject survival analyses, Subjects 12 and 13 (Table S2) are included in the 
toxicity analysis (Tables S3, S4), but were not included in the progression free survival and 
overall survival analysis (Figures 7A, 7C, 7D) because they received limited protocol-
dictated therapy due to unrelated co-morbidities.

 Significance
Despite advances in treatment strategies, 5-year overall survival in NSCLC and GBM has 
not significantly increased over the last 20 years. Here, we demonstrate that 
pharmacological ascorbate represents an easily implementable and non-toxic agent that 
may increase treatment efficacy when combined with standard-of-care radio-
chemotherapy in NSCLC and GBM. Furthermore, the mechanism by which ascorbate is 
selectively toxic to cancer cells versus normal cells is shown to involve alterations in 
redox active iron metabolism mediated by mitochondrial O2•− and H2O2. As fundamental 
defects in oxidative metabolism leading to increased steady-state levels of O2•− and H2O2 
emerge as targetable hallmarks of cancer cells, the current findings support a generalized 
mechanism for the application of pharmacological ascorbate in cancer therapy.

 Figure 8. Proposed mechanism of pharmacological ascorbate cancer-cell selective toxicity
Dashed lines represent multi-step processes not illustrated in the model. Briefly, cancer cells 
demonstrate increased levels of redox-active labile iron due to increased steady-state levels 
of mitochondrial O2•− and H2O2, which are capable of disrupting cellular iron homeostasis. 
Oxidation of ascorbate produces H2O2 that reacts with the increased LIP in cancer cells to 
mediate Fenton chemistry and cause oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules (i.e., 
DNA, protein, lipids). Due to the diffusion-limited kinetics of HO• species, redox-active iron 
chelated by these macromolecules most likely represent the most prevalent site of damage. 
Furthermore, H2O2 produced from ascorbate oxidation selectively increases the cancer cell 
LIP, partially by disrupting Fe-S clusters, further exacerbating the differences in LIP 
available for oxidation reactions and mediate ascorbate toxicity in cancer vs. normal cells. In 
this model, endogenous ascorbate recycling mechanisms are driven by reducing equivalents 
from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and Glutathione (GSH) and/or
