Polonium-210 poisoning: a fi
 rst-hand account
Amit C Nathwani, James F Down, John Goldstone, James Yassin, Paul I Dargan, Andres Virchis, Nick Gent, David Lloyd, John D Harrison
Summary
Background Polonium-210 (²¹⁰Po) gained widespread notoriety after the poisoning and subsequent death of 
Mr Alexander Litvinenko in London, UK, in 2006. Exposure to ²¹⁰Po resulted initially in a clinical course that was 
indistinguishable from infection or exposure to chemical toxins, such as thallium.
Methods A 43-year-old man presented to his local hospital with acute abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting, and 
was admitted to the hospital because of dehydration and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms. He was initially 
diagnosed with gastroenteritis and treated with antibiotics. Clostridium diffi
  cile toxin was subsequently detected in his 
stools, which is when he fi
 rst raised the possibility of being poisoned and revealed his background and former identity, 
having been admitted under a new identity with which he had been provided on being granted asylum in the UK. 
Within 6 days, the patient had developed thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which was initially thought to be drug 
induced. By 2 weeks, in addition to bone marrow failure, he had evidence of alopecia and mucositis. Thallium 
poisoning was suspected and investigated but ultimately dismissed because blood levels of thallium, although raised, 
were lower than toxic concentrations. The patient continued to deteriorate and within 3 weeks had developed multiple 
organ failure requiring ventilation, haemofi
 ltration, and cardiac support, associated with a drop in consciousness. On 
the 23rd day after he fi
 rst became ill, he suff
 ered a pulseless electrical activity cardiorespiratory arrest from which he 
could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead.
Findings Urine analysis using gamma-ray spectroscopy on day 22 showed a characteristic 803 keV photon emission, 
raising the possibility of ²¹⁰Po poisoning. Results of confi
 rmatory analysis that became available after the patient’s 
death established the presence of ²¹⁰Po at concentrations about 10⁹-times higher than normal background levels. 
Post-mortem tissue analyses showed autolysis and retention of ²¹⁰Po at lethal doses in several organs. On the basis 
of the measured amounts and tissue distribution of ²¹⁰Po, it was estimated that the patient had ingested several 
1000 million becquerels (a few GBq), probably as a soluble salt (eg, chloride), which delivered very high and fatal 
radiation doses over a period of a few days.
Interpretation Early symptoms of ²¹⁰Po poisoning are indistinguishable from those of a wide range of chemical 
toxins. Hence, the diagnosis can be delayed and even missed without a high degree of suspicion. Although body 
surface scanning with a standard Geiger counter was unable to detect the radiation emitted by ²¹⁰Po, an atypical 
clinical course prompted active consideration of poisoning with radioactive material, with the diagnosis ultimately 
being made with gamma-ray spectroscopy of a urine sample.

Introduction
Alexander Litvinenko (born Dec 4, 1962) was an offi
  cer of 
the Russian secret service who, in 2000, was granted 
asylum in the UK and is said by his widow to have begun 
working as a consultant for the British intelligence 
services. On Nov 1, 2006, Mr Litvinenko fell ill and was 
admitted to hospital. His illness was later attributed to 
poisoning with polonium-210 (²¹⁰Po), since substantial 
amounts of this highly toxic radionuclide were found in 
his body by the Health Protection Agency (now 
Public Health England). An inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s 
death was opened and adjourned in November, 2006, due 
to outstanding criminal proceedings. The inquest was 
subsequently resumed when it became clear that the two 
men suspected of his murder could not be extradited 
from Russia. The inquest was suspended in July, 2014, to 
allow a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 to 
take place. The inquiry’s public hearing commenced at 
the Royal Courts of Justice in London in January, 2015, 
and included review of the patient’s medical records, 
clinical course, spectroscopy results, and statements 
from experts. The hearing concluded on July 31, 2015, 
and the fi
 nal report into the death of Mr Litvinenko was 
published on Jan 21, 2016.
Following the public hearing, the primary clinicians 
and toxicology experts involved in the care of 
Mr Litvinenko in 2006 are now free of any restrictions to 
describe the clinical aspects of this highly unusual case. 
In this report, we provide a fi
 rst-hand account of the 
events leading to the diagnosis of ²¹⁰Po poisoning, as 
well as the detailed toxico-kinetics of the fi
 rst documented 
case of lethal poisoning with polonium.

diarrhoea, which had started on Nov 1, 2006 (designated as 
day 1 in the following chronology). On examination, he 
appeared dehydrated. He was afebrile and had a normal 
pulse and blood pressure. Abdominal examination 
revealed epigastric tenderness. In view of the profuse 
nature of his diarrhoea, a provisional diagnosis of 
gastroenteritis, possibly of infective origin, was made. He 
was admitted for further investigation and started on 
intravenous fl
 uids and oral ciprofl
 oxacin 500 mg every 
12 h. Investigations showed that serum urea and 
conjugated bilirubin concentrations were mildly raised at 
12·1 mmol per L and 49 μmol per L, respectively, and 
creatinine was high at 101 μmol per L, suggesting 
dehydration. Haemoglobin concentration was 201 g per L 
(reference range 120–180 g/L) associated with a leucocytosis 
(white blood cell count 22 × 10⁹ cells/L; reference range 
4·0–11·0 × 10⁹ cells/L) and neutrophilia (19·8 × 10⁹ cells/L; 
reference range 2·0–7·5 × 10⁹/L; table 1).
Clinical course
On day 7, Clostridium diffi
  cile toxin was identifi
 ed in the 
patient’s stools by the microbiology department at 
Barnet General Hospital. The possibility was raised that 
this fi
 nding might have been secondary to ciprofl
 oxacin. 
When the diagnosis was discussed with the patient, he 
revealed his previous identity and suggested the possibility 
of being poisoned. He disclosed that before coming to the 
UK he had been known as Alexander Litvinenko and that 
he had defected from the Russian Security Service. 
Mr Litvinenko explained that on the day he became ill, 
he had met with former Komitet gosudarstvennoy 
bezopasnosti (KGB) agents and feared that he had been 
poisoned (fi
 gure 1, table 1). The patient and his wife asked 
medical staff
  whether poisoning by infection with C diffi
  cile 
might have occurred since they had a friend who had been 
killed in this way. Mr Litvinenko was commenced on oral 
metronidazole (400 mg three times daily) but his 
gastrointestinal 
symptoms 
persisted. 
The 
working 
diagnosis was of C diffi
  cile diarrhoea associated with a 
possible underlying viral gastroenteritis. By day 9, 
Mr Litvinenko had become neutropenic with a neutrophil 
count 1·1 × 10⁹ per L (table 1). His platelet count had also 
fallen from normal levels to 63 × 10⁹ per L. The cause of the 
cytopenia was unknown but thought to be due to a viral 
gastroenteritis or a consequence of ciprofl
 oxacin toxicity.
On day 11, his neutrophil count was lower than 
0·5 × 10⁹ per L and he had spiked a fever. He was started 
empirically 
on 
intravenous 
piperacillin–tazobactam 
(4·5 g every 6 h) to avoid progression to a sepsis syndrome. 
He was also given one dose of pegylated G-CSF (Neulasta,

3
6 mg [Amgen, CA, USA]) to stimulate recovery of the 
neutrophil count. By day 13, he had developed alopecia 
and mucositis; together with progressive cytopenia, these 
signs gave him the appearance of someone who had been 
exposed to toxin, chemotherapy, or radiation. Once again 
the patient and his wife raised the concern that he might 
have been poisoned, stating that many of his symptoms 
were similar to those he had learned about during his 
training as an agent in the Federal Security Service of 
Russia (FSB). Reverse barrier nursing was started and on 
toxicological advice from the clinical toxicology unit at 
Guy’s & St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, 
samples were sent to this clinical toxicology unit for a 
heavy metal screen. A screen of the patient with a 
standard Geiger counter revealed only background values. 
On the evening of day 16, the results of the heavy metal 
screen showed a slightly increased urine thallium 
concentration (30 nmol/L; normal <10 nmol/L) but this 
level was below the toxic concentration (800–1000 nmol/L). 
A bone marrow trephine sample taken on day 15 was 
acellular (fi
 gure 2). He was therefore transferred on day 17 
to the haematology unit at University College London for 
specialist support and treatment of bone marrow failure. 
Samples were sent for human leucocyte antigen typing in 
case a bone marrow transplant was needed. The patient 
had told staff
  that the Russians used radioactive thallium 
as a poison. However, it was not thought likely that 
thallium poisoning was the cause of the patient’s 
deterioration, especially since he had no evidence of 
peripheral neuropathy, which is a key feature of thallium 
poisoning. However, in the absence of any other clear 
cause, we started treatment with oral Prussian blue (ferric 
ferrocyanide; 4 g, every 8 h) because of the mildly raised 
urine thallium concentration together with gastro-
intestinal symptoms and alopecia—two clinical features 
that are typically associated with thallium poisoning.
On day 18, he was jaundiced with normal alanine 
transaminase levels. Diarrhoea and abdominal pain were 
settling and his oral intake was improving, although he 
had haematemesis that evening. On day 19, the rapid 
assessment team was called because of concerns about 
heart rate irregularity: inverted T-waves were noted on the 
lateral leads of an electrocardiogram. Troponin T levels 
were normal. Nevertheless, he was transferred to the 
intensive care unit for further monitoring. To mitigate 
against further heart rhythm abnormalities, serum 
potassium was maintained at about 5·5 mmol per L. 
He remained pyrexial, despite antibiotics. Because of 
raised 
infl
 ammatory 
markers 
(C-reactive 
protein 
100 mg/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 130 mm/h) 
but no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
he was started on systemic antifungal therapy with 
Ambisone (Gilead, CA, USA). Repeat analyses of plasma 
and urine showed a normal thallium concentration

(<10 nmol/L). By this stage, his conjugated bilirubin level 
was high (230 μmol/L). During the following 2 days 
(days 20–22) his renal function deteriorated rapidly 
(table 1). An abdominal ultrasound scan showed that the 
liver, spleen, and kidneys were of normal size and 
appearance, with no evidence of obstruction.
The possibility of chemotherapeutic agents causing 
mucositis and bone marrow failure was considered but 
dismissed because covert administration at the doses 
necessary to cause rapid multi-organ failure would have 
been diffi
  cult. A search for a radiotoxin was pursued along 
several lines. Exposure of the patient’s blood smear on a 
glass slide to a radiograph fi
 lm on day 22 showed that the 
radiograph fi
 lm exposed to parts of the blood smear not 
covered by a glass coverslip developed opacity (fi
 gure 3), 
which is consistent with the presence of a radioactive 
substance in the blood. Later that day, gamma-ray 
spectrometry measurements on a urine sample from the 
patient showed a characteristic 803 keV photon emission, 
raising the possibility of polonium-210 (²¹⁰Po) poisoning. 
Further urine and blood samples were sent for 
confi
 rmatory spectrometric analysis. However, the 
patient’s condition deteriorated rapidly that day with the 
onset of a fl
 orid macular skin rash, abdominal distension, 
progressive metabolic acidosis, and oliguria. He became 
hypothermic (35·5°C) and progressed to cardiogenic 
shock with an associated acute drop in consciousness. 
This was followed rapidly by a pulseless electrical activity 
cardiorespiratory arrest. He was resuscitated successfully 
but was dependent on escalating doses of epinephrine, 
and had a further pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest 
2 h later. Echocardiography showed poorly contracting 
ventricles with no evidence of tamponade or valvular 
pathology. Oesophageal Doppler showed a stroke volume 
of 40 mL (normal stroke volume is 70 mL) despite high 
doses of epinephrine (2·0 μg/kg per min). For the next 
16 h the patient remained unstable and required inotropes, 
continuous 
veno-venous 
haemofi
 ltration, 
and 
full 
mechanical ventilation. On day 23, Mr Litvinenko suff
 ered 
a third pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and was 
pronounced dead. Results of the day 22 urine sample 
became available shortly after the patient’s death and 
showed the presence of 825 becquerel (Bq) per mL of 
²¹⁰Po, consistent with polonium poisoning.
Post-mortem results
A post-mortem examination was done by a consultant 
forensic pathologist on day 31 in the presence of a 
radiation protection offi
  cer. Precautions to avoid radiation 
exposure included the wearing of protective suits, gloves 
taped at the wrists, and large battery-operated plastic 
hoods into which fi
 ltered air was piped. Key gross 
macroscopic fi
 ndings were the presence of blood-tinged 
fi
 brinous pericarditis, a pleural eff
 usion associated with 
bilateral congestion of the lungs, gross ascites, and 
generalised tissue autolysis of most organs, although the 
brain looked normal. Because of continuing autolysis of 
tissues resulting from their ²¹⁰Po content, and the 
hazardous nature of the tissue samples, microscopy of 
the internal organs was not done and further analyses 
were limited to studies of the biodistribution of ²¹⁰Po

using gamma-ray spectrometry. The results were used to 
estimate total organ concentrations of ²¹⁰Po at the time of 
death. As table 2 shows, ²¹⁰Po was retained in all organs 
and tissues, with the highest activity in the liver 
(30 MBq/g) and kidney (49 MBq/g), consistent with 
published data on the biodistribution of ²¹⁰Po.2–4 The 
lower concentration of ²¹⁰Po in lung tissue (3·5 MBq/g) 
was consistent with intake by ingestion. On the 
assumption of ²¹⁰Po ingestion on day 1 with 10% being 
absorbed into the systemic circulation, the concentrations 
of ²¹⁰Po measured in the liver, kidneys, and urine were 
used to estimate intake as 4400 MBq (4·4 GBq)2,4
We estimated the cumulative radiation doses to the 
organs of a reference 70 kg adult man over 22 days 
following the ingestion of 4·4 GBq of ²¹⁰Po (table 3). 
Radiation doses causing lethal damage to body organs are 
generally quantifi
 ed in terms of the lethal dose of acute 
gamma radiation estimated to kill 50% of people exposed 
in this way (lethal dose 50 [LD50] values), with 
corresponding LD0–LD100 ranges. Doses necessary to 
cause prodromal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea 
are expressed as eff
 ective doses (however, it should be 
noted that LD and eff
 ective dose [ED] are toxicological 
terms and ED should not to be confused with the 
radiation protection quantity of eff
 ective dose). When 
estimating values for ²¹⁰Po, it was necessary to take 
account of the reduced eff
 ectiveness of protracted 
irradiation and the greater damage caused per Gy by 
alpha particles compared with gamma rays (ie, the relative 
biological eff
 ectiveness for alpha particles is >1). Taking 
account of dose protraction and assuming a relative 
biological eff
 ectiveness of 2, the ED0 and ED50 values for 
vomiting and diarrhoea were estimated to be about 
0·6–0·8 Gy and 7 Gy, respectively.4 Therefore, our 
estimated dose rate to all regions of the gut of about 
0·2 Gy per day for the fi
 rst few days after intake (table 3) 
does not seem to be suffi
  cient to cause the prodromal 
symptoms the patient experienced. However, the model 
might have underestimated gut doses, especially since 
data from animals suggest that a proportion of ingested 
²¹⁰Po is retained in the gastric and intestinal mucosa.4 
Alternatively, these symptoms might have been caused by 
or compounded by infection with C diffi
  cile or a 
cumulative radiation dose delivered by the radiotoxin in 
the gut lumen as well as that absorbed into the 
bloodstream. By contrast, the estimated dose to the red 
bone marrow was about 6 Gy after 1 week, rising to 17 Gy 
after 22 days. The estimated radiation doses to the liver 
and kidneys were also very high—about 5 Gy to the liver 
and 9 Gy to the kidneys per day over the fi
 rst few days and 
reaching 92 Gy and 140 Gy, respectively, after 22 days.
Discussion
Polonium-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive element 
that was discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie. It decays to 
stable lead-206 by emitting one alpha particle, with 
occasional excitation in the nucleus and emission of 
803 keV gamma rays. It has a half-life of 138 days and high 
specifi
 c activity, so that a very small mass corresponds to a 
high amount of radioactivity. Human beings are constantly 
exposed to ²¹⁰Po, which occurs at low concentrations in the 
environment as part of the uranium decay chain. However, 
annual intake from natural sources is about 10⁸ times less 
than the intake estimated in our patient at around 4 GBq.
Polonium is used in various industrial processes and as 
a power supply in small satellites, but its manufacture 
requires sophisticated equipment. It is, therefore, not 
widely available, but it is an eff
 ective poison. It forms 
water-soluble, colourless salts that are readily absorbed 
across 
biological 
membranes, 
becoming 
widely 
distributed in body organs and tissues where the alpha 
particles deliver a large amount of energy to surrounding 
cells, causing cell death and organ damage. Early 
symptoms of ²¹⁰Po poisoning are indistinguishable from 
those of a wide range of chemical toxins. Therefore, the 
diagnosis can be delayed and even missed without a high 
degree of suspicion. Furthermore, ²¹⁰Po can be transported 
easily and safely without detection because its high-energy 
alpha particles have a short range and can be blocked by 
quite a thin barrier, such as the skin, and the associated 
gamma-ray emissions are very low yield. Hence, the 
Geiger counter used in this case was unable to detect the 
radiation emitted by ²¹⁰Po. Alpha-particle spectroscopy is 
the best way to test for radiotoxins such as ²¹⁰Po that emit 
alpha particles. However, these devices are not readily 
available in most hospitals.
Reports of ²¹⁰Po poisoning in human beings are scarce; 
a Russian accident case involving inhalation of an aerosol 
of ²¹⁰Po at a dose of about 530 MBq ²¹⁰Po resulted in death 
in 13 days.4,5 However, the timecourse of rapid clinical 
deterioration observed in our patient, resulting in death 
within 23 days, is consistent with animal data for several 
mammalian species.4 Aside from the gastrointestinal tract, 
the bone marrow was one of the fi
 rst organ systems to be 
damaged. From an initial neutrophilia, a feature of acute

radiation injury,6 the neutrophil count fell rapidly over a 
2-week period. The LD50 for the bone marrow was 
estimated to be about 3 Gy, with an LD0–LD100 range of 
1–4 Gy. Our calculations indicate that the LD100 value for 
the red bone marrow was exceeded after 5 days (table 3), 
causing irreversible damage to the haemopoietic stem cell 
and stromal compartments.4 At substantially lower doses 
of ²¹⁰Po, transplanted progenitor cells might provide 
transient support but animal data suggest that death in 
such a setting can occur later, mainly as a consequence of 
radiation damage to the kidneys.7 Similarly, the estimated 
LD50 value for acute kidney damage was 6 Gy, with a 
corresponding value for liver failure of 8 Gy. Our estimates 
of the cumulative dose delivered to the kidney and liver 
were 44 and 28 Gy, respectively, at day 5. Hence, the wide 
distribution of ²¹⁰Po probably resulted in the delivery of 
lethal radiation doses to several organs early after intake.
Several chelating agents have been assessed in animal 
models of ²¹⁰Po poisoning to reduce organ retention and 
enhance 
excretion.8,9 Unithiol 
(sodium 
2,3-dimer-
captopropane-1-sulphonate) has been used in children 
accidentally exposed to ²¹⁰Po in the former Soviet Union10 
and has recently been given to two individuals thought to 
have been exposed at around the same time as 
Mr Litvinenko: both survived, but both had received 
much lower doses of ²¹⁰Po than our patient. Animal data 
suggest that chelation can reduce ²¹⁰Po retention in the 
blood, spleen, and bone, although this might be 
associated with increased retention in the kidneys and 
the brain. Typically, the amounts used in animal studies 
are higher than recommended for administration to 
human beings.
Conclusion
This case has raised our awareness of the possibility that 
radioactive materials can be used as poisons with 
catastrophic eff
 ect. Importantly, early symptoms of ²¹⁰Po 
poisoning were indistinguishable from those of a wide 
range of chemical toxins, including thallium, thus causing 
a delay in diagnosis. Additionally, body surface scanning 
with a standard Geiger counter was unable to detect the 
alpha radiation emitted by ²¹⁰Po. Nevertheless, an atypical 
clinical course, including mucositis, alopecia, and bone 
marrow failure, prompted active consideration of 
poisoning with radioactive material, with the diagnosis 
ultimately being made with gamma-ray spectroscopy of a 
urine sample. An earlier diagnosis in our patient would 
not have enabled him to survive because the high amount 
of ²¹⁰Po absorbed and distributed to body organs within 
hours of intake would have resulted in rapid cell death and 
multiple organ failure. Preparedness for such cases in the 
future would need a high degree of clinical suspicion and 
investment in sensitive detection instrumentation by 
hospitals. However, such cases would remain untreatable 
without research into eff
 ective antidotes that reduce levels 
and biodistribution of ²¹⁰Po, and limit the extent of organ 
damage. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of poisoning with 
radiotoxin is important to maximise the potential for 
eff
 ective treatment and enable appropriate precautions to 
be taken to protect hospital staff
