Misuse of "Power" and other mechanical terms in Sport and Exercise Science Research

Abstract 
3 
 
In spite of the Système International d’Unitès (SI) that was published in 1960, there 
4 
continues to be widespread misuse of the terms and nomenclature of mechanics in 
5 
descriptions of exercise performance. Misuse applies principally to failure to 
6 
distinguish between mass and weight, velocity and speed, and especially the terms 
7 
"work" and "power." These terms are incorrectly applied across the spectrum from 
8 
high-intensity short-duration to long-duration endurance exercise.  This review 
9 
identifies these misapplications and proposes solutions.  Solutions include adoption of 
10 
the term "intensity" in descriptions and categorisations of challenge imposed on an 
11 
individual as they perform exercise, followed by correct use of SI terms and units 
12 
appropriate to the specific kind of exercise performed.  Such adoption must occur by 
13 
authors and reviewers of sport and exercise research reports to satisfy the principles 
14 
and practices of science and for the field to advance.

INTRODUCTION 
18 
 
The French philosopher and Nobel Laureate André Gide (1869-1951) is reputed to 
19 
have begun talks he gave with the following extract from his 1950 publication 
20 
Autumn Leaves: 
21 
 
22 
 
Everything's already been said, but since nobody was listening, we 
23 
have to start again. 
24 
 
25 
 
Sport and exercise science is the scientific study of factors that influence the ability to 
26 
perform exercise (also known, according to circumstances, as physical activity) as 
27 
well as the resulting adaptations.  This study is directed principally at humans but it is 
28 
also applicable to equine, canine, avian, and other animal contexts.   Importantly, 
29 
terms and nomenclature used to describe exercise should abide by the Système 
30 
International d'Unités (SI) i.e. be simple, precise, and accurate. The SI system 
31 
 Page 2 of 27 
 
 
comprises seven base units, prefixes and derived units (Table 1).  This enables 
32 
scientists from different disciplines to communicate effectively (24) and germane here, 
33 
to advance sport and exercise science.  With Institutional ethics approval, the purpose 
34 
of this review is to highlight principally how "power", but also other SI mechanical 
35 
variables, are misused in many exercise science research reports and then indicate 
36 
correct use of terms and nomenclature that best describe and evaluate exercise 
37 
performance. The review will define exercise and then proceed to examine misuse of 
38 
mass and weight, work, velocity, power, and efficiency.  For all physical activities 
39 
Newton's Second Law will be demonstrated as the fundamental mechanical 
40 
relationship used to document the causes of performance.  A case will be made to 
41 
abandon the phrase "critical power" and adopt instead "critical intensity" for the 
42 
otherwise laudable concept of tolerance to exercise.  Finally, a recommendation will 
43 
be made to ensure that if sport and exercise science research is to be recognised as an 
44 
established and credible area of application of science and so advance, terms and 
45 
nomenclature to describe the performance of exercise must abide by principles of 
46 
mechanics laid down by Newton and in turn, use the SI.   
47 
 
48 
2. 
EXERCISE 
49 
 
For military, occupational, and within the last two hundred years or so, sport-, leisure-
50 
related, health and quality-of-life reasons, the need to quantify either total exercise 
51 
accomplished or the effectiveness with which exercise is performed has been a 
52 
principal focus.  This focus continues. 
53 
 
54 
 
The World Health Organisation defines exercise as: 
55 
 
56 
 Page 3 of 27 
 
 
 
A subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, 
57 
repetitive, and purposeful in the sense that the improvement or 
58 
maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is the 
59 
objective. (http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/pa/en/). 
60 
 
61 
 
Exercise can also be defined as: 
62 
 
63 
 A potential disruption to homeostasis by muscle activity that is 
64 
either exclusively or in combination, concentric, isometric or 
65 
eccentric.  
66 
(33). 
67 
 
 
68 
 
Only one of these definitions (33) acknowledges that either deliberately or out of 
69 
necessity, gross external movement is not always a primary outcome.  Where 
70 
accelerated movement does occur, the activities are dynamic.  Where it does not, the 
71 
activities are static.  Examples of the latter are the primarily isometric muscle actions 
72 
in balance, a yoga pose, or in gymnastics, strength poses such as the crucifix on rings. 
73 
 
74 
 
In some sports such as gymnastics, and weight-lifting, movement after completion of 
75 
dismount or lift is undesirable and is penalised by the judges or referees.  In others 
76 
such as archery and shooting, stillness is crucial for performance (34).  Even in 
77 
dynamic sports such as luge, skeleton bobsled and swimming, the ability to hold 
78 
streamlined positions of the body is decisive 
79 
(http://www.geomagic.com/en/community/case-studies/british-team-uses-geomagic-
80 
3d-reverse-engineering-to-streamline-/, 9).  Similarly, in sailing, the ability to 
81 
 Page 4 of 27 
 
 
maintain high-force, isometric muscle activity for prolonged durations is crucial.  In 
82 
scrums in Rugby Union, 16 players can be primarily exercising isometrically for 10 s 
83 
or so with maximal effort, yet minimal external movement occurs.  Even in dynamic 
84 
activities such as running and swimming, stabiliser and fixator muscles act either 
85 
actually or quasi isometrically.  Moreover, many activities of daily living require little 
86 
or no movement (e.g. maintenance of posture, supporting objects in domestic tasks, 
87 
screwing the tops on jars until tight and maintaining yoga poses). 
88 
 
89 
 
While the ability of muscle to exert force in a discrete task is important, the ability 
90 
repeatedly to exert force (i.e. sustain exercise in endurance activities), is equally 
91 
important.  Effective endurance performance requires an ability to delay the onset of 
92 
fatigue - taken here to be "any reduction in force-generating capacity (measured as 
93 
maximum voluntary muscle action), regardless of the task performed" (5). 
94 
 
95 
3. 
QUANTIFYING THE ABILITY TO PERFORM EXERCISE 
96 
 
Precise quantification of exercise is an integral part of research to improve our 
97 
knowledge and understanding of factors that influence the ability to perform exercise.  
98 
However, there is a key confounding factor that traps the unwary:  human and other 
99 
animal bodies are not simple, rigid systems.  They are complex, multi-segment 
100 
systems and muscular performance does not always result in movement. Even where 
101 
movement does occur and in spite of concerns expressed by many (1, 17, 18, 24, 27, 
102 
30, 33), exercise science researchers frequently misapply classical mechanics 
103 
presented by Newton in 1687 in his three-volume Philosophæ Naturalis Principia 
104 
Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy).  Misapplications are 
105 
most common for the mechanical variables “work”, “velocity”, “power” and 
106 
 Page 5 of 27 
 
 
“efficiency”.  These terms have strict definitions in Newtonian mechanics, the SI, and 
107 
exercise science (17, 24, 25), yet frequently, they are used incorrectly. The use of 
108 
incorrect, vague, and colloquial meanings of standardized mechanics terms creates 
109 
numerous problems for readers and the field of exercise science. For instance, 
110 
imagine a multi-disciplinary collaboration where a nutritionist, coach and sport 
111 
psychology consultant  want to use the same word “power” for different things when 
112 
working with an athlete. The nutritionist uses power to describe the rate of transfer of 
113 
chemical energy from food, the coach uses "quick power" and "long power" to 
114 
describe energy systems in sport and the psychologist uses power to describe the 
115 
mental energy/focus on the task at hand. How do these people communicate? How 
116 
does the athlete understand them or integrate their advice with the strength and 
117 
conditioning coach who talks about "power output" in sport?  The answer to these 
118 
questions is simple:  "With great difficulty and not according to the principles of 
119 
science". 
120 
 
121 
 
Abuses also include use of “workload” (18, 31, 33) and "work rate" (24).  Moreover, 
122 
the important and highly relevant impulse-momentum relationship that expresses 
123 
Newton’s second law is frequently overlooked.  In spite of the publication in 1960 of 
124 
the SI that was intended to standardise terms, units and nomenclature, there continue 
125 
to be misapplications, irregularities and transgressions in expression in exercise 
126 
science research`.  These include failures to distinguish between variables as basic as 
127 
mass and weight. 
128 
 
129 
4. 
MASS AND WEIGHT 
 
130 
 Page 6 of 27 
 
 
 
Mass is the amount of matter in a body.  The unit in which this amount is quantified 
131 
and expressed is the kilogram (kg).  Weight is the force that results from the action of 
132 
a gravitational field on a mass (24).  It is expressed in the eponymous unit, the newton, 
133 
named after Sir Isaac Newton.  The symbol is N.   
134 
 
135 
 
If body weight is reported, it should be expressed in newtons.  Yet, frequently in high-
136 
ranking journals, even those that have "science" in their title, published manuscripts 
137 
allow expression of body weight in kg.  Similarly, in friction-braked cycle ergometry, 
138 
external resistance is sometimes expressed in kg or as a percentage of body mass. In 
139 
both instances, this is simply incorrect, because since resistance is a force, it should be 
140 
expressed in N or as a percentage of body weight. Use of the term “resistance” in 
141 
strength and conditioning usually implies gravitational resistance, although elasticity 
142 
of tissues and structures could also be involved, so the direction (vertical) required of 
143 
a vector quantity like force is accounted for.  
144 
 
145 
5. 
MECHANICAL WORK AND POWER 
146 
 
For dynamic activities, mechanical work is what is done when: 
147 
 
148 
 
 A force moves its point of application such that some resolved part of 
149 
the displacement lies along the line of action of that force. 
150 
 (33).   
151 
 
 
152 
 
The unit in which work is expressed is eponymous, the joule, named after the 
153 
physicist and English brewer James Prescott Joule (1818-1889).  It is an SI 
154 
derived unit, has the symbol J and is defined as what is done when: 
155 
 Page 7 of 27 
 
 
 
156 
 A force of one newton moves through a distance of one metre. 
157 
 
158 
 
Work is usually calculated as N·m. 
159 
 
 
160 
 
 
Power is defined as:  
161 
 
162 
The rate of performing work.  
163 
(24).   
164 
 
165 
 
The unit is also eponymous: the watt, symbol W.  It is named after the Scottish 
166 
mechanical engineer James Watt (1736-1819).  It should be made correctly as a mean 
167 
value for some duration, although instantaneous power flows can be calculated. 
168 
However, power flows so calculated can vary widely and are strongly influenced by 
169 
the model and data used to calculate power (17).  If interpretation is to be meaningful, 
170 
selection of duration must be made with care. 
171 
 
172 
 
Similar to time (s), speed (m·s-1), and temperature (K), both work (J) and power (W) 
173 
are scalar quantities.  Scalars possess magnitude but not direction, as opposed to 
174 
vector quantities such as velocity, force and change of temperature that possess both.  
175 
The use of the term “power” in exercise science research reports should be used 
176 
correctly, so the context must satisfy its strict requirements and be appropriate to 
177 
documenting performance. For example, in cycle ergometry, exercise science research 
178 
reports should refer to the mean external power output.  This is because the ergometer 
179 
 Page 8 of 27 
 
 
does not measure the energy used to accelerate the performer’s limbs or the energy 
180 
wasted in impulses applied to the pedals in non-propulsive directions.  
181 
 
182 
 
In exercise, forces are exerted by skeletal muscles that create moments of force which 
183 
tend to rotate joints (23).  The function of skeletal and other types of muscle is to 
184 
exert force, and they do so by attempting to shorten.  If the attempt is successful, 
185 
concentric muscle activity occurs.  If the overall muscle-tendon unit remains the same 
186 
length, the activity is said to be isometric.  When muscle is lengthened while it is 
187 
exerting force, the action is called eccentric.  Swammerdam's experiment some 300 
188 
years ago, cited in Needham (22), demonstrated clearly that when active, muscle does 
189 
not decrease in volume.  Hence, and as Rodgers and Cavanagh (24) indicated, the 
190 
expression "muscle contraction" is simply wrong and at best inexact; it is not 
191 
scientific. Cavanagh (6) therefore advocated that the phrase “muscle action” is the 
192 
most accurate term for use in exercise science. 
193 
 
194 
 
For muscle to exert force, chemical energy is required.  Principally, this is supplied 
195 
from forms of carbohydrate, fat, and protein but metabolism and accompanying 
196 
biochemical reactions release the energy that allows muscle to function.  The currency 
197 
of this energy is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and related high-energy phosphagens.  
198 
The challenge during exercise is to meet required energy demands and so synthesise 
199 
and re-synthesise ATP. 
200 
 
201 
 
Against this brief background, consideration can now be given to correct the  
202 
erroneous use of  scalar and vector mechanical variables  to describe exercise 
203 
performance. 
204 
 Page 9 of 27 
 
 
 
205 
6. 
SIMPLE MEASURES 
206 
 
The simplest forms in which exercise can be quantified are distance (m) and time (s) 
207 
required for movement.  In running events, overall performance is often accurately 
208 
described by time.  These types of event could also be investigated by converting this 
209 
time and distance information into the scalar quantity speed. Speed though, is not 
210 
synonymous with velocity. In a 10,000 m race on a 400-m track the mean velocity is 
211 
zero since athletes finish where they started.  The same applies in swimming in 50-m 
212 
pools for events such as 100 m, 200 m and 1500 m.  
213 
 
214 
 
If performance is to be expressed as work, there must be some measureable and 
215 
meaningful quantification of joules produced.  For example, this cannot occur in 
216 
isometric muscle activity where no notable body movement occurs. Similarly, when 
217 
activities are recorded as distances covered by players in field games such as 
218 
Association Football, codes of rugby, and court-based games, the use of "joules" 
219 
cannot occur.  Nevertheless, these types of activity can and often do require 
220 
considerable expenditures of energy. 
221 
 
222 
7. 
THE IMPULSE-MOMENTUM RELATIONSHIP 
223 
 
This relationship is fundamental to all activities in sport and exercise because it is 
224 
Newton's Second Law.  The Principia stated, although the original was in Latin:  
225 
 
226 
 
The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse 
227 
impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which 
228 
the impulse is impressed.  
229 
 Page 10 of 27 
 
 
 
230 
 
This law of motion, so expressed or in the instantaneous version (F = ma where m is 
231 
the system mass and a centre of mass acceleration) documents the mechanistic cause-
232 
effect of how forces modify motion. The vector nature of forces, impulses, 
233 
acceleration, and momentum means that these calculations are performed in defined 
234 
directions relevant to documenting the motion. 
235 
 
236 
 
The law can be expressed mathematically as follows (33): 
237 
 
238 
 
F  a 
239 
 
where: F is the mean force and a is the resulting mean acceleration. 
240 
 
241 
 
By introducing a constant, m, the proportionality expression can be changed into an 
242 
equation: 
 
 
243 
 
244 
 
F = m·a 
245 
 
where:  F is mean net force and  m is the mass of an object. 
246 
 
247 
 
Acceleration, a, is the rate of change of velocity so the equation can be expressed as: 
248 
 
249 
 
F = m·((v - u)/t) 
250 
 
where: v is final velocity, u is initial velocity and t is the duration over which the 
251 
change occurs.  This can be rearranged to: 
252 
 
253 
 
F·t = m·v - m·u 
254 
 Page 11 of 27 
 
 
 
where: F·t is the impulse of the force and m·v - m·u is the change of momentum of the 
255 
body, hence the name: the impulse-momentum relationship. 
256 
 
257 
 
For an activity such as vertical jumping in which initial velocity, u, is 0, the 
258 
expression becomes: 
259 
 
260 
 
Ft = m·v 
261 
 
In a vertical jump, there is a, vertical reaction force, R, that acts upwards and a weight, 
262 
mg, that acts vertically downwards.  In the above formula, the net force F, = R - mg. 
263 
 
264 
 
Rearrangement of the equation allows the velocity of the body at departure or release 
265 
to be identified: 
266 
 
267 
 
(F·t)/m = v 
268 
 
269 
 
This relationship is precise, mathematically irrefutable and describes not only 
270 
requirements for performance but importantly, also explains pre-requisites for 
271 
performance. 
272 
 
273 
 
For projectile activities in which an object is thrown, kicked, struck with an 
274 
implement such as a racket or stick, or when the projectile is the body as in horizontal 
275 
and vertical jumping, it is the velocity of the mass centre at departure or release and 
276 
the mass centre location in space that determine trajectory (1).  The vector nature of 
277 
velocity documents both magnitude (speed) and direction of the object's initial motion 
278 
 
279 
 Page 12 of 27 
 
 
 
Hence, the object could be propelled at great speed or alternatively, at low speed with 
280 
delicacy as for instance a drop-shot in racket-sports.  Neither high nor low speed is 
281 
effective without accurate direction.  It is the impulse applied to the object by the 
282 
performer either directly or with the assistance of an implement that enables the 
283 
performer to defeat their opponent.  In these cases, claims that a racket or performer is 
284 
powerful are misuses of terms.  In fact, the performer or racket may be said to be 
285 
impulsive. 
286 
 
287 
 
Effective technique requires the integration of several factors so as to optimise 
288 
impulse in the appropriate timing and direction for a movement task.  For example, 
289 
large forces are required but if they are too large, injury to muscle or tendon and in 
290 
extreme cases, bone, could occur (12).  When optimising throwing technique to 
291 
maximise distance thrown in events such as shot-put, discus and javelin, the duration 
292 
of contact with the implement before its departure is an important measure.  Similarly 
293 
in jumping, techniques are designed to capitalise on duration of  contact with the 
294 
ground immediately before departure into the air (3).  These durations must provide a 
295 
compromise of numerous factors including the jump goal, preparatory motions, and 
296 
exploitation of neuro-muscular properties using eccentric-to-concentric stretch-
297 
shortening cycle muscle actions (19). 
298 
 
299 
 
The ability to develop impulse is also important in field games such as rugby, 
300 
association football, and field- and ice-hockey as well as court-based games such as 
301 
tennis, squash, and basketball.  Players either have to outwit opponents with swerves 
302 
or "cuts" (side-steps) or change direction rapidly to reach a ball or avoid a tackle.  
303 
Such movements require changes in velocity i.e. where both speed and direction are 
304 
 Page 13 of 27 
 
 
deliberately changed.  Changes in these properties are determined by a generated 
305 
impulse. 
306 
 
307 
 
The words “power” and “explosive” are ubiquitously applied in research and 
308 
professional practice to tasks that are brief and require maximal neuromuscular 
309 
activation such as jumps, strikes, kicks and throws, as well as weightlifting and 
310 
resistance training (17).  This is in part driven by the proliferation of inexpensive and 
311 
easy-to-use systems to assess kinematics and kinetics during these movements, 
312 
particularly in the field of strength and conditioning.  Such devices produce an array 
313 
of variables, some of which are measured directly and others derived based on 
314 
Newtonian physics.  However, they are often poorly defined, are not valid, or simply 
315 
do not represent the performance being assessed.  Of particular concern is use of the 
316 
word “explosive”.  This is not a physics term and of course nothing actually “explodes” 
317 
in the human.  We recommend that the term “explosive” no longer be used to describe 
318 
human movement. 
319 
 
320 
 
“Power” is often expressed as a “clearly defined, generic neuromuscular or athletic 
321 
performance characteristic” rather than as an application of the actual mechanical 
322 
definition (17) which leads to considerable inaccuracy and confusion.  We reiterate 
323 
that maximal neuromuscular efforts have the goal of maximising the impulse 
324 
produced as this determines the resulting velocity as a result of the impulse-
325 
momentum relationship. Humans with inherent or developed abilities in such 
326 
movements would be more accurately described as “highly impulsive” and the most 
327 
appropriate measure of such performance is the impulse they produce.  To reinforce 
328 
the point, power is a scalar quantity with both peak and mean measures poorly related 
329 
 Page 14 of 27 
 
 
to jumping or throwing performance compared with resultant force or impulse that 
330 
predominantly dictate the performance outcome.  
 
331 
 
 
332 
 
So far, the focus has been on discrete actions but in many sports and activities, actions 
333 
are not discrete i.e. they do not occur only once, they have to be performed repeatedly; 
334 
for hours in the case of tennis and marathon running.  This leads to consideration of 
335 
effective impulse in endurance activities. 
336 
 
 
337 
8. 
ENDURANCE ACTIVITIES:  REPEATED IMPULSES 
338 
 
In endurance activities such as long-distance cycling and running, it is the ability 
339 
repeatedly to generate impulse that is decisive.  In cycling, force by each leg is 
340 
applied that creates an angular impulse which drives the rotation of the pedals and the 
341 
drive mechanism of the bicycle.  In one revolution of the pedal crank, two such 
342 
impulses are applied.  This contrasts with four-stroke internal-combustion engines, 
343 
where, for single-cylinder engines, there is only one propulsive phase for two 
344 
revolutions of the crankshaft.  A flywheel smooths the pulsatile impulses.  Each 
345 
individual impulse is applied for about only 120º of crankshaft motion (28) to create 
346 
an angular impulse about the crankshaft.  Multi-cylinder engines reduce the pulsatile 
347 
nature, so six-cylinder or greater configurations have no gaps in impulse. Race 
348 
engines that can exceed 18,000 rev·min-1 do not need a flywheel, because times 
349 
between impulses are miniscule. 
350 
 
351 
 
The linear impulse in cycling or in engines creates a moment of force and hence 
352 
angular impulse.  For convenience, performance in cycle ergometry or combustion 
353 
engines is expressed by steady-state power flows from the impulses that created them. 
354 
 Page 15 of 27 
 
 
However, most human movement is dynamic, not steady state about a non-moving 
355 
axis of rotation; so, external power flow is a poor descriptor of performance compared 
356 
to the impulses that change velocity. For effective tangential forces in cycling, 
357 
coordination of recruitment of numerous muscles has to occur to optimise innervation, 
358 
elasticity of structures - principally muscle and tendon - muscle fibre types and 
359 
metabolic determinants of force production.  This is vital both for sprinting and 
360 
prolonged cycling.  As with four-stroke engines, each propulsive impulse occurs for 
361 
approximately 120º of crankshaft rotation. The mean torque (propulsive moment of 
362 
force) or mean power output are secondary expressions of the forces that have created 
363 
and modified the movement. 
364 
 
365 
 
In running, the same logic applies.  Running is a series of impulsive footstrikes with 
366 
the ground and, in endurance running, the athlete's structural, innervation, and 
367 
metabolic characteristics have to be optimised to maintain the ability to generate 
368 
impulse so as to maximise progression.  This optimisation is an exceedingly complex 
369 
integration of biochemical, biomechanical, physiological, psychomotor, and other 
370 
factors (7). Endurance running needs to be economic so as to use as little chemical 
371 
energy as possible and similarly, minimise unproductive mechanical energy.  
372 
 
373 
 
As Winter (30) clearly indicated, this optimization or economic production of 
374 
effective forces to modify movement should not to be confused with "efficiency". 
375 
Efficiency in engines is a ratio of the work output to the energy input.  Efficiency 
376 
applied to human movement tries to create a simple ratio of the mechanical work 
377 
performed to the physiological energy expended:  
378 
 
379 
 Page 16 of 27 
 
 
 
(External mechanical work done/energy expended) x 100 
380 
 
381 
 
There are, however, numerous problems with this simple ratio as an indicator of 
382 
performance given the complexity both of the numerator and denominator. For 
383 
running, it is virtually impossible to meaningfully calculate the numerator in this 
384 
expression.  So in turn, determination of a meaningful measure of efficiency is also 
385 
impossible (7, 30). There are also problems with uniquely separating the internal 
386 
mechanical energy (energy to move limbs) and the external mechanical energy. There 
387 
are special issues of journals on this topic for interested readers (2, 7). While is it also 
388 
tempting to assume the energy expended is simply the oxygen consumption measured 
389 
over the event, like the numerator there is clearly more chemical energy being used by 
390 
the body than is being accounted for in the denominator.  Even so, misuse of 
391 
"efficiency" persists (11). 
392 
 
393 
 
In field games, the ability to repeatedly accelerate, decelerate, change direction, and, 
394 
kick or strike a ball, determines effective performance.  All of these actions require 
395 
the ability to repetitively generate well-timed and directed impulses.  That ability 
396 
encompasses skill to perform the action per se and endurance to do so repeatedly.  
397 
Deficiencies in one or both will adversely affect performance. 
398 
 
399 
 
For these activities, it is common to hear said or even read in research reports of 
400 
players performing supposedly at a “high work rate.”  If they were, by definition, their 
401 
power output would be high.  However, the assessment of external mechanical work 
402 
done is not possible hence, the term "work rate" is inapplicable.  It is colloquial and 
403 
 Page 17 of 27 
 
 
should not be used (24).  As the expression tends to be directed at players who run 
404 
large distances at high speeds, an acceptable alternative term is "high-intensity play". 
405 
 
406 
 
In cycling, it might be convenient to assess external power output, but this construct is 
407 
an approximation of the fundamental requirement: external impulse generation by the 
408 
body.  Moreover, selection of duration for mean power is important, since there are 
409 
considerable differences between mean and instantaneous power flows.  In maximal-
410 
intensity exercise, probably a mean value for at least a complete pedal revolution (32) 
411 
is required and in endurance activities, probably minutes if reliable values of this 
412 
secondary measure of performance are to be obtained. 
413 
 
414

THE MISNOMER "CRITICAL POWER" 
415 
 
416 
 
In 1965, Monod and Scherrer (21) announced a laudable method to quantify an 
417 
intensity of exercise that marked a limit to what was tolerable, primarily through 
418 
aerobic metabolism, although it should be acknowledged that Hill (13) had outlined 
419 
the principle some 40 years earlier.  This intensity was theoretical and represented 
420 
what could be sustained for infinite duration although in practice under laboratory 
421 
conditions, typical durations are 20 - 45 minutes (16).  The intensity was termed 
422 
“critical power”.  A search on Medline (14 April 2015) revealed that, since Monod 
423 
and Scherrer's (21) founding publication, 208 exercise-based manuscripts have been 
424 
published that used the expression.  At first sight, the term appears to be well 
425 
established, academically acceptable, and attractive but closer inspection quickly 
426 
reveals otherwise. 
427 
 
428 
 Page 18 of 27 
 
 
 
The majority of published studies (approximately two thirds) purporting to use 
429 
"critical power" have used some form of cycle-ergometer task.  Typically, four to six 
430 
bouts of all-out cycling to volitional exhaustion are performed at different external 
431 
resistances.  Ideally, each bout occurs on a separate day.  There is a hyperbolic 
432 
relationship between on the ordinate, mean external power output measured on a 
433 
cycle ergometer (using the product of external resistance and flywheel rotation to 
434 
determine the distance travelled by an imaginary point on the periphery of the 
435 
flywheel) and on the abscissa, duration of exercise i.e. time to exhaustion.  This 
436 
becomes a positive linear relationship when  mean external power output is expressed 
437 
as a function of the reciprocal of duration.  The vertical intercept of the relationship is 
438 
referred to as the "critical power".  An alternative way to calculate "critical power" is 
439 
to determine external mechanical work done (J) i.e. power output multiplied by 
440 
duration, and relate that to duration. This too is a positive linear relationship.  The 
441 
slope of the regression line has also been called "critical power". 
442 
 
443 
 
However, changes in pedalling rate affect the identified “critical power”; it is less at 
444 
greater pedalling rates than at lower (4).  This is explained principally by two factors.  
445 
First, Hill’s (14) muscle force-velocity relationship and second, additional internal 
446 
mechanical work that is required to move the limbs (30).  It is the latter that probably 
447 
has more effect and effectively highlights the folly of the term.  The lower limbs are 
448 
substantial structures in that they comprise some 32% of total body mass (8).  Forces 
449 
exerted by muscle to accelerate and decelerate these limbs sequester energy that 
450 
would otherwise be used for useful external output.  Unless pedalling rates are 
451 
controlled, comparisons of “critical power” and the implied optimality of this concept 
452 
are compromised (4).  According to Hill's force-velocity relationship in muscle (14), 
453 
 Page 19 of 27 
 
 
the optimisation of power output requires different pedalling rates for different 
454 
external resistances.  It is thus difficult to achieve overall optimisation of all factors 
455 
involved.  Similar force-velocity and technique variables confound the use of external 
456 
power flow in jumping (20, 26).  A scientist would ask, why abandon understanding 
457 
of 100% variance using impulse-momentum to use confounded secondary measures 
458 
such as power flows to study causative factors of movement? 
459 
 
460 
 
Add to this the problems previously noted in the adequacy of external power as a 
461 
secondary measure of performance and the energy/work/power not accounted for, one 
462 
may conclude that exercise science literature should avoid use of the concept of 
463 
“critical power".  Use of the term perpetuates the erroneous assumption that a vague, 
464 
colloquial meaning of "power" has a clear scientific meaning and is universally 
465 
applicable in the study of exercise performance.  This parallels the problems for a 
466 
practitioner-understanding of muscular performance and exercise science when in the 
467 
strength and conditioning literature, the term “power” is used as a surrogate for all 
468 
muscular performance that includes extremes of force or speed (17). 
469 
 
470 
 
When the concept is applied to running and swimming, performance can be expressed 
471 
as mean speed.  Using similar mathematical principles as for cycling, there is a 
472 
positive linear relationship between distance to exhaustion on the ordinate and time to 
473 
exhaustion on the abscissa. The slope of the regression line gives "critical speed".  
474 
Clearly, the term “power” and hence “critical power” is inapplicable, although the 
475 
term was still used in 11 manuscripts.  It should also be noted that the term “critical 
476 
velocity” is sometimes used (66 relevant Medline citations).  Unfortunately, such use 
477 
is frequently incorrect.  The vector nature of velocity challenges its use, whereas use 
478 
 Page 20 of 27 
 
 
of the scalar “speed” is not so challenged.  The scalar speed is preferable because it is 
479 
usually the measure of interest.  Moreover, the term "speed" is more likely to be 
480 
understood by the athlete and his or her support team, whereas "power" could be 
481 
interpreted differently, as indicated earlier. 
482 
 
483 
 
For isometric muscle activity, mean force can be plotted against duration of force 
484 
application.  In this case, all the terms “work”, “power” and “speed” are inapplicable.  
485 
Monod and Scherrer (21) acknowledged this, albeit erroneously: 
486 
 
487 
 
“Static contraction does not affect work in the physical sense.” (page 333) 
488 
 
489 
 
The error is because “work” is simply inapplicable; it is the wrong mechanical 
490 
construct to use in this context. 
491 
 
492 
 
Monod and Scherrer (21) were aware of this and in addition wrote: 
493 
 
494 
 
“The critical rate of static work (sic) has the dimension of a force.  Therefore it is in 
495 
fact a critical force.”  (page 334). 
496 
 
497 
10. 
“CRITICAL INTENSITY” 
498 
 
499 
 
Despite its apparent popularity in the literature, the term “critical power” has limited 
500 
applicability.  It should be restricted to: activities where steady-state mean external 
501 
power output is relevant to performance; when it can be meaningfully assessed; and 
502 
when confounding factors (e.g. pedalling rate) can be controlled. The potential 
503 
 Page 21 of 27 
 
 
relevance of the term is also compromised by failure to consider the important 
504 
contributions of internal power requirements that are apparent in greater cycling rates 
505 
of the limbs.  Instances where such assessment and control occur are rare in the 
506 
exercise science literature.  The term “critical speed” can be used where it is 
507 
impossible, or at best exceptionally difficult, to get any measure of external power 
508 
output.  The term “critical force” may be used where isometric muscle activity is the 
509 
interest because “power” is simply inapplicable. 
510 
 
511 
 
However, “critical power”, “critical speed”, and “critical force” are all measures of 
512 
the same quality: a critical intensity of exercise. This intensity marks a limit to what is 
513 
sustainable before fatigue makes the performer slow down, or reduce force 
514 
application.  It is inconsistent and nonsensical to have three names for the same 
515 
phenomenon.  It is also incorrect to express critical power (a mechanical power) in the 
516 
units of speed (m·s-1), force (N), or torque (N·m).  Such expression is counter to 
517 
Newtonian mechanics, the SI, and standards of scientific reporting.  Together, the 
518 
several terms and non-compliance with Newton are quite simply, not science.  Monod 
519 
and Scherrer (21) identified this failing, but seemed unsure how to rectify matters.  
520 
Some 50 years on, the solution is remarkably simple:  the term “critical power” 
521 
should be replaced with “critical intensity” and documented with the appropriate SI 
522 
units depending on the particular movement or action. 
523 
 
524 
 
The ability to tolerate exercise at high intensity for long durations is the key 
525 
characteristic of successful endurance athletes. Importantly, this tolerance embraces 
526 
statics  that is relevant to many activities and sports such as gymnastics, climbing, 
527 
cycling, swimming, and running. 
528

11. 
APPROPRIATENESS OF "INTENSITY" 
530 
 
Use of "intensity" to express the challenge posed by exercise was first advocated by 
531 
Knuttgen (18).  It is an elegant way to avoid misuse of mechanical constructs.  
532 
Objections to use of the term are unfounded.  Intensity is in general use in the 
533 
categorisation of exercise into domains that are based on physiological responses.  
534 
Intensity domains are "moderate", "heavy", "very heavy" and "severe" ` (29) and 
535 
"extreme" (15).  These categorisations apply to all forms of static and dynamic 
536 
exercise.  The term is also used in the tripartite requirement for effective training i.e. 
537 
frequency, intensity and duration of training.  Moreover, recent interest in high-
538 
intensity interval training (10) further indicates support for acceptability and use of 
539 
the term. 
540 
 
541 
 
The term "intensity" is recognised by the SI, but not defined universally.  It is 
542 
expressed as W·m-2.  However, a principal and established use of the term is in 
543 
luminescence to quantify brightness of light.  The SI unit of luminous intensity is the 
544 
candela, i.e. power emitted by a light source in a particular direction.  It has the unit 
545 
cd, roughly equivalent to the light emitted by a candle.  However, the unit is not 
546 
expressed as W·m-2 although it could be considered to be traceable to the watt 
547 
because of its definition: the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that 
548 
emits monochromatic radiation of a frequency 540 x 1012 hertz and that has a radiant 
549 
intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian. Moreover, another unit of light 
550 
is the lumen.  This is a measure of luminous flux as opposed to radiant flux.  The 
551 
former reflects the varying sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of 
552 
 Page 23 of 27 
 
 
light whereas the latter indicates power of all electromagnetic waves emitted, 
553 
independent of the eye's ability to perceive them.  It is equivalent to 1 cd·sr-1. 
554 
 
555 
 
While exercise could be perceived as a rate of movement through space i.e. W·m-2, 
556 
that would not permit application to isometric activity or the scalar speed.  As science 
557 
develops in response to phenomena that emerge, either new units have to be 
558 
developed or old ones have to be adapted.  The (Shorter) Oxford English Dictionary 
559 
defines intensity in physics as: "A (measurable) amount of energy, brightness, 
560 
magnetic field etc".  The "etc." is important. The term "intensity" has a utility that 
561 
allows it to be applied to exercise.  It avoids infatuation with "power" and other 
562 
constructs and provides a solution to correct what Monod and Scherrer themselves 
563 
acknowledged about "critical power": its inapplicability for isometric muscle activity 
564 
and where performance is expressed as the scalar speed (21).  Added to which is 
565 
recognition that meaningful use of "power" is possible only if many pre-requirements 
566 
are satisfied.  It is rare that such satisfaction occurs. 
567 
 
568 
12. 
CONCLUSION 
569 
 
If sport and exercise science is to advance, it must uphold the principles and practices 
570 
of science.  Descriptions of exercise must make correct use of basic scientific terms, 
571 
nomenclature, and units.  Greater recognition and use of Newton's Second Law of 
572 
motion as the explanation of how forces modify movement, rather than less-accurate 
573 
secondary performance variables in research reports and their critical review, are 
574 
needed.  Many errors in use of SI nomenclature can be rectified by adoption of the 
575 
term "intensity" to categorise exercise in terms of its actual or perceived challenge 
576 
and into domains based on physiological responses.  While Monod and Scherrer’s (21) 
577 
 Page 24 of 27 
 
 
method to identify a limit of tolerance to exercise is a valuable way to investigate 
578 
mechanisms of fatigue, the self-acknowledged flaws in naming this limit “critical 
579 
power” are problematic.  This problem can easily be rectified: the term should be re-
580 
named “critical intensity” and performance documented by the SI units relevant to the 
581 
activity being studied.   Universal adoption of intensity will help reduce the confusion 
582 
and perpetuation of erroneous understanding of mechanical work, energy, and power 
583 
in sport and exercise.  Importantly, adoption of this recommendation by journal 
584 
editorial teams will help advance sport and exercise science.
