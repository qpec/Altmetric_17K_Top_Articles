abstract
BACKGROUND: Longitudinal research is needed to identify predictors of continued electronic 
cigarette (e-cigarette) use among youth. We expected that certain reasons for first trying 
e-cigarettes would predict continued use over time (eg, good flavors, friends use), whereas 
other reasons would not predict continued use (eg, curiosity).
METHODS: Longitudinal surveys from middle and high school students from fall 2013 
(wave 1) and spring 2014 (wave 2) were used to examine reasons for trying e-cigarettes as 
predictors of continued e-cigarette use over time. Ever e-cigarette users (n = 340) at wave 
1 were categorized into those using or not using e-cigarettes at wave 2. Among those who 
continued using e-cigarettes, reasons for trying e-cigarettes were examined as predictors 
of use frequency, measured as the number of days using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at 
wave 2. Covariates included age, sex, race, and smoking of traditional cigarettes.
RESULTS: Several reasons for first trying e-cigarettes predicted continued use, including 
low cost, the ability to use e-cigarettes anywhere, and to quit smoking regular cigarettes. 
Trying e-cigarettes because of low cost also predicted more days of e-cigarette use at wave 
2. Being younger or a current smoker of traditional cigarettes also predicted continued use 
and more frequent use over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory strategies such as increasing cost or prohibiting e-cigarette use 
in certain places may be important for preventing continued use in youth. In addition, 
interventions targeting current cigarette smokers and younger students may also be 
needed.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Electronic 
cigarette (e-cigarette) use among youth is rapidly 
increasing. Although studies have identifi
 ed 
reasons youth cite for initially trying e-cigarettes, 
it is unknown whether these reasons relate to 
e-cigarette use longitudinally.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Younger students, 
traditional cigarette smokers, and those trying 
e-cigarettes for low cost or to use them anywhere 
were more likely to continue e-cigarettes or use 
on more days. Findings suggest regulatory and 
intervention strategies are needed to prevent 
continued e-cigarette use.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are battery-operated devices used to 
vaporize solutions that may contain 
nicotine and flavors. E-cigarette 
use among middle and high school 
students is rapidly increasing. 
1, 
 
2 Data 
from the National Youth Tobacco 
Survey indicate current e-cigarette 
use rates tripled from 2013 to 2014 
among middle school (1.1% to 3.9%) 
and high school (4.5% to 13.4%) 
students, and e-cigarettes were 
the most commonly used tobacco 
product in 2014. 
2 Similar rates have 
been found in our surveys from 
Connecticut where 1.5% of middle 
school students and 12.0% of high 
school students reported current use 
of e-cigarettes. 
3
Although some argue that 
e-cigarettes may be helpful for harm 
reduction or smoking cessation, 
 
4 
others are concerned about 
the potential for initiation and 
continued use of e-cigarettes by 
youth, 
 
5, 
 
6 especially among youth 
who are not current traditional 
cigarette smokers given that little is 
known about the health effects 
of e-cigarettes at this time. As a 
result, researchers have examined 
reasons for initiating e-cigarettes 
to better understand what attracts 
people to this product. For example, 
data from focus groups and surveys 
indicate youth often try e-cigarettes 
because of curiosity, friend and 
family influences, and good flavors. 
7, 
8 
A recent cross-sectional study in 
adult e-cigarette users identified 
similar reasons for experimentation 
and noted that adults who continued 
use were more likely to report 
trying e-cigarettes for goal-directed 
reasons (eg, using e-cigarettes where 
smoking is not allowed). 
9 However, 
studies to date have been limited to 
cross-sectional surveys assessing 
reasons for e-cigarette continuation 
or discontinuation retrospectively. 
Longitudinal research is needed 
to better understand what factors 
predict continued e-cigarette use 
over time.
In the present study, our goal was 
to build on our previous research 
identifying reasons for e-cigarette 
initiation 
7 by examining whether 
these reasons for trying e-cigarettes 
predicted continued use among youth 
over time. We analyzed a sample 
of anonymous longitudinal survey 
data from middle and high school 
students who ever tried e-cigarettes 
to identify specific reasons for trying 
e-cigarettes at wave 1 (fall 2013) that 
predicted continued e-cigarette use 
at wave 2 (spring 2014).
Based on previous research, 
 
7, 
 
9 we 
hypothesized that adolescents who 
tried e-cigarettes because of general 
interest (ie, curiosity or a belief that 
they are “cool”) would be less likely 
to continue using e-cigarettes. We 
hypothesized that the following 
reasons for trying e-cigarettes would 
predict an increased likelihood 
of continuing e-cigarette use: (1) 
desirable attributes (ie, good flavors, 
does not smell bad, can hide it from 
adults, low cost) in accordance with 
research on appeal and enjoyment 
of smoking 
10 
– 
13; (2) social norms 
(ie, friends use it, parents/family 
use it, can use it anywhere) based on 
evidence of the importance of peer 
and parental influences on smoking 
7, 
 
14; 
and (3) goal-directed reasons 
(ie, to quit smoking regular cigarettes 
or because it is healthier than regular 
cigarettes) based on findings in adult 
e-cigarette users. 
9 In addition, we 
explored whether these reasons for 
initiating e-cigarette use predicted 
not only continued use but frequency 
of use (ie, greater number of days 
used in the past month) at wave 2. 
Given evidence that youth e-cigarette 
users are more likely to be smokers 
of traditional cigarettes, 
3, 
 
15 
– 
17 we 
examined whether cigarette smoking 
status at wave 1 was associated 
with continued e-cigarette use or 
more frequent use at wave 2. These 
findings may help identify factors 
that relate to continued e-cigarette 
use over time that can be used to 
inform prevention and regulation 
efforts for youth.
METHODS
Study Procedures
Study procedures were approved 
by the Yale Institutional Review 
Board and participating schools. 
Survey responses were confidential 
and anonymous, and students were 
informed that participation was 
voluntary. Information sheets were 
mailed to parents in advance of the 
study, and parents were instructed to 
contact the research staff if they did 
not want their child to participate. No 
parents from wave 1 and 12 parents 
from wave 2 declined participation 
for their child. Survey administration 
followed the same procedures 
outlined elsewhere. 
3, 
 
7
Data were obtained from school-
wide surveys that were repeated 
in 2 middle schools and 3 high 
schools in fall 2013 and spring 2014. 
Surveys were matched across time 
points by using a self-generated 
identification code (SGIC) 
18, 
 
19 
composed of 6 unique indicators: 
first letter of middle name, second 
letter of last name, day value from 
date of birth, school, homeroom, and 
sex. This method has been used in 
other longitudinal studies in which 
preserving anonymity is important, 
such as collecting data on youth 
substance use. 
19 
–21
In accordance with the recommended 
SGIC-matching procedures, SGICs 
with >1 missing variable were 
removed from the analysis. Data 
from both waves were then matched 
as long as they had ≥5 identical 
SGIC elements. These procedures 
have been shown to maximize valid 
matches in longitudinal anonymous 
data that do not collect participant 
names or identifiable information. 
20, 
 
22 
The match rate of the study sample 
was 72.0%, representing 2100 
students of 2915 who provided data 
at both wave 1 and wave 2 surveys.

This match rate is comparable to 
other anonymous longitudinal 
surveys. 
19, 
 
22
Sample characteristics at wave 1 
were compared between the matched 
and unmatched sample. Match rates 
were slightly higher among female 
students (77.7%) compared with 
male students (71.0%) (χ2 test [n = 
2822], 16.71; P < .001). The matched 
sample was also slightly younger 
than the unmatched sample (mean ± 
SD age, 14.4 ± 1.9 vs 14.6 ± 2.0 years, 
respectively; t[1208.4] = 2.70; 
P = .007). Although these values 
are statistically different, the actual 
differences were small and not 
considered to be meaningful.
Participants
A subsample of ever e-cigarette 
users (n = 340) was used for the 
present analyses. The subsample 
was 47.4% female; 93.8% were high 
school students, and their mean age 
was 15.6 ± 1.2 years. The majority 
(86.2%) identified as white, 6.8% 
Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, 2.1% black, 
1.5% biracial, and 1% “other.”
Wave 1 Measures: Fall 2013
Students were selected as ever 
e-cigarette users if they responded 
“yes” to the question “have you 
ever tried an e-cigarette” (16.2% 
of the 2100 matched sample). Ever 
e-cigarette users reported reasons 
for first trying e-cigarettes and 
selected all that applied: curiosity, 
it is cool, good flavors, does not 
smell bad, can hide it from adult, low 
cost, my friends use it, my parents/
family use it, can use it anywhere, to 
quit smoking regular cigarettes, it 
is healthier than regular cigarettes. 
Response options were coded as 
“yes/no” for each reason. Rates of 
endorsement are presented in  
Fig 
1. Past month traditional cigarette 
smoking status was coded as “yes” 
(ie, ≥1 day of use, 25.3%) or “no.” 
Past month other tobacco use 
was coded as “yes” (ie, any use of 
smokeless tobacco, cigars, or hookah, 
26.2%), or “no.” E-cigarette frequency 
at wave 1 was assessed with an 
open-response question: “How many 
days out of the last 30 did you use 
e-cigarettes”?
Wave 2 Measures: Spring 2014
E-cigarette frequency at wave 2 was 
assessed with an open-response 
question: “How many days out of 
the last 30 did you use e-cigarettes”? 
Youth were coded as continuing (ie, 
≥1 day of use in the past 30 days) 
or not continuing (ie, 0 days of use) 
e-cigarette use at wave 2.
Data Analysis
Analyses were conducted by using 
SPSS version 21 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 
IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). 
Logistic regression models examined 
reasons for trying e-cigarettes at 
wave 1 as predictors of continuing 
e-cigarette use at wave 2. Sensitivity 
analyses examined the pattern of 
results when continuation status 
was imputed (170 continuing vs 
153 not continuing) based on other 
survey response options from wave 
2 where possible (eg, a response of 
“I did not use e-cigarettes in the past 
30 days”) and separately when these 
data were missing (140 continuing vs 
102 not continuing). Odds ratios are 
presented as estimates of effect size 
rather than risk ratios given evidence 
that the assumption of homogeneity 
is more tenable for odds ratios. 
23
Among those who continued 
e-cigarette use, reasons for trying 
e-cigarettes at wave 1 were 
examined as predictors of e-cigarette 
frequency at wave 2 by using linear 
regression models given the normally 
distributed outcome. Youth who 
provided e-cigarette frequency data 
(n = 140) did not significantly differ 
from those without frequency data 
who were categorized as continuing 
e-cigarette use (n = 30) on key 
variables such as age, sex, race, or 
frequency of e-cigarette use reported 
at wave 1.
Given that multiple reasons could be 
selected, reasons were first entered 
into separate models and then into a 
simultaneous multivariable model to 
estimate both the independent and 
unique variance accounted for by 
each reason. Estimates are presented 
from unadjusted and adjusted models

that included dichotomous covariates 
(sex, race, traditional cigarette 
smoking status, and other tobacco 
use). The primary outcomes did not 
differ significantly by school, but all 
models controlled for school status 
(middle school versus high school).
RESULTS
Predictors of Continued E-Cigarette 
Use
Reasons for first trying e-cigarettes 
were examined as predictors of 
continued e-cigarette use ( 
Table 1). 
In independent models, several 
reasons for first trying e-cigarettes 
predicted continued e-cigarette use, 
including good flavors, does not 
smell bad, can hide from adults, low 
cost, friends use, can use anywhere, 
to quit smoking regular cigarettes, 
and because they are healthier than 
cigarettes. Once including traditional 
cigarette smoking status in the 
model, good flavors, can hide from 
adults, and healthier than regular 
cigarettes no longer predicted 
continued e-cigarette use; these 
reasons were endorsed more often 
by current cigarette smokers. In 
a multivariable model including 
all reasons simultaneously, trying 
e-cigarettes to quit smoking was the 
most robust predictor of continued 
e-cigarette use. In addition, middle 
school students and traditional 
cigarette smokers were more likely 
to continue e-cigarette use over time. 
Similar results were obtained in 
sensitivity analyses that compared 
findings when continuation status 
was imputed based on other survey 
response options or left missing, 
except where noted in  
Table 1.
Predictors of Number of Days of 
E-Cigarette Use
Among those who continued 
e-cigarette use, mean frequency 
of use (measured as the number 
of days used in the past 30 days) 
increased significantly from 7.4 ± 
9.6 days at wave 1 to 10.4 ± 10.5 
days at wave 2 (t[113] = –3.14; P = 
.002).  
Figure 2 displays the mean 
frequency of e-cigarette use at wave 
2 based on specific reasons for trying 
e-cigarettes.
Reasons for first trying e-cigarettes 
were examined as predictors of 
e-cigarette frequency at wave 2 
( 
Table 2). In independent models, 
several reasons for first trying 
e-cigarettes predicted more frequent 
use including good flavors, hide from 
adults, low cost, can use anywhere, 
and to quit smoking regular 
cigarettes, while curiosity predicted 
less frequent use. Once adjusting 
for other covariates including 
e-cigarette frequency at wave 1, 
trying e-cigarettes because of low 
cost was the most robust predictor 
of more frequent use at wave 2. In 
addition, middle school students and 
traditional cigarette smokers were 
using e-cigarettes more frequently at 
wave 2.
DISCUSSION
The present study used matched 
longitudinal data to examine whether 
reasons youth cite for initially trying 
e-cigarettes in fall 2013 (wave 1) 
predicted continued e-cigarette use 
and the frequency of e-cigarette 
use (measured by number of days

used in the past 30 days) in spring 
2014 (wave 2). These results extend 
previous research that identified 
reasons for initiating e-cigarettes 
among youth 
7 by examining how 
these reasons predict e-cigarette use 
longitudinally. Longitudinal studies 
of e-cigarette use patterns are a 
critical step in informing prevention 
efforts to reduce appeal and interest 
in using e-cigarettes among youth.
The most frequently endorsed 
reasons for trying e-cigarettes 
included curiosity, good flavors, and 
friends use, which are consistent 
with earlier research 
7 and suggest 
monitoring peer use and youth 
curiosity may be important for 
identifying risk for e-cigarette 
use. We found initial support 
for our hypotheses that reasons 
related to general interest (ie, 
curiosity, it is cool) would relate to 
experimentation but not continued 
use over time. Youth who reported 
trying e-cigarettes because of 
curiosity were using on fewer days of 
the past 30 days at wave 2 compared 
with those who did not endorse this 
reason, but this relationship was not 
robust or significant once including 
other covariates.
Conversely, we expected desirable 
attributes of e-cigarettes, social 
norms, and goal-directed reasons 
for trying e-cigarettes would predict 
continued and more frequent 
e-cigarette use, and initial support 
was found for these hypotheses. 
In particular, several desirable 
attributes (good flavors, does not 
smell bad, can hide from adults, 
and low cost), social norms (friends 
use and can use it anywhere), and 
goal-directed reasons for trying 
e-cigarettes (to quit smoking regular 
cigarettes and healthier than regular 
cigarettes) predicted continued use 
at wave 2 in independent univariate 
models. The most robust predictors 
of continued use included trying 
e-cigarettes because they can be 
used anywhere and to quit smoking 
traditional cigarettes. Other reasons 
may not have remained significant 
in the adjusted models in part due to 
their overlap with being a traditional 
cigarette smoker (eg, good flavors, 
hide from adults, healthier than 
cigarettes) or with other reasons that 
were endorsed. Furthermore, linear 
regression results indicated that 
trying e-cigarettes because of low 
cost was a robust predictor of more 
frequent e-cigarette use (more days 
used in the past 30 days) at wave 2, 
even after controlling for frequency 
of use at wave 1 and other covariates.
These results provide preliminary 
information that suggests part of 
the appeal of e-cigarette use for 
youth may be the ability to use 
e-cigarettes anywhere (eg, places 
where traditional cigarettes are 
presently banned, including indoor 
locations) or because of low cost. 
These findings suggest it may be 
important to consider creating and 
appropriately enforcing regulatory 
bans of e-cigarettes similar to 
current clean air laws for traditional 
cigarettes to help prevent continued 
e-cigarette use in youth. 
24 In 
addition, our findings are consistent 
with recent focus group research 
indicating that low cost is considered 
to be a positive characteristic of 
e-cigarettes, 
 
25 and they are the 
first to suggest low cost relates 
to continued use longitudinally. 
Evidence from national studies have 
shown that tobacco control policies 
that increased traditional cigarette 
prices were particularly effective in 
reducing youth smoking rates, 
 
26, 
 
27 
suggesting it may be helpful to 
consider similar regulation strategies 
for e-cigarettes.
Trying e-cigarettes to quit smoking 
was also a robust predictor 
of continued e-cigarette use, 
which remained significant in a 
multivariable model even when 
controlling for other covariates 
and other reasons for trying 
e-cigarettes. However, this reason 
was endorsed by few youth (5.9%) 
and did not correlate highly with 
the endorsement of other reasons. 
Nonetheless, these results suggest 
that a subsample of youth e-cigarette 
users try e-cigarettes to quit smoking

traditional cigarettes, which is in 
line with other research. 
28 Although 
the sample was small, 80% of youth 
who endorsed trying e-cigarettes 
to quit smoking were still smoking 
traditional cigarettes at wave 2. 
Furthermore, being a traditional 
cigarette smoker not only doubled 
the odds of continuing e-cigarette 
use but also predicted more days 
of e-cigarette use at follow-up. In 
light of these findings and concerns 
others have raised that dual use of 
traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes 
potentially increases the risk of 
nicotine addiction in youth, 
 
15, 
 
16, 
 
29 
developing effective cessation 
programs targeted for reducing 
both traditional cigarette and 
e-cigarette use among youth will 
be critical. In particular, health care 
providers can play an important 
role in screening youth tobacco use, 
advising abstinence from all tobacco 
products, and suggesting alternative 
cessation strategies for youth who 
are traditional cigarette smokers.
In terms of other covariates, 
younger students were more likely 
to continue e-cigarette use and use 
on more days in the past 30 days 
at follow-up. These findings are 
concerning given evidence that the 
adolescent brain is still developing 
and is highly sensitive to nicotine.

More research is needed to 
understand the long-term effects 
of e-cigarette use among youth. In 
particular, future research related to 
the timing of e-cigarette initiation is 
needed to inform optimal delivery 
of intervention and prevention 
strategies. Evidence from other 
studies indicates that awareness and 
use of e-cigarettes are increasing 
among younger adolescents.

32, 
33 
These findings suggest interventions 
aimed at preventing e-cigarette 
initiation may be most effective for 
younger grades.
The current findings should be 
considered with the following 
limitations in mind. First, our results 
are limited by the self-report nature

–0.16, P = .08; e-cigarette frequency in the past month at wave 1, B = 0.40, SE = 0.11, β = 0.36, P = .001.
Similar results are seen if including age instead of school status (middle school versus high school) in the model; age is negatively related to the frequency of e-cigarette use, B = –1.97, SE = 0.73, β = –0.26, P = .008.

of the surveys and therefore may be 
subject to reporting bias. Second, 
it is possible that youth who had 
previously tried e-cigarettes but were 
not using in the past 30 days at wave 
2 had simply experimented and were 
not ever regular users; however, we 
believe this population is still a useful 
reference group to compare with 
those youth who had previously tried 
and were still using e-cigarettes at 
wave 2. Third, we did not explicitly 
examine reasons why youth continue 
using e-cigarettes; our findings, 
however, may help inform this 
future research. After initially trying 
e-cigarettes, youth may continue 
to use for many reasons, including 
because they like certain aspects of 
the product or they become addicted 
to nicotine. Fourth, we surveyed a 
relatively diverse area, including 
multiple schools; however, our 
results may not generalize to other 
demographic samples, including 
those not currently in school or 
other geographic locations. Fifth, 
our estimates have wide confidence 
intervals given the low prevalence 
of endorsement of several reasons, 
and additional larger studies are 
needed to provide more precise 
effect estimates. Lastly, we are 
limited by the assessment time 
frames used here examining whether 
ever e-cigarette users continued 
use over the course of an academic 
year. However, even within this 
short amount of time, we were able 
to identify predictors of continued 
use that could be used to inform 
intervention efforts.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study builds on past 
research by identifying specific 
reasons for trying e-cigarettes that 
predict continued use longitudinally 
among youth. Younger students, 
users of traditional cigarettes, 
and those trying e-cigarettes for 
low cost or to use them anywhere 
were more likely to continue 
e-cigarettes or use on more days. 
These findings suggest regulatory 
strategies such as increasing cost 
or prohibiting e-cigarette use in 
certain places may be important for 
preventing continued use in youth. In 
addition, given the limited available 
information on e-cigarette safety 
for youth, it will be important to 
communicate potential health risks of 
tobacco use among youth.
