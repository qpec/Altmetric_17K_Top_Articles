IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiome plays a critical role in infant development, and
delivery mode and feeding method (breast milk vs formula) are determinants of its
composition. However, the importance of delivery mode beyond the first days of life is
unknown, and studies of associations between infant feeding and microbiome composition
have been generally limited to comparisons between exclusively breastfed and formula-fed
infants, with little consideration given to combination feeding of both breast milk and
formula.
OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of delivery mode and feeding method with infant
intestinal microbiome composition at approximately 6 weeks of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective observational study of 102 infants followed
up as part of a US pregnancy cohort study.
EXPOSURES Delivery mode was abstracted from delivery medical records, and feeding
method prior to the time of stool collection was ascertained through detailed questionnaires.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Stool microbiome composition was characterized using
next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS There were 102 infants (mean gestational age, 39.7 weeks; range, 37.1-41.9 weeks)
included in this study, of whom 70 were delivered vaginally and 32 by cesarean delivery. In
the first 6 weeks of life, 70 were exclusively breastfed, 26 received combination feeding, and
6 were exclusively formula fed. We identified independent associations between microbial
community composition and both delivery mode (P < .001; Q < .001) and feeding method
(P = .01; Q < .001). Differences in microbial community composition between vaginally
delivered infants and infants delivered by cesarean birth were equivalent to or significantly
larger than those between feeding groups (P = .003). Bacterial communities associated with
combination feeding were more similar to those associated with exclusive formula feeding
than exclusive breastfeeding (P = .002). We identified 6 individual bacterial genera that were
differentially abundant between delivery mode and feeding groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The infant intestinal microbiome at approximately 6 weeks of
age is significantly associated with both delivery mode and feeding method, and the
supplementation of breast milk feeding with formula is associated with a microbiome
composition that resembles that of infants who are exclusively formula fed. These results
may inform feeding choices and shed light on the mechanisms behind the lifelong health
consequences of delivery and infant feeding modalities.

Topical medications, including those given for conjunctivitis
and antifungals, such as those given for thrush, were not con-

had received a prescription antibiotic.
At a Glance
•We examined the associations between the intestinal
microbiome of 6-week-old infants, delivery mode, and feeding
method, including supplementation of breast milk feeding with
formula.
•We observed significant independent associations between the
composition of the infant gut microbiome and both delivery
mode and feeding method.
•Differences in microbiome composition between vaginally
delivered infants and infants delivered by cesarean birth were
greater than feeding method–associated differences.
•Infants fed a diet of both formula and breast milk had a stool
microbiome that resembled that of infants fed exclusively
formula.

Sample Collection, DNA Extraction, and Sequencing
Study participants provided infant stool samples collected at
regularlyscheduledmaternalpostnatalfollow-upvisits(6weeks
post partum). Stool was aliquoted in sterile tubes and frozen at
−80°Cwithin24hoursofreceipt.SampleswerethawedandDNA
was extracted using the Zymo DNA extraction kit (Zymo Re-
search).ThequantityandpurityoftheDNAweredeterminedby
OD260/280 nanodrop measurement. The reliability and stabil-
ity of these methods were described by Wu et al.27 Illumina tag
sequencingofthe16SrRNAgeneV4-V5hypervariableregionwas
performed at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole,
Massachusetts, using established methods.28,29 Details of se-
quencing methods, quality control and filtering, and statistical

Results
Participant Characteristics and Variability and Diversity
of the Early Neonatal Microbiome
We evaluated the associations between the composition of the
6-week intestinal microbiome and both delivery mode and
feeding method in 102 full-term, appropriately grown infants
enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Delivery
medical records, telephone surveys, and feeding diaries were
used to assess study participant characteristics including de-
livery mode and feeding method at the time of stool sample
collection (Table 1). We found no significant association be-
tween delivery mode and feeding method (eTable in the
Supplement; Fisher exact test: P = .66).
We sequenced the V4-V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rDNA
to characterize the microbial communities present in a stool
samplefromeachstudyparticipantat6weeksofage.Sequenc-
ing yielded a total of 14 362 739 bacterial DNA reads (mean,
140 811; range, 27 897-260 579), of which 8 210 402 (mean,
80 494; range, 12 244-178 802) passed quality filters (eAppen-
dix in the Supplement). These were assigned to 241 bacterial
genera. More than 90% of reads were represented by 10 gen-
era(Table2).StoolsamplesweredominatedbyBacteroidesand
Bifidobacterium comprising half of sequence reads, with Strep-
tococcus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Blautia, Veillonella, Lac-
tobacillus, Staphylococcus, Planococcus, and others represent-
ing the remainder (Table 2).
Associations Between Delivery Mode, Feeding Method,
and Microbial Community Composition
Overall stool microbiome community composition was char-
acterized using generalized UniFrac analysis.30 Controlling for
the effects of feeding method, delivery mode was strongly as-
sociated with infant gut microbiome composition (P < .001;
Q < .001) (Figure 1A). Likewise, controlling for the effects of
deliverymode,theoverallassociationbetweenfeedingmethod
and stool microbiome community composition was also sta-
tistically significant (P = .01; Q < .001) (Figure 1B). In pair-
wise comparisons of the 3 feeding methods, exclusive breast-
feeding was associated with a microbiome community distinct
from that of infants who were either exclusively formula fed
(P = .04; Q = .05) or fed a combination of breast milk and for-
mula prior to stool collection (P = .02; Q = .04). There was no
statistically significant difference between infants fed a com-
bination of breast milk and formula and those fed exclusively

formula in terms of microbiome composition. There was no
significant interaction observed between delivery mode and
feeding method (P = .49). The lack of an interaction between
delivery mode and feeding method remained even after com-
biningexclusivelyformulafedandcombination-fedinfantsinto
a single group (P = .53).
Wecalculatedwithin-andbetween-groupaverageUniFrac
distances to assess the group-specific phylogenetic diversity of
the microbial communities we observed in our participants.
Within-group distances between infants within specific deliv-
ery mode and feeding method groups revealed similar average
phylogeneticdistancesamonginfantswhowerebornvaginally
comparedwiththosebornbycesareandelivery(Figure2A).The
greatest within-group average pairwise phylogenetic distance
was observed among those infants who were fed breast milk
supplementedwithformula;pairswithinthisgroupwereonav-
eragesignificantlylesssimilarthanpairswithintheexclusively
breastfed group (P = .02 and P = .04, respectively), while other
comparisons did not reach statistical significance (Figure 2B).
Between-group pairwise UniFrac distances were, on av-
erage, as large or larger between vaginally delivered and ce-
sarean-deliveredinfantsastheywerebetweeninfantsfromdif-
ferent feeding groups (Figure 2C). For feeding method, average
bacterial community phylogenetic distance was greatest be-
tween infants who were exclusively breastfed compared with
those exclusively formula fed and between infants who were
exclusivelybreastfedcomparedwiththosewhowerefedbreast
milk supplemented with formula. In contrast, the average dis-
tance was smallest between infants who were fed a mix of
breast milk and formula and those fed exclusively formula.
We were concerned that some of the participants in the
combination-fed group may have been offered the breast in
the first few days following delivery but were otherwise ef-
fectively exclusively formula fed, which may have driven the
difference we observed between exclusively breastfed and
combination-fed infants in terms of between-group differ-
ences.Infact,ofinfantswhowerecombinationfedinourstudy,
all but 2 were fed breast milk for at least the first 2 weeks of
life. To test the robustness of this finding in light of the pos-
sible effect of these 2 infants, we repeated the UniFrac analy-
sis after reassigning those 2 infants from the mixed feeding
group to the exclusively formula–fed group, and no qualita-
tive differences in the results were observed (data not shown).
Individual Taxon Abundance by Delivery Mode
and Feeding Method
Vaginal delivery (vs cesarean delivery) was associated with in-
creased abundance of Bacteroides (P < .001; Q = .02) and Pec-
tobacterium (P = .001; Q = .02) and with decreased abundance
ofStaphylococcus(P = .001;Q = .02),Rothia(P = .006;Q = .07),
and Propionibacterium (P = .01; Q = .009) in infant stool, after
adjustment for feeding method (Figure 3A). Feeding was asso-
ciated with differential abundance in Lactococcus (P < .001;
Q = .002), which was depleted in exclusively breastfed infants
compared with those who were exclusively formula fed
(Figure 3B). No taxa were significantly differentially abundant
between infants who were combination fed vs exclusively for-
mula fed or exclusively breastfed (Figure 3C and D).
Discussion
We characterized the intestinal microbiome of 102 6-week-
old infants and observed independent associations between
stoolmicrobialcommunitycomposition,modeofdelivery,and
feeding method. In healthy infants, the process of delivery is
the initial encounter with microorganisms capable of coloniz-
ing the intestinal tract. In a previous study of 24 healthy
women, vaginal microbiome composition became less di-
verse between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy

and just before delivery was enriched with Lactobacillus spe-
cies, likely contributing to vertical transmission of these bac-
teria during vaginal birth.21 In a study of 10 newborns in Ven-
ezuela, within hours of delivery, the intestinal tracts of infants
born vaginally were colonized by Lactobacillus and Pre-
votella, whereas infants delivered operatively acquired bac-
teria present on the mother’
s skin and the hospital environ-
ment, such as Staphylococcus, Proprionibacterium, and
Corynebacterium.15 Our findings, based on a large group of
6-week-old infants, indicated that Lactobacillus also contrib-
utes to the microbial environment of the gut but to a lesser ex-
tent than Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, and Streptococcus.
Other studies have observed differences in older infants
according to delivery mode. A study of 24 infants aged 3 to 4
months in Canada found that 2 of 26 taxa evaluated were dif-
ferentially abundant between vaginally and operatively de-
livered babies, including Bacteroides, which was depleted in
cesarean-delivered infants relative to those who were vagi-
nally delivered.9 This result was also observed in a longitudi-
nal study of 24 infants in Sweden, which reported that the
depletion of Bacteroides in cesarean-delivered infants per-
sisted until 12 months of age.13 Another longitudinal study of
75 infants in Singapore found that the acquisition of “nor-
mal” gut flora was delayed in infants born by cesarean
delivery.31
To our knowledge, our study was the first to examine the
contribution of delivery mode to infant intestinal micro-
biome composition in association with that of another impor-
tant predictor of microbiome composition, infant diet. We
found that delivery mode was more strongly associated with
infant microbiome composition than was diet at 6 weeks. We
observed differences in microbial community composition be-
tween vaginally delivered and cesarean-delivered infants that
were comparable or slightly greater than the largest differ-
ences associated with feeding.
We observed an association between feeding method and
microbiome composition that remained statistically signifi-
cant even after adjusting for delivery mode. Although a few
previous studies have found associations between infant feed-
ingandintestinalmicrobiomecomposition,9-12,14toourknowl-
edge, none has examined the relative contribution of combi-
nation feeding (breast milk and formula) alongside exclusive
formula or breastfeeding to overall microbial community com-
position. This is an important group to consider because com-
bination feeding is common, for example, in the first few days
in the hospital when lactogenesis II is delayed while a moth-
er’
s breast milk is becoming established, among mothers who
have difficulty producing adequate milk and supplement their
own milk with infant formula, or among mothers who are un-
able or choose not to pump breast milk when separated from
their babies. We found that the distinction between the mi-
crobial communities according to feeding method was larg-
est between infants fed exclusively breast milk and those fed
either combination diets or exclusively formula. Infants fed
both breast milk and formula had intestinal microbial com-
munitiesthatweresimilartothosefedexclusivelyformulaand
relatively distinct from those fed exclusively breast milk. This
finding offers new evidence to support the tenets of the World

There have been no long-term longitudinal studies of
the effects of early feeding method on the microbiome, but
early feeding has the potential for lasting effects on micro-
bial community structure,32 and these effects may be one
mechanism for the health benefits of breastfeeding on child-
hood and lifelong health. Digestion and metabolism of nutri-
ents are likely influenced by the intestinal microbiome,33
and there is a well-established connection between breast-
feeding and lower risk for childhood and adult-onset obesity
likely mediated in part by the microbiome in early life (re-
viewed in the study by Thompson34). Oligosaccharides in
breast milk are thought to promote Bifidobacterium
growth,35 and decreased Bifidobacterium in infancy has been
found to be associated with an increased risk for being over-
weight at age 10 years.36 Many formulas are supplemented
with prebiotics such as short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides
and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides that increase the
overall representation of Bifidobacterium in the microbiome
of formula-fed infants, and similar to breast milk, promote
lactate and short-chain fatty acid prevalence in the infant
gut (reviewed in the study by Oozeer et al37). Although we
did not observe a significant association between increased
abundance of Bifidobacterium and breastfeeding in our
study, Bifidobacterium was present at greater abundance in
exclusively breastfed infants compared with others. Com-
pared with combination-fed infants, this enrichment
approached statistical significance before correction for mul-
tiple comparisons.

Positive coefficients indicate independent associations with vaginal delivery (A)
or breast milk exposure (B-D) after controlling for the other. Point colors
correspond to adjusted P values of >.10 (light gray), �.10, >.05 (dark gray),
�.05, >.01 (orange), and �.01 (blue). Circles are sized according to relative
log-ratio–transformed abundance. The bold labels indicate genera that were
significantly differentially abundant after controlling for the false discovery rate
at a significance level of Q = .10. Note differences in the axis scales.

sampled at a single time point; thus, our findings may not be
entirely generalizable to populations elsewhere or to differ-
ent points in infant development. While ours, to our knowl-
edge, is one of the largest studies examining the factors that
shape the infant microbiome, our sample size of 102 infants
limited our statistical power, which precluded stratified analy-
sesforidentifyinganyinteractionsbetweendeliverymodeand
feeding method. In addition, while we were able to catego-
rize feeding practices, the exact proportion of the diet that was
made up of either breast milk or formula and the exact timing
of formula supplementation (eg, in hospital after delivery vs
beginning just prior to 6 weeks) was not considered. It is pos-
sible that infants who received formula supplementation only
at birth were able to recover a microbiome that resembles that
of an exclusively breastfed infant. A previous study high-
lighted infant nutrition as a major contributor to the early mi-
crobiota composition and function, with cessation of breast-
feeding contributing the most fundamental shift in the
composition of bacteria.8 A longitudinal study with more par-
ticipants would allow us to determine the temporal dynam-
ics of the effects of feeding practices and changes therein, as
well as the persistence of the effects of both feeding and de-
livery mode later in infancy. Additionally, exposures, such as
postnatal antibiotics, were rare in this cohort and therefore in-
fants with antibiotic exposure were eliminated from analy-
sis. In the future, the evaluation of prenatal, peripartum, and
postpartum antibiotic exposure and their role in the trajec-
tory of microbiome development, as well as the interrelation-
ship with delivery mode and dietary exposures, will be im-
portant. Thus, our results will need to be replicated in larger
multicenter studies and in prospective analyses. While the
UniFrac analyses we performed suggest independent associa-
tions between microbiome composition and both delivery
mode and feeding method, the substantial overlap between
the communities defined by both factors suggests that there
are other important drivers of microbiome community com-
position that remain to be identified in future analyses.
Conclusions
Understanding the patterns of microbial colonization of the in-
testinal tract of healthy infants is critical for determining the
health effects of specific alterable early-life risk factors and ex-
posures. To this end, we have identified measurable differ-
ences in microbial communities in the intestinal tracts of in-
fants according to their delivery mode and diet, with possible
consequences for both short- and long-term health.
