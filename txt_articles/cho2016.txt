Scope: Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite linked to the gut microbiota, is asso-
ciated with excess risk of heart disease. We hypothesized that (i) TMAO response to animal
source foods would vary among healthy men and (ii) this response would be modified by their
gut microbiome.
Methods and results:
A crossover feeding trial in healthy young men (n = 40) was con-
ducted with meals containing TMAO (fish), its dietary precursors, choline (eggs) and carnitine
(beef), and a fruit control. Fish yielded higher circulating and urinary concentrations of TMAO
(46–62 times; p < 0.0001), trimethylamine (8–14 times; p < 0.0001), and dimethylamine
(4-6-times; P<0.0001) than eggs, beef, or the fruit control. Circulating TMAO concentrations
were increased within 15 min of fish consumption, suggesting that dietary TMAO can be
absorbed without processing by gut microbes. Analysis of 16S rRNA genes indicated that high-
TMAO producers (�20% increase in urinary TMAO in response to eggs and beef) had more
Firmicutes than Bacteroidetes (p = 0.04) and less gut microbiota diversity (p = 0.03).
Conclusion: Consumption of fish yielded substantially greater increases in circulating TMAO
than eggs or beef. The higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes enrichment among men exhibiting
a greater response to dietary TMAO precursor intake indicates that TMAO production is a
function of individual differences in the gut microbiome.

or can be generated from other nutrients including choline
(abundant in eggs) and carnitine (abundant in beef). Upon
consumption of foods containing TMAO or its dietary pre-
cursors (choline and carnitine), it is proposed that gut bac-
teria generate trimethylamine (TMA; volatile, fish odor com-
pound) [1] and to a lesser extent, dimethylamine (DMA) with
subsequent absorption via enterohepatic circulation [2]. The
majority of TMA is enzymatically converted to the odor-
less TMAO metabolite in a reversible reaction catalyzed
by vitamin B2 dependent flavin-containing monooxygenase
3 (FMO3) in the liver. Loss-of-function mutations in this

enzyme give rise to the rare genetic disorder known as
trimethylaminuria or “the fish odor syndrome” [3]. Alterna-
tively, TMA can be demethylated to DMA and methylamine
(MA).
The significance of TMAO in physiologic processes re-
ceived early attention due to its function as an osmolyte
[4]. In addition, farmers recognized the benefits of adding
TMAO to animal feed for the purposes of improving growth,
carcass quality, and nutrient digestibility [5]. More recently,
TMAO has emerged as a predictive risk factor for heart dis-
ease in cardiac patients [6, 7] and colorectal cancer among
postmenopausal women [8]. However, very little is known
about the effects of animal source foods on TMAO genera-
tion, absorption, and elimination in healthy adults. Further-
more, although there is an apparent role of the gut microbes
in TMAO production, the gut microbiota composition in re-
lation to TMAO production in humans has not been deter-
mined.
Therefore, we aimed to test the hypotheses that (i) TMAO
response to animal source foods would vary among healthy
men and (ii) this response would be modified by their gut mi-
crobiota composition. To achieve these aims, we conducted
a crossover feeding trial whereby healthy young men con-
sumed study meals of fish, eggs, meat, and a fruit con-
trol in random order with 1-week washout periods. TMAO
biomarker response to the study meals was quantified in
plasma and urine, while gut microbiota composition was as-
sessed in feces. Because the FMO3 G472A genetic variant
may adversely influence TMA conversion to TMAO [9], men
were genotyped for this polymorphism, which was consid-
ered as a covariate in the statistical models.

Methods and materials
2.1
Participants
Healthy men (n = 40) aged 21–50 years with a BMI of 20–
29.9 kg/m2 were recruited by flyers posted around the Cornell
University’s Ithaca campus and surrounding area from May
to June 2014. A sample size of n = 40 was determined from
a power analysis of a within-subject design to detect a 10%
difference of plasma TMAO concentration at � <0.05 and
� = 0.8. Participants were screened by the use of a blood
chemistry profile, cell count, and health history question-
naire. The exclusion criteria were men of age >50 years, BMI
�30 kg/m2, women, vegetarians, smokers, and individuals
with gastrointestinal diseases or complaints, chronic illnesses
or other metabolic diseases (including trimethylaminuria),
abnormal blood chemistry values indicative of organ dysfunc-
tions, and those taking nutritional supplements, antibiotics or
probiotics within 2 months of recruitment. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants, and the proto-
col was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Hu-
man Study Participants at Cornell University (Protocol ID#:
1403004534). This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02558673.
2.2
Study design
A randomized, controlled crossover design with four arms
composed of study meals representing animal sources of
TMAO and a fruit control was used in this study. Figure 1A
depicts the participant flow throughout the study and the
study design. The study meals were (i) eggs (three whole
hard boiled; Wegmans), (ii) beef (6 ounces Philly-Gourmet
Beef Patties, 100% Pure; Tops), (iii) fish (6 ounces cod fillet;
Tops)], and (iv) the fruit control (two single-serve packages of
Mott’s natural applesauce; Tops), and were administered in
commonly consumed servings. The order of study meals for
each participant was assigned by a study investigator using
random number generator (random.org), and each meal was
administered in a single day separated by a 1-week washout
period. All meals were prepared in the Human Metabolic
Research Unit (HMRU) kitchen at Cornell University on the
morning of testing.
2.3
Protocol
The study procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1B. After an
overnight fast (10 h), participants arrived at the HMRU be-
tween 0700–1000 h for each of the four visits. The day prior
to the study session, participants were advised to avoid con-
sumption of grapefruit juice and indole-containing vegeta-
bles (i.e., broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale,
and bok choy) as these foods can decrease FMO3 enzyme
activity and alter TMAO metabolism [2]. Participants were
also asked to maintain their normal routine, including exer-
cise, and eat a similar meal the night before each of the four
sessions.
At the beginning of each session, participants completed
a 24-h dietary recall to assess compliance to the grapefruit
juice and indole food restriction. If participants reported
consumption of these foods, or significant deviations from
their normal routine, the session was rescheduled. A base-
line blood sample was obtained by a phlebotomist using a
standard venipuncture procedure, and participants collected
their baseline urine sample.
Participants then consumed a randomly allocated study
meal with one cup of water within a 15-min period. Following
the consumption of the study meal, serial blood samples were
obtained at 15 and 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, and each par-
ticipant collected their urine samples into bottles throughout
the 6-h study period, which were subsequently pooled. At 4.5
h, participants were provided a fixed snack (i.e., applesauce)
and water. Throughout each study session, participants re-
frained from eating and drinking foods and beverages (other
than water) outside those provided by study personnel.

Sample collection
At the screening visit, fasting serum and whole blood were ob-
tained for blood chemistry profiles and complete cell counts,
respectively, using a previously described method [10]. Dur-
ing the feeding trials, plasma and buffy coat were obtained
for metabolite measurements [11, 12] and FMO3 G472A (rs
2266782) genotyping.
Urine was self-collected in wide-mouth specimen contain-
ers (120 mL; Thermo Scientific) at study baseline, and in
wide-mouth polyethylene bottles (1 L; Nalgene) during the
6-h period, and kept on ice. Urine volumes were recorded
separately for study baseline and the 6-h study period. In
addition, prior to consumption of the fruit control, partici-
pants collected stool (complete bowel movement) in a bag
provided by study personnel and delivered to the HMRU
in a thermoinsulated bag with ice packs. All samples were
deidentified, distributed among several storage vials, and
stored at –80�C for further analyses.

at screening by the Act diff 2 hematology analyzer (Beckman
Coulter).
2.5.2
TMAO metabolite measurements
TMAO, TMA, DMA, and MA were measured in plasma,
urine, and study meals by LC-MS/MS as described by John-
son et al. [13] with modifications to measure all of the metabo-
lites in a single run. Samples were run in batches with each
batch containing all time points and study meals. Study meal
total choline (sum of free choline, glycerophosphocholine,
phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin),
betaine, and carnitine contents were quantified by the meth-
ods of Koc et al. [14] and Holm et al. [15] with modifications
[16]. All meals were quantified in a single batch.
2.5.2.1
Sample preparation
For plasma metabolites, 100 �L plasma was mixed with
200 �L ACN and 10 �L internal standard, and cen-
trifuged at 20 817 × g for 5 min at room temperature.
Stock solutions for the internal standard were prepared
by mixing d3-MA hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), d6-DMA
hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), NG-methyl-L-arginine ac-
etate (Sigma-Aldrich), 13C3-TMA hydrochloride (Isotec), d3-
betaine ammonium chloride (CDN Isotopes), L-carnitine-d3
hydrochloride (CDN Isotopes), d13-choline chloride (CDN
Isotopes), 13C3-TMAO (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc),
and methyl-13C L-methionine (Cambridge Isotope Labora-
tories) in methanol:water (1:1). The supernatant was trans-
ferred to a vial with a disposable glass insert and 2 �L con-
centrated NH4OH and 30 �L ethyl bromoacetate (EBA; 20
mg/mL in ACN) were added. After incubation at room tem-
perature for 45 min, the solution was diluted 1:1 with a mix-
ture of water:ACN:CH2O2 (1:1:0.0005) prior to injection into
the LC-MS/MS system. The calibration points were prepared
from stock solutions to yield the following final concentra-
tions (all in nmol/mL): TMAO (0.04–400), TMA (0.002–0.3),
DMA and choline (0.2–30), betaine (0.4–200), and carnitine
(0.2–200).
For urine metabolites, 50 �L urine was mixed with 10
�L internal standard, 2 �L concentrated NH4OH, and 60 �L
EBA (20 mg/mL in ACN). After incubation at room temper-
ature for 45 min, the solution was diluted 7:1 with a mixture
of water:ACN:CH2O2 (1:1:0.0005) and injected into the LC-
MS/MS system. The calibration points were prepared from
stock solutions to yield the following final concentrations (all
in nmol/mL): TMAO and DMA (40–8000); TMA (0.1–20); MA
(2–400); and choline, betaine, and carnitine (2-400). Metabo-
lite concentrations in urine were adjusted for Cr, which was
measured using the Dimension Xpand chemistry analyzer
(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic) in the Human Nutritional
Chemistry Service Laboratory at Cornell University.
For food, 40 mg food homogenate (study meal homog-
enized in 0.1 M sterilized potassium phosphate buffer) was
mixed with 150 �L of 0.1% CH2O2 in ACN and 10 �L of inter-
nal standard. The mix was centrifuged at 20 817 × g for 10 min
at 4�C followed by transfer of the supernatant into a vial with
a disposable glass insert. Concentrated NH4OH (2 �L) and
30 �L EBA were added to the supernatant and incubated at
room temperature for 45 min. The solution was then diluted
1:1 with a mixture of water:ACN:CH2O2 (1:1:0.0005) prior to
injection into the LC-MS/MS system. The calibration points
were prepared from stock solutions to yield the following fi-
nal concentrations (all in nmol/extract): TMAO, betaine and
carnitine (0.3–80), TMA, and DMA (0.15–40), MA (0.75–200),
and choline (1.5–400).
2.5.2.2
LC-MS/MS analyses
Metabolites in urine and study meals were measured using
the Accela HPLC system TSQ Quantum Access mass spec-
trometer (ThermoElectron Corp), while those in plasma were
measured using the Surveyor HPLC system TSQ Quantum
Ultra mass spectrometer. The injection volume was 10 �L,
and the column and autosampler temperatures were at 25 and
5�C, respectively. Metabolites were separated on a Prevail sil-
ica column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5 �m; Grace) with a matching
guard column (7.5 × 2.1 mm, 5 �m). The mobile phase con-
sisted of ACN and 0.1% formic acid in 0.15 mmol/L ammo-
nium acetate in water (CH2O2-NH4OAc) with the following
gradient: 81% ACN, 19% CH2O2-NH4OAc at 0 min with a
flow rate of 200 �L/min, 81% ACN, 19% CH2O2-NH4OAc at
8 min with a flow rate of 500 �L/min, then linear gradient
to 65% ACN, 35% CH2O2-NH4OAc at 10 min with a flow
rate of 500 �L/min, 65% ACN, 35% CH2O2-NH4OAc at 13
min with a flow rate of 400 �L/min, then from 13 to 15 min
linear gradient back to 81% ACN, 19% CH2O2-NH4OAc, and
from 15 to 20 min the column was equilibrated to original
conditions with a flow rate of 500 �L/min.
ESI in the positive ion mode and multiple reaction moni-
toring were used to detect the following transitions: m/z 76.3
→ 58.4 for TMAO and m/z 162.1 → 60.1 for carnitine. TMA,
DMA, and MA were derivatized with EBA and the transi-
tions were as follows: m/z 146.1 → 118.1 for TMA-EBA,
m/z 132.1 → 58.1 for DMA-EBA, and m/z 118.1 → 44.3 for
MA-EBA.
Metabolite and food concentrations were determined rel-
ative to standard curves, which were prepared by mixing var-
ious amounts of TMAO, TMA, DMA, and MA with water.
The intraassay CV for plasma and urine was 2% and 1% for
TMAO, 17% and 4% for TMA, 2% and 2% for DMA, and
ND and 8% for MA, whereas the interassay CV for plasma
and urine was 6% and 5% for TMAO, 38% and 8% for TMA,
6% and 6% for DMA, and ND and 49% for MA based on
in-house control duplicates (n = 3 with differing TMAO con-
centrations for plasma; n = 2 with differing TMAO concen-
trations for urine). The relatively low precision for TMA and
MA represents the volatility and/or low abundance of these
compounds.

2.5.3
Genotyping
DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col (DNeasy Tissue kit; Qiagen) from buffy coat. The FMO3
G472A (rs 2266782) variant [9] was determined using a
commercially available fluorescent Taqman probe kit (Ther-
moFisher Scientific) on the LightCycler R
� 480 real-time RT-
PCR instrument (Roche) as previously described [17].
2.5.4
16S rRNA gene sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from �100 mg of stool
using the PowerSoil High-Throughput DNA Isolation Kit
(MoBio Laboratories) with bead beating according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were
PCR amplified for the V4 hypervariable region using the
515F and 806R primers as previously described [18] and se-
quences found at the Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.
earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/16s/).
PCR
reactions consisted of Hot Master PCR mix (Five Prime),
10–100 ng DNA template and 10 �M of each primer, with
initial denaturation at 94�C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles
of denaturation at 94�C for 45 s, annealing at 50�C for 60 s,
extension at 72�C for 90 s, and final extension at 72�C for
10 min. Duplicate PCR reactions were performed for each
sample and were combined and purified using magnetic
beads (Mag-Bind EZPure, Omega Bio-Tek). Purified PCR
amplicons were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen ds-
DNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Amplicons were then combined
into a single tube with a final concentration of 11 ng/�L. Of
the 40 stool samples, five samples failed to amplify, thus 35
samples of DNA were sequenced paired-end on the Illumina
MiSeq platform at Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center
Genomics Facility.
2.6
16S rRNA gene sequence analyses
Matching paired-end sequences were merged using the fastq-
join command and demultiplexed in the open-source soft-
ware package Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
version 1.8.0 [19]. Quality filtering removed sequences con-
taining low-quality reads (Phred quality score �25), ambigu-
ous bases, primer mismatches, uncorrectable barcodes, and
lengths <200 bp. Of the 35 sequenced samples, nine sam-
ples did not meet the quality control filtering, therefore 26
samples were used for the gut microbiome analyses. De novo
operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking was performed us-
ing the UCLUST algorithm. Representative OTU sequences
were aligned using PyNAST with 80% identity and were taxo-
nomically classified using Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)
classifier at 97% identity. A phylogenetic tree was built using
FastTree. Rarefaction was performed at 60,000 sequences per
sample to calculate �-diversity (within sample diversity) using
Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, Chao 1 and Observed Species,
as well as jack-knifed �-diversity (between sample diversity)
using the unweighted UniFrac distance matrices for princi-
pal coordinates analysis. A heatmap was created from the log
abundance of all genera using the R package.
2.7
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS (Version 9.3, SAS
Institute). Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) using the PROC MIXED model procedure deter-
mined the effect of study meal, time, and study meal-by-
time interaction on metabolite concentrations in plasma and
urine. The covariates, age, BMI, study session order, and
genotype (FMO3 G472A), which did not reach a significance
of p � 0.05, were removed from the model in a stepwise
manner. A significant interaction effect was followed by one-
way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey–Kramer post hoc
test. Participants were categorized as high-TMAO produc-
ers or low-TMAO producers based on the median excretion
of TMAO (20%) following the consumption of the egg and
beef meals. After sample sequencing and data quality filter-
ing, the gut microbiota composition was compared between
high-TMAO producers (n = 11) and low-TMAO producers
(n = 15) using false discovery rate corrected ANOVA and
nonparametric anosim statistical method within Quantitative
Insights Into Microbial Ecology. Unpaired t-test was used to
assess differences in the baseline characteristics of the TMAO
response groups. Significant differences were reported at a
False Discovery Rate adjusted p < 0.05. All data are expressed
as means ± SEM.

Participant characteristics and baseline
metabolite concentrations
Forty healthy men had a mean age of 27.8 ± 1.0 years, BMI of
24.2 ± 0.4 kg/m2, and serum blood chemistry and blood cell
counts within the normal range (Table 1). Thirty-five percent
of the participants were homozygous wild-type GG genotype
for FMO3 G472A, 55% were heterozygous GA, and 10% were
homozygous variant AA, which is consistent with the distri-
bution observed in the general population [20]. TMAO and
its derivatives did not differ across study meals.

any detectable levels of these metabolites (Table 2). Food MA
did not differ among the study meals. Total choline concentra-
tion was 125 times higher in eggs and 38 times higher in beef
and fish (p < 0.0001) compared to the fruit control. Food be-
taine content was 27 times higher in beef and fish compared
to egg and fruit meals (p < 0.0001). Carnitine was highest
(p < 0.0001) in beef followed by fish and then eggs and not
detected in the fruit control.

(Fig. 2). As compared to egg, beef, and fruit control,
fish consumption yielded plasma concentrations that were
48–62 times higher for TMAO (p < 0.0001), 8–14 times
higher for TMA (p < 0.0001), and 4–5 times higher for DMA
(p < 0.0001), all of which peaked at 2 h and remained elevated

not detectable in plasma.
Similar to plasma levels, study meal interacted with time
(p < 0.005) to influence urinary TMAO and its derivative
concentrations (Table 3). Fish consumption resulted in uri-
nary excretions that were 46–51 times higher for TMAO (p
< 0.0001), 9–12 times higher for TMA (p < 0.0001), and six
times higher for DMA (p < 0.0001) as compared to egg, beef,
and fruit control during the 6-h study period (p < 0.0001).
Because of the substantial TMAO response following con-
sumption of the fish study meal, we were unable to detect dif-
ferences in TMAO response among the egg, beef, and fruit
study meals. Thus, we assessed TMAO response for eggs,
beef, and fruit separately from fish, and compared the re-
sponse to study baseline (Fig. 3). A greater increase in plasma
TMAO at each time point was detected for eggs and beef
compared to the fruit control (p < 0.05). Likewise, the change
in urinary TMAO excretion across the 6-h study period was
greater following the consumption of eggs and beef compared
to the fruit control (p = 0.03).
Notably, the individual variations in urinary TMAO re-
sponse after the consumption of eggs and beef ranged from
–30% to 270% (Fig. 4). We therefore stratified our partici-
pants into high-TMAO producers (n = 11; those with �20%
increase in urinary TMAO in response to eggs and beef) ver-
sus low-TMAO producers (n = 15; those with <20% increase
in urinary TMAO in response to eggs and beef) for the micro-
biome analyses (see Section 3.4). We also assessed for differ-
ences in the baseline characteristics of the TMAO response
groups but none were detected (see Supporting Information
Table 1).

Gut microbiota composition
To address whether microbiota composition was a determi-
nant of TMAO response, we obtained a one-time baseline
stool sample from each participant. Of the 40 stool sam-
ples, 26 samples were used in the analyses after amplifi-
cation and quality control yielding 6,770,441 high-quality
gene sequences with average sequences lengths (mean ±
standard deviation) of 254 ± 10. High-TMAO producers
had lower �-diversity (within-individual) measure than low-
TMAO producers (p = 0.03 with 999 permutations by Monte
Carlo method; Fig. 5). Principal coordinates analysis of the
unweighted UniFrac distances and relative abundance of

sented by Clostridiales within the Firmicutes phylum of
which were Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Veillonel-

mine whether this response was influenced by an individ-
ual’s gut microbiome. Three main findings emerged: (i) fish
consumption yielded several-fold higher quantities of TMAO
metabolites than either eggs or beef, (ii) dietary TMAO can be
absorbed intact without processing by gut microbes, and (iii)
high-TMAO producers (�20% increase in urinary TMAO in
response to eggs and beef) had more Firmicutes than Bac-
teroidetes and a less diverse gut microbiome.
4.1
Fish consumption yields the highest
concentrations of plasma and urinary TMAO
concentrations compared to all other study
meals
Fish consumption yielded �50 times higher circulating con-
centrations of TMAO than either eggs or beef, which is
consistent with previous reports of substantially higher uri-
nary TMAO concentrations [21, 22] following the consump-
tion of fish compared to meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables, or
grain. Notably, plasma TMAO was elevated within 15 min

of fish consumption indicating that the absorption of dietary
TMAO may occur without processing to TMA by the gut mi-
crobes as previously proposed [23]. The sustained elevation in
circulating TMAO in response to fish consumption, despite
substantial urinary excretion, suggests that a portion of the
TMAO is retained by the body possibly due to its functions as
an osmolyte [4] and protein stabilizer [24]. Other derivatives
influenced by diet, albeit to a lesser extent than TMAO, in-
cluded TMA and DMA, both of which showed higher levels
in response to fish versus eggs and beef.
In light of the recent proposed role of TMAO as a causative
agent for cardiovascular disease [7,23], and a recent report of
higher serum TMAO concentrations and accelerated aortic
plaque formation in apoE null mice with increased fish in-
take [25], some researchers have advocated for the restriction
of animal source foods that raise circulating TMAO concen-
trations [7]. However, these animal source foods are enriched
in nutrients that are required for optimal health [26], and fish
consumption is well known for its cardioprotective attributes
in humans [27]. Moreover, in more recent studies, circulat-
ing TMAO and carnitine concentrations were inversely as-
sociated or showed no association with the development of
chronic diseases [28, 29]. Thus, caution is warranted when
proposing dietary recommendations that restrict the intakes
of animal source foods because of their TMAO-raising char-
acteristics.
4.2
TMAO response to dietary precursors may be a
biomarker of the gut microbiota composition
Gut microbes are known to participate in modulating TMAO
response to its dietary precursors and potentially chronic dis-
ease susceptibility [6, 23, 30]. However, TMAO response is
highly variable and it is unclear whether this variation arises
from individual differences in gut microbiota composition.
To address this question, we used urinary TMAO excretion
to stratify our participants into “high” (�20% increase) or

“low” (<20% increase) TMAO producers, and examined dif-
ferences in the gut microbiota composition between the two
groups.
Although differences in the gut microbiota were subtle at
the individual OTU level, high-TMAO producers were charac-
terized by enriched ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes com-
pared to low-TMAO producers (Fig. 4), which is consistent
with previous reports that TMAO production potential is de-
tected in Firmicutes but absent in Bacteroidetes [31]. Further-
more, low-TMAO producers had more archaea Methanobre-
vibacter, which has been proposed to deplete host TMA lev-
els [32]. Lower �- diversity (within-individual difference) was
also observed among high-TMAO producers indicating that
TMAO production may be driven by a select set of bacteria
(e.g., Firmicutes).
Distinct gut microbiota profiles between high-TMAO
compared to low-TMAO producers in response to its di-
etary precursors indicate that circulating TMAO may be a
biomarker of the gut microbiota. As such, higher circulating
concentrations of TMAO in a disease versus nondisease state
may reflect differences in gut microbe composition, rather
than indicating a causative role of TMAO in the disease pro-
cess. A greater ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes has pre-
viously been associated with increased risk of obesity and
metabolic syndrome [33], and this gut microbiota character-
ization may also be linked to atherosclerosis-associated dys-
biosis. The significance of these findings is that circulating
TMAO may be used to identify individuals with microbiota
profiles that increase disease susceptibility, and thereby in-
form the development of dietary and pharmaceutical strate-
gies aimed at increasing gut microbiota diversity and restor-
ing the symbiotic relationship between the gut microbes and
their host.
4.3
Study limitations and future directions
This was a short-term feeding study that focused on advanc-
ing current understanding of TMAO metabolism in healthy
male adults. As such, the findings may not reflect long-term
effects of the diet and may not be generalizable to other seg-
ments of the population including women and those with
health conditions. In addition, predisease clinical endpoints,
such as markers of inflammation, were not evaluated. More
studies are needed to address these important issues and eval-
uate the clinical utility of lowering circulating concentrations
of TMAO as a means to improve human health.

Conclusion
Consumption of fish, which is high in TMAO, yielded sub-
stantially greater increases in circulating TMAO than eggs
or beef, which contain high amounts of dietary TMAO pre-
cursors. The rapid rise in circulating TMAO in response to
fish consumption demonstrated that the absorption of intact
dietary TMAO occurs in a manner that is independent of
the gut microbes. The higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes mi-
crobial enrichment among men exhibiting greater response
to dietary TMAO precursor intake indicates that circulating
TMAO can reflect a person’s microbiota, which may in turn
modulate their risk of disease.
