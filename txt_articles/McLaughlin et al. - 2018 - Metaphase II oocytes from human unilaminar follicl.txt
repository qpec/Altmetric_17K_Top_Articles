STUDY QUESTION: Can complete oocyte development be achieved from human ovarian tissue containing primordial/unilaminar follicles
and grown in vitro in a multi-step culture to meiotic maturation demonstrated by the formation of polar bodies and a Metaphase II spindle?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Development of human oocytes from primordial/unilaminar stages to resumption of meiosis (Metaphase II) and
emission of a polar body was achieved within a serum free multi-step culture system.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Complete development of oocytes in vitro has been achieved in mouse, where in vitro grown (IVG)
oocytes from primordial follicles have resulted in the production of live offspring. Human oocytes have been grown in vitro from the second-
ary/multi-laminar stage to obtain fully grown oocytes capable of meiotic maturation. However, there are no reports of a culture system sup-
porting complete growth from the earliest stages of human follicle development through to Metaphase II.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained with informed consent from women undergoing elective
caesarean section (mean age: 30.7 ± 1.7; range: 25–39 years, n = 10).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Laboratory setting. Ovarian biopsies were dissected into thin strips, and after
removal of growing follicles were cultured in serum free medium for 8 days (Step 1). At the end of this period secondary/multi-laminar follicles
were dissected from the strips and intact follicles 100–150 μm in diameter were selected for further culture. Isolated follicles were cultured indi-
vidually in serum free medium in the presence of 100 ng/ml of human recombinant Activin A (Step 2). Individual follicles were monitored and after
8 days, cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were retrieved by gentle pressure on the cultured follicles. Complexes with complete cumulus and
adherent mural granulosa cells were selected and cultured in the presence of Activin A and FSH on membranes for a further 4 days (Step 3). At
the end of Step 3, complexes containing oocytes >100 μm diameter were selected for IVM in SAGE medium (Step 4) then fixed for analysis.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Pieces of human ovarian cortex cultured in serum free medium for 8 days (Step 1)
supported early follicle growth and 87 secondary follicles of diameter 120 ± 6 μm (mean ± SEM) could be dissected for further culture. After
a further 8 days, 54 of the 87 follicles had reached the antral stage of development. COCs were retrieved by gentle pressure from the cul-
tured follicles and those with adherent mural granulosa cells (n = 48) were selected and cultured for a further 4 days (Step 3). At the end of
Step 3, 32 complexes contained oocytes >100 μm diameter were selected for IVM (Step 4). Nine of these complexes contained polar bodies
within 24 h and all polar bodies were abnormally large. Confocal immuno-histochemical analysis showed the presence of a Metaphase II spin-
dle confirming that these IVG oocytes had resumed meiosis but their developmental potential is unknown.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a small number of samples but provides proof of concept that complete develop-
ment of human oocytes can occur in vitro. Further optimization with morphological evaluation and fertilization potential of IVG oocytes is
required to determine whether they are normal.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The ability to develop human oocytes from the earliest follicular stages in vitro through to
maturation and fertilization would benefit fertility preservation practice.

Introduction
In vitro systems have been developed to support the growth and develop-
ment of mouse oocytes from the most immature stage to produce devel-
opmentally competent oocytes (Eppig and O’Brien, 1996; O’Brien et al.,
2003). The most immature stage of follicles (primordial) can be grown in
a two-step culture system to produce oocytes that can be fertilized, and
live offspring have been produced from these in vitro grown (IVG) oocytes
(Eppig and O’Brien, 1996; O’Brien et al., 2003). Recent reports have
shown that the process of mouse oocyte development can be recapitu-
lated in vitro starting from primordial germ cells and induced pluripotent
stem cells (Hikabe et al., 2016; Morohaku et al., 2016) but little is known
about the potential for human IVG oocytes.
We previously developed a two-step culture system where human
primordial follicle activation and growth to the secondary/multi-laminar
stage was achieved within cortical pieces (Telfer et al., 2008). Development
of follicles to the antral stage could be obtained when growing follicles
were removed from the cortex and cultured individually in the pres-
ence of activin (Telfer et al., 2008). Other groups have demonstrated
the developmental potential of growing isolated human multi-laminar
follicles in vitro (Xu et al., 2009) and have confirmed that they can
develop to the stage where they resume meiosis and reach Metaphase II
(Xiao et al., 2015).
The aim of this study was to determine whether complete human
oocyte growth from immature primordial/unilaminar follicles could be
achieved in vitro by extending our two-step culture system (Telfer
et al., 2008; Telfer and McLaughlin, 2012) to obtain antral follicles and
mature oocytes. Herein we describe the addition of a third step to our
culture system and demonstrate the acquisition and expression of mei-
otic competence of a subset of IVG human oocytes as evidenced by
the progression to Metaphase II after a total of 20 days in culture start-
ing from primordial/unilaminar follicles.
Materials and Methods
Ovarian cortical tissue
Fresh ovarian cortical biopsies (n = 10) of approximate size 5 mm × 4 mm
(with variable thickness) were obtained with informed consent from women
undergoing elective caesarean section (mean age: 30.7 ± 1.7; range: 25–39
years). Approval of this study was given by the local ethics committee (ref
LREC 10/S1101/2). Ovarian tissue was transported to the laboratory in pre-
warmed dissection medium [Leibovitz medium (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK)
supplemented with sodium pyruvate (2 mM), glutamine (2 mM) (both
Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK), HSA (3 mg/ml), penicillin G (75 μg/ml) and
streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Sigma Chemicals, Poole, Dorset UK)].
Tissue preparation and fragment culture
(Step 1)
On arrival to the laboratory the tissue was transferred into fresh dissection
medium, examined under light microscopy and any damaged, haemorrhagic
or excess stromal tissue was excised allowing the pieces to flatten and afford-
ing better microscopic visualization. The flattened tissue pieces were dis-
sected into fragments of ~1 × 1 × 0.5 mm3, re-examined under light
microscopy and any visible follicles measured using an eyepiece micrometer.
Follicles with a mean diameter > 40 μm were excised from the tissue frag-
ments using fine needles, to ensure that the presumptive population of folli-
cles contained within the fragments was unilaminar, i.e. primordial,
transitional or primary. A total of 160 fragments were prepared and incu-
bated individually in 24-well cell culture plates (Corning B.V. Life Sciences
Europe, Amsterdam). Each well contained 300 μl of culture medium
[McCoy’s 5a medium with bicarbonate supplemented with HEPES (20 mM;
Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK), glutamine (3 mM; Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK),
HSA (0.1%), penicillin G (0.1 mg/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), transferrin
(2.5 μg/ml), selenium (4ng/ml), human insulin (10ng/ml) 1ng/ml recombin-
ant human FSH (rhFSH) and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) (all obtained from
Sigma Chemicals, Poole, Dorset, UK, unless otherwise stated)]. Fragments
were cultured for 8 days at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2 with half the
media being removed and replaced every second day according to our previ-
ously published system (Telfer et al., 2008; McLaughlin et al., 2011, 2014;
Anderson et al., 2014).
At least two cortical fragments were taken from each biopsy at the start
and end of the culture period (n = 24) to obtain an indication of the popu-
lation of follicles present at each time. Fragments were fixed in Bouin’s fluid
and processed for histological evaluation as Days 0 and 8 controls follow-
ing a previously published protocol (Telfer et al., 2008). Every histological
section of each tissue fragment was examined under light microscopy and
follicles were categorized according to their stage of development as previ-
ously described (Telfer et al., 2008; McLaughlin et al., 2014).
Follicle isolation and culture (Step 2)
During Step 1 growing follicles were observed on the surface of the cortical
fragments and within 8 days of culture visible follicles of 100–150 μm in
diameter were observed. These growing follicles were mechanically dis-
sected with 25 gauge needles and those with an intact basement mem-
brane were selected for further culture. Secondary follicles dissected from
the cortical fragments were measured using an eyepiece micrometer and
placed individually into 96-well V-bottomed culture plates (Corning Costar
Europe, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands) in 150 μl of culture medium
supplemented with 100ng/ml of human recombinant Activin A and 1ng/ml
rhFSH. Follicles were cultured individually for a further 8 days at 37oC in
humidified air with 5% CO2. Half the culture medium was replaced at 2-day
intervals and at this time follicle diameter measurements were taken using a
dissecting microscope with a crossed micrometer. Upon microscopic evalu-
ation any damaged or degenerate follicles were excluded.
Isolation and culture of oocyte–granulosa cell
complexes (Step 3)
Individual follicles were monitored and at the end of 8 days in Step 2, follicles
with antral cavities were observed. COCs were retrieved from intact healthy
cultured follicles by gentle pressure. The aim of this stage was to obtain
oocytes that were at least a 100 μm in diameter for IVM. Complexes with
complete cumulus and adherent mural granulosa cells were selected and cul-
tured in the presence of 100ng/ml of Activin-A and 1ng/ml of rhFSH on
136

 track-etched nucleopore membranes (Millipore) in 4-well culture plates with
a maximum of six complexes per membrane. Complexes were cultured and
the oocyte diameter monitored for a further 4 days (Step 3). If oocytes had
not reached 100 μm by Day 4 they were cultured for an additional 2 days. At
the end of Step 3 (total of 20 days in vitro), complexes containing oocytes
>100 μm in diameter were selected for IVM.
IVM (Step 4)
Isolated complexes containing oocytes with a diameter >100 µm were
placed in SAGE IVM medium (Cooper Surgical, Trumbull, Connecticut,
USA) containing 75 mIU/ml of FSH and 75 mIU/ml of LH in humidified air
and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Complexes were examined after 24 h for the pres-
ence of a polar body and cumulus cell expansion. A selection of complexes
with and without polar bodies were taken for confocal analysis.
Confocal analysis of oocytes
COCs were fixed in a microtubule stabilizing buffer supplemented with
3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM taxol, 0.01%
(w/v) aprotinin, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 50% (v/v) deuterium oxide as
described previously (Wickramasinghe and Albertini, 1992).
Samples were stored at 4°C in a PBS blocking solution containing 1%
(w/v) BSA, 0.2% (w/v) powdered milk, 2% (v/v) normal goat serum,
0.1 M glycine, 0.2% (w/v) sodium azide and 0.01% Triton X-100 until the
time of specimen processing. The detection of microtubules, microfila-
ments and chromatin by was accomplished using a triple-stain strategy as
follows. Oocytes were first incubated for 4 h at 37oC in a mixture of mouse
monoclonal anti-tubulins (alpha and beta, Invitrogen, Sigma) at a final dilution
of 1:500. Following several washes in blocking solution, samples were incu-
bated in 1:400 dilution of Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Invitrogen)
and rhodamine-phalloidin (1:200, Invitrogen) for 3 h at 37°C. Samples were
mounted in a glycerol-based medium containing Hoechst 33258 (1 ng/ml) on
1 mm posts of Vaseline to prevent compression of the oocytes and surround-
ing cumulus cells (Barrett and Albertini, 2010).
A Zeiss LSM Pascal system mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert II was used for
confocal microscopy and all image collection was done with a 1.2 n.a. ×40
water immersion objective with excitation lines at 405 nm (Diode, for
Hoechst), at 488 nm (Argon laser for anti-tubulin) and 548 nm (HeNe for
rhodamine phalloidin).
Statistical analysis
The proportions of the developmental stages observed by histological analysis
pre and post culture were compared using chi-squared analysis. Mean follicle
diameter measurements during stage 2 of culture and mean oocyte diameters
during stage 3 were compared using a two sample t-test. P values of <0.05
were considered significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using
EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft).
Results
Ovarian cortical tissue being prepared for culture contained no visible
growing follicles (Fig. 1A) and this was confirmed by examining histo-
logical sections (Fig. 1B). Histological analysis showed the distribution of
follicle stages to be 97.1% unilaminar (primordial or primary) at the start
of culture. Counts of 385 follicles from histological sections at Day 0
showed 80.5% primordial, 16.6% primary and 2.9% secondary. Counts
of 355 follicles after 8 days of culture showed 43.1% primordial, 46.1%
primary and 10.8% secondary. Therefore, an increased (P < 0.05) per-
centage of growing follicles (primary and secondary) and a corresponding
decrease (P < 0.01) in the percentage of non-growing follicles was
observed in cultured tissue compared to freshly fixed tissue (Day 0).
Within 8 days of culture in serum free medium containing a low
dose of FSH, growing follicles were observed on the surface of the cul-
tured pieces (Fig. 1C), histological analysis of fragments cultured for
8 days showed the presence of growing multi-laminar follicles (Fig. 1D
and g). Multi-laminar follicles can be observed under the dissecting
microscope (Fig. 1E) and isolated by micro-dissection with attached
stromal cells for individual culture in Step 2 (Fig. 1F).
A total of 87 follicles with a mean diameter of 121 ± 2.5 μm (range:
100–150 μm) were dissected from the cultured fragments after 8 days
and placed in Step 2 of the culture system. During the first 4 days of
culture isolated follicles increased (P < 0.005) in size (Fig. 2). A further
increase (P < 0.005) in size was observed between Days 4 and 6 dur-
ing Step 2 of culture (Fig. 2) (total of 14 days in vitro). The mean follicle
diameter increased to 248 ± 4.5 μm (range: 198–314 μm; Fig. 2) after
6 days in Step 2. Follicles were kept in Step 2 of culture for 8 days but
no increase in diameter was observed between 6 and 8 days (Fig. 2).
At the end of Step 2, 54 out of 87 follicles (62%) were identified as being
intact and having reached the early-mid antral stage (Fig. 1H and I). From
the 54 antral follicles, 48 oocyte granulosa cell complexes (Fig. 1J) were
isolated for further culture on membranes (Step 3; Fig. 3). The mean
oocyte diameter of complexes selected for further growth was 91.4 ±
1.5 μm (range: 82.6–99 μm; Fig. 4).
From the 48 oocyte–granulosa cell complexes grown on mem-
branes (Step 3; Fig. 3) 32 remained intact and showed significant
oocyte growth after 2 and 4 days on membranes (P < 0.005) (Fig. 4).
Complexes that had not reached 100 μm in diameter after 4 days in
Step 3 did not increase in size after 6 days in Step 3.
The results show that 36% of follicles isolated after Step 1 went on
to form antral cavities and produce oocytes of diameter >100 µm
which could be placed in maturation medium to determine their mei-
otic potential (Fig. 3).
Of 32 complexes isolated for IVM, 9 emitted polar bodies after 24 h
in maturation media (Figs 3 and 5A). This result showed that complete
oocyte growth could occur from primordial/unilaminar stages to antral
stages, with 36.7% of isolated follicles producing fully grown oocytes
after a total of 21 days in culture, and with 10% of the isolated follicles
producing complexes that had polar bodies after IVM (Fig. 5A–D). In all
cases the polar bodies were larger than that observed from in vivo grown
oocytes, with the ratio between oocyte size to polar body size ranging
from 4:1 to 3:1 (Fig. 5A–D). Whilst cumulus expansion did occur the
degree of expansion was less than that reported from in vivo grown
oocytes.
Confocal analysis showed the co-existence of a Metaphase II spindle
and polar body confirming that these IVG oocytes had progressed
through meiosis establishing the acquisition of meiotic competence for
at least a fraction of the oocytes subjected to IVM (Fig. 5A–E). The spin-
dles observed ranged from those with tapered poles (Fig. 5B and E) to
that with more typical broad spindle poles (Fig. 5D).
Oocytes lacking a polar body after IVM were shown to be arrested
at GV stage (Fig. 6A) or Metaphase-I, the latter showing chromosomes
associated with aberrant spindles (Fig. 6B and C).
Discussion
The main objective of this study was to ascertain the ability of an in vitro
system to support growth of immature human oocytes within the ovarian
cortex to achieve a state of differentiation approaching that of a meiotic-
ally competent ovum. We describe here the successful development of a
137

 small number of human oocytes capable of acquiring and expressing a
level of development approaching that of an ovulated ovum. The main
criteria consistent with achieving our goals include: (i) the progressive
growth of oocytes from primordial to early antral stage with maintenance
of somatic cell support; (ii) cytological features of the nucleus (GV) and
cytoplasm consistent with the differentiation of human oocytes within the
intact ovary; and (iii) the acquisition of meiotic competence over the dur-
ation of the multi-step in vitro assay that resulted in ~30% of oocytes that
survived the culture system emitting a polar body and reaching the
Metaphase II stage of meiosis. Together, these results provide initial valid-
ation for a multi-step culture model capable of supporting the ex vivo
propagation of human oocytes. This model system has the potential to
advance our understanding of oogenesis in humans especially in relation
to the treatment of infertility and regenerative medicine but clearly
requires to be optimized.
The idea of obtaining viable oocytes by growing immature oocytes
in vitro has been the subject of a great deal of research for almost
30 years (Eppig and Telfer, 1993). Complete growth in vitro from the
most immature oocytes (primordial stages) with subsequent IVF and
production of live young has only been achieved in mouse (Eppig and
O’Brien, 1996; O’Brien et al., 2003). Early work on that two-step
culture system resulted in only one live offspring being obtained, and
that mouse had many abnormalities as an adult (Eppig and O’Brien,
1996). Following improvements in the technique and after alterations
to the culture medium several mouse embryos and offspring have
been obtained using oocytes that have been IVG then combined with
IVM and IVF (O’Brien et al., 2003). More recently, in vitro systems that
support the complete development of mouse oocytes starting from
induced pluripotent stem cells (Hikabe et al., 2016) and from primor-
dial germ cells (Morohaku et al., 2016) have been reported and these
systems have resulted in competent oocytes that produce embryos
and live young.
Whilst there have been advances in culturing follicles and oocytes
from humans, non-human primates and domestic species (McLaughlin
and Telfer, 2010; Smitz et al., 2010; Hirao et al., 2013; Telfer and
Zelinski, 2013; Xiao et al., 2015) there is no single system that has
been fully optimized to support the complete in vitro growth and mat-
uration of human follicles and oocytes from the earliest stages. There
is a consensus that to achieve complete in vitro growth a dynamic cul-
ture system is required to support the three main transition steps
(Smitz et al., 2010; Telfer and McLaughlin, 2012; Telfer and Zelinski,
2013). These are (i) activation of primordial follicles (Hovatta et al.,

 1999; Telfer et al., 2008; Anderson et al., 2014; McLaughlin et al.,
2014), (ii) isolation and culture of growing follicles to achieve oocyte
growth and development (Hovatta et al., 1999; Telfer et al., 2008; Xu
et al., 2009; Anderson et al., 2014; McLaughlin et al., 2014; Xiao et al.,
2015), and (iii) removal from the follicle environment and maturation
of oocyte cumulus complexes (Cavilla et al., 2008; Chian et al., 2013).
The multi-step culture system described here integrates multiple
approaches resulting in the propagation of functional human oocytes
based on assessment of meiotic competence acquisition.
Previous studies have cultured human multi-laminar follicles encapsu-
lated in alginate hydrogels to support follicle growth in vitro (Xu et al.,
2009; Xiao et al., 2015). Alginate encapsulation mimics the extracellular
matrix in terms of its ability to facilitate molecular exchange between the
follicle and the culture medium. Isolated secondary human follicles grown
in this way become steroidogenically active and complete oocyte growth
in 30 days (Xu et al., 2009) and have been shown to be capable of mei-
otic maturation (Xiao et al., 2015).
In the present multi-step culture system, quiescent follicles activated
to grow within cultured fragments of cortex and mechanically isolated
as secondary follicles became steroidogenic and exhibited signs of fol-
licle differentiation after a total of 16 days in vitro (Telfer et al., 2008).
Once follicles reach the antral stage a further period of growth of the
isolated oocyte–granulosa cell complex is required before maturation
can take place (McLaughlin and Telfer, 2010). To achieve this final
growth phase the oocyte somatic cell unit is removed from the antral
follicle: this is technically demanding but 48 from 54 IVG follicles were
successfully isolated. In developing these complexes further, maintain-
ing contact between the oocyte and somatic cells is key to supporting
oocyte development (Li and Albertini, 2013). Maintenance of oocyte
somatic cell interactions and cytoskeleton stability in vitro is a challenge
in ex vivo systems. The use of membranes for the final stages of oocyte
development has been shown to be successful in the rodent model
(Eppig and O’Brien, 1996) and appears to support human oocyte
development in this system. We have previously demonstrated that
the correct balance of activin and FSH in vitro imparts a stabilizing influ-
ence on oocyte–somatic cell connections in bovine IVG follicles
(McLaughlin et al., 2010) and this knowledge has informed the culture
system described here. While the pattern of cell contacts was not fol-
lowed throughout the various steps employed in this study, it was
noted by confocal microscopy that few trans-zonal projections were
present in cumulus oocyte complexes following IVM. A lingering

Multi-laminar follicles were isolated by micro-dissection from cultured
ovarian cortex after 8 days in vitro and placed in individual v shaped
culture wells. Follicle diameters were measured at 2-day intervals dur-
ing an 8-day culture period. After 4 days in Step 2 follicles were larger
(*P < 0.005) than at the start and increased in size up to 6 days (**P <
0.005) before plateauing after 8 days in Step 2.

from fragments to be placed into Step 2 (black bar). During Step 2
54 follicles reached the antral stage (62%) (diagonal striped bar). From
54 follicles 48 oocyte–cumulus cell complexes were retrieved and
placed on membranes for Step 3 (55%). The 32 complexes contained
oocytes >100 µm (36%) at the end of Step 3 (hatched bar). The 32
complexes were placed in maturation medium and nine showed polar
bodies after 24 h (white bar). This represents 10.3% of in vitro grown
follicles isolated resulted in fully grown oocytes with some level of
meiotic competence.

showed a significant (*) increase in diameter after 4 and 6 days (P <

ing meiotic competence in the IVM step. Oocytes that did not reach
100 µm within 4 days did not show significant growth if left for 6 days.

 question has been whether the growth rate observed in this system
represents acceleration of growth or is the consequence of removing
in vivo inhibitory forces. While it appears that development of a
significant proportion of oocytes occurs at a faster rate relative to
in vivo estimates our system gives some insight into the process of
oogenesis in humans that will require further experimentation.

dense cytoplasmic microtubule network (green) indicative of retention in an interphase G2 state of the cell cycle. In (B), an oocyte arrested at MI has
undergone germinal vesicle breakdown and chromosomes (blue) are located around a small monopolar meiotic spindle; note the displacement of the
spindle remnant from the oocyte cortex and appearance of f-actin foci in the vicinity of the spindle (C, 3.3× zoom of B).

 The final goal of an in vitro system is to produce oocytes capable of
fertilization and developmental competence. The IVG human oocytes
need to be matured in vitro and in this study a total of 32 complexes
were selected for IVM with 9 showing emission of a polar body after
24 h in IVM medium. For those oocytes examined by confocal micros-
copy, it was noted that abnormally large polar bodies were present in
oocytes demonstrating Metaphase II spindles. Previous studies on
mouse oocytes have shown that both the proximity of the spindle to
the oocyte cortex and the inter-chromosomal
spacing within
Metaphase II spindles will influence polar body size (Barrett and
Albertini, 2010). Wider spacing of chromosomes and loss of spindle
contact with the oocyte cortex lead to extrusion of polar bodies of
unusually large sizes compared to controls (Coticchio et al., 2013).
The present observations clearly warrant closer examination of these
relationships within IVG human oocytes and the likely consequences
such abnormalities would have on chromosome balance in mature
oocytes.
In this study a relatively low number of oocytes reached Metaphase
II. All tissue came from women within a similar age range and at the
end of pregnancy thus we are unable to correlate any particular char-
acteristics with culture success. Each stage of the culture system
requires optimization and even when relatively mature GV oocytes are
used clinically it is widely accepted that the rate of maturation in vitro is
still well below that of oocytes harvested from stimulated ovaries,
indicating that the protocols for IVM are sub-optimal. It may also be
that many of the harvested oocytes are intrinsically deficient in their
ability to reinitiate and progress through meiosis (Nogueira et al.,
2012). The results presented here provide proof of concept in devel-
oping a complete in vitro growth system to support human oocyte
development but highlight the need to optimize each of the stages of
development and to gain further understanding of how the culture sys-
tem affects development, particularly the epigenetic status of any
embryos formed from IVG oocytes (Anckaert et al., 2013).
The most significant clinical application of this work is in Fertility
Preservation. Given the widespread adoption of ovarian tissue cryo-
preservation for cancer patients (Anderson et al., 2017), our results
make plausible the utilization of in vitro generated mature human
oocytes for embryo production and thus an alternative to autologous
transplantation particularly where there is a threat of tumour reintro-
duction as a result of grafting. Whether the multi-step model will be
useful for other applications such as screening for potentially gonado-
toxic therapies or environmental toxins is not yet known but these are
becoming realistic prospects for future applications. Apart from the
clinical implications of this work, the system described here provides
direct access to the process of human oogenesis in an experimentally
tractable paradigm for future research.
