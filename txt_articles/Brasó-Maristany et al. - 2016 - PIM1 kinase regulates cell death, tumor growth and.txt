 dependent on PIM1 for proliferation and protection from apoptosis. PIM1 knockdown reduced 
expression of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and dynamic BH3 profiling analysis revealed that 
PIM1 prevents mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. In TNBC tumors and their 
cellular models, PIM1 expression was associated with several transcriptional signatures involving 
the transcription factor MYC, and PIM1 depletion in TNBC cell lines decreased, in a MYC-
dependent manner, cell population growth and expression of the MYC target gene MCL1. 
Treatment with the pan–PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 impaired the growth of both cell line and 
patient-derived xenografts and sensitized them to standard-of-care chemotherapy This work 
identifies PIM1 as a malignant-cell-selective target in TNBC and the potential use of PIM1 
inhibitors for sensitizing TNBC to chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death.
TNBC cells are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) 
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). No targeted therapy is currently 
available for TNBC, and the mainstay of therapy remains chemotherapy, to which many 
patients are highly resistant. Identification of novel drug targets, especially those that might 
affect chemotherapy resistance, is an important unmet medical need1. Chemotherapy-
resistant TNBCs are associated with very poor prognosis2,3 and often display co-
amplification and overexpression of the MYC oncogene4 (which encodes c-MYC) and its 
transcriptional target MCL1 (ref. 5), which encodes an anti-apoptotic factor.
Previous studies identified a recurrent amplification in TNBC cells in the genomic region 
6p21-p25 (refs. 6–8), which includes PIM1. PIM1, a member of the PIM kinase family, has 
been implicated in the control of cancer cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis9, 
particularly in prostate cancer and leukemia10,11. Pim1-null mice develop normally and are 
fertile12, indicating that PIM1 is not essential for physiologic tissue homeostasis and 
suggesting that side effects would be manageable if PIM1 was targeted specifically for 
therapy13. Indeed, a number of specific and potent PIM inhibitors have been 
developed13,14. Yet, to optimize drug positioning it is critical to understand the tumor types 
and specific molecular frameworks in which PIM1’s function is essential.
This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that PIM1 provides a proliferation 
advantage to TNBC cells and raises the threshold for cell death, such that TNBC cells are 
addicted to PIM1 for protection from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We 
identified cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin TNBC’s cellular addiction to 
PIM1, including a functional link between PIM1 and c-MYC and the effects of PIM1 on 
expression of the anti- apoptotic proteins MCL1 and BCL2, as well as on the expression of 
known regulators of malignant phenotypes in TNBC, such as the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 
(ref. 15) (encoded by PTPN11) and EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2)16,17. Accordingly, the pan–
PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 (ref. 11) selectively sensitized PIM1-addicted TNBC cell 
models and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to standard-of-care chemotherapy.

 Results
Copy number-dependent PIM1 gene expression in TNBC
PIM1 is located on chromosome 6p21-p25, a recurrent amplicon in TNBC6–8. We 
investigated whether PIM1’s copy number status and expression level are increased in 
TNBC by interrogating three independent published data sets: the Guy’s Hospital TNBC-
enriched cohort18,19, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Breast cohort20 and the 
METABRIC21 cohort. PIM1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in TNBCs than in non-
TNBCs (Fig. 1a). PAM50 classification22 of these data sets demonstrated increased PIM1 
expression levels in the basal-like molecular subtype (Supplementary Fig. 1a). PIM1 gene 
expression showed significant correlation with its copy number in TNBC cells in the Guy’s 
Hospital and TCGA cohorts (Fig. 1b), and in basal-like tumors in the METABRIC and 
TCGA data sets (Supplementary Fig. 1b). A considerable amount of gene expression 
variability was observed across the data sets. Nevertheless, 75–85% of basal-like breast 
cancers showed PIM1 expression levels that are significantly higher than the top quartile for 
PIM1 expression levels in breast cancers of the non-TNBC HER2-enriched, luminal A and 
luminal B molecular subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Notably, such upregulation is 
underpinned by copy number gains, including amplifications, in a substantial proportion of 
TNBCs. The poor performance of PIM1-specific antibodies for use in 
immunohistochemistry applications precluded analysis of protein abundance in a large 
tumor series. However, both PIM1 mRNA (Fig. 1c) and PIM1 protein levels (Fig. 1d,e) were 
increased in cellular models of TNBC as compared to those in models of non-TNBC.
Selective PIM1 kinase addiction in cellular models of malignant breast cancer
To investigate PIM1’s specific role in cells derived from malignant breast cancers, we used a 
TNBC-enriched cell line panel23,24 and three normal breast epithelial cell models. We 
assessed the effect of PIM1 knockdown on cell population growth by using a fluorescent- 
dye-based cell viability assay and multiple siRNAs and shRNAs. The specificity of the 
siRNAs and shRNAs for PIM1 knockdown versus PIM2 and PIM3 knockdown was 
validated by standard qRT–PCR (Supplementary Fig. 2).
We used two distinct PIM1-specific shRNAs and a nontargeting (NT) control and found that 
four of five TNBC cell lines were sensitive to PIM1 knockdown, in contrast to luminal 
BT474 and nonmalignant HMEC cells (Fig. 2a). Comparable results were obtained using 
Hoechst-33342 staining to measure cell growth (Supplementary Fig. 3), demonstrating that 
the reduction in metabolic activity that was measured by the fluorescent-dye-based assay 
reflected a reduction in total cell number.
Next we tested a broader range of breast cancer and nonmalignant models by using transient 
transfection of siRNAs targeting PIM1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). PIM1 silencing impaired 
the growth of six of seven TNBC cell lines; the exception was SUM159, a cell line that 
expresses low levels of PIM1. Two of four non-TNBC models showed a degree of PIM1 
dependency under these conditions. Of note, none of the nonmalignant cell models were 
sensitive to PIM1 knockdown. There was a marked difference in response to PIM1

 knockdown between malignant and nonmalignant cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b), consistent 
with previous findings that Pim1-knockout mice have a normal phenotype12.
To exclude off-target effects, we performed rescue-of-function experiments by expressing a 
shRNA- and siRNA-resistant PIM1 construct that encodes a V5-tagged variant of PIM1 
(hereafter referred to as V5–PIM1R) in SUM149 cells that were transduced with a shRNA 
targeting endogenous PIM1. PIM1 knockdown reduced cell population growth in β-
galactosidase (LacZ)-expressing control cells but was ineffective in V5–PIM1R-expressing 
cells (Fig. 2b). Moreover, we generated cell lines that stably expressed a doxycycline-
inducible shRNA- and siRNA-resistant PIM1 construct that encoded a hemaglutinin (HA)-
tagged wild-type PIM1 (PIM1WT) or HA-tagged kinase-dead PIM1 mutant (PIM1K67M). 
Expression of PIM1WT but not PIM1K67M rescued the effect of PIM1 knockdown in 
SUM149 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c), indicating that the cell growth defect caused by 
PIM1 knockdown was specific to PIM1 and that the ability of PIM1 to promote cell growth 
depends on the activity of its kinase domain.
Next we investigated the effects of PIM1 silencing on TNBC clonogenic survival capacity. 
PIM1 knockdown reduced colony formation of TNBC cell lines, with the exception of the 
SUM159 cells, which express low levels of PIM1 (Fig. 2c). This result indicates a 
requirement of PIM1 for cell survival and/or proliferation across multiple cell division 
events. We did not observe effects of PIM2 or PIM3 silencing on cell population growth in 
the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM149 or SUM159 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
PIM1 prevents activation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cells
Time-course experiments in MDA-MB-231 cells showed that, following siRNA-mediated 
PIM1 knockdown, an increase in caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity (a marker for early 
apoptosis induction; hereafter referred to as caspase-3/7 activity) preceded the impairment of 
cell population growth (Fig. 3a,b). This result suggested that PIM1’s effect on TNBC growth 
is at least in part due to protection from apoptosis. PIM1 knockdown, using multiple RNA 
interference (RNAi) methods, led to increased caspase 3/7 activity in only the TNBC cell 
lines in which we had documented a population growth defect (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).
Next we examined the effect of PIM1 knockdown on the expression of the anti-apoptotic 
protein BCL2 in TNBC cells, as BCL2 is known to be under the control of PIM1 in other 
contexts25,26. PIM1 knockdown reduced the expression of BCL2 in MDA-MB-231 and 
SUM149 cells but did not affect BCL2 expression in the nonresponsive SUM159 and BT474 
cell lines (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 7), implicating BCL2 regulation as a potential 
mechanism by which PIM1 protects TNBC cells from apoptosis. To determine whether 
PIM1’s effect on caspase activation is mediated through BCL2, we silenced PIM1 in BCL2-
overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells and found that BCL2 expression led to suppression of 
PIM1 knockdown-induced caspase 3/7 activation (Fig. 3d).
BCL2 inhibits apoptosis that arises from the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway27. We 
performed dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), a recently developed methodology to measure 
changes in pro-apoptotic signaling at mitochondria28, to test the effect of PIM1 on the 
threshold at which increasing concentrations of a fragment of the pro-apoptotic protein

 BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BCL2L11; also known as BIM) promotes 
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 8). At a BIM peptide concentration of 0.3 μM, PIM1 
knockdown led to a reduction of this threshold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells but not 
in SUM159 cells. Ectopic expression of BCL2 in MDA-MB-231 cells fully rescued the 
effects of PIM1 knockdown on mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (Fig. 3e), 
suggesting that PIM1 prevents mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC at least in part by 
modulation of BCL2.
Despite the ability of BCL2 overexpression to fully rescue the effect of PIM1 knockdown on 
enhancing caspase activation, BCL2 overexpression only partially rescued the cell growth 
defect caused by PIM1 knockdown (Fig. 3f). This result suggests that protection from the 
mitochondrial-apoptotic pathway is not the only mechanism by which PIM1 promotes cell 
growth.
PIM1 acts through the MYC-activation pathway
PIM1 has been found to synergize with the MYC oncogene to drive the progression of 
prostate cancer and leukemia10,29. Transcriptional activation by c-MYC relies on PIM1-
dependent phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 in HEK293 cells and transformed rat 
fibroblasts30, and PIM1-dependent phosphorylation of c-MYC at Ser62 causes oncogenic 
transformation in prostate cancer10. Because MYC is known to be amplified and 
overexpressed in aggressive chemotherapy-resistant TNBC4, we tested the effects of PIM1 
on histone H3 and c-MYC in TNBC cells and the relationship of these effects to the PIM1-
addiction status of the cells. PIM1 knockdown led to decreased levels of phosphorylated 
histone H3 at Ser10 and phosphorylated c- MYC at Ser62, as well as a reduction of total 
protein levels of c-MYC and its transcriptional target5 MCL1, in MDA-MB-231 and 
SUM149 cells (PIM1-knockdown sensitive) but not in SUM159 and BT474 cells (PIM1-
knockdown insensitive) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a). However, SUM159 cells were 
sensitive to MYC knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the MYC activation 
pathway is likely to be controlled by other mechanisms31,32 in this cell line.
MCL1 mRNA levels were also reduced after PIM1 knockdown (Fig. 4b), suggesting a 
mechanism in which PIM1 regulates MYC-driven MCL1 transcription. However, MYC 
mRNA levels were not affected after PIM1 knockdown, indicating that PIM1 regulates 
MYC at the protein level (Fig. 4b). To further study the involvement of MYC, we engineered 
TNBC cell lines in which c-myc expression is doxycycline inducible33. c-myc expression 
abolished the effects of PIM1 knockdown on cell population growth (Fig. 4c), indicating that 
PIM1 functions through c-MYC and its downstream effectors. Moreover, c-myc 
overexpression rescued the effects of PIM1 knockdown on MCL1 expression (Fig. 4c). 
Taken together, these data indicate that PIM1 has direct effects on c-MYC-driven 
transcription.
Next we investigated whether PIM1 and MYC gene expression correlate with each other in 
the Guy’s Hospital18,19, TCGA Breast20 and METABRIC21 cohorts. Because we had 
found a moderate positive correlation (Supplementary Fig. 9c), we sought evidence of 
functional consequences of c-MYC-driven transcription. Thirty-four c-MYC-dependent 
transcriptional signatures have been reported (Supplementary Table 1). Among the first of

 these was that by Chandriani et al.34, which was obtained from primary human fibroblasts 
overexpressing c-MYC and found to be associated with basal-like breast cancer34,35. This 
signature was upregulated in TNBC tumors and cellular models (Supplementary Fig. 9d). 
Next we determined the activation score of all 34 gene signatures across the three cohorts 
and the breast cancer cell line data set23, using a weighted average mean36. The activation 
scores were then correlated to PIM1 expression. We found a modest but significant 
correlation for eight of the MYC-dependent transcriptional signatures in all four data sets 
(Supplementary Table 1). The correlation between Chandriani’s c-MYC activation signature 
and PIM1 expression in the four data sets is depicted in Figure 4d.
We then asked whether PIM1 has a direct role in driving expression of the genes in the 
Chandriani c-MYC gene signature, the activation score of which was associated with PIM1 
upregulation in basal-like breast cancer (Fig. 4d). We performed NanoString nCounter 
PanCancer Pathways code set gene expression analysis following PIM1 knockdown using 
multiple RNAi methods. The reduction in PIM1 mRNA levels after PIM1 silencing was 
confirmed for each cell line (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Of the 24 genes in the Chandriani 
signature whose expression is dependent on c-MYC and could be interrogated in the code 
set, 11 were downregulated by PIM1 knockdown in the PIM1-knockdown-sensitive cell 
lines (Supplementary Fig. 9f and Supplementary Table 2). In the PIM1-knockdown-
insensitive SUM159 cell line, in which PIM1 knockdown was not observed to affect the 
levels of c-MYC protein, c-MYC phosphorylation at Ser62 or histone H3 phosphorylation at 
Ser10 (Fig. 4a), only five of the genes were downregulated. We suggest that PIM1 regulation 
of MYC- dependent transcription in TNBC will only partially overlap with that seen in the 
fibroblast model system, which may explain why we found that only a subset of the c-MYC 
target genes were downregulated after PIM1 knockdown.
Next we investigated the effect of PIM1 knockdown on a wider set of transcriptional 
responses in the PIM1-knockdown-sensitive MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cell lines, using 
the entire nCounter PanCancer Pathways gene expression code set (Fig. 4e). We sought 
significant changes in gene expression (0.5 < log2-fold changes < −0.5; P ≤ 0.05) and found 
significant effects on genes of the JAK–STAT signaling pathway, as well as on genes 
involved in apoptosis and the cell cycle, consistent with known functions of PIM1 in other 
systems9 (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 3). PIM1 knockdown led to increased 
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B; which encodes the cell cycle 
inhibitor p27), which was previously shown to be regulated by PIM1 (ref. 37). Moreover, 
PIM1 knockdown led to decreased expression of PTPN11 (whose product, also known as 
SHP2, is known to be important for maintenance of tumor-initiating cells and clonogenic 
survival in TNBC)15 and of EPHA2 (which encodes a regulatory kinase for SHP2)38. These 
results were validated at the protein level (Fig. 4f) and suggest additional mechanisms by 
which PIM1 regulates malignant cell phenotypes in TNBC.
AZD1208 inhibits in vitro and in vivo growth of TNBC models and enhances 
chemosensitivity
AZD1208 is a highly selective inhibitor of all three PIM kinases11. To examine the potential 
of using PIM inhibitors to target PIM1-dependent TNBCs, we treated TNBC cell lines and

 the normal breast epithelial cell line MTSV1.7 with AZD1208 in colony-formation assays. 
Consistent with the RNAi results, MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells were sensitive to PIM 
kinase inhibition, in contrast to SUM159 and MTSV1.7 cells (Fig. 5a,b). AZD1208 
treatment also substantially reduced anchorage-independent growth of TNBC cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Moreover, consistent with the effects of PIM1-specific RNAi 
treatment, AZD1208 treatment reduced MCL1 and BCL2 protein levels and reduced the 
levels of phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser10 and phosphorylated c-MYC at Ser62 (Fig. 5c).
Next we treated mice bearing MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cell line xenografts with 
AZD1208. This treatment substantially impaired tumor growth (Fig. 5d,e) and induced an 
increase in the percentage of p27-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 11), consistent with the 
gene expression analysis and with the known role of PIM1 in cell cycle progression through 
p27 regulation37.
Consistent with the effects of PIM1 knockdown and the failure of kinase-dead PIM1 to 
rescue the knockdown-dependent phenotypes, AZD1208 treatment of MDA-MB-231 and 
SUM149 cells (but not of SUM159 cells) led to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization 
at a BIM peptide dose of 0.3 μM, as assessed by DBP (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 12). 
Notably, BCL2 overexpression rescued this effect of PIM kinase inhibition.
Induction of apoptosis is a major contributor to the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy, 
which remains the mainstay of TNBC treatment despite limited efficacy in metastatic 
disease39. Treatment of TNBC cells with the standard advanced TNBC chemotherapy 
agents eribulin and paclitaxel increased caspase 3/7 activity, an effect which was further 
increased by AZD1208 treatment in the PIM1- knockdown-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cell line 
but not in the PIM1- knockdown-insensitive SUM159 cell line (Fig. 5g). Moreover, BCL2 
overexpression prevented mitochondrial-membrane permeabilization that was induced by 
combined treatment with eribulin and AZD1208 (Supplementary Fig. 13).
We next investigated the therapeutic potential of combining PIM1 inhibition with the use of 
chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC cell lines. AZD1208 treatment sensitized MDA-MB-231 
and SUM149 cells, but not SUM159 or MTSV1.7 cells, to paclitaxel (Fig. 6a). AZD1208 
treatment also sensitized MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells, but not SUM159 cells, to 
eribulin (Fig. 6b). The effect of AZD1208 on the sensitivity of MTSV1.7 cells to eribulin 
treatment could not be tested because of the exquisite sensitivity of these cells to eribulin 
(data not shown). The efficacy of combination therapy in reducing long-term colony 
formation in PIM1-sensitive models is consistent with the observation that addition of 
AZD1208 to standard-of-care chemotherapy increased caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. 5g). Taken 
together, these findings suggest that the effect of combination therapy on colony formation is 
substantially mediated through induction of apoptosis.
We then tested the ability of PIM1 inhibition to sensitize TNBC xenografts and PDX models 
to chemotherapeutic treatment. We treated two TNBC cell line xenograft models (Fig. 6c,d) 
and two TNBC PDX models (Fig. 6e,f) (which display high levels of PIM1; Supplementary 
Fig. 14a) with eribulin and AZD1208. Eribulin treatment alone led to stabilization of 
disease, whereas the combination of eribulin and AZD1208 led to objective treatment

 responses in the xenografts (Fig. 6c–f and Supplementary Fig. 14b–g) and marked 
reductions in viable tumor cell density and an increase in fibrosis at the tumor implantation 
site (Fig. 6g–n), demonstrating the potential efficacy of combining PIM kinase inhibition 
with eribulin treatment. The PIM kinase inhibitor, despite its known activity against mouse 
PIM1 (ref. 40), did not have effects on animal weight (Supplementary Fig. 14h–k), distress 
or lethality (data not shown), when either given alone or in combination with chemotherapy, 
supporting the notion that PIM inhibition could be well tolerated in patients.
Discussion
Our data identify PIM1 kinase as a potential therapeutic target in TNBC. We demonstrate 
elevated expression of PIM1 and frequent copy number aberrations (CNAs) of gene in a 
high proportion of basal-like TNBC. By using complementary approaches of RNAi 
knockdown and a small-molecule kinase inhibitor, we demonstrated that PIM1 kinase 
activity is required for the survival of TNBC cells both in vitro and in vivo, especially when 
combined with the apoptotic stimulus of chemotherapy.
TNBC includes a number of biologically distinct entities17. Whereas genome-profiling 
studies of TNBC samples indicate a substantial diversity of driver mutations, most of which 
occur at low frequency, some mutations and gene CNAs are recurrent. For example, 
oncogenic MYC is frequently amplified or overexpressed, and it drives oncogenic pathway 
activation and tumorigenicity17,35. c-MYC is also associated with poor prognosis41 and 
chemotherapy resistance in TNBC4, but this protein is notoriously hard to target42. Our 
results demonstrate not only that most TNBC cell lines are addicted to PIM1 for survival and 
proliferation but also that PIM1 functions in part through its effects on c-MYC. Specifically, 
c-MYC overexpression abrogated the PIM1-knockdown cell growth phenotype; c-MYC-
dependent transcriptional signatures were associated with PIM1 expression in TNBCs; and 
PIM1 knockdown downregulated transcription of a subset of c-MYC target genes (including 
MCL1) and were associated with effects on phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and c-
MYC at Ser62, which are known to be required for c-MYC-driven transcriptional activation 
and oncogenic transformation10,30. Taken together, our data support PIM1 as a potential 
target in basal-like TNBCs, including in the c-MYC-driven group. Our data are also 
supported by an independent study by Horiuchi et al.43, which demonstrates that c-MYC 
overexpression generates a requirement of PIM1 function for cell growth in mammary 
epithelial cells and further indicates that PIM1 function is needed to support c-MYC-
dependent malignancy in TNBC cells.
MYC and MCL1 are co-amplified in residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
leading to the proposal that MCL1 amplification can lead to its overexpression and 
circumvent oncogene- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis4. Moreover, most basal-like 
TNBCs show a high level of dependence on MCL1 (ref. 44). We found that MCL1 
expression is increased after c-MYC overexpression in TNBC, consistent with work 
showing that c-MYC transcriptionally controls MCL1 expression in gastric cancer cells5 and 
that PIM1 regulates c- MYC transcriptional activity, including MCL1 expression levels. 
PIM1 phosphorylates the BCL2 partner protein BAD in leukemia cells11 and kidney COS-7 
cells25. Increased PIM1 expression in TNBC may overcome oncogene-induced and

 chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by increasing the threshold for mitochondrial-mediated 
apoptosis, which we suggest is due to the effects of PIM1 on BCL2 family members.
Similar to c-MYC, BCL2 and MCL1 are hard-to-target proteins27. Inhibitors of BCL2 
family members have frequently shown off-target effects, triggering cell death independently 
of on-target mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis27. Here we show that the kinase activity of 
PIM1 is specifically required for cell population growth and protection from apoptosis. 
Moreover, the pan–PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 could not only impair the clonogenicity 
of TNBC cells and the tumor growth of TNBC xenografts, but it also increased pro-
apoptotic effects, and in vitro cellular and in vivo TNBC model sensitivity, to approved 
chemotherapeutic agents that are used in early and metastatic TNBC. Because specific and 
potent PIM1 inhibitors are in late stages of development14, PIM1 may be a more feasible 
drug target than BCL2 family members for overcoming resistance to chemotherapy. The 
current development focus for PIM inhibitors is in hematological malignancy45, but our data 
suggest that these agents can additionally be repurposed to address the major unmet clinical 
need in chemotherapy-resistant TNBC.
Besides the cooperation between PIM1 and c-MYC, multiple mechanisms could contribute 
to the effects of PIM1 on TNBC cell survival and proliferation. Indeed, gene expression 
analysis revealed PIM1- mediated regulation of the JAK–STAT pathway and of genes 
involved in apoptosis and the cell cycle, consistent with previously described PIM1 
functions9. Specifically, we found that PIM1 knockdown upregulated expression of 
CDKN1B (which encodes p27) at both the mRNA and protein level, suggesting a 
mechanism by which PIM1 promotes cell cycle progression in TNBC. Our findings are 
consistent with those of Horiuchi et al.43, as well as with work showing that PIM1 
downregulates CDKN1B at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in other 
contexts37. In addition, PIM1 knockdown decreased expression of PTPN11 and EPHA2, 
genes of substantial relevance to breast cancer15,16 that were not previously connected to 
PIM1. PTPN11 encodes the phosphatase SHP2, which is involved in breast cancer 
progression and the maintenance of tumor-initiating cells15. EPHA2 can regulate SHP2 
function38 and, together with PIM1, belongs to a cluster of kinases associated with poor 
prognosis in ER-negative breast cancer16,17.
We found that PIM1 expression was essential for cell growth and apoptosis protection in 
most of the malignant breast cell line models, including some of non-TNBC origin, but was 
expendable in nonmalignant cell models, including mammary epithelial cells. Indeed, 
although upregulation of PIM1 expression, particularly as driven by copy number aberration, 
is associated specifically with basal-like breast cancers, which form a large subset of TNBC, 
PIM kinase function may be relevant to a broader range of high-grade breast cancer, 
including ER-positive forms of the disease, as recently proposed by Malinen et al.46. 
Notably, Pim1-null mice develop normally and are fertile12, indicating that PIM1 may not 
be essential for physiologic tissue homeostasis, consistent with early evidence of good 
tolerability of PIM1 inhibitors in early-phase clinical trials47,48.
Our study provides insights into the mechanisms by which PIM1 drives malignant 
phenotypes in TNBC and provides a rationale for clinical trials to investigate PIM1

 inhibition combined with chemotherapy as a therapeutic strategy in basal-like TNBC 
cancers with high levels of PIM1 gene expression. Moreover, PIM1 inhibition may provide a 
much needed means of targeting tumors that amplify and express MYC and the co-amplified 
gene MCL1 (ref. 5), which is also a transcriptional target of c-MYC, as well as other anti- 
apoptotic BCL2 family members that underpin resistance to breast cancer chemotherapy.
Online Methods
Cell lines
The breast cancer cell lines BT20, BT474, CAL51 HCC1143, HCC1428, HCC1954, 
HCC38, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and SKBR3, as well as nonmalignant 
MCF10A cells, were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Teddington, UK). 
The breast cancer cell lines SUM149 and SUM159 were from Asterand (Royston, UK). The 
nonmalignant HMEC and MTSV-1.7 cells were from Invitrogen (Life Technologies, Paisley, 
UK). HEK293T cells were also from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing pTIPZ-BCL2 
or an RFP control were kindly provided by P. Meier’s lab (The Institute of Cancer Research, 
London, UK). All cell lines were maintained as recommended by the suppliers. The cell 
lines were authenticated by short- tandem-repeat (STR) analysis and matched to the German 
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) database, and they were used for 
no more than 25 passages after STR typing. Mycoplasma tests were routinely performed 
using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Although MCF7 
and BT20 are included in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines, they were 
authenticated by STR, and we included them in our work as part of a comprehensive 
validation. Nevertheless, we focused on other cell lines for the main part of this study.
Gene expression and DNA copy number analysis
Gene expression data (PIM1, MYC and genes from 34 MYC transcriptional 
signatures34,49–60) were obtained from the Guy’s Hospital TNBC-enriched cohort18,19 
(177 primary breast tumors), the TCGA data set20 (526 primary breast tumors), the 
METABRIC data set21 (1,552 primary breast tumors) and a publicly available cell line data 
set23 (51 cell lines). Breast cancer specimens were classified as TNBC or non-TNBC based 
on immunohistochemistry (IHC), as per the guidelines of the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP)61, or into PAM50 
molecular subtypes22. To identify subtypes based on the molecular PAM50 classification, a 
nearest-centroid classification was performed, as described previously22, for the 
METABRIC and TCGA cohorts. For the Guy’s Hospital TNBC-enriched cohort, we adapted 
the PAM50 classification by performing random sampling19. Assignment of tumors to the 
molecular subtypes was based on their highest Spearman’s rank correlation. All statistical 
analyses were performed in the R environment, using several CRAN packages (http://cran.r-
project.org/). Absolute DNA copy number was obtained by using Affymetrix SNP6.0 
genome profiles and human genome build hg18 mapping for 196 cancers in our Guy’s 
Hospital cohort and for 940 primary breast carcinomas from the TCGA data set. Raw copy 
number information was processed for 1,501 breast cancers from the METABRIC data set. 
To account for normal tissue contamination and ploidy, allele-specific copy number profiling 
was performed with allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors (ASCAT)62. SNP 6.0

 copy number data were also extracted from our internal breast cancer cell line data set36 and 
analyzed using Tumor Aberration Prediction Suite (TAPS)63.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed directly in 1× Laemmli buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% 
glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue). Alternatively, cells were 
lysed by scraping them into a pH 7.4 lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, 
Gillingham, UK), 50 mmol/L Tris, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and a 
cocktail of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Cell 
lysates were passed five times through a 30-gauge needle before centrifugation and further 
processing of the samples. Snap-frozen tumor tissues were suspended in a pH 7.4 lysis 
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris base, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2% TritonX-100, 1% SDS, 10 
mmol/L EDTA, and a cocktail of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, 
Gillingham, UK). Tissue destruction was done with the bullet blender homogenizer (Next 
Advance, New York, USA). 20–100 μg of proteins were separated in reducing conditions 
(2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) by SDS–PAGE (SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and 
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) for further 
processing, following standard western blotting procedures.

Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)- and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene knockdown
Two pLKO.1-puro lentiviral MISSION shRNA constructs targeting PIM1 
(TRCN0000010115 (#1) and TRCN0000010118 (#2)) and a nontargeting (NT) control 
shRNA (TRC1/1.5) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). The shRNA#1 sequence 
targeting PIM1 and the NT shRNA were also subcloned into the inducible Tet-pLKO-puro 
lentiviral vector (Addgene, Massachusetts, USA). Lentiviral particles were produced in 
HEK293T cells and titrated onto breast cancer cells in medium containing puromycin (1.5 
μg/ml) in order to achieve optimal knockdown of the target protein with minimal viral load.

 Transduced cells were treated with doxycycline (0.5 μg/ml) to achieve knockdown, where 
appropriate.
siGENOME siRNA targeting PIM1 (D-003923-01) or MYC (L-003282-02- 0005), and a 
nontargeting siRNA pool#2 (D-001206-14) control, were purchased from Dharmacon 
(Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Silencer Select siRNA targeting PIM2 
(s21751) was purchased from Ambion (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). 
FlexiTube PIM3 siRNA#1 (S100684915), PIM3 siRNA#5 (S103084543) and a nontargeting 
siRNA (S103650325) were purchased from Qiagen Ltd. (Manchester, UK). Cells were 
transfected with 20 nmol/L siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent 
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA expression constructs
The complete PIM1 cDNA sequence (NCBI reference sequence NM_001243186.1) 
subcloned into the pDONR221 entry vector was obtained from Geneart (Life Technologies, 
Paisley, UK). This cDNA sequence incorporated silent mutations in the third nucleotide of 
the codons of the sequence targeted by PIM1 shRNA#1 and PIM1 siRNA, and the stop 
codon (TAG) was replaced with a tyrosine-encoding codon (TAC) to generate a rescue 
construct that is insensitive to the PIM1-specific shRNA. PIM1 cDNA from the entry vector 
was Gateway-recombined into the pLenti6.2/C-Lumio/V5-DEST vector by using the 
Virapower C-Lumio Lentiviral Expression kit (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). A kinase-
dead PIM1 (PIM1K67M) construct was generated by introducing a site- specific mutation 
into the complete PIM1 cDNA sequence (pDONR221 entry vector), mutating the codon 
encoding Lys67 to a codon encoding methionine, using the PCR-based site-directed 
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA, USA). Primers that were used to introduce the mutation 
were designed following Stratagene guidelines. A MYC overexpression vector was obtained 
from Addgene (Massachusetts, USA)33. The PIM1WT, PIM1K67M and myc sequences were 
Gateway-recombined into the pInducer20 vector, which has a sequence encoding an HA 
tag64. All of the constructs were sequenced by SourceBioscience (Cambridge, UK). 
Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells.
Quantitative RT–PCR
RNA was extracted from cells by using the QIAZOL reagent (Qiagen Ltd., Manchester, 
UK), following manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was prepared from 2 μg total RNA in the 
presence of random hexamers and using an Applied Biosystems kit, according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed using a SYBR-Green-based detection 
system and a 7900HT Fast RT–PCR thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts, 
USA) at the Guy’s Hospital genomics laboratory. We used the following primers: 5′-
CGAGCATGACGAAGAGATCAT-3′ and 5′-TCGA AGGTTGGCCTATCTGA-3′ for 
PIM1; 5-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′ and 5′-TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG-3′ 
for GAPDH; and 5-GGGCAGG ATTGTGACTCTCATT-3′ and 5-
GATGCAGCTTTCTTGGTTTATGG-3′ for MCL1. Primers specific to MYC 
(QT00035406), PIM2 (QT00086884) and PIM3 (QT00092197) were obtained from Qiagen 
Ltd. (Manchester, UK). Each set of primers was validated following standard PCR 
procedures, which showed the generation of one product at only the expected molecular

 weight. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping target, and the data were normalized using a 
standard comparative Ct method.
Cell population growth assay
Cells were plated in triplicate at 4,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cell population viability 
was determined over time using Cell Titer-Blue (Promega, Southampton, UK), following the 
manufacturer’s instructions, or by labeling DNA with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Life 
Technologies, Paisley, UK). Fluorescence was read using the FLUOstar Omega plate reader 
(BMG LabTech, Aylesbury, UK).
Caspase 3/7 activation assay
Cells were plated in triplicate at 4,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Caspase activation was 
determined using the Caspase-Glo3/7 Assay (Promega, Southampton, UK), following the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Two-dimensional (2D) colony-formation assay
Cells were plated in triplicate at a low density in 6-well plates. After 15–21 d, the cells were 
fixed with cold methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution. Colonies were 
counted with an e-count pen (Heathrow Scientific, Nottingham, UK)65. For drug treatments, 
paclitaxel and eribulin were provided as remnants by the Guy’s Hospital Oncology 
Pharmacy. AZD1208 was provided by AstraZeneca (Wilmington, Delaware, USA). The 
culture medium was replaced every other day. For drug-combination treatments, AZD1208 
or DMSO control was given 24 h before chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Cells were then 
treated with combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs and AZD1208 or DMSO control for 
24 h. Medium was then replaced, and AZD1208 or DMSO control was given every other 
day until the end of the experiment.
Three-dimensional (3D) anchorage-independent growth assay in soft agar
A total of 1,000 singly suspended MDA-MB-231 cells were mixed in culture medium 
(37 °C) containing 0.3% low-melting-point agar (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and then 
seeded in 12-well plates on top of a layer of 0.6% agar (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). 
AZD1208 (AstraZeneca) was administered in a top (feeding) culture medium, which was 
replaced every 4 d. After 4 weeks in culture, the colonies (composed of at least ~20 cells) 
were counted by optical microscopy at ×200 magnification.
Dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP)
15 μl of BIM BH3 peptide at four different concentrations (0.2, 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 μM) was 
prepared in DTEB (300 mM trehalose, 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 80 mM KCl, 1 mM 
EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA and 5 mM succinate). 15 μl of each peptide concentration 
was added to wells in triplicate using a black 384-well plate (NUNC). The plate was left at 
room temperature (RT) during the preparation of the single-cell suspension. Cells, which 
were previously plated at 150,000 cells/well in 6-well plates, were trypsinized and collected 
72 h after siRNA (NT or PIM1) transfection, or following AZD1208 or DMSO treatment. 
Single-cell suspensions were pelleted at 500g, resuspended and washed in DTEB before

 being resuspended in DTEB at a density of 2.67 × 106 (4× density). One volume of the cell 
suspension was added to one volume of the 4× dye solution previously prepared (4 μM JC-1, 
40 μg/ml oligomycin, 0.02% digitonin, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol in DTEB). The 2× 
cell/dye solution was left at RT for 10 min to allow permeabilization and dye equilibration. 
15 μl of the 2× cell/dye mix was then added to each treatment well of the plate. This led to a 
final concentration of the BIM peptide in each well of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 μM. The plate was 
then placed into the Infinite M200 pro TECAN plate reader. The plate was shaken for 15 s, 
and individual wells were read at 590 nm every 5 min over a 3-h time course at 30 °C. The 
obtained values were plotted as ‘Δpriming’. The difference in priming was determined by 
calculating the area under the DMSO control and the FCCP control minus the area under the 
individual peptide concentrations and the FCCP. These differences where then plotted as 
ΔΨn at RFU590nm.
Nanostring nCounter PanCancer Pathways gene expression analysis
RNA was extracted from cells using the QIAZOL reagent (Qiagen Ltd., Manchester, UK), 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were quantified using Nanodrop 
(Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and Qubit Fluorimetric Quantitation (Thermo 
Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The NanoString nCounter System (NanoString 
Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) was used to measure the gene expression profiles of 12 
samples. 100 ng total RNA was assessed using the nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel, 
which targets 730 genes representing all of the major cancer pathways, including key driver 
genes. Expression data were normalized using the nSolver analysis module and custom 
scripts in R 2.13.1. Background correction was done by subtracting the geometric mean of 
the eight negative-control probes. Expression values were normalized with the most stable 
31 housekeeping genes, which were selected based on the geNorm algorithm. Expression 
values were then log2-transformed and standardized within each sample. All 730 genes in 
the present study were detected. Significant differential genes were identified by two-class 
comparison (control versus experimental condition); a volcano plot was used to display the 
fold change and P value (using the software packages ggplot and calibrate in the R 
enviroment).
Mouse studies
All animal experiments with cell line xenografts were approved by the King’s College 
London Institutional Committees on Animal Welfare, and in compliance with the United 
Kingdom Home Office Animals Scientific Procedures Act, 1986. Female CD-1 Nu/Nu mice 
were obtained from Charles River UK Ltd. Procedures were carried out on 28- to 35-d-old 
mice. One million MDA-MB-231 or SUM149 cells mixed 1:1 in PBS:Matrigel were 
injected into the inguinal fat pad of mice using standard procedures. After the tumors 
reached 4 mm in diameter, as assessed by palpation and caliper measurement, mice were 
randomized into groups (treatments with vehicle, AZD1208, eribulin, or combinations of 
eribulin and AZD1208). Mice were then dosed daily by oral gavage at 30 mg per kg body 
weight (mg/kg) (MDA-MB-231 xenografts) or 15 mg/kg (SUM149 xenografts) of AZD1208 
or vehicle control (0.1% Tween-80, 0.5% methylcellulose). Eribulin was administered by 
intravenous tail-vein injection at 0.1 mg/kg. Saline solution (0.9%) was used as the vehicle 
control for eribulin treatment. Tumor growth was monitored over time. After vehicle-treated

 tumors reached 10 mm in diameter, the experiment was terminated, and tumors were excised 
and processed for western blotting analysis (snap-frozen) or fixation in formalin for 
histological examination (FFPE).
Patient-derived xenotransplants (PDX) studies were performed at the Experimental 
Therapeutics Group (Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain) and were 
approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal’s Healthcare and under the Patient’s 
Informed Consent of the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. Foxn1−/− nude mice were 
obtained from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). Procedures were carried out in 
42- to 56-d-old female mice. For each PDX model, one 2-mm tumor piece was implanted 
into both inguinal fat pads of mice following standard procedures. When tumors reached 6 
mm in diameter, as assessed by palpation and caliper measurement, mice were randomized 
into groups (treatment with vehicle, AZD1208, eribulin, or combinations of eribulin and 
AZD1208). Animals were then dosed daily by oral gavage at 30 mg/kg AZD1208 or vehicle 
(0.1% Tween 80, 0.5% methyl cellulose). Eribulin was administered by intraperitoneal 
injection at 0.1 mg/kg. Saline solution (0.9%) was used as the vehicle. After vehicle-treated 
tumors reached 14 mm in diameter, the experiment was terminated, and tumors were excised 
and processed for western blotting analysis (snap-frozen) or fixation in formalin for 
histological examination (FFPE).
For both cell line and patient-derived xenografts, tumor volume was calculated using the 
formula: V = (π × length × width2 / 6), where length is the longest tumor diameter, and 
width is the perpendicular diameter. For data analysis, tumor volume was normalized to the 
volume at which treatment was started and expressed as the fold change relative to this. 
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism.
Histological analysis
Histological analysis was performed on 3-μm thick tissue sections stained with a standard 
hematoxylin (Hematoxylin Solution, Gill No.III, Sigma) and eosin (H&E) staining protocol. 
All histological slides were digitized at magnification ×20 (0.46 μm/pixel) using a 
Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Digital 
images in ndp format were submitted for quantitative image analysis using HistoQuest 4.2 
(Tissugnostic, Vienna, Austria) software. The HistoQuest nucleus detection algorithm for 
hematoxylin staining was used as a master channel to identify all tumor cell nuclei and 
enable cell quantification. The surface area of the tumor was also measured in the system, 
and the value for tumor cell density was calculated as the number of cells per mm2.
To assess p27 staining, HistoQuest software was optimized to detect individual tumor cells 
and assess the intensity of DAB staining in the cell nucleus. The software automatically 
detects tissue that is subjected to color separation to differentiate between blue and brown 
staining. A nucleus-detection algorithm on the hematoxylin staining was used to detect 
tumor cell nuclei and was defined as a master channel. A nuclear mask was used to analyze 
the staining intensity of the chromogen (DAB) in a nonmaster channel. The staining 
intensity was measured as the mean intensity of all pixels within a cell, with a range of 
values per pixel from 0 to 255.

 Statistical analysis
Gene expression and copy number statistical analyses were performed in the R environment, 
using several CRAN packages (http://cran.r-project.org/) as described above. Unpaired two-
sided t-tests and one- way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons tests were performed 
using GraphPad Prism software for analysis of the data obtained in all in vitro experiments 
and in vivo animal studies. For in vitro studies, no samples were processed and then 
excluded; all completed experiments are reported. For in vivo studies, we estimated that we 
would need at least six samples per treatment group to see an effect, for a power of 80% and 
for the probability of type I error (α) = 0.05. Experiments were repeated at least twice to 
confirm treatment response. The sample size for all in vitro experiments was not chosen with 
consideration of the power needed to detect a prespecified effect size. For in vivo studies, the 
total number of mice per group is indicated. Mice were excluded from the study if body 
weight was reduced during treatment by more than 15% as compared to that at the start of 
treatment. For mouse studies, investigators were blinded to the group allocation during the 
experiment and drug treatment. Investigators were also blinded when assessing the outcome 
by immunohistochemistry. Mice were randomized to treatment groups when tumors reached 
a predetermined diameter on a per experiment basis, as described above. For each data set, 
the data meet the assumptions of the statistical test used, as determined by distribution and 
variance.

fraction values (relative to the number of colonies in the DMSO control) (right) for the 
indicated cell lines after treatment with increasing doses of paclitaxel (a) or eribulin (b) in 
the presence of AZD1208 (3 μM for MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and MTSV1.7 cells, and 1 
μM for SUM149 cells) (+) or DMSO (−). The data represent the mean ± s.e.m. values of the 
surviving fraction for each chemotherapy dose point with DMSO control or AZD1208

 across at least three independent experiments. P values were determined by the paired t-test. 
Scale bars, 10 mm. (c,d) Relative tumor volume over time in mice bearing MDA-MB-231 
(c) or SUM149 (d) xenografts following treatment with AZD1208 by oral gavage (OG), 
eribulin by intravenous tail-vein injection (IV), or a combination of eribulin and AZD1208. 
(e,f) Relative tumor volume over time in mice bearing patient-derived xenograft tumors 
PDX93 (e) or PDX156 (f) following treatment of host mice with AZD1208 by oral gavage, 
eribulin by intraperitoneal injection (IP), or a combination of eribulin and AZD1208. Vehicle 
treatment was used as a control. In c–f, the number of treated mice (n) per group is 
indicated. Data represent the mean ± s.e.m. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; by 
Welch’s ANOVA. (g–j) Representative H&E-stained images of MDA-MB-231 xenografts 
(vehicle-treated, n = 10; AZD1208-treated, n = 11; eribulin-treated, n = 5; combination-
treated, n = 4) (g), SUM149 xenografts (vehicle-treated, n = 16; AZD1208-treated, n = 14; 
eribulin-treated, n = 15; combination-treated, n = 18) (h), PDX93 tumors (vehicle-treated, n 
= 8; AZD1208-treated, n = 9; eribulin-treated, n = 6; combination-treated, n = 7) (i) and 
PDX156 tumors (vehicle-treated, n = 6; AZD1208-treated, n = 8; eribulin-treated, n = 6; 
combination-treated, n = 4) (j) at the end of the indicated treatments. Scale bars, 100 μm. 
(k–n) Quantification of cell density (number of tumor cells/area) of MDA-MB-231 
xenografts (k), SUM149 xenografts (l), PDX93 tumors (m) and PDX156 tumors (n) at the 
end of the indicated treatments. Each symbol represents an individual tumor. Data in k–n 
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test. *P < 0.05, **P 
< 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
