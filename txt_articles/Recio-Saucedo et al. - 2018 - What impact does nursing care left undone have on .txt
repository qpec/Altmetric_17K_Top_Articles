Aims and objectives: Systematic review of the impact of missed nursing care on
outcomes in adults, on acute hospital wards and in nursing homes.
Background: A considerable body of evidence supports the hypothesis that lower
levels of registered nurses on duty increase the likelihood of patients dying on hos-
pital wards, and the risk of many aspects of care being either delayed or left undone
(missed). However, the direct consequence of missed care remains unclear.
Design: Systematic review.
Methods: We searched Medline (via Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Scopus for
studies examining the association of missed nursing care and at least one patient
outcome. Studies regarding registered nurses, healthcare assistants/support work-
ers/nurses’ aides were retained. Only adult settings were included. Because of the
nature of the review, qualitative studies, editorials, letters and commentaries were
excluded. PRISMA guidelines were followed in reporting the review.
Results: Fourteen studies reported associations between missed care and patient
outcomes. Some studies were secondary analyses of a large parent study. Most of
the studies used nurse or patient reports to capture outcomes, with some using
administrative data. Four studies found significantly decreased patient satisfaction
associated with missed care. Seven studies reported associations with one or more
patient outcomes including medication errors, urinary tract infections, patient falls,
pressure ulcers, critical incidents, quality of care and patient readmissions. Three
studies investigated whether there was a link between missed care and mortality
and from these results no clear associations emerged.
Conclusions: The review shows the modest evidence base of studies exploring
missed care and patient outcomes generated mostly from nurse and patient self-
reported data. To support the assertion that nurse staffing levels and skill mix are

 associated with adverse outcomes as a result of missed care, more research that
uses objective staffing and outcome measures is required.
Relevance to clinical practice: Although nurses may exercise judgements in ration-
ing care in the face of pressure, there are nonetheless adverse consequences for
patients (ranging from poor experience of care to increased risk of infection, read-
missions and complications due to critical incidents from undetected physiological
deterioration). Hospitals should pay attention to nurses’ reports of missed care and
consider routine monitoring as a quality and safety indicator.

BACKGROUND
The association between inadequate quality of nursing care and patient
harm has been highlighted as an issue in numerous reports into failings
in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England (Keogh, 2013).
Indeed, failure to ensure adequate nurse staffing levels has frequently
been cited as a contributing factor (Luettel, Beaumont, & Healey, 2007;
Smith, 2010). Delayed or unfinished care, more broadly identified as
missed care, encompasses all aspects of clinical, emotional or administra-
tive nursing care that have only been partially completed, were delayed
or were not completed at all. The terminology used to refer to missed
care varies slightly with the instruments used in the studies of the field.
In some instances, missed care is viewed as a form of care rationing
(Jones, Hamilton, & Murry, 2015), or care left undone (Ausserhofer
et al., 2014), while in others, the focus is on unmet patient need (Lucero,
Lake, & Aiken, 2009). Most evidence of missed care comes from self-
reported nursing or patient questionnaires (Jones et al., 2015).
The current literature on missed care provides mounting evi-
dence of the pervasive nature of the problem and, more importantly,
the threat it poses to patient safety. Patient outcomes reported in
the missed care literature, which have been associated with quality
of care delivered, include hospital-acquired infections, discharge
planning, mortality, falls, patient mobilisation, feeding, psychological
and emotional support (Cho, Kim, Yeon, You, & Lee, 2015; Kalisch,
2006; Kalisch, Tschannen, & Lee, 2011, 2012; Papastavrou, Andreou,
& Efstathiou, 2014; Schubert, Clarke, Aiken, & de Geest, 2012).
Likely factors that influence care prioritisation and completion
include the time that is required to complete a care task and the
immediate effect that delaying or missing this task might have on
patients (Kalisch, 2006).
Studies exploring missed care under the implicit rationing approach
have found that nursing activities related to surveillance are among
the top five most frequently left undone (Jones et al., 2015; Rochefort
& Clarke, 2010; Schubert et al., 2012). These findings resonate with
analysis by Smith (2010) about the acute problem regarding frequency
of physiological observations. Smith proposes that the problem might
lie in the levels of trained staff, suggesting that more nursing staff on
duty might provide better surveillance, resulting in reduced deteriora-
tion, cardiac arrest and failure-to-rescue.
Resource adequacy and nurse staffing have been reported as key
environment factors influencing the incidence and prevalence of
missed care. A considerable body of evidence supports the hypothe-
sis that lower levels of registered nurses on duty increase the likeli-
hood of patients dying on hospital wards (Griffiths et al., 2016;
Needleman et al., 2011) and the risk of many aspects of care being
either delayed or left undone (Ausserhofer et al., 2014). Guidelines
on safe staffing published by the National Institute for Care and
Health Excellence (NICE) highlighted the need for more evidence
and indicators to determine safe nurse staffing levels, and studies to
determine the extent to which they are achieved in practice. Fur-
thermore, NICE proposed that missed care could be used as a “red
flag” to warn of inadequate staffing levels and, as a result, be a
potential useful indicator of the quality of nursing services (National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2014).
In this systematic review, we searched for quantitative studies
reporting associations between missed care and patient outcomes in
acute hospital and nursing homes, where care is delivered by nursing
staff. We then assessed the evidence of the short- and long-term
effects that missed care has on patients.

AIM
To conduct a systematic review of the impact of missed nursing care
on outcomes in adults on acute hospital wards and in nursing
homes.
What does this article contribute to the wider
global clinical community?
• Nursing staff and patients indicate instances where care
delivered or received is incomplete and suboptimal when
staffing levels are inadequate.
• The negative impact on patient outcomes resulting from
missed care highlights the significance of exploring further
the factors that affect the completion of nursing activities.

METHOD
Medline (via Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Scopus were searched
for studies examining the association of missed nursing care and at
least one patient outcome. We included primary research where
missed care was not treated as the outcome measure. Studies regard-
ing care delivered by registered nurses, healthcare assistants/support
workers/nurses’ aides were retained. We included studies conducted
in acute hospitals or nursing homes; only adult settings were consid-
ered. Only studies with quantitative evidence were retained. Conse-
quently, qualitative studies, editorials, letters and commentaries were
excluded. Papers were not excluded on the basis of replicability or
generalisability of findings. This review is reported according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009).

Search strategy
The search strategy was built using free-text keywords and medical sub-
ject headings, and related to missed nursing care and patient outcomes.
Because of the different conceptualisations of missed care in the litera-
ture (Jones et al., 2015), we included the following terms: “missed nurs-
ing care,” “care rationing,” “care left undone” and “unfinished care.”
Search terms for patient outcomes were as follows: pressure
ulcers; falls; catheter-related and urinary tract infections; venous
thromboembolism; patient and/or carer experience (including satis-
faction ratings and/or complaints concerning care received); mortal-
ity; hospital-acquired infections; hospital readmissions; medication
system errors (i.e., drug administration delayed or missed); quality of
health care; and patient safety.
3.2

Search results
The search produced 2,430 records. An initial screen of titles was
carried out to exclude irrelevant papers, resulting in the retention of
155 titles abstract screened. Following abstract screening, 44 studies
were retained for full review, during which 30 studies were excluded
due to the following:
• absence of reports of associations between missed care and
patient outcomes; n = 2
• reports of associations of missed care and staff outcomes instead
of patient outcomes; n = 2
• unclear definition and assessment of missed care; n = 1
• duplication of study as reported in two sources (i.e., doctoral
thesis and journal article). The content of the study in a more
extended version (i.e., doctoral thesis) was retained; n = 1
• Missed care from other health professionals (i.e., not nursing
staff); n = 1
• Medication errors studied as a missed care process and not as
outcomes; n = 23
A total of 14 papers were analysed fully (Figure 1).

Quality appraisal
To assess the quality of the studies, we adapted the National Insti-
tute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) quality appraisal check-
list for quantitative studies (National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE), 2014). The quality assessment was expressed in
terms of internal and external validity. Internal validity included
information on reliability and completeness of the measurements,
and ability of the study to control for potential confounding fac-
tors. External validity was assessed by appropriate sample size and
statistical power. The complete appraisal checklist is available in
Appendix.
Quality assessments were performed separately by two review-
ers (AR-S and CDO), and disagreements were resolved by discussion.
Most studies were rated as having significant limitations in internal
and/or external validity. One study was weak in both aspects of
validity, and no study was rated as strong in both. Quality ratings for
each study can be found in Table 1.

RESULTS
The 14 studies reported a range of outcomes of interest: medication
errors; bloodstream infections; pneumonia; urinary tract infections
(UTIs); nosocomial infections; patient falls; pressure ulcers; patient
and/or carer experience and satisfaction ratings; patient safety; qual-
ity of nurse delivered care; critical incidents; adverse events; mortal-
ity and 30-day hospital readmissions.
Most studies measured missed care with nurse or patient sur-
veys that have been widely used in the missed care literature,

data from individual countries. The majority of the studies used
nurse or patient reports to capture outcomes, with some studies
using administrative data (Table 2).

Patient satisfaction
Four studies in hospital settings found missed care significantly
decreased patient satisfaction. These findings are summarised in
Table 3.
Bruyneel et al. analysed survey data from 217 hospitals across
eight European countries enrolled in the RN4CAST study. Using fac-
tor analysis, the authors classified care left undone into two
domains—clinical
nursing
activities
and
planning/communication
activities—and examined the relationships with patient satisfaction.
The authors reported a significant association between clinical care
left undone (omission of at least one of: adequate patient surveil-
lance, skincare, oral hygiene, pain management, treatments and pro-
cedures, timely medication administration, frequently changing the
patient’s position) and patients recommending the hospital to family
and friends (Bruyneel et al., 2015). A study of five hospitals in
Cyprus (Papastavrou, Andreou, Tsangari, et al., 2014) used the
BERNCA survey, which included 20 questions on activities related
to
care
and
support,
rehabilitation,
monitoring
and
safety.
Responses to the survey indicated the extent to which nurses felt
able to perform the activities in the past 7 days. Responses were
collected on a four-point Likert-type scale, and a “rationing score”

 was derived from the average sum of all items. A high degree of
rationing was negatively associated with all five dimensions of
patient satisfaction (Papastavrou, Andreou, Tsangari, et al., 2014).
Schubert et al. applied the same BERNCA survey within 118 acute
hospital units in Switzerland and demonstrated a 37% reduction in
the odds of patients reporting satisfaction with the care they
received (p = .08) with each 0.5 increase in the rationing score
(Schubert et al., 2008). A smaller study (Ausserhofer et al., 2013) of
35 Swiss hospitals used the BERNCA-R survey (which extends the
original BERNCA instrument from 20–32 items and adds the state-
ment Not required to the responses options) to capture rationing of
care. Nurses reported how frequently they were unable to perform
32 basic nursing activities in the past seven working days due to
inadequate time, nurse staffing and/or skill mix. Respondents rated
each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale (task was not required = 0
—often = 4).
Results indicated that when patients experienced
higher levels of nursing care rationing, they were less likely to rec-
ommend the hospital to a family member or a friend (OR = 0.27;
95% CI = 0.11–0.67) (Ausserhofer et al., 2013).
Overall, the evidence shows a consistent detrimental effect of
rationing care on patient satisfaction. However, studies used differ-
ent instruments to capture patient satisfaction, which affects direct
comparability of the findings.

Quality of care delivered
Three studies identified from the literature search found a significant
association between measures of quality of care and tasks left
undone (Table 3). Ball et al. used the RN4CAST survey to examine
care left undone in 46 English NHS hospitals. Nurses were asked to
report how frequently they were unable to perform any of 13 nurs-
ing activities on their last shift due to time constraints. Two mea-
sures of “missed care” were derived. The first measure quantified
the prevalence of any care being left undone, based on one or more
of the activities having been ticked (binary measure). A second score
indicated the volume of care left undone, by summing the number
of activities ticked per person. The authors showed a significant cor-
relation between the number of items of missed care and nurses
perception
of
quality
of
care
(polyserial
correlation = �0.037,
p < .001) and nurse overall grading of patient safety on their unit/
ward (polyserial correlation = �0.40, p < .001) (Ausserhofer et al.,
2014). Sochalski’s study in US acute hospitals used a survey based
on a list of seven care activities, and nurses had to indicate which
was left undone during their last shift due to lack of time. The
results indicated an association between a poor rating of quality of
care and the number of tasks left undone (b = �0.20; p < .001;
Sochalski, 2004). Similar results were reported by Z�

asked how often in the last 7 days they could not conduct necessary

care when the amount of implicit rationing of care, rehabilitation and
monitoring (i.e., a subscale of the BERNCA instrument) was lower
(OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.24–0.49), and when less instances of rationing

Six studies reported associations between missed care, and one or
more
clinical
outcomes,
mainly
medication
errors;
bloodstream
infections; pneumonia; UTIs; nosocomial infections; patient falls;
pressure ulcers; critical incidents and quality of care; and patient
safety. Five of the studies found that missed care was associated
with adverse outcomes, but in regard to pressure ulcers, two stud-
ies (Ausserhofer et al., 2013; Thompson, 2014) found no significant
associations between missed care and the incidence or prevalence
of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. Results are summarised in
Table 4.
The study by Ausserhofer et al. reported an association between
rationing of nursing care and higher nurse-reported levels of blood-
stream
infections
(OR = 3.01;
95%
CI = 1.42–6.34),
pneumonia
(OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.11–6.39) and medication administration
errors (OR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.18–5.65). However, there were no
significant effects of rationing care on the incidence of pressure
ulcers and urinary tract infections (Ausserhofer et al., 2013). Simi-
larly, a study across 1,291 hospitals in the USA conducted by
Thompson found no significant associations of missed care with the
prevalence rates of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. The author
used the National Database of Nurse Quality Indicators survey in
741 US hospitals. This survey reported five activities due on the last
shift with a yes/no/not applicable answer. Items were aggregated to
the unit level to represent the percentage of nurses on the unit who

(Thompson, 2014).
Results on further clinical outcomes were reported in a study
conducted in the USA by Lucero et al. in 168 acute care hospitals.
The authors used a survey asking nurses to select from a list of
seven care activities that were necessary, but left undone, due to
the lack of time during their last shift worked. They concluded that
unmet nursing care needs were associated with nosocomial infection
(p < .001) and patient falls with injuries (p < .001) (Lucero, Lake, &
Aiken, 2010). The study by Nelson and Flynn in 63 US nursing
homes drew on the Multi-State Nursing Care and Patient Safety Sur-
vey, with 12 items asking nurses to indicate which necessary activi-
ties were left undone due to the lack of time during their last shift.
The authors found a number of missed nursing care tasks associated
with a higher likelihood of residents experiencing UTIs. The tasks
reported were administering medications on time (p = .000); ade-
quate patients surveillance (p = .001); performing necessary treat-
ments and procedures (p = .007); comforting/talking with patients
(p = .008); teaching patients and/or families (p = .018); documenting
nursing care (p = .04); coordinating patient care (p = .36) (Nelson &
Flynn, 2015). A study in eight hospitals in Switzerland found care

(OR = 1.61; p < .04); critical incidents (OR = 1.10; p < .002); and
pressure ulcers (OR = 1.15; p < .0010) (Schubert et al., 2008). A sub-
sequent analysis of the sample from the previous study (1,338
nurses and 779 patients) sought to define a clinically meaningful
rationing threshold level and found consistent reports of nosocomial
infections, pressure ulcers and patient satisfaction being sensitive to
rationing with negative consequences (Schubert, Clarke, Glass, Schaf-
fert-Witvliet, & De Geest, 2009).
While the evidence originating from nurse reports largely indi-
cates significant associations between missed care and adverse clini-
cal outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers, medication errors, nosocomial
infections), evidence relying on objective clinical data is more mixed,
with one study indicating an association between several activities
left undone and urinary tract infection. Yet, another study concluded
that there was no association between missed care and pressure
ulcers. However, these studies derived from diverse contexts, and
missed care was captured with different surveys, and as seen in
Table 1, their validity was assessed as moderate or weak.

Missed care, readmissions and mortality
Overall four studies explored the association between missed care,
readmissions and mortality. They are summarised in Table 5. A large
study of 419 hospitals in the USA by Carthon et al. relying on the
Multi-State Nursing Care and Patient Safety Survey showed that a
10% increase in missed treatments and procedures was associated
with patients more likely to experience readmissions within 30 days
of hospital discharge (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.06–1.18). When the
analysis was adjusted for the quality of the work environment, the
effect of missing essential nursing was no longer a significant predic-
tor of readmission, except for missing treatments and procedures,
which still showed high odds for patients being readmitted to hospi-
tal within 30 days of discharge (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01–1.13)
(Carthon, Lasater, Sloane, & Kutney-Lee, 2015).
Three studies reported associations between missed care and
patient mortality. In their study comparing two groups of acute hos-
pitals in Switzerland (n = 8 sample; n = 71 comparator), Schubert
et al. reported that patients admitted to hospitals with the highest
level of care rationing (i.e., BERNCA score 1.11–1.40) had a 51%
increase in the odds of death compared to those patients hospi-
talised in the comparison group consisting of 71 out of 352 acute
hospitals and specialised clinics in Switzerland (i.e., BERNCA score
0.51–0.80) (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.34–1.70) (Schubert et al., 2012).
However, overall levels of inpatient mortality (2.7% vs. 2.8%) and
emergency admissions (45.7% vs. 47.4%) were similar for both
groups of hospitals. Ambrosi et al. conducted a secondary analysis of

 data collected in 12 Italian hospitals with the aim of identifying fac-
tors associated with in-hospital mortality of patients >65 years old.
They used the MISSCARE survey, where nurses and nurse aides
reported the frequency of missing 24 nursing interventions during
their last shift on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = never—5 = always).
The analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the
groups of patients who died or survived (average missed care
score = 51.5% in deceased patients and 52.6% in surviving patients,
p = .04); however, when stepwise logistic regression analysis was per-
formed, no associations were observed between missed nursing care
and inpatient mortality (Ambrosi et al., 2016). Lucero et al., 2010 after
adjusting for patient and ward environment characteristics, found no
evidence of an association between unmet nursing care needs and 30-
days patient mortality (OR = 0.99; 0.89–1.10).
Overall, these studies provide insufficient evidence to support an
effect of missed care on patient mortality. However, the study that
considered a larger and more diverse sample seemed to support the
notion of the association between missed care and in-hospital
mortality.

DISCUSSION
In summary, the evidence we reviewed indicates an association
between missed care and patient outcomes, albeit tenuous in some
instances. A number of studies provide evidence in two major cate-
gories of patient outcomes negatively affected by omissions of care:
patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. Patient satisfaction was
negatively associated with missed care in four studies. Clinical out-
comes affected by missed care, as reported in nine studies, included
pressure ulcers, medication errors, nosocomial infections, patient
falls, critical incidents, 30-day hospital readmission and mortality.
Although most studies controlled for patient case mix, and hospital
and nurse characteristics, differences in the context in which the
studies took place (e.g., hospital vs. nursing home) or units included
in the studies (e.g., medical, surgical and gynaecology) create poten-
tial limitations to the generalisability of the findings.
As with hospital studies, research conducted in nursing homes
reports that omission of nursing care activities affects the probability
of residents experiencing UTIs and the nurses’ ability to perform cer-
tain tasks (i.e., administer medication on time, adequately monitor
patients, or perform necessary treatments and procedures).
Despite it being essential to patient safety, surveillance has been
reported along with other nursing activities (i.e., ambulation, oral
hygiene) that are frequently missed in hospital settings (Osborne
et al., 2015). While we found mixed evidence about the relationship
between nurse-reported measures of missed care and mortality, the
potential of such negative outcome calls for an in-depth look of the
issues surrounding missed care in the form of inadequate patient
surveillance and its consequences. Early identification of physiologi-
cal deterioration has been recognised as one of the factors associ-
ated with preventable hospital deaths (Luettel et al., 2007; Smith,
2010) which relies on timely and adequate patient monitoring.
Technological solutions in the form of patient surveillance systems
that enable healthcare professionals to efficiently monitor patients
and identify those who require the most urgent attention may be a
solution to surveillance issues. While automated continuous monitor-
ing has not been shown to be associated with reductions in mortality,
innovations in intermittent monitoring, including electronic recording
with calculation of a risk based early warning score, have been shown
to reduce inpatient deaths (Cardona-Morrell, Prgomet, Turner, Nichol-
son, & Hillman, 2016; Schmidt et al., 2015). Such automated clinical
risk prediction models could support healthcare providers to deploy
resources where they are needed most, resulting in improved out-
comes and costs (Imison, Castle-Clarke, Watson, & Edwards, 2016).
However, the introduction of a new system that demands time from
an already overstretched workforce needs careful planning.
Increasingly, frequency of missed care is being considered as an
indicator to assess the quality of nursing care. As reported in one
study in our review, the amount of missed care partially mediates
the effects of patient-to-nurse ratios and work environment on
patient recommending the hospital (Bruyneel et al., 2015). However,
bias in the instruments available to measure missed care, coupled
with the self-reported nature of most survey data, limits the compa-
rability of findings from studies in the field (Jones, Gemeinhardt,
Thompson, & Hamilton, 2016).
Our findings resonate with research that highlights the associa-
tions of staffing levels of different nursing staff with patient out-
comes and quality of nursing care services (Needleman, Buerhaus,
Mattke, Stewart, & Zelevinsky, 2002). This indicates the potential
significance of missed care as a consequence of inadequate nurse
staffing resources, although the relationship between missed nursing
care and mortality is as yet uncertain.

CONCLUSIONS
This review shows a modest evidence base for a link between
missed care and patient outcomes, generated mostly from nurse and
patient self-reported data. To support the assertion that nurse staff-
ing levels and skill mix are associated with adverse outcomes, more
research using objective staffing and outcome measures is required.
Nursing staff and patients indicate instances where care delivered or
received is suboptimal when staffing levels are inadequate. The neg-
ative effects on patients in hospital of missing care tasks have, high-
light the significance of exploring further the factors that affect the
completion of nursing activities. Limiting the occurrence of omissions
of care could potentially increase patient satisfaction and decrease
the frequency of negative adverse events.

2.2 Do the selected participants or areas represent the eligible population or area?
□
What % of selected hospitals agreed to participate (+1 for larger studies)
What % of eligible individuals (staff/patients) participated (60% + is acceptable)? (+1)
Was the data derived from administrative systems and complete (+1) or
Were the inclusion or exclusion criteria explicit and appropriate?
3. Were the main measures and procedures reliable?
□
Were main measures subjective (�1) or objective (++ for completely objective measures)
How reliable were measures (e.g., inter- or intra-rater reliability scores)? +1 for evidence of reliability
Where relevant. was there any indication that measures had been validated (e.g., validated against a gold
standard measure or assessed for content)
3.1 Were the measurements complete?
□
Were all or most of the study participants who met the defined study outcome definitions likely to have
been identified? (++ for mortality, + for other PSIs collected using clearly defined methods, � if abstracted
from discharge abstracts)
4. Was the study sufficiently powered to detect an effect (if one exists)?
□
Were there sufficient units/hospitals/wards/patients to give variation and enough patients to detect effects

For main patient/staff outcomes, was there patient/staff level risk adjustment e.g., for AGE, (patient)
DIAGNOSIS and COMORBIDITY(+ or ++) as appropriate. IT’S/RCT consider +1
5.1 Were the analytical methods appropriate?
□
Was there adjustment for clustering of data within hospitals? (+ 1), Where relevant was there control for
ward/hospital characteristics (+1)
5.2 Was the precision of association given or calculable? Is association meaningful?
□
Were confidence intervals or p values for effect estimates given or possible to calculate?
Were CIs wide or were they sufficiently precise to aid decision-making? If precision is lacking, is this because
the study is under-powered? If correlations between observations and workload how precise is the
prediction?
Overall score
□
5.3 Are the study results internally valid (i.e., unbiased)?
How well did the study minimise sources of bias (i.e., adjusting for potential confounders)?
Were there significant flaws in the study design?
5.4 Are the findings generalizable to the source population (i.e., externally valid)?
□
Are there sufficient details given about the study to determine if the findings are generalizable to the source
population?
Consider: participants, interventions and comparisons, outcomes, resource and policy implications
