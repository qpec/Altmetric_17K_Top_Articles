Abstract Somatic cell nuclear transfer has established that the oocyte contains maternal factors
with epigenetic reprogramming capacity. Yet the identity and function of these maternal factors
during the gamete to embryo transition remains poorly understood. In C. elegans, LSD1/KDM1A
enables this transition by removing H3K4me2 and preventing the transgenerational inheritance of
transcription patterns. Here we show that loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A in mice results in
embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage, with arrested embryos failing to undergo the maternal-to-
zygotic transition. This suggests that LSD1/KDM1A maternal reprogramming is conserved.
Moreover, partial loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A results in striking phenotypes weeks after
fertilization; including perinatal lethality and abnormal behavior in surviving adults. These maternal
effect hypomorphic phenotypes are associated with alterations in DNA methylation and expression
at imprinted genes. These results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where defects in early
epigenetic reprogramming can lead to defects that manifest later in development.

Introduction
At fertilization, the epigenome of the developing zygote undergoes widespread changes in DNA
methylation and histone methylation (Aoki et al., 1997; Arico et al., 2011; Bultman et al., 2006;
Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010; Lindeman et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2012; Vastenhouw et al.,
2010; Wu et al., 2011). This reprogramming is driven by the deposition of maternal proteins and
RNA into the zygote (Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009). After fertilization, zygotic genes become tran-
scriptionally active, while the maternal transcriptional program is silenced (Tadros and Lipshitz,
2009). In mice, this maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) occurs between the one- and two-cell (1-2C)
stage (Aoki et al., 1997; Hamatani et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2013).
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments in Xenopus demonstrated that the oocyte has
the capacity to reprogram a differentiated somatic nucleus into a cloned embryo (Gurdon et al.,
1958). This epigenetic reprogramming capacity of the oocyte is also conserved in mammals
(Campbell et al., 1996). It is thought that the epigenetic reprogramming capacity of the oocyte

 enables the MZT. Nevertheless, the enzymes involved in maternal epigenetic reprogramming, and
the consequences of failure to reprogram, largely remain a mystery.
Recently, work in C. elegans implicated LSD1/SPR-5/KDM1A (previously referred to as LSD1,
hereafter referred to as KDM1A) in maternal reprogramming at fertilization. Di-methylation of lysine
4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) is acquired in gamete genes during the specification and maintenance
of the germline. The H3K4me2 demethylase KDM1A is maternally deposited into the zygote at fertil-
ization and required to prevent H3K4me2 from being inherited transgenerationally. Without
KDM1A, H3K4me2 accumulates at gamete genes across generations and results in the inappropriate
expression of these genes. This correlates with increasing sterility in the population over time
(Katz et al., 2009).
The requirement to reprogram H3K4 methylation is also suggested to be a critical step in SCNT.
During SCNT in Xenopus, the cloned embryos often inappropriately express genes from the tissue
where the somatic nucleus was derived (Ng and Gurdon, 2005). This transcriptional memory can be
eliminated by overexpressing histone H3 with a mutated K4 residue (Ng and Gurdon, 2008). This
work implies that H3K4 methylation may be the carrier of transgenerational transcriptional memory,
and that complete reprogramming may require the removal of this modification.
Genomic imprinting is the monoallelic expression of a small number of genes based on their par-
ent of origin (Bartolomei and Tilghman, 1997). Imprinted genes are dependent upon DNA methyla-
tion at small imprinting control regions (ICRs) associated with these loci (Bartolomei and Tilghman,
1997). At ICRs, CpG methylation is established in the gametes and maintained throughout the
development of the offspring (Bartolomei, 2009). In mammals, there are two amine-oxidase histone
demethylases, LSD2/KDM1B (hereafter referred to as KDM1B) and KDM1A (Ciccone et al., 2009;
eLife digest During fertilization, an egg cell and a sperm cell combine to make a cell called a
zygote that then divides many times to form an embryo. Many of the characteristics of the embryo
are determined by the genes it inherits from its parents. However, not all of these genes should be
“expressed” to produce their products all of the time. One way of controlling gene expression is to
add a chemical group called a methyl tag to the DNA near the gene, or to one of the histone
proteins that DNA wraps around.
Soon after fertilization, a process called reprogramming occurs that begins with the removal of
most of the methyl tags a zygote inherited from the egg and sperm cells. The zygote’s DNA is then
newly methylated to activate a new pattern of gene expression. In mammals, some genes escape
this reprogramming; these “imprinted” genes retain the methylation patterns inherited from the
parents.
Reprogramming is assisted by “maternal factors” that are inherited from the egg cell. Once
reprogramming is completed, the maternal factors are destroyed as part of a process called the
maternal-to-zygotic transition. A maternal factor called KDM1A can remove specific methyl tags
from certain histone proteins, but how this affects the zygote is not well understood. Now, Wasson
et al. (and independently Ancelin et al.) have investigated the role that KDM1A plays in mouse
development.
Wasson et al. genetically engineered mouse egg cells to contain little or no KDM1A. Zygotes
created from egg cells that completely lack KDM1A die before or shortly after they have divided for
the first time and fail to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Other egg cells that contain low
levels of KDM1A can give rise to baby mice. However, many of these mice die soon after birth, and
those that grow to adulthood behave in abnormal ways; for example, they display excessive
chewing and digging. These disorders are linked to the disruption of DNA methylation at imprinted
genes.
The next challenge will be to further investigate the mechanisms by which defects in maternally
deposited KDM1A exert their long-range effects on imprinted genes and altered behaviour. This is
particularly important because of the recent discovery of three patients with birth defects that are
linked to genetic variants in KDM1A.

 Shi et al., 2004). KDM1B is expressed mainly in the oocyte and required for the establishment of
maternal imprints at imprinted loci (Ciccone et al., 2009; Stewart et al., 2015). Without KDM1B,
embryos derived from these oocytes exhibit a maternal effect embryonic lethality phenotype prior
to mid-gestation (Ciccone et al., 2009). This demonstrates that, similar to C. elegans, amine oxi-
dase-type histone demethylases can function maternally in mammals.
KDM1A is a component of several protein complexes. As part of the CoREST complex, it specifi-
cally demethylates H3K4me1/2, but not H3K4me3 (Shi et al., 2004; You et al., 2001). Alternatively,
when associated with the Androgen Receptor complex KDM1A has been shown to demethylate
H3K9me2 in vitro (Metzger et al., 2005). KDM1A is an essential gene in mammalian development,
as homozygous mutants fail to develop properly after implantation and die prior to embryonic day 8
(e8) (Foster et al., 2010; Macfarlan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2007). To determine whether
KDM1A may also be involved in maternal reprogramming, we conditionally deleted Lsd1/Kdm1a
(previously referred to as Lsd1, hereafter referred to as Kdm1a) in mouse oocytes with three differ-
ent maternal Cre transgenes. Deletion of Kdm1a maternally with either Zp3-Cre or Gdf9-Cre results
in embryonic lethality primarily at the 1-2C stage and these embryos fail to undergo the MZT. This
suggests that KDM1A plays a conserved role in maternal reprogramming. Surprisingly, deletion of
Kdm1a maternally with Vasa-Cre results in an incomplete loss of KDM1A in oocytes. This uncovers a
hypomorphic effect in which some surviving animals exhibit long-range developmental defects,
including perinatal lethality and behavioral abnormalities. These defects are associated with disrup-
tion of the epigenetic landscape, including aberrant DNA methylation and expression at imprinted
loci. These results demonstrate that defects in epigenetic reprogramming between generations can
lead to abnormalities later in development.
Results
KDM1A is expressed throughout oocyte development
Based on the previously demonstrated maternal role of KDM1A in C. elegans and KDM1B in mice,
we first asked if KDM1A is expressed in mouse oocytes (Ciccone et al., 2009; Katz et al., 2009).
RNA-seq datasets from ovulated oocytes and 2C-stage embryos suggested abundant KDM1A tran-
scripts in these cells (Macfarlan et al., 2012). Immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) with an antibody raised against KDM1A confirms that KDM1A is expressed in the oocyte
nucleus and in the surrounding follicle cells throughout oocyte development (Figure 1A, Figure 1—
figure supplement 1A–L). Therefore, to determine if KDM1A functions in oocytes, we conditionally
deleted Kdm1a by crossing Kdm1afl/fl mice (Wang et al., 2007) to three different maternal Cre
transgenic lines, Ddx4/Vasa-Cre (Gallardo et al., 2007), Gdf9-Cre (Lan et al., 2004) and Zp3-Cre
(de Vries et al., 2000) (oocytes and embryos from Kdm1afl/D::Ddx4/VasaCre, Kdm1afl/D::Gdf9-Cre,
and Kdm1afl/D::Zp3-Cre mice will be referred to hereafter as Kdm1aVasa, Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3
respectively). Vasa-Cre is expressed in the germline beginning at e18 and induces full deletion by
birth (Figure 1B) (Gallardo et al., 2007). Gdf9-Cre is expressed in oocytes beginning at postnatal
day 3 (P3), including in primordial follicles (Lan et al., 2004), while Zp3-Cre is also expressed in
oocytes, but beginning at P5 in primary follicles (Figure 1B) (de Vries et al., 2000). KDM1A IHC and
IF demonstrate that deletion of Kdm1a with either Gdf9-Cre or Zp3-Cre results in the complete loss
of KDM1A from the oocyte nucleus (Figure 1C–F,I). Crossing the Kdm1afl/fl allele to Vasa-Cre also
results in complete maternal deletion, as can be determined by the 100% segregation of the mater-
nally deleted allele to the offspring (all of offspring from Kdm1aVasa mothers crossed to wild-type
fathers result in heterozygous -/+ offspring) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This demonstrates
that, similar to deletion via Gdf9-Cre or Zp3-Cre, crossing the Kdm1afl/fl allele to Vasa-Cre also effec-
tively deletes Kdm1a maternally. However, for reasons that are not clear, deletion of Kdm1a with
Vasa-Cre results in a hypomorphic effect, where 33.3% of oocytes completely lack KDM1A protein,
but 66.7% retain a low level of KDM1A (Figure 1G–I). This incomplete effect is surprising because
the Vasa-Cre transgene is reported to be expressed earlier in the germline than either Gdf9-Cre or
Zp3-Cre (Figure 1B) (Gallardo et al., 2007; Lan et al., 2004). It is possible that the low level of
KDM1A remaining in some oocytes is due to delayed deletion of Kdm1a, though the reason for this
potential delay is unknown.

 Loss of maternal KDM1A results in 1–2 cell embryonic arrest
To determine if there is a functional requirement for maternal KDM1A in mice, we crossed Kdm1a-
Vasa, Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3 females to wild-type males to generate heterozygous offspring (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 2). In mice, zygotic transcription begins in the 1C embryo just prior to
the first cleavage to the 2C stage (Aoki et al., 1997; Hamatani et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2013). The
heterozygous offspring from the maternally deleted mothers have a normal Kdm1a gene on the
paternal allele. Thus, crossing maternally deleted mothers to wild-type fathers enables us to isolate

 the maternal function of KDM1A (Maternal-, Zygotic+, hereafter referred to as M-Z+). M-Z+ hetero-
zygous embryos derived from Kdm1aGdf9 mutant mothers are hereafter referred to as Kdm1aGdf9 M-
Z+ embryos, while M+Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from littermate control mothers that are
Cre minus are hereafter referred to as Kdm1aGdf9 M+Z+ embryos. Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos exhibit
embryonic arrest at the 1-2C stage (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–I). Specifically, in control
Kdm1aGdf9 M+Z+ embryos at embryonic day 1.5 (e1.5), we observe 7% fragmented/degraded
embryos, 65% 1-cell embryos and 28% 2-cell embryos (n=135, Figure 2—figure supplement 1I). In
contrast, in Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos at e1.5 we observe 40% fragmented/degraded embryos, 59%
unfertilized oocytes or 1-cell embryos, and only 1% 2C embryos (n=134, Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1I). The vast majority of the non-degraded Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos are clearly fertilized and
arrested at the 1C stage. However, we do occasionally observe unfertilized oocytes. In addition, we
sometimes observe embryos that are highly abnormal morphologically and are difficult to clearly
assign to a particular category. As a result, we quantified these Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos together.
Nevertheless, compared to Kdm1aGdf9 M+Z+ embryos, Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos have a large
increase in the number of fragmented/degraded embryos at the expense of normal 2C embryos
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1I). Also, the remaining 1C and 2C Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos do not
progress beyond the 1-2C stage, as we never observe any later stage embryos even at e2.5 (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1C,G,H).
M-Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from Kdm1aZp3 mothers (hereafter referred to as Kdm1aZp3
M-Z+embryos) undergo a phenotype that is similar to Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos. At e1.5, 95%
(n=20) of control Kdm1aZp3 M+Z+ embryos have reached the 2C stage (Figure 2E). In contrast, at
e1.5 only 35% (n=57) of Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos reach the 2C stage (Figure 2E), though this is still
much higher than the 1% of Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos that reach the 2C stage (Figure 2—figure
supplement 1I). It is not clear why there is a difference in the number of Kdm1aZp3 versus Kdm1aGdf9
M-Z+ embryos that cleave to the 2C stage. However, this may be due to subtle differences in devel-
opmental timing, strain background, or Cre specific differences. In addition, we have observed two
Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos that develop past the 2C stage to the 3C- and 4C- stage (Figure 2—figure
supplement 1J,K), though like the Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos, no Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos survive
to the blastocyst stage (data not shown). Taken together, the results from Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3

 mice suggest that the embryonic arrest, primarily at the 1-2C stages is the KDM1A maternal loss-of-
function phenotype.
Loss of maternal KDM1A results in a failure to undergo the MZT
To determine the maternal function of KDM1A, we considered two possibilities; (1) that KDM1A
affects transcription in the oocyte, or (2) that maternal KDM1A affects transcription post-fertilization
during the MZT. To determine if KDM1A affects transcription in the oocyte, we first compared the
transcriptome of control Kdm1afl/fl (Macfarlan et al., 2012) versus Kdm1aZp3 mutant oocytes. We
found relatively few transcriptional changes, with 195 genes over expressed and 281 genes under
expressed in Kdm1aZp3 oocytes (Figure 3A, Figure 3—source data 1A, Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 5). In addition, amongst the 875 repeat types extracted from the RepeatMasker database
(including LINEs, SINEs, etc.) there were only 2 repeat families that were activated and 2 repressed
in Kdm1aZp3 oocytes (Figure 3A, Figure 3—source data 1A, Figure 3—figure supplement 5). Man-
ual inspection revealed that few of these genes/repeats had both large fold-changes and low p-val-
ues, with the exception of the Mt1 gene, which was very highly activated in Kdm1aZp3 oocytes.
Furthermore, we found several mitochondrially encoded genes (like mtCo3 and Atpase6) that had
small but significantly reduced levels in Kdm1aZp3 oocytes. These mitochondrial genes are unlikely to
be directly regulated by KDM1A, but their reduced levels could indicate a subtle metabolic defect in
the mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of KDM1A has little effect on tran-
scription in oocytes.
Since we did not see a significant affect on oocytes, we considered the possibility that loss of
KDM1A affects transcription post-fertilization during the MZT. To determine if this is the case,
we isolated fertilized Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos that cleaved to the 2C stage, and compared them to
Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C embryos (Macfarlan et al., 2012). We chose to focus on embryos from
Kdm1aZp3 mothers because a substantially higher proportion of these embryos reach the 2C stage.
We found a dramatic alteration of the transcriptome, with 1527 genes over expressed and 2794
genes under expressed in Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos (Figure 3B, Figure 3—source data 1B). In
addition, there were 103 repeat families that were repressed in Kdm1aZp3 2C M-Z+ embryos, com-
pared with only 5 that were activated (Figure 3B, Figure 3—source data 1B). These findings are in
contrast to what has been observed in Kdm1a mutant ES cells that display a general de-repression
of both genes and repeats (Macfarlan et al., 2011; Macfarlan et al., 2012). GO analysis of over and
under expressed genes in Kdm1aZp3 2C M-Z+ embryos demonstrated an enrichment of genes nor-
mally expressed in unfertilized oocytes, and a reduction in genes associated with embryonic devel-
opment and tissue specific gene expression. This suggests that Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos may fail
to undergo the MZT (Figure 3B, Figure 3—source data 1B).
To test this hypothesis further, we compared the expression of mRNAs from control Kdm1afl/fl M+Z
+ 2C embryos (Macfarlan et al., 2012) or Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos with Kdm1afl/fl oocytes
(Macfarlan et al., 2012). If the Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos fail to undergo the MZT, then we would
expect them to be more similar to Kdm1afl/fl oocytes than Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C embryos. In Kdm1afl/fl
M+Z+ 2C embryos relative to Kdm1afl/fl oocytes, there are massive changes in the mRNA profile, with
>3,000 genes (and 387 repeat families) becoming zygotically activated and ~3000 maternal genes
(and 17 repeat families) which are suppressed. This demonstrates that MZT has occurred (Figure 3C,
Figure 3—source data 1C). In contrast, Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos fail to properly activate the
zygotic genome, with only 666 genes becoming activated (and 110 repeat families), and only ~1200
maternal genes repressed (13 repeat families) (Figure 3D, Figure 3—source data 1D). Hierarchical
clustering of Kdm1afl/fl oocytes, Kdm1aZp3 oocytes, Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C embryos and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+
2C embryos confirms this failure to activate the zygotic genome. Specifically, though Kdm1afl/fl
oocytes are similar to Kdm1aZp3 oocytes, Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos are more similar to Kdm1afl/fl
oocytes than Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C embryos (Figure 3E). In addition, principal component analysis
(PCA) demonstrated that ~40% of the variance between Kdm1afl/fl oocytes, Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C
embryos, and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos can be explained by a single component (PC1, Figure 3—
figure supplement 2), and the heat maps generated from PC1 genes confirm that Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C
embryos have expression profiles more similar to Kdm1afl/fl oocytes than Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C embryos
(Figure 3F). GO analysis demonstrated that PC1 genes fall into two categories, those associated with
unfertilized oocytes and are highly expressed in oocytes and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos, and those
associated with early embryonic development which are enriched only in Kdm1afl/fl M+Z+ 2C embryos

Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos is a failure to undergo the MZT.
Deletion of Kdm1a maternally with Vasa-Cre results in a hypomorphic
phenotype
Deletion of Kdm1a with either Gdf9-Cre or Zp3-Cre results in 100% of oocytes completely lacking
KDM1A (Figure 1C–F). In contrast, 66.7% of Kdm1aVasa mutant oocytes retain some KDM1A protein,
though the amount is much lower than heterozygous control oocytes (Figure 1G–I). To determine if
this lower amount of KDM1A retained in some Kdm1aVasa mutant oocytes gives rise to a hypomor-
phic phenotype, we mated Kdm1aVasa females to wild-type males to generate heterozygous M-Z+
offspring (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). As is the case with Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ off-
spring, these heterozygous M-Z+ offspring (hereafter referred to as Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ embryos) have
a normal paternal Kdm1a allele. Thus, any phenotypic effects in these Kdm1aVasa heterozygous M-
Z+ offspring are due to reduced maternal KDM1A.
Similar to Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos, the majority of Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ embryos
arrest prior to the blastocyst stage (Figure 4A–E). In control Kdm1aVasa M+Z+ embryos at e3.5, 55%
of embryos have reached the blastocyst stage, 35% are multicellular (>2C) and 10% are fragmented/
degraded (n=37, Figure 4E). In contrast, at e3.5 85% of the Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ embryos have frag-
mented/degraded (n=35, Figure 4E). However, unlike Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos,
which undergo complete embryonic arrest at the 1-2C stage, by e3.5 6% of Kdm1aVasa M-Z+
embryos have reached the multicellular stage (>2C) and 5% are blastocysts (n=35, Figure 4E).
Remarkably, some of these Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ embryos survive to birth. The average litter size born
from Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers is 2.3 (n=20), versus 6.2 (n=32) born from littermate control moth-
ers (Figure 4F). However, the vast majority of time vaginal plugged Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers give
rise to no viable progeny. Thus, this average litter size is undoubtedly a vast overestimate of the sur-
vival of Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ embryos overall.
The
transition
from
in

development
to
postnatal
development,
during
the
first
48 hr immediately following birth, is a highly stressful time for mice. If a mouse has a subtle defect
during embryogenesis, the newborn pup may die perinatally. This is reflected in the large number of
mouse models that exhibit perinatal lethality (Turgeon and Meloche, 2009). Therefore, to deter-
mine if lower maternal KDM1A might give rise to more subtle embryonic defects, we carefully moni-
tored the first 48 hr following birth in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny. Consistent with this being a major
developmental transition, even in genotypically normal mice, we observe that 5% of offspring
(n=216) born from littermate Kdm1aVasa control mothers die perinatally during the first 48 hr after

 birth (Figure 4G). However, in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny, the percentage of perinatal lethality is sig-
nificantly increased (26%, n=47) (Figure 4G). It is unclear why these animals are dying perinatally.
However, this increase in perinatal lethality is consistent with these animals having more subtle
developmental defects.
Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny exhibit abnormal behavior
Of the small number of M-Z+ animals that are born from Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers, nearly 1/3 die
perinatally in the first 48 hr after birth. However, the remaining 2/3 survive to adulthood and appear
to be morphologically normal. Notably, because of the embryonic arrest and the perinatal lethality,
this remaining 2/3 is a very small number of animals (n=10 from 8 crosses). Since progeny from
Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers have defects that can lead to perinatal lethality, we considered the

 possibility that the surviving animals from these
Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers (hereafter referred
to as Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults) could have pheno-
typic defects as well. To analyze these surviving
animals, we crossed Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers
(C57BL/6 background) to M. castaneus (CAST)
fathers. This enabled us to use polymorphisms
to examine subsequent molecular defects in a
parent of origin specific fashion. Importantly, F1
hybrid
(B6/CAST)
offspring
from
Kdm1aVasa
mutant mothers have the same hypomorphic
phenotype that we observe in a B6 background,
where a small number of animals survive until
birth (average litter size=1.6, n=6 litters from 8
crosses).
Mating the surviving Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults
produced progeny, suggesting no gross defects
in the specification of the germline or mating
behavior. However, when we observed these
Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults closely, we noticed that
they exhibit abnormal behaviors (Figure 5—fig-
ure supplement 1A, Video 1). These abnormal
behaviors include excessive scratching and digging, along with food harassing, where animals grind
up all of the remaining food in the food hopper and incorporate it into the bedding (Figure 5A–C).
To quantify the food harassing behavior, we monitored both the weight of the food in the food hop-
per and the height of the bedding in the cage. Over a 3-day period, each individual Kdm1aVasa M-
Z+ adult almost completely depleted the food in the food hopper due to food grinding and harass-
ing (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D). This resulted in a correspondingly large
increase in the height of the bedding over a 6-day period (Figure 5E). These effects are not
observed in Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers or the M. castaneus animals to which they were mated
(Figure 5D,E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,E), indicating that the behavior may be due to a
maternal effect. To determine if this behavior is due to a maternal effect, we intercrossed the
affected Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults. If the food-grinding behavior is due to a maternal effect, then mat-
ing two affected Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults should not produce progeny with abnormal behavior. This
is because the Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults used as mothers in these crosses have a normal Kdm1a allele
(-/+) so the resulting intercrossed progeny (hereafter referred to as F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults)
are all M+. Intercrossing affected M-Z+ F1 hybrids produced no F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults with
the food-grinding behavior, suggesting that the food-grinding behavior is dependent upon a mater-
nal effect (Figure 5D,E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,G). Nevertheless, it remains possible
that the F1 hybrid background also contributes to the abnormal behavior. To test this possibility, we
crossed control littermates of Kdm1aVasa mothers to CAST fathers to generate control B6/CAST
hybrids (hereafter referred to as B6/CAST M+Z+ controls). These control hybrids exhibit modest
food-grinding behavior, suggesting that the hybrid strain background likely also contributes to the
maternal food-grinding defect (Figure 5D,E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,F). However,
Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults are significantly more affected than B6/CAST M+Z+ hybrid controls
(Figure 5D,E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,F), suggesting that the abnormal food-grinding
behavior is predominantly due to a maternal effect. Importantly, we also do not observe any Kdm1a
haploinsufficiency defects. For example, the F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults that are heterozygous for
Kdm1a do not exhibit this abnormal behavior (Figure 5D,E; Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,G).
This suggests that the abnormal behavior is not due to Kdm1a haploinsufficiency. Finally, behavioral
defects were observed in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ survivors obtained from litters ranging from one to four
animals. This suggests that the maternal behavioral abnormalities are not simply due to reduced lit-
ter size.
Observations of Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults indicated that these mice also exhibit excessive digging
(Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, Video 1). To quantify this behavior, we assayed Kdm1aVasa M-Z+
adults and controls in a marble-burying assay. In this assay, individual mice are placed in a cage in

 which 20 marbles are arrayed on top of the bedding. Mice exhibiting excessive digging behavior will
bury higher numbers of marbles. For example, Slitrk5 obsessive-compulsive mice bury approximately
50% of the marbles in 30 min, compared to approximately 25% in controls (Shmelkov et al., 2010).
Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults exhibit striking behavior in the marble-burying assay. Compared to M.
castaneus controls, which bury 25% in 25 min (Figure 5G,I, Video 2), Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults bury
90% in the same time period (Figure 5H,I, Video 2). Similar to what was observed in the food-grind-
ing assays, we do not observe this behavior in F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults (average 7 marbles,

ble-burying in B6/CAST hybrid controls (average
10, Figure 5I). Nevertheless, as in the food-
grinding assay, Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults are sig-
nificantly more affected than B6/CAST hybrid M
+Z+ controls (Figure 5D,E and Figure 5—figure
supplement 1C,F). Taken together, these data
indicate that the excessive digging behavior is
also predominantly due to a maternal effect.
Finally, we also performed the open-field test
on Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults. In this assay, animals
are placed in a much larger space than they are
accustomed to. Animals that are more anxious
or fearful cross the middle of cage fewer times
and
spend
less

(Video 3). Consistent with the behavioral defects
that we observe in food-grinding and marble-
burying, Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adults perform signifi-
cantly fewer movements across the middle of
the cage (Figure 5J) and spend less time in the
center overall than CAST controls (Figure 5K).
Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny have
imprinting defects
The perinatal lethality and behavioral defects observed in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny are remarkable
because these animals have a normal Kdm1a allele. Thus the defects that we observe in Kdm1aVasa
M-Z+ progeny must be due to a heritable effect originating from the low level of maternal KDM1A.
As a result, we sought to determine the nature of this heritable defect. The Kdm1a homolog Kdm1b
is expressed maternally in mice, and loss of Kdm1b results in a heritable embryonic lethality defect
associated with a failure to maternally acquire DNA methylation at imprinted genes (Ciccone et al.,
2009; Stewart et al., 2015). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the heritable defects
could be due to DNA methylation defects at these loci, or in maternally methylated imprinted loci
unaffected by the loss of KDM1B. In addition, in our RNA-seq data, we observe the misregulation of
multiple genes that could potentially affect DNA methylation at imprinted loci. For example, four
genes that are known to maternally affect DNA methylation at imprinted loci, Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57
and
Dppa3/Stella
(Dawlaty
et
al.,
2013;
Li
et
al.,
2008;
Messerschmidt
et
al.,
2012;
Nakamura et al., 2007; Yamaguchi et al., 2013), are all misregulated in Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+mutants
(Tet1: -3.8 fold, Trim28: -3.3 fold, Zfp57: +3.2 fold and Dppa3/Stella: +.58 fold, Figure 3—figure
supplement 3; Figure 3—source data 1B, quantitative RT-PCR validation of Trim28, Zfp57 and
Dppa3/Stella in Figure 3—figure supplement
4).
Additionally,
the
DNA
methyltransferase
DNMT1 is overexpressed in Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+
mutants (Dnmt1: +2.1 fold, Figure 3—figure
supplement 3; Figure 3—source data 1B).
DNMT1 is thought to primarily act as the main-
tenance DNA methyltransferase (Li et al., 1992;
Pradhan et al., 1999), but when overexpressed,
DNMT1 has been shown to have de novo DNA
methyltransferase activity (Vertino et al., 1996).
Taken together, these observations raise the
possibility that DNA methylation and monoallelic
expression at imprinted genes could be altered
in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny, either directly or
indirectly. Interestingly, despite the clear loss of
KDM1A in Kdm1aZp3 mutant oocytes, the regu-
latory proteins that are affected by the loss of

 KDM1A are either not expressed in oocytes (Tet1) or not affected until after fertilization (Trim28,
Zfp57, Dppa3/Stella and Dnmt1, Figure 3—figure supplements 4,5). This is consistent with our pre-
vious observations that KDM1A primarily affects the MZT.
To investigate DNA methylation and the expression of imprinted genes in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ off-
spring, we performed bisulfite analysis and qRT-PCR on perinatal lethal Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ pups. We
analyzed imprinted that are both maternally (Zac1, Impact, Igf2r, Mest, Snrpn) and paternally methyl-
ated (H19). For these analyses, we took advantage of B6/CAST polymorphisms to determine
whether individual alleles in F1 hybrid offspring came from the mother or the father. These F1 hybrid
pups, derived from hypomorphic B6 Kdm1aVasa mothers mated to wild-type CAST fathers, are
denoted as maternal effect progeny 1 and 2 (MEP1 and MEP2), and were compared to two stage
matched B6/CAST hybrid controls.
Two imprinted loci, Zac1 and Impact, are severely affected in Kdm1aVasa offspring. At Zac1, DNA
methylation is inappropriately acquired on the paternal allele in both MEP, though to a slightly lesser
extent in MEP2 (Figure 6A). This is associated with significantly less expression of Zac1 in both MEP
(Figure 6B). Moreover, Zac1 is normally expressed exclusively from the paternal allele (Figure 6C).
However, in MEP1 Zac1 is now expressed exclusively from the maternal allele, while in MEP2, the
slightly lower level of inappropriate paternal methylation is associated with biallelic expression
(Figure 6C). At Impact, the overall DNA methylation pattern is unchanged (Figure 6D), but there is
a dramatic change in expression. Impact is normally expressed exclusively from the paternal allele,
but in both MEP1 and 2, Impact is now expressed predominantly from the maternal allele
(Figure 6F). In addition, in both MEP1 and MEP2, there is a significant decrease in the overall
expression level of Impact (Figure 6E).
In addition to the altered imprinting at Zac1 and Impact, we observe a general disruption of sev-
eral additional imprinted genes. At two of these additional imprinted loci (H19 and Igf2r), DNA
methylation is altered (Figure 6G and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). For example, at H19 DNA
methylation is inappropriately lost on the paternal allele in MEP1 (Figure 6G). There is also a slight
acquisition of inappropriate methylation on the maternal allele of both MEP (Figure 6G). At two
additional imprinted genes (Mest and Snrpn), DNA methylation appears normal (Figure 6—figure
supplement 1C,E). Furthermore, at three of the additional imprinted loci, we observe an overall
decrease in gene expression. These include Igf2r, Mest, and Snrpn (Figure 6—figure supplement
1B,D,F), while at H19, expression levels are unaffected (Figure 6H). However, the allele-specific
expression of all of these additional imprinted loci remains unaffected (data not shown). Taken
together, the changes in DNA methylation and expression indicate a general disruption in the nor-
mal regulation of genomic imprinting.
Discussion
A major question in the field of epigenetics is whether histone methylation is regulated between
generations, and whether potential defects in this process can lead to abnormalities in the resulting
progeny. To address this question, we asked if the maternal reprogramming function of KDM1A,
first demonstrated in C. elegans (Katz et al., 2009), is conserved in mammals. As in C. elegans,
KDM1A is heavily deposited maternally in the mouse oocyte, suggesting that KDM1A could play a
conserved role in maternal reprogramming (Figure 1). To address this hypothesis directly, we condi-
tionally deleted Kdm1a maternally in mouse oocytes using three separate Cre drivers. Deletion of
Kdm1a in developing oocytes via Gdf9-Cre or Zp3-Cre completely eliminates maternal KDM1A and
results in embryonic arrest prior to the blastocyst stage, with the vast majority of embryos never
developing past the 2C stage (Figures 1,2). This result is also observed when a second conditional
Kdm1a allele (Zhu et al., 2014) is deleted with Zp3-Cre in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al..
Thus, maternal KDM1A is essential for the progression of mammalian embryogenesis.
The observed 1-2C embryonic arrest does not rule out an additional role for KDM1A in oocyte
maturation, as we observe that a small fraction of KDM1A deficient oocytes are unfertilized, fertilized
with multiple sperm, or display other gross morphological defects, including loss of the zona pellu-
cida. These occasional defects are also observed in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. Con-
sistent with this, Kim et al. have recently reported that deletion of a different conditional Kdm1a
allele with Zp3-Cre results in defects in meiotic progression (Kim et al., 2015). However, in contrast
to our results, Kim et al. find that most oocytes are affected and are not fertilized (Kim et al., 2015).

 It is not entirely clear why the phenotypes are slightly different, but it could reflect subtle differences
in the timing of deletion due to the use of different floxed alleles, or differences in strain back-
ground. Nevertheless, in Kdm1aGdf9 and Kdm1aZp3 mutants, we find that the majority of oocytes are
fertilized normally, and many embryos undergo cleavage to reach the 2C stage (Figure 2). Also, in
hypomorphic Kdm1aVasa animals we observe defects on the paternal allele of imprinted loci (Fig-
ure 6). These results suggest a requirement for KDM1A post-fertilization in the zygote. In mammals,
zygotic
transcription

between
the
one
and
two
cell
stage
(Aoki
et
al.,
1997;
Hamatani et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2013). As a result, the heterozygous offspring derived from our
crosses likely begin to express KDM1A from paternal allele at the 2C stage. Taken together, these
results pinpoint a requirement for maternal KDM1A reprogramming between fertilization and cleav-
age. Consistent with this conclusion, the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. demonstrates that
chemically inhibiting KDM1A function post-fertilization also results in a 2C arrest. This further sug-
gests a zygotic requirement for KDM1A immediately post-fertilization.
When Kdm1a is deleted with Gdf9-Cre, only one embryo reached the 2C stage. In contrast, when
Kdm1a is deleted with Zp3-Cre, many embryos cleave to the 2C stage and we even observe rare
embryos that reach the 3C and 4C stage (Figure 2). This slight difference in phenotype is likely due
to the fact that the Gdf9-Cre acts earlier than the Zp3-Cre. Nevertheless, the difference in pheno-
type suggests that KDM1A may act maternally at multiple discrete steps. This conclusion is rein-
forced by the recent demonstration that loss of KDM1A also impairs meiotic progression (Kim et al.,
2015). Importantly, the observation that many maternally deleted embryos undergo cleavage, sug-
gests that KDM1A is not just required for cell-cycle progression or cell viability (Figure 2). This con-
clusion is consistent with the observation that KDM1A null embryos survive until e8 (Wang et al.,
2007). Furthermore, the difference in phenotype between maternally deleted embryos and embry-
onically deleted embryos, which survive to e8, clearly delineates the maternal requirement for
KDM1A from the embryonic requirement.
To determine the potential cause of the KDM1A maternal embryonic arrest, we profiled the
expression of Kdm1afl/fl oocytes and Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ embryos that underwent cleavage to the 2C
stage. Compared to control 2C embryos that have robustly activated the zygotic transcriptional pro-
gram, Kdm1aZp3 M-Z+ 2C embryos retain the expression of nearly 2 out of 3 oocyte genes, and fail
to activate approximately 4 out of 5 zygotically activated embryonic genes (Figure 3). This indicates
that maternally deleted Kdm1a embryos fail to undergo the MZT. Consistent with this being the pri-
mary defect in Kdm1aZp3 mutants, we observe relatively few transcriptional changes in Kdm1afl/fl
oocytes (Figure 3). The requirement for KDM1A in facilitating the MZT is also demonstrated in the
accompanying paper by Ancelin et al., where it is shown that maternal KDM1A is necessary for the
multiple waves of zygotic gene activation. Thus, we propose that KDM1A plays a major role in facili-
tating the progression of embryogenesis by enabling the MZT.
Surprisingly, in Kdm1aVasa oocytes, we found an incomplete loss of KDM1A protein, despite the
fact that 100% of the progeny inherited the deleted Kdm1a allele (Figure 1). We have previously
observed that strain background differences and/or specific interactions between Cre drivers and
certain floxed alleles can lead to different patterns of deletion, often not matching published pat-
terns. Thus, it is possible that Kdm1aVasa oocytes have a small amount of KDM1A remaining because
the Vasa-Cre transgene occasionally works much later than previously reported when crossed with
the Kdm1a floxed allele.
Similar to Kdm1aZp3 and Kdm1aGdf9 M-Z+ embryos, many of the hypomorphic Kdm1aVasa M-Z+
embryos undergo early embryonic arrest (Figure 4). However, the partial loss of KDM1A maternal
reprogramming also uncovers a hypomorphic phenotype where a few embryos survive past the 2C
stage until birth (Figures 4–6). Of these animals that are born, a significantly increased fraction die

 perinatally (Figure 4). Furthermore, on the rare occasions that more than one animal was born from
Kdm1aVasa mutant mothers, the full litter either all died perinatally or all survived. Remarkably, the
perinatal lethal pups are derived from crosses between Kdm1aVasa mothers and wild-type fathers
(M-Z+). This suggests that the increased perinatal lethality is due to hypomorphic maternal KDM1A
in the mother’s oocyte. It remains possible that the small Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ litter sizes also contribute
to the perinatal lethality, due to maternal neglect. However, many Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ animals that are
born in small litters survive to adulthood (Table 1). This suggests that the perinatal lethality is not
simply due to small litter size.
It is possible that subtle defects in maternal KDM1A reprogramming could also lead to behavioral
abnormalities in the surviving adults. To investigate this possibility, we performed a number of
behavioral assays on surviving Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ adult animals. These include monitoring food disap-
pearance and bedding height to measure excessive food grinding, the marble burying assay to mea-
sure excessive digging behavior, and the open-field test, to measure anxiety. In all of these assays,
we observe a maternal effect on behavior due to hypomorphic maternal KDM1A from Kdm1aVasa
mothers (Figure 5). This suggests that hypomorphic KDM1A in the mother’s oocyte can lead to
altered behavior in the resulting adult progeny.
To investigate the potential molecular nature of the heritable defects, we analyzed DNA methyla-
tion and expression at imprinted loci. Both DNA methylation and expression are altered at imprinted
genes in perinatal lethal Kdm1aVasa pups. In particular, we observe a striking disruption in the allele-
specific expression of both Zac1 and Impact, along with decreased expression and altered DNA
methylation at other imprinted loci (Figure 6). This suggests that subtle defects in maternal KDM1A
can alter the epigenetic landscape in a heritable fashion. Also, though KDM1A and KDM1B may
have some functional overlap, the distinct imprinting defects observed in each mutant demonstrate
that they have functions that are not redundant (Ciccone et al., 2009; Stewart et al., 2015). Inter-
estingly, both Zac1 and Impact have been associated with nervous system defects, and loss of Zac1
paternally results in perinatal lethality (Chung et al., 2011; Kosaki et al., 2001; Pereira et al., 2005;
Roffe et al., 2013; Schmidt-Edelkraut et al., 2014; Varrault et al., 2006). Thus, it is tempting to
speculate that defects in these genes could potentially contribute to the abnormalities that we
observe in Kdm1aVasa M-Z+ progeny. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if this is the case.
Loss of maternal KDM1A could lead to the observed phenomena (imprinting defects, perinatal
lethality and behavioral abnormalities) either directly or indirectly. Evidence for an indirect mecha-
nism can be inferred from the misregulation of several genes (Dnmt1, Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57, Uhrf1
and Dppa/Stella) that are known to regulate epigenetic information. For example, Tet1/Tet2 double
mutants exhibit a partial perinatal lethality phenotype that is reminiscent of what we observe in
Kdm1aVasa progeny (Dawlaty et al., 2013). Also, mice that are haploinsufficient for Trim28 display
abnormal exploratory behaviors (Whitelaw et al., 2010). Alternatively, KDM1A may affect these
phenomena by directly regulating histone methylation. For example, the removal of H3K4 methyla-
tion may be required to enable the activity of the DNMT3a/3b de novo methyltransferase complex
(Ooi et al., 2007). Such a model has been proposed to account for the imprinting defects that are
observed when KDM1B is maternally deleted (Ciccone et al., 2009; Stewart et al., 2015). Consis-
tent with this model, the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. demonstrates that loss of KDM1A
maternally leads to global changes in both H3K4 and H3K9 methylation following fertilization. How-
ever, Stewart et al. recently demonstrated that loss of maternal KDM1A in mice does not affect
H3K4me2, or the acquisition of DNA methylation at imprinted genes (Stewart et al., 2015). More-
over, the variable disruption of imprinting that we observe in hypomorphic animals is more consis-
tent with a general disruption of epigenetic information. Thus, we favor a model in which the
general disruption of epigenetic reprogramming, along with secondary epigenetic defects due to
the misregulation of epigenetic reprogramming enzymes during the MZT, combine to give rise to
the phenomena that manifest postnatally in progeny. Currently, we are engineering a hypomorphic
maternal Kdm1a allele that can be used to generate larger numbers of hypomorphic animals to fur-
ther elucidate these mechanisms.
In summary, our data highlights three important consequences of the loss of maternal KDM1A:
(1) early embryonic arrest and the failure of embryos to undergo the MZT, (2) perinatal lethality and
altered behavior in rare surviving progeny from hypomorphic mothers, and (3) a general disruption
of genomic imprinting in the hypomorphic progeny (Figure 7). Although these individual pheno-
types may be linked, it is possible that they are separate outcomes that depend on distinct activities

 of maternal KDM1A during the MZT. Nevertheless, our results establish a novel mammalian para-
digm in which altered epigenetic reprogramming by a histone demethylase between generations
leads to defects that manifest weeks later, highlighting the potential long-range consequences of
epigenetic perturbations in the early mammalian embryo.

Generation of KDM1A oocyte-specific mutant females
The following mouse strains were used: Kdm1a/Lsd1fl/fl MGI: 3711205 (Wang et al., 2007), Gdf9-
Cre MGI: 3056522 (Lan et al., 2004), Ddx4/Vasa-Cre MGI: 3757577 (Gallardo et al., 2007), and
Zp3-Cre MGI: 2176187 (de Vries et al., 2000) animals. To generate Kdm1a oocyte conditional
knockout mice, Kdm1a/Lsd1fl/fl females were crossed to transgenic Cre males to generate Kdm1a/
Figure 7. Model. Loss of maternal LSD1 results in defects later in development in wild-type oocytes, after
fertilization (denoted by blue sperm encircling oocyte) the fertilized egg undergoes the maternal to zygotic
transition (MZT; green to blue/purple) at the 1–2 cell stage. These M+Z+ embryos proceed normally through
development (indicated by blastocyst, perinatal stage pup, and adult mouse). In contrast, when Lsd1 is deleted
with either Gdf9- or Zp3-Cre, the resulting Lsd1Gdf9 and Lsd1Zp3 progeny become arrest at the 1–2 cell stage
and never undergo the MZT (green). When Lsd1 is deleted with Vasa-Cre, we observe 3 hypomorphic outcomes in
resulting Lsd1Vasa progeny: (1) developmental arrest at the 1–2 cell stage, (2) perinatal lethality and (3) abnormal
behavior in surviving adult animals. These outcomes are due to reduced LSD1 in the mothers oocyte, suggesting
that lowered maternal LSD1 can result in defects much later in development. These long-range outcomes are
associated with imprinting defects (depicted as wild-type versus mutant changes in DNA methylation within the
yellow region).

 Isolation of pre-implantation mouse embryos
To establish phenotypes in KDM1A maternal mutants, timed matings were set up between control/
mutant females and wild-type males. Superovulation was found to have little affect on phenotypes,
so we used superovulation to collect enough embryos for RNA-seq. For super-ovulation, PMSG was
injected into sexually mature females on day 1. After 48 hr, females were injected with HcG and sub-
sequently housed with stud males. Confirmation of natural or superovulatory matings on subsequent
days was made via observation of a copulation plug. 1–2 cell embryos were flushed from ovarian
tract at embryonic day 1.5 (e1.5), morulae on e2.5 and blastocysts on e3.5. Flushed embryos were
categorized and imaged.
Immunofluorescence
Isolated mouse ovaries were fixed for 1 hr in 4% PFA on ice then washed with PBS multiple times
over a 2 hr period. Ovaries were allowed to sit in 30% sucrose solution at 4˚C overnight and were
then embedded in OCT compound. 10 micron cryosections were obtained for analysis. Immunos-
taining was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-KDM1A (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge UK, ab17721)
and Alexa fluor conjugated secondary antibodies.
Immunohistochemistry
Isolated mouse ovaries were fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Ovaries were then dehydrated in the follow-
ing series of steps: 70% ethanol for 20 min 3 times; 85% ethanol for 45 min 2 times; 95% ethanol for
1 hr; 100% for 1 hr; xylenes overnight; xylenes:paraffin mix for 2 hr twice under vacuum; paraffin for
4 hr under vacuum; and paraffin under vacuum overnight. Oocytes were embedded in paraffin and
10 micron sections were taken for analysis. Immunostaining was performed using rabbit polyclonal
anti-KDM1A (1:500, Abcam, ab17721). Oocytes were scored for presence of KDM1A signal with
qualitative comparison to wild-type oocyte signal.
Bisulfite analysis
DNA was isolated from sagittal sections of each perinatal pup. Bisulfite conversion was performed
according to the Zymo (Irvine, CA) EZ DNA Methylation Kit protocol. Primer sets and polymorphisms
used are listed in Table 1. The BiQ Analyzer program was used in the analysis of bisulfite converted
sequences (Bock et al., 2005).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
RNA was isolated from sagittal sections of each perinatal pup using Trizol. SuperScript� III first-
strand synthesis system was used to generate cDNA. The following cycling conditions were used:
95˚C for 3 min, 95˚C for 15 sec, 60˚C for 30 sec, 72˚C for 30 sec, 50 cycles.

as
described
(Macfarlan et al., 2012). Briefly embryos were lysed in Prelude Direct Lysis buffer (Nugen, San Car-
los, CA) and amplified cDNAs were prepared using the Ovation RNA-seq system V2 (Nugen, 7102-
32). Paired end libraries were prepared according to the Tru-seq library construction protocol start-
ing with Covaris fragmentation step. Libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina Hi-seq 2000. For
expression analysis, only first mate pair was used and reads were trimmed from 3’ end to 50 bp.
Trimmed reads were filtered to a minimum average base quality of 15. We combined the known-
Gene, ensGene and refGene annotations for mm10 (downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser) with
the full RepeatMasker annotation, also from UCSC Genome Browser, to build a single gene annota-
tion. Redundant transcripts were filtered out using the gffread utility packaged with Cufflinks. The
annotation was modified to include a common gene_id value for same-name repeat elements result-
ing in a total of 875 repeats. Sequences for all annotated features were extracted from the mouse
genome and RNA-Seq reads were aligned to them using BBMap with 95% identity, up to a single
INDEL and up to 2000 equally best alignments per read. Alignments to features were quantified by
counting hits to gene loci and down-weighting read alignments that mapped to multiple gene loci
by 1/N2 where N is equal to the number of gene loci. Reads aligned to repeat elements were

 counted in the same way but instead of using gene loci the repeat name was used for binning hits. If
a read mapped to multiple repeat features all of the same name then it was counted as 1 hit to that
repeat name. Raw read counts were loaded into R and median normalized for differential expression
analysis. For each pair-wise test genes with raw counts less than 10 in all conditions were not tested.
Differential expression was performed by testing the null hypothesis that a gene’s fold change
between conditions is zero. The observed dispersion-mean relationship was fit using a method simi-
lar to that of DESeq and the predicted dispersions were used as the minimum dispersion per gene.
Fold-changes between conditions were tested by monte-carlo simulation using the observed and
estimated means and dispersions to generate random negative binomial distributed count values
(the rnbinom method in R). In each monte-carlo iteration N samples were simulated per condition (N
= to the number of samples in each condition), averaged into conditions and the log fold-change
was calculated. The resulting simulated log fold-change distributions are normally distributed. Z-
scores were computed for each observed log fold-change compared to its corresponding monte-
carlo simulated fold-change distribution and translated to two-tail p-values against the normal prob-
ability distribution. Raw p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg correction. Genes
and repeats were tested together and marked significant if the adjusted p-value was less than 0.05.
RNA-seq data is deposited at GEO (GSE66547). Oocyte expression data used for comparisons was
previously deposited at GEO (GSE33923.) For the heat map plot, each gene found to be significantly
associated with PC1 is standardized relative to its mean and scaled relative to its variance (ie each
gene is scaled separately to improve visualization.) Each row is a gene which is standardized where
mean is zero with standard deviation is 1. This makes each row relative to its mean. The scale is rela-
tive to its variance. Rows are sorted by a clustering of the genes. Color scale is relative to mean
expression level per gene.
Characterization of food-grinding behavior in Kdm1aVasa adult progeny
Each animal was placed in a mouse housing unit (32.8 � 18.6 � 13.6 cm) with 5/8 inches of bedding.
Over an 6 day period, the height of the bedding was measured in inches. In addition, 400 grams of
standard mouse diet pellets was placed in each food hopper. The amount of food remaining in the
food hopper was weighed each day over a 3 day period.
Marble burying assay
A clean, transparent plastic cage (32.8 � 18.6 � 13.6 cm) was filled 4.5 cm deep with corncob bed-
ding material. 20 glass marbles (20 mm diameter) were evenly spaced in a 5 � 4 grid on the surface
of the bedding. During the testing phase, the mice were placed in the cage for 25 min and allowed
to explore. At the end of the testing phase, mice were removed from the cage and the number of
marbles that were buried 2/3 their height in the bedding were counted.
Open field test
Mice were placed in a clean, transparent plastic cage (55.5 � 32.5 � 19.5 cm) with grid lines marked
on bottom of cage. The center area was clearly marked for analysis (27 � 16.2 cm). After 10 min,
video was scored for number of times center area was crossed and amount of time spent in center
area.
