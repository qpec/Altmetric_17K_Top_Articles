The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a growing concern to global health and is exacerbated by the
lack of new antibiotics. To treat already pervasive MDR infections, new classes of antibiotics or antibiotic ad-
juvants are needed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a role during antibacterial action;
however, it is not yet understood whether ROS contribute directly to or are an outcome of bacterial lethality
caused by antibiotics. We show that a light-activated nanoparticle, designed to produce tunable flux of specific
ROS, superoxide, potentiates the activity of antibiotics in clinical MDR isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella
enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Despite the high degree of antibiotic resistance in these isolates, we observed
a synergistic interaction between both bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics with varied mechanisms of action
and our superoxide-producing nanoparticles in more than 75% of combinations. As a result of this potentiation, the
effective antibiotic concentration of the clinical isolates was reduced up to 1000-fold below their respective
sensitive/resistant breakpoint. Further, superoxide-generating nanoparticles in combination with ciprofloxacin
reduced bacterial load in epithelial cells infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and increased Caenorhabditis
elegans survival upon infection with S. enterica serovar Enteriditis, compared to antibiotic alone. This demonstration
highlights the ability to engineer superoxide generation to potentiate antibiotic activity and combat highly
drug-resistant bacterial pathogens.
INTRODUCTION
The high frequency of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections
and the lack of new antibiotics threaten the future of our health care
system as we approach a postantibiotic era (1–3). In 2013, antibiotic-
resistant infections in the United States cost an estimated $20 billion
in direct health care costs and an additional $35 billion in lost produc-
tivity (2). Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant (CRE)
Escherichia coli and extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)–producing
Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN) are severely antibiotic-resistant and were
recently designated priority 1 critical class bacterial pathogens in urgent
need of effective antibiotics by the World Health Organization (Fig. 1A
and table S1) (3). The gravity of the situation is highlighted by the fact
that clinical isolates of these strains have up to 1000-fold higher 50%
growth inhibition concentrations (GIC50) of antibiotic relative to sensitive/
resistant breakpoints recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Stan-
dard Institute (CLSI) for a range of antibiotics with different mecha-
nisms of action (Fig. 1A and Table 1). These trends show the urgent
need for the development of new antimicrobials that can treat or poten-
tiate current antibiotics against MDR bacteria. Here, we show the re-
sponse of clinical isolates to multiple classes of antibiotics including a
third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) that targets cell-wall syn-
thesis and is bactericidal, a second-generation fluoroquinolone (cipro-
floxacin) that inhibits DNA topoisomerase II and is bactericidal, a
lincosamide(clindamycin)andchloramphenicolthatbothtargetprotein
synthesis and are bacteriostatic, and an aminoglycoside (streptomycin)
that targets protein synthesis and is bactericidal.
Recent studies indicate that the presence and level of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) during antibiotic treatment can increase anti-
biotic lethality (4–8), affect survival of persisters (4, 9), and contribute
to the development of drug resistance (10). ROS, including superoxide
radical •O2
–, peroxide O2
2–, and hydroxyl radicals •OH, are present in
bacteria at low levels during normal aerobic respiration and are miti-
gated by antioxidant defenses in bacteria including superoxide dismutase
(SOD) and catalase. However, at elevated levels, ROS can overwhelm
bacterial defenses and cause significant damage to DNA and iron sulfur
clusters, which reduces metalloenzyme activity (11). Here, we exploit the
toxic nature of ROS by using an engineered quantum dot (QD) nano-
particle to controllably produce intracellular superoxide and enhance our
ability to inhibit clinical MDR bacteria. We show that the engineered
production of intracellular superoxide leads to robust potentiation
of both bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics in a range of clinical
MDR bacteria despite their high level of resistance. Our work sheds
light on the current debate regarding whether ROS contribute directly
to or are a byproduct of bacterial lethality in the presence of antibiotics
(4–7, 9, 12), and provides support for the former hypothesis because of
the pathway topology inferred from synergistic interactions (13).
QDs are nanoparticles made of semiconducting materials that, when
illuminated with light, generate excited electrons and holes across their
nominal energy band gap (14), which are then available, at energy levels
specific to the engineered QD size and material, for reduction and ox-
idation (redox) reactions (Fig. 1B). Unlike photodynamic therapy that
uses light activation of different dyes and small molecules to produce
nonspecific ROS (15), engineered QDs with tailored redox potentials
allow for the generation of desired ROS that can perturb the cellular
redox environment (16). Because superoxide has been shown to be
the principal initial ROS with relatively longer radical lifetime and dif-
fusion lengths, which gives rise to a variety of physiologically relevant
primary and secondary reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (17), we devel-
oped a specific ROS perturbation approach using superoxide radicals.
In bacteria, superoxide disrupts enzyme iron sulfur clusters, resulting in

 an increased free ferrousiron pool (18). This free iron furtherlocalizes at
the DNA, proteins, and lipids, allowing Fenton chemistry to occur with-
in the diffusion lengths of hydroxyl radical for increased deleterious effects
fromROSspecies(19).Furthermore,itwasrecentlyshownthatenhancing

gene deletions potentiated antibiotic activity (20); however, this study was
constrained in the level of superoxide generation biologically possible in
E. coli. Here, we create a platform for potentiating antibiotic activity
without genetic manipulation, with concentration and stimuli-dependent
control of superoxide generation by designing a stimuli-responsive nano-
particle to produce specific ROS superoxide.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Generation of superoxide via engineered nanoparticles
We designed a cadmium telluride QD with a band gap energy of
2.4 eV (CdTe-2.4), whose oxidation potential is tuned for superoxide
production from molecular oxygen (fig. S1). The ROS produced by
CdTe-2.4 upon illumination were measured using electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. To identify short-lived radical species
produced by CdTe-2.4, we used 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide
(DMPO), a spin trapping reagent, whose resonance double bonds re-
act with oxygen-centered radicals to form more stable radical adducts
(Fig. 1C, left). These adducts were then exposed to a varied external
magnetic field to measure characteristic energy differences of unpaired
electron spins (21, 22). We measured CdTe-2.4 suspensions with and
without illumination to identify adducts produced via their characteristic
EPR spectra (see Materials and Methods) (14, 23). In the dark, CdTe-2.4
produced negligible unpaired spins or radical adducts, and values were
subtracted from the illuminated CdTe-2.4 spectra before analysis (fig. S1).
With illumination, CdTe-2.4 has characteristic superoxide and hydroxyl
signals (Fig. 1C, middle). Immediately following photoexcitation, a dom-
inant signal is observed from the superoxide radical (Fig. 1C, right).
As time progresses, the superoxide radicals dismute to form hydroxyl

 radicals in solution, and the EPR adducts observed are predominantly
hydroxyl (see Supplementary Discussion). We hypothesized that if the
CdTe-2.4 was only producing superoxide, then the addition of SOD,
an enzyme that dismutes superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (24), should
eliminate the EPR signal of superoxide and, as a consequence, hydroxyl
radical as well. With the addition of SOD, the EPR signal for both
superoxide and hydroxyl radical is quenched, confirming the direct
production of superoxide from CdTe-2.4 (Fig. 1C, middle). Further,
we argued that the addition of Fe(II) should provide a pathway for
hydrogen peroxide to dismute to hydroxyl radical through Fenton chem-
istry. As expected, with the addition of Fe(II) to SOD and CdTe-2.4,
we observe a recovery of hydroxyl radical signal. We further demon-
strated that with the same illumination, increased quantities of ROS
were produced with higher CdTe-2.4 concentrations (Fig. 1D). These
data indicate that illumination of CdTe-2.4 generates concentration-
and stimuli-dependent superoxide radicals, which allows us to con-
trollably increase the flux of superoxide in bacteria.
We investigated CdTe-2.4 superoxide generation intracellularly by
studying the response of an E. coli SOD B (sodB) deletion strain, as well
as an E. coli overexpressing sodB to treatment with CdTe-2.4. We found
that with the addition of CdTe-2.4, there is significant growth inhibition
in the sodB deletion strain compared to wild type (BW25113), whereas
the overexpression of sodB in E. coli had reduced growth inhibition rel-
ative tocontrol(E.coliMG1655withpZE21MCSplasmid).These results
indicate that SodB can modulate the phototoxic effects of CdTe-2.4 and
further supports the idea that superoxide radical stress isthe antibacterial
mechanism (Fig. 1, E and F, and fig. S2). These data also suggest that
CdTe-2.4 particles produce superoxide intracellularly, given that the
small size (<3 nm) of CdTe-2.4 (fig. S1) is amenable to transport across
bacterial cell membranes, that SodB is an established cytosolic enzyme
specific to superoxide, and that under physiological conditions, super-
oxide radical does not cross Gram-negative cellular membranes (25).
This is also supported by the lack of response from the SodC mutant,
given that it is localized in the periplasmic space (fig. S2A). After
confirming intracellular superoxide production by CdTe-2.4 upon il-
lumination, we investigated whether light-activated CdTe-2.4 acti-
vates a ROS sensor, 2′,7′-dicholorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA),
in three Gram-negative MDR clinical isolates: a CRE E. coli, an ESBL-
producing strain of KPN, and an MDR strain of Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhimurium (STm). Exposure to light-activated CdTe-2.4
stimulates conversion of DCFH-DA to a green fluorescent product
(Fig. 1G and fig. S2B) consistent with oxidation by ROS (26). These
results further indicate that light-activated CdTe-2.4 particles increase
intracellular ROS.
Potentiation of antibiotics in MDR clinical isolates
Given that CdTe-2.4 produces intracellular superoxide in Gram-negative
pathogens, we hypothesized that it would increase bacterial inhibition
when used in combination with antibiotics. We performed checkerboard-
style assays with the set of bactericidal (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and
streptomycin) and bacteriostatic (clindamycin and chloramphenicol)
antibiotics of varied mechanisms of action mentioned above and CdTe-
2.4 (12.5, 25, or 50 nM). Five concentrations of each antibiotic were tested
for every strain and were determined specific to the isolate’s antibiotic
GIC50 to survey concentrations above and below the sensitive/resistant
breakpoint and antibiotic GIC50 (Fig. 1A, figs. S3 to S7, and table S2), with
a total of 480 unique treatment conditions measured in biological tripli-
cates. All four clinical isolates had increased sensitivity to one or more
antibiotics in the presence of light-activated CdTe-2.4 superoxide gen-
eration (Fig. 2A and figs. S8 to S13).
We evaluated the combinatorial nature of antibiotic and CdTe-
2.4 using the Bliss Independence model (27). The S parameter dic-
tates deviation from no interaction and is defined as S ¼

, where ODAB is the optical density (OD) at 8 hours
in antibiotic only, OD0 is the OD at 8 hours in no treatment, ODQD is
the OD at 8 hours in only CdTe-2.4, and ODAB,QD is the OD at 8 hours
in the combination of antibiotic and CdTe-2.4 (Fig. 2B) (27). Combi-
nations were removed from the analysis if the OD of bacteria in either
monotherapy did not reach 0.1 by 8 hours. We observed synergy (S > 0)
between antibiotics and CdTe-2.4 in 76.4% of all combinations tested
(n = 271), with greater than 95% confidence in 41% of the cases (Fig. 2,
B and C, and fig. S14). With both bactericidal and bacteriostatic anti-
biotics, the degree of potentiation increased (S >> 0) with increasing
doses of CdTe-2.4, highlighting that antibiotic potentiation can im-
prove with higher superoxide flux (Fig. 2C and fig. S14). Antagonism
(S < 0) was observed in a few cases where the monotherapy concen-
tration was ineffective, consistent with previous studies demonstrating
that the type and strength of antibiotic interactions are dose-dependent
(fig. S14) (28). The distribution of S values across all conditions was
significantly greater than 0, as indicated by a right-tailed t test (P <
0.001) (Fig. 2C). The synergistic effect results in the antibiotic GIC50
of many clinical isolates dropping below the sensitive/resistant
breakpoint values of antibiotic with the addition of CdTe-2.4 (Fig.
2D). In cases of streptomycin-treated ESBL KPN and MDR Salmonella
Typhimurium, the GIC50 goes to 100-fold below the breakpoint, dem-
onstrating a strong potentiation of antibiotic activity. These data in-
dicate that superoxide potentiates both bactericidal and bacteriostatic
antibiotics with a broad range of mechanisms across diverse Gram-
negative pathogens.

 Reduction of bacterial load in the infection models with the
addition of stimuli-activated superoxide
To establish whether CdTe-2.4 potentiates antibiotic activity not only in
broth but also during infection, we investigated a tissue culture and an
animal model system. Intestinalepithelial cells are infected by S. enterica
in gut-associated and systemic infections, are permissive for uncon-
trolled S. enterica growth in culture, and have little endogenous or
inducible ROS activity (29). To test whether CdTe-2.4 potentiates cip-
rofloxacin, we infected HeLa cells (epithelial cells) with STm [strain
SL1344 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the chromo-
some (30)] (Fig. 3A), treated with monotherapy or combinatorial ther-
apy, and then lysed the HeLa cells after 18 hours of infection to
enumerate intraepithelial colony-forming units (CFU). All CdTe-2.4
concentrations used were minimally lethal to HeLa cells, as determined
with a lactate dehydrogenase release assay and MitoTracker staining
(fig. S15). CdTe-2.4 significantly reduced CFU at concentrations of
80 nM and higher, suggesting that CdTe-2.4 could be a useful mono-
therapy for intracellular infection (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Ciprofloxacin has
high efficacy against SL1344 and, for combinatorial experiments, was set
at 0.06125 mg/ml, which alone reduced bacterial load 50-fold (Fig. 3B).
Incubation of infected HeLa cells with a dosage range of CdTe-2.4 in
combination with ciprofloxacin (0.06125 mg/ml) significantly reduced
recoverable bacteria compared to ciprofloxacin treatment alone (P <
0.05; Fig. 3, C and D). To test the effectiveness against extracellular
pathogens, such as those involved in wound and burn infections, we
treated a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA). We demonstrate that chloramphenicol activity was increased
against MRSA upon the addition of 160 nM CdTe-2.4 in coculture with
HeLa cells (Fig. 3, E and F). The observed synergistic interactions in this
infection model (Fig. 3G) further highlight the ability of superoxide to
increase the sensitivity of a range of bacteria to antibiotic therapy.

the activity of antibiotics to allow for successful inhibition of 50% or greater at or below senstive (blue line)/resistant (red line) breakpoint values. The effect is seen as a sharp
decrease in GIC50 corresponding with the increased addition of CdTe-2.4.

 Salmonella Enteritidis–infected C. elegans survived infection. Mono-
therapy treatment with ciprofloxacin (0.5 mg/ml) or CdTe-2.4 (75 nM)
increased survival to 51.5 ± 1.0 and 49.2 ± 1.6%, respectively. However,
combinatorial therapy led to a 69 ± 5.0% survival rate of infected worms
(Fig. 3I). This additive interaction leads to a slight increase in survival
rate over monotherapy (P = 0.076 compared to antibiotic only and P =
0.063 compared to CdTe-2.4 only), which suggests that superoxide in
combination with an antibiotic could protect nematodes from bacte-
rial killing.
Light penetration for antibiotic potentiation
After investigating antibiotic potentiation in these two infection sys-
tems, we modeled light penetration through human skin and calculated
the skin depth at which antibiotic potentiation could occur. To deter-
mine the bacterial inhibition at various skin depths with combination
therapy, we used the light attenuation through human epidermal and
dermal layers of the skin, as measured in in vivo experiments (31), and
determined the superoxide flux from CdTe-2.4 at that light intensity.
On the basis of our measurements of CdTe-2.4 toxicity in human epi-
thelial cells (fig. S15), we chose a nontoxic concentration of 160 nM of
CdTe-2.4 for our calculations and assumed uniformly dispersed antibi-
otic and CdTe-2.4 photoexcited by light-emitting diode (LED) light at
520 nm (1.6 mW/cm2). This wavelength of green LED light has also been
shownusefulforwoundhealingatlowintensity(0.25to8mW/cm2)(32).

at higher light intensities and varied CdTe-2.4 concentrations also vali-
date the estimated increase in superoxide flux and the resulting increase
in bacterial growth inhibition (fig. S19). The estimated skin depths re-
quired for 50 and 75% growth inhibition within the skin (GIC50 and
GIC75 surfaces) demonstrate the potential of combination therapy with
an external LED sheet using CdTe-2.4 and antibiotic (Fig. 4B and fig.
S18). In addition, we estimated skin depths for 50 and 90% inhibition
(GIC50 or GIC90; Fig. 4C) at the respective CLSI resistance breakpoint
or lower antibiotic concentration for all antibiotics and MDR strains used
and found that sufficient light penetrates ~1 to 2 cm for CdTe-2.4 anti-
biotic potentiation. This model suggests that CdTe-2.4 and antibiotic
combinationtherapycouldbeusefulfortreatingskinandburninfections.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we established that superoxide generation potentiates
bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics against a range of MDR
Gram-negative clinical isolates despite their high drug resistance. We
highlight the utility of engineered stimuli-responsive nanoparticles to
produce the specific ROS of interest, namely, superoxide. We show
that combinatorial treatment inhibits MDR clinical isolates to levels
where the antibiotic GIC50 is below the clinical sensitive/resistant
breakpoint and, in some cases, 1000-fold lower. The synergy observed
in our study provides new insight into superoxide’s impact on

 bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotic lethality. The demonstration
of combinatorial therapy functioning additively, or in some cases syn-
ergistically, to outperform antibiotic monotherapy in two different in-
fection models, epithelial cell and nematode gut infection, further
highlights the potential to improve antibiotic efficacy with the addition
of superoxide generation. Considering the low absorption of light
through human skin at 520 nm and the significant antibiotic poten-
tiation obtainable at skin depths up to 1 to 2 cm, this demonstration
holds promise for the application of this technology for treating skin
infections and wound healing. Furthermore, a wide variety of tunable
nanomaterial parameters, including size, reduction, and oxidation po-
tentials, and surface moieties provide an opportunity to engineer tools
to control redox perturbation for mitigating multidrug resistance and
improving antibiotic efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
QD synthesis and characterization
CdTe-2.4 QDs were synthesized and filtered for experiments, as de-
scribed in the study by Courtney et al. (16). Size distribution analysis
of the used particles was obtained from transmission electron micro-
graphs (fig. S1) using ImageJ (d = 2.8 ± 0.3 nm). Images were acquired
using a Phillips CM 100 transmission electron microscope at an accel-
eration of 80 kV. Samples were prepared using Cu-Formvar grids,
which were made hydrophilic using a glow-discharge plasma treatment.
Culture conditions
For nonclinical isolate bacterial growth, liquid LB broth (2% LB; L3022,
Sigma-Aldrich) or solid LB (2% LB and 1.5% agar; 214010) was used for
allexperiments. For clinicalisolate growthliquid, cation-adjustedMueller
Hinton broth (CAMHB) (212322, Becton, Dickinson and Company)
or solid CAMHB (1.5% agar) was used. Dulbecco modified Eagle’s
medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%),
L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), b-mercaptoethanol
(50 mM), and Hepes (10 mM) was used for HeLa infection assays and
maintenance. All cells were incubated at 37°C during growth. HeLa
infection studies were carried out with 5% CO2, and liquid bacterial
cultures were grown with shaking at 225 rpm. Worms were grown on
solid nematode growth medium (NGM) [2.3% N1000 powder (United
States Biological), 25 mM phosphate buffer, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM
MgSO4] for propagation and during infection. Worms were grown
in liquid S medium {1 liter of S Basal [0.585% NaCl, 0.1% K2HPO4,
0.6% KH2PO4, and cholesterol (5 mg/liter)], 10 ml of 1 M potassium
citrate, 10 ml of trace metals solution, 3 ml of 1 M CaCl2, and 3 ml of
1 M MgSO4} during treatment.
Bacterial strains
Clinical strains were obtained from N. Madinger at the University of
Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and were stored in 10% glycerol
at –80°C for long-term storage. Biological replicates were started in liquid
medium from individual, single colonies off of solid plates and grown for
16hoursbefore starting the experiments.ODwasmeasuredwithaTecan
GENios at 562 nm with a bandwidth of 35 nm. All bacterial strains used
are in tables S1 and S3.
Cloning of sodB overexpression plasmid
The SodB gene, including the RBS, was cloned from the E. coli MG1655
genome and inserted to the Bam HI and Mlu I sites of the pZE21MCS
plasmid(EXPRESSYS)fortheexpressioninE.colibythePLtetO-1promoter.
The control plasmid was the pZE21MCS plasmid in E. coli MG1655 with-
out insert. Plasmids were cloned into chemically competent E. coli
MG1655 and maintained with kanamycin (25 mg/ml).
GIC50 measurement
Overnight cultures of clinical isolates were diluted to a 0.5 McFarland
standard in the media with respective test concentrations of antibiotic.
Cultures were grown for 24 hours in 384-well microplates. After 24 hours
of growth, Resazurin sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added,
and the reaction was monitored to measure fluorescence every 5 min
for 4 hours at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm using 485/610-nm filters.
The slope of Resazurin fluorescence was used as a quantitative measure
of cell metabolism. The GIC50 was determined as the lowest concentra-
tion of antibiotic that caused a 50% or greater reduction in slope com-
pared to the same biological replicate in no treatment. GIC50’s were
compared to sensitive/resistant breakpoints from 2016/2017 CLSI guide-
lines or literature (34, 35) shown in table S4.
Combinatorial experiments
Five antibiotic concentrations were chosen for each strain so that the
levels tested would be below the GIC50, near the CLSI or defined
breakpoint, and near the GIC50. Concentrations tested for each strain
can be seen in table S2, with breakpoints shown in table S4. Concentra-
tions of CdTe-2.4 were held constant for all strains at 12.5, 25, and 50 nM.
Using these metrics, three biological replicates were tested from each
strain with 15 combination test conditions as well as monotherapy
controls and a no-treatment condition. Clinical strains were diluted
1:100 from the overnight cultures, into the test condition. Optical density
was measured every 30 min for the first 3 hours and every hour sub-
sequently until 8 hours. The optical density at 8 hours normalized to
no treatment was used in the Bliss Independence model (27) to deter-
mine the combinatorial effect. We used optical density at 8 hours instead
of growth rate because of the two-phase growth many of our conditions
demonstrated, which yielded multiple growth rates. The optical
density at 8 hours was normalized to account for the difference
in starting cell viability and biological replicate colony variation.
C. elegans infection experiments
C. elegans CF512 [(fer-15(b26); fem-1(hc17)] were used for infection
experiments. CF512 do not replicate when grown at 25°C to allow for
control of the worm count and determination of live and dead popula-
tions from starting t = 0. E. coli op50 was used both as the food source
before infection and as the control strain during infection experiments.
During the treatment phase of infection experiments, worms were
suspended in standard liquid S medium, and all wash steps were carried
out with standard M9 buffer (36). NGM plates were seeded with E. coli
op50 or MDR strains by plating 100 ml of overnight culture onto NGM
and incubating at 37°C for 8 hours. Worms were chunked onto NGM
plates seeded with E. coli op50 and allowed to grow for 10 to 14 days at
15°C to allow for egg production. The eggs were then collected using
NaOH and bleach and transferred to NGM and incubated at 25°C.
After 24 hours, hatched worms were transferred to NGM seeded with
op50 and grown at 25°C to allow for adult worms to grow without re-
production for 48 hours. Adult worms were collected and washed twice
before being transferred to NGM seeded with infection strains. Infec-
tion on solid plates was carried out for 3 days. After infection, worms
were collected and washed three times (30 s at 600g) before being
transferred to S medium, with respective treatment conditions in 100 ml
of cultures in 96-well plates at 25°C to limit reproduction. Every 24 hours,

 worms were monitored for morphology, and the medium was changed
to refresh CdTe and antibiotic. At the end of the treatment period, worms
werestainedwith0.5mMSYTOXorange(S11368,ThermoFisherScientific)
for 30 min before imaging and counting. Images were acquired, and
counting was performed using an EVOS FL microscope and analyzed using
ImageJ. Forty-six clinical isolates were screened to choose the S. enterica
serovar Enteritidis strain used in experiments (S48; fig. S17).
EPR spectroscopy
For all EPR measurements, we used continuous-wave X-band EPR
spectroscopy. QD samples were prepared for EPR measurements by
filtering, as described above, and resuspended in water (pH 11). One
hundred microliters of this solution was then mixed with 1 ml of
DMPO (Dojindo) and sequestered from light exposure. Quartz capil-
laries were filled with the CdTe-DMPO mixture and measured in a
Bruker Elexsys E 500 spectrometer equipped with an SHQE resonator.
Exposure to ambient light was greatly minimized by preparing and
recording every measurement in a dark room. A dark background was
measured for each sample, which consisted of the average of 10 scans
using a 200-G scan range (0.05-G resolution) centered on 3515 G with
a microwave attenuation of 16 dB and power of 5 W and was subtracted
from the light signal as negligible (fig. S1). Time-dependent scans were
conducted over the same 200-G scan range (20.48 s) with a delay of
100 ms between scans. The SiO2 E′ defect was present in all measure-
ments but was subtracted during the analysis as part of the dark signal.
The sample was then exposed to 9-mW/cm2 white light and immediately
remeasured to obtain the photoactivated spectrum. For confirmation
of superoxide production, conditions were as follows: 10% (v/v) dimethyl
sulfoxide in double distilled water (DDW), 1 to 2 mg of the SOD
enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 ml of DDW, or the degassed water was
prepared by bubbling nitrogen through DDW for 1 hour. Each
spectrum containing multiple species was simulated using the SpinFit
module of the Bruker Xepr software (version 2.6b 149) to identify the
radical adducts. The initial fit parameters were as follows: DMPO-OH,
aN = 14.90 G and aH
b = 14.93 G; DMPO-OOH, aN = 14.2 G, aH
b =
11.4 G, and aH
g1 =1.2 G. By providing a fixed and known active sam-
ple volume in each capillary, the concentration of DMPO adducts was
calculated from the total number of spins detected using the Bruker
SpinFit software. This software-reported concentration corresponded
to the ROS generated multiplied by the number of capillaries in the cav-
ity. Concentrations of ROS species are reported above, in the main text,
for one capillary. Data in Fig. 1B (middle) are time-dependent EPR scan;
successive scans were each saved as slices, and we averaged the results of
the SpinFit from three replicate experiments. Data in Fig. 1B (right)
show 10 successive scans that were averaged to minimize error.
EPR was used to evaluate the effects of SOD and consequent hydroxyl
radical formation through Fenton chemistry. CdTe-2.4 was filtered and
washed as detailed above and redispersed in M9 medium to eliminate pH
effects when combined with SOD. The stock of SOD contained 1 mg/ml
of the enzyme and 0.1 M potassium phosphate. For the lysozyme control
in fig. S1, 1 mg/ml of lysozyme was used. A 1 M solution of ferrous iron
sulfate (FeSO4) in M9 was used as a source of iron. Spectra were first
measured in light and dark, as described above, for CdTe-2.4 alone.
The resulting spectra were smoothed using a five-point moving average
and are shown in Fig. 1C (middle).
DCFH-DA imaging
Respective strains were diluted 1:10 from overnight cultures into
CAMHB and treated with respective concentrations of CdTe-2.4 for
1 hour in dark or light. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with DCFH-DA and incubated for
5 min before cells were imaged on glass slides with coverslips on
an EVOS FL microscope. Images were processed identically for all
conditions using ImageJ.
Gentamicin protection assays
HeLa cells were seeded at 1.0 × 104 cells per well in 96-well tissue
culture plates and grown for 24 hours. STm wild-type strain SL1344
with chromosomal rpsM::GFP (30) was grown overnight, diluted 1:10,
and grown for 4 hours in LB before infections. Streptomycin antibiotic
selection was used at 30 mg/ml. Salmonella Typhimurium in Gibco PBS
was added at a multiplicity of infection of 30:1 (bacteria/HeLa) and
centrifuged for 5 min at 500g. After 45 min, cells were incubated for
a further 1.25 hours at 37°C in fresh medium supplemented with gen-
tamicin (40 mg/ml) to kill extracellular bacteria. Medium was then ex-
changed for fresh medium with treatment conditions supplemented
with gentamicin (40 mg/ml) to inhibit extracellular bacterial growth.
At 18 hours after infection, the wells were washed three times with
300 ml of PBS, and cells were lysed with 30 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100
for 15 min at room temperature. After 15 min, 270 ml of PBS was
added to each well (serving as 100-fold dilution), serially diluted, plated
onto 2% LB, 1.5% agar, and streptomycin (40 mg/ml), and then incu-
bated at 37°C for 16 hours to enumerate CFU per milliliter. For stain-
ing and imaging, wells were stained with 100 nM MitoTracker,
followed by fixation with 16% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Wells
were then washed twice with PBS, stained with DAPI for 20 min,
washed twice with PBS, and stored in 100 ml of 90% glycerol and 1×
PBS before imaging and/or storage at 4°C in dark. Images were
acquired using an EVOS FL microscope and analyzed using ImageJ.
S. aureus and HeLa coculture
HeLa cells were seeded as described above. MRSA was grown overnight
to saturation and added to HeLa at a multiplicity of infection of 5:1
(bacteria/HeLa) in medium supplemented with respective treatment
conditions. At 24 hours after infection, the wells were agitated using
pipetting, and 10 ml of the medium was transferred to PBS (serving at
10-fold dilution), serially diluted, plated on to 2% LB and 1.5% agar, and
incubated at 37°C for 16 hours to enumerate CFU per milliliter.
Lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay
HeLa cells were seeded as described above. Cells were treated with re-
spective conditions and incubated for 18 hours. Fifty microliters of the
supernatant was used to determine lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) re-
lease as a measure of cytotoxicity using the Pierce LDH cytotoxicity assay
kit. Cells lysed with the supplied lysis buffer served as a positive control.
Skin depth modeling
To estimate the penetration of light, excitation of CdTe-2.4, and poten-
tiation of antibiotics in skin, we used in vivo absorption coefficients of
the human skin, separated into epidermis and dermis, from Lister et al.
(31). The light source for calculations of skin depth was an LED sheet
with emission at 520 nm with an intensity of 1.6 mW/cm2. We assumed
that 160 nM CdTe-2.4 was dispersed in the skin, which had low toxicity
in our LDH assay of human epithelial cells (HeLa). The skin depths
where CdTe-2.4 superoxide flux and potentiation would be equal to
12.5, 25, and 50 nM in broth, 1.47, 1.32, and 1.16 cm, respectively, were
calculated and then used to graph GIC50 and GIC75 skin depth isosur-
faces (Fig. 4 and fig. S18). We then used an exponential decay fit for the
