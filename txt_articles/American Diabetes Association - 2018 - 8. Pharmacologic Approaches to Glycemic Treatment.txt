The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes”
includes ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide
the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools
to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, a
multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards
of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of
ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system
for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations, please refer to the Standards of Care

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR TYPE 1 DIABETES
Recommendations
c Most people with type 1 diabetes should be treated with multiple daily in-
jections of prandial insulin and basal insulin or continuous subcutaneous
insulin infusion. A
c Most individuals with type 1 diabetes should use rapid-acting insulin analogs to
reduce hypoglycemia risk. A
c Consider educating individuals with type 1 diabetes on matching prandial insulin
doses to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose levels, and anticipated
physical activity. E
c Individuals with type 1 diabetes who have been successfully using continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion should have continued access to this therapy after
they turn 65 years of age. E
Insulin Therapy
Insulin is the mainstay of therapy for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Generally,
the starting insulin dose is based on weight, with doses ranging from 0.4 to
1.0 units/kg/day of total insulin with higher amounts required during puberty.
The American Diabetes Association/JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook notes
0.5 units/kg/day as a typical starting dose in patients with type 1 diabetes who
are metabolically stable, with higher weight-based dosing required immediately
following presentation with ketoacidosis (1), and provides detailed information
on intensification of therapy to meet individualized needs. The American Diabetes
Association (ADA) position statement “Type 1 Diabetes Management Through
the Life Span” additionally provides a thorough overview of type 1 diabetes
treatment (2).

8. PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES TO GLYCEMIC TREATMENT
 Education regarding matching prandial
insulin dosing to carbohydrate intake,
premeal glucose levels, and anticipated
activity should be considered, and se-
lected individuals who have mastered
carbohydrate counting should be edu-
cated on fat and protein gram estimation
(3–5). Although most studies of multiple
daily injections versus continuous subcu-
taneous insulin infusion (CSII) have been
small and of short duration, a systematic
review and meta-analysis concluded that
there are minimal differences between
the two forms of intensive insulin therapy
in A1C (combined mean between-group
difference favoring insulin pump therapy
–0.30% [95% CI –0.58 to –0.02]) and se-
vere hypoglycemia rates in children and
adults (6). A 3-month randomized trial in
patients with type 1 diabetes with noctur-
nal hypoglycemia reported that sensor-
augmented insulin pump therapy with
the threshold suspend feature reduced
nocturnal hypoglycemia without increas-
ing glycated hemoglobin levels (7). The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has also approved the first hybrid closed-
loop system pump. The safety and effi-
cacy of hybrid closed-loop systems has
been supported in the literature in ado-
lescents and adults with type 1 diabetes
(8,9).
Intensive management using CSII and
continuous glucose monitoring should be
encouraged in selected patients when
there is active patient/family participa-
tion (10–12).
The Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial (DCCT) clearly showed that in-
tensive therapy with multiple daily
injections or CSII delivered by multidisci-
plinary teams of physicians, nurses, dieti-
tians, and behavioral scientists improved
glycemia and resulted in better long-term
outcomes (13–15). The study was carried
out with short-acting and intermediate-
acting human insulins. Despite better mi-
crovascular, macrovascular, and all-cause
mortality outcomes, intensive therapy
was associated with a high rate of severe
hypoglycemia(61episodesper100patient-
yearsoftherapy).SincetheDCCT,anumber
of rapid-acting and long-acting insulin an-
alogshave been developed. These analogs
are associated with less hypoglycemia,
less weight gain, and lower A1C than human
insulins in people with type 1 diabetes
(16–18). Longer-acting basal analogs
(U-300 glargine or degludec) may addi-
tionally convey a lower hypoglycemia risk
compared with U-100 glargine in patients
with type 1 diabetes (19,20).
Rapid-acting inhaled insulin used be-
fore meals in patients with type 1 diabe-
tes was shown to be noninferior when
compared with aspart insulin for A1Clow-
ering, with less hypoglycemia observed
with inhaled insulin therapy (21). How-
ever, the mean reduction in A1C was
greater with aspart (–0.21% vs. –0.40%,
satisfying the noninferiority margin of
0.4%), and more patients in the insulin
aspart group achieved A1C goals of
#7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and #6.5% (48
mmol/mol). Because inhaled insulin car-
tridges are only available in 4-, 8-, and
12-unit doses, limited dosing increments
to fine-tune prandial insulin doses in type 1
diabetes are a potential limitation.
Postprandial glucose excursions may
be better controlled by adjusting the tim-
ing of prandial (bolus) insulin dose admin-
istration. The optimal time to administer
prandial insulin varies, based on the type
of insulin used (regular, rapid-acting ana-
log, inhaled, etc.), measured blood glucose
level, timing of meals, and carbohydrate
consumption. Recommendations for pran-
dial insulin dose administration should
therefore be individualized.
Pramlintide
Pramlintide, an amylin analog, is an agent
that delays gastric emptying, blunts pan-
creatic secretion of glucagon, and en-
hances satiety. It is FDA-approved for use
in adults with type 1 diabetes. It has been
shown to induce weight loss and lower in-
sulin doses. Concurrent reduction of pran-
dial insulin dosing is required to reduce the
risk of severe hypoglycemia.
Investigational Agents
Metformin
Adding metformin to insulin therapy may
reduce insulin requirements and improve
metabolic control in patients with type 1
diabetes. In one study, metformin was
found to reduce insulin requirements
(6.6 units/day, P , 0.001), and led to
small reductions in weight and total and
LDL cholesterol but not to improved gly-
cemic control (absolute A1C reduction
0.11%, P 5 0.42) (22). A randomized clin-
ical trial similarly found that, among over-
weight adolescents with type 1 diabetes,
the addition of metformin to insulin did
not improve glycemic control and in-
creased risk for gastrointestinal adverse
events after 6 months compared with
placebo(23).TheReducingWithMetformin
VascularAdverse Lesionsin Type1 Diabetes
(REMOVAL) trial investigated the addition
of metformin therapy to titrated insulin
therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes at
increased risk for cardiovascular disease
and found that metformin did not signifi-
cantly improve glycemic control beyond
the first 3 months of treatment and that
progression of atherosclerosis (measured
by carotid artery intima-media thickness)
was not significantly reduced, although
other cardiovascular risk factors such as
body weight and LDL cholesterol im-
proved (24). Metformin is not FDA-
approved for use in patients with type 1
diabetes.
Incretin-Based Therapies
Due to their potential protection of b-cell
massandsuppressionofglucagonrelease,
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor
agonists (25) and dipeptidyl peptidase
4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (26) are being studied
in patients with type 1 diabetes but are
not currently FDA-approved for use in pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes.
Sodium–Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors
Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors provide insulin-independent
glucose lowering by blocking glucose re-
absorptionintheproximalrenal tubule by
inhibiting SGLT2. These agents provide
modest weight loss and blood pressure
reduction in type 2 diabetes. There are
three FDA-approved agents for patients
with type 2 diabetes, but none are FDA-
approved for the treatment of patients
with type 1 diabetes (2). SGLT2 inhibitors
may have glycemic benefits in patients
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes on insulin
therapy (27). The FDA issued a warning
about the risk of ketoacidosis occurring
in the absence of significant hyperglyce-
mia (euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis)
in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabe-
tes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.
Symptoms of ketoacidosis include dysp-
nea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain. Patients should be instructed to
stop taking SGLT2 inhibitors and seek
medical attention immediately if they
have symptoms or signs of ketoacidosis
(28).
SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR
TYPE 1 DIABETES
Pancreas and Islet Transplantation
Pancreas and islet transplantation have
been shown to normalize glucose levels

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

 but require life-long immunosuppression
to prevent graft rejection and recurrence
of autoimmune islet destruction. Given
the potential adverse effects of immuno-
suppressive therapy, pancreas transplan-
tation should be reserved for patients
with type 1 diabetes undergoing simulta-
neous renal transplantation, following re-
nal transplantation, or for those with
recurrent ketoacidosis or severe hypogly-
cemia despite intensive glycemic man-
agement (29).
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR
TYPE 2 DIABETES
Recommendations
c Metformin, if not contraindicated
and if tolerated, is the preferred ini-
tial pharmacologic agent for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. A
c Long-term use of metformin may be
associated with biochemical vitamin
B12 deficiency, and periodic mea-
surementofvitaminB12levelsshould
be considered in metformin-treated
patients, especially in those with ane-
mia or peripheral neuropathy. B
c Consider initiating insulin therapy
(with or without additional agents)
in patients with newly diagnosed
type 2 diabetes who are symptom-
atic and/or have A1C $10% (86
mmol/mol) and/or blood glucose
levels $300mg/dL (16.7mmol/L).E
c Consider initiating dual therapy in
patients with newly diagnosed
type 2 diabetes who have A1C
$9% (75 mmol/mol). E
c In patients without atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, if mono-
therapy or dual therapy does not
achieve or maintain the A1C goal
over 3 months, add an additional
antihyperglycemic agent based on
drug-specific and patient factors
(Table 8.1). A
c A patient-centered approach should
be used to guide the choice of
pharmacologic agents. Consider-
ations include efficacy, hypoglyce-
mia risk, history of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, impact on
weight, potential side effects, re-
nal effects, delivery method (oral
versus subcutaneous), cost, and
patient preferences. E
c In patients with type 2 diabetes and
established atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease, antihyperglycemic
therapy should begin with lifestyle
management and metformin and
subsequently incorporate an agent
proven to reduce major adverse car-
diovascular events and cardiovascu-
lar mortality (currently empagliflozin
and liraglutide), after considering
drug-specific and patient factors
(Table 8.1). A*
c In patients with type 2 diabetes and
established atherosclerotic cardiovascu-
lar disease, after lifestyle management
and metformin, the antihyperglycemic
agent canagliflozin may be considered
to reduce major adverse cardiovascular
events, based on drug-specific and pa-
tient factors (Table 8.1). C*
c Continuousreevaluationofthemed-
ication regimen and adjustment as
needed to incorporate patient fac-
tors (Table 8.1) and regimen com-
plexity is recommended. E
c For patients with type 2 diabetes
whoarenotachievingglycemicgoals,
drug intensification, including consid-
eration of insulin therapy, should not
be delayed. B
c Metformin should be continued
whenusedincombinationwithother
agents,includinginsulin,ifnotcontra-
indicated and if tolerated. A
See Section 12 for recommendations
specific for children and adolescents
with type 2 diabetes. The use of metfor-
min as first-line therapywas supported by
findings from a large meta-analysis, with
selection of second-line therapies based
on patient-specific considerations (30).
An ADA/European Association for the Study
of Diabetes position statement “Manage-
ment of Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabe-
tes, 2015: A Patient-Centered Approach”
(31) recommended a patient-centered ap-
proach, including assessment of efficacy,
hypoglycemia risk, impact on weight, side
effects, costs, and patient preferences. Re-
nal effects may also be considered when
selecting glucose-lowering medications for
individual patients. Lifestyle modifications
thatimprovehealth(seeSection4“Lifestyle
Management”) should be emphasized
along with any pharmacologic therapy.
Initial Therapy
Metformin monotherapy should be
started at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes un-
less there are contraindications. Metfor-
min is effective and safe, is inexpensive,
and may reduce risk of cardiovascular
events and death (32). Compared with
sulfonylureas, metformin as first-line
therapy has beneficial effects on A1C,
weight, and cardiovascular mortality
(33). Metformin may be safely used in
patients with estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) as low as 30 mL/min/
1.73 m2, and the FDA recently revised
the label for metformin to reflect its
safety in patients with eGFR $30 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (34). Patients should be ad-
vised to stop the medication in cases of
nausea, vomiting, or dehydration. Met-
formin is associated with vitamin B12
deficiency, with a recent report from the
Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes
Study (DPPOS) suggesting that periodic
testing of vitamin B12 levels should be
considered in metformin-treated pa-
tients, especially in those with anemia
or peripheral neuropathy (35).
In patients with metformin contrain-
dications or intolerance, consider an ini-
tial drug from another class depicted in
Fig. 8.1 under “Dual Therapy” and pro-
ceed accordingly. When A1C is $9% (75
mmol/mol), consider initiating dual com-
bination therapy (Fig. 8.1) to more expe-
ditiously achieve the target A1C level.
Insulin has the advantage of being effec-
tive where other agents may not be and
should be considered as part of any com-
bination regimen when hyperglycemia is
severe, especially if catabolic features
(weight loss, ketosis) are present. Con-
sider initiating combination insulin in-
jectable therapy (Fig. 8.2) when blood
glucose is $300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) or
A1C is $10% (86 mmol/mol) or if the pa-
tient has symptoms of hyperglycemia
(i.e., polyuria or polydipsia). As the pa-
tient’s glucose toxicity resolves, the regi-
men may, potentially, be simplified.
Combination Therapy
Although there are numerous trials
comparing dual therapy with metformin
alone, few directly compare drugs as add-
on therapy. A comparative effectiveness
meta-analysis (36) suggests that each
new class of noninsulin agents added to
initial therapy generally lowers A1C ap-
proximately 0.7–1.0%. If the A1C target
isnotachievedafterapproximately3months
and patient does not have atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), consider
a combination of metformin and any one
of the preferred six treatment options:
sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP-4

 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor
agonist,orbasalinsulin(Fig. 8.1); the choice
of which agent to add is based on drug-
specific effects and patient factors (Table
8.1). For patients with ASCVD, add a
second agent with evidence of cardiovas-
cular risk reduction after consideration of
drug-specific and patient factors (see p. S77
CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMESTRIALS). If A1C target
is still not achieved after ;3 months of
dual therapy, proceed to a three-drug
combination (Fig. 8.1). Again, if A1C target
is not achieved after ;3 months of triple
therapy, proceed to combination injectable
therapy (Fig. 8.2). Drug choice is based on
Figure 8.1—Antihyperglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetes: generalrecommendations. *If patientdoes not tolerateor hascontraindications tometformin,
consider agents from another class in Table 8.1. #GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors should not be prescribed in combination. If a patient with
ASCVD is not yet on an agent with evidence of cardiovascular risk reduction, consider adding.

with the goal of reducing blood glucose
levels while minimizing side effects, espe-
cially hypoglycemia. If not already in-
cluded in the treatment regimen, addition
of an agent with evidence of cardiovas-
cular risk reduction should be consid-
ered in patients with ASCVD beyond
dual therapy, with continuous reevalu-
ation of patient factors to guide treat-
ment (Table 8.1).

 were utilized to provide two separate mea-
sures to allow for a comparison of drug
prices with the primary goal of highlighting
the importance of cost considerations
when prescribing antihyperglycemic treat-
ments. The ongoing Glycemia Reduction
Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Ef-
fectiveness Study (GRADE) will compare
four drug classes (sulfonylurea, DPP-4 in-
hibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and basal
insulin) when added to metformin therapy
over 4 years on glycemic control and other
medical,psychosocial, and health economic
outcomes (41).
Rapid-actingsecretagogues(meglitinides)
may be used instead of sulfonylureas in
patients with sulfa allergies or irregular
meal schedules or in those who develop
late postprandial hypoglycemia when
taking a sulfonylurea. Other drugs not
shown in Table 8.1 (e.g., inhaled insulin,
a-glucosidase inhibitors,colesevelam,bro-
mocriptine, and pramlintide) may be tried
in specific situations but considerations
include modest efficacy in type 2 diabetes,
frequency of administration, potential for
druginteractions, cost, and/or side effects.
Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials
There are now three large randomized
controlled trials reporting statistically sig-
nificantreductionsincardiovascularevents
for two SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin
and canagliflozin) and one GLP-1 receptor
agonist (liraglutide) where the majority, if
not all patients, in the trial had ASCVD.
The empagliflozin and liraglutide trials
demonstrated significant reductions in
cardiovascular death. Exenatide once-
weekly did not have statistically sig-
nificant reductions in major adverse
cardiovascular events or cardiovascu-
lar mortality but did have a significant
reduction in all-cause mortality. In con-
trast, other GLP-1 receptor agonists
have not shown similar reductions in
cardiovascular
events
(Table
9.4).
Whether the benefits of GLP-1 receptor
agonists are a class effect remains to be
definitively established. See ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC

 outcomes trials. Additional large random-
ized trials of other agents in these classes
are ongoing.
Of note, these studies examined the
drugs in combination with metformin
(Table 9.4) in the great majority of pa-
tients for whom metformin was not con-
traindicated or not tolerated. For patients
with type 2 diabetes who have ASCVD, on
lifestyle and metformin therapy, it is rec-
ommended to incorporate an agent with
strong evidence for cardiovascular risk re-
duction especially those with proven ben-
efit on both major adverse cardiovascular
events and cardiovascular death after con-
sideration of drug-specific patient factors
(Table 8.1). See Fig. 8.1 for additional rec-
ommendations on antihyperglycemic
treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes.
Insulin Therapy
Many patients with type 2 diabetes even-
tually require and benefit from insulin
therapy. The progressive nature of type 2
diabetesshouldberegularlyandobjectively
explained to patients. Providers should
avoid using insulin as a threat or de-
scribing it as a sign of personal failure
or punishment.
Equippingpatientswith an algorithmfor
self-titration of insulin doses based on self-
monitoring of blood glucose improves
glycemic control in patients with type 2 di-
abetes initiating insulin (42). Comprehen-
sive education regarding self-monitoring
of blood glucose, diet, and the avoidance
of and appropriate treatment of hypogly-
cemia are critically important in any pa-
tient using insulin.
Basal Insulin
Basal insulin alone is the most convenient
initialinsulinregimen,beginningat 10units
per day or 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, depend-
ing on the degree of hyperglycemia. Basal
insulin is usually prescribed in conjunc-
tion with metformin and sometimes one
additional noninsulin agent. When basal
insulin is added to antihyperglycemic
agents in patients with type 2 diabetes,
long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine
or detemir) can be used instead of NPH
to reduce the risk of symptomatic and noc-
turnal hypoglycemia (43–48). Longer-
acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or
degludec) may additionally convey a
lower hypoglycemia risk compared with
U-100 glargine when used in combination
with oral antihyperglycemic agents (49–
55). While there is evidence for reduced
hypoglycemia with newer, longer-acting
basal insulin analogs, people without a
history of hypoglycemia are at decreased
risk and could potentially be switched to
human insulin safely. Thus, due to high
costs of analog insulins, use of human in-
sulin may be a practical option for some
patients, and clinicians should be familiar
with its use (56). Table 8.4 provides AWP
(39) and NADAC (40) information (cost
per 1,000 units) for currently available in-
sulin and insulin combination products
in the U.S. There have been substantial
increases in the price of insulin over the
past decade and the cost-effectiveness
of different antihyperglycemic agents is
an important consideration in a patient-
centered approach to care, along with

 efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, weight, and
other patient and drug-specific factors
(Table 8.1) (57).
Bolus Insulin
Many individuals with type 2 diabetes
may require mealtime bolus insulin dos-
ing in addition to basal insulin. Rapid-
acting analogs are preferred due to their
prompt onset of action after dosing. In
September 2017, the FDA approved a new
faster-acting formulation of insulin aspart.
The recommended starting dose of meal-
time insulin is 4 units, 0.1 units/kg, or 10%
ofthe basaldose. IfA1C is ,8% (64 mmol/
mol) when starting mealtime bolus in-
sulin, consideration should be given to
decreasing the basal insulin dose.
Premixed Insulin
Premixed insulin products contain both a
basal and prandial component, allowing
coverage of both basal and prandial needs
with a single injection. NPH/Regular 70/30
insulin, for example, is composed of 70%
NPHinsulinand30%regularinsulin.Theuse
of premixed insulin products has its advan-
tages and disadvantages, as discussed be-
low in COMBINATION INJECTABLE THERAPY.
Concentrated Insulin Products
Several concentrated insulin preparations
are currently available. U-500 regular insu-
lin, by definition, is five times as concen-
trated as U-100 regular insulin and has a
delayed onset and longer duration of ac-
tion than U-100 regular, possessing both
prandial and basal properties. U-300 glar-
gine and U-200 degludec are three and
two times as concentrated as their U-100
formulationsandallowhigherdosesofbasal
insulin administration per volume used.
U-300 glargine has a longer duration of ac-
tion than U-100 glargine. The FDA has also
approved a concentrated formulation of
rapid-acting insulin lispro, U-200 (200
units/mL). These concentrated preparations
may be more comfortable for the patient
and may improve adherence for patients
with insulin resistance who require large
doses of insulin. While U-500 regular insulin
isavailablein both prefilledpensand vials(a
dedicated syringe was FDA approved in July
2016), other concentrated insulins are avail-
able only in prefilled pens to minimize the
risk of dosing errors.
Inhaled Insulin
Inhaled insulin is available for prandial use
withamorelimiteddosingrange.Itiscontra-
indicated in patients with chronic lung dis-
ease such as asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonarydiseaseandisnotrecommended
inpatientswho smokeorwho recently stop-
ped smoking. It requires spirometry (FEV1)
testing toidentifypotentiallungdiseaseinall
patients prior to and after starting therapy.
Combination Injectable Therapy
If basal insulin has been titrated to an ac-
ceptable fasting blood glucose level (or if
thedoseis.0.5 units/kg/day)and A1C re-
mains above target, consider advancing
to combination injectable therapy (Fig.
8.2). When initiating combination inject-
able therapy, metformin therapy should
be maintained while other oral agents
may be discontinued on an individual ba-
sis to avoid unnecessarily complex or
costly regimens (i.e., adding a fourth anti-
hyperglycemic agent). In general, GLP-1
receptor agonists should not be discon-
tinued with the initiation of basal insulin.
Sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-
1 receptor agonists are typically stopped
once more complex insulin regimens be-
yond basal are used. In patients with sub-
optimal blood glucose control, especially
those requiring large insulin doses, adjunc-
tive use of a thiazolidinedione or SGLT2
inhibitor may help to improve control
and reduce the amount of insulin needed,
though potential side effects should be
considered. Once an insulin regimen is ini-
tiated, dose titration is important with ad-
justments made in both mealtime and
basal insulins based on the blood glucose
levels and an understanding of the phar-
macodynamic profile of each formulation
(pattern control).
Studies have demonstrated the non-
inferiority of basal insulin plus a single
injectionofrapid-actinginsulinat thelarg-
est meal relative to basal insulin plus a
GLP-1 receptor agonist relative to two
daily injections of premixed insulins
(Fig. 8.2). Basal insulin plus GLP-1 recep-
tor agonists are associated with less hy-
poglycemia and with weight loss instead
of weight gain but may be less tolerable
and have a greater cost (58,59). In No-
vember 2016, the FDA approved two dif-
ferent once-daily fixed-dual combination
products containing basal insulin plus a
GLP-1 receptor agonist: insulin glargine
plus lixisenatide and insulin degludec
plus liraglutide. Other options for treat-
ment intensification include adding a sin-
gle injection of rapid-acting insulin analog
(lispro, aspart, or glulisine) before the
largest meal or stopping the basal insulin
and initiating a premixed (or biphasic)
insulin (NPH/Regular 70/30, 70/30 aspart
mix, 75/25 or 50/50 lispro mix) twice
daily, usually before breakfast and before
dinner. Each approach has its advan-
tages and disadvantages. For example,
providers may wish to consider regimen
flexibility when devising a plan for the ini-
tiation and adjustment of insulin therapy
in people with type 2 diabetes, with rapid-
acting insulin offering greater flexibility in
terms of meal planning than premixed in-
sulin. If one regimen is not effective (i.e.,
basal insulin plus GLP-1 receptor agonist),
consider switching to another regimen to
achieve A1C targets (i.e., basal insulin plus
singleinjectionofrapid-actinginsulinorpre-
mixed insulin twice daily) (60,61). Regular
human insulin and human NPH/Regular
premixed formulations (70/30) are less
costly alternatives to rapid-acting insulin
analogs and premixed insulin analogs,
respectively, but their pharmacody-
namicprofilesmaymakethemlessoptimal.
Fig. 8.2 outlines these options, as well
as recommendations for further intensifi-
cation, if needed, to achieve glycemic
goals. If a patient is still above the A1C
target on premixed insulin twice daily,
consider switching to premixed analog in-
sulin three times daily (70/30 aspart mix,
75/25 or 50/50 lispro mix). In general,
three times daily premixed analog insu-
lins have been found to be noninferior
to basal-bolus regimens with similar rates
of hypoglycemia (62). If a patient is still
above the A1C target on basal insulin
plus single injection of rapid-acting insulin
before the largest meal, advance to a
basal-bolus regimen with $2 injections
of rapid-acting insulin before meals. Con-
sider switching patients from one regimen
to another (i.e., premixed analog insulin
three times daily to basal-bolus regimen
or vice-versa) if A1C targets are not being
met and/or depending on other patient
considerations (60,61). Metformin should
be continued in patients on combination
injectable insulin therapy, if not contra-
indicated and if tolerated, for further gly-
cemic benefits.
