A decade of Australian methotrexate dosing errors
M
ethotrexate is a synthetic
folic acid analogue used for
its
antineoplastic
and
immunomodulating
properties.
It
competitively
inhibits
folic
acid
reductase, decreasing tetrahydrofolic
acid production and inhibiting DNA
synthesis. Low dose methotrexate
(administered weekly in doses of
7.5e25 mg) is indicated for rheuma-
toid arthritis, psoriasis and inflam-
matory bowel disease.1
The unusual dosing schedule of low
dose methotrexate is associated with a
risk
that
it
will
be
prescribed,
dispensed
or
administered
daily
instead of weekly. Used appropri-
ately, methotrexate is considered safe
and
efficacious;
accidental
daily
dosing, however, can potentially be
lethal. Higher or more frequent doses
can result in gastro-intestinal mucosal
ulceration, hepatotoxicity, myelosup-
pression, sepsis and death.2 Indeed,
there are several literature reports of
serious
morbidity
and
mortality
linked with methotrexate medication
errors.3-7 A study of medication errors
reportedtotheUnitedStatesFoodand
Drug Administration over 4 years
identified more than 100 methotrexate
dosing errors (25 deaths), of which
37% were attributed to the prescriber,
20% to the patient, 19% to dispensing,
and 18% to administration by a health
care professional.8,9
Currenteffortstoreducethelikelihood
of these errors include the guideline
that a specific day of the week for
taking methotrexate is nominated.10
Additional care in counselling is rec-
ommended to ensure that patients are
aware of the dangers of taking extra
methotrexate and of signs of metho-
trexate toxicity.4 In Australia, oral
methotrexate is available in packs of
2.5mg� 30,
10mg� 15,
and
10 mg� 50 tablets. In 2008, the 15-
tablet pack was introduced to reduce
the risk of toxicity, with the 50-tablet
pack being placed on a restricted
benefit listing for patients prescribed
more than 20mg per week.
Although overseas data have been
published
in
the
form
of
case
reports3,6 and reviews of adverse
event databases,9 Australian data on
methotrexate medication errors are
lacking. In this article, we describe
cases of methotrexate medication
errors resulting in death reported to
the National Coronial Information
System (NCIS), summarise reports
involving methotrexate documented
in the Therapeutic Goods Adminis-
tration Database of Adverse Event
Notifications
(TGA
DAEN),
and
describe
methotrexate
medication
errors reported to Australian Poisons
Information Centres (PICs).
Methods
This study investigated medication
errors recorded in the NCIS, TGA
DAEN and PIC datasets. For the pur-
poses of our study, “medication error”
was defined as an incident occurring
anywhere in the medication process,
including prescribing, dispensing or
administration. For the error to be
included in our study, methotrexate
must have been taken by the patient
on 3 or more consecutive days.
Data were collected from the NCIS to
identify deaths linked with metho-
trexate medication errors. The NCIS
database has a record of reportable
deaths from July 2000 onwards for all
states except Queensland, for which
data are available from January 2001.
This database was searched on 4 July
2015 for closed cases from the period
2000e2014,
searching
for
metho-
trexate in the “cause of death” fields,
and by searching for deaths caused by
antineoplastic agents in “complica-
tions of health care” as “mechanism/
object”. A keyword search of attached
documentation (findings, autopsy re-
ports) was not performed. Results
weremanuallyreviewedforinclusion.
Data were obtained from the open
access TGA DAEN for methotrexate
adverse
events
reported
from
January 2004 to December 2014.
Cases coded as “accidental over-
dose”, “drug administration error”,
“drug dispensing error”, “inappro-
priate schedule of drug administra-
tion”,
“medication
error”,
or
“overdose”
were
extracted
and
manually reviewed for inclusion.
Abstract
Objective: Accidental daily dosing of methotrexate can result in
life-threatening toxicity. We investigated methotrexate dosing errors
reported to the National Coronial Information System (NCIS), the
Therapeutic Goods Administration Database of Adverse Event Notifications
(TGA DAEN) and Australian Poisons Information Centres (PICs).
Design and setting: A retrospective review of coronial cases in the NCIS
(2000e2014), and of reports to the TGA DAEN (2004e2014) and
Australian PICs (2004e2015). Cases were included if dosing errors were
accidental, with evidence of daily dosing on at least 3 consecutive days.
Main outcome measures: Events per year, dose, consecutive days of
methotrexate administration, reasons for the error, clinical features.
Results: Twenty-two deaths linked with methotrexate were identified in
the NCIS, including seven cases in which erroneous daily dosing was
documented. Methotrexate medication error was listed in ten cases in the
DAEN, including two deaths. Australian PIC databases contained 92 cases,
with a worrying increase seen during 2014e2015. Reasons for the errors
included patient misunderstanding and incorrect packaging of dosette
packs by pharmacists. The recorded clinical effects of daily dosage were
consistent with those previously reported for methotrexate toxicity.
Conclusion: Dosing errors with methotrexate can be lethal and continue to
occur despite a number of safety initiatives in the past decade. Further
strategies to reduce these preventable harms need to be implemented and
evaluated. Recent suggestions include further changes in packet size,
mandatory weekly dosing labelling on packaging, improving education, and
including alerts in prescribing and dispensing software.

 There are four PICs in Australia that
together
provide
around-the-clock
poisoning advice to health care pro-
fessionals and members of the public
across Australia. We retrospectively
reviewed
the
New
South
Wales,
Victorian, Western Australian and
Queensland PIC databases. South
Australia, the Northern Territory, the
Australian Capital Territory and Tas-
mania do nothavePICs,but calls from
these states are diverted to the New
South Wales and Western Australian
Poisons Centres. Data from the Victo-
rian PIC were available from May
2005, and from the Queensland PIC
from January 2005; other PIC data-
basesweresearchedfor1January2004
onwards, with cases included if they
occurred on or before 31 December
2015. Methotrexate cases were manu-
ally reviewed for inclusion.
Methotrexate dispensing data from
January 2004 to August 2015 were
obtained from the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Schedule Item Reports web-
site (http:/
/medicarestatistics.human
services.gov.au/statistics/pbs_item.
jsp). Item numbers 1622J, 1623K and
2272N were included, corresponding
to the oral methotrexate available in
Australia. The price of 10 mg � 50
tablets is above the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS) co-payment
threshold, while those of other pack
sizes are below the threshold. The PBS
dataset did not capture items under
the co-payment threshold until April
2012. Data on the dispensing of
10 mg� 15 and 2.5 mg� 30 tablet
packs during the study period is
available only for concession card
holders; that is, using PBS data for the
entire population overestimates the
proportionofscripts dispensed for the
10 mg� 50 pack size. As the price of
the medicine of interest lies under the
co-payment
threshold,
the
study
population was restricted to conces-
sionalbeneficiariestobetterreflectuse
of the medicine.11
We used medians and interquartile
ranges (IQRs)to describe thedata, and
performed statistical analyses with
Excel (Microsoft) and SPSS 22 (IBM).
Ethics
Ethics approval for the use of NCIS
data was granted by the Victorian
Justice
Human
Research
Ethics
Committee (approval number CF/
12/19007); ethics approval for the use
of PIC data was granted by the Syd-
ney Children’s Hospitals Network
Human Research Ethics Committee
(approval number LNR-2011-04-06).
Results
We identified 22 instances in the
NCIS dataset where methotrexate
was listed as a cause of death,
including 12 with documented bone
marrow suppression. Dosing errors
were recorded in seven cases (five
men, two women); methotrexate had
been taken for between 3 and 10
consecutive
days.
One
further
deceased patient took more than the
prescribed
dose
of
methotrexate
(based on tablets remaining and
dispensing
date),
but
was
not
included because consecutive daily
dosing was not conclusively estab-
lished. Abnormal blood cell counts
were
documented
for
all
seven
deaths linked with dosing errors
(median age, 78 years; range, 66e87
years).
Reasons
for
the
errors
included dosette packaging errors by
pharmacists (three cases), prescrib-
ing error (one), mistaking metho-
trexate for another medication (one),
dosing error by carer (one), and
prescriberepatient
miscommunica-
tion (one). Causes of death without a
documented dosing error included
alveolar
damage
or
pulmonary
fibrosis
(five
cases),
pneumonia
(three), sepsis (three), pancytopenia
(one), chronic liver disease (one) and
gastro-intestinal haemorrhage (one).
The TGA DAEN included 16 reports
of
methotrexate-related
adverse
events meeting our search criteria,
including five deaths. These were
reviewed for inclusion, and unin-
tended daily dosing was documented
in ten cases (median age, 58 years;
IQR, 42e74 years;range, 41e85 years;
eight women), including two deaths
(two women, aged 71 and 83 years).
The PIC dataset contained 92 cases of
methotrexate-related
medication
error meeting our inclusion criteria.
Between 2005 and 2013, the annual
number of events was fairly stable
(four to nine cases per year; Box 1).
Interestingly, there was an increase
during 2014e2015 (16 and 13 cases
respectively). We compared PIC ex-
posures
with
prescribing
and
dispensing habits, as increased sup-
ply might explain an increase in
medication errors. The number of
methotrexate
concessional
scripts
dispensed
during
2005e2015
is
shown in Box 1. Most methotrexate
was dispensed in 10 mg � 50 tablet
packs, the rate of dispensing of which
increased steadily during the study
period, while that of 2.5 mg tablets

 had been decreasing. The rate of
dispensing of the smaller pack size
(10 mg � 15), introduced in 2008, has
grown, but has not reached that of the
larger pack size, which still accoun-
ted for 47% of scripts (and 79% of
10 mg doses) in 2014.
In the PIC dataset, exact ages were
recorded in 51% ofcases (median age,
65 years; IQR, 52e77 years; range,
28e91 years);at least 18 patients were
over 75 years of age. Fifty-five of the
92 patients were women; sex was not
recorded in seven cases. Call records
documented a range of symptoms,
including
stomatitis,
vomiting,
reduced blood cell count and fever.
The median number of consecutive
days for which methotrexate was
taken was 5 (IQR, 4e9 days; range,
3e180 days); the distribution was
skewed
(Box
2),
with
20
cases
involving methotrexate taken for 3
consecutive days. The median daily
dose
taken
was
10 mg
(IQR,
10e15 mg; range, 2.5e60 mg). Box 3
summarises data on the doses and
durations of administration in medi-
cation errors reported to PICs.
Where
documented,
reasons
for
errors in the PIC dataset included
mistaking methotrexate for another
medication (11 cases), often folic acid
(six cases) or prednisone (four); carer
or nursing home error (five); metho-
trexate being newly prescribed for
the patient (five); dosette packing
errors
by
the
pharmacy
(four);
misunderstanding instructions given
by the doctor or pharmacist (two); the
patient believing it would improve
efficacy
(two);
prescribing
error
(one); and dispensing or labelling
error (one).
There was little overlap in the cases
recorded in the three datasets. One
DAEN case wasa match for one in the
NCIS dataset, and there was one
possible match of a DAEN case with
PIC data. Two of the NCIS deaths
were also recorded in PIC databases.

This study examined methotrexate
dosing errors captured by a range of
reporting
systems.

 DAEN
(including
two
deaths,
2004e2014)
and
92
PIC
cases
(2004e2015). These datasets had little
overlap, with 91 unique reports of
methotrexate medication error iden-
tified
in
the
three
datasets
for
2004e2014. Although these events
are relatively rare, they can have
serious consequences, and all are
preventable.
Serious
toxicity
(including death) was noted after as
little as 3 consecutive days of meth-
otrexate administration.
This study highlights the benefits of
searching both the coronial and TGA
datasets, as there was only one case
common to these two datasets (with
the NCIS capturing more cases than
the TGA). Deaths are reported to the
coroner according to legislation that
defines a “reportable death”, and
there is no requirement to report
deaths
caused
by
adverse
drug
events. Indeed, a recent study by our
group found that there is little cross-
reporting of drug-related deaths by
the TGA and the coroner (unpub-
lished data). This raises the question
of whether there might be more
deaths
related
to
methotrexate
dosing errors that are not reported to
either body. Similarly, although our
PIC dataset includes all Australian
poisons calls, not all methotrexate
medication errors result in a call to a
PIC. Methotrexate medication errors
causing toxicity and death may thus
be more common than our study
suggests.
Further limitations of our study
include the delayed release of find-
ings by the coroner. At the time of
data extraction, case closure rates for
2013
and
2014
averaged
about
75% and 50% respectively. Our study
may
therefore
underestimate
the
numbers of deaths, especially those
occurring during 2013e2014. The
TGA dataset documents occasions of
methotrexate dosing errors, but the
DAEN does not establish causality,
so that the deaths recorded in the
TGA DAEN represent associations
with the medication (rather than
causal links). The PIC dataset has
limitations,
including
non-
standardised methods for coding
calls and the fact that it lacks outcome
information (Australian PICs do not
routinely conduct follow-up calls).
As the PBS dataset did not capture
items
under
the
co-payment
threshold prior to 2012, we analysed
only dispensing data for the conces-
sional
population.
Although
this
provides an indication of prescribing
trends, it may not be generalisable to
the entire population.
The variability in the amount and
duration of methotrexate administra-
tion prior to a toxic reaction is inter-
esting. The NCIS database showed
that
taking
methotrexate
for
3
consecutive days can be fatal, but a
small proportion of PIC patients took
the drug daily for weeks before they
presented to hospital. Such diversity
of response could be caused by the
marked variability in genes involved
inmethotrexateabsorption,transport,
metabolism and excretion.2,12 Vari-
ability in renal function and hydration
could also affect methotrexate clear-
ance.2 The median age of patients in
the NCIS dataset was more than 10
years higher than that in the PIC
dataset, suggesting that increased age
may be a risk factor for death related
to methotrexate dosing errors.
These data revealed a worrying in-
crease in methotrexate medication
errors
in
the
PIC
dataset
for
2014e2015, despite the mentioned
efforts to reduce the incidence of
these events. It is difficult to explain
this increase, but the risk of metho-
trexate medication error may be
increasing as the population ages.
Older people may be at increased risk
because of a range of problems that
includes confusion, memory diffi-
culties, and age-related decline in
visual acuity.
This study indicates that ongoing
harm is occurring as the result of
methotrexate errors. More needs to
be done by the manufacturers, the
TGA and health professionals to
reduce these risks and to improve the
harmebenefit
balance
of
weekly
methotrexate. One possibility would
be to adjust the packaging. A further
reduction in pack size may be war-
ranted; for example, each box of the
Rheumatrex
Dose
Pack8
in
the
United States contains doses for
4 weeks only (similar to the manner
in
which
the
weekly
dosed
bisphosphonates
are
packaged).
Current methotrexate pack sizes in
Australia can exceed a year’s supply,
depending on the prescribed dose.
Although
supply
of
the
largest
methotrexate pack was changed to a
restricted benefit in 2008, this did not
result in a reduction in the number of
scripts dispensed (Box 1). In addition,
uptake of the new, smaller pack has
been slow (Box 1). More must there-
fore be done to discourage prescrib-
ing of unnecessarily large quantities
of methotrexate.
Further, because it is recommended
that folate be co-prescribed with
methotrexate,
folate
and
metho-
trexate could be packaged together in
a manner similar to that for oral
contraceptives/sugar pills or combi-
nation
calcium/vitamin
D
with
bisphosphonates.
This
would
be
particularly useful given that one of
the reasons for methotrexate medi-
cation
errors
we
identified
was
confusion of the medication with
folate.
The
limitations
of
this
approach include the lack of national
consensus on the ideal regimen for
folate supplementation, with insuffi-
cient evidence to justify strongly
recommending a specific dose.13 This
approach would also require an in-
dustry partner to develop such a
product,8 and with current prices
there may be a limited return on this
investment.
Formulating
methotrexate
as
a
distinctively coloured tablet could
reduce the risks of medication errors
by pharmacists, pharmacy techni-
cians and patients; the documented
confusion of methotrexate with folic
acid tablets is probably related to
both being small yellow tablets.
Further packaging changes could be
made, including clear labelling of the
box
with
a
statement
such
as
“Warning: this medicine is usually
taken weekly. It can be harmful if
taken
daily.”
Similar
labelling
changes have been recommended in
Australia14 and elsewhere,15 and the
results of this study suggest that
more needs to be done to mandate
sponsors (the companies supplying
methotrexate in Australia) to enact
these changes.

 dispensing errors, warnings in pre-
scribing
and
dispensing
software
could be improved. Prescribing soft-
ware could include a pop-up alert
when
methotrexate
is
prescribed
daily, with the manual entry of an
oncological
indication
needed
to
override the warning.16 Dispensing
software
could
include
alerts
if
methotrexate is being dispensed too
frequently.Weidentifiedatleastthree
fatalities caused by daily metho-
trexate included in pharmacy-filled
dosette boxes. Education of pharma-
cists and their assistants could be
improved to increase vigilance and
checking of dosette packs containing
methotrexate.
Further,
patients
who are prescribed methotrexate for
the first time are at particular risk,
and extra care in counselling these
patients is needed. This includes
providing clear verbal and written
instructions about dosage.
In conclusion, our study found that
methotrexate
medication
errors,
some resulting in death, are still
occurring despite a number of safety
initiatives. The increase in the num-
ber of events during 2014e2015 is
particularly
concerning.
Metho-
trexate use is likely to continue
increasing as Australia’s population
ages, so that additional measures
are needed to prevent these errors.
We have outlined some potential
strategies,
including
altering
the
packaging,
improving
education,
and including alerts in prescribing
and dispensing software.
