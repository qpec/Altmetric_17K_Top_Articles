uman papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually 
transmitted infection globally,1 affecting 50%–75% of 
sexually active individuals.2,3 The quadrivalent HPV 
(HPV4) vaccine protects against 2 oncogenic strains of HPV and 
has been available since 2006. Despite demonstrated effective-
ness in real-world settings,4,5 including proven reduction in the 
risk of cervical dysplasia, concerns persist about the vaccine’s 
safety,6,7 particularly in light of case reports of autoimmune dis-
orders following HPV vaccination.8–10
A recent news story reporting cases of serious debilitating 
illnesses after HPV4 — although subsequently retracted11 —
reactivated parental concerns about the safety of this vaccine.12 
As such, we undertook a population-based, retrospective cohort 
study to assess the risk of autoimmune disorders following HPV4 
vaccination among grade 8 girls eligible for Ontario’s HPV 
vaccination program.
Methods
Setting
During the study period (2007–2013), HPV4 vaccination (Gardasil, 
Merck) was offered free to all grade 8 girls in Ontario through 
school-based clinics.13 This optional vaccine usually required 
parental consent and was typically administered in September/
October, November/December and March/April, corresponding 
with the recommended 0-, 2- and 6-month dosing interval for the

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Despite demonstrated 
effectiveness in real-world settings, con-
cerns persist regarding the safety of the 
quadrivalent human papillomavirus 
(HPV4) vaccine. We sought to assess the 
risk of autoimmune disorders following 
HPV4 vaccination among grade 8 girls 
eligible for Ontario’s school-based HPV 
vaccination program. 
METHODS: We undertook a population-
based retrospective cohort study using 
Ontario’s administrative health and vac-
cination databases from 2007 to 2013. 
The self-controlled case series method 
was used to compare the rate of a com-
posite end point of autoimmune disor-
ders diagnosed during days 7–60 post-
vaccination (“exposed” follow-up) to 
that at any other time (“unexposed”). 
The analysis was repeated to assess the 
effect of a history of immune-mediated 
diseases and time since vaccination. We 
also conducted an exploratory analysis 
of individual autoimmune disorders. 
Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were estimated using conditional 
Poisson regression, adjusted for age, 
seasonality, concomitant vaccinations 
and infections.
RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 
290 939 girls aged 12–17 years who were 
eligible for vaccination between 2007 
and 2013. There was no significant risk 
for developing an autoimmune disorder 
following HPV4 vaccination (n = 681; 
rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.85–1.47), and 
the association was unchanged by a his-
tory of immune-mediated disorders and 
time since vaccination. Exploratory 
analyses of individual autoimmune dis-
orders found no significant risks, includ-
ing for Bell palsy (n = 65; rate ratio 1.73, 
95% CI 0.77–3.89), optic neuritis (n = 67; 
rate ratio 1.57, 95% CI 0.74–3.33) and 
Graves disease (n = 47; rate ratio 1.55, 
95% CI 0.92–2.63).
INTERPRETATION: We did not observe an 
increased risk of autoimmune disorders 
following HPV4 vaccination among teen-
aged girls. These findings should reassure 
parents and health care providers.

3-dose series used at that time. Eligible girls also had the option 
of vaccination through their local public health unit or physician 
at no cost, although most received it at school. During the study, 
all doses of the HPV4 vaccine were documented in the Immuniza-
tion Records Information System (IRIS) database regardless of 
the setting. 
Study population and data sources
We identified a population-based cohort of all girls eligible for 
Ontario’s grade 8 HPV vaccination program between 2007 and 
2013 using birth year as a proxy for grade. Since most girls enter-
ing grade 8 turn 13 years of age by Dec. 31 of that year, girls eligi-
ble for the 2007/08 to 2012/13 vaccination programs were born in 
1994 to 1999. This approach correctly identified an estimated 
96.4% of eligible girls.14 We excluded girls who received HPV vac-
cination before program eligibility and those whose vaccination 
records were either unavailable (i.e., not yet record-linked with 
the province’s health databases) or inactive (i.e., moved out of 
Ontario or to a public health unit whose vaccination records 
were unavailable). Cohort members were followed from Sept. 1 
of their grade 8 year (cohort entry) until the earliest of date of 
death or Mar. 31, 2013 (study end).
The administrative health databases used included the Regis-
tered Persons Database, which contains demographic informa-
tion on all Ontario residents; the Ontario Health Insurance Plan 
(OHIP) for information on physician services; the National Ambu-
latory Care Reporting System (NACRS) for information on emer-
gency department visits; and the Discharge Abstract Database 
(DAD) for detailed information on hospital admissions. These 
databases were accessed through the Institute for Clinical Evalu-
ative Sciences (ICES).
Each public health unit maintains its own IRIS database to 
record information on vaccines administered through the prov-
ince’s publicly funded program. At the time of this study, a copy 
of IRIS from 32 of Ontario’s 36 public health units had been trans-
ferred to ICES, where records were linked and anonymized. A 
 
validation study performed using standard methods and the 
paper vaccination records as the gold standard found that doses 
of the HPV4 vaccine in IRIS were captured with high sensitivity 
(99.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 99.34%–99.95%) and high 
specificity (95.4%, 95% CI 93.7%–96.85), and that 98.6% of vac-
cination dates were accurate.15
Study outcomes
The primary outcome was a first diagnosis of any of 12 auto-
immune disorders included in the composite end point (Appen-
dix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170871/-/DC1). The included autoimmune disorders com-
prised those commonly targeted for postmarketing surveil-
lance,16,17 identified in case reports for the HPV4 vaccine,8,9,18–23 or 
reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS) database.24,25 A composite end point was chosen 
because most autoimmune disorders are rare. This approach 
also reduced the potential for misclassification since some auto-
immune disorders present with similar symptoms, lack definitive 
diagnostic tests and may take time to diagnose correctly.
Autoimmune disorders were identified using diagnostic codes 
in the OHIP, NACRS and DAD databases determined in consulta-
tion with clinical experts (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170871/-/DC1). To capture only 
incident cases, we excluded girls with a diagnosis of any auto-
immune disorder before cohort entry. Since few of the diagnostic 
codes used have been validated, a validated algorithm for identi-
fying systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases using adminis-
trative health data was adapted for this study (Appendix 2).26 This 
algorithm has a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity ranging from 
72.5% to 96.4% for individual systemic autoimmune rheumatic 
diseases.26
Statistical analysis
Studies on vaccine safety typically compare cohorts of 
vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. However, such 
comparisons are particularly prone to confounding bias27 when 
the risk factors for the outcome of interest are largely unknown 
or difficult to quantify (e.g., genetic susceptibility), as with 
autoimmune disorders. To circumvent this bias, we used the self-
controlled case series method developed specifically for vaccine 
safety studies.28 With this method, vaccinated cases serve as 
their own controls because their follow-up time can be divided 
into “exposed” and “unexposed” time intervals. The exposed 
time intervals (also known as “exposure risk windows”) 
correspond to periods postvaccination that are biologically 
attributable to the effects of the vaccine, and unexposed 
follow-up represents time intervals preceding vaccination and 
following the exposure risk window (Appendix 3, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170871/-/DC1). As 
such, vaccinated cases are compared with themselves over time 
and unvaccinated cases are not required. The incidence rate 
during exposed follow-up time is compared with that during 
unexposed follow-up, and rate ratios and 95% CIs are estimated 
using conditional Poisson regression to account for the 
self-matching.
The 3 key assumptions of the self-controlled case series 
method are (1) outcomes are either recurrent and independent, 
or unique and rare; (2) outcomes must not censor follow-up (i.e., 
cannot be fatal); and (3) outcomes must not affect the 
probability of future vaccination. In our study, assumptions 1 
and 2 were fulfilled given that autoimmune disorders are rare 
and usually nonfatal, and assumption 3 was also met since most 
girls received all 3 doses of the HPV4 vaccine and as many 
outcomes were diagnosed after the third dose as with the first 
and second doses.
The exposure risk window for the primary analysis was 
7–60 days following each dose. This risk window was based on 
the underlying pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of the 
autoimmune disorders studied, including their insidious onset;29 
the risk window used in studies of autoimmune disorders 
following use of other vaccines (Appendix 4, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170871/-/DC1); data on 
time-to-onset of autoimmune diseases following HPV4 
vaccination reported to the VAERS database;24 and recognition 
that health databases capture time to medical contact rather

than time to onset of symptoms. All other follow-up time was 
considered unexposed.
The self-matched nature of the self-controlled case series 
method implicitly controlled for all time-fixed confounders, 
including ethnicity, genetic susceptibility, personal beliefs and 
values, and health behaviours. However, we controlled for the 
potentially confounding effects of time-varying risk factors, 
including age at diagnosis (≤ 14, 15–16, ≥ 17 yr), seasonality as a 
proxy for influenza season and vaccination (September to 
December as individual months, January–February and March–
August combined), recent infections (7–60 d before diagnosis), 
and receipt of concomitant vaccines (7–60 d before diagnosis) by 
including these factors in the Poisson models.
To identify subgroups at potentially higher risk for 
autoimmune disorders following HPV4 vaccination, we repeated 
the primary analysis stratified by a history of immune-mediated 
diseases (i.e., asthma, anaphylaxis and other atopic manifes-
tations). Also, to determine whether the risk for autoimmune 
disorders post 
vaccination varied over time, the primary 
exposure risk window was stratified into the following periods: 
7–24, 25–42 and 43–60 days. Finally, the analysis was repeated 
for individual autoimmune disorders.
We tested the robustness of our results through planned 
sensitivity analyses. First, to determine whether any etiologically 
relevant outcomes were excluded from the primary end point, 
the analysis was repeated using an expanded composite end 
point (Appendix 1). Second, to address the concern that disease 
onset may have preceded HPV4 vaccination, the analysis was 
repeated excluding cases diagnosed within 30 days after 
vaccination. Finally, to address the possibility of exposure 
misclassification due to an erroneously specified exposure risk 
window, the 7–60 days risk window was widened to 0–60, 7–90 
and 7–180 days. These risk windows have been used in previous 
vaccine studies of autoimmune disorders (Appendix 4).
This study had more than 90% power to detect a rate ratio of 
2.0 for autoimmune disorders. Statistical analyses were 
conducted using SAS version 9.3 and Stata version 11.

Results
The cohort consisted of 290 939 girls eligible for Ontario’s grade 8 
HPV vaccination program between 2007 and 2013 (Figure 1). The 
mean age was 13.2 (range 12.7–13.7) years at cohort entry, and 
the girls were followed for a mean of 2.9 (standard deviation 1.5) 
years. A total of 180 819 (62.2%) girls received at least 1 dose of 
the HPV4 vaccine, with most receiving all 3 doses (81.8%), and 
110 120 (37.8%) were unvaccinated. Although the proportion of 
unvaccinated girls may seem high, it reflects the well-
documented low uptake of this vaccine during the initial years of 
the program.13,30
Among 681 incident cases of autoimmune disorders 
diagnosed in vaccinated girls, 77 (11.3%) occurred 7–60 days 
after HPV4 vaccination (i.e., exposed cases) (Figure 2). Exposed 
cases were as likely to be diagnosed after the first dose (n = 21) as 
the second (n = 26) or third dose (n = 30), and most (79.2%) 
exposed cases received all 3 doses. The end point consisted 
primarily of cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, followed by 
systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, immune thrombo-
cytopenic purpura, optic neuritis and Bell palsy (Table 1); the 
pattern is consistent with the background incidence of these 
disorders in this age group.31
Age at diagnosis, history of recent infections and history of 
immune-mediated disease were significant risk factors for 
autoimmune disorders, whereas vaccination with a non-HPV 
vaccine was not (Table 2). With the exception of October, 
seasonality was not significantly associated with the risk of 
autoimmune disorders. Nevertheless, all of these factors were 
included in the analysis.
Receipt of the HPV4 vaccine was not associated with an 
increased risk of developing an autoimmune disorder (adjusted 
rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.85–1.47), and the association was 
independent of a girl’s history of immune-mediated diseases (p = 
0.4) (Table 3). 
When stratified by time since vaccination, the adjusted rate 
ratios increased from 0.95 to 1.31, then decreased to 0.97 for the 
risk windows of 7–24, 25–42 and 43–60 days, respectively; 
however, none of these differences were significant (Table 4).
The exploratory analysis of individual autoimmune disorders 
found no significantly increased risks, including for Bell palsy, 
optic neuritis and Graves disease (Figure 3).
The sensitivity analyses using the expanded outcome 
definition and excluding cases occurring within 30 days of the 
first HPV4 dose were essentially unchanged (adjusted rate ratios 
1.05, 95% CI 0.72–1.55; and 0.97, 95% CI 0.73–1.30, respectively). 
The association between HPV4 vaccination and autoimmune 
disorder was also unaffected by the inclusion of the 7 days 
immediately following HPV4 vaccination (adjusted rate ratio 
0.99, 95% CI 0.76–1.30), and the addition of 30 days and 120 days 
to the primary exposure risk window (adjusted rate ratios 0.98, 
95% CI 0.76–1.26; and 0.94, 95% CI 0.75–1.17, respectively).
Interpretation
We did not find a significantly increased risk for autoimmune 
disorders following HPV4 vaccination in this large population of 
girls aged 12–17 years, including in those with pre-existing 
immune-mediated diseases. The association was also unaffected 
by time since vaccination. Moreover, our results were robust to 
numerous sensitivity analyses.
Our results are similar to those of 2 other large cohort studies 
of the HPV4 vaccine carried out using the population-based 
health care registries of Denmark and Sweden. The first study 
followed 997 585 girls aged 10–17 years and did not find a 
significant risk for the autoimmune disorders assessed,32 and the 
second followed 3.9 million girls and women 10–44 years of age 
and reported no increased risk for multiple sclerosis and other 
demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system.33 In 
addition, 2 small case–control studies involving older age

groups, conducted in France34 and the United States,35 also 
reported no increased risk for various autoimmune disorders. 
However, the studies published to date have been limited by 
their use of longer-than-recommended risk windows32–34 that 
could bias toward the null, a lack of validation of vaccination 
records32,33 and a direct comparison of vaccinated and 
unvaccinated girls,32–34 an approach prone to bias. Our study 
using more robust methods nevertheless found similar results. 
As such, the consistency of results across different study designs, 
analytical strategies, risk windows and populations is reassuring.
Recently, a cohort study conducted in France involving 
2.2 million girls aged 13–16 years reported no increased risk for 
12 of 14 autoimmune disorders evaluated following HPV 
vaccine composed of either bivalent HPV (HPV2) or HPV4.36 
Although this study reported a significantly higher risk of 
Guillain–Barré syndrome among HPV-vaccinated girls 
compared with unvaccinated girls (adjusted hazard ratio 3.78, 
95% CI 1.79–7.98), a UK study of HPV2 and HPV4 vaccination 
using the more robust self-controlled case series method failed 
to find such an association (rate ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.47–2.28).37 
Although these studies are not directly comparable to ours 
given their inclusion of the HPV2 vaccine, they nevertheless 
provide additional evidence against HPV vaccine–induced 
autoimmune disorders.
Limitations 
Our study benefits from the use of population-based databases, 
which limits the potential for selection bias, and from the use of 
a robust analytical method that implicitly controls for all known 
and unknown time-fixed confounders. Nevertheless, our study 
had some limitations. First, although the outcome definition 
was based on an algorithm that has been validated for certain

*The duration of time following each dose of the HPV4 vaccine during which the occurrence of an event is attributable to the effects of the vaccine.
†Unadjusted rate ratios were derived from self-matched models that implicitly controlled for time-fixed confounders and only included the HPV vaccine (exposure).
‡Adjusted for age at diagnosis, seasonality (Table 2), receipt of non-HPV vaccines (7–60 d before diagnosis) and recent infection (7–60 d before diagnosis), and implicitly 
adjusted for time-fixed confounders through the use of a self-matched analysis.

autoimmune disorders, the available data did not allow us to 
validate the disorders included in the composite end point. We 
expect any misclassification to be nondifferential (i.e., unrelated 
to timing of vaccination) and, therefore, to bias toward the null. 
Second, the date of symptom onset was not available. To 
address the concern that disease onset may have preceded 
HPV4 vaccination, we repeated the analysis excluding diagnoses 
occurring within 30 days of the first dose and found similar 
results. Third, the rarity of the outcomes necessitated the use of 
a composite end point and, although not ideal, the exploratory 
analysis of individual disorders supported our primary findings. 
Fourth, there is potential for exposure misclassification given 
the use of the same risk window for all autoimmune disorders 
included in the composite end point. However, our results were 
robust despite the use of varying time windows. Fifth, although 
our use of a self-matched analysis implicitly controls for time-
fixed confounders, and the analysis included known time-
varying factors, we cannot rule out the possibility of confound-
ing from unknown time-varying factors. As such factors are 
unlikely, the potential for residual confounding is low. Finally, 
our results may not be generalizable to other populations, 
including older women and boys, for whom the HPV vaccine is 
also indicated. However, evidence does not suggest they are at 
higher risk for vaccine-induced autoimmune disorders. Also, 
although only half of girls eligible for Ontario’s program were 
included in this study owing to data availability, the girls 
included were from geographically, ethnically and economically 
diverse public health units of varying sizes. As such, our cohort is 
likely representative of all eligible girls.
Conclusion
This large, population-based study did not find a significant risk of 
autoimmune disorders following HPV4 vaccination among girls 
aged 12–17 years, including girls with a history of immune-mediated 
disorders. These findings add to the growing body of evidence on 
the safety of this vaccine and should reassure parents and health 
care providers.
