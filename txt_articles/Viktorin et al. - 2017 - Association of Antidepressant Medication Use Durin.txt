IMPORTANCE Maternal antidepressant medication use during pregnancy has previously been
associated with adverse outcomes in offspring, but to our knowledge, the association with
intellectual disability (ID) has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVES To examine the association of maternal antidepressant medication use during
pregnancy with ID in offspring and investigate the importance of parental mental illness for
such an association.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study of 179 007 children
born from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007, with complete parental information
from national registers who were followed up from birth throughout 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs of ID in
children exposed during pregnancy to any antidepressant medication or specifically to
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, all other non-SSRI
antidepressants, or other nonantidepressant psychotropic medications. Analyses were
adjusted for potential confounders. In addition to full population analyses, we used a
subsample to compare mothers who used antidepressants during pregnancy with mothers
who had at least one diagnosis of depression or anxiety before childbirth but did not use
antidepressants during pregnancy.
RESULTS Of the 179 007 children included in the study (mean [SD] age at end of follow-up,
7.9 [0.6] years; 92 133 [51.5%] male and 86 874 [48.5%] female), ID was diagnosed in 37
children (0.9%) exposed to antidepressants and in 819 children (0.5%) unexposed to
antidepressants. With adjustment for potential confounders, the RR of ID after
antidepressant exposure was estimated at 1.33 (95% CI, 0.90-1.98) in the full population
sample and 1.64 (95% CI, 0.95-2.83) in the subsample of women with depression. Results
from analyses of SSRI antidepressants, non-SSRI antidepressants, and nonantidepressant
psychotropic medications and analyses in the clinically relevant subsample did not deviate
from the full-sample results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The unadjusted RR of ID was increased in offspring born to
mothers treated with antidepressants during pregnancy. After adjustment for confounding
factors, however, the current study did not find evidence of an association between ID and
maternal antidepressant medication use during pregnancy. Instead, the association may be
attributable to a mechanism integral to other factors, such as parental age and mother’s
psychiatric disorder.

ntellectual disability (ID) has an estimated lifetime preva-
lence of 0.7% to 2.0% in the population of western
societies,1-4 has immense social effects, and is a leading
cause of health care–related societal costs.5 Intellectual dis-
ability is commonly diagnosed in childhood, is defined by an
IQ below 70 along with adaptive deficits that impair every-
day functioning, and can be divided based on severity.6
Genetic and environmental factors are implicated in ID and
include chromosomal and hereditary factors, such as tri-
somy 21 (Down syndrome)7 and fragile X syndrome8; factors
that affect fetal development, such as uncontrolled diabetes9;
and congenital exposures to infectious agents10,11 or toxic
agents.12-14
Adverse outcomes have also been associated with con-
ventional medications used during pregnancy, including the
antiepileptic and mood-stabilizing medication sodium val-
proate, which has been associated with poor cognitive devel-
opment and lower IQ in exposed offspring.15 In recent de-
cades,useofantidepressantmedications,particularlyselective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has increased signifi-
cantlyingeneral16andamongpregnantwomeninparticular.17,18
Antidepressants pass the placenta,19 and a mouse study20 re-
ported smaller head size in mice prenatally exposed to SSRIs.
Moreover, high levels of serotonin in serotonin transporter
knockout mice are thought to cause abnormal wiring of the so-
matosensory cortex and the lateral geniculate nucleus in the
brain.21 Human observational studies report associations be-
tween prenatal antidepressant exposure and reduced time in
gestation,22-25 lower birth weight,23,25 reduced fetal head
growth,26 and adverse offspring outcomes, including septal
heart defects,27 persistent pulmonary hypertension,28,29 and
malformations at birth.30 Furthermore, ID commonly co-
occurs with autism spectrum disorder (ASD),31 which has been
associated with maternal antidepressant medication during
pregnancy in many32-36 but not all studies.37-43 There are also
reports of an association of fetal antidepressant exposure with
delayed fetal brain development44 but not with behavioral or
emotional problems in early childhood.45
In this study, we examine a potential association of mater-
nal antidepressant medication during pregnancy with diag-
nosed ID in the offspring and assess to what extent maternal
and paternal factors confound such an association. In addi-
tion to studying treatment with any antidepressant, we study
treatmentspecificallywithSSRIantidepressants,allothernon-
SSRI antidepressants, and nonantidepressant psychotropics.
Methods
Study Population
A birth cohort based on all live-born children conceived from
July 1, 2005, and born from January 1, 2006, through Decem-
ber 31, 2007, was established by linkage of Swedish national
registers using the unique individual Swedish national regis-
tration number.46 Mothers and offspring were identified in the
Swedish Medical Birth Register, which covers 99% of all births
nationwide since 1973 and provides information on gesta-
tional age at birth that was used to calculate the duration of
pregnancy.47 In Sweden, 95% of all pregnant women undergo
ultrasonography in the early second trimester, which pro-
vides the gestational age of the fetus with an error margin of
±7 days.48 The fathers were identified using the Multi-
generationRegister.49Tobeincludedinthestudy,childrenhad
to have complete information on gestational age at birth and
the identity of the father. By Swedish law, informed consent
was not necessary because the study used data available from
national registries. The register data were linked by the gov-
erningbodiesanddeidentifiedbeforeprovidedtotheresearch-
ers. The study was approved by the regional ethics commit-
tee in Stockholm, Sweden.
Medications
The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains information on
all dispensed prescription medications in Sweden since July
2005 along with medication name, prescription and dispen-
sation dates, and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
code.50,51Weidentifieddispensationsofallpsychotropicmedi-
cations prescribed in Sweden (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Medication periods were calculated beginning
at the dispensation date through the last dispensed dose,
assuming 1 pill was consumed per day (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). The offspring were classified as unexposed to antide-
pressants if they were born to mothers without any antide-
pressant medication periods that overlapped the pregnancy,
defined as the period from the estimated conception date un-
til the birth date. Offspring were considered to be exposed if
themotherhadatleast2dispensationsofantidepressantswith
medication periods that overlapped the pregnancy. Offspring
of mothers with only a single medication dispensation that
overlapped the pregnancy were not included as exposed or un-
exposed but were analyzed separately because of uncer-
taintyofexposure.Antidepressantmedicationisnormallyused

Key Points
Question Does maternal antidepressant medication use during
pregnancy increase the risk of intellectual disability in offspring?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 179 007
pregnancies, an association of maternal antidepressant
medication use during pregnancy with intellectual disability in
offspring was attenuated when parental factors other than
medication use were taken into account.
Meaning An elevated risk of intellectual disability in children born
to women who used antidepressant medication during pregnancy
is likely attributable to factors underlying the treatment and not to
the antidepressant medication itself.

 inpatient psychiatric admissions since 1973 and all outpa-
tient specialist admissions since 2001 and provides admis-
siondatesalongwiththemainand8secondarydiagnosiscodes
in accordance with the ICD. Intellectual disability was de-
fined as having at least 1 inpatient or outpatient specialist care
admission between birth and the end of follow-up at Decem-
ber 31, 2014, with an ICD-10 code of F70 to F79. Supplemen-
tal analyses were conducted for mild to moderate ID using
ICD-10 codes of F70, F71, and F74 to F79; severe ID (including
profound ID) using ICD-10 codes of F72 to F73; and ID with-
out ASD by excluding children with an ASD ICD-10 code of F84.
Covariates
A previous study53 found an increasing prevalence of child-
hood psychiatric disorders over time by year of birth. In-
crease over time was also observed in the current cohort (eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement). To adjust for potential temporal
trends, we included the birth date of the offspring as the num-
ber of days from January 1, 2005, to the birth date. Because
agewasbestsupportedbytheavailablestudies,54maternaland
paternal ages at childbirth were categorized into younger than
20 years, 20 through 29 years, 30 through 39 years, and 40
years or older, using 20 through 29 years as the reference. Ma-
ternal and paternal educational levels were included, coded
from1to7(1indicatingcompulsoryschoolshorterthan9years;
2, compulsory school for 9 years; 3, upper secondary school
up to 2 years; 4, upper secondary school for 3 years; 5, post-
secondary education <3 years; 6, university for 3 years; and 7,
doctoral education) (eTable 3 in the Supplement) as a mea-
sureofsocioeconomicstatus.Toadjustforpotentialconfound-
ing by indication, we included maternal and paternal psychi-
atric disorders diagnosed in the Swedish National Patient
Register before childbirth within several psychiatric disorder
subgroups (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Paternal psychotro-
pic medication use that overlapped the pregnancy was also in-
cluded, as well as maternal medication use with psychotro-
pic drugs other than antidepressants that overlapped the
pregnancy. Covariates related to the paternal psychiatric dis-
order were included because paternal psychiatric illness has
been hypothesized to affect maternal well-being.55
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses were also performed separately for offspring born to
mothers with only a single antidepressant dispensation and
any number of antidepressant dispensations with medica-
tion periods that overlapped pregnancy compared with unex-
posed offspring during pregnancy. The proportional hazards
assumption for the Cox proportional hazards regression mod-
els was examined using Schoenfeld residuals.56 Analyses were
performed separately for mild to moderate ID, severe ID, and
ID without ASD. To account for potential within-family cor-
relations in the data attributable to multiple births from the
same parents, we used bootstrap techniques.57 Potential sex
specificity of associations was tested by analyses of male and
femaleoffspringseparately.Theroleofgestationalageandbirth
weight in the causal pathway was examined. Potential trimes-
ter-specific and duration-dose-response effects were ana-
lyzed. The effect of potential misclassification of unexposed
offspring born to mothers with an antidepressant dispensa-
tion within 6 months of conception was examined. The role
of polypharmacy was also examined.
Statistical Analysis
Relative risks (RRs) of ID and the associated Wald-type, 2-sided
95% CIs were estimated by the hazard ratios from Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models. The age of the child is one
of the most important determinants of childhood psychiatric
disorder diagnosis,53 which was observed in our sample (eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement), and Cox proportional hazards re-
gression allows for detailed adjustment for censoring that
affects the length of follow-up of each child.58 The Cox pro-
portional hazards regression models were fitted using days
since birth as the underlying time scale. Each child was fol-
lowed up from birth until a diagnosis of ID, death, or end of
follow-up on December 31, 2014, whichever came first. In the
primary analyses, children of mothers with at least 2 antide-
pressant dispensations with medication periods that over-
lappedpregnancywerecomparedwithchildrenofmothersnot
exposed to antidepressant medication during the pregnancy.
Mothers with only a single antidepressant dispensation with
a medication period that overlapped pregnancy were ana-
lyzed separately (eFigure 3 in the Supplement) and in combi-
nation with mothers with at least 2 dispensations (eFigure 4
in the Supplement).
Analyses were conducted for all included children to pro-
videapublichealthperspectiveandinaclinicallyrelevantsub-
sample of children born to mothers with at least 1 diagnosis
before childbirth of depression or anxiety, the most common
diagnoses motivating antidepressant medication. In this sub-
sample, the control group corresponds to offspring born to
mothers with a depression or anxiety diagnosis but without
any medication dispensation.
First, we examined children of mothers medicated dur-
ing pregnancy with any type of antidepressant. The RRs of ID
were calculated in a sequence of models with increasing de-
gree of adjustment for potential confounding factors accord-
ing to the model: (1) crude analyses without covariate adjust-
ment; (2) analyses adjusted for confounding by nonpsychiatric
parental factors, including offspring birth date, mother'
s and
father'
s dispenses of other psychotropic medications during
pregnancy, maternal and paternal age, and maternal and pa-
ternal educational level at childbirth; (3) supplementing model
2 with additional adjustment for any maternal depressive di-
agnosis before childbirth; and (4) supplementing model 3 with
additional adjustment for any diagnosis before childbirth of
specific psychiatric disorders in the mother’s and/or father'
s
lifetime. The psychiatric disorders included separate vari-
ables for a diagnosis of depression, anxiety disorders, schizo-
phrenia, bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, compulsive
disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ASD, ID, and
any other psychiatric diagnosis (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Second, we calculated the RRs of ID among children of
mothers treated specifically with SSRI antidepressants, non-
SSRIantidepressants,ornonantidepressantpsychotropicmedi-
cations compared with children of mothers not treated with
these medications during pregnancy.

 estimates in analyses restricted to the clinically relevant sub-
sample (n = 8021) (Figure 1).
Medication Subgroups
Among the 3982 pregnancies exposed to antidepressant medi-
cation, 3178 women (79.8%) were treated with SSRI antide-
pressants and 804 (20.2%) were treated with non-SSRI anti-
depressants. In an additional 1626 (0.9%) pregnant women not
treated with antidepressants, the mother had at least 2 dis-
pensations with other psychotropic medications. In analyses
adjusted for all included confounders (model 4), the RR of ID
in the offspring was estimated at 1.48 (95% CI, 0.98-2.23) for
SSRIantidepressants,0.81(95%CI,0.33-2.00)fornon-SSRIan-
tidepressants, and 1.31 (95% CI, 0.75-2.27) for nonantidepres-
sant psychotropic medications (Figure 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses of children of mothers who used a single antidepres-
sant medication during pregnancy (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment) or any number of antidepressant medications during
pregnancy (eFigure 4 in the Supplement) revealed lower RRs
than the main analysis but similar patterns of gradual attenu-
ation. Inspection of the Schoenfeld residuals did not suggest
any violation of the proportional hazards assumption (eFig-
ure5intheSupplement).AnalysesofmildtomoderateID(eFig-
ure 6 in the Supplement), of severe ID (eFigure 7 in the Supple-
ment), of ID without comorbid ASD (eFigure 8 in the
Supplement), using bootstrap techniques (eFigure 9 in the
Supplement), of male and female offspring separately (eFig-
ure 10 in the Supplement), of gestational age and birth weight
(eFigure 11 in the Supplement), of trimester-specific expo-
sures (eFigure 12 in the Supplement), of duration-dose-
responseeffects(eFigure13intheSupplement),ofpotentialmis-
classification of children classified as unexposed (eFigure 14 in
theSupplement),andofpolypharmacy(eFigure15intheSupple-
ment) revealed results that did not deviate quantitatively and
qualitatively from the main findings in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

(0.9% of children affected) compared with offspring of moth-
ers not treated with antidepressants during pregnancy (0.5%

tors. However, with incremental adjustment for maternal and
paternal confounding factors, this association was gradually
attenuated to a statistically nonsignificant RR estimated at 1.33
(95% CI, 0.90-1.98). Thus, the association between offspring

The full sample consists of 179 007 children born during 2006 and 2007, of
whom 873 had been diagnosed with intellectual disability and 3982 were born
to a mother with antidepressant treatment during pregnancy. The figure
presents the RRs (95% CIs) of intellectual disability among children of mothers
with at least 2 dispensations of antidepressant drugs that overlapped the
pregnancy compared with unexposed children. There was a clinically relevant
subsample of 8021 children, of whom 69 had been diagnosed with intellectual
disability and 2372 were born to a mother with antidepressant treatment during
pregnancy. All mothers, both medicated and nonmedicated, had at least 1
diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder before childbirth (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Therefore, the offspring of mothers with medication use during
pregnancy is compared with the offspring of mothers who may share similar
underlying factors.

 extent, be explained by confounding by the covariates in-

This finding was further supported in analyses confined
to the 8021 children born to mothers with at least 1 diagnosis
of depression or anxiety before childbirth. In these analyses,
all children were born to a mother with a diagnosis of a disor-
der for which antidepressant treatment may be prescribed and
may therefore be more similar with regard to factors other than
the antidepressant medication (eg, genetic susceptibility to a
psychiatric disorder) or to environmental factors correlated
withthepsychiatricdisorder.Moreover,tofurtherexaminepo-
tential medication-specific effects, we performed additional
analyses of children born to mothers treated during preg-
nancy specifically with SSRI antidepressants, non-SSRI anti-
depressants, or nonantidepressant psychotropic medica-
tions. The results of these analyses were comparable to the
results of the analyses of children exposed to any antidepres-
sant during pregnancy, which further suggests that the un-
derlying condition precipitating the medication is important
for the association between ID in the offspring and maternal
medication use during pregnancy. This interpretation was ad-
ditionally supported by sensitivity analyses, which did not re-
veal a trimester-specific or duration-dose-response effect on
the association.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this study include a large, prospectively ascer-
tained, population-based sample of children and their par-
ents with near-complete health care data coverage. Risks of
selection bias are limited by the use of data from a health care
system with equal access and complete information on all in-
cluded children and parents. Inclusion of children born dur-
ing a limited period (2006-2007) reduced the risk of poten-
tial time-dependent confounding. Inclusion of the parents’
diagnoses of psychiatric disorder allowed detailed adjust-
ment for confounding. The requirement of at least 2 dispen-
sations overlapping the pregnancy increased the specificity of
the exposure. Analyses of medications divided into SSRI an-
tidepressants, non-SSRI antidepressants, and nonantidepres-
santpsychotropicmedicationsrevealedsimilarfindings,which
support the interpretation that underlying factors confound
the association between medication during pregnancy and in-
creased risk of ID among offspring.
These findings should nevertheless be interpreted in light
of some limitations. Although medications recorded in the
Swedish Prescribed Drug Register have been prescribed and
collected, adherence is not known. To address this limitation,
we focused on children of mothers with at least 2 dispensa-
tions that overlapped the pregnancy and analyzed children of

The sample consists of 179 007 children born during 2006 and 2007, of whom
873 had been diagnosed with intellectual disability. There were 3178 children
born to mothers treated with SSRIs during pregnancy, 804 children born to
mothers treated with non-SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy, and 1626
children born to mothers treated with nonantidepressant psychotropic
medications during pregnancy. The figure presents RRs (95% CIs) of intellectual
disability among children of mothers with at least 2 dispensations of
antidepressants or other psychotropic medications that overlapped the
pregnancy compared with unexposed children.
a Analyses not adjusted for covariates.
bAnalyses adjusted for birth date, maternal and paternal age, the father'
s
psychotropic medication use that overlapped the pregnancy, and maternal
and paternal educational levels at childbirth.
c Analyses adjusted for the factors listed in footnote b and for any maternal
diagnosis of depression before childbirth (yes/no) (see eTable 4 in the
Supplement for specific diagnosis codes).
dAnalyses adjusted for the factors listed in footnote b and for maternal and
paternal diagnoses before childbirth of specific psychiatric disorder subgroups
(yes/no), including depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder,
bipolar disorder, compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and other
psychiatric diagnosis (see eTable 4 in the Supplement for specific diagnosis
codes).

 mothers with a single dispensation separately. Moreover, the
Swedish National Patient Register does not provide informa-
tion from primary care; as such, diagnoses confined to pri-
mary care go undetected. However, this did not affect the
study'
s ability to detect children with ID because they are re-
ferredtoaspecialistwhoiscoveredbytheSwedishNationalPa-
tientRegister.Thelackofprimarycaredatamay,however,have
affectedtheabilitytocaptureparentalpsychiatricdiagnosesand
the ability to adjust for potential confounding. A supplemen-
talanalysisrevealedthatalmost40%ofthemotherstreatedwith
antidepressant medication during pregnancy lacked any psy-
chiatric diagnosis before childbirth in the Swedish National Pa-
tient Register (eFigure 16 in the Supplement). In a sensitivity
analysis in which all antidepressant-treated mothers were as-
sumed to have a depression diagnosis, the RR of ID was fur-
ther attenuated (eFigure 17 in the Supplement). Moreover, the
study could not adjust for other potential confounding fac-
tors,includingdisorderseverity,lifestylefactors,andfactorsthat
affectfetaldevelopment(eg,exposuretouncontrolleddiabetes,9
infectious agents,10,11 or toxic agents).12-14 Expanded covariate
adjustment could further attenuate or strengthen the associa-
tion. Furthermore, other factors related to ID, such as trisomy
21 (Down syndrome)7 and fragile X syndrome,8 were not spe-
cifically investigated in the current study.
Last, although the current study included many children
andadjustedformanyimportantconfoundingfactors,theout-
come was rare and the number of children diagnosed with ID
during the follow-up period of the first 7 to 8 years after birth
was 873 (0.5%). Although this figure is lower than some pre-
vious estimates,2-4 it is comparable to the prevalence of 0.6%
in children aged 3 to 10 years in a US survey1 and to preva-
lence estimates from register-based sources in other Scandi-
navian cohorts.4 Previous literature suggests increasing preva-
lence of childhood psychiatric disorders over time,53 which is
also supported by our data (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Be-
cause children with ID without clinical care are not captured,
the prevalence estimate of ID in the current study may be an
underestimate of the true prevalence in the population. In ad-
dition, the likelihood diagnosis may differ among groups (eg,
through increased medical surveillance of children born to
mothers treated with antidepressants during pregnancy). Be-
cause ID is relatively uncommon and our prevalence esti-
mates are only slightly lower than expected, the misclassifi-
cation would likely not significantly change the RRs and would
not affect the primary conclusions of our results. However, low
prevalence limits the statistical power, particularly in the com-
pound-specific analyses of the study, and prevents more de-
tailed analyses (eg, of specific drugs). Additional research of
theassociationbetweenmaternalpsychotropicmedicationuse
during pregnancy and ID in offspring is therefore warranted.
Conclusions
The unadjusted RR of ID was increased among offspring born
to mothers treated with antidepressants during pregnancy. Af-
ter adjustment for confounding factors, however, the current
study did not find evidence of an association between ID and
maternal antidepressant medication use during pregnancy. In-
stead, the association may be attributable to mechanisms in-
tegraltootherfactors,suchasparentalageandunderlyingpsy-
chiatric disorder.
