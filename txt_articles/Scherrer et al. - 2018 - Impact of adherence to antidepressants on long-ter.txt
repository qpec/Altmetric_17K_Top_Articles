Background
Depression contributes to persistent opioid analgesic use (OAU).
Treating depression may increase opioid cessation.
Aims
To determine if adherence to antidepressant medications
(ADMs) v. non-adherence was associated with opioid
cessation in patients with a new depression episode after >90
days of OAU.
Method
Patients with non-cancer, non-HIV pain (n = 2821), with a new
episode of depression following >90 days of OAU, were eligible if
they received ≥1 ADM prescription from 2002 to 2012. ADM
adherence was defined as >80% of days covered. Opioid ces-
sation was defined as ≥182 days without a prescription refill.
Confounding was controlled by inverse probability of treatment
weighting.
Results
In weighted data, the incidence rate of opioid cessation was
significantly (P = 0.007) greater in patients who adhered v. did not
adhered to taking antidepressants (57.2/1000 v. 45.0/1000
person-years). ADM adherence was significantly associated with
opioid cessation (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 95% CI 1.05–1.46).
Conclusions
ADM adherence, compared with non-adherence, is associated
with opioid cessation in non-cancer pain. Opioid taper and ces-
sation may be more successful when depression is treated to
remission.

Long-term prescription opioid analgesic use (OAU) for chronic
non-cancer pain is defined as ‘daily or near-daily’ use for >90
days.1,2 Between 1.4 and 10% of patients with a new opioid prescrip-
tion develop chronic OAU,2,3 and a majority, 65–80%, of patients
who have >90 days OAU, are still taking opioids 3–5 years
later.4,5 These patients are more likely than those who take
opioids short term to develop opioid use disorder and overdose.
Chronic OAU is also associated with new depressive episodes
(NDEs)3,6,7 and treatment-resistant depression.6 Because depres-
sion and OAU are mutually reinforcing,8 these patients may be in
a cycle of persistent OAU, depression and pain. Research on treating
depression to improve outcomes for chronic non-cancer pain is
sparse. In Kroenke et al’s9 Stepped Care for Affective Disorders
and Musculoskeletal Pain (SCAMP) study, where patients were ran-
domised to optimal depression treatment v. usual care, treating
depression led to reduced pain severity and anxiety, improved func-
tioning and better health-related quality of life.9 Although SCAMP
was not designed to measure change in OAU, the findings raise the
possibility that depression treatment could reduce use of opioids,
possibly
from
reduced
pain
or
improved
functioning.9–11
Improved functioning can occur independent of pain11 and
should follow depression treatment. Independent of changes in
pain severity, the need for OAU to self-regulate mood should dissi-
pate following reduction in depression.
We are not aware of any studies that report changes in OAU fol-
lowing adherence to antidepressant medication (ADM) treatment
in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Using a retrospective
cohort design, it is possible to test the hypothesis that adherence
to ADM treatment v. non-adherence is associated with OAU cessa-
tion without the ethical barrier of randomising to inadequate treat-
ment. Adherence serves as an indicator of depression improvement
because patients who are non-adherent are less likely to have
decreasing depression symptoms.12 Among patients initiating
ADMs, response to treatment by 24 weeks is much lower in non-
adherent v. adherent patients (55.8 v. 82.5%).13 Although it would
be ideal to have 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)14
scores for all patients at the time of ADM initiation and opioid
cessation, such data was available from only a subset of patients.
Therefore, we used adherence as a proxy for depression improve-
ment. In a large cohort of Veterans Health Administration patients
with NDE following >90 days of OAU, we tested the hypothesis that
depression treatment adherence was associated with OAU cessa-
tion. Specifically, the objective of the current study was to determine
whether patients who developed depression following chronic
OAU were more likely to stop using opioids if they adhered to
ADM treatment compared with patients who did not adhere to
ADM treatment. In addition, exploratory analysis in a subset of
patients with sufficient data was computed to assess the change in
depression symptoms and pain scores over time in patients adher-
ent to treatment with ADM compared with those who were non-
adherent who did and did not stop OAU.
Method
This retrospective cohort analysis used patient data extracted from
the Veterans Health Administration electronic medical record for 1
Jan 2000 to 31 Dec 2012. Data included ICD-9-CM diagnostic
codes,15 in-patient stays, out-patient visits, prescriptions dispensed
records, vital signs and demographic information.
Cohort identification
A random sample of 500 000 patients was taken from a cohort of
2 910 335 identified with at least one out-patient visit in both
fiscal years 1999 and 2000, and aged 18–80 years. We excluded
patients over 80 because they are more likely to receive prescription
opioids for end-of-life pain management and cancer pain and the
risk of misclassifying depression increases because of the greater
prevalence of vascular depression and depression related to

 dementia. From this sample, we excluded 151 500 patients with a
cancer and/or HIV diagnosis. Patients must have had at least one
yearly visit in the 2-year ‘washout’ period (2000–2001) during
which they must have been free of a medical record depression diag-
nosis (n = 266 901). We then selected patients with a NDE begin-
ning in 2002–2011 and not occurring on the last out-patient visit
date (n = 31 224). Because our previous reports indicate >90-day
OAU is associated with up to twice the risk of NDEs,3,7 we
limited the cohort to patients with >90 days of OAU or by the
date of the NDE (n = 3075).
NDE was defined by the presence of a primary diagnosis (ICD-9-
CM: 296.2, 296.3, 311) of depression in at least one in-patient stay or
two out-patient visits within the same 12-month period. This algo-
rithm has been shown to be a valid measure of depression when com-
pared with self-report or written medical record information.16,17
Patients without ADM treatment on or after the NDE were excluded
(n = 138). Patients must have had >3 months follow-up after NDE
diagnosis to allow for the possibility of the occurrence of least one
acute-phase depression treatment period (≥84 days)18 (n = 2843).
The final sample included patients with complete demographic data
(n = 2821). The cohort selection process is shown in Fig. 1.
Outcome – opioid cessation
Opioids included codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone,
levorphanol, meperidine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine and
pentazocine. Both short-acting and long-acting formulations were
included. Opioid prescription information included days supplied,
quantity (e.g. pills or liquid volume) and unit dose (mg). OAU
cessation was defined as a gap of at least 182 days from the end
date of the last prescription.5 OAU cessation date was the first
day of this gap.
Exposure – ADM adherence
ADMs included monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclics (TCAs) and non-classified
ADMs. ADM adherence was defined using proportion of days
covered (PDC) from NDE to opioid cessation or censor date.19,20
ADM prescriptions dispensed were used to create time arrays to
identify days of follow-up that an ADM was available. If multiple
ADMs were available in a day, that particular day was only
counted once as a covered day. The PDC was calculated by taking
the total number of covered days in follow-up by the total
number of days in follow-up. PDC was dichotomised to standard
thresholds for adherence (≥80%) and non-adherence (<80%).19–21
To determine if patient adherence was correlated with duration of
ADM treatment, we computed the number of continuous weeks
of treatment. ADM use was considered continuous if there was no
gap of >30 days between prescriptions dispensed and duration for
all periods of continuous use in follow-up were assessed to categor-
ise duration as ever ≥24 weeks, 12 to <23 weeks or <12 weeks.
Covariates
We included an OAU duration variable to control for duration of
use at the date of NDE (3–6 months, >6 to 12 months, >12 to 24
months, >24 months). Duration was computed from the months
of continuous OAU (no gap >30 days between prescriptions dis-
pensed). The opioid morphine equivalent dose (MED) was calcu-
lated using standard conversion tables. Days supplied and
quantity variables were used to calculate daily MED in follow-up.
We modelled the maximum daily MED before the end of follow-
up (1–50 mg, 51–100 mg, >100 mg). We controlled for comedica-
tion with benzodiazepines, which are associated with long-term
opioid use,22 and muscle relaxants, which could improve pain and
functioning. Benzodiazepines included alprazolam, clonazepam,
diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide and clorazepate. Muscle
relaxants included carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, dantro-
lene, metaxalone, methocarbamol, chlorzoxazone, tizanidine and
orphenadrine. Demographic variables included age, gender, ethni-
city (white v. other), marital status (married v. other) and insurance
coverage (Veterans Health Administration only v. other sources).
To control for detection bias related to more healthcare encoun-
ters, we created a healthcare utilisation variable defined as average
number of out-patient clinic visits per month in follow-up. The dis-
tribution of the mean was then dichotomised into high utiliser,
>75th percentile, v. low utiliser, ≤75th percentile. We controlled
for psychiatric and physical comorbidities associated with de-
pression23 and/or OAU.24–26 Comorbidities were defined using
ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. Psychiatric comorbidities included
post-traumatic stress disorder and any other anxiety disorder, a
composite of panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social
phobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder and anxiety disorder not
otherwise specified. We controlled for alcohol misuse or depend-
ence; illicit drug misuse or dependence, including opioids; and nico-
tine dependence. Chronic physical conditions included type 2
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, obesity,
low
testosterone,
sleep
apnoea
and
cardiovascular
disease.
Cardiovascular disease was a composite of hyperlipidaemia, ischae-
mic heart disease, disease of pulmonary circulation, other heart
disease, hypertensive heart disease and myocardial infarction.
Five separate pain condition variables were created based on
over 900 ICD-9-CM codes.7,24 These conditions were arthritis,
back pain, musculoskeletal pain, headaches and neuropathic pain.
Pain scores, collected during routine care in the Veterans Health
Administration, were on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0
to 10, with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity. In pro-
pensity score models, we adjusted for a time invariant maximum
pain score before the end of follow-up to control for the highest
pain level. As variability in pain scores in the Veterans Health
Administration have been previously reported,27 a time-varying
pain score for each month of follow-up was used in final survival
models. For the time-varying pain score assessment, the pain
score was assumed to be consistent across subsequent months
until a new monthly assessment was available.
Propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weight-
ing (IPTW) were used to balance potential confounders listed in
Table 1 between ADM adherent and non-adherent treatment
groups to reduce the effect of bias by indication and other sources
of confounding. The propensity score is the probability of ADM
adherence, given covariates and was calculated using a binary
logistic regression model. Propensity scores were used to apply
IPTW approaches using stabilised weights.28–33 A stabilised
weight is the marginal probability of ADM adherence divided by
the propensity score for the adherent group, and (1 – marginal
probability of ADM adherence) divided by (1 – propensity score)
for the non-adherent group. It helps reduce bias associated with
extreme weights of either individuals in the ADM adherent group
with low propensity scores or those in the non-adherent group
with high propensity scores. Extreme weights are associated with
increased variability of the exposure effect, thus, stabilising
weights helps reduce type II error rate.34 Stabilised IPTW also pre-
serves original sample size (i.e. does not inflate sample size in
pseudo-data) in analysis thereby also preserving the type I error
rate.33 Stabilised weights were trimmed if they were ≥10, as well-
behaved weights have a mean close to 1 and a maximum <10.30,35
The mean of stabilised weights should be close to 1, extreme
values indicate the propensity-score model poorly specified predic-
tors of treatment exposure. IPTW resulted in pseudo-populations

 for ADM adherence groups such that covariates balanced across the
two groups. Covariate balance was assessed by comparing covariate
distributions between ADM adherence groups. Balance is indicated
with no significant differences in the distribution of covariates
between groups and by standard mean differences <10%.34,36
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed with SAS v9.4 at an alpha of 0.05.
Bivariate analyses, using independent samples t-tests for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables, assessed
the relationship of covariates with ADM adherence in unweighted
and weighted data. A Poisson regression model was used in
unweighted and weighted data to compare opioid cessation inci-
dence rate (person-years) between ADM adherence groups.
Unweighted and weighted Cox proportional hazards models were
used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for
the relationship of ADM adherence and time to opioid cessation.
Weighted analyses used stabilised weights in probability weighting.
Confidence intervals and P-values in weighted analyses were

 calculated using robust, sandwich-type variance estimators. Follow-
up time was defined as months from date of NDE to date of OAU
cessation or censor date, which was the last available Veterans
Health Administration encounter.
The final model included variables to control for pain diagnoses
and changing pain score after the initiation of ADM treatment. All
pain variables and ADM adherence were modelled as time depend-
ent. This allows ascertainment of exposure status over the multiyear
observation period and permits new diagnoses and change in pain
scores to contribute to the outcome. Initial evaluation of each inter-
action term of each covariate and follow-up time confirmed that the
proportional hazards assumption was met for ADM adherence (P =
0.11) and pain covariates (P > 0.05).
This project was approved by the institutional review boards of
participating institutions.
Exploratory analysis
In unweighted data, the average monthly change in PHQ-9 score
and pain score across follow-up was computed using random
intercept longitudinal mixed models (Proc Mixed, SAS v9.4) for
four groups; (a) ADM adherent with OAU cessation (n = 5 PHQ-
9; n = 213 pain scores), (b) ADM adherent without OAU cessation
(n = 96 PHQ-9; n = 864 pain scores), (c) ADM non-adherent with
OAU cessation (n = 14 PHQ-9; n = 354) and (d) ADM non-adher-
ent without OAU cessation(n = 147 PHQ-9; n = 1390 pain scores).
Because of the lack of PHQ-9 data prior to 2008, monthly
changes in PHQ-9 scores in follow-up were computed for a
subset of 262 patients with NDE occurring in 2008–2012 and
with at least one PHQ-9 score before end of follow-up. Time was
modelled as months since NDE and models included all available
pain and PHQ-9 data in follow-up.
Results
In unweighted data, a Fisher’s exact test of independence revealed
ADM adherence and duration were highly related (P < 0.0001,
results not shown). Among 1077 patients who were adherent,
0.2% received continuous ADM for less than 12 weeks, 4.4%

 received an ADM for 12 to <24 weeks and 95.5% for at least 24
weeks. Among 1744 patients who were non-adherent, 15.0%
received ADM for less than 12 weeks, 19.0% for 12 to <24 weeks
and 66.1% for at least 24 weeks.
Figure 2 shows that the overall unweighted incidence rate
for OAU cessation was 48.4 per 1000 person-years, with no signifi-
cant differences between ADM adherent (50.2/1000 person-years)
and non-adherent (47.4/1000 person-years) groups (P = 0.496).
However, after weighting data using IPTW techniques, the inci-
dence rate of OAU cessation was higher for ADM adherent (57.2/
1000 person-years) compared with non-adherent (45.0/1000
person-years ) groups (P = 0.007).
Unweighted distributions of covariates by ADM adherence are
shown in Table 1. Among those individuals taking opioids for >90
day with a NDE receiving ADM treatment, almost half (46.9%)
had taken opioids for more than 2 years (>24 months) at the
time
of
the
NDE.
Almost
two-thirds
(63.0%)
reached
a
maximum MED of >100 mg. Maximum dose achieved was
similar (P = 0.704) in ADM adherent and non-adherent groups.
Benzodiazepine comedication with ADM was significantly more
prevalent
among
ADM
adherent
(59.0%)
v.
non-adherent
(53.6%) groups. Comorbidities that were significantly more preva-
lent among ADM adherent compared with non-adherent groups
were post-traumatic stress disorder, type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, low testosterone and sleep apnoea. Alcohol
and illicit drug misuse/dependence were more prevalent among
the non-adherent group. Patients in the ADM adherent compared
with the non-adherent group were significantly older, White,
married, more likely to have other insurance in addition to
Veterans Health Administration insurance and have higher
healthcare utilisation.
After applying IPTW, all covariates balanced and were not sig-
nificantly different between the ADM adherent and non-adherent
groups (Table 2). IPTW stabilised weights ranged from 0.54 to
3.15, with a mean of 1.00 (s.d. = 0.25) and median of 0.95 (inter-
quartile range (IQR) = 0.83–1.11). The standardised mean differ-
ences (SMDs) after weighting were all <10%. Good balance was
achieved given differences between treatment groups were all
non-significant and all SMDs were <10%.
Results of unweighted and weighted Cox proportional hazards
models estimating the association between ADM adherence and
time to OAU cessation are shown in Table 3. In unweighted
data, there was no relationship of ADM adherence and time to
OAU cessation (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.88–1.24).
However, after weighting and adjusting for changes in pain scores
and pain diagnoses that could occur after ADM initiation,
adherence was associated with a 24% increased likelihood of OAU
cessation compared with non-adherence (HR = 1.24, 95% CI =
1.05–1.46)
Longitudinal linear growth curves for PHQ-9 score among a
subset of 262 patients by ADM adherent and OAU cessation
groups are shown in Fig. 3(a). At time of NDE, mean PHQ-9
scores were not significantly different between groups (P = 0.995).
Overall, there was a trend for a monthly decrease in PHQ-9 score
(P = 0.08). Average monthly decrease in PHQ-9 scores was largest
for the ADM adherent group with OAU cessation (β = −0.60,
95% CI −1.33 to 0.12) followed by the ADM non-adherent group
with OAU cessation (β = −0.21, 95% CI −0.53 to 0.10), ADM adher-

Scherrer et al

 received at least one ADM prescription, we observed adherence v.
non-adherence to ADM treatment was associated with a 24%
greater likelihood of opioid cessation. The ADM adherent v. non-
adherent group had a significantly greater incidence rate of OAU
cessation (57.2/1000 v. 45.0/1000 person years; P = 0.007). These
results were observed after balancing factors associated with
ADM. We also controlled for confounding by pain that could
persist during ADM treatment.
Exploratory analysis indicates that the ADM adherent group
who stopped taking opioids experienced a rapid and greater
decline in depression symptoms compared with patients who did
not stop taking opioids, regardless of adherence; however, these
results are preliminary because cell sizes were very small for OAU
cessation groups. Monthly pain scores were significantly higher
among the ADM non-adherent group with OAU cessation com-
pared
with
the
other
ADM
adherent,
non-adherent/opioid
cessation-no cessation groups, but the size of the difference was
not clinically meaningful. Adjusting for maximum pain scores
after ADM initiation in the full Cox proportional hazard models
did not change the association between ADM adherence and
opioid cessation. Together, these results provide preliminary evi-
dence that a reduction in depression may lead to OAU cessation.
Stronger evidence indicates change in pain scores does not
explain the association between ADM adherence and opioid
cessation.
Interestingly, ADM adherent and non-adherent groups who
stopped OAU had the steepest reductions in depression symptoms
across follow-up. Because response to antidepressant treatment is
markedly greater in those individuals who are adherent v. non-
adherent,12,13 we speculate people who are ADM non-adherent
may have decreased PHQ-9 scores because of OAU cessation.
This would be consistent with the evidence for a bidirectional rela-
tionship between OAU and depression.8 Prospective studies are
warranted to verify this finding.
Patients with comorbid pain and depression may remain on
opioids in an attempt to self-medicate mood37 and to avoid depres-
sion during opioid withdrawal.38 Patients with depression are more
likely to drop-out of opioid taper, and withdrawal symptoms are
exacerbated in patients with current depression.38 Thus, another
explanation for our findings may be related to improved depression
leading to decreasing attempts to self-medicate mood and greater
probability of completing opioid taper.
ADM adherence may be a proxy for overall adherence to
medical treatment, the ‘healthy adherer’ effect.39 These patients
may adhere to physician instructions to end OAU, adhere to
other forms of pain management or begin opioid substitution
treatment.
Limitations
It is possible that unmeasured confounders were not included in the
propensity score and we violated the exchangeability assumption.34
For instance we do not have personality measures or indicators of an
orientation toward health that might predict both adherence to anti-
depressants and contribute to opioid cessation. Thus, unmeasured
confounding is a limitation. The cohort was a majority male,
Veterans Health Administration patient population, which could
limit generalizability to non-Veterans Health Administration
patients. However, we have previously found that the association
between duration of OAU and NDEs in Veterans Health
Administration patients was replicated in two private-sector
cohorts,3 and the association between opioid use v. no use and
risk of depression recurrence in Veterans Health Administration
patients was replicated in a private-sector cohort.40 This suggests
our findings could be replicated in private-sector cohorts. OAU
was based on prescriptions dispensed and we were unable to deter-
mine whether patients took their medication as prescribed. Some
OAU could be misclassified if patients transitioned to non-
Veterans Health Administration or illicit sources for opioids.
Some antidepressants such as TCAs and duloxetine are used in
pain management,41,42 but ADM management for analgesia is not
designed to treat depression. Our conclusions were consistent in
post hoc analysis comparing adherence to TCAs/duloxetine only
v. adherence to other ADMs, indicating our findings were not as a
result of adherence to only ADMs commonly used in pain
management.
Implications
ADM adherence was associated with increased likelihood of OAU
cessation in individuals with chronic use of opioids and this associ-
ation was independent of duration of opioid use, maximum MED,
pain and numerous comorbid conditions. Several studies have
reported that the majority of people who take opioids for >90
days remain on opioids for 3–5 years.4,5 In our cohort, 47% took
them for >2 years. Thus, OAU cessation following adherent ADM
treatment occurred in a patient cohort with a low probability of
OAU cessation. We computed the number-needed-to-treat and

Antidepressant adherence and opioid cessation

 found for every 20 patients adherent to ADMs, one patient will stop
OAU who would not have stopped if they were non-adherent.
Treatment of opioid dependence in patients with comorbid
depression may be successful following effective depression treat-
ment. Preliminary evidence suggests OAU cessation may also
contribute to improvement in depression. Therefore, opioid taper
paired with ADM could result in a faster reduction of depression
symptoms and increase likelihood of successful OAU cessation.
Prospective data collection to obtain detailed depression and func-
tioning measures, change in OAU and treatment trials are needed to
confirm our findings.

These halls

I think therefore I am,
I walk these halls alone,
my footstep’s echo wanes
in this grand, vacant house.
I walk these halls alone,
the only comfort drawn
in this abandoned house
is my own absent mind.
The only comfort drawn,
was when I chose to doubt
in my own absent mind,
as I came to discern.
So long imprisoned by
‘I think therefore I am,’
I soon came to discern
that I am not my thoughts.
