E-cigarettes and National Adolescent 
Cigarette Use: 2004–2014

abstract
BACKGROUND: E-cigarette use is rapidly increasing among adolescents in the United States, 
with some suggesting that e-cigarettes are the cause of declining youth cigarette smoking. 
We hypothesized that the decline in youth smoking changed after e-cigarettes arrived on 
the US market in 2007.
METHODS: Data were collected by using cross-sectional, nationally representative school-
based samples of sixth- through 12th-graders from 2004–2014 National Youth Tobacco 
Surveys (samples ranged from 16 614 in 2013 to 25 324 in 2004). Analyses were conducted 
by using interrupted time series of ever (≥1 puff) and current (last 30 days) cigarette 
smoking. Logistic regression was used to identify psychosocial risk factors associated with 
cigarette smoking in the 2004–2009 samples; this model was then applied to estimate the 
probability of cigarette smoking among cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users in the 
2011–2014 samples.
RESULTS: Youth cigarette smoking decreased linearly between 2004 and 2014 (P = .009 for 
ever smoking and P = .05 for current smoking), with no significant change in this trend after 
2009 (P = .57 and .23). Based on the psychosocial model of smoking, including demographic 
characteristics, willingness to wear clothing with a tobacco logo, living with a smoker, 
likelihood of smoking in the next year, likelihood of smoking cigarettes from a friend, and 
use of tobacco products other than cigarettes or e-cigarettes, the model categorized <25% 
of current e-cigarette–only users (between 11.0% in 2012 and 23.1% in 2013) as current 
smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of e-cigarettes was not associated with a change in the linear 
decline in cigarette smoking among youth. E-cigarette–only users would be unlikely to have 
initiated tobacco product use with cigarettes.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: E-cigarette use is 
rapidly increasing among adolescents in the United 
States, with some suggesting increased e-cigarette 
use contributes to the decline in cigarette smoking.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The introduction of 
e-cigarettes was not associated with a change in 
the linear decline in cigarette smoking among youth 
but is expanding overall use. E-cigarette–only users 
would be unlikely to have initiated tobacco product 
use with cigarettes.

Between 2011 and 2014, US 
adolescent e-cigarette use rapidly 
increased, with 13.4% of high school 
students and 3.9% of middle school 
students reporting past-30-day use 
in 2014. In 2014, between 13% 
and 40% of middle and high school 
e-cigarette users in Connecticut, 
 
1 the 
United States, 
 
2 and Canada 
3 reported 
using e-cigarettes containing 
nicotine. (These reports may 
underestimate nicotine exposure 
because 8%–12% of students 
responded “don’t know” to questions 
about e-cigarette contents, 
 
1, 
2, 
 
4 and 
e-cigarettes labeled “nicotine-free” 
often contain nicotine. 
5, 
 
6) Nicotine 
exposure during adolescence can 
affect memory, attention, and 
emotional regulation. 
7 E-cigarette 
aerosol has been linked to cell 
damage, 
8 lung inflammation, asthma, 
 
9 
and respiratory infections. 
8, 
 
10 Among 
Korean 10th- to 12th-grade never 
cigarette smokers, current (30-day) 
e-cigarette users were more likely 
to have been diagnosed with asthma 
and had 15.4 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 5.1–45.7) times the 
odds of missing ≥4 days of school 
in the past year due to asthma 
than did never e-cigarette users. 
11 
Adolescents who use e-cigarettes, 
but not cigarettes, show fewer 
of the psychosocial risk factors 
associated with smoking than do 
cigarette-smoking adolescents (but 
more than never e-cigarette users), 
such as rebelliousness, sensation 
seeking, and prevalence of peer 
smoking.12, 
 
13 Longitudinal research 
consistently shows that never-
smoking adolescent e-cigarette users 
are more likely than never e-cigarette 
users to subsequently start smoking 
cigarettes. 
14 
 
– 
18
At the same time that e-cigarette use 
was increasing, cigarette smoking 
among youth declined, 
 
2, 
 
19 leading 
some to suggest that e-cigarettes are 
replacing conventional cigarettes 
among youth. 
20 
–22 Researchers 
23 and 
popular media 
24 
– 
26 have suggested 
that e-cigarettes are contributing to 
recent declines in youth smoking, 
and some have suggested that 
restricting e-cigarettes may harm 
public health.27, 
 
28 Two analyses of the 
effects of enacting laws that prohibit 
the sales of e-cigarettes to youth aged 
<18 years reported that these laws 
were associated with increases of 
0.9% 
27 and 0.8% 
28 in the absolute 
prevalence of cigarette smoking 
among adolescents. Neither of these 
reports measured e-cigarette use. 
In contrast, results from Southern 
California indicated that e-cigarette 
use is occurring in adolescents who 
would not otherwise have used 
tobacco products. 
29 We used the 
2004–2014 National Youth Tobacco 
Survey (NYTS) to assess whether 
the decline in adolescent cigarette 
smoking changed after e-cigarettes 
entered the US market (around 
200730 
 
– 
33) and the extent to which 
e-cigarettes are attracting youth who 
would be unlikely to begin nicotine 
use with cigarettes on the basis of 
known psychosocial predictors of the 
onset of cigarette use.
METHODS
Sample
We used data from the 2004, 2006, 
2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 
school-based paper-and-pencil 
NYTS, a repeated, cross-sectional, 
nationally representative, 3-stage 
cluster (counties, schools, grades) 
sample of sixth- to 12th-graders 
(ages 9–21). 
34 School response 
rates ranged from 75% in 2013 to 
93% in 2004, and student response 
rates varied from 88% in 2004, 
2006, and 2011 to 93% in 2009. 
34 
Participants with missing values 
for demographic characteristics, 
psychosocial predictor variables, ever 
or current smoking, e-cigarette use 
(available in 2011–2014 surveys), 
or use of tobacco products other 
than cigarettes or e-cigarettes were 
excluded from this analysis (6.6% in 
2004 to 10.1% in 2009 and 2011 who 
were missing data), yielding analytic 
samples of 15 664 in 2013 to 24 690 
in 2004.
Measures
Cigarette Smoking
“Ever smokers” were those who 
responded “yes” to “Have you ever 
tried cigarette smoking, even 1 or 2 
puffs?” “Current smokers” reported 
the use of cigarettes during the past 
30 days on at least 1 day. We also 
examined number of days smoked 
in the past 30 days among current 
smokers (1–2 days, 3–5 days, 6–9 
days, 10–19 days, 20–29 days, or all 
30 days).
E-cigarette Use
E-cigarettes were first included in the 
NYTS in 2011. From 2011 through 
2014, participants were “ever 
e-cigarette users” if they replied 
“electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes” 
to “Which of the following tobacco 
products have you ever tried, even 
just one time?” Participants were 
defined as “current e-cigarette 
users” if they reported the use of 
e-cigarettes during the past 30 days 
on at least 1 day.
Never smokers with a missing 
response for 30-day smoking were 
considered noncurrent smokers. 
Never e-cigarette users with a 
missing response for 30-day 
e-cigarette use were considered 
noncurrent e-cigarette users.
Other Tobacco Use
We included ever and current use 
of all tobacco products besides 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes that were 
assessed in every NYTS conducted 
between 2004 and 2014: chewing 
tobacco, snuff, or dip; cigars, 
cigarillos, or little cigars; tobacco in 
a pipe; or bidis. Respondents who 
reported ever using any of these 
products (ie, other than cigarettes 
or e-cigarettes) were considered 
“ever other” tobacco users, and those 
who reported using them in the past 
30 days were considered “current 
other” tobacco users. The prevalence

of other tobacco use did not change 
significantly between 2004 and 
2014, averaging 5.1% for ever use 
and 4.4% for current use (P for trend 
with time: .26 and .81, respectively).
Psychosocial Risk Factors
We examined psychosocial risk 
factors for cigarette smoking or 
e-cigarette use identified in previous 
research that were also available 
for the 2004–2014 NYTS data. 
Continuous psychosocial variables 
included the following:
“Do you think the smoke from other 
people’s cigarettes is harmful to 
you?”
“If one of your best friends offered 
you a cigarette, would you smoke 
it?”
“Do you think you will smoke a 
cigarette at any time during the 
next year?”
“Do you think smoking cigarettes 
makes young people look cool or fit 
in?” and
“Would you ever use or wear 
something that has a tobacco 
company name or picture on it 
such as a lighter, t-shirt, hat, or 
sunglasses?” 
Response options were “definitely 
yes, 
” “probably yes, 
” “probably 
not, 
” and “definitely not.” We also 
examined the questions “How 
many of your closest friends smoke 
cigarettes?” as a continuous predictor 
variable (response options were 
none and 1, 2, 3, or 4; unavailable for 
2012) and “Does anyone who lives 
with you now smoke cigarettes?” (yes 
or no) as a dichotomous predictor. 
All variables were coded so that 
higher values reflected higher risk of 
cigarette smoking.
Covariates
Male sex (reference: female); non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, or non-
Hispanic other race (reference: non-
Hispanic white); and continuous age 
were included in all adjusted models 
as covariates.
Analysis
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention–provided stratification 
variables were included to adjust 
for clustered sampling techniques. 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention–provided weights were 
included to adjust for nonresponse 
and to match sample characteristics 
to national estimates. 
35 We used 
SAS surveyfreq (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC) to compute the prevalence of 
ever and current cigarette smoking, 
e-cigarette use, and other tobacco use 
and days smoked per month for each 
year.
Time Series Analysis
We conducted an interrupted time 
series analysis of the impact of the 
appearance of e-cigarettes on the US 
market on youth cigarette smoking 
prevalence over time. We accounted 
for the uncertainty in prevalence at 
each time point by using Stata 12.0 
meta-regression, which incorporates 
95% CIs for prevalence in addition 
to point estimates (StataCorp, 
College Station, TX). We tested for 
a slope change in the rate of decline 
in cigarette smoking by including a 
variable that was zero before 2009 
and equal to (year–2009) beginning 
in 2009 (ie, 0 in 2009, 1 in 2010, 
etc). We used 2009 because it was 
the closest wave of NYTS data to 
2007, when e-cigarettes entered the 
US market. 
30 
 
– 
33 It was unnecessary 
to adjust for clustering variables 
and weights in the meta-regression 
because we used SAS surveyfreq–
generated prevalence and SEs 
(adjusted by weights and clustering 
variables) in the meta-regression. We 
examined changes in demographic 
characteristics across NYTS waves 
to determine whether we needed to 
include demographic variables in the 
meta-regression. We found a slight 
increase in the prevalence of Hispanic 
participants over time. Because 
including Hispanic ethnicity in the 
meta-regression model induced 
collinearity (variance inflation 
factor = 23.0), we did not adjust for 
demographic characteristics in the 
meta-regression.
Psychosocial Model To Predict Cigarette 
Smoking
We developed a psychosocial model 
of cigarette smoking to estimate the 
probability that e-cigarette users 
would have initiated nicotine use 
with cigarettes. We hypothesized 
that, if e-cigarettes are attracting 
youth who would have smoked 
cigarettes eventually, e-cigarette–
only users would display many 
of the psychosocial risk factors 
associated with conventional 
cigarette use, including the following: 
rebelliousness, 
 
12 sensation seeking, 
 
12 
peer smoking prevalence, 
 
12, 
 
13, 
36 
living with someone who smokes, 
 
13 
positive attitudes toward cigarettes, 
 
13 
parental smoking, 
 
36 likelihood 
of smoking in the next year, 
 
37 
likelihood of accepting a cigarette 
from a friend, 
37 and use of other 
tobacco products. 
38 Alternatively, if 
e-cigarettes are attracting low-risk 
youth, 
 
12, 
 
13 e-cigarette–only users 
would have a low probability of 
smoking cigarettes.
We used SAS proc surveylogistic 
to develop the predictive model 
of cigarette smoking using the 
pooled 2004–2009 data. We used 
percentage concordance between 
model-estimated and self-reported 
smoking to determine the best-
fitting model (ie, which psychosocial 
variables to include). We included 
all psychosocial variables significant 
in bivariate analyses of either ever 
or current smoking, as well as time 
(year, centered on 2009). We also 
tested for interactions between time 
and all other predictor variables 
to test for changes in predictor 
variables across waves.
After developing the final models 
on the basis of the 2004–2009 
data, we applied the resulting 
logistic regression equations to 
the 2011–2014 data to predict 
respondents’ odds of ever or

current smoking (odds ratio [OR] 
>1.0 classified as smokers, OR <1.0 
classified as nonsmokers). We used 
SAS surveyfreq to compare model-
estimated smoking prevalence 
with self-reported cigarette and 
e-cigarette–only use for 2011–2014.
We tested the model by splitting 
the pooled 2004–2009 data in half, 
at random, 4 times and then used 
the first half of the data to estimate 
the model and the second half to 
test the model’s predictive ability. 
The coefficients in the model used 
to predict smoking behavior in the 
2011–2014 data were computed for 
the entire 2004–2009 sample.
RESULTS
Changes in Cigarette and E-cigarette 
Use Over Time
Ever smoking decreased from 
40.0% in 2004 to 22.1% in 2014 
( 
Fig 1). Total ever use of cigarettes 
or e-cigarettes accounting for dual 
use decreased slightly from 29.8% in 
2011 (26.5% cigarettes only, 3.0% 
dual use, and 0.3% e-cigarettes only) 
to 28.6% in 2014 (8.7% cigarettes 
only, 13.4% dual use, and 6.5% 
e-cigarettes only).
Current smoking decreased from 
15.8% in 2004 to 6.4% in 2014. Total 
combined current use of cigarettes 
and e-cigarettes accounting for dual 
use ( 
Fig 1) increased from 11.4% in 
2011 (10.3% current cigarettes only, 
0.8% current dual use, and 0.3% 
current e-cigarettes only) to 12.2% 
for 2014 (2.8% current cigarettes 
only, 3.6% current dual use, and 
5.8% current e-cigarettes only). 
Among current smokers, infrequent 
smoking (1–2 days/month) increased 
from 25.9% in 2004 to 37.6% in 
2014. Daily smoking decreased from 
28.8% in 2004 to 21.5% in 2014.
Change in Decline in Cigarette 
Use After the Introduction of 
E-cigarettes
Ever cigarette smoking, including 
dual use after 2011, showed a 
continuous linear decline over the 
study period (2004–2014; P = .009), 
with no significant slope change after 
the introduction of e-cigarettes in 
2009 (P = .57;  
Fig 1). Likewise, there 
was a decline in current smoking 
(P = .05) that did not change after the 
introduction of e-cigarettes (P = .23; 
 
Fig 1).
Psychosocial Predictive Model
On the basis of the full 2004–2009 
data set, the following characteristics 
were significantly associated with 
higher odds of cigarette smoking 
( 
Table 1): Hispanic, non-Hispanic 
black, or non-Hispanic other race/
ethnicity; older age; willingness 
to wear clothing with a tobacco 
company logo; living with a smoker; 
higher likelihood of smoking in 
the next year; higher likelihood of 
accepting a cigarette from a friend; 
and other tobacco product use. 
Male sex and the passage of time 
was associated with lower odds 
of smoking (smoking prevalence 
declined over time). With the use of 
the entire 2004–2009 sample, the 
model correctly classified 70.6%

e-cigarettes (dark-gray, cross-hatched shading). E-cigarette–only users (light-gray shading) are in 
addition to youth who are smoking cigarettes and are at low risk of having initiated tobacco products 
with cigarettes. (E-cigarette use, defi
 ned by using the same criteria as cigarettes, was assessed 
starting in 2011.)

of ever smokers as ever smokers 
and 75.3% of past-30-day smokers 
as current smokers. (These values 
are similar to the results from the 
4 randomly generated validation 
samples, which correctly classified 
between 70.0% and 70.7% of ever 
smokers as ever smokers and 
between 74.0% and 76.7% of past-
30-day smokers as current smokers.)
There were no significant 
interactions between time and the 
predictor variables in the model of 
ever smoking. There were significant 
interactions for time and male sex 
(P = .007) and the likelihood of smoking 
in the next year (P = .03) for current 
smoking. The influence of male sex on 
current smoking increased over time 
(OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02–1.14); for 
each 1-year increase in time, the odds 
of current smoking were 8% higher 
for males than for females. The 
influence of the likelihood of smoking 
in the next year on 30-day smoking 
status declined over time (OR: 0.97; 
95% CI: 0.94–0.997); for each 1-year 
increase in time, the odds of being 
a current smoker in the next year 
decreased by a factor of 0.97. Because 
including the interaction terms did 
not improve percentage concordance 
in the predictive model, and effect 
estimates changed little, we did not 
include the interaction term in the 
final model for ever smoking. When 
both interaction terms were included, 
the ORs (95% CIs) of ever smoking 
were 0.95 (0.77–1.17) for male sex, 
2.97 (2.62–3.36) for the likelihood of 
smoking in the next year, and 0.95 for 
time (0.90–1.01) compared with 0.76 
(0.69–0.83) for male sex, 2.29 (2.10–
2.49) for the likelihood of smoking in 
the next year, and 0.93 (0.91–0.96) 
for time when the interaction terms 
were not included.
Model-Estimated Cigarette Smoking 
Among Self-Reported Cigarette and 
E-cigarette–Only Use, 2011–2014
The psychosocial model predicted 
between 3.2% and 6.9% of never 
users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes 
as ever cigarette smokers, between 
40.7% and 52.2% of e-cigarette–only 
users as ever smokers, and between 
68.6% and 70.3% of participants 
who reported ever having smoked 
cigarettes (including dual users 
with e-cigarettes) as ever smokers 
between 2011 and 2014 ( 
Table 
2). The model classified between 
1.8% (2014) and 5.9% (2013) of 
respondents who reported neither 
smoking nor using e-cigarettes in 
the past 30 days as current smokers, 
between 11.0% (2012) and 23.1% 
(2013) of past-30-day e-cigarette–
only users as current cigarette 
smokers, and between 75.1% 
(2013) and 76.9% (2012) of past-
30-day cigarette smokers as current 
cigarette smokers.
DISCUSSION
Youth ever and current cigarette 
smoking decreased from 2004 
to 2014. The downward trend in 
cigarette smoking (including dual 
users) was not affected by the 
introduction of e-cigarettes. Because 
of increases in e-cigarette–only use, 
combined 30-day use of cigarettes 
and e-cigarettes (accounting for dual 
use) was higher in 2014 than in 2011.
Although most (75%–77%) of 
the youth who reported smoking 
cigarettes in the past 30 days 
(including dual users of cigarettes 
and e-cigarettes) in 2011–2014 
had risk profiles (based on 
2004–2009 data) consistent with 
smoking cigarettes, only 11%–23% 
of e-cigarette–only users were 
predicted to be current cigarette 
smokers. Participants who did not 
use cigarettes or e-cigarettes were 
least likely to be predicted to be 
cigarette smokers. These findings 
are consistent with the existing 
literature showing that e-cigarette–
only users display a lower risk profile 
than cigarette smokers for smoking 
cigarettes. 
12, 
 
13, 
 
36, 
 
37
The use of e-cigarettes among 
nonsmoking youth is of concern 
because 4 longitudinal studies 
suggest that youth and young adults 
who initiate use with e-cigarettes 
have 3 times the odds of becoming 
cigarette smokers 1 year later. 
14 
 
 
–18 
Never-smoking low-risk youth who 
use e-cigarettes may be more likely 
to go on to initiate cigarette smoking 
compared with never-smoking

NYTS between 2004 and 2014: chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip; cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars; tobacco in a pipe; or bidis.

low-risk youth who are not using 
e-cigarettes. 
39 Two cross-sectional 
studies in youth 
40, 
 
41 indicate that, 
like adults, 
 
42 youth smokers who are 
using e-cigarettes want to quit but 
are less likely to be former smokers. 
Many e-cigarette users also smoke 
cigarettes, 
43 but this fact does not 
change the finding that e-cigarettes 
appear to be attracting some low-risk 
youth.
Consistent with our results, CNA 
Analytics and Solutions 
44 used 2002–
2006 NYTS data to create a primarily 
demographic characteristic–based 
predictive model (year, sex, race/
ethnicity, grade level, age, and living 
with a smoker) of cigarette smoking 
and chewing tobacco use and applied 
it to youth in the 2011–2014 NYTS. 
They found a higher prevalence of 
e-cigarette use among 2011–2014 
NYTS participants who their model 
categorized as at high risk of cigarette 
smoking and/or using chewing 
tobacco as well as e-cigarette users 
that met their criteria for being at 
low risk of smoking and/or using 
chewing tobacco.
State and local governments have 
responded to research on e-cigarettes 
by including e-cigarettes in smoke-
free and retailer licensing laws, 
 
45, 
 
46 
which may affect use. In May 2016, 
the Food and Drug Administration 
issued a “deeming” rule asserting 
jurisdiction over e-cigarettes, 
 
47 but 
took no steps to regulate aggressive 
television advertising, 
 
48 product 
placement in movies, 
49 youth-
friendly flavors, 
 
50 
– 
52 nicotine 
content, 
 
53, 
54 or health claims 
(including cessation). 
50 Banning 
advertising is particularly important 
because recent research reveals 
that youth exposed to e-cigarette 
advertising perceived less harm from 
occasional or light smoking than do 
youth who are not exposed. 
55
Limitations
This analysis uses cross-sectional 
data, so we cannot conclude that 
the presence of e-cigarettes in the 
marketplace caused a change (or 
lack thereof) in the prevalence of 
cigarette smoking. However, we 
did not find any evidence of such 
a change. Because of the cross-
sectional nature of the data, we also 
could not determine whether dual 
users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes 
initiated use with cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes. The NYTS does not 
include school dropouts, who 
may have higher tobacco use than 
adolescents who stay in school. The 
NYTS questionnaire items assessing 
the use of other tobacco products 
varied over time (Supplemental 
Table 3), so we only included those 
products assessed at all waves. The 
NYTS did not assess the frequency 
of e-cigarette use before 2014. The 
2011–2014 NYTS also did not ask 
participants whether the e-cigarettes 
they were using contained nicotine, 
meaning that our total estimate of 
combined cigarette and e-cigarette 
use likely contains some youth who 
used nicotine-free e-cigarettes.
Conclusions
Consistent with regional data from 
Southern California, 
 
29 the lack of 
a demonstrable acceleration in 
the long-term rate of decline in 
youth smoking prevalence after the 
introduction of e-cigarettes does 
not support the hypothesis that this 
decline is due to youth substituting 
e-cigarettes for conventional 
cigarettes. In contrast, the rapid 
increase in e-cigarette use by youth 
resulted in higher levels of 30-day 
use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes in 
2014 than in 2011. The observation 
that youth who initiate use with 
e-cigarettes are more likely to start 
smoking conventional cigarettes 
14 
 
– 
18 
and, among smokers, are less likely

to have stopped smoking 
17, 
 
40, 
 
41 also 
raises the possibility that the long-
term decline in cigarette smoking we 
observed will reverse in future years.
Indeed, the 2015 NYTS data 
56 raise 
concerns that this process may be 
starting. The small decline in middle 
school smoking between 2014 and 
2015 (2.5% to 2.3%) and the small 
increase in high school smoking 
(9.2% to 9.3%) are consistent with 
longitudinal research suggesting 
that youth who initiated use with 
e-cigarettes only (ie, in 2014) are 
more likely to be smoking cigarettes 
a year later 
14 
 
– 
18 (ie, in 2015).
Clinicians should assess the use 
of all tobacco products (including 
cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and other 
tobacco products) to accurately 
capture adolescent tobacco use, 
keeping in mind that this behavior 
is evolving. E-cigarettes should be 
included in smoke-free laws, state 
tobacco control programs, taxed 
to lower youth initiation, and sales 
of products with youth-friendly 
flavors prohibited. State and national 
media campaigns (particularly the 
Truth Initiative’s “truth, 
” the Food 
and Drug Administration’s The Real 
Cost, and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s Tips From 
Former Smokers campaigns) should 
educate youth that e-cigarettes are 
not harmless and attract youth at 
low risk of initiating tobacco use with 
conventional cigarettes, and that their 
use predicts higher chances of going 
on to smoke conventional cigarettes.
