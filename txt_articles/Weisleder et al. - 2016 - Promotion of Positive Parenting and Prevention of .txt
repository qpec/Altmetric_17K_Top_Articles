abstract
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine what effects pediatric primary care 
interventions, focused on promotion of positive parenting through reading aloud and play, 
have on the socioemotional development of toddlers from low-income, primarily immigrant 
households.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included random assignment to 1 of 2 
interventions (Video Interaction Project [VIP] or Building Blocks [BB]) or to a control 
group. Mother–newborn dyads were enrolled postpartum in an urban public hospital. 
In VIP, dyads met with an interventionist on days of well-child visits; the interventionist 
facilitated interactions in play and shared reading through provision of learning materials 
and review of videotaped parent–child interactions. In BB, parents were mailed parenting 
pamphlets and learning materials. This article analyzes socioemotional outcomes from 14 
to 36 months for children in VIP and BB versus control.
RESULTS: A total of 463 dyads (69%) contributed data. Children in VIP scored higher than 
control on imitation/play and attention, and lower on separation distress, hyperactivity, 
and externalizing problems, with effect sizes ∼0.25 SD for the sample as a whole and ∼0.50 
SD for families with additional psychosocial risks . Children in BB made greater gains in 
imitation/play compared with control.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the efficacy of VIP, a preventive intervention targeting 
parent–child interactions, for enhancing socioemotional outcomes in low-income toddlers. 
Given the low cost and potential for scalability of primary care interventions, findings 
support expansion of pediatric-based parenting programs such as VIP for the primary 
prevention of socioemotional problems before school entry.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Differences 
in socioemotional development are an important 
contributor to poverty-related disparities in 
school readiness. It is unknown whether pediatric 
interventions seeking primary prevention of disparities 
by promoting parent–child interactions through reading 
aloud and play can enhance socioemotional outcomes.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This randomized controlled 
trial demonstrated the effects of pediatric-based 
interventions focused on promoting positive parenting 
through reading and play on socioemotional outcomes 
of toddlers from low-income families. Findings support 
the effi
 cacy of a primary preventive intervention with 
high potential for scalability.

Poverty-related disparities in child 
development and school readiness 
emerge early in childhood and widen 
over time,1–3 placing disadvantaged 
children at risk for lower educational 
attainment.4,5 Addressing these 
disparities is a national priority, as 
evidenced by American Academy 
of Pediatrics policy and recent 
federal initiatives.6,7 The present 
article examines the potential for 
pediatric-based primary preventive 
interventions to reduce poverty-
related disparities in school 
readiness by enhancing children’s 
socioemotional development.
Socioemotional development is a 
core component of school readiness, 
affecting children’s school adjustment 
and academic performance.8–11 
Critical socioemotional factors 
associated with children’s transition 
to school and long-term academic 
trajectories include attention, social 
competence, and behavior.8,11,12 
Although positive parenting plays a 
critical role in supporting children’s 
socioemotional development,13,14 
poverty is associated with 
reductions in responsive parent–
child interactions.15–17 Promotion 
of positive parenting during early 
childhood is a promising avenue 
for enhancing socioemotional 
development in low-income children 
in general, and it may be especially 
important for children at increased 
risk due to family psychosocial 
factors.18,19
Pediatric primary health care 
provides a significant opportunity for 
population-level, primary prevention 
of school readiness disparities 
through promotion of positive 
parenting (eg, using the Reach 
Out and Read [ROR] and Healthy 
Steps programs),20–22 given the 
frequency and near universality of 
well-child visits and the opportunity 
to leverage existing health care 
infrastructure. Previous studies 
have shown that this platform 
can be effectively used to enhance 
socioemotional development through 
promotion of positive parenting 
in children with already-identified 
behavioral problems (eg, using the 
Incredible Years program).23–25 
However, it is unknown whether 
pediatric interventions seeking the 
primary prevention of disparities 
through promotion of parent–child 
interactions in reading aloud and 
play can also enhance socioemotional 
development.
We addressed this gap through a 
study of 2 pediatric, primary care–
based preventive interventions: 
the Video Interaction Project (VIP) 
and Building Blocks (BB). VIP was 
designed as an enhancement to ROR, 
adding an interventionist who uses 
videorecordings of the parent and 
child interacting to promote parents' 
self-reflection and encourage positive 
parenting behaviors.26 Previous 
studies of VIP have shown beneficial 
effects on parent–child interactions 
and reduced family psychosocial 
stressors, including maternal 
depression and parenting stress.27–30 
BB is a lower intensity intervention 
that uses mailed newsletters 
highlighting positive parenting 
strategies. BB has also been shown 
to enhance responsive parenting 
and reduce maternal depressive 
symptoms, although the effects are 
smaller.27,28
The present article describes findings 
from a randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) examining the effects 
of VIP and BB on parenting, child 
development, and school readiness. 
The present analyses examined 
effects of VIP and BB on children’s 
socioemotional development from 14 
to 36 months, a primary outcome of 
the RCT. We hypothesized that: (1) 
socioemotional outcomes would be 
improved in VIP and BB compared 
with the control group, with stronger 
effects of VIP given its higher 
intensity and previous evidence of 
greater impacts; and (2) intervention 
effects would be larger in families 
with increased psychosocial risk.
METHODS
Study Design
A single-blind, 3-way RCT entitled 
the Bellevue Project for Early 
Language, Literacy and Education 
Success (BELLE) was conducted at 
an urban public hospital serving low-
income families (Bellevue Hospital 
Center).27 Consecutive enrollment 
of mother–child dyads occurred in 
the postpartum unit, with 675 dyads 
enrolled. Approval was obtained 
from the Institutional Review Board 
at the New York University School of 
Medicine, Bellevue Hospital Center, 
and the New York City Health and 
Hospitals Corporation. The initial 
study design included follow-up of all 
groups at 6, 14, 24, and 36 months. 
Financial constraints, however, led 
to limited follow-up of BB families 
at 24 months and no follow-up at 36 
months.
Randomization Groups
After enrollment, dyads were 
randomized to VIP, BB, or control by 
using a random number generated 
by the project director by using 
Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft 
Corporation, Redmond, WA). Group 
assignments were concealed from 
staff and study participants until 
enrollment was completed.
VIP
VIP sessions occur at regularly 
scheduled pediatric visits beginning 
in the first month, totaling 15 
possible sessions through age 3 
years. An interventionist meets with 
families in 1-on-1 sessions for 25 to 
30 minutes. Parent–child dyads are 
videorecorded during 5- to 7-minute 
play/shared reading interactions by 
using a developmentally appropriate 
toy and/or book provided by the 
program. The interventionist reviews 
the video along with the parent to 
identify and reinforce responsive 
interactions and promote parent 
self-reflection. The video is given to 
the parent to promote generalization 
of identified behaviors in the home;

pamphlets provide suggestions 
related to positive parenting during 
play, reading, and daily routines, as 
well as opportunities for parents 
to develop their own plans for 
interacting with their child. When 
possible, the same interventionist 
meets with each family at each 
session. Interventionists typically 
have bachelor’s degrees in fields 
related to young children and receive 
training and supervision by Bellevue 
Project for Early Language, Literacy, 
and Education Success Project 
leadership. VIP has an estimated cost 
of $150 to $200 per child per year.26
BB
BB utilizes mailed information and 
learning materials to improve parent 
self-efficacy and promote positive 
parenting. Each month, parents are 
mailed a toy or book, along with a 
newsletter that provides information 
on encouraging learning and ideas 
for interactions around a specific 
developmental goal. Parents are also 
asked to complete Ages and Stages 
developmental questionnaires31 
every 4 to 6 months. BB has an 
estimated cost of $75 to $100 per 
child per year.
Control
Control families received 
standard pediatric care, including 
recommended anticipatory guidance 
and monitoring. Standard pediatric 
care included ROR for all groups.
Participants
Enrollment occurred between 
November 2005 and October 
2008, as previously described.27 
Consecutive mother–infant dyads 
meeting inclusion criteria and 
providing informed consent were 
enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: 
plans to receive pediatric care at 
Bellevue Hospital Center; term birth; 
no significant medical complications 
or eligibility for early intervention 
at birth; and a mother who was the 
primary caregiver, aged ≥18 years, 
spoke primarily English or Spanish, 
and was able to maintain contact 
with the program.
Measures
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Information on sociodemographic 
characteristics was collected during 
the postpartum period through 
interviews with the mother, as 
previously described.27 At the 
6-month assessment, maternal 
literacy was assessed in the mother’s 
preferred language by using the 
Woodcock-Johnson III/Woodcock-
Muñoz Bateria III Letter-Word 
Identification Test32; for cases with 
missing literacy data, educational 
level was used as a proxy.
Families were considered to be 
at increased psychosocial risk if 
the mother reported ≥1 of the 
following: being a victim of violence, 
homelessness, involvement with 
child protective services, significant 
financial hardship, food insecurity, 
cigarette smoking or alcohol use 
during pregnancy, or history of 
previous mental illness.
Dependent Variables
At 14 and 24 months, socioemotional 
outcomes were assessed via mother 
interviews by using 3 subscales 
from the Infant–Toddler Social and 
Emotional Assessment-Revised 
(ITSEA)33: imitation/play, attention, 
and separation distress. These 
subscales were selected to assess 
key dimensions of socioemotional 
development at this age, including 
social skills, attention, and behavior. 
The ITSEA includes items describing 
behaviors that the parent rates 
as “not true/rarely,” “somewhat 
true/sometimes,” or “very true/
often,” with scores ranging from 0 
to 2. It is available in English and 
Spanish and has been validated in 
children aged 12 to 36 months. At 
the 14-month assessment, the ITSEA 
was not included in the protocol until 
∼4 months into the process; thus, 
although the 14-month assessment 
was performed for 327 families, the 
ITSEA was collected for 242 families 
at this age.
At the 36-month assessment, 
interviews were conducted with 
mothers by using 4 subscales from 
the Parent Rating Scales of the 
Behavior Assessment System for 
Children–Second Edition (BASC-2)34: 
social skills, attention problems, 
hyperactivity, and aggression. The 
BASC-2 has been normed for use in 
English and Spanish. T scores (mean 
± SD: 50 ± 10) were calculated for 
each subscale, and a composite score 
was computed for externalizing 
problems (hyperactivity and 
aggression). Clinically at-risk 
behavior was defined based on the 
manual as a T score ≥60 for attention 
problems, hyperactivity, aggression, 
and externalizing problems; a T score 
≤40 was used for social skills.
Statistical Analysis
A total of 225 families were enrolled 
per group, providing 80% power 
to detect a minimum effect size 
(ES) of 0.33 SD, assuming 33.3% 
attrition by age 3 years. Statistical 
analyses were performed based 
on an intention-to-treat model. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 
χ2 tests were used to compare 
sociodemographic characteristics 
between randomization groups and 
to compare families who contributed 
data on at least 1 time point versus 
those who did not.
For 14- and 24-month outcomes, 
ANOVA was used, followed by Tukey 
post hoc testing, to compare ITSEA 
mean scores between randomization 
groups. Socioemotional development 
was then compared over time by 
using multilevel modeling with 
Stata SE 12 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX); this approach allowed 
us to test group differences while 
accounting for repeated measures. 
Separate multilevel modeling was 
performed for each subscale. We 
first calculated a model with age 
and group predicting ITSEA mean 
scores; a second model was then 
3

WEISLEDER et al 
computed that included group-by-
age interaction terms. Multilevel 
models adjusted for all baseline 
sociodemographic characteristics; 
child age was included as a random 
effect. In the main effects models, 
coefficients represent the difference 
in scores for VIP or BB compared 
with control across the entire 14- to 
24-month period; in interaction 
models, coefficients represent the 
difference in slope (change from 
14 to 24 months) for VIP or BB 
compared with the control.
For 36-month outcomes, t tests 
were used to compare BASC-2 T 
scores between VIP and the control. 
Findings for ES were calculated by 
using Cohen’s d, which reflects mean 
differences between groups in SD 
units. We performed χ2 analyses to 
compare proportions of children 
with clinically at-risk behaviors. To 
assess whether intervention effects 
were more pronounced for higher 
risk families, subgroup analyses 
were performed comparing VIP 
and control children of mothers 
at increased psychosocial risk. To 
examine dose–response effects, 
piecewise regressions were 
performed with the number of VIP 
sessions completed as predictor 
variables.
RESULTS
Study Sample
A total of 463 (69%) of 675 families 
contributed data on socioemotional 
outcomes at ≥1 assessment point 
(analytic sample) (Fig 1), including 
78% of VIP and control participants 
and 49% of BB participants (BB 
follow-up was lower due to financial 
constraints, as described earlier). 
Descriptive statistics for dyads in 
the analytic sample are provided 
in Table 1. Mothers were primarily 
Hispanic/Latino and born outside the 
United States; 34% of families were 
at increased psychosocial risk. VIP 
families completed a median of 9.5 
sessions; 67% of families completed 
one-half or more sessions, whereas 
15% completed fewer than one-third 
(5 sessions).
Dyads contributing data did not 
significantly differ from those who 
did not contribute data for maternal 
age, literacy, psychosocial risk, or 
birth order. However, mothers 
contributing data were less likely 
to have graduated high school or be 
living with a partner, and they were 
more likely to be Hispanic/Latina, 
immigrants, of lower socioeconomic 
status, and speak Spanish as their 
primary language (all P < .01); 
children in the analytic sample 
were more likely to be female (P 
< .05). Importantly, there were no 
differences in sociodemographic 
characteristics according to 
randomization group for participants 
in the analytic sample (Table 1).

Primary Analyses
Table 2 displays the socioemotional 
outcomes as a function of group at 
the 14- and 24-month assessments. 
At 14 months, ANOVA tests showed 
significant differences between 
groups for imitation/play (P < .01) 
but not for attention (P = .75) or 
separation distress (P = .20). Tukey’s 
honestly significant difference post 
hoc testing at 14 months found that 
VIP children had higher imitation/
play scores than BB children (P < 
.01), with an ES based on Cohen’s 
d of 0.49; post hoc comparison of 
VIP and the control did not reach 
statistical significance (ES: 0.31; P 
< .1). At 24 months, ANOVA tests 
showed differences between groups 
for attention (P < .05); differences 
in imitation/play (P = .30) and 
separation distress (P = .07) did not 
reach statistical significance. Post 
hoc testing at 24 months showed that 
VIP children had significantly higher 
attention scores than control subjects 
(ES: 0.30; P < .05). There were no 
significant effects of BB at 14 or 24 
months.
Figure 2 displays the trajectories 
of intervention effects on 
socioemotional development 
from 14 to 24 months. Results 
of multilevel modeling (Table 3) 
found a significant main effect of 
VIP for imitation/play (P < .05) 
and separation distress (P < .05), 
indicating that VIP children were 
more advanced in imitation/play 
and had lower separation distress 
than control children throughout 
this period. The main effect of VIP on 
attention did not reach significance 
(P = .08); however, there was a 
significant positive interaction 
between VIP and age (P < .05), 
indicating that VIP children made 
greater gains in attention between 
14 and 24 months than control 
children. There were no significant 
main effects of BB. However, there 
was a significant positive interaction 
between BB and age for imitation/
play (P < .05), indicating that BB 
children made greater gains in 
imitation/play between 14 and 24 
months than children in the control 
group.
Table 4 displays socioemotional 
outcomes at 36 months for the 
sample as a whole and for families 
at increased psychosocial risk. VIP 
children had significantly reduced 
hyperactivity (ES: 0.27; P < .05) and 
externalizing problems (ES: 0.27; P < 
.05) compared with control children. 
Although VIP children also tended 
to have lower aggression scores, 
this finding did not reach statistical 
significance (ES: 0.20; P < .1) for the 
sample as a whole. Among higher 
risk families, VIP children had lower 
aggression scores than those in the 
control group (ES: 0.48; P < .05), 
as well as reduced hyperactivity 
(ES: 0.55; P < .01) and externalizing 
problems (ES: 0.57; P < .01).
Table 5 presents the proportion of 
children that reached thresholds 
for clinically at-risk behaviors 
on the BASC-2 at 36 months. No 
statistically significant differences 
were found in the proportion of 
children with at-risk scores for the 
sample as a whole. Among families 
at increased psychosocial risk, VIP 
children were significantly less 
likely than control children to be 
at risk for hyperactivity (15% vs 
41%; P < .01) and externalizing 
problems (11% vs 30%; P < .05); 
these findings corresponded to an 
absolute risk reduction for VIP of 
26% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
8%–43%) for hyperactivity and 18% 
(95% CI: 2%–34%) for externalizing 
problems, and a relative risk 
reduction for VIP of 63% (95% 
CI: 23%–82%) for hyperactivity 
and 62% (95% CI: 8%–84%) for 
externalizing problems. Among 
families at higher psychosocial 
risk, 4 VIP families (95% CI: 2–12) 
would need to receive VIP to 
prevent 1 child from being in the 
at-risk category for hyperactivity, 
and 5 (95% CI: 3–44) would need 
to receive VIP to prevent 1 child 
from being in the at-risk category 
for externalizing problems. Among 
higher risk families, VIP children 
tended to be less likely than control 
children to be in the at-risk category 
for aggression (8% vs 20%) and 
social skills (0% vs 7%), but these 
findings did not reach statistical 
significance (P < .1)
Within-group analyses were 
conducted of dose effects for 
families randomized to receive 
VIP. In piecewise regressions, a 
dose–response was seen for each 
additional visit completed beyond 
the first 5 visits for hyperactivity 
(B = 1.00, β = –0.26, P < .05) and 
externalizing problems (B = 0.80, 
β = –0.24, P < .05). This outcome is 
equivalent to a reduction in T score of 
1 unit for every visit beyond the fifth 
visit for hyperactivity and of 0.8 U

There was no significant change

DISCUSSION
The present study found that 
low-cost, pediatric parenting 
interventions beginning in early 
infancy and delivered before the 
identification of behavior problems 
can have meaningful effects on 
socioemotional development during 
the toddler period. These findings 
are important because of increasing 
evidence that socioemotional 
capacities are critical to school 
readiness and predict a range of 
adult outcomes across domains of 
education, employment, criminal 
activity, substance use, and mental 
health.8,10,11,35,36
Overall, we found strong effects of 
VIP on children’s socioemotional 
outcomes, with more limited impacts 
of BB. In particular, VIP produced 
positive effects on key aspects 
of socioemotional development 
beginning at 14 months and 
extending through 36 months, 
including enhanced imitation and 
attention, and reduced separation 
distress, hyperactivity, and 
externalizing problems. The presence 
of effects across multiple time points

and domains of socioemotional 
development provides strong 
support for VIP’s impacts during the 
toddler period. We did not document 
effects of BB at any single time point; 
however, BB infants made greater 
gains in imitation/play from 14 to 
24 months compared with control 
infants, suggesting that there may 
be some positive effects of this very 
low intensity intervention. Stronger 
effects for VIP compared with BB are 
consistent with the idea that specific 
characteristics of VIP, such as the 
relationship with the interventionist 
and use of videotaping to promote 
self-reflection, are important for 
achieving these outcomes. An 
important implication of our work is 
that relationship-based interventions 
should be strongly considered as 
policy makers seek to address school 
readiness disparities.
The ES findings for VIP were 
within the range of those found for 
interventions using other platforms 
(eg, home visiting, community-
based programs) that tend to have 
higher costs.37,38 These averaged 
0.25 SD for the sample as a whole 
and were even greater (0.50 SD) for 
children in families with additional 
psychosocial risks. For higher risk 
families, the relative risk reduction 
for clinically at-risk hyperactivity and 
externalizing behaviors due to VIP 
was >60%, which, together with the 
low number needed to treat (4 and 
5, respectively), suggest potential for 
substantial benefits.
One of the most important scientific 
and policy implications of the present 
study is that interventions focused 
on promotion of activities such 
as reading aloud and play may be 
effective in enhancing socioemotional 
development, in addition to their 
well-documented role in enhancing 
cognitive-language outcomes.39,40 
Indeed, most existing parenting 
interventions shown to affect 
socioemotional outcomes in young 
children include direct teaching of 
discipline strategies.23,41 Notably, VIP 
affects socioemotional development 
without teaching these strategies, 
instead focusing on promotion of 
responsive parent–child interactions 
in the context of activities such as 
reading aloud and play that are 
typically considered to be cognitively 
oriented.
This study had 3 main limitations. 
First, because of resource 
limitations, there was no follow-up 
of the BB group past 24 months; 
findings related to BB should 
therefore be interpreted with 
caution. Second, socioemotional 
outcomes were based on parent 
report, which, while obtained by 
using reliable and standardized 
instruments, can be subject to bias. 
Third, participating mothers were 
primarily first-generation Hispanic/
Latino immigrants; results may 
not be generalizable to families 
with other sociodemographic 
characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS
This study showed that pediatric 
primary care interventions focused 
on promotion of positive parenting 
through reading aloud and play 
can enhance socioemotional 
development among children in 
poverty. Given the potential for low
