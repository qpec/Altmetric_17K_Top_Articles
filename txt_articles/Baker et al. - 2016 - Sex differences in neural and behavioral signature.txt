Researchers from multiple fields have sought to understand how sex moderates human social behavior. 
While over 50 years of research has revealed differences in cooperation behavior of males and females, 
the underlying neural correlates of these sex differences have not been explained. A missing and 
fundamental element of this puzzle is an understanding of how the sex composition of an interacting 
dyad influences the brain and behavior during cooperation. Using fNIRS-based hyperscanning in 111 
same- and mixed-sex dyads, we identified significant behavioral and neural sex-related differences in 
association with a computer-based cooperation task. Dyads containing at least one male demonstrated 
significantly higher behavioral performance than female/female dyads. Individual males and females 
showed significant activation in the right frontopolar and right inferior prefrontal cortices, although 
this activation was greater in females compared to males. Female/female dyad’s exhibited significant 
inter-brain coherence within the right temporal cortex, while significant coherence in male/male dyads 
occurred in the right inferior prefrontal cortex. Significant coherence was not observed in mixed-sex 
dyads. Finally, for same-sex dyads only, task-related inter-brain coherence was positively correlated 
with cooperation task performance. Our results highlight multiple important and previously undetected 
influences of sex on concurrent neural and behavioral signatures of cooperation.
Research into the neuroscience of social behavior has highlighted a frontal-temporal network in the brain that 
underlies social cognition1–4. Converging evidence from this field indicates that multiple sub-regions of the prefron-
tal cortex (PFC) are largely concerned with determining future behavior on the basis of anticipated value of different 
social actions. Using fMRI, distinct cognitive functions related to social value judgments have been identified within 
the anterior rostral medial PFC5–7, posterior rostral PFC8–10, and orbital medial PFC8,10–12. Similar to the PFC, dis-
tinct sub-regions of the occipital-temporal-parietal cortex have been implicated in cognitive functioning related 
to person-centered social processing such as interpretation of biological motion13, perception of bodily action 
and goals2,3,14–16, theory of mind2,3,14–16, and computational processes associated with the sense of agency15,17–20. 
An important drawback to this research is that the majority of studies investigating the neural correlates of social 
cognition are conducted on a single person in isolation. As a result, very little is currently understood about how the 
human brain responds to real-world social interaction, and how such responses may relate to cooperation behav-
ior21. Recent advancements in simultaneous neuroimaging of multiple brains (i.e., hyperscanning) using functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have revealed increases in inter-brain coherence that results from naturalistic 
cooperation between two people22–24. That is, when engaged in a computer-based cooperation task, the right pre-
frontal cortex within both members of an interacting dyad becomes synchronized during the task compared to 
rest22,23. Furthermore, increases in coherence have been associated with increased task performance22,23, suggesting 
that a mechanistic association may exist between inter-brain coherence and cooperative behavior.

Recent findings suggest that inter-brain coherence during cooperation may be mediated by the sexual makeup 
of the interacting pair. Indeed, researchers have hypothesized that disparate evolutionary pressures experi-
enced between males and females may have resulted in sex-related differences in cooperation within modern 
humans25–27. That is, an evolutionary history rich with hunting and warfare may have resulted in male/male dyads 
tendency towards a cooperation strategy that differs from that of females, who historically maintained differ-
ent social roles. Interestingly, Cheng and colleagues23 report mixed-sex dyads exhibited significant inter-brain 
coherence in regions of the prefrontal cortex during cooperation, whereas same-sex dyads did not. Furthermore, 
increased inter-brain coherence in mixed-sex dyads was associated with increased cooperation task performance. 
As the authors report, these findings suggest that “different neural processes underlie cooperation between 
mixed-sex and same-sex dyadic interactions”
. These findings raise important empirical questions regarding the 
influence of sex on neural and behavioral signatures of cooperation and highlight the utility of fNIRS hyperscan-
ning in addressing sex differences in social interactions.
A significant shortcoming of the study reported by Cheng and colleagues is the inability to identify the role 
of sex on signatures of inter-brain coherence within regions of the temporal cortex. Given our understanding of 
the different socio-cognitive processes expressed throughout the frontal-temporal network, it is likely that dispa-
rate patterns of inter-brain coherence may emerge throughout this network between male/male, female/female, 
and male/female dyads engaged in cooperation. The identification of disparate patterns of inter-brain coherence 
throughout the frontal-temporal social network between same- and mixed-sex dyads may provide important 
information regarding the underlying source of sex-related differences in cooperation. Here, we test the hypoth-
esis that the sexual make-up of a cooperating dyad moderates signatures of cortical activation and inter-brain 
coherence within multiple fontal-temporal brain regions associated with social cognition. To address this hypoth-
esis, we employed fNIRS hyperscanning to concurrently image regions of the right prefrontal and right temporal 
cortices as same- and mixed-sex dyads engaged in a computer-based cooperation task.
Methods
Participants. 
A total of 222 participants (Nfemale = 
 110) were recruited for participation. Each participant 
completed a computer-based cooperation task with either a male or female partner (male/male = 
 39, male/
female = 
 34, female/female = 
 38). Each participant was unacquainted with his or her partner and participants 
were not permitted to interact prior to participation. Age and ethnicity were not matched across participants. All 
participants were right handed and had normal or corrected to normal vision and hearing. Informed consent was 
obtained from both dyad members prior to participation. The Stanford University Institutional Review Board 
approved all aspects of our experiment. The experiment was performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines 
and regulations.
Cooperation Task. 
The participants were seated on opposite sides of a square table, in front of a separate 
computer screen and keyboard (Fig. 1A). Task instructions and three practice trials were provided prior to begin-
ning. Each trial began with a hollow grey circle appearing in the center of their computer screen for an unpredict-
able duration between 0.6 and 1.5 seconds. A rapid change in the color of the circle from black to green initiated 
a button press response from both participants. In order to win points for each trial, the participants had to match 
their button presses closely in time so that the latency between button presses was less than 
+

, where R1 
and R2 are the response times for both participants respectively. Immediately following the slower member’s 
button press (i.e., second button press of the trial) a ‘+ 
’ and ‘− 
’ sign was presented in the top portion of both 
participant’s screens and which identified the faster/slower responder for each trial. The symbol on both partici-
pants’ left hand side of the screen corresponded to their response speed relative to their partner. Thus, participants 
could use this information to adjust their response speed on subsequent trials.
The cooperation (i.e., coordination) task consisted of two 120 s task blocks, separated by a 30 s rest period. A 
total of 40 trials were completed within each task block. Dependent on the inter-response latency within each 
trial, a “Win” or “Lose” label was provided at the top of both participants’ screens, along with their point total. 
Each dyad began the task with 100 points and was instructed to earn as many points as possible throughout the 
game. Each dyads average performance (i.e., #wins/40) was calculated for both task blocks (Fig. 1B).
fNIRS Optode Arrangement. 
A continuous wave fNIRS (ETG-4000, Hitachi, Japan) was used to assess 
cortical hemodynamic activity in each dyad member’s right PFC and right temporal cortex. The ETG-4000 sys-
tem provides users with versatile probe arrangements that may accommodate 24, 48, or 52 recording channels 
depending on the pre-defined probe configuration selected (i.e., 3 × 
 3, 3 × 
 5, 4 × 
 4, or 3 × 
 11). In previous stud-
ies22,23, a single 3 × 
 5 optode patch (i.e., 22 recording channels) was situated over the hyperscanning partici-
pants’ PFC. Here a 3 × 
 5 optode patch was broken down into one 3 × 
 3 (i.e., 12 channels) and one 2 × 
 3 (i.e., 7 
channels) optode patch. For each dyad member, the medial edge of the 3 × 
 3 optode patch was aligned over the 
inion-to-nasion midsagital line, and the inferior edge was situated directly over the brow. Four three-channel 
regions were sub-divided to create four regions of interest in the PFC corresponding to the right inferior PFC, 
right frontopolar PFC, right superior PFC, and right dorsal lateral PFC (Fig. 2A). The remaining 2 × 
 3 optode 
patch covered a single region of interest corresponding to the right temporal cortex (Fig. 2B). Consistent place-
ment of the right temporal optodes was accomplished by placing the anterior edge of the 2 × 3 optode patch over 
each participants interauricular arc and the inferior edge of the patch directly above the T4 10/20 location. In this 
manner, a significant portion of the frontal-temporal cortical regions involved in social cognition network was 
simultaneously assessed within both participants.

Analysis of fNIRS Data. 
Cortical activation analyses. Task related cortical activation was assessed by a 
general linear model approach28. For this analysis, all fNIRS data was pre-processed using Matlab-based func-
tions derived from Homer 2. First, the raw optical density data was motion corrected using a wavelet-based 
motion artifact removal process29. Next, the motion corrected data were band-pass filtered using the low- and 
high-pass parameters of 0.5 and 0.01 respectively. The filtered optical density data were then converted to 
oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) values by way of the modified Beers-Lambert law30,31. 
Only oxy-hemoglobin data were used for the analysis. Next, within each fNIRS recording channel a standardized 
beta-value was estimated for the cooperation task and inter-block rest period respectively. The task-related acti-
vation values were then contrasted with the inter-block rest value, providing an indicator of the degree of change 
in cortical activation during the task compared to rest. Positive contrast values indicate greater activation during 
the cooperation task compared to rest. The contrast values for each channel within each region of interest were 
then averaged together, resulting in five contrast values per participant.

participants were seated in front of their own computer screen and keyboard. Each trial began with a hollow 
gray circle appearing in the center of the screen for an unpredictable duration between 0.6 and 1.5 seconds. An 
abrupt change in the color of the circle from black to green initiated the participant’s response. Following both 
responses, a “win” or “lose” message was presented, depending on whether the inter-response latency of both 
participants was less than

The symbol on both participants’ left hand side of the screen corresponded to their response speed relative the

Inter-brain coherence analyses. For each region of interest, the cross-correlation between the fNIRS signals gen-
erated by each dyad during the cooperation task was measured using wavelet transform coherence. Specifically, 
channel-wise coherence was calculated using the WTC package (http://noc.ac.uk/using-science/
crosswavelet-wavelet-coherence) in Matlab. This method is capable of identifying locally phase-locked behavior 
between two time-series that might not be discoverable with traditional time series analyses such as Fourier anal-
ysis. Of primary interest for our study was the inter-brain coherence that occurred within the task-specific fre-
quency band between periods 3.2 and 12.8 s (corresponding to frequency 0.3 Hz and 0.08 Hz, respectively). 
Therefore, the mean of all wavelet values within this frequency band was calculated for both cooperation blocks, 
and the inter-block rest period. Inter-brain coherence values were then averaged amongst each channel that com-
prised a region of interest. Task-related coherence was defined as the mean coherence within blocks one and two 
of the cooperation task. Next, coherence increase was defined as the task-related coherence minus the average 
coherence during rest

. A positive mean-coherence difference value indicates that the 
inter-brain coherence between dyads during cooperation was greater than the coherence that occurred during 
rest. All coherence values were converted to standardized z-values prior to statistical analysis22,23,32.
Results
Behavioral Outcomes. 
Behavioral cooperation task performance between male/male, male/female, and 
female/female dyads was assessed by a three-way analysis of variance. This analysis identified a significant main 
effect of dyad pairing (F(2, 208) = 
 6.256, p = 
 0.002), indicating that performance differed between groups. 
Pairwise comparisons indicated that female/female dyads had significantly fewer ‘winning’ trials than both male/
male (t(151.84) = 
 3.136, FDR p = 
 0.003) and male/female (t(140.19) = 
 3.117, FDR p = 
 0.004) dyads. These results 
indicate that for our task, dyads containing at least one male resulted in significantly greater cooperation perfor-
mance than female only dyads (Fig. 3).
Cortical Activation Outcomes. 
First, we identified those cortical regions of interest that responded signif-
icantly to our task in individual participants. To achieve this objective, we conducted FDR corrected one-sample 
t-tests on GLM task vs. rest beta contrast values for all participants within each of our five regions of interest. This 
analysis revealed significant activation in the right frontopolar (t(195) = 2.569, FDR p = 0.027) and right inferior 
(t(194) = 
 4.497, FDR p < 
 0.001) prefrontal cortices (Fig. 4A). Pairwise comparisons of activation across each 
region highlighted a significant difference between the right inferior and right temporal regions (t(357) = 
 4.113, 
FDR p < 
 0.001). Next, we further investigated activation differences across males and females within the right 
frontopolar and right inferior regions of interest. The contrast values from these regions were submitted to a 2 
Figure 3. Cooperation performance across dyads. Analysis of variance identified significant performance 
differences across groups (p = 0.002). Specifically, male/male (p = 0.003) and male/female (p = 0.004) 
significantly outperformed female/female groups. The bold mid-line within each box and whisker plot provides 
the median performance for each group. Each box represents the cooperation task performance distribution 
for 50% of the dyads within each sex pairing. The whiskers extending from each colored box represent the 
minimum and maximum performance, and the dots represent outlying performance. Outliers were defined as 
any value less than or equal to 1.5 times the group inter-quartile range.

(sex) × 
 3 (group: male/male, male/female, female/female) × 
 2 (regions of interest) ANOVA. This analysis revealed 
a significant main effect of sex (F(1, 188) = 
 6.189, p = 
 0.013), indicating that, for our task, female participants 
exhibited significantly greater cortical activation than males within the right frontopolar and inferior prefrontal 
cortices (Fig. 4B). No other comparisons were significant.
In order to investigate the degree to which cortical activations differed across males and females separately, 
we conducted identical analyses as reported above on each group individually. FDR corrected one-sample t-tests 
indicated that females exhibited significant activation within the right frontopolar (t(94) = 
 2.915, FDR p = 
 0.014), 
right inferior prefrontal (t(93) = 5.138, p < 0.001), and the right dorsolateral prefrontal (t(94) = 3.452, p = 0.004) 
cortices. A 3 (regions of interest) × 2 (group: male/female, female/female) ANOVA did not reveal any significant 
differences in cortical response across regions of interest or group. Moreover, no significant effects were identified 
for males alone.
Inter-brain Coherence Outcomes. 
As reported previously22–24,33–40, analysis of inter-brain coherence 
increase effectively identifies regions of the cortex that become significantly correlated between members of a 
dyad during cooperation. In order to replicate previous results and identify cortical regions of interest for fur-
ther investigation as reported below, we first analyzed the patterns of coherence increase that arose across each 
dyad type (male/male, male/female, female/female). To that end, FDR corrected one-sample t-tests were con-
ducted on the coherence increase values for each group across each region of interest. This analysis identified 
significant coherence increase in male/male pairs within the right inferior prefrontal cortex (t(35) = 
 2.197, FDR 
p = 
 0.020). Moreover, female/female dyads exhibited significant coherence increase within the right temporal cor-
tex (t(36) = 3.859, FDR p = 0.005). Based on these outcomes, our regions of interest for all remaining inter-brain 
coherence analyses were reduced to the right inferior prefrontal and right temporal cortices. Next, the coherence 
increase values were submitted to a 3 (group) × 
 2 (regions of interest) ANOVA. This analysis revealed a signifi-
cant main effect of group (F(2, 204) = 
 4.033, p = 
 0.019), driven by significantly less coherence increase in male/
female compared to male/male (t(133.18) = 
 2.672, FDR p = 
 0.023) and female/female (t(132.58) = 
 2.162, FDR 
p = 
 0.050) groups. Furthermore, this analysis revealed a significant group × 
 region interaction (F(2, 204) = 
 3.021, 
p = 
 0.050). Independent-sample t-tests applied between all groups within both regions of interest highlighted 
significantly greater coherence increase in male/male dyads right inferior prefrontal cortex compared to both 
female/female (t(70.891) = 
 2.025, FDR p = 
 0.046) and male/female (t(63.631) = 
 3.12, FDR p = 
 0.003) dyads. 
Conversely, the coherence increase in female/female dyads right temporal region was significantly greater than 
male/female dyads (t(56.141) = 
 2.096, FDR p = 
 0.039), but did not differ significantly from male/male dyads 
(t(69.764) = 1.407, FDR p > 0.05) (Fig. 5).
Relationship Between Cooperation Behavior and fNIRS Data. 
Cortical activation. In order to 
identify underling mechanistic processes that may connect fNIRS signals with real-time cooperation behavior, 
we investigated the relationship between task performance and cortical activation. Linear regression was used to 
assess the degree to which participant’s cooperation task performance predicted cortical activation. No significant 
relationship between cortical activation and cooperation performance was identified.
Figure 4. Cortical activation during cooperation. (A) Investigation of cortical activation across each region 
of interest identified significant increases in activation relative to rest within the right frontopolar (p = 0.027) 
and right inferior (p < 0.001) regions. Pairwise comparisons revealed significant activation differences between 
the right inferior and right temporal (p < 0.001). (B) Female participants elicited significantly greater cortical 
activation compared to males (p = 0.013).

Task-related inter-brain coherence. We employed an identical linear regression analysis as reported above to 
assess the relationship between cooperation performance and inter-brain coherence. Of primary interest was the 
strength of this relationship that occurred during cooperation. Thus, for this analysis we used cooperation task 
performance to predict task-related inter-brain coherence within each region of interest (i.e., mean coherence 
within each region during blocks 1 and 2 of the cooperation task). This analysis identified a positive relationship 
between performance and task-related coherence, indicating that greater task performance coincided with greater 
task-related inter-brain coherence (r = 
 0.603, p = 
 0.024) (Fig. 6A). Next, we conducted a series of identical lin-
ear regression analyses on each dyad type (male/male, male/female, female/female) individually. These analyses 
identified significant positive relationships between cooperation performance and task-related coherence across 
all regions of interest within male/male (r = 
 0.862, p = 
 0.035) and female/female dyads (r = 
 1.195, p = 
 0.012). This 
relationship was not significant for male/female dyads (Fig. 6B). When further stratified across the regions of 
interest, a significant relationship between cooperation task performance and inter-brain coherence was identi-
fied within the right temporal region for female/female dyads (r = 0.323, p = 
 0.028). No other comparisons were 
significant.
Discussion
Here, we employed fNIRS hyperscanning to image multiple regions of the frontal-temporal social network of 
same- and mixed-sex dyads during an interactive cooperation game. Our results indicate that sex, as a biological 
variable, significantly influences cooperation behavior, cortical activations, location of inter-brain coherence, 
and the interactions between inter-brain coherence and cooperation behavior. These results provide new and 
fundamental information regarding the underlying cognitive sources of cooperation differences between males 
and females.
Interestingly, groups containing at least one male performed significantly better than female/female dyads on 
our cooperation task. These results indicate that males engaged a behavioral strategy that benefited cooperation 
performance, and that only one member of a dyad needed to engage this strategy for the dyad as a whole to be rel-
atively more successful during cooperation. In terms of task-related cortical activation, our data indicate that the 
cooperation task elicited significant prefrontal activity, although follow-up analyses indicated that this effect was 
driven by activation in female participants. The cortical regions demonstrating such cooperation task-related acti-
vation coincide with Brodmann Area 10 (BA10). Based on our current understanding of the neural correlates of 
social cognition, significant activation in this region may be related to multitasking (i.e., retrieval of higher order 
goals) and theory of mind41,42. More specifically, BA10 has been shown to activate during passive viewing of coop-
erative interactions43, to be engaged during tasks involving cooperation in two-person decision-making games44, 
and to subserve person perception and mentalization1. In conjunction with behavioral cooperation performance 
reported above, it is noteworthy that task-related activation in BA10 was greater in females, and coincided with 
female’s poorer behavioral performance. Thus, we may speculate that females required increased executive

increase in inter-brain coherence was identified in male/male groups’ right inferior pre-frontal cortex 
(p = 0.020), and was significantly greater than male/female (p = 0.003) and female/female (p = 0.046) groups. 
Moreover, a significant increase in inter-brain coherence was identified in female/female groups right temporal 
cortex (p = 0.005). Female/female coherence in this region was significantly greater than male/female group 
coherence (p = 0.039).

functioning processes throughout the cooperation task, which may have negatively influenced their cooperation 
performance in terms of person perception and mentalization. However, by nature of a single-person cortical 
activation analysis, the degree to which two members of an interacting dyad simultaneously engage the same cog-
nitive processes remains unknown. Contrary to the above individual task-related results, significant inter-brain 
coherence in BA10 during cooperation was only identified within male/male dyads. These results are important, 
as they provide evidence that both members of male/male dyads similarly engaged this region throughout our 
cooperation task. Thus, we hypothesize that male/male dyads engaged a cognitive strategy wherein both players 
attempted to understand their partner’s intentions and motives, which was sustained by BA10. The coincident 
engagement of this region between both members of a male/male dyad may have helped drive superior behavioral 
performance throughout our cooperation task and resulted in stronger inter-brain coherence within this region.
Besides revealing significant behavioral as well as task-related and inter-brain coherence patterns in prefrontal 
cortex, our data also show significant effects in regions of the temporal cortex overlapping with BA21 & 22. These 
areas have been implicated in social perception, action observation, and theory of mind45. For instance, Yang 
and colleagues23 highlight the right superior temporal sulcus as an important component in “temporal predictive 
encoding of human behavior” and “temporal integration of the key elements in the environment”
. Furthermore, 
the posterior superior temporal cortex has been described as the “region considered most central to the recog-
nition of human actions” in terms of biological motion, action processing, and the representation of specific 
actions20. For our cooperation task, we observed significantly increased inter-brain coherence in temporal cortex 
for female/female dyads. Such pattern may suggest that female players relied predominantly on action-centered 
social cognitive processes during cooperation. While adherence to this cognitive strategy between females pos-
itively influenced cooperation performance, overall female/female cooperation performance was significantly 
lower than male/male and male/female performance. Thus, these data suggest that action-centered cooperation 
strategies may be less optimal for our cooperation task.
Male/female dyads performed significantly better on our cooperation task compared to female/female dyads, 
and comparable to male/male dyads. Unlike male/male dyads, male/female cooperation performance was not 
accompanied by significant task-related increase in inter-brain coherence in any cortical region that we targeted. 
Furthermore, unlike same-sex dyads, there was no significant association between task-related inter-brain coher-
ence and cooperation task performance in mixed-sex pairs. We hypothesize that the lack of significant inter-brain 
coherence in mixed-sex dyads may be indicative of different cognitive strategies employed by males and females 
during cooperation. Notably, the results of Cheng and colleagues23, which employed the same cooperation task 
used here, identified significant coherence within mixed- but not same-sex dyads. However, because Cheng and 
colleagues focused solely on the prefrontal cortex, the role of sex on inter-brain coherence patterns within their 
participant dyads’ right temporal cortex is unknown. The discrepancy between their results and ours may simply 
be due to sample size differences between studies; Cheng and colleagues23 reported findings from 14 male/male, 
15 female/female, and 16 male/female dyads, which represents less than half of our sample size within each group 
(i.e., 39 male/male, 38 female/female, 34 male/female). Alternatively, an intriguing possibility is that cultural 
differences between study populations drawn from predominantly Asian compared to Western societies led to 
differential patterns of inter-brain coherence during cooperation46. Future research is needed to further eluci-
date the role of culture and society on neural and behavioral signatures of cooperation. Nevertheless, our results

within these groups, indicating that greater behavioral performance coincided with enhanced inter-brain 
coherence. Conversely, this relationship within male/female pairs was non-significant (p = 0.537, r = − 
0.147).

suggest that the lack of significant inter-brain coherence within frontal-temporal brain regions does not adversely 
affect behavioral cooperation performance. We may speculate that high behavioral cooperation performance may 
be maintained when only one member of an interacting dyad engages an optimal cooperation strategy. Future 
research is needed to determine the extent to which social behavior may be influenced when members of an 
interacting dyad engage different cognitive strategies.
Our data highlight predictive relationships between inter-brain coherence and cooperation performance 
within same- but not mixed-sex dyads. Importantly, this relationship was significant for all dyad types combined, 
as well as for both same-sex dyads individually. Furthermore, when stratified across dyad types and regions of 
interest, this relationship within same-sex dyads closely mirrors the patterns of inter-brain coherence increases 
reported above. That is, within female/female dyads, the relationship between inter-brain coherence and behav-
ioral cooperation performance was significant within the right temporal brain region only. Within male/male 
dyads, the relationship between inter-brain coherence and cooperation performance was strongest in the right 
inferior prefrontal region. However, unlike for female/female dyads, this analysis narrowly missed the statistical 
rejection criterion (i.e., p = 
 0.062). These findings suggest that greater adherence to sex-specific cognitive strate-
gies throughout our cooperation task, which manifest through greater inter-brain coherence in different regions 
of the frontal-temporal network, coincided with better behavioral performance relative to dyads that employed 
different strategies and thus showed less task-related inter-brain coherence.
Finally, our findings demonstrate that the location of cortical activation and inter-brain coherence do not nec-
essarily coincide. As overlapping increases in both measures was identified in the right inferior prefrontal cortex, 
significant cortical activation with no inter-brain coherence was identified in the frontopolar region. Moreover, 
significant increases in female/female inter-brain coherence without coincident cortical activation was identified 
in the right temporal cortex. These results highlight the utility of assessing multiple aspects of fNIRS hyperscan-
ning data when investigating social cognition. For example, analysis of cortical activations alone would fail to 
identify the role of the right temporal region throughout cooperation, and would focus results on sex differences 
in executive functioning during cooperation. Conversely, sole focus on inter-brain coherence would fail to iden-
tify sex differences in cortical activation.
Limitations and Future Directions
The results of this study provide new, fundamental information regarding the influence of sex on concurrent neu-
ral and behavioral signatures of cooperation within multiple regions of the social cognition network. While our 
study is the first to detail the signatures of cooperation-related inter-brain coherence that emerges within multiple 
regions of the frontal and temporal cortices, there is little doubt that important aspects of social cognition are 
associated with other brain regions that, due to the physical limitations of our fNIRS device, we were unable to 
target. Emergent advances in fNIRS technology that provide more recording channels should make it possible to 
cover more regions of the brain in future hyperscanning studies focused on social cognition. Future hyperscan-
ning research that investigates signatures of inter-brain coherence occurring in the context of ecologically valid 
cooperation tasks will also be valuable in advancing our knowledge in this area. The cooperation task that we 
used was originally developed by our group22 as a basic computer-based form of cooperation, and it has been used 
elsewhere for the same purpose23. However, it is possible that naturalistic cooperation may elicit different signa-
tures of cortical activation and inter-brain coherence. Fortunately, the portability of newer fNIRS devices makes it 
possible to interrogate these processes in the context of more real-world cooperation tasks. Finally, it is important 
that future efforts be made to optimize approaches for quantifying the relationship between inter-brain coher-
ence and cooperation behavior. Here, we simply regressed the average task-related coherence that occurred in 
both task blocks onto cooperation task performance. We see this as an advantage, as this approach may easily be 
adapted to real-time feedback applications. That is, the relationship between a pairs’ average coherence and task 
performance may be calculated and displayed in real-time. However, this method differs from Cheng and col-
leagues23, in which a correlation was made between coherence increase (i.e., task - rest) and coherence difference 
(i.e., block 2 - block 1). Future research is needed to evaluate, compare and optimize these and other approaches.

In this Article, the authors mistakenly used the abbreviation “r” instead of “b” to refer to the beta coefficients 
resulting from the analysis of the relationship between cooperation behavior and task-related inter-brain coher-
ence. All statistical outcomes and their interpretations remain unaffected and unchanged. As a result,
“This analysis identified a positive relationship between performance and task-related coherence, indicating that 
greater task performance coincided with greater task-related inter-brain coherence (r = 
 0.603, p = 
 0.024) (Fig. 6A). 
 
Next, we conducted a series of identical linear regression analyses on each dyad type (male/male, male/female, 
female/female) individually. These analyses identified significant positive relationships between cooperation per-
formance and task-related coherence across all regions of interest within male/male (r = 
 0.862, p = 
 0.035) and 
female/female dyads (r = 1.195, p = 0.012). This relationship was not significant for male/female dyads (Fig. 6B). 
 
When further stratified across the regions of interest, a significant relationship between cooperation task per-
formance and inter-brain coherence was identified within the right temporal region for female/female dyads 
(r = 0.323, p = 0.028). No other comparisons were significant.”
