BACKGROUND
Taeniasis and cysticercosis are major causes of seizures and epilepsy. Infection by the 
causative parasite Taenia solium requires transmission between humans and pigs. The dis-
ease is considered to be eradicable, but data on attempts at regional elimination are 
lacking. We conducted a three-phase control program in Tumbes, Peru, to determine 
whether regional elimination would be feasible.
METHODS
We systematically tested and compared elimination strategies to show the feasibility of 
interrupting the transmission of T. solium infection in a region of highly endemic disease 
in Peru. In phase 1, we assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of six intervention strate-
gies that involved screening of humans and pigs, antiparasitic treatment, prevention educa-
tion, and pig replacement in 42 villages. In phase 2, we compared mass treatment with 
mass screening (each either with or without vaccination of pigs) in 17 villages. In phase 3, 
we implemented the final strategy of mass treatment of humans along with the mass 
treatment and vaccination of pigs in the entire rural region of Tumbes (107 villages com-
prising 81,170 people and 55,638 pigs). The effect of the intervention was measured after 
phases 2 and 3 with the use of detailed necropsy to detect pigs with live, nondegenerated 
cysts capable of causing new infection. The necropsy sampling was weighted in that we 
preferentially included more samples from seropositive pigs than from seronegative pigs.
RESULTS
Only two of the strategies implemented in phase 1 resulted in limited control over the 
transmission of T. solium infection, which highlighted the need to intensify the subse-
quent strategies. After the strategies in phase 2 were implemented, no cyst that was ca-
pable of further transmission of T. solium infection was found among 658 sampled pigs. 
One year later, without further intervention, 7 of 310 sampled pigs had live, nondegener-
ated cysts, but no infected pig was found in 11 of 17 villages, including all the villages 
in which mass antiparasitic treatment plus vaccination was implemented. After the final 
strategy was implemented in phase 3, a total of 3 of 342 pigs had live, nondegenerated 
cysts, but no infected pig was found in 105 of 107 villages.
CONCLUSIONS
We showed that the transmission of T. solium infection was interrupted on a regional scale 
in a highly endemic region in Peru. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 
and others.)

I
nfection of the human brain by cys-
tic larvae of the pork tapeworm species Taenia 
solium is the most frequent cause of late-onset 
seizures and epilepsy in the world.1,2 Transmis-
sion is sustained in rural areas through a pig–
human cycle in which humans harbor the adult 
intestinal tapeworm (taeniasis) and pigs carry 
the cystic larvae in their flesh (cysticercosis). In 
poor, rural villages, domestic pig husbandry and 
lack of sanitation allow pigs to become infected 
by consuming human feces containing tapeworm 
eggs. In turn, humans acquire taeniasis by con-
suming pork contaminated with larval cysts or 
acquire neurocysticercosis through incidental in-
gestion of tapeworm eggs.
In 1992, the International Task Force for Dis-
ease Eradication determined that T. solium was 
eradicable.3,4 Over the ensuing decades, however, 
attempts to control transmission have been lim-
ited to studies targeting one or two villages; 
some of the attempts had no effect at all and 
most have had only transitory effects at best. 
Interventions have attempted to control taeniasis 
in the human population through targeted or 
mass human antiparasitic therapy5-10 or to control 
cysticercosis in pigs through prevention educa-
tion9 and immunotherapy11 and antiparasitic treat-
ment12,13 of pigs. The important advances that 
were made during this period, including the 
development of new diagnostic techniques, less-
expensive and more-efficacious treatments, and 
a highly effective pig vaccine, suggested that 
regional elimination was feasible.14-16 Our objec-
tive was to systematically test and compare 
elimination strategies to determine the feasibil-
ity of interrupting the transmission of T. solium
infection in a highly endemic region in Peru.
 
Methods
 
Program Overview
This program was a multi-institutional effort 
among two Peruvian universities (Universidad 
Peruana Cayetano Heredia and San Marcos Uni-
versity), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of 
Public Health, and the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. To determine the feasi-
bility of eliminating T. solium in rural regions of 
the study area (Tumbes Region, northern coast 
of Peru) (Fig. 1), we used a three-phase design to 
select the most effective and practical combina-
tion of human and animal interventions (Ta-
ble 1). The outcomes of the three phases were 
measured in pigs, because the rapid turnover of 
this population allows for the timely assessment 
of overall transmission. Human disease was not 
measured as an outcome because neurocysticer-
cosis may manifest years after infection, and the 
low prevalence of taeniasis (0.5 to 1.0%) makes 
it difficult to assess changes.

In the mass‑treatment and strategic‑treatment groups, humans received mass treatment with niclosamide (NM); in phases 1 and 2, post‑
treatment stool samples were obtained for analysis by microscopy and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for coproantigen de‑
tection. People with persistent taeniasis were retreated and followed until cured. In phase 3, post‑treatment stool samples were obtained 
only after the first round of mass treatment with niclosamide. In phases 1 and 2, pigs in the mass‑treatment and minimal‑mass‑treatment 
groups were administered oxfendazole (OXF) and those in the strategic‑treatment group were administered OXF at baseline, with longitudi‑
nal treatment of pigs born into or entering the study villages (OXFc). One group of pigs in phase 2 and all pigs in phase 3 were administered 
OXF in addition to vaccination (VAC) with the TSOL18 pig vaccine (vaccine was administered in two doses spaced 3 weeks apart).
†  
In phases 1 and 2, humans were screened by both ELISA for coproantigen detection and light microscopy of stool; niclosamide was admin‑
istered only in those with evidence of taeniasis. Pig serum samples were screened by enzyme‑linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay, which 
uses lentil lectin‑bound glycoproteins; OXF was administered only in those pigs that were seropositive.
‡  
Prevention education (EDU) was the reference strategy in phase 1.
§  
The pig replacement strategy involved removing pigs from the community and replacing them with noninfected pigs (CULL).

Study Oversight
The study was reviewed and approved by the 
main institutional review board at Universidad 
Peruana Cayetano Heredia, by the Ethical Com-
mittee of Animal Welfare of the School of Vet-
erinary Medicine, San Marcos University, and by 
the Peruvian Institute of Health — all in Lima, 
Peru. All the authors vouch for the completeness 
and accuracy of the data and analyses and for 
the fidelity of the study to the protocol, which is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
Phase 1
In phase 1, we compared the effectiveness and 
feasibility of six intervention strategies in 42 vil-
lages along the eastern margin of the Tumbes 
River (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The strategies included 
mass treatment, minimal mass treatment, mass 
screening, strategic treatment, prevention educa-
tion, and pig replacement. Mass treatment in-
volved mass administration of niclosamide for 
human taeniasis and oxfendazole for porcine 
cysticercosis; minimal mass treatment involved 
fewer rounds of the same drugs applied over a 
shorter period. Strategic treatment involved ad-
ministration of oxfendazole only to pigs born 
into or entering the study villages (details of the 
intervention strategies are provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). All 
medicines (niclosamide for humans and oxfenda-
zole for pigs) and tests, as well as the porcine 
vaccine TSOL18, were acquired for the study 
and provided to villagers at no cost (our program 
purchased the medicines and sent funds to the 
University of Melbourne for the production of the 
vaccine, which was produced with the assistance 
of one of the authors). The main outcome was 
the incidence of antibodies against T. solium cysti-
cercosis in all pigs as measured by serologic test-
ing every 3 months; prevention education was the 
reference strategy. Phase 1 interventions began 
in December 2004 and continued for 1 year.
Phase 2
The two most effective strategies from phase 1 
— minimal mass treatment and mass screening 
— were selected and modified (increasing the 
number of treatment rounds and shortening the 
interval between treatments) for head-to-head 
comparison. A total of 17 larger villages along 
the western margin of the Tumbes River were 
assigned to one of four study groups (mass 
treatment or mass screening, each either with or 
without vaccination of pigs) (Table 1). The mass 
screening strategy was modified, for logistic 
reasons, by replacing pig screening with mass 
chemotherapy in pigs, although screening for 
taeniasis in humans was still performed. We 
administered the TSOL18 vaccine14,15 in two sub-
groups to assess the additional effect of pig vac-
cination. Because of the high background sero-
positivity rate noted in the pigs with negative 
findings on necropsy in phase 1, we changed 
our outcome measure to the prevalence of pigs 
with live, nondegenerated cysts on necropsy 
(Fig. 2).
Phase 2 interventions began in January 2007. 
Within 1 month after the last round of treat-
ment, we attempted to purchase all seropositive 
pigs (despite our efforts, not all pigs were able 
to be purchased), as well as a random 5% sam-
ple of seronegative pigs, for necropsy. One year 
after the completion of the interventions, we 
performed a second round of necropsies using 
the same sampling strategy we used in the first 
round, although fewer seronegative pigs were 
included because infection was rare in seronega-
tive animals.
Phase 3
A final elimination strategy of mass chemo-
therapy with niclosamide in humans and with 
oxfendazole in pigs, in combination with pig 
vaccination (final mass treatment with vaccine), 
was implemented in all 107 rural villages in 
Tumbes Region over a period of 1 year (Fig. 1 
and Table 1). The outcome measure was the 
prevalence of pigs with live, nondegenerated 
cysts on necropsy. Because of the greatly ex-
panded scale of the intervention, the sampling 
strategy was changed to limit the number of 
necropsies, while increasing the likelihood of 
detecting infected pigs. We systematically sam-
pled all pigs between the ages of 6 and 8 months 
because these pigs were born during the inter-
vention period and were old enough to have a 
reduced likelihood of persistent maternal anti-
bodies.17 We attempted to purchase all seroposi-
tive pigs that had three or more reactive bands 
on Western blot analysis for necropsy, because 
prior necropsies showed that the most viable 
infections occurred in this group.18 We also in-
cluded a random 10% sample of seropositive

Statistical Analysis
Additional details of the outcome measures, 
such as incidence rate ratios and prevalences, are 
provided in the final statistical analysis plan 
(available with the protocol at NEJM.org). All 
incidence rates according to intervention group 
and 95% confidence intervals were computed 
with the use of Poisson regression. The esti-
mates of the incidence rate ratios and associated 
95% confidence intervals were compared among 
the intervention groups with the use of Poisson 
regression, with the “prevention education” group 
as the reference group. The estimates were as-
sessed for potential confounding (e.g., the aver-
age age of the pigs in different intervention 
groups), but no confounding effect was found. 
The outcome measures for the villages that re-
ceived only the phase 3 intervention were com-
pared with those of villages that had received a 
previous intervention to determine any carryover 
effect. An exact 95% binomial confidence inter-
val was computed for the percentage of humans 
who were still infected after receiving treatment 
with niclosamide. Descriptive statistics, such as 
counts and prevalences, were used in the evalu-
ation of the final intervention strategy that was 
selected.
 
Results
 
Phase 1
The baseline characteristics of villages partici-
pating in the elimination program across all 
phases are summarized in Table 2. Phase 1 inter-
ventions were performed in an area that covered 
10,753 humans and 17,102 pigs. Mass screening 
and minimal mass treatment were the only 
strategies to show significant reductions in inci-
dence (as assessed by serologic testing), as com-
pared with the reference intervention of preven-
tion education, although the effects were small 
(incidence rate ratios, 0.78 [95% confidence inter-
val {CI}, 0.64 to 0.95] and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65 to 
0.97], respectively). These strategies were select-
ed for modification and further evaluation in 
phase 2. The incidence rate ratios for the other 
strategies were 0.93 for strategic treatment and 
0.96 for mass treatment (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Participation in pig replace-
ment was deemed to be insufficient to achieve 
elimination because we were able to purchase only 
326 of the 464 pigs (70%) in the pig-replacement 
group; thus, incidence among pigs (as measured 
by serologic testing) was not monitored in these 
villages.
The results from the pig-replacement group, 
however, had important implications for measur-
ing the effects of the interventions in subsequent

phases. We performed a detailed necropsy in all 
326 pigs we purchased to quantify the number of 
cysts to use as an estimate of the reservoir of in-
fection among the pigs in the villages in which 
no intervention was implemented. Findings from 
the necropsies performed on these animals 
showed that 18 of the 326 pigs (5.5%) had live, 
nondegenerated cysts (range, 1 to 2698 cysts per 
animal) (Table 3). However, the majority — 180 
of the 326 pigs (55.2%) — were seropositive for 
antibodies against cysticercosis, which suggested 
that serologic testing has poor predictive value 
for determining the size of the reservoir of infec-
tion among pigs. We tested 172 cysts from 11 
pigs, and evidence of viability (i.e., the scolex 
evaginated and moved) was shown in 125 cysts 
(72.7%) from 7 pigs (63.6%).
Phase 2
Phase 2 interventions were performed in an area 
that covered 10,380 humans and 13,488 pigs 
(Table 2). Immediately after the intervention, 658 
pigs were culled from more than 4000 pigs for 
necropsy, and eight live, nondegenerated cysts 
were found in 6 pigs (Table 3). However, only 
four of these cysts from 3 pigs were confirmed 
to be true cysticerci, and the infectious capacity 
of these cysts appeared to be compromised. The 
three cysts that appeared to be the most healthy 
were tested for viability, and none evaginated. 
Histopathological analysis of the fourth cyst re-
vealed a parasite cystic wall structure that did 
not contain a scolex. No pig with a live, nonde-
generated cyst was found in 14 of 17 villages. We 
then conducted a second round of necropsy 12 
months after the phase 2 interventions were 
completed and no further interventions had 
been implemented. We found live, nondegener-
ated cysts in 7 of 310 pigs culled from more than 
3000 pigs for necropsy; however, viability testing 
was not performed in this round of necropsy. No 
pig with a live, nondegenerated cyst was found 
in 11 of 17 villages; 5 of the 6 villages with in-
fected pigs had not received vaccine in phase 2.
Phase 3
In phase 3, the final scaled-up intervention was 
implemented in 107 villages, covering 81,170 
humans and 55,638 pigs (Table 2). Mass treat-
ment with vaccine was chosen for the final 
scaled-up intervention because there was no dif-
ference between the two strategies in phase 2

Elimination of T. solium Transmission in Northern Peru
and because mass screening was considered to 
be logistically impractical at this scale. In the 
human population, niclosamide was adminis-
tered in three rounds, with 84.7% of the entire 
population receiving at least one dose. Adverse 
reactions to niclosamide were rare; the most 
common adverse reactions were mild abdominal 
pain (0.4%), liquid stools (0.2%), and headache 
(0.1%). There were no severe adverse events asso-
ciated with niclosamide. In the pig population, 
oxfendazole was administered every 2 months, 
and two vaccination campaigns, each of which 
included two rounds of vaccination, were also 
performed. At the end of the intervention, we 
screened 3530 pigs 6 to 8 months of age by sero-
logic testing and performed necropsy on 342 
seropositive pigs, including 289 of the 433 sero-

Pig serum samples were assessed by enzyme‑linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay, which uses lentil lectin‑bound 
glycoproteins. Serologic status was based on the number of reactive bands on Western blot analysis.
†  
Necropsy samples of pig muscle or brain tissue were examined for live, nondegenerated cysts filled with clear fluid. 
Necropsy samples covered most seropositive pigs to maximize the likelihood of detecting infections. Formal viability 
testing and histopathological analysis were performed in phase 2 only.
‡  
Phase 1 necropsy was performed during a culling intervention in which the majority of pigs were removed from six geo‑
graphically isolated villages in which no chemotherapy or vaccine had been applied previously.

tive bands (9.4%) (Table 3). We found 3 pigs with 
live, nondegenerated cysts, 2 of which were 
heavily infected. These 3 pigs were not recorded 
in the rounds of intervention and may have been 
missed during the intervention or may have 
been imported into the pig population after the 
intervention. No pig with a live, nondegenerated 
cyst was found in 105 of the 107 villages.
Discussion
Taeniasis and cysticercosis due to T. solium are 
among the few diseases that are considered to 
be potentially eradicable. The results of this pro-
gram show that it is feasible to interrupt T. solium 
transmission on a regional scale, thereby pre-
venting human and porcine cysticercosis. The 
reservoir of infection in the intermediate host 
was eliminated in 105 of 107 villages through a 
1-year attack phase. Elimination persisted in 
most areas for at least 1 year without further 
intervention. However, this program was de-
signed to show the feasibility of interrupting 
parasite transmission in a defined geographic 
region, not to maintain elimination. We expect 
that the effect will be temporary if it is not bol-
stered by additional activities.
As many previous studies have shown, T. solium 
is resistant to control.5-10,12 Gains in control may 
disappear quickly if the parasite reservoir is not 
reduced beyond the point at which the parasite 
population can recover.19,20 The small or null ef-
fect of the phase 1 interventions prompted us to 
intensify subsequent approaches by shortening 
the interval between rounds of mass treatment 
and by administering the TSOL18 vaccine in 
pigs.14-16 The result of intensification was dramatic 
— the infectious larval stage reservoir almost 
completely disappeared in phase 2. The few 
cysts that were found did not appear to be ca-
pable of perpetuating the pig–human cycle. This 
critical finding allowed us to reproduce elimina-
tion in a much larger population during phase 3. 
Although we found three infected pigs at the end 
of phase 3, we were not able to determine whether 
these pigs were missed during the intervention 
or were imported after the intervention. It is also 
possible that we missed some infected pigs in 
our end-point sampling. However, the prevalence 
of pigs with viable cysts was reduced to minimal 
levels, thus decreasing the potential for further 
transmission from the pigs in most if not all 
villages. The results of the phase 3 intervention 
were similar in the villages that had received a 
previous intervention during phase 1 or phase 2 
(two pigs with cysts were found) and the new 
villages that received only the phase 3 interven-
tion (one pig with cysts was found), suggesting 
that a carryover effect in the villages that had 
received a previous intervention was not a major 
factor.
We evaluated the efficacy of our elimination 
strategies in pigs rather than in humans for mul-
tiple reasons. Although taeniasis is the immedi-
ate source of cysticercosis in pigs and humans, 
measuring changes in the prevalence or inci-
dence of taeniasis requires mass collection and 
screening of stool samples, which is impractical 
in a large-scale elimination program.21 We chose 
not to measure taeniasis as an outcome because 
of the logistic complexities and costs involved 
and the potentially detrimental effect that the 
need for stool collection could have had on the 
rate of participation among villagers. In retro-
spect, we recognize that stool collection and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 
coproantigen detection at the end of phase 3 
could have provided an additional gauge of the 
effect of the intervention. However, the attack on 
the reservoir of taeniasis was strong, with mul-
tiple rounds of chemotherapy. The phase 3 inter-
vention against taeniasis included three rounds 
of mass treatment, in which 85% of the popula-
tion received treatment at least once. Further-
more, we collected post-treatment stool samples 
in the first round of mass treatment and followed 
persons who had results that indicated that they 
had a tapeworm with the most sensitive test 
available to verify that the parasites were killed.22
Measurement of the changes in the prevalence 
or incidence of symptomatic neurocysticercosis 
among humans would provide the best indication 
of the effect of the intervention on human health, 
if it were not for the long latent period of the 
infection. In most cases, symptoms appear and 
persist years after infection.23,24 However, we ex-
pect that our intervention will result in a decrease 
in the incidence of seizures and epilepsy over the 
next 5 to 10 years, similar to that observed in 
another control program in Honduras.25 On the 
other hand, pigs provide a convenient and dy-
namic sample for measuring the effect of a con-
trol program. Approximately half the pig popu-
lation is renewed every 4 to 6 months, so new 
cohorts of unexposed pigs are introduced con-
tinuously.26 We measured the effect of our inter-

Elimination of T. solium Transmission in Northern Peru
vention using detailed necropsy of seropositive 
pigs — an expensive and labor-intensive process. 
Detailed necropsy would not be feasible for large-
scale programs, and therefore alternative mark-
ers for viable infection specific to T. solium cysti-
cercosis are needed.
Our final strategy was based on performing 
multiple rounds of mass chemotherapy; we found 
that mass screening involved considerable opera-
tional challenges with no additional benefit with 
respect to the outcome. The acceptable safety 
profile of niclosamide allowed our approach; 
safety concerns may preclude the use of prazi-
quantel as an alternate drug in areas endemic 
for T. solium.27 Unfortunately, we found that the 
efficacy of niclosamide was substantially lower 
than the 90% reported previously28; among 38 
humans with taeniasis who received niclosamide, 
14 (36.8%; 95% CI, 21.8 to 54.0) were still in-
fected 2 weeks after mass treatment in phase 1, 
as assessed by ELISA for coproantigen detection 
plus stool microscopy. The use of higher or re-
peated doses may increase efficacy but has not 
been evaluated for safety. Whether interruption 
of transmission in a population can occur in 
fewer rounds of intervention cannot be assessed 
from our data.
We also included the use of TSOL18 vaccine 
in our strategy to maintain herd immunity after 
elimination through chemotherapy. Others have 
argued that vaccination can contribute to the 
attack phase, suggesting that one round of ox-
fendazole in pigs plus sustained vaccination may 
suffice to eliminate transmission.16 The efficacy 
of TSOL18 makes this a possibility.14-16 However, 
unsolved issues with pig immunization remain. 
The current vaccine formulation requires two 
doses, which may be impractical in the field. 
Also, infections in pigs before an age at which 
they can feasibly be immunized presents chal-
lenges for vaccination,29 although the combined 
use of vaccination plus oxfendazole may address 
this issue.16
The few infected pigs that we found at the 
end of phase 3 could reflect a reintroduction of 
the parasite. Once elimination zones have been 
established, it seems reasonable to expand them 
to surrounding populations to buffer against re-
introduction. Immigration poses a constant threat 
of reintroduction, because people with taeniasis 
will migrate into disease-free areas. Infected pigs 
and pork could also be transported into disease-
free areas and could give rise to new intestinal 
tapeworms. A functioning surveillance system is 
therefore paramount for efficient detection and 
mitigation of new cases before the parasite can 
reestablish itself in a region. It would make 
sense for surveillance to be operated at the com-
munity level with oversight and tangible support 
from the regional and national governments. A 
series of nonbiologic factors may need to be 
considered to ensure the success and sustain-
ability of a control program, including commu-
nity involvement, prevention education, and on-
going surveillance. Cysticercosis is a disease of 
poverty, and the economic effect of pig cysticer-
cosis will be the most convincing argument for 
villager cooperation.
Substantial work remains for elimination pro-
grams to become a reality in endemic regions 
around the world. Controlled experiments are 
needed with respect to more-refined, less-inten-
sive, and less-expensive strategies than those 
used previously. However, the basic tools are 
available, and costs could decrease substantially 
when these tools are produced in the quantities 
required for control programs. A new formula-
tion of the TSOL18 vaccine produced in accor-
dance with Good Manufacturing Practice stan-
dards in India is being tested for efficacy in 
Peru, and oxfendazole is currently produced and 
available commercially in Africa. A field version 
of the coproantigen test is currently available, 
and a more replicable version based on monoclo-
nal antibodies is being tested. The elimination 
of T. solium requires a short-term attack phase, 
as compared with the sustained efforts over de-
cades required to control filarial or hydatid dis-
ease.30 Governments will need to ensure the 
availability of resources to expand control and 
sustain it for at least a few years. Our elimina-
tion agenda in Peru involves expanding the 
elimination area using less-expensive and sim-
pler methods, providing cost estimates for elim-
ination strategies based on these methods, and 
sharing the outcome data with the appropriate 
authorities.
