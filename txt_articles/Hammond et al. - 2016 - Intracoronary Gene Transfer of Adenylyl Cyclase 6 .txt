 Abstract
Importance—Gene transfer has rarely been tested in randomized clinical trials.
Objective—To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary delivery of adenovirus 5 
encoding adenylyl cyclase 6 (Ad5.hAC6) in heart failure.
Design, Setting, and Participants—A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 
clinical trial was conducted in US medical centers (randomization occurred from July 19, 2010, to 
October 30, 2014). Participants 18 to 80 years with symptomatic heart failure (ischemic and 
nonischemic) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less were screened; 86 individuals were 
enrolled, and 56 were randomized. Data analysis was of the intention-to-treat population. 
Participants underwent exercise testing and measurement of left ventricular EF (echocardiography) 
and then cardiac catheterization, where left ventricular pressure development (+dP/dt)and decline 
(−dP/dt) were recorded. Participants were randomized (3:1 ratio) to receive 1 of 5 doses of 
intracoronary Ad5.hAC6 or placebo. Participants underwent a second catheterization 4 weeks later 
for measurement of dP/dt. Exercise testing and EF were assessed 4 and 12 weeks after 
randomization.
Interventions—Intracoronary administration of Ad5.hAC6 (3.2 × 109 to 1012 virus particles) or 
placebo.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Primary end points included exercise duration and EF 
before and 4 and 12 weeks after randomization and peak rates of +dP/dt and −dP/dt before and 4 
weeks after randomization. Fourteen placebo participants were compared (intention to treat) with 
24 Ad5.hAC6 participants receiving the highest 2 doses (D4 + 5).
Results—Fifty-six individuals were randomized and monitored for up to 1 year. Forty-two 
participants (75%) received Ad5.hAC6 (mean [SE] age, 63 [1] years; EF, 30% [1%]), and 14 
individuals (25%) received placebo (age, 62 [1] years; EF, 30% [2%]). Exercise duration showed 
no significant group differences (4 weeks, P = .27; 12 weeks, P = .47, respectively). The D4 + 5 
participants had increased EF at 4 weeks (+6.0 [1.7] EF units; n = 21; P < .004), but not 12 weeks 
(+3.0 [2.4] EF units; n = 21; P= .16). Placebo participants showed no increase in EF at 4 weeks or 
12 weeks. Exercise duration showed no between-group differences (4-week change from baseline: 
placebo, 27 [36] seconds; D4 + 5, 44 [25] seconds; P = .27; 12-week change from baseline: 
placebo, 44 [28] seconds; D4 + 5, 58 [29 seconds, P = .47). AC6 gene transfer increased basal left 
ventricular peak −dP/dt (4-week change from baseline: placebo, +93 [51] mm Hg/s; D4 + 5, -39 
[33] mm Hg/s; placebo [n = 21]; P < .03); AC6 did not increase arrhythmias. The admission rate 
for patients with heart failure was 9.5% (4 of 42) in the AC6 group and 28.6% (4 of 14) in the 
placebo group (relative risk, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.08-1.36]; P = .10).
Conclusions and Relevance—AC6 gene transfer safely increased LV function beyond 
standard heart failure therapy, attainable with one-time administration. Larger trials are warranted.
Trial Registration—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00787059
Heart failure affects more than 28 million patients worldwide and is the only cardiovascular 
disease that is increasing in prevalence.1 Despite improvement in drug and device therapy 
for heart failure, hospitalization rates and mortality have changed little in the past decade2; 
new therapies are needed.

 Adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6), a dominant AC type in heart muscle cells, is a 130-kD 
membrane protein that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger that is an important determinant of 
heart function.3 Preclinical studies4-9 have shown benefits of increased cardiac AC6 content 
on cardiac myocytes and the heart. The amount and function of AC6 are reduced in failing 
hearts.10-12
Pronounced increases in AC6 content do not alter basal intracellular cAMP production in rat 
cardiac myocytes or in mouse hearts.4,5 Recent studies13-15 indicate that AC6 has prominent 
effects on calcium handling and consequently influences heart function independently of 
cAMP. For example, AC6 gene transfer increases sarco/endoplasmic reticulumcalcium 
adenosine triphosphatase 2a (SERCA2a) calcium uptake,13 reduces phospholamban 
expression14 and increases its phosphorylation, and increases protein kinase B (Akt) 
activation through inhibition of a protein kinase B–specific phosphatase.15 These unique 
features make AC6 gene transfer fundamentally different from other agents that increase 
intracellular cAMP (dobutamine and milrinone), but increase mortality in heart failure.16 
Increased expression of AC6 restores left ventricular (LV) function and prolongs life in a 
genetic murine model of cardiomyopathy.6,7 Expression of AC6 does not lead to unrelenting 
stimulation of the heart,5,6,8,9 and it normalizes prolonged action potential duration and 
reduces ventricular arrhythmias in cardiomyopathy.17
The extensive preclinical and clinical safety profile of intracoronary delivery of adenovirus 
vectors,8,9,18-20 the efficacy of this approach in preclinical models of heart failure, and the 
need for new therapies for heart failure compelled us to conduct the present clinical trial. 
The aim of the trial was to determine safety (heart failure hospitalizations and mortality) and 
heart function 4 and 12 weeks after intracoronary delivery of an E1/E3-deleted human 
adenovirus 5 encoding human AC6 (Ad5.hAC6) in participants with stable but symptomatic 
heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF). Our hypothesis was that a dose of 
intracoronary Ad5.hAC6 could be found that would safely increase the function of the 
failing hearts of participants with symptomatic heart failure and reduced EF.
Methods
Design
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study was conducted at 7 US 
medical centers (1 Veterans Affairs medical center, 5 academic centers, and 1 community 
hospital). Randomization occurred between July 19, 2010, and October 30, 2014. The 
objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety of one-time intracoronary injection of 
Ad5.hAC6 in participants with heart failure and to identify effective doses (if any) for 
subsequent trials. The ethics of the trial were considered and approved by the National 
Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and by the institutional review 
boards of the 7 centers (the trial protocol is available in Supplement 1). The participants 
provided written informed consent before the study procedures. No financial compensation 
was provided, although travel expenses were reimbursed. The National Institutes of Health 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board monitored the trial.

 Adenovirus 5 encoding adenylyl cyclase consists of a human replication-deficient, serotype 
5, E1/E3-deleted adeno-virus encoding human AC6, driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. 
The infectivity of Ad5.hAC6 lots used for the clinical trial was 22 virus particles per 
fluorescent focus units. The core research pharmacist at Veterans Affairs San Diego 
Healthcare System distributed the vials of the study product (Ad5.hAC6 or placebo) to the 
participating sites in Kapac bags on dry ice with temperature monitoring.
Participants
Male or nonpregnant female participants aged 18 to 80 years receiving optimal medical and 
device therapy as defined by the American Heart Association/American College of 
Cardiology guidelines21 with an LVEF of 40% or less and a history of stable symptomatic 
heart failure for more than 3 months were recruited. Participants were required to have an 
implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD) and at least 1 major coronary artery or graft with less 
than 50% proximal obstruction. Figure 1 is a flow diagram of enrollment, randomization, 
follow-up, and analysis. Details regarding enrollment are included in the eMethods in 
Supplement 2.
Procedures
Vials were labeled with the dose to enable randomization within each dose and included a 
unique number that provided a means to later identify whether the vial contained Ad5.hAC6 
or placebo. Details regarding randomization are reported in the eMethods in Supplement 2.
Participants received a single administration of intra-coronary Ad5.hAC6 at 1 of 5 ascending 
doses (D) (3.2 × 109 to 1012 virus particles) or intracoronary phosphate-buffered 3% sucrose 
(placebo) along with intracoronary nitroprusside (50 μg/min) in both groups, using a 3:1 
randomization ratio. The 5 dose groups included: D1: 3.2 × 109 virus particles (6 active, 2 
placebo participants); D2: 3.2 × 1010 virus particles (6 active, 2 placebo participants); D3: 
1010 virus particles (6 active, 2 placebo participants); D4: 3.2 × 1011 virus particles (12 
active, 4 placebo participants); and D5: 1012 virus particles (12 active, 4 placebo 
participants). This resulted in randomization of 14 individuals who received placebo and 42 
who received 1 of 5 doses of Ad5.hAC6 (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Nitroprusside was used 
to increase gene transfer efficiency. Intracoronary nitroprusside increases cardiac gene 
transfer efficiency 4-fold, presumably by increasing transvascular movement of adenovirus 
into the cardiac interstitium.18 The study product was distributed into patent coronary 
arteries or grafts in proportion to their perfused territory. All participants receiving the 
lowest dose were randomized before dose advancement (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Safety 
was assessed during sequential clinic visits and testing (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The 
National Institutes of Health Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed data after the first 
3 participants and the last participant in each dose group before approving dose 
advancement.
Before delivery of the study product in the same single procedure, right and left heart 
catheterization was performed, and pressures, cardiac output, blood pressure, and LV end-
diastolic pressure were recorded. Measurement of LV pressure development (+dP/dt) and 
decline (−dP/dt)was then conducted as described below. The study product (Ad5.hAC6 or

 placebo) was administered via an infusion catheter placed over a 0.014-inch guide wire into 
the proximal segment of each coronary artery or graft simultaneously with intracoronary 
nitro-prusside (eMethods in Supplement 2). Right heart catheterization and measurement of 
LV dP/dt were repeated 4 weeks after study product delivery.
Outcomes
Key efficacy end points included (1) LVEF (echocardiography, before and during 
dobutamine infusion), (2) LV peak +dP/dt and peak −dP/dt before and during dobutamine 
infusion, and (3) exercise capacity assessed by exercise treadmill testing. Secondary end 
points included symptoms, ICD events, and hemodynamic values obtained at catheterization.
Evaluation
Conventional 2-dimension echocardiography was performed before and 4 weeks and 12 
weeks after randomization. Images were acquired before and during graded intravenous 
infusions of dobutamine (5, 10, and 20 μg/kg/min; 5 minutes each). Perflutren (Definity, 
Lantheus Medical Imaging; or Optison, GE Healthcare) was used to optimize endocardial 
border identification. Echocardiography data analysis, performed by a single experienced 
reader (N.D.D.), was conducted at a core laboratory (Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical 
Center) to increase the consistency of the analysis. Image acquisition and analysis were 
conducted blinded to group identity.
Left ventricular +dP/dt and −dP/dt were assessed using a 5F pressure catheter (Millar) 
before study product administration and 4 weeks after randomization. Data were acquired 
before and during graded intravenous infusions of dobutamine (5, 10, and 20 μg/kg/min; 5 
minutes each) (eMethods in Supplement 2).
A modification of the modified Naughton protocol22 was used in treadmill testing, selected 
so participants could endure approximately 5 minutes of exercise. Participants completed the 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire23 before and 4 weeks and 12 weeks after 
randomization to report their symptoms.
Information on right heart catheterization is presented in the eMethods and eResults in 
Supplement 2. No group differences were seen in hemodynamic measurements.
Implanted cardiac defibrillators, which were required for enrollment, enabled interrogation 
of devices before randomization and sequentially afterward. Implanted cardiac defibrillator 
discharges, antitachycardia pacing episodes, and episodes of nonsustained ventricular 
tachycardia were evaluated.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were performed on serum samples to detect 
Ad5.hAC6 presence 1 hour, 1 week, and 2 weeks after vector delivery. Detailed methods and 
results are in eMethods and eResults in Supplement 2. Of 14 participants who had detectable 
Ad5.hAC6 DNA in serum 1 hour after the completion of vector delivery, 4 (3 in D3, 1 in 
D5) had detectable Ad5.hAC6 DNA inserum 1 week but not 2 weeks after delivery.

 We initially had excluded individuals with anti-Ad5 titers greater than 1:256, which resulted 
in unacceptably high screen failure. We eliminated this exclusion after D1. Previous 
studies19,20,24 had shown that Ad5 titers did not predictably influence the results (eMethods 
and eResults in Supplement 2).
Statistical Analysis
The protocol for this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial specified 
pairwise comparisons of the highest dose group or the highest 2 dose groups vs placebo 
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Sample sizes were calculated based on a mean estimated within-
group SD of the key efficacy measurements (EF, dP/dt, and exercise duration) of 25%, and a 
detectability threshold of 25% in any 1 of the 3 end points. A comparison between 24 
Ad5.hAC6 participants and 14 control participants, assuming a β error of 0.2 (80% power) 
and a 2-sided α error of .05 (without adjustment for multiple end points because of the 
hypothesis-generating nature of this study), would be suitable to detect a difference of 1.08 
SD units between 2 study groups. Within-group differences in the 3 key end points (before 
and after study product administration) were tested using 2-sided t tests and a 5% 
significance level. Data are presented as mean (SE).
The intention-to-treat analyses for primary and secondary end points included paired t tests 
for within-group changes (2-sided). The Fisher exact test was used to determine between-
group differences in the numbers of participants with heart failure admissions, 
transplantation, and mortality. The heart failure admission rate was assessed using a large-
sample z test for Poisson rates. The effect of the cause of heart failure on EF response was 
evaluated by 2-way, repeated-measures analysis of variance. The association between 
Ad5.hAC6 dose and change in EF from baseline was examined using a log-linear regression 
analysis. To examine the effect of prerandomization anti-Ad5 antibody titer, a covariate 
adjustment approach was used. SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for all 
analyses. Data analysis of the intention-to-treat population was conducted from May 31, 
2015, to August 20, 2015.
Results
Figure 1 is a flow diagram of the study. In the key efficacy comparison groups (placebo, 14 
participants; D4 + 5, 24), complete data were available in 91% (51 of 56) of the participants 
for EF, 93% (52 of 56) for LV dP/dt, and 79% (44 of 56) for exercise treadmill testing. 
Exercise treadmill testing was not required for randomization, which enabled enrollment of 
individuals with orthopedic limitations. Enrollment ended when 56 individuals had been 
randomized. No participants were lost to 1-year follow-up. Data for key efficacy measures in 
all dose groups and at all time points are reported in eTables 3-5 in Supplement 2.
Table 1 contains baseline characteristics of the 56 randomized participants. Mean (SE) EF 
was low (31% [1%]), and a balanced proportion of participants with New York Heart 
Association class 2 (25 [45%]) and 3 (29 [51%]) symptoms were randomized. An ischemic 
etiology for heart failure was present in 27 (48%) of the participants. There was uniformity 
between placebo and D4 + 5, the key comparison groups. Use of heart failure medication 
was similar and consistent throughout the trial.

 Figure 2A displays the effects of intracoronary administration of Ad5.hAC6 on basal LVEF. 
AC6 gene transfer in the highest 2 dose groups (D4 + 5) increased EF 4 weeks after 
intracoronary delivery (before, 29.7% [2.1%]; 4 weeks, 36.3% [2.1%]; (n = 21); mean 
increase, 6.0 [1.7] EF units; P < .004), but not at 12 weeks (before, 29.7% [2.1%]; 12 weeks, 
34.2% [2.4%]; n = 21; mean increase, 3.0 [2.4] EF units; P = .16). In contrast, participants 
who had received placebo showed no significant increase in EF at 4 weeks (before, 29.6% 
[2.4%]; 4 weeks, 33.7% [3.0%]; n = 14; mean increase, 4.1 [2.2] EF units; P = .08) or at 12 
weeks (before, 29.6% [2.4%]; 12 weeks, 31.6% [2.0%]; n = 13; mean increase, 0.8 [1.2] EF 
units; P = .31) (Figure 2A). No between-group difference was seen in mean values (D4 + 5 
vs placebo: 4 weeks, P = .59; 12 weeks, P = .42).
To ascertain whether clinical features might influence EF response, we examined D4 + 5 
participants with ischemic heart failure (n = 11), nonischemic heart failure (n = 10), and 
participants who received placebo (n = 13) (eFigure in Supplement 2). Although all 3 groups 
showed an EF increase at 4 weeks (ischemic, 4.4 [2.1] EF units; nonischemic, 6.8 [2.7] EF 
units; and placebo, 3.9 [2.2] EF units), only nonischemic participants showed a significant 
increase in EF at 12 weeks (ischemic, EF fell by 0.8 [3.0] EF units; nonischemic, EF 
increased by 8.2 [3.3] EF units; and placebo, EF increased by just 1.2 [1.1] EF units). 
Repeated-measures analysis of variance confirmed a benefit of AC6 on EF over time in 
nonischemic D4 + 5 participants compared with (1) participants with ischemic etiology (n = 
11; P = .02), (2) placebo participants (n = 13; P = .02), and (3) nonischemic placebo 
participants (n = 6; P < .02) (eFigure in Supplement 2). These exploratory comparisons will 
require confirmation in subsequent trials.
In addition, the increase in EF at 4 weeks in AC6 participants was dose related (P < .04) 
(eTable 6 in Supplement 2). At 12 weeks, doses 1 to 5 failed to show a dose-response effect 
due to a surprising effect in dose 1 (4.7 [1.6]-EF unit increase; n = 6), the consequence of 2 
participants showing 8- and 11-EF unit increases vs baseline. Both participants were Ad5 
antibody-free and both had nonischemic etiology heart failure. However, doses 2 to 5 
showed a dose-response effect at 12 weeks (P < .01) (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
Twelve weeks after randomization, mean end-systolic volumes were 35 (9.8) mL lower in 
nonischemic D4 + 5 participants (P < .08 vs placebo) (eTable 7 in Supplement 2). 
Dobutamine stimulation was not associated with within-group or between-group differences 
in EF or LV volumes.
Treadmill time was not increased in D4 + 5 participants at 4 weeks (before, 429 [42] 
seconds; 4 weeks, 487 [49] seconds; n = 17; P = .10) or in placebo participants (before, 416 
[56] seconds; 4 weeks, 446 [70] seconds; n = 13; P = .46) (Figure 2B). Treadmill time 
increased in both groups to similar degrees 12 weeks after randomization, reaching within-
group statistical significance in placebo participants (before, 416 [56] seconds; 12 weeks, 
501 [65] seconds; n = 12; P = .03) but not in D4 + 5 participants (before, 429 [42] seconds; 
12 weeks, 501 [45] seconds; n = 17; P = .06). There was no between-group difference in 
treadmill time (D4 + 5 vs placebo: 4 weeks, P = .70; 12 weeks, P = .94).

 There was a between-group difference in change in basal LV peak −dP/dt 4 weeks after 
randomization (placebo, a +93 [51]-mm Hg/s change, n = 14; D4 + 5, a -39 [33]-mm Hg/s 
change, n = 21; P < .03) (Figure 3A). Change in basal LV peak +dP/dt showed no difference 
(placebo, a 2 [44]-mm Hg/s increase; n = 14; D4 + 5, a 56 [45]-mm Hg/s increase, n = 21; P 
= .42) (Figure 3B). Dobutamine stimulation was not associated with differences in peak 
−dP/dt or in peak+dP/dt; D4 + 5 participants showed significant reduction in symptoms 12 
weeks after randomization (before, 28.8 [2.4]; 12 weeks, 20.5 [3.0]; n = 22; P = .0005) 
(Figure 3C). Placebo participants showed no reduction in symptoms at 12 weeks (before, 
30.8 [5.1]; 12 weeks, 23.0 [4.4]; n = 13; P = .16). There was no decline in symptoms in 
either group at 4 weeks and no between-group differences after study product administration 
(D4 + 5 vs placebo: 4 weeks, P = .85; 12 weeks, P = .24). In the placebo group, median New 
York Heart Association classification fell by 0.5 units (from 2.5 to 2.0) at both 4 weeks (P 
= .07) and 12 weeks (P < .02); in the D4 + 5 group the decrease was 1.0 unit (from 3.0 to 
2.0) at both 4 weeks (P < .11) and 12 weeks (P < .01).
Right atrial, pulmonary artery wedge, and LV end-diastolic pressures were elevated to 
similar degrees in the placebo and D4 + 5 participants, and there were no within-group 
differences in the 4 weeks vs baseline study (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). Cardiac indices 
were low but showed no group difference or within-group benefits of AC6 gene transfer.
No significant adverse events occurred during product administration. Transient troponin I 
elevations occurred the morning after study product administration leading to 1-day 
hospitalization in 3 participants, 1 of whom received placebo. These adverse events were not 
associated with electrocardio-graphic changes, chest pain, or elevation of creatine kinase 
MB. The troponin I levels were increased compared with baseline levels on days 2 and 4 in 
both the placebo and D4 + 5 participants, with no group differences (day 2, P = .80; day 4, P 
= .50). No increases in creatine kinase MB in D4 + 5 or placebo participants were seen at 
any point (eTable 9 in Supplement 2). Similarly, there was no evidence for hepatotoxicity in 
patients receiving D4 + 5 (eTable 10 in Supplement 2).
Serious adverse events during a mean follow-up of 361 days (range, 305-365) are reported in 
Table 2. The percentage of participants with 1 or more serious adverse events was similar 
between groups.
Heart failure admission rate was 9.5% (4 of 42) among the AC6 participants and 28.6% (4 of 
14) placebo participants (relative risk [RR], 0.33 [95% CI, 0.08-1.36]; P = .10). There were 
2 deaths, 1 in each group: (AC6, 2%; placebo, 7%; RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.01-11.10]; P = .40). 
One death in a placebo participant was associated with progressive heart failure; the other, 
which occurred 3 months after administration of Ad5.hAC6 (D5), was in a participant with 
ischemic etiology heart failure who experienced myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. 
There were 2 transplantations, both in AC6 participants (P > .99 vs placebo). The overall

change inD4 + 5 participants was not significant: P = .78 (at 4 weeks) and P = .22 (at 12 
weeks).
Discussion
The most important findings of this initial clinical study are that intracoronary delivery of 
Ad5.hAC6 in patients with heart failure appears to be safe and that AC6 gene transfer 
provides a dose-related beneficial effect on cardiac function. We identified doses that merit 
additional study in subsequent larger trials.
Participants with nonischemic heart failure who received D4 + 5 had larger and persistent 
increases in EF vs D4 + 5 participants with ischemic etiology heart failure (P = .02), vs all 
placebo (P = .02), and vs placebo with ischemic heart failure (P < .02) (eFigure in 
Supplement 2). These data suggest that targeting Ad5.hAC6 to participants with 
nonischemic etiology heart failure would have the most benefit.
The 8.2 (3.3)–EF unit increase at 12 weeks in D4 + 5 participants with nonischemic heart 
failure (eFigure in Supplement 2), the dose-response relationship of Ad5.hAC6, and the 
absolute and relative increases in EF among D5 participants (4 weeks: 7.7 [2.7] EF units, a 
26.5% relative increase in basal EF; 12 weeks: 4.2 [3.3] EF units, a 14.4% relative increase 
in basal EF) (eTable 6 in Supplement 2) indicate an important biological effect of AC6 gene 
transfer on LV function. The LV end-systolic volume index was 35 mL lower 12 weeks after 
randomization in D4 + 5 participants with nonischemic heart failure (P < .08 vs placebo) 
(eTable 7 in Supplement 2). Why would individuals with nonischemic heart failure have a 
superior response? Perhaps reduced viable myocardium in those with ischemic heart failure 
impedes the response to AC6 gene transfer. Alternatively, because ischemia affects 
endothelial function, its presence may impede transvascular movement of the vector into the 
cardiac interstitium and thereby may curtail gene transfer. The dose-response data (eTable 6 
in Supplement 2) also indicate that the effect on LV function had not reached a plateau; 
higher doses may have provided increased response.
Left ventricular peak -dP/dt, a key end point of the study, was increased by AC6 gene 
transfer (P < .03) (Figure 3A). The peak rate of LV pressure decline is linked to LV 
relaxation and is abnormal in heart failure with reduced EF. This effect on LV relaxation also 
suggests that AC6 gene transfer may be effective to treat heart failure with preserved EF, a 
prevalent entity for which no therapy has been found to reduce mortality.25 One of the key 
mechanisms of AC6's action is enhanced calcium handling,13-15 which can benefit both 
diastolic and systolic function. The AC6-related increase in EF, seen particularly in 
nonischemic heart failure (eFigure in Supplement 2) indicates improved systolic function.
Preclinical data consistently showed an AC6-related increase in basal and stimulated rates of 
LV pressure development and decay,5,6,8,9 which served as a rationale for evaluating LV 
dP/dt in the present study. Although we found significant between-group differences in basal 
LV peak −dP/dt (P < .03) (Figure 3A), no between-group differences in basal LV +dP/dt 
were seen (Figure 3B). The dP/dt data were collected 4 weeks after randomization. Many

 participants showed maximal EF improvement at 12 weeks rather than 4 weeks (eFigure in 
Supplement 2), which may have reduced the likelihood of seeing an increase in LV +dP/dtat 
4 weeks. The absence of do-but amine-stimulated group differences in peak +dP/dt and peak 
−dP/dt may reflect increased variability in these data.
A placebo effect on treadmill time, as we saw in the present study, is seen commonly in 
cardiovascular gene transfer trials.18,19 Previous studies have failed to show a benefit on 
exercise duration in heart failure participants after treatment with ACE inhibitors26 or long-
acting β-blockers27 despite their benefits on mortality and heart failure hospitalization rates.
The absence of treatment differences in hemodynamic parameters (eTable 8 in Supplement 
2) likely reflects the stability of participants in the trial. Symptoms of heart failure decreased 
in both groups (Figure 3C). However, the reduction in symptoms at 12 weeks was significant 
only in D4 + 5 participants (P = .0005), although no between-group difference (D4 + 5 vs 
placebo) was seen.
Similar increases in troponin I were seen in both groups the day after study product delivery 
(placebo, 6.4-fold increase; D4 + 5, 6.7-fold increase) (eTable 9 in Supplement 2). By day 4, 
levels had decreased (placebo, a 3.7-fold increase; D4 + 5: a 5.6-fold increase); by week 2, 
values were back to baseline. Electrocardiographic abnormalities or a clinical picture 
suggesting acute coronary syndrome were absent. The disappearance of elevation and the 
absence of elevation in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase (eTable 10 in 
Supplement 2) make clinically important adeno-virus-associated inflammation unlikely.
Although the 1-year mortality rate was decreased in participants who received AC6 gene 
transfer (AC6, 2%; placebo, 7%; RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.01-11.10]; P = .40), the numbers of 
events (1 per group) were too low to draw a conclusion. The heart failure admission rate 
(Table 2) was 9.5% in the 42 AC6 participants but 28.6% in the placebo group (RR, 0.33 
[95% CI, 0.08-1.36]; P = .10).
Implanted cardiac defibrillators were a requirement for enrollment because of the possibility 
that AC6 could increase cAMP and thereby provoke cardiac arrhythmias, as was seen in a 
milrinone trial.16 However, AC6 gene transfer was not associated with increased rates of 
ICD events, which were uncommon in both groups. Furthermore, there was no increase in 
episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (eTable 11 in Supplement 2).
To date, adenovirus has been the most commonly used vector in clinical gene transfer,28 but 
a bias against its use persists. We initially selected adenovirus rather than adeno-associated 
virus, because AC6's large size in combination with the cytomegalovirus promoter made its 
expression in adeno-associated virus difficult. Two potential limitations of recombinant 
adenovirus vectors are inflammation and transient expression, which often are linked. 
However, cardiac and hepatic inflammation were not seen in the present study, as reflected 
by normal troponin I and liver enzyme levels in the weeks following vector delivery. These 
findings are consistent with those in 450 participants who received intracoronary 
Ad5.hFGF4 in the Angiogenic Gene Therapy (AGENT) trials,19,20 albeit at lower maximal 
doses (the AGENT maximal dose was 3.3 × 1010 virus particles vs 1012 virus particles in the 
present trial).

 Adenovirus, like adeno-associated virus, directs extra-chromosomal transgene expression, so 
only one daughter cell continues to express transgene after cell division. However, our target 
cell, the cardiac myocyte, does not divide or does so rarely; therefore, transgene expression 
is not diluted in the heart. As a consequence of targeting nondividing cells and the absence 
of inflammation, AC6 function persisted at similar increased levels 2 to 18 weeks after 
intracoronary delivery in pigs.8 Intracoronary Ad5.hAC6 provides LV AC6transgene 
expression in pigs that persists with no reduction between day 28 and day 70 (IND 13751 
for the present study).
Virus vectors previously have been used in cardiovascular diseases, including adenovirus 
encoding human fibroblast growth factor 4 in participants with angina (AGENT3),20 which 
failed to show a treatment effect in the overall patient population in a phase 2b/3 trial, and 
adeno-associated virus type 1 encoding human SERCA2a (AAV1.SERCA2a) in participants 
with heart failure and reduced EF.29 The phase 2b clinical trial of AAV1.SERCa2a failed to 
meet any primary or secondary end points.30
The current trial has some limitations. This was necessarily a small trial of a new gene 
therapy, and it was consequently not sufficiently powered to draw definitive conclusions 
regarding heart failure hospitalization rate or mortality. Although we monitored participants 
for 1 year for mortality and heart failure hospitalization rates–crucial elements in such a 
trial–additional efficacy end points (EF, dP/dt, and exercise treadmill testing duration) were 
examined only 4 and 12 weeks after randomization. The primary goals were to determine 
the safety of intracoronary administration of Ad5.hAC6 and to identify doses to test in 
subsequent larger clinical trials. Intracoronary Ad5.hAC6 appears to be safe even at doses of 
1012 virus particles. Further testing will be required to confirm the safety and efficacy of IC 
Ad5.hAC6.
Conclusions
Intracoronary delivery of Ad5.hAC6 appears to be safe in patients with heart failure and 
reduced EF. Heart failure admission rate was 9.5% in participants who received AC6 and 
28.6% in those who received placebo (P = .10). The rates of serious adverse events were 
similar in both groups, and ICD events were not increased. Despite limited sample size, 2 
end points showed significant between-group differences: (1) AC6 gene transfer increased 
LV peak −dP/dt (P < .03); and (2) AC6 gene transfer increased EF in participants with 
nonischemic heart failure (P = .02). AC6 gene transfer safely increased LV function beyond 
optimal heart failure therapy through a single administration. Larger trials are warranted to 
assess the safety and efficacy of AC6 gene transfer for patients with heart failure.

 Key Points
Question
Can intracoronary delivery of adenovirus 5 encoding adenylyl cyclase 6 (Ad5.hAC6) 
safely increase function of the failing heart?
Findings
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that included 56 
participants with symptomatic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, 
intracoronary delivery of Ad5.hAC6 was not associated with increased adverse events 
and significantly increased left ventricular function.
Meaning
Larger trials are warranted to assess the safety and efficacy of AC6 gene transfer for 
patients with heart failure.
