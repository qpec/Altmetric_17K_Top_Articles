Abstract
Objectives—Although cocaine use has been linked to sexual HIV risk behavior for decades, the 
direct effects of cocaine on sexual desire and sexual decision-making are unexamined. Research 
suggests delay discounting (devaluation of future outcomes) and probability discounting 
(devaluation of uncertain outcomes) play roles in condom use decisions. This study examined the 
effect of cocaine administration on sexual desire, hypothetical condom use, and discounting tasks.
Methods—This double-blind, within-subjects study compared the effects of 0, 125 and 250 
mg/70 kg oral cocaine HCl in 12 cocaine users. Measures included sexual desire and other 
subjective ratings, the Sexual Delay Discounting Task, the Sexual Probability Discounting Task, 
and monetary delay and probability discounting tasks.
Results—Cocaine caused dose-related increases in sexual desire and prototypical stimulant 
abuse-liability ratings. Relative to placebo, cocaine did not significantly alter condom use 
likelihood when condoms were immediately available or when sex was associated with 100% 
certainty of sexually transmitted infection (STI). In contrast, cocaine dose-dependently 
strengthened the effect of delay (sexual delay discounting) and STI uncertainty (sexual probability 
discounting) in decreasing condom use likelihood. Cocaine caused no significant change in 
monetary delay and probability discounting.
Conclusion—This is the first study showing that cocaine administration increases sexual desire. 
Detrimental effects of cocaine on sexual risk were only observed when safer sex required delay, or 
STI risk was uncertain (representative of many real-world scenarios), suggesting a critical role of 
discounting processes. Lack of monetary effects highlights the importance of studying clinically-
relevant outcomes when examining drug effects on behavioral processes.

 Introduction
Cocaine users show substantially higher HIV prevalence (4–22%) (Booth et al. 1993; Booth 
et al. 2000; McCoy et al. 2004; Strathdee and Sherman 2003) than the national average 
(~0.5%) (Hall et al. 2015). Sexual risk behavior contributes substantially to these high rates 
(e.g., Booth et al. 1993; Bux et al. 1995; Edlin et al. 1994; Edwards et al. 2006; Grella et al. 
1995; Hoffman et al. 2000; Joe and Simpson 1995). Efforts to reduce sexual risk behavior 
among drug users have largely aimed to improve HIV prevention knowledge and condom 
use skills (e.g., Heil et al. 2005; Herrmann et al. 2013; Malow et al. 1994; Winhusen et al. 
2014). Although these efforts have improved knowledge and skills, changes in risk behavior 
have been modest (Prendergast et al. 2001; Semaan et al. 2002), suggesting that sexual risk 
decisions likely depend on behavioral processes aside from risk-reduction knowledge or 
skills (Johnson and Bruner 2012).
Delay discounting is a behavioral process whereby delaying an event reduces its value. 
Studies typically measure delay discounting by examining choices between smaller-
immediate vs. larger-later money rewards. However, recent evidence shows stronger 
relations between delay discounting and clinical problems when the discounting task 
assesses clinically relevant outcomes rather than money (Johnson and Bruner 2012; Lawyer 
and Schoepflin 2013; Rasmussen et al. 2010; Schiff et al. 2015). The Sexual Delay 
Discounting Task examines the effect of delay discounting on episode-level sexual risk 
behaviors (Johnson and Bruner 2012). Participants select photographs of hypothetical 
potential sexual partners, and then rate their likelihood of choosing to have immediate 
unprotected sex vs. waiting a specified delay (at a range of different delays) to have condom-
protected sex. Studies have shown that sexual delay discounting (i.e., the reduction in 
condom use likelihood as a function of delay) is: greater when responding for more 
desirable partners (Dariotis and Johnson 2015; Herrmann et al. 2014; Herrmann et al. 2015; 
Johnson and Bruner 2012; Johnson and Bruner 2013); more strongly related to self-reported 
sexual risk behavior relative to money discounting (Johnson and Bruner 2012); associated 
with greater self-reported drug use and risky sexual partners in adolescents/young adults 
(Dariotis and Johnson 2015); reliable over time (Johnson and Bruner 2013); greater for men 
than women (Johnson and Bruner 2013); greater in opioid-dependent women than control 
women (Herrmann et al. 2014); associated with drug use and unprotected sex among men 
who have sex with men (Herrmann et al. 2015); increased by acute alcohol administration 
(Johnson et al. 2016); and greater in those with Cocaine Use Disorder than demographically 
matched controls (Johnson et al. 2015a).
Collectively, the data support the notion that delay discounting may contribute to sexual risk 
behavior among a variety of populations, including cocaine users. However, questions 
remain about the relation between cocaine use and increased discounting. At least three non-
mutually-exclusive hypotheses may describe this relation. First, other variables (e.g., 
genetics, behavioral history) may independently predispose a person to both cocaine use and 
increased delay discounting. Second, a history of chronic cocaine use may cause increased 
discounting. Third, cocaine intoxication may acutely increase delay discounting. Increased 
delay discounting among cocaine users in cross-sectional human studies not involving drug 
administration (e.g., Heil et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2015a) is consistent with any of the 
Johnson et al.

 above hypotheses. The observation with rats that delay discounting under non-drug 
conditions predicts subsequent cocaine self-administration lends support to the first 
hypothesis, but does not refute the second or third hypothesis (Perry et al., 2008; 2005). The 
well-replicated finding from nonhuman animal research that a chronic cocaine 
administration history increases delay discounting (Dandy and Gatch 2009; Koffarnus and 
Woods 2013; Logue et al. 1992; Mendez et al. 2010; Roesch et al. 2007; Setlow et al. 2009; 
Simon et al. 2007) lends support to the second hypothesis. Given that cocaine users report 
increased risk behavior while acutely intoxicated on cocaine (e.g., Colfax et al. 2004; 
Rendina et al. 2015), the present study aimed to test the third hypothesis (i.e., causal effect 
of acute cocaine intoxication on sexual risk behavior).
This randomized, double-blind, within-subject study administered 0, 125, or 250 mg/70 kg 
oral cocaine HCl in each of three separate sessions to non-treatment seeking cocaine users 
who met DSM-IV criteria for cocaine abuse or dependence. We specifically recruited 
participants who met abuse or dependence criteria in order to examine a clinically-relevant 
population. Cocaine doses were selected based on previous research showing robust and 
dose-related subjective effects (Smith et al. 2001). Participants completed the Sexual Delay 
Discounting Task and a money delay discounting task to determine whether potential 
cocaine effects on discounting were general, or specific to certain commodities. We also 
assessed probability discounting of both sexual and monetary outcomes. Using a similar 
framework as delay discounting tasks, probability discounting tasks determine how 
uncertainty influences an event’s value, typically by assessing choices between smaller-
certain vs. larger-uncertain monetary rewards (Bickel et al. 2014; Rachlin et al. 1991). The 
Sexual Probability Discounting Task was developed to determine the effect of sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) contraction probability on condom use likelihood (Johnson et al. 
2015a). In that study, greater odds against STI contraction were associated with substantial 
decreases in condom use likelihood. The present study also examined the effect of cocaine 
administration on the delay discounting of cocaine itself (see Johnson et al. 2015b). 
Moreover, despite decades of research linking cocaine use to sexual risk behavior, the 
present study is the first to experimentally examine effects of cocaine administration on 
sexual desire (Volkow et al. 2007). The study was well-positioned, therefore, to determine 
which processes may underlie risky sex decisions, and whether those processes are similarly 
affected across outcome type.
Methods
Ethics Statement
Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board approved the study, performed in 
accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed 
consent.
Participants
Healthy cocaine users were recruited from the Baltimore, MD area via newspaper, radio, 
internet, and word-of mouth. Eligibility was assessed by an initial telephone screening, 
followed by an in-person interview and medical examination. Inclusion criteria were: 18–45

 years of age; literate; meet DSM-IV criteria for current cocaine abuse or dependence; using 
cocaine within the past month; using cocaine for at least one year; and having unprotected 
and condom-protected sexual intercourse at least once each within the lifetime (this was 
required because hypotheses regarding condom use vs. non-use are best tested in individuals 
who have had experience with both options). Exclusion criteria were: History of severe 
psychiatric disorder; daily use of any psychiatric medications by prescription; current 
physical dependence on any drug except cocaine, caffeine, or nicotine; interest in treatment 
for substance use; pregnancy (confirmed by urinalysis), hypertension, breastfeeding, or not 
using an effective means of contraception (females only). A range of other criteria excluded 
those with susceptibility or history of cardiovascular illness or other serious medical 
disorders. Aside from formal criteria, one applicant was excluded for legal issues requiring 
random drug testing. Another was excluded because of a current opiate prescription and a 
history of injection heroin use. Participants received $280 for completing the study, 
including a $160 completion bonus, with the opportunity to earn additional compensation 
(maximum ~$28) based on performance in tasks not reported here. Participants could also 
receive a $100 bonus for referring someone who completed the study.
Screening Session Assessments
Assessments administered at the screening visit are shown in Table 1. We collected detailed 
data about drug use (e.g., DSM-IV drug abuse and dependence checklists based on Hudziak 
et al., 1993), sexual HIV risk behaviors (Behavioral Risk Assessment for Infectious Diseases 
[BRAID], Dunn et al., In Press; HIV Risk-taking Behavior Scale, Darke et al. 1991), verbal 
intelligence (Quick Test; Ammons and Ammons 1962), and ADHD symptoms (Adult 
ADHD Self-Report Scale; Kessler et al. 2005). In order to familiarize participants with study 
measures before potential drug effects would be experienced in subsequent laboratory 
sessions, participants were required to practice completing the subjective drug effects 
questionnaire, the Sexual Delay Discounting Task (described below), and the Sexual 
Probability Discounting Task (described below).
Laboratory Procedures
Study protocol—At least 24 hours before each drug administration session, participants 
were called and reminded to abstain from drugs and alcohol for at least 24 hours and to 
abstain from eating or drinking for at least 12 hours before arriving the next day. Participants 
arrived at 7:30 a.m. for each session and provided a breath alcohol sample and a urine 
sample to test for drugs of abuse. Sessions were rescheduled if breath samples showed non-
zero alcohol levels. Participants ate a low-fat breakfast consisting of two pieces of toast, two 
packets of jelly, and 355 ml of either apple or grape juice, which was finished by 8:00 a.m. 
to allow two hours before drug administration at 10:00 a.m. Participants could smoke 
cigarettes at the beginning of the session, but finished their last cigarette at least 30 min 
before drug administration. This ensured that participants who were smokers had completed 
all discounting tasks within ~2 hours of smoking to minimize the potential effects of 
nicotine withdrawal on study outcome measures. Moreover, previous human research 
suggests no interaction between nicotine maintenance vs. abstinence on cocaine subjective 
effects (Sobel et al., 2004).

 Before drug administration, participants completed computerized practice examples using 
visual analog scales (VAS) like those used for the sexual discounting tasks. Briefly, seven 
scenarios were presented describing different levels of food deprivation and corresponding 
likelihood of eating dinner tonight (0, 5, 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%). For each of these 
scenarios, participants were required to complete a VAS while specifying the described 
likelihood. If a participant did not specify the stated likelihood on the VAS, additional 
instruction was provided and the practice trial was repeated until the correct response was 
provided. At the first session, to ensure understanding, participants took a brief quiz on the 
content of the instructions for the monetary delay discounting task after they were read aloud 
by research staff. Incorrect answers prompted further instruction.
Drug Administration—During three drug administration sessions, participants orally 
ingested, with water, a size 00 opaque capsule containing either 0 (placebo), 125, or 250 
mg/70 kg of cocaine HCl. Across sessions the capsules appeared identical and were each 
filled completely with a combination of cellulose and/or cocaine HCl. Drug administration 
was double-blind. Administration order was randomized across participants.
Laboratory Assessments
Table 1 shows the timing and order of all drug administration session assessments.
Physiological Measures—During the session, heart rate and blood pressure were 
measured using a Criticare 507S Non-Invasive Patient Monitor. Medical staff was contacted 
immediately if participant blood pressure exceeded 200/130 mmHg or if their submaximal 
heart rate (220-[age in years × 0.85]) was exceeded. Participants were permitted to leave the 
laboratory after study sessions were completed if cardiovascular discharge criteria were met 
(systolic blood pressure ≤ 150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, heart rate ≤ 
100 BPM). Sessions lasted approximately 4.5 hours (approximately 7:30 AM to 12:00 PM).
Subjective Drug Effects—Similar to previous studies (Johnson et al. 2010; Johnson and 
Griffiths 2013), during sessions, participants responded to 12 items measuring subjective 
drug effects on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all, 1=Possibly mild, but not sure, 2=Definitely 
mild, 3=Moderately, 4=Strongly). We also examined ratings of sexual desire, using a VAS 
ranging 0 to 100, where 0=None and 100=Intense.
Discounting Tasks
Sexual Delay Discounting—During screening, participants viewed 60 photographs of 
clothed men (30) and women (30) and selected the photographs of individuals they would 
choose to have sex with in a casual sex scenario. Among the selected photographs, 
participants chose the person they judged as least likely to have an STI. Although it was 
never implemented, women who chose a female partner were excluded, given the low rate of 
sexual HIV transmission between females (Chan et al. 2014). One participant was 
disqualified because she did not select at least one photo from the set. Two participants were 
excluded because while practicing the task during screening they indicated 100% condom 
use likelihood at all delays or probabilities of STI contraction; see below for task details). 
This was because the aim of the study was to examine factors contributing to risk behavior

 among individuals who engage in risk behavior. Individuals who endorse condom use in all 
scenarios are therefore not relevant to the experimental hypotheses.
During drug administration sessions, participants were shown the photograph of their 
selected partner and asked to read a modified (to remove mention of alcohol) vignette about 
a hypothetical sexual encounter with their selected partner (George et al. 2009). After 
reading the vignette, and immediately before completing the sexual delay discounting task, 
participants rated their level of sexual desire “right now” on a VAS ranging from 0 (none) to 
100 (intense). This pre-task assessment of sexual desire was used for examining correlations 
with the Sexual Delay Discounting Task, and is distinct from the sexual desire ratings (as 
one of the 12 subjective effects) assessed throughout the time course. Participants were 
asked to rate their likelihood of using a condom in the vignette scenario if a condom were 
immediately available. Using a VAS similar to the practice scales described above, 
participants specified an integer percent ranging from 0 (“I will definitely have sex with this 
person right away without a condom”) to 100 (“I will definitely have sex with this person 
with a condom”). Next, participants rated their likelihood of using a condom in the same 
scenario with the exception that a condom was not immediately available, and the 100% 
value in the range represented “I will definitely wait [delay] to have sex with this person 
with a condom.” Seven delays were examined in separate scales: 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 
min, 1 hr, 3 hr, and 6 hr. These delays are shorter than those in previous studies (Johnson & 
Bruner 2012, 2013; Johnson et al. 2015a; Herrmann et al. 2014, 2015; Johnson et al. 2016) 
in an effort to assess discounting of condom-protected sex at delays to condom availability 
more relevant in real-world sexual situations.
Sexual Probability Discounting—Using a framework similar to the Sexual Delay 
Discounting Task, participants rated the likelihood of condom use given a particular 
probability of contracting an STI (Johnson et al. 2015a). This task included its own pre-task 
assessment of sexual desire, as in the Sexual Delay Discounting Task. The 8 probabilities 
assessed were 1 in 1 (100%), 1 in 3 (33%), 1 in 13 (8%), 1 in 100 (1%), 1 in 400 (0.25%), 1 
in 700 (0.14%), 1 in 2,000 (0.05%), and 1 in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of contracting an STI. 
Risk was presented as probability of contracting an STI using two numbers (e.g., 1 in 3) 
rather than a percentage (e.g., 33%).
Monetary Delay Discounting—In this task participants chose between receiving a 
smaller amount of money immediately and $100 after a specified delay. At each of seven 
delays, examined in ascending order, the magnitude of smaller immediate money was 
adjusted across trials until an indifference point was detected, using an algorithm as 
previously described (Baker et al. 2003; Heil et al. 2006; Johnson and Bickel 2002). After 
determining the indifference point, the task moved to the next delay or concluded after the 
last delay. The seven delays were: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 
years.
Monetary Probability Discounting—Participants chose between receiving a smaller, 
certain amount of money and a probability of receiving $100. At each of seven probabilities, 
examined in descending order, the magnitude of the smaller certain money was adjusted 
across trials until a point of subjective equivalence was detected by algorithm as previously 
Johnson et al.

 described (Yi et al. 2005). After determining the indifference point, the task moved to the 
next probability or concluded after the last probability. The seven probabilities were: 99%, 
90%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, and 1% chance.
Cocaine Delay Discounting—Similar to a previous task (Johnson et al. 2015b), 
participants chose between receiving fewer units of cocaine (crack rocks or powder vials 
worth $5 street value each) immediately and receiving 20 units of cocaine after a delay. 
Delays examined were: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 years.
Cocaine Craving Questionnaire—Participants completed a VAS version of the brief 
Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ-Brief; Sussner et al. 2006). Participants rated each of 
10 items from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (1). The CCQ-Brief is reliable, valid, 
and superior to single-item VAS measures of cocaine craving (Sussner et al. 2006). Higher 
sum scores indicate greater craving.
Data Analysis
The monetary and cocaine discounting tasks provided an indifference point (subjective 
value) for each delay or probability expressed as a proportion of the larger delayed/
probabilistic reward. For the sexual tasks, the percentage scale value provided by the 
participant for each delay/probability was transformed to proportion (divided by 100). For 
each discounting task we applied a previously published criterion that flagged cases in 
which at least one delay (or odds-against) had a proportion value that was greater than the 
next lower delay (or odd-against) value by a magnitude of .2 (Johnson and Bickel 2008). 
This was done in order to characterize data orderliness, but no data were excluded from 
analyses. For each task the percentage of functions (for each participant within each dose 
condition) with systematic data (zero flagged values) was determined. For all discounting 
tasks, area-under-the-curve (AUC) was computed for each participant using proportion 
values at each delay or probability per Myerson et al. (2001) to provide an aggregate 
measure of discounting. In order to isolate the effect of delay on choices between 
unprotected vs. condom-protected sex in the sexual tasks, proportion values were 
standardized (i.e., divided by that participant’s value in the 0-delay condition) before AUC 
calculation. Probability was converted to odds-against for AUC calculation in the probability 
discounting tasks. Using AUC values for the discounting tasks, repeated measures ANOVA 
with planned comparisons (i.e., simple effects contrasts based on the F statistic) was used to 
examine the effects of cocaine dose on all study outcome measures. Pearson correlations 
examined relations between sexual desire ratings and AUC values from the sexual 
discounting tasks. Pearson correlations also examined the relation between CCQ-Brief 
scores and cocaine delay discounting AUC. For all pair-wise comparisons between dose 
conditions, effect size was calculated as Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1988) accounting for within-
subjects correlations (Morris and DeShon, 2002). Analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism (version 6) and SPSS (version 23). For all analyses α was set at .05.

Participant Characteristics
Of the 15 participants who qualified for drug administration, 12 participants completed the 
three drug administration sessions. Table 2 displays basic demographic information of study 
completers, including sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, tobacco smoking status, age, 
education, monthly income, cocaine use per month, reported instances of unprotected sex, 
and scores on the HIV Risk-taking Behavior Scale and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale.
Subjective Drug Effects and Physiological Effects
Table 3 summarizes mean peak subjective effects. In general, within-subjects contrasts 
revealed significantly higher peak ratings in both cocaine sessions relative to placebo, 
including peak ratings of sexual desire. Peak subjective effects ratings were also generally 
higher during 250 mg/70 kg sessions relative to 125 mg/70 kg sessions, including peak 
ratings of sexual desire. A timeline of subjective ratings of “any drug effect” and “sexual 
desire” as a function of cocaine dose is displayed in Figure 1. Table 4 summarizes mean 
peak physiological measures. Peak values for all measures were significantly higher in both 
cocaine sessions relative to placebo, and also significantly higher in 250 mg/70 kg sessions 
relative to 125 mg/70 kg sessions (with the exception of mean arterial pressure).
Discounting Task Orderliness
Discounting data were largely systematic across drug conditions; 89%, 97%, 100%, 97%, 
100% of functions were systematic for the Sexual Delay Discounting Task, the Sexual 
Probability Discounting Task, the Monetary Delay Discounting Task, the Monetary 
Probability Discounting task, and the Cocaine Delay Discounting Task, respectively.
Sexual Delay Discounting Task
Sexual desire—Planned contrasts indicated significantly greater pre-task sexual desire in 
250 mg/70 kg sessions vs. placebo sessions (means of 0.56 vs. 0.22, respectively, 
F(1,11)=10.67, p<0.01, Cohen’s d=01.08), and in 250 mg/70 kg sessions vs. 125 mg/70 kg 
sessions (means 0.56 vs. 0.41, respectively, F(1,11)=9.21,p=0.01, Cohen’s d=0.96). Sexual 
desire ratings in 125 mg/70 kg sessions tended be higher than placebo sessions, and these 
differences trended toward significance (means of 0.41 vs. 0.22, respectively, F(1,11)=4.74, 
p=0.05, Cohen’s d=0.65).
Condom use with no delay—Planned contrasts revealed that participants did not report 
significantly lower likelihoods of using an immediately available condom during 250 mg/70 
kg sessions relative to placebo (Means of .80 vs. .82, respectively, F(1,11)=.05, p=.83, 
Cohen’s d=0.06), during 125 mg/70 kg sessions relative to placebo (Means of .87 vs. .82, 
respectively, F(1,11)=.22, p = .65, Cohen’s d=0.14), or during 250 mg/70 kg sessions 
relative to 125 mg/70 kg sessions (Means of .80 vs. .87, respectively, F(1,11)=.54, p = .48, 
Cohen’s d=0.22).

 Planned contrasts showed significantly greater AUC (i.e., less discounting) in placebo 
sessions relative to 250 mg/70 kg sessions (Means of 0.55 vs. 0.38, respectively, 
F(1,11)=6.16, p=0.03, Cohen’s d=0.72). Although AUC was greatest in the placebo 
condition, intermediate in the 125 mg/70 kg condition, and least in the 250 mg/70 kg 
condition as hypothesized, the differences between placebo sessions and 125 mg/70 kg 
sessions did not reach significance (Means of 0.55 vs. 0.48, respectively, F(1,11)=2.00, 
p=0.19, Cohen’s d=0.37), and the difference between the 125 mg/70 kg sessions relative to 
250 mg/70 kg sessions did not reach significance (Means of 0.48 vs. 0.38, respectively, 
F(1,11)=1.49, p=0.25, Cohen’s d=0.37). AUC was not significantly correlated with pre-task 
sexual desire ratings in any session (r value range: −.47 to .24 all p values > 0.12).
Sexual Probability Discounting Task
Sexual desire—Planned contrasts indicated significantly greater pre-task sexual desire in 
250 mg/70 kg sessions vs. placebo sessions (means of 59.75 vs. 13.42, respectively, 
F(1,11)=25.67, p <0.001, Cohen’s d=1.57), 125mg/70kg vs. placebo sessions (means of 
44.16 vs. 13.42, respectively, F(1,11)=14.94, p=.002, Cohen’s d=1.20), and in 250 mg/70 kg 
sessions vs. 125 mg/70 kg sessions (means 59.75 vs. 44.16, respectively, 
F(1,11)=7.19,p=0.02, Cohen’s d=0.77).
Condom use with a 100% chance of STI contraction—Planned contrasts showed 
that participants did not report significantly lower likelihoods of using a condom given a 
100% chance of STI contraction during 125 mg/70 kg sessions relative to placebo (Means 
of .94 vs. .98 proportion visual analog scale, F(1,11)=.73, p=.41, Cohen’s d=0.32), during 
250 mg/70 kg sessions relative to placebo sessions (Means of .94 vs. .98, F(1,11)=.41, p=.
54, Cohen’s d=0.23), or during 250 mg/70 kg sessions relative to 125 mg/70 kg sessions 
(Means of .94 vs. .94, F(1,11)=.00, p = .99, Cohen’s d=0.01).
Probability discounting of condom-protected sex—The lower panels of Figure 2 
show mean standardized likelihood values as a function of STI risk and cocaine dose. 
Planned contrasts indicated significantly greater AUC in placebo sessions relative to 250 
mg/70 kg sessions (means of 0.66 vs. 0.39, respectively, F(1,11)=9.32, p=0.01, Cohen’s 
d=0.88), and significantly greater AUC in placebo sessions relative to 125 mg/70 kg sessions 
(Means of 0.66 vs. 0.45, respectively, F(1,11)=7.92, p=0.02, Cohen’s d=0.83). AUC was 
greater in 125 mg/70 kg relative to 250 mg/70 kg sessions, although this was not significant 
(Means of 0.45 vs. 0.39, respectively, F(1,11)=1.06, p=0.33, Cohen’s d=0.30). AUC was not 
significantly correlated with pre-task sexual desire ratings in any session (r value range: −.17 
to −.06; all p values > 0.60).
Money Delay Discounting Task
The upper panels of Figure 3 show monetary delay discounting results. Planned contrasts 
revealed no significant differences in AUC between placebo, 125 mg/70 kg, and 250 mg/70 
kg sessions (Means of 0.32, 0.30, and 0.30, respectively, all p values > 0.37, Cohen’s d 
range: 0.01–0.16).

 Money Probability Discounting Task
The middle panels of Figure 3 show monetary probability discounting results. Planned 
contrasts indicated no significant differences in AUC between placebo, 125 mg/70 kg, and 
250 mg/70 kg sessions (Means of 0.17, 0.20, and 0.16, respectively, all p values >0.28, 
Cohen’s d range: 0.19–0.52).
Cocaine Craving Questionnaire
Planned contrasts indicated significantly greater craving according to CCQ-Brief scores in 
250 mg/70 kg sessions relative to placebo (means of 0.52 vs. 0.20, respectively, 
F(1,11)=29.25, p<0.01, Cohen’s d=2.17), and significantly greater craving in 125 mg/70 kg 
sessions relative to placebo (means of 0.52 vs. 0.20, respectively, F(1,11)=53.83, p<0.01, 
Cohen’s d=1.65). There were no significant differences in craving between 125 mg/70 kg 
and 250 mg/70 kg sessions (means of 0.52 for both doses, F=0.01, p=0.95, Cohen’s d=0.02).
Cocaine Delay Discounting Task
Data for one participant was missing due to experimenter error. The lower panels of Figure 3 
show the discounting of delayed cocaine (using choices between immediate and delayed 
cocaine rewards). Planned contrasts showed AUC to be greatest in the placebo condition, 
intermediate in the 125 mg/70 kg condition, and least in the 250 mg/70 kg condition as 
hypothesized. However, these differences did not reach significance (Means of 0.26, 0.24, 
and 0.18, respectively, all p values > 0.13, Cohen’s d range: 0.19–0.51). AUC in the cocaine 
delay discounting task was significantly and negatively correlated with scores on the CCQ-
Brief for the placebo session (r=−0.62, p=0.04), indicating that higher cocaine craving was 
associated with steeper discounting of cocaine. Discounting of cocaine and CCQ-Brief 
scores were not significantly correlated for the 125 mg/70 kg (r=−0.05, p=0.89) or 250 
mg/70 kg sessions (r=0.06, p=0.85).
Discussion
This is the first experimental laboratory study with results suggesting that cocaine 
administration may play a causal role in condom use decisions. Moreover, it is the first 
laboratory study identifying potential behavioral mechanisms by which cocaine acutely sets 
the occasion for sexual risk behavior, i.e., sexual desire, delay discounting, and probability 
discounting. The major results of this study are that: 1) Cocaine administration caused dose-
dependent increases in sexual desire and in sexual delay and probability discounting; 2) In 
contrast to sexual tasks, cocaine administration caused no significant increases in delay and 
probability discounting of money, and delay discounting of cocaine; 3) Cocaine 
administration caused dose-dependent increases in ratings of cocaine craving; 4) Cocaine 
administration caused dose-dependent increases in prototypical stimulant and abuse-
liability-related subjective effects. Each result will be discussed, followed by study 
limitations and overall conclusions.
Despite decades of research linking cocaine use and sexual risk behavior (e.g., Booth et al. 
1993), the present study is the first to show that cocaine administration causes significant 
and orderly dose-related and time-related increases in sexual desire ratings under double-

 blind laboratory conditions. This is also the first study to show that cocaine administration 
causes significant decreases in reported condom use likelihood under some conditions. A 
previous study found that intravenous but not oral administration of methylphenidate 
(pharmacologically similar to cocaine) significantly increased sexual desire ratings (Volkow 
et al. 2007). No attempt was reported to calibrate the two different doses used for 
intravenous and oral routes, so it is unknown if differential effects were due to route or dose. 
The present results showing that cocaine increases sexual desire may have profound 
implications for the connection between cocaine and sexual risk behavior that should be 
examined in future research.
Cocaine administration did not significantly decrease reported condom use likelihood under 
ideal circumstances of immediate condom availability. Rather, cocaine administration 
decreased reported condom use likelihood specifically when condom-protected sex was 
delayed (typical of naturalistic casual sex scenarios). Moreover, cocaine administration did 
not significantly decrease reported condom use likelihood under circumstances in which 
contracting an STI from one’s partner was certain. Rather, cocaine administration decreased 
reported likelihood of condom use specifically when the risk of STI contraction was 
uncertain. These data indicate that cocaine administration exacerbates the already 
detrimental effects of delay or STI contraction improbability on reported condom use 
likelihood. Had we only assessed condom use likelihood in the absence of delay or when 
STI contraction was certain, our conclusion would have been that cocaine administration 
does not affect condom use likelihood. This highlights not only the importance of 
considering delay and probability discounting processes in real-life risk scenarios, but also 
the possibility that other environmental parameters (e.g., financial cost of condoms; 
likelihood of erection failure when applying condom) might also play critical roles in 
condom use decisions. Perhaps the most important implication of these findings is that 
condom availability is critical during cocaine use in order to prevent risk behavior and STI 
transmission.
Given that cocaine administration increased sexual desire and decreased condom use 
likelihood as measured by the sexual discounting tasks, we examined relations between 
sexual desire and AUC in the sexual discounting tasks, reasoning that greater sexual desire 
might shift preference toward immediate unprotected sex. Although the lack of significant 
relation between sexual desire ratings and AUC does not support a mediating role of sexual 
desire in the link between cocaine administration and decreased condom use likelihood, this 
may be due to a relatively small sample size, as 100 or more participants are generally 
considered appropriate for mediation analyses with reliable measures (Hoyle and Kenny 
1999). Future research with larger sample sizes may further examine a potential mediating 
role of sexual desire.
In contrast to the effects of cocaine administration on sexual delay and probability 
discounting, cocaine administration had no significant effect on monetary delay or 
probability discounting. This same general pattern was evident in our recent research 
examining the acute effects of alcohol (Johnson et al. 2016). Specifically, alcohol 
administration significantly increased delay and probability discounting of condom-
protected sex (i.e., decreased condom use under conditions involving delay or STI

 contraction uncertainty), but had no effect on delay discounting of money and caused small 
but significant decreases in probability discounting of money. Aside from this commonality 
regarding acute effects, a growing literature has shown other examples of domain-dependent 
effects in delay discounting (Dariotis and Johnson 2015; Johnson and Bruner 2012; Lawyer 
and Schoepflin 2013; Rasmussen et al. 2010; Schiff et al. 2015). As an example, research 
suggests that sexual delay discounting, compared to monetary delay discounting, is more 
strongly related to self-reported sexual risk behavior (Johnson and Bruner 2012). One 
hypothesis might be that cocaine acutely increases the delay discounting of biologically 
relevant outcomes but not money. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the lack of 
significant effect of cocaine administration on cocaine delay discounting.
Cocaine administration significantly increased ratings of cocaine craving, consistent with 
previous results (e.g., Haberny et al. 1995; Jaffe et al. 1989; Nann-Vernotica et al. 2001), and 
is consistent with binge use patterns common with cocaine (O’Brien 2011). That is, 
increases in cocaine craving are consistent with the notion that cocaine effects may set the 
occasion for additional cocaine administration, constituting a positive feedback loop. We 
examined relations between cocaine craving and cocaine discounting, reasoning that greater 
cocaine craving might shift preference toward immediate cocaine even if the amount is 
small. In the placebo session, higher cocaine craving was associated with steeper 
discounting of cocaine. However, this relation was not significant in the two active dose 
conditions, leaving the relation between cocaine craving and cocaine discounting 
ambiguous.
The study showed cocaine to cause significant dose-related increases in abuse-liability 
subjective effects such as “high” and “good effects”, and in other subjective effects typical of 
cocaine (e.g., “stimulated”) (e.g. Smith et al. 2001). The study also replicated increases in 
heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Our replication of these prototypical cocaine 
effects supports the present study’s ability to detect multiple known drug effects, and 
therefore the study’s likely ability to detect novel effects (e.g. discounting tasks). Moreover, 
the percentage of systematic discounting functions compares favorably to previous studies 
(e.g., Johnson 2012; Johnson and Bruner 2012; Johnson et al. 2015a), providing confidence 
in discounting results.
Several limitations should be noted. First, the discounting tasks used hypothetical rather than 
real consequences. Although the results suggest that acute cocaine administration decreases 
likelihood of delayed condom use in casual sex scenarios, sexual risk behavior was not 
directly assessed. However, studies have generally shown real and hypothetical monetary 
outcomes to result in similar discounting functions (Baker et al. 2003; Bickel et al. 2009; 
Green and Lawyer 2014; Johnson and Bickel 2002; Johnson et al. 2007; Lagorio et al. 2005; 
Lawyer et al. 2011; Madden et al. 2003; Madden et al. 2004; Matusiewicz et al. 2013). 
Moreover, the Sexual Delay Discounting Task has shown reliability and significant 
correlations with self-reported sexual risk behavior (Dariotis and Johnson 2015; Herrmann 
et al. 2015; Johnson and Bruner 2012). These correlations suggest that sexual delay 
discounting may contribute to sexual risk behavior (although it should be noted that the 
aforementioned validity and reliability research was conducted using different delays in the 
Sexual Delay Discounting Task). Another limitation is that cocaine is typically not used by 
Johnson et al.

 the oral route. However, the oral route maximized the credibility of the blind relative to 
intranasal or smoked route, and has been successfully used in laboratory research, showing 
qualitatively similarity to intravenous cocaine (Smith et al. 2001). Our participants were 
predominantly young, Caucasian/white, intranasal cocaine users who met diagnostic criteria 
for cocaine use disorders. Although it was not an inclusion requirement, every single 
participant anecdotally reported having unprotected sex specifically because they did not 
have a condom immediately available at multiple times in the lifetime, demonstrating 
clinical relevance. Nonetheless, cocaine effects might differ for other groups such as those 
who consistently use condoms or those who may be better characterized as recreational 
users (i.e., do not meet cocaine use disorder criteria). Another limitation is that the various 
discounting tasks were assessed at fixed times post-administration. Therefore, differences 
across the time course of drug effects may account for why sexual but not money tasks were 
affected by cocaine administration. However, the fact that money probability discounting 
was assessed near peak subjective effects and yet showed no cocaine effect is not consistent 
with this interpretation. Another potential limitation is that different delays and probabilities 
were used across the money and sexual versions of discounting tasks. Although orderly data 
showing evidence of discounting was obtained with all tasks, it remains possible that the 
different delays and probabilities may have accounted for differences in results. A final 
limitation is that the credibility of the blind for oral cocaine administration was not formally 
assessed, although we judge the possibility of blinding via non-pharmacological effects 
(e.g., taste) to be low given that cocaine or placebo was administered by capsule.
Overall, this study has provided the most comprehensive examination to-date of the potential 
behavioral mechanisms linking cocaine use to sexual risk behavior. Cocaine administration 
may create ideal conditions for occasioning risk behavior by acutely increasing three 
(perhaps interactive) behavioral processes: sexual desire, sexual delay discounting 
(detrimental effect of delay on condom use), and sexual probability discounting (detrimental 
effect of STI improbability on condom use). Future research should determine possible 
interactions among these potential mechanisms. Moreover, STI prevention efforts, including 
harm-reduction efforts for cocaine users, should take these processes into account as 
potential contributors to cocaine-related sexual risk behavior.

Note. DSM-IV checklists based on Hudziak et al. (1993) were used to assess drug abuse and dependence. The Behavioral Risk Assessment for 
Infectious Diseases (BRAID; Dunn et al., In Press) assessed sexual risk behaviors. The HIV Risk Taking Behavior Scale assessed injection drug 
use and sexual HIV risk behaviors (Darke et al., 1991). The Quick Test assessed verbal intelligence (Ammons and Ammons, 1962). The Adult 
ADHD Self-Report Scale assessed ADHD symptoms (Kessler et al. 2005). See text for discounting task details.

1One participant identified as Hispanic. The two participants who identified as more than one race both identified as Caucasian/white and African 
American/Black.
2Score on the Adult ADHD Self Report Scale can range from 0–36 for each of the two subscales, with higher scores indicating greater ADHD 
symptoms.
3Score on the HIV Risk-taking Behavior Scale can range from 0–30 on the Drug Use subscale and from 0–25 on the Sexual Behavior subscale, 
with higher scores indicating greater risk behavior.
4One participant was excluded from the calculations of lifetime instances of unprotected sex because his response was provided as a percentage 
rather than a count (i.e., 80% of the time).

Note. With the exception of sexual desire, participants rated items on a scale ranging from 0–4 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Possibly mild, but not sure, 2 = 
Definitely mild, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Strongly). Sexual desire was rated using a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 100 (“None” and “Intense,” 
respectively). Peak subjective effects were calculated using the maximum value observed over the time course for each participant. Peak subjective 
effects were compared using repeated measures ANOVA with a within subjects factor of dose (three levels), and simple effects (based on the F 
statistic) contrasts comparing each dose.
Ratings at 125 and 250 mg/70 kg that are significantly different from placebo are indicated with
