Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat, resulting in an
urgent unmet need for a rapid, non–sputum-based quantitative
test to detect active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections
in clinically diverse populations and quickly assess Mtb treatment
responses for emerging drug-resistant strains. We have identified
Mtb-specific peptide fragments and developed a method to rap-
idly quantify their serum concentrations, using antibody-labeled
and energy-focusing porous discoidal silicon nanoparticles (nano-
disks) and high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) to enhance
sensitivity and specificity. NanoDisk-MS diagnosed active Mtb
cases with high sensitivity and specificity in a case-control study
with cohorts reflecting the complexity of clinical practice. Similar
robust sensitivities were obtained for cases of culture-positive pul-
monary TB (PTB; 91.3%) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB; 92.3%),
and the sensitivities obtained for culture-negative PTB (82.4%)
and EPTB (75.0%) in HIV-positive patients significantly outper-
formed those reported for other available assays. NanoDisk-MS
also exhibited high specificity (87.1–100%) in both healthy and
high-risk groups. Absolute quantification of serum Mtb antigen
concentration was informative in assessing responses to antimy-
cobacterial treatment. Thus, a NanoDisk-MS assay approach could
significantly improve the diagnosis and management of active TB
cases, and perhaps other infectious diseases as well.

espite international efforts and initiatives, tuberculosis (TB)
remains a major public health concern worldwide, associ-
ated with high morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Detecting active
TB cases and monitoring their responses to therapy are fraught
with challenges, relying predominantly on microbiologic tech-
niques that use sputum samples, including acid-fast Bacillus
(AFB) smear microscopy—widely used as an initial test for TB
diagnosis (3, 4)—and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) culture,
both of which have only moderate sensitivity and specificity and
a long turnaround time (5, 6). Moreover, sputum samples are
difficult to obtain after symptom improvement, and often are not
diagnostically useful for extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases. The
PCR-based Xpert MTB/RIF sputum assay was introduced to
improve the speed and specificity of TB diagnosis, but this assay
has poor sensitivity under low bacterial loads and cannot distin-
guish live and nonviable Mtb contributions (7, 8). A recent World
Health Organization (WHO) policy update acknowledged the low
quality of evidence supporting the use of Xpert MTB/RIF to di-
agnose EPTB (9). Diagnostic challenges can be further magnified
in patients coinfected with HIV and TB (10). In addition, none of
these techniques provides quantitative results that can be used to
monitor treatment effects (11, 12).
Consequently, there is an urgent need, highlighted as a high
priority in a recent WHO consensus report (13), for the devel-
opment of rapid, quantitative, non–sputum-based biomarker
tests that do not require bacterial isolation to detect active TB
(13). Non–sputum-based IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs), which
measure ex vivo immune responses to Mtb antigens, have re-
ceived negative policy recommendations for active TB diagnosis
owing to their inability to distinguish active TB and latent TB
infection (LTBI), as well as their poor diagnostic performance in
HIV/TB-coinfected patients and EPTB patients (14). One recent
report used the expression of a set of host innate immune re-
sponse genes in blood to diagnose pulmonary TB (PTB) cases,
but that retrospective study did not examine blood samples of
EPTB patients, and could not identify culture-negative TB cases
(15). Detection of Mtb antigens in patient blood samples can
provide direct evidence of TB, but no currently available method
has demonstrated adequate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity,
Significance
Active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections represent a
significant global health threat, but can be difficult to diagnose
and manage owing to the nonquantitative nature and rela-
tively poor performance of current frontline sputum-based di-
agnostic assays, which can be further degraded by certain Mtb
manifestations. This study describes the development of a
rapid and quantitative blood-based assay with high sensitivity
and specificity for active Mtb infections that can be used to
monitor responses to antimycobacterial therapy. Our method
combines antibody-labeled, energy-focusing nanodisks with
high-throughput mass spectrometry to enhance the detection
of Mtb-specific peptides in digested serum samples, and
should allow rapid clinical translation. This approach also
should be applicable to other infectious diseases, particu-
larly those for which conventional immunoassays exhibit
suboptimal performance.

 likely owing to the epitope-masking effects of host proteins (16)
and homology with related antigens of several nontuberculous
mycobacteria (NTM) (17, 18).
Here we report a blood-based assay for rapid, specific, and high-
sensitivity quantification of active TB infections in patients, which
uses antibody-conjugated nanodisks to enrich Mtb-specific peptides
of 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) and 6-kDa early secre-
tory antigenic target (ESAT-6) from trypsin-digested serum samples.
These factors demonstrate homology with those expressed by other
Mycobacterium species, but have tryptic peptides that exhibit strong
Mtb selectivity. Thus, Mtb-derived CFP-10 and ESAT-6 serum
concentrations appear likely to be strong predictors of active TB
disease, because they are actively secreted by virulent mycobacterial
strains, can be detected early after Mtb infection, and have activities
that attenuate mycobacterial clearance (19), implying that their
presence in serum can be used to diagnose active Mtb infections.
We have incorporated several advances to allow the diagnosis of
TB from patient blood samples: identification of Mtb-selective CFP-
10 and ESAT-6 peptides, and development of antibody-conjugated
nanodisks that dramatically increase both target peptide enrichment
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) of bound
peptides to enhance detection by high-throughput MALDI time-of-
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Furthermore, trypsin
digestion is thought to disrupt protein complexes to release Mtb
antigens that might be undetectable in conventional immunoassays
targeting intact Mtb proteins. The NanoDisk-MS method (Fig. 1)
permits rapid quantification of serum markers specific for active
TB, overcoming obstacles associated with current methodologies,
and uses accepted clinical instrumentation to enhance its potential
for clinical translation.
We evaluated the diagnostic performance of NanoDisk-MS in
HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients drawn from the Houston
Tuberculosis Initiative (HTI), a large, population-based TB
surveillance study. Results from case-control groups in these
populations and longitudinal samples from patients undergoing
anti-TB therapy provide strong proof-of-principle evidence sup-
porting the clinical utility of this detection platform.
Results
Sensitive Nanoparticle-Mediated Detection of Mtb-Specific Serum
Peptides. Serum CFP-10 and ESAT-6 expression theoretically
can be used to diagnose all active Mtb infections, including EPTB
cases (20); however, some NTM strains express homologs that
may reduce the utility of these proteins as biomarkers (21). Since
peptide sequence is the gold standard for protein discrimination,
we examined whether tryptic peptides could distinguish Mtb-
derived ESAT-6 and CFP-10 from homologs produced by other
species. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of recombinant protein tryptic
digests detected CFP-10 (TDAATLAQEAGNFER; m/z 1,593.75)
and ESAT-6 (WDATATELNNALQNLAR; m/z 1,900.95) pep-
tides with high signal-to-noise ratios that were subsequently con-
firmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and
which showed strong Mtb specificity when aligned with homologs
from 12 NTM species (17, 18) (SI Appendix, Figs. S1–S3). Both
peptides demonstrated perfect homology with Mycobacterium bovis,
a relatively rare form of TB, but diverged markedly from two species
responsible for the majority of NTM infections, Mycobacterium
avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare (22), as well as most other
NTM species. The ESAT-6 peptide showed little homology to any
NTM, whereas the CFP-10 peptide demonstrated homology only
to some strains of Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium mar-
inum, and Mycobacterim ulcerans that were not expected to sig-
nificantly interfere with diagnostic specificity in clinical use.
The wide dynamic range of serum protein expression can com-
plicate the cleavage and subsequent detection of low-abundance
serum proteins (23). We found that supplemental microwave irra-
diation allowed serum CFP-10 and ESAT-6 digestion within 20 min
instead of overnight, as is normally required for complex protein
samples (24), reducing the “sample-to-answer” time to 4 h while
increasing the MS signal for target peptides by more than threefold
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
We next analyzed several potential nanoparticle enrichment
platforms for their ability to act as MALDI comatrixes that en-
hance the MS signal by increasing peptide desorption/ionization.
MALDI-TOF MS analysis of recombinant CFP-10 and ESAT-6
performed with different nanoparticles showed that gold and
silica nanoparticles robustly increased the MS signal, whereas
graphene and silver and silicon nanoparticles had negligible to
negative effects (Fig. 2A). Unlike gold particles, silica particles
can be readily modified to precisely control their porosity and
thus their surface area and absorbance properties. Thus, we
developed a scalable process to rapidly fabricate uniform nano-
disks with the surface oxidized to silica to permit antibody
functionalization and an absorption spectrum spanning the
wavelength of the MALDI-TOF MS UV laser (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5). Electron microscopy images of these nanodisks revealed
highly reproducible 1,000 × 400-nm discs with 40-nm pores
coated with a thin silica layer (Fig. 2 B–D and SI Appendix, Fig.
S6). Nanodisks demonstrated the strongest comatrix effect of all
tested materials (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S7), likely owing
to their UV absorbance properties and thermal confinement
effect to promote laser-induced peptide desorption/ionization
and their large surface-to-volume ratio, which would be expected
to trap peptides in close proximity to the comatrix (25).
We next epoxy-modified and conjugated nanodisks with anti-
bodies specific to the 1,593.75 and 1,900.95 m/z peptides (SI
Appendix, Fig. S8) to create a high-affinity, high-capacity peptide
enrichment platform. Systematic analysis of MS signal enhance-
ment by microwave digestion, nanodisk enrichment, and comatrix
properties was performed with antigen-spiked healthy human
serum, which was split and subjected to overnight or microwave-
assisted trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of
nonimmunoprecipitated serum (no IP), peptides eluted from
target-specific Dynabeads (Dynabead IP) or nanodisks (nanodisk IP),
and peptides still bound to target-specific nanodisks (NanoDisk-MS)
(Fig. 2E). Mtb target peptides were essentially undetectable in di-
gests without IP, detected only weakly in microwave-assisted digests
with conventional IP, but robustly detected when nanodisks were
used for peptide enrichment or as an enrichment/comatrix platform.

 The mean Mtb peptide signal was increased by 2.5-fold for CFP-10
and 2.6-fold for ESAT-6 by microwave-assisted digestion, by an
additional 6.6-fold for both CFP-10 and ESAT-6 by nanodisk-
mediated enrichment, and then by an additional 9.9-fold for
CFP-10 and 10.2-fold for ESAT-6 by nanodisk comatrix activity.
Quantification of Mtb-Specific Peptides in Human Serum. TB-free
human serum spiked with recombinant CFP-10 and ESAT-6
standards was digested under microwave irradiation, spiked with
stable isotope-labeled internal standards, and analyzed by
NanoDisk-MS. Calibration curves for antigen quantitation were
generated by plotting the MS spectra intensity ratio between
target peptides and internal standards against their respective
input recombinant protein concentrations. Excellent correlation
(R2 >0.98) was observed for curves made with different nanodisk
batches (Fig. 2F), with values exhibiting 14–22% within-run and
16–23% between-run coefficients of variation. CFP-10 showed a
50 pM limit of detection (LOD) and a 200 pM limit of quanti-
fication (LOQ), ESAT-6 had a 200 pM LOD and a 500 pM
LOQ, and measurement accuracies ranged from ∼74% (1 nM)
to ∼90% (20 nM) (SI Appendix, Table S1). NanoDisk-MS also
readily distinguished patients with TB and patients without TB
in a proof-or-principle multiplex assay (Fig. 2G). Conversely,
analyses performed using an advanced MALDI-TOF/TOF MS
instrument failed to directly detect our target peptides in serially
diluted serum of a TB patient with high CFP-10 (18 nM) and
ESAT-6 (14 nM) levels, owing to the MALDI-inhibitory effects
of serum sodium and lipids when no IP was performed and only
weakly detected target signals after conventional IP with peptide-
specific Dynabeads, which were lost after 2× serum dilution (Fig.
2H). In contrast, the NanoDisk-MS assays robustly detected both
peptides in 2× serially diluted aliquots down to 32× dilution,
demonstrating sufficient LOD in patients with low biomarker
levels (Fig. 2H).
NanoDisk-MS Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity in an HIV-Negative
Population. We assessed the diagnostic performance of NanoDisk-
MS with serum of HIV-negative HTI patients, using a posi-
tive signal of either peptide as the TB diagnostic criterion.
Cutoff values of CFP-10 concentration (200 pM) and ESAT-6
concentration (650 pM) were established before study initiation
based on the maximum Youden index value in a development
cohort including 25 active TB cases and 25 non-TB controls (SI
Appendix, Fig. S9). Our case-control study contained 27 culture-
positive PTB cases, 31 LTBI cases, 32 NTM cases, and 21 healthy
controls. Blinded NanoDisk-MS assays detected target peptides
in 25 of 27 (92.6%) TB cases (Table 1 and Fig. 3A), with 100%
sensitivity in smear-positive cases and 91.0% sensitivity in smear-
negative cases. No target signal was detected in the healthy con-
trols, but false-positive signals were found in 4 of 31 LTBI cases
(at risk) and in 3 of 32 NTM cases (disease control), for speci-
ficities of 87.1% and 90.6%, respectively. Notably, the LTBI signal
may reveal subclinical TB cases, whereas NTM false-positive re-
sults may result from strains of three NTM species (M. kansasii,
M. marinum, and M. ulcerans) that account for <5% of NTM cases
(22), because the CFP-10 sequence of these two strains matches
that of our target peptide (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). LTBI follow-up
and NTM strain analyses are needed to address these questions.
However, M. kansasii cases were heavily overrepresented in our
NTM group (13 of 32), and two of the three NTM false-positive
cases had M. kansasii infection.
NanoDisk-MS Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity in an HIV-Positive
Population. Noninvasive diagnosis of EPTB is challenging owing
to the paucibacillary nature of patient sputum samples, and thus
Mtb cultures are often done using more invasive specimens, in-
cluding lymph nodes and pleural or cerebrospinal fluid. EPTB is
particularly common in HIV/TB-coinfected patients, and HIV
infection can disrupt pulmonary granulomas, which may reduce
the utility of sputum-based diagnostic tests, whereas the altered
immune responses in these patients may limit the utility of
T-cell–mediated diagnostic assays (26).
We analyzed serum samples from HIV-positive HTI subjects
with culture-positive or -negative PTB or EPTB. Blinded analyses
identified 91.3% (21 of 23) and 82.4% (14 of 17) of the culture-
positive and -negative PTB cases, respectively, and 92.3% (12 of
13) and 75.0% (6 of 8) of the culture-positive and -negative EPTB
cases, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3B), while exhibiting 89.7%
specificity (26 of 29) with TB-negative/HIV-positive subjects.
NanoDisk-MS thus dramatically outperformed Mtb culture-based

 diagnosis of PTB (57.5%; 23 of 40) and EPTB (61.9%; 13 of 21)
cases, and exhibited 100% and 84.3% sensitivity for smear-positive
and -negative cases, respectively. These sensitivities also exceed
those found in a study analyzing Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivities for
culture-positive PTB cases (86.2%; 50 of 58) and culture-positive
(67.7%; 21 of 31) and -negative (29.4%; 5 of 17) EPTB cases in a
HIV-positive population (27).
Serum CFP-10 and ESAT-6 Levels in HIV-Infected Patients. HIV/TB-
coinfected patients represent a demographically important TB
population, because HIV-infected individuals are 20 times more
likely to develop active TB disease (28, 29). Circulating Mtb
antigen levels might be increased in these patients, however, as
has been observed for other bacterial antigens (30). Indeed,
combined CFP-10 + ESAT-6 levels were significantly higher in
HIV-positive patients compared with HIV-negative patients with
culture-positive PTB (9.8 nM vs. 3.3 nM) (Fig. 3C). NanoDisk-MS
results are thus expected to permit robust TB diagnosis in HIV-
positive patients with sensitivity exceeding that of most conven-
tional methods (31).

Receiving Anti-TB Therapy. Serum Mtb antigen concentrations
during anti-TB therapy may reflect therapeutic efficacy. We
analyzed serial blood samples from 9 HIV-negative and 12 HIV-
positive TB patients during and after 6–12 mo of anti-TB therapy
and follow-up. Serum Mtb peptide levels were decreased or un-
detectable in most HIV-negative (8 of 9) and HIV-positive (11 of
12) TB patients posttherapy (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10A).
The lone nonresponsive HIV-negative patient (ID no. 20020493)
was found to have received an incomplete anti-TB regimen
(11 of 20 monthly doses) owing to alcohol-induced liver dys-
function and to have exhibited consistent culture-positive results
on a review of health records. One HIV-positive patient (ID no.
20020282) had a CFP-10 decrease that rebounded 2 mo after
completion of therapy, perhaps owing to a lack of leukocyte
bactericidal activity associated with G6PD deficiency or a decrease
in the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes (32). All of the other
HIV-positive patients achieved Mtb antigen clearance during
treatment or showed continued decreases posttreatment and
ultimately had undetectable antigen levels.
We also collected samples from two prospectively enrolled
patients with active TB before and shortly after the start of anti-TB
therapy. Both patients exhibited significant Mtb antigen decreases
by 9 d of treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S10B), and were symptom-
and culture-negative after 1 mo of treatment. Studies with larger
longitudinal cohorts are underway to assess how early changes in
antigen level correspond to symptom changes and treatment
outcomes.
Discussion
Sustained and effective TB control is not exclusive to “third-world”
countries—a lack of effective vaccines, emergence of drug-resistant
TB strains, underperforming diagnostic strategies and slow culture-
based therapy evaluation continue to cost millions of lives world-
wide. The NanoDisk-MS assay described herein addresses sensi-
tivity and speed issues associated with active TB diagnosis, and
meets several criteria for a WHO-mandated noninvasive TB assay,
because it (i) uses a small, noninvasive specimen; (ii) does not re-
quire bacterial isolation; (iii) has high sensitivity and specificity for
active TB cases in extrapulmonary, culture-negative, and HIV-
infected TB patients, for whom diagnosis often requires multiple
tests, including invasive procedures; (iv) directly quantifies Mtb
antigens for rapid monitoring of anti-TB therapy effects; (v) uses a
streamlined process amenable to high-throughput operation in both
clinical and research settings; and (vi) can be performed using
equipment already approved by the Food and Drug Administration
for other diagnostic assays.

Liu et al.
 We selected CFP-10 and ESAT-6 as biomarkers because they
are known to modulate several key immunologic pathways to
reduce mycobacterial clearance and promote host cell lysis,
which may enhance Mtb dissemination. Thus, they may be more
relevant than other abundant Mtb proteins, like antigen 85b,
which is expressed by virulent and attenuated Mtb complex
mycobacteria, including M. bovis bacillus Calmette–Guérin, to
affect proliferation and perhaps uptake. Both CFP-10 and
ESAT-6 are expressed by the RD-1 locus found in virulent but
not attenuated Mtb complex strains, and RD-1 transfer into
M. bovis bacillus Calmette–Guérin has been shown to increase
virulence and survival (19). CFP-10 and ESAT-6 also appear to
play important roles in the maintenance of Mtb infection by
inhibiting mycobacterial clearance (33).
NanoDisk-MS demonstrated similar sensitivity for both PTB
cases (87.5%) and clinically challenging EPTB cases (85.7%) in
the HIV-positive study population, where it equaled or signifi-
cantly outperformed Xpert MTB/RIF in terms of sensitivity for
detecting EPTB using highly invasive lymph node (84%), pleural
fluid (17%), and cerebrospinal fluid (56%) samples in a meta-
analysis (34), and significantly outperformed AFB smear (31%),
mycobacteria growth indicator tube culture (69%), and Xpert
MTB/RIF (66%) in another study (35). Moreover, our results
were achieved irrespective of Mtb culture status, and although
greater sensitivity was achieved in culture-positive samples, re-
sults from culture-negative samples markedly outperformed the
WHO-defined 66% optimal sensitivity for new high-priority
nonsputum diagnostic tests (13). NanoDisk-MS also accurately
diagnosed active TB cases in patients with HIV coinfection, which
can adversely skew the results of blood-based host response im-
munoassays (e.g., IGRA and T-cell activation marker–tuberculosis
assay) (26, 36), in which serum Mtb peptide concentrations were
found to equal or exceed those found in HIV-negative subjects,
supporting robust assay sensitivity. NanoDisk-MS exhibited dif-
ferential specificities with healthy (100%) and HIV-positive
(89.7%) controls, LTBI cases (87.1%), and NTM cases (90.6%),
however. Owing to the increased TB risk in LTBI and HIV-positive
groups and possible strain-specific NTM false-positives, longitudinal
studies of LTBI and HIV-positive populations and strain identifi-
cation of NTM cases are needed to further refine the specificity of
the test in these groups.
NanoDisk-MS also was able to precisely quantify serum anti-
gen concentrations, a highly desirable feature for monitoring
responses to anti-TB therapy, given that assays currently used to
monitor treatment response provide only qualitative or semi-
quantitative results (smear and culture) or exhibit significant
latency (Xpert). A study evaluating serial sputum samples from
patients with smear-positive TB found that assay positivity and
grade decreased linearly starting at ∼2 wk (smear), 4 wk (cul-
ture), or 6 wk (Xpert) posttreatment (37). CD4+ T-cell responses
also have been reported to differentiate LTBI and active TB cases
and to monitor treatment responses, although only HIV-negative
and culture- and/or smear-positive PTB patients were analyzed
using this labor-intensive method, so that its clinical utility remains
unclear (38). Circulating miRNA levels also may serve as TB bio-
markers, but this idea has not yet been tested in longitudinal clinical
studies (39). Results from proof-of-principle NanoDisk-MS studies
analyzing Mtb peptide responses during anti-TB therapy detected
marked reductions in both HIV-positive and -negative TB cases
on initiation of anti-TB therapy, but these studies were not designed
to measure rates of decline or for comparisons with other methods.
Future prospective longitudinal studies with frequent sampling are
needed to determine how Mtb peptide clearance corresponds to
patient phenotypes and treatment outcomes. Should such a study
confirm our preliminary results, the NanoDisk-MS assay would
be expected improve the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of con-
ventional procedures, which require months to estimate therapeutic
efficacy or identify treatment resistance.
NanoDisk-MS was designed to enable multiplex detection of
serum Mtb antigen concentrations for robust detection of active
TB cases. Serum CFP-10 was detectable at lower concentrations
than ESAT-6, perhaps owing to variable expression levels of
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in different strains of Mtb (40, 41). How-
ever, host β2 microglobulin also has been reported to bind
ESAT-6 to mask a tryptic cleavage site (amino acids 90–95) required
for the 1,900.95 m/z ESAT-6 peptide (16, 42), and thus may inhibit
ESAT-6 cleavage to decrease the apparent serum ESAT-6 levels in
our assay.
Nanodisk-MS requires only a simple, low-volume blood draw
rather than invasive biopsies that may be required for other
methods. Many hospitals and microbiology laboratories routinely
use MALDI-TOF MS for microbial identification (43), which
could allow rapid clinical translation of a NanoDisk-MS diagnostic
assay. Further reductions in operator time and assay cost, along
with improvements in instrument portability, are needed to meet
WHO guidelines for an optimal noninvasive TB assay. Larger,
randomized prospective studies are warranted to confirm the re-
sults of this proof-of-principle pilot study, but a clinical method
that shares the advantages of our approach should facilitate earlier
interventions and better patient outcomes (44). The NanoDisk-MS
assay also opens up new possibilities for the diagnosis of a wide
variety of other infectious diseases, because it should be relatively
simple to generate similar assays to rapidly quantify disease-associated
low-abundance antigens in blood and other body fluids.
Materials and Methods
Clinical Samples. The HTI cohort that served as a source of case and control
samples in this study were the subjects of a large, population-based TB
surveillance study that performed active surveillance of all confirmed TB cases
in Houston/Harris County, Texas between 1995 and 2004. Because of its
mandate to collect all active TB cases, the HTI archived samples from a variety
of TB disease manifestations, including HIV-negative and -positive pulmonary
and extrapulmonary TB cases with both positive and negative culture results.
Serum samples were obtained from HTI subjects who were notified of the
potential risks of study participation and provided written informed consent.
Demographic, microbiology, and diagnostic data are summarized in SI Ap-
pendix, Table S2.
Microwave-Assisted and Overnight Tryptic Digestion of Human Serum Samples.
Serum samples (100 μL) were mixed with 400 μL of 100 mM NH4HCO3 and
10 μL of 1 mg/mL sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 1.5-mL
Eppendorf tubes, placed in a 1,000-mL water bath, irradiated in a 1200 W
microwave oven at 20% power for 20 min, and then mixed with a 0.1% final
concentration of trifluoroacetic acid. Overnight trypsin digestions were in-
cubated at 37 °C for 12 h using the same amount of trypsin and the same
buffer conditions without a water bath and microwave irradiation.

 Characterization, Functionalization, and Antibody Immobilization of Nanodisks.
Bare nanodisks were fabricated following a previously reported protocol and
stored in ACS grade 99.9% isopropyl alcohol for maximum stability (45).
Functionalization details are reported in SI Appendix, Materials and Meth-
ods. Functionalized nanodisk suspensions (1 mL) were pelleted for 5 min at
10,000 × g, vacuum-dried, suspended in 1 mL of PBS (pH 8.6) containing
20 μg of anti-1593.75 or anti-1900.95 antibody (GL Biochem), mixed for 2 h
at 25 °C, pelleted for 5 min at 10,000 × g, incubated for 30 min in 1 mL of
200 mM Tris pH 7/100 mM NaCl solution, washed three times with PBS
(pH 7.4), pelleted and suspended in 60 μL of PBS (pH 7.4), and then stored at
4 °C until use (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B).
NanoDisk-MS Quantification of Mtb Antigens in Human Serum Samples. Stan-
dard curves were generated by spiking healthy donor serum with 0–100 nM
recombinant CFP-10 or ESAT-6, subjected to microwave-assisted digestion and
spiked with 10 nM stable isotope-labeled internal standard peptide (m/z
1,603.60 and 1,910.80; GenScript USA), mixed with antibody-conjugated nano-
disks for 2 h, pelleted for 5 min at 10,000 × g, washed three times with 1 mg/mL
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (Avanti Polar Lipids), suspended in
6 μL of deionized water and 4.5 μL (1.5 μL × 3) was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS,
using the MS intensity ratios of each target peptide and internal standards.

Serum samples used to determine antigen-derived MS signals from trypsinized
serum with or without Dynabead-mediated enrichment or NanoDisk-MS en-
richment and comatrix activity were made by serially diluting TB patient serum
with healthy human serum (2×, 4×, 8×, 16×, and 32×).
Statistical Analyses. GraphPad Prism 7 software was used to generate heat
maps and to calculate one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s posttest or Kruskal–
Wallis one-way ANOVA with Dunn’s posttest as determined by sample distri-
bution and variance. Differences were considered statistically significant at P <
0.05. The diagnostic accuracy of tests were evaluated using the receiving op-
erating characteristic curve. The cutoff values were estimated at various sen-
sitivities and specificities and determined at the maximum Youden index
value, that is, sensitivity + specificity − 1 (46). Data are presented as mean ±
SEM unless noted otherwise.
