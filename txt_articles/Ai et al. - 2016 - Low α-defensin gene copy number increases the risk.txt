Abstract
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Although
a major source of genetic variation, copy number variations (CNVs) and their involvement in
disease development have not been well studied. Here, we performed association analysis of the
DEFA1A3 CNV locus in two independent IgAN cohorts of Southern Chinese Han (total1189
cases and 1187 controls). We discovered three independent copy number associations within the
locus: DEFA1A3 (P=3.99×10-9, OR=0.88), DEFA3 (P=6.55×10-5, OR=0.82) and a noncoding
deletion variant (211bp) (P=3.50×10-16, OR=0.75) (OR per copy, fixed-effects meta-analysis).
While showing strong association with increased risk for IgAN (P=9.56×10-20), low total copy
numbers of the three variants also showed significant association with renal dysfunction in
 3
patients with IgAN (P=0.03, HR=3.69, after controlling for the effects of known prognostic
factors) as well as high serum IgA1 (P=0.02) and a high proportion of galactose-deficient IgA1
(P=0.03). For replication, we confirmed the associations of DEFA1A3 (P=4.42×10-4, OR=0.82)
and DEFA3 copy numbers (P=4.30×10-3, OR=0.74) with IgAN in a Caucasian cohort (531 cases
and 198controls) and found the 211bp variant to be much rarer in Caucasians. Interestingly, we
also observed an association of the 211bp copy number with membranous nephropathy
(P=1.11×10-7, OR=0.74 in 493 Chinese cases and 500 matched controls), but not with diabetic
kidney disease (in 806 Chinese cases and 786matched controls). By explaining 4.96% of disease
risk and influencing the renal dysfunction in IgAN, the DEFA1A3 CNV locus is a potential
candidate for therapeutic target and prognostic marker development.
Introduction
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide(1). The
clinicopathologic patterns and the prognosis of IgAN show wide variability, ranging from
asymptomatic to rapidly progressive forms(2). The pathogenesis of IgAN is not well understood,
but it is generally considered to be a complex and multifactorial disorder with both genetic and
environmental factors contributing to its development(3). Thus far, there have been five genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) for IgAN, and multiple susceptibility loci have been identified
(4-8). However, these GWAS loci can only explain 5% to 7.6% of total disease risk (7), and
none of them has an effect on disease prognosis.
Copy number variations (CNVs) have been shown to be a major source of genetic variation in
the human genome(9, 10) and have significant phenotypic impact by altering gene dosage,
 4
disrupting coding sequences or perturbing long-range gene regulation(11). Although CNVs have
been suggested to play important roles in disease development(10, 12, 13), the associations of
CNVs, particularly the role complex multi-allelic CNVs may play in complex diseases, are
poorly studied and understood, mainly due to experimental difficulties in measuring the copy
number of such variants accurately(14).The -defensin locus (DEFA1A3) is one of the complex
multi-allelic CNVs, presents as tandem repeats of a 19kb sequence unit, each of which contains
one copy of DEFA1 or DEFA3(differing by a single non-synonymous coding variant within the
third exon) as well as several internal bi-allelic polymorphisms(15-17). The protein products of
DEFA1A3, HNP1-3 (human neutrophil peptide 1to 3), are the most abundant of neutrophil
granule proteins, and there is evidence to suggest that neutrophils may play an important role in
mediating glomerular injury in IgAN(18-20). HNP1-3 have also been suggested to play a role in
the regulation of the complement system and pro-inflammatory cytokine production both of
which have been shown to play important pathogenic roles in IgAN(21-23). Interestingly, the
DEFA1A3 CNV is located within the new IgAN susceptibility locus on 8p23.1 that was first
discovered in the Chinese population and later validated by independent studies (4, 7, 8), which,
together with its biological functions, suggests the hypothesis that the DEFA1A3 CNV locus may
be involved in IgAN development.
To evaluate the role of DEFA1A3 CNV in IgAN, we performed a comprehensive association
analysis of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus in two independent IgAN cohorts of Southern Chinese Han,
consisting of 1189 cases and 1187 healthy controls. We discovered three strong independent
associations within the DEFA1A3 CNV locus and further demonstrated that the DEFA1A3CNVs
could also influence the prognosis of IgAN. For replication, we further confirmed the
 5
associations in Caucasian IgAN samples. Interestingly, we found an association with
membranous nephropathy (MN), but not diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in the Chinese
population.
Results
Distribution of DEFA1A3 CNVs in the Chinese population
Two independent cohorts of IgAN samples of southern Chinese Han were analyzed. The first
cohort had197 cases and 199 matched healthy controls in terms of age, gender and geographic
origin, and the second cohort included 992 cases and 988 healthy controls that were matched for
geographic origin(Table S1). We measured the copy numbers of DEFA1, DEFA3 and DEFA1A3
(DEFA1+DEFA3) as well as the copy numbers of three bi-allelic polymorphisms, 5bp indel
(129bp vs. 124bp), 7bp duplication (282bp vs. 275bp) and the 4bp deletion (211bp vs. 215bp)
using well-established paralogue ratio test (PRT)-based methods(16, 24) (Fig.S1). The PRT-
based methods have been shown to have much greater accuracy for measuring the copy numbers
of multi-allelic CNVs than real-time PCR analysis(25, 26) and have been successfully applied to
studies of genes encoding chemokines (CCL3L1/CCL4L1)(27), immunoglobulin-receptor
(FCGR3)(28), and beta-defensins (DEFB)(25, 29).
The copy number of DEFA1A3 ranged from 2 to 16 copies with a median copy number of 6 per
genome in our Chinese samples (Fig.S2, Table S2), which was consistent with the reported
median copy numbers of 6 in the HapMap CHB (Chinese Han from Beijing) samples and 7 in
CEU (CEPH Utah; United States) and ECACC (European Collection of Cell Culture; UK)
samples(15, 16), but lower than the reported median copy number of 9 in the Japanese
 6
population (the JPT samples of the HapMap project)(22). In addition, the DEFA1A3 copy
numbers of 24 HapMap CHB samples measured in this study showed a near-perfect correlation
with the sequencing read depth of these samples from the 1000 Genome Project (R2=0.98,
P<0.0001)(Fig.S3), confirming the accuracy of our copy number measurements. Correlation
analysis revealed that the copy numbers of DEFA1, 124bp, 275bp and 215bp correlated with
each other (P<0.0001)(TableS3).
Association analysis of the DEFA1A3 CNVs in Chinese cohort of patients with IgAN
We tested the associations of the DEFA1A3 CNVs with susceptibility to IgAN using logistic
regression analysis and by treating the two cohorts (see above) as independent samples through a
fixed-effects meta-analysis. Although sub-population structure existed between northern and
southern Chinese Han populations, the samples from southern China were genetically
homogeneous (30), and no control for population stratification was therefore included in our
association analysis. We found highly significant associations for the copy numbers of
DEFA1A3 (P=3.99×10-9, OR=0.88), DEFA1(P=6.71×10-5, OR=0.92), DEFA3 (P=6.55×10-8,
OR=0.82), 124bp (P=2.89×10-8, OR=0.87), 275bp (P=2.51×10-7, OR=0.89) and 211bp
(P=3.50×10-16, OR=0.75) (OR per copy, adjusted for age and gender) without any evidence of
genetic heterogeneity between the two independent cohorts (Table S4). Step-wise conditional
analysis demonstrated the independent associations of the 211bp, DEFA1A3 and DEFA3 and
further multivariate analysis also confirmed the independence of these three associations, 211bp
(P=1.71×10-9, OR=0.78), DEFA1A3 (P=2.20×10-3, OR=0.93) and DEFA3 (P=3.33×10-3,
OR=0.85) (Table 1). All of the three associations remained statistically significant after
 7
Bonferonni correction (0.05/9=5.56×10-3). No evidence was found for interaction among the
three independent CNVs (Table S5).
The patients carried significantly lower copy numbers of three CNVs than did the
controls, indicating that low copy numbers of these variants had a risk effect for IgAN. On
average, patients carried 1 copy of 211bp, 6 copies of DEFA1A3 and 1 copy of DEFA3, which
were all significantly lower than the median copy numbers in the healthy controls, which were 2
copies of 211bp (P=3.36×10-16), 7 copies of DEFA1A3 (P=4.74×10-8) and 1 copy of DEFA3
(P=2.56×10-4) (Table S6; Fig.1).We found that for all three CNVs, the risk was
reduced
progressively with the increase in copy number (Fig.2). For example, individuals carrying zero
copies of 211bp (about 26.8% of the population) had a 5.9-fold higher risk than those carrying
five or more copies (about 1.9% of the population) (P=2.17×10-6). The multi-variant genetic
score (GS) (the standardized weighted sum of the copy numbers) of the three variants (ranging
from 1.35 to 19.67) (Fig.S4) also showed strong association with IgAN susceptibility
(P=9.56×10-20). These three variants of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus could explain up to 4.96% of
phenotypic variance cumulatively.
Analysis of clinical phenotypes in a Chinese cohort of patients with IgAN
All of the 1189 IgAN patients analyzed in this study had clinical and pathological information
available (summarized in Table S7). In addition, of the 1189 IgAN patients, 382 patients had
follow-up information with a median follow-up time of 4.5 years (interquartile range, 3.8-5.4
years). Of the 382 patients, 27 patients progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD)
(eGFR<15ml/min/1.73m2, or dialysis, or renal transplantation), and 9 patients were found to
have a doubling of serum creatinine after diagnosis.
 8
The survival analysis of renal outcomes (ESRD or doubling of serum creatinine after
diagnosis) using the Cox regression model in the 382 IgAN patients revealed a significant
association of the multi-variant GS (ranging from 1.80 to 17.14) with renal degeneration in IgAN
(P=0.01, HR=0.79) after adjustment for known prognostic factors, including age, gender,
proteinuria, hypertension and serum creatinine at biopsy(31, 32) (Table 2).We further divided the
382 patients into five groups based on the quintile of their GS values and found that the patients
in the 1st quintile of GS (average GS=3.06) showed significantly worse renal function than the
patients of the 5th quintile (average GS=9.57) (P=0.03, HR=3.69, after adjustment for known
prognostic factors) (Fig. 3; Table 2). While confirmation is needed from further studies, our
results suggested that patients carrying low copies of DEFA1A3 CNVs had an increased risk for
poor renal outcomes.
The analysis of clinical phenotypes revealed the associations of the multi-variant GS with
hyperuricemia (P=0.01) and thickening of the arterial wall (P=0.008). However, the evidence
could not survive the conservative Bonferroni correction for testing 15 clinical phenotypes
(Table S8), and the findings need to be confirmed by further studies.
DEFA1A3 CNVs as the driver of the GWAS locus on 8p23.1
We genotyped rs2738048 and rs12716641 (the previously reported susceptible single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within DEFA1A3 CNV region by GWAS of the Chinese population)(4, 8)
in the same 1189 cases and 1187 controls and performed association analysis using the same
method described above. We confirmed the associations of rs2738048 (P=9.58×10-4, OR=0.80)
and rs12716641 (P=6.99×10-6, OR=0.72) in our samples (Table 1), but the associations were
weaker than those of 211bp, DEFA1A3 and DEFA3. Furthermore, conditioning on the
 9
association effect of either 211bp or DEFA1A3 fully abolished the association at rs2738048,
whereas all the associations of the DEFA1A3 CNVs remained highly significant after
conditioning the association effect at rs2738048 (Table S9). Consistently, the genotypes of
rs2738048 showed strong correlation with the copy numbers of 211bp and DEFA1A3 (Table S3;
Fig.S5). However, the association effect of rs12716641 remained significant even after
conditioning on all three risk variants of DEFA1A3 (P=2.54×10-4, OR=0.76) (Table S9). These
results clearly demonstrated that the previously reported association at rs2738048 was due to the
association effect of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus, while the association effect of rs12716641 was
independent of the DEFA1A3 CNV.
Replication study in Caucasian patients with IgAN and Chinese non-IgAN patients with
kidney disease
For replication, we investigated the associations of 211bp, DEFA1A3 and DEFA3 copy numbers
in a Caucasian IgAN cohort of 531 cases and 198 controls using the same genotyping method.
Both DEFA1A3 (P=4.42×10-4, OR=0.82) and DEFA3 (P=4.30×10-3, OR=0.74) showed
significant associations in the Caucasian cohort with consistent genetic effects as in the Chinese
cohort (Table 3). 211bp was, however, much rarer in the Caucasian population, and consequently
the association of 211bp did not reach statistical significance (P=7.56×10-2), although its genetic
effect was consistent between Caucasian (OR=0.79) and Chinese samples (OR=0.75) (Table 3,
Fig.S6).
We further investigated the associations of 211bp, DEFA1A3 and DEFA3 in two Chinese
cohorts with non-IgAN renal disease, that was, diabetic kidney disease(806 cases and 786 age
and gender-matched controls) and membranous nephropathy (493 cases and 500 age and gender-
 10
matched controls) using the same method. Interestingly, we detected significant association of
the 211bp variant with membranous nephropathy (P=1.11×10-7, OR=0.74 per copy), but no
association with diabetic kidney disease (Table4).
Association analysis of DEFA1A3 CNVs with HNP1-3 and IgA1
To investigate the effect of DEFA1A3 CNVs on HNP1-3 expression, we first measured the copy
numbers of DEFA1A3 CNVs (211bp, DEFA1A3 and DEFA3) as well as the serum and urine
amounts of HNP1-3 in 96 IgAN patients and 62 healthy controls. There were no significant
differences in copy number distributions of DEFA1A3 CNVs between patients and controls
(Wilcoxon test P>0.05). In both serum and urine, HNP1-3 was significantly higher in patients
than healthy controls (P<0.001) (Fig.4), which was consistent with the fact that HNP1-3 were
largely produced by activated neutrophils during an inflammatory response (33). However, we
could not find any correlation between DEFA1A3 CNVs and the amounts of either serum or
urine HNP1-3 (TableS10). In addition, we also analyzed HNP1-3 in the neutrophils isolated from
83 IgAN patients and 79 healthy controls after stimulating neutrophils with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). While there were no differences in DEFA1A3 copy number distributions between the
patients and controls (Wilcoxon test P>0.05), the amount of extracellular HNP1-3 after
stimulation with LPS (100ng/ml for 6 hours) was significantly lower in neutrophils isolated
from patients than controls (P=0.006)(Fig.4). However, we did not detect any association
between the DEFA1A3 CNVs and the amount of extracellular HNP1-3 (Table S10).
Given that the formation of galactose-deficient IgA1-containing immune complexes is
the key pathogenic factor contributing to the development of IgAN(34), we also investigated the
effects of DEFA1A3 CNVs on serum IgA1 levels and the proportion of galactose-deficient IgA1
 11
in 96 IgAN patients and 62 controls. As expected, the serum IgA1 levels and proportion of
galactose-deficient IgA1 were both significantly higher in IgAN patients than in healthy controls
(P<0.01) (Fig.S7). Although there was no significant evidence for individual DEFA1A3 CNVs,
the multi-variant GS of these variants did show significant negative association with both the
serum IgA1 levels (P=0.02) and the proportion of galactose-deficient IgA1 (P=0.03) (TableS11).
These results were suggestive and need to be confirmed by further studies.
Discussion
Our current study has discovered three independent risk factors for IgAN within the DEFA1A3
CNV locus, the copy numbers of DEFA1A3, DEFA3 and 211bp, by analyzing two independent
Chinese IgAN cohorts and further confirming the association in a Caucasian IgAN cohort.
Although each extra copy of these CNVs was only associated with moderate reduction of IgAN
risk (by 12% to 25%), the overall impact of the whole DEFA1A3 CNV locus was strong, because
each person carried multiple copies of these variants. By explaining 4.96 % of risk variance, the
DEFA1A3 CNV locus is the strongest genetic susceptibility factor that has been discovered for
IgAN so far. Interestingly, our study also revealed that the low copy number of DEFA1A3 CNV
was associated with poor renal function in IgAN patients as well as high serum IgA1 levels and
the proportion of galactose-deficient IgA1, a known pathogenic risk factor for IgAN.
Consistently, our study has also demonstrated that HNP1-3 expression was elevated during an
inflammatory response as seen in the serum and urine samples of patients; neutrophils from
healthy individuals produced more HNP1-3 than did those of IgAN patients when stimulated by
LPS. Taken together, our genetic and expression analysis suggested that HNP1-3 may provide a
protective effect against development of IgAN and the progression of renal dysfunction.
 12
Interestingly, our study has also revealed a strong association of the DEFA1A3 CNV (211bp)
with membranous nephropathy, but not diabetic kidney disease, although our diabetic kidney
disease cohort had a bigger sample size and thus more power than did the membranous
nephropathy cohort to detect the association. The genetic effect (OR) of 211bp consistent
between membranous nephropathy (OR=0.74) and IgAN (OR=0.75) without evidence of
heterogeneity (I2=0, Q test=0.84), suggesting the shared protective effect of 211bp variant
against both membranous nephropathy and IgAN. Both IgAN and membranous nephropathy are
common primary glomerulonephritis that are mediated by immune complexes . In contrast,
diabetic kidney disease is a chronic microvascular complication of diabetes due to metabolic
dysregulation (35). Although the precise immunopathogenesis of IgAN and membranous
nephropathy remains unclear, HLA-DQA1 has been shown to be associated with both IgAN and
membranous nephropathy(6, 36). Taken together, these results suggest that there are shared
pathogenic pathways between IgAN and membranous nephropathy, and that the DEFA1A3 CNV
locus may have a broad impact on the development of primary glomerulonephritis.
It is interesting to see the independent association effect of DEFA3 copy number beyond
the DEFA1A3copy number. DEFA3 is a more recent human-specific variant that arose
fromDEFA1 through a non-synonymous coding mutation in the third exon(15). Previous studies
have suggested that HNP3 was less active than HNP1, although HNP3was expressed at about
twice the level of HNP1(33, 37, 38). It is intriguing that the 211bp copy number also showed an
independent association effect. The 211bp is a 4bp deletion variant (TATC) within the second
intron of DEFA1A3. Its molecular function is unclear, but the analysis by Human Splicing
Finder(39) suggests that this 4bp deletion may create a new splice acceptor site (CAG), raising
 13
the possibility that this 4bp deletion may create new splice isoforms, which may in turn influence
the expression and activities of the HNP1-3 protein.
Our large-scale protein analysis, however, failed to reveal a direct correlation between the
DEFA1A3 copy numbers and HNP1-3 levels in serum and urine as well as the production of
HNP1-3 by neutrophils upon LPS stimulation. Previous studies of DEFA1A3 expression and its
correlation with its copy number were limited. The mRNA analysis in leukocytes and
lymphoblastoid cell lines(15, 22) as well as plasma protein analysis in patients with severe sepsis
did not show correlation (40), but a small study (8 subjects) showed the correlation of HNP1-3
amounts inside neutrophils with the copy numbers of DEFA1A3(17). The failure to show a
correlation between the DEFA1A3 copy numbers and expression of HNP1-3 in the previous and
current studies is probably due to the fact that HNP1-3 are mainly produced by the bone marrow
precursors of neutrophils, promyelocytes and early myelocytes(33). As demonstrated in other
CNV loci (41, 42), a full understanding of the haplotype structure (allelic structure) of the whole
DEFA1A3 CNV locus may also be necessary for demonstrating the correlation.
DEFA1A3 CNVs could potentially influence IgAN development and renal disease
progression in several ways. First, as DEFA1A3 is primarily expressed in promyelocytes within
bone marrow, it may have physiological effects on the bone marrow microenvironment (43, 44).
Second, recent studies of IgAN pathogenesis have highlighted the important role of impaired
immune regulation along the mucosa-bone marrow axis and have suggested that galactose-
deficient IgA1 seems to be overproduced in bone marrow(45-47). DEFA1A3 CNVs may
influence the impaired mucosa-bone marrow axis through its impact on the overproduction of
galactose-deficient IgA1. Third, HNP1-3 plays a very important role in innate immunity, and
 14
neutrophils are the first defenders against infection. DEFA1A3 CNVs may influence the
dysregulated mucosal immune response in IgAN by enhancing inflammatory signals(48).
Our study has demonstrated that the DEFA1A3 CNVs may be the primary driver of the
previously reported association within the GWAS locus on 8p23.1(4). The DEFA1A3 CNVs
showed stronger associations than the previously reported SNP rs2738048, and conditioning on
the effect of DEFA1A3 CNVs fully abolished the association at rs2738048, but not vice versa.
So, the association at rs2738048was secondaryto the association effect of DEFA1A3 CNVs. In
addition, our study has also demonstrated that the newly reported susceptibility signal
rs12716641(8)was independent ofDEFA1A3 CNVs. A previous study reported a positive
correlation between DEFA1A3copy number and rs2738048, but did not evaluate the association
of DEFA1A3 with IgAN(49). Recently, a newly published IgAN GWAS revealed another
independent SNP rs10086568 within the GWAS locus on 8p23.1 in a Caucasian population(7). It
would be interesting to investigate whether the association of this SNP is also due to the effect of
DEFA1A3 CNVs in a future study.
Two major limitations of this study should be noted. First, our current findings are largely
of genetic associations. The potential mechanisms underlying the involvement of the DEFA1A3
in the development of IgAN are interesting and biologically plausible, but do need to be
elucidated by future functional investigations. Second, the current study did not investigate the
haplotype structure of DEFA1A3 CNVs, because current genotyping and sequencing
technologies could not determine the haplotype structure of multi-allelic CNVs with long
repeats in unrelated samples. Rapid development of long read Next Generation Sequencing
analysis may offer opportunities to characterize the haplotype structure of DEFA1A3 CNVs and
 15
understand in detail how different DEFA1A3 CNVs work together to influence the level and
functionality of HNP proteins and susceptibility to developing IgAN.
In summary, our study discovered the association of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus with
IgAN risk and renal disease progression, and is one of the few cases where the association of a
complex multi-allelic CNV has been demonstrated robustly. Our study has clearly demonstrated
that this multi-allelic CNV is the strongest genetic susceptibility locus for IgAN identified so far
and may have a broad impact on the development of primary glomerular diseases. By
demonstrating its protective effect again IgAN development and renal disease progression, our
study has suggested the possibility of HNP1-3 as a candidate therapeutic target and prognostic
marker.
Materials and Methods
Study design
The study was designed to investigate the effect of DEFA1A3 CNV locus on IgAN development
by analyzing the association between the copy numbers of DEFA1A3 CNVs with IgAN
susceptibility and renal disease progression. First, two independent cohorts of Southern Chinese
Han, consisting of 1189 IgAN cases and 1187 controls, were employed for the association
analysis. Second, for replication, the three risk variants of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus discovered
in Chinese subjects with IgAN were further analyzed in additional samples from Caucasian
IgAN patients and controls (531cases and 198 age-, gender-matched controls), Chinese subjects
with diabetic kidney disease and controls(806 cases and 786 age-, gender-matched controls) and
Chinese subjects with membranous nephropathy and controls (493 cases and 500 age-, gender-
matched controls). Clinicopathologic information and follow-up data were collected from
 16
Chinese IgAN patients to further assess the clinical impact of DEFA1A3 CNVs on renal disease
progression. We also investigated the relationship between the DEFA1A3 CNV locus and the
previously published GWAS locus on 8q23.1 by genotyping the reported SNPs (rs2738048,
rs12716641) in the same Chinese cohorts. Lastly, we investigated the effects of DEFA1A3
CNVs on the expression of HNP1-3 and the proportion of galactose-deficient IgA1.There was no
randomization or blinding.
Study subjects
All IgAN cases were histopathologically diagnosed as primary IgAN by renal biopsy according
to the following criteria: (i) immunofluorescence showing at least 2 + (scale 0 to 3 +) mesangial
deposition of IgA, with IgA comprising the dominant immunoglobulin deposited in the
glomeruli, and (ii) excluding individuals with cirrhosis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis,
hepatitis B-associated glomerulonephritis, HIV infection and systemic lupus erythematosus. All
cases of diabetic kidney disease were diagnosed as persistent albuminuria (>30mg/g) and/or low
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR<60m/min/1.73m2) in patients with diabetes(50).
Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose≥7.0 mmol/L and/or 2-h postprandial plasma
glucose ≥ 11.1mmol/L, by the use of hypoglycemic agents despite fasting plasma glucose, or any
self-reported history of diabetes. All membranous nephropathy cases were adult biopsy-proven
idiopathic membranous nephropathy . All the healthy controls were clinically verified with
normal urinalysis (without red blood cells and protein in urine) and normal serum creatinine
levels. Gender, age, geographical origin and ethnicity information were collected from both
cases and controls through questionnaires. All subjects completed a written informed consent

form, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The First
Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.
Copy number measurements
Using the established paralogue ratio test-based methods(16, 51), we measured the copy numbers
of DEFA1A3 (DEFA1 + DEFA3) (by MLT1A0 and DEFA4PRT) and the copy numbers of
DEFA1 and DEFA3 (by DefHae3 ratio), as well as the allelic copy numbers of three internal bi-
allelic polymorphisms; 5bp indel (129bp vs. 124bp, measured by Indel5 ratio), 7bp duplication
(282bp vs. 275bp, measured by7bpdup ratio) and 4bp deletion (211bp vs. 215bp, measured by
Del4 ratio)(Fig.S1). These internal variants were chosen as part of PRT methodology which can
help to determine the copy number more accurately(16). Previous studies have suggested that
internal variants may influence the expression and functionality of HNP proteins(15) and showed
good correlation with major haplotype classes of DEFA1A3 locus at least in Europeans(51). In
brief, we combined the information from multiplex PRTs (MLT1A0 and DEFA4 PRTs) and four
allelic ratio measurements (DefHae3/Indel5/7bpdup/Del4) into a maximum-likelihood
framework to assign each sample to an integer copy number for all the DEFA1A3 CNVs with
high confidence, as previously described(16).
For the newly-characterized 4bp deletion (TATC)variant within the second intron of DEFA1A3,
the Del4 assay was developed in this study. The PCR for the Del4 assay was performed by
using1uM of the primers TGCTCTCATTTTTGCATTCC and NED-
TTTCTCCAAAGACTTGATTCCAA and 27 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30
seconds, and 68°C for 60 seconds, followed by a 70°C hold for 40 minutes to generate amplicon
 18
products of 211bp/215bp from 10ng genomic DNA input. The products were mixed with 10ul
HiDi formamide with ROX-500 marker (Applied Biosystems) for fragment analysis using an
ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer. GeneMapper 4.1 (Applied Biosystems) was used to extract the peak
areas of the separated PCR products. The ratio between the 211bp and 215bp products (Del4
ratio) was estimated, and the copy numbers of the 211bp and 215bpalleles were calculated by
using this Del4 ratio and the total copy number of DEFA1A3.
For the PRT analysis of the total number of DEFA1A3, seven CEPH/UTAH samples were
included as reference samples of known copy number: NA11931 (7 copies), NA07347 (8 copies),
NA11930 (5 copies), NA11993 (7 copies), NA06993 (8 copies), NA12248 (6 copies) and
NA12249 (8 copies).The copy numbers of these reference samples had been determined
unequivocally in previous studies using both segregation and read depth analyses (16, 51).The
total DEFA1A3copy numbers were determined by calibration of MLT1A0/DEFA4 PRTs against
these reference samples, and the copy numbers of the other variants (DEFA1 vs. DEFA3, 129bp
vs. 124bp, 282bp vs. 275bp, and 211bp vs. 215bp) were determined by using the total DEFA1A3
copy numbers and the ratio between the copy numbers of two variants.
Copy number measurements were carried out by the Nottingham group (Chinese IgAN cohort I),
the Guangzhou group (Chinese IgAN cohort II, Chinese DKD and MN cohort) and the Leicester
group (UK IgAN cohort) using the same methods(Table S1).
Genotyping analysis of rs2738048 and rs12716641
 19
Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan assay from ABI and established methods (see
Supplement Materials).
Measurement of HNP1-3 in serum and urine
The serum and urine levels of HNP1–3 were measured with the HNP1–3 ELISA Test Kit
(Hycult biotechnology, Uden, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer‘s instructions.
Serum was diluted 1:50 in appropriate buffer, while urine was analyzed without dilution. Both
serum and urine samples were transferred in duplicate samples to microtitre plates for incubation
procedures. Absorbance was measured at 450nm using the SpectraMaxPlus384 Microplatereader
(Molecular devices, USA).The concentration of HNP1–3was calculated according to the
standard curve.
Isolation, culture and stimulation of human neutrophils
Whole blood (5mL) was collected using EDTA-coated vacutainer and processed immediatelyfor
neutrophil purification. Neutrophils were isolated by single-step centrifugation of whole blood
onto Polymorphprep (Axis-Shield, Norway) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.
Neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum at a final concentration of 1x106/mL. The purity of the neutrophils was on average >95%.
Trypan blue exclusion showed greater than 96% viability. Neutrophils were maintained at 37°C
in the presence of 5% CO2and then stimulated with 100ng/mL of Ec-LPS
(Sigma,cat.no.L4391)for 6 hours. Neutrophils from similar cultures not exposed to stimulants
were used as negative controls. After incubation, cells were centrifuged and the culture
supernatants were stored at -80°C until use for the determination of HNP1-3. The concentration
 20
of HNP 1-3 in culture supernatants was measured with the HNP1-3 ELISA kit (Hycult Biotech,
Uden, The Netherlands) as above description. The ratio for HNP1-3 level in stimulated
supernatants normalized with that of negative controls was used in cell culture experiments.
Serum IgA1and galactose-deficient IgA1
Serum IgA1 and galactose-deficient IgA1 (using Helix pomatiaagglutinin, HPA, a lectin that
binds terminal GalNAc in galactose-deficient IgA1) were measured by ELISA. The serum
samples were diluted by 1:40000 for serum IgA1 and 1: 500 for galactose-deficient IgA1. For the
measurement of serum IgA1, a standard consisting of native IgA1 (Calbiochem) was used at
concentrations from 600ng/ml to 4.68ng/ml. Rabbit anti-human IgA F(ab’)2 and HRP-labeled
F(ab’)2 fragment of goat IgG anti-human IgA1 were purchased from Dako and SouthernBiotech,
respectively. Neuraminidase and biotin-labeled HPA were purchased from Roche and Sigma,
respectively. The absorbance was measured at 490nm with a SpectraMaxPlus384
Microplatereader (Molecular devices, USA).The serum concentration of IgA1was calculated
according to the standard curve. The relative galactose-deficient IgA1 level (proportion of serum
IgA1) was calculated as the A490 value of HPA over the A490 level of IgA1.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of DEFA1A3 CNVs and SNPs. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Chi-square tests were
used to determine the distribution differences in DEFA1A3 CNVs and SNPs between cases and
controls. Spearman correlation analyses were used to test the correlations between DEFA1A3
CNVs and SNPs. Association analyses were performed using PROC LOGISTIC in SAS 9.2
software (SAS Institute), and the fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed in PLINK(52). The
 21
degree of heterogeneity was estimated using the heterogeneity index (I2) and Cochran’s Q test.
Conditional association analyses were performed using a stepwise logistic regression model. A
multivariate association analysis was conducted to confirm the independence of associations.
Interaction analysis was performed by adding the product term of two CNVs into the logistic
regression analysis. A composite genetic score (GS) of the three risk-associated variants
(DEFA1A3, DEFA3 and 211bp) was built by calculating the standardized weighted sum of copy
numbers where the copy number of each DEFA1A3 CNV was weighted by its predicted effect
size (natural log of OR from multi-variant logistic regression analysis), and the sum of the
weighted copy numbers of the three variants was then divided by the average effect size to
rescale the score (standardization). The percentage of the total variance explained was estimated
by calculating Nagelkerke’s pseudo R2 using the fmsb package where the diploid copies of
independent DEFA1A3 CNVs and the affection status were entered into the glm function in R (v
2.15.1).OR values were measured as OR per copy of DEFA1A3 CNV. P<0.05 after Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing was considered as statistically significant.
Analysis of clinical phenotypes and DEFA1A3 CNVs. A linear regression model was applied
for association analysis of quantitative phenotypes, while a logistic regression model was used
for analyzing categorical variables and an ordinal logistic regression model was used for ordinal
variables. Survival analysis was performed using both univariate (for the GS only) and
multivariate (GS and known prognostic factors) Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier
method. Hazard ratios (HR) were reported to evaluate the prognostic effects.
 22
Association analysis of HNP1-3 and IgA1 expression with DEFA1A3 CNVs. Linear
regression analyses were applied to detect associations between DEFA1A3 CNVs and expression
level of HNP1-3 and IgA1 in samples adjusted by disease status. We assigned normal
transformed values of HNP1-3 or IgA1 as independent variables, while threeDEFA1A3 CNVs
(DEFA1A3, DEFA3 and 211bp, or the combined genetic score) were treated as dependent
variables. Standardized β and P value were reported to evaluate the associations.
All the statistical analyses of clinical phenotypes and HNP1-3 and IgA1 expression were
performed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute).

Fig.1. Copy number distribution of the three variants of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus. The
copy number distribution of the three variants of the DEFA1A3 CNV locus was examined in
1189 Chinese patients with IgAN and 1187 controls. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to
determine the significance of the distribution difference. Lower copies of DEFA1A3 CNVs were
more frequent in IgAN patients than in controls: (A) DEFA1A3(B) DEFA3 (C) 211bp.
Fig.2. Distribution of OR values according to different copy numbers of the DEFA1A3
CNVs. OR values were calculated from logistic regression analysis in the combined Chinese
IgAN patient cohorts. The percentage of Chinese population carrying a particular copy number
of CNV variant was shown on Y axis. The overall risk of IgAN decreased steadily with the
increase in copy number for each variant: (A) 211bp (B) DEFA1A3 (C) DEFA3.

Fig.3. Survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method
IgAN patients with follow-up data were divided into five groups based on the quintiles of genetic
score (GS): Q1 (1st quintile), Q2 (2nd quintile), Q3 (3rd quintile), Q4 (4th quintile) and Q5
(5thquintile). A significant difference in survival of renal function was observed among the five
groups of patients with different GS (Log Rank P=0.0008).
Fig.4. Amounts of HNP1-3 in serum and urine. Shown are the amounts of HNP1-3 in (A)
serum (B) urine and (C) produced by neutrophils after stimulation with LPS. Wilcoxon rank sum
tests were used to determine the significance of the expression differences. Serum and urine
HNP1-3 were both significantly higher in IgAN patients (P<0.001), whereas HNP1-3 produced
by neutrophils after stimulation with LPS in vitro was significantly lower in IgAN patients
compared to controls (P<0.01).
