Accumulating evidence points to an important role for the gut microbiome in anti-tumor
immunity. Here, we show that altered intestinal microbiota contributes to anti-tumor
immunity, limiting tumor expansion. Mice lacking the ubiquitin ligase RNF5 exhibit attenuated
activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) components, which coincides with
increased expression of inflammasome components, recruitment and activation of dendritic
cells and reduced expression of antimicrobial peptides in intestinal epithelial cells. Reduced
UPR expression is also seen in murine and human melanoma tumor specimens that
responded to immune checkpoint therapy. Co-housing of Rnf5−/− and WT mice abolishes
the anti-tumor immunity and tumor inhibition phenotype, whereas transfer of 11 bacterial
strains, including B. rodentium, enriched in Rnf5−/− mice, establishes anti-tumor immunity
and restricts melanoma growth in germ-free WT mice. Altered UPR signaling, exemplified in
Rnf5−/− mice, coincides with altered gut microbiota composition and anti-tumor immunity to
control melanoma growth.

 T
he clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint therapies has led
to their use for a growing number of tumor types1. Despite
this success, a significant proportion of patients exhibit
resistance to immune checkpoint blockade2. As such a more
detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
selectivity of the tumor response and control of immune check-
point components is urgently needed. Unexpectedly, the effi-
ciency of immune checkpoint therapy has been linked to the
composition of the gut microbiota3,4. Although different studies
have demonstrated that manipulation of the gut microbiota may
impact antitumor immunity both in mice and human, the
underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Nota-
bly, the identification of host genes/pathways that contribute to
the regulation of the host microbiota and antitumor immunity is
expected to be essential for the development of advanced ther-
apeutic strategies.
RNF5 is a membrane-anchored E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated
in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation
(ERAD)5.
RNF5
controls
clearance
of
misfolded
proteins,
including
mutant
cystic
fibrosis
transmembrane
regulator
(CFTR)6 and glutamine carrier proteins, which are aberrantly
folded following chemotherapy-induced ER stress (ERS)7. RNF5
also controls stability of the autophagy protein autophagy-related
four homolog B (ATG4B)8. RNF5 was implicated in the control
of stimulator of interferon genes (STING)9, a central signaling
molecule
in
T-cell
priming
and
immune
checkpoint
efficiency10,11. We thus investigated the potential effect of RNF5
on immune checkpoint control and tumor growth. Here, we
demonstrate
that
Rnf5−/−
mice
exhibits
altered
intestinal
microbiota flora, which contributes to antitumor immunity,
limiting tumor expansion.
Results
Antitumor immunity in Rnf5−/− mice inhibits melanoma. To
determine whether Rnf5−/− mice exhibit altered antitumor
immune response, we evaluated the growth of a series of mouse
melanoma cell lines injected subcutaneously into the flank of
syngeneic Rnf5−/− C57BL/6 mice obtained by crossing of Rnf5
heterozygotes. Tumors arising from YUMM1.3, YUMM1.5, and
YUMM1.9 cells (all BrafV600E:Pten−/−:Cdkn2a−/−)12, or B16F10
melanoma cells, or from shRNF5-expressing YUMM1.3 cells, all
grew to the same extent over the first week followed by slower
growth resulting in significantly smaller tumors in Rnf5−/−
compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 1a; Supplementary
Figure 1A). Correspondingly, tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice
exhibited better survival, compared with the WT genotype
(Supplementary Figure 1B). These data raised the possibility that
RNF5 within the host would contribute to the control of anti-
tumor immunity. The antitumor immune response was inter-
rogated by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells isolated on days 16 and 24 after
tumor cell injection. The results showed a marked enrichment of
total CD45+ cells and effector (CD44hi) CD8+ and CD4+ T cells
in tumors from Rnf5−/− versus WT mice (Fig. 1b; Supplementary
Figure 1C). Rnf5−/− tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lym-
phocytes (TILs) also displayed greater effector function, including
enhanced IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 production (Fig. 1c; Supple-
mentary Figure 1D). These data suggest that superior recruitment
and effector function of TILs might underlie the more potent
antitumor response observed in Rnf5−/− mice. In support of this,
the total number of dendritic cells (DCs), including myeloid
(mDCs), plasmacytoid (pDCs), and CD8+ conventional DCs,
were higher in tumors from Rnf5−/− than WT mice (Fig. 1d).
Rnf5−/− DCs also expressed higher levels of MHC class II and the
costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 (Fig. 1e).
Expression of MHC class II as well as CD80 and CD86 molecules
was also higher on tumor-infiltrating macrophages from Rnf5−/−
compared with WT mice (Supplementary Figure 1E). Of note,
expression of the inhibitory checkpoint receptors PD-1, T-cell
immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), and lymphocyte-
activation 3 (LAG-3) were also upregulated on Rnf5−/− CD8+
T cells (Supplementary Figure 1F) and PD-L1 expression was
upregulated on Rnf5−/− macrophages and DCs (Supplementary
Figure 1G), further implying that enhanced immune stimulation
in Rnf5−/− mice overcomes immune checkpoint-mediated inhi-
bition of antitumor response. Altogether, these data indicate a
clear shift to a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment in
Rnf5−/− mice.
To provide independent support for a role for tumor-specific
T cells in the antitumor response of Rnf5−/− mice, we transferred
OVA-specific OT-I transgenic CD8+ T cells into WT or Rnf5−/−
recipient mice and then injected recipients subcutaneously with
OVA-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells. Analysis of tumor-
draining and non-draining lymph nodes revealed that OT-I
CD8+ T cells were more abundant in the draining lymph nodes
of Rnf5−/− compared with WT mice (Fig. 1f; Supplementary
Figure 1H). Since the degree
of T-cell proliferation was
comparable in both genotypes (Supplementary Figure 1I), we
attribute their greater abundance to their improved survival or
greater recruitment of OT-1 cells into the draining LN in Rnf5−/−
microenvironments. Since OT-1 cells are engaged in early
priming events, their analysis is restricted to lymph nodes and
not tumors, which were collected at later times. These results
indicate that the improved immune response observed in
Rnf5−/− mice occurs upstream of T-cell expansion, likely at the
level of host DCs.
The importance of the immune system for tumor control seen
in the Rnf5−/− mice was confirmed upon administration of
antibodies depleting CD4+ (Fig. 1g) or CD8+ (Fig. 1h) T cells,
which abrogated the ability of Rnf5−/− mice to inhibit melanoma
tumor growth, with a small additive effect upon CTLA4, but not
PD-1 blockade (Supplementary Figure 1J, K). These results point
to a critical role for RNF5 in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-
dependent antitumor immune response.
We asked next whether the observed antitumor immunity in
Rnf5−/− mice was due to loss of RNF5 in hematopoietic or non-
hematopoietic cells. To do so, we examined tumor growth in the
bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice created by injection of either
WT or Rnf5−/− bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated WT or
Rnf5−/− recipients. While tumor growth in Rnf5−/− → Rnf5−/−
chimeras was inhibited, this was not the case following BM
transfer from WT → Rnf5−/− and Rnf5−/− → WT chimeras,
where tumor growth was comparable with that in WT BM → WT
mice (Fig. 1i). These observations provided the first indication
that a non-hematopoietic compartment is also required for the
antitumor response seen in the Rnf5−/− mice.
TLRs are required for antitumor response in Rnf5−/− mice. To
identify potential differences in immunoregulatory gene expres-
sion in WT and Rnf5−/− mice, we performed NanoString analysis
of 770 genes expressed by 24 immune cell types in the tumors at
10 days after injection. This analysis uncovered marked differ-
ences in key immune regulatory networks associated with T, DC,
natural killer (NK), and macrophage cell function (Fig. 2a; Sup-
plementary Figure 2A). Interestingly, changes in expression of
chemokines and genes related to innate immunity, antigen pre-
sentation, and DC functional networks suggested a possible role
for TLRs in Rnf5−/− mouse phenotypes (Supplementary Fig-
ure 2B). Changes in gene expression identified by NanoString
analysis were confirmed by qPCR analysis of cDNA derived from

 tumors grown in WT and Rnf5−/− mice (Supplementary Fig-
ure 2C). Chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), which is
associated with TLR signaling, was also upregulated in serum
from tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− compared with WT mice (Supple-
mentary Figure 2D). To this end, we generated mice lacking both
myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), a key
adaptor downstream from TLR signaling, and RNF5 (MyD88−/−:
Rnf5−/−). Importantly, melanoma growth was no longer inhib-
ited in MyD88−/−Rnf5−/− mice, with MyD88−/− mice exhibiting
a tumor growth phenotype between that of the WT and
MyD88−/−Rnf5−/− double-knockout mice (Fig. 2b). These data
demonstrate a role for the TLRs including their master regulator

 MyD88 in the enhanced antitumor immunity induced in Rnf5−/−
mice, while the role of IL-IR can not be excluded.
Our results suggested that the enhanced antitumor immune
response in Rnf5−/− mice involved both TLRs signaling as well as
a non-hematopoietic component. We therefore assessed possible
changes in both TLRs and inflammasome components of
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which have been previously
associated with an altered gut microbiota composition and
enhanced antitumor immunity13–15. Indeed, expression of TLR4
and TLR9 and also that of pathogen-associated molecular pattern
receptor signaling pathways and the inflammasome components
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), NLR
family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and NOD-like
receptor family pyrin domain 6 (NLRP6) was upregulated in IECs
from tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 2c), not naive Rnf5−/−
mice
(Supplementary
Figure
2E).
Enhanced
cytokine
and
chemokine expression were observed in IECs from tumor-
bearing Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 2d). These activities likely underlie
TLR activation and the concomitant antitumor phenotypes seen
in Rnf5−/− mice.
Gut microbiota defines antitumor immunity in Rnf5−/− mice.
Growing evidence supports the importance of the gut micro-
biome in control of immune surveillance and tumor responses to
therapy3,4. We therefore analyzed whether phenotypes seen in
Rnf5−/− mice were linked to, or affected by, changes in compo-
sition of the gut microbiota. To map the composition of the gut
microbiota in both WT and Rnf5−/− mice, we performed 16S
sequencing of V3–V4 regions followed by computational analysis.
Principal component analysis revealed marked differences in
microbial community structure (Fig. 3a), differences that dis-
tinctly segregated Rnf5−/− from WT microbiota. We therefore
asked whether differences in gut microbiota composition might
underlie the phenotypes of tumor growth inhibition and
enhanced antitumor immunity seen in the Rnf5−/− mice. Two
key experiments were performed to address this question. First,
mice received an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) in drinking water
2 weeks before tumor inoculation. Strikingly, ABX treatment
largely prevented the inhibition of tumor growth inhibition seen
in Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the gut microbiota play
a key role in the control of tumor growth in the Rnf5−/− mice.
Second, co-housing of mice, that is known to compromise such
differences between mice harboring distinct microbiota com-
mensals16, notably diminished segregation of the bacterial land-
scapes seen when genotypes were housed separately (Fig. 3c).
Melanoma growth in Rnf5−/− mice that were co-housed with WT
mice, was no longer inhibited (Fig. 3d), again pointing to the
importance of gut microbiota components present in Rnf5−/− for
limiting tumor growth. Notably, loss of antitumor immunity seen
in the Rnf5−/− mice coincided with the loss of tumor growth
inhibition following co-housing. Thus, co-housing of the Rnf5−/−
with the WT mice led to reduced numbers of TILs, including
CD44hi CD4+, CD44hi CD8+ T cells, and CD45+ cells, con-
comitant with decreased frequencies of cytokine-producing
T cells (Fig. 3e), decreased numbers of DCs and DC subsets
(Fig. 3f), and lower MHC class II expression on DCs (Supple-
mentary Figure 3A). These observations establish the importance
of the gut microbiota in Rnf5−/− mice in the control of antitumor
immunity and tumor growth inhibition.
Bacterial strains are enriched in the gut microbiota of Rnf5−/−
mice. Sequencing of the amplified 16S V3–V4 region followed by
computational analyses, led to the identification of 38 taxa that
distinguished the microbiomes of tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− from
tumor-bearing WT mice (Fig. 3g; Supplementary Table 1). The
cooccurrence of these taxa is notable as inter-correlated clusters
are formed based on correlation of abundance (Supplementary
Figure 3B). These taxa were dominated by those positively cor-
related with tumor size, whereas only 11 taxa displayed a sig-
nificant negative correlation with tumor size (Supplementary
Figure 3C, D). Positively correlated taxa were highly enriched in
members of the Firmicutes phylum, particularly members of
Clostridiales, whereas negatively correlated taxa were enriched for
members of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides.
Since differentially abundant phylotypes exist in the back-
ground of strains and species belonging to target genera that may
or may not be altered in Rnf5−/− mice, we assessed the absolute
abundance of Bacteroides, Alistipes, Lactobacillus, and Bacter-
oides massiliensis. No difference was found in absolute bacterial
abundance of Bacteroides or Alistipes comparing WT and
Rnf5−/− mice in either naive or tumor-bearing mice. A decrease
in the absolute abundance of Lactobacillus in tumor-bearing
Rnf5−/− mice was found, compared with tumor-bearing WT
mice, and an increase in Bacteroides massiliensis was identified in
naive Rnf5−/− mice, compared with naive WT mice (Supple-
mentary Figure 3E).
Bacterial strains confer antitumor immunity in GF WT mice.
To directly test whether the gut microbiota regulated antitumor
immunity, we transferred cecal contents from either WT or
Rnf5−/− into germ-free (GF) mice via oral gavage 2 weeks prior
to tumor implantation. Prophylactic transfer of Rnf5−/− micro-
biota was sufficient to delay tumor growth (Fig. 4a), as well as to
enhance infiltration of tumor-specific CD45+, CD4+, CD8+
T cells and increase cytokine production (Fig. 4b), supporting a
role for the Rnf5−/− microbiota in mediating antitumor effects.
We next created a cocktail of 12 bacterial strains that displayed
a significant negative correlation with tumor size and were
overrepresented in Rnf5−/− mice compared with WT counter-
parts (Supplementary Table 2). GF recipient mice were then
administered either Altered Schadler Flora (ASF) or ASF plus that

 cocktail. Administration of the latter to GF mice markedly
inhibited melanoma growth (Fig. 4c), which was associated with
an increased infiltration of T cells and an enhanced antitumor
cytokine response (Fig. 4d) compared with GF mice administered

this bacterial cocktail is not limited to C57BL/6 GF mice, and is
also effective in different genetic mouse strains and melanomas of

 diverse mutational backgrounds. Notably, one of the 12 strains of
the cocktail was B. rodentium, which was also enriched in animals
that underwent anti-CTLA-4 therapy (Supplementary Figure 4B).
Administration of B. rodentium to gnotobiotic mice receiving
ASF mildly, but statistically significantly, attenuated tumor
growth relative to mice treated with ASF alone (Fig. 4e). Notably,
tumor growth inhibition seen following administration of B.
rodentium was also accompanied by enhanced tumor infiltration
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and cytokine production (Fig. 4f),
confirming activation of antitumor immunity by specific gut

 microbiota. Overall, these findings establish the critical role of the
select gut microbiota commensals in the activation of antitumor
immunity, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Interestingly, co-
culture of mouse duodenal epithelial cells, MODE-K cells, with B.
rodentium also induced activated components of the TLR
signaling pathway and ER stress signature (Supplementary
Figure 4C), pointing to a feed forward loop mechanism where
IEC not only activate inflammasomes with concomitant impact
on TLR, but can be also affected by select bacterial strains to turn
on UPR or other forms of stress (i.e., oxidative stress17–19).

 Decreased antimicrobial peptides in Rnf5−/− mice. We char-
acterized the inflammatory status of serum and gut epithelial
barrier in Rnf5−/− mice. Elevated serum cytokines were observed
in naive Rnf5−/− mice (Supplementary Figure 5A). Shortening of
villi and increasing crypt depth were observed in the small
intestine in naive Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig-
ure 5B). Notably, co-housing with WT mice abolished villi length
and crypt depth differences, implicating gut microbiota com-
mensals in control of innate immune phenotypes (Supplementary
Figure 5C). Furthermore, the expression pattern of a number of
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), implicated in the regulation of
gut microbiota composition, was markedly reduced in the intes-
tine of Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 5b), Moreover, we observed increased
cell death in organoids prepared from the IEC of tumor-bearing
Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 5c). These data suggest decreased AMPs and
increased cell death might cause intestinal dysbiosis in Rnf5−/−
mice.
RNF5 loss in IEC activates immune cells by CCL5 production.
We next assessed whether IECs from Rnf5−/− mice exhibit a
better capacity to activate immune cells. Rnf5-depleted MODE-K
cells, a mouse intestinal epithelial line also exhibits enhanced
chemokine CCL5 expression (Supplementary Figure 5D). Sig-
nificantly, co-culture of supernatants from cultures of RNF5-
depleted MODE-K cells with murine bone marrow-derived DCs
(BMDCs) enhanced DC activation, seen by elevated MHC I and
MHC II expression (Supplementary Figure 5E). This finding is
consistent with reports identifying the activation of immature DC
by chemokines20. Furthermore, the addition of supernatants from
cultures of RNF5-depleted MODE-K cells to co-cultures of
BMDCs and T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells with their
TCR-specific peptide led to increased T-cell response, as mea-
sured by increased cytokine production (Fig. 5d). Together, these
observations suggest that altered signaling in IEC lacking
RNF5 stimulates DCs and consequently T cells.
Enhanced activity of DCs in the gut of Rnf5−/− mice. We next
asked whether alterations in IECs derived from Rnf5−/− mice
changed immune cell recruitment and activity. We observed a
significant increase in CD11c+ DCs in the small intestine of
Rnf5−/− versus WT mice (Fig. 5e), consistent with previous
reports implicating CD11c+ DCs in triggering enhanced anti-
tumor immune response21,22. Of equal importance, we observed
that both DCs and pDCs were significantly more abundant in
Peyer’s patches (PP) from tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice (Fig. 5f)
than in naive animals (Supplementary Figure 5F). Furthermore,
compared with DCs isolated from the PPs of the WT genotype,
DCs of Rnf5−/− mice produced higher levels of IL-1β in response
to TLR7 stimulation, higher levels of IL-1β, IL-17A, and IL-27 in
response to TLR9 stimulation, and lower levels of IL-10 in
response to both TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation (Supplementary
Figure 5G). Additionally, increased production of CCL5, CCL22,
CXCL1, and CXCL5 chemokines was found in Rnf5−/− PPs DCs
after TLR7 stimulation (Supplementary Figure 5H). The response
of PPs-derived DCs to TLR7 and TLR9 agonists is consistent with
their tissue-specific activity23. These data suggest that DCs from
Peyer’s patches of Rnf5−/− mice better promote the immune
response. Notably, DCs isolated from the gut-associated lym-
phoid tissue (GALT) including PP, mesenteric lymph node
(MLN), and tumor-draining lymph node (TdLN) of tumor-
bearing Rnf5−/− mice induced more T cell cytokine production
compared with DCs isolated from WT tumor-bearing mice
(Fig. 5g). Intestinal dendritic cells were shown to upregulate
CCR7 before migrating out of the intestine to lymphoid tissues
under inflammatory conditions24,25. Likewise, tumor-bearing
Rnf5−/− mice had enhanced frequency of CCR7+ DCs isolated
from GALT and of CCR7+ mDCs isolated from MLN, compared
with those isolated from the WT tumor-bearing mice (Supple-
mentary Figure 5I). This data suggest that a higher fraction of
migratory intestinal DCs are present in tumor-bearing Rnf5−/−
mice. In addition, CD103+ DCs are implicated in the transport of
intact antigens to the TdLN, thus priming CD8+ T cells26. An
increase in CD103+ DCs was observed in TdLN, but not in non-
draining lymph node (ndLN) of Rnf5−/− mice (Supplementary
Figure 5J). This data suggest that a higher fraction of migratory
TdLN DCs are present in tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice. These
data indicate that DCs in the gut of Rnf5−/− mice are quantita-
tively and functionally induced, underlying the stronger activa-
tion of the immune response seen in these mice. In all, these data
establish that RNF5 plays an important role in control of
intestinal
DC
recruitment
and,
consistent
with
previous
reports27,28, the recruitment of DCs underlies T-cell activation
and antitumor immunity.
Reduced UPR coincides with altered microbiota and immu-
nity. Given that RNF5 functions in the ER stress and ERAD
pathways29,30, we analyzed expression of ER-stress markers and
related UPR pathways. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated RNF5 deletion in
mouse melanoma cells markedly reduced ER-stress-mediated
activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) as seen by the
level of sXBP1, key UPR components (Supplementary Figure 6A,
B). To determine whether altered UPR signaling also occurs in
IECs, we inhibited RNF5 expression (shRNF5) in MODE-K cells
and then treated them with thapsigargin (TG). Reduced expres-
sion of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and sXBP1 as well as
XBP1 target genes including endoplasmic reticulum-localized
DnaJ4 (ERdj4)31 and triglyceride biosynthetic genes32, was seen
in RNF5-depleted compared with expressing cells (Fig. 6a; Sup-
plementary Figure 6C). Notably, IECs isolated from Rnf5−/−
mice also exhibited markedly reduced XBP1 and target gene
mRNA levels (Fig. 6b). Similarly, a significant reduction in
expression of key UPR components, including sXBP1, was
observed following ER stress stimuli in Rnf5−/− bone marrow-
derived macrophages (BMMs) (Supplementary Figure 6D).
Additionally, no obvious change was identified in the STING
signaling pathway in a number of cell types, including BMMs,
BMDCs (Supplementary Figure 6E, F). Of note, the reduction in
UPR signaling components was accompanied by increased
expression of ER-stress markers in the intestine, including the key
chaperone-binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) (Fig. 6c),
suggesting that specific deregulation of UPR pathways (i.e.,
through IRE1α/sXBP1) can be partially compensated for by
induced expression of other UPR pathway components (such as
ATF6/BiP), consistent with previous reports33,34. Notably, the
elevated BiP and CHOP expression seen in IECs was attenuated
when Rnf5−/− mice were co-housed with WT mice (Fig. 6d),
further pointing to the effect of gut microbiota composition on
UPR signaling.
To directly assess whether changes in UPR are able to trigger
changes in immune response components, we treated MODE-K
cells with IRE1α inhibitor (MKC-448535). Administration of MKC-
4485 caused inhibition of sXBP1 expression (Fig. 6e), and
supernatant from these MODE-K cells was capable of activating
DC (Fig. 6f), resembling those observed in MODE-K cells that were
subjected to shRNF5. These results provide important support for
the role of reduced IRE1α activity in the activation of DC and
T cells, underlying the antitumor immunity seen in Rnf5−/− mice.
Moreover, the expression pattern of several antimicrobial
peptides,

data support the notion that altered UPR in Rnf5−/− mice induce
changes in both the gut microbiome and immune response.
Reduced UPR in patients that respond to immunotherapy. We
next set to determine whether altered expression of UPR
components can be also found in murine melanomas and patients
that responded to immune checkpoint therapy. First, the
expression of ER stress markers was assessed in murine mela-
nomas collected following treatment with isotype or anti-CTLA4
antibodies. Notably, responders to anti-CTLA4 treatment exhibit
reduced expression of sXBP1 and ATF4 (Figure S7A). Reduced

 to anti-CTLA4 treatment, compared with the isotype group
(Supplementary Figure 7A). Furthermore, inhibition of XBP1 in
mouse melanoma cells also coincided with a better response to
anti-PD-1 treatment (Supplementary Figure 7B). Next, we ana-
lyzed the expression of ER stress marker genes in samples col-
lected from melanoma patients in two independent cohorts
(MGH and Zurich), prior to immune checkpoint therapy. Sig-
nificantly, reduced expression of sXBP1, ATF4, and BiP mRNA
levels was observed in responders to immune checkpoint therapy,
compared with non-responders in both cohorts (Fig. 7a, b).
Notably, further assessment of the MGH cohort revealed that
patients with low sXBP1 expression exhibited a significant
progression-free
survival
(median
progression-free
survival:
555 days vs. 103 days, p = 0.021, Fig. 7c), when compared with
melanoma patients with high sXBP1 levels in the pre-treatment
tumor
specimens.
Similarly,
Kaplan–Meier
survival
curves
revealed that low ATF4 expression levels was associated with a
better progression-free survival (Fig. 7d). In a third independent
cohort, biopsies of 21 patients who received Nivolumab/Pem-
brolizumab at Rambam Health Care Campus, with no prior or
concurrent systemic therapy, were analyzed. In this cohort, low
expression of BiP also correlated with good response to immu-
notherapy, whereas high BIP levels were found only in non-
responders (p < 0.05). Notably, several biopsies taken at different
time points from the same patient exhibited a consistent level of
BiP expression (Fig. 7e, f). Patients with low BiP expression
(< 25% of melanoma cells) prior to treatment exhibited a sig-
nificantly better overall survival (median overall survival: high
BiP group, 8 months; low BiP group, mostly alive, p = 0.008,
Fig. 7g) and >5-fold increase in disease-free survival (median
progression-free survival: 23 months vs. 4 months, p = 0.021,
Fig. 7h) when compared with melanoma patients that had high
BiP levels (>25% of melanoma cells). Furthermore, we analyzed
BiP expression in paired biopsies obtained from patients prior to
immune checkpoint therapy (pre-treatment), during treatment
(on-treatment), and after the completion of immune checkpoint
therapy (post-treatment). BiP expression was notably lower in 3
of 5 on- and post-treatment tumor biopsies, compared with the
paired pre-treatment tumor biopsies (Fig. 7i). While in line with
the finding in Rnf5−/− mice, these findings suggest a relationship
between ER stress markers and response to immunotherapy,
thereby indicating the possible use of reduced sXBP1 and BiP
expression as markers for melanoma patients responsiveness to
immunotherapy.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate that altered UPR signaling coincides with
alteration of gut microbiota and activation of antitumor immu-
nity. Cooperation and likely cross-talk between these two major
components is expected to enable efficient tumor growth inhi-
bition, exemplified in the Rnf5−/− mice. Evidence for the activity
of both gut microbiota and immune response components in
limiting tumor growth comes from several observations. First,
bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that antitumor
immune cell phenotypes seen in Rnf5−/− mice were evident only
when bone marrow was transferred to Rnf5−/− and not WT mice,
confirming the role of a non-hematopoietic components that we
subsequently identified as the altered microbiota composition.
Notwithstanding, selective inactivation of RNF5 in specific cell
types, (i.e., IEC), is expected to enable further mapping of
mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Second, fecal transfer
or administration of specific bacterial strains from Rnf5−/− to
WT GF mice recapitulated antitumor immunity phenotypes,
supporting the impact of the microbiome on these outcomes.
Third, Rnf5−/− mice exhibit intrinsic inflammation, reflected by
elevated serum cytokine levels, reduced intestinal villi length,
increased crypt depth, and IECs cell death. Moreover, the
expression pattern of a number of AMPs, implicated in the reg-
ulation of gut microbiota composition, was markedly reduced in
Rnf5−/− mice. These changes are expected to contribute to
intestinal dysbiosis in Rnf5−/− mice. Finally, deregulation of the
IRE1/sXBP signaling pathway in IECs of Rnf5−/− mice have
altered DC and T-cell activation and AMPs expression.
We show that lack of RNF5, or inhibition of IRE1α or sXBP1,
in intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient to increase CCL5 pro-
duction, impacting DC recruitment and activation of T cells.
Concomitant with the increased inflammasome and immune cell
activation are changes in the expression of a repertoire of AMPs,
implicated in defining the microbiota landscape, seen upon KD of
RNF5 in MODE-K cells and in IEC isolated from Rnf5−/− mice.
Changes seen in IEC may underlie host-based mechanism, which
defines the landscape of bacterial commensals and also trigger
antitumor immunity. Notably, our findings suggest that changes
in both microbiota and the immune system are required to
achieve effective antitumor immunity to limit melanoma growth.
Co-housing experiments and bacterial feeding to GF C57BL/6
mice and ASF-bearing C3H/HeN mice studies reveal the primary
role of gut microbiota in defining the antitumor immunity phe-
notype. Enhanced DC number and activity were identified in the
gut of Rnf5−/− mice, reflected in (i) increased CD11c+ DCs seen
in the
PP of tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice, (ii) production of
more cytokines and chemokines, (iii) greater induction of T cell
cytokines by DCs from GALTs of tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice,
and (iv) enhanced frequency of CCR7+ DCs and mDCs in
GALTs of tumor-bearing Rnf5−/− mice, which coincides with
greater migration properties. In a recent study36, we identified a
significant increase in the frequency of total colonic DCs in
colonic lamina propria cells from naive Rnf5−/− mice compared
with the WT genotype. Notwithstanding, our findings are in line
with previous reports implicating altered UPR signaling in
enhanced innate immunity associated with colitis and related
inflammatory disorders37,38. IRE1α/β has also been implicated in
regulating gut microbiota and determining colitis susceptibility37.
Our ability to identify a select subset of bacterial strains that are
enriched in the Rnf5−/− mice, which can elicit antitumor
immunity and tumor growth inhibition when administered to GF
WT mice, establish the importance of specific commensals in
tumor growth control. The finding that commensal B. rodentium
enhances antitumor immunity in vivo is consistent with effects
reported for related family members (i.e., B. fragilis, B. thetaio-
taomicron) ability to activate the immune system4.
Noteworthy, Rnf5−/− mice exhibit basal intestinal inflamma-
tion, which develops into acute colitis following DSS adminis-
tration36. S100A8, which was identified as a RNF5 substrate
capable of mediating the acute colitis phenotype, and adminis-
tration of neutralizing S100A8 antibodies blocked the colitis
phenotypes36. While STING was previously reported to be a
RNF5 substrate9, we did not observe RNF5-dependent changes in
STING stability or STING-related signaling, consistent with the
possibility that the regulation of STING may be mediated by
other ubiquitin ligases39–42.
Reduced expression of sXBP1 and BIP was observed in human
patient data—specifically in responders to immune checkpoint
therapy, compared with non-responders, an observation that was
made in different independent cohorts. Likewise, samples from
a mouse melanoma model exhibit reduced UPR in those that
responded to anti-CTLA4 therapy. Yet, while intestines of
Rnf5−/− mice also exhibited reduced sXBP1, they showed ele-
vated BiP expression. These differences may well correspond to
the tissue type examined, the time in which the analysis was
performed (Rnf5−/−
mouse tumor samples were collected

 2–3 weeks after tumor inoculation, whereas human tumor sam-
ples were obtained at different stages of their development, or
following therapy) or exposure of human tumors microenviron-
mental factors not present in the Rnf5−/− mice.
Overall, altered IEC immunogenicity and expression of anti-
microbial peptides are expected to impact DC cell activation and
microbiota composition, which together are expected to define the
antitumor immunity and tumor growth inhibition, as seen in the
Rnf5−/− mice. Reduced UPR component expression was also seen
in murine melanoma tumors that responded to CTLA4 therapy, and
significantly, in patients that responded to immune checkpoint
therapy, thus pointing the possible use of UPR components, sXBP1,
ATF4, and BiP, as markers to stratify patients for these therapies.
Our data also suggest that selected bacterial commensals associated
with altered UPR signaling identified in the Rnf5−/− mice could
provide a novel approach to enhance antitumor activity. Conse-
quently, defining the crosstalk between the UPR, gut microbiota,
and immune checkpoint activity has significant potential expected
to advance the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Methods
Animals and tumor model. All experimental animal procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sanford Burnham Prebys
Medical Discovery Institute (approval # 13–130, 16–028, and 17–001) and com-
plied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research. WT and
Rnf5−/− (originally generated in ref. 43) were generated from common Rnf5+/−
heterozygous, which were obtained from at least 10 generations backcross to WT
C57BL/6 mice and were bred in house for several generations. All experiments used
littermate controls, or their immediate descendants. MyD88−/− mice were obtained
with permission as gift from Dr. Shizuo Akira44. Rnf5−/− and MyD88−/− (C57BL/
6) were crossed to generate MyD88+/−Rnf5+/− heterozygous, and MyD88−/−
Rnf5−/− double-knockout mice were generated from MyD88+/−Rnf5+/− hetero-
zygous. In total, 6–14-week-old mice were used for all experiments12. Germ-free
C57BL/6 mice and ASF-bearing C3H/HeN mice were bred and maintained at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility under gnoto-
biotic conditions in flexible film isolators. Experiments involving GF and gnoto-
biotic mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at UNL (protocol #1534). All mice were fed an autoclaved chow diet ad
libitum (LabDiet 5K67, Purina Foods). Germ-free status was routinely checked as
previously described45. Briefly, fresh feces were collected and analyzed by bacterial
16S rRNA gene-specific PCR (30 cycles, universal bacteria primers 8F and
1391R)46 in combination with aerobic and anaerobic culture of feces in Brain Heart
Infusion, Wilkins-Chalgren and Yeast Mold broths, and on Tryptic Soy Agar plates
(all media from Difco™ Becton Dickinson) at 37 °C for 7 days. ASF colonization
status was verified by qPCR analysis of fecal samples as previously published45.
Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples and ASF bacteria were
quantified by qPCR with species-specific primers. Mouse selection for experiments
was not formally randomized or blinded. For tumor growth experiments, mice
were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1 × 106 tumor cells. Tumor size was
measured twice a week for calculation of tumor volume. Tumors were weighed at
the time of excision.
Cell lines and gene silencing. Mouse melanoma cell lines used in this study
include YUMM1.5, YUMM1.3, YUMM1.7, YUMM1.9 (Marcus Bosenberg, Yale
University)12, B16F10 (ATCC), and B2905 (Glenn Merlino, NCI), and the mouse
intestinal epithelial cell line MODE-K (Richard Blumberg Harvard Medical
School), were cultured in the DMEM containing 10% FBS. All cell lines were free of
mycoplasma and were authenticated. Cells were transfected with shRNAs using
jetPRIME (PolyPlus). The RNAi Consortium lentiviral pLKO.1 control vector
served as the shControl. The shRNAs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Len-
tiviral particles were prepared using standard protocols. Briefly, shRNA plasmid
and the second generation of packaging plasmids delta R8.2 and VSV-G (Addgene)
were transfected into HEK293T cells. Viral supernatants were collected after 48 h of
culture and used with polybrene (Sigma) for infection of indicated cell line.
Quantitative real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Fecal
samples were weighed and bacterial DNA was extracted using the QIAmp Fast
DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). The abundance of specific bacterial genes was
amplified by qPCR with genera-specific 16S rRNA gene primers (Supplementary
Table 6). The qPCR program started with an initial step at 95 °C for 5 min, fol-
lowed by 35 cycles of 30S at 95 °C and 45S at 55 °C. The qPCRs were done using
SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad). Bacterial numbers were determined using stan-
dard curves with reference bacteria E. coli (ATCC). Standard curves were generated
by qPCR using V3 primer pairs together with undiluted and a 10-fold dilution
series of genomic template. The Ct values of each dilution were used to generate a
standard curve of absolute abundance. qPCR measures the number of 16S rRNA
gene copies per sample, not actual bacterial numbers.
Bacterial strains and culture. The closest available bacterial strains matching
those observed in Rnf5−/− mice were identified. The 12 strains selected for
administration as a cocktail in GF mice are shown in Supplementary Table 2.
Lyophilized bacteria were resuspended and cultured anaerobically in the respective
media formulations suggested by the vendors. Equal concentrations of each species,
as measured by OD600, were pooled to make the bacterial cocktail. The Altered
Schaedler Flora consisted of the following eight isolates: ASF 356, Clostridium sp.;
ASF 360, Lactobacillus intestinalis; ASF 361, Lactobacillus murinus; ASF 457,
Mucispirillum schaedleri; ASF 492, Eubacterium plexicaudatum; ASF 500, Pseu-
doflavonifractor sp.; ASF 502, Clostridium sp.; and ASF 519, Parabacteroides
goldsteinii.
Bacterial administration to germ-free mice. A cocktail of the bacterial species
listed in Supplementary Table 2 or B. rodentium alone, was resuspended in PBS
and administered via two oral gavages 1 day apart. Two weeks before tumor
inoculation, each mouse was given 100 µl containing either a bacterial cocktail of
1.13 × 107 organisms or 2.25 × 107 B. rodentium alone along with 100 µl of cecal
contents from ASF-bearing mice prepared as previously described. ASF cecal
contents were harvested from ASF-bearing mice after euthanasia and homogenized
in sterile 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and
magnesium, pH 7 (Corning Cellgro, Manassas, VA) at a ratio of 1-g cecal contents
per 10 mL of 10% glycerol in PBS under rigorous vortexing. Inoculations were
performed under sterile aerobic conditions in a biosafety cabinet.
Bacterial DNA extraction and 16S library preparation. Mouse microbiota dis-
plays a stable homeostatic state when they are around 8 weeks47. In following this
protocol, we did not collect microbiota earlier than 8 weeks. Mouse fecal pellets
were frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Bacterial DNA was extracted using
the QIAmp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). To ensure efficient cell lysis, a
5-min bead-beating step using a Mini-Beadbeater-16 was included (Biospec Pro-
ducts, OK, USA). Library preparation for the Illumina MiSeq platform was per-
formed by amplification of the V3–V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA
gene using Forward primer: 5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGA-
GACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GTCTCGTGG
GCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′.
Adapter and barcode sequences for dual indices were used as described by Illu-
mina. PCR clean up steps were performed with QIAquick 96-PCR Clean up kit
(Qiagen, Germany), and library quantification was performed using a KAPA
Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms (KAPA Biosystems, MA, USA).
An Experion Automated Gel Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) was used
to measure the DNA concentration and purity of the pooled libraries. The 16S
libraries were sequenced at the Analytical Genomics Core of Sanford Burham
Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (Lake Nona, FL, USA) and Beijing Genomics
Institute (Beijing, China).
16S sequencing data processing. The original FASTQ files from Illumina 250
basepair paired-end sequencing of the 120 samples (30 mice per group) were
processed using a novel 16S amplicon sequencing pipeline HiMap (http://github.
com/taolonglab/himap; bioRxiv 565572). The output of HiMap is Operational
Strain Unit (OSU) which contains one or more bacterial strains that best match the
16S sequence and can not be further distinguished by it. The percentage similarity
between the 16S sequence and the aligned region of 16S rRNA genes of the strains
in the OSU is indicated. OSUs mapped to the same strains are grouped together
(adding read counts), if the percentage similarities are within 2%. Read counts are
converted into relative abundance as described in HiMap. Log10-transformed
relative abundances were used for comparisons between samples under different
experimental conditions.
Taxa selection. Taxa that distinguished Rnf5−/− mice microbiota from WT mice
were selected as the overlap of the following three sets: (1) for each time point at
day 0 (before tumor injection) and at day 24 (before tumor collection), Welch two-
tailed t test was performed on the log10-transformed relative abundances of all
OSU groups at the specified time point, and p-values were adjusted with
Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. OSU groups with
adjusted p-value < 0.05 at both day 0 and day 24 were selected in this first set; (2)
Wilcox rank-sum test was performed on relative abundances of all OSU groups at
day 0 and day 24. OSU groups with adjusted p-value less than 0.05 at both day 0
and day 24 were selected in the second set; (3) the third set of OSU groups were
selected by calculating spearman correlation between each of the OSU groups and
tumor size at day 24 and keeping OSU groups with adjusted p-value <0.05. Initial
OSU groups used in the above three tests are the ones with median relative
abundance greater than 10−4 in at least one of the four groups: WT at day 0,
Rnf5−/− at day 0, WT at day 24, and Rnf5−/− at day 24. The final set consists of 38
OSU groups that distinguished Rnf5−/− mice microbiota from WT mice (Sup-
plementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 3C, D).

 In vivo antibody treatments. CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted by intra-
peritoneal (i.p.) injection of 200 μg of anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5), anti-CD8 (clone
53–6.7), rat IgG2b isotype control, or rat IgG2a isotype control on days 0, 3, 6, 11,
and 16 following tumor inoculation. The efficacy of depletion was confirmed by
FACS analysis of blood samples. For anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 antibody treat-
ment, mice were injected i.p. with 200 μg of anti-PD-1 (clone RMP1–14), anti-
CTLA-4 (clone 9H10), Syrian hamster IgG isotype control (clone SHG-1), or rat
IgG2a isotype control on days 7, 10, 13, and 16 after tumor inoculation. All mAbs
for in vivo use were GoInVivo™ grade from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA).
Mouse melanoma model subjected to anti-CTLA4 treatment. B2905 cells
generated in Glenn Merlino Laborartory (NCI) were derived from a UV-induced
melanoma in Hgf-tg mouse. Cells (1 × 106) were subcutaneously implanted in the
right flank of C57BL/6 mice. When tumors reached 75 mm3 in average, mice were
randomized and anti-CTLA-4 (BioXCell, BE0164) or isotype control (BioXcell,
BE0086) antibodies were administered i.v (final dose of 10 mg/kg). Treatment was
done twice per week for four doses. Tumors were measured twice per week and
collected 39 days post implantation when growth kinetics distinguished “respon-
ders” and “non-responders” to anti-CTLA-4.
Bone marrow chimeras. WT or Rnf5−/− recipient mice were lethally irradiated
(1000 rads) and reconstituted by intravenous (i.v.) injection of 1 × 107 bone
marrow (BM) cells isolated from the femurs and tibias of donor WT or Rnf5−/−
mice. The recipient mice were treated with antibiotics (trimethoprim 8 mg/ml and
sulfamethoxazole 40 mg/ml in the drinking water) for 3 weeks after injection.
Reconstitution was confirmed 6–8 weeks after BM transfer, and the chimeric mice
were then injected subcutaneously with 1 × 106 YUMM1.5 melanoma cells.
Tumor digestion. Tumors were excised, minced, and digested with 1 mg/ml col-
lagenase D (Roche) and 100 µg/ml DNase I (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. Digests were
then passed through a 70-μm cell strainer to generate a single-cell suspension. The
cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA, and then stained for
flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry. Tumor-derived single-cell suspensions were washed twice with
FACS staining buffer, fixed for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde in PBS, washed twice,
and resuspended in FACS staining buffer.
For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were resuspended in complete RPMI-
1640 (containing 10 mM HEPES, 1% nonessential amino acids and L-glutamine, 1
mM sodium pyruvate, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and
antibiotics) supplemented with 50 U/mL IL-2 (NCI), 1 mg/mL brefeldin A (BFA,
Sigma), and incubated with phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin
(0.5 μg/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized using a
Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences) before staining.
Antibodies to the following proteins were obtained: CD45.2 (104), CD8α
(53–6.7), CD4 (GK1.5), CD44 (IM7), PD-1 (RMP1–30), LAG-3 (C9B7W), TIM-3
(RMT3–23), CD45.1 (A20), TNF-α (MP6-XT22), IFN-γ (XMG1.2), CD11c
(N418), CD11b (M1/70), MHC class II (M5/114.15.2), CD86 (GL1), CD40 (1C10),
CD80 (16–10A1), PDCA (129c1), and B220 (RA3–6B2) were from BioLegend;
antibodies to IL-2 (JES6–5H4) and MHC class I (AF6–88.5.5.3) were from
eBioscience. All data were collected on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) and
analyzed using FlowJo Software (Tree Star). Gating strategies for immune cells
analysis and cell sorting were provided in Supplementary Figure 8A–E.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Immediately after killing, the entire gas-
trointestinal tract was removed from the mice, split open lengthwise, rinsed, and
rolled up from the proximal to distal end to form a “Swiss roll.” The tissues were
fixed in 4% formalin overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and embedded in par-
affin. The embedded samples were sliced into 5-μm-thick sections and stained with
H&E. For quantitative analysis, the villi length and the crypt depth were scored for
each section. The score distributions between experimental groups were compared
using proportional odds logistic regression using R software.
For immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
washed in PBS, subjected to antigen retrieval using Dako target retrieval solution,
and incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to quench endogenous
peroxidase activity. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an
antibody to BiP (C50B12, Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:100 and BiP
(ab21685, abcam) dilute 1:200 in Dako antibody diluent. Slides were then washed
three times with PBS/Tween-20, incubated with Dako Labeled Polymer-HRP for 1
h at room temperature, washed again with PBS/Tween-20, developed with DAB,
Bajoran Purple chromogen kit (BioCare) and with simple stain AEC solution
(Histofine) and counterstained with hematoxylin. For mouse tissues, BiP staining
was scored using a four tier intensity scale from 0 to 3 (low to high intensity)
multiplied by the percentage of positively stained cells to generate an H score
(maximum score of 300). For human melanoma tissues, specimens were scored as
IHC 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, if negative, ≥1% but <25%, ≥25% but <50%, ≥50% but <75%, or
≥75% of cells were BiP positive, respectively. All stained tissues were blindly
evaluated by pathologists.
Antibiotic treatments. Mice were treated for 2 weeks before tumor inoculation
with ampicillin (1 mg/ml), neomycin (1 mg/ml), vancomycin (0.5 mg/ml), and
metronidazole (1 mg/ml) (all Sigma-Aldrich) added to sterile drinking water.
Solutions and bottles were changed 2–3 times per week.
Western blotting. Cells were washed once with PBS at room temperature and
resuspended in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors). Lysates were
sonicated on ice with a Microtip sonicator, centrifuged, and the supernatants were
removed and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Osmonics Inc., MN, USA). Membranes were blocked and incubated
with the respective primary antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies. The blots were imaged with an Odyssey detection system
(Amersham Bioscience, NJ, USA). All uncropped blots are shown in Supplemen-
tary Figure 9.
Antibodies and chemicals. The anti-RNF5 antibody was described previously48.
Antibodies to IREα (3294) and sXBP1 (12782) were from Cell Signaling Tech-
nology, and antibodies to pIREα (ab48187) and XBP1 (ab28715) were from
Abcam. Brefeldin A (BFA) and thapsigargin (TG) were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich. IRE1 inhibitor (MKC-4485) was kindly provided by Dr. John Patterson.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages. Mice were euthanized with CO2, the femurs
were removed, and the BM cells were harvested and washed. For macrophage
differentiation, BM cells were resuspended in the RPMI-1640 medium containing
10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine and placed in Petri
dishes. The supernatant from L929 cells (a source of macrophage-colony stimu-
lating factor, M-CSF) was added at 30% (vol/vol), and the cells were incubated for
7 days. Differentiated macrophages were then harvested and used in the
experiments.
MODE-K cells stimulation with B. rodentium. MODEK-K cells were harvested,
washed, and stimulated for 4 h with the growth medium alone or with medium
containing rehydrated B. rodentium at a final ratio of 1:10 MODE-K cells to
bacterial cells.
BMDC activation and in vitro CD8+ T cell stimulation assay. To prepare
conditioned media, MODE-K-EV or MODE-K-shRNF5 cells were incubated in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C to allow cell attachment. The
cells were then treated with medium or MKC-4485 for 48 h in advanced DMEM
(Thermo Fisher) containing 2 mM L-glutamine without serum. The medium was
then collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular
debris. The resulting conditioned medium was used for treatment of BMDCs.
BM cells were isolated from the tibiae and femurs of WT C57BL/6 mice and
cultured in the DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
and recombinant mouse GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; BioLegend) for 8 days at 37 °C.
BMDCs were incubated for 24 h with the MODE-K conditioned medium (20% v/v)
prepared as described above. OT-1 or P14 CD8+ T cells were incubated with 5 μM
CFSE for 10 min at 37 °C and washed. Cells were then mixed 1:1 with the BMDCs
and incubated for 72 h pulsed with 2 μg/ml of OVA peptide (SINFEKL)
(AnaSpec) or GP33 peptide (AnaSpec). T-cell proliferation was monitored by CFSE
dilution using flow cytometry and the division index (a measure of the average
number of divisions which includes the undivided cells) was determined using
FlowJo software (Tree Star). For intracellular cytokine staining, the cells were fixed,
permeabilized with Cytofix/ Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), and stained with anti-
TNF-α and anti-IFN-γ.
Patient samples. Patients with melanoma provided written informed consent for
the collection of tissue and blood samples for research and genomic profiling, as
approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board
(DF/HCC Protocol 11–181), and the Kantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich
(EK.647/800 & ZH.Nr.2014–0425) and Rambam Health Care Campus Institutional
Review Board (RMB-0634–16131539). Fresh primary tumor specimens were
obtained from patients prior to immunotherapy administration (see Supplemen-
tary Tables 3–5). Formalin-fixed tissue was analyzed to confirm that viable tumor
was present via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and was used for immu-
nohistochemical analysis and purification of RNA. Additional fresh tissue was
processed immediately for purification of RNA. Of the MGH/Dana-Farber Cancer
Center cohort, 36 of the 40 patients received immunotherapy for metastatic stage
IV melanoma, 4 patients were given adjuvant therapy after definitive surgical
resection. All patients classified as responders (R) showed clear radiographic
decrease in disease and maintained an ongoing response without progression
through to last follow-up. Patients classified as nonresponders (NR) did not
respond to treatment radiographically and/or had clear and rapid progression. In
the case of the five patients who received adjuvant therapy, R was defined as lack of
post-treatment recurrence through to last follow-up. From the Zurich hospital
cohort of 25 patients, all received immunotherapy for metastatic stage IV mela-
noma. All patients classified as R showed a reduction of tumor lesions within the

 first 12 weeks of treatment; whereas, NR had no measureable response to treatment
at the first clinical end-point (12 weeks), as in Krieg et al.49. From the Rambam
Health Care Center a cohort of 21 patients, all with metastatic melanoma received
anti-PD-1 immunotherapy as a single agent, first-line systemic therapy was
included in the study. In eight patients, more than one biopsy was examined.
Response was assessed by a board certified oncologist (G.BS) who was blinded to
the immunohistochemical results. All patients classified as responders (R) showed
radiographic decrease of disease and maintained an ongoing response without
progression through to last follow-up. Patients classified as nonresponders (NR)
did not respond to treatment radiographically and/or had clear and rapid pro-
gression. For survival evaluation, the medical files of the patients were reviewed and
tumor assessmemts were conducted according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, before treatment and then every 11–14 weeks
until disease progression or death.
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analyses. The total RNA was extracted from
mouse tumor samples individually using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Midi kit
(QIAGEN), cells using GenElute (Sigma-Aldrich) or formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) patient samples using GenEluteTM (Sigma-Aldrich) FFPE RNA
purification kit. Fresh patient tumor samples were homogenized and disrupted
using a mortar and pestle followed by use of a QIAshredder. A QIAcube was used
to harvest RNA from patient biopsies using the RNeasy Mini Protocol (Qiagen).
The total RNA was reverse transcribed using high Capacity Reverse Transcriptase
kits (Invitrogen) or the Superscript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen)
according to the protocol by the manufacturer. Purity and concentration of
extracted RNAs were checked and quantified by reading at 260 and 280 nm in a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher).
The qRT-PCR analyses were performed using Syber Green RT-PCR kits
(Invitrogen) on a Bio-Rad CFX Connect Real-Time system or Roche LightCycler.
Expression levels normalized to 18S or Tubb5 controls. Sequence-specific primers
used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table 6.
RNF5 gene deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. RNF5-deficient cells were
created using the CRISPR/Cas9 system50. A transient strategy was used to avoid
nonspecific effects due to stable Cas9/sgRNA genome integration. YUMM1.7 cells
were transiently transfected with a Cas9 and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression
plasmid encoding GFP (Addgene plasmid #44719). The guide sequence was designed
using the Optimized CRISPR Design at http://crispr.mit.edu: 5′-CGCTCGCGATTT
GGCCCTTC-3′. After transfection, GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS, cloned,
and screened for Rnf5 deletion by immunoblot analysis. Independent knockout clones
and the control parental cells were analyzed as indicated.
Isolation of intestinal epithelial cells. A 10 -cm section of mouse small intestine
was opened longitudinally, minced, washed in 150 mM NaCl containing 1 mM
DTT, and then resuspended in dissociation buffer (130 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA,
10 mM Hepes [pH 7.4], 10% FCS, and 1 mM DTT). The sections were incubated at
37 °C for 30 min with vigorous shaking to release the epithelial cells from the
lamina propria. The epithelial cell suspension was then carefully aspirated, cen-
trifuged, and washed in ice-cold PBS.
Serum cytokine and chemokine detection. Cytokines and chemokines in the sera
of tumor-bearing WT and Rnf5−/− mice were quantified using the LEGEN-
DplexTM mouse inflammation panel and mouse proinflammatory chemokine
panel (BioLegend), respectively. All data were collected on an LSRFortessa (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed using LEGENDplexTM software (BioLegend).
NanoString nCounter assay. For each NanoString assay, an aliquot of 100 ng
RNA was mixed with a NanoString code set mix and incubated at 65 °C overnight
(16 h). The reaction mixes were loaded onto the NanoString nCounter Prep Station
for binding and washing, and the resulting cartridge was transferred to the
NanoString nCounter digital analyzer for scanning and data collection. Quantified
expression data were analyzed using NanoString nSolver Analysis Software v2.0.
After performing image quality control using a predefined cutoff value, we
excluded the outlier samples using a normalized factor based on the sum of positive
control counts greater than threefold. Data were normalized by scaling with the
geometric mean of the built-in control gene probes for each sample.
Bioinformatics analysis of the NanoString nCounter assay. For gene expression
data from the NanoString nCounter assay, filtering of samples using quality control
criteria was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Raw
counts of samples passing quality control were normalized using 20 reference genes
as internal controls (Abcf1, Alas1, Edc3, Eef1g, Eif2b4, G6pdx, Gusb, Hdac3, Hprt,
Nubp1, Oaz1, Polr1b, Polr2a, Ppia, Rpl19, Sap130, Sdha, Sf3a3, Tbp, and Tubb5).
Data were log2-transformed and used for further analysis. Student’s t test was
applied to compare normalized expression values between groups. Ingenuity
pathway analysis was used to interpret data in the context of biological processes,
pathways, and networks.
In vivo OT-1 T-cell proliferation assay. CD8+ T cells were isolated from the
spleens of naive OT-1 CD45.1+ mice, labeled with CFSE, and injected i.v. into
CD45.2+ WT or Rnf5−/− mice (C57BL/6 background). After 24 h, the mice were
injected s.c. with 1 × 106 B16-OVA melanoma cells and the mice were left for
7 days. The spleen, tumor-draining lymph nodes, and non-draining lymph nodes
were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. The proliferation of OT-1 CD8+
T cells was assessed by analysis of CFSE dilution within the population of gated
CD45.1+ CD8+ T cells.
Small intestine organoid culture. For small intestine organoid culture, crypt
number was counted after isolation from tumor-bearing mice. A total of 500 crypts
were mixed with 50 µl of Matrigel and 500 μl of organoid culture medium
(Advanced DMEM/F12 containing 10 mM HEPES, 1× Glutamax, 1×
N2 supplement, 1× B27 supplement, 50 ng/ml EGF, 1000 ng/ml R-spondin1, and
100 ng/ml Noggin).
Statistical analysis. Unless otherwise noted, all data are shown as the mean ± s.e.
m. Before statistical analysis, data were subjected to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
to determine distribution. Variance similarity was tested using an F test for two
groups and Bartlett’s test for multiple groups. Two groups were compared using
the two-tailed t test for parametric data or the Mann–Whitney U test for non-
parametric data. Multiple groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s, Dunnett’s, or Bonferroni’s correction for parametric data or using the
Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for non-parametric data. Tumor
growth curves were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s, Tukey’s, or
Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons. Kaplan–Meier estimates and the
log-rank test were used to analyze statistical differences in overall and progression-
free survival between melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy, whose pre-
treatment tumor biopsies showed low versus high melanoma cell expression of BiP.
