Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease
affecting the central nervous system. It is characterized by auto-
reactive T cells that induce demyelination and neuronal degradation.
Treatment options are still limited and several MS medications need
to be administered by parenteral application but are modestly
effective. Oral active drugs such as fingolimod have been weighed
down by safety concerns. Consequently, there is a demand for
novel, especially orally active therapeutics. Nature offers an abun-
dance of compounds for drug discovery. Recently, the circular plant
peptide kalata B1 was shown to silence T-cell proliferation in vitro in
an IL-2–dependent mechanism. Owing to this promising effect, we
aimed to determine in vivo activity of the cyclotide [T20K]kalata B1
using the MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalo-
myelitis (EAE). Treatment of mice with the cyclotide resulted in a
significant delay and diminished symptoms of EAE by oral adminis-
tration. Cyclotide application substantially impeded disease progres-
sion and did not exhibit adverse effects. Inhibition of lymphocyte
proliferation and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, in
particular IL-2, distinguish the cyclotide from other marketed drugs.
Considering their stable structural topology and oral activity, cyclo-
tides are candidates as peptide therapeutics for pharmaceutical drug
development for treatment of T-cell-mediated disorders.

N
atural products play a pivotal role in modern drug discovery
(1), and they continue to provide innovative lead compounds
currently entering clinical trials (2). The increasing interest for
peptide-based drugs has boosted development of nature-derived
peptides for therapeutic applications (3, 4). Bioactive peptides
exist in all organisms, and physiologically they function as peptide
hormones for cellular signaling, secretory peptides for interspecies
communication, predatory peptide toxins, or antimicrobial host-
defense peptides (5, 6). These molecules have evolved over
millions of years into a structurally sophisticated collection of
compounds to modulate a diverse set of target proteins. One of
the most extensively studied family of bioactive peptides are found
in the venoms of marine cone snails (7). For instance, the
ω-conotoxin MVIIA (8) is a potent blocker of neuronal receptors
and ion channels and was approved for clinical use in 2004
(ziconotide, Prialt) to treat chronic pain (9). However, the
intrathecal application route reduces the attractiveness of this
elsewise promising medication (10, 11), and hence the major
drawbacks of this cone-snail toxin are its inability to cross the
blood–brain barrier, low stability, and lack of oral activity. In fact,
this limits the clinical use of other peptide pharmaceuticals (3).
Recent studies referred to the immunosuppressive effects of
the circular peptide kalata B1 (kB1) on activated human T
lymphocytes in vitro (12, 13). This plant-derived peptide belongs
to the family of cyclotides well-known for their cyclic cystine-
knot topology. This unique 3D fold confers them intrinsic sta-
bility to resist chemical, enzymatic, and thermal degradation (14).
Therefore, cyclotides have become attractive tools in chemical bi-
ology and drug development (15), for instance as templates for
molecular grafting applications (16) as well as for receptor li-
gand design (17), because they presumably exhibit activity fol-
lowing oral administration (18).
Cyclotides, in particular [T20K]kB1, inhibit T-cell proliferation
by down-regulation of IL-2 release as well as IL-2R/CD25 surface
expression (13). The cytokine IL-2 physiologically plays an im-
portant role in T-lymphocyte activation and acts as an autocrine
factor to stimulate T-cell proliferation (19). Enhanced or contin-
uous T-cell activation is a major cause of autoimmune disorders
and can lead to persistent inflammation, causing tissue and organ
damage (20). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common type of
autoimmune disease in young adults, which is characterized by
sustained inflammation of the CNS. Autoreactive T lymphocytes
of the TH17 subset target myelin brain antigens, eliciting inflam-
matory cell influx into the CNS, demyelination, axonal damage,
and neuronal degradation (21, 22). Several therapeutics targeting
different aspects to modulate or suppress T-cell signaling are
available, but the parenteral administration route of many drugs
reduces their attractiveness for chronic treatment (23). Only
three marketed compounds that are specific for MS treatment
are active via oral administration [i.e., dimethyl fumarate, teri-
flunomide, and fingolimod (Gilenya), a sphingosine 1-phospate
Significance
Multiple sclerosis (MS) imposes substantial economic burdens on
patients, their families, and society. Until now, there are few
therapies available, but often unattractive parenteral application
or severe side effects are serious issues. This study highlights the
use of circular peptides as orally active T-cell-specific immuno-
suppressive therapeutics against the MS model experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis, without inducing major adverse
effects. Our work provides a proof of principle that nature-
derived cyclic peptides serve as oral active therapeutics, utilizing
their intrinsic bioactivity and stable three-dimensional structure.
Cyclotides are considered a combinatorial peptide library and
they can be anticipated to complement the existing collections
of natural products that are used in drug discovery.

 receptor ligand]; however, many and severe side effects limit their
therapeutic use (24).
Owing to their remarkable stability and hydrophobic surface
properties, cyclotides are ideally suited for oral administration.
Their immunosuppressive properties have been confirmed on
human T cells. In the present study we demonstrate the effect of
the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 in the state-of-the-art in vivo model for
MS, the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) assay, after oral administration. In particular, we investi-
gated their efficacy to reduce the polarization of pathogenic TH17
cells and the rate of relapse by prophylactic administration of
cyclotides before disease induction. Moreover, we analyzed the
therapeutic application of cyclotides during disease progression,
which potently ameliorated the EAE symptoms. Biodistribution
and systemic uptake of the peptide drugs has been monitored
using the in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and mass spectrometry,
respectively. Our observations suggest cyclotides may be good
candidates as MS therapeutics, without causing any adverse effects
based on preliminary toxicity studies in mice. The results provide
proof of principle for the application of an orally active cyclic
peptide drug in the treatment of autoimmune disorders and could
inspire pharmacological screening as well as preclinical develop-
ment of other peptide-based therapeutics of natural origin (25).
Results
Modulation of T-Cell Proliferation by [T20K]kalata B1. Extensive
screening efforts for the discovery of novel nature-derived drugs
has led to the identification of antiproliferative properties of the
cyclotide kB1 toward human activated lymphocytes in vitro (13).
Recently, structure-activity screening of cyclotides isolated from
the plant Oldenlandia affinis (Rubiaceae) established [T20K]kB1
as an active lead compound to inhibit T-cell proliferation and,
interestingly, replacement of valine to the positively charged ly-
sine in loop 2 resulted in a loss of activity in vitro (13). In the
current work, [T20K]kB1 was synthesized following a modified
protocol for the generation of thioester peptides and subsequent
cyclization by native chemical ligation (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) (26, 27).
To evaluate the immunosuppressive effects of cyclotides in vivo,
the murine T-cell autoimmune-specific EAE was investigated as a
model for human MS. In EAE, autoreactive CD4+ T cells of the
subtype TH17 are the major cause initiating and provoking de-
myelination of the CNS that leads to the typical appearance of
paralysis symptoms (28). As a preliminary experiment, [T20K]kB1
and [V10K]kB1 were incubated at different concentrations with
mouse immune cells ex vivo, which were isolated from spleens of
EAE-induced, viz. myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35–55;
MOG)-immunized mice, to confirm the immunosuppressive ef-
fects previously observed in human T cells (13). The proliferation
of T cells, measured by flow cytometry, as well as the autocrine
acting proliferation-supporting cytokine IL-2 and the TH1 and
TH17 signature cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17A in the supernatant of
MOG-restimulated cells (Fig. S2 A–C), were down-regulated by
[T20K]kB1 in a concentration-dependent fashion; the inactive
control cyclotide [V10K]kB1 had significantly less effect in re-
duction of cytokine secretion. Cyclosporine A, which leads to IL-2
suppression by modulating calcineurin activity (29), was used as a
positive control to confirm the antiproliferative properties of
the cyclotide. Down-regulation of cytokine-related mRNAs
caused by [T20K]kB1 was confirmed by quantitative PCR (Fig.
S2D). Finally, significant antiproliferative effects and a reduction
of inflammatory cytokine release of IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-17A has
been demonstrated by restimulation of splenic T cells isolated
from 2D2 MOG–specific TCR transgenic mice following
cyclotide [T20K]kB1 treatment (Fig. S2E).
Activity and Therapeutic Effects of Cyclotides to Treat EAE. The cyclo-
tide [T20K]kB1 exhibits concentration-dependent immunosup-
pressive activity in vitro, which encouraged the investigation of the
in vivo activity of the circular plant peptide using the T-cell-specific
EAE model. C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG and treated in
advance (day −7) i.p. with [T20K]kB1 (10 mg/kg) demonstrated a
significant delay of the onset and only minor symptoms of the au-
toimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas the inactive mutant or the
untreated control group exhibited no significant effects in disease
reduction; these mice experienced severe bilateral paralysis and
weight loss (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3A, Table S1, and Movie S1). Survival
analysis of EAE experiments, including moribund mice (clinical
score ≥4, see SI Materials and Methods), further supported the
observation that treatment of EAE mice with the cyclotide [T20K]
kB1 exerts long-lasting and protective T-cell antiproliferative
properties (Fig. 2B). Using IVIS, a lower chemiluminescent signal
based on the release of myeloperoxidase by inflammatory cells was
detected in the appropriate regions in cyclotide-treated EAE-in-
duced mice, compared with the untreated control group (Fig. 2C).

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 mice exhibited a significant reduction of IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-17A
levels compared with both the [V10K]kB1-treated and untreated
control group (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, no significant perivascular
infiltration of mononuclear cells and an intact myelin sheath of
the spinal cord of cyclotide-treated mice were observed using
H&E and Klüver Barrera Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) stains. This
explains the significant reduction of inflammation and lower
grade of demyelination in the CNS (Fig. 2E). Taken together,
[T20K]kB1 cyclotide treatment not only leads to halt of disease
progression, but also induces long-lasting effects supporting sur-
vival and hindering restimulation of splenic T cells. Consequently,
we evaluated the effects of a therapeutic treatment for reversion of
autoimmune disease progression. C57BL/6 mice were treated with
10 mg/kg [T20K]kB1 1 wk before (day −7), at the day of immu-
nization (day 0), and 1 wk after (day 7) (Table S1). Mice treated
with the cyclotide revealed an inhibition or a delay in the pro-
gression of the autoimmune encephalomyelitis reliant on the time
point of the treatment (Figs. S4A and S3B). This was confirmed by
histological H&E and LFB stains, which showed increased in-
flammation and advanced demyelination induced by mononuclear
cells infiltrating the spinal cord the later the cyclotide injection was
performed. Thus, the highest degree of reduction of inflammation
and the lowest grade of demyelination of axons was observed in
[T20K]kB1- (day −7) treated mice (Fig. S4C). Proliferation-in-
ducing IL-2 and other TH1- and TH17-related inflammatory cyto-
kines were significantly reduced in MOG-restimulated isolated
splenic T lymphocytes, influenced by the time point of cyclotide
treatment (Fig. S4D). Following these promising protective prop-
erties of the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 against autoimmunity, EAE-in-
duced mice were treated therapeutically at a score of 2, meaning at
a disease stage of partial paraparesis. A pilot experiment with a
single injection of cyclotide (10 mg/kg) resulted in a significant
reduction in the clinical score (Figs. S4B and S3C), but effects on
cytokine secretion were moderate (Fig. S4E). Nevertheless, treat-
ment with three injections (10 mg/kg) administered every third day
(Table S1) seemed to be more promising. The progression of the
autoimmune encephalomyelitis was not only substantially blunted,
but also the health status of the cyclotide-treated mice was slightly
improved (Fig. 2F and Fig. S3D). In addition, autoimmune-related
cytokine levels were reduced, suggesting a therapeutic potential of

 the nature-derived peptide [T20K]kB1 (Fig. S4F). These findings
have been further verified by histological experiments that depicted
an amelioration of the encephalomyelitis due to a lower grade of
axonal demyelination in cyclotide-treated animals and decreased
numbers of inflammatory cells in the CNS (Fig. 2G). In fact,
cyclotide treatment resulted in a reduced number of CD3+ (P <
0.001) and CD4+ (P < 0.01) cells in the CNS and in decreased IL-2
release (P = 0.07) (Fig. S5).
Oral EAE Treatment Using the Cyclotide [T20K]kalata B1. Because
cyclotides are resistant against enzymatic and chemical degra-
dation, due to their unique 3D structure, [T20K]kB1 was tested
in an oral treatment experiment for its T-cell antiproliferative
properties. Mice were treated with two different doses: one
group of mice was given 10 mg/kg, the same dose as was used for
the i.p. injections, and a second group was treated with 20 mg/kg
(Table S1). Accordingly, [T20K]kB1 applied orally improved the
EAE clinical score in a dose-dependent manner in comparison
with the control group (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3E). The cumulative
clinical score for the [T20K]kB1-treated mice (20 mg/kg) after
oral administration (mean ± SEM: 21.5 ± 9.7) was significantly
lower compared with the control group (64.1 ± 17.5), whereas
treatment with a lower dose of [T20K]kB1 (10 mg/kg) was not
significantly different (52.0 ± 24.2). Therefore, cytokine release
of the 20 mg/kg [T20K]kB1 treatment was analyzed postrestimulation
of splenic T cells after 48–72 h with their natural antigen MOG
(Fig. S6A). These findings were substantiated with histology
analysis, which revealed a minor inflammatory index and reduced
areas of axonal demyelination in orally cyclotide-treated mice,
compared with the EAE-induced control mice (Fig. S6B). Fol-
lowing up on those results, [T20K]kB1 was evaluated for its
therapeutic application (Table S1). A significant amelioration
of the autoimmune encephalomyelitis regarding the clinical score
and histological analysis has been demonstrated by oral treatment
using MOG-immunized mice (Fig. 3B and Figs. S3F and S6D).
Mice treated three times with [T20K]kB1 at a score of 2 yielded a
cumulative clinical score of 43.5 ± 12.3 compared with the control
group, which exhibited 78.5 ± 10.7.
To analyze the biodistribution of cyclotides, [T20K]kB1 was
labeled with the NIR-fluorescent VivoTag. After oral adminis-
tration of the derivatized cyclotide, an uptake into the gastro-
intestinal tract, systemic distribution and excretion mainly via the
renal/urinary tract was monitored, using the IVIS (Fig. 4A and Fig.
S7). In comparison, the VivoTag label alone applied at the same
concentrations exhibited less fluorescent intensity and a faster ex-
cretion. After 72 h mice were euthanized and the organs were
screened for fluorescence signal. The labeled cyclotide exhibited a
strong signal in the kidneys, compared with the label alone and
control. Liver and spleen lacked any label-specific signal. How-
ever, animals treated with label alone showed a low degree of
signal in kidneys and liver (Fig. 4B). Systemic uptake of the
cyclotide was determined by mass spectrometry analysis of serum
samples at 1 and 2 h postadministration, respectively (Fig. 4C).
Owing to the stable body weight of treated mice, administra-
tion of up to three doses of 10 (i.p.) or 20 mg/kg (oral) of [T20K]
kB1, respectively, seems to be safe. To confirm lack of adverse
effects, liver toxicity was determined by measuring liver enzymes
[i.e., aspartate (AST or GOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or
GPT)], which are markers for cellular integrity, and gamma-
glutamyl transferase (γGT) as an indicator for disorders linked to
the biliary tract. After oral application of 20 mg/kg of [T20K]kB1 in
healthy mice, body weight and temperature as well as the liver pa-
rameters mentioned above were monitored and confirmed its safety.
In addition, the concentration of the lipid parameters triglycerides
and cholesterol indicated no difference between [T20K]kB1-treated
mice and the control group. Histology of the gastrointestinal tract
further confirmed that cyclotides do not cause cellular lesions or
noticeable adverse effects after oral administration (Fig. S8).
Furthermore, we carried out a head-to-head comparison of
the circular plant peptide and the oral bioavailable drug fingoli-
mod. The latter is being used in the clinic to treat MS and is
therefore the appropriate reference. A single administration of
20 mg/kg fingolimod a week before (day −7) MOG immunization
with 20 mg/kg did not mitigate the course of the disease: Clinical
scores of fingolimod-treated and control animals were comparable.
In contrast, the cyclotide ameliorated the subsequent course of the
disease in a statistically significant manner (P < 0.001) (Fig. S9A
and Table S1). Application of 20 mg/kg three times in 3-d intervals
resulted in a reduction in EAE disease progression; the effect was
comparable in magnitude for both fingolimod and the cyclotide
(Fig. S9B). Daily administration (starting at day 0) of fingolimod at
an established dose of 1 mg/kg (30) seemed to be the most effective
treatment to halt progression of EAE. Similarly, the cyclotide
[T20K]kB1 achieved comparable efficacy if animals were treated
with a daily dose of 1 mg/kg (Fig. S9A). In fact, daily cyclotide
treatment leads to a substantially reduced level of cytokine se-
cretion (IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-17A), as well as a significantly lower
degree of demyelination and a minor inflammatory index (Fig.
S6C). No differences in adverse effects between the cyclotide
(20 mg/kg) and fingolimod (20 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg daily) after oral
administration can be observed using this animal study as de-
termined by the same rigorous level of tolerability evaluation as
described above (Fig. S8). Comparison of the cyclotide [T20K]kB1
to other immunosuppressant drugs revealed that morbidity
and mortality (moribund mice) was significantly reduced in
[T20K]kB1-, prednisolone-, azathioprine- and cyclosporine
A-treated mice (Fig. S9C).
Discussion
Although preliminary studies have shown that the cyclotide
kalata B1 can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation in vitro (12) the
effectiveness of nature-derived cyclotides to prevent or treat
autoimmune disorders in vivo after oral administration has
hitherto not been reported. Our study demonstrates that the
peptide [T20K]kB1 is an orally active therapeutic for treatment
of the T-cell-mediated MS model EAE (22) in vivo.
Antiproliferative effects of the cyclotide kalata B1 and the
mutant [T20K]kB1 have been investigated on human mono-
nuclear cells and purified T cells, highlighting the IL-2–specific
inhibitory mechanism in vitro (12, 13). Release of TH1 and TH17
signature cytokines were not only inhibited in vitro when in-
cubated with the cyclotide, but also after ex vivo restimulation of
EAE-induced [T20K]kB1-pretreated splenocytes with their nat-
ural antigen MOG. In particular, the reduction in the disease-
relevant T-cell cytokine IL-17A supports the observed clinical
and histological reversion of disease progression upon cyclotide
treatment. Initially various treatment regimens confirmed in

 vivo activity to reduce EAE-associated symptoms of [T20K]kB1
by parenteral application (i.p.). Interestingly, in vivo activity of
[T20K]kB1 was sequence-specific because the cyclotide [V10K]kB1
(or the untreated control group) exhibited neither significant
effects in disease reduction nor any significant reduction of
inflammation or demyelination in the CNS. An effective way to
prevent an episode of EAE was administration of cyclotide to
healthy mice 1 wk before disease induction. This could be an ad-
vantage in the relapsing–remitting form of MS, one of the most
common types (31). After the decline of the first symptoms, cyclotide
treatment could potentially interfere with the recurrence of more
profound disabilities. In addition, daily treatment with lower doses
seemed to be very efficient to prevent disease progression. However,
[T20K]kB1 was also effective to treat mice at a disease stage of
paraparesis, which impeded progression of EAE substantially.
To take advantage of the structural stability of cyclotides, the
oral treatment experiments describe for the first time to our
knowledge cyclotides used as oral active therapeutics for EAE.
Administration of cyclotides at therapeutic doses did not induce
adverse effects; it not only elicited a short-lived effect on the
secretion of signature cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-17A) but
also maintained the health status of the cyclotide-treated mice.
Application of cyclotide leads to reversion of disease progression
and induces long-lasting effects supporting survival and hindering
restimulation of splenic T cells. The observed inhibition on pro-
liferation of splenocytes isolated from the genetically modified
2D2 mouse model further supports a strong beneficial effect on
disease development.
Oral treatment required a higher dose compared with parenteral
administration likely due to low bioavailability of [T20K]kB1, as
commonly observed for peptide therapeutics (3). In fact, grafted
cystine-knot peptides are thought to have limited bioavailability of
less than 1%. Nevertheless, it was possible to detect traces of [T20K]
kB1 in serum by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry up to 2 h fol-
lowing oral administration. The gastrointestinal uptake and systemic
biodistribution of a derivatized cyclotide ([T20K-VivoTag]kB1) has
been confirmed by IVIS. Although the VivoTag-labeled cyclotide
may exhibit different physicochemical properties, IVIS seemed to be
a valid model system to monitor the trajectory of the cyclotide fol-
lowing oral administration based on the known stability of cyclotides
in proteolytic environment and at acidic conditions (32).
The long-term effect induced by the cyclotide [T20K]kB1 was
comparable to known immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclo-
sporine A, prednisolone, and azathioprine, but their clinical use in
MS therapy is limited due to low activity, lack of oral bio-
availability, or high incidence of systemic side effects (33–35). In a
head-to-head comparison of [T20K]kB1 and fingolimod, a re-
cently approved orally bioavailable drug to prevent MS progres-
sion, the cyclotide seemed to be an advantageous therapeutic
option when administered at a single dose; fingolimod was only
effective with multiple administrations, and best at daily admin-
istration of its therapeutic dose. Consequently, cyclotides exhibit-
ing oral activity are very promising acquisitions in drug discovery,
not only regarding the treatment of MS but as a potential option
for oral treatment of other autoimmune-related diseases (25, 36).
Successful advances in chemical and recombinant synthesis (37,
38) as well as enzymatic folding (39) and cyclization (40) may
yield affordable production of cyclotides at clinical scale in
the near future.
At the more general level, our work provides a proof of
principle for the concept that nature-derived cyclic peptides
serve as oral active therapeutics using their intrinsic bioactivity
and stable 3D structure. In fact, cyclotides have been recently
used as scaffolds to improve the stability of peptides that have
interesting pharmaceutical activities. This grafting introduced
peptide sequences into cyclotide loops and resulted in a chimeric
molecule that was orally active as bradykinin B1 receptor an-
tagonist in the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain (18).
Cyclotides represent a natural combinatorial peptide library and
they probe a chemical space that is difficult to target by using
small organic molecules (17). Thus, at the very least, they can be
anticipated to complement the existing collections of natural
products or synthetic molecules that are used in drug discovery.
In particular, building on the unique topology of cyclotides (16)
may complement efforts in rational design of bioavailable cyclic
peptide therapeutics (41).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that docu-
ments that a ribosomally synthesized, plant-derived cyclic peptide is
effective after oral administration to prevent and to treat EAE in
mice, the gold-standard animal model of human multiple sclerosis
(22). Incidentally, cyclosporine A produced by the fungus Tolypo-
cladium inflatum is also a cyclic (undeca)peptide and it is considered
the prototype of a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs
(42). Historically, cyclosporine A was instrumental to the develop-
ment of modern immunopharmacology and it is still in clinical use
today (29, 36). Despite the limitations of such comparisons, we
believe that the rich diversity of cyclotides (17, 43) justifies their
position as a treasure trove for drug discovery.

Biodistribution and uptake of cyclotides after oral administration. (A)
Biodistribution of orally applied VivoTag-labeled-[T20K]kB1, using two doses of
10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, and untreated control mice. Fluorescence intensity (ra-
diant efficiency) was monitored using the IVIS at the indicated time points (5 min,
40 min, and 4, 24, and 72 h) after oral gavage from dorsal and abdominal di-
rections. (B) Organs of orally treated mice with VivoTag-labeled [T20K]kB1 and
VivoTag label alone and from untreated control mice were scanned for fluores-
cence intensity (radiant efficiency) using IVIS 72 h after compound administration.
Calculation and quantification was performed using IVIS Living Image software,
illustrating radiant efficiency of the kidneys, the liver, and the stomach of in-
dicated animals. Data demonstrate mean ± SEM of two independent experi-
ments. (C) Analysis of native [T20K]kB1 in serum samples after oral administration
of 20 mg/kg peptide, 1 h (Left) and 2 h (Inset) postadministration, respectively,
using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Control measurements of [T20K]kB1 spiked
into fresh blood at 0.2 mg/kg corresponding to 1% of the total administered dose
(Right). Peptide peaks are given as monoisotopic mass [M+H]+.

 Peptide Synthesis. Peptides were synthesized following a recent protocol for
the generation of thioesterpeptides using Fmoc-SPPS and their use in native
chemical ligation (26) and its adaptation for amino acid coupling assisted by
microwave heating (27).
Animals and Ethics. Eight-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles
River and 2D2 myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG35–55–specific TCR trans-
genic (tg) mice on a C57BL/6 background (C57BL/6-Tg[Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2]1Kuch/J)
were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All experiments were approved
according to the European Community rules of animal care with the permis-
sion of the Austrian Ministry of Science (BMWF-66.009/0241-II/3B/2011).
EAE. C57BL/6 mice were immunized at day 0 according to the protocol de-
scribed recently in Sahin et al. (44). Progression of EAE was divided into five
clinical stages: score 0, no signs; score 1, complete tail paralysis; score 2,
partial paraparesis; score 3, severe paraparesis; score 4, tetraparesis; and
score 5, moribund condition. Mice were euthanized by deeply anesthetizing
them with ketamine reaching a score of 3–4 due to ethical guidelines.
In Vivo Imaging. Cyclotide-treated (10 mg/kg i.p. on day −7) and untreated control
EAE mice received RediJect D-Luciferin bioluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer) i.v.
on day 12 after MOG immunization. Monitoring with the IVIS (PerkinElmer) was
performed on day 13 by measuring chemiluminescence signal. Higher chem-
iluminescence levels represent enhanced inflammation in the appropriate re-
gions. VivoTag 680 XL (PerkinElmer) labeled [T20K]kB1 was injected i.v., i.p., or
orally (p.o.) into naïve mice. Fluorescence signal (excitation: 665 ± 5 nm, emission:
688 ± 5 nm) was monitored after indicated time points. Organs of euthanized
mice were screened for the fluorescence and quantified by using IVIS Living
Image software.
