esearch relating blood pressure (BP) to cognitive disor-
ders has focused on hypertension and mean BP levels. 
Although evidence demonstrates that midlife hypertension is 
a risk factor for cognitive decline, its association with late-life 
hypertension is less clear.1 In addition, randomized clinical tri-
als have not shown a consistent effect of BP-lowering treat-
ments for reducing the risk of cognitive decline2 or dementia.1
The clinical relevance of visit-to-visit BP variability has 
been dismissed until recently. During the past 5 years, evi-
dence has accumulated that visit-to-visit BP variability may 
not be a random phenomenon or simply an unimportant mea-
surement artifact, but may instead provide information on 
pathological process and be relevant for prognosis.3,4 Recent 
studies have found higher visit-to-visit BP variability, over 
monthly or yearly visits, to be a strong risk factor for stroke,4 
and of small and larger vessel cerebrovascular diseases,5,6 
which could lead to a cascade of changes related to cognitive 
decline and dysfunction.7
Limited research has examined the relationship between 
visit-to-visit BP variability and cognitive function, and 
the studies that have been conducted relied primarily on 
measurement of cognition at only 1 time point. Previous stud-
ies have found higher visit-to-visit BP variability to be associ-
ated with lower cognitive scores in populations taking a high 
number of BP-lowering drugs and other medications. Subjects 
were at a high risk of cardiovascular disease or a high prev-
alence of hypertension,8–10 or more than half of the samples 
were cognitively impaired.11 It remains uncertain whether 
visit-to-visit variability in BP is associated with a faster rate 
of cognitive decline in a general population of older adults. 
Using repeated measures of cognition, this study examined 
the association between visit-to-visit variability in BP and 
cognitive decline among a sample of community-dwelling 
Chinese men and women.
Methods
Subjects
China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is an ongoing longitudinal 
open cohort study established in 1989. A multistage, random cluster 
process was used to draw the sample from 9 provinces of China.12 In 
each wave of the CHNS, demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and 
health information were collected. In 1997, 2000, and 2004, CHNS 
Abstract—The association between visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure (BP) and cognitive decline over time remains 
incompletely understood in a general population of older adults. We assessed the hypothesis that higher visit-to-visit 
variability in BP, but not mean BP, would be associated with faster decline in cognitive function among community-
dwelling older adults. This prospective cohort study comprised 976 adults who had 3 or 4 visits with BP measurements 
as part of the China Health and Nutrition Survey from 1991, up to their first cognitive tests, and completed cognitive 
screening tests at ≥2 visits in 1997, 2000, or 2004. Visit-to-visit BP variability was expressed as the SD, coefficient of 
variation, or as the variation independent of mean BP across visits conducted at a mean interval of 3.2 years. Mean (SD) 
age at the first cognitive test was 64 (6) years. Using multivariable-adjusted linear mixed–effects models, we found higher 
visit-to-visit variability in systolic BP, but not mean systolic BP, was associated with a faster decline of cognitive function 
(adjusted mean difference [95% confidence interval] for high versus low tertile of SD variability: standardized composite 
scores −0.038 standard units (SU)/y [−0.066 to −0.009] and verbal memory −0.041 SU/y [−0.075 to −0.008]). Higher 
visit-to-visit variability in diastolic BP was associated with a faster decline of cognitive function, independent of mean 
diastolic BP, among adults aged 55 to 64 years but not those ≥65 years. Our results suggest that higher long-term BP visit-
to-visit variability is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline among older adults.  (Hypertension. 2016;68:106-113.

administered cognitive measures among participants aged ≥55 years, 
all of whom were community dwellers. Among 2408 adults partici-
pated in a cognitive screening test (participation rate 73%), 1677 had 
at least 2 measurement occasions of cognitive function. Among them, 
a total of 976 participants also had ≥3 waves of measurement of BP 
(n=721 and 255 for 3 and 4 measures) at or before their first cognitive 
test. The temporal sequence of the assessment of BP and cognitive 
function is shown in Figure S1 in the online-only Data Supplement. 
Participants not included in the analytic sample were similar to those 
included regarding age, sex, antihypertensive treatment, and baseline 
systolic BP (SBP, 130.7 and 128.9 mm Hg, respectively; P=0.07), but 
had slightly higher diastolic BP (DBP, 82.1 and 80.5 mm Hg, respec-
tively; P=0.01).
All participants in CHNS provided written informed consent. The 
institutional review committees of the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill and the National Institute of Nutrition and Food 
Safety, and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ap-
proved this study.
Assessments
Assessment of Cognitive Function
Cognitive screening items measured by CHNS in face-to-
face interviews were derived from part of the Telephone 
Interview for Cognitive Status–modified.13 Similar to the 
Mini–Mental State Examination, Telephone Interview 
for Cognitive Status–modified is able to detect cognitive 
decline over time,13,14 which has been used by population-
based studies, including the Chinese population.15,16 In 3 
waves (1997, 2000, and 2004), CHNS used identical cog-
nitive screening items, including immediate and delayed 
recall of a 10-word list, counting backward from 20, serial 
7 subtraction, and orientation. Both immediate and delayed 
recall scored from 0 to 10. Counting backward and serial 
7’s scored from 0 to 7 and was used to assess attention and 
calculation. Orientation, with scores ranging from 0 to 3, 
was assessed by asking the current date (1 point each for 
year, month, and date). Naming the tool usually used to cut 
paper was given 1 point. Higher scores on all items indicate 
better cognitive function.
Repeated measures of cognitive tests across waves were 
summarized as outcomes using 3 approaches: (1) a global 
composite cognitive score that was the total of all cognitive 
screening items with scores ranging from 0 to 31 points; (2) 
a standardized composite score (in standard units [SU]), cre-
ated as an alternative global cognitive measure by averag-
ing z scores of verbal memory and the other items assessing 
attention, calculation, and orientation; and (3) verbal memory 
scores (also in SU) that summarized scores for immediate and 
delayed recall of a 10-word list.
BP Measurements
The same standard procedure and calibrated mercury sphyg-
momanometers were used for measuring BP in each wave 
since 1991. Detailed BP measurement methods have been 
described elsewhere.17 BP was measured after a 5-minute 
seated rest by certified health workers or nurses who had 
passed a comprehensive reliability test. In each wave, 3 BP 
measurements were taken with a 30-s interval between cuff 
inflations and were averaged to derive the BP for that wave. 
To reduce potential concerns about reverse causation (eg, BP 
fluctuated because of stresses related to cognitive change), we 
used BP measurements from 1991 through the first assess-
ment of cognitive function (1997 or 2000).
For SBP and DBP, separately, we calculated the long-
term mean and BP variability across visits. Consistent with 
many other studies,4,9,11,18–21 visit-to-visit BP variability was 
expressed as SD, coefficient of variation (CV), and variation 
independent of mean (VIM=SD/meanx, with x derived from 
curve fitting). Given the time interval between BP measure-
ments, we also fitted a regression line for each participant to 
separate the 2 components of total BP variation: model varia-
tion and residual variation.
Statistical Analysis
Two sets of analyses were performed: the analysis for visit-
to-visit variability of SBP (SBP) is described below with an 
identical approach followed for the analysis of visit-to-visit 
variability of DBP.
Characteristics of participants were calculated by tertile 
of SD of SBP. We used linear mixed–effects models to evalu-
ate the association between SD of SBP and cognitive status 
over time with the lowest tertile of SD of SBP as the refer-
ent. The intercept and slope were fitted with random-effects 
components to account for interindividual differences in base-
line and rate of change of cognitive function. The first model 
adjusted for age, sex, education (highest level of education 
attained primary versus less), time (year since baseline), and 
time interactions with the above covariates. The second model 
additionally adjusted for covariates considered as potential 
confounders or change in the effect estimate by ≥10%: urban-
ization index (a multicomponent continuous scale),22 ever 
smoking (yes/no), physical activity (tertile), antihypertensive 
treatment (self-report), mean SBP, and their time interactions. 
Linear trends were tested by modeling the median value of 
each tertile as a continuous variable.
Analyses were repeated modeling tertile of CV and VIM of 
SBP, as well as separate models exploring associations between 
cognitive decline and tertile of mean SBP (omitting mean 
SBP as a covariate), rather than BP variability. Because SBP 
increases with age, which can also lead to a large SD of SBP, we 
evaluated if change in SBP over time (SBPlast visit−SBPfirst visit) was 
associated with cognitive function over time. The associations 
between SBP model variation or residual variation with cogni-
tive decline were also evaluated.
We examined if the relationship between SD of SBP and 
cognitive decline was modified by 1 key factor, age, as previ-
ous evidence suggested a stronger association between BP and 
cognitive function in midlife versus late life.1 We also examined 
if the associations may be different between those with versus 
without hypertension (defined as measured mean SBP/DBP 
≥140/90 mm Hg or self-reported use of antihypertensive medi-
cations) by testing statistical interactions using product terms. A 
P value of <0.1 was defined as statistical significance for inter-
action, whereas P value of <0.05 was used for main effects.
To assess the robustness of the findings, first we evalu-
ated if the associations between SBP variability and cogni-
tive decline were independent of the remote SBP (ie, the 
first BP measurement), baseline SBP (ie, the latest measure 
at or before cognitive assessment), or baseline hyperten-
sion status. Second, we repeated the main analyses between

visit-to-visit BP variability and change in cognitive scores 
excluding participants who took antihypertensive medi-
cations (n=113), or who reported a history of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or diabetes mellitus (n=51). Moreover, 
we repeated the main analyses among a total of 1213 par-
ticipants who had at least 2 waves of measurement of BP 
(n=237, 721, and 255 for 2, 3, and 4 measures, respectively). 
All statistical analyses were performed using STATA (ver-
sion 11.2; STATA Corp LP).
Results
Relationship Between Visit-to-Visit Variability in 
SBP and Cognitive Decline
Among all participants in the analytic sample, older age, 
higher urbanization index, lower education and physical activ-
ity, having a history of stroke and diabetes mellitus, and taking 
antihypertensive medication were associated with higher SD 
of SBP (Table 1). Also, mean SBP was progressively higher 
with increased SD of SBP (r=0.33).
The mean follow-up time for estimating cognitive 
decline was 5.3 years. Mean SBP was not associated with 
the rate of cognitive change, whereas higher visit-to-visit 
variability of SBP was associated with a faster decline of 
cognitive function. Compared with the lowest tertile of 
SD of SBP, the unadjusted rate of global cognitive decline 
associated with the middle and the highest tertile was faster 
by −0.13 points per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 
–0.33 to 0.07) and –0.26 points per year (95% CI, –0.45 to 
–0.06), respectively (P trend=0.01). Visit-to-visit variability 
of SBP remained associated with a faster decline of cogni-
tive function after adjustment for age, sex, and education 
or further adjustment for urbanization index, ever smoking, 
physical activity, antihypertensive treatment, and mean SBP 
(Figure 1; Table 2). Results were consistent for CV and VIM 
(SD/mean1.4) of SBP.
We did not find a significant association between change 
in SBP (mean change between the first and last visit 8.4 [SD, 
21.5] mm Hg) and global cognitive decline [Tertile (T)3 ver-
sus T1: β=−0.13; 95% CI, −0.33 to 0.06; P=0.09). After fitting 
a regression line from BP measurements over time, on aver-
age, model variation explained 51% of total variation. Greater 
model variation and residual variation of SBP were both asso-
ciated with faster rate of cognitive decline (Table S1).
The associations between visit-to-visit variability in SBP 
and cognitive decline were not modified by age. For example, 
compared with the lowest tertile of SD of SBP, the unadjusted 
rate of global cognitive decline associated with the highest ter-
tile was different by −0.18 points per year (95% CI, −0.42 to 
0.07) among those aged 55 to 64 years and by −0.32 points 
per year (95% CI, −0.64 to −0.01) among those aged ≥65 
years. The results were not modified by baseline hypertension 
status and sociodemographic characteristics, such as sex and 
education. The associations remained unchanged after adjust-
ing for remote SBP, baseline SBP, or baseline hypertension 
status. Limiting the analyses to participants who did not take 
antihypertensive medications, or who did not report a history 
of myocardial infarction, stroke, or diabetes mellitus at base-
line did not appreciably alter our results. Results materially 
remained the same in analyses including participants with ≥2 
waves of measurement of BP (n=1213; Table S2).
Relationship Between Visit-to-Visit Variability in 
DBP and Cognitive Decline
Because age significantly modified the association between 
DBP variability and cognitive decline (P=0.01), all subsequent 
analyses for DBP were stratified by age 55 to 64 years (n=610) 
and ≥65 years (n=366). Increasing tertiles of SD of DBP were 
associated with higher mean DBP and antihypertensive medica-
tion in both the age groups, and history of myocardial infarction 
among participants aged ≥65 years (Table S3). The correlation 
between mean DBP and SD of DBP was r=0.14 among partici-
pants <65 years of age and r=0.09 for those ≥65 years of age.
Among adults aged <65 years, the unadjusted annual rate 
of cognitive decline was faster by −0.27 points (95% CI, −0.51 
to −0.03) and −0.27 points (95% CI, −0.51 to −0.03) for the 
middle and the highest tertile of SD of DBP (P trend=0.03). 
These associations are persistent in age-, sex-, education-, and 
multivariate-adjusted models (Figure 2; Table S4). Results 
were consistent for CV and VIM of DBP, but no significant 
rate difference was found for verbal memory scores. On aver-
age, model variation explained 46% of total variation in DBP. 
No significant difference in global cognitive decline was asso-
ciated with model variation (T3 versus T1: β=−0.14; 95% CI, 
−0.38 to 0.11; P trend=0.45), but a difference was observed in 
association with the residual variation of DBP (T3 versus T1: 
β=−0.27; 95% CI, −0.51 to −0.03; P trend=0.04), suggesting 
the relation between visit-to-visit DBP variability and cogni-
tive decline is possibly because of the DBP fluctuation instead 
of the systematic pattern over time. SD, CV, or VIM of DBP 
was not associated with rates of cognitive decline for partici-
pants aged ≥65 years.
The associations between visit-to-visit variability in DBP 
remained unchanged for both age groups with additional adjust-
ment for remote DBP, baseline DBP, or baseline hypertension 
status, or limited the analyses to participants who did not take 
antihypertensive medications or who did not report a history of 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or diabetes mellitus. The associa-
tions between DBP variability and cognitive decline were not 
altered if analyses were modified to include participants with 
≥2 waves of measurement of BP, rather than ≥3 (Table S5).
Discussion
In a cohort of community-dwelling Chinese older adults, 
higher visit-to-visit variability in SBP was associated with a 
faster decline of global cognitive function and verbal memory 
over a mean follow-up of 5 years. Higher visit-to-visit DBP 
variability was associated with a faster decline of global cog-
nitive function among adults 55 to 64 years of age. In contrast, 
we did not observe an association between mean SBP or DBP 
and cognitive change over time.
Few studies have evaluated the association between visit-
to-visit BP variability and cognitive function. The results of 
our analyses are consistent with previous studies suggesting 
that long-term BP variability may be more informative than 
mean BP in predicting cognitive function in older adults.8–11 
Our definition of visit-to-visit BP variability which used the 
SD, CV, and VIM of measures at each time point, is consistent

with previous studies.9–11,18–20 In earlier studies, the interval 
between each BP visit ranged from 1 month to 4 years, and the 
mean interval in our study was 3.2 years. In a US study, where 
more than half of the participants had cognitive impairment, 
visit-to-visit variability of SBP, but not DBP, was associated 
with worse episodic memory, executive and global cognitive

Numbers in table are mean difference compared with tertile 1 (95% confidence interval) unless otherwise specified. A negative β-coefficient 
indicates faster rate of decline in cognitive performance. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, education, time, and time interactions with each covariate. 
Model 2 additionally adjusted for urbanization index, ever smoking, physical activity, ever used antihypertensive treatment, mean SBP for variability 
analysis, and time interactions with each covariate. SBP indicates systolic blood pressure; and SU, standard unit.

function.11 In other studies, where participants were at high 
risk of cardiovascular disease at entry, visit-to-visit SBP vari-
ability was associated with lower cognitive scores.8–10 One 
of these studies found both DBP and SBP variability were 
associated with cortical infarcts and lower hippocampal vol-
ume among a subgroup with magnetic resonance imaging 
showed.9 Moreover, recent studies found higher visit-to-visit 
variability in both SBP and DBP among Alzheimer’s disease 
patients,19 and with higher incidence of dementia among par-
ticipants 65+ years of age in which 60% were hypertensive at 
entry.20 Most of the previous studies were conducted among 
participants with high prevalence of BP-lowering treatments 
and other medication use. In contrast, our sample had an ini-
tial 22% prevalence of hypertension based on measured BP 
(mainly in 1991) and much lower level of diagnosis (7%) and 
treatment (4%), providing a less selective sample and a more 
natural study of the impact of visit-to-visit BP variability.
All of the above studies demonstrated that these associa-
tions were independent of mean BP. In fact, as in our data, 
few of them found a significant relation between mean BP and 
cognitive outcomes. Consistent with these findings, clinical 
trials aimed at lowering BP to reduce the incidence of demen-
tia1 or cognitive decline2 have not shown a consistent result. 
However, it is noteworthy that in the Systolic Hypertension in 
Europe (Syst-Eur) trial, calcium-channel blockers were found 
to reduce the incidence of dementia,23 and separate studies 
have shown calcium-channel blockers to be most effective for 
reducing variability of BP among all antihypertensive drug 
classes.24
In this study, although benefits of lower variability in 
SBP were observed for the full sample, we found that the 
association between DBP variability and cognitive decline 
was stronger at younger ages. We hypothesize that this may 
be because of fewer competing causes of cognitive disor-
ders. Similar to our finding about the role of age, Rothwell 
et al4 found that BP variability, although increasing with 
age, was more predictive of stroke risk for younger than for 
older patients. Our findings of a null association between 
DBP variability and cognitive decline for adults aged ≥65 
years were consistent with several other studies,8,9 whereas 
our observations among adults <65 years of age need to be 
confirmed by other studies.
Current treatment decisions for high BP are based on the 
mean value, which are typically assessed over several visits.25 
However, recent findings suggest that variability of monthly 
or yearly BP measures predict the risk of stroke,4 cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality,26 and overall mortality inde-
pendent of mean BP.18 Our study adds to the evidence that 
long-term BP variability is also relevant to cognitive func-
tioning in older adults.
Potential mechanisms linking visit-to-visit BP variability 
and impaired cognitive function have been proposed. First, 
magnetic resonance imaging findings support the hypothesis 
that the peripheral BP fluctuations could lead to cerebral hypo-
perfusion and silent vascular brain lesions,5,6,9 which in turn 
increase the risk of cognitive deterioration.27,28 These studies 
have found that higher visit-to-visit BP variability, based on 
BP measurements during 3 study visits at 1- to 3-year inter-
vals, was related to white matter hyperintensities or lesions,5,6 
and a recent study with visits at 3-month intervals found visit-
to-visit BP was associated with decreased hippocampal vol-
ume, cerebral microbleeds, and cortical infarcts.9 Second, it

is also possible that higher BP variability may represent an 
augmented hemodynamic instability, which could lead to the 
damage of microvasculature with changes in brain structure 
and function.29 Consistent with this notion, higher BP variabil-
ity was associated with endothelial injury and impairment.30 
It is hypothesized that cerebral microcirculatory endothelial 
dysfunction may influence the integrity of the blood–brain 
barrier, cerebral autoregulation, and other physiological pro-
cesses, with subsequent impact on the genesis of brain infarcts 
and the development of cognitive impairment.31
Several limitations of this study should be considered. 
First, although a wide array of covariates were adjusted in the 
model, measures of potential confounders (eg, depression and 
heart rate) were not available, and some residual confounding 
is possible. Second, BP for a given participant was not sys-
tematically assessed at the same time of day across the mul-
tiple follow-ups which could contribute to the random error 
of BP variability and attenuated the associations. Third, like 
some other studies,18,20 BP variability in our study was calcu-
lated from 3 or 4 visits, which has limited the precision and 
reproducibility of estimating BP variability compared with 
more measurements. In addition, only 58% of participants 
were eligible for main analysis because of the open cohort 
design, but selection bias was not a strong concern given the 
similar findings when more participants were included in the 
sensitivity analysis. The relatively narrow scope of cognitive 
screening items adopted in CHNS is another limitation. The 
association between BP variability and cognitive decline may 
be strengthened if more sensitive tools for cognitive screening 
were available.
Perspectives
This study supports the hypothesis that higher long-term BP 
variability independent of mean BP is associated with a faster 
rate of cognitive decline among older adults. Controlling BP 
instability could possibly be a strategy in preserving cognitive 
function among older adults, but intervention trials and more 
longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this finding.

What Is New?
• Utilizing repeated measures of cognitive function, this prospective study 
shows that higher long-term visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood 
pressure, but not in mean blood pressure, is associated with faster rate 
of cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults.
• The association between visit-to-visit variability in diastolic blood pres-
sure and cognitive decline is age dependent: higher visit-to-visit vari-
ability in diastolic blood pressure was associated with a faster decline 
of cognitive function among adults aged <65 years but not those aged 
≥65 years.
What Is Relevant?
• This study suggests that controlling blood pressure instability could be 
a potential strategy in preserving cognitive function among older adults.
Summary
In a cohort of community-dwelling older adults, higher visit-to-visit 
variability in systolic blood pressure was associated with a faster 
decline of global cognitive function and verbal memory. Higher vis-
it-to-visit diastolic blood pressure variability was associated with a 
faster decline of global cognitive function among adults aged 55 to 
64 years. Mean systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure 
was not associated with cognitive change.
