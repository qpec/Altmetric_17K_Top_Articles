ABSTRACT
Objectives: Distal forearm fractures are the most common fracture type in children. Point-of-care-ultrasound
(POCUS) is increasingly being used, and preliminary studies suggest that it offers an accurate approach to
diagnosis. However, outcomes such as pain, satisfaction, and procedure duration have not been explored but
may be salient to the widespread acceptance of this technology by caregivers and children. Our objectives were
to examine the test performance characteristics of POCUS for nonangulated distal forearm injuries in children and
compare POCUS to x-ray with respect to pain, caregiver satisfaction, and procedure duration.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving children aged 4–17 years with a suspected nonangulated
distal forearm fracture. Participants underwent both x-ray and POCUS assessment. The primary outcome was
sensitivity between POCUS and x-ray, the reference standard. Secondary outcomes included self-reported pain using
the Faces Pain Scale–Revised, caregiver satisfaction using a five-item Likert scale, and procedure duration.
Results: POCUS was performed in 169 children of whom 76 were diagnosed with a fracture including 61 buckle
fractures. Sensitivity of POCUS for distal forearm fractures was 94.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89.7–99.8)
and specificity was 93.5% (95% CI = 88.6–98.5). POCUS was associated with a significantly lower median
(interquartile range [IQR]) pain score compared to x-ray: 1 (0–2) versus 2 (1–3), respectively (median difference
= 0.5; 95% CI = 0.5–1; p < 0.001) and no significant difference in median (IQR) caregiver satisfaction score: 5 (0)
versus 5 (4–5), respectively (median difference = 0, 95% CI = 0, p = 1.0). POCUS was associated with a
significantly lower median (IQR) procedure duration versus x-ray: 1.5 (0.8–2.2) minutes versus 27 (15–58) minutes,
respectively (median difference = 34.1, 95% CI = 26.8–41.5, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that POCUS assessment of distal forearm injuries in children is accurate,
timely, and associated with low levels of pain and high caregiver satisfaction.

usculoskeletal injuries comprise at least 30% of
emergency department (ED) visits in school-aged
children.1 In fact, between 25 and 50% of children
will sustain a fracture before age 16.2 In children, the
most common site is the distal forearm3–5 and the fre-
quency of this injury has been increasing.6 As a possi-
ble result, annual healthcare costs related to distal
forearm fractures in the United States currently exceed
$2 billion.7 A large component of this cost is the
number of radiographs requested by clinicians.8 In
addition to diagnostic certainty, an equally relevant
and commonly overlooked aspect of care is pain man-
agement. Radiographic evaluation often causes signifi-
cant
discomfort,
even
when
the
fracture
is
not
displaced.9
Several
studies
have
reported
that
point-of-care
ultrasound (POCUS) is an accurate method to diag-
nose upper extremity fractures in children.10–18 How-
ever, four of these studies enrolled children with gross
angulation,11,14,15,17 potentially inflating test perfor-
mance. Furthermore, only one study explored pain as
an outcome, albeit in a subset of patients10 and no
study has reported differences in caregiver satisfaction
or procedure duration between the POCUS and x-ray
in this clinical context. Parental satisfaction with ED
care is strongly influenced by their children’s pain
relief19,20 and perceived waiting room time.20 There is
now national advocacy for ultrasound as an initial
imaging modality in children, including POCUS.21
However, widespread adoption of POCUS to identify
fractures in children depends on demonstrating that
POCUS is associated with minimal pain, acceptable
caregiver satisfaction, and timely and accurate identifi-
cation of fractures.
Our objectives were to determine the test perfor-
mance of POCUS in children with suspected nonan-
gulated distal forearm fractures, using x-rays as the
reference standard. We also sought to evaluate the
patient-oriented outcomes of pain, caregiver satisfac-
tion, and procedure duration.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This was a cross-sectional study designed to explore
the test performance characteristics, pain, caregiver sat-
isfaction, and procedure duration of POCUS in the
diagnosis of distal forearm fractures in children. Using
a
standardized
script,
a
convenience
sample
of
potential participants were consecutively screened and
enrolled 3 days a week between the hours of 1700
and 2300 based on the availability of both a research
assistant and a study physician trained in POCUS
(bedside ultrasonographer). The study took place in
our center’s pediatric ED from June 8, 2014, and
November 12, 2015. Ethics approval was obtained by
our institution’s research ethics board.
Selection of Participants
We included participants aged 4 to 17 years who pre-
sented to the ED with a suspected nonangulated distal
forearm fracture defined as maximal pain and tender-
ness at the distal third of the forearm following an
acute (<48 hours) fall on an outstretched hand. Eligi-
bility was determined on clinical grounds by the
treating physician immediately after triage and before
the x-ray and POCUS assessment. Informed consent
was obtained by a research assistant either immediately
following the x-ray or when the patient arrived into an
ED bed. Participants were unaware of the study
hypothesis. We excluded children who received analge-
sia (pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic) prior to arri-
val,
known
metabolic
bone
disease,
congenital
malformation of distal radius, suspected open fracture,
known radius or ulna fracture, signs and symptoms
consistent with neurovascular compromise, distracting
injuries, and gross angular deformity.
Methods and Measurement
Point-of-care ultrasound was performed by one of four
pediatric emergency physicians (NP, AM, FM, and VI)
certified through the Canadian Emergency Ultrasound
Society.22 Ultrasonographers had at least 2 years’ expe-
rience performing POCUS, were not involved in the
patient’s care, and performed POCUS assessments
prior to the staff radiologist’s reporting of the x-ray.
All
bedside
ultrasonographers
viewed
a
4-minute
training
video
(http://hqmeded.com/ultrasound-use-
in-the-reduction-of-closed-distal-radius-fractures/)
and
performed 25 satisfactory training scans of the distal
forearm prior to involvement in the study. A fourth
“expert ultrasonographer” who was not present at the
time of the clinical encounter performed a separate
interpretation of all ultrasound clips recorded by the
bedside ultrasonographer (DT).
The bedside ultrasonographers were blinded to the
participant’s mechanism of injury, x-ray images, and
interpretation.

 interpretation by the bedside ultrasonographer. The
staff pediatric radiologist was blinded to the POCUS
images, POCUS interpretation by the bedside and
expert ultrasonographers, and the clinical history. The
x-ray technician was unaware of the study’s objectives
and hypothesis. Participants and their caregivers were
unaware of the study’s hypothesis and the results of
both the POCUS assessment and x-ray until all study-
related outcomes were recorded. All participant data
including ultrasound clips were anonymized.
Each participant underwent both x-ray and POCUS
evaluation of the distal ulna and radius. X-rays were
used as the reference standard because they are consid-
ered the standard of care in our clinical setting. All
x-rays included an anteroposterior and lateral view of
the distal forearm. Using a Sonosite M20 Turbo 10–5
MHz linear transducer, sonographic images of the dis-
tal third of the radius and ulna were obtained and
recorded in two planes: longitudinal dorsal and volar
and longitudinal lateral, corresponding to the lateral
and anteroposterior x-ray views, respectively. The bed-
side ultrasonographer saved all six image clips as a 6-
second video for review by the expert ultrasonographer
using the Qpath workflow manager (Telexy Health-
care). The POCUS interpretation made by the bedside
ultrasonographer as well as the initial x-ray interpreta-
tion made by the treating physician was recorded by a
research assistant. The reference standard was defined
as a fracture if it was identified as such on x-ray by the
staff pediatric radiologist’s report. The reference stan-
dard was defined as no fracture if no distal radius or
ulna fracture was identified in the staff pediatric radiol-
ogist’s report. In the event of an equivocal interpreta-
tion, a presence of a fracture was determined by a
pediatric orthopedic surgeon based on clinical symp-
toms and follow-up x-rays. Sonographers were permit-
ted
to
classify
scans
as
positive,
negative,
or
indeterminate. An indeterminate scan was treated in the
analysis as a discordance between POCUS and x-ray.
A fracture identified on x-ray but indeterminate on
POCUS was counted as a false negative (missed
fracture).
The research assistant recorded the participant’s
self-reported pain using the Faces Pain Scale–Revised
(FPS-R)23 immediately following the x-ray and again
immediately following POCUS assessment. The FPS-R
is a six-item self-report measure to assess the intensity
of pain. It has been found to have sound psychomet-
ric properties23 and validated for use in children at
least 4 years of age.24 The scale is scored by the
participant from 0 (no pain) to 5 (maximum amount
of pain) by circling the appropriate face on a horizon-
tal axis. The score was obtained by asking the child to
report the pain they experienced while the respective
imaging procedure was being performed. The FPS-R
has been used retrospectively to measure fracture-
related24 and procedural pain.25
The research assistant recorded the primary care-
giver’s satisfaction immediately following the x-ray and
again immediately following POCUS, prior to the
recording of the pain score. Caregiver satisfaction was
ascertained by the question “Please rate your degree of
satisfaction with the imaging procedure your child just
received” using a 5-item Likert scale anchored by the
qualifiers “completely unsatisfied” to “completely satis-
fied.” No validated measure of caregiver satisfaction
for this indication exists. However, this type of scale
has been outlined in the 2008 Pediatric Initiative on
Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clin-
ical Trials (PedIMMPACT) statement.26
The research assistant also recorded the duration
of time to perform each imaging modality. POCUS
procedure duration was defined as the interval of
time between the ultrasound machine being turned
on to the completion of the last ultrasound scan.
X-ray procedure duration was defined as the interval
of time between the participant’s arrival in the x-ray
suite to the completion of the last image, as recorded
by the x-ray technician. In our center, children do
not wait once they have arrived to the x-ray suite
and the arrival time estimated as closely as possible
the time that the technician began positioning the
child for x-rays.
Analgesics were administered at triage according to
a nurse-initiated protocol, at their discretion, and lim-
ited to either 10 mg/kg ibuprofen (maximum 800 mg)
and/or 15 mg/kg acetaminophen (maximum 975 mg)
but without the use of nonpharmacologic measures
such as ice, splinting, or aids offered by a child life
specialist.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was an estimate of the sensitivity
of POCUS in correctly classifying fractures identified
by x-ray, the reference standard. This parameter was
chosen
because
we
believed
the
most
clinically
important aspect of care in patients with suspected dis-
tal forearm injuries is the ability to confidently rule
out a fracture. Secondary outcomes included self-
reported pain on the FPS-R,23 caregiver satisfaction

 using a 5-item Likert scale,26 and duration of proce-
dure between POCUS and x-ray.
Data Analysis
Characteristics of participants and test performance
characteristics were described using means and stan-
dard deviations (SDs) and percentages and frequencies
as appropriate. Test performance characteristics were
reported as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
predictive values with 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
and likelihood ratios. A case was defined as a true posi-
tive when POCUS identified the same fracture type(s)
and location(s) as the reference standard. When
POCUS missed an injury identified on x-ray (i.e., no
fracture when one present, buckle fracture when a
transverse fracture present, or single bone when both
bones had fractures), it was defined as a false negative.
A false positive was defined as a such when POCUS
identified a fracture but the reference standard did
not. A true negative was defined as no fracture identi-
fied by both POCUS and the reference standard. The
percentage agreement and the proportion of specific
agreement (proportion of positive and negative agree-
ment), j statistic, and 95% CI were calculated to
examine the agreement between the blinded expert
and both the ultrasonographer’s interpretation and the
reference standard. Test performance for individual
bedside ultrasonographers were depicted in the form
of a cluster analysis. Time intervals, pain scores using
the FPS-R, and caregiver satisfaction scores using a
Likert
scale
were
described
using
medians
and
interquartile ranges (IQRs) and between group com-
parisons were performed using the related samples
Wilcoxon signed rank test with the median difference
and 95% CI reported using a related-samples Hodges-
Lehman median difference. To determine whether
there were differences in pain scores based on pres-
ence of a fracture, the provision of analgesia at least
30 minutes prior to imaging (no analgesic vs. at least
30 minutes prior to imaging vs. less than 30 minutes
prior to imaging), and the order in which imaging
modalities were performed, between-group compar-
isons were made using unpaired t-tests for presence of
a fracture and imaging modalities and the provision of
analgesia at least 30 minutes prior to imaging. The
time of 30 minutes was chosen based on the reported
time to effective analgesia for both acetaminophen and
ibuprofen.27
Data for acceptable false-negative rates in distal fore-
arm fractures have not been described. However,
based on reported false-negative rates for x-rays of dis-
tal forearm fractures ranging from 4.1%28 to 7.7%,29
we assumed that clinicians would desire to miss no
more than 5% of children with a fracture. To detect a
sensitivity of 95%, a sample size of 72 patients with a
fracture and 72 without a fracture would be required
at the 5% two-sided level of significance with 80%
power.30 A significance level of 5% was used to reject
the null hypothesis of no difference between groups.
The analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical
software package (version 24).
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Subjects
We enrolled and analyzed the results of 169 partici-
pants (Figure 1). Overall, there were more males in
the sample, but the majority of children with fractures
were female. Forty-five percent (76/169) were diag-
nosed with a fracture. Of these, most (80.3%, 61/76)
were buckle fractures (Table 1). Just over half of
patients received analgesia at triage (Table 1). The
median (IQR) times between receiving analgesia to x-ray
and POCUS were 24 (14–53) and 61 (41 to 92) minutes,
respectively. The median (IQR) time between x-ray and
POCUS was 35 (21 to 55) minutes with a range of 13 to
74 minutes.
Primary Outcome
The test performance characteristics of POCUS are
shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, respectively. The posi-
tive and negative likelihood ratios were 14.6 and 0.6,
respectively. There were no equivocal x-ray interpreta-
tions or indeterminate POCUS scans. One bedside
ultrasonographer
(NP)
performed
almost
half
of
POCUS assessments but there were no gross differ-
ences in performance between individual ultrasonogra-
phers (Figure 2). In all cases of fracture, no angular
deformity was identified on x-ray, and no open or
closed reductions were performed. The four fractures
that POCUS failed to identify included one distal
radius buckle fracture and three ulnar styloid fractures
(Figure 2). All participants in which a fracture was not
identified on x-ray were diagnosed as having a soft tis-
sue injury. X-ray and the corresponding POCUS
image of a distal forearm buckle fracture can be found
in Figure 3.

statistics
are
shown
in
Figure 4
and
Table 3, respectively. The overall inter-rater agreement
between the bedside ultrasonographer and the expert
ultrasonographer was excellent with a kappa of 0.74
(95% CI = 0.65–0.83; Table 3). No participants were
lost to follow-up and there were no adverse events.
Secondary Outcomes
Point-of-care ultrasound was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower median pain scores on the FPS-R and a
significantly smaller proportion of participants with
moderate or severe pain (Table 4, Figure 5). There
was a significantly lower median procedure duration
of POCUS versus x-ray (Table 4). There was no signif-
icant difference in median caregiver satisfaction scores
between groups but more than 90% of caregivers
reported being “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with
POCUS (Table 4). Results of the exploratory analysis
showed that the difference in pain scores for each par-
ticipant was not significantly associated with whether
analgesia was provided at least 30 minutes prior to
imaging (p = 0.59), order of receiving the imaging
modality (p = 0.97), or whether or not a fracture was
present (p = 0.63; Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that caregivers and children can
be reassured that POCUS assessment of distal fore-
arm injuries is timely, accurate, and associated with
low levels of pain and high caregiver satisfaction. In
addition, the high specificity of POCUS we identi-
fied lends support for the possibility that x-rays may

findings.
The test performance characteristics of POCUS in
our study are in line with a systematic review of eight
studies in patients with extremity fractures that con-
cluded that POCUS was an “accurate diagnostic test
to rule in or rule out extremity fractures.”31 More
specifically, sensitivity and specificity of POCUS for
pediatric distal forearm fractures range from 71% to

 100% and 73% to 91%, respectively.10–12,14–16,18,31,32
Sensitivity and specificity across studies that included
children with buckle fractures14,15,17,32 ranged from
78% to 100% and 93% to 100%, respectively.31 This
wide range may be due to the differences in the degree
of experience of the ultrasonographers and the inclu-
sion of children with angulated injuries in a number
of studies.14,15,17 The positive and negative likelihood
ratios obtained in our study indicate that POCUS has
good discriminative ability to detect and rule out frac-
tures of the distal forearm in children.33 The high
degree of specificity we found suggests that x-rays may
be avoided in children with a reliable history, clinical
examination, and a normal POCUS assessment, even
in resource-rich settings.
Three of the four forearm fractures missed by
POCUS were ulnar styloid fractures. Although the
ulnar styloid is within the scanning region of the ultra-
sound probe and can be easily visualized, its epiphy-
seal location may be a source of diagnostic error. In
their systematic review, Joshi et al.31 found that most
diagnostic errors involved the ends of long bones (ph-
ysis, epiphysis, and metaphysis), suggesting a target
that POCUS education should emphasize. Consistent
with our work, a few studies have included anecdotal
descriptions of cases where buckle fractures were
detected on POCUS but missed on plain radiogra-
phy.14,18,32 No studies to date have been sufficiently
powered to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the x-ray
interpretation to POCUS for detection of extremity
fractures based on a noninferiority hypothesis. How-
ever, these reports and others suggest that POCUS
may be superior to plain radiography for detecting sub-
tle injuries such as buckle fractures,14,32 Salter Harris
type I fractures,11 and scaphoid fractures.34 Despite
these reports, we suggest a judicious approach to the
exclusive use of POCUS for diagnosis of forearm frac-
tures in children.
Consistent with the only other study that reported
pain outcomes in distal forearm injuries, we found
that POCUS was associated with significantly lower
median pain scores than x-ray.10 Importantly, however,
the observed difference was not clinically significant.23
What is clear is that POCUS is associated with low
levels of pain in most participants as evidenced by the
finding that only 14% reported moderate or severe
pain.35 We surmise this may be because we excluded
children with displaced fractures. Low pain scores
associated with POCUS may be due to the fact that
all images can be obtained without the child having to
move the involved extremity. Any pain associated with

 obtaining images was likely a result of exerting mild
pressure over the affected area with the ultrasound
probe. Overall, our results suggest that for assessment
of distal forearm injuries, clinicians can reassure care-

 In 2008, the PedIMMPACT statement outlined six
core outcome domains for pediatric clinical trials of
pain. Among them was a “global judgment of satisfac-
tion.”26 We believe that the affirmation of caregivers is
integral to the adoption of POCUS as a diagnostic
modality in children, especially given that x-rays are
the standard of care across most resource-rich settings.
Both x-ray and POCUS were associated with high
caregiver satisfaction, suggesting that its use in children
with nonangulated distal forearm injuries may be sup-
ported by the family.
ED wait times and length of stay are a growing con-
cern
among
families,
health
care
providers,
and
administrators alike. As such, procedure duration is
an important consideration for clinicians and institu-
tions that may seek a role for routine use of POCUS
in musculoskeletal injuries. We have shown that ade-
quate POCUS evaluation of a suspected nonangulated
distal forearm injury in children as young as 4 years
of age takes considerably less time than obtaining an
x-ray located outside the ED. Although not directly
quantified,
Chaar-Alvarez
et al.10
reported
that
POCUS assessments take less than 5 minutes. Our
findings may not be applicable to other institutions
due to site-specific differences in the logistics of obtain-
ing diagnostic imaging and varying experience of
POCUS sonographers. However, the portability of
ultrasound machines and the ability to make a diagno-
sis in real time are universal. Our findings imply that
an accurate POCUS assessment can obviate the need
to await an x-ray interpretation and transport a family
to and from the x-ray department.
LIMITATIONS
The primary limitation of this study was that four bed-
side sonographers who previously received certification
in
POCUS
performed
all
the
ultrasound
scans.
Although this certification process did not include for-
mal training in POCUS for fracture recognition, we
cannot be certain that our results are applicable to
clinicians will little to no POCUS experience. More
specifically, experienced sonographers may have led to
higher sensitivity and specificity than if novice sonogra-
phers were involved. The timeliness of the POCUS
assessments may also be explained by the greater expe-
rience of the sonographers involved. Less experienced
clinicians may require more time to obtain quality
images. The prevalence of fractures identified in our
sample was consistent with that reported by others in
children.31 However, prevalence during evening hours
would be expected to be higher than during the day
due to greater involvement in extracurricular activities,
raising the possibility of spectrum bias. This may have

 led to a higher positive predictive value, sensitivity,
and specificity observed in our sample. Several factors
pose a threat to the validity of the pain assessments
including the order in which imaging was received,
whether or not the participant had a fracture, and if
analgesia was provided at least 30 minutes prior to
imaging. If a carryover effect was present, this would
have led to a higher pain score associated with
POCUS and our results show that both modalities
were associated with low levels of pain. In contrast,
analgesia may have had more time to reach an effec-
tive plasma level for POCUS assessment, which was
usually performed after x-ray, and perhaps leading to a
lower pain score. Although we did not identify any sig-
nificant effect on the difference in pain scores due to
these factors, the collection of preimaging pain scores
may have allowed us to better control for baseline
heterogeneity in pain. However, most participants were
sent to x-ray directly from triage, precluding a preimag-
ing encounter between the research assistant and
participant.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that point-of-care ultrasound
assessment of distal forearm injuries in children is accu-
rate, timely, and associated with low levels of pain and
high caregiver satisfaction. To determine whether point-
of-care ultrasound can truly replace x-ray for diagnosis of
nonangulated distal forearm injuries in children, future
study designs should take the form of noninferiority tri-
als that demonstrate that when compared to x-ray, point-
of-care ultrasound is no worse with respect to diagnostic
accuracy,
missed
diagnoses
and
associated
long-
term complications, cost-effectiveness, pain, caregiver
satisfaction, and length of stay.
