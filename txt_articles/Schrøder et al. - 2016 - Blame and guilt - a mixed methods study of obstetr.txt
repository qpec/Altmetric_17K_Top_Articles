Abstract
Introduction. When complications arise in the delivery room, midwives and
obstetricians operate at the interface of life and death, and in rare cases the
infant or the mother suffers severe and possibly fatal injuries related to the
birth. This descriptive study investigated the numbers and proportions of
obstetricians and midwives involved in such traumatic childbirth and explored
their experiences with guilt, blame, shame and existential concerns. Material
and methods. A mixed methods study comprising a national survey of Danish
obstetricians and midwives and a qualitative interview study with selected sur-
vey participants. Results. The response rate was 59% (1237/2098), of which
85% stated that they had been involved in a traumatic childbirth. We formed
five categories during the comparative mixed methods analysis: the patient,
clinical peers, official complaints, guilt, and existential considerations. Although
blame from patients, peers or official authorities was feared (and sometimes
experienced), the inner struggles with guilt and existential considerations were
dominant. Feelings of guilt were reported by 36–49%, and 50% agreed that the
traumatic childbirth had made them think more about the meaning of life.
Sixty-five percent felt that they had become a better midwife or doctor due to
the traumatic incident. Conclusions. The results of this large, exploratory study
suggest that obstetricians and midwives struggle with issues of blame, guilt and
existential concerns in the aftermath of a traumatic childbirth.
Abbreviation: HCP, healthcare professional.
Introduction
Although adverse outcomes and medical mistakes primar-
ily affect patients and relatives, healthcare professionals
(HCPs) also feel upset and experience secondary trau-
matic stress in the aftermath of an adverse event (1–4).
These individuals are sometimes referred to as “second
victims”, and although far from all events that can be
easily distinguished in “error” or “non-error”, the HCPs
often feel personally responsible for the adverse patient
outcome (1,2,5–8). The Institute of Medicine’s report “To
Err Is Human” (9) in 2000 has been proclaimed to have
marked the beginning of a paradigmatic change in
Key message
Existential concerns and feelings of blame and guilt
are commonly experienced by obstetricians and mid-
wives in the aftermath of traumatic childbirth.

 healthcare to replace the blame culture with a just culture
promoting disclosure and learning in the aftermath of an
adverse event (1,7,10,11). This new culture has been pro-
moted in obstetrics and midwifery, where human as well
as systemic error are corrected in different ways, such as
perinatal audits, obstetric skills training or debriefings to
improve procedures and prevent future incidents (12,13).
However, these measures occur at an organizational level
and in the aftermath of a traumatic childbirth, the pri-
mary focus is on the patient and less on the HCP (14–
18). Although it is recognized that second victims also
need support, restricted healthcare budgets and a limited
knowledge of how to deal with HCPs in such circum-
stances are a challenge (1,2,7). Qualitative studies have
shown that traumatic or stressful childbirth situations can
have a long-term impact on obstetric HCPs’ mental
health and professional and personal identities, and
themes regarding guilt and the weight of the responsibil-
ity have been identified (19–21). Until now, most studies
in larger populations have investigated the prevalence of
symptoms of posttraumatic stress or secondary traumatic
stress in midwives or obstetric nurses, and they should be
interpreted with caution due to very low response rates
and possible selection bias (3,14,22). In a qualitative pilot
study preceding this study, we found that midwives were
concerned with matters such as guilt, blame and shame,
and existential considerations, which debriefing or sup-
port systems would not normally cover. In this mixed
methods study, obstetricians and midwives were viewed
as a single group of “obstetric HCPs”, and the aim was to
describe the numbers and proportions of obstetricians
and midwives involved in traumatic childbirth and to
explore some of their experiences or feelings with guilt,
blame, shame and existential concerns.
Material and methods
This study was part of an interdisciplinary project about
traumatic childbirth from the perspective of the HCP.
We employed a mixed methods research design with data
generated from two different approaches: a national ques-
tionnaire survey (summer 2012) and a qualitative inter-
view study (autumn 2012). “Mixed methods” is a generic
term that refers to the integrated use of both qualitative
and quantitative methods in one study. The intention of
using mixed methods in our study was to bring together
the differing strengths and weaknesses of quantitative
methods (large sample size, trends, generalization) with
those of qualitative methods (small sample, details, in
depth) (23). We used the results from one method to
develop and inform the other method, as shown in
Figure 1. The study design is a merger of Creswell and
Plano Clark’s Explanatory and Exploratory Sequential
Design models (23). This merged model allowed us to
investigate the generalizability of themes that emerged
from qualitative data in the pilot study (interview study
with seven midwives with experiences of traumatic child-
birth), and to use selected participants from the survey to
explore the themes of being shamed or blamed, feeling
guilty and existential considerations.
The national survey included all obstetricians and mid-
wives in Denmark registered with the Danish Medical
Association and the Danish Association of Midwives
(n = 2098) comprising 563 consultants and trainees in
obstetrics and gynecology (obstetricians) and 1535 mid-
wives. Approximately 98 and 95% of obstetricians and
midwives are members of their respective associations.
Fifty-one letters were returned because of unknown
address. Fifty-nine percent (1237/2098) responded: 293
(52%) obstetricians and 944 midwives (61%). Traumatic
childbirth was defined as an event in which the infant or
the mother suffered presumed permanent, severe and
possibly fatal injuries related to the birth. Of 1212
responders to this item, 1027 (85%) stated that they had
been involved in a traumatic childbirth [264/293 obstetri-
cians (93%) and 763/944 midwives (82%)]. Respondents
who had been involved in more than one traumatic birth
were asked to complete the questionnaire pertaining to
the birth that had had the greatest impact on them. We
recruited 14 respondents from the survey (six obstetri-
cians and eight midwives) to participate in individual,
semi-structured interviews. Characteristics of the respon-
dents (questionnaire) and participants (interviews) are
presented in Table 1. Supporting Information Table S1
shows characteristics according to profession.
For the national survey, postal addresses were provided
by the Danish Medical Association and the Danish Asso-
ciation of Midwives from their lists of members. The
respondents were offered the choice of returning the

 questionnaire by post in a stamped-addressed envelope or
by completing the questionnaire online. The postal ques-
tionnaire was returned by 483 (39%), and 754 (61%)
replied online. A poster was sent to all labor wards in Den-
mark after 5 weeks, and a personal letter was sent to all
non-responders after 3 months. The questionnaire con-
tained 169 items, spread over 48 main questions divided
into four sections: (i) demographic information; (ii) psy-
chosocial health and wellbeing, (iii) values, faith and
beliefs; and (iv) traumatic childbirths and second victims.
This study reports from the first and the last section (de-
mographic data and traumatic childbirth). We selected 13
items from the last section, of which the first six were ques-
tions developed from the qualitative pilot study and the lit-
erature (8,17,18). The following seven items were questions
translated from an existing tool (24). These items and their
translation were face validated by eight obstetricians and
midwives. Other items in the questionnaire will be pre-
sented separately from this manuscript. The selection of
items will be explained in the following section.
For the interview study, we recruited 14 respondents
from the survey (six obstetricians and eight midwives) to
participate in individual, semi-structured interviews. We
did a purposive sampling of participants from the ques-
tionnaire where respondents consented to participate in
the interview study if they entered their contact details. The
idea behind purposive sampling is to select interviewees
rich on information and who are likely to generate appro-
priate and useful data (25). While ensuring that both obste-
tricians and midwives were represented, we selected a list of
phone numbers from respondents who Agreed or Strongly
agreed with one particular statement in the questionnaire:
“The traumatic event has made me think more about the
meaning of life”. This statement was chosen on the
assumption that the selected participants had reflected on
the event on an existential level and were therefore “rich in
information”. Since 305 responders in this category had
consented to participate in the interview study, we had to
select phone numbers randomly from the list. Because par-
ticipants were selected from a national survey, they came
from all parts of Denmark. They were all asked to choose
their preferred interview venue [home (6); workplace (6);
at the office of the interviewer (2)]. An interview guide
(Supporting Information Table S2) was developed based
on data from the pilot study, from initial analysis of the
questionnaire and from the literature. However, this was
not rigidly followed, based on a social constructionist
approach perceiving all narratives to be constructed in situ
and acknowledging the interviewer’s and participant’s con-
stitutive contributions to the dialogue (26). The first author
(K.S.) conducted all the interviews and introduced herself
as a midwife and researcher. The interviewer paid particu-
lar attention to create a non-judgmental atmosphere,

Blame and guilt after traumatic childbirth
 focusing on the experience of the participants rather than
on the obstetric “facts” of the event. Interviews lasted
between 35 and 95 min (mean 61) and all were audio-
recorded and transcribed verbatim by the first author.
We performed an integration of analysis where the cate-
gories from the analysis of the interview study were com-
pared with the questionnaire to find corresponding items
that addressed the same issues. First, we analyzed the quan-
titative data using descriptive statistical methods. Statistical
analyses were performed using STATA version 13.1 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Secondly, a four-step
framework analysis was chosen to analyze the qualitative
data, comprising four stages: familiarization with the data,
thematic analysis, indexing and charting (25). Supporting
Information Table S3 shows an extract of a chart from the
fourth stage. Thirdly, the aim of the study, to explore obste-
tricians’ and midwives’ experiences with blame, shame,
guilt and their existential concerns with respect to their
involvement in traumatic childbirth, served as a conceptual
framework for a deductive process. The categories were
compared with the questionnaire to find corresponding
items that addressed the same issues. This iterative process
was repeated several times, closely guided by the aim of the
study: investigating whether themes from the interview data
could be represented by the questionnaire data and how
results from the quantitative analysis could be elaborated,
enhanced or illustrated by the qualitative data. All codes
and categories were discussed by the first and last author
throughout the process. We used a distinction between an
individual’s uncomfortable feeling that they had done
something wrong by their own lights – guilt – and the emo-
tions caused by incurring society’s moral disapproval –
shame – and the process by which society allocates shame –
blame (10). Although this distinction between shame and
blame is commonly used (10,11), it became clear during
this process that blame and shame were experienced quite
differently depending on who represented “society”. Conse-
quently, we transformed three categories concerning blame
and shame into (i) the patient; (ii) clinical peers; and (iii)
official complaints. Individual feelings of self-blame and
guilt formed the fourth category of guilt. Finally, all data
concerning existential considerations or concerns formed
the fifth category of existential considerations.
The Danish National Data Protection Agency gave their
formal consent (J.no. 2011-41-6841, 16 November 2011)
and data were handled and stored in accordance with the
agency’s rules. All participants of the interview study
received a letter informing them that the purpose of the
study was to obtain knowledge about traumatic childbirth
from the perspective of the HCP, that all information would
be treated confidentially, and that all quotes or summaries of
the interview would appear in an anonymized form in publi-
cations. The letter was signed by all 14 participants.
Results
The results from the questionnaire are displayed in
Table 2. Supporting Information Table S4 shows the dis-
tribution of obstetricians and midwives for each question.
The overall findings concern: (i) fear of being blamed (nos
1–3); (ii) feelings of guilt (no. 4) and (iii) existential con-
siderations (no. 5). These are described in five categories
which will be presented separately with results from the
quantitative analysis followed by findings from the qualita-
tive analysis. Table 3 shows the five categories which were
formed during the mixed methods analysis, including the
numbers of the questions from the questionnaire.
The patient
Table 2 shows that 87% of the respondents agreed that to
a great or to some extent, “Memories of what happened to
the patient kept troubling me for a long time after the
event” (item 7). “The patient and/or next of kin blamed
me for what happened” (item 13) was experienced to a
great or some extent by 17%, to a small extent by 10%
and not at all by 62%. Eleven percent responded that they
did not know. All participants in the interview study
expressed a continuing awareness and sense of caring for
the child and the parents a long time after the birth.
However, many of them were unaware of the present
health or of the effect on the mother or child. One mid-
wife explained that even now, 12 years after the event,
she would still think about that particular mother and
child when passing through their town. They all described
the fear of being blamed by the parents. Some were not
blamed at all. Others experienced fierce accusations at fol-
low-up meetings between the parents and HCPs or in let-
ters from distraught or bereaved parents.
She [the mother] wrote to me for a long time after. Long,
long, long, evil letters. Full of sorrow, she was so unhappy.
And on the child’s first birthday, or what should have been
the first birthday, I had yet another one of these letters, a last
one. I didn’t open them anymore. I just put them in her
medical records. It was . . . it was distressing. Obstetrician 4
One midwife was openly criticized by the parents in
the local newspaper, naming her “The murderer of Town
X”. Others described a great sense of relief when they
realized that the frustration, grief and anger over the out-
come of the birth was not turned against them.
Clinical peers
A total of 30% worried to a great or to some extent about
what their peers would think of them after the event
(item 8), 34% to a small extent, and 35% not at all. “For

Blame and guilt after traumatic childbirth
 a while after the event I felt shunned by some of my clin-
ical colleagues” (item 5) was experienced to a great or to
some extent by 2%, to a small extent by 6% and not at all
by 90%. Twelve percent strongly agreed or agreed with
“Comments or behavior from one or several colleagues
caused more guilty feelings and/or lower self-esteem”
(item 10) and 87% disagreed or strongly disagreed. In the
interview study, obstetricians in particular were aware of
the possibility of a judgmental atmosphere at the doctors’
morning handover meeting, as a consequence of which
they would carefully contemplate how to present the
course of events during the traumatic birth. Midwives
also considered whether colleagues or management would
view them differently, and for that reason, some found it
difficult to disclose all aspects of the event. In keeping
with the survey data, only a few experienced harsh com-
ments, so the worry of what their peers might have
thought of them was often more prominent than their
experience of judgmental comments or behavior.
It wasn’t very nice. Because then the fingers came (points).
Those invisible fingers, you know? Not that I think that
they [colleagues] really . . . well, accused me, I don’t believe
that they did. It’s more a matter of the feeling I had myself,
because I would look back and think that I could have
done something differently, I could have done something
that might have been better, in retrospect. So that’s the rea-
son why I thought that others must have been thinking the
same. Midwife 8
Some of the participants reflected that well respected col-
leagues were subject to less judgment from peers than
colleagues carrying less professional respect.
Official complaints
The respondents were asked whether they worried about
the possibility of, or an actual official, complaint in item
9, and 10% replied to a great extent, 19% to some extent,
25% to a small extent and 44% not at all. The interview
study demonstrated that worrying about an official com-
plaint was closely related to the type of traumatic birth in
which the participant had been involved. Participants
who blamed themselves for the outcome seemed to have
worried more about receiving a complaint. Not all partic-
ipants had experienced an official complaint, but they all
considered it to be stressful and a psychological burden.
Some explained that it was difficult to “get closure” while
waiting for the ruling of the complaint. A few recorded
that although they were initially relieved following exon-
eration, they did not experience closure and they did not
relinquish their sense of guilt.
. . . of course it was a relief to be exonerated, but I still
thought that . . . It wasn’t like I thought “Oh well. Then it
was nothing.” Because it was still a bad outcome for that
child, right? And the mother still had a terrible experience,
and. . . and I was, at least partially, responsible for what
had happened, right? Midwife 6
Guilt
Half of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed with “In
the beginning I felt guilty that things turned out the way
they did” (item 3), and 36% strongly agreed or agreed
with “I will always feel some sort of guilt when thinking
about the event” (item 4). In the interview study, all par-
ticipants expressed that their sense of guilt was closely
related to their perception of their own impact on the
course of events. Those who had doubts about whether a
different approach might have changed the outcome were
more troubled by guilt, and even more so if an actual
mistake had occurred.
You know,
that feeling that I actually . . . maybe
I
didn’t kill that child, but may have contributed to it.
Obstetrician 2
Most participants described having spent many hours
agonizing and wondering whether they could have pre-
vented the adverse outcome. One midwife said that her
sense of guilt would never disappear because she knew
that the parents would have to live with the consequences
of her handling of the delivery:
. . . I think that, what makes it really hard, is the fact that
(cries) . . . they [the parents] continue to have a disabled
child and all that. It doesn’t go away. Midwife 4

Blame and guilt after traumatic childbirth
K. Schrøder et al.
 Another midwife felt guilty to rejoice over the develop-
ment of her own one-year-old daughter:
. . . because that other woman had had a [child] who more
than likely wouldn’t develop normally, you know? That
was an extremely heavy burden to carry. Midwife 6
Uncertainty as to how to handle guilt was predominant
in most interviews, yet all the participants felt that guilt
was a potential part of their professional life.
We have to live with the fact that we can be guilty of
something . . . I reckon we have to live with it. That we can
be guilty of something. Obstetrician 3
Existential considerations
Five items in the questionnaire were related to this cate-
gory. These items concerned considerations at an existen-
tial level, addressing both professional and personal
implications of the event. Less than 10% replied to a great
or some extent when asked if they had considered leaving
either their profession or their institution because of the
event (item 11 and 12), whereas more than 75% recorded
not at all. Half of the respondents strongly agreed or
agreed with, “The traumatic event has made me think
more about the meaning of life” (item 6). “The event
gave rise to personal development opportunities of an
emotional
and/or
spiritual
character”
(item
2)
was
strongly agreed or agreed by 40%. “I have become a better
midwife or doctor due to my experiences from the trau-
matic birth” (item 1) was strongly agreed or agreed by
65%. When asked what impact the traumatic birth had
had on their lives, some of the participants of the inter-
view study had considered whether they would be capable
of going through a similar ordeal in the future.
Should I really put, not so much other patients, but should
I really put myself through all this? Obstetrician 2
And how much do I really want to be involved in my
career? Is being an obstetrician really that important to me
compared with the risk of causing injury to myself? Obste-
trician 6
One midwife left her profession a few months after the
traumatic birth and another spent several years traveling
and
working
before
returning
to
midwifery.
Some
participants had briefly considered leaving their profes-
sion, but others not at all. However, it was not only the
consideration
of
leaving
their
jobs
which
affected
participants; more personal and existential considerations
were brought to the interview by both obstetricians and
midwives.
I think it’s because it’s something existential. I don’t think
that . . . there will always be a sense of loneliness. Because
it’s about life and death. [. . .] We are dealing with some-
thing bigger than ourselves. And really, it’s also bigger than
the sense of unity we might share on the ward. It’s a differ-
ent dimension. I think it’s something else. And in those
massive existential things that happen in life, whatever it
may be [. . .], I know that we come up short. We just have
to realize that we as human beings are all alone. On this
earth, right? Obstetrician 2
Some participants mentioned positive aspects of per-
sonal development and of becoming a better obstetrician
or midwife. One obstetrician reckoned that she had
become a better doctor, not with respect to her obstetric
skills but by achieving a more humble and profound
understanding of her profession and of life as a whole.
Other participants stated that they felt obliged to learn
from this experience and become a better midwife or
doctor. Correspondingly, most participants recorded that
the traumatic event had made an impact not only at a
professional level, but also on an existential level with
respect to a reconsideration of their own path in life or
by attempting to create meaning from what could have
been a life-shattering event. Some participants included
variations on the statement “the only people it doesn’t
happen to are those who don’t do it” in the process of
making sense of the event, whereas others revolved
around “why did it happen to me?” Common to all par-
ticipants was a sense of uncertainty as to how to address
this aspect of their profession.
Discussion
In this mixed methods study of Danish obstetricians’ and
midwives’ experiences of traumatic childbirth, we found:
(i) fear of being blamed by either the patient, clinical
peers or through official complaints was of considerable
concern to obstetricians and midwives, although few had
actual experiences of such blaming; (ii) feelings of guilt
were reported by 49% of the respondents who had been
involved in a traumatic childbirth and in the interview
study this was described as a psychological burden, even
in cases where no blame was attached; and (iii) the trau-
matic childbirth initiated existential considerations with
respect to the meaning of life (50%) or being subjected
to personal developmental opportunities (40%). Further-
more, 65% felt that they had become a better midwife or
doctor due to the traumatic incident. These results were
supported by the qualitative findings. The vast majority
(76%) did not consider leaving their profession. However,
this consideration was present at some stage among many
interviewees due to concerns about the consequences for

Blame and guilt after traumatic childbirth
 their own health and wellbeing if they were to become
involved in yet another traumatic childbirth.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a
mixed methods study has been conducted on both obste-
tricians’ and midwives’ experiences with blame, guilt and
existential concerns when involved in traumatic child-
birth. The survey includes a national sample of 1027 indi-
viduals, which is a larger study population than any
previous studies. The research design merges the Explana-
tory and Exploratory Sequential Design models described
by Creswell and Plano Clark (23). This merged model
allowed us to investigate the generalizability of themes
that emerged from qualitative data in the pilot study. It
also permitted us to conduct interviews and explore fur-
ther the themes of being blamed, feeling guilty and the
existential considerations of selected participants from the
survey. By using this complementary approach to elabo-
rate, illustrate and clarify the results from one method
with the results from the other method (23), we gained a
more comprehensive understanding of obstetricians’ and
midwives’ existential considerations and experience with
blame and guilt after a traumatic childbirth. To our
knowledge, these themes have not previously been investi-
gated quantitatively.
A limitation of our study is the response rate of 59% to
the questionnaire, which may lead to selection bias, yet this
is considerably higher than previously reported response
rates, which ranged from 5 to 16% (3,14,22). Another con-
cern could be that 60% of the events occurred more than
3 years ago, which may affect the memory and hence the
responses. For the quantitative data we carried out an analy-
sis to see whether the responses differed between the groups
(time since traumatic birth). Due to very low numbers in
some groups, p-values could not be calculated. However,
the overall picture is that responses are similar regardless of
time since the event. In the interview study some partici-
pants found it difficult to remember all the details from the
event or the aftermath, whereas others had vivid recollec-
tions of even the smallest details many years after.
Another limitation is that no comparison was made
between the two professions, their gender, age or senior-
ity and that more sophisticated analyses could have been
conducted on both sets of data. Reporting from a mixed
methods study in the same manuscript will invariably
reduce some of the depth in the presentation, which is a
challenge well described in the mixed-methods literature
(27,28).
It could also be argued that the use of a questionnaire
developed specifically for this study is a limitation of
validity and internal consistency. Conversely, exploring
new concepts sometimes requires new tools and methods,
and each item was carefully constructed based on thor-
ough analysis and interpretation of the pilot study
and the literature. In addition, although our definition
of traumatic childbirth, where the infant or the mother
suffered presumed permanent, severe and possibly fatal
injuries related to the birth, underwent thorough consid-
eration and discussion, it remains a somewhat imprecise
term. The study aimed to explore experiences with blame,
guilt and existential concerns in the aftermath of trau-
matic childbirth, and we found it essential to apply a def-
inition that would allow some subjective interpretation
among the respondents. This was decided to allow
respondents’ to include all traumatic childbirths within
the definition, regardless of possible poor recollection of
details such as Apgar scores, neonatal pH values or other
exact measures, and also to acknowledge individual differ-
ences in experience and perception of trauma and birth
injury. However, such a comprehensive definition is a
limitation
when
interpreting
our
results,
because
it
includes a broad range of diverse events.
Finally, the process of interviewing one’s professional
peers has several implications for the research process
(29). In this case, we found it an advantage to allow the
participants to talk freely, to use medical terminology and
to address serious events, without the concern of dis-
turbing a layperson. The possible disadvantages included
the risk of the participants withholding information for
fear of being judged by a peer, and the potentially impli-
cit mutual understanding during the interview, possibly
preventing the interviewer from pursuing or exploring
certain subjects. The former was addressed by developing
an interview guide that focused on the experience of the
participants, rather than the obstetric “facts” of the event,
and the latter by sharing the reflections of the intervie-
wees among the group of authors throughout the period
of the interviews.
The findings of this study suggest that although few
obstetricians and midwives had had actual experiences of
being blamed by patients or peers, many feared or wor-
ried about blaming in the aftermath of a traumatic child-
birth. Analysis of the distressful accounts of being blamed
by patients or peers provided an understanding of how
devastating such blaming can be and why it is feared by
HCPs. The fear of being blamed by patients, peers or offi-
cial authorities should be viewed in the context of the
vast majority confirming that they were troubled by
memories of what happened to the patient for a long
time after the event. This indicates that obstetricians and
midwives exhibit a high level of genuine care for the
long-term outcome for their patients, regardless of any
blame being placed. In support of this finding is the liter-
ature advocating a blame-free culture in healthcare ser-
vices (10,30) which can be summarized in an often
quoted statement by Donald Berwick, former President
and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement:

Blame and guilt after traumatic childbirth
K. Schrøder et al.
 “Health care workers’ egos can be big. But believe me, their
superegos are a lot bigger” (7, p. 109). The “big superegos”
of the HCPs may explain some of the discrepancy
between fear and actuality of being blamed or judged.
Obstetricians’ and midwives’ high regard of their own
capabilities or lack of acceptance of their fallibilities was
expressed by midwife 8, when she explained how she
attributed her own judgment of herself to her peers,
assuming that they had accused her behind her back,
because she herself felt she could have prevented the out-
come. The participants’ reflections about well-respected
colleagues being subject to less judgment from peers than
colleagues carrying less professional respect indicate that
fallibility is linked to (perceived) level of competence.
Scott et al. has described the significance of coming to
terms with personal reflections such as “what will others
think of me” and “will I ever be trusted again?” when
second victims struggle with restoring personal integrity
after a traumatic event (1). Furthermore, feelings of guilt,
even after official exoneration (midwife 6), indicate that
the harshest judges after adverse events may be the HCPs
themselves. The obstetricians and midwives in our study
were struggling with guilt and self-blame, which was a
consistent finding in both the survey and the interview
study. This inner struggle with issues of guilt and self-
blame has been described by Scott et al. (1), and in a
number of other studies (2,3,8). However, how to cope
or live with these tormented feelings of guilt was associ-
ated with some degree of uncertainty or even despair in
the aftermath of the traumatic event.
Consistent with this, our findings suggest that being
involved in a traumatic childbirth initiated various exis-
tential considerations. To our knowledge, existential con-
siderations of thinking more about the meaning of life
after being involved in a traumatic childbirth have not
been previously explored, but with half of the respon-
dents agreeing to this statement, further investigation is
necessary. As stated by obstetrician 2 “We come up
short” when faced with such existential challenges, and
although most participants expressed an awareness of this
aspect of their profession, they also displayed uncertainty
as to how to address it. Nevertheless, the traumatic child-
birth had given rise to personal development opportuni-
ties of an emotional and/or spiritual character for many
of the respondents, for instance by achieving a more
humble and profound understanding of both professional
roles and of life as a whole. This could be viewed as a
positive consequence leading to growth and possibility –
but primarily it indicates that being involved in a trau-
matic childbirth has an impact on the HCPs at a deeply
personal level. A central finding of existential concern in
other qualitative studies is the perspective of considering
one’s future career and whether to move on to a different
institution or a different profession (1,3,14). Our inter-
view study confirms this as a central issue to some of the
participants. However, our survey showed that leaving
their profession was not at all considered by the majority
(76%), and only considered to a great extent by 4%.
Finally, having become a better obstetrician or midwife
through the experience of the traumatic childbirth was a
predominant finding in this study. This could either be
interpreted as an indication of the respondents’ disposi-
tion to find benefit and posttraumatic growth (31) – that
something good must have emerged from this traumatic
experience – or as an indication of HCPs in fact improv-
ing their skills and competences through such traumatic
learning experiences. The interpretation of adverse events
inevitably leading to a higher educational level of HCPs is
an interesting, albeit controversial, perspective in a mod-
ern patient safety culture.
In conclusion, the fear of being blamed by the patient,
peers or official authorities is of considerable concern to
both obstetricians and midwives after a traumatic child-
birth, even in cases where there is no blame. Self-blame
and guilt appears to dominate when obstetricians and
midwives struggle to cope with the aftermath, which is a
consistent finding regardless of time since the event. This
could indicate that although the current patient safety
programs have promoted a more just and learning culture
with less blaming and shaming, the personal feeling of
guilt remains a burden for the individual HCP. Existential
considerations such as thinking more about the meaning
of life and experiencing personal development opportuni-
ties of an emotional and/or spiritual nature equally seem
to play a profound role in the aftermath. This indicates
that obstetricians and midwives are affected not only pro-
fessionally but also personally when involved in a trau-
matic childbirth. These existential considerations may be
an important part of providing the most adequate sup-
port in the aftermath of traumatic childbirth, and further
research on how to construct such support systems is
required.
