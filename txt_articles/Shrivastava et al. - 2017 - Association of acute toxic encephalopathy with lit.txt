Summary
Background Outbreaks of unexplained illness frequently remain under-investigated. In India, outbreaks of an acute 
neurological illness with high mortality among children occur annually in Muzaffarpur, the country’s largest litchi 
cultivation region. In 2014, we aimed to investigate the cause and risk factors for this illness.
Methods In this hospital-based surveillance and nested age-matched case-control study, we did laboratory 
investigations to assess potential infectious and non-infectious causes of this acute neurological illness. Cases were 
children aged 15 years or younger who were admitted to two hospitals in Muzaffarpur with new-onset seizures or 
altered sensorium. Age-matched controls were residents of Muzaffarpur who were admitted to the same two hospitals 
for a non-neurologic illness within seven days of the date of admission of the case. Clinical specimens (blood, 
cerebrospinal fluid, and urine) and environmental specimens (litchis) were tested for evidence of infectious 
pathogens, pesticides, toxic metals, and other non-infectious causes, including presence of hypoglycin A or 
methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), naturally-occurring fruit-based toxins that cause hypoglycaemia and metabolic 
derangement. Matched and unmatched (controlling for age) bivariate analyses were done and risk factors for illness 
were expressed as matched  odds ratios and odds ratios (unmatched analyses). 
Findings Between May 26, and July 17, 2014, 390 patients meeting the case definition were admitted to the two referral 
hospitals in Muzaffarpur, of whom 122 (31%) died. On admission, 204 (62%) of 327 had blood glucose concentration 
of 70 mg/dL or less. 104 cases were compared with 104 age-matched hospital controls. Litchi consumption (matched 
odds ratio [mOR] 9·6 [95% CI 3·6 – 24]) and absence of an evening meal (2·2 [1·2–4·3]) in the 24 h preceding illness 
onset were associated with illness. The absence of an evening meal significantly modified the effect of eating litchis 
on illness (odds ratio [OR] 7·8 [95% CI 3·3–18·8], without evening meal; OR 3·6 [1·1–11·1] with an evening meal). 
Tests for infectious agents and pesticides were negative. Metabolites of hypoglycin A, MCPG, or both were detected in 
48 [66%] of 73 urine specimens from case-patients and none from 15 controls; 72 (90%) of 80 case-patient specimens 
had abnormal plasma acylcarnitine profiles, consistent with severe disruption of fatty acid metabolism. In 36 litchi 
arils tested from Muzaffarpur, hypoglycin A concentrations ranged from 12·4 µg/g to 152·0 µg/g and MCPG ranged 
from 44·9 µg/g to 220·0 µg/g.
Interpretation Our investigation suggests an outbreak of acute encephalopathy in Muzaffarpur associated with both 
hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity. To prevent illness and reduce mortality in the region, we recommended minimising 
litchi consumption, ensuring receipt of an evening meal and implementing rapid glucose correction for suspected 
illness. A comprehensive investigative approach in Muzaffarpur led to timely public health recommendations, 
underscoring the importance of using systematic methods in other unexplained illness outbreaks.

Introduction
In India, seasonal outbreaks of an acute unexplained 
neurological illness have been reported since 1995 from 
Muzaffarpur, Bihar, the largest litchi (lychee) fruit 
cultivation region in the country.1 These recurring 
outbreaks begin in mid-May and peak in June, coinciding 
with the month-long litchi harvesting season. Children 
from 
poor 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 
in 
rural 
Muzaffarpur comprise most of those affected. Illness is 
characterised by acute seizures and changed mental

status, frequently with onset in the early morning,2 and is 
associated with high mortality. A wide spectrum of causes 
has been proposed for this illness, including infectious 
encephalitis, exposure to pesticides, and a potential 
association with litchi fruit consumption.3–6 Despite 
numerous investigations, neither a cause nor risk factors 
for illness have been confirmed among affected 
individuals.
In 2013, the National Centre for Disease Control, India 
(NCDC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (US CDC) initiated an investigation, focusing 
on characterising the clinical and epidemiological features 
of illness, and assessing potential infectious causes. The 
laboratory investigation found no evidence of a known 
infectious cause, and clinical data indicated that the illness 
was consistent with a non-inflammatory encephalopathy.7 
These results led to consideration of various non-
infectious causes, including pesticides or herbicides used 
to spray orchards and agricultural fields, insecticides used 
in vector-borne disease control efforts, heavy metals, or 
exposure to unusual medications. Notably, a common 
laboratory finding was low blood glucose (<70 mg/dL) on 
admission, which was also associated with increased 
mortality. These findings focused our attention on the 
possibility that children in Muzaffarpur were exposed to 
an environmental toxin, which resulted in low blood 
glucose and, subsequently, seizures and encephalopathy. 
Published reports of a toxic hypoglycaemic syndrome 
in the West Indies8–10 that was due to the effects of 
hypoglycin A, a toxin found in the ackee, which is a fruit 
in the same botanical family as litchi, raised the prospect 
of a litchi-associated toxin. Of specific interest was the 
potential role of methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), a 
homologue of hypoglycin A, and a substance naturally 
found in the litchi seed and fruit known to cause 
hypoglycaemia in animal studies by inhibiting β-oxidation 
of fatty acids and gluconeogenesis.3,6,11,12 We aimed to 
investigate the cause and risk factors for this illness.
Methods
Study design
In 2014, NCDC and US CDC investigated this syndrome, 
using hospital-based clinical surveillance, an epidemio-
logical case-control study, and comprehensive and novel 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between Jan 30, and April 30, 2013, 
before our 2013 field investigation, for any studies related to the 
acute unexplained neurological illness in Muzaffarpur using the 
search terms “Muzaffarpur,” AND (“encephalitis” OR 
“encephalopathy” OR “seizure.”) This identified two articles that 
suggested potential causes for the outbreak illness varying from 
Japanese Encephalitis virus, another unknown virus, to heat 
stroke. Following the results of our 2013 investigation, which 
suggested hypoglycaemia might be an important factor in 
illness, and raised the possibility of a toxic origin, we repeated a 
PubMed search in December, 2013, using terms (“ackee 
hypoglycin” OR “ackee encephalopathy” OR “glycine analog 
AND litchi” OR “litchi encephalopathy” or “litchi 
methylenecyclopropylglycine” (MCPG), OR “Jamaican vomiting 
sickness”) for studies describing an association between litchis, 
ackee fruit, hypoglycin, MCPG and acute neurologic illness 
published between Jan 1, 1954, and Dec 1, 2013. We found 
61 studies; 11 described cases or outbreaks of ackee fruit 
poisoning which implicated hypoglycin toxicity; an additional 
11 studies described the pathophysiology of hypoglycin A in 
animal models, and five described methods to characterise 
hypoglycin A in ackee fruits. An ecological study from 2012 from 
Vietnam indicated an association between litchi plantation 
surface area and acute encephalitis incidence. A study from 
1962 described the isolation of MCPG in litchi seeds, and 
two studies from 1989 and 1991 described the hypoglycaemic 
effect of MCPG in animal studies. No studies implicated a direct 
epidemiological association between litchi consumption in 
affected individuals and encephalopathy. No studies showed 
hypoglycin or MCPG or their metabolites in affected individuals.
Added value of this study
This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest 
investigation of the Muzaffarpur outbreak and the first 
comprehensive confirmation that this recurring outbreak illness 
is associated with litchi consumption and toxicity from both 
hypoglycin A and MCPG. We confirm the presence of MCPG and 
hypoglycin in litchis, and, for the first time, our data show the 
metabolites of these toxins in human biological specimens, the 
biological impact of these toxins on human metabolism, and 
the modifying effect of the lack of an evening meal on the 
impact of these toxins.
Implications of all the available evidence
Based on the results of our investigation, public health and 
clinical recommendations targeted at preventing illness and 
reducing morbidity and mortality from the Muzaffarpur 
outbreak illness were provided to state and national health 
authorities. This included recommendations to minimise litchi 
consumption among young children in the affected area, to 
ensure that children receive an evening meal throughout the 
outbreak period, and to rapidly assess and correct 
hypoglycaemia in any child suspected of having the outbreak 
illness. Evaluation of other potential factors, including missed 
evening meal, poor nutritional status, and as yet unidentified 
genetic differences, may provide further insights into additional 
risk factors for this outbreak illness. Application of a similar 
comprehensive and systematic approach to the evaluation of 
both infectious and non-infectious aetiologies of unexplained 
illness outbreaks in other parts of the world has the potential to 
contribute toward identifying interventions that can reduce 
morbidity and mortality.

laboratory testing methods on human biological and 
environmental specimens to determine risk factors 
associated with this illness, assess the aetiological role of 
naturally occurring toxins such as MCPG and hypoglycin, 
and exclude the role of novel infectious pathogens, 
selected pesticides, and toxic elements.
Hospital-based clinical surveillance
Surveillance was done at the Shri Krishna Medical College 
Hospital (SKMCH) and the Krishnadevi Deviprasad 
Kejriwal Maternity Hospital (KDKMH), the chief referral 
medical centers in Muzaffarpur district, India.
A case was defined as new-onset seizures or altered 
sensorium in the previous seven days in a child aged 
15 years or younger admitted to either SKMCH or 
KDKMH. Patients admitted for febrile seizures, defined 
as a seizure in a child 6 months to 6 years whose only 
finding is fever, and a single generalised convulsion of 
less than 15 min duration who recovers consciousness 
within 60 min of the seizure13 were excluded. Ill children 
who met the case definition and were admitted at either 
of the two referral hospitals in Muzaffarpur were 
prospectively enrolled. Demographic and clinical data 
were collected with standardised questionnaires.
According to district level clinical guidelines, a 
patient’s blood glucose was assessed at presentation, 
ideally before administration of any treatment; treating 
clinicians provided intravenous dextrose therapy to all 
patients suspected to have the outbreak illness. Lumbar 
puncture was done according to the clinician’s decision; 
cytological (white blood cell [WBC] count) and 
biochemical (protein and glucose) examination were 
done on collected CSF specimens. Blood and urine 
specimens were collected on all enrolled patients at the 
time of admission. Detailed neurological examination 
was done within 12 h of admission on a subset of case-
patients. Brain MRI (including fluid attenuation 
inversion recovery [FLAIR] sequence) and EEG 
diagnostic testing, not normally available at the treating 
hospitals, were done when possible.
Case-control study
Every alternate surveillance case-patient who survived at 
least 6 h beyond the time of admission was prospectively 
enrolled in an age-matched case control study if he or she 
was a resident of Muzaffarpur district. We calculated a 
sample size of 100 cases and 200 controls, assuming 
80% power, 50% exposure of the key risk factors among 
controls, and ratio of controls to cases of 2:1. Due to a 
rapid increase in cases and restricted human resources, 
enrolment was modified on June 16, 2014, to every fourth 
eligible case-patient to attain the calculated sample size 
and have continuous enrolment throughout the outbreak 
period. For each case, we initially enrolled one community 
control and one hospital control within 7 days of case 
enrolment. In view of the overall homogeneity of rural 
Muzaffarpur and the ubiquitous nature of the variables of 
interest, including litchi orchards and litchis, we were 
concerned about the possibility of overmatching. To 
prevent this, both community (adjacent village) and 
hospital controls (any other village) were selected from 
villages other than the case-patients; the community 
controls were subsequently assessed to still be over-
matched and were thus dropped from the analysis. A 
hospital control was defined as a resident of Muzaffarpur 
district who was admitted to one of the surveillance 
hospitals for a non-neurological illness within 7 days of 
the date of admission of the case. Children who had a 
history of altered mental status or seizures in the previous 
3 months were excluded as controls. For case-patients 
younger than 5 years, hospital controls were age-matched 
to within 6 months of age; for case-patients who were 
5 years or older, controls were age-matched to within 
12 months of age. Informed consent was obtained from 
parents or guardians.
Cases and controls were asked about consumption of 
food items, food washing, water sources, and other 
exposures, including time spent in agricultural fields. 
Standardised 
data 
for 
household 
characteristics, 
ownership of household assets or goods, and land were 
collected to calculate a socioeconomic index (SEI) 
according to the methods of the National Family Health 
Survey, a large-scale, multiround survey undertaken 
throughout India by the Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare.14,15 Data for both case and controls were 
systematically 
collected 
using 
standardised 
questionnaires. Bodyweight (kg) and body height or 
length (cm) were measured for each enrolled case and 
control. A child was defined as wasted if the Z score was 
more than 2 SD below WHO Child Growth Standards16 
of calculated body-mass index (BMI; children ≥5 years of 
age) or weight for height (children <5 years of age), and 
stunted if the Z score was more than 2 SD 
below the same standards of calculated BMI (children 
≥5 years of age) or height for age (children <5 years of 
age). Additionally, urine and blood specimens were 
collected from each enrolled control. Each case-patient 
and control household was visited to collect data for 
observed exposures.
Environmental specimen collection
Between May 19, and June 13, 2014, litchi fruit samples 
were collected from orchards in the five blocks of 
Muzaffarpur district with the highest reported number of 
cases in 2013 and 2014. In each block, six or more fruits 
were collected in each of the following categories: unripe, 
ripe plucked from tree, and ripe fallen on the ground. 
Each fruit was stored at –20°C within 3 h of collection and 
subsequently transferred to –70°C until analysis.
Laboratory testing
CSF and serum specimens from case-patients were tested 
at NCDC using PCR for viruses, including Japanese 
encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and enteroviruses.7 A

subset of case-patient CSF and serum specimens collected 
in both the 2013 and 2014 investigations was submitted for 
assessment of additional infectious agents, including 
potential novel pathogens, to the US CDC Pathogen 
Discovery Laboratory (Atlanta, GA, USA;17,18 appendix p 4). 
Blood 
and 
urine 
specimens 
of 
cases 
from 
2014 
were 
examined 
at the US CDC for metabolites of pesticides and toxic 
elements using established mass spectrometry methods.19–23 
At the National Institute of Occupational Health, India 
(NIOH), red blood cell acetylcholinesterase and plasma 
butyryl cholinesterase activity were measured24 (appendix 
p 5), and litchi fruit samples were analysed for pesticide 
residues using the Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and 
Safe method25 (appendix p 8). A novel assay was developed 
at US CDC to analyse case and control specimens 
from 2013 and 2014 for metabolites of hypoglycin A 
and MCPG using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry.26 Plasma acylcarnitine and quantitative and 
qualitative urine organic acid profiles were assessed at the 
Emory Genetics Laboratory (Atlanta, GA, USA) using 
established mass spectrometry methods27–31 to identify 
evidence of derangement in fatty acid metabolism, which 
was postulated to occur in the case of MCPG or hypoglycin 
A toxicity as a result of impaired β-oxidation11,12,32 (appendix 
p 9). Laboratory scientists were blinded to case or control 
designation of the specimens under assessment. In a 
collaboration between the US Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) and the US CDC, a quantitative assay was designed 
to assess MCPG and hypoglycin A content in soapberry 
arils33 (appendix p 10).
Ethical approval
Ethical approval for this investigation and case-control 
study was obtained from the institutional review boards 
of NCDC and the US CDC. Written informed consent 
was obtained in the local language (Hindi) from the 
parent or guardian of each child enrolled. While 
laboratory testing on collected case-patient CSF 
specimens was done as part of the investigation, the 
decision of whether or not to collect CSF was solely made 
by the treating physician based on his or her clinical 
judgment. Participants and their parents or guardians 
were informed that some laboratory test results would 
only be available months later, and, although not of 
specific immediate benefit to the participating child, 
could help health officials to understand the cause of the 
outbreak, and thus benefit the community. In 2015, when 
final laboratory results were available from NCDC and 
US CDC, these results were communicated to district 
health officials and treating clinicians who conveyed 
them to participating families.
Statistical analysis
Data were entered in Epi-Info version 7
.0 (CDC, Atlanta, 
GA, USA) and analysed with Stata version 13.0 (Stata, 
College Station, Texas, USA) and SAS/STAT software 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). Matched 
bivariate analyses as well as unmatched bivariate analyses 
controlling for age were done; risk factors for illness 
expressed as matched odds ratios (mOR; matched 
analysis) and odds ratios (OR; unmatched analysis) with 
95% CI. Potential interactions between exposures were 
examined in stratified analyses, controlled for age. A 
p value less than 0·05 was considered significant.
Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in study design; in the 
collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; in the 
writing of the report; or in the decision to submit the 
paper for publication. The corresponding author had 
full access to all the data in the study and all authors 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Between May 26, and July 17, 2014, 390 patients meeting 
the case definition were admitted to the two referral 
hospitals in Muzaffarpur. Among these, 213 (55%) were 
boys, median age was 4 years (range 6 months–14 years), 
and 280 (72%) were aged 1–5 years (table 1). Among case-
patients with recorded measurements, 11 (16%) of 68 were 
classified as wasted and 46 (65%) of 71 were classified as 
stunted. Most patients (273; 70%) were from Muzaffarpur 
district; cases were reported from all 16 blocks of 
Muzaffarpur district. Clustering of cases was not observed; 
each affected child seemed to be an isolated case in a village 
(approximate population per village 2500). The outbreak 
peaked in mid-June, with 147 cases reported during 
June 8–14, 2014, and declined substantially after 
June 21, 2014 (figure).

symptoms less than 24 h before admission. Further, 
224 (66%) of 342 patients with recorded data reported 
illness onset between 0300 h and 0800 h. Of patients 
with recorded data, 326 (94%) of 348 reported one or 
more seizures and 345 (95%) of 362 reported altered 
mental status before admission; 301 (87%) of 347 patients 
were unconscious on presentation. Seizure semiology 
was characterised by intermittent generalised tonic or 
tonic-clonic seizures; duration and frequency of the 
seizures varied (appendix p 10). Several patients had 
convulsive 
or 
non-convulsive 
status 
epilepticus. 
Vomiting was reported in 59 (18%) of 337 patients with 
recorded data. Of 357 patients with recorded admission 
measurements, the median temperature was 37·2°C 
(99°F; range 35·6–40·6), and 219 (61%) were afebrile 
(≤37·5°C [≤99·5°C]). Among 386 patients with recorded 
data, 122 died (case fatality rate 32%).
On detailed clinical assessment of 52 patients, 48 (92%) 
showed no focal neurological deficits. Brain MRI of 
16 patients showed no focal lesions, signal abnormalities, 
or changes suggestive of inflammation; eight patients 
(50%) showed mild to moderate cerebral oedema. 
Clinical severity did not noticeably differ between 
participants with and without cerebral oedema. EEG in 
30 cases showed findings consistent with generalised 
encephalopathy in 22 (73%); seven showed epileptiform 
discharges. Of 62 patients with CSF collected for analysis, 
52 (84%) had normal WBC counts (<0·5 × 10⁶ cells per L), 
58 (94%) had normal protein (<450 mg/L), and 49 (79%) 
had normal glucose (>2·50 mmol/L) concentrations. Of 
327 patients with blood glucose measurement on 
admission, the median blood glucose level was 
2·66 mmol/L (range 0·44–23·98), and 100 (31%) patients 
had glucose concentration of 1·67 mmol/L or less, 
171 (52%) patients had glucose concentration of 
2·78 mmol/L or less, and 204 (62%) patients had glucose 
concentrations of 3·89 mmol/L or less. Of 349 patients 
with available information, 239 (69%) had a record of 
receiving dextrose therapy during hospital stay; of these, 
173 (73%) survived.
Of 331 patients with recorded data, 149 (45%) were 
referred from another health-care facility, such as a 
primary health centre or private clinic; the remainder 
presented directly to the referral hospitals. In a 
multivariable model controlling for hypoglycaemia, 
presence of fever on admission, and receipt of dextrose 
therapy during hospital stay, patients referred to the 
hospital from another health facility were twice as likely 
to die as those who came directly to the referral hospital 
(OR 2·3 [95% CI 1·2–4·1]).
Between June 1, and July 10, 2014, 104 cases and 
104 age-matched hospital controls were enrolled. 
Exposures that were significantly associated with illness 
on 
matched 
bivariate 
analysis 
included 
litchi 
consumption (matched odds ratio [mOR] 9·6 [95% CI 
3·8–24·1]), visiting a fruit orchard (6·0 [2·7–13·4]), and 
absence of an evening meal (defined as eating the last 
[non-litchi] meal before 1900 h; mOR 2·2 [95% CI 
1·2–4·3]) in the 24 h preceding illness onset (table 2), 
and were similar to what was noted in unmatched 
bivariate analyses controlled for age (appendix p 11). 
Calculated socioeconomic index did not differ between 
cases and controls (mOR 1·4 [95% CI 0·8–2·4]); 
routinely washing vegetables and fruits (mOR 0·1 
[0·05–0·4) could be protective. Among those who 
consumed litchis, cases were more likely to eat unripe 
litchis (mOR 7·9 [95% CI 1·1–347·0), eat rotten litchis 
(7·4 [1·5–69·8]), report eating litchis from the ground 
versus from the tree (22 cases vs no controls), and 
report eating partially eaten litchis (17 cases vs no 
controls).
Other factors, including biting, eating, or chewing the 
litchi seed and peeling or eating the litchi peel were not 
associated with illness (data not shown). Similarly, no 
association was noted between illness and consumption 
of raw vegetables or medications, drinking water source, 
or exposure to insecticides or chemicals sprayed in and 
around the house or nearby fields or orchards (data not 
shown). For children younger than 5 years, mean Z scores 
for height for age (–2·85 [cases] vs –2·18 [controls], 
p=0·12) and weight for height (0·00 [cases] vs 
–1·00 [controls], p=0·08) did not significantly differ 
between cases and controls. Among children older than

differ 
significantly 
between 
cases 
and 
controls 
(–0·81 [cases] vs –1·90 [controls], p=0·08).
On stratified analysis controlled for age, the absence of 
an evening meal in the previous 24 h significantly 
modified the relation between litchi consumption and 
illness (OR 7·8 [95% CI 3·3–18·8], without evening 
meal; OR 3·6 [95% CI 1·1–11·1] with evening meal).
At NCDC, laboratory diagnostic testing of 17 CSF 
specimens for Japanese encephalitis virus and West 
Nile virus virus by PCR, and an additional 12 CSF 
specimens with an 11-virus multiplex PCR platform 
assay were negative. Pan-viral family or genus PCRs and 
sequencing of 40 CSF and 40 serum samples at US CDC 
showed one CSF sample and one serum sample (from 
two different patients) were positive for Adenovirus 41. 
A separate CSF specimen tested positive for a divergent 
rhabdovirus. All other samples were negative for all 
assays tested.
No pattern of excessive pesticide or metal exposures 
was identified in 80 case-patient specimens examined at 
US CDC. No abnormality in acetylcholinesterase or 
butyrylcholinesterase activity levels was detected in the 
specimens of 27 patients examined at NIOH. Additionally, 
no pesticide residue was detected in 14 litchi samples 
assessed at NIOH.
Among 73 case-patient urine specimens assessed, 
47 (64%) contained metabolites of hypoglycin A 
(MCPA-Gly), 33 (45%) contained metabolites of MCPG 
(MCPF-Gly), and 32 (44%) specimens contained both 
metabolites. 
Creatinine-corrected 
concentrations 
of 
MCPF-Gly and MCPA-Gly were determined for each 
sample as µg of metabolite per g of creatinine (µg/g-cr). 
For MCPF-Gly, the 33 positive samples ranged from 
0·289 to 6·80 × 10³ µg/g-cr, with a median of 
1·22 × 10³ µg/g-cr. For MCPA-Gly, the 47 positive samples 
ranged from 0·0402 to 1·89 × 10⁴ µg/g-cr, with a median 
of 2·63 × 10³ µg/g-cr (table 3). On assessment, 67 (89%) of 
75 specimens showed abnormal urinary organic acid 
profiles and 72 (90%) of 80 specimens had abnormal 
plasma acylcarnitine profiles, consistent with severe 
disruption of fatty acid metabolism. None of the 15 control 
specimens tested showed abnormal urinary organic acid 
profiles nor tested positive for reportable concentrations 
of either the hypoglycin A or MCPG metabolite.
Of 36 litchi arils analysed from Muzaffarpur, observed 
concentrations ranged from 12·4 µg/g to 152·0 µg/g 
hypoglycin A and 44·9 µg/g to 220·0 µg/g MCPG 
(table 4). Within each batch tested, the unripe fruit 
contained higher concentrations of both MCPG and 
hypoglycin A than did the ripe fruit.
Discussion
Although an association with MCPG has been previously 
proposed,2,3,34 and MCPG has been detected in the seed 
and aril of the litchi,6,35 this is the first confirmation that 
this recurring outbreak in Muzaffarpur is associated with 
litchi consumption and both hypoglycin A and MCPG 
toxicity. This conclusion is supported by clinical findings 
consistent with an acute toxic encephalopathy, significant 
epidemiological association between litchi consumption 
and illness, laboratory results that show, for the first time 
to our knowledge, the presence of hypoglycin A and 
MCPG metabolites, and evidence of resultant metabolic 
derangement in the biological specimens of cases but 
not controls, and the confirmation of these toxins in 
litchi fruits. The absence of clinical, epidemiological, or 
laboratory findings to support infectious pathogen, 
pesticide, and heavy metal related causes of illness 
suggest the observed protective association of routinely 
washing fruit or vegetables was not directly related to a 
toxin or infectious agent.
Findings of organic acid and acylcarnitine analysis 
showed evidence of disruption of several dehydrogenase 
enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, similar to profiles 
observed in glutaric acidemia type II, an inherited 
metabolic disorder with a panethnic prevalence that is less 
than 1:100 000.36 However, the temporal and spatial 
concentration of case-patients observed in this outbreak is 
inconsistent with this specific genetic cause. Furthermore, 
similar abnormal urinary organic acid profiles (increased 
ethylmalonic acid, glutaric acid, and adipic acid) have been 
reported in ackee fruit encephalopathy outbreaks,10,37 
further supporting that the changes observed in patients in 
Muzaffarpur are a result of disrupted fatty acid metabolism 
due to hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity. The acidosis 
resulting from accumulation of certain fatty acids might

have further contributed to clinical encephalopathy, which 
could explain symptoms and signs observed even among 
patients without documented hypoglycaemia, an event 
that has also been reported in ackee fruit encephalopathy.38 
Limitations in the ability to provide aggressive critical care, 
including closer respiratory monitoring and mechanical 
ventilation, probably contributed to mortality among 
affected children, despite the administration of dextrose 
supplementation. Our findings support the need to 
strengthen clinical intensive care capacity at the treating 
hospitals in Muzaffarpur.
Our analyses indicate that the absence of an evening 
meal modified the association between litchi consumption 
and illness. Parents in affected villages report that during 
May and June, young children frequently spend their day 
eating litchis in the surrounding orchards; many return 
home in the evening uninterested in eating a meal. 
Skipping an evening meal is likely to result in night-time 
hypoglycaemia, particularly in young children who have 
limited hepatic glycogen reserves, which would normally 
trigger β-oxidation of fatty acids for energy production and 
gluconeogenesis.39,40 However, in the setting of hypoglycin 
A/MCPG toxicity, fatty acid metabolism is disrupted and 
glucose synthesis is severely impaired,11,12,41 which can lead 
to the characteristic acute hypoglycaemia and encephalo-
pathy of the outbreak illness. The association between 
illness and the absence of an evening meal could explain 
the early morning onset of symptoms noted in most 
patients, and supports recommendations to ensure that 
children receive a night-time meal throughout the 
outbreak period. The important interaction between litchi 
consumption and the absence of an evening meal also 
contributes toward an understanding of why only some 
children in Muzaffarpur develop this acute encephalopathy. 
Although litchi fruits are ubiquitous in the orchards 
surrounding the villages in rural Muzaffarpur, typically 
only one child in an entire village develops this acute 
illness. The synergistic combination of litchi consumption, 
a missed evening meal, and other potential factors such as 
poor nutritional status, eating a greater number of litchis, 
and as yet unidentified genetic differences might be 
needed to produce this illness.
Although our findings show an association between 
hypoglycin A/MCPG toxicity, litchi consumption, and 
this outbreak illness, causality is considerably more 
difficult to establish. Assessment of our results using the 
Bradford Hill criteria for causation42 showed that seven of 
nine criteria are met: 1) strength of association (large 
ORs for consumption of litchi, modified by presence or 
absence of evening meal); 2) consistency (clinical 
findings shown in both 2013 and 2014, and MCPG 
detected in litchi fruit previously); 3) specificity (specific 
population, primarily young children, at a specific 
location, Muzaffarpur, affected, and no clear evidence for 
any other cause; 4) temporality (illness follows the litchi 
harvest season); 5) plausibility (biological mechanism for 
MCPG/hypoglycin A toxicity leading to the observed 
metabolic derangements and clinical manifestations); 
6) coherence between the laboratory and epidemiological 
findings; and 7) analogy (similar reports and findings in 
outbreaks of toxic encephalopathy due to ackee, a fruit in 
the same botanical family as litchi). Based on these 
observations, we conclude that our findings reflect a 
plausible, but not necessarily sufficient, causal pathway 
between litchi consumption and illness.
Within India, an outbreak of a similar acute neurological 
illness with hypoglycaemia and seizures was reported in 
June, 2014, among young children in Malda, a litchi 
cultivation district in West Bengal.43 In southeast Asia, 
outbreaks of similar acute neurological illnesses have also 
been reported from litchi-growing areas of Bangladesh 
and Vietnam.44,45 These outbreaks have not been similarly 
comprehensively investigated. The investigation in 
Bangladesh focused on the possibility that pesticides 
used seasonally in litchi orchards might be involved, but 
no specific pesticide was implicated. The investigation in 
Vietnam focused on possible infectious agents that might 
be present seasonally near litchi fruit plantations, but 
found none to explain the outbreak. Our investigations 
also thoroughly explored the possibilities of pesticide and 
heavy metal related toxicity but found no clinical, 
epidemiological, or laboratory evidence to support this. 
Detailed assessments of infectious causes, including for 
viral pathogens known to cause encephalitis in the region 
as well as for potential novel infectious agents, were also 
consistently negative. The findings of our investigations 
might help to shed light on the cause of illness in the 
Bangladesh and Vietnam outbreaks.
At a broader level, the Muzaffarpur outbreak is illustrative 
of unexplained public health threats in resource-
constrained settings, whether localised or regional, that are 
frequently under-investigated. The application of a 
comprehensive multisectoral investigation in Muzaffarpur, 
with the combined inputs of clinicians, epidemiologists, 
laboratory scientists, environmental specialists, and 
medical toxicologists enabled the methodical exclusion of 
infectious pathogens, the consideration of potential 
environmental causes that had not previously been 
systematically assessed, and the comprehensive testing of 
both environmental and human specimens to investigate 
and confirm a postulated association between litchi fruits, 
hypoglycin A/MCPG, and illness that led to timely public 
health recommendations to prevent illness and reduce 
mortality.46 
Using 
similar 
systematic 
investigation 
methods, both in other countries affected by similar 
outbreaks as well as in other settings of unexplained illness 
has major potential to contribute toward improving public 
health response.
Quantitative evaluation of a small number of litchi arils 
(edible fruit) collected in Muzaffarpur indicated 
approximately twice the level of detected hypoglycin A, as 
well as MCPG in unripe versus ripe fruits. This finding 
is in contrast with what is seen in ackee fruit, where the 
concentration of hypoglycin A in unripe fruits is more

than 20 times higher than that observed in ripe fruits.47,48 
A larger quantitative evaluation of hypoglycin A and 
MCPG concentrations in different cultivars as well as 
several stages of maturation is needed to better evaluate 
this question. If substantial differences in the 
concentrations of these compounds are consistently 
detected in different stages of litchis, public health 
prevention recommendations regarding litchi fruit 
consumption can be further refined.
This study was subject to two major limitations. First, 
determination of whether litchi fruit had been consumed 
before symptom onset relied upon reported information 
from the parent or caregiver of the child, who might not 
have been with the child during consumption. However, 
both cases and controls were ill and in hospital and 
queried about exposures before admission to hospital; 
we, therefore, expect that both groups would have been 
equally likely to report exposures such as food 
consumption, thereby minimising the potential for 
differential misclassification. Additionally, the absence of 
difference in socioeconomic status, as well as the overall 
homogeneity observed throughout the 16 blocks of 
Muzaffarpur district, suggests that both groups would be 
presented with equal opportunity for exposure to 
variables of interest. Second, although our protocol 
required control interview and specimen collection 
within a 7 day window of the matched case, this was not 
always possible and some delays occurred.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first comprehensive confirmation that this recurring 
outbreak of acute encephalopathy is associated with both 
hypoglycin 
A 
and 
MCPG 
toxicity 
from 
litchi 
consumption. This illness is also associated with absence 
of an evening meal. To prevent illness and save lives in 
Muzaffarpur, we recommended46 minimising litchi 
consumption among young children, ensuring children 
in the area receive an evening meal throughout the 
outbreak season, and implementing rapid glucose 
correction for children with suspected illness. Application 
of a similar comprehensive and systematic approach to 
the assessment of both infectious and non-infectious 
causes of unexplained illness outbreaks in other parts of 
the world can contribute greatly toward identifying 
interventions that can reduce morbidity and mortality.
