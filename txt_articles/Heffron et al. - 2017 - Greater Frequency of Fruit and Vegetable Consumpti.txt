F
ruits and vegetables (F&V) have long been regarded 
as essential to a healthy diet. The US Department 
of Agriculture/US Health and Human Services Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans recommend the consumption of 
at least 4.5 cups of F&V combined daily.1,2 Despite multiple 
public education campaigns, few American adults report con-
suming F&V at suggested levels.3 Furthermore, particular 
groups, including men, members of ethnic minorities, and 
those with low socioeconomic status average lower levels of 
consumption.4–8
Formal recommendations related to F&V consumption 
owe partly to observed associations of the foods with reduced 
risk of cancer (associations recent prospective studies have 
found to be much weaker than earlier research suggested9) 
and overall mortality.10,11 Findings of benefit with F&V con-
sumption have been more congruous in cardiovascular dis-
ease, although there are suggestions of differences by vascular 
territory. For example, inverse associations of F&V intake 
with coronary heart disease have been regularly observed,11,12 
although smaller studies have failed to show significant cor-
relations.13 Reductions in risk of stroke are consistent,14 and 
potentially of greater magnitude than for coronary heart dis-
ease.15 Finally, a recent study of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
found an inverse association of the condition with fruit, but 
not with vegetable, consumption.16
Despite the wealth of investigation into dietary composi-
tion and coronary heart disease and stroke risk, there has been 
limited investigation on dietary composition and peripheral 
artery disease (PAD), leading to calls for assessment of dietary 
components as they relate specifically to PAD.17 Recently, an 
intervention to encourage adherence to a Mediterranean diet 
pattern was demonstrated to successfully reduce incident 
PAD.18 However, the intervention did not focus on F&V, and 
intake of these foods did not significantly differ between treat-
ment and control groups, so a role for these specific foods in 
PAD prevention could not be assessed. With this in mind, we

Objective—Although fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease and 
stroke, its association with peripheral artery disease (PAD) is less certain. We, thus, sought to characterize F&V intake 
and investigate the association between F&V consumption and presence of PAD in a large community sample.
Approach and Results—Self-referred participants at >20 000 US sites who completed medical and lifestyle questionnaires were 
evaluated by screening ankle brachial indices for PAD (ankle brachial index ≤0.9). Among 3 696 778 individuals, mean age 
was 64.1±10.2 years and 64.1% were female. Daily consumption of ≥3 servings of F&V was reported by 29.2%. Increasing 
age, female sex, white race, never smoking, being currently married, physical activity, increasing income, and frequent 
consumption of fish, nuts, and red meat were positively associated with daily consumption of F&V. After multivariable 
adjustment, there was a stepwise inverse association between F&V intake and PAD. Participants reporting daily intake of 
≥3 servings of F&V had 18% lower odds of PAD than those reporting less than monthly consumption. In unadjusted and 
multivariable-adjusted models, the inverse association with F&V became stronger as ankle brachial index decreased. When 
stratified by smoking status, the association was present only among those subjects who currently or formerly smoked tobacco.
Conclusions—Our study demonstrates an inverse association of F&V consumption with prevalent PAD and overall low 
F&V consumption. These observations suggest the need to further efforts to increase F&V consumption and for more 
rigorous evaluation of the role of F&V in PAD prevention.

of nearly 3.7 million American adults. We secondarily sought 
to study reported F&V consumption in this sample.

Supplement.
Results
Among 3 696 778 unique individuals, mean age was 64.1±10.2 
years, 64.1% were female, and 89.1% were white. There were 
233 958 (6.3%) cases of PAD as defined by ankle brachial 
index (ABI) ≤0.9 or history of lower extremity revasculariza-
tion procedure. As noted previously, the prevalence of differ-
ent cardiovascular risk factors in this sample was similar to 
that of the general US adult population.19 Characteristics of 
the respondents categorized by reported frequency of F&V 
consumption are presented in Table 1. Nearly half of the sam-
ple reported consuming at least 3 servings of F&V on fewer 
than half the days of a week.
F&V Consumption
The proportion of participants reporting daily consumption of 
at least 3 servings of F&V daily differed markedly by age, 
sex, and race/ethnicity (Figure IA and IB in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Older white women were most likely to 
consume ≥3 servings of F&V daily. In contrast, younger black 
men were the least likely to report daily consumption of ≥3 
servings of F&V.
There was notable variation in F&V consumption fre-
quency by region (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement) 
and state (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement) of 
residence, and mean income of zip code provided by the 
respondent (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
The Pacific region had the greatest proportion of respondents 
reporting intake of at least 3 servings of F&V on most days 
of the week, whereas less than half of subjects from South 
Central states reported consumption on most days of the week. 
The least frequent daily consumption of F&V was reported in 
Mississippi (21.5%), Louisiana (22.0%), Oklahoma (23.5%), 
Arkansas (24.0%), and Alabama (24.7%).
We built a logistic regression model to assess which of the 
16 variables listed in Materials and Methods were predictive 
of daily intake of at least 3 servings of F&V. Increasing age, 
female sex, nonsedentary lifestyle, increasing income, and fre-
quent consumption (most days of the week) of fish, nuts, and 
red meat were positively associated with daily consumption of 
F&V. Non-white race, current or former smoking, being cur-
rently unmarried, and frequent consumption of fast food were 
inversely associated with daily intake of at least 3 servings of 
F&V (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement). The area 
under the receiver operating curve of this model was 0.693. 
The P value for goodness of fit testing was 0.59.
Peripheral Arterial Disease
After multivariable adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnic-
ity, and clinical risk factors, a stepwise inverse association 
between F&V intake with the prevalence of PAD was apparent 
(Table 2, Figure [A], P for trend <0.001). Additional adjust-
ment for income and dietary components other than F&V 
resulted in minimal attenuation of the association (P for good-
ness of fit=0.12). The association persisted, but was found to 
be slightly more pronounced in men (P<0.01) when adjusted 
analyses were stratified by sex (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Stratification of the sample by cigarette smok-
ing status (current, former, and never) demonstrated that the 
inverse association of increasing F&V consumption with PAD 
was limited to subjects who currently or formerly smoked 
(Table 3).
Among all subjects with abnormal 
ABI, 73.2% (n=121 389) 
had ABI 0.9–0.7, 19.7% (n=32 648) had ABI 0.7–0.5, and 
7.1% (n=11 717) had ABI <0.5. The inverse association with 
F&V intake was stronger with decreasing ABI in both crude 
and multivariable-adjusted models (Figure [B]).
Discussion
We present data from a self-referred sample of ≈1.6% of 
all American adults in which we observed an association of 
greater frequency of consumption of F&V with lower odds 
of prevalent PAD defined by abnormal ABI or history of pre-
vious lower extremity revascularization, but that a minor-
ity of participants reported consuming at least 3 servings of 
F&V on a daily basis. Our adjusted analyses demonstrated 
a stepwise reduction in odds for PAD with increasing con-
sumption of F&V—associations which were stronger with 
increasingly abnormal ABI. Notably, this association was 
restricted to people who were current or former cigarette 
smokers.
Unfortunately, our findings about F&V consumption 
are in agreement with those of other, smaller surveys. 
Data from the 2007 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (NHANES) suggest that <20% of 
adult Americans consume F&V at the US Department 
of Agriculture’s recommended levels,8 with even lower 
prevalence found by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.7 
In our sample, 29.2% of subjects reported daily intake of 
at least 3 servings of F&V daily, with just over half report-
ing this degree of consumption on most days of the week. 
Our state-level data are also similar to that reported by the 
Centers for Disease Control,20 in which individuals living 
in Southern states reported less frequent F&V consumption 
than did those residing in other regions. Furthermore, our 
sample mirrored smaller cohorts in which men, blacks, and 
relatively younger adults reported less frequent F&V intake 
than did women and other races.4–7

and certain segments in particular, fail to achieve guideline-
directed F&V consumption, has been recognized for more than

3 decades.21 Although food consumption decisions are multi-
factorial (as supported by the modest value of our regression 
model to predict daily F&V consumption), 2 recognized hur-
dles to increased consumption are availability and cost. Indeed, 
in our geographically diverse sample, we found both greater 
income, as well as frequent intake of other costly foods such 
as fish and red meat, to be strongly predictive of daily F&V 
consumption.

 Heffron et al  Fruit, Vegetables, and PAD Prevalence  1237
Public marketing campaigns such as “5 A Day for Better 
Health” and the current “Fruits and Veggies—More Matters” 
have met with limited success in increasing consumption of 
F&V by American adults.22 A large gap remains between 
goal and actual F&V consumption, leading experts to advo-
cate for multimodality approaches to attain recommended 
consumption levels across the population.23 Our observation 
of the levels of F&V intake in this large community-based 
sample highlights this divide. The limited sensitivity and 
specificity of our regression model demonstrates that this is 
certainly a complex endeavor. However, our analyses pro-
vide evidence of the need to focus on the, particularly, low 
F&V intake in certain groups, including non-whites, men, 
those living in Southern states, those with low incomes, and 
smokers.
In addition to confirming the overall low frequency 
of recommended levels of F&V intake among American 
adults, we further observed an association of greater con-
sumption with lower odds of prevalent PAD defined by 
ABI ≤0.9. Our adjusted analyses demonstrated a stepwise 
reduction in odds for PAD with increasing consumption of 
F&V—associations which were stronger with more abnor-
mal ABI measures.
Although several studies have found inverse associations 
of nutrients present in F&V with prevalent PAD24–26 and 
incident claudication,27 to our knowledge, this is only the 
second assessment of an association specifically between 
F&V consumption and PAD. The first was a report at year 
12 of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.28 In that 
cohort, 295 cases of incident, symptomatic PAD had been 
confirmed in the ≈44 000 men without diabetes mellitus or 
vascular disease at enrollment. In age-adjusted analyses, 
the investigators also found a step-wise reduction in risk 
of incident PAD by quintile of F&V intake. However, when 
smoking and exercise were included in the models, this 
association was attenuated and no longer statistically signif-
icant in this sample with a low incidence of PAD (0.7%). In 
our large sample with PAD (both symptomatic and asymp-
tomatic defined by ABI ≤0.9) prevalence >6%, we detected 
a stepwise inverse association of F&V consumption with 
prevalent PAD that persisted with correction for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, smoking, physical activity, income, and mul-
tiple other CVD risk factors, and was of greater magnitude 
with lower ABI.
When we stratified our sample by smoking status, we 
found that the inverse association of F&V intake with PAD 
was limited to subjects who formerly or currently used 
tobacco (Table 3). This observation has precedence. In the 
above-mentioned Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, 
the observed trend toward a reduced incidence of PAD with 
F&V intake was present in active smokers, but not in a com-
bined group of never and former smokers.28 Likewise, intake

of nutrients prevalent in F&V—β-carotene, vitamin C, and 
lycopene—have been associated with reduced risk for devel-
oping claudication in male smokers,27 and an association of 
vitamin C consumption with ABI in the Edinburgh Artery 
Study was seen only in individuals who had smoked, not in 
those who had never smoked.29 An interaction of smoking 
with vitamin C intake and the risk of stroke has also been 
reported.30 Hypothesized mechanisms underlying reduced 
atherosclerosis with F&V consumption generally involve 
action of micronutrients contained in the foods. Indeed, 
the prevailing explanation for the isolated associations in 
smokers is that antioxidant nutrients supplied via F&V only 
manifest detectable disease-preventing effects in the setting 
of significant oxidative stress, which occurs with smoking. 
Within the pathophysiology of PAD, oxidative stress is felt 
to be important in both the initiation and the progression of 
the disease,31 and increased antioxidant capacity may inhibit 
this process.
Several other mechanisms are also hypothesized to explain 
any protection from cardiovascular disease acquired with fre-
quent F&V consumption. One is through salicylic acid present 
in these foods.32 A reduction in blood pressure, demonstrated in 
several randomized, controlled trials is another.33,34 Although 
improved serum lipid profiles associated with the substitution 
of F&V for foods containing more fat or less fiber are also 
hypothesized to mediate inverse associations with atheroscle-
rosis, high-quality experimental support for this is lacking.35 
The evidence for greater F&V consumption to afford reduced 
weight similarly lacks a strong evidentiary foundation36,37 and 
seems contingent on the substitution of F&V for more calori-
cally dense and low-fiber foods.38
Limitations of our analysis include its cross-sectional 
nature that does not allow for the assessment of longitu-
dinal dietary consumption that is likely important in the 
development and progression of this chronic disease. Our 
survey instrument was not validated and left the defini-
tion of a “serving” to the determination of the participant. 
Furthermore, the presence of a single question about F&V 
consumption also does not allow for individual assessment 
of separate fruit or vegetable consumption with PAD preva-
lence, nor does it allow us to assess overall servings of F&V 
consumed by a participant. This introduces the potential for 
“miscategorization” of participants with infrequent con-
sumption of many servings of F&V and those with frequent 
consumption of slightly fewer than 3 servings of the foods. 
However, any miscategorization would serve to bias our 
observations toward the null—suggesting that our observed 
effect potentially underestimates the size of the actual effect 
of F&V intake on PAD. In addition, despite this limitation, 
our survey instrument likely provides ranking validity, and 
the 5 categories of consumption represent strata of overall 
F&V intake. Furthermore, there is some evidence that sug-
gests that for the purposes of categorizing total consumption 
of foods, that the frequency of intake is more important the 
number of servings.39
Despite our correction for over a dozen established risk 
factors for atherosclerotic disease and other variables, there 
are likely confounders which were not measured in our 
limited survey. Specifically, our data do not allow for the 
estimation of whole grain, alcohol, or total energy intake in 
our sample. Our survey also did not query the use of vita-
min supplements. Given the previously reported associations 
and mechanistic plausibility of greater fiber or antioxidant 
vitamin intake with PAD prevention, whole grain consump-
tion and the use of vitamin supplements are potentially 
unmeasured confounders of our findings. The absence of 
total energy intake could also confound associations given 
that greater total energy intake correlates with greater con-
sumption of multiple food groups. This potential associa-
tion is borne out in the propensity for those subjects who 
reported consuming F&V more frequently to also report 
more frequently consuming nuts and fish, but also red meat 
(Table 1). However, when analyses were restricted to those 
participants who reported eating nuts, fish, and red meat at 
least 4× weekly (as a surrogate for high energy intake), the 
inverse association of F&V with PAD was unchanged (data 
not shown).
Finally, although one strength of our study is our objec-
tive outcome of PAD defined by an abnormal value (≤0.9) 
on directly measured ABI (rather than symptomatic PAD, 
which may occur in the minority of patients with abnor-
mal ABI40), ABI is not as sensitive or specific as angiog-
raphy for the diagnosis of PAD.41 One reason for impaired 
sensitivity in ABI is the predilection for elderly, diabetics, 
and patients with end-stage renal disease to have elevated, 
rather than reduced ABI. However, the persistence of our 
findings when restricted to severely reduced ABIs, as 
well as with the exclusion of diabetics (data not shown), 
strengthens the confidence that can be assigned to our 
conclusions.
Nonetheless, the major strengths of our study are its 
inclusion of nearly 3.7 million subjects, and its demon-
stration of a clear inverse association of prevalent PAD, as 
defined by a directly measured abnormal ABI, with F&V 
intake, even with correction for multiple established PAD 
risk factors. These findings are restricted to subjects who 
have a history of tobacco use, in accordance with previ-
ous studies of antioxidant micronutrients and PAD, and 
thus are suggestive of a possible mechanism underlying the 
association.
Our study adds to the burgeoning literature about 
dietary consumption and PAD, emphasizing the necessity 
of further studies into diet and PAD specifically, so that 
dietary recommendations and interventions for reducing 
the burden of this disease can be established. This study 
also provides further evidence that F&V consumption var-
ies markedly by sex, race, and region of the United States, 
but is universally poor. This observation supports the con-
tinued need for programs to improve the dietary patterns of 
all Americans.

Highlights
• There is a stepwise inverse association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and prevalence of PAD.
• The inverse association of F&V intake with PAD is stronger with increasing severity of disease and restricted to current and former smokers.
• F&V intake at recommended levels is universally poor.
• F&V intake varies by demographics and geography.
