Abstract (250 words) 
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic cryotherapy can eradicate neoplastic Barrett’s 
esophagus (BE). A new contact cryoballoon focal ablation system (CbFAS)) freezes esophageal 
mucosa with nitrous oxide.  We studied the safety and efficacy of CbFAS for complete 
eradication of neoplastic Barrett's esophagus.  
METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial, consecutive BE patients with confirmed neoplasia (low-
grade dysplasia LGD, high-grade dysplasia HGD, and/or intramucosal adenocarcinoma ImCA), at 
least 1 cm of BE, with or without prior ablation, were treated with a dose 10 seconds of spray 
per site. EMR was performed for nodular lesions. Treatments were repeated every 10 to 12 
weeks until complete eradication, with a maximum of 5. Primary outcomes were complete 
eradication of all dysplasia (CE-D) and intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) at 1 year (intention-to-treat 
analysis).  
RESULTS: Forty-one evaluable patients (22 treatment-naïve, 19 previously ablated) with LGD 
(n=13), HGD (n=23) or ImCA (n=5) were treated. The median procedure time was 30 minutes. 
The median number of ablation procedures for CE-IM was 3 (IQ range 2-4).  Overall 1-year CE-D

and CE-IM rates were 95% and 88%, respectively.  CE-D rate was significantly lower (67%) in 
those with ultra-long BE compared with those with <8 cm (100%, p=0.02).  Median pain scores 
were zero at day 1. Four patients (9.7%) developed mild dysphagia from stenoses requiring 
dilation. One patient on aspirin developed upper GI bleeding, not requiring therapy.  
CONCLUSION: Multifocal nitrous oxide cryotherapy using CbFAS is a promising, highly effective, 
and safe endoscopic treatment for primary or rescue therapy of BE-associated neoplasia and 
intestinal metaplasia. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02534233)

BACKGROUND 
Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma.  
Endoscopic techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA) are proven safe and effective therapies for treatment of BE-associated high-
grade dysplasia (HGD)1, 2 and low-grade dysplasia (LGD).3  RFA is currently the ablative 
treatment of choice with complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D) and complete eradication of 
intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) in 91% and 78%, respectively.2   
Endoscopic cryotherapy involves the application of extreme cold to tissue, resulting in 
rapid intracellular and extracellular freezing, and eventually cell necrosis. 4 5, 6  Spray 
cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide cryotherapy have been used to eradicate 
BE,7-10 but the data are limited to case series and registry studies.

A new portable battery-powered contact cryotherapy system (cryoballoon focal ablation 
system, CbFAS, C2 Therapeutics, Inc, Redwood City, Calif USA) has been developed for 
esophageal mucosal ablation.11  The CbFAS consists of a small hand-held device containing 
liquid nitrous oxide in a capsule (Figure 1D), which converts to gas within a single use low 
pressure compliant balloon11(Figure 1A,1C).  The cryogen makes contract with the balloon and 
freezes targeted mucosa to -85 degrees Centigrade11.  Rotation of the diffuser within the 
balloon, which is actuated by tilting the handle of the device, enables targeting of specific areas 
of BE (video).  
 
The initial application of CbFAS for focal ablation of BE was a multicenter international 
dose-finding trial, which showed full squamous regeneration in all 10-second treated areas.12  A 
recent prospective clinical trial (n=30) confirmed complete eradication of flat dysplastic BE 
islands.13   
 
We performed a clinical trial to assess the feasibility of cryoballoon ablation using the 
CbFAS for complete eradication of all dysplasia and IM in neoplastic BE. We hypothesized that 
the multifocal application of cryotherapy with a focal device is safe and effective in both 
treatment-naïve and previously-ablated patients with dysplasia.

           This single-arm prospective clinical trial was performed at The Johns Hopkins Hospital 
(Baltimore, Maryland). Patients were enrolled and treated at the Baltimore campus and an 
affiliated hospital in Columbia, Maryland (Howard County General Hospital) from June 1, 2015 
to August 16, 2016. Local IRB approval was obtained on April 7, 2015 for the study protocol.  
Informed consent was obtained from each patient.  Registration on the clinicaltrials.gov 
website for this study was completed on August 27, 2015 (NCT02534233).  
Selection Criteria 
 
Adult patients were included in this study if there was >1 cm BE with low-grade 
dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (ImCA), in 
biopsies within 6 months of study entry.  Those with ImCA or nodular dysplastic BE were eligible 
after EMR performed at least 8 weeks before treatment with at least 1 cm of residual BE.  
Patients with LGD were included if they had at least 2 endoscopies with a diagnosis of LGD, or 
LGD in 1 endoscopy confirmed by 2 separate pathology readings, with at least 1 from an expert 
GI pathologist (EM). 
 
Prior RFA, cryotherapy, argon plasma coagulation (APC), or photodynamic therapy (PDT) 
was allowed.  Previously ablated patients were included if they (1) had 2 or more prior ablation 
procedures for BE neoplasia with persistent esophageal intestinal metaplasia, or (2) had at least 
1 ablation treatment with subsequent progression of neoplasia grade, or a symptomatic 
stricture requiring dilation. Patients with an esophageal mass, advanced or metastatic cancer, 
prior esophageal resection, active Grade B esophagitis or greater, symptomatic untreated 
esophageal stricture or luminal stenosis not allowing passage of a therapeutic endoscope, 
esophageal varices, eosinophilic esophagitis, and uncontrolled coagulopathy were excluded.

Endoscopic Procedures 
All patients underwent baseline outpatient sedated upper endoscopy using intravenous 
propofol.  A high-resolution video upper endoscope (Olympus GIF 1TH190, GIF 2TH180, GIF HQ-
190) was used with white light and narrow-band imaging (NBI) examination of the esophageal 
mucosa. The esophageal landmarks were recorded (proximal squamocolumnar junction, 
gastroesophageal junction).  The extent of BE was documented with the Prague C&M criteria14.  
EMR was performed for all visible lesions and 4-quadrant biopsy specimens obtained every 1 to 
2 cm throughout the segment length of the BE. 
 
Endoscopic cryoballoon ablation was performed at a separate visit using the focal CbFAS 
with cryogen dose of 10 seconds based upon the results of a human dose escalation trial, which 
demonstrated that 10 seconds of ice led the highest ablation response without significant 
adverse effects12.  Prior animal dosing experiments using squamous-lined porcine esophagus 
showed varying degrees of submucosal edema and inflammation and patchy edema, 
inflammation, and injury but not necrosis in the muscularis propria with a 10-second 
cryoablation11. The 3.7 mm focal cryoballoon catheter was passed through a standard or high 
definition therapeutic channel videoendoscope, or placed through an accessory “side car” 
(Figure 1B) attached a standard high-definition endoscope. The esophageal mucosa was 
visualized by looking through the transparent balloon (Figure 1E, video).  To treat all visible BE, 
multiple targeted focal ablations were delivered under endoscopic guidance from the distal to 
the proximal BE, beginning at the gastric cardia/GE junction where circumferential cryoablation 
was performed (video).  After all visible BE was treated, the cryoablation red color change

(Figure 1E, blue arrow) was assessed after a few minutes after complete melting of ice patches. 
Any skip areas < 5 mm (Figure 1E, yellow arrow) were treated with 5 additional seconds of ice. 
To minimize overlap of treatment areas, cryoablations were delivered in a systematic fashion 
while assessing the borders of the ice patch or resulting mucosal red color change that 
delineates an ablated area.  Treatments were repeated every 10 to 12 weeks until eradication 
of IM (Figure 1F-H, Figure 2). The maximum number of ablations allowed by study protocol in 
any given treatment session was 24. 
 
After baseline treatment, a liquid diet was prescribed for 24 hours, soft diet 
afterwards, advancing as tolerated. Patients took twice-a-day proton pump inhibitors 
(equivalent of omeprazole 40 mg BID), histamine receptor antagonist (such as famotidine 40 
mg) at bedtime, and sucralfate (1 gram 3 times a day) for the duration of their treatment.3     
 
 
Follow-Up and Pathology 
 
Postprocedure adverse events were noted by telephone call by a study team member 
at day 1, day 7, and day 30 after each treatment, and at the next scheduled follow-up upper 
endoscopy visit.  Dysphagia was graded on a 5-point scale (0=no dysphagia, 1= moderate 
passage, able to eat some solid foods, 2=able to eat semi-solid foods, 3=able to swallow liquids 
only, and 4=inability to swallow anything). 
 
Repeat high-resolution white light and NBI endoscopy was performed, and any 
remaining BE was treated with cryoablation in a similar fashion.  The circumference of the GEJ 
was not again ablated unless there was endoscopic evidence of intestinal metaplasia.  A 
maximum of 5 sessions of endoscopic ablative therapy was allowed.  Interval EMR was

performed for any new nodules or neoplastic-type lesions.  Follow-up EGD was performed 
every 3 months for 1 year after baseline with 4 quadrant large capacity forceps biopsy 
specimens obtained at the neo-Z line, from the GEJ,  the gastric cardia, and every 2 cm proximal 
to the GEJ through the original extent of the BE.   
 
Serious adverse events, post-ablation pain grade (using a Likert scale from 0 to 10), 
and need for narcotic analgesics, GI bleeding, and dysphagia from esophageal strictures 
requiring dilation were recorded.   
 
All biopsy specimens were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin.  Pathological review and grading of the BE in baseline and follow-up 
biopsy samples was performed by 2 experienced academic gastrointestinal pathologists (L.V., 
E.M.). 
 
Statistical Analysis and Outcome Parameters 
 
A sample size of 40 was selected to produce a 2-sided 95% confidence interval with a 
width of 0.20 (upper limit 88.5%, lower limit 68.7%) when the estimated dichotomous 
proportion of CE-IM was 80%. The latter CE-IM rate was based upon the meta-analysis of RFA 
studies (CE-IM, 78%;  95% confidence interval, 70%-86%)2  (PASS, NCSS Statistical Software, 
Kaysville, Utah).  
 
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE 14.0, StataCorp, College Station, 
Tex).  Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact test. 
Numerical variables were calculated using mean or median, and differences between groups

were analyzed with the Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, where appropriate.  A two-
tailed p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. 
 
The primary endpoint of this study were the percentage of patients with complete 
endoscopic and pathological eradication of all intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM). The secondary 
endpoints were the percentage of patients with complete eradication of dysplasia within BE 
(CE-D), proportion of patients who progressed from lower grades of dysplasia to cancer, 
adverse event rates, post ablation pain, number of cryoablation procedures, and, technical 
success. 
 
Any patient who required intervening alternative ablative (RFA, APC) or surgical 
treatment for residual BE neoplasia were considered cryoablation treatment failures. EMR for 
lesions developing before the 1-year outcome assessment was allowed per protocol.  One 
session of limited argon plasma coagulation (APC) was allowed under protocol to treat <4 
residual non-dysplastic columnar islands <5 mm in size after cryoablation, similar to the 
Surveillance versus radiofrequency ablation (SURF) trial3.   
RESULTS 
 
From January 2015 to August 2016, 91 patients presenting consecutively to one 
gastroenterologist’s referral practice (MC) for BE surveillance or endoscopic therapy of BE 
neoplasia were screened (Supplementary Figure 1 CONSORT flow diagram).  Forty-one patients 
were evaluable and comprised the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort. The patient data are 
summarized in Table 1. Overall, 90% of patients had dysplastic BE (32% LGD, 56% HGD), and 
12% had ImCA at study entry. Eighty-five percent had BE <8 cm; 15% had ultra-long BE ≥8 cm.

Fourteen patients (34%) had prior EMR. Nine patients (22%) had a pre-existing asymptomatic 
esophageal stricture due to prior ablation, EMR, and/or GERD.  
 
Technical Success, Number of Ablations, and Ablation Time 
 
Single 10-second ablations performed with the focal cryoablation system were typically 
round or oval shaped ice patches, approximately 2 to 3 cm in maximum diameter (Figure 1E, 
1G). All patients underwent at least one cryoablation procedure (range 1-14).  The total number 
of cryoablation procedures for the ITT cohort was 117, with a technical success rate of 115 of 
117 (98%) due to 2 incomplete cryoablation treatments (2 patients) related to balloon 
migration from a pre-existing stricture.   
 
The median number of ablation procedures in all patients was 3 (IQR 2-4), with 
significantly more procedures in BE > 8 cm (median 4), compared to those with shorter lengths 
of BE (Table 2). The median total ablation time was 17 minutes (IQR 13-23) and median total 
procedure time was 30 minutes (IQR 24-35) (Table 2). 
 
Treatment of BE mucosa within pre-existing strictures in all 9 patients (Table 1, Figure 
1F, 1G) was successful without associated disruption of mucosa within the stricture during 
cryoballoon ablation.  There was also no worsening of the pre-existing stricture after 
cryoablation (Figure 1H) and complete pathologic elimination of BE and neoplasia was achieved 
in 7 of the 9 patients. 
 
Intervening EMR was performed in 3 patients (7.3%). Pathology of the EMR lesions 
showed LGD (n=2) and HGD (n=1), comparable to the baseline dysplasia grade before 
cryoballoon ablation.

Efficacy 
 
Median follow-up time was 20.9 months (IQR 17.5-24.6) for all patients. The treatment 
outcomes are summarized in Figure 3.  In this ITT-cohort, the overall CE-dysplasia rate was 95% 
(39/41), with no difference in treatment-naïve and previously ablated patients (Supplementary 
Figure 2). However, the CE-D rate was lower in patients with ultra-long BE >= 8 cm, compared 
with those with shorter lengths (67% versus 100%, respectively, p=0.02).  CE-dysplasia was not 
significantly different in patients with (n=14) or without (n=27) prior EMR (85.7% vs 100%, 
p=0.11). 
 
There were 2 treatment failures in patients with ultra-long BE who had persistent 
neoplasia. One was a treatment-naïve patient with extensive multifocal nodular intramucosal 
cancer and HGD in a BE segment measuring C9M9 who had multiple EMRs (total 50% 
circumferential) and developed a high-grade stricture requiring 2 interval dilations and rescue 
APC. The patient opted to have surgery for a biopsy-diagnosed ImCA, instead of continued 
endoscopic therapy. The final pathology in the esophagectomy specimen was a 3-mm ImCA. 
The second treatment failure was a previously ablated patient who had persistent HGD despite 
EMR, RFA, and spray cryotherapy.  There was residual minute HGD in a pre-existing stricture 
after 1 cryoablation. This was successfully treated with rescue argon plasma coagulation after 
submucosal injection of saline solution. 
 
Overall, the CE-IM rate was 88% (35/41), with no difference in patients with or without 
prior endoscopic ablation (86 vs. 89%, p=1.0) (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, there was no 
difference in the CE-IM rate in patients with BE <8 cm, or ≥8 cm (88% vs 83%, respectively,

p=0.57) (Figure 3).  In addition to the 2 treatment failures with persistent neoplasia, there were 
3 other patients who had persistent esophageal intestinal metaplasia. One treatment-naïve 
patient with multiple EMR for nodular HGD and ImCA (baseline C4M7) had residual non-
dysplastic BE in the distal esophagus. Positioning of the cryoballoon in the distal esophagus at 
cryoablation visit 3 was not successful due to migration across an asymptomatic stenosis.  This 
patient was subsequently treated successfully with RFA and APC.  Another patient who failed to 
reach CE-IM (baseline C8M9) had had multiple prior RFA sessions and spray cryotherapy 
treatments but persistent HGD. The dysplasia was eradicated by cryoablation but the residual 
esophageal IM was not ablated with 5 treatments. The last patient with refractory BE entered 
the trial with residual HGD C4M5 despite 4 prior RFA and 1 EMR session.  Cryoablation 
successfully eradicated all dysplasia and IM, but esophageal IM recurred within 1 year from 
treatment initiation after 5 treatment sessions. 
 
Adverse Events 
 
There were no esophageal perforations. There was no progression to esophageal cancer 
in any treated patient.  The overall treatment-related adverse event rate was 10 of 41(24%): 
bleeding n=1, pain requiring a narcotic analgesic after discharge n=2, stricture n=4, Candida 
esophagitis post stricture dilation and steroid injection n=2, and balloon tip mucosal trauma not 
requiring treatment n=1.  The treatment-related serious adverse event rate was 2.4% (1/41 
patients), or 0.9% (1/117 procedures). One patient developed upper GI bleeding at day 7 from a 
post-ablation GE junction ulcer associated with aspirin use, not requiring therapy.

Figure 4 illustrates the incidence and time course of median post-cryoablation pain 
scores for all patients and stratified by length of BE.  Post cryoablation pain was mild and 
resolved quickly (Figure 4A).  The median overall immediate post-ablation pain score was 1 
(interquartile or IQR 0-3) and decreased to 0 on day 1 and day 7(Supplementary Table 1).  All 
pain scores were 0 at day 30.  The median immediate post-ablation pain scores were 
significantly higher in patients with ultra-long BE >8 cm (3.5, IQR 2-8) versus BE <8 cm (0, IQR 0-
2), p=0.04 (Figure 4B, Supplementary Table 1).  The overall incidence of post-ablation pain 
requiring analgesic treatment immediately after the procedure was 11 of 41 (27%) but only 2 
patients (4.9%) required a dose of a narcotic analgesic (acetominophen + codeine) on day 1, 
none thereafter.  Patients with ultralong BE >8 cm were more likely to need a narcotic analgesic 
immediately after ablation (4/6 or 67%) compared with those with shorter lengths (7/35 or 
20%) (p=0.035). 
 
The overall post cryoablation stricture rate was 9.8% (4/41). These were successfully 
treated with a median of 1 (range 1-3) balloon dilations. Two of the 4 patients with strictures 
were treatment-naïve patients who developed mild dysphagia 5 and 10 weeks after the initial 
ablation.  They reported continued mild dysphagia for solids at the scheduled 3-month EGD and 
were dilated.  Both had traversable stenoses located in the distal esophagus/GE junction. In 
contrast, the other stricture patients presented acutely at 2 and 4 days after ablation. Both 
patients had long BE with prior EMR and an asymptomatic stricture before initiating 
cryoablation treatment. Both strictures within the ablated area were successfully treated with 
balloon dilation.  One of these patients (patient with persistent ImCA described above) 
developed an 8 mm non-traversable stricture located 4 cm proximal to the post EMR stricture

site after 1 cryoablation. The other patient with resistant BE had a symptomatic traversable 
stricture located 4 cm distal to the pre-existing stricture, which developed only after her fifth 
ablation.  The presence of pain at day 7 was significantly associated with the development of a 
post-cryoablation stricture (3/4, p<0.0001). 
DISCUSSION 
 
We report the first clinical application of a contact focal cryoballoon ablation system 
using nitrous oxide applied in a multifocal technique to treat the entire length of BE for 
complete endoscopic eradication of neoplasia and IM.  This clinical trial reports high efficacy 
with overall CE-D and CE-IM rates of 95% and 88%, including patients with ultra-long BE and 
prior unsuccessful ablation therapy.  The safety profile was also acceptable, with an overall 
treatment-related adverse event rate of 24%, comparable to that reported by studies involving 
EMR + RFA (18%-22.2%3, 15). The serious adverse event rate was low (2.4%), lower than that 
reported for RFA (3.4%-4.4%3, 16, 17). 
How does contact cryoballoon ablation compare with spray cryotherapy?  Endoscopic 
cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen (Cryospray Ablation System, CSA Medical, Baltimore, Md, 
USA) has been used to successfully eradicate neoplastic BE,9, 18 including those that failed other 
treatments.18, 19  Our study results suggest cryoablation may have a higher CE-D rate and CE-IM 
rate than liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy (CE-HGD 81%, CE-LGD 91%, CE-IM 77%-88%).8, 10  
Similarly, the cryoablation CE-IM rate in this study is higher to CO2 cryotherapy (CE-D 89%, CE-
IM 55%).7   The number of cryoballoon ablation procedures (median=3) was lower compared 
with that for CO2 spray cryotherapy (median=4, IQR 2-6)7 and comparable with liquid nitrogen

cryotherapy (median=3.3)8.   Post-cryoablation pain requiring narcotics (4.9%) was less than 
that for post-spray cryotherapy (14%)8 
RFA has been the most studied ablative therapy for treatment of neoplastic BE.  The 
randomized controlled trial by Shaheen et al in 2009,17 other well designed clinical trials,3 20, 
large community-based RFA Registry studies,15, 21, 22 and meta-analyses reporting efficacy 
outcomes of 3,802 patients2 have established RFA as a safe and highly effective endoscopic 
ablation for BE, to which other ablative therapies must be compared. CE-D rates are high, with 
a pooled rate of 91% (95% CI, 87%-95%).2  However, RFA is by no means a perfect treatment. 
CE-IM rates are variable, with a pooled rate of 78% (95% CI, 70%-86%)2.  The cryoablation CE-D 
(95%) and CE-IM (88%) rates in this trial appear to be within the range of RFA efficacy rates, 
suggesting a potential for CbFAS to be comparably effective for neoplasia eradication, with 
similar number of ablation procedures per patient as RFA (3.03, 3.42, 3.517).  Furthermore, the 
post cryoablation pain in this study was notably mild and short-lived, with minimal narcotic 
analgesic use.  The median pain score 1 day post-cryoablation (0 on a scale of 10) compares 
favorably with post-RFA 1 day pain score (23 on a 100-point visual analog scale)17.  No patient 
required hospitalization for pain post-cryoablation; 1.5%-3% of post-RFA patients were 
admitted for pain3, 17. 
The RFA pooled stricture incidence rate is 5.6% (95% CI, 4.2%-7.4%).2   Prior EMR may lead to a 
higher chance of a stricture after RFA (12% versus 5%).15  Our study had a pre-ablation EMR rate of 34%; 
the stricture rate of 9.8% is comparable to that reported by other studies treating BE neoplasia involving 
EMR + RFA (9%15, 12.5%23, and 14%24) and slightly higher than that compared with RFA studies that 
involved limited EMR (AIM Dysplasia 2 trial=6%17) or no EMR (11.8%)3.  Furthermore, when compared

to liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy, the stricture rate in our cohort seems relatively higher 
than that reported by a retrospective study by Shaheen et al10 (3% stricture rate 22% EMR 
rate10) and a prospective registry study by Ghorbani et al25 (1% stricture, 20% EMR rate25). 
However, both these studies involved only dysplastic BE patients with lower rates of EMR 
compared to our study cohort.  In contrast, other studies involving liquid nitrogen spray 
cryotherapy reported comparable or higher rates of stricturing (9%-13% 9, 26, 27).  Cryotherapy, 
in general, has a theoretical advantage of destroying the superficial epithelium while sparing 
the subepithelial structures.  However, the effects are dose-dependent or related to the 
amount (time) of cryogen applied.  With contact cryoballoon cryotherapy, the cold energy is 
focused in one area, about 2 to 3 cm in size.  One possible reason for stricture development is 
overlap of ice patches resulting in greater application of cryogen and deeper injury. 
What are the potential advantages of cryoballoon ablation over other endoscopic 
eradication techniques? Cryoballoon ablation might lead to more consistent and effective 
application of cryogen because the cryogen is contained in the balloon and the cryogen dose is 
completely delivered to a target site, with no need for freeze-thaw cycling.  A prior human 
dosing trial demonstrated 100% ablation of IM in a focal area treated with 10 seconds of 
cryogen12.  Similarly, a recent 30 patient clinical trial showed that 10 seconds of ice applied with 
the focal cryoballoon device was successful in targeting dysplastic BE islands in 94% and 
associated with 100% CE of BE treated13.  Procedure times for cryoballoon ablation are short, 
averaging 30 minutes.  The portability and ease of use of the CbFAS are also appealing; the 
small nitrogen capsules replace the heavy tanks that need refilling and replacement.  Cryogen 
dosing can also be increased to treat deeper than 1 mm of epithelium.  The cryoballoon

ablation system can also be used to treat BE within strictures (Figure 1F), which may be 
challenging with other eradication therapies.  The compliant balloon remains stable within the 
stricture while distending the lumen to enable visualization of the mucosa (Figure 1G).  The 
cryoballoon pressure is regulated by the controller to a maximum of 3.5 psi, which is very low 
compared with standard dilating balloons that exert pressures of 44 to 147 psi28.  Furthermore, 
the balloon automatically deflates if the pressure exceeds 4.5 psi28.  Finally, the CbFAS may also 
have an economical advantage compared to existing ablation systems.  There is no capital 
expense for a generator or console, just the cost of disposable one-size cryoballoon catheter 
and nitrogen capsules.  Finally, the focal cryoballoon device has an appealing versatility in 
delivering focal targeted ablation that spare normal mucosa, or multifocal treatments that 
mimic circumferential contact balloon energy application.  Other cryoablation balloon devices 
undergoing study will feature expanded treatment areas. 
The strengths of this study include the first prospective clinical trial assessment of 
nitrous oxide cryoablation for complete eradication of neoplastic BE. Second, we consecutively 
enrolled neoplastic BE patients without exclusion of those with pre-existing strictures, ultra-
long BE length, and prior failed treatments, which are populations excluded in other ablation 
trials.  Our study population included 2 types of BE patients resulting in heterogeneity and 
relatively small the study subgroups. However, our results demonstrate no significant 
difference in the efficacy parameters between treatment-naïve and previously ablated patients.  
The current study provides data that useful for planning larger, more definitive clinical trials. 
Third, a single endoscopist at one site performed all treatment procedures, potentially

minimizing the variability in treatment applications.  Finally, expert pathologists confirmed all 
baseline and final pathologic diagnoses.    
The limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size, the nonrandomized 
study design and lack of a control arm, and the limited generalizability from single-center 
treatment and tertiary referral academic patient population.  Finally, we did not formally assess 
other relevant outcomes of interest, such as the incidence of buried BE, or changes associated 
in quality of life.  
In summary, this study suggests that a new type of nitrous oxide cryotherapy using a 
portable CbFAS applied in a multifocal fashion, with or without prior EMR, is a safe, effective, 
and well-tolerated modality for the endoscopic treatment of neoplastic BE.  More research is 
needed.  Carefully selected patients should be treated within clinical trials using standardized 
protocols.  An open-label, multicenter clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of CbFAS for 
neoplastic BE is underway in the United States (clincaltrials.gov, NCT02249975).

area of mucosa with immediate cryoablation red color change noted a few minutes after the ice 
melts (blue arrow).  This facilitates targeting and complete ablation of focal or extensive 
Barrett’s mucosa.  F, Endoscopic image of residual dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus proximal to

controller to a maximum of 3.5 psi. As a safety feature, the balloon automatically deflates if the 
pressure exceeds 4.5 psi (well below the pressures exerted by through-the-scope endoscopic 
balloon dilation systems, which are at least 10 times greater).

The cryoaballoon was passed into the stomach and then connected to a portable small battery-
powered controller handle, which electronically controls the diffuser and holds the single-use 
nitrous oxide-containing capsule.  The latter is heated in preparation for cryogen delivery. The 
cryoablation balloon was inflated with about 30 mL of air from a syringe or a 1-second release 
of liquid nitrous oxide (“pre-puff”) from the diffuser within the cryoballoon.  The cryoballoon 
catheter was pulled back to the tip of the endoscope to visualize the BE mucosa through the 
transparent balloon. The “pre-puff” also created a tiny ice patch to determine the axial and 
longitudinal location of the treatment.  The direction of the cryogen from the diffuser was 
controlled by tilting the handle right or left, which rotates the diffuser clockwise or counter-
clockwise. This directional control was performed under the direction of the endoscopist by the 
endoscopy assistant holding the controller.  The trigger of the handle was depressed and a pre-
set 10-second period of cryogen was delivered.
