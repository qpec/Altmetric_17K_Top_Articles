 Abstract 
Electrical stimulation of sensory nerves is a powerful tool for studying neural coding because it 
can activate neural populations in ways that natural stimulation cannot. Electrical stimulation of 
the nerve has also been used to restore sensation to patients who have suffered the loss of a limb. 
Here, we have used long-term implanted electrical interfaces to elucidate the neural basis of 
perceived intensity in the sense of touch. To this end, we assessed the sensory correlates of 
neural firing rate and neuronal population recruitment independently by varying two parameters 
of nerve stimulation: pulse frequency and pulse width. Specifically, two amputees, chronically 
implanted with peripheral nerve electrodes, performed each of three psychophysical tasks – 
intensity discrimination, magnitude scaling, and intensity matching – in response to electrical 
stimulation of their somatosensory nerves. We found that stimulation pulse width and pulse 
frequency had systematic, cooperative effects on perceived tactile intensity and that the artificial 
tactile sensations could be reliably matched to skin indentations on the intact limb. We identified 
a quantity we termed the activation charge rate (ACR), derived from stimulation parameters, that 
predicted the magnitude of artificial tactile percepts across all testing conditions. Based on 
principles of nerve fiber recruitment, the ACR represents the total population spike count in the 
activated neural population. Our findings support the hypothesis that population spike count 
drives the magnitude of tactile percepts and indicate that sensory magnitude can be manipulated 
systematically by varying a single stimulation quantity. 
 
Introduction 
Electrical stimulation of sensory nerves is a powerful tool to investigate neural coding at the 
sensory periphery and provides a means to restore sensation for patients who have lost it. In the 
sense of touch, early studies with intraneural microstimulation revealed that electrical stimulation 
of individual tactile afferent neurons produces sensations that vary predictably based on nerve 
fiber type (1–3), which constituted a major advance in our understanding of the neural basis of 
touch. In the field of neuroengineering, studies with human subjects provided evidence that 
electrically induced tactile and proprioceptive percepts improve the dexterous use of prosthetic 
 hands (4–9), can be stable over years (10), and foster embodiment of the prosthesis by the 
subjects (11).  
The magnitude of a tactile stimulus is one of its most basic sensory dimensions, one that can be 
resolved independently of its sensory quality. Tactile stimuli that vary widely in their other 
properties – spanning simple skin indentations, skin vibrations, and textures – can all be judged 
on a single intensive continuum (12–15). However, the neural determinants of tactile magnitude 
have not been conclusively elucidated. Increasing the intensity of a stimulus applied to the skin, 
such as the pressure exerted on the skin or the amplitude of a skin vibration, has two 
consequences on the evoked neuronal response: (1) an increase in the firing rate of nerve fibers 
whose receptive fields (RFs) lie at the locus of mechanical stimulation and (2) the recruitment 
(activation) of fibers with nearby RFs (12, 13, 16–18). The contributions of these two aspects of 
the neural response to perceived intensity cannot be disentangled using recordings of afferent 
responses to mechanical stimulation of the skin because they co-vary to a large extent (12). 
Electrical stimulation of the nerve allows us to assess the influence of each of these two aspects 
of the neural response in the determination of sensory magnitude, since firing rate and 
recruitment can be manipulated approximately independently by varying the stimulation pulse 
frequency and the charge per pulse, respectively. 
In the context of upper-limb neuroprostheses, manipulating sensory magnitude is an intuitive 
way to convey information about the pressure exerted on objects (4). Previous experiments with 
electrical stimulation of human nerves demonstrated that adjusting pulse frequency or 
manipulating pulse amplitude or pulse width to alter charge per pulse changes the perceived 
magnitude of the stimulus (5, 6, 19–23). However, these experiments did not provide a 
principled understanding of how stimulation parameters affect sensory magnitude, or how many 
discriminable levels of intensity could be provided through a peripheral nerve interface.  
In the present study, we used classical psychophysical methods to systematically probe the 
dependence of sensory magnitude on stimulation parameters in two amputees equipped with flat 
interface nerve electrodes (FINEs) or spiral cuffs implanted for more than two years on their 
median, ulnar, and radial nerves (Fig. 1) (5). We sought to (1) elucidate the neural basis of 
sensory magnitude and (2) leverage this newfound understanding to develop sensory encoding 
algorithms for use in sensorized neuroprostheses. To this end, we first used a two-alternative 
 forced choice paradigm to investigate the discriminability of sensory percepts evoked with 
different stimulation regimens. Second, we used free magnitude estimation to characterize how 
the sensory magnitude varies as stimulation parameters change. Third, we used an intensity 
matching paradigm to compare the perceived intensity of artificial and natural tactile percepts. In 
all experiments, we varied both the pulse frequency and the charge per pulse to assess the effects 
of each of these parameters on shaping the evoked percept. Frequency and charge per pulse have 
different effects on nerve activation, allowing the separation of the rate of activation from the 
number of fibers activated. We expected that the pattern of dependence of sensory magnitude on 
stimulation parameters would shed light on the neural basis of touch. We found that perceived 
intensity could be predicted based on a single stimulation parameter which combined the pulse 
frequency and charge per pulse. We then showed that this parameter, which we have called the 
activation charge rate (ACR), approximates the total spike rate evoked in the activated neuronal 
population.  
 
Results 
Subjects reliably discriminated small increments of stimulation pulse width or pulse frequency  
We can discern the level of pressure applied to our fingertips with high accuracy based on neural 
signals from the skin (24), which are critical to our ability to dexterously manipulate objects (25, 
26). For upper-limb neuroprostheses to be clinically viable it is not sufficient to acquire and 
interpret control signals to move the limb, for example from descending fibers in the nerve or 
from the activation of residual muscles; sensory information about the pressure exerted on 
objects must also be conveyed. Without these sensory signals, the ability to manipulate objects 
will be severely compromised. One approach to intuitively convey information about pressure is 
to modulate the intensity of the electrical stimulation according to the applied pressure, with 
greater pressure signaled by greater intensity (4–6). With this in mind, we first sought to 
establish how changes in stimulation intensity led to distinguishable percepts. We had subjects 
discriminate the perceived intensity of pairs of stimulation pulse trains that varied in pulse width 
(PW), pulse frequency (PF), or both. These experiments yielded psychometric functions relating 
discrimination performance to differences in stimulation intensity (PW, PF, or both). To the 
 extent that small increments in either parameter are discriminable, a large number of intensity 
levels can be signaled to the subject via the neural interface. 
Systematic changes in stimulation parameters yielded systematic changes in the perceived 
magnitude of the evoked percepts as evidenced by smooth psychometric functions, which are 
similar to those found in intact sensory systems (Fig. 2A). The just noticeable difference (JND) 
is defined as the change in a stimulation parameter that yields 75% correct discrimination. The 
JND for PF was 16.5 ± 1.6 Hz (mean ± sd) and 29.6 ± 4.6 Hz at 50 and 100 Hz references, 
respectively. To compare discriminability across stimulation conditions, we computed the Weber 
fraction, which is the JND divided by the reference. The Weber fractions obtained at the two 
reference frequencies were 0.33 and 0.30; these were statistically indistinguishable (unpaired t-
test, p=0.61, Fig. 2B inset).  The JND for PW was 6.7 ± 1.0 µs, yielding a Weber fraction of 
0.05, which was significantly lower than Weber fractions obtained with changes in PF (unpaired 
t-test, p<0.001 for both PF JNDs). We also found that discriminability was higher when both PF 
and PW increased or decreased together than when either changed in isolation or when they 
changed in opposite directions (Fig. 2C).  
Subjects perceived a wide range of intensity of artificially evoked sensation  
Discrimination performance does not provide information about the range of elicited sensations. 
Indeed, all pulse trains might have elicited percepts whose magnitude was only slightly different, 
but reliably so. To achieve natural somatosensory feedback would require that the artificial 
sensation perceptions span a wide range of sensory magnitudes that matches the range 
experienced in every day life through an intact limb. To test the breadth of evoked sensations, 
subjects were asked to provide judgments of perceived intensity across the range of safe and 
comfortable stimulation parameters in a free magnitude scaling paradigm (12, 16, 27). As 
expected, the perceived intensity increased as PW (Fig. 3A,C) and PF (Fig. 3B,D) increased over 
the range of values tested. Importantly, perceived magnitudes of artificial touch spanned a wide 
range, increasing approximately ten-fold from the lowest to the highest intensity tested. To 
compare across stimulation parameters, we examined the intensity as a function of the average 
stimulation current, which is defined as the total stimulation charge applied per second (in units 
of µA): 
   !!∀# ! ������ ! ������ ! ������  
 
 
 
 
 
(Eq. 1) 
The perceived magnitude as a function of average current was different depending on the mode 
of stimulation (t-test comparing regession slopes, all p<0.001, Fig. 3E): Slopes were steepest for 
PW, shallowest for PF, and intermediate for the combination of PF and PW. 
Subjects matched artificial tactile percepts to natural tactile stimuli  
Having established that varying pulse train parameters can elicit a large number of discriminable 
intensity percepts, and that these percepts span a wide range of intensities, we sought to directly 
compare the magnitude of electrically evoked sensations to that of mechanically evoked ones. To 
this end, subjects were instructed to match mechanical skin indentations on their intact hand to 
electrical stimulation such that the sensory magnitude of the former matched that of the latter. 
This process was repeated for electrical stimuli that spanned the range of perceptible and 
comfortable PWs and PFs. We found that PW and PF were approximately linear functions of 
indentation depth matched for perceived magnitude (Fig. 4A-D). The slope of the functions 
obtained by varying PF and PW were consistent for each electrode contact but varied across 
contacts. Electrode contacts that yielded a high slope for indentation depth vs. PF also yielded a 
high slope for indentation depth vs. PW (Fig. 4E, r=0.96). The slopes of the functions were 
likely affected by several factors including the mechanical sensitivity at the location of the 
indentation, which probably varied across skin locations, and the electrical sensitivity of the 
stimulated fascicle, which varied according to its geometry and distance from the stimulating 
electrode (see “Biophysical model of afferent recruitment” in supplementary materials). As was 
the case with the magnitude estimates, PW and PF had different effects on matched depths when 
stimulation was expressed in terms of the average stimulation current (!!∀#) (t-test comparing 
regession slopes, all p<0.001).  
Total neural population spike rate encodes perceived intensity  
Having established that changes in PF and PW have similar, but not equivalent, effects on 
sensation magnitude, we explored the implications of our findings on the underlying neural code. 
To this end, we applied stimulation recruitment principles to understand how these parameters 
might shape the neuronal response. Specifically, we examined how changes in PF and PW affect 
the activated neural population. Increasing the PF of stimulation results in an increase in the 
firing rate of activated neurons with miminal influence on the number of fibers activated, 
 whereas increasing PW results in recruitment of additional neurons while minimally affecting the 
firing rate of the activated fibers since each pulse is too short to evoke multiple spikes in a given 
fiber (28–30). Importantly, electrical stimulation allows us to vary population size (via PW) and 
population firing rate (via PF) independently, which is not possible with natural stimulation as 
these two factors generally co-vary with mechanical stimulation of the skin. 
Previous studies involving paired neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments yielded 
two theories of the neural basis of perceived intensity (12). According to the “hot zone” 
hypothesis, the perceived intensity is determined by the spike count across the population of 
afferent neurons whose receptive fields are directly under the stimulus, weighted by fiber type 
(12, 31). According to the “population” hypothesis, the perceived intensity is determined by the 
spike count across the entire population of afferent neurons that is activated by the stimulus, 
again weighted by fiber type. These two hypotheses could not be disambiguated based on 
neurophysiological responses from the nerve and psychophysical ratings of perceived magnitude, 
as measured in monkeys and humans, respectively. 
Results from the present study provide evidence against the hot zone model of perceived 
intensity. According to the hot zone model, increasing the PF of stimulation increases sensory 
magntude by increasing the firing of neurons while miminally recruiting additional neurons. In 
contrast, increasing the PW recruits additional  neurons while minimally affecting firing rate and 
has little impact on perceived intensity. On the other hand, the population model of perceived 
intensity predicts that increases in both stimulation parameters should affect perceived 
magnitude as they both modulate the total number of spikes elicited: one by increasing the spike 
rate of activated neurons, the other by recruiting more neurons. In other words, both temporal 
and spatial summation seem to play a role in shaping perceived intensity. 
Based on the hypothesis that the population model could quantitatively account for the 
behavioral results, we derived an expression to estimate how the population firing rate evoked by 
electrical stimulation varied as a function of PW and PF (for detailed derivation, see “Derivation 
of activation charge rate” in supplementary materials). This model was predicated upon three 
assumptions: single fascicle activation, monotonic fiber recruitment, and single action potential 
per stimulation pulse. First, we assumed that only one fascicle was activated by any given 
stimulus, an assumption that is supported by in vivo tests of FINEs in animals (32), and by the 
 observation that, in these experiments, the spatial extent of the projected field was stable across 
stimulation parameters (see Fig. S6). Second, the number of fibers that were activated within the 
fascicle was a smooth, monotonic function of PW. This assumption is supported by the 
observation that perceived magnitude increased smoothly with increases in PW across the range 
tested. Recruitment – the proportion of fibers in the fascicle that are activated by each pulse – 
can be described as a sigmoidal function of PW (Fig. 5A). While the threshold and slope are 
expected to vary across electrodes – depending on the distance between the electrode and the 
stimulated fascicle, the precise electrical properties of the interposed tissue, the layout of 
surrounding fascicles, and the cross-sectional area of the fascicle, among others - a sigmoid is a 
generic description of the recruitment function (33). We implemented a detailed biophysical 
model of the human median nerve and of the effects of electrical stimulation on recruitment, 
showing that simulated recruitment curves were well approximated by a sigmoid function (Fig. 
S7). When stimulation is above threshold and in the linear range of the sigmoid, the total number 
of fibers activated is well-approximated by a linear function of the total charge per pulse above 
threshold. Third, we assumed that each pulse produced a single action potential in each activated 
fiber, given the short PWs (all ≤ 255 µs) (28).  
To estimate the total population spike rate, the proportion of activated fibers was multiplied by 
the stimulus frequency to yield a quantity we dubbed activation charge rate (ACR): 
��������� ! ! ! !!!!∀#! ! ������!  
 
 
 
(Eq. 2) 
Since the stimulation pulses are square, the charge (Q) is the product of PA and PW and Qthreshold 
is the charge at perception threshold. According to this model the population firing rate is 
approximately linear with ACR (Fig. 5B).   
When the electrical stimuli were expressed in terms of ACR, and accounting for the effects of 
adaptation (see “Measuring and modeling threshold adaptation” in supplementary materials), the 
psychometric functions obtained in the discrimination experiment and resulting Weber fractions 
were consistent across the stimulation paradigms (Fig. !A, t-test for each pair, p=0.61, 0.25 and 
0.61, respectively). That is, the discriminability of two electrical stimuli could be predicted based 
on this metric regardless of which stimulation parameter was varied. Similarly, the magnitude 
scaling and indentation matching functions obtained when varying each of the two parameters 
 (PW or PF) overlapped almost completely when expressed in terms of ACR (Fig. !B-C), and the 
slopes were highly consistent across tested conditions (Fig. !D-E, all p>0.05, except Fig. !D 
leftmost panel p=0.0059). In other words, the perceived magnitude of any electrical stimulus 
could be predicted based on ACR regardless of the specific stimulation parameters. Given that 
ACR is a proxy for the evoked population firing rate, the present results are consistent with the 
hypothesis that the perceived magnitude of a tactile stimulus is determined by the total firing rate 
evoked in the population of mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the skin.   
Discussion 
A single code for perceived magnitude unifies natural and artificial touch 
The intensity of a tactile percept is independent of its quality: different sensations can be evoked 
by different natural stimuli – skin pressure or vibrations, e.g. – but their intensity can be rated 
along a single continuum (12, 13). Here, we showed that the same applies to artificial touch: the 
intensity of electrically-evoked percepts was determined by a single quantity, the ACR, even 
though the quality of the evoked percept might vary across electrodes and even across 
stimulation regimes through a given electrode.  
Increasing electrical input monotonically increases afferent activation 
We did not directly test how fiber count increases with pulse charge because we could not 
measure fiber recruitment in these subjects. However, recruitment of motor neurons has been 
found to increase monotonically with pulse charge (34–37) and our biophysical model, based on 
measurements of human fascicle geometry, yielded a sigmoidal recruitment function (Fig. S7). 
The stimulation paradigms tested here were likely operating in the approximately linear region 
between threshold and saturation of this recruitment function. In these experiments, the term 
“threshold” refers to a perceptual threshold, not a single fiber activation threshold. With 
stimulation through an extraneural cuff, our results showed that even for near threshold 
stimulation, the size of the projected field was larger than that of a single mechanoreceptive 
afferent (Fig. S6), which implies that more than one afferent was recruited. It is also unlikely we 
reached the saturation level, because subjective magnitude did not plateau. Thus, for the 
stimulation paradigms tested here, the biophysical models predicted approximately linear 
recruitment with increases in pulse charge.  
 Sensory adaptation changes stimulation threshold 
A ubiquitous phenomenon in sensory systems is that prolonged supra-threshold stimulation 
results in decreased sensitivity, as evidenced by increased detection thresholds and decreased 
sensory magnitudes. While adaptation has been extensively documented with natural stimulation 
of the skin (38–42), less is known about its extent and time course with artificial electrical 
stimulation of the nerve. Here, we observed robust adaptation that depended systematically on 
the regimen of stimulation: stronger stimulation resulted in stronger desensitization. To estimate 
ACR we therefore had to account for adaptation by adjusting the thresholds on a block by block 
basis according to the average stimulation strength of the previous block and the time between 
blocks. While a systematic analysis of adaptation falls outside the purview of the present study, 
its effects will need to be taken into consideration when designing sensory feedback algorithms.  
ACR simplifies the coding of intensity perception in neuroprostheses 
The ability to systematically manipulate the perceived magnitude of an artificial tactile percept 
evoked through electrical stimulation of the nerve is critical to conveying meaningful 
information about contact events and for closed-loop control of upper limb neuroprostheses (9). 
In particular, modulation of perceived magnitude can convey information about contact pressure 
(4). The output of pressure sensors can be converted into stimulation such that the sensory 
magnitude of the evoked percept is appropriate to the level of pressure applied (43). The key 
finding of the present study for the field of neuroprosthetics is that the effect of manipulations of 
PW and PF on perceived intensity can be systematically predicted based on a single quantity, the 
ACR, which can be readily computed for any stimulation pulse train. Indeed, perceived 
magnitude could be predicted from this simple quantity in two subjects using three different 
approaches (intensity discrimination, magnitude estimation, intensity matching). To scale 
perceived intensity, stimulation could vary in PF, PW, or both PF and PW. Since modulation of 
PF is predicted to affect the rate of axon firing but not the number of axons, PF is not expected to 
change the location and quality of the perception. Modulating PW is predicted to change the 
number of fibers activated and consequently may include concomitant changes in quality or 
location of sensation. Prior findings show that patterns of varied PW can change the quality of 
sensation (5). The results from this study suggested that PF could be co-varied to control ACR, 
and hence intensity, independently of quality. Functionally, if the maximum PF is 500 Hz and 
 the maximum pulse charge is 0.25 µC (the charge density limit for our electrodes), 20 intensity 
levels can be reliably discriminated from just above threshold to this maximum intensity. This 
wide dynamic range is predicted to considerably improve the dexterity of manual manipulation 
with actuated neuroprostheses. 
Tactile intensity and quality are conveyed through separate neural codes 
Of course, there is more to touch than magnitude. The quality of the sensation also conveys 
important information about the nature of a stimulus and its dynamics. While sensation quality 
was not systematically tested in these experiments, subjects reported experiencing non-painful 
tactile sensations, using words such as “pressure”, “tingling”, “vibration”, “tapping”, and “touch” 
when prompted to describe the sensations. We propose that, while sensory magnitude is 
determined by the amount of activity in the nerve, sensory quality is determined by the 
patterning of this activity. In a previous study, the quality of a percept evoked by electrical 
stimulation of the nerve could be changed by temporally modulating the stimulation and thereby 
changing the evoked spatiotemporal pattern of neuronal activation (5). Combining stimulation 
patterns for quality and ACR for intensity offers independent control of these two aspects of 
sensation. However, the parameters of the stimulation pattern that caused a natural quality of 
sensation were frequency dependent. The interaction of stimulation parameters on the various 
aspects of sensation will require more complex mapping algorithms and more complex 
stimulation patterns.  
Due to limits of the stimulation hardware, the effect of pulse amplitude modulation on sensation 
intensity, rather than pulse width modulation, was not directly tested. The dependence of 
intensity on ACR is thus not known for pulse amplitude modulation of the recruited neural 
population, but the results are expected to be similar to those shown here. Sensation intensity 
was only tested for independent locations of perception. The subjects, however, can feel and 
distinguish simultaneous sensations at multiple points on the hand. The ability to distinguish 
independent levels of sensation and interactions that might arise from multiple simultaneous 
sensations remains to be examined. The next big challenge in somatosensory neuroprostheses is 
to determine how to evoke sensations with predetermined qualities and graded intensities by 
evoking appropriate patterns of peripheral nerve activation while concurrently controlling ACR 
during electrical stimulation (4). 
  
 
Materials and Methods  
Study Design 
The goal of this study was to determine how stimulation pulse width and pulse frequency impact 
the perceived intensity of artificial tactile percepts evoked through electrical stimulation. Tactile 
intensity was assessed in seven electrode contacts in two upper limb amputee volunteers in a 
series of forced-choice tasks for intensity discrimination, perceived magnitude rating, and 
artificial to natural sensation matching. The data were used to create a model of the neural basis 
of perceived intensity. All experiments were double-blinded with randomized stimulus 
presentation order. A computer program controlled stimulation and raw data was analyzed by 
custom programs. 
Subject inclusion criteria included unilateral, upper limb amputees, age 21 or older, who are 
current users of a myoelectric prosthesis or prescribed to use one, and have viable target nerves 
in the residual limb. Potential subjects were excluded because of poor health (uncontrolled 
diabetes, chronic skin ulceration, history of uncontrolled infection, active infection) or the 
presence of significant, uncontrolled persistent pain in the residual or phantom limb.  
Subjects  
Two male unilateral right-arm trans-radial amputees were implanted with Flat Interface Nerve 
Electrodes (FINEs) or CWRU spiral cuffs around their median, ulnar, and radial nerves in 
their residual limbs (see ref. (5) for a complete description of the subjects and implants). Briefly, 
subject 1 had a right trans-radial amputation just proximal to the wrist in 2010 due to a traumatic 
injury, and was implanted in May of 2012 with 8-contact FINEs around his right median and 
ulnar nerves and a 4-contact CWRU spiral cuff around his right radial nerve. Subject 2 had a 
right trans-radial amputation in 2004 due to a traumatic injury, and was implanted in January of 
2013 with 8-contact FINEs around his median, ulnar, and radial nerves. The present study was 
carried out between months 32 and 40 post-implant for subject 1 and months 26 and 32 post-
implant for subject 2. The subjects visited the lab for six-hour testing sessions every 2-6 weeks, 
depending on their availability.  In referring to electrodes in the figures, we have adopted the 
 convention Ex.y, where x denotes the subject (1 or 2) and y denotes the electrode for that subject 
(ranging from 1 to 7). All study devices and procedures were reviewed and governed by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), Cleveland VA 
Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and the Dept. of the Navy Human Research 
Protection Program (DON HRPP).  Informed consent was obtained from both subjects. 
Peripheral nerve stimulation  
All electrical stimuli consisted of trains of charge-balanced, square-wave, biphasic pulses with 
cathodal phase leading delivered by a custom Universal External Control Unit (UECU, 
Cleveland FES Center) stimulator to a single contact in the median nerve cuff (Figure 1). The 
electrical returns consisted of 1 to 3 other contacts in the cuff such that stimulation elicited 
sensations on the palmar surface of the hand and did not interfere with the control of the 
myoelectric prosthesis. On each testing day, we obtained the subject’s threshold on each cathodic 
contact using a two-alternative forced choice tracking paradigm in two stages, focusing on the 
long-PW portion of the strength-duration curve. In stage 1, we found the pulse amplitude (PA) 
threshold: On each trial, stimuli consisted of 5 s long pulse trains at a pulse frequency (PF) of 
100 Hz and a pulse width (PW) of 255 µs, the largest PW achievable with the stimulator, and the 
subject reported if he perceived the stimulus. PA started at 0.3 mA and increased by 0.1 mA until 
the subject reported sensation. In stage 2, we found the PW threshold: PA was held at threshold, 
PW started at 130 µs, and on each trial, decreased by 130/2n when the subject reported sensation 
or increased by 130/2n when the subject did not, where n is the number of reversals. Threshold 
was assumed once the PW step size became less than 5 µs (Figure S2). 
Once threshold was obtained, PW was increased in small steps to determine the range of 
parameters that led to sensations without causing discomfort. The midpoint of the range of PWs 
that elicited sensations was then selected as the set point PW for all subsequent discrimination 
trials. Similarly, stimuli at a range of PFs (at the set point PW) were presented to ensure that 
stimuli were perceptible and comfortable. The location, intensity, and quality of the sensations 
were recorded for several stimuli that spanned the range of PWs and PFs used in the 
discrimination experiments (described below). The quality of sensations tended to remain 
constant over the range of parameters tested. 
 Intensity discrimination  
On each trial, two stimuli were presented, and the subject’s task was to indicate which of the two 
was more intense (Figure 2). Each experimental block comprised 180 trials and subjects were 
given a break between blocks. In each block, each stimulus pair was presented 20 times, and 
both the order of stimuli within the pair and the order of the pairs was varied pseudo-randomly. 
The two pulse trains lasted 1 s and were separated by a 1-s inter-stimulus interval. The subject 
was instructed to ignore any changes in quality, duration, or location of the sensations, if such 
changes were to occur, and to focus solely on the intensity or magnitude of the sensation.  Both 
the subject and the experimenter were blinded to the particular stimulation conditions of each 
trial. Discrimination data were fit with cumulative normal distributions to obtain psychometric 
functions. The just noticeable difference (JND) was estimated as the change in the stimulation 
parameter (PF or PW) that yielded 75% correct performance. Each function yielded two 
estimates of the JND (one for decreases, the other for increases in that parameter relative to the 
reference parameter value), which were then averaged.  
PF discrimination. Stimuli in each pair differed only in PF, with PA and PW held constant at 
their set point values, as described above. Each pair consisted of a stimulus at a reference PF and 
the other was at a test PF. Two reference PFs were tested – 50 Hz and 100 Hz – and, for each 
reference, the test PFs ranged from 25 to 175% of the reference PF with the following caveat: 
because the stimulator could only produce frequencies that were integer millisecond divisions of 
one second (i.e., f = 1/1 ms, 1/2 ms, 1/3 ms, etc), the nearest frequencies to achieve these 
reference percentages were used. Thus for the 100 Hz reference, the test stimuli were 25, 50, 
83.3, 90.91, 100, 111.1, 125, 142.9, 166.7 Hz, and for the 50 Hz reference, the test stimuli were 
12.5, 25, 40, 45.5, 50, 55.6, 62.5, 76.9, 90.9 Hz.  
PW discrimination. Stimuli in each pair differed in PW, with PF held constant at 100 Hz and PA 
at its set value. One stimulus in each pair was the reference stimulus, where the PW was the set 
value used in the frequency discrimination trials. The other stimulus in the pair was the test 
stimulus, with PW typically ranging from 75 to 125% of the reference PW. 
PF & PW discrimination. Stimuli in each pair differed in PW, PF, or both. One stimulus in the 
pair was always the reference stimulus, in which the PF and PW were at their set point values. 
 This reference stimulus was compared to nine test stimuli, that included every possible 
permutation of PF, which took on one of three values (at the reference level, below it, or above 
it), paired with a PW, which also took on one of these three values. The high and low values 
were selected based on prior trials to be slightly greater than or less than one JND (estimated 
from the PF and PW discrimination functions), respectively. For example, the PFs for Subject 1 
were 83.3, 100, and 125 Hz because the PF JND was found to be around 24 Hz on this contact, 
and the PWs were 121, 130, and 139 µs, because the PW JND was found to be around 10 µs on 
this contact. 
Magnitude estimation 
On each trial, a 1 s-long pulse train was delivered and the subject’s task was to state a number 
whose magnitude corresponded to the magnitude of the evoked sensation. If a stimulus was 
imperceptible, it was ascribed the number zero. If one stimulus felt twice as intense as another, it 
was given a number that was twice as large. Subjects were encouraged to use fractions and 
decimals as needed and there was not a maximum value. Trials were separated by at least 3 
seconds to minimize adaptation (see supplemental materials for analysis of effects of adaptation). 
Subjects performed four experimental blocks, each consisting of 67 trials and separated by 
breaks. Ratings were normalized by dividing by the grand mean rating on their respective blocks. 
In some cases, only 3 blocks were run due to time constraints. 
The following three conditions were intermixed in a pseudo-random order in each experimental 
block:  
• PF manipulation: The PW was constant at the reference PW and the PF varied over a 
range from 25 to 166 Hz to be consistent with the discrimination and matching 
experiments. 
• PW manipulation: PF was constant at 100 Hz and the PW varied along the perceptible 
and comfortable range. 
• PF and PW manipulation: The PF and PW spanned the same ranges as the PF and PW 
manipulations but increased together.  
Electrical to mechanical intensity matching 
Indentation stimuli were applied with micron precision ( ±2 µm) using a stage driven by a 
MX80LP servo motor with a 0.5 µm encoder (Parker Hannifin Corp., Cleveland, OH) (Figure 
 S1). The motor was controlled by a ViX250-IH servo driver (Parker Hannifin Corp.) under 
computer control using custom software. The stage was mounted on a stable frame constructed 
from extruded aluminum rods. On each experimental block, the indenter was positioned over the 
(intact) left hand with the tactor centered on the location that matched the projected location of 
the sensations evoked when stimulating through the contact tested on that experimental block. 
The skin was pre-indented by ~ 500 µm to ensure that the tactor maintained contact with the skin 
over the entire block. Each trial consisted of a mechanical stimulus delivered to the intact hand 
paired with an electrical stimulus delivered through a given contact. The stimuli each last 1 s and 
were separated by a 1 s inter-stimulus interval, followed by a response interval. The order of 
presentation of the stimuli (electrical or mechanical first) was randomized. The subject indicated 
which stimulus (mechanical or electrical) felt stronger. Each experimental block was divided into 
sub-blocks during which the electrical stimulus remained constant. Within each sub-block, the 
depth of mechanical indentation increased (decreased) with a step size of 2 dB if the mechanical 
stimulus on the previous trial had been perceived as more (less) intense. In experiments with 
Subject 1, the step size decreased from 2 to 0.25 dB after the first reversal and the sub-block 
ended after the second reversal. In experiments with Subject 2, each sub-block ended as soon as 
the subject’s response reversed. In all experiments, the starting indentation depth was randomly 
selected to span the range of achievable depths. Each electrical stimulus was presented in five 
sub-blocks; sub-blocks with different electrical stimuli were interleaved in pseudorandom order. 
• PF manipulation. Nine PFs were selected to span the range tested in the PF 
discrimination task (12-166 Hz).  
• PW manipulation: Seven PWs were selected to span a range that was both perceptible 
and comfortable. 
Statistical analysis 
All data were reported as mean ± standard deviation. Student’s t-test with alpha = 0.05 was used 
for comparisons between stimulation conditions.

Fig. 1.  Implanted peripheral nerve electrodes deliver stimulation directly to the nerve. 
Electrical stimulation was delivered by an external stimulator (top left) through 
percutaneous leads to Flat Interface Nerve Electrodes (FINEs) implanted on the median, 
ulnar, and radial nerves of an upper limb amputee (bottom left). Stimulation consists of 
trains of square, biphasic, charge-balanced pulses delivered to individual contacts in the 
8-channel FINE. The FINE reshapes the nerve and achieves close proximity between the 
fascicles and the stimulating contacts, improving selectivity. Each electrode contact 
evokes sensory percepts on small regions of the missing hand of the subject.   
 
 
  
Fig. 2. Intensity discrimination performance yields smooth psychometric functions. (A) 
Discrimination performance as a function of comparison pulse frequency (PF). 
Comparison PF is reported as a percentage of reference PF for one electrode E2.6 and 
two reference PFs, 50 and 100 Hz. Points indicate percentage of test stimuli correctly 
identified as stronger or weaker than the reference over 20 pairwise trials, and the dashed 
line is the sigmoidal fit to the raw data. (B) Combined discrimination curves from 
multiple electrode contacts across two subjects under three conditions (PF discrimination, 
50 Hz reference, n=6; PF discrimination, 100 Hz reference, n=7; pulse width (PW) 
discrimination, n=7; solid line denotes the mean and shaded area denotes the SEM). 
Inset: Weber fractions calculated as just noticeable difference (JND) divided by the 
reference value for the three conditions. Weber fractions were significantly lower for PW 
 than either PF condition (t-test, p<0.001 for both), but did not differ between PF at 50 Hz 
and PF at 100 Hz (t-test, p=0.61). Open circles denote all data, bars denote the mean and 
SEM, filled circles correspond to curves in A. (C) Intensity discrimination performance 
with variations of both PF and PW averaged across subjects (n=2). Values indicate the 
percentage of times that a particular test stimulus was identified as stronger than the 
reference stimulus (center square). The reference was compared to nine test stimuli that 
varied in both PW and PF, and included combinations of the following: lower than the 
reference PF level, at the reference PF level, higher than the reference PF level; lower 
than the reference PW level, at the reference PW level, higher than the reference PW 
level. The high and low PF and PW values were chosen to be slightly greater than or less 
than one JND, respectively, as determined by testing shown in A and B. The stimulus 
with the highest PW and PF is in the lower right corner and the stimulus with the lowest 
PW and PF is in the upper left. Whenever one or both of the parameters increased, the 
percentage of times the stimulus was judged stronger than the reference increased.

Fig. 5. Graphical representations of hypothesized neural response to stimulation intensity 
and spike frequency. (A) Recruitment of nerve fibers is hypothesized to increase with 
increased stimulation intensity (charge per pulse). Arrow indicates the putative location 
of the perceptual threshold. (B) Neural population firing rate as a function of activation 
charge rate. Assuming each pulse produces one spike per activated fiber, this yields an 
approximately linear function. Threshold is assumed to be independent of pulse 
frequency (see Fig. S3). 
 
 
  
Fig. 6. Activation charge rate determines perceived intensity. (A) Intensity discrimination: 
performance as a function of activation charge rate (ACR), accounting for adaptation (see 
Fig. S4, S5). Inset: Weber fractions obtained from the three stimulation conditions: pulse 
width (PW), pulse frequency (PF) at 50 Hz, PF at 100 Hz. Weber fractions were 
consistent across the stimulation paradigms (t-test, p=0.61, 0.25, and 0.61). (B) 
Magnitude estimation: perceived intensity as a function of ACR for the PW, PF, and 
combined PF and PW manipulation, averaged across electrodes (n=4). The shaded area 
denotes SEM. Inset: Comparison of regression slopes obtained when varying PW, PF, or 
PW and PF for each electrode. Each blue point compares the slope of the PF 
manipulation to the slope of the combined PW and PF manipulation for a single electrode 
contact (n=4). Each red point compares the slope of the PW manipulation to the slope of 
the combined PW and PF manipulation for a single electrode contact (n=4). (C) 
Normalized indentation depth matched for perceived intensity as a function of activation 
charge rate, averaged across electrodes (n=5). Shaded area denotes SEM. Inset: 
Comparison of regression slopes obtained when varying PF or PW for each electrode 
(n=5). (D) Magnitude estimates of intensity as a function of the activation charge rate for 
 the PW, PF, and combined PW and PF manipulation for each electrode. Slopes were 
consistent across stimulation conditions (t-test, p>0.05 for all comparisons, except 
leftmost panel p=0.0059). (E) Indentation depth matched for perceived intensity as a 
function of activation charge rate for each electrode. Slopes were consistent across 
stimulation conditions (t-test, p>0.05 for all).
