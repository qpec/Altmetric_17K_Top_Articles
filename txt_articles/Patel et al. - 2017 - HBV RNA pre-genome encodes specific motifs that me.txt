Supplementary Figure 1. Characterising HBV VLPs from E.coli and SELEX protocol.  
(a) Hydrodynamic radial distribution and negative stain EM image of Alexa Fluor-488 
labelled HBV VLPs purified from E.coli. Integration of peak yields suggests a roughly 
2:1 ratio of T=4 (red circle, 63%) and T=3 (blue circle, 37%) VLPs. Scale bar represents 
100 nm. (b) SELEX protocol showing selection for aptamers with high affinity to HBV 
185 Cp. HBV VLPs were immobilised onto carboxylic magnetic beads (brown circles) 
and dissociated into Cp dimers (green and grey rectangles) using guanidinium chloride. 
An RNA pool encompassing a random region (40N) was enriched for sequences with 
affinity for Cp by repeated cycles of binding to these beads, partitioning and 
amplification. Negative selections at each round used carboxylic acid beads which had 
been treated with NHS-EDC and inactivated with Tris. Stringency was increased after 
 3 
 
round 5 by decreasing the number of positive beads by half and increasing the number 
of washes from 8 to 10. The reverse transcriptase-PCR products at the end of each 
round were analyzed by native PAGE to confirm the isolation of products for the next 
round of selection. The 10th round products were converted to DNA and sequenced.  
 
 
Supplementary Figure 2. PS oligo structures, example smFCS trace and EMs of PS 
containing VLPs.  
(a) PS1-3 and ε secondary structures, made using VARNA software1, were predicted in 
Mfold. Preferred sites were taken from the HBV genome, NC_003977.1, at positions: 
PS1(1717-1751), PS2(2602-2633) and PS3(2765-2798). In order to make them all the same length 
(47 nucleotides) to avoid effects of charge differences the following additions were 
made; PS1, 5ʹ - GGGUUUUGG and CCC - 3ʹ; PS2, 5ʹ - GGGUUUUGGGG and CCCC - 3ʹ; 
 4 
 
PS3, 5ʹ- GGGUUUUGG and CCCC - 3ʹ. The consensus motif RGAG is highlighted in red 
in each of the loops. The stability of each RNA fold, as predicted by Mfold, is shown 
below each structure. 
 
(b) Example smFCS assay. Rh values for, fluorescently labelled RNAs are determined 
before and after Cp is titrated in at fixed time points (vertical dashed lines), allowing 
the Rh values to equilibrate after each step. The faint red trace represents real time, 
raw signal while the thick red line represents smoothed data. PS1 Rh initially climbs 
slowly, until a threshold Cp concentration, which triggers rapid assembly into a T=3 or 
T=4 VLP (Rh ~24-32 nm, orange dashed lines) as determined by measurements of 
Alexa-Flour 488 labelled HBV particles from E.coli (Supplementary Figure 1a). At the 
end of each titration, the complexes formed are challenged by addition of RNase A. 
An unchanged Rh is assumed to mean that the test RNA has been encapsidated in a 
closed VLP. The time scale on which this occurs is indicated in the bottom right.  
 
(c) TEMs from assembly reactions of PS1, 2, 3 and Cp alone and unlabelled PS1 in 
Figure 3. Large white particles in Cp alone and Unlabelled PS1 TEMs are latex beads. 
Also present is TEM from empty particle assembly described in Sup Table 2. These 
empty HBV particles were assembled at much higher concentrations of Cp (1.5 µM) 
and in the absence of RNA. Scale bars represent 100 nm.

Supplementary Figure 3. smFCS assays of PS1 variants  
(a) smFCS assays of the PS1 variants (structures top left) and accompanying 
hydrodynamic radial distributions plotted in 2 nm bins and fitted with Gaussian peaks 
below, as colour coded in the key. 15 nM PS1 (black), PS1 loop mutant (dark orange) 
bulge mutant (dark blue) and epsilon (green) RNAs were tested for their ability to form 
VLPs under single molecule conditions. Vertical dotted lines indicate points of addition 
of Cp with the final concentrations shown in nM. Samples were allowed to equilibrate 
between additions. RNase A was added to check for correctly formed particles. 
Samples were taken prior to RNase A addition for analysis by TEM shown right, both 
here and throughout this figure. (b) - as (a) with RNA oligos PS1 (dashed black), L1 
(green), L2 (red) and L3 (blue). (c) - as (a) with RNA oligos PS1 (dashed black), L4 
(magenta), L5 (cyan) and B1 (light green). (d) as (a) with RNA oligos PS1 (dashed black) 
and DNA oligo PS1. Scale bars represent 100 nm. PS1 controls (dashed black) in each 
 6 
 
panel were repeated for individual batches of purified Cp, accounting for the 
variations in assembly efficiency seen. smFCS and TEM were repeated in triplicate.

Supplementary Figure 4. Role(s) of ARD and its charge on assembly.  
(a) smFCS assays of 15 nM PS1 with Cp (grey) and Cp149 (cyan) and accompanying 
hydrodynamic radial distributions plotted in 2 nm bins and fitted with Gaussian peaks 
below. EM images of particles are shown (right). (b) as (a) with PS1 and Cp (black), 
kinase and Cp pre equilibrated and added to PS1 (cyan) and PS1 and Cp with kinase 
added simultaneously (magenta). TEMs are shown right. Scale bars represent 100 nm. 
PS1 controls (black) in each panel were repeated for individual batches of purified Cp, 
accounting for the variations in assembly efficiency seen. smFCS and TEM were 
repeated in triplicate. 
 
 
 
 
Supplementary Figure 5. ARD structure in T=4 and T=3 VLPs.  
Slabs (~30 Å thick) through the structures of the icosahedrally-averaged T=4 particle 
at 4.7 Å (left), the same T=4 structure low pass filtered to 7 Å (middle), and the T=3 
particle at 5.6 Å (right). A Cp dimer is fitted into each. Even at a slightly lower 
resolution than the T=3 VLP, there is no equivalent density for the ARD in the T=4 
VLP, confirming that it has different conformations in each particle.

Supplementary Table 2: Association of Alexa-Fluor-488 labelled PS1 with Cp.  
Anisotropy was used to determine if 15 nM of Alexa-Fluor-488 labelled RNA PS oligos 
can bind to, or enter, 125 nM of preformed shells of Cp. The latter were formed by 
reassembly in the absence of RNA at high concentration2 (Supplementary Fig 2c). 
Fluorescence polarisation values are influenced by the mass of the dye-labelled 
species3. The polarisation value for PS1 oligo goes down following addition of RNase, 
as expected but remains unchanged when incorporated in VLPs assembled in the 
presence of the oligo. When labelled PS1 is added to the empty Cp VLP its fluorescence 
emission is unaffected, suggesting that it is not quenched, and it remains RNase 
sensitive confirming that it does not bind the outside of the protein shell or get 
internalised.

T=4 sized species, and the third indicates RNase protection. “-” indicates failure in 
that assay.
