ABSTRACT
Obesity is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for breast cancer de-
velopment. However, the molecular basis of obesity-related breast carcinogenesis re-
mains elusive. In this study, we have shown that obesity reduces the level of the tu-
mor suppressor p16INK4A protein in breast adipocytes, which showed active features
and strong procarcinogenic potential both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xeno-
grafts compared to mature adipocytes from lean women. Furthermore, obesity trig-
gered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast ductal epithelial cells. In-
terestingly, specific downregulation of p16INK4A increased the expression/secretion
levels of various adipokines, including leptin, and activated breast adipocytes from
lean women. Consequently, like breast adipocytes from obese women, p16-deficient
adipocytes induced EMT in normal primary breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent
manner and enhanced tumor growth. Additionally, we have shown that p16INK4A nega-
tively controls leptin at the mRNA level through microRNAs 141 and 146b-5p (miR-141
and miR-146b-5p), which bind the leptin mRNA at a specific sequence in the 3= untrans-
lated region (UTR). These results show that obesity activates breast stromal adipocytes
through p16 downregulation, which upregulates leptin and promotes procarcinogenic
processes.

reast cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-
related death in women worldwide (1, 2). In recent years, multiple reports have
shown obesity as a serious risk factor for the development of breast cancer (3).
However, the link between obesity and this deadly disease remains unclear. Therefore,
unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related breast carcinogenesis
may help improve the prevention of breast cancer and/or the treatment of patients.
Adipocytes, which accumulate with obesity, are the major components in the breast
microenvironment, and along with their secreted factors, they represent key players in
stroma-epithelium interactions (4). As an important paracrine mediator, the adipokine
leptin, encoded by the LEP gene, has been correlated with breast cancer occurrence
(5–7). Leptin exerts its biological functions through binding to its receptor (obesity
receptor [OBR]), which activates multiple downstream signaling pathways such as
JAK2/STAT3, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT (8). Through autocrine, endocrine, and paracrine effects, leptin may modu-
late many aspects of breast tumorigenesis from initiation and primary tumor growth to
metastatic progression. Moreover, leptin is able to shape the tumor microenvironment

 within the mammary gland by inducing multiple concurrent events, such as mi-
gration of endothelial cells, angiogenesis, and recruitment of macrophages and
monocytes (6, 9).
It is still unclear how the expression/secretion of these adipokines is regulated. In
breast stromal fibroblasts, it has been shown that tumor suppressor genes, such as
p16INK4A (p16), play major roles in repressing the expression/secretion of several
cancer-promoting cytokines (10).
p16 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (CDKI) encoded by the CDKN2A
gene (11, 12). In the absence of p16, both mice and humans are predisposed to
cancer, and the gene is frequently inactivated in many tumor types, which shows
the important role of this gene in tumor suppression (13–16). Additionally, p16 has
a non-cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive function and also regulates the expres-
sion of several genes (17, 18). We have recently shown that p16 negatively regulates
AUF1 through positive control of microRNA (miRNA) 141 (miR-141) and miR-146b-
5p, which repress AUF1 expression (17, 19, 20). miR-141 and miR-146b-5p are two
important tumor suppressor microRNAs which control several cancer-related genes
and processes, such as the prometastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) process (19, 21, 22).
We have shown in the present report that adipocytes from obese women are active
and express low levels of p16. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that p16 down-
regulation activates breast stromal adipocytes and enhances their procarcinogenic
effects in a leptin-dependent manner. This p16-dependent repression of leptin is
mediated through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. Additionally, we provide clear evidence
that obesity induces EMT in breast epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS
Generation and characterization of mature adipocytes from cancer-free breast
tissues. Adipose tissues were obtained from 15 breast tissues derived from healthy
cancer-free women who underwent mammoplasty (8 obese patients, having a body
mass index [BMI] of �30, and 7 lean patients, having a BMI of �30) with mean ages of
30.5 and 32.2, respectively. Adipose tissues were processed, and preadipocytes were
cultured; when confluent, they were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes.
Under these conditions, cells became larger, and the cytoplasm gradually increased and
accumulated small lipid droplets, which were visualized by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 1A).
These adipocytes also stained positive for other differentiated-adipocyte markers,
namely, leptin, FABP4, perilipin A, GLUT-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�), fatty
acid synthase, adiponectin, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor � (PPAR-�)
(Fig. 1A). This indicates that adipocytes were well separated from the other stromal cells
and differentiated and therefore were considered to be highly homogenous with
minimal contamination.
p16 is downregulated in breast stromal adipocytes derived from obese cancer-
free females. The p16 expression was first assessed in differentiated adipocytes
derived from obese women (Obadi-1 to -8 cells) and lean women (Leadi-1 to -7 cells),
which were used simultaneously at low passage numbers (2 to 4 passages postdiffer-
entiation). Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and specific anti-p16 antibody was
utilized for immunoblotting using anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(anti-GAPDH) antibody as an internal control. Figure 1B shows that the level of p16 is
much lower in all Obadi cells than in Leadi cells, independently of the age of the
females. In contrast, the level of leptin was higher in all Obadi cells than in Leadi cells
(Fig. 1B). Similarly, p16 was found downregulated and leptin was upregulated in 15
adipose tissues derived from obese women compared to levels in those derived from
lean women (Fig. 1C).
Next, we assessed the level of the CDKN2A and LEP mRNAs in the same cells by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). To this end, total RNA was prepared,
and specific primers for CDKN2A, LEP, and GAPDH (used for normalization) were utilized
for amplification. The data in Fig. 1D show a strong decrease in the CDKN2A mRNA level

 in Obadi cells compared with the level in Leadi cells, while the level of the LEP mRNA
was higher in Obadi than in Leadi cells. This shows that the levels of the CDKN2A and
LEP mRNAs reflect that of the corresponding proteins in normal adipocytes, indicating
that the decrease in the p16 protein level in Obadi cells is due, at least in part, to a
decrease in the level of its corresponding transcript. In addition, these results indicate
the presence of a negative correlation between p16 and leptin in breast stromal
adipocytes (BSAd).
To investigate whether obesity has a role in the stability of the CDKN2A mRNA in
BSAd, three Obadi and three Leadi cell cultures were treated with the transcription
inhibitor actinomycin D and then reincubated for different periods of time (0 to 6 h).
Total RNA was prepared, and the mRNA level of CDKN2A was assessed by qRT-PCR.
Figure 1E shows that the CDKN2A mRNA is more stable in Leadi cells than in Obadi cells.
Indeed, while the CDKN2A mRNA half-life in Leadi cells was 135 min, it was only 18 min
in Obadi cells. This shows that obesity plays a major role in the destabilization of the
CDKN2A mRNA in normal human BSAd.
Obadi cells have higher migration, invasion, and proliferation capabilities and
secrete higher levels of adipokines than Leadi cells. Next, the migration and
invasion as well as proliferation capabilities of Obadi and Leadi cells (4 each) were
assessed using an xCelligence system. The experiment shown in Fig. 2A demonstrates
that Obadi cells have stronger migration/invasion and proliferation capabilities than
Leadi cells. To confirm that these cells are indeed mature adipocytes and did not
dedifferentiate to mesenchymal stem cells, we assessed the expression levels of some
relevant markers. Figure 2B shows that five Obadi and two Leadi cells expressed very
low levels of the pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog compared to the levels in
mesenchymal stem cells (BM-04). On the other hand, while BM-04 cells expressed very
low levels of the mature adipocyte markers Glut-4 and PPAR-�, Obadi and Leadi cells
expressed high levels of these two proteins (Fig. 2B).
Figure 2C shows that the expression levels of total and active/phosphorylated forms
of the proinvasive/migratory and proliferative protein kinases AKT and extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (23, 24) were very high in Obadi cells
compared to levels in Leadi cells. In addition, the expression level of phospho-STAT3
(P-STAT3), the transmitter of leptin signaling (25), but not total STAT3 was higher in
Obadi cells than in Leadi cells (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected from three
Obadi and three Leadi cells and then applied to Ray Bio human adipokine antibody
arrays. Great differentials in the levels of various adipokines were observed between
Obadi and Leadi cells, including, leptin, interleukin-1� (IL-1�), IL-8, IL-6, and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Fig. 2D). This result was confirmed by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which showed that Obadi cells secrete higher levels of
leptin, IL-1�, and IL-6 than Leadi cells (Fig. 2E). Figure 2C shows that the levels of the
NF-�B (p65), IL-1�, IL-6, and Cox-2 proteins were significantly higher in Obadi than in
Leadi cells, which shows the proinflammatory status of Obadi cells. Together, these
results imply that breast adipocytes derived from obese women are active and may
exhibit procarcinogenic effects.
Obadi cells enhance the migratory and the invasive abilities of primary human
breast luminal cells in a paracrine fashion. To confirm the active status of Obadi cells,
we investigated the possible paracrine procarcinogenic effects of Obadi cells on normal
breast luminal cells (LeaL-10 cells). To this end, SFCM from four Obadi and four Leadi
cells was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied onto exponentially growing
LeaL-10 cells for 24 h (serum-free medium [SFM] was used as a negative control), and
their proliferation rates as well as their migration/invasion capabilities were measured.
Figure 3A shows that cells treated with SFCM from Obadi cultures (Obadi-SFCM)
strongly increased the proliferation rate as well as the migration/invasion capacities of
LeaL-10 cells compared to levels with Leadi-SFCM treatment, which had only a minor
effect on their proliferation compared to treatment with SFM. Furthermore, SFCM from
Obadi cells strongly increased the level of Ki-67 compared to treatment with SFM,

 whereas SFCM from Leadi cells had no effect. In addition, whereas SFCM from both
types of adipocytes had no effect on the expression level of total AKT, SFCM from Obadi

 invasion abilities of normal breast luminal cells through the activation of AKT in a
paracrine manner.
Obadi cells stimulate EMT in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent
manner. Upon exposure of LeaL-10 cells to SFCM from Obadi cells, the levels of the
epithelial markers E-cadherin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCam) were
strongly reduced, and the levels of the mesenchymal N-cadherin and Twist-1 proteins
were potently increased compared to levels with SFM treatment (Fig. 3B). However,
SFCM from Leadi cells had only marginal effects on the levels of these proteins (Fig. 3B).
To simulate the in vivo situation and the presence of the basement membrane,
LeaL-10 cells were grown in three-dimensional (3D) cultures in a network containing a
mesh (basement membrane mimic), which separated cells from Obadi-SFCM, Leadi-
SFCM, or SFM for 48 h, and then RNA was purified and used for qRT-PCR. Figure 3C
shows a clear decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and a clear increase in the
expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, Zeb-1, and Twist-1 in cells cultured with
Obadi-SFCM compared to levels in control cells (SFM). However, the expression levels
of these EMT-related transcripts did not change in cells cultured with Leadi-SFCM
compared to levels in control cells. This indicates that secreted factors can penetrate
the basement membrane and affect luminal cells cultured in 3D. Together, these results
indicate that Obadi cells enhance the carcinogenesis of normal breast luminal cells
through induction of the EMT process in a paracrine manner.
In an attempt to investigate the possible role of leptin in the paracrine pro-EMT
effect of Obadi cells in luminal cells, SFCM from Obadi cells was challenged with either
anti-IgG antibody or antileptin neutralizing antibody and applied onto the LeaL-10 cells
for 24 h. Figure 3D and E show that leptin inhibition suppressed the effect of
Obadi-SFCM in enhancing the migration/invasion as well as the proliferative abilities of
LeaL-10 cells. In addition, the EMT-triggering effect of Obadi-SFCM was normalized by
inhibiting leptin (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, adding pure recombinant human leptin protein
to Leadi-SFCM strongly enhanced the migration/invasion as well as proliferation abil-
ities of LeaL-10 cells compared to those with Leadi-SFCM treatment (Fig. 3D) and
activated the EMT process in LeaL-10 cells (Fig. 3E). This shows that the paracrine
procarcinogenic effects of Obadi cells is mediated through increased leptin secretion.
To investigate the possible role of leptin in the activation of mature adipocytes,
leptin was downregulated in Obadi-1 cells using a specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA),
and a scrambled sequence was used as control. The generated cells (Obadi-sh and
Obadi-C, respectively) were used to prepare whole-cell lysates, and the level of the
leptin protein was assessed by immunoblotting using whole-cell lysates from Leadi-1
cells as a control. Figure 4A shows a strong reduction in the level of the leptin protein
in Obadi-sh cells compared to levels in their control counterparts, with the level in
Obadi-sh cells level similar to that observed in Leadi-1 cells. Figure 4B shows that
downregulation of leptin in Obadi-1 cells decreased their migration and proliferation
compared to those of their control counterparts. Furthermore, the levels of AKT/P-AKT,
ERK/P-ERK1/2, STAT3/P-STAT3, and NF-�B (p65) were also reduced in Obadi-sh cells
compared to those in Obadi-C cells and reached levels similar to those observed in
Leadi-1 cells (Fig. 4A). This implies that leptin activates the proliferative and migratory
abilities of adipocytes through the activation of the STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 pathways.
Next, SFCM was collected from Obadi-sh-2, Obadi-sh-3, and Obadi-C cells and
applied onto LeaL-10 cells for 24 h in order to test the paracrine effects. SFM was used
as a negative control. Figure 4C shows that while SFCM from Obadi-C cells strongly
increased the proliferation rate and the migration capability of LeaL-10 cells, SFCM from
Obadi-sh-2 and Obadi-sh-3 decreased these abilities. Additionally, while SFCM from
Obadi-C cells induced EMT, SFCM from Obadi-sh cells had an effect similar to that of
SFM (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained for the proliferative marker Ki-67 and the
proinvasive kinase AKT (Fig. 4D). This indicates that leptin stimulates the procarcino-
genic effects of breast stromal adipocytes.

 Obadi cells stimulate breast cancer xenograft growth in mice. SCID female mice
(n � 20) were randomized into five groups, and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts
were created under nipple by coimplantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2 � 106) with
Obadi or Leadi cells (2 � 106). As a control MDA-MB-231 cells (2 � 106) were injected
alone. Although all mice coinjected with MDA-MB-231 and adipocytes developed
tumors 2 weeks after injection, tumors containing Obadi cells (T-Obadi) grew faster
than those containing Leadi cells (T-Leadi) (Fig. 5A). However, injection of MDA-MB-231
alone did not result in any tumors. These results show that Obadi cells can promote
breast cancer formation and growth in SCID mice.
To further elucidate the role of Obadi cells in tumor growth, whole-cell extracts were
prepared from T-Obadi-1, T-Obadi-2, T-Leadi-1, and T-Leadi-2 cells, and the levels of
various EMT-related proteins were assessed by immunoblotting. While the levels of the
epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were much higher in T-Leadi than in T-Obadi
tumors, the levels of the mesenchymal N-cadherin, Snail, Zeb-1, and Twist-1 proteins
were much higher in T-Obadi than in T-Leadi tumors. In addition, whereas the total
levels of the AKT protein were similar in all four tumors, the level of the phosphorylated
form of the protein was much higher in T-Obadi tumors than in T-Leadi tumors. Also,
the level of the Ki-67 protein was much higher in T-Obadi than in T-Leadi tumors (Fig.
5B and C), which explains the faster growth of T-Obadi tumors.

T-Obadi than in T-Leadi tumors, the level of the CD24 protein was lower in T-Obadi than

 in T-Leadi tumors. This indicates an Obadi-dependent increase in markers of mammary
cancer stem cells (CSC) within the formed orthotopic tumor xenografts although
immunoblotting does not reveal what cell type these changes occurred in. Together,
these results show that adipocytes from obese females are active and procarcinogenic
both in vitro and in vivo.
Obesity promotes EMT in breast ductal epithelial cells. To investigate the
possible effect of adipocytes on breast ductal epithelial cells in vivo, 10 formalin-fixed/
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissues (five from obese and five from lean women)
were utilized to assess the expression of EMT markers by immunofluorescence. Figure
6A shows that while ducts in breast tissues originating from lean women (L-2) stained
positive for EpCam and negative for vimentin, ducts obtained from obese women (O-1)
stained positive for vimentin but expressed low levels of EpCam. The level of Ki-67 was
also higher from breast ducts of obese women than from those of lean ones (Fig. 6B).
Next, we assessed EMT in breast ductal luminal cells isolated from three obese (ObeL
cells) and three lean (LeaL cells) women by immunofluorescence. Figure 6C shows that
ObeL-1 cells stained positive for vimentin but not for E-cadherin. However, LeaL-1 cells
stained negative for vimentin but positive for E-cadherin. The mRNA level of EMT-
related markers was also assessed in ObeL and LeaL cells by qRT-PCR. Figure 6D shows
that while the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were higher in
LeaL cells than in ObeL cells, the levels of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and
Zeb-1 were higher in ObeL than in LeaL cells. Ki-67 was also 9-fold higher in ObeL than
in LeaL cells (Fig. 6E). In addition, the proliferation rate of ObeL cells was much higher
than that of LeaL cells (Fig. 6F).
Together, these data indicate that obesity triggers EMT in breast ductal epithelial
cells in vivo and in primary normal luminal cells in vitro.
Downregulation of p16 activates mature breast adipocytes and enhances their

 were significantly higher in Leadi-sh cells than in Leadi-C cells. Similarly, the adipokine
array shows that p16 downregulation strongly increased the levels of several secreted
adipokines, including leptin, IL-1�, IL-1�, IL-8, TPAI-1, MCP-1, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 (Fig.
7C). This result was confirmed by ELISA, which showed that downregulation of p16 in
Leadi cells increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-1�, and IL-8 compared to levels in control
cells (Fig. 7D). This suggests that p16 represses the expression/secretion of procarci-
nogenic/proinflammatory proteins in breast stromal adipocytes.

 cells, we investigated the paracrine effect of Leadi-sh cells on normal breast luminal
cells. Figure 8A shows that while SFCM from Leadi-C cells had only a slight effect, SFCM
from Leadi-sh adipocytes strongly increased the proliferation rate and the migration/
invasion capabilities of LeaL-10 cells. Additionally, while SFCM from Leadi-C cells had
only marginal effects, SFCM from Leadi-sh cells strongly induced the EMT process
compared to the effect with SFM (Fig. 8B). This indicates that p16 represses the
procarcinogenic effects of adipocytes by inhibiting the paracrine pro-EMT process.
Next, LeaL-10 cells were grown in 3D cultures in a network containing a mesh, which
separated cells from Leadi-sh-SFCM, Leadi-C-SFCM, or SFM for 48 h, and then RNA was
purified and used for qRT-PCR. Figure 8C shows a clear decrease in the expression of
E-cadherin and a clear increase in the expression levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail,
Zeb-1, and Twist-1 in cells cultured with Leadi-sh-SFCM compared to levels in control
cells (SFM). However, the expression levels of these EMT-related transcripts did not
change in cells cultured with Leadi-C-SFCM compared to control cell levels. This
indicates that Leadi-sh-SFCM-secreted factors can penetrate the basement membrane
and affect luminal cells grown in 3D.
In an attempt to investigate the possible implication of leptin in the paracrine
pro-EMT effect of p16-deficient BSAd, SFCM from Leadi-sh cells was challenged with
either anti-IgG antibody or with antileptin neutralizing antibody and applied onto the
LeaL-10 cells for 24 h. Figure 8B shows that leptin inhibition suppressed the effect of
Leadi-sh-SFCM in triggering EMT and enhancing the migratory/invasive and prolifera-
tive abilities of LeaL-10 cells. This shows that the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of
p16 deficiency are mediated through increased leptin secretion from BSAd.
To further confirm the implication of leptin in the paracrine pro-EMT effect of
p16-deficient BSAd, Leadi1-sh cells were first transfected with a plasmid bearing
leptin-shRNA-3 (Leadi1-sh-LEPsh) or scrambled sequence (Leadi1-sh-C) as a control.
Figure 8D shows a strong reduction in the level of the leptin protein in Leadi1-sh-LEPsh
cells compared to the control level. Figure 8E shows that downregulation of leptin in
Leadi1-sh cells decreased their migration and proliferation abilities compared to those
of their control counterparts and became similar to those of Leadi1-C cells. Further-
more, while downregulation of leptin had no effect on the level of total AKT and
ERK1/2, the levels of the active/phosphorylated forms of these kinases were strongly
decreased (Fig. 8D). This implies that p16 represses the proliferative/migratory abilities
of adipocytes through targeting leptin and the inhibition of the AKT and ERK1/2
pathways.
We next showed that exposure of LeaL-10 cells to SFCM from Leadi1-sh-LEPsh
decreased their migration ability compared to that of Leadi1-sh-C cells and resulted in
a level similar to that observed upon exposure to SFCM from Leadi1-C cells (Fig. 8F).
Additionally, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were strongly
increased, and the levels of the mesenchymal marker proteins N-cadherin and Twist-1
were potently reduced compared to levels in cells treated with SFCM from Leadi1-sh
(Fig. 8G). This shows that the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of p16 deficiency are
mediated through increased leptin secretion from BSAd.
p16-deficient Leadi cells stimulate the growth of orthotopic xenografts in
mice. To investigate the effect of p16 downregulation in Leadi cells on tumor growth
in vivo, 15 SCID female mice were randomized into three groups, and breast cancer
xenografts were created under nipple by coimplantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2 � 106)
with Leadi-sh (T-Leadi-sh) or Leadi-C cells (T-Leadi-C) (2 � 106). As a control 2 � 106
MDA-MB-231 cells were injected alone. Although all mice coinjected with MDA-MB-231
and adipocytes developed tumors 2 weeks after injection, T-Leadi-sh tumors grew
faster (Fig. 9A) and formed bigger tumors (Fig. 9B) than T-Leadi-C tumors. No tumors
were obtained by injecting MDA-MB-231 cells alone. These results show that p16
downregulation in Leadi cells stimulates their procarcinogenic effects and promotes
breast cancer formation in vivo. Interestingly, Leadi-sh adipocytes increased the ex-
pression of the proliferative markers Ki-67 and PCNA and enhanced EMT and
stemness in breast cancer cells (Fig. 9C and D). Together, these data indicate that

 downregulation of p16 in Leadi cells activates these cells and enhances their procar-
cinogenic effects in vivo.
p16 negatively regulates the expression of leptin. To further elucidate the
molecular and functional link between p16 and leptin, we assessed the level of the LEP
mRNA in Leadi-sh and Leadi-C adipocytes by qRT-PCR. Figure 10A shows that the
downregulation of p16 increased the level of the LEP mRNA 3.5-fold, suggesting that
p16 represses the expression of leptin at the transcriptional/posttranscriptional level.
Moreover, p16 downregulation significantly increased the secreted level of leptin
(45-fold) (Fig. 10B). Furthermore, downregulation of p16 in Leadi cells significantly
upregulated several leptin targets, including IL-8, TNF-�, and BCL-2.
miR-141 and miR-146b-5p mediate the p16-negative regulation of leptin in
adipocytes. To investigate the possible implication of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p
microRNAs in the p16-dependent negative regulation of leptin, Leadi-C and Leadi-sh
cells were transfected with plasmids bearing pre-miR-141, pre-miR-146b-5p, or an
empty vector used as control. Figure 10D shows that ectopic expression of pre-miR-141
or pre-miR-146b-5p in Leadi-C or Leadi-sh cells increased the expression of the mature
forms of these miRNAs. The expression of pre-miR-141 or pre-miR-146b-5p reduced the
level of the LEP mRNA 3-fold in Leadi-C and 27-fold in Leadi-sh cells (Fig. 10E). This
indicates that miR-141 and miR-146b-5p are potential negative regulators of leptin and
mediate the p16-dependent negative regulation of the gene.

 To further evaluate the contribution of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p in the negative
regulation of leptin, miR-141 and miR-146b-5p were inhibited by specific anti-miRNAs
(miRZips) in Leadi-C cells, which express both miRNAs, and a nonspecific sequence was
used as a control. Figure 10F shows that the inhibition of miR-141 or miR-146b-5p
increased the level of the LEP mRNA in Leadi-C cells. These results indicate that, like p16,
miR-141 and miR-146b-5p negatively regulate leptin expression.
miR-141 and miR-146b-5p control LEP mRNA expression via its 3= UTR. The
analysis of miRNA databases showed that the LEP 3= untranslated region (UTR) contains
two potential binding sites for miR-141 located at bases 737 to 743 (mirSVR score,
�0.2069) and 1282 to 1288 (mirSVR score, �0.0849) and one potential binding site for
miR-146b-5p located at bases 689 to 695 (mirSVR score, �0.1641) (Fig. 11A). These
regions are highly conserved among different species (Fig. 11B).
Next, we evaluated the potential contribution of the miR-141 and miR-146b-5p
binding sites in the LEP mRNA 3= UTR to the control of LEP expression. To this end,
intact LEP 3= UTR or mutated sequence for these binding sites was inserted into a
luciferase/Renilla reporter vector (Fig. 11C) and introduced into Leadi-C cells. Figure
11D shows that the reporter activity fused to the mutated sequence of the LEP 3= UTR
was significantly increased in Leadi-C cells compared to that of the wild-type sequence.
Interestingly, the reporter activity was further increased by mutating the sequences of
both the miR-141 and miR-146b-5p binding sites.
Furthermore, the reporter activity was increased compared to the level in the
control cells when miR-141 or miR-146b-5p was inhibited in Leadi-C cells (Fig. 11E). This
effect was abolished by mutating the putative miR-141 or miR-146b-5p binding sites
within the 3= UTR of the LEP mRNA (Fig. 11E). This indicates that the effect of miR-141
and miR-146b-5p on LEP is mediated through interaction with their seed sequence in
the LEP 3= UTR.
miR-141 and miR-146b-5p levels are reduced in Obadi cells. Next, total RNA was
prepared from five Obadi and five Leadi cells, and the levels of mature miR-141 and
miR-146b-5p miRNAs were assessed by qRT-PCR. Figure 11F shows a clear decrease in
the levels of these two miRNAs in all Obadi cells compared to those in Leadi cells. This
indicates an obesity-related reduction in the levels of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p.
DISCUSSION
Numerous findings have indicated that excess body adiposity is an important risk
factor for breast cancer. Three major mechanistic connections have been proposed to
explain this link between obesity and increased cancer risk: sex hormone metabolism,
insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling, and adipose tissue dysfunction
(24). Notably, all these signals are interconnected and converge on inflammatory
pathways (26). At the cellular level, several studies have underscored the important role
of adipocytes and their secreted adipokines in breast carcinogenesis (27). However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying this functional interplay remain largely elusive. In
the present report, we have first shown that BSAd from obese females (BMI of �30) are
active, with higher proliferative as well as migratory/invasive capacities than adipocytes
from lean females (BMI of �30). These effects were explained by the upregulation/
activation of the proinvasive/migratory and proliferative protein kinases AKT and
ERK1/2 (23, 24) in Obadi cells, which remained as mature adipocytes, expressing low
levels of the mesenchymal stem cell markers Nanog and Oct4. This indicates that Obadi
cells acquired higher proliferative and invasive capacities without dedifferentiation,
which was previously shown to enhance the proliferative ability of mature adipocytes
(28, 29). We have next shown that Obadi cells exhibit proinflammatory features. Indeed,
the master inflammation regulator NF-�B was upregulated in all BSAd from obese

 females, which consequently secreted higher levels of several proinflammatory adipo-
kines such as leptin, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1� than BSAd from lean women. This parallels the
fact that obesity is tightly linked to inflammation, which is a hallmark of local fat
deposition (30–32). Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that obesity is associated
with a chronic proinflammatory state, and adipose tissue is being considered a major
immunologically active endocrine organ (33, 34). We have also shown that Obadi cells
can enhance the prometastatic EMT process in primary luminal cells in a leptin-dependent
manner. In addition to leptin, the other inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-�, and

 IL-1� are also known to play major roles in promoting EMT and tumorigenesis, which
strengthens the link between obesity, inflammation, and cancer development (26, 35).
The procarcinogenic effects of Obadi cells were also confirmed in orthotopic tumor
xenografts, where they promoted tumor growth and the EMT process. Furthermore, we
provide clear evidence that mammary epithelia from obese women undergo EMT-
related changes relative to epithelia from lean females. Together, these findings
provide the first direct proof that obesity activates breast adipocytes, which acquire
protumorigenic potential. This connection between body adiposity and in-breast dys-
function could be due to the fact that the amount of fat in the breast is proportional
to the total body fat mass (36), in addition to the well-known obesity-related systemic
effects that may also affect the pathophysiology of the breast (37). In line with these
findings, Strong et al. have recently shown that adipose stem cells isolated from obese
patients can enhance the tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells and alter their gene
expression profiles (38).
Additionally, we have used different molecular and cellular approaches to show that
the tumor suppressor protein p16 plays key roles in suppressing the procarcinogenic
effects of BSAd. First, we have shown for the first time that the p16 level is reduced in
all Obadi cells as well as breast adipose tissues taken from obese women relative to
levels in their respective control Leadi cells and tissues from lean women. Second, p16
knockdown in Leadi cells was sufficient to activate these adipocytes and enhance their
proangiogenic effects as well as their tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Third, we
have shown that p16 negatively regulates the expression/secretion of leptin, which is
responsible for the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of p16-defective adipocytes.
We have also shown that p16 was downregulated in Obadi cells owing to higher
turnover of the corresponding mRNA. This result raised an important question as to
how obesity affects the expression of p16 in breast stromal adipocytes. Since obesity
causes both in-breast and systemic inflammation (37), p16 downregulation in breast
adipocytes could result from local and/or systemic obesity-dependent effects via
inflammation/cancer-related cytokines. Indeed, the circulating levels of IL-6 and leptin,
two major obesity- and cancer-related factors, were shown to be highly correlated with
BMI in rodents and humans (39, 40). Thereby, IL-6 or leptin could be responsible for p16
downregulation in breast adipocytes in obese females. As a case in point, we have
recently shown that paracrine IL-6 can downregulate p16 in breast stromal fibroblasts
in a STAT3-dependent manner (41).
Importantly, specific p16 downregulation transformed Leadi cells to Obadi-like cells,
with proinflammatory and -carcinogenic features. Indeed, like Obadi cells, p16-
defective Leadi (Leadi-sh) cells expressed higher levels of NF-�B and its major
inflammation-related target genes, including Cox-2, leptin, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1�. This
suggests that p16 also has anti-inflammatory functions in breast stromal adipocytes
through repression of several inflammation-related genes, including leptin (42, 43). This
corroborates previous findings which showed that p16 induction into the synovial
tissues suppressed rheumatoid arthritis in animal models. Furthermore, p16 has anti-
inflammatory functions in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts in vitro (44, 45). Moreover, we
have recently shown that p16 represses the expression/secretion of IL-6 in breast
stromal fibroblasts (10).
We have also shown that Leadi-sh cells became more migratory/invasive and
proliferative and also triggered EMT in normal primary breast luminal cells in a
paracrine manner. These procarcinogenic effects were confirmed in vivo in orthotopic
tumor xenografts, wherein Leadi-sh cells promoted tumor growth and EMT compared
to levels in control cells. These results clearly show the functional similarities between
Leadi-sh and Obadi cells and the important role of p16 in their procarcinogenic effects
both in vitro and in vivo. This also shows that p16 possesses a non-cell-autonomous
tumor suppression function in BSAd. Furthermore, we present here the first indication
that the procarcinogenic paracrine effects of p16-defective adipocytes are leptin de-
pendent and that p16 negatively controls the expression/secretion of leptin through
miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. In fact, there is high complementarity between mature

 miR-141/miR-146b-5p and the leptin 3= UTR, which was responsive to both miRNAs. In
line with these findings, we have shown the presence of an inverse correlation between
the expression of p16/miR-141/miR-146b-5p and the level of their target leptin in
various Obadi and Leadi cells. Intriguingly, Obadi cells express almost undetectable
levels of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, indicating that the level of these two tumor
suppressor microRNAs is also affected by obesity in BSAd. miRNA profiling studies have
identified several miRNAs which are differentially expressed in adipogenesis and asso-
ciated with obesity in various adipose depots (46, 47). Furthermore, miR-141 was found
downregulated in visceral adipose tissue of obese females (48), and miR-146b-5p was
downregulated in monocytes during obesity (49). However, no study to date has
analyzed the expression of these two microRNAs in BSAd.
The tumorigenicity of Obadi and Leadi-sh cells was further confirmed by evidence
of their ability to enhance stemness both in vitro and in vivo. These cells promoted
mammary stem cell features (expressing high levels of CD44 and low levels of CD24
[CD44high/CD24low] and ALDHhigh) in primary mammary luminal cells and in breast
cancer cells in orthotopic tumor xenografts.
Together, the present results indicate that breast adipocytes from obese females are
active procarcinogenic cells which express very low levels of the tumor suppressor protein
p16, a negative regulator of leptin through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. Therefore, the
expression level of p16 and/or miR-141/miR-146b-5p in breast adipocytes could be utilized
as a molecular biomarker for obesity and obesity-related procarcinogenic effects in the
breast. This suggests that p16 and its downstream target tumor suppressor miRNAs could
be exploited as predictive markers for breast cancer development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue collection. Breast adipose tissues were collected from reduction mammoplasty according to
the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center
(KFSHRC; approval RAC 2140017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Generation of primary differentiated adipocytes and luminal cells from breast tissues. The
obtained tissues were immediately digested with collagenase to separate preadipocytes from the stroma
vascular fraction. Differentiated adipocytes were obtained as previously described (50). Preadipocytes
were first cultured in special medium (preadipocyte growth medium [PAGM]) containing fetal calf serum
(0.05 ml/ml), endothelial cell growth supplement (0.004 ml/ml), epidermal cell growth factor (10 ng/ml),
hydrocortisone (1 �g/ml), and heparin (90 �g/ml) and used until confluence. Preadipocytes were then
stimulated to differentiate by replacement of the preadipocyte medium with serum-free preadipocyte
differentiation medium (SFPADM), supplemented with D-biotin (8 �g/ml), insulin (0.5 �g/ml), dexameth-
asone (400 ng/ml), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 44 �g/ml), L-thyroxine (9 ng/ml), and ciglitazone
(3 �g/ml). Differentiated adipocytes were then cultured using adipocyte nutrition medium (ANM)
containing fetal calf serum (0.03 ml/ml), D-biotin (8 �g/ml), insulin (0.5 �g/ml), and dexamethasone (400
ng/ml). All supplements were purchased from PromoCell GmbH, Germany, and were utilized according
to their instructions.
Normal breast luminal cells were obtained from the same tissues and were cultured as previously
described (51).
Cell lines, cell culture, and chemicals. MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas,
VA) and cultured according to the instructions of the company. Mesenchymal stem cells (BM-04) were
developed in the laboratory. Human superleptin antagonist (MBS400098) and IgG were purchased from
MyBioSource. Blocking antibodies were used at 2.5 �g/ml. Recombinant human leptin protein
(MBS197016) was purchased from MyBioSource and used at 45 ng/ml.
Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblotting. Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblotting
were performed as previously described (52). Antibodies directed against E-cadherin (HECD-1),
N-cadherin, AKT (C73H10), P-AKT (Thr308), ERK (137F5), P-ERK (E10), EpCam (VU1D9), NF-�B(p65), STAT3,
P-STAT3, and Snail (C15D3) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). GAPDH
(FL-335) was from Santa Cruz (USA). p16 was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Leptin, vimentin
(RV202), Twist-1, IL-8, Fas, Ki-67, IL-1�, and IL-6 were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Zeb-1 (4C4) was from
Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan). p53 (DO-1), ALDH1/2 (H-85), CD24 (C-20), and Cox2 (clone 29) were from Santa
Cruz Biotech (Dallas, TX). CD44 was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and TNF-� (4H31) was from Novus
Biologicals.
RNA purification and quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA containing miRNAs was purified using an
miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and treated
with RNase-free DNase. One microgram of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA utilizing either an
Advantage RT-PCR kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) or miScript II RT kit (Qiagen, United
Kingdom) for mature miRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate using 4 �l of cDNA mixed
with 2� FastStart Essential DNA Green qPCR mastermix (Roche, New York, NY) and 0.3 �M forward and
reverse primers. Amplifications were performed utilizing a LightCycler 96 real-time PCR detection system

 (Roche) using the following cycle conditions: 95°
C for 10 min (1 cycle); 95°
C for 10 s, 59°
C for 20 s, and
72°
C for 30 s (45 cycles). GAPDH expression levels were used for normalization, and gene expression
differences were calculated using the threshold cycle (CT). The obtained values were plotted as means �
standard deviations (SD). Three independent experiments were performed for each reaction. Primer
sequences are given in Table 1.
Transfection/viral infection. pLKO1-CDKN2A-shRNA (specific downregulation of p16) (Addgene),
pLKO.1-miRZip146b-5p (inhibitor of miR-146b-5p), pLKO.1-miRZip141 (inhibitor of miR-141), pCDH-miR-
141 (expressing pre-miR-141), pCDH-miR-146b-5p (expressing pre-miR-146b-5p) (all from System Biosci-
ences), pGFP-C-LEPshLenti plasmid (specific downregulation of leptin), and their control plasmids were
used at 1 �g/ml each for transfection of 293FT cells. Lentiviral supernatants were collected at 48 h
posttransfection. Culture medium was removed from the target cells and replaced with the lentiviral
supernatant and incubated for 24 h in the presence of 1 �g/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Transduced
cells were selected after 48 h with puromycin.
Analysis of mRNA stability. Exponentially growing cells were challenged with actinomycin D (5
�g/ml) for various periods of time (0 to 6 h); then total RNA was purified, and the level of the CDKN2A
mRNA was assessed using qRT-PCR. Nonlinear regression analysis (Prism; GraphPad Software) was used
to assess mRNA decay kinetics, considering the values at time zero as 100%. The time corresponding to
50% remaining mRNA was considered the mRNA half-life.
miRNA target prediction. miRNA targets were predicted using algorithms, including miRanda
human miRNA targets, miRDB, RNA22, and miROrg. To identify the genes commonly predicted by these
different algorithms, the results of predicted targets were intersected using miRWalk.
Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cells were plated at 1 � 105 cells/well on six-well plates and
transfected with 3 �g of the luciferase/Renilla reporter vector containing either human wild-type LEP 3=
UTR (871 bp) sequence, mutated sequence of the miR-141 or miR-146b-5p seed sequence, or a control
sequence with no AU-rich conserved elements (GeneCopoeia). Transfection was carried out using
Lipofectamine 2000, as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). At 24 h posttransfection, cells
were seeded in a 96-well plate, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were consecutively measured
using a dual-luciferase assay as recommended by the manufacturer (GeneCopoeia). The firefly luciferase
signal was normalized to that of the Renilla luciferase signal for each individual analysis. The mean and
standard error (SE) were calculated from three wells for each 3= UTR activity, and results are presented
as fold change over the level of the nonstimulated control.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with
0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and quenched in 100 mM glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Cells
were then blocked in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and incubated with primary antibody, washed, and
incubated with the Alexa Fluor 594- or 488-conjugated antibody (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei
were stained with 4=,6=-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and images were
captured using a FLoid Cell Imaging Station (Life technologies). Antibodies against leptin, perilipin A,
Glut-4, and Ki-67 were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); FABP-4 was from Life Span Biosciences
(Seattle, WA), TNF-� was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and fatty acid synthase (C20G5),
adiponectin, PPAR-� (C26H12), and E-cadherin (HECD-1) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA). The percentage of Ki-67-labeled cells (labeling index [LI]) was determined for at least 500 cells per
data point and is expressed as the mean and standard error of triplicate determinations.
Oil Red O staining. Cells were subjected to cytospins, fixed with 10% formalin for 1 h at room
temperature (RT), and washed with distilled H2O and then with 60% isopropanol for 5 min. Cells were
then stained with 0.3% Oil Red O solution in isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 5 min at RT,
washed, and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich).

 Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were utilized for immu-
nohistochemistry as previously described (54). Tissues were incubated overnight with anti-Ki-67, anti-p16
(EPR1473), or antileptin (Abcam), anti-EpCam (D13B) (Cell Signaling), or antivimentin (Abcam) antibody
at a dilution of 1:500, followed by either peroxidase-conjugated (Dako) or Alexa Fluor-conjugated
antibodies. Sites of antibody binding were visualized by the deposition of the brown polymer of
3,3=-diaminobenzidine chromogen (DAB; Novocastra Laboratories, Ltd., Buffalo Grove, IL).
Cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Cell migration, invasion, and proliferation assays were
performed in label-free real-time settings using xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA) technology
(Roche, Germany) that measures impedance changes in a meshwork of interdigitated gold microelec-
trodes located at the well bottom (E-plate) or at the bottom side of a microporous membrane (CIM plate
16) (55, 56). Cell migration and invasion were assessed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. In brief, 2 � 104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM plate either
uncoated (migration) or coated with a thin layer of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) basement membrane matrix
diluted 1:20 in serum-free medium (invasion). Complete medium was used as a chemoattractant in the
lower chambers. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA plate for 24 h, and the impedance
value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as the cell
index (CI) value, which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change
divided by a background value. Each assay was performed in triplicate.
For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2 � 104) were seeded in an E-plate with
complete medium in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell proliferation was assessed for
48 h. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. The cell index was used to measure the
change in the electrical impedance divided by background value, which represents cell status. Each assay
was biologically performed in triplicate (53).
Conditioned medium. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) for 48 h, and then the
medium was collected and centrifuged. Conditioned medium (CM) was used either immediately or
frozen at �80°
C until needed.
Adipokine array. Serum-free conditioned medium was applied on an adipokine antibody array
membrane (AAH-ADI-1; RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Briefly, the membranes were incubated with 1 ml of SFCM overnight and then washed and
reincubated with biotin-conjugated anticytokines. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin secondary antibodies and visualized using an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Membranes were then imaged by charge-coupled-
device (CCD) camera (ImageQuant LAS 4000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA).
ELISA. ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IL-6 and VEGF-A were
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and leptin, IL-8, and IL-1� were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The
optical density (OD) at 450 nm on a standard ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used. These
experiments were performed in triplicate.
Tumor xenografts. Animal experiments were approved by the KFSHRC institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international
guidelines. SCID mice were randomized into three groups, and breast cancer xenografts were
created by coimplantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2 � 106) with adipocytes (4 � 106) under
the nipple in the mammary fat pad. As controls, 2 � 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were injected separately.
The growth of the tumors was then monitored weekly. Tumor size was measured with a caliper using the
following formula: length � width � height. Six weeks after the injections the animals were scarified, and
tumors were excised and weighed.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software. The results are
presented as means � SD or standard errors of the means (SEM) of at least three independent
experiments. Statistical significance was determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as well
as a two-tailed Student t test, and P values of 0.05 and less were considered statistically significant.
