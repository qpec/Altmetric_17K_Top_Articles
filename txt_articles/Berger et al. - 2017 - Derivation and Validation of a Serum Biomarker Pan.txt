IMPORTANCE Abusive head trauma is the leading cause of death from physical abuse. Missing
the diagnosis of abusive head trauma, particularly in its mild form, is common and contributes
to increased morbidity and mortality. Serum biomarkers may have potential as quantitative
point-of-care screening tools to alert physicians to the possibility of intracranial hemorrhage.
OBJECTIVE To identify and validate a set of biomarkers that could be the basis of a
multivariable model to identify intracranial hemorrhage in well-appearing infants using the
Ziplex System.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Binary logistic regression was used to develop a
multivariable model incorporating 3 serum biomarkers (matrix metallopeptidase-9,
neuron-specific enolase, and vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1) and 1 clinical variable
(total hemoglobin). The model was then prospectively validated. Multiplex biomarker
measurements were performed using Flow-Thru microarray technology on the Ziplex System,
which has potential as a point-of-care system. The model was tested at 3 pediatric emergency
departments in level I pediatric trauma centers (Children’
s Hospital of Pittsburgh of University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Primary Children’
s Hospital, Salt Lake
City, Utah; and Lurie Children’
s Hospital, Chicago, Illinois) among well-appearing infants who
presented for care owing to symptoms that placed them at increased risk of abusive head
trauma. The study took place from November 2006 to April 2014 at Children’
s Hospital of
Pittsburgh, June 2010 to August 2013 at Primary Children’
s Hospital, and January 2011 to
August 2013 at Lurie Children’
s Hospital.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A mathematical model that can predict acute intracranial
hemorrhage in infants at increased risk of abusive head trauma.
RESULTS The multivariable model, Biomarkers for Infant Brain Injury Score, was applied
prospectively to 599 patients. The mean (SD) age was 4.7 (3.1) months. Fifty-two percent
were boys, 78% were white, and 8% were Hispanic. At a cutoff of 0.182, the model was
89.3% sensitive (95% CI, 87.7-90.4) and 48.0% specific (95% CI, 47.3-48.9) for acute
intracranial hemorrhage. Positive and negative predictive values were 21.3% and 95.6%,
respectively. The model was neither sensitive nor specific for atraumatic brain abnormalities,
isolated skull fractures, or chronic intracranial hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The Biomarkers for Infant Brain Injury Score, a multivariable
model using 3 serum biomarker concentrations and serum hemoglobin, can identify infants
with acute intracranial hemorrhage. Accurate and timely identification of intracranial
hemorrhage in infants without a history of trauma in whom trauma may not be part of the
differential diagnosis has the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from abusive
head trauma.

 A
busive head trauma (AHT) is the leading cause of death
from traumatic brain injury in infants1-3 and the lead-
ing cause of death from physical abuse in the United
States.4 Proper diagnosis of mild AHT (Glasgow Coma Scale
score, 13-15) is difficult because caretakers often provide
inaccurate histories,5 infants present with nonspecific symp-
toms such as vomiting, and physical examination is often
normal.6-8 Unfortunately, misdiagnosis is common and can
have catastrophic medical consequences.8-10 In a landmark
study of children diagnosed as having AHT,9 31% (54 of 173)
were previously evaluated by a physician for symptoms that,
in hindsight, were missed opportunities to diagnose AHT.
Fifteen years later, a multicenter study demonstrated a simi-
lar rate of missed diagnoses,11 suggesting that early, accurate
diagnosis of AHT is still challenging.
The frequency with which AHT is misdiagnosed and the
resulting morbidity and mortality indicate the need for a
screeningtesttohelpphysiciansidentifyinfantsinwhomneu-
roimaging should be considered. The screening test would not
be used to diagnose AHT per se. If neuroimaging demon-
strated acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), additional evalu-
ation for AHT would be indicated.12
During the past decade, we have reported on the possible
use of serum biomarkers as screening tools for ICH in infants
at risk of missed AHT.13-18 A single study evaluating the use of
multiple biomarkers simultaneously suggests that combin-
ing biomarkers improves sensitivity for ICH detection.16 To our
knowledge, no studies have evaluated multiple biomarkers on
a clinically relevant device, an important step in bringing brain
biomarkers to clinical practice.19,20
The Ziplex System (Axela, Inc) is a fully automated mul-
tiplex platform based on proprietary Flow-Thru microarrays.
The Ziplex System can measure multiple biomarkers simulta-
neously and rapidly using 2 μL of serum. The objective of this
studywastoidentifyandvalidateasetofbiomarkersthatcould
be the basis of a multivariable model to identify ICH in
infants using the Ziplex System.
Methods
Participants
There were 3 study groups: the retrospective derivation, the
prospective validation, and the supplemental cohort of in-
fants with rare intracranial abnormalities.
Retrospective Derivation
To derive the biomarker-based formula to discriminate
infants with and without ICH, serum was used from patients
from an institutional review board–approved serum data-
bank at the Safar Center for Resuscitation Research at the
University of Pittsburgh. Sera samples from patients in the
databank were included in the derivation if patients were
aged 30 to 364 days, well-appearing, afebrile (temperature
< 38.3°C), and presented to Children’
s Hospital of Pittsburgh
of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with nonspe-
cific symptoms including vomiting or fussiness, which can
be associated with an increased risk of AHT.8,9 Patients in
the retrospective cohort were enrolled from November 9,
2000, to June 13, 2013.
Prospective Validation
A multicenter prospective validation of the model developed
with the derivation cohort was then performed. The study,
which will be referred to as the parent study, was approved by
the institutional review boards at Children’
s Hospital of Pitts-
burgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania, Primary Children’
s Hospital, Salt Lake
City, Utah, and Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’
s Hospital,
Chicago, Illinois. Enrollment at Children’
s Hospital of started
on October 1, 2006, at Primary Children’
s Hospital on June 1,
2010, and at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’
s Hospital on
January 1, 2011. Written consent was obtained except in cases
of suspected abuse, when a waiver of informed consent was
approved.
Inclusion criteria are in Table 1. Enrollment was not con-
secutive and based on investigator availability. Detailed infor-
mationaboutpatientclassificationanddatacollectionhasbeen
published previously.25
Supplemental Cohort of Infants
With Rare Intracranial Abnormalities
While the overarching goal of the biomarker panel is to iden-
tify infants with acute ICH owing to AHT, infants with atrau-
matic intracranial abnormalities, ICH not owing to AHT,
chronic ICH, or isolated skull fractures can present with
similar symptoms as infants with AHT. Therefore, it is criti-
cal to assess any biomarker panel in infants with these
abnormalities. Because these abnormalities are rarer than
AHT-related ICH,26,27 we expected an inadequate number of
these patients in the prospective validation. As a result,
serum from infants with these abnormalities was selected
from the databank described in the previous section and
included with prospective validation samples.
Blood was collected as soon as possible after presenta-
tion in the emergency department, processed by the hospital
laboratory, and deidentified. Serum was stored at −70°C and
shipped to Axela Inc for biomarker analysis. Total hemoglo-
bin concentration was measured at the time of enrollment in
the hospital laboratory.
Key Points
Question Is it possible to develop a panel of serum biomarkers that
can be used to identify infants who are at increased risk of having an
acute intracranial hemorrhage and/or abusive head trauma?
Findings This study used a retrospective cohort of 99 patients
followed by a prospective cohort of 599 patients to derive and
validate the Biomarkers of Infant Brain Injury Score. The
Biomarkers of Infant Brain Injury Score predicted intracranial
hemorrhage with a higher sensitivity than clinical judgement,
the current criterion standard.
Meaning The Biomarkers of Infant Brain Injury Score may be
useful in clinical practice to identify infants who should undergo
neuroimaging to identify abusive head trauma.

 Classification of Patients
As part of the parent study, patients were classified as cases
or controls based on neuroimaging used in a previously pub-
lishedparadigm.25Amongcases,brainabnormalitieswereclas-
sified based on etiology (abuse vs not abuse) and type of ab-
normality (acute ICH not underlying skull fracture, acute ICH
underlying skull fracture, chronic ICH, atraumatic abnormal-
ity, or isolated skull fracture) (Figure 1).
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging
scans were interpreted for clinical care and by a study neuro-
radiologist. If infants had any acute ICH, they were classified
in the acute ICH group. Chronic subdural hemorrhage was con-
firmed with brain magnetic resonance imaging, which is stan-
dard of care at all 3 sites.
Abusive head trauma was defined as acute ICH and the as-
sessment of probable or definite abuse by each site’
s hospital-
based Child Protection Team. Using a Child Protection Team
assessment is a common way to define AHT in clinical
research.1,9,15 The Child Protection Team did not have access
to biomarker data.
Predictors Included in the Model
Based on data from prior publications,14-16,28-34 brain-
specific (neuron-specific enolase [NSE]) and nonbrain-
specific (matrix metallopeptidase-9 [MMP-9] and vascular cel-
lular adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]) markers were included
in the model. Three clinical variables (total hemoglobin, age,
and sex) were evaluated for inclusion in the model owing to
data suggesting an association with ICH and AHT.1,25,35
Reagents
Capture and biotinylated reporter antibodies for MMP-9 and
VCAM-1 and recombinant protein were obtained from R&D
Systems. Antibodies for NSE and recombinant NSE were

Sulfo-NHS-Biotin for biotinylation of NSE reporter antibod-
ies and streptavidin Poly-HRP were obtained from Thermo-
Fisher Scientific. All other materials and reagents were
obtained from Axela Inc.
Microarray Printing of TipChip Arrays
Capture antibodies were spotted in quadruplicate onto
epoxy-activated chips using a pin microarray printer.
Multiplex Immunoassays on the Ziplex System
Multiplex immunoassays were performed on the Ziplex
System using 2-μL serum and biotinylated secondary antibod-
ies. Following incubation with streptavidin-HRP, biomarkers
were detected by chemiluminescence. Biomarker concentra-
tions were taken as the mean of replicate sample analyses.
Eight-pointcalibrationcurvesweregeneratedforeachbio-
marker spanning the clinically relevant concentrations. Five-
parameter logistic regression was used for fitting MMP-9 and
VCAM-1 calibration curves; linear regression was used for NSE.
The serum concentration of each biomarker was interpolated
from its respective calibration curve.
Owing to the presence of endogenous NSE in red blood
cells, NSE concentrations in serum can be artificially el-
evated by hemolysis. Therefore, NSE concentrations were ad-
justed to account for hemolysis using a previously described
method.36 Samples with a hemocue of at least 0.5 g/dL were
excluded (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). The
technician performing all assays was blinded to clinical data.
Statistical Analysis
A logistic regression model was fit to the derivation data to
identify a prediction model for acute intracranial hemor-
rhage as a function of biomarkers and covariates. The data for
the 4 continuous-value markers were centered on the me-
dian values of the control samples in the derivation set that
serve as the baseline for all other samples. A cutoff was cho-
sen so that the sensitivity for the samples in the derivation set
was 95%. The model including this cutoff was used for re-
sampling cross validation of the derivation set and for evalu-
ationofthevalidationset.Binarylogisticregressionwasevalu-
ated with a cross-validation procedure in which the samples
in the derivation or validation were divided randomly (re-
sampling without replacement) within 20 folds of approxi-
mately equal numbers of resampled derivation and test sets
with stratification according to whether samples were cases
or controls. The mean and standard deviation area under the
curve for the receiver operating characteristic curves and the
specificity and sensitivity and negative and positive predic-
tive for the validation sets from the 20 folds were calculated.
Multiple combination of markers were evaluated (Table 2).
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was also evaluated
using the R SVM function with linear kernel and cost = 0.08
(R Programming). A P value of less than .05 was considered
significant. All P values were 2-sided.
Descriptive statistics were performed using IBM SPSS,
version 23.0 (IBM Corp). Statistical modeling was performed
with R, version 3.3.2 of the R statistical programming
language37 with the packages ROCR,38 e7071,39 and openxlsx
(R Programming).40 R was used with the RStudio Integrated
Development Environment.41
Results
Retrospective Derivation
Ninety-nine patients, 48 with ICH and 51 without ICH, were
in the derivation cohort. All 48 patients with ICH had AHT. Se-
rum hemoglobin, MMP-9, adjusted NSE, and VCAM-1, but not
age or sex, were significantly associated with ICH in the deri-
vation cohort. The model containing serum hemoglobin plus
MMP-9, adjusted NSE, and VCAM-1 provided the greatest pre-
dictive value (Table 2).

 bution of each of the markers to the calculation of the log odds
of a patient being a case. Matrix metallopeptidase-9, NSE, and
VCAM-1 are measured in nanograms per milliliter, and total se-
rum hemoglobin is measured in grams per deciliter. This for-
mula will be referred to as Biomarker of Infant Brain Injury
Score (BIBIS).
Prospective Validation Including Infants
With Rare Intracranial Abnormalities
There were 1040 patients enrolled in the parent study; 54%
(561 of 1040) had BIBIS calculated. Of the 479 patients in the
parent study who could not have BIBIS calculated, the most
common reason was that serum was not available for bio-
marker analysis. Many patients in the parent study had no
blood collected for clinical care, and parents did not consent
for a blood draw specifically for research. Eighteen patients
were excluded owing to a hemocue greater than 0.5 g/dL.36
There was no difference in the mean (SD) age (4.7 [3.0] vs 4.7
[3.1] months, P = .51), proportion of boys (52% vs 53%, P = .80),
or the likelihood of being a case patient (22.0% vs. 19.4%,
P = .40) in patients who did and did not have blood available
for analysis. A total of 599 patients (561 from the parent study
and 38 with other intracranial abnormalities) had BIBIS
calculated (Figure 1).
The binary logistic regression model was initially evalu-
ated with a validation set that included the 440 control in-
fants and the 36 patients with AHT using the cutoff devel-
oped in the derivation set. This was done to provide a direct
comparison between the derivation and validation sets. The
sensitivity and specificity of the cutoff calculated in the deri-
vation set and applied in this cohort was 86.4% (95% CI, 84.1-
88.7) and 48.9% (95% CI, 47.9-49.8), respectively.
The binary logistic regression model was then evaluated
with a validation set that included the 440 control infants and
the 71 patients with acute ICH of any etiology. The sensitivity
and specificity of the cutoff in this cohort was 89.34% (95%
CI, 87.7-90.4) and 48.0% (95% CI, 47.3-48.9), respectively. The
positive and negative predictive values were 21.3% and 95.6%,
respectively. There was substantial overlap with the model
characteristics in patients with AHT compared with those with
acute ICH of any etiology, consistent with the modeling pre-
dicting acute ICH rather than AHT.
Themodelwasunabletoidentifyabnormalitiesotherthan
acute ICH. The sensitivity and specificity in the cohort of pa-
tients with atraumatic abnormalities (n = 17), chronic ICH
(n = 8), and isolated skull fracture (n = 34) were 52% and 49%,
respectively.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a combination
of serum biomarkers and a clinical variable to derive and vali-
date a screening tool that predicts acute ICH in infants at in-
creased risk of AHT. The ability to identify infants who would
benefit from neuroimaging has the potential to improve early
recognition of AHT and thereby decrease morbidity and mor-
tality. The consistency of the retrospective single-site deriva-
tion and the prospective multisite validation as well as the con-
sistency of the binary logistic regression and SVM models
supports the robustness of this approach. The fact that the sen-
sitivity and specificity for acute ICH owing to AHT and acute
ICH from other etiologies is the same is consistent with the fact
that BIBIS does not identify AHT but rather acute ICH. Maxi-
mizingsensitivityratherthanaccuracywasdonebecausemiss-
ing AHT has more serious implications than performing neu-
roimaging in patients without ICH. This is particularly true if
rapid magnetic resonance imaging rather than head com-
puted tomography is the diagnostic test performed in
patients with an abnormal BIBIS.42,43
The decision not to recalculate the intercept of the BIBIS
model in the validation cohort to account for differences in
baseline characteristics of the validation and derivation co-
horts was intentional. While there was clearly a difference be-
tween the 2 cohorts given the lower sensitivity of the model
in the validation cohort, and this difference could have been
adjusted for by changing the intercept, we chose not to do this
because of the implication for clinical practice. To use BIBIS
for prediction in real time for a single patient, BIBIS must be
calculated in a single patient using a predefined formula with
a known regression slope and intercept. The intercept cannot
be recalculated in each patient.
Whendevelopinganewscreeningtool,comparisonwiththe
preexisting gold standard is important. Because clinical judge-
mentisthecriterionstandardfordeterminingwhichinfantswith
nonspecific symptoms should undergo neuroimaging, it is the
most relevant comparison. Two studies9,11,25 suggest that clini-
cal judgment has a sensitivity of approximately 70%; our data
demonstrate that BIBIS is more sensitive.
As with all screening tests, BIBIS is meant to supplement
rather than replace clinical judgment in well-appearing
infants in whom brain injury may not be in the initial differ-

 ential diagnosis. It should not be used in infants who need
emergent neuroimaging and/or to justify not obtaining neuro-
imaging when there are other clinical indicators. It is also not
designed to diagnose AHT; the equivalent sensitivity of BIBIS
for prediction of acute ICH owing to AHT and acute ICH from
other etiologies is consistent with this.
ThelackofpredictivevalueofBIBISforchildrenwithatrau-
maticinjuries,chronicICH,andskullfracturesisnotsurprising.
The biomarkers in BIBIS would not be expected to be increased
inchronicICHbecauseoftheirshortbiologichalf-lives.Studies
suggest that some serum biomarkers may increase weeks to
months after ICH44,45; evaluation of these markers in addition
to BIBIS could be an intriguing area of future research. The lack
of sensitivity for atraumatic injury and isolated skull fractures
is consistent with the lack of ICH in these cases.
The selection of biomarkers occurred prior to the deriva-
tion and was based on the literature and our own experience.
Despiteitsrecognizedlimitations,NSEhasbeenaprimarybrain-
specific biomarker evaluated for more than a decade.14,15,28
Matrix metallopeptidase-9 and VCAM-1 were identified as po-
tentialmarkersinastudyinwhich45potentialbiomarkerswere
evaluatedusingmultiplexbeadtechnology.16Adultstudiesalso
demonstrate increased serum MMP-9 after traumatic brain
injury29-31 and implicate it as a marker of hemorrhagic trans-
formation and injury to the blood-brain barrier after stroke.32
While MMP-9 and NSE are increased after acute ICH, VCAM-1
is decreased. This is in contrast to cerebrospinal fluid concen-
trations of VCAM-1, which are increased after pediatric trau-
matic brain injury.33 The physiologic basis for the decreased
serumVCAM-1isunknown,buta2015publicationsuggeststhat
endogenous growth factors down-regulate VCAM-1 in brain
microcirculation.34
The ability to measure these biomarkers simultaneously
on the Ziplex device is an important step toward clinical use-
fulness and suggests that a point-of-care test may be feasible
using this type of device. Additional testing and evaluation is
required.
Limitations
Of the 1040 patients in the parent study, only a subset had
BIBIS calculated. As discussed in the Results section, this
was primarily related to the lack of available serum. It was
not surprising that parents were often unwilling to have
blood drawn in their infant for research purposes. We do not
believe this would be a limitation if BIBIS were part of rou-
tine clinical care because there would then be no need for
written research consent.
Whilepatientswerenotenrolleddaily,enrollmentwascon-
secutive when an investigator was available at each site. There
is no reason to believe that infants presenting with nonspe-
cific symptoms at 2 AM are different than infants presenting
at 4 PM.
Finally, only infants were included because this is the age
group at highest risk for AHT. Approximately 25% of children
with AHT are older than 1 year of age.46 Prior to bringing
BIBIS to clinical use, it will be important to assess whether it
could be used in high-risk toddlers.
Conclusions
We have derived and prospectively validated a brain injury
score, BIBIS, that uses 3 serum biomarkers plus serum hemo-
globin to predict which infants are most likely to have acute
ICH and would benefit from neuroimaging. Future studies will
focus on combining BIBIS with the Pittsburgh Infant Brain
Injury Score (PIBIS)25 to determine whether a combined score
is more accurate than either score alone. Future research must
also focus on bringing brain biomarker measurement from the
bench to the bedside as it relates to commercialization of the
Ziplex device. Finally, while our focus is development of an
accurate screening tool, for BIBIS to be successful in clinical
practice, physicians will need to know when to use it. Devel-
oping and evaluating strategies to help physicians do this is
an important future step.
