Abstract
Maternal immune activation (MIA) contributes to behavioral abnormalities associated with 
neurodevelopmental disorders in both primate and rodent offspring1-4. In humans, epidemiological 
studies suggest that exposure of fetuses to maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of 
developing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)5-7. We recently demonstrated that interleukin-17a 
(IL-17a) produced by Th17 cells, CD4+ T helper effector cells involved in multiple inflammatory 
conditions, is required in pregnant mice to induce behavioral as well as cortical abnormalities in 
the offspring exposed to MIA8. However, it is unclear if other maternal factors are required to

 promote MIA-associated phenotypes. Moreover, underlying mechanisms by which MIA leads to T 
cell activation with increased IL-17a in the maternal circulation are not well understood. Here, we 
show that MIA phenotypes in offspring require maternal intestinal bacteria that promote Th17 cell 
differentiation. Pregnant mice that had been colonized with the mouse commensal segmented 
filamentous bacteria (SFB) or human commensal bacteria that induce intestinal Th17 cells were 
more likely to produce offspring with MIA-associated abnormalities. We also show that small 
intestine dendritic cells (DCs) from pregnant, but not from non-pregnant, females upon exposure 
to MIA secrete IL-1β/IL-23/IL-6 and stimulate T cells to produce IL-17a. Overall, our data 
suggest that defined gut commensal bacteria with a propensity to induce Th17 cells may increase 
the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of pregnant mothers undergoing immune 
system activation due to infections or autoinflammatory syndromes.
In mouse models of MIA, offspring born to pregnant dams exposed to viral infection or 
injected with a synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, poly(I:C)), 
which mimics viral infection, exhibit abnormal behavioral phenotypes, including reduced 
sociability, increased repetitive behaviors, and abnormal communication3,4. Because 
commensal microbiota influences immune responses to pathogenic microbes, we wished to 
determine if it affects the mother’s likelihood of producing offspring with MIA-associated 
phenotypes.
As previously reported8-10, pups from mothers injected with poly(I:C) at embryonic day 
12.5 (E12.5) emit more ultrasonic vocalization (USV) calls than those from PBS-injected 
mothers (Fig. 1a). Unlike other behavioral phenotypes that are often more strongly 
manifested in male than in female offspring, USV calls were enhanced in both sexes among 
MIA offspring (Extended Data Fig. 1a). In addition, fetal exposure to MIA led to other 
behavioral abnormalities including enhanced repetitive behaviors (increased marble 
burying), increased anxiety (decreased time spent in the center of an open field arena) and 
social interaction deficits (decreased interaction with a social stimulus) in adult male 
offspring (Fig. 1b-d). These behavioral phenotypes did not emerge from changes in activity 
or arousal levels as the total investigation time and the total distance traveled during the 
sociability test remained comparable (Extended Data Fig. 1b and c). To investigate whether 
maternal commensal bacteria influence MIA-associated behaviors, we treated C57BL/6 
wildtype (WT) mice from our vivarium with the broad spectrum antibiotic vancomycin prior 
to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or poly(I:C) administration (Extended Data Fig. 1d). 
Interestingly, pre-treating poly(I:C)-injected mothers with vancomycin prevented 
development of all four behavioral abnormalities in MIA offspring (Fig. 1a-d).
We previously showed that MIA offspring exhibit cortical patches devoid of cortical layer-
specific markers, such as SATB28, and these cortical patches resemble lesions described in 
brains of ASD patients11,12. These cortical patches are predominantly localized in the area 
encompassing the dysgranular zone of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1DZ) and are 
closely associated with the MIA-associated behavioral abnormalities (Yim et al., co-
submitted manuscript). Unlike the adult offspring derived from poly(I:C)-injected dams, the 
offspring of poly(I:C)-injected mothers pre-treated with vancomycin failed to develop 
cortical patches (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e, f). Vancomycin treatment of poly(I:C)-

 injected pregnant dams led to a decrease in the proportion of Th17 cells in the small 
intestine with a concomitant reduction in the levels of IL-17a in the maternal plasma, 
compared to those of the control group (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). These data 
indicate that the presence in pregnant mice of commensal bacteria sensitive to vancomycin is 
crucial for the induction of MIA-associated behavioral and brain abnormalities in the 
offspring. Furthermore, the presence of such bacteria is associated with increased proportion 
of Th17 cells in the small intestines and high levels of IL-17a in the plasma of poly(I:C)-
treated pregnant dams.
Among commensal bacteria in laboratory mice, SFB is susceptible to vancomycin13 and 
contributes disproportionately to Th17 cell biogenesis in the small intestine14. Indeed, qPCR 
analyses of mouse fecal samples showed that intestinal colonization by SFB is severely 
reduced upon vancomycin treatment (Extended Data Fig. 1h). We also performed scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize SFB, which is associated with intestinal epithelial 
cells (IEC)14. Whereas plenty of SFB were found attached to the ileal mucosa of the PBS-
treated dams, IEC-associated SFB were not detected in the vancomycin-treated dams 
(Extended Data Fig. 1i). We therefore next investigated if the presence of SFB in pregnant 
mice correlated with the MIA-associated behavioral phenotypes in offspring. C57BL/6 mice 
from Taconic Biosciences (Tac) have abundant Th17 cells in their small intestine due to the 
presence of SFB; in contrast, C57BL/6 mice from Jackson Laboratories (Jax), which lack 
SFB, have few intestinal Th17 cells13,14. Unlike offspring from poly(I:C)-injected Tac 
mothers, those from poly(I:C)-injected Jax mothers failed to show any of the MIA-
associated behavioral phenotypes (Fig. 2a-d and Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). Poly(I:C)-treated 
Tac versus Jax mothers had litters of similar size and the pups had similar weights (Extended 
Data Fig. 2c, d). Sizes of the cortical patches observed in the offspring of poly(I:C)-injected 
Tac mothers were highly correlated with the severity of the MIA-associated behavioral 
abnormalities (Yim et al., co-submitted manuscript). Consistent with this finding, MIA 
offspring from the SFB-deficient Jax mothers injected with poly(I:C) had no cortical 
abnormalities, as assessed by SATB2 staining (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2e, f). Unlike 
in Tac mice, Jax mothers injected with poly(I:C) did not show systemic increases in IL-17a 
in the plasma (Fig. 2f). However, poly(I:C) injection of both Tac and Jax animals resulted in 
the robust induction of TNF-α and IFN-β, compared to PBS control mice (Extended Data 
Fig. 2g).
Offspring of poly(I:C)-injected Jax mothers that had been either co-housed with Tac mice or 
gavaged with a fecal slurry from SFB mono-colonized mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a) 
displayed MIA-associated behavioral and cortical abnormalities (Fig. 2a-e). These MIA-
associated phenotypes in the offspring from both the co-housed as well as SFB-gavaged Jax 
mothers were accompanied by increased proportion of gut-residing Th17 cells, consistent 
with the presence of SFB in the small intestine of these mice (Extended Data Fig. 3b-d). 
Accordingly, the co-housed and SFB-gavaged Jax mothers exhibited increased levels of 
plasma IL-17a following poly(I:C) injections (Fig. 2f). Thus, the presence or absence of a 
single commensal bacterial species SFB in the intestines of pregnant mothers influences 
long-lasting behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring exposed to MIA.

 We next investigated if maternal exposure to poly(I:C)-induced inflammation or maternal 
colonization with SFB influence MIA-associated behaviors in offspring after birth. We 
performed cross-fostering experiments by switching newborns between PBS- and poly(I:C)-
treated Tac mothers or between SFB-positive Tac and SFB-negative Jax mothers (Extended 
Data Fig. 4a and 5a). Whereas offspring derived from poly(I:C)-injected mothers, but reared 
by PBS-injected mothers, exhibited behavioral abnormalities, those from PBS-injected 
mothers that were reared by poly(I:C) mothers exhibited normal behaviors (Extended Data 
Fig. 4b-g). Likewise, offspring derived from poly(I:C)-injected Tac mothers, but reared by 
Jax mice, exhibited behavioral abnormalities, whereas those derived from poly(I:C)-injected 
Jax mothers and reared by Tac mothers displayed normal behaviors (Extended Data Fig. 5b-
g). These data indicate that the presence of SFB in the small intestine of mothers as well as 
the immunological effects of poly(I:C) are critical during pregnancy, not during post-natal 
nursing, for licensing MIA-induced behavioral abnormalities in offspring.
MIA leads to an increase in plasma IL-17a levels in pregnant mice as early as 12-24 h 
following E12.5 poly(I:C) injection8. Such a rapid increase strongly suggested that pre-
existing Th17 cells, rather than de novo differentiating Th17 cells, are the major source for 
IL-17a in pregnant mice exposed to inflammation. As Th17 cells are most abundant in the 
small intestine lamina propria, we next investigated whether poly(I:C) stimulates IL-17a 
production via gut-residing Th17 cells. In poly(I:C)-treated pregnant mice, T cells isolated 
from lamina propria, but not spleen or mesenteric lymph node, expressed high levels of 
IL-17a and had increased RORγt expression as compared to cells from PBS-treated mice 
(Extended Fig. 6a-f). Consistent with these observations, ileum-associated mononuclear 
cells, isolated from poly(I:C)-injected Tac pregnant mice and further stimulated in vitro with 
poly(I:C), produced higher levels of IL-17a compared to those from PBS-treated Tac mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 6g and Fig. 3a). In contrast, mononuclear cells from poly(I:C)-treated 
Jax mice secreted only small amounts of IL-17a (Fig. 3a). Introduction of SFB into Jax mice 
either by co-housing them with Tac mice or by gavaging them with an SFB-containing fecal 
slurry was sufficient to enable ileum-associated mononuclear cells to produce high levels of 
IL-17a (Fig. 3a). To examine which cells are involved in the poly(I:C) response, we 
separately isolated CD4+ as well as non-CD4+ cells from PBS- and poly(I:C)-treated 
pregnant Tac mice and co-cultured the isolated cells from each experimental group. The 
non-CD4+ fraction derived from the poly(I:C)-, but not from the PBS-treated mothers, 
promoted IL-17a production when added to cultures containing CD4+ cells from either PBS- 
or poly(I:C)- treated pregnant mice (Extended Data Fig. 6h). We next tested if poly(I:C)-
primed CD11c+ DC cells were capable of supporting CD4+ T cells to produce IL-17a. 
Adding CD11c+ cells derived from poly(I:C)-, but not from PBS-treated, pregnant mice to 
ex vivo cultures containing ileal CD4+ T cells that were isolated from either PBS- or 
poly(I:C)-treated pregnant Tac mice led to robust expression of IL-17a (Fig. 3b). In contrast, 
neither splenic CD4+ T cells of poly(I:C)-injected pregnant Tac mice nor ileal CD4+ T cells 
of poly(I:C)-injected pregnant Jax mice produced IL-17a even with the help of CD11c+ cells 
(Fig. 3b). Thus, both CD4+ T cells present in the small intestines of Tac mice and poly(I:C)-
activated CD11c+ cells are required for robust IL-17a induction. Among the multiple 
phenotypes of gut-residing DCs, CD103+CD11b+CD11c+ cells were robust inducers of

 IL-17a when co-cultured with ileal CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 6i), consistent with 
previous reports15,16.
Because poly(I:C) activates Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)17, we investigated if this receptor is 
involved in stimulation of IL-17a production. Whereas CD4+ T cells, regardless of their tlr3 
genotype, produced IL-17a when mixed with WT CD11c+ cells, they failed to do so when 
co-cultured with TLR3-deficient CD11c+ DCs (Fig. 3c). In addition, poly(I:C) injection to 
TLR3 KO pregnant mice failed to induce MIA-associated USV phenotypes in offspring 
(Extended Data Fig. 6j). These data suggest that MIA-associated phenotypes require 
functional TLR3 expression on gut CD11c+ DC.
Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β/IL-6/IL-23 enhance Th17 cell function and 
differentiation18. Consistent with this notion, co-cultures of sorted CD4+ and CD11c+ DCs 
that were isolated from the ilea of poly(I:C)-treated gravid Tac mice and incubated with 
IL-1β/IL-6/IL-23 blocking antibodies failed to produce IL-17a, even when supplemented 
with poly(I:C) (Fig. 3d). In contrast, GFP+ Th17 cells, but not GFP− non-Th17 cells, sorted 
from the ilea of IL-17a-GFP reporter mice, produced high levels of IL-17a in the presence of 
exogenous IL-1β/IL-6/IL-23, even in the absence of poly(I:C)-treated CD11c+ cells (Fig. 
3e). Collectively, these data indicate that poly(I:C) treatment leads to the activation of gut-
residing CD103+CD11b+CD11c+ cells, which stimulate poised Th17 cells to produce IL-17a 
through secretion of IL-1β/IL-6/IL-23.
Intriguingly, we noted that poly(I:C) injection of non-pregnant females failed to increase the 
levels of plasma IL-17a (Fig. 3f). Co-culture of ileal CD4+ and CD11c+ cells isolated from 
poly(I:C)-treated pregnant females, but not from poly(I:C)-treated non-pregnant females, 
resulted in secretion of IL-17a ex vivo (Fig 3g). Consistent with these findings, gut CD11c+ 
DCs isolated from poly(I:C)-treated pregnant females, but not from poly(I:C)-treated non-
pregnant females, produced increased levels of IL-1β/IL-6/IL-23 (Extended Data Fig. 6k). In 
sum, these data collectively suggest that Th17 cell-inducing gut bacteria, a pro-inflammatory 
stimulus and pregnancy are all required for the systemic increase of IL-17a in maternal 
plasma, which promotes MIA-associated behavioral and neurodevelopmental abnormalities 
in offspring.
We next investigated whether commensal-antigen specific Th17 cells in pregnant mothers 
are sufficient to induce MIA-associated phenotypes in the offspring. Congenically marked 
naïve CD45.1+CD4+ T cells from mice expressing a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) 
specific for a SFB-encoded antigen (7B8 Tg)19 were adoptively transferred into SFB-
colonized CD45.2+ recipient mice lacking αβ T cells (TCRα KO) or deficient for IL-17a 
production (IL-17a KO) (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In line with our previous findings that 
Th17 cells are critical mediators of MIA8, offspring derived from poly(I:C)-injected TCRα 
KO mothers crossed with B6 WT fathers failed to exhibit MIA-induced behavioral 
phenotypes. On the other hand, offspring from TCRα KO pregnant mothers that had 
received naïve 7B8 CD4+ T cells exhibited MIA-associated behavioral phenotypes even in 
the absence of exposure to poly(I:C)-induced inflammation (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We 
subsequently tested if IL-17a produced by the SFB antigen-specific CD4+ T cells was 
sufficient to induce MIA phenotypes in offspring by transferring these cells into IL-17a KO

 females20. Unlike the offspring from the poly(I:C)-treated IL-17a KO mothers that had been 
crossed with B6 WT fathers, offspring of poly(I:C)-injected IL-17a KO mothers that had 
received 7B8 CD4+ T cells displayed all four MIA-associated behavioral abnormalities 
(Extended Data Fig. 7c). In addition, offspring from 7B8 CD4+ T cell recipient females 
exhibited the cortical phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 7d-h). Induction of the MIA behavioral 
phenotypes was accompanied by an increase in IL-17a in the maternal plasma (Extended 
Data Fig. 7i, j) and increased IL-17a production from SFB-specific donor CD45.1+ T cells, 
but not from CD45.2+ T cells of IL-17a KO recipient mice (Extended Data Fig. 7k). 
Therefore, these results indicate that microbiota-specific gut Th17 cells present in pregnant 
mice are sufficient to produce abnormal behavioral and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in 
the offspring when accompanied by strong signaling for IL-17a production in the mother.
Lastly, we investigated if gut-residing bacteria isolated from humans could also promote 
MIA-associated phenotypes in mice. Administration of a mix of twenty different commensal 
bacteria isolated from human fecal samples was previously shown to induce Th17 cells in 
the large intestines of mice21. We orally gavaged Jax mothers with a mix of these twenty 
human bacterial strains twice, on E3.5 and E10.5, followed by a poly(I:C) injection at E12.5 
(Extended Data Fig. 8a). Introduction of the twenty strains led to stable colonization of 2-10 
commensal bacteria (Supplementaty Table 1) and, as previously shown21, to an increased 
percentage of Th17 cells in the colons of the recipient mice (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Unlike 
in the SFB-colonized Jax mice, we could not detect SFB in the ilea of the recipient mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 8c). Importantly, poly(I:C) injection of the human bacteria-gavaged Jax 
mice induced high levels of IL-17a in the maternal plasma and MIA-associated abnormal 
behavioral and nerurodevelopmental phenotypes in the offspring (Fig. 4 and Extended Data 
Fig. 8d-g). These MIA-associated phenotypes were not observed if the mothers were pre-
treated with IL-17a blocking antibody (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 8d-g).
There have been several recent reports of individual human commensal bacteria that 
promote differentiation of intestinal Th17 cells22,23. Unlike offspring from Jax mothers 
colonized with L. monocytogenes or B. fragilis, in which there is no induction of Th17 cells, 
offspring of mice colonized with Th17 cell-inducing B. adolescentis or an adherent E. coli 
isolate, CD-SpA 2A, emitted enhanced USV calls (Extended Data Fig. 9a-c). The presence 
of MIA-associated behavioral phenotype in offspring correlated with increased IL-17a in the 
plasma of poly(I:C)-injected mothers (Extended Data Fig. 9d). On the other hand, pregnant 
mice gavaged with L. monocytogenes had increased IFN-γ production (Extended Data Fig. 
9e). None of these human bacteria gavaged mothers were colonized with SFB (Extended 
Data Fig. 9f). Thus, intestinal Th17 cell induction by individual human commensal bacteria 
contributes to the development of MIA-associated abnormality in mouse offspring.
Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut commensal microbiota have roles in 
autoimmune diseases and cancer24-26. Moreover, intricate relationships exists between the 
bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system27-29. Our 
findings extend the potential role of the microbiota in influencing the mother’s risk of 
having offspring with neurodevelopmental disorders. Women with gut microbial 
communities that promote excessive Th17 cell differentiation may therefore be more likely 
to bear autistic children in the event of pathological inflammation during pregnancy. A better

 understanding of the role of the maternal microbiota and pregnancy-associated changes in 
gut-residing immune cells may provide opportunities to reduce the risk of inflammation-
induced neurodevelopmental disorders.
Methods
Animals
All experiments were performed according to Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and were approved by the National Institutes of Health and the Committee and 
Animal Care at University of Massachusetts Medical School. C57BL/6, tcra KO, tlr3 KO, 
il17agfp and SFB-specific TCR Tg (7B8) mice were purchased from Taconic biosciences and 
Jackson Laboratory. To induce MIA phenotypes, SFB were introduced into mice purchased 
from Jackson laboratory. Il17aKO mice were described elsewhere20.
Maternal Immune Activation
Mice were mated overnight and females were checked daily for the presence of seminal 
plugs, noted as embryonic day 0.5. On E12.5, pregnant female mice were weighed and 
injected with a single dose (20mg/kg; i.p.) of poly(I:C) (Sigma Aldrich) or PBS vehicle. 
Each dam was returned to its cage and left undisturbed until the birth of its litter. All pups 
remained with the mother until weaning on postnatal day 21-28 (P21-P28), at which time 
mice were group housed at a maximum of 5 per cage with same-sex littermates.
Co-housing, SFB-gavaged and antibiotics-gavaged mice
For co-housing experiments, age-matched SFB-absent mice (from Jackson Laboratory) were 
co-housed with SFB-present mice (from Taconic Biosciences) in sterilized cages for two 
weeks at a ratio of 2:3, with unrestricted access to food and water. For SFB-gavaging 
experiments, four fecal pellets of SFB mono-colonized mice (provided by Dan Littman) 
were dissolved in 20 ml sterile PBS and filtered though a 100 μm cell strainer. 200 μl of 
fecal suspensions were gavaged via oral route to 4 week-old female Jackson mice. Control 
mice were gavaged with PBS. The SFB colonization was tested on day 7 following co-
housing or SFB-gavaging. For ablation of intestinal bacteria, Taconic-derived female mice 
were orally gavaged with vancomycin hydrochloride (Fisher) (2.5 mg/kg) every two days, 
starting 7 days prior to breeding. Mouse fecal pellets were collected and stored at −80 °C 
before and after vancomycin treatments.
Human commensal bacteria-gavaged mice
Twenty human-associated Th17-inducing bacterial strains were isolated from fecal samples 
of a patient with ulcerative colitis21. Fifteen strains (1A9, 1F8, 1D2, 1F7, 1D4, 2D9, 2E3, 
2E1, 1D10, 1E3, 2H6, 2G4, 2G11, 1B11 and 1C2) were grown on Reinforced Clostridial 
Agar (Oxoid), two strains (1C12, 1E11) were on GAM Agar (Nissui), two strains (1D1, 
2F7) were on Schaedler Agar (BD), and one strain (2H11) was on Tryptic Soy Agar (BD). 
Two days after plating, microbes were scraped from agar plates, suspended in 5 ml of 20% 
glycerol in PBS, and mixed with equal number of live bacteria (approximately final 
concentrations of 5 × 108 CFU/ml of each strain). The mixture of twenty bacterial strains 
were stored at −80°C until use. Pregnant Jax mice were inoculated twice by oral gavages at

 E3.5 and E10.5, with 200-300 μl of bacterial suspension. For the IL-17 cytokine blockade 
experiment, monoclonal IL-17a blocking antibody (clone 50104; R&D) or isotype control 
antibody (IgG2a, clone 54447; R&D) were administered 8 h before maternal immune 
activation via i.p. route (300 μg/animal). For colonization with B. Fragilis, B. Adolescentis 
and adherent E. coli CD-SpA 2A, pregnant Jax mice were inoculated three times by oral 
gavages at E4.5, E6.5 and E8.5 with 200 μl of bacteria suspension. (approximately final 
concentrations of 1 × 109 CFU/ml of each strain). Bacterial stocks were prepared as 
previously described22,23.
Listeria-gavaged mice
Listeria monocytogenes19 was cultured in BHI broth media (Sigma, Cat no 35286 cfu). 
Pregnant Jax mice were inoculated three times by oral gavages at E4.5, E6.5 and E8.5 with 
200 μl of bacteria suspension (approximately final concentrations of 2×109 CFU/ml). 
Colonization levels were determined by collecting mouse fecal samples at E12.5, re-
suspending them with PBS and subsequently plating on BHI agar.
Cross-fostering
The day on which pups were born was considered P0. Pups were cross-fostered sometime 
between P0 and P1. Whole litters were removed from the original mothers. Pups were gently 
mixed with the bedding of the new cage. Pups were then introduced to the new cage with a 
foster mother. Pups from PBS- and poly(I:C)-treated Taconic mothers were cross-fostered to 
poly(I:C)- and PBS-treated Taconic mothers, respectively. Additionally, pups from Taconic- 
and Jax-derived mothers were cross-fostered to a Jax- and Taconic- derived dam, 
respectively.
Behavioral assays
All behavioral testing were carried out according to the previously established behavioral 
schemes8 with minor modifications. Blinding was done for all the behavioral experiments 
except for the experiments with human bacteria.
Ultrasonic vocalizations—On P9, both male and female offspring mice were removed 
from the nest and habituated to the testing room for 30 min. After the habituation period, 
mouse pups were placed in a clean 15cm glass Pyrex high wall dish. Ultrasonic 
vocalizations (USVs) were detected for 3 min using an UltraSoundGateCM16/CMPA 
microphone (AviSoft) in the sound attenuation chamber under stable temperature and light 
control, and recorded with SAS Prolab software (AviSoft). USVs were measured between 
33-125kHz using Ultravox software (Noldus information Technology, USA). Due to the 
unreliability of automated USV scoring, all pup USV calls were counted manually and 
plotted on the y-axis. Since both male and female pups of poly(I:C)-injected mothers 
emitted comparable levels of USVs (Extended Data Fig. 1a), we did not separately analyze 
male versus female USV phenotypes. Both sexes were used for the experiments.
Three-Chamber social approach—8–12-week-old male mice were tested for social 
behavior using the three-chamber social approach paradigm. Experimental mice were 
habituated for 1 h in separate clean holding cages and then introduced into a three-chamber

 arena with only empty object-containment cages (circular metallic cages, Stoelting 
Neuroscience) for a total 10-min acclimation phase in two 5 min sessions. The following 
day the mice were placed in the center chamber (without access to the left and right social 
test areas) and allowed to explore the center area for 5 min. After this exploration period, 
barriers to adjacent chambers were removed, allowing mice to explore the left and right 
arenas, which contained a social object (unfamiliar C57BL/6 male mouse) in one chamber 
and an inanimate object (black rubber stopper) in the other chamber. Experimental mice 
were given 10 min to explore both chambers and measured for approach behavior as 
interaction time (i.e. sniffing, approach) with targets in each chamber (within 2 cm). 
Sessions were video-recorded and object exploration time and total distance moved were 
analyzed using the Noldus tracking system. % interaction was calculated as the percentage 
of time spent investigating the social stimulus out of the total exploration time of both 
objects (Supplementary Table 2) and plotted on the y-axis. Arenas and contents were 
thoroughly cleaned between testing sessions. Multiple social targets from different home 
cages were used for testing to prevent potential odorant confounds from target home cages.
Marble burying test—Male mice were placed in a testing arena (arena size: 40× 20 cm2, 
bedding depth: 3 cm) containing 20 glass marbles, which were laid out in four rows of five 
marbles equidistant from one another. At the end of a 15 min exploration period, mice were 
gently removed from the testing cages and the number of marbles buried was recorded. A 
marble burying index was scored as 1 for marbles covered >50% by bedding, 0.5 for ~50% 
covered, or 0 for anything less. Percentage of buried marbles is plotted on the y-axis.
Open field test—Mice underwent a 15-min exploration period in the testing arena (arena 
size: 50×50 cm2). Sessions were video-recorded and analyzed for time spent in the center 
(center size: 25×25 cm2) using EthoVision Noldus tracking system (Noldus, Netherlands). 
Time spent in the center of an open field is plotted on the y-axis.
Immunohistochemistry
Adult male mice were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for overnight at 
4 °C. The brains were removed and sectioned at 50 μm thickness with a Leica VT100S 
vibratome (Leica, USA). Slices were permeabilized with blocking solution containing 0.4% 
Triton X-100, 2% goat serum, and 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then 
incubated with anti-SATB2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) (ab51502, Abcam) 
antibodies for overnight at 4°C. The following day, slices were incubated with fluorescently 
conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, and 
mounted in vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images of 
stained brain slices were acquired using confocal microscope (LSM710. Carl Zeiss) with a 
20X objective lens. The cortical malformation images were analyzed using Image J 
software. The images were cropped to have S1 cortical patches in the center.
Analysis of cortical patches
Cortical patches were identified as cortical regions devoid of SATB2 expression. The size of 
the cortical patches in the S1 was calculated using Zen software (Carl Zeiss). The cortical

 region was divided into 10 equal laminar blocks representing different depths of the cortex. 
SATB2 positive cells were quantified manually.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Terminal ileum tissues from mice (12-14 weeks old) were cut open and fixed with 2.5 % 
glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for overnight and processed for standard 
SEM at EM center, University of Massachusetts Medical School. All samples were taken on 
a Hitachi S-4800 Type II Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope.
16S rRNA quantitative PCR analysis
Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from the fecal pellets of mice with phenol-chloroform 
extraction. qPCR was performed to quantify relative abundance of SFB, human commensal 
bacteria or total bacteria using group specific 16S rDNA primers (Supplementaty Table 3). 
Undetected qPCR values from non-colonized samples were replaced with a Ct value of 40 
for the purpose of comparision.
Lamina propria mononuclear cell preparation
For mononuclear cell isolations, both mesenteric fat tissues and Peyer’s patches were 
carefully removed from intestinal tissues. Terminal ileal or colonic tissues were incubated in 
5 mM EDTA in PBS containing 1 mM DTT at 37°C on a shaker (200 rpm) for 20 min. 
Tissues were washed one more time. Tissues were then further digested for 30 min at 37 °C 
in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.0 mg/ml Collagenase D (Roche) and 100 
μg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Digested tissues were then filtered using a 100 μm cell strainer and 
incubated for additional 10 min at 37°C. Mononuclear cells were isolated from an interphase 
of percoll gradients (40:80 gradient).
Flow cytometry
Mononuclear cells were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate 
(PMA) (Sigma) and 500 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma) in the presence of GolgiStop (BD) in 
complete T cell media at 37°C for 5 h. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were stained with Pacific Blue-conjugated 
anti-CD4 (RM-5), PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-CD8a (53-6.7), APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-
TCRβ (H57-597), FITC-conjugated anti-CD62L (MEL-14), APC-conjugated anti-CD44 
(IM7), PE-conjugated-CD25 (PC61.5), PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated-CD19 (eBio1D3), APC-
conjugated anti-CD45.1 (A20), FITC-conjugated anti-CD45.2 (104), Pacific Blue-
conjugated anti-CD11c (N418), FITC conjugated-anti-CD11b (M1/70), PerCP-Cy5.5-
conjugated-anti-CD103 (2E7) (eBioscience), Biotin-conjugated Vβ14 (14-2) (BD 
phamigen) and PE-Cy7-conjugated-Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were 
further stained intracellularly with APC-conjugated anti-RORγ (B2D) (eBioscience) and 
PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-IL-17a (eBio17B7) (eBioscience) using Foxp3 staining/
permeabilization buffer (eBioscience). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on an LSRII 
(BD Biosciences). All data were re-analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star).

 Adoptive transfer
Spleen and lymph nodes from 7B8 Tg mice were collected and disassociated. Red blood 
cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (Lonza). Naïve CD4+ T cells (CD62Lhi CD44lo 
TCRvβ14+ CD4+ CD19−) from CD45.1+ 7B8 Tg mice were sorted on a BD FACS Aria II. 
Sorted 5×104 cells were transferred into congenic CD45.2 recipient mice by tail vein 
injection.
Cell Sorting
Mononuclear cells were isolated at E14.5 from small intestines of poly(I:C)-treated pregnant 
Il-17agfp or B6 mice. GFP+ and GFP− T cells, gated on CD8− CD19− TCRβ+CD4+, were 
sorted with a FACSAria (BD biosciences). DCs were stained with antibodies and sorted 
based on their surface expression of CD103 and CD11b (gated on CD4− CD8− CD19− 
MHCII+ CD11c+).
Ex vivo mononuclear cell culture
Mononuclear cells isolated from ilea of either PBS- or poly(I:C)-treated mice on E14.5 were 
cultured in vitro with poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/ml). CD4+ or CD11c+ cells were positively selected 
using microbeads (Miltenyi). For co-culture assay, CD4+ cells (1.5 – 3.5 × 104 cells/mL) 
were cultured with CD11c+ cells (7.5 – 16 × 104 cells/ml) at 1:5 ratio in each well. CD4+ 
and CD11c+ cells were incubated for 24-48 h with IgG antibody (20 ng/ml) or with anti-
IL-1β antibody (20 ng/ml), anti-IL-6 antibody (20 ng/ml) and anti-IL-23p19 antibody (20 
ng/ml) (R&D System) with or without poly(I:C) stimulation (2.5 μg/ml) (Sigma). CD4+ 
cells were cultured with recombinant IL-1β (10ng/ml), IL-6 (5ng/ml) and IL-23 (5ng/ml) 
(R&D System). All cells were cultured in T cell media: RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) 
supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone) and 50 U penicillin-
streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cell culture supernatant was used for ELISA analyses.
ELISA
IL-17a, TNF-α, IFN-β, IL-1β and IL-23 levels were measured according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol (BioLegend). IL-6 and IFN-γ levels were measured according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol (eBioscience).
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. ANOVAs were followed by 
Tukey or Sidak tests. All data are represented as mean +/− SEM. Sample sizes were 
determined based on similarly conducted studies8. When conducting behavioral assays, 
cages were pseudo-randomly assigned for tests. Detailed statistical analyses for behavioral 
assays are listed below.
