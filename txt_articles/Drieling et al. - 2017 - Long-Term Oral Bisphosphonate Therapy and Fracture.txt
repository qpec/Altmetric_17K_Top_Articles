Abstract
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES—A Food and Drug Administration review found inconclusive 
evidence that long-term bisphosphonate therapy prevents fractures and called for research among 
high-risk subgroups. This study examines the association of long-term bisphosphonate use with 
fracture among older women with high fracture risk.
DESIGN—Retrospective cohort.
SETTING—Women’s Health Initiative.
PARTICIPANTS—Older women who reported at least two years of bisphosphonate use in 2008–
9 (n=5,120).
MEASUREMENTS—Exposure data were from a current medications inventory. Outcomes (hip, 
clinical vertebral, wrist/forearm, and any clinical fracture) were ascertained annually. Using 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated the association of longer duration of 
bisphosphonate use (3–5, 6–9, and 10–13 years) with fracture, using two years as the referent 
group.
RESULTS—On average participants were 80 years old and followed for 3.7 (SD: 1.2) years. 
There were 127 hip, 159 wrist/forearm, 235 clinical vertebral, and 1,313 clinical fractures. In

 multivariate-adjusted analysis, 10–13 years of bisphosphonate use, compared with two years of 
use, was associated with higher risk of any clinical fracture (HR: 1.29 [95% CI: 1.07–1.57]). This 
association persisted in analyses limited to women with a prior fracture (HR: 1.30 [95% CI: 1.01–
1.67]) and women with no history of cancer (HR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.10–1.68]). The association of 
10–13 years of use, compared with 2 years of use, was not statistically significant for hip (HR: 
1.66 [95% CI: 0.81–3.40]), clinical vertebral (HR: 1.65 [0.99–2.76]), or wrist fracture (HR: 1.16 
[0.67–2.00]).
CONCLUSIONS—Among older women with high fracture risk, 10–13 years of bisphosphonate 
use was associated with higher risk of any clinical fracture compared with two years of use. These 
results add to concerns about the benefit of very long-term bisphosphonate use.

INTRODUCTION
Osteoporosis is a condition of low bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of the 
bone microarchitecture, which increases susceptibility to fracture. Age is the strongest risk 
factor for fracture and one in two women will experience an osteoporotic fracture after age 
50.1,2 Low BMD increases risk of fracture and by 2020 an estimated 61 million U.S. adults 
will have low BMD.2 Bisphosphonates, the most prescribed osteoporosis medication 
class,3,4 increase BMD by inhibiting bone resorption in the bone remodeling process.5,6 
However, recent studies question the benefit of long-term bisphosphonate use.7–9
A 2011 Cochrane Collaboration review of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 
alendronate, the most prescribed bisphosphonate, concluded that one to four years of therapy 
may prevent non-vertebral fracture in women with low BMD (T-score < −2.5 SD) or a 
vertebral fracture prior to treatment, but probably does not prevent fractures among women 
without those risk factors.8 Furthermore, a 2011 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
review of all long-term RCTs of bisphosphonates, including the Fracture Intervention Trial 
Long Term Extension (FLEX) Trial,10 found inconclusive evidence that bisphosphonate 
therapy beyond three to five years prevents fracture regardless of initial BMD.7,9 The lack of 
evidence of benefit from long-term bisphosphonate use and evidence of harms, including 
atypical fracture, led to a 2011 FDA recommendation that patients be routinely evaluated for 
the appropriateness of continued therapy during long-term use.8,11–14 However, the small 
size of the RCTs prevented the FDA review from examining long-term bisphosphonate use 
in high-risk subgroups.7,9 In particular, the FDA review included only 334 women over the 
age of 70 years who used bisphosphonates beyond five years and lacked data on use beyond 
11 years.7 Thus, the FDA has called for more research on long-term bisphosphonate use in 
subgroups.7
In 2008–9, over 17,000 postmenopausal Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) participants 
reported current bisphosphonate use with a wide range of duration patterns. The objective of 
the present analysis was to examine long-term bisphosphonate therapy, compared with short-

 term use, in relationship to fracture using data from the WHI, among older women with high 
fracture risk.
METHODS
Study Population
The WHI is a large, longitudinal study of women’s health begun in 1993 with primary aims 
to develop strategies that reduce incidence of heart disease, cancer, and fractures in 
postmenopausal women. It includes an observational study (N=93,676) and RCTs (N= 
68,132) evaluating estrogen alone, estrogen plus progestin, dietary modification, and 
calcium and vitamin D supplementation. After the planned study end date in 2005, re-
consent was required for continued follow-up (n=115,403). In 2008–9, 97,448 participants 
completed a current medication inventory administered by mailed questionnaire to all active 
participants. The WHI study design and methods are described elsewhere.15–18
In the subset of current oral bisphosphonate users who reported use for two years or more at 
the 2008–9 medication inventory, had follow-up data thereafter, and had a 5-year hip 
fracture risk of 1.5% or greater, we analyzed the association of longer duration of use (3–5, 
6–9, 10–13 years) with incident site-specific fracture (hip, wrist/forearm, and clinical 
vertebral) and with any clinical fracture, using shorter duration of use (2 years) as the 
referent group. We limited the study to women who reported at least two years of 
bisphosphonate use to include women with persistent medication use. We chose two years as 
the referent group because this duration of use has been associated with lower fracture risk.7 
Guidelines recommend bisphosphonates as the preferred treatment for women with a high 
fracture risk (10-year hip fracture risk ≥ 3%) based on the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool 
(FRAX) score.19–21 To select a high-risk study sample, we identified women with a 
predicted 5-year risk of hip fracture of 1.5% or greater, which is comparable to the FRAX 
definition of high fracture risk, using a risk prediction algorithm developed and validated in 
the WHI that includes 11 clinical factors (age, weight, height, history of fracture after age 54 
years, parental hip fracture, smoking, corticosteroid use, race/ethnicity, self-reported health, 
self-reported physical activity, and treated diabetes).22 To reduce confounding from other 
medications that affect bone metabolism, we excluded women who ever reported use of 
calcitonin, selective estrogen reuptake modulators, parathyroid hormone, or aromatase 
inhibitors (n=1,801) and women who reported estrogen use within five years before the 
2008–9 medication inventory (n=260). Further, we excluded women who discontinued and 
resumed bisphosphonate use prior to the medication inventory (n=1,000). After exclusions, 
there were 5,120 women included in the present analysis.
Exposure Ascertainment
Women self-reported duration of bisphosphonate use on the mailed 2008–9 medication 
inventory form which instructed participants to gather all current medication prescriptions 
and to use information from the prescription labels.23 Participants wrote the drug name, 
strength, and type (e.g., capsule, inhaler, etc.), and provided the duration of use (< 1 month, 
1–12 months, and number of years).

 Covariates
Covariates were selected a priori based on literature review to include factors associated with 
bisphosphonate use or fracture risk. Participants self-reported age, race, education level, 
fracture, physical function, general health rating (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor),24 
severe memory impairment (Alzheimer’s disease or dementia), recreational physical activity, 
diabetes mellitus treated with shots or medication, glucocorticoid use (≥ 3 months), parental 
hip fracture, Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, alcohol use (≥ 3 servings/day), calcium 
supplement use, smoking status, and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. To adjust for potential 
differences in BMD among participants, the predicted risk of hip fracture within five years 
was calculated from an 11-item algorithm developed and validated in the WHI.22 The 5-year 
hip fracture risk score was significantly correlated with BMD among 10,418 WHI 
participants for whom both measures were available.25 Body mass index (BMI [kg/m2]) was 
collected at clinical exams at years 0, 3, 6, and 9 for RCT participants and at years 0 and 3 
for observational study participants. History of other medications was collected at years 0, 3, 
6, and 9 for RCT participants and at years 0, 3, and 4–8 for observational participants. 
Cancer diagnosis was self-reported and then, confirmed by medical record review.17 
Physical function score was calculated from the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, with higher 
numbers indicating better physical function.26 Recreational physical activity was assessed 
by self-report on a validated study questionnaire27 and categorized in metabolic equivalent-
hours per week.28 This analysis used the most recent values and measures collected at or 
before the 2008–9 medication inventory.
Outcome Ascertainment
Outcomes of interest for this analysis were incident hip, clinical vertebral, and wrist/forearm 
fracture, and incident clinical fracture at any site. Outcomes were ascertained by self-report 
on annual forms, which asked women to report the first lifetime occurrence for site-specific 
fractures.17 The specific date of hip and femur fractures was collected by self-report for all 
participants throughout follow-up and, also adjudicated by medical record review for all 
participants through 2010, and for all participants in the hormone therapy RCT, and for 
African American, and Hispanic participants after 2010 (20% of participants). For other 
fractures, the fracture date was recorded as the completion date of the annual form. The 
WHI definition of clinical fracture excludes fractures of the finger, toe, jaw, nose, face, skull, 
rib, sternum, and cervical spine.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Analysis—We described the 5,120 bisphosphonate users included in the 
fracture analysis grouped by duration of use (2, 3–5, 6–9, and 10–13 years) and compared 
groups using ANOVA and the chi-square test.
Statistical Analysis of Fracture Incidence—Participants contributed follow-up time 
from the date of the 2008–9 medication inventory until the occurrence of fracture, death, 
loss-to-follow-up, or end of study follow-up in 2013–14.12 We presented the fracture 
incidence per 1,000 person-years for each outcome type during follow-up. Association 
between duration of bisphosphonate use and fracture was estimated using multivariate Cox

 proportional hazards survival models that compared 3–5, 6–9, and 10–13 years of 
bisphosphonate use with two years of use (reference group). There was one model for each 
site-specific fracture type (hip, wrist/forearm, and clinical vertebral fracture) and one model 
for any clinical fracture. Models for site-specific incident fracture excluded women who 
reported an incident fracture for that site prior to the start of follow-up (n=271 for hip, 
n=1,177 for wrist/forearm, and n=361 for clinical vertebral fracture). The models were 
adjusted a priori for age (years), race, education level, BMI, physical function, general 
health rating, severe memory impairment diagnosis, recreational physical activity, treated 
diabetes mellitus, glucocorticoid use, 5-year hip fracture risk score, estrogen use within 6–10 
years before medication inventory, calcium supplement use, parental hip fracture, 
Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, alcohol use, smoking status, cancer diagnosis, and 
rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. All models were stratified by a history of fracture after age 
54 years. Subjects with missing covariate data were excluded from multivariate models 
(n=150; 2.9% of subjects). All statistical tests were two-tailed (α=0.05) and performed in 
Stata version 13.
Additional Analyses—To create a more homogeneous study sample, we performed a 
sensitivity analysis limited to women with a history of fracture after age 54 (n=2,779). 
Because some cancers and cancer treatments increase fracture risk,29 we conducted a 
sensitivity analyses limited to women with no history of cancer before the medication 
inventory (n=4,369). To examine the association of each additional year of bisphosphonate 
use with fracture, we modeled bisphosphonate use as a continuous variable (years of use) 
and presented the results as the predicted hazard ratio associated with a 5-year increase in 
duration of bisphosphonate use, which is equivalent to the interquartile range of duration of 
bisphosphonate use. All additional analyses were adjusted for the same covariates as in the 
primary analysis and were stratified by history of fracture, except for the analysis limited to 
women with a history of fracture.
RESULTS
Descriptive characteristics
Characteristics of all 97,448 women who completed the 2008–9 medication inventory form 
are described in Supplementary Table S1. Among the 5,120 women in the analysis, 642 
(13%) had used bisphosphonates for two years, 1,746 (34%) for 3–5 years (average 4.1 years 
[SD: 0.9]), 1,031 (20%) for 6–9 years (average 7.3 years [SD: 1.0]), and 1,701 (33%) for 
10–13 years (average 11.1 years [SD: 1.4]; Table 1). For all groups, the average age was 
approximately 80 years and 97% were over 70 years of age. Having a college degree or 
higher educational attainment was more common and estrogen use within the 6–10 years 
before the 2008–9 medication inventory was least common among women with longer 
duration of bisphosphonate use. Among women with 6–9 or 10–13 years of bisphosphonate 
use, on average, BMI was lower and diabetes was less common, and physical function score, 
recreational physical activity, and general health were higher than among women with 2 or 
3–5 years of use. Other characteristics including history of fracture after age 54 did not 
significantly differ between groups.

 Fracture Outcomes
Women in the fracture analysis were followed for an average of 3.7 (SD: 1.2) years. During 
follow-up, there were 127 hip fractures, 159 wrist/forearm fractures, 235 clinical vertebral 
fractures, and 1,313 clinical fractures (Table 2). The unadjusted fracture rate per 1,000 
person-years was highest for the 10–13 years of bisphosphonate use group for all fracture 
outcome types except for clinical vertebral fracture. Women with two years of 
bisphosphonate use had the lowest unadjusted fracture rate for all fracture outcome types 
except for wrist/forearm fracture.
In the primary multivariate-adjusted survival analysis, 10–13 years of bisphosphonate use 
was associated with higher risk of any clinical fracture compared with two years of use (HR: 
1.29 [95% CI: 1.07–1.57]). Although the associations for 10–13 years were not statistically 
significant for any site-specific fracture, the hazard ratios were higher for hip and clinical 
vertebral fracture (HR: 1.66 [95% CI: 0.81–3.40] and HR: 1.65 [0.99–2.76]). There was no 
significant association of 3–5 years or 6–9 years of bisphosphonate use with fracture 
outcomes compared with two years of use.
In sensitivity analyses limited to women with a history of fracture after age 54 and limited to 
women with no history of cancer, 10–13 years of bisphosphonate use remained associated 
with higher risk of any clinical fracture (HR: 1.30 [95% CI: 1.01–1.67]; Table 3 and HR: 
1.36 [95% CI: 1.10–1.68]; Table 4). In the additional analysis that modeled bisphosphonate 
exposure as a continuous variable, a 5-year increase in bisphosphonate use was associated 
with a 15% higher risk of any clinical fracture (95% CI: 1.07–1.25), a 33% higher risk of hip 
fracture (95% CI: 1.03–1.72), and a 21% higher risk of clinical vertebral fracture (95% CI: 
1.00–1.47).
DISCUSSION
Our study examined the association of fracture risk with bisphosphonate use among more 
high-risk, older, female long-term bisphosphonate users than any previous study and notably 
included 1,701 women who had used bisphosphonates for 10 or more years. Our 
multivariate-adjusted analysis found that 10–13 years of bisphosphonate use was associated 
with higher risk of any clinical fracture, compared with two years of use. This association 
remained significant in sensitivity analyses limited to women with a history of fracture and 
limited to women without a history of cancer. The associations for 10–13 years of use were 
not significant for site-specific fractures, but the hazard ratios were higher for hip and 
clinical vertebral fracture. In additional analyses modeling bisphosphonate exposure as a 
continuous variable, longer exposure was associated with higher risk of any clinical fracture, 
hip fracture, and clinical vertebral fracture.
Our findings support previous studies that found no significant benefit for overall fracture 
risk during long-term bisphosphonate use, compared with shorter duration of use.7,10,30–35 
The 2011 FDA review of long-term bisphosphonate RCTs found similar fracture rates 
during short-term and long-term bisphosphonate use among women over age 70.7 Post-hoc 
FLEX Trial analysis found a benefit for clinical vertebral fractures, but no benefit for non-
vertebral fractures during 10 years of alendronate use, compared with discontinuing after 5

 years.10 An RCT of risedronate found no association between 6–7 years of bisphosphonate 
use and fracture risk, compared with 1–2 years of use.34 Wang et al found no benefit for 
overall fracture risk comparing up to eight years of use with less than five years of 
exposure.30
Observational study findings are mixed for the association of hip fracture with long-term 
bisphosphonate use, compared with shorter exposure.33,35,36 Our study and studies by Erviti 
and Pazianas found no hip fracture benefit with longer bisphosphonate exposure while a 
study by Abrahamsen found a benefit for 10 or more years of use.33,35,36 The inclusion of 
patients who had not used bisphosphonates long enough to achieve benefit may explain 
Abrahamsen’s findings. These studies required only one bisphosphonate prescription for 
study inclusion.33,35,36 However, Pazianas additionally excluded patients with a femoral 
fracture within three months of the initial prescription and Erviti used a test for trend to 
examine longer exposure.33,35 Participants in the Abrahamsen study with less than one year 
of exposure had the highest fracture incidence, but when Abrahamsen switched the referent 
group to three to less than five exposure years, 10 or more years of exposure was not 
beneficial.36 Our study selected participants who had used bisphosphonates long enough to 
achieve benefit by specifically requiring two years of bisphosphonate use.
The contrast between our findings and the FLEX Trial finding of benefit for clinical 
vertebral fracture risk also deserves consideration.10 Bisphosphonate efficacy may differ in 
the population we examined compared with the FLEX Trial participants who were 
younger.10 RCTs are unlikely to provide the information needed about fractures during very 
long-term bisphosphonate use.37 Given the limited evidence for fracture risk reduction, 
guidelines recommending up to 10 years of bisphosphonate treatment should be 
reconsidered in light of observational study data particularly for elderly women.19
Biological changes in bone during long-term bisphosphonate use may explain our findings 
including over-suppression of the bone remodeling process that may damage bone.38–41 
Suppression of bone remodeling inhibits resorption of damaged bone, which may increase 
bone heterogeneity and, thereby, increase bone brittleness.42 Reviews by the FDA and 
American Society of Bone and Mineral Research concur that bisphosphonate use beyond 3–
5 years increases risk of rare atypical femur fractures, with the rates of atypical fractures 
increasing from 1.78/100,000 during 2 years of use to 113/100,000 during 8 to 9.9 years of 
use.7,43,44 Suppression of bone remodeling for 10 or more years may increase overall risk of 
fracture among older women with high fracture risk.
Although our analysis adjusted for many participant characteristics associated with fracture, 
long-term bisphosphonate users may have had other risk factors not accounted for in our 
analysis, such as lower BMD at initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. However, to 
minimize confounding by unmeasured characteristics such as BMD, we restricted our 
analysis to bisphosphonate users with a 5-year hip fracture risk of 1.5% or greater using the 
WHI fracture risk algorithm and adjusted for 5-year hip fracture risk score, which 
significantly correlates with BMD and fracture risk.22,25

 Our finding that hip and vertebral fracture risk appeared to be elevated while wrist/forearm 
fracture risk was not elevated also warrants more investigation. The unique etiology of site-
specific incident fracture may explain differences by fracture site. Incident wrist/forearm 
fracture, for instance, occurs at an earlier age on average than hip or clinical vertebral 
fracture.45 Our analysis only examined incident site-specific fracture; before the start of 
follow-up, a greater percentage of women in this analysis had had an incident wrist/forearm 
fracture than had had a hip or clinical vertebral fracture. Thus, more women were excluded 
from the site-specific analysis for wrist/forearm fracture.
There were several additional limitations. Not all fractures were confirmed by medical 
record review. However, a validity study found good to excellent validity of self-reported 
fracture in the WHI.46 Medication use was self-reported, but a validity study of the 2008–9 
medication inventory found near perfect agreement of self-report with pharmacy records for 
four chronically used medications, including bisphosphonates.47 Our study lacked 
information about bisphosphonate persistence during the follow-up. Additionally, our 
findings are not generalizable to comparing long-term use with never initiating 
bisphosphonates, because our referent group was short-term use.
There are several strengths of this analysis. The large sample included older long-term 
bisphosphonate users (mean age 80 years) and included women with up to 13 years of use. 
Although the study lacked BMD data, the analysis adjusted for 5-year hip fracture risk 
score, which is correlated with BMD.22,25 Additionally, the analysis adjusted for many 
participant characteristics predictive of fracture risk and characteristics were similar across 
exposure groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among older women with high fracture risk, 10–13 years of bisphosphonate use was 
associated with higher risk of any clinical fracture compared with two years of use; while 3–
5 and 6–9 years of use were not associated with fracture risk. Longer exposure was 
associated with site-specific fracture risk when bisphosphonate exposure was modeled as a 
continuous variable, but not when it was modeled as a categorical variable. These findings 
add to concerns about the safety of long-term bisphosphonate use. Confirmatory studies are 
needed to inform guidelines for the optimal duration of bisphosphonate use.
