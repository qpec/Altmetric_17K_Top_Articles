Objective. To describe the character and composition of the 2015 US adult rheumatology workforce, evaluate work-
force trends, and project supply and demand for clinical rheumatology care for 2015–2030.
Methods. The 2015 Workforce Study of Rheumatology Specialists in the US used primary and secondary data sources
to estimate the baseline adult rheumatology workforce and determine demographic and geographic factors relevant to
workforce modeling. Supply and demand was projected through 2030, utilizing data-driven estimations regarding the
proportion and clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) of academic versus nonacademic practitioners.
Results. The 2015 adult workforce (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) was estimated to be 6,013
providers (5,415 clinical FTE). At baseline, the estimated demand exceeded the supply of clinical FTE by 700 (12.9%). By
2030, the supply of rheumatology clinical providers is projected to fall to 4,882 providers, or 4,051 clinical FTE (a 25.2%
decrease in supply from 2015 baseline levels). Demand in 2030 is projected to exceed supply by 4,133 clinical FTE (102%).
Conclusion. The adult rheumatology workforce projections reflect a major demographic and geographic shift that will sig-
nificantly impact the supply of the future workforce by 2030. These shifts include baby-boomer retirements, a millennial
predominance, and an increase of female and part-time providers, in parallel with an increased demand for adult rheuma-
tology care due to the growing and aging US population. Regional and innovative strategies will be necessary to manage
access to care and reduce barriers to care for rheumatology patients.
INTRODUCTION
In 2005, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) con-
ducted the last formal workforce study of US rheumatologists
(1,2). At that time, the demand for adult rheumatologists was
projected to exceed the supply by more than 2,500 rheumatol-
ogists by 2025. The demand for adult rheumatology services
was projected to significantly increase by approximately 46%
due to the aging of the US population, while the supply was
predicted to increase by only about 1.2%. In response to the
projected need, there was a 4.6% increase in adult fellowship
programs, from 108 to 113, with a 17.6% increase in fellow-
ship positions from 398 to 468 (3,4). In addition, the Associa-
tion of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) expanded

 educational opportunities for nurse practitioners (NPs) and
physician assistants (PAs) interested in rheumatology.
Since 2006, despite an increase in the number of graduat-
ing physicians from US medical schools of over 20%, there
are still significant anticipated physician shortages far
beyond primary care (5,6). In 2013, the majority (90%) of
adult rheumatologists practiced in urban metropolitan
areas, resulting in a maldistribution of rheumatology care
with underserved micropolitan and rural areas of the US
(7). Additionally, a large portion of the adult rheumatology
workforce is nearing retirement, and the workforce is pro-
jected to grow at a much slower rate than in past decades
(8). This coincides with an anticipated 28% increase in
doctor-diagnosed arthritis in adults ages ≥18 years (52.5–67
million) by 2030 (9,10). For these reasons, the ACR estab-
lished a workforce study group (WSG) in 2015 in order to 1)
describe the character and composition of the current clini-
cal rheumatology workforce, 2) identify demographic and
employment trends, 3) assess workforce and succession (re-
tirement) planning and the potential to ensure access to
care for patients with rheumatic diseases, 4) develop
assumptions regarding the key factors affecting the supply
of and demand for rheumatologists, 5) identify potential
paths for the evolution of workforce supply and demand
and their associated implications, 6) conduct a comprehen-
sive, patient-centered integrative approach that attempts to
capture both a more realistic clinical effort estimation and a
better picture of access-to-care issues, and 7) conduct sensi-
tivity analyses on the workforce model to determine holis-
tic “best-case” and “worst-case” scenarios (11).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
WSG. The WSG included a small core leadership advi-
sory group and a diverse membership group of volunteer
rheumatology specialists to ensure wide-ranging experience
and perspectives relative to rheumatology workforce issues
(11). The ACR conducted this workforce study with the
expertise from the Academy for Academic Leadership
consultants in Atlanta, Georgia. The WSG determined data
collection procedures, provided guidance in the design of the
workforce survey of ACR/ARHP members, identified critical
factors affecting supply and demand for rheumatology
services, decided on the workforce study modeling process,
and accepted the final workforce study findings. The
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board reviewed
the study and determined it to be exempt from ongoing
review (exemption 2, 45 CFR 46.101.[b]; HUM00104523).
Data collection. A mixed-methods approach was used,
including both primary and secondary data, to identify and
evaluate workforce issues that would help in the devel-
opment of the workforce model for predicting the future
rheumatology workforce. Data were collected from many sec-
ondary sources, including the American Medical Association
(AMA), the American Board of Internal Medicine, the Rheu-
matology Nurses Society, and the National Commission
Certification of Physician Assistants, as well as other pub-
lished data. Primary data were also collected through
electronic surveys of ACR/ARHP members, current rheu-
matology fellows in training (FITs), and a group of rheuma-
tology patients identified by the Arthritis Foundation. These
data were supplemented by data collected through focus
groups and personal interviews.
Workforce study modeling. The WSG began with a
review of the methodology used in the 2005 workforce
study. The challenge was to develop a workforce model
that would include the complexity of the population and
their needs, and could translate those needs into clinical
care requirements. The WSG determined that the most
appropriate model to use as the basis of the workforce
study was an integrated workforce framework model that
combined
socioeconomic
factors
that
drive
economic
demand,
epidemiologic
factors
that
drive
need,
and
utilization rates that incorporate the current use of health
care services. The first step was to characterize the current
adult rheumatology workforce as to who provides direct
patient care, which in this study included physicians, NPs,
and PAs. Next, the WSG identified the critical modeling
factors. Both the characterization of the workforce and the
critical factors were determined from the secondary data
sources and the primary survey results. These generated
the supply and demand assumptions that were used in the
workforce study model (7,9,11–21) (Table 1).
Demand factors. The focus of the workforce model was
on the expressed patient demand, a market-based approach
that emphasizes the person as the unit of analysis. Factors
influencing
demand
included
health
care
utilization
patterns, prevalence of disease, changes in patient demo-
graphics, examination of contemporary geographic domes-
tic patterns of population distribution and density, cost of
rheumatology care, and per capita income impact. Metro-
politan and micropolitan areas were used as the unit of
analysis of future population trends, in consideration of the
projected aging US population, as states are often too large
of a unit to provide meaningful subnational analysis and,
in that way, results in obscured patterns worthy of
attention from either a regional or national perspective
(22,23). In 2015, unlike the 2005 workforce study, patients
were queried to determine their perceived needs. This
added another dimension that allowed the WSG to assess
Significance & Innovations
• The projected demand for adult rheumatology ser-
vices greatly exceeds the projected growth of the
rheumatology workforce.
• There is a geographic maldistribution of adult rheu-
matologists across the US that will worsen over the
next 15 years.
• Effective strategies to recruit fellows, nurse prac-
titioners, and physician assistants to support the
adult rheumatology workforce will be necessary
to address the anticipated workforce gap.
• Processes to retain rheumatology providers in the
workforce and to facilitate access to quality care
must be explored.

 the difference in perceived demand between rheuma-
tologists and patients. Multivariate and logistic regression
with backward stepwise analysis was used to determine
factors that contributed significantly to the model for adult
rheumatology services (F = 39.06, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.37).
Goodness-of-fit tests were used to determine model fit.
Supply factors. Supply factors included geographic dis-
tribution, productivity, succession trends, sex and genera-
tional breakdown, workload trends, practice settings, and
demographic breakdown of new graduate entrants into
rheumatology. Based on the information collected, the WSG
identified shifts in the demographic breakdown (e.g., sex and
generational differences), geographic distribution trends, and
practice patterns that indicated a much larger decline in the
supply of rheumatology effort than projected in the 2005
workforce study (1,2,11). This decline in supply was due to 3
major factors. First, the workforce survey identified an
increase in the number of retiring rheumatology specialists,
both physician and nonphysician providers. This crucial
component was used to help define the capacity for patient
access to care, now and in the future. Second, the anticipated
percentage of females entering the workforce was expected to
surpass the percentage of males by 2020. With this shift to a
more female-predominant workforce comes a projected re-
duction of approximately 7 working hours each week and
approximately 30% fewer patient visits annually, based
on survey responses and other published literature (5). Last,
the number of rheumatology graduates seeking part-time
employment is anticipated to grow.
Clinical
full-time
equivalent
(FTE). Because of the
changing demographics and pattern trends identified, the
WSG realized the importance of defining not only the actual
number of practitioners entering the workforce, but also
defining the clinical FTE. The clinical FTE is the ratio of
units that equate to the number of practitioners seeing
patients full time (e.g., 2 providers spending 0.5 FTE each
seeing patients would equate to 1.0 clinical FTE). This factor
was used to provide a clear picture of effort devoted to direct
patient care, and thereby a more realistic patient care treat-
ment model. The shift to a more female-predominant work-
force and the anticipated part-time workforce contributed to
the calculations of clinical FTE. The WSG also reached a
consensus after careful deliberation regarding clinical FTE
relative to practice setting for the purposes of this study,
which was corroborated by information from the environ-
mental scan conducted prior to the workforce study and
primary data collected through survey data of the workforce
and several focus groups, the latter consisting of private
practitioners, division directors, and academic rheumatology
professionals (22,24–30). A 1.0 clinical FTE was assigned to
adult rheumatology physicians working in nonacademic
settings (~80%), 0.5 FTE to those working in academic
settings (~20%), and 0.9 FTE to NPs/PAs working with adult
rheumatologists. Identifying specific trends in clinical FTE of
rheumatology
practitioners
(both
physician
and
non-
physician) is sensitive to assumptions about productivity.
Sensitivity testing (ST). To address the range in possible
productivity for these assumptions, sensitivity analyses
were conducted to cover the feasible range of these assump-
tions. ST is an analytic methodology used to build confi-
dence in results. It allows for alternate models to be used
in conjunction with a “base-case” model that incorporates
“best-estimated” values of all selected parameters. ST is used
to evaluate potential changes due to unexpected conditions
in the estimated economic, geographic, and demographic vari-
ables (11). ST was used to ascertain a best-case and worst-case
scenario, providing an estimated range of supply for and
demand of services through 2030.
The workforce model provided projections on the sup-
ply of and demand for rheumatology services for the US
between 2015 and through 2030 using 1) retrospective
data collected from various sources published since 2005
on projected provider and patient demographic changes,
trends in rheumatic diseases, changes in funding sources,
growing demand for nonphysician providers, compensa-
tion models, and reported job satisfaction; and 2) primary
data collected from rheumatology providers (physician
and nonphysician), current FITs, and patients (adult,
young adult, and pediatric). Because of the anticipated
excess demand, including nonphysician providers in the
baseline provided the ability to evaluate their effect on the
workforce. Additional details of the robust workforce
study methodology and assumptions can be found in the
2015 workforce study document (7,11–21) (Table 1).
RESULTS
Baseline rheumatology workforce. Adult rheumatology
providers were defined as rheumatologists, NPs, and PAs.
The estimated number of adult rheumatologists practicing in
the US in 2015 was 5,595; the corresponding clinical FTE was
estimated to be 4,997 (computed based on the clinical FTE
described in the Materials and Methods). The total number of
NPs practicing in adult rheumatology was estimated at 248,
with a corresponding clinical FTE of 228. The total number of
PAs was estimated at 207, with a corresponding clinical FTE
of 190. Thus, the overall total number of adult rheumatology
patient care providers in 2015 was just over 6,000 (n = 6,013),
with a corresponding clinical FTE of 5,415.
Demand factors. Of the factors used to assess future
demand for rheumatology services, one major driver of
demand was the aging population of the US. Based on data
reported by the US Census Bureau, the percentage of adults
age >65 years will increase by over 100% from 2014 through
2060 (18). Demand was also complicated by the number of
patients treated, and the amount of services provided, for
osteoarthritis. In addition, based on per capita income
compound growth from 2010 to 2015 and the forecasted
value for 2020, an estimated compound growth for 2015–
2030 will be approximately 2.5%, up 1.5% from 2005
(9,19–21). Last, demand also included a close examination
of metropolitan and micropolitan area population changes,
which affects where the demand will be the greatest (22,23).
Supply factors. Of the factors used to assess future
supply
for
rheumatology
specialists,
3
major
drivers
included workforce practice trends, geographic distribution
of rheumatology services, and changes in the demographic
breakdown of the new graduates entering the workforce
(7,9,11–21) (Table 1).

Battafarano et al
 Current workforce practice trends. Given the aging adult
rheumatology workforce and taking into consideration the
potential increases in demand for services, succession
patterns (e.g., retirement, anticipated changes in workload,
etc.) were critical. Labor workforce participation rates for
physicians of a given age, sex, and international medical
graduate (IMG) status from year to year were reflected in the
projections. There was also a growing portion of the provider
workforce (both males and females) who anticipated working
fewer hours per week and treating fewer patients per year.
This resulted in an approximately 14% (for male physicians)
to 19% (for female physicians) decrease in patient visits per
week by physicians since 2005 (5).
Geographic distribution of rheumatology workforce. In
2015, there was a maldistribution of adult rheumatologists
practicing
in
the
US
(9–14).
For
example,
21%
of
rheumatologists were in the Northeast, compared with only
3.9% in the Southwest (11) (Table 2). In 2015, the ratio of
provider per 100,000 patients by region ranged from 3.07 in
the Northeast to 1.28 in the Southwest. By 2025, there is an
anticipated decrease in all regions, ranging from 1.61 in the
Northeast to 0.50 in the Northwest (Figure 1).
New graduates entering the workforce. When considering
the future supply of adult rheumatologists, graduating
fellows who enter the workforce were an important factor in
the model. The calculated number depended on available
fellowship positions, the fill-rate of those positions, gradu-
ation rates, and number of IMGs who anticipate remaining in
the US. Other factors that contributed to the entering
workforce calculations included the projected sex shifts from
2015–2030 and those seeking part-time versus full-time
employment (7,9,11–21) (Table 1). At 2015 baseline, there
are a total of 5,595 rheumatologists; 2,294 are female and
3,301 are male. It is projected that there will be 5,385 (3,069
female/2,316 male) rheumatologists in 2020, 4,515 (2,574
female/1,941 male) rheumatologists in 2025, and 4,346 (2,477
female/1,869 male) rheumatologists in 2030.
Supply and demand projections. The supply and demand
projections of adult rheumatology services included NPs
and PAs. Figure 2 compares the total number of rheu-
matology providers (physician and nonphysician) to the
projected clinical FTE of all providers from 2015 to 2030.
The assumptions for each factor (Table 1) were included in
the workforce model. In 2015, demand exceeded supply by
700 clinical FTE (12.9%). By 2030, the demand is projected
to exceed supply by 4,133 clinical FTE (102%) (Figure 3).

2015 ACR Study of Adult Rheumatology Workforce Supply and Demand
621
 For ST, in the best-case scenario, the supply of the adult
rheumatology workforce by 2030 increased to 5,989 clinical
FTE, and demand decreased to 6,692 clinical FTE. This
reduced the excess demand from over 100% to 11.7%. In
contrast, the worst-case scenario decreased the supply to
3,592 and increased demand to 8,666. This increased the
excess demand to approximately 140% (Figure 4). The
assumptions used in the base workforce model reflected
the best estimates given the economic, social, and political
climates in 2015. Table 1 provides the assumptions used in
the base model, best-case model, and worst-case model.
DISCUSSION
The US is facing a significant deficit of physicians across
all specialties. The Council on Graduate Medical Education
projects a shortage of 85,000 physicians in 2020, which is
approximately 10% of today’s physician workforce (31).
The current US primary care physician workforce is in
jeopardy of accelerated decline because of decreased pro-
duction and accelerated attrition (23). The Association of
American Medical Colleges projects a shortage of 124,000
full-time physicians by 2025 (32). The 2015 rheumatology
workforce study identifies current and future shortages that
mirror the national projections.
The primary purpose of the 2015 ACR study was to assess
for significant trends in the projected workforce in order to
anticipate strategic planning and/or identify potential strate-
gies to explore workforce challenges. The 2015 study used a
patient-centered, integrated access-to-care focused approach.
Estimating the clinical FTE was a fundamental step in the
design of the 2015 study, to better understand the clinical pro-
ductivity of the workforce and its effect on access to care.

 between those working in nonacademic (~80%) and academic
settings (~20%), resulting in 1.0 FTE for those in nonacademic
settings and 0.5 FTE for those in academic settings (11).
The 2005 workforce study projected a shortage of 2,576
rheumatologists by 2025, which included applying clinical
productivity factors based on sex and age (1,2). The 2015
workforce study included many additional factors for clini-
cal productivity, including retirements and succession
planning (Table 1), which resulted in an estimated shortage
of 3,269 clinical FTE, including NPs and PAs, by 2025.
Additionally, the current study did not assume equilibrium
between supply and demand at baseline. Figure 3 reflects
the differences between supply and demand starting with a
2015 clinical FTE baseline of 5,415 to the projected clinical
FTE of 4,051 by 2030 for adult rheumatology providers. At
the 2015 baseline, the demand exceeded the supply by 700
clinical FTE (12.9); by 2030 the projected demand will
exceed the supply by 4,133 clinical FTE (102%).
These results represent a dramatic decline in the rheuma-
tology workforce from 2015 to 2030. The workforce shift is
due to many coinciding demographic changes. However,
there are potential strategies that may be considered to ad-
dress some of these workforce challenges. These include
recruitment of nonphysician providers, encouraging changes
in the regional distribution of the workforce, expansion of
telemedicine programs, retention of IMGs who train in
rheumatology, and improved practice efficiencies.
In response to the 2005 workforce study, the number of
first-year adult fellow training positions increased from 156
to 210, with over 95% fill-rate each year (2,4,33). Early medi-
cal student and internal medicine resident exposure to
rheumatology should enhance recruitment of internal medi-
cine residents to the field (34). Unfortunately, based on the
workforce study model, the projected loss of clinical FTE due
to retirees over the next 10 years greatly exceeds the capacity
of rheumatology training programs to replace them with new
graduates. While early exposure to rheumatologists and men-
torship prior to the selection of specialty training is important
(11,34), other mechanisms that potentiate re-distribution of
the workforce are also advantageous. Current FITs are com-
prised by greater than 50% IMGs, and the FIT survey (11)
delineated that nearly 20% of IMGs would choose to leave
the US after training (11,35). Thus retention strategies for this
important sector of new entrants into our workforce are war-
ranted (36). Moreover, strategies are needed to direct a seg-
ment of the workforce to underserved regions of the US; this
may include incentives to address the maldistribution of
rheumatologists (37,38). Initiatives to improve reimburse-
ment rates for cognitive subspecialties is ongoing with advo-
cacy from the AMA/Specialty Society Relative Value Scale
Update Committee and could potentially increase the pool of
trainees considering rheumatology as a career (39).
Financial incentive programs offer scholarships, loans
with service requirements, and loan repayment or forgive-
ness programs but typically focus on primary care practi-
tioners (36,39). There is evidence that financial incentive
programs increase the number of health care providers in
underserved areas (37,40). Participants in financial incen-
tive programs are more likely to serve in underserved areas
and remain in these areas longer than nonparticipating
peers (41–43). Expanding financial incentives with service
requirements may increase access to care in rural and
underserved communities (44). Surveys suggest that com-
petitive salaries, professional development, knowledge-
able support staff, and professional support increase the
likelihood of provider retention in rural or underserved
areas after completion of service commitments (45).
Hooker (46) and Dill et al (47) have discussed approaches
to expanding the rheumatology workforce utilizing NPs
and PAs. A web-based rheumatology curriculum for NPs
and PAs was created after the 2005 ACR workforce study to
help transition primary care NPs and PAs into a rheumatol-
ogy practice. NPs and PAs have been shown to be quite
effective in managing treat-to-target goals in a rheumatology
practice (48). As a result, there is an ACR/ARHP initiative
to consider formal NP/PA rheumatology training programs

 at selected sites. Recruitment and training strategies for
NPs and PAs into the adult rheumatology workforce to
improve access to care should be explored further.
The current distribution of adult rheumatologists is con-
centrated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and
West regions. These 4 regions currently exceed 2 adult
rheumatologists per 100,000 adults. This correlates closely
with popular metropolitan and suburban areas of the US.
However, regions like South Central, Southeast, and South-
west have significantly lower ratios of 1.52, 1.41, and 1.28,
respectively. By 2025, the vast majority of US regions will
only have 0.5–1.0 rheumatologists per 100,000 adults,
despite a growing aging population. The projected work-
force deficit and the maldistribution of rheumatologists are
not unique to the US (49–51). Addressing the maldistribu-
tion in access to rheumatologic care needs to be a priority;
one potential strategy is loan repayment initiatives to incen-
tivize new workforce entrants to work in underserved areas.
Other considerations could include part-time locum tenens
or volunteer services by rheumatologist retirees in under-
served communities. Local and intrastate disease manage-
ment models may enhance rheumatology support in some
communities and regions of the US.
Tele-medicine also has the potential to facilitate timely
care and improve access to care for underserved communi-
ties (52). Increased or delayed time to rheumatology care
is correlated with more severe disease, worse outcomes,
and increased health care cost (53). Tele-rheumatology/
tele-health modalities can include screening patient refer-
rals for new-onset connective tissue disease, electronic
(asynchronous) consultation, or synchronous video tele-
conference (VTC) for diagnosis and treatment (54). This
may work best where areas with excess supply (e.g.,
metropolitan areas) could expand care to underserved
areas. Currently, a VTC is often necessary for reimburse-
ment at the intrastate level; interstate VTC presently poses
legislative, regulatory, and malpractice challenges (55–57).
The projected shortage of adult rheumatologists and the
significant patient demand for rheumatologists will require
innovative and multifaceted strategies to effectively provide
rheumatology care. A dynamic ACR/ARHP web site for
patient education, practice models, business practices, col-
laboration, etc., could provide a centralized and effective
resource for education and quality care. Research funding
for studies investigating new practice models is needed. A
rheumatology cognitive payment model, not based on vol-
ume, may help focus rheumatology care for patients who
require it the most (39). Building rheumatology-specific
tools within electronic health records that facilitate quality
care and office practices without prohibitive administrative
burden could have a huge impact on provider satisfaction
and
retention.
Multidisciplinary
disease
management
approaches and shared appointments could maximize effi-
ciency while enhancing patient centeredness in the manage-
ment of chronic rheumatic disease (58,59). Integrating
fundamental musculoskeletal and rheumatology curricula
into primary care residencies is very valuable for quality
patient care and timely diagnosis and could reduce the
demand for rheumatology consultations (60–62). Shortages
in underserved areas may lead to creative community solu-
tions leveraging technology and using various providers,
teams, and even unconventional physician extenders to
facilitate patient care (63–65).
The strength of this study is that it utilized a comprehen-
sive, patient-centered integrative approach that included
numbers of required adult rheumatology providers while
applying service utilization rates for various populations.
This modeling approach allows socioeconomic factors to
drive demand, epidemiologic factors to drive need, and uti-
lization rates to incorporate health care services. Analyzing
the primary survey, the FIT survey, and patient surveys
allowed for input from multiple primary sources, strength-
ening assumptions for the integrated model. Estimated clin-
ical FTE is likely to project more accurate trends in the
adult clinical rheumatology workforce than estimating total
numbers of providers alone. Many data sources were refer-
enced and cross-referenced to determine the 2015 baseline
estimation of adult rheumatology practitioners. A robust
approach toward integrating changing demographics and
trends in practice was applied to the workforce model
(5,7,22,23,32). Finally, ST was used to ascertain the best-
case and worst-case scenario to estimate the range of supply
and demand for services from 2015–2030 (Figure 4).
Limitations include that primary survey data were col-
lected predominantly from ACR/ARHP members. While a
power analysis was conducted to ensure appropriate sam-
ple size of primary data collected, caution should be placed
on generalizability of these results. Surveys collect data at a
single point in time, and it is difficult to predict changes
over time. Self-reported data are not always accurate, and
web-based surveys may have some coverage bias. Pub-
lished literature influenced some of the assumptions for
estimates of supply and demand that were applied to this
study. Unanticipated factors could not be easily predicted,
and therefore the assumptions were based on equilibrium
of the market in 2015. Furthermore, workforce modeling is
multifaceted, and the influence of multiple factors on the
future supply of health care providers and demand for
services could not be easily predicted or modeled. The
political climate and health system changes may affect
the efficiency (either positively or negatively) and adequacy
of providers’ supply as well as patients’ access to care.
System-level changes cannot be accurately anticipated or
predicted, despite a good faith effort to determine variations
by conducting a best-case and worst-case scenario. There-
fore, modeling projections for supply and demand can
reflect workforce trends, but cannot accurately reflect adult
workforce total numbers or clinical FTE.
In summary, the 2015 ACR/ARHP workforce study pro-
jects a significant adult rheumatology workforce shortage
over the next 15 years; this is in parallel with the projections
for a national physician shortage and shortages in other sub-
specialties. The ACR/ARHP is committed to optimizing
quality rheumatology care and facilitating access to rheuma-
tology care. This will require a passionate vision and inno-
vative strategies by the ACR/ARHP, as well as at the state
and federal levels, to both manage patients with rheumatic
diseases and support our underserved communities. De-
creasing insurance barriers and health care regulations may
allow more rapid, timely, and creative solutions to offset the
projected rheumatologist shortage and the maldistribution
of rheumatologists in the US.
