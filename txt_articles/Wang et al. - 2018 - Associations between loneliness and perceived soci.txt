Abstract
Background: The adverse effects of loneliness and of poor perceived social support on physical health and
mortality are established, but no systematic synthesis is available of their relationship with the outcomes of mental
health problems over time. In this systematic review, we aim to examine the evidence on whether loneliness and
closely related concepts predict poor outcomes among adults with mental health problems.
Methods: We searched six databases and reference lists for longitudinal quantitative studies that examined the
relationship between baseline measures of loneliness and poor perceived social support and outcomes at follow
up. Thirty-four eligible papers were retrieved. Due to heterogeneity among included studies in clinical populations,
predictor measures and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted.
Results: We found substantial evidence from prospective studies that people with depression who perceive their
social support as poorer have worse outcomes in terms of symptoms, recovery and social functioning. Loneliness
has been investigated much less than perceived social support, but there is some evidence that greater loneliness
predicts poorer depression outcome. There is also some preliminary evidence of associations between perceived
social support and outcomes in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders.
Conclusions: Loneliness and quality of social support in depression are potential targets for development and testing
of interventions, while for other conditions further evidence is needed regarding relationships with outcomes.

Background
There is increasing interest in the effects of social rela-
tions on health, and in the service delivery and policy
implications of such effects [1]. Loneliness has been a
particularly prominent focus in recent research on phys-
ical health [2–4]. For instance, two meta-analytic reviews
have reported that loneliness and poor social support
are associated with higher mortality rates, and that the
effect is comparable with some well-established risk
factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking
[5, 6]. They are also predictive of development of coron-
ary heart disease and stroke [7], increases in systolic
blood pressure [8, 9], and chronic pain [10, 11] in longi-
tudinal studies. The effect of loneliness on physical
health may be via biological, psychological and/or behav-
ioural mechanisms, including physiological functioning,
neuroendocrine effects, gene effects, immune function-
ing, perception of stressful events, health behaviours and
sleep quality [2, 12, 13]. In contrast, while loneliness and
lack of social support are well-documented problems
among mental health service users [14], they have not been
prominent in research, mental health service delivery and
policy. Until recently, there has tended to be less focus on
the social determinants of mental health than on genetics
and neurobiology, but recent integrated aetiological models,

 such as the integrated sociodevelopmental-cognitive model,
bring social factors into the neuroscientific mainstream,
with increasing evidence that such factors need to be
included to achieve models of good explanatory value [15–
17]. An increasing focus on loneliness has also been driven
by recognition of its high prevalence, and of its wide ran-
ging impacts on physical health and mental well-being [17].
Despite this increasing recognition of its importance, to
date no systematic synthesis of the evidence on the rela-
tionship between loneliness and the outcomes of mental
health problems has been published.
Loneliness has been defined as a negative emotional
state that occurs when there is “a discrepancy between…
the desired and achieved patterns of social interaction”
[18]. Loneliness is sometimes seen as an essentially uni-
dimensional concept, sometimes as comprising two di-
mensions. Weiss
[19] proposed a multidimensional
concept of loneliness, categorising loneliness into social
and emotional dimensions. Social loneliness derived
from “the absence of socially integrative relationships”,
while emotional loneliness stemmed from the absence of
“a close emotional attachment” [19]. Social loneliness
occurs when a person does not have a wider social net-
work as desired, which can lead to the feelings of bore-
dom, exclusion and marginality [19, 20]. In contrast,
emotional loneliness occurs when someone is missing an
intimate relationship, which can result in distress and ap-
prehension [19, 20]. Psychometrically robust self-report
measures of loneliness have been developed and used ex-
tensively in research on physical health and on older
people, including the University of California at Los
Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale [21] and the de
Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale [22]. Feelings of loneliness
are more prevalent among people with mental illness than
in the general population [23, 24]. In a study of older
adults with major depression, dysthymia, or minor depres-
sion, 83% of the respondents reported loneliness and 38%
reported severe loneliness [25]. By comparison, only 32%
of non-depressed elderly people were lonely and 4% se-
verely lonely using the same loneliness scale [26]. In a
comparison of people with psychosis and a general popu-
lation sample with similar demographic characteristics,
the prevalence of loneliness among people with psychosis
was 79.9% compared with 35% in the general population
[27]. For people with depression, cross-sectional studies
have found up to 40% of respondents feeling lonely most
of the time [28], with a tenfold increase in the odds of be-
ing lonely compared to the general population [29].
Given the high prevalence of loneliness among people
with mental health problems and the evidence for its
harmful effects in other populations, good quality evi-
dence is needed on its impact on recovery from mental
health problems and on the health and social function-
ing of mental health service users. This has potential to
inform the development of preventive and therapeutic
interventions for which there is not as yet an evidence
base. An important question in evaluating the available
evidence is how far loneliness is conceptually and empir-
ically distinct from other concepts and measures related
to social relationships. Loneliness has been shown to be
only moderately correlated with more objectively mea-
sured concepts such as social isolation, social network
size and objective social support received from others
[30, 31]. However, subjectively rated concepts related to
social relationships are less easy to distinguish clearly
from loneliness [32]. For example, perceived social sup-
port refers to people’s beliefs about how much support is
potentially available from their relationships and social
contacts and about the quality of this support [33, 34].
This is distinct from received social support, a rating of
how often someone reports receiving particular support-
ive behaviours [33, 34]. Measures of perceived social
support assess the quality or adequacy of social support
from a subjective perspective. For instance, the two
widely used measures, the Multi-dimensional Scale of
Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) [35] and the Subject-
ive Support Subscale of Duke Social Support Index
(DSSI) [36], consist of items such as “How often do you
feel lonely?”, “Can you talk about your deepest prob-
lems?”, “I have friends with whom I can share joys and
sorrows”, which have a high degree of overlap with lone-
liness measures. Likewise, measures of confiding rela-
tionships assess the extent to which people feel close to
and able to talk intimately with other people [37, 38].
Studies have found large negative correlations between
loneliness and perceived social support [39–42]. Thus
these concepts resemble loneliness as subjective evalua-
tions of the quality and impact of social relationships:
given this conceptual overlap, this paper includes them
along with loneliness.
Three previous systematic reviews have explored the
relationship between social relations and depression in
general population [43, 44], or older adults [45], but in-
cluded both cross-sectional and prospective studies. One
further review looked at the relationship between social
networks and support and early psychosis in people with
first episode psychosis and in general population sam-
ples, but included no prospective studies [46]. To our
knowledge, there is no systematic review which summa-
rises and synthesises the evidence regarding the relation-
ship between loneliness and perceived social support
and the course of existing mental health problems, and
which includes only prospective studies, from which in-
ferences about the direction of causation may be drawn.
Our review will fill this gap, and will provide useful evi-
dence about how far and in what context loneliness and
perceived social support may influence mental health re-
covery. Thus the aim of the current paper is to

 synthesise the available evidence as to whether higher
levels of loneliness and poorer perceived social support
have an adverse effect on outcomes in adults of all ages
with existing mental health problems.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted of the scientific litera-
ture addressing the question of whether loneliness and low
perceived social support are associated longitudinally with
poorer outcomes among adults of all ages with a range of
mental health problems. The review’s protocol was regis-
tered on PROSPERO, which is an international database of
prospective systematic reviews with health related out-
comes (registration number: CRD42015014784) [47].
Inclusion criteria
Types of study: The review included longitudinal studies
in which the relationship between baseline measures of
loneliness and poor perceived social support and out-
comes at follow up was examined using quantitative
measures.
Participants: Participants in the included studies were
adults with mental illnesses, specifically schizophrenia
and schizoaffective disorder, psychosis in general, de-
pression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. Clinical
populations were included however diagnosis was made,
for example clinical diagnoses, ratings according to the
criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD), or use of reliable and valid instru-
ments such as the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (M.I.N.I.). We excluded studies with samples
of children under 16 years old, people with intellectual
disabilities or organic mental disorders including demen-
tia, or cohorts assembled on the basis of a primary phys-
ical illness diagnosis.
Exposure variables: Included studies used quantitative
measures of loneliness or of related concepts that in-
volve a subjective rather than objective appraisal of so-
cial relationships, such as perceived social support or
confiding relationships. Concepts based on objective rat-
ings of the size and functioning of social networks, such
as social isolation and social network size, were ex-
cluded. Social capital was also excluded as it relates to
characteristics of society or communities as a whole as
well as individuals’ appraisal of their relationships, and is
conceptually distinct from loneliness [32]. We included
studies only if exposure variables assessed subjective ap-
praisal of overall social connectedness, rather than the
quality of specific relationships: therefore, measures of
support from partner and quality of a specific significant
relationship were excluded.
Outcomes: The review included a wide variety of out-
comes, ranging from clinical outcomes to functioning
outcomes. Studies in which any of the following out-
comes were measured at follow-up were eligible for
inclusion:
1) Relapse: recurrent episodes following recovery at
baseline of mental illness meeting the criteria of
DSM or ICD, or of other reliable and valid
instruments such as the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and proxy
measures of acute relapse such as admission to
psychiatric hospital/crisis services/acute mental
health services.
2) Measures of functioning or of recovery: recovery of
function, social functioning, self-rated recovery,
quality of life, and disability.
3) Symptom severity: level of symptoms, symptom
improvement or deterioration.
4) Global outcome: overall outcome rating combining
different aspects of mental health and functioning,
such as the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales
(HoNOS).
Search strategy
A systematic search of the following six electronic data-
bases was undertaken: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase,
Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Library (1891
to April 2016). No language and publication period re-
strictions were applied. Search terms for loneliness and re-
lated concepts were combined with terms for mental
disorders and outcomes. Searches were conducted using
both subject headings (MeSH terms) and text words within
title and abstract. Search terms were adapted as required
for different databases (for full details, see Additional file 1).
The search terms used in Medline are as follows:
1) Loneliness: loneliness [MeSH] OR loneliness OR
lonely OR social support adj5 (subjective or
personal or perceived or quality) OR confiding
relationship*
2) Mental disorders: mental disorders [MeSH]. exp.
OR mental OR psychiatr* OR schizo* OR psychosis
OR psychotic OR depress* OR mania* OR manic
OR bipolar adj5 (disorder or disease or illness) OR
anxiety disorders [MeSH]. exp.
3) Outcomes: prognosis [MeSH] OR outcome* OR

hospitali?ation OR crisis OR admitted OR detained
OR detention OR recovery of function [MeSH] OR
“social functioning” OR “self-rated recovery” OR
“quality of life” OR “symptom severity” OR
disability
Apart from outcome terms, we searched “onset” and
related terms as searches were conducted simultaneously

 for this and a companion systematic review on loneliness
as a risk factor for the onset of psychiatric disorders in
the general population. Reference lists of studies identi-
fied through the electronic search for inclusion in the re-
view and of review articles were manually searched for
further relevant studies. Relevant studies reported in dis-
sertations, conference reports or other sources other
than published journals were searched using the free text
and keyword searches from the following two sources:
Zetoc (indexing and abstracting database of conference
proceedings) and OpenGrey (system for information on
grey literature in Europe). When necessary and possible,
we sent emails to authors to request full text or clarify
some uncertainties.
Selection of studies for inclusion in the review was
made independently by two reviewers (J.W. & F.M.). Ti-
tles of all identified studies were screened. The abstracts
of potentially relevant studies were read; the full text of
studies still considered potentially relevant was then re-
trieved and read. All studies included by one assessor
were confirmed by the other reviewer to check adher-
ence to inclusion criteria in study selection. 800 studies
excluded by one assessor were checked by the other re-
viewer to establish reliability of our study selection. The
agreement between reviewers was higher than 99%.
Queries about inclusion/exclusion were resolved through
discussion with a third reviewer (S.J.).
Data extraction, quality assessment and synthesis
A structured template was developed to extract relevant
data from eligible papers. Two review authors (J.W. &
F.M.) independently extracted data and assessed their
methodological quality. Extracted data and quality as-
sessment scores were checked by a second reviewer for
20% of papers. Disagreements between the two assessors
were resolved through discussion with a third review au-
thor (S.J.). The methodological quality of each study in-
cluded in the review was assessed using a standard form
adapted
from
the
Mixed
Methods
Appraisal
Tool
(MMAT) – Version 2011 [48]. The MMAT has been de-
signed for appraisal of the methodological quality for
qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies. For
quantitative studies it includes criteria relevant to rando-
mised controlled, non-randomised, and descriptive stud-
ies. For the purposes of our review, we used the criteria
for the quantitative non-randomised domain (Cohort
study version). As there are four criteria for this domain
following two screening questions, the overall quality
score was presented using descriptors *, **, ***, and ****,
ranging from * (one criterion met) to **** (all criteria
met). The four criteria related to selection bias, meas-
urement quality, adjustment for confounders, and per-
centage
of
complete
outcome
data/response
rate/
follow-up rate (see Additional file 2). We conducted a
narrative synthesis of results as the anticipated hetero-
geneity of included studies, for example in samples, pre-
dictor measures and outcomes, made a meta-analysis
inappropriate. The main results have been stratified by
type of mental health problem investigated and tables
and text were used to summarise the data.
Results
Literature search
Our initial database search retrieved 13,076 records (see
Fig. 1). After excluding duplicates and screening titles
and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant papers, 797
full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. 734 studies
were excluded because: i) they were not longitudinal
quantitative studies; ii) they assessed a form of social re-
lationships conceptually distinct from loneliness or per-
ceived social support; iii) they analysed the relationship
between change scores in loneliness and outcome vari-
ables, rather than baseline loneliness as a predictor of
outcome; or iv) they investigated a sample consisting of
children under 16 years old or of people with primary
diagnoses of drug and alcohol disorders, personality dis-
orders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), learning
disabilities or organic mental disorders, or of people re-
cruited as having specific physical illnesses. Twenty-two
further papers were retrieved by hand-searching the ref-
erence lists of the papers already identified. Of the
resulting 85 studies, 34 articles about outcomes of men-
tal disorders among people with existing mental health
problems were included in this review. The other 51 pa-
pers will be reported in a companion systematic review
regarding the relationship between loneliness and onset
of mental health problems in the general population.
The search results are reported as a Prisma diagram in
the Fig. 1.
Eligible papers
The 34 eligible papers were from seven countries, in-
cluding 23 from North America, 10 from Europe and
one from Israel. These papers consisted of 23 studies
with samples of people with depression, two focusing on
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, four on bipo-
lar disorder, and three on anxiety disorders. Two further
studies included people with a mixture of mental health
problems (Table 1). Only two studies directly assessed
loneliness, and most of the studies used various scales to
measure perceived social support. Nearly half of in-
cluded papers studied symptom severity as an outcome,
a third of the papers assessed recovery/remission, and a
third of the papers included other outcomes such as
quality of life, disability pension qualification, functional
impairment or life satisfaction. The sample sizes of six
studies in our review exceeded 400, 22 were between
100 and 400, and six were less than 100. Six studies had

 short length of follow-up (less than one year), 23 follow-
ing up the cohorts for one to two years, and five for over
two years. With regard to quality assessment, five studies
were assigned a maximum score of four (****) as their
overall quality scores, 16 studies had a score of three
(***) and 13 papers had two (**) according to the
appraisal criteria of MMAT. Most studies had lower
quality assessment ratings because they did not report
the percentage of complete outcome data, response rate
or follow-up rate (for full details, see Additional file 2).
Depression
Among the 23 papers with samples of people with de-
pression, 13 studies assessed depression severity as an
outcome. Eleven of these found that poorer perceived
social support or greater loneliness at baseline was a
significant predictor of higher depressive symptom se-
verity at follow-ups (Table 2). Nine of these eleven pa-
pers
conducted
multivariable
analyses
including
adjusting for baseline depression severity. In eight of
these nine papers, the relationship between baseline
loneliness and depressive symptom outcome remained
significant. For example, among the three studies with
high quality scores (****), Blazer and colleagues [49] and
Brugha and colleagues [50] followed cohorts of adults
with depression in America and the UK respectively.
They reported that poorer subjective social support at
baseline was predictive of poorer outcomes at follow-up,
outcomes including poorer life satisfaction (beta = 0.10,
B = 0.37), worse depressive symptoms (beta = 0.10, B =
0.30) [49], and more severe psychiatric status (regression
coefficient = − 1.46) [50]. In the third study rated as high

current depressive disorder at baseline, perceived social
support was not significantly related to remission.
Among patients without current depressive disorder at
baseline (subthreshold depression), patients with higher
level of perceived social support were less likely to
experience a new depressive episode during 2-year
period: odds ratio = 0.96 (CI:0.95, 0.98)

 quality, Leskela and colleagues [51] assessed adults with
major depressive disorder and found that lower per-
ceived social support six months after initial assessment
predicted more severe depression at 18 months among
all participants, although this relationship only remained
significant in multivariable analysis for the group who
had remitted following initial assessment (r = − 0.321).
The only study using loneliness as a predictor of depres-
sion outcomes was conducted by Holvast and colleagues
[25] among Dutch older adults. They found that a
1-point higher loneliness score was predictive of a
0.61-point higher depressive symptom severity score at
follow-up (Beta = 0.61, 95% CI 0.12–1.11). For studies
which reported beta as the effect size, beta ranged from
0.10 to 0.61. Among the 13 studies, three articles had
high quality (****), four had medium quality (***), and
the other six received low quality ratings (**). However,
no obvious relationship was found between study quality
and whether results were significant.
Six out of seven articles which used recovery/re-
mission of depression as their outcomes reported
lower perceived social support or higher loneliness
at baseline as a significant predictor of lower rates
of
recovery/remission
at
follow-up.
Three
of
the
seven studies adjusted for baseline depression sever-
ity, and all of them reported significant results. For
example, in the study of Holvast et al. [25], the
lonely respondents at baseline were reported to be
less likely to achieve remission from their depressive
disorder at follow-up compared with the non-lonely
respondents (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.08–0.80). Similarly,
poorer perceived social support at baseline was a
significant predictor of poorer recovery one year
later (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09–1.35) [52], and of lon-
ger
time-to-remission
in
a
study
of
initially
de-
pressed elderly individuals (Hazard Ratio = 0.47, 95%
CI 0.31–0.71) [53]. However, none of the seven stud-
ies had high quality scores (****), with five receiving
medium (***), and two low scores (**).
With regard to functional outcomes (five articles),
three studies have found that lower perceived social sup-
port at baseline was a significant predictor of greater
likelihood of being granted disability pensions during
the follow-up period (no effect size reported) [54, 55]
and of more severe functional disability (beta 0.210 to
0.215, 95% CI 0.084–0.393) [56]. There is also evidence
that greater perceived social support predicted better so-
cial and work adjustment (beta − 0.222 to − 0.303, 95%
CI -0.013 to − 0.006) [56], and buffered functional de-
clines in performance on activities of daily living (no ef-
fect size reported) [57]. However, after adjustment for
potential confounders only two [56, 57] of the five stud-
ies had significant results.
Schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders
Two studies assessed patients with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorders to identify psychosocial predic-
tors of health-related quality of life and functional out-
comes (Table 3). Ritsner and colleagues [58] followed a
sample of inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffec-
tive disorders for 16 months and found that greater sup-
port from friends at baseline predicted better satisfaction
with life quality after 16 months (accounted for 2.9% of
quality of life index scores at follow up examination). In
an American study, greater perceived social support was

ing domain (no effect size reported), although it did not
predict the global functioning score (a composite of vo-
cational and social functioning, and independent living)
[59].However, neither of these studies adjusted for the
outcome variable baseline scores.
Bipolar disorder
We found four papers that studied adults with a diagno-
sis of bipolar disorder (Table 4). The evidence regarding
depressive symptoms was consistent and showed that
lower perceived social support predicted greater depres-
sion over time (beta − 0.14 to − 0.25, regression coeffi-
cient − 1.33) [60–62]. Lower perceived support was also
found to be a significant predictor of greater impairment
in functioning (beta − 0.14 to − 0.67) [60, 61], and longer
time to recovery (no effect size reported) [62]. Among
remitted patients with prior diagnosis of bipolar I dis-
order, greater perceived social support reduced risk of
recurrence of any type (depressive or manic) at one year
(OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99) [63]. With regard to se-
verity of manic symptoms, however, the results were not
so consistent. In one study lower perceived support sig-
nificantly predicted more severe manic symptoms on
follow-up assessment (beta = − 0.32) [61], but in other
two studies it was not linked with subsequent manic
symptomatology [60, 62]. Apart from the study of
recurrence, the other three had adjustment for baseline
score on the outcome measure.
Anxiety disorders
The three studies of patients with anxiety disorders all re-
ported significant associations between perceived social
support at baseline and outcomes at follow-up (Table 5).
Two studies included people with diagnoses of generalised
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or
post-traumatic stress disorder. One study found that lower
perceived social support was predictive of more severe
anxiety (beta = − 0.15, CI [− 0.30, − 0.06], Ratios 8.85%)
and depressive symptoms (beta = − 0.16, CI [− 0.28, −
0.08], Ratios 10.51%) at subsequent time points [33], and
the other one found that greater perceived social support
predicted a higher rate of remission at 6-month follow-up
(OR = 1.38, 95% CI Wald 1.09–1.75) [64]. In a study of
older adults with generalised anxiety disorder, Shrestha et
al. [65] found that individuals with greater perceived social
support at baseline reported greater average quality of life
over time (beta = 0.41), albeit without adjustment for the
outcome variable baseline score.

follow-up. However, after adjustment for baseline severity
of depression or anxiety, only the relationship with de-
pression severity remained significant (beta = 0.39). Fleury
and colleagues [67] conducted a study among individuals
with severe mental health problems including schizophre-
nia and other psychotic disorders and severe mood disor-
ders. They reported that greater perceived social support
was significantly predictive of higher subjective quality of
life at 18 months (beta 0.136 to 0.196, 95% CI 0.255 to

cluded functional ability in the community and diagnosis,
but not baseline quality of life.
Discussion
Main findings
We found 34 studies that reported quantitatively on the
longitudinal relationship between perceived social sup-
port/loneliness at baseline and various outcomes of
mental illness at follow-up. Although substantial hetero-
geneity exists in the identified articles, some generalisa-
tions can be made. There is substantial evidence that
less perceived social support at baseline tends to predict
greater symptom severity, poorer recovery/remission
and worse functional outcomes at follow-up among
people with depression, and preliminary evidence of a
similar relationship for people with bipolar disorder, or
anxiety disorders. There is also some evidence that

 depression and anxiety symptoms and poorer remission
from depression. An important consideration in inter-
preting findings is that depression is very likely to make
people more likely to appraise their social support as in-
adequate and to feel emotionally lonely. However, a per-
sistent effect on outcomes is found in many studies with
adjustment for baseline depression severity. With regard
to schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders, only func-
tional outcomes have been studied and the small
amount of available evidence suggests that greater per-
ceived social support is predictive of better subjective
quality of life and social functioning. This review, to our
knowledge, is the first to systematically examine longitu-
dinal studies regarding the relationship between loneli-
ness and closely related concepts and outcomes for
adults of all ages and all types of mental illness.
Strengths and limitations of the included studies and of
this review
Generally, the quality of included studies is acceptable
and most studies were assigned at least *** as their over-
all quality scores in accordance with the methodological
quality criteria of MMAT. However, some methodo-
logical issues in the published literature may limit what
can be inferred from the studies. Many studies did not
have comprehensive information about percentage of
complete outcome data, baseline response rate, or
follow-up rate, resulting in lower quality assessment rat-
ings. We did assess whether studies adjusted for baseline
measurements on the outcomes. Some did not, increas-
ing uncertainty about the direction of causation (al-
though if the baseline outcome measure which included
random errors was introduced as a covariate, regression
to the mean might lead to biased results according to
Lord’s paradox [68]). A large majority of the 23 studies
that did adjust for baseline outcome measures still found
loneliness/perceived social support to be predictive of
outcomes. This suggests that there is a real effect of
loneliness/lack of social support on outcomes. However,
it is likely that the relationship can be a circular one,
with loneliness/lack of social support resulting in more
severe symptoms, and more severe symptoms exacerbat-
ing loneliness/lack of social support.
The consistency of findings across a variety of settings,
measures of the exposure, and population groups in-
creases confidence in the generalisability of the review’s
findings. The retrieved articles encompassed varying
populations including older and younger groups, and
people recruited in primary care, inpatient and out-
patient settings, and were carried out around the world.
Most
studies
of
perceived
social
support
used
well-developed scales where psychometric properties
have been established. The measures used varied regard-
ing the dimensions and types of social support assessed,
although they all measure individuals’ subjective ap-
praisal of adequacy or impact of their relationships ra-
ther than objective or structural social support. Both
loneliness studies used a published measure of loneliness
with well-established psychometric properties, but this
review shows that knowledge about the relationship be-
tween loneliness and outcomes of mental health prob-
lems is still very limited. Finally, the studies in our
review had sample sizes ranging from 42 to 1004, and
diverse follow-up periods from a few months to ten
years. The sample size of most studies is under 400 with
less than 100 participants in six articles. However, the
consistency of positive findings from included studies, ir-
respective of their sample size, provides some confidence
that studies were not underpowered.
Other limitations of this review relate to the search
strategy. Although our literature search was conducted
in six databases and a variety of search terms were ap-
plied, the search might not be exhaustive. Some relevant
studies may have been missed if they did not use “sub-
jective or personal or perceived or quality” five or fewer
words apart from “social support”. Some very old papers
might not be indexed in electronic databases, and thus
cannot be searched. Eligible studies are only from seven
countries and most of them were conducted in North
America. Very few papers in other languages were re-
trieved and none of them could be included in our re-
view, although we did search for them and read their
abstracts. It is also worth noting that the extent of any
reporting bias is uncertain as studies which did not find
a positive result might not be published. Another limita-
tion refers to the scope of our review. We restricted the
search to the most common mental disorders, including
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, psychosis in
general, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disor-
ders. The associations between loneliness and perceived
social support and other mental health problems need
further investigation. Additionally, we focused on one
direction of causation only: the effect of baseline loneli-
ness and poor perceived social support on mental health
outcomes at follow up. Psychiatric symptoms probably
also influence loneliness and perceived social support,
but this was not the research question on which we fo-
cused in this review.
Research implications
Most studies included in our review focused on depres-
sion, with other types of mental health problems repre-
sented by fewer than five studies each. Nevertheless,
some significant relationships have been found between
loneliness and/or perceived social support and outcomes
of those mental disorders. Gayer-Anderson and Morgan
[46] systematically examined evidence on social net-
works and social support in early psychosis. They found
Wang et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:156 
Page 12 of 16
 some tentative evidence that deficits in social networks
and support preceded the onset of psychosis, but it was
difficult to disentangle direction of causation as almost
all the studies included were cross-sectional and they
did not report whether social relationships influence
outcomes of psychosis. Given that the prevalence of
loneliness in people with psychosis was comparable to
that in people with depression, it is surprising that re-
search about impact of loneliness/perceived social sup-
port on psychosis is scarce. Similarly, social relationships
were shown to be related to bipolar disorder and anxiety
disorders, but there is a lack of evidence to discern cause
and effect [69, 70]. Therefore more systematic explor-
ation is needed about how loneliness and perceived so-
cial support affect conditions such as psychosis, bipolar
disorder and anxiety disorders.
Additionally, more longitudinal research with long-term
follow-up (and repeated measures) is essential to untangle
the direction of effect in the relationship between loneli-
ness/perceived social support and poor outcomes. Among
the
34 eligible studies
only
five articles involve
a
long-term follow-up period (over 2 years). Thus there is a
need to establish the longer term associations of loneliness
and perceived social support. As well its effects on longer
term mental health outcomes, loneliness may contribute
to the adverse physical health outcomes and increased
mortality of people with severe mental health problems.
We also found that the relationship between perceived
social support and depression was studied far more often
and is thus far more clearly established than the rela-
tionship between loneliness and depression. Only two
studies retrieved for our review included loneliness as an
independent variable for outcomes of mental disorders.
They found that loneliness at baseline predicted depres-
sion and anxiety severity and remission from depression
[25, 66]. However, the few longitudinal studies of loneli-
ness do not allow definitive conclusions. Therefore more
longitudinal research is needed in clinical samples to try
to achieve a clear understanding of the impact of loneli-
ness on the course of mental health problems.
Clinical and policy implications
There are a number of clinical and policy implications from
the finding that poor perceived social support has a signifi-
cant impact on outcomes in depression. Firstly, it highlights
the need to pay sufficient attention to the social relationships
and social support needs of people with mental health prob-
lems. Social activities, or thinking about relationships, can be
overlooked in clinical consultations – in favour of medica-
tions or psychological therapies, and there have been recent
calls to raise the profile of social factors in mental health care
and mental health research [16]. Raising practitioners’ aware-
ness of the beneficial effects of good perceived social support
on symptoms, recovery, and functioning is an important first
step, but also promoting awareness amongst service users
and the wider public – so that people may feel more moti-
vated to seek relevant help or to try to change their own situ-
ation, particularly in depression but probably in other mental
health problems studied too.
The development of effective interventions to promote
social support and reduce loneliness is required to ad-
dress the current evidence gap, manifested by the ab-
sence of recommendations in this important social
domain in current policy guidance. In the UK for ex-
ample, the National Health Service (NHS) Five Year For-
ward View [71] refers to a series of plans to improve the
quality of mental health services and reduce ‘burden’ on
the NHS. Access to psychological therapies, waiting
standards and better physical healthcare are highlighted
but there is no specific mention of managing the signifi-
cant problems of loneliness or limited social relation-
ships.
International
evidence
that
poor
perceived
support from social relationships leads to increased ser-
vice use and poorer outcomes across a range of diagnos-
tic groups should inform future policy in this area. Also
in the UK, the latest National Institute for Clinical Ex-
cellence (NICE) guidance on illnesses such as depression
and schizophrenia, does not recommend social interven-
tions apart from employment support [72, 73].
Clinicians may doubt whether loneliness and limited
support from interpersonal relationships are appropriate
or feasible as targets for intervention. However, potential
interventions are becoming available in a variety of sec-
tors. Around the world, approaches are being developed
to try to reduce loneliness among older people in the gen-
eral population, with potential to be adapted to other
groups in the population at risk of adverse effects from
poor social support. In the UK, a variety of approaches to
social relationships and social participation are being de-
veloped primarily in the charitable sector and in primary
care [74]. Social prescribing projects have proliferated in
the UK in recent years [75]. Social prescribing is not pre-
cisely defined, but typically refers to: navigation - the
process of linking support for people to access community
activities helpful to wellbeing and participation; and/or
funding and providing these activities in a community or
group setting [76]. As yet however, social prescribing
models are numerous and poorly defined [75], and there
is a lack of robust evidence regarding their effectiveness
[76]. Psychological approaches, such as Cognitive Behav-
ioural Therapy and Mindfulness, have also been used to
help people change their thinking about social relation-
ships: some promising results have been reported, espe-
cially with older adult populations [77]. Thus there are
approaches available with potential to be adapted and
tested for people with mental health problems, to try to al-
leviate the adverse effects identified in this paper. There is
Wang et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:156 
Page 13 of 16
 also a need to consider public understanding of the im-
portance of nurturing social relationships, as the high
prevalence of loneliness is not only an individual but ne-
cessarily also a community and societal level problem.
Thus people with mental health problems, like other
groups in the population who are vulnerable to the effects
of loneliness, are likely to benefit from an approach to
loneliness that also takes account of community resources
and how they might be enhanced [78].
Conclusions
This systematic review has identified prospective studies in
the area of loneliness/perceived social support and outcomes
of mental health problems. We found substantial evidence
that in depression, poorer perceived social support is associ-
ated with poorer outcomes in terms of symptoms, recovery
and functioning. There is some preliminary evidence of a
similar relationship in bipolar and anxiety disorders, and of a
relationship between greater perceived social support and
better quality of life and functioning in schizophrenia. Loneli-
ness and its impact on mental health outcomes are still insuf-
ficiently addressed compared to perceived social support, but
there is some evidence that greater loneliness is related to
more severe depression and anxiety symptoms and poorer
remission from depression. Further research, including
long-term follow-up and repeated measures, is required to
longitudinally investigate the direction of effect between lone-
liness/perceived social support and poor mental health out-
comes among service users from different diagnostic groups.
There is also a case, especially in depression, for raising pub-
lic awareness of the importance of reducing public health,
and for developing, testing and implementing strategies to
improve perceived social support and reduce loneliness in
people with mental health problems.
