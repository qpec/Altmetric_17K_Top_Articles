National Preparedness Month —  
September 2016
Throughout September, CDC and approximately 3,000 
global, national, regional, and local government organi-
zations, as well as private and public institutions, will 
promote the importance of being ready for emergencies 
(1–3). For Preparedness Month 2016, CDC’s Office of 
Public Health Preparedness and Response will focus on 
the power of preparedness globally and locally and actions 
that can be taken collectively and individually (1).
Being prepared saves lives. Public health emergencies might 
take the shape of an emerging or rapidly spreading disease, a 
natural disaster, or an act of bioterrorism. While the nature, 
timing, and location of the next threat cannot be anticipated, 
developing programs to prevent, detect, and respond to public 
health emergencies can mitigate the impact of the unknown 
(2). Persons can take action now by having a family reunifica-
tion plan and an emergency kit with basic supplies, medicines, 
and local emergency telephone numbers.
During preparedness month, CDC’s Public Health Matters 
blog (3) will feature stories about how countries are partner-
ing to advance health security, how emergencies prompt 
innovation and training, how states respond to new disease 
threats, and how every person plays a powerful role in pro-
tecting our communities and families. Preparedness Month 
will include infographics, social media, and a Twitter chat 
on September 27 @CDCEmergency. The month culmi-
nates with National PrepareAthon! Day on September 30.

The unique characteristics of children dictate the need for 
school-based all-hazards response plans during natural disas-
ters, emerging infectious diseases, and terrorism (1–3). Schools 
are a critical community institution serving a vulnerable popu-
lation that must be accounted for in public health preparedness 
plans; prepared schools are adopting policies and plans for crisis 
preparedness, response, and recovery (2–4). The importance of 
having such plans in place is underscored by the development

of a new Healthy People 2020 objective (PREP-5) to “increase 
the percentage of school districts that require schools to include 
specific topics in their crisis preparedness, response, and recov-
ery plans” (5). Because decisions about such plans are usually 
made at the school district level, it is important to examine 
district-level policies and practices. Although previous reports 
have provided national estimates of the percentage of districts 
with policies and practices in place (6), these estimates have not 
been analyzed by U.S. Census region* and urbanicity.† Using 
data from the 2012 School Health Policies and Practices Study 
(SHPPS), this report examines policies and practices related to 
school district preparedness, response, and recovery. In general, 
districts in the Midwest were less likely to require schools to 
include specific topics in their crisis preparedness plans than 
districts in the Northeast and South. Urban districts tended 
to be more likely than nonurban districts to require specific 
topics in school preparedness plans. Southern districts tended 
to be more likely than districts in other regions to engage with 
partners when developing plans. No differences in district 
collaboration (with the exception of local fire department 
engagement) were observed by level of urbanicity. School-based 
preparedness planning needs to be coordinated with interdis-
ciplinary community partners to achieve Healthy People 2020 
PREP-5 objectives for this vulnerable population.
SHPPS is a national survey conducted every 6 years by 
CDC to assess school health policies and practices at state, 
district, school, and classroom levels. This report uses school 
district–level data from the 2012 survey (6). A two-stage 
sample design was used to generate a nationally representative 
sample of public school districts in the United States. Seven 
district-level questionnaires (each assessing different aspects 
of school policies and practices) were administered in each 
sampled district; this report provides results from the healthy 
and safe school environment questionnaire. Respondents were 
asked whether their school district required schools to have a 
comprehensive plan to address crisis preparedness, response, 
and recovery that included four specific topics identified in 
PREP-5: family reunification procedures, procedures for 
responding to pandemic influenza or other infectious disease 
outbreaks, provisions for students and staff members with spe-
cial needs, and provision of mental health services for students

and staff members after a crisis. Respondents also were asked 
whether the district collaborated with specified categories of 
partners (e.g., local fire department or local mental health or 
social services agency) in developing crisis preparedness plans.
A single respondent identified by the district as the most 
knowledgeable on the topic responded to each questionnaire 
module. During October 2011–August 2012, respondents 
completed questionnaires via a secure data collection website 
or paper-based questionnaires. Among eligible districts, 697 
(66.5%) completed the healthy and safe school environment 
questionnaire. Additional data regarding SHPPS methods are 
available online (6). Data were weighted to provide national 
estimates and analyzed using statistical software that accounted 
for the complex sample design. School districts were catego-
rized by geographic location into one of the four U.S. Census 
regions (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) and by level of 
urbanicity (urban or nonurban). Prevalence estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals were computed for all point estimates. 
Significant differences were evaluated by census region and 
urbanicity by t-test, with significance set at p<0.05.
District requirements for school plans varied by specific topic 
and region, ranging from 87.8% in the South for provisions 
for students and staff members with special needs to 57.9% 
in the Midwest for procedures for responding to pandemic 
influenza or other infectious disease outbreaks (Table 1). 
Overall, 79.9% of school districts required provisions for 
students and staff members with special needs; 67.8% required 
plans that addressed family reunification procedures, 69.0% 
required procedures for responding to pandemic influenza or 
other infectious disease outbreaks, and 69.3% required plans 
for provision of mental health services for students, faculty, 
and staff members after a crisis. For all four of the topics, the 
percentage of school districts requiring schools to address the 
topic was lowest in the Midwest.
By urbanicity, on average, urban districts required schools to 
include more of the four topics in their preparedness plans than 
did nonurban districts (3.1 versus 2.7 specific topics, p<0.05). 
Urban districts also were significantly (p<0.05) more likely than 
nonurban districts to require schools to include family reunifica-
tion, provisions for students and staff members with special needs, 
and provision of mental health services in their plans (Table 1).
Analysis of responses regarding district collaboration 
with community partners found differences in practices for 
preparedness planning by census region, although only one 
significant difference was found by urbanicity (Table 2). 
Across all districts, >90% worked with 1) staff members from 
individual schools within the district, 2) local fire departments, 
and 3) local law enforcement agencies. In contrast, 16.6% of 
districts (range = 12.0%–20.8%) worked with a local public 
transportation department§ (Table 2).

Discussion
Children represent approximately one fourth of the U.S. 
population and are separated from their caregivers while attend-
ing school. They have unique physiological, psychological, and 
developmental attributes that make them at heightened risk 
during disasters (1–3). Particular challenges for school-based 
preparedness are planning for children with special needs (e.g., 
disabilities or functional or medical needs), chronic conditions, 
or limited English proficiency (1,2,4,7). Effective readiness 
can be hampered by compartmentalized planning that over-
looks the unique vulnerabilities of children in and following 
public health disasters (8). Broader community participation 
in school-based disaster planning can ensure that relevant 
stakeholders have a common framework and understanding 
to support response and recovery following a disaster.
Although SHPPS found that more than two thirds of districts 
require schools to include specified topics in their crisis plans, 
these requirements do not necessarily exist at the state level. 
A 2014 National Report Card evaluated state-level standards 
for preparedness planning for children and found that only 
29 states met the basic standards for safety of children during 
an event (9). However, the National Report Card focused 
primarily on disaster planning standards for children in child 
care facilities with only one standard specific to K-12. A state 
level approach to disaster preparedness planning is needed for 
both child care facilities and schools.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, the “yes or no” responses do not provide insight 
into the relevance of the specific topics in the preparedness 
plan or whether plans were exercised or evaluated to identify 
areas for improvement. Second, SHPPS data are collected every 
6 years, and the most recent district data are from 2012. It is 
possible that some districts have updated their policies and 
practices related to preparedness since the data were collected. 
Finally, SHPPS data are self-reported and as such there might 
be opportunity for misclassification because of respondent 
interpretation of a particular question.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Practical Information 
on Crisis Planning: a Guide for Schools and Communities rec-
ommends that school crisis plans be developed in partnership 
with other community stakeholders (4). In this report, per-
centages of districts collaborating with school staff members 
and law enforcement, fire department, and emergency medi-
cal services were high across all census regions and levels of 
urbanicity, although other partnerships need improvement. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that additional 
efforts are needed to address deficiencies in partner engage-
ment for school disaster planning and to address the unique 
vulnerabilities of children (3). School-based and community-
based preparedness planning, training, exercises, and drills to 
improve emergency response, recovery, and overall community 
resilience are needed (7).
National and district-specific information on school crisis 
preparedness planning is required to identify and address critical 
gaps in preparedness, response, and recovery policies and plans 
for children. Findings from this report can strengthen school 
and community preparedness through multi-organizational, 
transdisciplinary partnerships engaged in preparedness 
planning (7). Disaster planning is a shared responsibility 
(2). The Children and Youth Task Force, Office of Human 
Services Emergency Preparedness and Response, is promoting 
a coordinated planning approach involving governmental and 
nongovernmental organizations and health care providers to 
improve outcomes and minimize the consequences of disasters 
on this vulnerable population (7).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Children represent nearly one fourth of the U.S. population, 
have unique vulnerabilities, and might be in a school setting, 
separated from families, when a disaster occurs. The U.S. 
Department of Education recommends that schools develop 
and exercise crisis preparedness plans in collaboration with 
community partners.
What is added by this report?
Data from the 2012 School Health Policies and Practices Study 
indicated that 79.9% of school districts required schools to have 
a comprehensive plan that includes provisions for students and 
staff members with special needs, whereas 67.8% to 69.3% of 
districts required plans that addressed family reunification 
procedures, procedures for responding to pandemic influenza 
or other infectious disease outbreaks, and provision of mental 
health services for students, faculty, and staff members, after a 
crisis. On average, urban districts required schools to include 
more of the four selected topics in their plans than nonurban 
districts. Across all districts, >90% collaborated on plans with 
staff members from individual schools within the district, local
