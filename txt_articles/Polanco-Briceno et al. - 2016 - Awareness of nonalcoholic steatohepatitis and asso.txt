steatohepatitis and associated practice patterns 
of primary care physicians and specialists

Abstract 
Background: The hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Patients with non‑
alcoholic steatohepatitis, the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, have increased risk of fibrosis, cirrho‑
sis and end‑stage liver disease. Estimates of prevalence in the United States range from 20–30 % for nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease and 2–5 % for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; however, physician awareness of these diseases is limited. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the current level of physician awareness and practices in the diagnosis and 
management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis within the United States.
Methods: Physicians were asked to participate in an online, 35‑question survey about their awareness of various liver 
conditions and current practices.
Results: Of the 302 responding physicians, 152 were primary care physicians, and 150 were specialists (comprised of 
gastroenterologists and hepatologists). More specialists than primary care physicians reported that they were aware 
of the differences between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (p < 0.001) and that they 
routinely screened for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (p < 0.001) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (p < 0.001). Almost 
half of the responding primary care physicians reported being unfamiliar with the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis differences even though they were aware of both, yet 58 % of those primary care 
physicians were treating patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In addition, 
those primary care physicians who reported being unfamiliar with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were treating an aver‑
age of 3.7 patients and reported being as likely as familiar primary care physicians to treat new patients with nonal‑
coholic steatohepatitis. More than half of the specialists used noninvasive diagnostic test to confirm nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis, and 10 % of the specialists reported treating patients with drugs not recommended by the current 
guidelines.
Conclusions: Despite reporting they were not familiar with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary care physicians 
reported they would likely continue to diagnose and manage patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; therefore, 
more physician education on the recent practice guideline for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic stea‑
tohepatitis is needed.

Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increas-
ingly recognized as a major health burden in developed 
countries. It includes a spectrum of liver damage rang-
ing from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH), advanced fibrosis, and rarely, progression to cir-
rhosis [1]. In 2013, NASH became the second leading eti-
ology of chronic liver disease among new liver transplant 
waitlist registrations [2]. A systematic review estimated

the prevalence in the United States is about 33 % for 
NAFLD and 2–5 % for NASH [3]. The most recent diag-
nosis and management guidelines for NAFLD and NASH 
were published in 2012 [1]. Although it is widely accepted 
that a liver biopsy is the gold standard for the detection 
of NASH, but that it is impractical, unnecessary and cost 
prohibitive to perform a liver biopsy among all patients 
with NAFLD [4], no consensus has been reached in 
identifying specific biomarkers as an alternative for the 
diagnosing and monitoring of NAFLD-related liver dis-
ease [5]. Thus, clinical practice patterns in the diagnos-
ing of NASH frequently diverge from published practice 
guidelines [6]. The lack of practical guidelines is particu-
larly important among primary care physicians given the 
association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
to conditions frequently seen by these physicians, such 
as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and overall metabolic risk 
factors [1, 7, 8]. Indeed, existing data suggest there is lim-
ited awareness among general practitioners of NAFLD 
and its progressive form nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) [9–12].
In 2012, the American Association for the Study 
of Liver Disease, American College of Gastroenter-
ology and the American Gastroenterological Asso-
ciation published a practice guideline for NAFLD 
and NASH [1]. More recently, two abstracts reported 
on the current practices of diagnosing and treating 
NASH and NAFLD using the guideline [13, 14]. Even 
though liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnos-
ing NASH, responding physicians indicated that 39 % 
of their NASH-diagnosed patients had not had a liver 
biopsy [13], and fewer than 25 % of physician respond-
ents said they routinely performed a liver biopsy to 
diagnose NASH [14]. In addition, 53 % of physicians 
mentioned prescribing vitamin E for NASH treatment 
[14], even though the guideline indicates it should not 
be used without a liver biopsy [1], and 50 % mentioned 
prescribing metformin for some patients specifically 
to treat NASH [13] while the guidelines do not recom-
mend its use for treating NASH [1].
Familiarity with position statements and/or the prac-
tice guideline for NAFLD or NASH may also affect 
NASH management. Kallman et al. [15] found that PCPs 
were less likely than gastroenterologists or hepatologists 
to be familiar with the American Association for the 
Study of Liver Diseases position paper on NAFLD and 
were more likely to defer to the American Association of 
Family Practice guideline. This study, however, was com-
pleted prior to the release of the practice guideline for the 
diagnosis and management of NAFLD in 2012 [1], and no 
studies have yet to be reported on whether knowledge of 
the practice guideline has improved confidence in treat-
ing these patients.
The prevalence of NAFLD and NASH also varies 
depending on the method of detection and popula-
tion being studied. Using data from the United States 
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III) study, overall prevalence of NAFLD 
excluding NASH was 16.4 % and the prevalence of NASH 
was 3.1 % [16]; but, the authors diagnosed NASH based 
on increased liver enzymes in the presence of moderate-
to-severe hepatic steatosis in the absence of antibodies 
to hepatitis B and C and without evidence of iron over-
load [16]. A systematic review estimated the prevalence 
in the United States is about 33 % for NAFLD and 2–5 % 
for NASH [3]. However, these estimates were based on 
studies with small cohorts. In a prospective study using 
ultrasound as an initial screening tool and biopsy confir-
mation, Williams et al. [17] found that 46 % had NAFLD 
and 12.2 % had NASH in a cohort of active duty person-
nel and their families. They also found a higher preva-
lence of NAFLD and NASH among patients with diabetes 
(74 and 22.2 %, respectively) in this cohort [17]. Because 
of the need for liver biopsy to confirm a NASH diagnosis 
[1], prevalence estimates for NASH in the general popu-
lation seem to be underestimated.
Together, these studies suggest that because of the 
increasing prevalence of obesity and underdiagnosing 
of related conditions such as NAFLD and NASH, there 
is a need for more accurate diagnosis and proper man-
agement of NAFLD. However, awareness and knowledge 
about NAFLD and NASH continues to be a concern that 
directly impacts diagnosing practices, and therefore lim-
its our ability to accurately estimate the prevalence of 
NAFLD and NASH. Several recent studies have exam-
ined awareness and knowledge of NAFLD and/or NASH 
among different groups of healthcare workers. An Italian 
study of 56 general practitioners revealed 70 % underes-
timated the prevalence of NAFLD, and when asked only 
65 % could indicate the definition of NAFLD was fatty 
degeneration of hepatocytes in patients with an altered 
glucose or lipid metabolism [12]. Wieland et al. showed 
that physicians, particularly PCPs, and specialists other 
than gastroenterologists and hepatologists within a pri-
marily urban setting within the western United States 
had a low rate of recognition of NAFLD as a clinically rel-
evant disease regarding its propensity for progression to 
chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and its associated mor-
bidity and mortality [9]. They also showed that diagnostic 
and management approaches to patients with NAFLD 
were highly variable and deviated significantly from prac-
tice guidelines, indicating an overreliance on aminotrans-
ferase levels specifically to screen for NAFLD. Finally, 
they suggested that providers underutilized data-driven 
treatment modalities and also had low rates of referral 
to gastroenterology and hepatology subspecialists when

presented with a patient with multiple metabolic risk fac-
tors and a high likelihood of having NASH histology.
In a more recent study among various specialists in a 
metropolitan area of Brisbane, Australia, Bergqvist et al. 
suggested that 75 % underestimated the prevalence of 
NAFLD in the general population and 89 % in high-risk 
populations, 57 % considered alcohol consumption to 
be strongly associated with NAFLD, 60 % believed sim-
ple steatosis was associated with increased liver related 
mortality, 66 % thought NASH could be diagnosed with 
liver imaging, and 71 % made no referrals to GIs/Heps 
for suspected NAFLD (due in part to the local health-
care system) [10]. Finally, the most recent study by Said 
et al. in 2013 among physicians in Wisconsin showed lack 
of confidence in PCPs’ knowledge about NAFLD and 
its management was the top barrier in treating patients 
with NAFLD. They also showed that, even among physi-
cians treating high risk populations (e.g., obese, diabet-
ics), more than half of primary care practitioners did not 
screen for NAFLD. The majority (84 %) also underes-
timated prevalence of NAFLD in the general and obese 
population [11].
To obtain a better understanding of awareness of and 
familiarity with NAFLD and NASH within an unselected 
group of primary care physicians within the United 
States, we developed and administered a nation-wide 
survey to primary care physicians and specialists. Addi-
tionally, we aimed to understand how levels of familiar-
ity related to (1) current management of patients with 
NASH, (2) future plans for self-management or referral 
of patients with NASH, (3) and specific screening and 
diagnosing practices for NASH.
Methods
Survey design
A national online survey was developed and adminis-
tered. United States licensed physicians were invited by 
mail to participate in a 15 min, online national survey. 
Given the purpose of this study was to determine the 
current level of physician awareness, familiarity, and 
practices in the diagnosis and management of NAFLD 
and NASH, the topic of the survey mentioned on the 
invitation was generalized to various liver conditions. 
Awareness of NAFLD and NASH was calculated among 
all physicians who entered the screener prior to having 
any knowledge of the purpose of the study, aside from the 
invitation of the study specifying it was a “national study 
about various conditions”
. Specifically, physicians were 
first asked which of 11 different liver conditions they 
were aware of, including NAFLD, NASH, seven other 
liver conditions, and two sham conditions (included as 
a quality check). Respondents who indicated they were 
aware of either NAFLD and/or NASH and indicated they 
were willing to provide accurate responses to questions 
about their professional experiences qualified for the 
remainder of the survey. It was assumed that participa-
tion in this survey was random and represented basic 
interest and knowledge in liver conditions. No physician 
data were excluded from analysis based on their response 
to the screener questions.
Ethics, consent and permissions
Physicians were offered an industry-standard hono-
rarium for their time to complete the survey. By opting 
into to the survey, the respondents provided consent 
to use their anonymized responses to the survey ques-
tions. The study did not collect protected private health 
information, and it was deemed unnecessary to undergo 
IRB review according to national regulations [18, 19]. 
All survey research conducted for this article was done 
in accordance with the ethics practices outlined by the 
Council of American Survey Research Organizations 
(CASRO) [18].
Survey and data collection
The survey was live from May 6, 2015 to June 4, 2015, and 
was comprised of 35 quantitative and qualitative ques-
tions. Quantitative questions asked about the following 
topics: awareness and routine screening of NAFLD and 
NASH (among various other liver conditions), the level 
of familiarity with the differences between NAFLD and 
NASH, current volume of patients managed for NAFLD 
and NASH, as well as detailed diagnosing and referral 
practices. Additional questions included awareness of 
new therapies in development for NASH and what they 
have heard about each. Qualitative questions asked about 
perceived differences between NAFLD and NASH, how 
physicians routinely screen for NASH and what specifi-
cally prompts them to refer patients to other physicians 
for NASH treatment, and how they currently manage 
their patients with NASH. The survey also contained a 
short demographic section that asked them to provide 
their gender, the number of years in practice, and the 
location and the setting of their practice.
Data analysis
The individual identities of physician survey respondents 
were blinded to the study authors. All survey data were 
analyzed in the aggregate. Responses to the closed ques-
tions were analyzed quantitatively. All respondents who 
qualified for each qualitative question provided com-
ments, because these sections of the survey were manda-
tory. Responses to the open-ended questions were coded 
into pre-selected categories before analysis. A response 
that addressed multiple categories was counted as multi-
ple comments. SPSS Version 20 was used. All continuous

variables were analyzed using Student’s t test. All cat-
egorical variables for which the expected cell frequencies 
were greater than five were analyzed using the Pearson 
Chi square test. A Fisher’s exact test was used whenever 
the expected cell frequencies were five or less. P values of 
less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Survey population and responding physician 
demographics
A total of 8119 physicians who specialized in family or 
internal medicine (hereafter referred to as PCPs), 5920 
gastroenterologists, and 238 hepatologists (hereafter 
referred to as specialists) were randomly selected from 
the universe of 250,838 PCPs, 14,125 gastroenterolo-
gists, and 238 hepatologists, based on the CMS National 
Plan and Provider Enumeration System. Out of the 354 
physicians who entered the screener, 348 completed the 
screener. Of these 348, 344 identified themselves within 
our specialties of interest: 185 were PCPs, 128 were gas-
troenterologists, 31 were hepatologists, and 4 were spe-
cialties other than those of interest. A total of 152 PCPs, 
121 gastroenterologists, and 29 hepatologists completed 
the screener and the remainder of the survey. All physi-
cians who completed the screener questions qualified 
for the survey. This includes an additional 42 physicians 
(33 PCPs, 7 gastroenterologists, and 2 hepatologists) 
who completed the screener, but had not completed 
the survey at the time the data were analyzed. A com-
parison of the regional distribution of responding physi-
cians (Table 1) was made with the regional distribution 
of the universe of PCPs and specialists, as determined 
by the region by state distribution designated by the 
Census Bureau. No significant difference between the 
regional breakout of the PCPs in our sample and that of 
the universe of PCPs was found (P = 0.080). Similarly, no 
difference between the regional breakout of the special-
ists in our sample and that of the universe of specialists 
was found (P = 0.502).
At the time of the survey, the responding PCPs had 
been practicing for a mean of 14.4 years (SD = 10.96). 
PCPs primarily worked in a group practice (41 %), and 
the majority practiced in either urban (32 %) or subur-
ban (44 %) locations. Only 28 % of the PCPs were affili-
ated with an academic institution (Table 2). A total of 150 
specialists (121 gastroenterologists and 29 hepatologists) 
completed the survey. The specialists were in practice for 
a mean of 16.7 years (SD = 10.69), and 126 (84 %) were 
male.
Compared with PCPs, more specialists were male 
(P < 0.001), but no difference in length of time in prac-
tice was detected between the two groups (P = 0.087, 
Table 2). Differences in practice setting (P < 0.001) and 
practice location (P < 0.001) were identified. More spe-
cialists worked in a group practice (62 %) and fewer 
worked in clinics (1 %). Fewer specialists than PCPs prac-
ticed in rural areas (6 vs. 24 %, respectively).
Awareness of and familiarity with NAFLD and NASH
Awareness of NAFLD and NASH was calculated among 
all physicians who entered the screener prior to having 
any knowledge of the purpose of the study, aside from 
the invitation of the study specifying it was a “national 
study about various conditions”
. Specifically, physicians 
were first asked which of 11 different liver conditions 
they were aware of, including NAFLD, NASH, seven 
other liver conditions, and two sham conditions. Among 
the 344 physicians within our specialties of interest who 
completed the screener, 100 % indicated they were aware 
of NAFLD, NASH, or both. Respondents who indi-
cated they were aware of NAFLD and NASH were then 
asked to indicate their familiarity with the differences

between NAFLD and NASH. Among these, 49 % of the 
PCPs chose either not familiar or unaware of differences 
between NAFLD and NASH. The majority of specialists 
(88 %) selected extremely or very familiar with the differ-
ences between NAFLD and NASH. 11 % reported they 
were somewhat familiar with the differences, and 1 % 
indicated that they were not familiar with or unaware of 
these differences (Table 3). The rest indicated they were 
somewhat familiar with the differences. Compared with 
PCPs, specialists were significantly more likely to report 
they were familiar with the differences between NAFLD 
and NASH (P < 0.001). More specialists reported that 
they routinely screened for NASH (71 vs. 53 %; P < 0.001) 
and NAFLD (77 vs 56 %; P < 0.001, Table 3). There was no 
effect of length of time in practice on familiarity between 
PCPs and specialists.
When asked to specifically describe the differences 
between NAFLD and NASH, more PCPs than special-
ists reported that they thought NAFLD and NASH were 
the same disease (9 vs. 0 %, P = 0.001). PCPs were more 
likely than specialists to provide generalized descriptions 
of the differences between NAFLD and NASH (38 vs. 
7 %, P < 0.001). Three types of responses were classified 
as general descriptions of the differences. These included 
(1) those that only mentioned NASH was more severe 
than NAFLD; (2) those that mentioned vague differ-
ences in the fat deposition, whether correct or incorrect 
(e.g., “Steatohepatitis is a disease; fatty liver is a result of 
cholesterol,
” “One is caused by alcohol; one by too much 
fat in the liver”); and (3) those that mentioned only that 
NASH involved a rise in liver enzymes.
Compared to PCPs, specialists reported more specific 
differences in histologic features (51 vs. 16 %, P < 0.001, 
Table 4). Such responses included (1) those that men-
tioned the need for a liver biopsy to differentiate; (2) those 
that indicated the presence of ballooning in NASH; and 
(3) those that reported differences in histological features 
such as the levels of fibrosis, scarring, and/or cirrhosis. 
More specialists (69 %) than PCPs (24 %) indicated that 
NAFLD involved no liver inflammation (P < 0.001). Of 
note, eight PCPs (5 % of all PCPs), which included five 
PCPs who claimed to be familiar with NASH, and 2 % of 
specialists reported excessive use of alcohol as a key char-
acteristic of NASH. Finally, 33 % of PCPs and only 1 % of 
the specialists reported that they were not sure of the dif-
ferences between NAFLD and NASH (P < 0.001, Table 4).
We examined the physician-defined differences based 
on their reported familiarity with NAFLD and NASH. 
Of those 79 PCPs who reported being familiar (here-
after referred to as familiar PCPs) with the differences 
between NAFLD and NASH in the multiple choice ques-
tion, 5 (6 %) reported that they were unsure of those dif-
ferences when asked to define the differences. Of 73 PCPs 
who were not familiar with the differences or unaware 
of NAFLD or NASH (hereafter referred to as unfamiliar 
PCPs), 22 (30 %) could provide generalized differences 
between the two (Table 5). Familiar PCPs were more 
likely than unfamiliar PCPs to correctly indicate that his-
tologic features (P < 0.001) and inflammation (P < 0.001) 
were associated with NASH and not NAFLD (Table 5).
Diagnostic practices
When asked about their diagnostic practices, 50 (34 %) 
PCPs indicated that they diagnosed patients with NASH 
(Table 6), and 9 (18 %) of those could identify histo-
logical features when asked to recall the differences 
between NAFLD and NASH. Additionally, 18 (36 %) 
PCPs reported that they were not sure of any difference. 
In contrast 146 specialists were diagnosing patients with

NASH and 75 (51 %) of those could identify differences in 
histological features of NASH (Table 6), and only 10 (7 %) 
reported generalized differences when asked to recall 
those differences.
Of the 44 responding PCPs who diagnosed patients 
with NASH, only 25 % of their patients had had a liver 
biopsy (Table 7). Of the 48 PCPs who had NASH 
patients that were diagnosed or referred by another 
physician, 44 % of their patients had had a liver biopsy. 
Those responding PCPs whose patients were diagnosed 
by another physician indicated that NASH diagnosis 
was confirmed by using noninvasive techniques, mainly 
ultrasound (74 %) and computed tomography scan (27 %, 
Table 7). Of the 150 specialists, 143 (97 %) said they diag-
nosed NASH (Table 7). Of these 143 specialists, 61 % of 
their patients had had a liver biopsy, and 63 % of their 
patients without a liver biopsy were not recommended 
one (Table 7). Among the 32 PCPs and 76 specialists who 
personally diagnosed at least one patient by a method 
other than a liver biopsy, significantly more PCPs (94 %) 
than specialists (50 %) reported relying solely on imaging 
and/or liver function tests as a primary method to diag-
nose NASH (P < 0.001, Table 8). Only specialists reported 
using FibroScan/transient elastography, and/or FibroSure 
as a primary method to diagnose NASH (P < 0.001).
We 
examined 
the 
physician-defined 
differences 
based on whether the respondent routinely screened 
for NASH (Table 9). Of those 80 PCPs who routinely 
screened, 20 (25 %) reported that they were unsure of 
the differences between NAFLD and NASH, and 6 (8 %) 
reported that the diseases were the same. PCPs reported 
more generalized differences (P < 0.001) and specialists 
reported more histological differences (P < 0.001).
When asked about what prompts physicians to screen 
for NAFLD and NASH, specialists were more likely 
than PCPs to screen patients with diabetes for NAFLD 
and NASH (P = 0.001, Table 10). PCPs were more likely 
than specialists to screen patients with abdominal pain 
(P = 0.001).
Management practices
At the time of taking the survey, responding PCPs were 
managing an average of 8.5 patients with confirmed 
NASH, while unfamiliar PCPs were managing an average 
of 3.7 patients with confirmed NASH. Specialists were 
managing an average of 32.2 patients with confirmed 
NASH (Table 11). Physicians were asked to include 
only patients for whom they were the primary physi-
cian making treatment decisions to manage NASH. Of 
the respondents, 70 % of PCPs and 98 % of specialists 
were currently managing NASH and/or NAFLD patients 
(Table 12). More specialists than PCPs reported using 
vitamin E and metformin to treat current NASH patients 
(P < 0.001 and P = 0.019, respectively). In addition, 21 % 
of the PCPs indicated that they would continue to man-

We then compared management practices for PCPs 
based on familiarity with NASH (Table 13). At the time of 
the survey, 58 % (42/73) of unfamiliar PCPs were manag-
ing patients with NAFLD or NASH. Despite lack of famili-
arity with the differences between NAFLD and NASH, 
unfamiliar PCPs were as likely as familiar PCPs to report

that they will manage new NASH patients (P = 0.514). 
When asked what symptoms would prompt a PCP to refer 
some patients to other physicians, 67 % (39/58) indicated 
they would refer for worsening laboratory values, liver 
function tests or abnormal transaminases.
Awareness of therapies in the pipeline for treating NASH
When asked about their knowledge of drugs for treat-
ing NASH that are in the development pipeline, more 
specialists than PCPs were aware of any drug in develop-
ment (61 vs 36 %, P < 0.001, Table 14). Fewer than 50 % of 
the specialists were aware of obeticholic acid while only 
12 % of PCPs were aware of it.

Our data suggest significant gaps in physician awareness 
and familiarity with NAFLD and NASH in the United 
States. Nearly half of the responding PCPs within our

study reported being unfamiliar with the differences 
between NAFLD and NASH, and 58 % of PCPs who were 
unfamiliar with these differences indicated that they were 
managing patients with NASH or NAFLD. In addition, 
these unfamiliar PCPs were just as likely as familiar PCPs 
to manage new NASH patients.
Because a liver biopsy is required for the diagnosis of 
NASH according to the current practice guideline [1], 
current prevalence estimates of NASH of 2–5 % may be 
low; not all patients may be willing to undergo a liver 
biopsy for confirmation. One prospective cohort study 
found the prevalence of NASH to be 12.2 % among its 
328 participants and 29.9 % among the 134 patients with 
positive ultrasound for fatty liver [17]. Others reported 
that surveyed physicians other than hepatologists under-
estimate the prevalence of [9–11, 20]. This apparent lack

of understanding of the prevalence of NAFLD suggests a 
limited knowledge of NAFLD, and as a result screening 
for NAFLD and NASH may be limited. Only about half of 
the PCPs in our study reported that they routinely screen 
for NAFLD and NASH.
Williams et al. reported that the prevalence of advanced 
NASH in untreated patients was 2.7 % (nine patients) and 
extrapolated their data to the general population, suggest-
ing that more than two million middle-aged adults in the 
United States may have undiagnosed advanced NASH [17]. 
Since patients with advanced NASH have a poor progno-
sis [21], PCPs, who are typically the first point of contact 
within the United States healthcare system, not only need 
to be aware of NAFLD and NASH, but also need to know 
how to effectively manage these patients to limit disease 
progression.
While our study did not specifically ask PCPs if they 
were aware of the guideline, we did ask questions that

allowed us to indirectly assess adherence to the practice 
guideline. Of the surveyed PCPs who personally diagnose 
NASH, 75 % of their patients had not been diagnosed by 
using the results of a liver biopsy. Additionally, PCPs who 
were treating referral patients for NASH reported that 
42 % of their patients had not had a liver biopsy (Table 7). 
Our data suggest that practicing PCPs within the United 
States may not be using the current practice guideline to 
diagnose NAFLD and NASH, and these data further sup-
port the work of others [4, 22] who suggested the current 
practice guideline may not provide a practical approach 
for PCPs to diagnose NASH. Although divergence from 
the guidelines might be an indicator of the lack of alter-
native solutions to a liver biopsy, the substantial differ-
ence in practices between PCPs and specialists in light of 
the large gap in knowledge between PCPs and specialists 
indicate this is likely a result of the limited knowledge 
among PCPs. PCPs might choose to continue managing 
patients due to the belief that there is no better alterna-
tive a specialist can offer.
At the time of our survey, unfamiliar PCPs were 
managing about four patients with confirmed NASH 
(Table 11). In addition, the proportion of responses from 
unfamiliar PCPs was not different from the proportion of 
responses from the familiar PCPs when asked about their 
future plans to manage new NASH patients. These data 
are somewhat surprising, because this indicates an appar-
ent overconfidence of the physicians who manage NASH 
patients but do so without NASH-specific knowledge.
PCPs were less likely than specialists to use vitamin 
E to treat patients with NASH; however, we did not ask 
whether these PCPs only used vitamin E in patients with 
liver biopsy-confirmed NASH. Furthermore, some spe-
cialists were using metformin even though no data sup-
port its use for treating NASH [1]. These data indicate 
that these responding physicians appear to not be follow-
ing the practice guideline for treating NASH. Although 
this could indicate lack of awareness of such guidelines, it 
is likely more of a reflection of the skepticism with guide-
lines as it relates to treatments, given their overall lack 
of efficacy. As expected, more specialists than PCPs did 
have some knowledge about the drugs in development to 
treat NASH.
One practical approach to narrowing the gap in knowl-
edge between PCPs and specialists starts with establish-
ing a program for accreditation of centers with special 
expertise in NAFLD-related liver conditions, particu-
larly NASH, to raise the overall quality of care and out-
comes in patients with this life-threatening disease. This 
program should be multidisciplinary and global in order 
to capitalize on the highly interrelated nature of this 
condition to its underlying risk factors. Efforts to cre-
ate this program can mirror those of The Pulmonary 
Hypertension Association’s Scientific Leadership Coun-
cil’s effort in establishing the PHA-Accredited PH Care 
Centers (PHCC) in order to raise the overall quality of 
care and outcomes in patients with pulmonary hyperten-
sion (PH), in particular pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) [23]. Similar to NAFLD, PH is a highly prevalent 
condition that is often confused with related conditions, 
with PAH affecting only a small subset of patients with 
a very different prognosis, similar to NASH. Like NASH, 
PAH was often misdiagnosed due to the need for a right 
heart catheterization in order to accurately determine 
the diagnosis. Right heart catheterizations, however, pre-
sented a challenge for many physicians and patients due 
to similar reasons liver biopsies will remain a challenge 
to perform among all patients with suspected NAFLD 
or NASH. Such expert center would lead the process of 
coming to a consensus on what biomarkers can be used 
in diagnosing and in evaluating drugs in development. 
Once revised guidelines are achieved based on these rec-
ommendations, it would serve to accredit physicians or 
centers in the proper diagnosing of NAFLD-related liver 
conditions. Additionally, it will be important for these 
programs to then collaborate with the highly structured 
existing centers, such as diabetes education centers, that 
are aimed to maximize knowledge and proper treatment 
of underlying risk factors of NAFLD-related liver condi-
tions. Our study had three limitations. First, while low, 
our response rates are similar to other mailed surveys. 
Second, the abilities of the physicians to recall specific 
patient data may have influenced their responses. Third, 
the survey did not specifically ask about awareness of the 
practice guideline for NAFLD and NASH, therefore, we 
cannot comment on the specific knowledge of the prac-
tice guideline in relation to the diagnosis and manage-
ment of NASH.
Conclusions
The awareness of and familiarity with the differences 
between NAFLD and NASH by surveyed PCP in the 
United States is limited. While specialists were generally 
more knowledgeable about these differences, not all spe-
cialists were following the diagnosis and treatment guide-
line. Therefore, more education for PCPs and specialists 
is needed to ensure NAFLD and NASH are appropriately 
diagnosed and managed.
