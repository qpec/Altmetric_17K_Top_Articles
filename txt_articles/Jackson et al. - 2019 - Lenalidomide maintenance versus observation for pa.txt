Summary
Background Patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide maintenance therapy have improved 
progression-free survival, primarily following autologous stem-cell transplantation. A beneficial effect of lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy on overall survival in this setting has been inconsistent between individual studies. Minimal 
data are available on the effect of maintenance lenalidomide in more aggressive disease states, such as patients with 
cytogenetic high-risk disease or patients ineligible for transplantation. We aimed to assess lenalidomide maintenance 
versus observation in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including cytogenetic risk and transplantation 
status subgroup analyses.
Methods The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial with three randomisation 
stages done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland. There were three potential 
randomisations in the study: induction treatment (allocation by transplantation eligibility status); intensification 
treatment (allocation by response to induction therapy); and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the 
randomisation to maintenance treatment. Eligible patients for maintenance randomisation were aged 18 years or older 
and had symptomatic or non-secretory multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per 
protocol and had achieved at least a minimal response to protocol treatment, including lenalidomide. Patients were 
randomly assigned (1:1 from Jan 13, 2011, to Jun 27, 2013, and 2:1 from Jun 28, 2013, to Aug 11, 2017) to lenalidomide 
maintenance (10 mg orally on days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle) or observation, and stratified by allocated induction and 
intensification treatment, and centre. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival, 
analysed by intention to treat. Safety analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, number 2009-010956-93, and has completed recruitment.
Findings Between Jan 13, 2011, and Aug 11, 2017, 1917 patients were accrued to the maintenance treatment 
randomisation of the trial. 1137 patients were assigned to lenalidomide maintenance and 834 patients to observation. 
After a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR 18–50), median progression-free survival was 39 months (95% CI 36–42) 
with lenalidomide and 20 months (18–22) with observation (hazard ratio [HR] 0·46 [95% CI 0·41–0·53]; p<0·0001), 
and 3-year overall survival was 78·6% (95% Cl 75·6–81·6) in the lenalidomide group and 75·8% (72·4–79·2) in the 
observation group (HR 0·87 [95% CI 0·73–1·05]; p=0·15). Progression-free survival was improved with lenalidomide 
compared with observation across all prespecified subgroups. On prespecified subgroup analyses by transplantation 
status, 3-year overall survival in transplantation-eligible patients was 87·5% (95% Cl 84·3–90·7) in the lenalidomide 
group and 80·2% (76·0–84·4) in the observation group (HR 0·69 [95% CI 0·52–0·93]; p=0·014), and in transplantation-
ineligible patients it was 66·8% (61·6–72·1) in the lenalidomide group and 69·8% (64·4–75·2) in the observation 
group (1·02 [0·80–1·29]; p=0·88). By cytogenetic risk group, in standard-risk patients, 3-year overall survival was 
86·4% (95% CI 80·0–90·9) in the lenalidomide group compared with 81·3% (74·2–86·7) in the observation group, 
and in high-risk patients, it was 74.9% (65·8–81·9) in the lenalidomide group compared with 63·7% (52·8–72·7) in 
the observation group; and in ultra-high-risk patients it was 62·9% (46·0–75·8) compared with 43·5% (22·2–63·1). 
Since these subgroup analyses results were not powered they should be interpreted with caution. The most common 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events for patients taking lenalidomide were haematological, including neutropenia 
(362 [33%] patients), thrombocytopenia (72 [7%] patients), and anaemia (42 [4%] patients). Serious adverse events were 
reported in 494 (45%) of 1097 patients receiving lenalidomide compared with 150 (17%) of 874 patients on observation. 
The most common serious adverse events were infections in both the lenalidomide group and the observation group. 
460 deaths occurred during maintenance treatment, 234 (21%) in the lenalidomide group and 226 (27%) in the 
observation group, and no deaths in the lenalidomide group were deemed treatment related.
Interpretation Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide significantly improved progression-free survival in patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma compared with observation, but did not improve overall survival in the 
intention-to-treat analysis of the whole trial population. The manageable safety profile of this drug and the encouraging

Introduction
Most patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
have achieved survival benefits from the therapeutic 
advances made during the past decade, but patients with 
high-risk subsets of disease have benefited less.1 High-
risk disease can be identified at presentation by the 
cytogenetic lesions t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p), and 
gain(1q), which are good markers to predict early relapse. 
In patients with high-risk disease, relapse is the result of 
the persistence of residual disease,2,3 even at very low 
levels, and is associated with clonal evolution and 
progressive immune dysfunction.4,5 These biological 
features can impair the activity of subsequent lines of 
therapy; therefore, finding strategies that could prevent 
relapse in this group would be a considerable step 
forward to improve the outcomes of these patients.6
Control or elimination of residual disease clones might 
be achieved by maintenance therapy, and several strategies 
have been assessed in this setting, with lenalidomide 
being the most promising because of its mode of action 
and tolerability.7–9 Our preceding study, the Medical 
Research Council Myeloma IX trial,10 compared the use of 
the immunomodulatory agent thalidomide as main-
tenance therapy with observation in patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma. Treatment with thalidomide 
improved progression-free survival in these patients, but 
there was no improvement in overall survival. Importantly, 
in patients with cytogenetic high-risk disease, thalidomide 
did not improve progression-free survival or overall 
survival. Toxicity (including peripheral neuropathy, 
lethargy, and constipation) with thalidomide restricted 
therapy completion and might have affected the overall 
survival outcomes in this setting. Our findings were 
consistent with the results of other contemporaneous 
thalidomide maintenance studies.11,12 The Myeloma XI 
study was therefore designed to assess whether the newer, 
better tolerated, immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide 
could overcome the limitations of thalidomide as 
maintenance therapy in this setting and improve 
progression-free survival and overall survival in patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Binding of lenalidomide to the cereblon complex13 leads 
to the ubiquitination of substrates, including the tran-
scription factors Ikaros and Aiolos, marking them for 
proteasomal degradation and resulting in decreased 
expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4).14,15 
Lenalidomide has direct tumouricidal effects on myeloma 
cells and also triggers indirect immuno 
modulatory 
effects, including activation of natural killer and T cells, 
which might help with elimination of minimal residual 
disease in patients with multiple myeloma.14–17 Whether or 
not these mechanisms can help to control residual clonal 
disease in patients with high-risk cytogenetic disease is 
unknown.
Three previous studies have shown that lenalidomide 
maintenance

Research in context
Evidence before this study
A search of PubMed for clinical trial reports published in English 
before May, 2010, using the terms “lenalidomide” and 
“myeloma” and “maintenance” revealed no published 
randomised studies of lenalidomide maintenance in patients 
with newly diagnosed myeloma. 
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, the Myeloma XI trial recruited more patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma than any previous 
interventional study in myeloma. We showed a significant 
benefit of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in terms of 
progression-free survival, which was consistent across both 
patients eligible for transplantation and those who were 
ineligible, as well as patients across all cytogenetic risk groups, 
even those with high-risk disease. The primary endpoint 
analysis of overall survival was not met. However, a preplanned 
subgroup analysis indicates an overall survival benefit in 
transplantation-eligible patients across all cytogenetic risk 
groups, even those with high-risk disease, when treated with 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy after transplantation.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of the Myeloma XI trial contribute to a body of 
evidence that suggests that the use of lenalidomide as 
maintenance therapy should be considered for patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, of all cytogenetic risk 
groups, after autologous stem-cell transplantation. With the 
addition of these new data from the Myeloma XI trial, a meta-
analysis of all published trials of lenalidomide maintenance after 
autologous stem-cell transplantation, including 3179 patients, 
confirmed the overall survival benefit of lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy compared with observation in this setting 
(hazard ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·56–0·91]). Future studies examining 
combinations of agents with lenalidomide are needed to further 
improve outcomes for high-risk patients with multiple myeloma. 
In transplantation-ineligible patients, novel approaches to 
improve overall survival are warranted.
results in subgroup analyses of patients across all cytogenetic risk groups support further investigation of maintenance 
lenalidomide in this setting.

autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with 
multiple myeloma.7–9 Overall survival outcomes were 
inconsistent between these studies, none of which was 
appropriately powered to make robust conclusions based 
on this endpoint. One study8 showed a clear overall survival 
benefit for those patients treated with maintenance 
lenalidomide compared with observation, whereas the 
other two studies7,9 showed no significant benefit. However, 
a recently published meta-analysis18 including these trials 
showed that lenalidomide main 
tenance can improve 
overall survival compared with observation in this setting, 
and it is now approved for use by both the European 
Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration. 
For patients with multiple myeloma who are ineligible for 
trans 
plantation, continuous therapy with lenalidomide 
plus low-dose dexamethasone improved progression-free 
survival and overall survival compared with a combination 
of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide.19,20 No 
previous studies of either transplantation-eligible or 
transplantation-ineligible patients had sufficient num 
bers 
to assess the effect of lenalidomide maintenance therapy 
in patients with multiple myeloma and high-risk 
cytogenetics.
Here, we aimed to assess the effect of lenalidomide 
maintenance on the survival of patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma, including preplanned sub-
group analyses by cytogenetic risk group and trans-
plantation status.
Methods
Study design and participants
The Myeloma XI was a phase 3, open-label, randomised, 
adaptive design trial with three randomisation stages 
(figure 1). There were three potential randomisations in 
the study: at trial entry for all patients to allocate induction 
treatment separately for those considered eligible or 
ineligible for transplantation; after induction treatment 
for those patients with a suboptimal response to treatment 
(minimal or partial response) to allocate induction 
intensification; and at the completion of induction and 
intensification or autologous stem-cell transplantation 
(where applicable) to allocate main 
tenance treatment. 
This report is concerned with the results of the 
randomisation to maintenance treat 
ment. Results of the 
induction 
intensification 
randomisations 
will 
be 
presented elsewhere. The trial was done at 110 National 
Health Service hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland 
(appendix p 2).
The full study protocol including the inclusion criteria 
for each randomisation is available in the appendix (p 34). 
Patients aged at least 18 years and who had symptomatic 
multiple myeloma or non-secretory multiple myeloma 
based on bone marrow clonal plasma cells, organ or 
tissue impairment considered by the clinician to be 
myeloma related, or paraprotein (M-protein) in serum or 
urine were eligible for the initial randomisation. 
Exclusion criteria for the initial randomisation included 
previous or concurrent malig 
nancies, including myelo-
dysplastic syndromes; previous treatment for myeloma 
(except local radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, and cortico-
steroids); grade 2 or worse peripheral neuro 
pathy, acute 
renal failure (unresponsive to up to 72 h of rehydration, 
characterised by creatinine >500 μmol/L or urine output 
<400 mL per day, or requiring dialysis); and active or 
previous hepatitis C infection.
Patients who were young and fit to tolerate autologous 
stem-cell 
transplantation 
(transplantation 
eligible) 
entered the intensive treatment pathway. Older and less 
fit patients (transplantation ineligible) entered the non-
intensive treatment pathway. Strict age limits were 
deliberately avoided so that fit, older patients could receive 
intensive therapy and undergo autologous stem-cell 
trans 
plantation. However, generally, patients aged 
60 years or younger entered the intensive (younger, fitter) 
pathway; those aged 70 years or older entered the non-
intensive (older, less fit) pathway; and those aged 
61–69 years were eligible for either intensive or non-
intensive therapy. The decision of treatment pathway was 
made on an individual patient basis, taking into account 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 
clinician judgment, and patient preference.
For the maintenance therapy randomisation, eligible 
patients were those who completed their assigned 
induction therapy according to the protocol (a minimum 
of four cycles of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and 
dexamethasone [CTD]; cyclophosphamide, lenali 
domide, 
and dexamethasone [CRD]; or carfilzomib, cyclophos-
phamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone [KCRD] in 
the intensive pathway, or a minimum of six cycles of 
attenuated CTD or attenuated CRD in the non-intensive 
pathway), and had achieved at least a minimal response 
and received at least 100 mg/m² melphalan if assigned to 
intensive treatment.
The study was approved by the national ethics review 
board (National Research Ethics Service, London, UK), 
institutional review boards of the participating centres, 
and the competent regulatory authority (Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, UK), 
and was undertaken according to the Declaration of 
Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice as 
espoused in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical 
Trials) Regulations. All patients provided written informed 
consent. The study is closed for accrual, but follow-up 
continues for planned long-term analysis.
Randomisation and masking
Patients considered eligible for transplantation at trial 
entry were randomly assigned (1:1) to induction treatment 
with either CTD or CRD. A computer-generated mini-
misation algorithm was used to avoid chance imbalances 
in six variables measured at trial entry: β₂ microglobulin 
(<3·5 mg/L vs 3·5–<5·5 mg/L vs ≥5·5 mg/L vs 
or unknown), haemoglobin (<115 g/L vs ≥115 g/L for 
men; <95 g/L vs ≥95 g/L for women), corrected serum

calcium (<2·6 mmol/L vs ≥2·6 mmol/L), serum creatinine 
(<140 μmol/L vs ≥140 μmol/L), platelets (<150 × 10⁹ cells per L 
vs ≥150 × 10⁹ cells per L), and centre (each centre is listed in 
the appendix pp 2–4). Following a protocol amendment on 
June 28, 2013, and after the accrual of 1512 patients, 
patients considered eligible for trans 
plantation were 
randomly assigned (1:1:2) to CTD, CRD, or KCRD. A 
similar minimisation algorithm was used to avoid chance 
imbalances in the six variables measured at trial entry. 
These changes were made to add research questions to 
this adaptive design study. Patients considered ineligible 
for transplantation at trial entry were randomly assigned 
(1:1) to induction with either attenuated CTD or attenuated 
CRD. A similar minimisation algorithm was used to avoid 
chance imbalances in the six variables measured at trial 
entry.
Patients with a suboptimal response to induction 
treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclo-
phosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CVD) 
or no CVD. A minimisation algorithm was used to 
avoid chance imbalances in three variables: allocated 
induction treatment (CTD vs CRD vs attenuated CTD vs 
attenuated CRD), response to induction treatment 
(minimal response or partial response), and centre. 
Patients allocated to KCRD induction treatment were 
ineligible for this randomisation.

Patients completing induction and intensification 
treatment (where applicable) and eligible were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to lenalidomide maintenance or observation. 
A minimisation algorithm was used to avoid chance 
imbalances in three variables: allocated induction 
treatment (CTD vs CRD vs attenuated CTD vs attenuated 
CRD), allocated intensification treatment (no CVD vs CVD 
vs not randomised at intensification randomisation), and 
centre. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 14, 2011, 
and after accrual of 442 patients under protocol 
versions 2.0 to 4.0, patients were randomly assigned 
(1:1:1) to lenalidomide, lenalidomide plus vorinostat, or 
observation. A similar minimisation algorithm was used 
to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables 
with the same categories. Following a protocol amendment 
on June 28, 2013, and after accrual of 615 further patients 
under protocol version 5.0, patients were randomly 
assigned (2:1) to lenalidomide or observation. A similar 
minimisation algorithm was used to avoid chance 
imbalances in the same three variables with the same 
categories but with the addition of KCRD to the induction 
treatment options. These changes were made to add and 
remove research questions in this adaptive design study.
All randomisations were done at the Clinical Trials 
Research Unit (Leeds, UK) by authorised members of 
staff with a centralised automated 24 h telephone 
system according to a validated minimisation algorithm 
produced under the supervision of WMG. Because of the 
nature of the intervention, the study was open label and 
the allocated treatment was not masked from study 
investigators or patients. The funders remained masked 
to treatment results until data cutoff for analysis.
Procedures
The dose, schedule, and route of administration of each 
drug included in the induction and consolidation 
regimens are in the protocol (appendix p 34). Briefly, in 
transplantation-eligible patients, induction therapy with 
CTD, CRD, or KCRD continued for at least four cycles 
in the absence of progressive disease, until maximum 
response or intolerance was observed. In transplantation-
ineligible patients, attenuated CTD or attenuated 
CRD continued for at least six cycles in the absence 
of progressive disease, until maximum response or 
intolerance was observed. Attenuated versions of 
induction included lower doses of dexamethasone and a 
lower starting dose of thalidomide. For all patients, 
bisphosphonates were recom 
mended until progressive 
disease and thrombo 
prophylaxis was recom 
mended for 
at least the first 3 months of treatment as per IMWG 
recommendations. Growth factor support and prophylaxis 
for pneumonia, varicella, fungal infection, and tumour 
lysis syndrome were allowed as per local practice.
Transplantation-eligible 
patients 
receiving 
KCRD 
proceeded to high-dose melphalan and autologous 
stem-cell transplantation. Patients receiving immuno-
modulatory-based triplets (CTD vs CRD) followed a 
response-adapted 
approach: 
those 
with 
complete 
response or very good partial response (assessed 
according to International Myeloma Working Group 
[IMWG] criteria) proceeded to autologous stem-cell 
transplantation in the transplantation-eligible pathway, 
whereas transplantation-ineligible patients proceeded 
directly to maintenance randomisation. For maintenance 
therapy, 100 days after autologous stem-cell trans-
plantation or once a maximum response was achieved 
for transplantation-ineligible patients, patients initially 
received lenalidomide 25 mg per day (orally on days 1–21 
of each 28-day cycle) or were observed without 
lenalidomide therapy. Following a protocol amendment 
on Sept 14, 2011, and after accrual of 442 patients, patients 
were allocated (1:1:1) to receive lenalidomide 10 mg per 
day (orally on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle), lenalidomide 
10 mg per day (orally on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle) 
plus vorinostat 300 mg per day (orally on days 1–7 and 
15–21 of each 28-day cycle), or observation. After accrual 
of 615 more patients, a further protocol amendment on 
June 28, 2013, allocated patients to receive lenalidomide 
10 mg per day (orally on days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle) or 
observation in a 2:1 ratio, and the lenalidomide plus 
vorinostat group was discontinued. This change was 
proposed by the Myeloma XI Trial Management Group 
and approved by the Myeloma XI Data Monitoring and 
Ethics Committee (DMEC) on June 24, 2011. The change 
in dose was based on emerging results from previous 
studies using 10 mg lenalidomide weighted against the 
potential for late toxicity (increased secondary primary 
malignancy), which was being reported in other trials at 
that time. Maintenance treatment continued until 
progressive disease in the absence of toxicity. Here, we 
report outcomes for patients receiving lenalidomide 
alone versus observation. Patients receiving lenalidomide 
in combination with vorinostat will be reported elsewhere 
when the primary endpoint has been met in that group.
Response and disease progression were assessed on the 
basis of IMWG Uniform Response criteria21,22 and 
reviewed centrally by an expert panel masked to treatment 
allocation. Adverse events were graded according to the 
US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. 
Adverse reactions were assessed at the start of each 
treatment cycle in patients receiving lenalidomide. 
Serious adverse events were reported for all patients from 
the date of randomisation until 30 days after the date of 
disease progression except in the case of serious adverse 
reactions or second primary malignancies, which were 
collected for the duration of the trial. Second primary 
malignancies were reported as serious adverse events for 
the duration of the study (ie, until death for each patient 
or when the study closes, whichever was earlier). The 
definition of secondary primary malignancies excluded 
non-melanoma skin cancers such as squamous and basal 
cell carcinomas of the skin. Paraprotein, serum-free light-
chain analysis, and urinary light chain excretion were

assessed at least every 2 months for the first 2 years and 
then at least every 3 months until disease progression.
Lenalidomide dose reductions due to adverse reactions 
were allowed. Treatment was discontinued for grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia and for a platelet count of less than 30 × 10⁹/L. 
On recovery, treatment was restarted at the previous dose, 
with the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
in the case of grade 3 neutropenia with fever or grade 4 
neutropenia. If neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occur-
red a second time, then the dose was reduced by one dose 
level as stipulated in the protocol (eg, from 10 mg daily to 
5 mg daily). Full details of the dose reduction schedules 
are shown in the protocol (appendix p 34).
Cytogenetic risk profiling was performed by use of 
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and 
quantitative real-time PCR using DNA and RNA 
respectively, which was extracted from CD138-selected 
plasma cells from bone marrow biopsy samples taken 
before treatment initiation. Quantitative real-time PCR 
was used to assess the expression of translocation gene 
partners including t(4;14):MMSET, FGFR3, t(14;16):MAF, 
and t(14;20):MAFB. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplifi 
cation was used to assess copy number aberrations 
by including probe sets at sites of the commonly deleted 
or amplified regions in myeloma (eg, at genes CKS1B on 
1q21.3 and TP53 on 17p13). These techniques are 
validated and provide equivalent results to interphase 
fluorescence in-situ hybridisation.23–25 Patients were 
classified into three cytogenetic risk groups for the 
preplanned analysis of outcomes: standard risk (no 
adverse cytogenetic abnormalities), high risk (one adverse 
cytogenetic abnormality), or ultra-high risk (two or more 
adverse cytogenetic abnormalities). Adverse cytogenetic 
abnormalities were defined as gain(1q), t(4;14), t(14;16), 
t(14;20), or del(17p).2,3 In a post-hoc analysis, an alternative 
cytogenetic high-risk classification was used, including 
patients with t(4;14), del(17p), or t(4;14) and del(17p).7
Outcomes
The co-primary endpoints of the maintenance evaluation 
of the trial were progression-free survival and overall 
survival. Progression-free survival was defined as the 
time from maintenance randomisation to progressive 
disease or death from any cause. Overall survival was 
defined as the time from maintenance randomisation to 
death from any cause or last follow-up.
Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival 2, 
defined as the time from maintenance randomisation to 
the date of second progressive disease, start of third 
antimyeloma treatment, or death from any cause; the 
time to improved response; and toxicity. Exploratory 
analyses of progression-free survival, overall survival, 
and response by cytogenetic risk group in the overall 
population and by cytogenetic risk group were 
prespecified by protocol and by induction/intensification 
treatment were prespecified in the statistical analysis 
plan within each pathway.

Statistical analysis
The data cutoff date for this analysis was Oct 23, 2017
. We 
present here the results of the co-primary endpoints, some 
secondary endpoints (progression-free survival 2 and 
toxicity), and prespecified subgroup analysis for the 
maintenance randomisation of this trial. Response 
(secondary endpoint) and other exploratory endpoints will 
be reported elsewhere. The hypothesis of the maintenance 
randomisation was that lenalidomide treatment could 
improve progression-free survival and overall survival 
compared with observation in adult patients with multiple 
myeloma. For progression-free survival, the trial was 
designed to demonstrate a 6·7-month increase in median 
progression-free survival in the lenalidomide group 
(median 26·7 months) compared with the observation 
group (median 20·0 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0·75) when 
509 progression-free survival events had been observed. 
For overall survival, it was designed to demonstrate a 
10% increase in 5-year overall survival in the lenalidomide 
group (60% at 5 years) compared with the observation 
group (50% at 5 years, HR 0·74) when 458 overall survival 
events had been observed. Each of these calculations 
assumed the time to event was exponentially distributed 
and that recruitment would last 3·25 years with 4 years of 
further follow-up, a two-sided 5% significance level, and 
90% power. A minimum recruitment target of 1013 patients 
randomly assigned to (1:1) lenalidomide and observation 
was specified, allowing for a 2% dropout. Efficacy analyses 
were done by intention to treat, including all patients 
randomly assigned to either lenalidomide alone or 
observation. The safety population included all patients 
who received at least one dose of maintenance therapy or 
those were assigned to observation. Patients randomly 
assigned during a transient period of the trial to the 
combination of lenalidomide and vorinostat (n=307), as per 
the protocol modification on Sept 14, 2011, were excluded 
from this analysis and will be reported elsewhere.
For the co-primary endpoints, we estimated summaries 
of time to event per treatment group using the Kaplan-
Meier method. We made comparisons between the 
allocated groups using the Cox proportional hazards 
model stratified by the minimisation stratification 
factors, excluding centre, and to estimate HRs and 
95% CIs. We used similar methods to assess the 
secondary outcome of progression-free survival 2. We 
also did sensitivity analyses for progression-free survival 
using similar models in which those participants 
identified to have progressed in advance of maintenance 
randomisation were defined as having an event at the 
time of maintenance randomisation. Subgroup analysis 
was prespecified for the presence or absence of individual 
adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, cytogenetic risk 
status, and induction and consolidation treatment 
(CVD intensification and transplantation eligibility). We 
did a likelihood ratio test for heterogeneity of treatment 
effect using Cox models identical to those used for the 
main analysis, with the inclusion of terms for the 
subgroup in question and the appropriate interaction 
term. The reported test for heterogeneity for subgroup 
analysis corresponds to a one degree of freedom test for 
two category subgroups and a two degrees of freedom 
test for three category subgroups.
We summarised toxicity, in terms of adverse events, 
descriptively. 
We 
estimated 
cumulative 
incidence 
function curves for time to second primary malignancies 
by non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation. We 
used Fine and Gray competing risks regression to 
compare the hazard of second primary malignancies 
by allocated treatment, adjusting for the minimisation 
stratification factors, with unrelated deaths specified as a 
competing risk. We calculated person-years on trial as 
the sum of all patients receiving at least one dose of study 
treatment of the time in years from randomisation to 
death or last date known to be alive. We calculated 
incidence with the number of events as the numerator 
and the number of person-years on trial as the 
denominator. We calculated 95% CIs for incidence using 
approximations to the Poisson distribution.
Post-hoc exploratory analyses undertaken were the 
effect on progression-free survival, overall survival, and 
progression-free survival 2 of the subgroups sex, age, 
disease stage according to the International Staging 
System, and response at start of maintenance; analysis of 
the effect of induction or intensification treatment and 
cytogenetic risk group on progression-free survival 2; 
analysis 
of 
the 
patients 
subsequently 
receiving 
lenalidomide in later lines of therapy; and a meta-analysis 
including the transplantation-eligible patients of this 
trial and those of previously published trials.
A formal interim analysis was prespecified in the study 
protocol for overall survival when at least 50% of required

events had been observed (≥229 deaths). To ensure an 
overall significance level of 5% was maintained, we used 
the O’Brien and Fleming alpha-spending function with 
bounds specified at the time of the interim analysis 
related to the proportion of information accrued (interim 
analysis bound 0·94%, final analysis bound 4·7%). 
The bound for the interim analysis was advisory, with 
the decision to release results at the recommendation 
of the Independent Myeloma XI DMEC and the 
Independent Myeloma XI Trial Steering Committee. The 
interim analysis was done and presented to the DMEC 
on Sept 1, 2016, and the study continued without 
reporting the interim analysis. All reported p values are 
two sided and considered significant at an overall 
significance level of 5%.
We used SAS (version 9.4), Stata/IC, and R (version 
3.2.3) for statistical analyses.
This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu,

Results
1971 patients were accrued to the maintenance 
randomisation between Jan 13, 2011, and Aug 11, 2017
. 
1137 patients were assigned to receive lenalidomide alone 
and 834 patients were assigned to observation (figure 1). 
Patient and disease characteristics were well balanced 
between groups (table 1).
The median follow-up after randomisation for this 
analysis was 31 months (IQR 18–50). For the primary 
analyses, 456 (40%) of 1137 patients in the lenalidomide 
group and 533 (64%) of 834 patients in the obser-
vation group had disease progression or died. Median 
progression-free survival was 39 months (95% CI 36–42) 
with lenalidomide and 20 months (18–22) with 
observation (HR 0·46 [95% CI 0·41–0·53]; p<0·0001; 
figure 2A). A sensitivity analysis including those patients 
who had disease progression before maintenance 
randomisation, in which events were defined at the time 
of maintenance randomisation rather than being 
censored at the time of maintenance randomisation, 
gave similar results (appendix p 33).
234 (21%) of 1137 patients died in the lenalidomide 
group and 226 (27%) of 834 patients died in the 
observation group. Median overall survival was not 
reached (95% CI 66–not reached) with lenalidomide 
and not reached (61–not reached) with observation. 
3-year overall survival was 78·6% (95% Cl 75·6–81·6) in 
the lenalidomide group and 75·8% (72·4–79·2) in the 
observation group, and 5-year overall survival was 61·3% 
(95% Cl 56·6–66·1) in the lenalidomide group and 
56·6% (51·5–61·7) in the observation group. No 
difference was detected between lenalidomide and 
observation for overall survival (HR 0·87 [95% CI 
0·73–1·05]; p=0·15; figure 2B). The most common cause 
of death was tumour load (appendix p 25).
285 (25%) of 1137 patients in the lenalidomide group and 
328 (39%) of 834 patients in the observation group had 
second disease progression or died. Median progression-
free survival 2 was 64 months (95% CI 57–not reached)

with lenalidomide and 45 months (41–50) with observation 
(HR 0·65 [95% CI 0·56–0·77]; p<0·0001; figure 3).
At the time of analysis, the median duration of 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy was 18 cycles 
(IQR 6–30). Dose modifications were applied to 
781 (69%) of 1137 patients allocated to lenalidomide 
treatment. Reasons for discontinuing in the 594 patients 
who had ceased lenalidomide maintenance were disease 
progression or death in 320 (54%) patients, adverse 
events in 167 (28%) patients, patient preference in 
45 (8%) patients, other reasons for 43 (7%) patients, and 
unknown reasons for 19 (3%) patients. Adverse events 
were assessed in the 1097 patients who completed at least 
one dose of study drug (table 2). The most common 
grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reactions in the 
lenalidomide group were neutropenia in 362 (33%) 
patients, thrombocytopenia in 72 (7%) patients, and 
anaemia in 42 (4%) patients. Serious adverse events were 
reported in 494 (45%) of 1097 patients receiving 
lenalidomide compared with 150 (17%) of 874 patients on 
observation (appendix p 29). The 3-year cumulative 
incidence of second primary malignancies was low, 
but higher in the lenalidomide group than the obser-
vation group (5·3% [95% CI 3·6–7·1] vs 3·1% [1·8–4·5]; 
HR 1·85 [95% CI 1·18–2·90]; appendix p 5). The over-
all incidence of second primary malignancies per 
100 patient-years was 2·4 (95% CI 1·9–3·1) in the 
lenalidomide group and 1·4 (1·0–2·0) in the observation 
group. The 3-year cumulative incidence of deaths related 
to second primary malignancies was low in both groups 
(2·0% [95% CI 0·9–3·1] in the lenalidomide group vs 
0·9% [0·2–1·6] in the observation group; appendix p 6). 
A summary of all second primary malignancies by inter-
vention group is shown in the appendix (p 30).
The most common serious adverse events were 
infections in both the lenalidomide group and the 
observation group. 460 deaths occurred during main-
tenance treatment, 234 (21%) in the lenalidomide group 
and 226 (27%) in the observation group, and no deaths in 
the lenalidomide group were reported as treatment-
related (appendix p 25).
In the subgroup analyses, the benefit of lenalidomide on 
progression-free survival was seen across most sub 
groups 
of patients (figure 4A), including those prespecified 
(transplantation-eligible and transplantation-ineligible 
patients and those defined as standard risk, high-risk and 
ultra-high risk genetics). The only significant heterogeneity 
was between patients who achieved a complete or very 
good partial response and those who had a partial or 
minimal 
response 
before 
maintenance 
therapy 
(pheterogeneity<0·0001). Although progression-free survival 
improved signifi 
cantly with lenalidomide maintenance in 
both res 
ponders and non-responders, patients with a sub-
optimal response before maintenance therapy appeared to 
benefit the most.

with (774 [39%] of 1971) and without (1197 [61%] of 1971) 
cytogenetic data available were balanced (appendix p 31). 
Progression-free survival was improved in patients of 
all cytogenetic risk groups (standard risk, high risk, 
and ultra-high risk) who received lenalidomide compared 
with those on observation (appendix p 9); the benefit 
of lenalidomide was also seen across these risk 
categories when the intention-to-treat popu 
lation was 
divided into transplantation-eligible and transplantation-
ineligible patients, with no significant heterogeneity 
between genetic subgroups (pheterogeneity=0·98 for trans-
plantation-eligible patients, pheterogeneity=0·76 for trans-
plantation-ineligible patients; appendix pp 10–11). Similar 
results for progression-free survival were seen if the 
definition of high risk was restricted to patients with 
t(4;14), t(4;14) and del(17p), or del(17p) compared with 
those with 
out either t(4;14) or del(17p), independently of 
transplantation eligibility (appendix pp 12–14). Further 
subgroup analyses of progression-free survival by 
induction treatment and transplantation status also 
showed a benefit for lenalidomide maintenance 
compared with observation regardless of sex, age, disease 
stage, and response at baseline (appendix pp 7–8).

In the subgroup analysis of overall survival (figure 5A), 
there was significant heterogeneity in outcomes 
based on pathway for previous induction treatment 
(pheterogeneity=0·0445) and age (pheterogeneity=0·0442), with age 
probably acting as a surrogate for transplantation 
pathway eligibility. A significant improvement in overall 
survival was seen in transplantation-eligible patients 
treated with lenalidomide compared with those assigned

inestimable because of the small numbers of patients and events in the subgroup. Comparisons by sex, International Staging System disease stage, and response 
before maintenance were done as post-hoc analyses. The test for heterogeneity in the Response before maintenance setting only applied to the CR or VGPR and PR or

to observation (3-year overall survival in transplant-
eligible patients 87·5% [95% Cl 84·3–90·7] with 
lenalidomide and 80·2% [76·0–84·4] with observation; 
HR 0·69 [95% CI 0·52–0·93]; p=0·014; figure 5B). 
However, lenalidomide maintenance therapy did not 
improve overall survival in transplantation-ineligible 
patients (3-year overall survival 66·8% [61·6–72·1] with 
lenalidomide and 69·8% [64·4–75·2] with observation; 
HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·80–1·29]; p=0·88; figure 5C). The 
benefit of lenalidomide maintenance therapy on overall 
survival in the transplantation-eligible patients was also 
confirmed across subgroups based on age, disease stage, 
induction therapy, and response at baseline (appendix 
p 15). Heterogeneity was detected in overall survival 
benefit by sex (appendix p 15). No subgroup appeared to 
benefit 
from 
lenalidomide 
maintenance 
in 
the 
transplantation-ineligible pathway (appendix pp 15–16). 
In the subgroup analysis of over 
all survival by 
transplantation status, there was no heterogeneity 
between cytogenetic risk groups (appendix pp 15–22). By 
cytogenetic risk group, in standard-risk patients, 3-year 
overall survival was 86·4% (95% CI 80·0–90·9) in the 
lenalidomide group compared with 81·3% (74·2–86·7] in 
the observation group, and in high-risk patients, it was 
74·9% (65·8–81·9) in the lenalidomide group compared 
with 63·7% (52·8–72·7) in the observation group; and in 
ultra-high-risk patients it was 62·9% (46·0–75·8) 
compared with 43·5% (22·2–63·1).
A 
significant 
improvement 
in 
progression-free 
survival 2 was seen with lenalidomide maintenance in 
transplantation-eligible patients (figure 6A) and in 
transplantation-ineligible patients (figure 6B). In trans-
plantation-eligible patients, median progression-free 
survival was not reached for the lenalidomide group and

A post-hoc analysis of progression-free survival 2 with 
lenalidomide compared with observation in different

Because of the apparent benefit of lenalidomide 
maintenance on progression-free survival 2, we did some 
post-hoc exploratory analyses looking at factors that might 
have affected overall survival outcomes, particularly in the

transplantation-ineligible group. The transplantation-
ineligible group of patients had a higher frequency of non-
myeloma-related deaths (appendix p 25), and a high 
proportion of these patients initially assigned to the 
observation group subsequently received lenalidomide 
(103 [33%] of 316 patients) or ceased treatment before 
disease progression without intolerance (119 [29%] of 407 
patients).
Finally, to take account of all available results of 
lenalidomide as maintenance therapy for patients with 
multiple myeloma, we did a summary meta-analysis of 
our data with those previously published, including 3179 
patients. These results show the HR for overall survival 
with the use of a lenalidomide maintenance regimen was 
0·72 (95% CI 0·56–0·91; appendix p 24).
The heterogeneity statistic I²=54·6 indicated potential 
moderate heterogeneity. However, this heterogeneity 
could be considered of questionable importance given 
that all studies showed consistent treatment effects in 
favour of lenalidomide. No analysis of risk of bias was 
undertaken.
Discussion
In this phase 3, open-label, randomised trial—which is, 
to our knowledge, the largest of its kind—lenalidomide 
main 
tenance significantly improved progression-free 
survival compared with observation in adult patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. However, 
overall survival was not improved with this treatment 
regimen in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The progression-free survival benefit of maintenance 
therapy with lenalidomide seems to continue through the 
subsequent line of therapy with progression-free survival 
2 significantly improved with lenalidomide compared 
with observation in both transplantation-eligible and 
trans 
plantation-ineligible patients. This finding suggests 
that lenalidomide maintenance might not negatively 
affect the activity of subsequent treatment by selecting for 
more aggressive or drug-resistant myeloma clones. This 
hypo 
thesis is also supported by previous analyses 
indicating that lenalidomide maintenance did not increase 
genomic change or mutational load.26,27
A prespecified subgroup analysis suggested that 
continuous lenalidomide improved overall survival in 
transplantation-eligible patients but not in transplantation-
ineligible patients. We speculate that any overall survival 
benefit in trans 
plantation-ineligible patients might have 
been attenuated by a high proportion of patients ceasing 
treatment prematurely and those initially randomised to

treatment. Long-term follow-up of this study is planned 
and will specifically examine the effect of these factors on 
outcomes. Additional secondary and exploratory end-
points including response, survival after progression, 
time to progression, time to next line of treatment, 
changes in mean paraprotein during protocol treatment, 
and time to improved response will also be presented 
subsequently.
An adverse cytogenetic profile is a major risk factor 
for relapse, and outcomes for patients with high-risk 
cytogenetics are poor.1,3,28 Data supporting the use of 
lenalidomide maintenance in patients with adverse 
cytogenetics are scarce, and results thus far have been 
inconclusive. In the IFM-2005-02 trial,7 lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy improved median progression-
free survival in patients with del(17p) compared with 
observation (29 months vs 14 months), whereas those

with t(4;14) did not have a benefit (28 months vs 24 
months), probably because of the small sample size.
Our study has limitations. Although the Myeloma XI 
had a much larger sample size than that of previous 
studies, our subgroup analyses were not powered and 
therefore are not conclusive and warrant further 
investigation. Additionally, cytogenetic data were not 
available for all patients, further reducing the sample size, 
and should be interpreted with caution. However, baseline 
characteristics and outcomes were similar between 
patients with and without cytogenetic data available.
Another limitation of the trial is the lack of prospectively 
collected quality-of-life data. However, given that the time 
until first disease progression is often when patients with 
myeloma have a better quality of life, the improvement in 
progression-free survival and progression-free survival 2 
seen in our study suggests the use of maintenance 
lenalidomide would be of benefit in the transplantation-
ineligible setting.
Cytogenetic high risk has been defined by several 
groups using different markers. In our previous study,3 
we identified adverse cytogenetic abnormalities as 
gain(1q), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), or del(17p), with 
standard risk (no adverse cytogenetic abnormalities); 
high risk (one adverse cytogenetic abnormality), or ultra-
high risk (two or more adverse cytogenetic abnormalities) 
groups identified, and this classification was used in our 
prespecified analysis. Other groups limit the high-risk 
classification to patients with t(4;14) or del(17p). The size 
of the Myeloma XI study has enabled us to examine the 
data using both of these classification systems. 
Nevertheless, 
lenalidomide 
main 
tenance 
cannot 
equilibrate the outcomes for high-risk patients to those 
of standard risk, and patients with high-risk lesions still 
have 
adverse 
outcomes. 
Strategies 
combining 
maintenance lenalidomide with additional agents might 
be beneficial and could be investigated. In the Myeloma 
XI trial, a separate group of patients received vorinostat 
plus lenalidomide in the maintenance randomisation 
because of a protocol amendment, and the outcomes of 
these patients will be reported elsewhere. Other potential 
combinations would be to combine main 
tenance 
lenalidomide with a well tolerated proteasome inhibitor 
or CD38 antibody.
The results of this trial are consistent with previous 
findings from phase 3 trials of lenalidomide maintenance 
therapy. In transplantation-eligible patients, three studies 
have shown that the addition of lenalidomide main-
tenance after autologous stem-cell transplantation 
reduces the risk of progression or death by approximately 
50% compared with placebo or no maintenance.7–9 A 
significant improvement in overall survival has only 
been observed in one previous trial,8 although a recent 
meta-analysis did suggest an overall survival improve-
ment in patients treated with lenalidomide in this 
setting.15 To take account of all available results so far 
now including the Myeloma XI study, we did a summary 
data meta-analysis, which showed that lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy reduced the risk of death.
For transplantation-ineligible patients with multiple 
myeloma, a significant improvement in progression-free 
survival has been reported when lenalidomide main-
tenance was given after a regimen of melphalan, 
prednisone, and lenalidomide (median progression-free 
survival from start of induction 31 months vs 14 months); 
the 3-year overall survival in this study was 70% with 
maintenance and 62% without maintenance therapy.29 
Furthermore, in a study comparing treatment with 
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone given either 
continuously or for a limited number of cycles,21 
continuous treatment significantly improved progression-
free survival (median 26 months vs 21 months from start 
of induction, HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·60–0·81) but there was 
no difference in overall survival (median 59·1 months vs 
62·3 months, 1·02, 0·86–1·20). Taken together, these 
observations suggest that alternative approaches to 
improving overall survival in older patients who are not 
eligible for transplantation are warranted.
The current findings with lenalidomide maintenance 
compare favourably to those achieved with other novel 
therapies in the maintenance setting. Thalidomide has 
been shown to improve progression-free survival when 
given as maintenance therapy in the Myeloma IX trial 
(median progression-free survival 22 months vs 15 
months; HR 1·44, 95% CI 1·22–1·70; p<0·0001), but the 
median overall survival was similar in both groups (60 
months vs 60 months; 0·96, 0·79–1·17; p=0·70).10,30 In a 
subgroup analysis, patients with high-risk status receiving 
thalidomide had no progression-free survival or overall 
survival benefit. By contrast, in this current study, we 
have shown that lenalidomide improves progression-free 
survival irrespective of cytogenetic risk status, which 
might be due to mechanistic differences between these 
drugs. Although thalidomide and lenalidomide share a 
similar mechanism of action, recent studies suggest that 
subtle variations in the chemical structure between the 
molecules can modulate the range of substrates targeted 
for degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to 
different downstream effects.31 In the Myeloma XI trial, 
few patients discontinued because of adverse events or 
patient preference and there was no evidence of 
cumulative toxicity. The risk of second primary 
malignancies was increased in patients treated with 
maintenance lenalidomide, but the 3-year cumulative 
incidence of second primary malignancies remained low 
in both treatment groups.
In summary, lenalidomide maintenance therapy 
significantly improved progression-free survival in 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
compared with observation, but overall survival was not 
improved in the intention-to-treat analysis across the 
whole trial population. Additionally, prespecified sub-
groups analyses by cytogenetic risk and transplantation 
status suggested a progression-free survival benefit across
