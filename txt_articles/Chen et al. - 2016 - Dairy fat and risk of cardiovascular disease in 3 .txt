ABSTRACT
Background: Few prospective studies have examined dairy fat in
relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the association between dairy fat
and incident CVD in US adults.
Design: We followed 43,652 men in the Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study (1986–2010), 87,907 women in the Nurses’ Health Study
(1980–2012), and 90,675 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II
(1991–2011). Dairy fat and other fat intakes were assessed every 4 y
with the use of validated food-frequency questionnaires.
Results: During 5,158,337 person-years of follow-up, we docu-
mented 14,815 incident CVD cases including 8974 coronary heart
disease cases (nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal coronary
disease) and 5841 stroke cases. In multivariate analyses, com-
pared with an equivalent amount of energy from carbohydrates
(excluding fruit and vegetables), dairy fat intake was not signif-
icantly related to risk of total CVD (for a 5% increase in energy
from dairy fat, the RR was 1.02; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.05), coronary
heart disease (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.09), or stroke (RR: 0.99;
95% CI: 0.93, 1.05) (P . 0.05 for all). In models in which we
estimated the effects of exchanging different fat sources, the re-
placement of 5% of energy intake from dairy fat with equivalent
energy intake from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) or vegeta-
ble fat was associated with 24% (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.81)
and 10% (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93) lower risk of CVD,
respectively, whereas the 5% energy intake substitution of other
animal fat with dairy fat was associated with 6% increased CVD
risk (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09).
Conclusions: The replacement of animal fats, including dairy fat,
with vegetable sources of fats and PUFAs may reduce risk of
CVD. Whether the food matrix may modify the effect of dairy
fat on health outcomes warrants further investigation.

INTRODUCTION
Dairy fats are predominantly saturated fat, and dairy prod-
ucts are major food sources of saturated fat and contribute to
approximately one-fifth of total saturated fat intake in the US
diet (1). Saturated fat intake increases LDL cholesterol (2)
and may induce chronic inflammation (3), and, thus, may
increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)9 (4). Con-
versely, specific fatty acids (FAs) in dairy have been associ-
ated with lower cardiometabolic risk (2, 5, 6). Prospective
cohort studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the
association between dairy products and CVD risk regardless
of dairy fat contents (7). Few epidemiologic studies have
examined the relation between dairy fat intake and CVD. A
recent cohort study showed no significant association between
circulating biomarkers of dairy fat and stroke (8); however,
the relation of dairy fat intake with CVD risk remains unclear
and may largely depend on replacement foods and nutrients.
A previous meta-analysis showed that the replacement of
saturated fat with carbohydrates was not associated with
coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but the replacement of
saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat was associated with
significantly lower risk (9). Recently, other meta-analyses did
not find a significant association between saturated fat and
coronary disease risk (10) or butter and CVD risk (11), which
has led to a debate over the role of major food sources of
saturated fat such as dairy products in a healthy dietary pat-
tern (10). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the
relation between dairy fat intake and risk of CVD in 3 large
cohorts of US adults with an emphasis on specific replace-
ment sources of energy.

 METHODS
Study population
We used data from the following 3 prospective cohort studies:
the HPFS (Health Professionals Follow-Up Study), the NHS
(Nurses’ Health Study), and the NHS II. The HPFS was com-
posed of 51,529 US male dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians,
optometrists, osteopathic physicians, and podiatrists, aged 40–75 y,
who returned a baseline questionnaire that inquired about
detailed medical histories as well as lifestyles and usual diets
in 1986. The NHS was initiated in 1976 when 121,700 female
registered nurses, aged 30–55 y, who lived in 1 of 11 states
completed a baseline questionnaire about their lifestyle and
medical histories. In 1980, 92,468 nurses completed a food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which was treated as the
baseline for the NHS. The NHS II was established in 1989 and
consisted of 116,671 younger female registered nurses, aged
25–42 y, who completed a baseline questionnaire that was
similar to the NHS questionnaire, and 97,604 nurses of the
NHS II responded to a FFQ in 1991. Detailed descriptions of
the 3 cohorts have been published elsewhere (12–14). In all 3
cohorts, questionnaires were administered at baseline and bi-
ennially thereafter to collect and update information on lifestyle
practice and the occurrence of chronic diseases. The cumulative
follow-up of participants in all of these cohorts was .90% of
potential person-times.
In the current analysis, we excluded men and women who had
diagnoses of diabetes, cancer, CVD, or coronary artery surgery
before completion of the baseline dietary questionnaires (15). In
addition, we excluded participants who left $10 of 131 food
items blank on the baseline FFQ (except in the NHS in 1980
when the FFQ had 61 items) or who reported unusual total
energy intakes (i.e., daily energy intake ,800 or .4200 kcal for
men and ,500 or .3500 kcal for women). We also excluded
participants without baseline information on dairy consumption
or follow-up information on the date of CVD diagnosis. After
exclusions, data from 43,652 HPFS participants, 87,907 NHS
participants, and 90,675 NHS II participants were available
for analysis (Supplemental Figure 1). The study protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health.
Assessment of dairy fat
In 1980, a 61-item FFQ was administered to NHS participants
to collect information on their usual intakes of foods and bev-
erages in the previous year. In 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998,
2002, 2006, and 2010, similar but expanded FFQs with w131
items were sent to these participants to update their diet records.
Dietary data were collected with the use of similar expanded
FFQs in1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006 from the HPFS
participants and in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 from NHS
II participants.
In all FFQs, we asked participants how often, on average, they
consumed a specified amount of each food. There were 9 possible
responses, which ranged from never or ,1 time/mo to $6 times/d.
Nutrient intake was calculated with the use of food-composition
databases primarily from USDA sources (16). Questionnaire
items on dairy products included skim and low fat milk, whole
milk, ice cream, yogurt, cottage and ricotta cheese, cream cheese,
other cheese, and cream. From 1994 in the NHS and HPFS and
from 1995 in the NHS II, yogurt consumption was separated
into 2 items of plain yogurt (plain or with NutraSweet) and
flavored yogurt (without NutraSweet). Standard serving sizes
were an 80-oz glass (240 mL) for skim milk, low-fat milk, and
whole milk, 1 tbsp (20 g) for cream and sour cream, 0.5 cups
(122.5 g) for sherbet or frozen yogurt, ice cream, cottage, and
ricotta cheese, and 1 oz (30 g) for cream cheese and other
cheese. The reproducibility and validity of these FFQs have
been described in detail elsewhere (17–21). Correlation co-
efficients between FFQs and multiple dietary records were 0.62
both for low-fat dairy and high-fat dairy foods (21), and cor-
relation coefficients for specific dairy foods ranged from 0.57
for hard cheese to 0.97 for yogurt (17).
Dairy fat intake as well as intakes of other fats were summed
across food sources and converted to nutrient densities that
reflected intake as a percentage of total energy consumed. Values
for the amounts of dietary fats and other nutrients in the foods
were obtained from the Harvard University Food Composition
Database, which is derived from USDA sources (22), and sup-
plemented with information from manufacturers. In a valida-
tion study (20), the specific types of fat intake were ascertained
reasonably well compared with four 1-wk dietary records col-
lected over 1 y. Correlation coefficients between dairy fat intake
(percentage of total fat) and 2 dairy plasma biomarkers, which
themselves are highly variable indirect measures of dairy fat,
were 0.22 (P , 0.05) for plasma pentadecanoic acid (15:0) and
0.16 (P , 0.05) for plasma heptadecanoic acid (17:0) in the
NHS and HPFS (8).
Assessment of covariates
In the biennial follow-up questionnaires, we inquired about
and updated information on risk factors for chronic diseases such
as body weight, cigarette smoking, physical activity, medication
use, and history of chronic diseases, including diabetes, hyper-
tension, and hypercholesterolemia. In NHS and NHS II participants,
we ascertained menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use,
and oral contraceptive use in the questionnaires.
Assessment of study outcome
In the current analysis, CVD outcomes were comprised of
CHD, including nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD,
and stroke (nonfatal or fatal). Nonfatal myocardial infarction was
classified as confirmed if the criteria of the WHO were met
specifically on the basis of symptoms and either electrocardio-
graphic changes or elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations (23).
Stroke cases were classified according to the criteria of the
National Survey of Stroke (24), which required evidence of
a neurologic deficit with a sudden or rapid onset that persisted
.24 h. A pathologically confirmed cerebrovascular condition
that was due to infection, trauma, or malignancy was excluded.
Participants who reported a new diagnosis were asked for
permission to access their medical records for the purpose of
confirmation. Study physicians, who were blinded to the expo-
sure status of participants, reviewed the medical records. CHD
and stroke events for which confirmatory information was ob-
tained by interview or letter but without medical records were
designated as probable.

 Deaths were identified by reports from next of kin or postal
authorities or by searching the National Death Index. At least
98% of deaths in study participants were identified with the use of
these methods (25). Fatal CHD was defined as International
Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm), codes 410–412. Fatal CHD was confirmed
via medical records or autopsy reports or if CHD was listed as
the cause of death on the death certificate and there was previous
evidence of CHD in the medical records. Similarly, we used
International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, codes
430–434 to define fatal stroke and followed the same procedures
to classify confirmed or probable fatal stroke cases. Because the
exclusion of probable CVD events did not alter the results, we
included both confirmed and probable CHD and strokes in the
analysis to maximize the statistical power. Unconfirmed CHD
and stroke cases were censored in the analysis.
Statistical analysis
We calculated each individual’s person-years from the date of
return of the baseline questionnaire to the date of diagnosis of
CVD, death, or the end of the follow-up (31 January 2010 for the
HPFS; 30 June 2012 for the NHS; and 30 June 2011 for the NHS
II), whichever came first. We used time-dependent Cox pro-
portional hazard regression to estimate the HR for dairy con-
sumption in relation to risk of CVD. Our basic model included
age, calendar time with updated information at each 2-y ques-
tionnaire cycle, BMI, and total energy intake. We further adjusted
for ethnicity, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption,
menopausal status and menopausal hormone use (NHS and NHS
II participants only), oral contraceptive use (NHS II participants
only), baseline diagnosed hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.
In the final model, we further adjusted the dietary factors, in-
cluding dietary intakes of fruit, vegetables, coffee, protein, vege-
table fat, and other animal fat. Coefficients from the final model
were interpreted as the estimated effect of substituting a specific
percentage of energy from dairy fat for the same percentage of
energy from carbohydrates (excluding fruit and vegetables). When
the effects of substituting other types of fat for dairy fat were
estimated, the difference in the coefficients between fat sources
and their covariances were used to calculate RRs and 95% CIs for
the substitution effects (26). The same model was used to estimate
the effects of substituting different sources of carbohydrates (i.e.,
from whole grains or refined grains and added sugars) for dairy fat.
We used the cumulative average of fat intakes from baseline
to the censoring events to best represent a long-term diet and
minimize the within-personvariation (15), and we stopped updating
dietary information after a self-reported diagnosis of intermediate
outcomes including angina, coronary artery surgery or angioplasty,
or diabetes during follow-up.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested with the use
of a time-dependent interaction variable between dairy intake and
months to events (P . 0.05 for all tests). To test for linear trend,
the median value was assigned to each quintile, and this value
was modeled as a continuous variable. All analyses were con-
ducted separately in each cohort, and the results were combined
by a meta-analyses approach across the 3 studies. Fixed-effect
models were used because no significant heterogeneities were
shown. All statistical tests were 2-sided and performed with the
use of SAS software (version 9.2 for UNIX; SAS Institute Inc.).
RESULTS
We documented 5825 incident CVD cases including 4422 CHD
and 1403 stroke cases during #24 y of follow-up in the HPFS,
8018 CVD cases (4055 CHD and 3963 stroke cases) during #32 y
of follow-up in the NHS, and 972 cases (497 CHD and 475 stroke
cases) during #20 y of follow-up in the NHS II. For both men and
women, at baseline, dairy fat intake was inversely associated with
a history of hypertension or hypercholesterolemia, cereal fiber,
glycemic load, the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat, and
intake of fruit and vegetables but positively associated with coffee
intake (Table 1).
Dairy fat was not associated with risk of CVD in age- and
multivariate-adjusted models across the 3 cohorts, as shown in
Table 2. For a 5% increase in energy from dairy fat compared
with an equivalent amount of energy from carbohydrates (ex-
cluding fruit and vegetables), RRs were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.98,
1.05) for CVD, 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.09) for CHD, and 0.99
(95% CI: 0.93, 1.05) for stroke. The findings were similar in
participants who did not have hypercholesterolemia and did not
report any cholesterol-lowering medications at baseline, with
RRs of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.05) for CVD, 1.02 (95% CI: 0.96,
1.07) for CHD, and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.05) for stroke per 5%
increase in energy intake from dairy fat (data not shown).
Compared with 5% of energy intake from dairy fat, the same
amount of energy from vegetable fat was significantly associated
with a 10% decreased risk of CVD (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87,
0.93), an 11% decreased risk of CHD (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.85,
0.93), and an 8% lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97)
(Figure 1). Similarly, the replacement of dairy fat with poly-
unsaturated fat was associated with a significantly lower risk of
CVD (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.81), CHD (RR: 0.74; 95%
CI: 0.68, 0.81), and stroke (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.88) (Figure 1).
The replacement of 5% of energy from dairy fat with n–6 PUFA
was associated with a 25% lower risk of CVD (RR: 0.75; 95% CI:
0.70, 0.81). The replacement of 0.3% of energy from dairy fat with
a-linoleic acid and marine n–3 FA was associated with 14%
(RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.90) and 11% (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.84,
0.94) lower risks of CVD, respectively (Figure 1).
In contrast, the substitution of 5% energy intake from other
animal fat for dairy fat was significantly associated with a 6%
higher risk of CVD (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09), CHD (RR:
1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10), and stroke (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00,
1.11) (Figure 1). We did not observe a significant benefit of
replacing dairy fat with the same energy intake from refined
starch and added sugar (P . 0.05 for CVD, CHD, and stroke)
(Figure 1), but the substitution of 5% of energy from dairy fat by
carbohydrates from whole grains was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of CVD (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.75), CHD
(RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.70), and stroke (RR: 0.84; 95% CI:
0.78, 0.91) (Figure 1). We conducted a sensitivity analysis with
further adjustment for total trans-fat intake, and the results re-
mained virtually the same (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In 3 prospective cohorts of US men and women, we showed
that, compared with an equivalent amount of energy from car-
bohydrates (excluding fruit and vegetables), intake of dairy fat
was not associated with risk of CVD. However, the replacement
of dairy fat with vegetable sources of fat or PUFA was associated

DAIRY FAT AND CVD

 with significantly lower risk of CVD, whereas the replacement of
dairy fat with other animal sources of fat was associated with
slightly higher risk of CVD. These associations were similar for
CHD and stroke. The results suggest that, compared with dairy
fat, vegetable sources of fat and PUFA are a better choice for
reducing risks of CHD, stroke, and total CVD, although other
animal fat (e.g., from meats) may be a less healthy choice than
dairy fat. In addition, we showed that types of carbohydrates
made a difference; the replacement of dairy fat with high-quality
carbohydrates such as whole grains was associated with lower
risk of CVD, but the replacement with refined starch and added
sugar did not appear beneficial.
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale prospective study
to examine dairy fat intake and its replacement with other types of
fat in relation to CVD risk. Other smaller prospective cohort
studies have examined associations between dairy intake and
CVD risk, and findings have been conflicting (27–30). Some
studies that stratified dairy intake by the fat content showed
a positive association of high-fat dairy with CHD (31, 32) and
inverse associations of low-fat dairy consumption with CHD
(31) and stroke (33). A meta-analysis suggested a modest in-
verse association between milk and overall CVD risk but no
significant associations between high-fat and low-fat dairy in-
takes and CHD (27). Another meta-analysis suggested minimal
associations between butter intake and risks of diabetes, CHD,
and mortality (11). This result was not surprising because butter
was largely compared with calories from refined starch, sugar,
potatoes, and meats. In the current study, we were able to make
comparisons with specific sources of calories and confirmed that
the replacement of dairy fat with vegetable fats or high quality
carbohydrates such as whole grains was associated with reduced
risk of CVD.
Dairy fat consists of w60% SFAs (34, 35), which are mostly
long-chain SFAs including lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic
acid, and stearic acid. Compared with unsaturated FAs, myristic
acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid increase LDL cholesterol
and apolipoprotein B concentrations and the LDL-to-HDL ratio
(36, 37). Compared with other SFAs, stearic acid tended to
lower LDL cholesterol (2, 37). Besides SFAs, dairy fat consists
of 5% trans FAs, which are naturally occurring in the milk of
ruminant animals. These trans FAs can be biomarkers of dairy
fat intake because trans FAs cannot be synthesized by humans
(38). Although trans 18:1n–7 (vaccenic acid) is the major trans
isomer in dairy fat, its correlation with dairy fat intake is weak
probably because this trans isomer not only exists in dairy
products but also in partially hydrogenated oils (39). A study by
Sun et al. (38) suggested that trans palmitoleic acid (trans
16:1n–7) might be a more-robust biomarker for dairy fat intake,
and its circulating concentration was associated with higher
LDL cholesterol but also with lower triglycerides and blood
pressure. However, no association was shown between circu-
lating trans palmitoleate and risk of ischemic heart disease (38)
or stroke (8). For other health outcomes such as diabetes, trans
palmitoleic acid was associated with a lower fasting insulin
concentration and incident diabetes in a multiethnic US cohort
(40). Furthermore, circulating concentrations of the 2 odd-chain
FAs pentadecanoic acid and heptadecanoic acid have reasonable
correlations with dairy fat intake and, thus, may be considered as
weak biomarkers of dairy fat (8, 38). In a large prospective
cohort, pentadecanoic acid was associated with higher risk of

 ischemic heart disease (38), but neither pentadecanoic acid nor
heptadecanoic acid were significantly associated with risk of
stroke in 2 large prospective cohorts (8). On the basis of a meta-
analysis of 4 studies, circulating heptadecanoic acid was asso-
ciated with significantly lower risk of coronary outcomes (10).
However, it is unclear whether this inverse association repre-
sents the effects of dairy products, human metabolism, or un-
known confounding factors.
Saturated fat, which is a major content of dairy fat, could affect
the blood lipid profile and promote atherosclerosis and CVD. In
a meta-analysis, saturated fat was not significantly associated
with risk of CHD compared with the effect of carbohydrates (41).
In contrast, the replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated
fat was associated with lower risk (9). Our results on dairy fat are
consistent with the overall findings for saturated fat, whereby the
replacement of dairy fat with vegetable fat or PUFA was asso-
ciated with lower risk of CVD. Future studies regarding different
food sources of vegetable fat or PUFA are warranted. Ramsden
et al. (42) observed that the replacement of saturated fat with
vegetable oils that were rich in linoleic acid significantly reduced
serum cholesterol by 13.8% (compared with a 1% reduction in
the control), but the reduction in serum cholesterol did not lead to
an expected reduction in CVD mortality. However, the study was
hampered by a short duration of intervention (average: 1 y),
extremely high rates of dropouts, and potential confounding by
the trans-fat content in the vegetable oils.
The strengths of the current study include a large sample size,
a high rate of follow-up, and repeated assessments of dietary and
lifestyle variables. The current study is also subject to limitations.
First, our study populations primarily consisted of health pro-
fessionals with European ancestry. Therefore, the observed as-
sociations may not be generalizable to other populations.
However, previous findings from our cohorts were generally
similar to those observed in other populations. Also, the high
educational level of our subjects was an advantage because high-
quality and reliable data could be collected from our study
participants. In addition, the relative homogeneity of socioeco-
nomic status helped reduce confounding. Second, the measure-
ment error of a dairy fat assessment is inevitable. However, the
FFQs used in these studies were validated against multiple diet
records, and reasonable correlation coefficients between these
assessments of dairy intake were observed. Moreover, we cal-
culated cumulative averages from many repeated questionnaires
for dietary variables to minimize random-measurement errors
that might have been caused by the within-person variation and to
accommodate diet changes over time. Third, we were unable to
evaluate the impact of the food matrix on the association between
dairy fat intake and CVD in the current analysis. Previous clinical
trials that examined dairy foods with known fat contents have
shown effects of the food matrix on blood lipids independent of
the dairy fat content. For example, the LDL-cholesterol–raising
effect of dairy fat in cheese was less than that of butter at
comparable intakes of total fat and saturated fat (43), which was
confirmed by the meta-analysis of clinical trials that the con-
sumption of hard cheese lowers LDL cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol compared with the consumption of butter (44). A
detailed analysis of our cohorts and an updated meta-analysis
showed that the regular consumption of yogurt was associated
with lower risk of type 2 diabetes independent of BMI and other
diabetes risk (45). Therefore, whether the food matrix may
modify the effect of dairy fat on health outcomes warrants
further investigation. Last, because of the observational nature
of our cohorts, although we adjusted for established and po-
tential risk factors for CVD, unmeasured and residual con-
founding was still possible.
In conclusion, we showed that, compared with carbohydrates in
the diet, dairy fat is not associated with risk of CVD. However, the
substitution of dairy fat with vegetable or polyunsaturated fats is
associated with lower risk of CVD, whereas the replacement of
dairy fat with other animal fat is associated with slightly higher
CVD risk. In addition, the replacement of dairy fat with high-quality
carbohydrates from whole grains is associated with lower risk of
CVD. These results support current recommendations to replace
animal fats, including dairy fat, with vegetable sources of fats and
polyunsaturated fat (both n–6 and n–3) in the prevention of CVD.
