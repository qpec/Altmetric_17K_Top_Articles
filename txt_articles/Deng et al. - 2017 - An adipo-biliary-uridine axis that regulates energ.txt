INTRODUCTION: Uridine is a pyrimidine nu-
cleoside that is critical for cellular function
and survival. In addition to its role in RNA
and DNA biosynthesis, uridine is required for
glycogen deposition, protein and lipid glyco-
sylation, extracellular matrix biosynthesis, and
detoxification of xenobiotics. Plasma uridine
levels are maintained within a narrow range,
and most cells depend on a readily available
pool of uridine in plasma to maintain basic cel-
lular functions. Enhanced understanding of
the physiological mechanisms controlling bio-
synthesis and clearance of this metabolite has
the potential to shed light on several disease
states, including diabetes, cancer, and neuro-
logical disorders.
RATIONALE: Despite its pivotal physiological
role, uridine has received limited attention
in comparison to other nucleosides such as
adenosine. Studying rodent models, we set out
to define the mechanisms regulating plasma
uridine levels and to dissect the molecular
circuitry whereby uridine governs energy ho-
meostasis in normal and obese conditions.
RESULTS: One of our key findings is that plas-
ma uridine levels are subject to tight regula-
tion during feeding and fasting in both rodents
and humans. Plasma uridine levels are elevat-
ed during fasting and drop rapidly in the post-
prandial state. We demonstrate that liver is the
predominant biosynthetic organ and contrib-
utor to plasma uridine in the fed state, whereas
the adipocyte dominates uridine biosynthetic
activity in the fasted state. Both glucose and
uridine levels must be maintained in the fasted
state, not only as basic building blocks for mac-
romolecule biosynthesis, but also as fuels for
metabolically active cell types such as neurons.
We find that the fasting-induced rise in uri-
dine is tightly linked to a drop in core body tem-
perature driven by a reduction in metabolic rate.
The fasting-induced drop in body temperature,
although small, is highly reproducible and seen
in both rodents and humans. Plasma uridine ho-
meostasis thus links thermoregulation to the
fasting/refeedingcycle.Leptin
signaling governs uridine-
dependentthermoregulation
such that leptin deficiency
amplifies fasting-induced
declines in core temper-
ature.Conversely,prolonged
exposure to a high-fat diet blunts the fasting-
induced body temperature drop. We clarify the
mechanism underlying the rapid reduction of
plasma uridine upon refeeding, which involves
both reduction of uridine synthesis in adipocytes
and enhancement of its clearance through the bile.
Uridine from the digestive tract has a differ-
ent fate than uridine derived biosynthetically
from the adipocyte in the fasted state. Adipose
tissue–derived uridine increases plasma uridine
concentrations, which in turn elicit a hypotha-
lamic response culminating in body temper-
ature lowering. In contrast, gut-derived uridine
is never fully released into the circulation, but
rather is rapidly resorbed into bile again and
effectively reused as part of an enterohepatic
recycling process. This minimizes the effects of
postprandial uridine absorption, obviating an
impact on temperature control in the fed state.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that plasma
uridine concentrations in mammals are regu-
lated by fasting/refeeding. Adi-
pocytes are key contributors to
uridine supply during fasting,
whereas biliary excretion is
the primary mechanism for
uridine clearance following
food intake. Bile-mediated uri-
dine release promotes body
temperature declines during
fasting and enhances insulin
sensitivityina leptin-dependent
manner. Because nutrient
intake triggers bile release,
our work identifies a meta-
bolic regulatory model in
which feeding behavior di-
rectly regulates plasma uri-
dine homeostasis, which then
alters energy balance through
thermoregulation.▪

Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside present at high levels in the plasma of rodents and
humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential
cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine levels are regulated by fasting
and refeeding in mice, rats, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine levels, and this
increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine levels
through biliary clearance. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body
temperature that occurs during fasting. Further, feeding-induced clearance of plasma
uridine improves glucose metabolism. We also present findings that implicate leptin
signaling in uridine homeostasis and consequent metabolic control and thermoregulation.
Our results indicate that plasma uridine governs energy homeostasis and
thermoregulation in a mechanism involving adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis
and leptin signaling.
U
ridine is a uracil nucleoside that plays a
critical role as a building block for RNA
and DNA biosynthesis (1, 2). It also serves to
generate pyrimidine-lipid and pyrimidine-
sugar conjugates required for glycogen
deposition, protein and lipid glycosylation, extra-
cellular matrix biosynthesis, and detoxification
of xenobiotics (1, 2). These anabolic reactions
are critical for normal cellular function and sur-
vival. In addition, uridine catabolism by uridine
phosphorylase may regulate events important to
systemic metabolism, such as body temperature
and circadian rhythm (3). Despite its important
physiologic and pharmacological roles, uridine
has received much less research emphasis than
adenosine (3).
Plasma uridine concentrations are tightly
regulated in both humans and rodents, but the
mechanisms underlying homeostasis of cir-
culating uridine are unknown (2). The liver is
considered the major organ controlling plasma
uridine levels, mediating de novo biosynthesis
within hepatocytes and uridine clearance via
Kupffer cells (4, 5). The majority of plasma uridine
is degraded by the liver after uptake through
the portal vein. However, the processes by which
the liver regulates uridine degradation, and the
biological effects of this massive clearance pro-
cess, have not been studied.
A constant supply of circulating uridine is
required for a number of biological functions
(2, 6), and disruption of plasma uridine ho-
meostasis through uridine supplementation has
profound effects on systemic metabolism (7).
Short-term supplementation of uridine in food
improves insulin sensitivity in mice, but long-
term administration causes fatty liver and pro-
motes development of pre-diabetes. Thus, control
of plasma uridine is tightly coupled to energy
homeostasis.
Previous work suggests that uridine affects both
body temperature and feeding behavior. For exam-
ple, injection of high doses of uridine decreases
body temperature in rodents (8). Co-administration
of uridine and benzylacyclouridine, a compound
that inhibits uridine degradation, partially pre-
vents this temperature drop (8, 9). In addition,
elevated plasma uridine can increase brain (hy-
pothalamic) levels of uridine diphosphate (UDP),
which then promotes food intake via P2Y2-
dependent activation of AgRP (Agouti-related
protein) neurons (10). Here, we investigated
mechanisms by which feeding behavior reg-
ulates body temperature and plasma uridine
levels.
Fasting and refeeding regulate plasma
uridine concentrations
Because fasting leads to a number of physio-
logical adaptations, we set out to determine
whether this process is associated with dynamic
regulation of plasma uridine. In C57BL/6 mice,
plasma uridine levels doubled upon 24 hours
of fasting (4.96 ± 0.76 mM versus 8.89 ± 1.02 mM,
P < 0.0001) and recovered to basal levels 4 hours
after refeeding (3.86 ± 0.54 mM) (Fig. 1A). Rats
manifested a similar elevation in plasma uri-
dine after an overnight fast (5.61 ± 0.71 mM ver-
sus 9.74 ± 2.24 mM, P < 0.001), but the levels did
not return to basal levels even 24 hours after
refeeding (Fig. 1B). In healthy human subjects
(table S1), a single meal following an overnight
fast reduced plasma uridine levels by 40.3 ± 10.3%
within 4 hours (4.63 ± 0.75 mM after overnight
fast versus 1.84 ± 0.44 mM 4 hours after meal, P <
0.001) (Fig. 1C). There was no postprandial change
in plasma uric acid concentrations in the human
subjects (Fig. 1D), indicating that the change in
plasma uridine levels that results from fasting
and refeeding is unlikely to be due to general-
ized nucleotide catabolism.
Plasma uridine links thermoregulation
to fasting and refeeding
In rodents, fasting and refeeding triggers body
temperature changes that allow the animal to
adapt to the altered nutrient status. Previous re-
ports show that administration of high-dose
uridine (3500 mg/kg) resulted in severe hypo-
thermia of 6° to 10°C in mice (8). To test whether
uridine plays a role in thermoregulation, we
injected mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with uridine
at a reduced dose (1000 mg/kg) to avoid severe
hypothermia. We found that this treatment rap-
idly lowered body temperature [37.9° ± 0.9°C,
34.9° ± 0.7°C, and 34.0° ± 1.6°C at 0, 15, and
30 min after uridine injection, P < 0.01 com-
pared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injec-
tion]. This drop in temperature was then partially
recovered within 60 min (36.0° ± 0.9°C, P < 0.01
compared to PBS injection) (Fig. 2A).
Obesity, a pandemic now seen throughout
the world (11), displays characteristic abnor-
malities in thermoregulation (12). To test this
in a preclinical model and to explore the po-
tential role of leptin, we studied two animal
models: leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and wild-
type mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). We found
that when wild-type mice fed a chow diet were
fasted for 24 hours, their body temperature
dropped 1.8° ± 0.5°C (n = 6, P < 0.05). Howev-
er, when chow-fed leptin-deficient ob/ob mice
were fasted for 24 hours, the effect was more
striking: Their body temperature dropped by
7.3° ± 2.7°C (n = 6, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). These
findings confirm that leptin-deficient mice have
defects in maintaining normal body temper-
ature (13); however, it is unclear whether this is
the direct result of leptin deficiency or a general
phenomenon due to obesity.
To address this, we compared the body tem-
perature response to fasting and refeeding in
HFD-fed wild-type mice and HFD-fed ob/ob mice.
In HFD-fed wild-type mice, the body temper-
ature drop triggered by 24 hours of fasting
(1.2° ± 0.6°C, n = 6, P < 0.01) was similar to that
elicited by fasting in chow-fed wild-type mice
(1.8° ± 0.5°C, n = 6, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). By contrast,

 when ob/ob mice were fed HFD for 6 weeks, their
body temperature drop triggered by 24 hours
of fasting was reduced to 2.3° ± 1.3°C (n = 6, P <
0.01) (Fig. 2B). Thus, although both the HFD
and ob/ob mice are obese and are widely used
for studies of insulin resistance, the fasting re-
sponse in HFD-fed wild-type animals differs
from the fasting response in ob/ob mice. To-
gether, these data lend credence to a model in
which leptin signaling participates in fasting-
induced temperature declines in a manner blunted
by HFD exposure.
To test whether uridine participates in ther-
moregulation during fasting and refeeding, we
analyzed plasma uridine levels in HFD-fed ob/ob
and wild-type mice. We detected higher levels
of plasma uridine in ob/ob mice than in wild-
type mice; conversely, obese HFD-fed wild-type
mice harbored plasma uridine levels compara-
ble to those in lean chow-fed wild-type mice
(Fig. 2C). Fasting further increased plasma uri-
dine levels in ob/ob mice in the first 4 hours after
food removal, but fasting had no effect on plas-
ma uridine levels in HFD-fed wild-type mice
(Fig. 2C). Upon refeeding, ob/ob mice exhibited
a rapid decline in plasma uridine levels, whereas
no significant changes were observed in obese
HFD-fed wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). These data
reveal a strong correlation between plasma uri-
dine levels and thermoregulation and further
highlight the distinct effects of HFD and leptin-
deficiency on body temperature that is media-
ted through plasma uridine.
Uridine-triggered temperature declines in ro-
dents rely on the activity of uridine phospho-
rylase (8), the enzyme responsible for initiation
of uridine catabolism. We hypothesized that
increases in plasma uridine levels during fasting
mediate the temperature drop by increasing uri-
dine availability for degradation. To test this, we
injected ob/ob mice with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-
aspartate (PALA). This compound is an inhibi-
tor of aspartate transcarbamylase (14), which is
the rate-limiting enzyme for uridine biosynthesis
(15) and is part of the trifunctional protein Cad
(carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate
transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase). In this
context, PALA prevented both the drop in body
temperature in ob/ob mice (Fig. 2D) and the ele-
vation of plasma uridine after 24-hour fasting.
These findings support a model in which plasma
uridine levels govern core body temperature.
Uridine links thermoregulation
with leptin
Temperature exchange with the environment
depends on the difference in temperature be-
tween the subject and surrounding environment
and relies on three mechanisms: conduction,
convection, and radiation. To examine whether
the acute temperature drop triggered by uri-
dine is mediated by temperature exchange with
the environment, we housed mice in a near-
thermoneutral environment (29°C), 7°C above
the ambient room temperature used for the
studies depicted in Fig. 2A. Wild-type mice in-
jected with PBS showed a slight increase in
body temperature after they were moved to 29°C
(37.5° ± 0.24°C, 38.3° ± 0.2°C, and 38.1° ± 0.2°
C at 0, 15, and 30 min, respectively; n = 6)
(Fig. 3A). When mice were injected with uri-
dine and subsequently transferred to the 29°C
incubator, the temperature drop seen at ambient
room temperature (Fig. 2A) was no longer ob-
served; rather, the mice displayed a body temper-
ature only slightly lower than that observed with
the PBS injection under the same conditions

 (37.4° ± 0.3°C versus 38.3° ± 0.2°C at 15 min,
36.9° ± 0.4°C versus 38.1° ± 0.2°C at 30 min; n =
6, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). From these experiments,
we conclude that the thermoregulation effects
of uridine rely on temperature exchange with the
ambient environment.
To determine whether uridine reduces heat
production through effects on metabolism, we
housed mice in metabolic cage units and mea-
sured O2 consumption, CO2 production, and res-
piratory exchange ratio (RER). After two baseline
recordings, we injected the mice i.p. with PBS
or uridine and then performed a third recording
5 min later. Because the cages had to be opened
for injections, there was a sudden transient
change in all parameters. Upon equilibration, the
rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production
rapidly recovered to normal levels in the vehicle
group, indicating that metabolic rates were not
affected. In contrast, uridine-injected mice dis-
played a reduced rate of recovery of O2 consump-
tion and CO2 production, reflecting a suppression
of the metabolic rate (Fig. 3, B and C). A reduced
energy demand is another way to reduce heat
production under stress conditions such as hy-
poxia (16). To determine whether a modulation
of energy demand contributes to uridine-related
thermoregulation, we measured the RER, which
was increased within 1 hour after uridine injec-
tion (Fig. 3D). This increase suggests that uri-
dine administration leads to an increase in
carbohydrate consumption instead of lipid use
(17). Indeed, a correlation has been established
between elevated RER and lower energy de-
mand (18). Combined, these data indicate that
the uridine-induced drop in body temperature
is caused by metabolic rate suppression due to
lowered energetic demand.
One of the major sites of leptin action is the
hypothalamus (19), which is also the master reg-
ulator of core body temperature (20). To examine
whether the uridine-mediated drop in body tem-
perature involves leptin, we injected uridine
intraperitoneally into ob/ob and into HFD-fed
wild-type mice. In both cases, uridine caused a
rapid drop in body temperature (2.9° ± 0.3°C
and 4.2° ± 0.9°C, n = 3, P < 0.01, respectively,
30 min after uridine injection). However, ob/ob
mice manifested a significant delay in the recov-
ery of normal body temperature (Fig. 3E). These
results suggest that the uridine-induced drop
in body temperature is leptin-independent, but
that leptin is required to recover body temper-
ature after hypothermia. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we observed a robust increase by
nearly a factor of 2 in plasma leptin levels within
30 min after uridine injection (Fig. 3F).
To determine whether the change in circu-
lating leptin derives from increased secretion
or reduced clearance, we studied heterozygous
ob/+ mice, which are known to harbor reduced
plasma levels of leptin (21). If uridine-stimulated
leptin elevation is due to impaired clearance, the
response in ob/+ mice would be expected to be
similar to that occurring in wild-type mice. How-
ever, we found that increases in plasma leptin
were diminished in the ob/+ mice after uridine
injection (Fig. 3G), which suggests that the effect
of uridine on circulating leptin is likely due to
increased secretion.
Plasma uridine is cleared by bile
The accumulation of plasma uridine upon fasting,
coupled with its rapid postprandial drop, led us
to examine whether bile might be involved in
plasma uridine clearance, because bile excretion
is increased by food intake. Indeed, we found
that bile extracted from the gallbladder of wild-
type mice contained uridine levels that were
higher than levels present in plasma under fasting
conditions by a factor of ≤8 (Fig. 4A). Moreover,
bile uridine levels trended toward a decrease
in fasted mice, but within 4 hours of refeeding,
bile uridine concentrations increased 27% (n =
6, P < 0.05) and 100% (n = 10, P < 0.01) in male
and female wild-type mice, respectively (Fig. 4B);
these findings suggest that mice under refed
conditions have a much higher rate of uridine
flux from blood to the gallbladder than fasted
mice. And consistent with changes in plasma
uridine observed in HFD and ob/ob mice (Fig. 2C),
bile from HFD mice harbored lower uridine
content under fasted conditions (Fig. 4C). Con-
versely, bile isolated from ob/ob mice had higher
uridine levels that declined when they were ex-
posed to a HFD (Fig. 4D).
To study the dynamics of plasma uridine un-
der fed conditions, we injected wild-type mice
with a trace amount of [3H]uridine (25 mCi) via
the tail vein. Rapid turnover (half-life ~3 min)
of plasma uridine has been reported in rats and
dogs (22, 23), and we observed similar values
in mice. Notably, we found a concomitant accu-
mulation of [3H]uridine in bile (Fig. 4E), with
levels in bile as high as those in plasma within
15 min of tail vein injection (Fig. 4E). In con-
trast, when [3H]uridine was gavaged orally, no
significant radioactivity was detected in plasma,
whereas rapid accumulation of [3H]uridine was
detected within 2 min in bile (Fig. 4E).
Together, these data suggest that orally supplied
uridine is efficiently channeled through the liver
to the gallbladder with a negligible amount of
transit through the peripheral circulation. To test
this further, we collected blood from the portal
vein 2 min after [3H]uridine gavage. Here, we ob-
served a significant burst of radioactivity within
the portal vein, comparable to levels detected in
the gallbladder, within 2 min (Fig. 4F). In con-
trast, radioactivity detected in plasma was less
than 50% of that in bile, confirming that orally

liver through the portal vein.
Biliary uridine clearance improves
glucose tolerance
To begin to explore whether uridine plays a role
in metabolism beyond thermoregulation, we ex-
amined its effect on glucose homeostasis. First,
we found that oral co-administration of uridine
and glucose to wild-type mice on a HFD led to
significant improvements in glucose tolerance
(Fig. 5A); this improvement, however, was not ob-
served in ob/ob mice (Fig. 5B). We next tested
whether parenteral administration of uridine
mimics the effects of oral uridine. We injected
uridine i.p. (at the same dose that induced a tem-
perature drop) into HFD-fed wild-type mice and
into ob/ob mice 15 min prior to an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT). The HFD-fed wild-type
mice also manifested a significant improvement in
glucose tolerance after uridine injection (Fig. 5C).
In contrast, and consistent with an active role of
leptin in this process, ob/ob mice manifested de-
terioration in their glucose tolerance after uri-
dine injection (Fig. 5D). Together, these results
suggest that leptin is a key mediator of uridine’s
effect on glucose metabolism.
Aging is often associated with development of
insulin resistance and obesity. In a study of older
wild-type mice (18 months of age), we found that
uridine administration markedly improved glu-
cose tolerance (Fig. 5, E and F), which suggests
that both aging-associated and HFD-associated
insulin resistance can be attenuated by uridine
supplementation. To explore this further, we used
PALA to inhibit uridine biosynthesis (14). Prior
toxicological evaluation of this compound in
C57BL/6 mice revealed that a 50% lethal dose
corresponds to 1587 mg/kg (24). Given this re-
port, we studied the effect of a much lower sin-
gle dose of 62.5 mg/kg. No gross abnormalities
were observed after drug administration in chow-
fed mice. However, PALA led to an acute eleva-
tion of plasma glucose in HFD-fed mice (Fig.
5G). Upon more prolonged monitoring of these
mice, after receiving just this single dose of PALA,
the mice displayed a significant loss of body
weight and died within 2 weeks of treatment
(Fig. 5H)—an observation not seen in the chow-
fed animals. We interpret these observations
with a uridine biosynthesis inhibitor to suggest
that endogenous uridine synthesis is critical for
both blood glucose control and survival of mice
when exposed to HFD.
Enteral uridine delivery does not reduce
body temperature
Our results indicate that enteral provision of
uridine does not culminate in plasma increases
in uridine (Fig. 4E) but improves glucose toler-
ance similar to that elicited by i.p. administration
(Fig. 5C). To explore the underlying mechanisms,
we first evaluated core body temperature. Here,
we observed that uridine gavaged orally in HFD-
fed mice elicited marginal changes in body tem-
perature and led to temporary elevation of body
temperature in ob/ob mice (Fig. 6A). This is in
sharp contrast to the effects of i.p. administra-
tion of the same dose of uridine (Fig. 3E). Thus,
uridine administration through an oral route did
not provoke hypothermia. Further, we noted that
glucose gavage did not lead to a decrease in body
temperature in either HFD-fed wild-type or ob/ob
mice, irrespective of co-administration of uri-
dine (Fig. 6, B and C). This suggests that uridine-
induced improvements in glucose tolerance are
not mediated by thermoregulation.
Adipocytes are a key regulator for
plasma uridine
Our findings indicate that biliary clearance is
critical for the declines in plasma uridine elicited
by refeeding. We proposed that fasting-induced
elevations in plasma uridine could derive from
reduced biliary clearance during the fasting state.
Further, the abnormal dynamics of plasma uri-
dine observed in ob/ob and HFD-fed mice sug-
gested that adipose tissue might participate in
the elevations of plasma uridine triggered by
fasting. To test this, we evaluated the impact of
acute loss of adipocytes on plasma uridine levels.
First, we used our previously characterized FAT-
ATTAC mice, a model in which adipocytes in
adult animals can be selectively eliminated by
induced apoptosis (25). Three days after loss of
viable adipocytes, FAT-ATTAC mice under fed
conditions displayed a modest but statistically
significant drop in plasma uridine levels relative
to wild-type mice (8.16 ± 1.07 mM in wild type,
n = 6 versus 6.34 ± 1.11 mM in FAT-ATTAC; n =
6, P = 0.016) (Fig. 7A). Upon fasting, the FAT-
ATTAC mice manifested no increase in uridine
levels relative to control mice (Fig. 7A). In con-
trast, refeeding led to similar reductions in plasma
uridine concentrations in both groups. Beyond a
small reduction in fat mass (0.15 ± 0.05 g in wild
type, –0.39 ± 0.13 g in FAT-ATTAC), no significant
changes in body weight were detected between
the two groups either before or 3 days after in-
duction of adipocyte apoptosis (fig. S1).
To test this further, we studied mice selectively
silenced for Agpat2 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-
acyltransferase 2), a mutant line that lacks func-
tional adipose tissue and serves as a model of
congenital lipodystrophy (26). In these animals,
fasting did not elicit an increase in plasma uri-
dine levels (Fig. 7B). These data lend additional

 credence to a model in which adipose tissue is
required for fasting-induced increases in plasma
uridine.
The liver is widely held to be the major organ
maintaining plasma uridine supply (4). However,
even though fasting triggered increases in plas-
ma uridine, we found that the genes responsible
for de novo uridine synthesis were all down-
regulated by fasting in the liver (Fig. 7C). In con-
trast, Cad, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme
for uridine biosynthesis, was highly expressed
in three different adipose tissue depots when ex-
amined under both fed and fasted conditions
(Fig. 7D). Furthermore, the genes encoding the
other two enzymes in the uridine biosynthetic
pathway, Dhodh and Umps, manifested expres-
sion patterns similar to Cad (fig. S2). This suggests
that adipose tissue is indeed an important site of
uridine synthesis contributing to fasting-induced
rises in plasma uridine. Consistent with this, biopsy
specimens of subcutaneous fat from subjects de-
picted in Fig. 1C uniformly harbored reduced uri-
dine content in the postprandial state (Fig. 7E).
To explore further the role of adipose tissue
in plasma uridine homeostasis, we studied a
streptozotocin (STZ)–induced model of type 1 dia-
betes. As expected, STZ administration caused
hyperglycemia (Fig. 7F) and a rapid loss of fat
mass (fig. S3). After the initial loss of body mass,
mice subsequently reached a plateau of body
weight that was maintained for the subsequent
7 weeks (Fig. 7G). Under these conditions, both
plasma and bile uridine levels were reduced to
half the levels observed in the control vehicle-
treated group (Fig. 7H). Similarly, uridine con-
centrations in both brown adipose tissue (BAT)
and the heart were reduced (Fig. 7I). In contrast,
uridine levels in livers isolated from STZ-treated
mice were comparable to those in the control
group (Fig. 7I), which suggests that uridine bio-
synthesis in the liver remains functional even in
the absence of circulating insulin. However, the
seemingly unaltered production of uridine in
the liver is insufficient to maintain normal levels
of plasma uridine under fasting conditions.
Although our observations support the idea
that adipose tissue plays a critical role in plasma
uridine homeostasis, the inducible and constitu-
tive loss of adipose tissue as well as lowering of
systemic insulin production through the loss of

 b cells are associated with a multitude of meta-
bolic changes, so the effects on uridine could be
indirect. To test more specifically whether adi-
pose tissue supplies uridine through pyrimi-
dine biosynthesis, we generated mice selectively
silenced for Cad in adipocytes. Upon 24 hours
of fasting, the Cad knockout mice manifested
no increase in uridine levels relative to the con-
trol group (fig. S4), which suggests that uridine
biosynthesis in adipocytes is necessary for a
fasting-induced increase in plasma uridine. How-
ever, more experiments are warranted to examine
confounding effects from compensatory alteration
in liver uridine biosynthesis and/or degradation
in response to reduced adipocyte Cad expression.
Discussion
Uridine and thermoregulation
Temperature homeostasis is a tightly regulated
process in mammals. The human body retains
a set temperature of ~37°C, with complications
arising when the temperature increases by little
more than 3°C (27). During fasting, both rodents
and humans manifest a reduction in body tem-
perature, a process regulated by the sympathetic
nervous system (20, 28). Our findings indicate
that plasma uridine is a metabolite critically in-
volved in this process.
The dynamic regulation of plasma uridine is
unusual for a metabolite, particularly one with
the range of vital biological functions associated
with uridine. Characterizing the dynamics of
plasma uridine as part of the systemic response
to fasting and refeeding has led us to propose a
model that integrates feeding, carbohydrate me-
tabolism, and thermoregulation through a novel
adipo-biliary-uridine axis. In studies with leptin-
deficient ob/ob mice, coupled with measurements
of circulating leptin in response to uridine admin-
istration, we also uncovered a role for leptin signal-
ing in the governance of uridine homeostasis and
fasting-induced declines in body temperature.
Plasma-bile-gut uridine homeostasis
Our results unveil pivotal roles for uridine bio-
synthesis and transport to and from bile in the
metabolic control of body temperature. Bile is
produced by the liver and released into the small
intestine to enhance the digestion and absorp-
tion of fat (29). Recently, components of bile
have been shown to mediate effects on energy
metabolism and blood glucose regulation, and
even to shape the composition of the gut flora
(30). Our findings indicate that uridine released
from bile can increase glucose assimilation. Al-
though the detailed mechanism is unclear, intes-
tinal nutrient absorption is a process tightly linked
to the function of biliary uridine. Because of the
limited capacity for de novo synthesis of nucle-
otides (31, 32), the salvage pathway for utilization
of exogenous nucleosides is of particular impor-
tance in epithelial cells in the small intestine.
How, then, is uridine transported across these
systems? Nucleosides are transported into cells
by plasma membrane carriers that belong to two
gene families, CNT and ENT (33–36). Whereas
CNT1- and CNT2-related proteins are responsible
for the concentrative Na-dependent high-affinity
transport of pyrimidine (33–36), less is known
about the transport of uridine. Our findings point
to excretion of uridine into bile canaliculi by hep-
atocytes, as well as transport of plasma uridine
into the gallbladder, suggesting the presence of
nucleoside carriers on both canalicular and sinus-
oidal membranes of hepatocytes. Interestingly,
bile acids can increase CNT2-related activity in
the liver through the recruitment of CNT2 from
intracellular stores to the plasma membrane (37);
this implies that uridine may be taken up by hep-
atocytes during the fed state and subsequently
shunted to the gallbladder.
Adipocyte-dependent
uridine biosynthesis
A role for adipocytes in plasma uridine homeosta-
sis has not been appreciated to date. Our ob-
servations reveal that fasting-induced elevation
and maintenance of elevated plasma uridine levels
rely critically on adipocytes. The uridine levels
in fat biopsies from HIV-infected patients that
suffer from HIV-associated partial lipodystrophy
are significantly elevated (38), indicating that
excessive uridine production might lead to the

 loss of adipose tissue. Our studies have drawn a
consistent correlation between increased plasma
uridine and increased biosynthesis in adipo-
cytes; however, regardless of the consistency and
strength of the correlation, this does not estab-
lish causality.
Detailed mechanisms underlying the leptin-
mediated plasma uridine clearance also remain
unclear. However, a connection between leptin
transcription and the hexosamine biosynthetic
pathway end product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
(UDP-GlcNAc) has been reported (39), suggest-
ing the involvement of a signaling pathway from
uridine to UDP-GlcNAc. Given the complexity of
plasma uridine homeostasis and the pivotal role
of uridine in systemic metabolism reported here,
inhibition of uridine supplied from one tissue is
expected to alter the supply, salvage, and clearance
of uridine in other tissues. Indeed, our findings
point to a critical role of adipocytes in plasma
uridine homeostasis. Additional studies com-
bining tissue-specific loss and gain of function
of enzymes responsible for pyrimidine de novo
synthesis are warranted to characterize the con-
tribution of adipocytes to the plasma uridine
supply.
Future directions
Our description of an adipo-biliary-uridine axis
raises interesting questions for future investi-
gation. What are the effects of feeding-induced
reductions in uridine levels in organs that rely
heavily on uridine uptake from plasma, such as
the heart? Given the established links among
feeding, metabolism, and circadian rhythmic-
ity (40, 41), does uridine play a central role in
these processes? Whether bariatric surgery, the
only obesity treatment that achieves substantial
and permanent weight loss (42), is associated
with alterations in plasma uridine homeostasis
due to altered recycling of uridine from gut to
blood also merits investigation.
Recently, diabetes has been linked to impair-
ments in temperature control during exposure
to thermal stress (43). Our studies reveal a di-
rect link between temperature regulation and
metabolism, indicating that a uridine-centered
model of energy homeostasis may pave the way
for future studies on uridine homeostasis and
diabetes as well as other metabolic diseases.
Materials and methods
Animals and experimental protocol
Adult C57BL/6 inbred mice (WT) and leptin de-
ficient mice (ob/ob) were housed in individually
ventilated cages with constant temperature on a
standard 12:12 light cycle, and were fed stand-
ard rodent chow diet (2916, Teklad) with free
access to water. Male C57BL/6 mice that were
used for high fat diet study were switched to
high fat diet (D12492, Research Diet) after their
body weight reached 20 g (8 to 10 weeks old).
Age-matched ob/ob mice were used, with both
male and female data pooled in the analysis.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from
the Charles River Laboratory and fed with rat
diet (Teklad). All procedures were approved by
The Institutional Animal Care and the Use Com-
mittee of UT Southwestern Medical Center.
Study subjects and human samples
This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and written in-
formed consent was obtained from all subjects
before their participation. Subjects were admit-
ted to the Clinical Research Unit in the evening
before the study, and consumed a standard din-
ner (12 kcal per kg fat-free mass) at 1800 hours.
At 0700 hours the next morning, after subjects
fasted for 12 hours overnight, they consumed a
liquid mixed meal, provided in 5 equal aliquots
every 5 min for 20 min. The meal contained
one-third of each subject’s estimated total daily
energy requirement and was comprised of 55%
of total energy as carbohydrates, 15% as protein,
and 30% as fat. Arterial blood samples were ob-
tained 10 min before and immediately before,
and at 20, 40, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min
after initiating meal consumption. Human sub-
ject information is shown in table S1.
Fasting/refeeding studies in rodents
Male WT mice (10 to 35 weeks old) and male rats
(10 weeks old) were used for fasting/refeeding
studies at ambient temperature (22° to 25°C).
Age-matched ob/ob mice were used which in-
clude both males and females. Male Agpat KO
(8 to 10 weeks old) and male FAT-ATTAC mice
(10 to 12 weeks old) were used for fasting/
refeeding studies with their age-matched WT
controls, respectively. For FAT-ATTAC mice, the
study was performed 3 days post dimerizer com-
pound AP20187 (Ariad) administration as de-
scribed (25). Blood samples (30 ml) were collected
in heparinized capillaries from tail tip at spec-
ified time points. Samples were centrifuged and
aliquots of plasma were frozen at –20°C.
Plasma and bile measurements
Blood samples (30 ml) from tail tip were col-
lected in heparinized capillaries from male WT
and age-matched ob/ob mice (12 to 30 weeks
old) and male rats (10 weeks old). Samples were
centrifuged and aliquots of plasma were frozen
at –20°C. Bile samples were collected from gall-
bladders from male WT, female WT and age-
matched ob/ob mice (28 to 32 weeks old). Plasma
uridine and uric acid, and bile uridine levels
were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS at UT South-
western Medical Center Mouse Metabolic Pheno-
typing Core. Plasma glucose was measured by an
oxidase-peroxidase assay (Sigma) as described
(44). Plasma leptin levels were measured using
an ELISA kit (Millipore).
Effect of uridine and glucose on
body temperature
Male WT (15 to 35 weeks old) and age-matched
ob/ob mice were used for body temperature mea-
surements through an IPTT-300 transponder
implanted longitudinally above the shoulder of
mouse (Bio Medic Data Systems). To study the
thermal effect of uridine, 0.1 g/ml uridine (Sigma)
in PBS was administrated to mice (1 g/kg body
weight) via intraperitoneal injection or oral
gavage. To study the thermal effect of glucose,
0.25 g/ml glucose (Sigma) in H2O was admin-
istrated orally to mice (2.5 g/kg body weight). To
study the combined effect of glucose and uridine,
glucose-uridine solution (0.25 g/ml glucose and
0.1 g/ml uridine in H2O) was administrated orally
at the same dose as the study for glucose alone.
All the treatment and temperature measurements
were performed at ambient room temperature
(23° to 25°C), if not specified. A refrigerated in-
cubator at 29°C (Powers Scientific) was used to
achieve a near-thermoneutral environment.
[3H]Uridine clearance study
[5-3H]Uridine (25 mCi, PerkinElmer) in 250 ml
PBS was administrated to male C57BL/6 mice
(15 to 35 weeks old) via tail vein injection or oral
gavage. This dose (0.274 mg uridine per mouse)
was lower than that for thermal effects of uridine
(1 g/kg body weight), such that no drop in body
temperature was triggered in the clearance study.
Plasma from tail tip was sampled from intact
mouse before its bile was harvested from gall-
bladder. Plasma (5 ml) and bile (2 ml) were used
for radioactivity measurements. To collect blood
from portal vein, mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane after plasma had been first sampled
from its tail tip.
Indirect calorimetry and NMR
VO2 (ml/hr/kg), VCO2 (ml/hr/kg), and RER (VCO2/
VO2, dimensionless) were calculated using an
open-flow, indirect calorimeter in the UTSW Me-
tabolic Phenotyping Core. Two male C57BL/6
mice (10 to 13 weeks old, chow fed) were studied
at a time such that the variables were recorded
every 6 min for 2 hours. After 15 min acclimation
in the test chambers, three recordings were per-
formed before injection (–13 min, –7 min, and
–1 min) from which the base line of VO2 and
VCO2 were calculated for each mouse. One min-
ute after the third recording, the mouse was
taken out of the test chamber to receive an in-
traperitoneal injection of uridine (1 g/kg body-
weight) or PBS, such that the time 0 indicated
when the injection was performed. This paired
study was repeated for five times, and the results
were expressed as mean ± SEM. The adminis-
tration of uridine or PBS required opening the
test chamber, which caused a sudden drop in
the calculated rates of O2 consumption and CO2
production in the first recording, 5 min post
injection for each mouse. Accurate determination
of body composition in intact mouse was con-
ducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (Bruck-
ner Minispec mq10).
Tolerance tests
For glucose tolerance tests, glucose (0.25 g/ml in
H2O) was gavaged (2.5 g/kg body weight) orally
to male WT mice and age-matched ob/ob mice
(15 to 35 weeks old) after fasted for 4 hours. To
test parenteral effect of uridine, uridine (0.1 g/ml
in PBS) was administrated via intraperitoneal
injection(1g/kgbodyweight)15minbeforeglucose

 tolerance tests. To test enteral effect of uridine,
uridine was dissolved together with glucose in
H2O and the glucose-uridine solution (0.25 g/ml
glucose and 0.1 g/ml uridine in H2O) was used
for oral gavage at the same dose as glucose tol-
erance test.
N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA)
and streptozotocin (STZ) treatments
PALA (100 mg/ml in 0.9% saline) was adminis-
trated via intraperitoneal injection at 62.5 mg/kg
body weight to ob/ob (10 to 35 weeks old) or
male WT mice (16 to 20 weeks old on HFD for
30 days). Food was removed after PALA injec-
tion up to 24 hours to monitor response in body
temperature and plasma glucose. PALA was syn-
thesized at UT Southwestern Medical Center as
described (45) with purity greater than 95% as
assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance. STZ
(Sigma) was dissolved freshly in ice-cold sodium
citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5) and administrated
via intraperitoneal injection to male C57BL/6
mice (10 to 15 weeks old) at 120 mg/g body weight
as described previously (46). Body weight and
plasma glucose levels were monitored up to
7 weeks post STZ treatment, and the mice were
euthanized for plasma, bile, and tissue collection
after 24 hours of fasting.
RNA isolation and qPCR
Male C57BL/6 mice (15 to 25 weeks old) fed or
fasted of 24 hours were euthanized and tissues
were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin
RNA II mini columns (Macherey-Nagel) from 50
to 100 mg tissue and total RNA (100 ng to 1 mg)
was used for reverse transcription with iScript
kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were then diluted
tenfold with ddH2O and stored at –20°C for qPCR
(Roche). Primers are shown in table S2. 18S RNA
served as an internal control.
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as mean ± SEM. Statis-
tical analysis of the data was performed with
two-tailed Student t test or two-way ANOVA,
as specified. Paired t test was performed for
samples collected from the same mouse during
a time course study. A P value < 0.05 was consid-
ered as significant. Statistical software consisted
of Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 6.04.
