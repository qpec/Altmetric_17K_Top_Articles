In Brief
An emerging strategy for precision
cancer therapy is to induce synthetic
lethality in a tumor based on its pattern of
genetic mutations. Here we map a large
network of conserved synthetic lethal
interactions between selective drugs and
tumor suppressor genes somatically
mutated in human cancer. All of these
interactions are mirrored in budding
yeast, an accessible model for
researching drug mode of action.

SUMMARY
An emerging therapeutic strategy for cancer is to
induce selective lethality in a tumor by exploiting in-
teractions between its driving mutations and specific
drug targets. Here we use a multi-species approach
to develop a resource of synthetic lethal interactions
relevant to cancer therapy. First, we screen in yeast
�169,000 potential interactions among orthologs of
human tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and genes
encoding drug targets across multiple genotoxic en-
vironments. Guided by the strongest signal, we eval-
uate thousands of TSG-drug combinations in HeLa
cells, resulting in networks of conserved synthetic
lethal interactions. Analysis of these networks re-
veals that interaction stability across environments
and shared gene function increase the likelihood of
observing an interaction in human cancer cells.
Using these rules, we prioritize �105 human TSG-
drug combinations for future follow-up. We validate
interactions based on cell and/or patient survival,
including topoisomerases with RAD17 and check-
point kinases with BLM.
INTRODUCTION
Alterations to the tumor genome fall broadly into two classes:
gain-of-function mutations in growth-enhancing genes (onco-
genes) and loss-of-function mutations in growth-inhibitory genes
(tumor suppressor genes or TSGs). Although targeting onco-
genes with chemical inhibitors or therapeutic antibodies has
proven to be effective for cancer therapy (Sawyers, 2004), it is
not currently feasible to restore the function of mutated or
deleted TSGs in the clinical setting (Morris and Chan, 2015).
Rather than targeting a TSG directly, an emerging strategy is
to identify ‘‘synthetic lethal’’ genetic interactions between the
TSG and other genes so that simultaneous disruption of both
gene functions causes rapid and selective cell death (Brody,
2005). For example, cells deficient for BRCA1 have a reduced
capacity for repairing double-stranded DNA breaks and are
especially vulnerable to further perturbations in DNA repair path-
ways (Fong et al., 2009). Olaparib, a Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA)-approved drug, exploits this principle by targeting
a component of single-stranded DNA break repair, PARP1,
thus causing selective cell death in BRCA1�/� or BRCA2�/� cells
(Lord et al., 2015).
Recent efforts to map synthetic lethal interactions in cancer
typically fall into one of several categories. First, populations of
tumor genomes may be analyzed statistically to detect pairs of
genes that are seldom co-mutated or co-altered in the same tu-
mor (Jerby-Arnon et al., 2014), with one interpretation being that
loss of function of both genes is synthetically lethal (Ciriello et al.,
2012). This approach has the advantage of directly examining
patient populations, although it is much better powered to test
interactions between alterations that are very common than in-
teractions in which one or both alterations is rare (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures; Figure S1A).
Second, synthetic lethal interactions may be mapped by
directed combinatorial disruptions in human cell lines. Such dis-
ruptions use pairwise small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdowns
(Roguev et al., 2013), combinations of siRNA and drug treat-
ments (Chan and Giaccia, 2011), or the CRISPR (clustered regu-
larly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 system to
systematically test relevant interactions in an unbiased manner
(Wong et al., 2016). However, the three largest screens in human
514

 cells performed to date (Bassik et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2015;
Wong et al., 2016), which screened approximately 4,500, 3,600,
and 2,500 interactions, respectively, fall short of the required
throughput to interrogate the potential interaction space of all
gene pairs involving a TSG; they also have uncharacterized off-
target effects (Jackson and Linsley, 2010; Tsai et al., 2015). A
hybrid of the above approaches is to screen a population of can-
cer cell lines against directed gene knockdowns or drugs, with
the aim of identifying cell line mutations that interact with partic-
ular targets (Basu et al., 2013; Cowley et al., 2014). Such hybrid
methods face the challenges already mentioned, including bias
toward the most commonly mutated genes.
A complementary strategy for mapping synthetic lethal inter-
actions in cancer is to leverage conservation with genetic inter-
actions identified more tractably in model species (Hartwell
et al., 1997). In the yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, tech-
niques such as synthetic genetic arrays (SGAs) and Pombe Epis-
tasis Mapper (PEM) enable genetic interactions to be measured
in an unbiased manner and at a very large scale, with minimal
off-target effects, because the genes are disrupted by complete
and specific knockout of the open reading frame (Roguev et al.,
2007; Tong and Boone, 2006). Although the model organism
approach is inherently limited to testing interactions of genes
that are evolutionarily conserved, numerous such interactions
have been observed, especially in the core conserved pathways
in which TSGs are known to operate, such as cell cycle, genome
maintenance, and metabolic growth (Roguev et al., 2008; Ryan
et al., 2012). A number of TSGs important for human cancer
were first identified and studied in yeast (Deshpande et al.,
2013; Huang et al., 2003), which also provides an accessible
model system in which to study mechanism of action (Simon
et al., 2000). Nonetheless, it remains unclear to what extent syn-
thetic lethal interactions observed in a model species can be
ultimately translated for clinical application. Multiple factors
have been postulated to influence whether an interaction will
be translatable, including the genetic, epigenetic, and environ-
mental context (Nijman and Friend, 2013). A proper study of
such factors would require a large cross-species dataset of ge-
netic interactions relevant to cancer genes and functions.
Here we generate
such a comprehensive resource
of
conserved synthetic lethal interactions for the study of cancer
cell biology and the design of targeted therapy. This network in-
cludes quantitative tests for interaction among many TSGs in
yeast and genes that are currently targetable by selective inhib-
itors (‘‘druggable’’ targets or DTs). Strong interactions in this da-
taset are used to design a matched screen for lethal TSG-DT
combinations in human cancer cells. This process results in a
cross-species network of conserved interactions between hu-
man and yeast, allowing us to study features that best predict
conservation and to extrapolate this knowledge to evaluate
many potential tumor suppressor-drug interactions.
RESULTS
Selection of Conserved Tumor Suppressor and
Druggable Genes
Our overall aim was to generate a broad network of synthetic
lethal interactions connecting TSGs to DTs using the high-
throughput capacity of yeast as a springboard into human
screens. To define a set of TSGs, we compiled a list of 129 genes
known or suspected to harbor loss-of-function cancer driver mu-
tations for which there were also orthologs in yeast (Figure 1A;
Tables S1 and S2; Experimental Procedures). We examined
evidence that these 129 genes were clinically relevant. On
average, 73% and 36% of >6,000 tumors analyzed in the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) were found to contain either a somatic
mutation or homozygous copy number loss, respectively, in at
least one of these TSGs (Figure 1B; Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). This incidence was significantly higher than that
observed for the average human gene (p < 0.001 based on
1,000 random samples; Figure 1B, inset). As expected based
on sequence similarity, we found that the 111 yeast orthologs
of these human TSGs were enriched for functional roles similar
to their human counterparts, such as maintenance of genome
integrity or coordination of cell cycle arrest (Figure 1C), indicating
the relevance of these genes for studying conserved oncogenic
processes.
To define a set of DTs, we began with an inclusive list of human
genes either known or predicted to be druggable based on fea-
tures including the presence/absence of certain protein domains
and the presence/absence of binding pockets in the three-
dimensional structure (Russ and Lampel, 2005). Of these, we
prioritized 956 genes, mapping to 433 yeast orthologs, chosen
to provide broad functional representation (Figure 1A; Tables
S1 and S2; Experimental Procedures). Approximately one-third
of these genes were known targets of small-molecule com-
pounds (Wishart et al., 2008), including 189 genes that were tar-
gets of a compound currently approved for use in humans by the
FDA (Figure 1A).
A TSG-DT Genetic Interaction Map in Yeast
Next we used SGA technology in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Tong
and Boone, 2006) to systematically test for genetic interactions
among all possible TSG and DT orthologs. SGA uses high-
throughput robotic colony pinning on agar to create and score
growth of large numbers of double gene deletion strains in par-
allel, here yielding tests for interaction among 43,505 gene-
gene pairs. Despite the numerous previous genetic interaction
studies in yeast, the majority of this space had not yet been
tested (Figure 1D; Ryan et al., 2012). In addition to untreated con-
ditions, interactions were assayed in three environmental con-
texts: bleomycin, which causes single- and double-stranded
DNA breaks; hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor
that interferes with DNA synthesis; and hydrogen peroxide,
which causes cellular oxidation damage. Across all four environ-
ments, this dataset represented �169,000 distinct tests of gene-
gene interaction.
The resulting growth measurements were analyzed using an
established computational workflow (Collins et al., 2006) to
assign quantitative S scores to all interaction measurements.
Positive S scores indicate an epistatic or suppressive interac-
tion, whereas negative S scores indicate a synthetic sick or
lethal relationship (Table S2). For interaction measurements
that had also been made in previous studies (untreated condi-
tions), consistency between the new and previous scores was
high (r = 0.50 ± 0.1) and on par with the consistency of these

 studies in comparison with one another (r = 0.58 ± 0.2) (Bandyo-

Fiedler et al., 2009; Gue

´ et al., 2013; Srivas et al., 2013;
Wilmes et al., 2008). In total 1,420 synthetic sick/lethal interac-
tions (S % �2.5) and 996 epistatic interactions (S R 2.0) were
identified under untreated conditions, with an average of 14
and 11 synthetic lethal/sick interactions per TSG and DT,
respectively (Figure 1E). In addition, a pan-cancer analysis of
The Cancer Genome Atlas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network et al., 2013) identified 16 TSGs that, when mutated in tu-
mors, are associated with coordinate upregulation in genes
(false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1) for which a negative TSG-
gene interaction is found in yeast (Figures S1B and S1C;Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures).

Chemo-genetic Interaction
Mapping in Human Cancer Cells
Guided by the yeast network, we next
performed
a
tumor
suppressor-drug
interaction screen in human cancer cells.
Recognizing that no single cancer cell
line can represent all of human cancer,
the HeLa cervical cancer cell line was
selected given its favorable cell culture
characteristics and extensive molecular
characterization (Adey et al., 2013). We
prioritized 21 drugs for which the yeast
DTs
were
involved
in
the
greatest
numbers of synthetic lethal interactions (interaction ‘‘hubs’’) (Fig-
ure 2A; Experimental Procedures). Dose-response curves of
each drug were established so that the proper inhibitory concen-
trations could be determined (inhibitory concentration [IC]20 and
IC40; Figure 2B; Table S3A). Yeast synthetic sick/lethal interac-
tions with these DTs had implicated a total of 82 TSGs. To this
number we added another 30 human TSGs commonly mutated
in human cancers but without orthologous yeast genes.
Within this 21 drug 3 112 TSG matrix (Table S3B), each drug
was screened at both IC20 and IC40 doses in combination with
each TSG knockdown. We observed minimal batch effects and
high reproducibility with an average coefficient of variance (CV)
of 3.8% per plate and 92% of plates having CV < 5.0% (Fig-
ure S2A). Average replicate correlation across the entire screen
516
Molecular Cell 63, 514–525, August 4, 2016
 was 0.95, which we found meets or exceeds the quality of previ-
ous genetic interaction screens in human cell lines (Figure S2B).
IC20 and IC40 measurements were also significantly correlated
(Figure S2C). To score chemical-gene interactions, the viability
of each gene knockdown in the presence of drug was compared
to the viability of non-targeting siRNA also in the presence of
drug (Figure 2C; Experimental Procedures).
Applying a standard threshold of 3 SDs below the mean
(z < �3) (Birmingham et al., 2009), a total of 127 synthetic sick/
lethal genetic interactions were identified (Figure 2D; Table S4).
This threshold identified the well characterized interactions of
the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib with
both BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Lord et al., 2015; Figure S2D). In
contrast, 10-fold fewer epistatic/positive interactions were found
(12 at z > 3), consistent with the design of the human test space
based on yeast synthetic lethal interactions. Examining the entire
interaction score profile of each drug, we found that drugs
targeting similar proteins had similar profiles (e.g., the histone
deacetylase
[HDAC]
inhibitors
vorinostat
and
rocilinostat;
Figure S2E).
A Conserved Synthetic Lethal Interaction Network
Having generated network resources in both yeast and human
cancer cells, we were immediately interested in evidence of con-
servation between the two species. First, we found that gene
pairs determined to interact negatively in humans had corre-
sponding scores in yeast that were significantly more negative
than the yeast scores for all remaining gene pairs. This result
held true across a range of stringent cutoffs used to call human
interactions but not more lenient ones (all p values are shown in
Table S5A and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We
also computed a likelihood score (LS) of human synthetic sick-
ness/lethality provided the interaction had been first observed
in yeast (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Prior obser-
vation in yeast (i.e., gene pairs among the top 10% ranked by
S score) increased the likelihood of human genetic interaction
by approximately 3-fold (p < 0.031; Figure 3A; Table S5A). We
note that this is less conservation than observed previously in
a smaller-scale synthetic lethal screen centered around the
gene FEN1 (van Pel et al., 2013).
Based on this general conservation, we next sought to identify
the specific interactions with evidence of synthetic lethality in
both species. To this end, we defined two conserved cancer net-
works (CoCaNets) of synthetic sick/lethal interactions at both
lenient (10%) and stringent (2%) cutoffs: CoCaNet10 (172 inter-
actions, top 10% based on the rank product of human and yeast
scores; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and the more
stringent CoCaNet2 (36 interactions, top 2%; Figure 3B; Table

 S5B). CoCaNet10 included conserved interactions among
59 TSGs and 23 drug targets (Figure 3C). The more stringent
CoCaNet2 captured the strongest conserved interactions,
including those among DNA damage checkpoint, cell cycle
checkpoint, topoisomerase, and chromatin remodeling genes
(Figure 3D). Inspection of these networks revealed 13 inter-
actions that had been characterized previously in humans
and one in yeast, including synthetic sick relationships between
CHEK1 or CHEK2 and WEE1 (Carrassa et al., 2012; Chila
` et al.,
2015), which we recovered in both orientations (CHEK1/2 inhib-
itor with WEE1 knockdown and WEE1 inhibitor with CHEK1/2
knockdown). All remaining conserved interactions, representing
the vast majority, were observed for the first time in either spe-
cies (Figures 3C and 3D). The conserved networks, along with
the complete human and yeast interaction data, are available
in Tables S2, S4, and S5B and have also been made available
on the Network Data Exchange (NDEx, http://www.ndexbio.
org; Supplemental Experimental Procedures), a database and
online community for sharing and collaborative development of
network models we recently launched as part of the Cytoscape
Cyberinfrastructure (Pratt et al., 2015).
Incidence of Human Interaction Is Informed by Context
Stability and Co-function
We next investigated whether certain network features, or
rules of thumb, could increase the likelihood of observing an

 interaction in HeLa cells. To this end, we annotated human gene
pairs with a variety of data, including not only whether we had
observed the interaction in yeast but the number of experimental
contexts in which the interaction was observed (interaction sta-
bility Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and whether the
genes are known to co-function in the same gene ontology
(GO) biological process in either species.
Knowledge that the interaction not only occurs in yeast but is
stable across environmental contexts led to an increase in the
likelihood of human interaction up to 9-fold from baseline (Fig-
ure 3A). On top of this information, knowledge that a gene pair
functions in the same biological process (yeast and human GO
terms) increased the likelihood of human interaction to 19-fold
(Figure 3E). As a negative control, we found that random permu-
tation of features led to significantly decreased predictive capa-
bility (Table S5A; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Using the integrated LS score from all informative features
(yeast interaction, context stability, yeast co-function, and hu-
man co-function), we then extrapolated the likelihoods of inter-
action to as many human gene pairs as possible, including those
that were outside of our chemo-genetic screen. For this purpose,
we used data from the chemo-genetic screen to train a regres-
sion model against all four features (Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). In total, we assigned LSs to >100,000 human gene
pairs for which all feature types were available, creating an
extended CoCaNet (CoCaNetX; Table S6). CoCaNetX provides
an extended set of prioritized human interactions including
nearly all human TSGs and DTs for which cross-species data
can be drawn by orthology to yeast. We anticipate that it will
be useful for identifying potential synthetic lethal interactions in
a human gene space orders of magnitude larger than that what
can be experimentally tested with current technology.
Validation of Novel Interactions in Cell Survival Assays
A systematic resource of tumor suppressor interactions moti-
vates many future studies of the feasibility of repurposing an
already approved drug for selective killing of tumor cells based
on specific genetic alterations. We first explored this principle
in cultured tumor cells using the CoCaNet interaction neighbor-
hoods of RAD17 and XRCC3, two tumor suppressor genes
involved in the repair of DNA damage. RAD17 has a homozygous
deletion in approximately 5% of prostate and ovarian cancers
and mutations in approximately 5% of pancreas and stomach
cancers, with sporadic alterations observed in tumors of other
types. XRCC3 is deleted in approximately 4% of bladder and
pancreatic cancers (Cerami et al., 2012).
CoCaNet10 identified that RAD17 was involved in five
conserved
synthetic
sick/lethal
interactions
with
topoiso-
merases TOP1 and TOP2A, checkpoint kinases CHEK1 and 2,
and CSNK1G1, the gamma isoform of casein kinase I (Figure 4A).
Of these interactors, TOP1 and TOP2A are targeted by FDA-
approved drugs, whereas CHEK1 and 2 are targeted by mole-
cules in clinical development (Ashour et al., 2015; Thompson
and Eastman, 2013). CSNK1G1 is known to play a role in tumor-
igenesis, but its specific inhibitors have not yet entered clinical
trials (Schittek and Sinnberg, 2014). Investigations in yeast had
previously identified one of these interactions between the ortho-
logs of RAD17 and TOP1 (Vance and Wilson, 2002), but this
interaction was identified in humans for the first time. We there-
fore examined the combination of chemical inhibitors targeting
each of the five RAD17 interactors with RAD17 knockdown
in clonogenic assays to ascertain whether the reduction in cell
growth observed in the chemo-genetic screen, a cell population
measurement, translates to a reduction in survival of individual
tumor cell clones. We indeed observed that topoisomerase inhi-
bition with irinotecan (anti-TOP1) or etoposide (anti-TOP2A) as
well as casein kinase I inhibition with D4476 (anti-CSNK1G1) re-
sulted in significantly reduced colony formation in the setting of
RAD17 knockdown relative to non-targeting control (Figures
4B–4D; Figure S3A). We also observed severe detrimental ef-
fects on colony formation when combining RAD17 knockdown
with AZD7762, a dual inhibitor of CHEK1 and 2; this interaction
is explored in more detail by Shen et al. (2015).
Turning attention to the tumor suppressor XRCC3, CoCaNet10
showed involvement of this gene in seven conserved synthetic
sick/lethal interactions (Figure 4E). Each of these interactions
was interrogated by clonogenic assays of the relevant drug in
combination with XRCC3 knockdown. To determine whether
the CoCaNet interactions would generalize to human cell lines
other than HeLa, for the XRCC3 neighborhood we elected to
examine whether the interactions could be recovered in a
different cellular background, the LN428 glioblastoma cell line
(Tang et al., 2011). Five of the seven combinations were found
to be associated with a negative effect on LN428 survival in a clo-
nogenic assay, including interactions of XRCC3 with mycophe-
nolate mofetil (MMF, anti-IMPDH1) and vorinostat (a pan-HDAC
inhibitor), both of which are FDA-approved, as well as tipifarnib
(anti-RABGGTB),
rocilinostat
(anti-HDAC6),
and
entinostat
(anti-HDAC1 and 2), which are in clinical development (Figures
4F and 4G; Figures S3B and S3C). The remaining two combina-
tions, PD0325901 (anti-MAP2K1) and disulfiram (anti-ALDH2),
showed no detectable survival effects. Additionally, the synthetic
lethal interaction between the yeast orthologs RPD3 and RAD57
was confirmed in both a synthetic growth array and spot dilution
assays in yeast (Figure 4H; Figure S3D). Together, these studies
show that, of 12 interactions examined in a follow-up clonogenic
assay, 10 could be readily associated with a specific decrease in
tumor cell clonal survival, spanning two cell line backgrounds.
Implications for Clinical Translation of Synthetic Lethal
Interactions
To gauge the clinical relevance of CoCaNet, we explored the as-
sociation of these interactions with differences in clinical out-
comes of cancer patients. Although co-mutation of both genes
of a synthetic lethal pair is too rare of an event to power survival
analysis, it has been shown that patients with tumors for which
both genes of a synthetic sick interaction are under-expressed
tend toward longer survival times (Jerby-Arnon et al., 2014).
This finding is consistent with the idea that decreased function
of both genes promotes synthetic sickness, causing the tumor
to be less robust and leading to improved patient outcomes.
We explored evidence for this principle in the CoCaNet
resource using the Jerby-Arnon et al. (2014) scoring method.
Each of �2,000 breast cancer patients profiled in the Molec-

 counting the number of synthetic sick/lethal interactions in Co-
CaNet10 for which both genes were under-expressed in the pa-
tient’s tumor versus their normal tissue. The 10% of cases with
the highest scores were marked as having potential ‘‘induced
synthetic lethality’’ (ISL). The survival curve of these ISL cases
was then compared to the 10% of patients with the lowest
scores (non-ISL patients).
Indeed, we found that ISL patients had significantly longer sur-
vival times relative to non-ISL patients (Figure 5A; p = 6 3 10�4).
Median survival had not yet been reached in this cohort;

 however, the upper-quartile survival time for ISL patients was
6 years greater (9.1 years versus 3.1 years; Figure 5B). The
greatest contribution to increased survival was from SL interac-
tion of BLM and CHEK1, which were under-expressed in 162 of
196 ISL cases, followed by BLM and CHEK2 (Figure 5C; Table
S5B lists the contribution to patient survival of all CoCaNet
interactions). Survival stratification similar to CoCaNet10 was
observed when defining ISL patients purely by human chemo-
genetic interactions independent of evolutionary conservation
(CoCaNetHuman) and with the extended network predicted
from the integrated LS score (CoCaNetX). These survival differ-
ences were also similar to those that had been observed by
the original developers of this scoring approach for a different
set of computationally derived synthetic lethal interactions
(Jerby-Arnon et al., 2014; Figure 5B). Thus, the synthetic sick/
lethal interactions in CoCaNet appear relevant to the clinical
response of human tumors by this type of survival analysis.
DISCUSSION
Synthetic lethality has been of increasing interest as a strategy
for cancer therapy, supported by major research investment
and recent clinical success (Lord et al., 2015). Here we have real-
ized an original proposal of Hartwell et al. (1997) in which
comprehensive synthetic lethal interaction maps in yeast serve
as a central resource for identifying therapeutic combinations
of gene mutations and drugs in humans. Although this proposal
was advanced nearly 20 years ago, the majority of the relevant
tumor suppressor interactions in either yeast or humans are be-
ing made available here for the first time. In particular, five
network maps are included as part of the resource: the complete
network of genetic interactions between TSGs and DTs in yeast
(Table S2), the corresponding orthologous network of chemo-
genetic interactions in humans (CoCaNetHuman; Figure 2;
Table S4), the intersection of these datasets to derive networks
of conserved interactions at two stringencies (CoCaNet2,
CoCaNet10; Figure 3; Table S5B), and an extended network of
predicted interactions among all human TSGs and DTs based
on rules learned from study of the first four networks (CoCaNetX;
Table S6).
Armed with a systematic map of tumor suppressor-drug inter-
actions, one can begin to functionally interpret the catalog of mu-
tations identified in cancer genome sequencing studies and to
suggest therapies that might be repurposed against mutations
identified in a new patient. For instance, the inhibitor of type I top-
oisomerases irinotecan is currently only indicated by the FDA for
use in colon cancer. The conserved network resource developed
here suggests that topoisomerase inhibitors should be evaluated
for efficacy in cancers harboring loss-of-function alterations in
RAD17 (Figures 3C and 4A). Similarly, HDAC inhibitors such as
vorinostat are currently approved for the treatment of cutaneous
T cell lymphoma. Our results suggest that these drugs should
also be evaluated for efficacy against tumors with XRCC3 loss
of function (Figures 3D and 4E). As clinical genomic sequencing

 becomes more common, the synthetic-lethal maps provided by
CoCaNetHuman, CoCaNet2/10, and CoCaNetX may become
increasingly valuable tools to understand exceptional responses
to therapy (Al-Ahmadie et al., 2014). In addition, these networks
can continue to be curated as they are used to guide further
in vitro and in vivo investigation and, ultimately, by molecular tu-
mor boards to help identify targeted therapy for individual cancer
patients (Schwaederle et al., 2014). Communal sharing, revision,
and evolution of networks is a key feature of the NDEx database
in which these networks are deposited (Pratt et al., 2015). The
potential effect of CoCaNet on precision cancer therapy is large
because more than 40% of TCGA patients have loss of function
in at least one TSG with a synthetic lethal interaction involving the
target of a currently FDA-approved drug (Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures; Figure 5D).
A specific example of how CoCaNet might be used to derive
clinically actionable information involves a synthetic-sick/le-
thal interaction identified between irinotecan and ATM. In
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), treatment with either
FOLFIRI (5-flourouracil plus irinotecan) or FOLFOX (5-flourour-
acil plus oxaliplatin) is indicated, with a response rate to either
regimen of approximately 40%. However, diagnostic tests to
determine which regimen will be most likely to induce a
response for an individual patient are lacking (Choueiri et al.,
2015). Because irinotecan is synthetic sick/lethal with ATM,
FOLFIRI may be the preferred regimen in the 7% of mCRC tu-
mors for which ATM has an inactivating mutation (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network, 2012). Examination of TCGA mCRC
cohort identifies 16 ATM-mutated patients, of which 6 were
initially treated with irinotecan. In these patients, there is
indeed a 15-month trend toward better survival (44 months
versus 29 months for other regimens). Given the small sample
size, this trend is not presently significant (log-rank p = 0.3),
but it does prompt a follow-up study of ATM as a marker for
irinotecan therapy.
Other examples of potential clinical translation are found in the
genetic interaction profiles of three of the traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic drugs—vinorelbine, methotrexate, and irino-
tecan. Although each of these drugs has a distinct mechanism
of action, all have strong interactions with multiple cancer genes
involved in cell cycle regulation (CDK12, CDC73, CHEK1, and
WEE1) (Figure 2C; Figure S4A). Yet another interaction cluster
of interest combines commonly mutated genes in DNA damage
response pathways (BRCA1, XRCC3, BLM, WRN, and ATAD5)
with multiple chemical inhibitors of the checkpoint kinases
(MK-8776, MK-1775, and AZD7762) (Figure 2C; Figure S4B).
Of note, interactions with Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) and
the checkpoint kinases CHEK1 and CHEK2 were the strongest
contributors to the survival stratification seen in the METABRIC
cohort (Figure 5C). Both CHEK1 and CHEK2 can phosphorylate
BLM, a RecQ family DNA helicase that participates in homolo-
gous recombination, telomere maintenance, and DNA replica-
tion (Kaur et al., 2010). Such results are consistent with prior
reports of synthetic lethal interactions between checkpoint ki-
nase inhibitors and other DNA repair genes, including TP53,
CDKN1A, and RAD17 and multiple members of the Fanconi ane-
mia pathway, as well as the fact that checkpoint kinase inhibitors
synergize with radiation (Chen et al., 2009; Origanti et al., 2013;
Shen et al., 2015). The interaction cluster observed here
suggests the existence of a large synthetic lethal network con-
necting DNA repair to cell cycle checkpoints. Given that loss-
of-function events in any individual gene are typically rare in
cancer (Hofree et al., 2013), the ability to identify clusters of
interactions among related TSGs and drugs could allow for
aggregating individual ‘‘N-of-1’’ patients (Collette and Tombal,
2015) into larger cohorts for more robust clinical investigation
of these combinations.
As genetic interaction maps are further developed and
refined in studies of human cancer, a worthy question concerns
the continued value of prior screening in model organisms like
yeast. Our analysis highlights several ways in which cross-spe-
cies data may continue to be quite valuable. First, rapid screens
in model organisms allow for very large interaction test spaces
and multi-condition designs in preparation for more challenging
interaction screens in humans. In this regard, screening the
complete space of human TSG-DT genetic interactions is likely
to remain inaccessible for some time and certainly with the
precision enabled by model organism genetics. Second, an
interaction conserved in yeast anchors the new finding to an
experimentally tractable organism in which follow-up studies
of mechanism of action may be more readily pursued. Finally,
conservation in multiple species, especially those as evolution-
arily divergent as yeast and humans, suggests that these inter-
actions involve core elements of the eukaryotic cell. Might
this mean that these cross-species-conserved interactions
will also be relevant across a wide range of cancer cells with
diverse cell lineages and genetic alterations? Although this
possibility deserves further study, one might take comfort in
synthetic-lethal interactions that not only relate to human cells
but to creatures evolutionary divergent by more than a billion
years (Nei et al., 2001).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generating the Yeast Genetic Interaction Data
We constructed all possible mutants between yeast orthologs (Table S1B) of
the query and array genes listed in Table S1A using SGA technology (Tong
and Boone, 2006). In the final step, double mutants were pinned on agar plates
containing no drugs (untreated), hydroxyurea (100 mM), bleomycin (5 mg/ml), or
hydrogen peroxide (0.01%) and incubated at 30�C for either 48 hr (untreated)
or 72 hr (hydroxyurea, bleomycin, and hydrogen peroxide). Pictures of the
plates were taken with a Canon charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and
colony sizes were quantified using HT Colony Grid Analyzer. Finally, data
were normalized, and S scores were computed using the epistatic miniarray
profile (E-MAP) toolbox (Collins et al., 2006). All data are provided in Table
S2. Note that data are provided for 79,184 gene pairs. These include additional
data from queries/arrays screened that had no human ortholog but were
included for quality control purposes.
Generating the Human Chemo-genetic Interaction Map
Starting with the DT with the greatest number of synthetic lethal interactions,
we used the Drug Gene Interaction database (Griffith et al., 2013) to identify
a chemical inhibitor for the first 21 of these genes. When multiple compounds
were available per DT, priority was given to drugs currently approved by
the FDA.
For the chemo-genetic screen, 500 cells were dispensed per well in 384-well
plates and reverse-transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 10 nM
using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Life Technologies). The 21 drugs were split
into four batches. For each batch, two plates containing only DMSO solvent
522

 were included so that the toxicity of siRNAs alone could be evaluated. Each
TSG was targeted by four different siRNAs (On-Target-Plus Human Genome
Collection, Dharmacon) pooled in the same well. Three independent replicates
for each TSG were screened on separate assay plates at both IC20 and IC40
doses.
