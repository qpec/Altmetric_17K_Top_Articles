IntroductIon
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are now recognized as im-
portant regulators of multiple facets of immunity, spanning 
host defense, inflammation, metabolic homeostasis, and tis-
sue repair (Flach and Diefenbach, 2015; ; Sonnenberg and 
Artis, 2015; Klose and Artis, 2016; Monticelli et al., 2016). 
ILCs provide the initial innate cellular responses, normally 
within mucosal barriers, that initiate and orchestrate sys-
temic adaptive immunity (Klose and Artis, 2016). Group 
2 ILCs (ILC2s) were first discovered as the cell sentinels 
responding to helminth worm infection that evoked the 
generation of adaptive type 2 immunity, which functioned 
in mediating worm rejection, allergic immunity, and repair 
and resolution of tissue damage (Fort et al., 2001; Fallon et 
al., 2006; Moro et al., 2010; Neill et al., 2010; Price et al., 
2010; Saenz et al., 2010). They are predominantly found at 
mucosal barriers, such as human and mouse lungs, where 
they play roles in the initiation of protective immunity, 
and as effector cells during allergen-induced type 2 airway 
inflammation, virus infection, and antiparasite responses 
(Monticelli et al., 2011; Halim et al., 2012; Gorski et al., 
2013). ILC2s are activated by the alarmins IL-33, IL-25, 
and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which are released 
during tissue injury (Kim et al., 2013; Salimi et al., 2013). 
Upon activation, ILC2s release large amounts of type 2 
cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, and also IL-4, as well as IL-9 and 
amphiregulin, which contribute to tissue repair (Turner et 
al., 2013; Monticelli et al., 2015).
There is emerging evidence that ILC2s or ILC3s can 
directly influence Th cell polarization and functions (Hep-
worth et al., 2013, 2015; Mirchandani et al., 2014; von Burg 
et al., 2015). It has been recently described that ILC2s ex-
press MHC class II molecules and can augment 
Th2 polariza-
tion (Oliphant et al., 2014; Halim et al., 2016). Furthermore, 
ICOS and ICOS-L are activating coreceptors shown to be 
present on ILC2s (Maazi et al., 2015). The engagement of 
PD-1, primarily expressed on T cells, via its ligands PD-L1 
and PD-L2 delivers an inhibitory signal to the PD-1–bearing 
cell (Agata et al., 1996; Freeman et al., 2000; Latchman et al., 
2001; Barber et al., 2006). Inhibition via PD-1 engagement 
enables tumor cells to keep the adaptive immune response in 
check, and we have shown that parasites such as Schistosoma 
mansoni also use PD-L1–mediated immunosuppression to 
evade the adaptive immune system (Smith et al., 2004; Keir 
et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2015). Although described as an in-
hibitory interaction partner of PD-1, evidence also supports 
an activating function for PD-L1 (Liechtenstein et al., 2012). 
During Listeria monocytogenes infection, PD-L1 delivers 
positive costimulatory signals to innate and adaptive immune 
cells to protect from intracellular infection (Seo et al., 2008). 
PD-1 engagement can generate induced regulatory T cells, 
and PD-L1 costimulates T cell responses against polyclonal 
stimuli (Dong et al., 1999; del Rio et al., 2005; McAlees et al., 
2015). So far, little is known of the involvement of PD-L1 in 
the control of strong type 2 immune responses.
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILc2s) are important effector cells driving the initiation of type 2 immune responses leading 
to adaptive t helper 2 (th2) immunity. Here we show that ILc2s dynamically express the checkpoint inhibitor molecule Pd-L1 
during type 2 pulmonary responses. Surprisingly, Pd 
-L1 
:Pd 
-1 interaction between ILc2s and cd4+ t cells did not inhibit the t 
cell response, but Pd-L1–expressing ILc2s stimulated increased expression of GAtA3 and production of IL-13 by th2 cells both 
in vitro and in vivo. conditional deletion of Pd-L1 on ILc2s impaired early th2 polarization and cytokine production, leading 
to delayed worm expulsion during infection with the gastrointestinal helminth nippostrongylus brasiliensis. our results identify 
a novel Pd-L1–controlled mechanism for type 2 polarization, with ILc2s mediating an innate checkpoint to control adaptive 
t helper responses, which has important implications for the treatment of type 2 inflammation.

In the present study, we used the gastrointestinal hel-
minth model Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a potent inducer 
of ILC2s (Neill et al., 2010), to address a new mechanism of 
ILC2 activation of type 2 responses. After infection through 
the skin, N. brasiliensis migrates to the lung and, after pass-
ing through the stomach, lives in the small intestine, where 
the subsequent generation of the strong type 2 immune re-
sponse in the lung and intestine mediates IL-13–dependent 
worm expulsion (Camberis et al., 2003). During primary 
infection, ILC2s are the most important initial effector cell 
type mediating the expulsion of the worms through several 
mechanisms, such as Tuft and goblet cell activation, Th2 dif-
ferentiation and dendritic cell maturation, cytokine release, 
and initiation of tissue repair mechanisms through the ac-
tivation of alternatively activated macrophages (Oliphant et 
al., 2014; Oeser et al., 2015; Halim et al., 2016; von Moltke 
et al., 2016). Here, we discovered that ILC2s can dynamically 
express PD-L1 and, through interaction with T cells, pro-
mote early GATA3 up-regulation, which paves the way for 
a robust adaptive anti-helminth Th2 cell–mediated response. 
These results highlight the importance of PD-L1–expressing 
ILC2s as an innate checkpoint for adaptive Th2 polarization 
and provide new insights into PD-L1–mediated activation of 
T cells and type 2 immunity.
reSuLtS And dIScuSSIon
Identification of a Pd-L1–expressing ILc2 population
Recent work has shown that ILC2s enhance the immune 
response against N. brasiliensis by instigating an MHC II–
dependent dialog with CD4 T cells (Oliphant et al., 2014). 
Unlike the anti-inflammatory function of ILC3s (Hepworth 
et al., 2015), which lack the expression of canonical costim-
ulatory molecules, ILC2s do express CD80, CD86, ICOS, 
ICOS-L, and KLRG-1 (Fallon et al., 2006; Neill et al., 2010; 
Oliphant et al., 2014; Maazi et al., 2015). For ICOS and its li-
gand ICOS-L, it has been described that they are required for 
optimal activity of ILC2s during airway inflammation (Maazi 
et al., 2015). We sought to identify whether other costimula-
tory molecules were expressed by ILC2s during their initial 
expansion and before the adaptive type 2 immune response is 
induced (Voehringer et al., 2004; Neill et al., 2010). 
WT mice 
were infected with N. brasiliensis, and up-regulation of co-
stimulatory markers on ILC2s was analyzed (Figs. 1 a and S1, 
a and b). We observed up-regulation of MHC II molecules, 
CD25, ICOS, and ICOS-L on ILC2s, as reported (Oliph-
ant et al., 2014; Maazi et al., 2015). PD-1 was up-regulated 
on a small subset of lung ILC2s after N. brasiliensis infection 
(Fig. 1 a), albeit to a lesser extent than reported recently (Yu 
et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2017). PD-L1, but not PD-L2, was 
highly up-regulated on all ILC2s during the course of infec-
tion (Fig. 1, a–c). PD-L1 deficiency did not influence expres-
sion of other costimulatory molecules on ILC2s (Fig. S1 b). 
PD-L1 was not expressed by ILC2 progenitors (Fig. S1 c), as 
recently reported (Yu et al., 2016). A time course analysis of 
lung-resident ILC2s revealed the highest expression of PD-L1 
5 d after infection, coincident with the peak of ILC2 activ-
ity and PD-1 expression on CD4 T cells in this model, with 
decreased frequency of PD-L1+ ILC2s after the resolution of 
the innate immune response when the adaptive response de-
velops with the expansion of Th2 cells (Fig. 1 c). The level of 
up-regulation of PD-L1 expression on ILC2s from infected 
mice was comparable to that of activated DCs (Figs. 1 d and S1 
d). Natural ILC2s (lin−CD45+Thy1+Sca-1+ST2+KLRG1int) 
were the major ILC2 population expanding during N. brasil-
iensis infection, consistent with earlier findings (Huang et al., 
2015), with natural ILC2s preferentially up-regulating PD-L1 
(Fig. S1 e). Of note, PD-L1 up-regulation is not a mouse 
strain–specific or helminth infection–specific phenomenon, 
as mice on a BALB/c background increase PD-L1 expres-
sion on ILC2s after N. brasiliensis infection (Fig. S1 f), and 
increased PD-L1-expression on ILC2s was also observed after 
papain-induced lung inflammation (Fig. S1 g).
Pd-L1 is required for worm expulsion
T
o address the relevance of PD-L1–mediated costimulation 
during type 2 immune responses, we infected 
WT and PD-L1–
deficient Cd274−/− (PD-L1−/−) mice with N. brasiliensis. 
PD-L1–deficient mice exhibited higher worm burdens 7 d 
after infection, when WT mice had largely cleared the infec-
tion (Figs. 1 e and S1 h). PD-L1 deficiency did not impair the 
in WT C57BL/6 before and after infection with N. brasiliensis in comparison with FMO control and PD-L1−/− control. (c) Graphs depict PD-L1 expression on

production of type 2 cytokines from ILC2s (Fig. 1 f). 
The delay 
in worm expulsion may be the result of diminished generation 
of a functional type 2 immunity that mediates worm rejection, 
known as weep and sweep (Anthony et al., 2007), as illustrated 
by the significantly (P < 0.05) reduced intestinal goblet cell 
hyperplasia and mucus production in PD-L1−/− mice relative 
to WT mice (Fig. 1 g). Importantly, the impaired immune 
response is not caused by altered expansion of ILC2s or CD4+ 
T cells in the lungs of PD-L1−/− mice (Fig. S1, i and j) or the 
ILC2 inhibitory cytokines IFNγ and IL-27 (not depicted). 
Because the receptor PD-1 is predominantly expressed on 
T cells, we were interested in whether PD-L1 expression on 
ILC2s is dependent on contact with cells of the adaptive im-
mune system. Upon N. brasiliensis infection, ILC2s in Rag1−/− 
mice had up-regulated PD-L1 compared with naive controls 
and dual PD-L1−/−/Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 1 h). T cell– and 
MHC2-independent up-regulation of PD-L1 on ILC2s was 
further confirmed in N. brasiliensis–infected MHC2−/− mice, 
which lack CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1 i). Therefore, we conclude 
that helminth infection leads to an early innate activation of 
a PD-L1–expressing ILC2 population. Of note, group 1 and 
group 3 ILC subpopulations express PD-L1 in the steady state 
(Fig. 1 j). However, PD-L1 was up-regulated only on ILC2s, 
predominantly in the lung, during helminth infection, and we 
therefore focused on addressing roles of PD-L1 expression on 
pulmonary ILC2 function during early events of the infection.
Activation of ILc2s up-regulates Pd-L1
T
o further delineate the requirements for PD-L1 expression 
on ILC2s, we isolated ILC2s and expanded them in vitro 
with various known ILC2 activators (Moro et al., 2015). IL-7, 
which is required for in vitro survival of ILCs, did not alter 
PD-L1 expression on ILC2s. Addition of IL-2 or IL-33 led to 
a significant increase in surface PD-L1 expression in ILC2s, 
with IL-33 being the more potent inducer, whereas IL-25 did 
not have an effect on PD-L1 expression (Fig. 2 a). Injection 
of WT mice with recombinant cytokines confirmed the 
selective up-regulation of PD-L1 on ILC2s in response to 
IL-33, but not IL-25 (Fig. 2 b). Conversely, infection of mice 
deficient in the receptors for IL-33 or IL-25 demonstrated 
that PD-L1 up-regulation was ablated only in the absence of 
IL-33–mediated ST2 signaling (Fig. 2 c). Additionally, in vivo 
expansion of ILC2s after injection of IL 
-2 
:anti 
-IL 
-2 complexes 
into Rag1−/− mice further confirmed the up-regulation of 
PD-L1 expression on activated ILC2s (Fig. 2 d). These data 
demonstrate that activation of lung ILC2s leads to increased 
surface expression of PD-L1.
In light of the recent finding that ILC2 progenitors 
expressed PD-1 (Yu et al., 2016), we investigated whether 
deficiency in PD-L1 affected cytokine expression by ILC2s 
because of a lack of PD 
-1 
:PD 
-L1 interactions during ILC2 
development. We expanded ILC2s in vitro and analyzed 
production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by flow cytometry 
(Fig. 2 e). Interestingly, the majority of ILC2s produced 
IL-4 in vitro, with only a few single producers of IL-5 or 
IL-13. Their capacity to produce IL-5 and IL-13 has been 
investigated in depth and accounts for most of their effector 
functions. Although ILC2s were discovered in IL-4 reporter 
mice (Fallon et al., 2006), their relative contribution to the 
innate-derived IL-4 pool is less clear (Pelly et al., 2016). 
However, there was no difference between ILC2s generated 
from WT or PD-L1−/− mice regarding their expression of 
type 2 cytokines (Fig. 2 e). Analysis of PD-L1+ and PD-L1− 
ILC2s in N. brasiliensis–infected WT mice revealed no 
significant alterations in the proportions of type 2 cytokine 
producers in the two compartments (Fig. 2 f). Because 
PD-L1+ and PD-L1− ILC2s did not differ in their ability to 
produce type 2 cytokines in vitro and in vivo, we concluded 
that the delayed worm rejection in PD-L1–deficient mice 
was not caused by an inability of ILC2s to produce the 
key worm rejection effector cytokine IL-13. Therefore, we 
sought to determine whether PD-L1+ ILC2s could directly 
influence CD4+ T cells.
Pd-L1–mediated Pd-1 engagement 
leads to th2 polarization
It has been shown that ILC2s enter a dialog with T cells in 
the context of N. brasiliensis infection, which ultimately leads 
to an increase of IL-13 produced from 
T cells (Oliphant et al., 
2014). We co-cultured naive CD4+ T cells alone or together 
with ILC2s from WT or PD-L1−/− mice to determine 
whether the absence of a PD-L1 checkpoint signal on 
ILC2s leads to uncontrolled T cell differentiation and type 
2 immunopathology. Surprisingly, PD-L1–expressing ILC2s 
stimulated CD4 T cells under nonpolarizing conditions to 
significantly increase GATA3 protein expression and IL-13 
production (Figs. 3 a and S2 a). Importantly, interference with 
PD

group. Histogram overlay shows representative PD-L1 expression on ILC2s. (e) ILC2s were isolated from lungs of naive WT and PD-L1−/− mice, expanded in 
vitro for 5 d (IL-2, IL-7, and IL-33; 10 ng/ml each), stimulated for the final 5 h with PMA/ionomycin in the presence of monensin, and stained intracellularly

the ability to present antigen via MHC II or increase cell death 
of 
T cells in the co-cultures (Figs. 3 b and S2 b). Furthermore, 
in our ILC2 
:CD4 T cell co-culture system, GATA3 
up-regulation was dependent on PD-1 expression on CD4 T 
cells and direct cell–cell contact (Fig. 3, c and d). T
o confirm 
the effect of PD-L1 on CD4 T cell polarization, recombinant 
PD-L1 chimeric fusion protein, in which mouse PD-L1 is 
fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (PD-L1-Fc), was 
used to ligate PD-1 on 
T cells (McAlees et al., 2015). Purified 
naive T cells cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody 
and PD-L1-Fc, or human IgG1 control, up-regulated GATA3 
protein (Figs. 3 e and S2, c and d) in a manner that operates 
independently of IL-4– and IL-13–mediated signaling 
via IL-4Rα (Fig. 3 f). Of note, the expression of FOXP3, 
RORγt, and TBET on Th cells was not significantly altered 
by PD-L1-Fc stimulation (Fig. 3 e). Furthermore, stimulation 
of naive CD4+ 
T cells isolated from PD-1–deficient Pdcd1−/− 
mice with PD-L1-Fc did not increase GATA3 expression 
(Fig. 3 g). As a consequence of the increased early GATA3 
expression, PD-L1–stimulated T cells produced more IL-4, 
IL-5, and IL-13 under nonpolarizing (Th0), as well as 
Th2-polarizing, conditions (Figs. 3 h and S2 e). In contrast, 
the presence of PD-L1-Fc under Th17-polarizing conditions 
did not alter cytokine expression. Similar to PD-L1-Fc, 
stimulation with PD-L2-Fc (but not PD-1-Fc) led to an 
increase in GATA3 expression (Fig. 3 i). In summary, we 
provide direct evidence that PD-L1 selectively induces Th0 
cells to differentiate into Th2-polarized cells.
PD-L1–mediated costimulatory activity has been 
reported previously (Bennett et al., 2003; McAlees et al., 
2015), and recently it has been found that PD-L1 and PD-L2 
compete for binding to PD-1 on T cells during experimental 
Plasmodium infection (Karunarathne et al., 2016). Here, PD 
-L1 
:PD 
-1 interactions inhibit Th1 cell responses, whereas 
PD-L2 on DCs prevents T cell inhibition. In contrast to N. 
brasiliensis, control of acute malarial parasitemia is dependent 
on IFNγ-producing T cells and highlights the dynamic 
regulation of T helper subsets via PD-1. That PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 can have differential effects when binding to PD-1 
present on CD4 
T cells was described more than a decade ago 
(Dong et al., 1999), and more recent studies show different 
conformational changes when PD-1 interacts with PD-L1 or 
PD-L2 (Ghiotto et al., 2010). Studies showing an inhibitory 
function rely on Th1- or Th17-biased models. During S. 
mansoni infections, PD-L1 is up-regulated on macrophages, 
inhibiting IFNγ-producing T cell responses (Smith et al., 
2004). Although PD-L1 is up-regulated on macrophages in 
the presence of IFNγ, IL-4 up-regulates PD-L2 expression, 
reflecting the segregation of the negative feedback loops 
between Th1 and Th2 responses (Loke and Allison, 2003; 
Huber et al., 2010; Ishiwata et al., 2010).
It is currently not clear what leads to the increased ex-
pression of GATA3 in naive CD4 T cells upon PD-1 engage-
ment. Possible explanations include T
-bet down-regulation, 
which can repress GATA3 (Usui et al., 2006); decreased 
TCR 
signaling strength, which favors Th2 differentiation (Con-
stant et al., 1995) and full T cell activation (Valitutti et al., 
1995; Hansen et al., 2011); STAT modulation (Amarnath et 
al., 2011); and shifts in the mTOR complex balance (Yang 
et al., 2013), or combinations thereof. Depending on the 
cytokine microenvironment, PD-1 signaling modulates the 
signals received by the CD4 T cells and shifts the balance 
toward activating differentiation (Th2 and Treg) or inhibiting 
proliferation (Th1 and Th17). Herein, we show that PD-L1 
engagement of PD-1 on naive CD4+ cells preferentially ex-
pands Th2 cells in vitro.

Rag2−/−γc
−/− mice deficient in ILCs and T and B cells and 
infected the mice with N. brasiliensis to expand Th2 cells. 
Mice receiving PD-L1–deficient ILC2s—with disrupted 
ILC2–T cell dialog—had a significantly impaired ability to 
mount an efficient type 2 immune response after infection, 
as indicated by a significant decrease in GATA3+ Th2 cells 
and eosinophils, leading to reduced ability to expel worms 
(Fig. 4, a–d). Importantly, transfer of PD-L1–expressing ILC2s 
together with Pdcd1−/− CD4 T cells abrogated protective 
immunity (Fig. 4, c and d). 
This confirms that ILC2 expression 
of PD-L1 mediates Th2 cell expansion in vivo.
ILc2-specific deletion of Pd-L1 
impairs anti-helminth response
Although adoptive transfers of ILCs into Rag2−/−γc
−/− have 
become a standard procedure assessing the functional role 
of ILC2s, it remains an artificial system, which lacks almost 
all components of the innate and adaptive immune system 
and does not formally address ILC2-specific functions. We 
therefore generated a novel mouse with a loxP-flanked 
Cd274 gene (PD-L1fl/fl; Fig. S3, a and b). Successful excision

(Fig. S3 b). By crossing PD-L1fl/fl mice to mice expressing 
Cre within the ILC population (IL7RaCre), we efficiently 
knocked down PD-L1 expression on ILC2s to levels 
found in a PD-L1−/− mouse (Fig. 4, e and f). Mice with a 
disruption of the PD 
-1 
:PD 
-L1 crosstalk between T cells 
and ILC2s had significantly impaired N. brasiliensis worm 
rejection (Figs. 4 g and S3 c). Expulsion of N. brasiliensis is 
critically dependent on CD4 T cells and IL-13 production 
(Barner et al., 1998; Urban et al., 1998). Consistent with 
the absence of a functional type 2 response to mediate 
worm expulsion, CD4+ T cell expression of GATA3 was 
decreased in conditional ILC-PD-L1 knockout mice 
compared with control mice (Fig. 4 h), with a significant 
decrease in IL-13– and IL-5–expressing CD4 T cells, but 
not ILC2s (Fig. 4, i and j; and Fig. S3 d). Expulsion during 
the primary infection is critically dependent on IL-4 and 
IL-13 and T cells (Voehringer et al., 2006); however, T 
cell–derived IL-4/13 is dispensable for worm expulsion 
by day 9 but required for the recruitment of other effector 
cells such as eosinophils, basophils, and ILC2s (Oeser et 
al., 2015). Indeed, we observed a decrease in eosinophils 
in both PD-L1fl/-IL7RαCre/+ and PD-L1−/− mice (Fig. 4 k 
and not depicted). Further, we observed significantly 
impaired intestinal activation in PD-L1fl/-IL7RαCre/+ mice 
after infection (Fig. 4 l). A recent study has shown that 
DCs up-regulate PD-L1 after N. brasiliensis infection in an 
IFNα/β receptor (IFN 
AR)–dependent manner (Connor 
et al., 2017); however, our conditional knockout did not 
alter PD-L1 expression on DC. 
Yet we do not exclude the 
possibility that there is a function for PD-L1–mediated 
activation by DCs in certain immune states.
A tissue-specific checkpoint control mechanism that 
governs Th2 differentiation during N. brasiliensis infection 
has been described (Van Dyken et al., 2016). Others have 
shown that during N. brasiliensis infection, T cells can be po-
larized toward Th2 in a Stat6- and IL-4–independent man-
ner (van Panhuys et al., 2008). Our study identifies a novel 
mechanism whereby PD-L1–expressing ILC2s function as a 
pulmonary checkpoint of Th2 differentiation.
As we had used an IL7RαCre, which deletes 
PD-L1 also on T cells, it is important to point out that 
the immune response against N. brasiliensis was intact 
in PD-L1fl/-CD4Cre/+, confirming no role for PD-L1 
expression on 
T cells in this model (Fig. S3, e–g). 
To further 
restrict PD-L1 deficiency to the ILC lineage, we generated 
PD-L1fl/flID2CreERT2 mice. Tamoxifen administration 
induced specific knockdown of PD-L1 expression in ILC2s 
but not other cell types (Figs. 4 m and S3 h). 
We confirmed 
that treatment with tamoxifen did not interfere with the 
immune response of WT mice against N. brasiliensis, and 
only tamoxifen-treated PD-L1fl/flID2CreERT2 mice, unlike 
their untreated littermates, exhibited increased worm 
burdens (Fig. 4 m). Finally, we investigated whether PD-1 
was required for an efficient immune response against N. 
brasiliensis. Although the infection was cleared in Pdcd1−/− 
mice, up-regulation of GATA3 in CD4 T cells was 
impaired to the same extent as observed in PD-L1−/− mice; 
however, cytokine production by Pdcd1−/− ILC2s was 
enhanced, accounting for the accelerated worm clearance 
(Fig. S3, i and j). These results are in line with recent 
articles describing PD-1 as an important developmental 
inhibitor of ILC2s (Yu et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2017). 
During reinfections, we did not observe a contribution of 
PD-L1 to the immune response (unpublished data), which 
was to be expected because other T cell–independent 
mechanisms have been shown to be responsible for the 
elimination of N. brasiliensis before they complete their 
life cycle in previously infected mice—namely antibodies, 
basophils, eosinophils, and macrophages (Knott et al., 2007; 
Chen et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2014). Collectively, our 
results demonstrate that PD-L1 expression on pulmonary 
ILC2s is critically required to fully instruct CD4 T cells 
to differentiate into IL-13–producing Th2 effector cells. 
Although ILC2s are capable to induce naive CD4 T cells 
to differentiate to Th2 cells in vitro and also after adoptive 
cell transfer in vivo, in a natural infection ILC2s are more 
likely to interact with primed T cells within the lung, 
where PD 
-L1 
:PD 
-1 interaction represents a checkpoint 
for the further activation of effector Th2 functions.
concluding remarks
With the present study, we have discovered a new mechanism 
by which ILC2s regulate T cell fate and demonstrate a novel 
activating role of PD-L1 costimulation during helminth in-
fections. This activating function of PD-1 engagement is of 
particular interest because it will have consequences during 
cancer treatment assessment (Ribas and Hu-Lieskovan, 2016). 
Treatment of PD-L1+ cancers with blocking anti–PD-1 or 
anti–PD-L1 antibodies may lead to adverse side effects, such 
as psoriasis, colitis, or pneumonia (Postow, 2015). In light of

our data, this may be a consequence of altering the mainte-
nance of the Th2 response in skin, lung, and intestine in favor 
of empowering the Th1 response and therefore leading to 
immunopathology. Indeed, PD-1 blockade in patients with 
prostate and advanced melanoma enhances Th1 and Th17 re-
sponses at the cost of suppressing Th2 responses (Dulos et 
al., 2012). As we have observed, IL-33 up-regulates PD-L1 
on ILC2s, and a similar pathway may up-regulate PD-L1 in 
different cancers. This is particularly important because ST2 
expression and high IL-33 levels are associated with worse 
prognosis (Mertz et al., 2015).
In summary, we have identified that PD-L1 expression 
on ILC2 mediates innate CD4 T cell dialog within the lung 
to checkpoint adaptive Th2 polarization, leading to a more 
robust functional type 2 immune response that mediates 
worm expulsion (Fig. 5). However, it still remains to be 
shown how pulmonary interactions affect intestinal worm 
clearance, and although we think it is likely that similar 
mechanisms govern ILC2 
:CD4 T cell interactions in the 
intestinal tract, this needs to be investigated in more detail. 
This novel ILC2-controlled differentiation checkpoint 
governs the Th2 response to ultimately break the helminth 
life cycle but may also have important implications during 
allergic type 2–mediated inflammatory diseases.

Study design
Groups of age- and sex-matched mice were infected with the 
gastrointestinal helminth N. brasiliensis. Parameters analyzed 
included flow cytometric analysis of lung tissue, serum anti-
body concentrations, and determination of worm numbers 
in the small intestines of experimental animals. In the study, 
n refers to the number of animals used in any particular ex-
periment or the number of individual replicates (in vitro). All 
experiments were repeated at least once.
Mice
Cd274loxP (PD-L1fl/fl) mice were generated on a B6 back-
ground by Taconic Biosciences according to the targeting 
strategy described in Fig. S3. In brief, LoxP sites were in-
troduced by homologous recombination flanking the start 
codon and the first two coding exons (exons 2 and 3) of 
Cd274. C57BL/6J mice were originally obtained from the 
Jackson Laboratory, and a colony is maintained on site. B7-
H1−/− (PD-L1−/−) mice were originally obtained from L. 
Chen (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and maintained 
on a C57BL/6 background. Il7rtm1.1(icre)Hrr (IL7RαCre) mice 
were as described (Schlenner et al., 2010). B6-Rag2tm1Fwa 
Il2rgtm1Wjl (Rag2−/−γc
−/−) and B6.129S6-Rag2tm1Fwa Tg(Tcra-
Tcrb)425Cbn were purchased from Taconic Biosciences. 
Id2tm1.1(cre/ERT2)Blh (Rawlins et al., 2009) and Pdcd1−/− (Keir et 
al., 2007) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. 
Il4ratm1Sz (Noben-Trauth et al., 1997) were obtained from 
the Jackson Laboratory and backcrossed to B6 background 
for >12 generations. Il1rl1tm1Anjm (ST2−/−), Il17br−/−, and 
MHC2−/− were previously described (Cosgrove et al., 1991; 
T
ownsend et al., 2000; Neill et al., 2010). 
Animals were housed 
in a specific pathogen–free facility in individually ventilated 
cages under positive pressure. Mice had ad libitum access to 
food and water. All animal experiments were performed in 
compliance with Irish Medicines Board/Health Products 
Regulatory Authority regulations and approved by the Trin-
ity College Dublin’s BioResources ethics review board.
n. brasiliensis infection
N. brasiliensis is maintained by passage through Wistar rats. 
Mice 6–8 wk of age were injected subcutaneously with 
500 live infective L3-stage N. brasiliensis larvae and killed 
by cervical dislocation for analysis at the indicated time 
points after infection.
tissue preparation and flow cytometry
Lungs were flushed with PBS before extraction to remove 
blood cells. Lungs were minced and incubated with 100 µg/
ml collagenase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C. Single-cells 
suspension were obtained through filtering through a 100-
µm (lungs) or 70-µm (lymph nodes and spleens) cell strainer 
(BD). For the preparation of cells from the small intestine, 
mesenteric fat and Peyer’s patches were removed before the 
small intestine was longitudinally cut open and incubated 
Figure 5. Working model. Helminth- or allergen-inflicted epithelial 
damage leads to the release of IL-33, which activates ILC2s via ST2. ILCs 
up-regulate PD-L1 and interact with CD4 T cells on site to promote in-
creased GATA3 expression and thereby commit them to IL-13–producing 
Th2 cells. IL-13 released from both cell types then activates the epithelium 
to promote worm expulsion.

cell sorting
ILC2s were sorted by FACS from the lungs of day 5 N. 
brasiliensis–infected mice. ILC2s identified as lineage-neg-
ative, CD45+ST2+KLRG1+IL7Rα+Sca-1+ cells were either 
used directly in T cell co-cultures or subsequently expanded 
in cRPMI (RPMI 1640 [Gibco] supplemented with pen-
icillin/streptavidin [Gibco], l-glutamine [Gibco], and 10% 
fetal bovine serum [Gibco]) containing 10 ng/ml IL-2 (R&D 
Systems), 10 ng/ml IL-7 (R&D Systems), and 10 ng/ml 
IL-33 (R&D Systems) for 5 d.
For in vitro activation studies, lineage-negative cells 
were sorted by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). 
Cells were labeled with lineage-APC antibodies and anti–
APC-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) in MACS buffer (PBS, 
2 mM EDTA, and BSA [all Sigma-Aldrich]) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions and separated using an Au-
toMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were then cultured 
in the presence of cytokines for 7 d to generate >95% pure 
ILC2 cultures. T cells (>95% purity) were isolated from the 
spleens of naive mice using the mouse CD4 T cell isolation 
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For OT
-2 
co-cultures, T cells were isolated from Rag2+/−OT-2tg/+ mice, 
stained with CellTrace Violet (Molecular Probes) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol, and incubated with ILC2s and 
OVA protein (10 µg/ml) for 5 d.
Adoptive transfers
ILC2s were isolated from the lungs of N. brasiliensis– 
infected WT or PD-L1−/− mice and expanded in vitro as 
previously described (Neill et al., 2010). Purified splenic 
CD4+CD44− T cells were freshly isolated from naive do-
nors. Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− mice were injected intravenously 
with 8 × 105 CD4 T cells and 2 × 105 ILC2s 1 d before 
infection with N. brasiliensis.
tamoxifen treatment
Mice were injected three times i.p. with 75 mg/kg body 
weight tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in oil and 
rested for 1 wk after the final injection before they were in-
fected with N. brasiliensis.

the expression of transcription factors and cytokines 24 and 
96 h later, respectively.
Th differentiation was achieved through the culture of 
naive CD4 T cells in the presence of polarizing cytokines 
for 5 d as previously described. Plates were precoated with 5
