IMPORTANCE There is a large gap worldwide in the provision of evidence-based early
treatment of children with disruptive behavioral problems.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether an Internet-assisted intervention using whole-population
screening that targets the most symptomatic 4-year-old children is effective at 6 and 12
months after the start of treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 2-parallel-group randomized clinical trial was
performed from October 1, 2011, through November 30, 2013, at a primary health care clinic
in Southwest Finland. Data analysis was performed from August 6, 2015, to December 11,
2015. Of a screened population of 4656 children, 730 met the screening criteria indicating a
high level of disruptive behavioral problems. A total of 464 parents of 4-year-old children
were randomized into the Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) intervention group
(n = 232) or an education control (EC) group (n = 232).
INTERVENTIONS The SFSW intervention, an 11-session Internet-assisted parent training
program that included weekly telephone coaching.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child Behavior Checklist version for preschool children
(CBCL/1.5-5) externalizing scale (primary outcome), other CBCL/1.5-5 scales and subscores,
Parenting Scale, Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits, and the 21-item Depression,
Anxiety, and Stress Scale. All data were analyzed by intention to treat and per protocol. The
assessments were made before randomization and 6 and 12 months after randomization.
RESULTS Of the children randomized, 287 (61.9%) were male and 79 (17.1%) lived in other
than a family with 2 biological parents. At 12-month follow-up, improvement in the SFSW
intervention group was significantly greater compared with the control group on the
following measures: CBCL/1.5-5 externalizing scale (effect size, 0.34; P < .001), internalizing
scale (effect size, 0.35; P < .001), and total scores (effect size, 0.37; P < .001); 5 of 7
syndrome scales, including aggression (effect size, 0.36; P < .001), sleep (effect size, 0.24;
P = .002), withdrawal (effect size, 0.25; P = .005), anxiety (effect size, 0.26; P = .003), and
emotional problems (effect size, 0.31; P = .001); Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits
callousness scores (effect size, 0.19; P = .03); and self-reported parenting skills (effect size,
0.53; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The study reveals the effectiveness and feasibility of an
Internet-assisted parent training intervention offered for parents of preschool children with
disruptive behavioral problems screened from the whole population. The strategy of
population-based screening of children at an early age to offering parent training using digital
technology and telephone coaching is a promising public health strategy for providing early
intervention for a variety of child mental health problems.

P
opulation-basedcohortstudies1-12havefoundthatchild-
hood disruptive behavior disorders are developmen-
tal precursors to a wide range of negative outcomes, in-
cluding peer rejection, school failure, psychopathologic
conditions, substance abuse, suicidality, and criminality. Ap-
proximately half of the children who have been identified as
aggressive with externalizing behavior as preschoolers de-
velop persistent problems.13,14 Parent training is the most ef-
fective approach to the psychosocial treatment of disruptive
behavioral problems15-18 and one of the best-validated thera-
peutic techniques.19 In parent training interventions, parents
typically learn to identify, define, and observe problem be-
haviors in new ways and acquire strategies to prevent and
respond to oppositional behavior.19
Despite the significant child, parent, and societal conse-
quences of disruptive behavioral problems and the availabil-
ity of effective interventions, most parents do not receive
parent training interventions. Stigma, availability, cost of ser-
vices, and logistical barriers, such as child care, transporta-
tion time, work schedules, or discomfort with services pro-
vided in groups, prevent many parents from enrolling in or
completing parent training programs.20-26 An optimal inter-
vention for disruptive behavioral problems should reduce bar-
riers that limit use, target problems emerging during the pre-
school years, yield meaningful outcomes, and be affordable
enough to be disseminated and sustained. Internet-assisted
treatment affords many benefits over traditional means, such
as high fidelity, greater accessibility, convenience, and re-
duced cost to patients.27
This randomized clinical trial (RCT) reports 6- and 12-
month follow-up results of the population-based Strongest
Families Smart Website (SFSW) intervention with telephone
coaching compared with an education control (EC). The tar-
get population was children with a high level of childhood dis-
ruptive behavior disorders screened from the population of
4-year-olds attending annual child health clinic checkups. The
primary hypothesis was that the SFSW intervention would re-
duce child disruptive behavior disorder symptoms at 6 and 12
months after randomization compared with the EC. Further-
more, we expected that participants randomized to the inter-
vention group would exhibit improvement in self-reported
parenting skills and distress compared with those random-
ized to the control group.
Methods
Study Design
The study design was a 2-parallel-group RCT stratified by sex,
with 1:1 allocation comparing the SFSW intervention with an
EC. Consistent with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT) protocol, best-practice RCT guidelines were
followed.Thestudywasapprovedbytheresearchethicsboards
of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and IWK Health
Centre.28 All data were collected with voluntary written con-
sent obtained online with the SFSW application and deiden-
tified. The study protocol, which describes the study in more
detail, has been previously published29 and can be found in
Supplement 1. With a 30% attrition rate and 250 participants
in the SFSW intervention and EC groups, we could show me-
dium to small incremental effects of 0.30 to 0.35 standard
units.29
Screening and Inclusion Criteria
Childrenwithahighlevelofchildhooddisruptivebehaviordis-
order symptoms screened from the population of 4-year-olds
attending annual child health clinic checkups in the catch-
ment area located in Southwest Finland from October 1, 2011,
through November 30, 2013, were recruited. Data analysis was
performed from August 6, 2015, to December 11, 2015. Before
the beginning of school, practically all children visit clinics
where the child’s health is comprehensively assessed. Study
recruitment took place at the children'
s yearly health clinic
visit, typically within 1 month after their fourth birthday.30
Inclusion criteria for the RCT participants were as follows:
(1) the child was 4 years old; (2) at least 1 parent’s native lan-
guage was Finnish; (3) families resided in the participating mu-
nicipalities; (4) the child had behavioral problems for the last 6
monthsbeforescreening(scoreof≥5pointsontheconductprob-

Key Points
Question: Is an Internet-assisted intervention using
whole-population screening that targets the most symptomatic
4-year-old children effective at 6- and 12-month follow-ups?
Findings: The findings reveal effectiveness of a parent training
intervention that incorporates interactive web technology to
provide a personalized and sustainable intervention for the public
health system.
Meaning: The strategy of population-based screening of children
at an early age and offering Internet-assisted parent training that
uses telephone coaching could be a promising solution for
providing early prevention and intervention for childhood
disruptive behavior.

a diagnosis of autism, pervasive development disorder,
Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, or intellectual
disability.
Randomization
The randomization sequence was generated, stratified by sex,
with a 1:1 ratio of SFSW intervention vs EC, using a comput-
erized random permuted block sequence generator (Random
Allocation Software34) with concealed block sizes. Partici-
pants were informed via email of their assignment and given
a link to the relevant website. Participants were not restricted
from seeking other assistance. The participant flowchart
(CONSORT diagram) is presented in Figure 1.
Interventions
In the EC group, participants were given access to a website
that provided a brief introduction to positive parenting
strategiesanda45-minutecallfromacoachwhoprovidedposi-
tive parenting advice, in addition to the standard care pro-
vided by their physicians or obtained by parents.
Participants in the SFSW intervention group received an
Internet version of the Strongest Families telephone-based
program.35-37 In this evidence-based program, participants
develop skills to strengthen parent-child relationships, rein-
force positive behavior, reduce conflict, manage daily tran-
sitions, plan for difficult situations, and encourage prosocial
behavior (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). For the purposes of
this study, the Strongest Families program was translated
into Finnish, adapted to the Finnish cultural environment,
and transferred to an Internet format with strategies,
examples, and exercises appropriate for parents of 4-year-
old children.
Parents were encouraged to complete 11 weekly online
sessions(Figure2)andtosharetheprogram’scontentwiththeir
partner. Sessions included exercises, instructional videos, and
audio clips demonstrating the application of new skills. Inter-
actions within the website were personalized with the child’s
name, problems, strengths, and preferred activities.29 Each
week participants received an approximately 45-minute tele-
phone call from a coach. All coaches were licensed health care
professionals who received intensive training for the SWSF in-
tervention and study protocol by an experienced Strongest
Families trainer. Coaches reviewed the successful applica-
tion of new skills, responded to questions, and provided en-
couragement. The next session was introduced if the coach de-
termined that skill-related questions were mastered by
observing website use and information collected during the
telephone call. Children did not participate in coaching calls
or access the website. To our knowledge, no potential ad-
verse effects of parent training have been reported in the
literature.38 Approximately 7 and 10 months after randomiza-
tion, parents in the intervention group received booster coach-
ing sessions to review the learned skills.

Screening Measures
Parents’ demographic characteristics (native language, edu-
cational level, and family structure) were recorded. The con-
duct problems subscale of the SDQ was used to screen partici-
pants for the RCT.31 Parent ratings of preschoolers on the SDQ’s
conduct problems subscale have yielded an internal consis-
tency score of 0.58.39 The perceived difficulties were as-
sessed with a single question from the SDQ: “Overall, do you
think that your child has difficulties in 1 or more of the follow-
ing areas: emotions, behavior or being able to get on with other
people?” The alternatives were no, minor difficulties, defi-
nite difficulties, and severe difficulties. To be included in the
RCT, the child had to have a high level of symptoms and at least
minor perceived difficulties.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the 24-item externalizing
scaleoftheChildBehaviorChecklistversionforpreschoolchil-
dren (CBCL/1.5-5).40 The Cronbach α for the externalizing scale
among preschool children has been reported as 0.88.41,42

tionmeasures)andqualityassurancearedescribedintheeMea-
sures in Supplement 2. All measures were completed online
by the participants at baseline and at the 6- and 12-month
follow-ups.
Statistical Analysis
All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analy-
sis. Per-protocol analyses included participants with all time
point measurements completed. Categorical variables are pre-
sented as number (percentage) and continuous variables as
mean (SD). Pearson χ2 tests or Fisher exact tests were con-
ducted to explore differences in categorical variables at base-
line between the children and parents in the intervention and
control groups. Two-tailed, 2-sample t tests were used to ex-
plore differences in continuous variables between groups at
baseline.Outcomevariableswereanalyzedwithalinearmixed-
effect model for repeated measurements with time (baseline
and 6 and 12 months after treatment) as the within factor and
treatment (SFSW intervention or EC) and sex as the between
factors. Paired comparisons using linear contrasts were ap-
plied within the same model. The Bonferroni correction was
applied to P values from multiple comparisons. Compound
symmetry covariance structure was fitted to form the block-
diagonal matrix for the random subject effect in this mixed-
effect model. After examining the main treatment effect, we
investigated whether the possible treatment effect on the
outcome variables was modified by sex. For this purpose, a
treatment group × sex interaction effect was added to the sta-
tistical model. The interaction terms were deemed to be sta-
tistically significant based on P < .05, which was then used
for all statistical testing. In addition, the CBCL/1.5-5 external-
izing scale score at 12 months was dichotomized using the
80th percentile as a cutoff point and analyzed with logistic
regression analysis adjusting for sex. The Cohen d was calcu-
lated as a measure of effect size to complement the statistical
testing. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statis-
tical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 4656 children were referred from child health clin-
ics with a parent completed screening questionnaire. Of these,
292 parents (6.3%) declined to participate in the RCT. Of 4364
parents willing to participate in the RCT, 730 (16.7%) met the
screening inclusion criteria. Of those who met the screening
inclusioncriteria,186(25.5%)declinedtoparticipateintheRCT,

Self-reported parenting skills improved significantly when
compared with the EC group.
Unlike RCTs on referred populations or convenience
samples, the study design allows us to generalize about
the effectiveness of an early parent training intervention
for most symptomatic children screened from the general
population. These findings have global interest in planning
low-threshold early interventions and service planning for
children with disruptive behavioral problems. Individuals
who exhibit disruptive behavioral problems in early child-
hood are more likely to engage in life-course-persistent
antisocial behavior that continues through adolescence
into adulthood.6,10-12,51,52 The life-course-persistent pathway
from childhood disruptive behavioral problems to adult
criminality and violent behaviors may best be prevented
early in life, when behavioral patterns are more easily
modified.53 The findings suggest that population-based
screening followed by Internet-assisted parent training
reaches those at greatest risk who often do not obtain
services to receive early evidence-based preventive inter-
vention. Some of the effect sizes were modest compared
with some parenting program studies16,18,54 that targeted
clinical samples. This finding may reflect the targeted young
age group with more tendency of natural improvement in
behavioral problems. Furthermore, the sample was screened
from the general population, and the level of problems was

less severe than in clinical samples, meaning there was less
room for improvement.
The findings indicate the effectiveness of a parent train-
ing intervention that incorporates interactive web technol-
ogy to provide a personalized and sustainable intervention for
thepublichealthsystem.Internet-assistedparenttrainingcom-
bined with support from a professional telephone coach was
successful in achieving high participation rates, changing child
disruptive behavior, and strengthening parental skills. Fur-
thermore, parents reported high satisfaction with the pro-
gram. These findings align with a Canadian Strongest Fami-
lies parent training study35 with clinical samples using
handbooks, videos, and telephone coaching. A significant per-
centage of parents are interested in Internet-assisted or tele-
phone-supported parenting programs.26,55 However, to our
knowledge, only a limited number of Internet-based treat-
ments that target children’s psychiatric problems have been
evaluated. The Internet-based components can be easily up-
dated, the format is standardized and not therapist depen-
dent, and it is more easily accessible for participants. Combin-
ing technology with remote involvement of professionals may
assist in disseminating key elements of other evidence-based
interventions to populations who would not otherwise be able
to receive them.
The improvements in child problems were maintained un-
til 12-month follow-up. Inclusion of 2 booster sessions after
6-month follow-up possibly had an effect on further improve-
mentinparentingskills.Boostersessionsforchronicproblems,
such as disruptive behavior, are often seen as an essential part
of treatment but, to date, have received little study.56
Some methodologic constraints should be noted. First,
only parental report of child behavior was used in the analy-
ses. Direct observations of parenting, clinical observations, or
teacher ratings would be helpful to validate the reported
changes. However, the target group was 4-year-old children
in Finland, where children start school at 7 years of age. Sec-
ond, future studies need to determine whether the improve-
ment in the intervention group resulted from the Internet ses-
sions or the telephone calls (or the combination) or from the
length and intensity of the intervention. Third, assessment of
change in functional impairment was not conducted.
The study results are from Finland, a Nordic welfare state
with a universal health care system. The educational level of
Finnish parents in general is high compared with many other
countries. The effects of the program are over and above the
potential benefits associated with these factors. However, only
a few children with mental health needs are referred to
services.57 The control group clearly received more services
than most preschool children with behavioral problems. Chil-
dren were actively screened from the population, which is not
common practice. None of screened children were taking psy-
chotropic medication at baseline or during the study. In Fin-
land, use of psychotropic medication in early childhood is rare,
and child psychiatric medication practices for young children
are different from US practices.58-60
Conclusions
Because of increased demands of child mental health services,
long waiting lists, and the high cost of traditional approaches,
ourfindingshaveimportantpublichealthimplications.Despite
the high prevalence and significant associated burden, there is
an enormous gap worldwide in the provision of treatment for
mentaldisordersinchildren.Perhapsthemostchallengingbar-
rier to service provision is the great shortage of skilled human
resources to address child mental disorders in most regions of
theworld,evenincountrieswithpublichealthcare,suchasFin-
land. The study reveals the feasibility of a parent training inter-
vention offered to parents of high-risk children screened from
the population and referred to Internet-assisted parent train-
ing with telephone coaching. Given flexibility, anonymity, and
ease of access, remote interventions have important benefits
forreachingat-riskindividuals.Thestrategyofpopulation-based
screening of children at an early age and offering Internet-
assisted parent training that uses telephone coaching could be
a promising solution for providing early prevention and inter-
vention for a variety of child mental health problems.
