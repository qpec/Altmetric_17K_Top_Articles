Purpose:
To investigate the structural brain connectome in patients 
with Parkinson disease (PD) and mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) and in patients with PD without MCI.
Materials and 
Methods:
This prospective study was approved by the local ethics 
committees, and written informed consent was obtained 
from all subjects prior to enrollment. The individual struc-
tural brain connectome of 170 patients with PD (54 with 
MCI, 116 without MCI) and 41 healthy control subjects 
was obtained by using deterministic diffusion-tensor trac-
tography. A network-based statistic was used to assess 
structural connectivity differences among groups.
Results:
Patients with PD and MCI had global network alterations 
when compared with both control subjects and patients 
with PD without MCI (range, P = .004 to P = .048). Rel-
ative to control subjects, patients with PD and MCI had 
a large basal ganglia and frontoparietal network with 
decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right hemi-
sphere and a subnetwork with increased mean diffusivity 
(MD) involving similar regions bilaterally (P , .01). When 
compared with patients with PD without MCI, those with 
PD and MCI had a network with decreased FA, including 
basal ganglia and frontotemporoparietal regions bilater-
ally (P , .05). Similar findings were obtained by adjusting 
for motor disability (P , .05, permutation-corrected P = 
.06). At P , .01, patients with PD and MCI did not show 
network alterations relative to patients with PD without 
MCI. Network FA and MD values were used to differen-
tiate patients with PD and MCI from healthy control sub-
jects and patients with PD without MCI with fair to good 
accuracy (cross-validated area under the receiver operat-
ing characteristic curve [principal + secondary connected 
components] range, 0.75–0.85).
Conclusion:
A disruption of structural connections between brain areas 
forming a network contributes to determine an altered in-
formation integration and organization and thus cognitive 
deficits in patients with PD. These results provide novel 
information concerning the structural substrates of MCI 
in patients with PD and may offer markers that can be 
used to differentiate between patients with PD and MCI 
and patients with PD without MCI.

a powerful framework with which to 
measure the functional and structural 
brain organization (11). Brain networks 
have been described as graphs in which 
anatomic brain regions are defined as 
nodes linked by edges (ie, functional 
or structural connections) (11). These 
techniques can enable one to make a 
detailed description on how the disease 
alters brain organization (12) and, 
more recently, they have allowed re-
searchers to make hypotheses about 
underlying physiopathology, possibly 
leading to identification of prognostic 
markers (13). Only two studies so far 
have investigated brain networks using 
graph analysis applied on resting-state 
functional MR imaging data in patients 
with PD (14,15), suggesting decreased 
global and nodal functional efficiency 
relative to those in healthy control sub-
jects. One study indicated that the to-
pologic properties of brain functional 
networks are severely impaired in pa-
tients with PD and MCI (14). To our 
knowledge, there have been no studies 
to address whole-brain structural net-
work alterations in patients with PD 
and MCI by using graph analysis.
of dopaminergic and nondopaminer-
gic neurotransmitter systems, limbic 
and neocortical Lewy body disease, 
and Alzheimer disease–related chang-
es are considered the main molecular 
and pathologic substrates of cognitive 
impairment in patients with PD (4). 
More recently, accumulating pieces of 
evidence from neuroimaging studies 
suggest an abnormal network archi-
tecture involving several cortical and 
subcortical systems in patients with PD 
and cognitive decline. To date, only a 
few studies have assessed the pattern 
of microstructural alterations of brain 
white matter (WM) connections in 
patients with PD and MCI, and these 
studies have suggested that cognitive 
deficits are associated with abnormal-
ities of frontal and interhemispheric 
WM connections (5–8). More impor-
tantly, several studies showed that WM 
abnormalities, as revealed by diffusion-
tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging, may precede gray matter at-
rophy in patients with PD but without 
dementia (5,6). Furthermore, evidence 
of functional connectivity alterations 
in brain cognitive networks in patients 
with PD and MCI is emerging. By using 
resting-state functional MR imaging, re-
searchers have observed a reduced con-
nectivity between the dorsal attention 
network and right frontoinsular regions 
(9) and a functional disconnection of 
the frontoparietal network (10) in these 
patients.
Conceptualization of the human 
brain as an integrated network (ie, 
the connectome) has become increas-
ingly prevalent, and neuroimaging re-
search is now focusing on the study 
of integrated models of brain function 
and structure rather than on individ-
ual brain areas (11). Graph theoretical 
analyses and network sciences form

Advances in Knowledge
 
n The study of the structural brain 
connectome showed that patients 
with Parkinson disease (PD) and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
had a large basal ganglia and 
frontoparietal network, with 
decreased fractional anisotropy 
(FA) in the right hemisphere and 
a subnetwork with an increased 
mean diffusivity (MD) bilaterally 
(P , .01) relative to control 
subjects.
 
n When compared with patients 
with PD without MCI, those with 
PD and MCI had a network with 
decreased FA, including basal 
ganglia and frontotemporopari-
etal regions bilaterally (P , .05), 
and similar findings were 
obtained by adjusting for motor 
disability (P , .05, permutation-
corrected P = .06).
 
n Patients with PD without MCI did 
not show regional network alter-
ations relative to healthy control 
subjects (P , .01, P , .05).
 
n Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis with leave-
one-out cross validation showed 
that network FA and MD values 
enabled differentiation of 
patients with PD and MCI from 
healthy control subjects and from 
patients with PD without MCI 
with fair to good accuracy (cross-
validated area under the ROC 
principal + secondary connected 
components range, 0.75–0.85).
Implication for Patient Care
 
n This study provides information 
concerning the structural sub-
strates of MCI in patients with 
PD and may offer markers to 
differentiate patients with PD 
and MCI from those with PD but 
no impairment.
P
arkinson disease (PD) is a neu-
rodegenerative disorder charac-
terized by a progressive decline 
in both motor function and cognitive 
function (1). Mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) can be identified in ap-
proximately 25% of patients with a 
new diagnosis of PD (2), and patients 
with MCI progress to dementia more 
frequently than do those with normal 
cognitive performance (3).
The neural substrates of cognitive 
decline in patients with PD are not 
yet fully elucidated (4). Dysfunction

Network analysis.—Global topo-
logic network properties were obtained 
for each group by using the Brain Con-
nectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.
com/site/bctnet/). The following global 
network metrics were explored: small-
worldness (20) and mean network de-
gree, clustering coefficient, characteris-
tic path length, betweenness centrality, 
assortativity, global efficiency, and net-
work density (number of existing con-
nections divided by the number of pos-
sible connections). A Wilcoxon rank 
sum test was used to compare these 
metrics between groups. The results of 
such tests were identical for fractional 
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity 
(MD) matrices for degree, character-
istic path length, and density, as such 
network metrics only account for the 
presence or absence of a connection.
The network-based statistic (21) 
was used to identify brain network dif-
ferences between groups. The analysis 
was performed on network FA and MD 
data to account for the structural orga-
nization of the tracts in terms of both 
directionality and presence of barriers 
to water diffusion. Network-based sta-
tistics were used to compare FA and 
MD network data between groups at 
two levels of significance (P , .01, P 
, .05) (Appendix E1 [online]). The 
between-patient group comparison was 
repeated, including the Unified Parkin-
son Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III 
score as a nuisance variable (to adjust 
for disease severity). We also checked 
for differences in global number of 
streamlines, FA, and MD across groups 
by using the t test. Average FA and MD 
of the principal and smaller connected 
components were computed for each 
contrast and were entered into a re-
ceiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis with leave-one-out cross 
validation to quantify the ability of the 
components to enable discrimination 
between groups (M.C., 8 years of expe-
rience in biostatistics).
Results
Fifty-four (32%) patients with PD were 
classified as having PD with MCI, while 
the remaining 116 (68%) patients with 
(V.S.K., T.S., I.S., V.S) and neuropsy-
chologic assessment (E.S., 25 years of 
experience in neuropsychology). Ap-
pendix E1 (online) contains full details 
on clinical and cognitive evaluations.
MR Imaging Study
MR images were obtained with the 1.5-
T Philips Achieva system (Philips Med-
ical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). 
Dual-echo fast spin-echo, three-dimen-
sional T1-weighted transient field echo, 
and pulsed gradient spin-echo single-
shot echo-planar DT MR imaging se-
quences were performed. See Appen-
dix E1 (online) for complete sequence 
parameters.
The complete MR image analysis 
procedure is described in Appendix 
E1 (online). Analyses were performed 
by two observers (S.G., S.B.; 8 and 2 
years of experience in neuroimaging, 
respectively). Briefly, T1-weighted im-
ages were processed by using the Free-
surfer suite (version 5.3; http://surfer.
nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), resulting in 
an 83-area atlas, which was used to 
define the brain nodes for the network 
analysis (Table E1 [online]). The pre-
processing of DT MR imaging data was 
performed with FSL software (http://
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). 
Determin-
istic DT tractography was perfomed 
with the Diffusion Toolkit and Trackvis 
(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/track-
vis) by using the Fiber Assignment by 
Continuous Tracking (or FACT) algo-
rithm (18). Tract-based spatial statis-
tics software (version 1.2; http://fsl.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS) 
was 
used to perform multisubject voxel-
wise DT MR imaging analysis, as de-
scribed previously (5).
Network 
construction.—A brain 
network can be described as a graph, 
where the nodes are brain regions and 
the edges represent their connections. 
Here, the nodes were the 83 gray mat-
ter areas segmented with Freesurfer 
software, and the edges were repre-
sented by the WM tracts obtained by 
using the Diffusion Toolkit linking each 
pair of nodes (Table E1 [online]). An 
individual brain network was obtained 
for each subject included in the study 
(19) (Appendix E1 [online]).
The main aim of this study was to 
explore WM microstructural alterations 
and brain network abnormalities re-
lated to cognition in a large population 
of patients with PD without dementia 
by using DT MR imaging–based struc-
tural connectomics.
Materials and Methods
This prospective study was approved by 
the local ethics committee on human 
studies, and written informed consent 
was obtained from all subjects (or their 
legal guardians) prior to enrollment. 
Study participants were consecutively 
recruited from January 2011 to Octo-
ber 2013.
Subjects
A total of 170 patients with idiopathic 
PD but not dementia (16) and 41 
matched healthy control subjects were 
enrolled at the Clinic of Neurology, 
Faculty of Medicine, University of Bel-
grade. The diagnosis of PD was made 
by trained observers (V.S.K., T.S., I.S., 
V.S.; 35, 8, 5, and 8 years of experi-
ence in clinical neurology, respectively) 
in accordance with international cri-
teria (16). Patients were excluded if 
they had parkin, leucine-rich repeat 
kinase 2, and glucocerebrosidase gene 
mutations; moderate-to-severe limb or 
head rest tremor; depression accord-
ing to the structured clinical interview 
for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, 4th edition axis 
I disorders; dementia according to the 
Movement Disorder Society diagnostic 
criteria for PD with dementia (17); ce-
rebrovascular disorders or intracranial 
masses; a history of traumatic brain 
injury; or any other major neurologic 
or medical condition. Eleven patients 
were excluded because of progress to 
dementia, and four patients were ex-
cluded due to both dementia and ce-
rebrovascular disease. Healthy control 
subjects with no history of neurologic, 
psychiatric, or other major medical ill-
nesses were recruited among friends 
and spouses of patients and by word of 
mouth. All subjects underwent a com-
prehensive evaluation, including neu-
rologic history taking and examination

NEURORADIOLOGY: Structural Brain Connectome and Cognitive Impairment 
Galantucci et al
This figure displays both the principal 
connected component (ie, the largest 
subnetwork of affected connectivity) 
and the smaller subnetworks with al-
tered FA or MD values. All the P values 
obtained from the network analysis and 
reported here are permutation-correct-
ed P values.
When compared with control sub-
jects, patients with PD without MCI 
showed a decreased global number of 
streamlines (P = .03), while no global 
FA (P = .27) or MD (P = .43) alter-
ations or regional structural brain net-
work abnormalities were found. In 
addition, there was no network impair-
ment when the 54 patients with PD 
without MCI who were matched with 
patients with PD and MCI were com-
pared with healthy subjects (at P , .05, 
corrected P = .35 for FA connections 
and corrected P = .45 for MD connec-
tions; at P , .01, corrected P = .77 for 
FA networks and corrected P = .58 for 
MD networks).

(P = .02 for FA matrices). Degree (P = 
 
.02), clustering coefficient (P = .02 for 
FA matrices, P = .002 for MD matri-
ces), density (P = .02), and global effi-
ciency (P , .001 for FA matrices) were 
decreased. When compared with pa-
tients with PD without MCI, patients 
with PD and MCI showed increased 
assortativity (P = .005 for FA matrices, 
P = .03 for MD matrices) and reduced 
clustering coefficient (P = .05 for FA 
matrices, P = .02 for MD matrices) 
and global efficiency (P = .01 for FA 
matrices). There were no significant 
differences in small worldness among 
the different groups.
Structural Brain Networks: Network-
based Statistic
Between-group comparisons.—The net-
works of affected structural connectiv-
ity in patients with PD and MCI relative 
to control subjects and patients with 
PD without MCI are shown in Figure 1. 
PD were found to be without cognitive 
impairment. A subgroup of 54 patients 
with PD without MCI was matched with 
a group of patients with PD with MCI 
according to demographic features and 
was selected to perform the between-
patient group comparison, holding the 
same statistical power of the PD MCI 
group (Table 1, Table E2 [online]).
Structural Brain Networks: Global 
Network Properties
The results of the analysis of global 
topologic network properties are re-
ported in Table 2. When compared 
with control subjects, patients with 
PD without MCI showed increased 
betweenness centrality in the FA ma-
trices (P = .05) and decreased as-
sortativity in the MD matrices (P = 
 
.03). When compared with control 
subjects, patients with PD and MCI 
showed increased betweenness cen-
trality (P = .03 for FA matrices, P = 
.01 for MD matrices), characteristic

Figure 1
Figure 1: Affected structural connections in patients with PD and MCI relative to healthy control subjects and patients with PD without MCI (network-
based statistic). The principal connected component is shown in red, and the other affected connections not included in the principal connected compo-
nent are shown in green. Table E1 (online) reports the names of each brain node with the corresponding number. (a) Subnetworks show altered 
structural connectivity (decreased FA or increased MD) in patients with PD and MCI relative to healthy control subjects at P , .01 (Fig 1 continues). 
When compared with control sub-
jects, patients with PD and MCI showed 
a decreased global number of stream-
lines (P = .048) and FA (P = .005) and 
an increased global MD (P = .004). The 
network analysis of patients with PD 
and MCI versus control subjects at P , 
.01 (Fig 1a) showed a basal ganglia and 
frontoparietal network (or principal 
connected component) with decreased 
FA that included the following regions 
in the right hemisphere: putamen, thal-
amus, frontal pole, rostral middle fron-
tal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus-pars 
orbitalis, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, 
insula, and inferior parietal gyrus (P , 
.001). Smaller secondary networks with 
reduced FA were found in the left hemi-
sphere connecting the thalamus, tem-
poral pole, and fusiform gyrus (P = .04) 
(Fig 1a). Right middle temporal and su-
perior parietal gyri (P = .02), as well as 
the right paracentral gyrus and brain-
stem, were also part of these smaller 
networks (P = .02). Relative to control 
subjects, patients with PD and MCI had 
a large subnetwork with increased MD 
that included the following regions: the 
pallidum bilaterally; the right caudate, 
putamen, thalamus, orbital and lateral 
regions of the frontal lobe; and the su-
perior temporal lobe (P , .001) (Fig 
1a). Patients with PD and MCI also had 
numerous smaller subnetworks with 
increased MD compared with control 
subjects, involving the left basal ganglia 
and precentral gyrus, insula, and sev-
eral regions of the temporal, parietal, 
and occipital lobes bilaterally (P , .001 
to P , .01) (Fig 1a).
When P , .05 was adopted (see 
Network Analysis section and Appendix 
E1 [online] for further details), patients 
with PD and MCI had more extensive 
altered principal networks with de-
creased FA or increased MD relative to 
control subjects (Fig 1b). The impaired 
FA subnetwork included connections 
linking the bilateral caudate and thala-
mus, left globus pallidus, right fronto-
temporoparietal regions, and left tem-
poroparietooccipital regions (P = .01) 
(Fig 1b). The network with increased 
MD expanded even more and included 
the majority of the connections of both 
hemispheres (P = .002) (Fig 1b).
At the global level, patients with 
PD and MCI showed reduced FA (P = 
.03) and increased MD (P = .02) with-
out number of streamlines (P = .34) 
changes compared with matched pa-
tients with PD without MCI (P = .03). 
The network analysis at P , .01 showed 
no difference between patients with PD 
and MCI and matched patients with 
PD without MCI (P = .20 for FA con-
nections, P = .17 for MD connections). 
When patients with PD and MCI were 
compared with matched patients with 
PD without MCI at P , .05 (Fig 1c), a 
principal network of affected FA con-
nections was found, including the left

We did not find affected MD connec-

at a less significant threshold (P , .05,

ROC curve analysis.—Table 3 shows 
results of the ROC curve analysis with

FA and MD values of the (combined) 
principal and secondary components 
enabled us to differentiate patients with 
PD and MCI from healthy control sub-
jects with fair to good accuracy (cross-
validated area under the ROC curve 
[AUC] range, 0.75–0.85). Network FA 
demonstrated good AUC values in dis-
tinguishing patients with PD and MCI 
from those with PD without MCI (prin-
cipal component + secondary compo-
nents = 0.81).

was found in bilateral frontal, parie-
tal, and temporal WM, involving the 
genu and anterior part of the corpus 
callosum and associative frontoparietal 
tracts, with a slight prevalence on the 
right side (Fig 2). The pattern of MD 
increase was similar with additional in-
volvement of the midbrain and pontine 
WM. An MD increase that was less ex-
tensive but had a similar spatial pattern 
was found when matched patients with 
PD without MCI were compared with 
control subjects. The FA reduction in 
this last comparison was confined to 
part of the right superior frontoparietal 
associative tracts. There was no signif-
icant difference when patients with PD 
and MCI were compared with matched 
patients with PD without MCI.
Discussion
This study evaluated the structural DT 
MR imaging connectome correlates of 
MCI in a large sample of patients with 
PD but without dementia. The main 
finding of our study was that PD with 
MCI is associated with a structural 
network disruption involving basal 
ganglia and the frontotemporoparietal 
region. This finding agrees with the 
clinical and cognitive aspects of the 
disease characterized by motor, exec-
utive, and visuospatial deficits. Despite 
the fact that both patients with PD 
and MCI and patients with PD without 
MCI showed microstructural damage 
measured by using tract-based spatial 
statistics, only patients with PD and 
MCI had significant alterations at the 
network level when compared with 
control subjects and patients with PD 
without MCI. When looking at global 
topologic network features, patients 
with PD and MCI had severe alterations 
when compared with control subjects, 
while patients with PD without MCI 
showed very few abnormalities. These 
results suggest that cognitive impair-
ment in patients with PD is likely the 
consequence of a disruption of complex 
structural brain networks rather than 
degeneration of individual WM bun-
dles. Such network alterations enabled 
us to distinguish patients with PD and 
MCI from control subjects and patients 
with PD without MCI with a high level 
of accuracy.
A few previous studies have ex-
plored the pattern of DT MR imaging 
alterations in patients with PD and MCI 
with voxelwise or tractography-based 
approaches (5–7). The pattern of DT 
MR imaging changes in patients with 
PD and MCI was similar to the pattern 
we described in our sample using tract-
based spatial statistics. In addition, we 
found a somewhat similar pattern of MD 
increase in patients with PD without 
MCI relative to control subjects, while 
the significant FA decrease was much 
less distributed and mostly confined to 
part of the right superior frontoparietal 
associative tracts. Previous results agree 
with this finding and showed that alter-
ations of DT MR imaging metrics can 
be found throughout the brain at the 
earliest stages of PD, even before the 
occurrence of cognitive deficits (22,23). 
Reduced FA values in patients with PD 
compared with control subjects have 
been described in the frontal lobes, 
without corresponding gray matter vol-
ume loss (24), involving the WM adja-
cent to the supplemental motor areas, 
prefrontal areas, and anterior cingulate 
gyrus (24). DT MR imaging changes in 
patients with PD also have been found in 
the genu of the corpus callosum and su-
perior longitudinal fasciculus (25). More 
recently, DT MR imaging abnormalities 
were detected in the nigrostriatal fibers 
(26). The analysis of structural connec-
tome that we performed deepened the 
findings of voxelwise analyses (includ-
ing the one performed in our sample). 
Whereas voxelwise approaches detect 
diffusion changes at the voxel level, the 
structural connectome analysis con-
siders the relationships between de-
generating connections and is able to 
provide pieces of information on sets of 
connections that are likely degenerating 
simultaneously (12). On the basis of our 
results and those in the literature, we 
hypothesize that WM microstructural 
alterations are not sufficient to cause 
cognitive impairment; rather, a severe 
disruption of structural connections be-
tween brain areas forming a network is 
required to determine altered informa-
tion integration and organization and 
thus cognitive deficits.
We are aware that the overall se-
verity of the disease may have con-
tributed to the network disruption 
independently of the cognitive status. 
Even if we are not able to completely 
exclude the influence of disease sever-
ity, it is worth noting that the pattern of

differences was confirmed when adjust-
ing for UPDRS III score. Moreover, we 
found no network abnormalities, even 
when we compared all patients with PD 
without MCI to control subjects, thus 
decreasing the effect size required to 
meet statistical significance.
The association between brain net-
work modifications and cognitive im-
pairment in patients with PD and MCI 
has been described previously in a func-
tional connectome study (14). Altered 
global network parameters of cluster-
ing, modularity, and small-worldness 
correlated with deficits in visuospatial 
and visuoperceptual abilities, as well as 
memory functions in patients with PD 
and MCI (14). The involvement of the 
frontoparietal and frontoinsular net-
works and their functional disconnection 
as the substrate of MCI in patients with 
PD have also been suggested by other 
resting-state functional MR imaging 
studies using independent component 
analysis (9,10). The network alterations 
we found in our study are possibly the 
structural correlates of functional con-
nectivity derangement observed in pre-
vious populations with PD and MCI 
(9,10,14).
This study was not without limi-
tations. The first limitation, which is 
common to all DT MR imaging stud-
ies reflecting the limitations of the DT 
model, was the presence of crossing 
fibers, which can cause uncertainty 
in the estimation of the tensor model. 
Thus, potential errors in tract recon-
struction with DT tractography may 
have occurred in regions where such 
fiber disposition is more frequent. 
Second, the reference standard for 
the regional parcellation of brain MR 
imaging has not yet been established. 
Thus, the choice of network nodes 
 524

Galantucci et al
was somewhat arbitrary across stud-
ies and was based on either anatomic 
templates or data-driven parcellations 
(27). We were aware that the Free-
surfer method does not take into ac-
count the cytoarchitectonic differences 
that can be present in different parts 
of the same parcellated area. However, 
even considering such a limitation, 
this segmentation enables a reliable 
definition of anatomic regions using a 
robust and automated method and has 
already been used in previous connec-
tome studies (19). Third, motor defi-
cits were more severe; consequently, 
levodopa equivalent doses were higher 
in patients with PD and MCI than in 
patients with PD without MCI, even 
when a demographically matched sam-
ple was selected. It should be noted 
that the presence of MCI in patients 
with PD is inherently related to more 
severe motor deficits (1). Thus, select-
ing a population of patients with PD 
without MCI matched for motor per-
formance with patients with PD with 
MCI was not possible, despite the fact 
that we recruited a large cohort of pa-
tients with PD. However, it is worth 
noting that when we repeated the 
analysis adjusting for UPDRS III, the 
pattern of differences between patients 
with PD and MCI and patients with PD 
without MCI did not change. We chose 
not to control the analysis additionally 
for levodopa equivalent doses because 
we expected it to be highly correlated 
to UPDRS III, as demonstrated in our 
sample (UPDRS III vs levodopa equiva-
lent doses: Spearman correlation coef-
ficient = 0.71, P , .001).
In conclusion, our results suggest 
that whole-brain connectome analysis 
with DT MR imaging may be a useful 
tool with which to explore the struc-
tural abnormalities related to a cog-
nitive decline in PD. This study indi-
cates that MCI in patients with PD 
is associated with decreased FA and 
increased MD in structural networks 
connecting 
frontotemporoparietal 
areas and basal ganglia. On the con-
trary, PD without MCI is associated 
with frontoparietal WM microstruc-
tural alterations but not structural net-
work disruption. The distribution and 
pattern of the structural connectome 
alterations we found suggest that such 
an approach might enable identifica-
tion of novel markers of PD-related 
cognitive impairment. This could be 
particularly valuable if, in the future, 
novel disease-modifying drugs specific 
to those patients at high risk of devel-
oping cognitive impairment are devel-
oped. Moreover, the improvement of 
our ability to predict cognitive impair-
ment would also be helpful to improve 
a patient’s awareness about cognitive 
impairment and dementia. Future lon-
gitudinal studies are warranted to con-
firm these findings and to describe the 
progression of structural network ab-
normalities over time in this condition 
and how they correlate with or can be 
used to predict functional network ab-
normalities and clinical outcome.
