SUMMARY
Pro-carcinogenic bacteria have the potential to
initiate and/or promote colon cancer, in part via
immune mechanisms that are incompletely under-
stood.
Using
ApcMin
mice
colonized
with
the
human pathobiont enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fra-
gilis (ETBF) as a model of microbe-induced colon
tumorigenesis, we show that the Bacteroides fragi-
lis toxin (BFT) triggers a pro-carcinogenic, multi-
step
inflammatory
cascade
requiring
IL-17R,
NF-kB, and Stat3 signaling in colonic epithelial cells
(CECs). Although necessary, Stat3 activation in
CECs
is
not
sufficient
to
trigger
ETBF
colon
tumorigenesis.
Notably,
IL-17-dependent
NF-kB
activation in CECs induces a proximal to distal
mucosal gradient of C-X-C chemokines, including
CXCL1, that mediates the recruitment of CXCR2-ex-
pressing
polymorphonuclear
immature
myeloid
cells with parallel onset of ETBF-mediated distal
colon tumorigenesis. Thus, BFT induces a pro-
carcinogenic signaling relay from the CEC to a
mucosal Th17 response that results in selective
NF-kB activation in distal colon CECs, which collec-
tively triggers myeloid-cell-dependent distal colon
tumorigenesis.
INTRODUCTION
A microbial etiology of human colorectal cancer (hCRC) has
long been proposed and sought (Sears and Garrett, 2014). Es-
tablishing how one or more members of the microbiota initiate
and/or promote hCRC could stimulate the development of
novel prevention approaches, particularly since hCRC has a
long lead time from initiation until presentation and since at
least a subset of putative hCRC microbial drivers are acquired
early in life. It has been further proposed that various gut mi-
crobes may drive a common pathway to tumorigenesis (Sears
and Garrett, 2014). More than 90% of hCRC is sporadic, with a
small proportion resulting from inherited mutations. Germline
mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor
suppressor gene are responsible for Familial Adenomatous
Polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disease with a 100%
lifetime risk of developing CRC (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996).
Further, at least 80% of sporadic hCRC also displays APC mu-
tations. Thus, ApcMin mice that are Apc heterozygous (Apc+/�)

 serve as a particularly useful model for hCRC. We have used
ApcMin mice colonized with enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis
(ETBF) as a model of de novo microbial-induced colon tumori-
genesis, demonstrating that endogenous IL-17 production is
tumorigenic and that robust Stat3 activation in immune cells
(ICs) and CECs parallels IL-17-dependent colon tumorigenesis
(Wick et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2009). Since ETBF colonization is
statistically significantly associated with CRC, being detected
in �90% of CRC patients and only �50% of healthy individuals
(Boleij et al., 2015), understanding BFT-mediated epithelial
signaling and ETBF oncogenesis is proposed as highly relevant
to the pathogenesis of human CRC. The key ETBF virulence
factor is Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT), a zinc-dependent met-
alloprotease that targets, via g-secretase-dependent signal
transduction, epithelial tight junctions through binding to an
as-yet-unidentified CEC receptor (Wu et al., 2007; Wu et al.,
2006). The epithelial response to BFT binding induces CEC
E-cadherin cleavage, resulting in enhanced barrier perme-
ability, Wnt/bcatenin, and NF-kB signaling in CECs (Wu et al.,
1998, 2003, 2004). Similarly, in ETBF-colonized mice, BFT is
required for colitis (Rhee et al., 2009). The overt Stat3 activa-
tion observed in colons after ETBF colonization is not directly
BFT-dependent, since in vitro, purified BFT does not induce
Stat3 activation in bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-
DC) or in HT29 human colon carcinoma cells (Rhee et al.,
2009; Wick et al., 2014). Consistent with this idea, Stat3
activation in ETBF-colonized C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice
occurs first in colonic lamina propria (LP) IC before the detec-
tion of a significant increase in colon permeability and CEC
Stat3 activation (Wick et al., 2014). Further, initial ETBF-
induced Stat3 activation in IC is independent of CEC Stat3
signaling as confirmed in C57BL/6-Stat3DIEC mice that lack
functional CEC Stat3. Together these results suggest a
model by which BFT initiates early, rapid release of epithelial
cell mediators that activate Stat3 in a subset of ICs that,
in turn, induce IL-17 production and subsequent Stat3 activa-
tion in the CEC compartment (Thiele Orberg et al., 2017). How-
ever, although similar Stat3 activation occurs from proximal to
distal ends of the colon (Wick et al., 2014), ETBF tumorigenesis
concentrates in the distal colon. These results suggest that
overt CEC Stat3 signaling, alone, does not account for distal
colon ETBF tumorigenesis but rather that other epithelial
signals collude in distal CECs to promote ETBF tumorigenesis.
Most recently, we presented evidence that CEC Apc heterozy-
gosity is essential to the accumulation and activation of
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) upon ETBF coloni-
zation; this again highlights that additional intrinsic epithelial
signals yet to be defined translate the combined action
of BFT and IL-17 on CECs to yield a polarized pro-tumoral
myeloid
environment
in
the
distal
colon
(Thiele
Orberg
et al., 2017).
Herein, we establish that BFT is the required initiator of a
CEC-driven cascade resulting in ETBF-induced distal colon
tumorigenesis. Namely, the coordinate action of BFT and IL-
17 on ApcMin CECs combines with downstream CEC NF-kB
activation to stimulate CEC release of CXC chemokines that
promote
LP accumulation
of CXCR2+ polymorphonuclear
immature myeloid cells (PMN-IMC). Together these elements
are required for ETBF-induced distal colon tumorigenesis.
Notably, ETBF, through BFT, induces comparable IL-17 and
Stat3 activation along the length of the colon but enhances
distal colon CEC NF-kB activation. Thus, distal CEC NF-kB
activation is a strategic coordinator for the pro-tumoral contri-
butions of the BFT, IL-17, and Stat3. Further, Stat3 activation
in ICs and CECs occurs upon ETBF colonization independently
of both IL-17R signaling and IL-6 production, two factors
commonly invoked as critical in other colon tumorigenesis
models (Grivennikov et al., 2009, 2012; Wang et al., 2009).
Our data emphasize that BFT action on CECs colludes with
three major mucosal pro-inflammatory signaling pathways—
NFkB, Stat3, and IL-17R—all strictly required for ETBF tumori-
genesis in Min mice and all closely associated with CRC in
humans (De Simone et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014; Wu et al.,
2009). Our findings support the potential utility of identifying
pharmacological agents, such as CXCR2 inhibitors, to repro-
gram the immune microenvironment and disrupt downstream
stages of bacterial-induced carcinogenesis while preserving
microbiota
and
beneficial
IL-17-dependent
anti-microbial
mechanisms (Chen et al., 2016; Conti et al., 2016; Kumar
et al., 2016).
RESULTS
BFT and Epithelial-Expressed IL-17R Are Required for
ETBF-Triggered Tumorigenesis
We first colonized ApcMin mice with an ETBF strain possessing
an in-frame chromosomal deletion of bft (ETBF[Dbft]) to test
the contribution of BFT to ETBF tumorigenesis. Whereas ApcMin
mice colonized with the parental ETBF strain developed an
average 18.5 ± 5.2 colon tumors 3 months after colonization,
tumor numbers were indistinguishable between sham and
ETBF(Dbft)-colonized ApcMin mice (1.8 ± 0.5 versus 1.7 ± 0.8)
(Figure 1A), indicating that BFT is required for ETBF tumorigen-
esis. ETBF tumors are commonly adenomas leading to bowel
obstruction and murine death in 3 months or less after ETBF
colonization prior to carcinomatous transformation. Next, we
sought to better understand the role of IL-17 in promoting colon
tumorigenesis during ETBF colonization of ApcMin mice (Wu
et al., 2009). Il17a�/� and Il17ra�/� ApcMin mice were significantly
resistant to ETBF-mediated tumorigenesis (5.2 ± 1.3 and 3.8 ±
0.8 colon tumors, respectively, versus 15.8 ± 2.7 in parental
ApcMin mice, p < 0.0001; Figure 1B). Thus, we confirmed previ-
ous in vivo antibody-blockade studies showing that IL-17 is a
key pro-inflammatory mediator promoting tumor formation in
ETBF-colonized ApcMin mice (Wu et al., 2009). IL-17R can
mediate its carcinogenic effect either directly on IL-17R+ CEC
or by acting on other target IL-17R+ cell types, such as tumor-
associated fibroblasts (TAF), macrophages (TAM), or MDSC,
with production of mediators that, in turn, promote epithelial
tumor growth (Iwakura et al., 2011). Therefore, to determine
whether IL-17 acted on mucosal leukocytes or CECs to yield
ETBF tumorigenesis, we generated bone-marrow (BM) chimera
ApcMin mice using lethally irradiated parental ApcMin mice recon-
stituted with Il17ra�/� BM ([Il17ra�/�> ApcMin]) and, conversely,
Il17ra�/� ApcMin mice reconstituted with WT C57BL/6 (WT)
BM ([WT > Il17ra�/�/ApcMin]). ApcMin mice reconstituted with
WT BM [WT > ApcMin] served as a positive control cohort to eval-
uate tumorigenesis 3 months after ETBF colonization. We found
204
Cell Host & Microbe 23, 203–214, February 14, 2018
 that [Il17ra�/� > ApcMin] and [WT > ApcMin] mice yielded similar
tumor numbers (16.5 ± 3.7 versus 16.7 ± 3.5; p = 0.98) (Fig-
ure 1C), whereas the absence of non-hematopoietic IL-17R in
the recipient ApcMin mice ([WT > Il17ra�/�-ApcMin]) nearly
ablated ETBF tumorigenesis (0.6 ± 0.4 versus 22.9 ± 3.6 in
[WT > ApcMin], p = 0.0003) (Figure 1D). We recently published
that IL-17 produced by Th17 and gdT17 is responsible for
ETBF-driven colon tumorigenesis (Housseau et al., 2016).
Thus, together, these results suggest that ETBF-induced
T-cell-derived
IL-17 mediates
its tumor-promoting
effects
mainly via its activity on IL-17R-expressing non-hematopoietic-
derived cells. To further define IL-17R expression in our
murine model, we examined the tissue distribution of IL-17R
by
immunofluorescence
(IF)
using
formalin-fixed
paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) colon tissue sections obtained from ETBF-
colonized ApcMin mice. Figure 1E shows that expression of
IL-17R was dominant in CECs. Notably, tumorigenic CECs
present in microadenomas retained high-level IL-17R expres-
sion. Building on our prior data indicating that only the CEC
Apc mutation is required to initiate ETBF colon tumorigenesis
(Thiele Orberg et al., 2017), we next focused on analyzing
IL-17-mediated signaling in the epithelial compartment to
better understand the BFT/IL-17 cooperation in triggering colon
tumorigenesis.
Higher IL-17-Dependent NF-kB Activation in Distal
Colon CECs Parallels the Regional Distribution of ETBF-
Induced Tumors
The mechanism(s) driving the marked distal localization for colon
tumorigenesis is unknown. Thus, to understand the CEC-associ-
ated molecular mechanisms involved in IL-17-dependent ETBF
distal colon tumorigenesis, we first compared the expression
of inflammation-related (Ir) genes in CECs isolated from ETBF-
colonized WT versus Il17�/� C57BL/6 mice. Colons were divided
into six juxtaposed sections from distal (C1) to proximal end (C6)
(Figure 2A). CD45-EpCAM+ CECs were cell sorted from the distal
C1+C2 colon sections (DC1-2) of 7-day-colonized WT mice
instead of ApcMin mice in order to exclude interference by
early ETBF tumorigenesis and Apc-mutation-augmented Wnt
signaling on NF-kB activation. CECs expressed Defb2 (encoding
Defensin b2), Cxcl12 (encoding SDF-1), Cxcl1 (encoding KC),
Ptgs2 (encoding COX2), and Reg3b at a higher level when iso-
lated from the distal colon of WT mice compared to Il17a�/�
mice 7 days after ETBF colonization (Figure S1). Our observa-
tions that ETBF-induced CEC expression of the IL-17 target
genes encoding KC (Cxcl1) and SDF-1 (Cxcl12), critical chemo-
kines for leukocyte trafficking, led us next to test the hypothesis
that ETBF colonization induced a distal colon gradient of IL-17
potentially underlying the regional ETBF inflammatory and tumor

 effects. We used Taqman-based qRT-PCR to measure the
expression of Il17a and IL-17-target genes Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and
Cxcl5 in each of six colon sections after 7 days of ETBF coloni-
zation (Figure 2). Strikingly, while gradients of Il17a, Il17ra, and/or
Il17rc mRNA were not detected along the colon axis, there was a
pronounced gradient of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5 mRNA expres-
sion that increased from the proximal to distal colon (Figure 2A).
Chemokine gene expression was abrogated in Il17a�/� and
Il17ra�/� mice, demonstrating that IL-17 triggered the CXC che-
mokine production (Figure 2A). We confirmed in 7-day-colonized
C57BL/6 mice that the chemokine gradient was induced in the
CEC fraction by assessing the gene expression selectively in
CECs isolated from the successive colon sections from the prox-
imal to distal colon (Figure S2A). We further evaluated whether
ETBF preferentially colonizes the mucosa of the distal colon of
ApcMin mice to drive the preferential colon tumorigenesis in the
distal region. Paradoxically, we found that ETBF mucosal adher-
ence along the colon axis was significantly less in the distal than
the proximal colon of ApcMin mice (p = 0.008) (Figure S2B). In
contrast, ETBF mucosal adherence was similar in the proximal
and distal colon of Il17a�/� and Il17ra�/� ApcMin mice (Fig-
ure S2B). These results demonstrated that increased distal colon
ApcMin mouse ETBF colonization does not drive ETBF colon tu-
mor localization; conversely, reduced ETBF colonization does
not underlie the decreased tumorigenesis in ApcMin mice defi-
cient in IL-17 CEC signaling. Nevertheless, BFT secretion by
ETBF is required to generate the gradient of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and
Cxcl5 gene expression, as the gradients of chemokine gene

 expression are lost in mice colonized with the ETBF(Dbft) strain
(Figure S2). Similar to the Il17ra and Il17rc mRNA levels, the IL-
17R protein level in CEC was largely comparable along the colon
axis upon ETBF colonization (Figure 2B), indicating that the
elevated C-X-C chemokine gene expression in the distal colon
of ETBF-colonized mice most likely does not result from
enhanced IL-17R expression. We did not find significant ETBF-
mediated changes in expression of either Tnfaip3, which en-
codes the deubiquitinase A20, a negative regulator of IL-17R
(Garg et al., 2013), or Elavl1, which encodes the protein Hur (Her-
jan et al., 2013) that is involved in Act1-mediated stabilization of
Cxcl mRNA upon IL-17 signaling (Figure S2). These results sug-
gested that increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines
along the colon axis is not due to regulatory feedback on epithe-
lial IL-17R signaling or mRNA stabilization. Since C-X-C chemo-
kines are known to be tightly regulated by NF-kB and Stat3
transcription factors, we tested the activation of NF-kB and
Stat3 along the colon axis by immunoblotting for the nuclear
translocation of p65 and pStat3, respectively, in the CECs
derived from ETBF-colonized and sham colons. The nuclear
pStat3 levels were comparable along the colon (Figure 2B),
consistent with our previously reported IHC staining results
(Wick et al., 2014). In contrast, the nuclear translocation of p65
was substantially enhanced in the CECs isolated from middle
(M; C3+C4) and distal (D; C1+C2) colon sections versus
the proximal (P; C5+C6) section of ETBF-colonized colons
compared to sham colons (Figure 2B), suggesting that ETBF
colonization triggers more robust NF-kB signaling in the distal
colon. Moreover, p65 nuclear accumulation in the ETBF-
colonized M and D colon sections was diminished when
Il17ra�/� mice were used (Figure 2C), demonstrating that the
ETBF-induced NF-kB activation is IL-17R dependent. In support
of this notion, we observed that BFT and IL-17 each directly
induced p65 nuclear translocation in the BFT-sensitive human
colon carcinoma cell line HT29/C1 (Figure 2D). In contrast,
neither BFT nor IL-17 directly induces Stat3 activation in HT29/
C1 cells (Wick et al., 2014). Finally, we confirmed the functional
relevance of BFT and IL-17-initiated NF-kB activation by deter-
mining that both significantly increased IL-8 (human homolog
to murine CXCL1/KC) secretion by HT29/C1 cells after a
4-hour treatment. (Figure S3). Together, our findings suggest
that ETBF colonization, via BFT, initiates selective distal colon
NF-kB activation dependent on IL-17 and the CEC IL-17R
that results in a gradient of C-X-C chemokine production.
This BFT/IL-17:IL-17R/NF-kB distal colon cascade correlates
with the distal localization of ETBF-induced colon tumors (Wu
et al., 2009).
IL-17 Induces Myeloid Cell Accumulation and
Tumorigenesis in the Distal cOlon of ETBF-Colonized
Mice via CXCR2-Dependent Mechanism(s)
Loss of IL-17 production or IL-17R signaling in CECs reduces
ETBF colon tumorigenesis (Figures 1B and 1D) and impacts
the expression of chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, and
CXCL12) that recruit myeloid cells (Figures S1 and 2) Thus, we
tested the hypothesis that the response of CECs to IL-17 dic-
tates the geographic distribution of myeloid populations in the
colonic lamina propria (LP), allowing their preferential trafficking
to the distal portion of the colon. Consistent with this hypothesis,
ETBF colonization induced an accumulation of polymorphonu-
clear (PMN) immature myeloid cell (IMC) (CD11bhiLy6Gpos
Ly6Cint) in distal colon (defined as C1+C2; DC1-2) when
compared to sham DC1-2 (355 ± 122 versus 5 ± 2 cells/mg tissue,
respectively; p = 0.002) (Figure 3A) or compared to proximal-
middle (PM) colon (defined as C4+C5; PMC4-5) 7 days after
ETBF colonization (355 ± 122 versus 28 ± 6 cells/mg tissue,
respectively; p = 0.0134) (Figure 3B). Although increased, the

mice, p = 0.0402) (Figure 3C). In contrast, IL-17 loss did not
significantly impact MO-IMC (24,028 ± 11,952 MO-IMC per DC
in WT versus 13,343 ± 7,093 in Il17a�/� mice, p = 0.485) or tissue
resident macrophage (Mf) accumulation (MHCIIhi-Mf [CD11b+

12,514 ± 3,800, p = 0.503] and MHCIIlo-Mf [CD11b+Ly6Cneg
Ly6GnegF480posI-A/Elo; 19,056 ± 6,773 per DC versus 6,799 ±
2,383, p = 0.150]) (Figure 3C). We previously showed that MO-
and PMN-IMC recruited in colonic tissue upon ETBF-triggered
colitis are MDSCs (Thiele Orberg et al., 2017).
In Cxcr2�/� mice (CXCR2 being the receptor for CXCL1,
CXCL2, and CXCL5), PMN-IMCs were significantly reduced in
the distal colon 7 days after ETBF colonization compared to
WT mice (PMN-IMC, 5,810 ± 4,631 per DC in Cxcr2�/� mice
versus 20,412 ± 4,739 in WT mice, p = 0.0474) (Figure 4A). Impor-
tantly, in Cxcr2�/� mice, IL-17-producing cells were still present
in colon tissue, confirming that IL-17-mediated signaling is
upstream of NF-kB activation and C-X-C chemokine (i.e.,
CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5) production by CECs (Figure 4B).
Because CXCR2 is mainly expressed by myeloid cells and,
more specifically, PMN leukocytes (Figure S4), we further tested
the impact of impaired myeloid trafficking on ETBF-triggered
colon tumorigenesis using lethally irradiated ApcMin mice recon-
stituted with BM from Cxcr2�/� versus Cxcr2+/+ (WT) mice
([Cxcr2�/�>ApcMin] and [WT > ApcMin], respectively). We found
that, upon ETBF colonization, [Cxcr2�/�>ApcMin] mice exhibited
reduced colon tumorigenesis compared to control [WT > ApcMin]
mice (Figure 4C) (10 ± 2.7 versus 21 ± 4.9, respectively, p = 0.04).
Although the expression of another IL-17 target gene, Cxcl12
(encoding SDF-1), was dramatically decreased in IL17a�/�
compared to IL17a+/+ WT distal CECs (Figure S1), mice deficient

 for Cxcr4 (coding CXCL12/SDF-1 receptor) expression in
myeloid cells (Cxcr4Dlysm- ApcMin) did not exhibit decreased
numbers of tumors. Similarly, Cx3cr1�/� (the receptor of
CX3CL1/fractalkine involved in LP macrophage trafficking) and
IL6RaDlysm ApcMin mice did not display reduced tumor numbers
(Figure S5). Together these results point to the specificity of
CXCR2-dependent myeloid recruitment—and therefore PMN
cells—to colon tumorigenesis following ETBF colonization. We
next used pepducin, a peptide that uncouples CXCR2 ligand
binding from its signaling transduction adaptor (Jamieson
et al., 2012), to further test the contribution of CXCR2 to ETBF
myeloid recruitment and tumorigenesis. Pepducin treatment
diminished ETBF-induced myeloid cell recruitment, especially
PMN-IMC (24,300 ± 3,412 PMN-IMC per DC in control versus
9,707 ± 1,973 in pepducin-treated mice, p = 0.0031) (Figure 4D),
as also observed in Cxcr2�/� mice. The decrease of PMN-IMC in
distal colon did not significantly impact the colonic mucosa
expression of Il17a, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5 gene expression,
demonstrating again that IL17-mediated CEC activation is up-
stream of CXCR2-dependent myeloid trafficking (Figure 4E).
Whereas activated myeloid cells are an important mucosal
source of IL-23 stabilizing the Th17 lineage (Grivennikov et al.,
2012), paradoxically, we found that ETBF-colonized Il23p19�/�
ApcMin mice retained LP IL-17 production and colon tumorigen-
esis (Figure S6). Together, these results suggest that the
decrease of tumor numbers in Cxcr2�/� ApcMin mice is likely
not related to a deficit in myeloid-derived IL-23. Lastly, consis-
tent with our hypothesis that distal colon myeloid recruitment
is required for ETBF tumorigenesis, daily pepducin administra-
tion to ETBF-colonized ApcMin mice resulted in significantly
lower numbers of microadenomas at 4 weeks post-colonization
compared to ApcMin mice treated with a control peptide (1.2 ±
0.3 versus 2.2 ± 0.4; p = 0.0214) (Figure 4F).
Epithelial Stat3 Signaling Is Required for ETBF-
Triggered Tumorigenesis, but Is Not Dependent on
IL-17, IL-6, or Myeloid Cells
Based on chemically induced cancer models, dysregulation of
the pro-inflammatory NF-kB/IL-6/Stat3 cascade is commonly
hypothesized as being critical to tumor proliferation and survival
(Bollrath et al., 2009; Grivennikov et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009). To
test this theory in our bacterial-induced colon tumorigenesis
model, we used ApcMin mice with deficiency in Stat3 signaling
selectively in myeloid (Stat3Dlysm-ApcMin) or, alternatively, in
the epithelial compartment (Stat3DIEC-ApcMin). Stat3 deficiency
in the myeloid compartment did not decrease ETBF tumor
numbers (data not shown). In contrast, epithelial Stat3 deficiency
nearly ablated ETBF tumor development (12.4 ± 3 in ApcMin mice
versus 3.8 ± 0.9 in Stat3DIEC-ApcMin mice, p = 0.005) (Figure 5A)
but did not impair MO- or PMN-IMC trafficking (18,489 ± 6,000
per DC versus 16,988 ± 6,900, p = 0.876 and 11,105 ± 3,371
per DC versus 12,272 ± 4,683, p = 0.900, respectively) to the
distal colon, although Mf-MHC-IIlo was significantly increased
in mice deficient in epithelial Stat3 signaling (16,719 ± 4,465
per DC in WT versus 56,985 ± 14,196 in Stat3DIEC mice, p =
0.0167) (Figure 5B). Further, ETBF mucosal adherence did not
differ in the proximal and distal colon of Stat3DIEC-ApcMin mice
(Figure S2B). Remarkably, colon tumorigenesis decreased
without significant loss of IL-17-producing LP cells (9,099 ±
3,838 per DC in WT versus 4,498 ± 2,497 in Stat3DIEC-ApcMin
p = 0.363 for Th17 cells and 15,578 ± 6,437 per DC in WT versus
9,512 ± 4,106 in Stat3DIEC-ApcMin p = 0.469 for total IL-17-pro-
ducing cells) or global Il17a expression (172.2 ± 139.6 per DC
in WT versus 119.4 ± 62.4, p = 0.762) in colonic mucosa; this
showed that, although critical to colon tumorigenesis, epithelial
Stat3 activation is not a critical contributor to Th17, gdT17 cell
differentiation, or total mucosal IL-17 upon ETBF colonization
(Figures 5C and 5D).
Stat3 activation is regulated by a wide array of cytokines and
growth factors, yielding pleiotrophic cellular effects (Yu et al.,
2009). In CECS, Stat3 activation by IL-6, IL-10/IL-22, and IL-23
has been shown to facilitate oncogenesis (Bollrath et al., 2009;
Grivennikov et al., 2009, 2012; Kryczek et al., 2014). Since
IL-6, produced by myeloid and potentially other cells, is pro-
posed as a key pro-tumoral mediator activating Stat3 in its target
cells (Bollrath et al., 2009), we tested whether IL-6 production in
the TME as well as epithelial IL-6R contributes to epithelial Stat3
activation and tumor development upon ETBF colonization of
ApcMin mice. Surprisingly, we found no significant decrease of
tumor numbers in IECDIl6ra (Figure S5) and only a non-significant
trend in Il6�/� ApcMin compared to parental ApcMin mice
colonized with ETBF (18.7 ± 3.7 in ApcMin versus 10.8 ± 1.9 in
ApcMin-Il6�/� mice, p = 0.354) (Figure 5E), suggesting a non-
essential role for IL-6 in ETBF-induced colon carcinogenesis.
We further determined that, although IL-6 was necessary for
Th17 and ILC3 differentiation, gdT17 cells were unaltered in the
LP (Figures S7A and S7B). The resulting decrease of total IL-
17-producing cells in LP of Il6�/� mice 7 days after ETBF coloni-
zation (Figure S7B) only led to a moderate and non-significant
decrease in Il17a mRNA expression (Figure 5F). Because of the
discrepancy in tumor number reduction between the Il6�/�-
and Stat3DIEC-ApcMin mice, we then sought to better understand
the mechanism of Stat3 activation in ETBF-colonized mice
and performed pStat3 IHC on colons collected from ApcMin,
Il17a�/� ApcMin, Il6�/� ApcMin, [Cxcr2�/� BM > ApcMin], and
[WT BM > ApcMin] mice 3 months after ETBF colonization (Fig-
ure 6). Surprisingly, epithelial Stat3 activation (pStat3 staining)
was still strongly detected in CEC and immune cells in all cases.
Given the role of IL-22-induced Stat3 activation in epithelial cells
to promote regeneration following tissue damage (Lindemans
et al., 2015), we also tested epithelial expression of Il22, Il22ra,
Il20, and Il24 RNA along the colon (Figure S2). No gradient of
Il22ra expression between the proximal and distal end of the
colon was identified. Consistent with our detection of low
expression of Il22 and Il24 in the distal portion of ETBF-colonized
colons, we found that Stat3 activation by IHC in Il22�/� ApcMin
mice 3 months after ETBF colonization was similar to that de-
tected in parental ApcMin mice (Figure 6B). Together our data
highlight that, in our ETBF model, Stat3 activation is likely due
to a combination of activators with the IL-22 axis playing a minor
role. Nonetheless, Stat3 activation in CECs (Figure 5A), together
with BFT, IL-17 (Figure 1), and myeloid recruitment (Figure 4), are
required for ETBF tumorigenesis.
DISCUSSION
In our model of de novo ETBF-induced tumorigenesis, we previ-
ously established that IL-17 is required for colon tumor

 development in colonized ApcMin mice (Housseau et al., 2016;
Wu et al., 2009). Upon ETBF colonization, the colonic epithelium
is characterized by rapid Stat3 activation in ICs and then in CECs
(Wick et al., 2014), but a deeper understanding of the pathogen-
esis of ETBF-induced tumor formation and the mechanistic rela-
tionship between BFT-mediated CEC action and IL-17 signaling
pathways in CECs during ETBF tumorigenesis has yet to be
established.
We previously showed that BFT binds directly to an epithelial
receptor, which is yet to be identified, to mediate E-cadherin
cleavage and onset of colitis (Wu et al., 2006). Although in
the absence of an identified BFT receptor, the downstream
signaling pathway(s) stemming from BFT CEC binding remain
unclear, our findings herein establish the strict combined
requirement for CEC IL-17R and Stat3 signaling pathways to
sustain BFT-dependent colon tumorigenesis in ETBF-colonized
ApcMin mice. Remarkably, in the absence of any one of
these components, ETBF-triggered tumorigenesis is almost
entirely abrogated. IL-17R signaling in CECs does not activate
Stat3 but rather activates NF-kB that, in turn, induces key che-
mokines, including CXCL1, yielding pro-tumoral IMC/MDSC
recruitment in a CXCR2-dependent fashion. Stat3 and NF-kB
are two core transcriptional factors regulating inflammatory
signaling pathways that are intimately linked to the tumor-asso-
ciated inflammatory environment (Yu et al., 2009). Further, we
show that IL-17 did not exert its dominant pro-tumoral role
through its control on production of the NF-kB-dependent
mediator, IL-6, (Wang et al., 2009, 2014) since the deletion of
IL-6 or epithelial IL-6R did not impair CEC Stat3 activation
and only non-significantly decreased colon tumor numbers
upon ETBF colonization. Interestingly, we found that not only
IL-6, but also IL-23 (Figures S6 and S7), is dispensable to
ETBF-triggered IL-17 production in the colon, a result that calls
into question the obligate IL-6-driven Stat3 and IL-23-depen-
dent Th17 pathways proposed for microbe-induced colon
tumorigenesis (Grivennikov et al., 2009, 2012). The IL-23/
IL-17 axis, along with myeloid cell activation associated with
epithelial barrier impairment (Grivennikov et al., 2012), is seem-
ingly not critical during ETBF tumorigenesis. Our findings
confirm the functional redundancy of Th17 and gdT17 cells
(Housseau et al., 2016), since Th17 cells persist in the absence
of Il-23 (Figure S6) and gdT17 cells in the absence of IL-6

 (Figure S7); the gdT17-produced IL-17 is sufficient to sustain
ETBF-triggered colon tumorigenesis independently of IL-6
and IL-23 (Housseau et al., 2016).
The notable regional localization of ETBF tumorigenesis to
the distal murine colon is a highly consistent feature of this
model (Wu et al., 2009). While the number of colon tumors trig-
gered by ETBF colonization of ApcMin mice varies, these tu-
mors cluster in the distal colon and are only rarely identified
in the proximal mouse colon. Our data indicate that ETBF
colon tumorigenesis absolutely requires BFT along with the
subsequent cooperation of the IL-17R and Stat3 signaling
pathways. This ETBF tumorigenesis initiation appears nucle-
ated around an increased distal CEC NF-kB response to BFT
because we did not identify contributing differences in the
mucosal abundance of ETBF, expression of IL17/IL17R, or
Stat3 activation between the proximal and distal colon. Of
note, however, the activation of NF-kB and expression of its
target genes Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl5 were increased in the
distal colon, coinciding with the preferential distribution of tu-
mors. As we sought to resolve the sequence of events result-
ing in the distal distribution of ETBF tumors, we tested a model
in which NF-kB-mediated CEC response to IL-17 and/or BFT
drives the recruitment of pro-tumoral myeloid cells in the distal
colon that likely promote tumor growth (Figure 7). We recently
established that the immune microenvironment of ETBF colon
tumors displays a myeloid immune signature including the
iNOShi MO-MDSC and a predominant population of PMN-
MDSC; this pro-tumoral inflammatory environment differs
strikingly from that associated with Fusobacterium nucleatum
and pks+E. coli colonization (Thiele Orberg et al., 2017), two
additional bacteria linked to CRC in humans and shown to
induce colon tumorigenesis in experimental murine models
(Sears and Garrett, 2014). High IL-17 levels in combination
with MDSCs (including iNOShi MO-MDSC) accumulated in
the distal colon selectively marked the pathogenic interaction
of ETBF with colon CECs (Thiele Orberg et al., 2017). Yet we
did not understand the relative roles played by both MDSC
populations in the ETBF tumorigenesis process. Using Cxcr2
deletion or CXCR2 signaling inhibition via pepducin treatment,
we found herein that impaired trafficking of the PMN-IMCs—
and, to a lesser extent, MO-IMCs (likely MDSCs; see Thiele
Orberg et al., 2017)—to the distal colon decreased tumorigen-
esis without compromising mucosal IL-17
production or
epithelial Stat3 activation. These results establish that the
myeloid environment shaped by the upstream epithelial IL-
17R/NF-kB activation following initial BFT action fosters the
regional distribution of ETBF colon tumors. Notably, the
geographic distribution of the myeloid IMCs/MDSCs following
ETBF colonization, essentially distal, did not match the overall
Stat3 activation in colonic epithelium, a feature that counters
the idea that the selective distal accumulation of IMCs/MDSCs
observed is primarily responsible for CEC STAT3 activation
and subsequent tumorigenesis. The distal clustering of IMCs/
MDSCs likely provides critical factors promoting distal colon
tumor growth, but we cannot exclude that other myeloid cell
subsets including Mf (Figure 5B) not expressing CXCR2 (Fig-
ure S4) may also deliver Stat3-activating mediators along the
ETBF-colonized colon epithelium.
Importantly, the fact that pStat3 in the proximal colon after
ETBF colonization is not associated at later time points with mi-
croadenoma formation and tumor development (Wick et al.,
2014; Wu et al., 2009), even in the presence of IL-17 and BFT,
supports a critical role for additional intrinsic distal CEC compo-
nents that are not yet fully identified in the regional distribution of
colon tumorigenesis. Herein, we identified that ETBF adherence
to the murine colon epithelium triggers a distinct response be-
tween proximal and distal colon featuring NF-kB activation.
(Wu et al., 2006). It is reasonable to propose that the epithelial
response (NF-kB signaling) to ETBF colonization might also be
conditioned by the expression of the putative CEC-associated
receptor to BFT (Wu et al., 2006). Nevertheless, while awaiting
the identification of BFT receptor, our results emphasize that,
although critical to ETBF tumorigenesis, Stat3 activation alone
is not a marker for tumor development in the ETBF-colonized
murine colon.

 Since IL-6 is dispensable for promoting either tumorigenesis
or Stat3 activation in ETBF-colonized mice, it will be critical to
understand the nature of the mediator(s) provided by the myeloid
environment—and
especially
PMN-MDSCs—that
promote
tumorigenesis. Recently, the group of J. Massague
´ showed
that myeloid CD11b+GR1+ cells, trafficking via the production
of a CXCL1 gradient provided by breast epithelial cells, secrete
the inflammatory mediator S100A8/9 that enhanced breast can-
cer cell survival without involving Stat3 activation (Acharyya
et al., 2012). Interestingly, we previously described the produc-
tion of high-level S100A8/9 by colonic MDSCs recruited upon
ETBF colonization and independent of IL-17R expression by
this myeloid population (Thiele Orberg et al., 2017). From a trans-
lational viewpoint, the association of ETBF with hCRC (Boleij
et al., 2015) and our results herein suggest that identification of
pharmacological targets aimed at countering the pro-carcino-
genic properties of ETBF may disrupt hCRC development,
such as by selectively neutralizing the deleterious inflammatory
consequences of ETBF colonization. Similarly, the potential for
clinical application of the finding that CXCR2 antagonists
counter ETBF colon tumorigenesis is of high interest, since these
agents impair the trafficking of MDSCs without blocking the pro-
tective antibacterial properties of IL-17 during acute infection
that, in general, contribute to the eradication of colon microbial
Figure 7. Schematic Representation of the Mechanistic CEC:Mucosal Relay Promoting ETBF-Induced Colon Tumorigenesis
Collectively, the data herein support a model whereby ETBF infection triggers a specific relay of cellular interactions initiated by the action of the single bacterial
virulence protein BFT on CECs; this results in IL-17-producing mucosal immune cells. These cells then turn to act on the CECs to initiate a NF-kB-associated CEC
immune response that directs distal colon myeloid mucosal infiltration, which is key to ETBF tumor localization in the distal colon. ETBF orchestrated colon
carcinogenesis occurs in the absence of IL-6 and IL-23. CEC Stat3 activation is a necessary, but not sufficient, complement to the actions of IL-17. Steps in this
model include: (1) ETBF produces BFT, a zinc-metalloprotease that induces E-cadherin cleavage that contributes to barrier permeability dysfunction as well as
Wnt/bcatenin and NF-kB signaling pathway activation. (2) A diminished colonic mucosal barrier likely contributes to the resident myeloid cell activation that in turn
contributes to the rapid onset ETBF IL-17 signature characterized by the accumulation of Th17, gdT17, and ILC3. Further, dependent on redundant cytokines due
to the BFT virulence protein of ETBF, Stat3 is highly activated in lamina propia ICs, including lymphocytes and myeloid cells. (3) IL-17/IL-17R and BFT signaling
pathways converge on CECs to activate a distal colon NF-kB cascade, resulting in the production of a C-X-C chemokine distal colon mucosal gradient, including
CXCL1 (homologous to human IL-8). (4) Although the ETBF-altered colon barrier progressively recovers its integrity, ETBF persistence maintains IL-17 production
and the chemokine gradient that promotes the accumulation of distal colon MDSCs, including high proportions of PMN-MDSC. (5) The oncogenic properties of
BFT, including BFT-induced CEC proliferation and DNA damage, likely allow the rapid loss of the second Apc allele (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) and rapid
promotion of microadenoma formation (DeStefano Shields et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2003). MDSC accumulation in the distal colon provides growth factors pro-
moting adenoma growth.

 pathogens. In our hands, the blockade of IL-17A or the use of
IL-17/IL-17R-KO mice impaired mucosal defenses and was
associated with excess mortality upon ETBF colonization (data
not shown), making IL-17 likely a poor target for inhibition in
the colon. By breaking the negative feedback loop between
MDSCs and IL-17-stimulated ApcMin CECs during ETBF colitis,
it is possible that CXCR2 inhibitors could block pro-tumoral
MDSC recruitment, increase Th17 mucosal anti-bacterial re-
sponses, and facilitate the eradication of ETBF without promot-
ing tumorigenesis.

 CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING
Further information and request for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Franck
Housseau (fhousse1@jhmi.edu).
Il17a�/�, Il17ra�/�, Il22�/� and Il23p19�/� mice have been provided upon MTA restrictions (see Key Resources Table).
EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice Strains
All mice were maintained under the same specific pathogen-free conditions at an American Association for the Accreditation of Lab-
oratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited animal facility at Johns Hopkins University. All animal housing, breeding and experimental
procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to regulatory standards.
C57BL/6, CD45.1 C57BL/6, CXCR2�/�, CXCR4-FLOX (B6.129P2-Cxcr4tm2Yzo/J), CX3CR1gfp/gfp (Cx3cr1tm1Litt), IL6Ra-FLOX
(B6;SJL-Il6ratm1.1Drew/J), IL6 KO (B6;129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME)
and MinApc716/+ (ApcMin) were obtained from Dr. David Huso (Johns Hopkins University) and bred in the vivarium. STAT3-FLOX
(B6.Cg-Stat3tm2Aki) were kindly provided by Dr Chuck Drake (Johns Hopkins University). Il17a�/� and Il17ra�/� were obtained
from Dr Yoichiro Iwakura (Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr Tomas Mustelin (Amgen, Seattle), respectively.
Il23p19�/� mice and Il22�/� mice were kindly provided by Dr N. Ghilardi, and Dr W. Ouyang, respectively (Genentech Inc, San
Francisco, CA) and under the condition of an MTA between both institutions. LysM-cre and/or Villin-cre mice were crossed with
CXCR4-FLOX
(B6.129P2-Cxcr4tm2Yzo/J),
CX3CR1gfp/gfp
(Cx3cr1tm1Litt),
IL6Ra-FLOX
(B6;SJL-Il6ratm1.1Drew/J),
STAT3-FLOX
(B6.Cg-Stat3tm2Aki) to target selectively myeloid or epithelial cells, respectively, for deletion of the gene of interest. Four-week-old
mice on a C57BL/6 background were used for B fragilis colonization in all experiments. We previously used male and female
mice for ETBF colonization and didn’t find any difference. Therefore, each time possible we used female mice, but for complex ge-
netic models, such as conditional KO mice on Min background, we used indifferently male and female mice to accrue enough mice
per group. For breeding, two females are generally breed with one male, and resulting litters including KO mice and their control lit-
termates, are co-housed up to 5 mice per cage in all experiments. All mice used in experiments are genotyped according to the pro-
tocol provided by the supplier and the conditional KO models were validated by gene expression in the isolated target cells (myeloid
or epithelial cells for LysM-CRE or Villin-CRE, respectively).
Bone Marrow Chimera Mice
When conditional KO mice were not available, bone marrow chimera mice were used to test the effect of gene deletion in BM-derived
hematopoietic cells versus non-BM derived hematopoietic cells, including epithelial cells. Briefly, 107 bone marrow cells from donor
mice were injected i.v. into lethally irradiated (1200 cGy; twice 600cG at 4hr interval) 6-8 week-old recipients. BM-reconstituted mice
were rested an additional 6 weeks prior to Bacteroides fragilis (B fragilis) colonization.
bft-2 Isogenic Mutant
ETBF strain 086-54443-2-2 was used to generate a bft-2 isogenic mutant. This strain harbors two copies of the bft-2 gene. An in-
frame deletion of both bft-2 gene copies was made using a similar method for creation of bft-1 mutant (Rhee et al., 2009). In brief,
nucleotide fragments flanking the bft-2 gene were PCR-amplified from stain 086-44443-2-2 using two sets of primers. Primer 1
(BamHI, 50-TTTACATTGGATCCCATGAGATTGGC) and primer 2 (XhoI, 50-GGAAGCTGTAACTCGAGTATCAATAGA) amplified
3.06 kb region upstream of bft-2 and primer 3 (XhoI, 50-CATGCGGATGCTCGAGAAGATTTGAT and primer 4 (BamHI, 50-CTA
AAAGTTGGATCCGTCCCACTGGA) amplified 3.02 kb down stream of bft-2 gene (AY372755.1) (Franco et al., 1997). PCR products
were inserted into suicide plasmid pGWA34.2(Whittle et al., 2003) by three way ligation to create a plasmid with a truncated bft-2
gene (pGWA34.2::^bft). pGWA34.2::^bft was introduced into strain 086-54443-2-2 by mating (Rhee et al., 2009; Whittle et al.,
2003). The partial bft-2 mutant (086.17.6) was selected by cefoxitin (20 mg/ml) resistance for single homologous recombination
and subsequently by gain of sensitivity to cefoxitin for second homologous recombination. Using forward primer iso7 (50-GGAG
CAGGCAATAACAATCGTCGAC-30) and reverse primer iso8 (50-GCATCAGTGGAAATGGGATGAGTAT-30), we confirmed that the
selected clone contained a truncated bft-2 (0.45 kb) or a full-length (1.2kb) bft-2 gene. Using the same approach, pGWA34.2::^bft
was introduced into the clone with the deletion of the first copy of the bft-2 gene to delete the second copy of the bft-2 gene, resulting
in the isogenic bft-2 mutant, 086^bft2.
Bacteria Strain Growth
Wild-type ETBF strain 86-5443-2-2, and isogenic mutant BFT 86-5443-2-2 that does not express BFT [ETBF(Dbft)] were used in this
study (Wu et al., 2002). Briefly, B fragilis strains were grown at 37�C under anaerobic conditions in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth
supplemented with hemin (0.5mg/liter), vitamin K1 (0.1mg/liter), L-cysteine (50mg /liter) and 6 mg/liter of clindamycin was added
into brain heart infusion broth for transformed strains (Wick et al., 2014). One colony is grown overnight anaerobically at 37�C and
an aliquot is washed in PBS and adjusted to an optical density of 109 CFU/ml for mouse inoculations.

 Mouse Colonization by B fragilis Strains
As previously described, mice were treated at 4 weeks of age per os with antibiotic (clindamycin and streptomycin) for 5 days and
then colonized with the B fragilis strains (Wu et al., 2009). A 100 mL volume of PBS containing 1 3 108 CFU of B. fragilis was admin-
istrated by a gavage needle. Antibiotic treatment was stopped after bacterial inoculation. Serial dilution of murine fecal samples were
cultured periodically post-inoculation to quantify and monitor continuous ETBF colonization.
Cell Line Culture
HT29/C1 cells were obtained from Dr. Daniel Louvard (Huet et al., 1987) and used experimentally as previously described (Wu
et al., 2007). HT29/C1 cells were grown to 80% confluency in 24 well culture plates in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM, 4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine, no sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 I.U.
penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37�C in a cell culture incubator with 10% CO2.
METHOD DETAILS
Tumor and Microadenoma Counts
Tumors are counted in formalin-fixed, methylene blue-stained colons blindly by SW and/or CLS. For histologic studies, formalin-fixed
tissue was paraffin-embedded (FFPE), sectioned (5 mm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E staining). Microadenoma were
counted by two blinded individuals (DLH and SW).
Pepducin Treatment
CXCR2-specific (RTLFKAHMGQKHR) pepducin and negative control (TRFLAKMHQGHKR) peptide were purchased from Genscript
(NJ, USA). Pepducin treatment was performed according to protocols developed by Jamieson et al. (Jamieson et al., 2012). In brief,
mice received an initial dose of 2.5 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection followed by a daily maintenance dose of 1 mg/kg. Dosing began
24 hours after ETBF infection and continued until harvest.
Leukocyte Isolation from Gut Lamina Propria
Proximal and distal colon were cut, washed and enzymatically digested (400 U/ml Liberase and 0.1 mg/ml DNase1; Roche Diagnos-
tics, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (Thiele Orberg et al., 2017). Distal colon refers to cell isolation from the smooth, non-
ridged, portion of the mouse colon (C1 to C4 in Figure 2). When cells were isolated from specific segments of the colon, this is labeled
in the text. Leukocytes were isolated from single cell suspension using 80/40/20 Percoll density gradient centrifugation (GE Health-
care Life Science, Pittsburgh, PA).
Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting
Single cell suspensions enriched for leukocytes were characterized according to their myeloid and lymphoid populations by flow cy-
tometry analysis. Myeloid cell staining was performed following the procedure previously described by Thiele-Orberg et al. (Thiele
Orberg et al., 2017). Briefly, MO-IMC were characterized as CD45+CD3-CD11bhiLy6ChiLy6G-F4/80-/lowI-A/E-/low, PMN-IMC as
CD45+CD3-CD11bhi Ly6CintLy6G+F4/80-I-A/E-, and MV as CD45+CD3-CD11bintLy6C-Ly6G-F4/80hi cells. For intracellular cytokine
staining, cells were stimulated for 4.5 h with 30 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1 mM ionomycin (both eBioscience) in pres-
ence of Golgistop (BD). Cells were subsequently stained for cell surface markers (CD4-PerCp/Cy5.5, GK1.5; CD3-AF700, 17A2;
CD8-PE/CF594, 53-6.7; all Biolegend) followed by fixation/permeabilization (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD) and staining using IL-17A-Pa-
cific Blue (TC11-18H10.1, Biolegend). Flow cytometry was performed using a LSRII cytometer (BD) and data were analyzed with
FACSDiVa 6.1.3 software (BD). For cell sorting experiments, CEC populations were sorted as CD45-EpCAM+ cells using an AriaII
cytometer (BD).
Gene Expression
RNA was extracted from whole colonic tissue using the RNAeasy kit (Quiagen) and following the manufacturer instructions. Expres-
sion of target genes was analyzed using Taqman technology-based pre-designed gene expression kit from ABI (Thermofisher/Life
Technologies). For gene expression performed in epithelial cells (Figure S1), 48 target genes were tested using Taqman technology-
based custom-designed PCR array plates (Thermofisher/Life Technologies; Table S1). Expression of the genes of interest was
normalized to Gapdh expression. Results were expressed as DCt or DDCt (RQ, relative expression).
Immunohistochemistry
Serial FFPE tissue sections were deparaffinized and antigens retrieved by incubation in citrate buffer before anti-pStat3 staining (Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA) as previously described (Wick et al., 2014). PowerVision HRP mouse anti-rabbit (Leica Microsystems, Ban-
nockburn, IL) was used as secondary. Sections were analyzed on an EcliPSE E800 microscope (Nikon Corporation).
Immunofluorescence
After fixation and paraffin embedding, tissue was cut into 5-mm sections. Antigen retrieval was performed by placing slides containing
the sections in a citrate-based antigen-unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories) and boiling them in a microwave. Following this
e4

 step, sections were permeabilized for 30 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS, and blocking of nonspecific reactivity was performed for
45 min in 10%FBS/ 0.2%Triton X-100 in TBS at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% FBS/ 0.2% Triton
X-100/ TBS and incubated overnight. Anti-IL-17RA (clone H-168, Rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz) was used at a concentration of
1:100. Validation data for this antibody is shown in McAllister et al. (McAllister et al., 2014). Slides were then washed three times
in 0.2%Triton X-100 in PBS, and sections were incubated with the appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies
at a 1:300 dilution for 1 hr at RT in the dark. Alexa 488- conjugated anti-E-cadherin (Mouse IgG2a, BD) antibody was used at a con-
centration on 1:100. Cy3-conjugated anti-actin alpha-smooth muscle (SMA; SIGMA) was used at 1:750. Nuclei were labeled with
DAPI (1:1,000) and slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs). Images were acquired using a Nikon
confocal imaging microscope and NIS Elements software.
Isolation of Primary Colonic Epithelial Cells for Western Blot Analysis
Colonic epithelial cells (CECs) were isolated from mice as previously described (Fu et al., 2016). In brief, after euthanizing mice, the
entire colon was removed under aseptic conditions and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. After dividing the colon into 2–3 mm long
fragments and transferring them into chelating buffer (27 mM trisodium citrate, 5 mM Na2HPO4, 96 mM NaCl, 8 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM
KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 55 mM D-sorbitol, 44 mM sucrose, 6 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA [pH 7.3]) for 15 min at 4�C, CECs were then dislodged
by repeated vigorous shaking. Tissue debris was removed by a 40-mm cell-strainer (Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA) and CECs were
harvested by centrifugation at 4�C. Isolated CECs were cultured at 37�C for 1 h for recovery, followed by indicated treatment. Sub-
cellular fractionation was carried out by differential centrifugation as previously described (Fu et al., 2016).
Immunoblot Analysis
Immunoblot assays were conducted as previously described (Fu et al., 2016). Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed on ice by 0.4 mL
of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 3 complete protease inhibitor
cocktail [Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN]) for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 3 g at 4�C for 10 min, and the
protein-normalized lysates were subjected to a separation by SDS-PAGE under reduced and denaturing conditions. The resolved
protein bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed by the Super Signaling system (Fisher Scientific) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions, and imaged using a FluorChem E System (Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA).
IL-8 Detection in HT29/C1 Cells Culture Supernatant
HT29/C1 were washed with DMEM and medium was replaced with fresh DMEM for 30 minutes prior to cytokine treatment. BFT, hu-
man recombinant IL-17a and TNFa (Thermofisher), were then added for 4hrs. IL-8 was measured in the culture supernatants using
ELISA. BD OptEIA Human IL-8 ELISA set (BD Biosciences) was used to coat 96 flat-bottom well Nunc-Immuno polystyrene ELISA
plates (Thermofisher) according to manufacturer’s specifications. BD Pharmigen TMB substrate reagent (BD Bioscience) was used
as the substrate.
ETBF Mucosal Colonization
Mucosal colonization was confirmed and quantified on approximately 200 mg of tissue collected from the terminal 2 cm of the distal
mouse colon and between 1 and 2 cm from the cecum. Tissue was weighed, placed in 500 mL of 0.016% DTT PBS, and vortexed for
approximately 10 s. Tissue was then rinsed by vortexing twice in saline. Samples were homogenized and quantified (CFU/gm tissue)
by plating on selective media as described previously (Boleij et al., 2015).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test in GraphPad Prism 7. Data are presented as mean ± SEM p values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
