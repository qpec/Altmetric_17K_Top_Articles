 Prevalence of Hearing Loss in US Children and Adolescents
Findings From NHANES 1988-2010
Brooke M. Su, MD, MPH; Dylan K. Chan, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE There have been concerns about increasing levels of hearing impairment in
children and adolescents, especially in relation to noise exposure, because even mild levels of
hearing loss can affect educational outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To further characterize changes in prevalence of hearing loss and noise exposures
in the US pediatric population over time.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective analysis of demographic and
audiometric data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III, 1988-1994), NHANES 2005-2006, NHANES 2007-2008, and NHANES 2009-2010. The
NHANES are nationally representative survey data sets collected and managed by the US
National Center for Health Statistics, and this study includes a total of 7036 survey
participants ages 12 to 19 years with available audiometric measurements.
EXPOSURES Hearing-related behaviors and risk factors such as history of ear infections, noise
exposures, firearm use, and hearing protection use.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Level of hearing loss measured by pure-tone audiometry,
as well as high-frequency and low-frequency hearing loss and noise-induced threshold shifts.
RESULTS Overall, data from 7036 survey participants ages 12 to 19 years with available
audiometric measurements were analyzed. The prevalence of hearing loss increased from
NHANES III to NHANES 2007-2008 (17.0% to 22.5% for >15 dB hearing loss; absolute
difference, 5.5%; 95% CI, 6.1%-10.3%) but decreased in the NHANES 2009-2010 to 15.2%
(absolute difference, 7.2%; 95% CI, 2.0%-12.4%) with no significant overall secular trend
identified. There was an overall rise in exposure to loud noise or music through headphones
24 hours prior to audiometric testing from NHANES III to NHANES 2009-2010. However,
noise exposure, either prolonged or recent, was not consistently associated with an increased
risk of hearing loss across all surveys. The most recent survey cycle showed that nonwhite
race/ethnicity and low socioeconomic status are independent risk factors for hearing loss.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This analysis did not identify significant changes in prevalence
of hearing loss in US youth ages 12 to 19 years over this time period despite increases in
reported noise exposures. No consistent associations were shown between noise exposure
and hearing loss, though there was an association between racial/ethnic minority status and
low socioeconomic status and increased risk of hearing loss. Ongoing monitoring of hearing
loss in this population is necessary to elucidate long-term trends and identify targets for
intervention.

earing impairment in children is a major public health
burden given its impact on early speech and lan-
guage development, and subsequently on academic
and workforce performance later in life. Even mild levels of
hearing loss have been found to negatively affect educational
outcomesandsocialfunctioning.1-3Withmultipleexistingclas-
sificationsofhearingimpairmentandlimitedavailabilityofob-
jectivemeasures,assessingtheepidemiologyofpediatrichear-
ing loss has been challenging.4,5 There have been growing
concerns that the prevalence of hearing loss in children and
adolescents, particularly noise-induced hearing loss, is ris-
ing, possibly due to recreational noise exposure.6-8

There are now audiometric data available from NHANES
through 2010 for US children and adolescents ages 12 to 19
years. We aimed to further characterize changes in preva-
lence of hearing loss and noise exposures in this population
from 1988 to 2010, to evaluate whether the previously de-
scribed trends have continued.
Methods
NHANES
The NHANES is an ongoing, nationally representative series of
surveys designed to provide estimates of health and nutri-
tional status for the noninstitutionalized civilian population
of the United States. Each cycle consists of questionnaires and
a standardized health examination. Individual cycles and sur-
vey design have been previously described.11-13
The third NHANES, or NHANES III, was conducted from
1988 to 1994 and provides cross-sectional estimates for the pe-
riod as a whole. The health examination included an audiom-
etry component.12,14 Starting in 1999, the NHANES became a
continuous survey with data released in 2-year cycles. The au-
diometry component for participants ages 12 to 19 years was
only conducted during NHANES 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and
2009-2010.13
Sample
The study population consisted of all survey participants ages
12 to 19 years in NHANES III (n = 3425), NHANES 2005-2006
(n = 2288),2007-2008(n = 1238),and2009-2010(n = 1339).Par-
ticipants with a missing or incomplete audiometric exam, or a
greaterthanorequalto10decibel(dB)differencebetween1kHz
test-retest thresholds, were excluded from the analysis.
Audiometric Measures
For all NHANES cycles, standardized audiometry protocols
were conducted in a sound-isolated room by technicians
trained by a certified audiologist from the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health. The equipment and test-
ingprotocolschangedbetweenNHANESIIIandNHANES2005-
2006, but did not change from 2005 to 2010. Air-conduction
thresholds for each ear were determined, using standard au-
diometric headphones, from 0.5 to 8 kHz, across an intensity
range of −10 dB to 110 dB in NHANES III and −10 dB to 120 dB
in NHANES 2005-2010. The 1 kHz frequency was tested twice
in each ear to assess reliability of participant response.15,16
Aretestingprotocolwasusedtopreventsignalcrossoverbe-
tween ears through bone conduction. If there was a difference

ence in threshold between ears of 25 dB at 0.5 and 1 kHz, or by
40 dB at all higher frequencies, retesting was performed using
insert earphones and the retest values were used. Participants
with cochlear implants or unable to tolerate headphones were
excluded. NHANES III also did not test participants with drain-
ageordischargefromeitherear.15,16Fullaudiometricprocedure

Demographic and Hearing-Related Variables
Participants were grouped into 2-year categories by age (12-
13, 14-15, 16-17, and 18-19 years), as done in preceding studies.9
RaceandethnicitywererecordeddifferentlybetweenNHANES
III and 2005 to 2010, and for this analysis were grouped into
the following categories: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican-American, and other (including other His-
panic, and nonblack, non-Hispanic groups such as Asian-
American, native American, mixed race). The surveys had in-
sufficient sample size for reliable estimates of all Hispanic
persons prior to 2007, and for non–Mexican-American His-
panic subgroups from 1999 to 2010.17 Poverty-income ratio
(PIR) was determined by family income divided by the fed-
eral poverty threshold each year.17 For comparison with prior
studies, 3 PIR categories were created: 1.3 or less (low), 1.4 to
3.5 (middle), and higher than 3.5 (high).10,18
In NHANES III, participants were asked about number of
ear infections, if they had ever worn a hearing aid, if they had
been exposed to loud noise in the 24 hours prior to the exam,
Key Points
Questions How has prevalence of hearing loss in US children and
adolescents changed from 1988 to 2010, and are changes
associated with risk factors such as noise exposures?
Findings In this analysis of nationally representative US surveys,
there was no overall change in prevalence of hearing loss, and no
consistent associations were identified between hearing loss and
noise exposures. In the most recent survey cycle, racial/ethnic
minorities and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds were
at increased risk of hearing loss.
Meaning Long-term monitoring of this population is needed to
further understand relationships between hearing loss, noise
exposures, and minority and low-income groups.

 and if they had listened to music through headphones in the
past 24 hours. In NHANES 2005-2010, participants were asked
if they had ever had 3 or more ear infections, and so the cor-
responding NHANES III answers were re-coded into “less than
3” and “3 or more” ear infections; NHANES 2005-2010 also in-
cluded the same question on hearing aids but combined the
recent noise and music with headphones exposures into a
single question, so for this analysis we combined the NHANES
III responses into 1 group (“yes” meaning either noise or mu-
sic exposure). Additionally, NHANES 2005-2010 asked about
both job-related and non–job-related exposure to loud noise
of at least 5 hours per week, firearm use, and how often par-
ticipants used hearing protection. For ease of analysis, an-
swers to the question on hearing protection were dichoto-
mized to “most or some of the time” and “rarely or never.”
Hearing Loss and Noise-Induced Threshold Shifts Criteria
We replicated definitions of hearing loss used by Shargorod-
sky et al9 and Henderson et al10: low-frequency hearing loss
(LFHL) was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, and
2 kHz thresholds of 15 or more dB in either ear. High-
frequencyhearingloss(HFHL)hadseparatedefinitionsinthose
2 studies (Shargorodsky et al defined as PTA at 3, 4, 6, and
8 kHz ≥15 dB; Henderson et al used PTA at 3, 4, and 6 kHz
≥15 dB).9,10 We created a variable of HFHL for participants that
met criteria for either of the definitions. Overall hearing loss,
asdefinedbyShargorodskyetalwasanyhearingloss15ormore
dB in either ear (including HFHL or LFHL).9 A second, more
conservative measure of overall hearing loss was defined as
PTA 20 or more dB at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz.
Noise-induced threshold shifts (NITS), as defined in prior
studies,19 show a noise-notch audiometric pattern meeting the
following 3 criteria: (1) thresholds at 0.5 and 1 kHz both 15 dB
orless;(2)themaximumthresholdat3,4,or6kHzis15ormore
dB higher than the highest threshold at 0.5 and 1 kHz; and (3)
the threshold at 8 kHz is 10 or more dB lower than the maxi-
mal threshold at 3, 4 or 6 kHz.19
Statistical Analysis
Analytical techniques accounting for the multistage survey
sampling and clustering design were used to obtain descrip-
tive statistics using NHANES-provided sampling weights for
each survey cycle. Data are reported as weighted and nation-
ally representative estimates of means and frequencies un-
less otherwise stated. Sample means were compared using
2-sided t tests, and sample proportions were compared using
Rao-Scott χ2 tests. The z score test was used for comparison
of proportions between survey cycles, and 95% CIs were con-
structed using the Wald method. Multivariate logistic regres-
sion accounting for survey design was used to evaluate the re-
lationship of dependent variables such as demographic
characteristics and hearing-related risk behaviors to the odds
of hearing loss or NITS for each survey cycle. The 3 cycles from
2005 to 2010 were also appended, using appropriate new sam-
plingweightsasprovidedbyNHANES,17intoanaggregateddata
setforfurtherregressionanalysis(foridentifyingseculartrends
in prevalence as well as increasing statistical power to iden-
tify risk factors for hearing loss).
Audiometric results of “no response” were recoded as the
maximumdBthresholdtested.Questionnaireresponsesof“re-
fused” or “don’
t know” were recoded as missing. Missing val-
uesweretreatedasnotmissingatrandom.SASversion9.4(SAS
Institute) was used for all analyses, and all statistical tests were
performed with a significance level of P ≤ .05.
Because of the NHANES sampling design, estimates based
on a denominator of less than 30 unweighted sample events
are considered unreliable.17,20 Some variables (hearing aid use
and race/ethnicity categories) were collapsed or excluded from
regression models due to small sample size.
Results
Longitudinal Demographics
Atotalof7036participantswereincludedacrossthe4NHANES
cycles;1254wereexcludedforincompleteexaminationsordis-
crepancy in the 1-kHz test-retest thresholds. The percentage
of excluded participants was 23.7% from NHANES III, 18.0%
from NHANES 2005-2006, 14.9% from NHANES 2007-2008,
and 15.2% from NHANES 2009-2010. There were no signifi-
cant differences between the sample and excluded partici-
pants by age, sex, race/ethnicity, or PIR except in NHANES III
(mean PIR of sample is higher by 0.34) and NHANES 2009-
2010 (average age of sample is 0.5 years older).
Weassessedgeneralandhearing-specificdemographicfea-
tures of the populations across all survey cycles (Table). Sex
and age distribution remained stable. PIR increased signifi-
cantly from 2.34 in NHANES III to 2.74 (difference in means,
0.4; 95% CI, 0.12-0.67) in NHANES 2005-2006 and was un-
changed through NHANES 2009-2010. The percent of partici-
pants reporting 3 or more ear infections decreased from 71.1%
in NHANES III to 34.2% to NHANES 2005-2006 (difference,
32.6%;95%CI,26.8%-38.4%);however,thereweremanymiss-
ing responses in NHANES III (34.0%) compared with subse-
quent cycles (<1.0%), making this comparison unreliable. The
proportion of participants exposed to loud noise or music with
headphones24hoursbeforeaudiometryincreasedfrom20.8%
in NHANES III to 44.7% in NHANES 2007-2008 (difference,
24.0%; 95% CI, 19.3%-28.6%) before stabilizing in NHANES
2009-2010. Job-related and job-unrelated exposures to loud
noise, as well as firearm use, did not change. Hearing protec-
tion use decreased from NHANES 2005-2006 with 22.4% re-
porting use at least some of the time to only 14.6% in 2010 (dif-
ference, 7.8%; 95% CI, 2.4%-13.2%).
Hearing Loss Prevalence
The prevalence of hearing loss defined as a PTA of 20 or more
dB did not show significant change from NHANES III to
NHANES 2009-2010 (Figure 1). With a PTA of 15 or more dB,
theprevalencewasmuchhigher.FromNHANESIIItoNHANES

 was significant, the changes in LFHL were not. The preva-
lence of NITS also increased, though not significantly, from
15.8% in NHANES III to 17.5% in NHANES 2007-2008 (differ-
ence, 1.7%; 95% CI, −1.9% to 5.3%), then dropped to 12.8% by
NHANES 2009-2010 (difference, 4.7%; 95% CI, 1.4%-8.0%).
To investigate for secular trend, the 3 survey cycles from
2005 to 2010 were appended into a single aggregate data set,
ashasbeendoneinpreviousstudies.21Linearregressionanaly-
sis of hearing loss prevalence (including HFHL, LFHL, and
NITS), with survey cycle year as the dependent variable, did
not reveal any significant trend over time (data not shown).
Predictors of Hearing Loss
Overall, multivariate regression analysis showed little consis-
tency among risk factors associated with hearing loss or NITS
across survey cycles (eTable in the Supplement). Male sex and
older age were associated with increased odds of hearing loss
by certain definitions, and high PIR with lower odds of hear-
ing loss, which have been previously described.9,18,19 Ad-
justed odds ratios (ORs) for hearing loss at 15 or more dB in the
most recent cycle NHANES 2009-2010 are shown in detail in
Figure 2. Non-Hispanic whites and those with high PIR (>3.5)
had a lower likelihood of hearing loss than any other race/
ethnicity category (OR, 0.659; 95% CI, 0.444-0.976) or the low
PIR category (OR, 0.538; 95% CI, 0.295-0.979). History of 3 or
more ear infections was also associated with increased odds
of hearing loss (OR, 2.159; 95% CI, 1.463-3.185).
In Figure 3, individuals with 3 or more ear infections or low
PIR maintained a higher prevalence of hearing loss compared
to those with less than 3 ear infections or high PIR across all
survey cycles. In contrast, whereas white, non-Hispanic chil-
dren had a lower prevalence of hearing loss compared with all
nonwhites through NHANES 2007-2008, this relationship
changedinNHANES2009-2010.ByNHANES2009-2010,non-
white children had a significantly higher incidence of hearing
loss when compared with white children. To increase statis-
tical power (but at the cost of temporal resolution), we aggre-
gated the 3 NHANES survey cycles from 2005 to 2010 and

 analyzed this data set with multivariable logistic regression at
a single time point. In this model, male sex, a history of 3 or
more ear infections, and low PIR were found to be signifi-
cantly associated with increased odds of hearing loss at 15 or
more dB (Figure 4).

Discussion
As was previously reported through NHANES 2005-2006, we
confirmed an increase in the prevalence of hearing loss and
NITSfrom1988to1994through2007to2008.9,10Thosetrends
did not continue, and prevalence of hearing loss actually de-
creased significantly between 2007 and 2010 to levels even
lower than in NHANES III. Meanwhile, the percentage of par-
ticipants reporting exposure to loud noise or music through
headphonesincreasedandremainedelevated,anduseofhear-
ing protection declined. Notably, despite these seemingly con-
current changes in hearing loss prevalence and reported noise
exposure through 2008, regression analysis did not reveal an
association between noise exposures and hearing loss. There
was also no association between NITS and noise exposures. In
aggregate analysis of all survey cycles, we identified male sex,
a history of 3 or more ear infections, and lower socioeco-
nomic status as risk factors for hearing loss, corroborating re-
sults from NHANES III and NHANES 2005-2006.9,18,19 These
findings in total call into question previous conclusions that
increasing noise exposure is responsible for increasing levels
of pediatric hearing loss.10,19
In NHANES 2009-2010, participants with the lowest PIR
were more likely to have hearing loss than those participants
with high PIR, even adjusting for known associations with sex
and number of ear infections (as a proxy for access to medical
care).Thisfinding,whileconsistentwiththeliteratureandalso

 present globally, is concerning because it has persisted from
1988 through 2010.9,18,22 Participants from racial/ethnic mi-
nority backgrounds were also shown in NHANES 2009-2010
to have a higher likelihood of hearing loss than non-Hispanic
whites.
When comparing hearing loss in NHANES with rates of
hearing loss identified via universal newborn hearing screen-
ings across the United States, the prevalence is higher in the
12-to-19-year-old age group by any PTA definition of hearing
loss (when compared with an average of 1.1% of newborns in
2004-2006).4,23Yet,thiscomparisonislikelymisleading,given
that these early detection and intervention programs vary
widely between states. Furthermore, over 40% of infants who
fail the newborn screen are lost to audiologic follow-up, which
suggests the true prevalence of newborn hearing loss may be
higher than is currently reported.23
Limitations
Large survey databases can only provide cross-sectional esti-
mates, often primarily based on participant self-report, and so
must be interpreted with caution. Though NHANES has been
usedwidelyforamyriadofconditions,itsharesthoselimitations:
hearing-related behaviors such as noise exposure and hearing
protection use were all self-reported.21,24 However, because

 different from the 3 cycles between 2005 and 2010.11,12,15,16
From 2005 to 2010, only the sampling design changed in 2007
in terms of study locations and oversampling of minority
groups.11 It is possible the observed increase in hearing loss
from NHANES III to NHANES 2007-2008 was an artifact of
sampling design or change in audiologic methods. There were
no design changes from 2007 to 2010, and yet a large and sig-
nificant decrease in prevalence of hearing loss was seen. An-
other potential source of bias is the group of participants ex-
cludedonthebasisofincompleteexaminations.Examinations
may have been left incomplete because of uncooperative sub-
jects, potentially with more severe hearing loss. These inter-
actions are not recorded in survey documentation.
Despite those limitations, this study is the first to de-
scribe audiometric data and hearing-related behaviors in this
population age 12 to 19 years from the NHANES cycles from
2007 to 2010. Though definitions of hearing loss, HFHL, and
LFHL have not been standardized across disciplines,4 this
analysisincludedseveraldefinitionsusedpreviouslyandfound
no significant trends in prevalence throughout. Similar asso-
ciations between hearing loss, race/ethnicity, and low socio-
economic status were suggested in prior studies, but this study
is the first study that we know of to demonstrate these find-
ings in a nationally representative sample with the most up-
to-date, comprehensive, and standardized audiometric test-
ing available.18,27-29 The effects of PIR and race/ethnicity in
NHANES 2009-2010 are independent of each other, and the
underlying causes of these disparities are still not well
understood.30 This fact, that a racial and ethnic disparity ex-
ists beyond socioeconomic status, has crucial implications for
future efforts to prevent and treat hearing loss, especially if
prevalence continues to rise in these populations.
It may be that there was a true increase in the prevalence of
hearinglossinyouthages12to19yearsbetween1988and2008,
duringanupswinginrecreationalnoiseexposurethroughhead-
phones or personal music players. This increase may have sub-
sequentlystabilizedduetoawarenesseffortsoftherisksofnoise
exposure, though the relationship to hearing loss remains
unclear.31Itcouldbethatthesedifferencesbetweensurveycycles

resent fluctuations over a larger pattern requiring more data to

pendent associations between hearing loss and characteristics

may be of interest as targets for policymakers and public health
interventions, particularly since even mild hearing loss in chil-
dren has been demonstrated to impact educational and func-
tionaloutcomes.1Unfortunately,thoughtheNHANEScontinues

Conclusions
Incontrasttopriorstudies,thisanalysisofnationallyrepresen-
tative survey data from 1988 through 2010 did not identify sig-
nificant increasing or decreasing trends in prevalence of hear-
ing loss among US children and adolescents ages 12 to 19 years.
