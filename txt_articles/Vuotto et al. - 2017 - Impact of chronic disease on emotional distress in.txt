BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to examine associations between childhood cancer therapies, chronic health condi-
tions, and symptoms of emotional distress in adult survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: Participants included 5021 adult survi-
vors of childhood cancer (mean age, 32.0 years [standard deviation, 7.6 years] with a time since diagnosis of 23.2 years [standard
deviation, 4.5 years]) who completed measures assessing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Cardiac, pulmo-
nary, and endocrine conditions were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 4.03; grades 1-4). Structural equation modeling was used to examine hypothesized pathways between cancer treatment
exposures, chronic health conditions, and symptoms of emotional distress. Multivariable models were used to estimate relative risks
(RRs) for associations between chronic health conditions and distress. RESULTS: Survivors with cardiovascular, endocrine, or pulmo-
nary conditions were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of emotional distress symptoms. In path analyses and multivari-
able models, significant effects were observed between endocrine (b 5 .12 [P 5.002] and RR, 1.3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI),
1.1-1.6]) and pulmonary (b 5 .13 [P<.001] and RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7]) conditions and depression, and between cardiac (b 5 .13 [P 5.001]
and RR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]) and pulmonary (b 5 .15 [P<.001] and RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-2.0]) conditions and anxiety. All treatment-
related chronic health conditions were found to be associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms (cardiac: b 5 .09 [P 5.004] and
RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]; endocrine: b 5 .12 [P<.001] and RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]; and pulmonary: b 5 .13 [P<.001] and RR, 1.4 [95% CI,
1.2-1.6]). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic health conditions resulting from childhood cancer therapies contribute to emotional distress in adult
survivors. Targeted mental health screening efforts in this at-risk population appear warranted. Therapeutic approaches should
consider the complex interplay between chronic health conditions and symptoms of emotional distress. Cancer 2017;123:521-8. V

INTRODUCTION
Improvements in survival rates of childhood cancer over the last 50 years have resulted in a growing number of long-term
survivors. Current estimates indicate that nearly 400,000 survivors currently are living in the United States.1,2 Survivors
who have been exposed to potentially toxic cancer-directed therapies in childhood are at an increased risk of developing
late health complications.3,4 Results from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) have indicated that adult survi-
vors of childhood cancer have a substantially greater cumulative incidence of a severe, disabling, life-threatening, or fatal
health condition by age 50 years compared with siblings (53.6% vs 19.8%).5 Clinically ascertained data from the St. Jude
Lifetime Cohort have suggested the cumulative incidence of chronic health conditions (of any severity) to be 95% by age
45 years, with approximately 56% of � 10-year survivors of childhood cancer developing cardiac conditions (95% confi-
dence interval [95% CI], 53.5%-59.2%), 65% developing pulmonary conditions (95% CI, 60.4%-69.8%), and 62% de-
veloping endocrine conditions (95% CI, 59.5%-64.6%).6
Subgroups of adult survivors also are at risk of symptoms of emotional distress.7-9 In a longitudinal analysis, survivors
who perceived their health status to worsen over time were found to be at risk of increasing symptoms of depression and

 anxiety.7 Past studies also have reported that self-
perceptions of health status and physical symptoms are as-
sociated with psychological distress symptoms in adoles-
cent and young adult survivors10-12; however, to our
knowledge, little information is available to date regarding
the link between chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) ex-
posure, subsequent chronic health conditions, and emo-
tional distress symptoms in adult survivors of childhood
cancer. In non-cancer populations, cardiac conditions in-
cluding angina, myocardial infarction, and diabetes have
been found to be associated with anxiety.13 Diabetes and
pulmonary disease have been associated with depression,14
with > 40% of individuals with chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease reporting symptoms of depression.15-17 In
this context, we sought to examine potential associations
between chronic health conditions and emotional distress
symptoms in adult survivors of childhood cancer while ac-
counting for established associations between therapeutic
exposures and chronic health morbidities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The CCSS is a multi-institutional, retrospective cohort
study with longitudinal follow-up of survivors of child-
hood cancer recruited from 26 institutions across North
America. The Institutional Review Board at each partici-
pating institution approved the CCSS protocol, and all
participants provided informed consent. Participants in
CCSS include those who: 1) were diagnosed with child-
hood cancer before age 21 years between January 1, 1970
and December 31, 1986; and 2) survived at least 5 years
after diagnosis. The baseline survey began in 1994, and
subsequent follow-up surveys are conducted every 4 to 5
years. A detailed description of the cohort methodology
and study design have been previously reported.18,19 For
the current analysis, eligibility required that participants
self-completed all questionnaires and were at least aged 18
years at the time of Follow-up 2. Survivors were excluded
from the study if they reported a neurodevelopmental
condition (ie, mental retardation in 252 individuals
[2.7%]). Because stroke is coded as a cardiac condition in
the fourth version of the National Cancer Institute Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, partici-
pants reporting these events were excluded to ensure that
cardiac morbidity consisted of cardiovascular events and
not the neurologic consequences of those events (160 par-
ticipants [1.7%]). Survivors with missing data regarding
treatment (263 participants [2.8%]), chronic disease
(1157 participants [12.4%]), or emotional distress (2432
participants [26.1%]) also were not evaluable. Of the eli-
gible 8873 survivors, 5021 were included in the current
analyses, with a participation rate of 57% (Fig. 1). Com-
pared with nonevaluable participants, participants in the
current study were more likely to be female (53.9% vs
43.1%) (see Supporting Information Table 1).
Treatment Exposures
Treatment data were obtained from medical records by
trained abstractors. Treatment exposures previously associ-
ated with chronic health conditions were selected a priori
for inclusion in path analysis models. To uphold the integ-
rity of our statistical modeling, cumulative treatment doses
were used when at least 20% of the sample received a spe-
cific treatment, and were coded as absent or present other-
wise. Therefore, cumulative doses of cranial RT (CRT),
thoracic RT, anthracyclines, and intravenous methotrexate
(measured as the cumulative dose within the first 5 years
of treatment) were coded as continuous variables. Intrathe-
cal chemotherapy was measured as the number of metho-
trexate or cytarabine injections, and bleomycin and
corticosteroids were coded as absent or present.
Chronic Health Conditions
Survivors self-reported chronic health conditions, includ-
ing the date of onset of each condition, at baseline and at
subsequent follow-up assessments (Follow-up 1, Follow-
up 4). Only chronic health conditions with a date of onset
before the date of assessment of emotional distress symp-
toms (Follow-up 2) were included in the analysis. Any
chronic health conditions reported at Follow-up 4 with a
date of onset occurring after the report of emotional dis-
tress symptoms at Follow-up 2 were not included in the
current analysis. Consequently, the reported date of onset
of chronic health conditions preceded the ascertainment
of emotional distress symptoms. The severity of cardiac,
endocrine, and pulmonary conditions were graded for se-
verity using the National Cancer Institute Common Ter-
minology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03),20
using the maximum grade per reported chronic condition
for each organ system. Consistent with past CCSS
reports,4,5 the following grading schema was used: mild
(grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe or disabling (grade
3), or life-threatening (grade 4).
Distress Outcomes
Acute symptoms of depression and anxiety (eg, occurring
within the past 7 days) were assessed using the Brief
Symptom Inventory 18.21 Using sex-specific normative
data, elevated distress was defined as a T-score � 63

 (highest 10% of the normative population). Posttraumat-
ic stress symptoms (PTSS) were assessed using the Post-
traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, a 17-item measure of
diagnostic symptoms criteria from the Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition.22 A posi-
tive endorsement of PTSS was defined as at least 1
reexperiencing symptom, at least 3 avoidance symptoms,
and at least 2 arousal symptoms.23,24 All emotional dis-
tress outcomes were assessed at Follow-up 2.
Statistical Analyses
The prevalence of distress symptoms among survivors
with and without chronic health conditions was compared
using chi-square tests. Path analysis, a type of structural
equation modeling, was used to examine the relations
among treatment exposures, chronic conditions, and
emotional distress outcomes. For each outcome, the anal-
ysis began with an a priori hypothesized path model (see
Supporting Information Fig. 1), with main effects and in-
teraction terms selected based on existing evidence in the
literature.9,25-30 The model was expanded by adding clini-
cally meaningful paths 1 at a time with a modification in-
dex of �3.6, beginning with the largest index value. The
path model was then reduced by removing paths 1 at a
time if the absolute value of the standardized coefficient
was <0.05 or the path lacked substantive meaning, begin-
ning with the smallest coefficient. Further model reduc-
tion was conducted if the path had a P value > .05 or was
not substantively significant, beginning with the largest P
value. This process was iterative until the following
model-fitting criteria were met: the comparative fit index
and the Tucker-Lewis index was > 0.95, and the root
mean square error of approximation fell to <0.05.31 To
examine the magnitude of associations between chronic
health conditions and emotional distress, log-binomial
multivariable regression was used to estimate the relative
risk (RR) and 95% CI. Exposures included in multivari-
able models were restricted to significant direct effects of
treatment and chronic health conditions identified in our
final path models. The path analysis was conducted using
Mplus statistical software, and multivariable regression
modeling was conducted using SAS statistical software
(version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Survivors were a mean of 8.3 years of age (standard devia-
tion [SD], 5.9 years) at the time of diagnosis, 24.3 years of
age (SD, 7.8 years) at baseline, and 32 years of age (SD,

 7.6 years) at the time of Follow-up 2 (Table 1). Approxi-
mately two-thirds of the sample received some form of
RT (65.0%), with nearly one-third having received CRT
(29.0%), and 80% having received chemotherapy.
Prevalence of Chronic Health Conditions and
Emotional Distress Symptoms
Approximately 25% of survivors reported having at least 1
cardiac condition (any grade 1-4), 27% reported an endo-
crine condition, and 17% reported a pulmonary condition
(see Supporting Information Tables 2 and 3). The preva-
lence of elevated distress symptoms was found to be higher
among survivors with chronic health conditions compared
with those without (Table 2). For example, a greater per-
centage of survivors with endocrine conditions reported
symptoms of depression (13.1% vs 9.8%; P<.001), anxi-
ety (8.0% vs 6.4%; P<.001), and posttraumatic stress
(20.9% vs 14.4%; P<.001) compared with survivors
without endocrine conditions. The prevalence of emotion-
al distress symptoms by primary childhood cancer diagno-
sis is shown in Supporting Information Table 4.
Pathways From Treatment Exposures to
Emotional Distress
Depressive symptoms
Positive interaction effects for a higher dose of CRT and a
shorter duration of time since diagnosis (P<.001), a higher
dose of CRT and a younger age at diagnosis (P<.001),
and a higher dose of CRT and male sex (P 5 .027) were
found to be associated with a greater likelihood of endo-
crine conditions. A main effect of higher-dose thoracic RT
was found to be associated with endocrine morbidity
(P< .001). Bleomycin exposure (P5 .004), a higher dose
of thoracic RT (P<.001), female sex (P5 .001), younger
age at diagnosis (P5 .004), and a shorter duration of time
since diagnosis (P5 .001) were associated with pulmonary
conditions. The presence of endocrine (P5 .001) and car-
diac (P<.001) conditions also contributed to pulmonary
disease. Significant direct determinants of depressive symp-
toms included male sex (b 5 -0.08 [P5 .007]) and grade
1 through 4 endocrine (b 5 .12 [P5 .002]) and pulmo-
nary (b 5 .13 [P<.001]) conditions (Fig. 2) (Table 3).
Anxiety symptoms
A higher dose of thoracic RT, older age at diagnosis, a lon-
ger duration of time since diagnosis, and endocrine condi-
tions were found to have direct effects on cardiovascular
disease (all P < .001). Bleomycin exposure (P 5 .003),
younger age at diagnosis (P 5 .003), a shorter duration of
time since diagnosis (P 5 .002), female sex (P 5 .002),
and endocrine (P 5 .001) and cardiac (P<.001) condi-
tions were found to have direct effects on pulmonary mor-
bidity. While accounting for the associations between
treatment exposures and chronic health conditions, car-
diovascular (b 5 .13 [P 5 .001]) and pulmonary (b 5 .15
[P<.001]) conditions were the direct observed determi-
nants of anxiety symptoms.
Posttraumatic stress symptoms

 morbidity were found to be directly associated with cardi-
ac conditions (all P < .001). Female sex and interactions
between a higher dose of CRT and younger age at diagno-
sis and a higher dose of CRT and a shorter duration of
time since diagnosis were associated with endocrine con-
ditions (all P < .001). Bleomycin exposure (P 5 .001), a
higher dose of thoracic RT (P<.001), female sex
(P<.001), younger age at diagnosis (P 5 .005), and a
shorter duration of time since diagnosis (P 5 .002) were
found to be associated with pulmonary conditions. Endo-
crine (P 5 .001) and cardiac (P<.001) conditions also
contributed to pulmonary disease. PTSS were found to be
directly influenced by all examined chronic health condi-
tions (cardiovascular: b 5 .09 [P 5 .004]; endocrine:
b 5 .12 [P<.001]; and pulmonary: b 5 .13 [P<.001]).
Magnitude of Risk
In multivariable models restricted to significant direct
exposures derived from our path analyses, endocrine and
pulmonary conditions increased the risk of depressive
symptoms by 30% to 40% (RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]
and RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7], respectively) (Table 4).
Pulmonary conditions were found to be associated with a
60% increased risk of anxiety (RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-
2.0]) and cardiac conditions with a 50% increased risk of
anxiety (RR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]). Similarly, cardiac
(RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]), pulmonary (RR, 1.4 [95%
CI, 1.2-1.6]), and endocrine (RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5])
conditions were associated with a 30% to 40% increased
risk of PTSS.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, although associations be-
tween a primary childhood cancer diagnosis and treat-
ment and risk of emotional distress have been well
described, the impact of chronic health conditions, which
are becoming increasingly prevalent as survivors age
through middle adulthood, has not been previously con-
sidered. The objective of the current analysis was to iden-
tify pathways from childhood cancer treatment and
subsequent chronic health conditions to emotional dis-
tress in adulthood. The results demonstrated that survi-
vors who develop cardiovascular, endocrine, and/or
pulmonary conditions resulting from cancer-directed
therapies in childhood are at risk of developing symptoms
of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These
findings demonstrated the cumulative health effects of
childhood cancer over the course of one’s lifespan, and
underscore the importance of long-term follow-up and
screening for physical and mental health morbidities.
Among survivors of pediatric malignancies, it is
well-established that specific treatment exposures in child-
hood are associated with late health morbidities. Consis-
tent with this literature, the current study results
illustrated the cardiotoxic effects of chest-directed RT and
anthracycline exposure,32,33 and the deleterious effects of
CRT on pituitary and endocrine function.34 Similarly, as
expected, an interaction between a higher CRT dose and
younger age at diagnosis conferred a greater risk of endo-
crine conditions.35 Although we observed an interaction
between a higher CRT dose and years since diagnosis, the
risk of endocrine conditions decreased with time. For ex-
ample, in our depression model, at 15 years after diagno-
sis, the risk of endocrine conditions increased by 54% for
every 10-gray increase in CRT. However, by 35 years after
diagnosis, this risk was only 21%. This suggests that as
follow-up time increased, the strength of the association
between CRT dose and endocrine conditions decreased,
although the association remained positive.
Important new findings from the current analysis in-
cluded the identification of several direct effects between
late chronic health conditions and emotional distress
among cancer survivors. A direct path was observed be-
tween pulmonary morbidity and depressive symptoms,
with a 40% increased risk of depressive symptoms noted
among survivors with pulmonary conditions. This is simi-
lar to research in the general population documenting an
association between emphysema and chronic bronchitis

 survivors in the current study) and depressed mood.12-14
Similarly, the observed effect of endocrine dysfunction on
depression is consistent with research in the general popu-
lation linking thyroid dysfunction and growth hormone
deficiencies with the risk of depression.36,37
Both cardiac and pulmonary conditions were associ-
ated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (50% and
60% increased risk, respectively). Epidemiologic evidence
in the general population supports an association between
cardiac disease and anxiety, by way of health behaviors, in-
creased hypertension, or the triggering of fatal coronary
events.13 In addition, anxiety has been identified as a risk
factor for exacerbations and hospitalizations in cohort
studies of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.38,39 It is interesting to note that pulmonary mor-
bidity was the largest determinant of both anxiety and
PTSS, which may reflect a shared underlying mechanism
given that posttraumatic stress disorder is classified as an
anxiety disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 4th edition.22
Although the results of the current study offer valu-
able new insights into potential sources of emotional dis-
tress symptoms in adult survivors of childhood cancer,
they should be considered within the context of several
limitations. First, chronic health conditions in the current
report were assessed by self-report, which may be less sen-
sitive than direct assessment and subsequently result in
the misclassification of chronic health status.6 Second, we
were unable to establish temporality between chronic
health conditions and emotional distress. Although the
date of onset of survivors’ reported chronic health condi-
tions preceded the 7-day window of reported emotional
distress symptoms, we did not have information regarding
the date of onset of emotional distress symptoms. In addi-
tion, survivors may have inaccurately reported the date of
onset of their health conditions, and therefore we cannot
eliminate the possibility that emotional distress symptoms
preceded and/or contributed to the development of
chronic health conditions. Longitudinal studies may
strengthen this evidence base by establishing temporal or-
dering of chronic health conditions and emotional distress
symptoms. Finally, observed effects between specific
health conditions and emotional distress outcomes may
partially reflect shared symptoms. For example, survivors
reporting endocrine dysfunction may be more likely to ex-
perience fatigue or low energy, which also is a symptom of
depression. Reliance on self-report data for both expo-
sures (chronic health conditions) and outcomes (distress
symptoms) introduces the potential for bias from com-
mon method variance.
The results of the current study suggest that chronic
health conditions that develop decades after the treatment
of childhood cancer are associated with emotional distress
symptoms in aging adult survivors. These findings pro-
vide support for the routine psychological screening of
adult survivors with chronic health conditions. Current
long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood
cancer recommend screening based on specific therapeutic
exposures.40 The results of the current study suggest that
in adulthood, chronic health conditions may serve as a
more proximal and reliable indicator of survivors who are
in need of psychological screening than treatments re-
ceived several decades earlier. Alternatively, survivors who
received more intensive cancer-directed therapies may be
at risk of both chronic health conditions and psychologi-
cal distress. Ultimately, treatment for distress symptoms
will likely involve evidence-based interventions such as
cognitive behavioral therapy or pharmacotherapy regard-
less of etiology. However, screening an at-risk population
may facilitate the early identification of distress symptoms
and timely intervention before symptoms become chronic
and functionally impairing. The current study findings

 also support a prophylactic approach to the prevention of
emotional distress symptoms. Specifically, risk-based
screening to identify chronic health conditions is impor-
tant for this population,40 because the treatment (includ-
ing
medication
management)
of
physical
health
conditions may have the potential to offset emotional dis-
tress symptoms. However, it also is important to consider
that the presence of distress symptoms may adversely af-
fect self-management of chronic disease.41-43 Finally,
interventions such as physical exercise, with the ability to
intervene at multiple levels (eg, reducing both the risk of
chronic health conditions and symptoms of emotional
distress) are important to consider as direct and/or indi-
rect methods with which to improve overall psychological
functioning.
