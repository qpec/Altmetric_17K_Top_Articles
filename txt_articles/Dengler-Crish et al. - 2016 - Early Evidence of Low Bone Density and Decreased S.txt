Abstract. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and its clinical sequelae, osteoporosis, occur at a much greater rate in patients
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), often emerging early in the disease before significant cognitive decline is seen. Reduced
BMD translates to increased bone fracture risk, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality for AD patients. However,
the mechanism responsible for this observation is unclear. We hypothesize that bone loss is an additional component of an
AD prodrome-changes that emerge prior to dementia and are mediated by dysfunction of the central serotonergic pathways.
We characterized the skeletal phenotype of htau mice that express human forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau that
become pathologically hyperphosphorylated in AD. Using radiographic densitometry, we measured BMD in female and male
htau mice from 2–6 months of age–time-points prior to the presence of significant tauopathy in the hippocampal/entorhinal
regions characteristic of this model. We found a significantly reduced BMD phenotype in htau mice that was most pronounced
in males. Using western blotting and immunofluorescence, we showed overall reduced tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) protein
in htau brainstem and a 70% reduction in TPH-positive cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)–a pivotal structure in the
regulation of the adult skeleton. Elevations of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) proteins were also measured in brainstem, and
co-labeled immunofluorescence studies showed presence of ptau in TPH-positive cells of the DRN as early as 4 months of age
in htau mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that reduced BMD occurs earlier than overt degeneration in a tau-based
AD model and that pathological changes in tau phosphorylation occur in the serotonin-producing neurons of the brainstem
raphe in these mice. This illuminates a need to define a mechanistic relationship between bone loss and serotonergic deficits
in early AD.

symptoms may result from disrupted homeostasis
due to neurotransmitter dysregulation [1–3]. Depres-
sion, mood swings, agitation, sleep difficulties,
appetite issues, and weight loss are recognized as
prodromal symptoms of AD that occur several years
before cognitive impairment is manifested, and all
are linked to serotonergic dysfunction [4, 5]. Further-

increased fracture risk are significant clinical comor-
bidities in AD that may also be linked to serotonin
dysfunction [6–9]. Contrary to assumptions that
skeletal problems result from the advanced disease
state of AD, bone loss is reported very early in the
progression of AD when cognitive decline is minimal
and mobility has not yet been compromised [10–12].
In fact, comorbid bone deficits in AD have been
shown to be independent of age, body mass index,
physical activity [13, 14], and cognitive state [15].
Thus, it has been hypothesized that bone integrity
may represent a component of a prodromal state of
AD occurring years before evidence of dementia [14,
16]. Of added interest, an increasing number of stud-
ies are addressing the role of triggering receptor
expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in AD [17],
which is expressed in bone cells as well as the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS) [18], since mutations in
this immune modulator have been linked to several
conditions characterized by tauopathy and demen-
tia (including AD [19]) and are the genetic basis
for Nasu-Hakola disease which is characterized by
severe dementia and increased bone fragility [20].
Numerous peripheral factors can influence the
dynamic process of adult bone remodeling, but in
the last decade, a major CNS circuit involving the
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of the brainstem has
been shown to exert powerful regulation over skele-
tal homeostasis [21–24]. The DRN is a major source
of all brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT),
and serotonergic signaling between the DRN and
ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) promotes bone
formation in the adult skeleton [21, 22, 24, 25].
Despite common conceptions, bone is an active tissue
with significant turnover. Optimal skeletal health is
maintained by constant remodeling where bone for-
mation and resorption processes are balanced–when
that balance is skewed, excessive formation or loss
can deleteriously affect the skeleton. Deficits in
serotonergic signaling have been shown to cause sig-
nificant bone loss in experimental animal models [21]
as well as in human conditions [26]. Numerous stud-
ies have demonstrated pathological changes in the
raphe nuclei early in AD [27, 28], and the emer-
gence of these pathologies has been shown to precede
the earliest changes in the entorhinal cortex–the
area where AD staging systems classically indicate
first appearance of neurofibrillary tangles [5, 28,
29]. Furthermore, transgenic mice that overexpress
amyloid-� (A�) exhibit an osteoporotic phenotype
early in life [30–33]. However, it is unclear how or
where A� has its effect, as it has also been identified
in bones of AD patients and has been shown to
exert direct, deleterious effects on this tissue in the
periphery [34]. Despite these initial findings on the
association between AD, 5-HT, and reduced BMD,
this topic remains largely uninvestigated.
As research in this field shifts focus toward iden-
tifying new risk-factors, biomarkers, and targets for
intervention, evaluating the role of the DRN in AD
may provide valuable information for all three of
these subjects. Early dysfunction in serotonergic sig-
naling arising from this structure could provide an
etiological mechanism for bone loss in AD and poten-
tially implicate low BMD as another symptom in the
clinical prodrome of this disorder. One way to inves-
tigate this is by assessing the relationship between
bone loss and the second major protein implicated
in AD pathology: the microtubule associated protein
tau (MAPT). MAPT is primarily expressed in the
nervous system and has not been identified in bone
tissue, therefore, low BMD in a tauopathy-specific
mouse model that lacks A� pathology would provide
evidence that central mechanisms of bone homeosta-
sis are dysfunctional in AD, rather than only direct
peripheral effects on bone tissue itself. Here, we
present the first demonstration of an early, low BMD
phenotype in a tauopathy-specific AD model, the
htau mouse, and show evidence that this phenotype
is associated with decreased markers of serotonin
synthesis (i.e., the serotonin precursor enzyme tryp-
tophan hydroxylase; TPH) and early evidence of ptau
pathology in the DRN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Sixteen
htau

(B6.Cg-Mapt

Tg(MAPT)8cPdav/J strain (C57BL/6J background)
obtained from Jackson Laboratories (stock #005491)
were used in this study and were observed/measured
from 2 to 6 months of age. htau mice have a targeted
mutation of the endogenous mouse Mapt allele and
insertion of a human Mapt transgene driven by tau
promoter that results in the expression of all six iso-
forms of the mutant human microtubule associated
protein tau (MAPT) in the absence of endogenous
mouse MAPT [35]. htau mice show evidence of
somatodendritic accumulation of hyperphosphory-
lated tau in the hippocampus and cortex by 3 months
of age [35], with paired helical filament development
and evidence of cognitive/behavioral deficits by
6–9 months [35, 36]. Sixteen age-matched C57BL/6J

Fig. 1. Skeletal bone mineral density (BMD) is reduced in htau mice compared to controls and is influenced by sex differences. A) DEXA scan
of a mouse identifying regions of interest for which BMD was measured. Whole body tracing indicates the total skeletal region sampled in
whole-body measurements. Rectangles highlight two regions of interest, the lumbar spine and femur, for which specific BMD measurements
were also obtained. The oval surrounding the skull indicates that this area was excluded from analysis which is standard procedure in
whole body densitometry due to distortions produced by skull density. Scans were obtained using a Lunar PixiMUS bone densitometer and
associated Lunar software (GE Healthcare). B) Mean whole-body skeletal BMD of female htau (circle) mice is significantly lower than
female C57 (triangle) mice from 2–6 months of age (indicated by *). Skeletal BMD also differs between female htau and tau−/− (inverted
triangle) mice at 2, 3, and 5 months of age (indicated by #). Extrapolation points for 12 + months of age are the mean skeletal BMD of
a non-longitudinal sample of aged htau and C57 female mice (n = 3/per strain) that are plotted for reference. C) Whole body skeletal BMD
of male htau mice does not differ from controls at 2 months, but is significantly lower than C57 males beginning at 3 months and for the
duration of the study (indicated by *). Male htau BMD is also lower than male tau−/− BMD at 3, 4, and 6 months of age. Extrapolation
points for 12 + months of age are the mean skeletal BMD of a non-longitudinal sample of aged htau and C57 male mice (n = 2/per strain)
that are plotted for reference. For panels B&C, mean skeletal BMD values from 2–6 months were derived from 8 mice per genotype per sex
(total n = 48 mice). Error bars depict standard error of the mean. No statistical analyses were performed on 12 + month extrapolation samples
due to small n.
(C57) mice were used as the primary control groups;
an additional group of 16 age-matched “tau null”
(tau−/−) mice (littermates of the htau) that expressed
no endogenous mouse MAPT nor the human MAPT
transgene [36] were used for initial comparisons
to determine the specificity of bone effects to our
target model. Equal numbers of males and females
(n = 8 per sex for each strain/genotype) were used
to assess sex differences related to bone phenotype.
To compare the developmental trajectory of BMD
of these young mice with BMD of significantly
aged mice, we also utilized a separate convenience
sample of 12–14-month-old female and male C57
and htau (n = 5 per strain; 3 female, 2 male) for
single (non-longitudinal) BMD measurements. An
additional group of 4-5 month-old htau, tau−/−
and C57 mice (n = 2 per strain per sex) were used
for tissue harvesting to determine the presence of
ptau pathology in bone regulatory brain regions at
early ages. All strains of mice were obtained from
Jackson Laboratories and were housed in the same
room and conditions at the Northeast Ohio Medical
University
(NEOMED)
Comparative
Medicine
Unit. All procedures using mice were approved in
accordance with the NEOMED IACUC.
Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
Mice
received
monthly
BMD
scans
from
2–6 months of age using a Lunar PIXImus (GE
Healthcare) DEXA scanner for in vivo use with small
animals. DEXA is an accurate, high-throughput
radiographic method for evaluating bone mineral
density in live animals and can be employed in
a longitudinal design taking multiple measurements
of the same animal over time due to its low radiation
exposure [37]. Before each DEXA scan, mice were
weighed and anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane
via nose cone to provide immobilization for the
duration of the 5-min scan. Mice were placed on
the PIXImus scanner bed in the prone position, with
the limbs and tail stretched away from the body,
and scans were initiated using a cone beam X-ray
source generating beams at 35 and 80 keV at 0.5 mA.
After scans, animals were allowed to recover from
anesthesia and were returned to their home cages.
For the group of aged 12–14 month mice, scans
were only performed once, but for all other mice
in the study, one whole-body scan per animal was
performed monthly for the duration of the study.
PIXImus software (GE Healthcare/Lunar) was used
 1608
C.M. Dengler-Crish et al. / Low Bone Density in Htau Mice
to quantify whole body BMD (excluding the head;
see explanation in Fig. 1 legend) and percent body
fat. Targeted measurements of lumbar spine and
femur were also conducted to determine whether
different bone architectures (trabecular bone of the
vertebrae versus cortical bone of the femur) reflected
density differences as a function of experimental
condition [16, 38]. Figure 1A displays an example of
the DEXA output scan and measurements obtained
with this procedure.
Western blotting for TPH and ptau
After mice completed the longitudinal bone den-
sity study (6 months of age), representative groups
were euthanized by cervical dislocation under isoflu-
rane anesthesia and fresh brain tissue samples were
dissected and immediately frozen on dry ice and
stored at –80◦C until used. An additional cohort
of 4-month-old htau, tau−/−, and C57 control mice
(representing the age at which both female and
male htau mice exhibited pronounced differences in
skeletal phenotype) was also included for determi-
nation of ptau levels in the DRN. Tissue punches
through the midbrain containing the dorsal raphe
nucleus were placed on wet ice and 10 �l/ �g tis-
sue of ice-cold 1x RIPA buffer containing complete
protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and
phosphatase inhibitors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
was added. Tissue was homogenized via sonification
(20% amplitude for two, 2-s pulses) and centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4◦C. Total protein con-
centration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce,
Rockford, IL).
Simple Western capillary-based analyses for TPH
or ptau levels were performed using the Wes plat-
form (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA). Procedures
were performed according to manufacturer protocol.
Briefly, brain homogenate was diluted to 0.1 �g/ � l
in 0.1x sample buffer and a fluorescent master
mix (1 �l per 5 �l total volume) was added; the
sample solutions and ladder were then placed in
a thermocycler and heated to 95◦C for 5 min and
subsequently cooled to 4◦C. The samples, blocking
reagent, wash buffer, primary antibodies, secondary
antibodies, and chemiluminescent substrate were
dispensed into designated wells in the manufac-
turer provided microplate (ProteinSimple, PS-PP03).
After plate loading, immunodetection steps were
performed automatically with default instrument set-
tings for a 25-cartridge, 12–230 kDa, size-based
assay. Primary antibodies used were tryptophan
hydroxylase (TPH2; rabbit, Millipore, AB1543P,
1:500), phosphorylated tau-202 (AT8- correspond-
ing to phosphorylation at the serine 202 site; rabbit,
Cell Signaling, #11834S, 1:75), and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphatedehydrogenase(GAPDH;rabbit,Sigma,
G9545, 1:300) as the loading control. All antibodies
were diluted with antibody diluent 2 (ProteinSim-
ple, 042–195). Chemiluminescent signal obtained
from each capillary, pertaining to a specific sample,
was analyzed with Compass software (ProteinSimple
v2.5). Chemiluminescent signal was normalized and
reported as the ratio of the quantity of each protein of
interest divided by GAPDH [39, 40].
Immunofluorescence
Separate cohorts of 4- and 6-month-old mice
were euthanized with 120 mg/kg sodium pentobar-
bital (i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS. After post-fixation and cry-
oprotection, 50 �m coronal serial slices through the
entire rostro-caudal extent of the DRN were taken
using a freezing sliding microtome. Immunofluores-
cence assays were conducted as previously described
[41] with modifications based on Xu et al. [42] that
included performing the incubations at 37◦C. Briefly,
tissue was blocked in donkey serum for 30 min,
incubated in primary antibodies for 1 h, received
three 10-min washes in PBS, and was incubated in
secondary antibody for 30 min followed by three 10-
min washes in PBS. Tissue was mounted on slides
and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern
Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Primary antibodies were
used against the following: TPH (sheep polyclonal;
Millipore, #AB1541; 1:200) to label serotonergic
neurons in the brainstem raphe nuclei, phospho-tau
thr231 (AbFinity rabbit monoclonal; Life Technolo-
gies #701056; 1:400) with affinity for the 224–236
phosphorylation sites of human MAPT to label ptau
in the raphe, and NeuN (Millipore, #MAB377; 1:500)
as a general neuronal stain. Alexa Fluor-tagged sec-
ondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch; West
Grove, PA; 1:200) were used to visualize each
marker. Brain sections were photographed on an
Axio Imager M2 epifluorescence microscope with
a digital high-resolution camera (AxioCam MRm),
motorized stage, and an ApoTome-2 structured illu-
mination module (Zeiss; Jena, Germany). Raphe
nuclei were imaged under multiple channels to cap-
ture label from antibody staining. Multi-frame image
montages were used to capture the entire dorsal-
ventral extent of the region containing dorsal and

median raphe nuclei with high resolution. Mon-
taged tiles were stitched, z-stacked, flattened with
the extended depth of focus module of the Zen
microscope software, and converted to tiffs for anal-
ysis. Images from merged fluorescent channels were
used to visually confirm co-label between ptau-231
and TPH-positive cells. Using Image-Pro Premier
(Media Cybernetics; Rockville, MD), TPH-positive
cells were auto-quantified in the DRN and median
raphe nucleus (MRN) separately by thresholding sec-
tions and computing total cell counts for each region.
The MRN was used for comparison because it con-
tains serotonergic cell groups that do not project to
bone regulatory brain regions such as the VMH and
has not been implicated in central bone regulation.
Co-label between ptau and TPH was assessed in the
merged images of each fluorescent channel. DRN
was also imaged on a Leica TCS SPE laser-scanning
confocal microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany).
Optical sections were reconstructed into 3-D vol-
umes using the Leica Application Suite X software.
Orthogonal representations were examined to con-
firm co-localization of ptau and TPH.
Statistical analysis
Statistical models were built and conducted sep-
arately for each sex as male mice are heavier and
have larger skeletons ([16]; current data), and our
target observations were between genotypes. We
used multivariate analyses of variances (MANOVAs)
to analyze differences between genotypes (htau,
tau−/−, and C57) at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-month obser-
vation periods for each dependent variable measured
(i.e., whole skeleton BMD, lumbar BMD, femur
BMD, body weight). The MANOVA approach was
selected as an alternative to a repeated measures
design because these tests enabled us to directly
contrast BMD measurements from htau mice with
controls at each of the monthly measurement peri-
ods, while compensating for any sphericity violations
in our data [43]. Significant main effects were
followed up with univariate analyses and simple con-
trasts. Effect sizes were calculated and reported for
each omnibus significant effect as partial eta2 (ηp2)
which describes the percent of variance in group
differences that can be accounted by the experi-
mental manipulation [43]. In analyses that revealed
significant weight differences between genotypes
(i.e., male htau and C57), weight was entered as
a covariate in a new MANCOVA (multivariate anal-
ysis of covariance) model to determine if body
mass accounted for differences in BMD. Additional
analyses examining percent body fat between geno-
types were conducted with one-way ANOVAs and
Bonferroni-adjustment post-hoc comparisons. Vari-
ables containing immunoblotting data and quantified
immunohistochemical markers were analyzed for
group differences with Student’s t-tests. For analy-
ses where histological and protein variables did not
differ between sexes, data were pooled across all mice
within each genotype to increase statistical power.
RESULTS
Whole body skeletal BMD
Results for analyses on whole body skeletal
BMD are illustrated in Fig. 1B and C. Our over-
all statistical model indicated that female htau
and C57 mice differed in whole body skeletal
BMD, F5,6 = 5.70, p = 0.03. This result had an
extremely large effect size accounting for 83% of
the variance between female htau and C57 BMD
(ηp2 = 0.826). Simple contrasts indicated that female
htau mice had significantly lower skeletal BMD
than female C57 mice at 2 months (F1,10 = 6.69,
p = 0.03), 3 months (F1,10 = 9.52, p = 0.01), 4 months
(F1,10 = 7.67, p = 0.02), 5 months (F1,10 = 30.59,
p < 0.01), and 6 months of age (F1,12 = 15.25,
p < 0.01) (See Fig. 1B). The age of smallest signif-
icant difference in BMD (3-mo) to the age of largest
difference (5-mo) represent ∼3–8% reductions in
BMD relative to C57 controls. Female htau mice
also had significantly lower skeletal densities than
female tau−/− mice (F5,5 = 5.68, p = 0.04), specifi-
cally at 2 months (F1,9 = 12.48, p < 0.01), 3 months
(F1,9 = 12.90, p < 0.01), and 5 months (F1,9 = 6.70,
p < 0.05). Overall, these effects accounted for 85%
of the variance between groups (ηp2 = 0.85).
Differences in skeletal BMD between genotype
of male mice were also supported by our overall
MANOVA model (F5,6 = 9.980, p < 0.01), account-
ing for over 89% of the variance in BMD between
the two strains (ηp2 = 0.893), but presented a differ-
ent pattern of results than was observed for female
mice. Male htau skeletal BMD did not differ from
C57 or tau−/− control BMD at the initial 2-month
measurement (C57: p = 0.286, ns; tau−/−: p = 0.07,
ns), but male htau mice exhibited significantly lower
BMD than C57 mice at every subsequent measure-
ment point from 3–6 months (htau versus C57:3 mo
F1,10 = 9.73; 4 mo F = 27.22; 5-mo F = 27.61; 6-mo

skeletal bone mineral density (BMD) measurements for C57 and htau mice across representative ages. Female whole body BMD data are
depicted with dots; male data are depicted with inverted triangles; n = 8/gender/genotype. Top panel: At 2-months of age, half of female
htau BMDs are sufficiently low enough to fall with an osteoporotic range (blue shaded bar area) whereas only 1 male htau case meets this
criterion. Middle panel: By 4 months of age, fewer female htau BMDs meet osteoporotic criteria, but the majority of male htau BMD values
fall within this osteoporotic range. Bottom panel: By 6 months of age, all male htau BMDs are sufficiently low enough to fall within the
osteoporotic range. The majority of female htau mice also meet these criteria. Group means for each genotype within each gender are shown
with a black bar. Osteoporotic range was defined as BMD values that were more than two standard deviations below the average BMD of
C57 mice at each respective time point for each sex. B) Body weight and composition for htau and C57 mice. Top: Mean body weight does
not differ between htau and C57 females at any age of the study. Bottom: Male htau mice weigh significantly less than male C57 mice from
2–5 months of age. C) Top: Percent body fat increases from the beginning to end of the 4-month study at the same rates for both htau (lighter
bar) and C57 (darker bar) females. Bottom: Both male htau (lighter bar) and C57 (darker bar) might experience increases in percent body
fat over the duration of the 4-month study, but male htau mice fail to gain as much body fat as controls by the end of the observation period
and display significantly decreased body fat composition compared to C57 males. Asterisks indicate statistical significance of p < 0.05. Error
bars on all figures represent standard error of the mean.

F = 34.80; all p values were < 0.01). Male htau mice
had significantly lower skeletal densities than male
tau−/− mice (F5,5 = 12.75, p < 0.01), and these differ-
ences were evident from 3–6 months with exception
at the 5-month time point (Fig. 1C; 3 mo F1,9 = 47.44,
p < 0.01; 4 mo F1,9 = 18.99, p < 0.01; 5-mo p = 0.464,
ns; 6-mo F1,9 = 7.20, p < 0.05). In male htau mice, the
age of smallest significant difference in BMD (4-mo)
to the age of largest difference (5-mo) represent 5–9%
reductions in BMD relative to C57 controls. Effect
size determinations were extremely large, account-
ing for over 92% of the variance between htau and
tau−/− BMD (ηp2 = 0.924).
Skeletal BMD of C57 mice and tau−/− control
mice did not differ at any age for either sex, indicat-
ing that low bone mass phenotypes seen in htau mice
are likely attributable to the expression of human tau
isoforms, as tau−/− mice do not have either mouse or
human MAPT. In light of this finding and the fact that
tau−/− mice may exhibit unrelated deficits resulting
fromoveralllackofMAPT[36],furtheranalysesonly
report contrasts between htau and C57 data.

in Fig. 1B and C. Statistical analyses on this data were
not computed due to the small size of this conve-
nience sample of aged mice, but we observed that
mean skeletal BMD of all 12–14 month-old mice
was decreased with respect to 6-month levels. This
was anticipated as a natural function of aging; how-
ever, the extent of this bone loss was far greater in
htau mice. Aged female and male C57 mice experi-
enced 1.2–1.8% decreases (respectively) in skeletal
BMD, whereas BMD losses of 2.8% were computed
for female htau mice and 6.5% losses were shown
in male htau. This finding is suggestive of greater
severity of the skeletal phenotype in male htau mice.
Magnitude of low BMD phenotype in htau mice
Individual skeletal BMD measurements for htau
and C57 mice are depicted in Fig. 2A at the repre-
sentative ages of 2, 4, and 6 months. The distribution
of individual measurements was examined to deter-
mine the magnitude of BMD reduction in htau mice to
evaluate whether these effects were inconsequential
phenotypic differences or whether they represented
a clinically-significant deficit similar to osteoporo-
sis. Criteria for categorizing BMD measurements as
“osteoporotic” in the current study were based on the
World Health Organization’s established definition
of osteoporosis: BMD that is two standard deviations
below the mean peak bone mass of healthy controls
[44]. Age-related specificity was applied to these cri-
teria in the current study in that values were computed
independently for three benchmark ages: 2, 4, and
6 months by determining the mean and standard devi-
ation of BMD scores from age and sex-matched C57
mice, and then subtracting two standard deviations
from this value. The resulting difference was then
used as the threshold value for an osteoporotic mea-
surement. Thresholds and individual measurements
are illustrated in Fig. 2A.
At 2 months of age, many female htau BMD mea-
surements fell into the osteoporotic range, whereas
only one male htau BMD measurement could be

protein levels in brainstem of 6-month-old htau and C57 mice as measured by Simple Western. TPH protein levels in brainstem of htau
mice are significantly reduced from C57 control levels (p < 0.05). There were no differences in TPH protein levels between sexes, so data
were pooled across sex within each genotype for analysis (n = 6/genotype). Bar graph depicts quantified chemiluminescence of TPH as
normalized to the loading control GAPDH; error bars show standard error of the mean. Blot data are shown below the bar graph for female
(♀) and male (♂) of each genotype for TPH as compared to loading control (GAPDH). B) ptau (ser202) levels in brainstem of 4-month-old
htau, C57, and tau−/− mice. ptau levels are significantly elevated in htau mice compared to controls (p < 0.05). Female htau mice exhibit
significantly more ptau in brainstem nuclei than their male counterparts (p < 0.05). Measurements of ptau-202 in tau−/− samples were
negligible and served as a negative control–sex differences were not assessed in this strain due to these levels. C) Bar graph: Quantification
of TPH+ cells in the brainstem raphe show a significant decrease in TPH+ cells in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of 6-month-old htau mice

placed into this category. However, by 4 months
of age, the majority of male htau BMD values fell
within the osteoporotic range (along with the aggre-
gated mean BMD of these animals). Only two female
htau BMD measurements were categorized as osteo-
porotic at 4 months. By 6 months of age, all male htau
BMD measurements and the majority of female htau
BMDs could be categorized as osteoporotic. These
findings indicate that while both female and male
htau mice exhibited significantly lower BMD than

controls, there were sex-based differences in how the
magnitude of these deficits progressed, underscoring
male htau vulnerability again.
BMD at individual bone compartments
BMD from two specific bone sites, femur and
lumbar spine, were assessed for sensitivity in demon-
strating group differences indicated by the whole
skeletal BMD analyses. Femoral BMD did not dif-
fer between female htau and control mice (p > 0.05 in
all cases, ns). Male htau mice had less dense femurs
than C57 males at 4 (F2,21 = 10.11; p < 0.01) and 6
month measurements (F2,21 = 21.20, p < 0.01). Lum-
bar spine density reflected more consistent changes as
a function of genotype. Among females, lumbar spine
BMD was significantly lower in htau compared to
C57 mice at 4 months of age (F2,12 = 6.26, p < 0.01),
and although not statistically significant, this pattern
of lower spine density in htau mice was exhibited at
all other ages as well. Among males, lumbar spine
density was significantly lower in htau mice com-
pared to controls at 2 (F2,21 = 7.70), 3 (F2,21 = 16.12),
and 6 (F2,21 = 27.79; p < 0.01 in all cases) months of
age. Descriptive statistics for femur and lumbar spine
densities are reported in Table 1.
Body weight
Female htau and C57 mice did not differ in
body weight at any of the ages observed in the
study (p = 0.115, ns), although C57 weights were
observed to diverge from htau at 6 months of age
(Fig. 2B). Male htau mice had significantly lower
body mass than C57 males over the course of the
study (F5,8 = 5.40, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.771). This differ-
ence was evident at 2 months of age (F1,12 = 6.57,
p < 0.05)–before any significant differences in BMD
were shown between htau and controls (refer back
to Fig. 1B), as well as at 3 months (F1,12 = 24.69,
p < 0.01), 4 months (F1,12 = 18.82, p < 0.01), and
5 months (F1,12 = 28.13, p < 0.01), but not at 6 months
(p = 0.553, ns). To determine whether body mass
was influencing differences in skeletal BMD between
male htau and C57 mice, skeletal BMD analyses
were re-run using body weight as a covariate. MAN-
COVA results indicated that weight was no significant
covariate in this model, therefore, differences in body

mass did not account for genotype-related differences
in total skeletal BMD between male htau and C57
mice. Results for body mass are presented in Fig. 2B.
Body composition: Percent fat
All groups of mice began the study with similar
body fat composition, and each group increased their
percent body fat over the duration of the 4-month
observation period (Fig. 2C). In females, percent
body fat did not differ between htau and C57 mice
at any observed age (p = 0.125, ns). However, male
htau mice had significantly lower percent body fat
than C57 males by the end of the study (F1,9 = 7.16,
p < 0.05), suggesting a diminished rate of fat acquisi-
tion in this group of animals. Results are depicted in
Fig. 2C.
Protein quantification of tryptophan hydroxylase
and ptau in brainstem
Protein expression levels of TPH in brainstem
samples of 6-month-old mice did not differ as a func-
tion of sex in either strain of mice (C57: t4 = 1.18,
p = 0.87, ns; htau: t = 0.47, p = 0.66, ns), consistent
with previous reports showing a lack of sex-based
differences in rodent brainstem TPH expression [45].
When data were collapsed across sex for between
genotype analyses, brainstem TPH levels were sig-
nificantly lower in htau mice compared to C57 mice
(t10 = 2.29, p < 0.05), representing a 23.8% reduction.
These results are depicted in Fig. 3A.
To determine whether brain pathology was present
in htau mice at the young ages that coincided with
the emergence of a stable reduced BMD phenotype
(4 months), we measured ptau-202 protein levels
in brainstem raphe samples in all groups of mice
(data are presented in Fig. 3B). Levels of ptau-202
were significantly higher in htau mouse samples
compared to C57 (t6 = 3.753, p < 0.01) and tau−/−
mice (t4 = 2.953, p < 0.05; readings were negligible
in tau−/− as anticipated). Interestingly, when analyz-
ing sex differences within genotype, ptau-202 levels
were significantly higher in htau females compared
to their males (t2 = 77.571, p < 0.001), while no sex
differences were observed in C57 mice (t2 = 0.886,
ns). Sex differences were not analyzed in the tau−/−
strain because ptau values were already near the low-
est limits of detection.
Immunohistochemistry
To analyze regional differences of serotoner-
gic neurons in raphe nuclei, immunofluorescence
was used to label TPH-positive cells in rostral
serotonergic cell groups of the DRN and MRN
(Fig. 3C) of 6-month-old mice. Sections containing
both DRN and MRN were selected from where the
decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle was
prominent and provided a landmark separating DRN
from MRN [46]; Fig. 3C, bottom) and TPH-positive
cell counts were compared by sex and genotype.
While no significant sex differences in TPH-positive
cell number were seen in either DRN (p = 0.318, ns)
or MRN (p = 0.891, ns), both female C57 and htau
mice appeared to trend towards slightly higher num-
bers (Fig. 3C, top). In data pooled across sex, htau
mice had a 70.8% reduction in TPH-positive cells
in the DRN compared to C57 mice (F1,10 = 23.13,
p < 0.001; Fig. 3C, top). TPH-positive cell quantity
did not differ in the MRN as function of genotype
(p = 0.14, ns).
Confirming the protein results showing increased
ptau levels in the DRN of 4-month-old htau mice,
we demonstrated co-labeling of ptau-231 and TPH
immunofluorescence in DRN cells of both female and
male htau mice (Figs. 4, 5). As anticipated, stain-
ing for ptau was minimal in C57 and negligible in
tau−/− controls despite robust TPH signal in both
(Fig. 4, columns 1–3). When examining the MRN,
there was weak ptau signal in htau mice but to a far
lesser degree than was seen in the DRN, and ptau did
not co-label with TPH cells consistently in the MRN
(Fig. 4, column 4). Single confocal optical sections
and orthogonal views of reconstructed 3-D volumes
confirmed ptau localization in the somatodendritic
compartment of TPH-positive cells (Fig. 5). Control
optical sections from C57 and tau−/− DRN did not
contain appreciable ptau immunoreactivity in TPH-
positive or surrounding cells.

C.M. Dengler-Crish et al. / Low Bone Density in Htau Mice
DISCUSSION
Low BMD and osteoporosis are clinical comor-
bidities of AD that are shown early in the progression
of the disease and may even serve as predictive risk
factors in some populations [16]. Here, we demon-
strate evidence of an early low BMD phenotype
in the htau mouse model of tauopathy that coin-
cides with markers of incipient brain pathological
changes–somatodendritic ptau–in bone regulatory
brain regions. Our longitudinal bone density data
show that BMD was reduced relative to age and sex-
matched control mice early in the lifespan of htau
mice (3 months of age), and was sustained through
6 months of age. Additionally, BMD assessed in
a non-longitudinal cohort of 12–14-month-old mice
showed that age-related bone loss was greater in htau
mice–shown most severely in males of this strain.
Similar studies have characterized skeletal pheno-
type in AD model mice with the Swedish APP
gene mutation that produces A�-overexpression, and
these reported that low BMD emerged in APP-
swe mice at 2 months [31] and in APP/PS1 mice
at 9 months of age [30]. In the current study,
htau BMD was reduced by approximately 3–9% of
controls–comparable to estimated reductions in bone
density/volume (5–11%) of APP/PS1 mice [30].
The majority of mice used in this study were young
animals in the anabolic phases of skeletal growth as
indicated by increasing linear trajectories in BMD
from 2–6 months of age (illustrated in Fig. 1B, C),
therefore, we did not observe absolute bone loss
in these mice during this observation period, rather
failures in their ability to accrue peak BMD levels.
Failure to obtain peak bone density during growth
can also be explained by a similar shift in the bone
formation/resorption balance that contributes to the
overt loss of bone experienced by aged animals when
skeletal remodeling is dysregulated [47]. While the
current study did not determine whether the htau
skeleton was more fragile as a result of suboptimal
BMD, an association between compromised bone
health, microarchitectural defects, and low BMD was
reported in young APP/PS1 mice [30]. Additionally,
suboptimal BMD in young rodents has been asso-
ciated with osteoporotic fragility in other non-AD
model rodent strains [38, 44]. Furthermore, when
analyzing mice at ages where natural loss of bone
mineral occurs (12–14 months), we observed that
htau mice appeared to experience continued compro-
mise of their skeletal health, with greater bone loss
than controls from 6 to 12 + months of age.
Our findings also illustrate the dichotomy between
females and males in AD risk [48] but in a con-
trary way to what was anticipated. While both young
female and male htau mice had low BMD relative
to controls, this effect was exacerbated in males.
Interestingly, male htau mice began the study with
comparable BMD to controls, but failed to match the
peak bone density levels of C57 mice as time pro-
gressed, demonstrating what would be considered
uniformly osteoporotic BMD measurements by 6-
months of age. In the 12–14 month-old follow-up
cohort, aged male htau mice showed a greater per-
cent of bone loss after 6-months of age compared to
all other mice. Male htau mice also demonstrated sub-
optimal gains in body fat composition over the study,
suggestive of metabolic or energetic differences [49].
Postmenopausal women are disproportionately
affected by AD [48] and osteoporosis independent
from AD [50], as reductions in circulating estrogens
have been associated with increased vulnerability
to these diseases [51]. Estrogen is neuroprotective
against AD-related pathological changes [52–54] and
promotes formation and homeostasis of bone [30].
Young female htau mice used in this study were at
the peak age of reproductive activity, and it is possible
that their skeletons may have been afforded some (but
not total) protection by their high circulating estrogen
levels. This is interesting in light of our findings of
elevated brainstem ptau presence in female htau, yet
universally decreased TPH levels in both sexes. This
may suggest that estrogenic protection on bone may
have occurred independent of the central bone regu-
latory mechanism. However, the role of reproductive
steroidsonpathologicalchangesinhtaumiceremains
to be investigated.
Since htau mice do not accumulate A� as do other
AD transgenic models [35], and tau is an axonal
cytoskeletal protein specific to the CNS, evidence
of low BMD in this strain may be indicative of
neural pathology in brain structures regulating adult
bone homeostasis rather than pathology originating
from the periphery in bone tissue itself, as has been
reported in mouse models that overexpress A� [31,
32]. We showed increased presence of phosphory-
latedtau(atbothserine202andthreonine231sites)in
the DRN of 4-month-old htau mice that was directly
associated with serotonin-producing neurons in this
brain area. Evidence of selective dysfunction in the
central serotonergic system of htau mice was sup-
ported by decreased brainstem TPH protein levels
and a very large reduction in the number of TPH-
positive cells in DRN with no measurable changes in
 C.M. Dengler-Crish et al. / Low Bone Density in Htau Mice

MRN. This is an important distinction because the
MRN is a serotonergic region that does not project to
the ventromedial hypothalamus or participate in the
bone regulatory pathway [55, 56]. Additionally, the
remaining TPH+ cells in the htau DRN often exhib-
ited somatodendritic accumulations of ptau–a finding
that was also not ubiquitous in the MRN.
Depletion of serotonin has been indicated as an
early pathological change in both animal models of
AD and within the disease itself [28, 57]. Seroton-
ergic deficits induced by exposure to environmental
stressors have been shown to facilitate the formation
of AD pathology in rodent models by inducing APP
cleavage [58], tau misfolding and aggregation [59],
and tau hyperphosphorylation [60, 61]. Abnormal
increases in activity of the serotonergic 2C (5-HT2C)
receptor, a negative regulator of serotonin produc-
tion, induce tau phosphorylation in both AD and
non-disease mouse models [61], with additional stud-
ies showing that these effects can be ameliorated
through pharmacological manipulation that restored
serotonin function [62, 63]. 5-HT2C receptors play
a critical role in the central bone regulatory path-
way [21], and these findings linking 5-HTC2 receptor
dysfunction to decreased serotonin and increased
pathological markers of AD suggest that selective
manipulation of this receptor may be an intriguing
new tool for investigating the relationship between
serotonin deficiency and ptau pathogenesis.
Early therapeutic intervention in AD has been
posited as the best opportunity for slowing the neu-
rodegenerative process, and this strategy necessitates
finding early biomarkers of AD risk. In light of accu-
mulating evidence on skeletal changes in AD, bone
density screenings may provide a non-invasive, low-
cost method for assessing bone health that, when
considered along with classic risk factors and/or pro-
dromal symptoms of AD, could better help identify
patients at risk for developing dementia. Further stud-
ies are needed to assess the predictive utility of bone
loss in neurodegenerative disease and to investigate
mechanisms that define a specific, causal relationship
between low BMD, serotonin, and central pathology
in AD.
