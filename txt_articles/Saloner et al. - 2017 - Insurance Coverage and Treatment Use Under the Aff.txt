Affordable Care Act Among Adults With Mental and
Substance Use Disorders

Objective: Many adults who have mental or substance use
disorders or both experience insurance-related barriers to
care, contributing to low treatment utilization. Expanded in-
surance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could improve
coverage and access. The study identified changes in coverage
and treatment use following 2014 ACA insurance expansions.
Methods: Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and
Health were used to identify individuals ages 18–64 screen-
ing positive for any mental disorder (N=29,962) or substance
use disorder (N=19,243) for two periods: 2011–2013 and
2014. Regression-adjusted means were calculated for insur-
ance rates and treatment used in each period overall and
among individuals with household incomes #200% of the
federal poverty level (FPL).
Results: Compared with 2011–2013, in 2014 significant
reductions were seen in the uninsured rate for individuals
with mental disorders (25.4 percentage points, p,.01)
and substance use disorders (25.1 percentage points,
p,.01). Increases in insurance coverage occurred mostly
through Medicaid. Insurance gains were larger for adults
with incomes #200% of FPL compared with the overall
sample. Use of mental health treatment increased by 2.1
percentage points (p=.04), but use of substance use disorder
treatment did not change. No significant changes were noted
in treatment settings for mental and substance use disorder
treatments. Payment by Medicaid for substance use disor-
der treatment increased by 7.4 percentage points (p=.05).
Conclusions: Sizable increases in coverage for adults with
mental disorders and adults with substance use disorders
were identified in the year following the 2014 ACA expan-
sions; however, low treatment rates among this population
remain a concern. Initiatives to engage the newly insured in
treatment are needed.

Mental and substance use disorders affect 56 million adults
in the United States (1). In recent years, less than half of
individuals with mental disorders and one-tenth of those
with substance use disorders received any treatment (1).
Inability to access affordable treatment is one reason for
treatment underuse (2). The uninsured rate has long been
higher among individuals with mental and substance use
disorders than the general public (3,4). Many uninsured
individuals pay out of pocket or seek treatment from safety-
net providers. Among the insured, restrictive insurance cov-
erage and high cost-sharing have been barriers to receiving
care (5).
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is designed to reduce
uninsurance and barriers to care. Beginning in 2014, most
adults faced a new requirement to buy insurance. In addi-
tion, the ACA allocated new funding to expand Medicaid to
adults with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level.
In 2014, 25 states and the District of Columbia adopted ACA
Medicaid expansion (31 states and the District of Columbia
expanded by 2016) (6). State marketplaces selling federally
subsidized insurance were also implemented in 2014. Treat-
ments for mental and substance use disorders are essential
health benefits in marketplace plans (7). ACA-related Medic-
aid and private insurance plans are also subject to the federal
Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA),
which mandates mental health treatment coverage compa-
rable to medical-surgical treatments (7).
In 2014, ACA provisions increased the insured rate by
more than 5 percentage points in the adult population (8,9).
Enrollment gains were especially large among low-income
adults in Medicaid-expanding states (8). Individuals with
chronic illnesses (10) and fair or poor health (11) were also
especially likely to gain insurance in 2014. ACA provisions
increased overall service use and reduced out-of-pocket
spending among the newly covered (8,12). Commentators
have suggested that 2014 expansions—in tandem with the
MHPAEA—could greatly expand access to treatment for
people with mental and substance use disorders (5,7). The
2010 ACA provision allowing young adults to remain as
dependents on parental insurance coverage increased the

 use of mental health care (13) and improved financial pro-
tection (14). However, impacts of 2014 ACA provisions on
treatments for mental and substance use disorders are largely
unknown. We examined changes in coverage and service use
in a national sample of individuals with these disorders from
2011 to 2014.
METHODS
Data
Cross-sectional data from the National Survey on Drug Use
and Health (NSDUH) were analyzed. NSDUH annually in-
terviews about 70,000 individuals and provides nationally
representative estimates for the noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation. Respondents are interviewed in their homes with
computer-assisted interviewing. Annual response rates varied
from 58.3% to 64.7% during our study period (2011–2014) (1).
The NSDUH identifies individuals likely to currently
have mental illness by using a score derived from screen-
ing questions on mental health impairment, suicidality, and
severe psychological distress. This composite measure has
been validated against clinical assessments (c statistic=.745)
(15). Individuals are screened for current substance use
disorders by applying DSM-IV definitions of abuse or
dependence.
Individuals were asked about their current insurance sta-
tus in several major categories: private insurance, Medicaid
or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare, and
other insurance programs (including Department of Veterans
Affairs benefits and TRICARE). Individuals not reporting any
of these categories were asked in a follow-up question con-
firming whether they were uninsured.
Individuals were separately asked whether they received
treatment for a mental or substance use disorder in the prior
year. Individuals indicating prior-year mental health treat-
ment were asked about visiting various inpatient or outpatient
settings or receiving a prescription for a psychotropic medi-
cation and could indicate multiple types of treatment. Indi-
viduals indicating substance use disorder treatment were also
asked about visiting inpatient and outpatient settings.
Payment source for mental and substance use disorder
treatment was measured using various question formats. For
mental health treatment, payment source was measured
only for prior-year outpatient and inpatient services (not for
psychotropic medications), and individuals could indicate
only one source of payment that covered the majority of
treatment received (individuals with both outpatient and
inpatient service use could indicate different sources of
payment). For substance use disorder treatment, individuals
were asked to indicate all payment sources for treatment
most recently received. We analyzed each payment source
with a separate indicator.
The NSDUH also collects demographic measures, includ-
ing sex, race-ethnicity, household income, highest educational
attainment, and age. To protect confidentiality, variables such
as income are reported in broad categories. To address
missing data for some variables, NSDUH analysts apply impu-
tation methods (16). We used the imputation-revised measures
to minimize nonresponse bias.
Statistical Analysis
To compare changes after the implementation of the 2014
provisions of the ACA, we divided the sample into two groups:
2011–2013 and 2014. We identified individuals with either
probable mental illness or a substance use disorder, restricting
the sample to adults ages 18–64 (persons $65 were excluded
because most were Medicare eligible before implementation
of the ACA).
For individuals with a mental disorder, with a substance
use disorder, and with neither disorder, we calculated per-
centages with each type of insurance. We also calculated
percentages of those using any treatment in the prior year
and, conditional on receiving treatment, types of settings
visited and source of payment for treatment. For substance
use disorder treatment, we excluded treatment in self-help
programs and jails, which are typically not paid for through
insurance.
We examined changes overall and among adults with
household income #200% of the federal poverty level (FPL).
The #200% category includes all individuals eligible for
Medicaid under the ACA provisions residing in states expand-
ing Medicaid and two-thirds of individuals enrolled in the
marketplaces (17).
All estimates were adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity,
residence in a metropolitan area, and self-reported general
health. We applied survey weights to make estimates na-
tionally representative, adjusting standard errors for com-
plex sampling design. We calculated two-tailed t tests to
compare differences in means for the two time periods and
used p,.05 as the cutoff for statistical significance.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we con-
sidered changes in the subgroup with both mental illness
and substance use disorders. Second, to analyze changes
among those more or less likely to be affected, we examined
changes among individuals with income #100% of FPL
(who would be most affected by Medicaid expansion) and
individuals with income .200% of FPL (who might be less
affected). Third, we excluded populations enrolled in Sup-
plemental Security Income (SSI) because they were eligible
for Medicaid prior to the ACA. Fourth, we excluded adults
under age 26 who had already been substantially affected
by the 2010 ACA dependent coverage provision. Fifth, we
examined the subgroup of individuals interviewed in the
NSDUH in the second half of 2014, because they had greater
time to experience new coverage options, comparing them
with individuals interviewed in the second halves of 2011,
2012, and 2013. Sixth, instead of modeling a discontinuity in
2014, we modeled time trends over the sample period using
linear and quadratic coefficients to provide more insight into
the evolving trends.

 RESULTS
Prevalence and Population Demographic
Characteristics
The prevalence of mental and substance use disorders re-
mained relatively unchanged over the study period, at about
20% and 10%, respectively, of all nonelderly adults (Figure 1).
Across the study period, 39.8% of individuals with mental
illness were under age 35, compared with 57.7% of individ-
uals with substance use disorders (Table 1). Most of those
with mental illness were women (61.2%) whereas women
were the minority in the substance use disorder group
(35.9%). Roughly two-thirds of both groups were non-
Hispanic whites. More than half resided in large metropol-
itan areas. About one-quarter (22.5%) of individuals with
mental illness were at or below 100% of FPL, compared with
20.9% of individuals with substance use disorders. An ad-
ditional 21.7% of individuals with mental illness and 21.5%
of individuals with substance use disorders had incomes
between 101% and 200% of FPL. About one-quarter (23.5%)
of individuals with mental illness self-rated their general
health as fair or poor, compared with 14.4% of individuals
with substance use disorders. In addition, 19.9% of individ-
uals with mental illness had comorbid substance use disor-
ders and 40.0% of individuals with substance use disorders
had comorbid mental illness. Both groups had lower in-
comes and worse health status than individuals without
mental or substance use disorders.
Insurance Coverage Trends
Among individuals with mental illness, the adjusted un-
insured rate declined by 5.4 percentage points (p,.01 for
difference), from 21.3% to 15.9% (Table 2). Most of the re-
duction in the uninsured rate among those with mental ill-
ness was attributable to increases in Medicaid coverage,
from 16.2% to 19.8%. No significant changes were noted in
this group in the rate of private insurance or Medicare and
other insurance.
Among individuals with substance use disorders, there was
a 5.1-percentage point decline (p,.01) in the uninsured rate,
from 25.9% to 20.8%. As with the population with mental ill-
ness, Medicaid enrollment accounted for most of the reduction,
increasing from 11.6% to 16.0%. No significant changes were
noted in private insurance or Medicare or other insurance.
For individuals without mental or substance use disor-
ders, the uninsured rate declined by 4.3 percentage points
(p,.01), from 18.6% to 14.3%. Medicaid enrollment in-
creased from 9.1% to 10.9%, and private insurance coverage
increased from 67.8% to 69.9% (p,.01 for both).
Changes in insurance coverage were substantially larger
among individuals with incomes #200% of FPL. The un-
insured rate for individuals with mental illness decreased by
10.1 percentage points (p,.01), from 33.2% to 23.1%. For
substance use disorders, the uninsured rate decreased by
9.1 percentage points (p,.01), from 39.9% to 30.8%. The
uninsured rate among low-income individuals without
mental or substance use disorders decreased by 8.6 per-
centage points (p,.01), from 37.6% to 29.0%. For individuals
with substance use disorders in the low-income group,
Medicaid was the only type of coverage to significantly in-
crease, but for individuals with mental illness, there were
significant increases in Medicaid and private insurance.
Mental Health Treatment Use and Payment Sources
In 2011–2013, 43.0% of individuals with mental illness re-
ceived any mental health treatment. The rate in 2014 was
45.1%, a 2.1-percentage point increase (p=.04) (Table 3).
Among those in mental health treatment in 2011–2013,
86.5% of individuals reported receiving psychotropic med-
ications, 57.2% received outpatient treatment, and 7.5% re-
ported residential or inpatient treatment. No significant changes
in treatment settings were noted between 2011–2013 and
2014.
A variety of payment sources were reported for outpatient
and inpatient mental health treatment (as noted, each indi-
vidual could report only one source for each, but some indi-
viduals used both outpatient and inpatient treatment). In
2011–2013, 14.9% reported Medicaid coverage and 34.1% re-
ported private insurance. Any out-of-pocket payment was
reported by 37.3%, and 20.6% reported paying entirely out of
pocket. Finally, 36.5% reported other sources of payment. No
significant changes in payment sources were noted between
2011–2013 and 2014. All patterns related to use of treatment,
setting, and payment source were similar among individuals
with mental illness with incomes #200% of FPL.
Substance Use Disorder Treatment Use and
Payment Sources
In 2011–2013, 9.0% of individuals with substance use disor-
ders received any treatment (excluding self-help programs);
the rate was very similar in 2014—9.3%.
In 2011–2013, individuals in treatment used various treat-
ment settings: 49.0% reported outpatient treatment pro-
grams, 37.6% reported residential treatment, 25.8% reported

TREATMENT USE AMONG ADULTS WITH MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS UNDER THE ACA
 receiving treatment in a physician’s office,
40.9% reported receiving treatment in a hos-
pital or emergency department, and 37.4% re-
ported receiving treatment in a mental health
clinic. No significant changes in treatment set-
ting were noted between 2011–2013 and 2014.
In 2011–2013, Medicaid was reported as a
source of payment for 19.6% of individuals re-
ceiving substance use disorder treatment. This
increased by 7.4 percentage points (p=.05) to
27.0% in 2014. In 2011–2013, private insurance
was reported as a source of payment by 37.2%
of individuals. Any out-of-pocket payment
was reported by 54.4%, and 22.3% reported
paying for treatment entirely out of pocket.
Other payment sources (for example, public
assistance programs) were reported by 41.5%.
No significant changes in payment by private
insurance, out of pocket, or by other sources
were noted between 2011–2013 and 2014.
Treatment patterns were similar among
individuals with incomes #200% of FPL.
No significant changes were noted in use of
treatment or in settings visited. There were
suggestive but not statistically significant in-
creases in private insurance as a reported
source of payment for treatment.
Sensitivity Analyses
Similar to individuals with mental illness and
individuals with substance use disorders, those
who had co-occurring mental and substance
use disorders did not experience any signifi-
cant change in private insurance, but they did
experience large increases in Medicaid enrollment and re-
duced rates of uninsurance. When viewed by alternative in-
come levels, the decrease in the uninsured rate and increases
in Medicaid for individuals in all groups with incomes #100%
of FPL were larger than changes in the full sample but
similar to the group with incomes #200% of FPL. Individuals
with incomes .200% of FPL experienced much smaller cov-
erage changes than the full sample, as expected because this
population is not generally eligible for Medicaid. When SSI
recipients and young adults were excluded, coverage changes
were relatively similar to those for the full sample. Insurance
coverage changes were larger for individuals interviewed in the
second half of 2014 than for the full sample. In models with
linear and quadratic time trends, we found that quadratic co-
efficients for insurance coverage were significant, consistent
with an inflection point in the trend during the study period,
rather than a gradual or consistent change in trend.
DISCUSSION
Insurance coverage gains among individuals with mental and
substance use disorders were on par with the population
without disorders in 2014, the first year of implementa-
tion of the ACA Medicaid expansions and health insurance
marketplaces. Medicaid accounted for the vast majority of
new coverage among those with substance use disorders
and those with mental illness. These populations are more
likely than the general population to have low incomes (18)
and thus to be income eligible for expanded Medicaid. By
contrast, private insurance significantly increased in only
one group—individuals with mental illness who had in-
comes #200% of FPL. Although the ACA has provided
new subsidized private insurance options and, in combi-
nation with MHPAEA, has reduced discriminatory cov-
erage practice for individuals with mental and substance
use disorders, awareness of these options may be limited
among high-need populations, and cost may remain a salient
barrier.
Mental health treatment use increased by 2.1 percentage
points. This is consistent with increased service use among
individuals with severe psychiatric distress observed in the
National Health Interview Survey (19). This reduction may
be attributable to a reduction in cost-related barriers to care,
the most frequently reported reason individuals who need

 treatment do not receive care (1). However, even after gaining
insurance, many individuals contend with deductibles and
copayments that can continue to reduce service utilization.
We did not find any changes in use of substance use disorder
treatment. Health insurance reduces the cost of substance use
disorder treatment; Medicaid significantly increased as a source
of payment among those who used treatment, indicating
some financial relief for safety-net providers and self-paying
patients. Other barriers not related to cost remain, such as
a lack of perceived need for services (1), limited supply of
treatment providers (20,21), and stigma (22,23). These may
require intervention beyond insurance expansion.
Findings add context to current efforts to increase cov-
erage and improve access to care for people with mental and
substance use disorders. Campaigns to enroll the uninsured
could highlight the availability of specialty services in in-
surance plans (24). However, private insurers may be re-
luctant to increase enrollment of these populations because
such individuals account for greater average health care
spending (25). Traditional tools for addressing this spending
risk, such as risk adjustment (included in the marketplaces),
can mitigate this risk (26), but additional strategies may be
required to account for the excess spending associated with
these conditions. Once an individual is enrolled, there is a
need to increase treatment receipt. This could include
improved screening for possible disorders and linkage to
treatment resources in primary or specialty care. For ex-
ample, care coordination programs have been effective in
linking general medical care with specialty mental health
and substance use disorder treatment (27,28). Ensuring
that Medicaid and private insurance plans include provider
networks with available specialists to provide these ser-
vices is essential.
Several limitations should be considered. We did not
have access to state-level identifiers and thus could not de-
termine whether changes in coverage and access differed in
states that implemented Medicaid expansion in 2014 (Cal-
ifornia, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Minne-
sota were early expanders—before 2014—under the ACA)
versus nonexpanding states. Second, NSDUH does not
separately identify ACA enrollment due to the marketplace,
just as it does not separately identify individuals enrolled
through nongroup plans from employer-sponsored in-
surance. Third, NSDUH is not well designed to capture out-
of-pocket spending related to copayments and deductibles.
Out-of-pocket payment is recorded only for mental health
care when it is the majority source of payment, and it is
recorded only as one of several sources of payment for
substance use disorder treatment; the amount is not re-
corded. Fourth, although NSDUH provides a large national
sample, sample sizes were limited to detect effects for
smaller subgroups. Self-reported measures may be sub-
ject to social desirability biases. The use of computer-
assisted interviewing has been found to minimize bias,
however.
CONCLUSIONS
In 2014, the first year of ACA Medicaid expansions and
marketplaces, insurance coverage improved among indi-
viduals with mental and substance use disorders. Low rates
of treatment utilization persisted, however, especially among
individuals with substance use disorders. Care coordina-
tion programs within insurance plans and health systems
can encourage treatment receipt among newly enrolled
individuals.

a Entirely out of pocket refers to most recent treatment paid for by own savings or family members and no other source of payment. Other payment sources for
mental health treatment include inpatient or outpatient treatment paid by Medicare, rehabilitation program, military, employer, other public source, or other
private source or free treatment. Individuals receiving both inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment could report two types of payment; thus the
values may sum to more than 100%. Other payment sources for substance use disorder treatment include Medicare, public assistance, courts, military health
care, or employer. Individuals receiving substance use disorder treatment could report multiple sources of payment. Adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity,
living in a metropolitan area, and general health status
