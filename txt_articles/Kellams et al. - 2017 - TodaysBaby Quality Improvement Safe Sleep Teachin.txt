 Annually, ∼3500 infants die suddenly 
and unexpectedly during sleep in the 
United States, despite the successful 
Back to Sleep campaign of the 1990s 
that halved the sudden infant death 
syndrome rate.‍1 Adherence to supine 
sleep recommendations has plateaued 
since 2001, 
2 and public health efforts 
have not resulted in significant 
decreases in soft bedding use and bed-
sharing.‍3, 
 
4 Advice and role modeling 
to caregivers by health care providers 
during the postpartum hospital stay 
are associated with greater caregiver 
adherence to the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) safe sleep 
recommendations.‍5,

Most US births occur in a hospital 
setting, which affords an ideal 
opportunity to model and provide 
education about safe sleep practice 
for caretakers.‍ Although nurses 
interface most frequently with parents 
in the postpartum setting and have 
tremendous impact on infant care 
practices after discharge, 
5,

inconsistent in-hospital adherence to 
safe sleep practices.‍8,

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nursing education and role modeling can increase 
adherence to safe sleep practices.‍ Eight US hospital maternity units with 
variable baseline approaches to education participated in a national 
multicenter nursing quality improvement (QI) intervention to promote 
safe sleep practices.‍ The goals at participating maternity units were to (1) 
increase the rate of mothers who reported receiving safe sleep information 
from nurses to ≥90% and (2) increase the rates of infants observed sleeping 
supine in a safe environment to ≥90%.‍
METHODS: A safe sleep QI toolkit, designed for and provided to all sites, 
included an educational curriculum and tools to use for staff and parent 
education.‍ Local teams implemented safe sleep education using the tools as 
plan-do-study-act cycles.‍ After each cycle, audits assessing maternal report 
of nursing education on safe sleep and inpatient infant sleep position and 
environment were performed.‍
RESULTS: The QI interventions lasted a median of 160 days (range, 101–273).‍ 
Mothers reported receiving information on 4 primary safe sleep topics 72% 
to 95% of the time (a 24%–57% increase over the baseline).‍ Additionally, 
93% of infants were observed in a supine sleep position, and 88% of infants 
were observed in a safe sleep environment (a 24% and 33% increase over 
baseline, respectively).‍ These rates were sustained up to 12 months later.‍
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a multisite QI intervention for safe sleep 
parenting education and role modeling led to increased knowledge of and 
compliance with safe sleep practices during postpartum hospitalization.‍

 We therefore developed a quality 
improvement (QI) intervention 
for safe sleep education as part of 
a multicenter trial for promoting 
AAP safe sleep recommendations.‍ 
In this article, we describe the 
strategies used to improve safe sleep 
education and role modeling at 8 
US maternity units and the extent 
to which participating maternity 
units achieved the goals of ≥90% 
maternal-reported, in-hospital 
safe sleep education on sleep 
position: an environment without 
objects, room-sharing (but not 
bed-sharing), pacifier use after 
established breastfeeding, and ≥90% 
of infants with observed safe sleep 
practices (supine in a separate sleep 
environment [ie, crib or bassinette] 
free of other objects).‍
MeThODs
Context
The Social Media and Risk Reduction 
Training (SMART) study is a 
multicenter, randomized controlled 
trial of 2 interventions aimed at 
promoting safe sleep practices.‍ 
In 1 intervention, hospital staff 
provided QI education in maternity 
units on either safe sleep (n = 8) or 
breastfeeding (n = 8) practices.‍ The 
hospitals in the safe sleep QI program 
were evaluated in this analysis.‍ At 
baseline, these hospitals had variable 
approaches for the delivery of 
safe sleep education and modeling 
practices to parents.‍ Members of 
the SMART study team visited and 
provided initial training and tools on 
enrollment.‍ However, the 8 hospitals 
implemented the QI independently, 
with minimal interaction among 
hospitals.‍ Therefore, the participating 
hospitals were not part of a QI 
collaborative but rather completed 
nearly simultaneous QI projects using 
a common set of tools.‍
The Intervention: hospital QI Teams
Study investigators conducted a 
study enrollment visit lasting 2 to 3 
hours at each participating hospital 
to introduce the TodaysBaby Safe 
Sleep Toolkit, instruction manual, 
and data collection tools and 
procedures.‍ Each hospital identified 
a site “champion” (usually a nurse 
manager or nurse educator) who 
provided educational material about 
safe sleep to maternity nursing 
staff, emphasizing their role in 
role modeling and education for 
parents and visiting family members.‍ 
Physician and nursing team members 
could receive part 4 Maintenance of 
Certification credits or continuing 
education units, respectively, if they 
met participation requirements.‍ 
The study team provided technical 
assistance, but otherwise, the local 
teams operated independently.‍ Study 
investigators held 1 conference 
call with representatives from each 
hospital, during which they could 
ask questions, troubleshoot common 
concerns, and share strategies to 
overcome barriers.‍ To increase 
the feasibility of more widespread 
implementation in the future, we 
standardized implementation of the 
QI intervention as much as possible; 
therefore, no other study team 
support was provided to sites during 
the active QI phase.‍
The Intervention: Development of the 
safe sleep Toolkit
Guiding principles in the 
development of the toolkit were 
ease of implementation and cost-
effective use across a variety 
of locations and settings.‍ Study 
investigators developed the Safe 
Sleep Nursing Education Toolkit 
using (1) existing tools, including 
the National Institutes of Health 
Safe Infant Sleep Curriculum for 
Nurses10 and the 2011 AAP safe 
sleep recommendations11; (2) 
previous epidemiologic research 
about barriers to adherence to safe 
sleep practices (such as concerns 
about choking if supine)1, 
 
12 
–18; 
(3) qualitative data from nursing 
leadership at the participating 
maternity units identifying successful 
materials, venues, and strategies 
used in previous QI projects on 
their units; (4) qualitative data from 
focus groups with maternity staff at 
Yale University and the University 
of Virginia to identify facilitators 
and barriers to providing safe 
sleep education to parents; and (5) 
consultation with an advertising 
agency with expertise in branding 
and social marketing to provide 
insight into the designing and 
scripting of educational materials 
for nursing staff to deliver to 
families.‍ The tools were designed 
to be a “campaign” rather than a 
traditional “educational initiative.‍” 
The campaign name, “TodaysBaby, 
” and logo were used on all materials 
(Supplemental Fig 6).‍
The toolkit materials emphasized 
that infant sleep practices be 
modeled and taught by nursing 
staff and provided strategies for 
addressing known barriers to 
adherence.‍ Elements included sleep 
position, the absence of other objects 
in the sleep environment, room-
sharing without bed-sharing, and the 
introduction of a pacifier for sleep 
once breastfeeding is established.‍ The 
final toolkit included the following: 
(1) PowerPoint slides providing a 
brief review of the plan-do-study-
act (PDSA) cycle methodology19 and 
key safe sleep messages for nursing 
staff; (2) posters calling attention 
to the QI campaign and the need to 
deliver key messages; (3) pocket-
sized cards that nurses could use 
when counseling parents about safe 
sleep; (4) sample letters that could 
be sent to hospital leadership, QI 
officers, and pediatric and obstetrical 
providers to raise awareness about 
the QI campaign and highlight the 
AAP recommendations; (5) a sample 
hospital policy on safe sleep that 
could be adapted for each hospital; 
and (6) a secure SMART study 
Web site with safe sleep resources, 
answers to frequently asked 
questions about infant safe sleep, and 
the ability to track QI progress.‍

 The Intervention: site QI Activities
QI activities occurred between 
July 2014 and July 2015.‍ Each 
hospital initiated its QI intervention 
on a rolling basis.‍ The baseline 
data at each hospital were 
collected at a single point in time, 
∼2 weeks before beginning the 
QI intervention, to allow time 
for planning the first cycle’s 
intervention.‍ Hospitals used PDSA 
cycles19 as the cornerstone of 
their QI initiatives.‍ On the basis 
of audit results after each cycle, 
each team decided on changes for 
their next cycle.‍ Hospitals were 
encouraged to individualize their 
approaches on the basis of needs 
and previous successful strategies 
(eg, e-mail reminders, team huddle 
updates, and presentations at staff 
meetings).‍ Maternal education was 
expected to be completed during 
the postpartum hospital stay.‍
Measures and Audits (study of 
Interventions)
The main outcomes included (1) 
reports by mothers of receiving 
safe sleep information from 
nursing staff and (2) observations 
of infants sleeping in a supine 
position and in a safe sleep 
environment.‍ By using identical 
measures for each hospital, 
outcomes were assessed by 
unannounced audits of postpartum 
mothers and sleeping infants 
on the maternity unit before 
discharge.‍ Mothers were asked if 
nurses advised them on safe sleep 
practices, including (a) placing 
the infant on his or her back for 
sleep, (b) not placing anything in 
the bassinet or crib other than 
the infant, (c) sharing the room 
but not the bed with the infant, 
and (d) offering a pacifier at 
sleep time once breastfeeding is 
established.‍ Sleeping infants were 
observed for sleep position (supine 
versus other) and safe sleep 
environment, standardly defined 
as the following: absence of objects 
(other than a thin swaddle  
blanket or light cotton blanket 
tucked snugly on 3 sides, below 
the level of the infant’s neck) and 
sleep location (alone in bassinet, 
not bed-sharing with sleeping 
adult).‍
Each hospital designated 1 to 2 QI 
team members (nurses, educators, 
or other staff members) to conduct 
unannounced audits; they were 
trained by study investigators and 
used standardized, structured, 
web-based data reporting 
forms.‍ Audits of 10 mothers 
and 10 infants were conducted 
at baseline, at the end of each 
PDSA cycle (approximately every 
2–3 weeks), and approximately 
monthly after completion of the 
site’s QI intervention.‍ The number 
of observations and audits was 
selected to allow for rapid PDSA 
cycles20 without creating an 
undue burden on staff.‍ The final 
audit at each site consisted of 20 
maternal interviews and 20 infant 
observations.‍ For each audit, staff 
approached 10 mothers, using 
a systematic sampling strategy 
(eg, first 10 sleeping infants, 
odd-numbered rooms) of their 
choosing that was consistently 
applied.‍ The sampling strategy 
and time of day (day or night shift) 
for the audit was determined by 
each individual hospital QI team.‍ 
The forms captured the local 
interventions used in each PDSA 
cycle and the audit results.‍ Team 
progress tracked over time (and 
compared with the de-identified 
progress of other participating 
hospitals) was displayed and easily 
accessible on the study Web site.‍ On 
completion of the QI intervention, 
the teams were asked to give their 
feedback regarding the impact and 
effectiveness of integrating project 
activities into nursing workflow via 
a written 2-page questionnaire and/or 
 
verbally by phone with a member 
of the study team.‍ The questions 
were compiled by the study team 
and included items such as the unit’s 
experience of whether efficiency, 
patient care, or workflow  
were impacted negatively,  
which resources were most helpful 
and least helpful, and any changes 
they would suggest for other 
hospitals planning to implement  
the QI.‍
We estimated that it would take 
3 to 4 months to complete the QI 
intervention but that the length 
of the campaign would vary for 
each hospital to achieve the goal 
of ≥90% compliance with all 
outcome measures.‍ During the 
QI intervention, certain outcome 
measures (usually maternal report 
of nursing education on pacifier 
use) did not reach 90% compliance.‍ 
In this case, the decision to end 
the local QI work was made jointly 
between the local hospital and the 
research team when it was mutually 
felt that further improvement was 
unlikely with the current resources.‍ 
Once the QI intervention was 
considered completed, the  
hospitals entered “maintenance 
mode, 
” in which they were 
instructed to continue with the 
changes they had implemented 
to date but not to implement 
anything new; sites completed the 
standardized audit approximately 
monthly to monitor their results 
over time.‍
Analysis
The interventions during each 
PDSA cycle were categorized as the 
following: staff awareness about the 
QI intervention and key messages, 
staff education on the evidence 
behind safe sleep, unit policy 
changes, and parent education (Table 
1).‍ The main outcomes among all 
participating hospitals were analyzed 
at baseline (“time 0”) and after 
PDSA cycles (2–3 week intervals) for 
6 months by using run charts.‍ We 
compared site-specific data regarding 
main outcomes at baseline and

Characteristics of the sites
Characteristics of the 8 hospitals 
are shown in Table 2.‍ One hospital 
(hospital 7) consisted of 2 campuses 
that completed separate QI 
interventions.‍ These campuses are 
represented separately when the 
timing of active QI work versus the 
maintenance mode are presented 
(Fig 5) because the QI intervention 
started and stopped at different 
times at each site.‍ However, the 
results from these 2 campuses are 
presented as 1 hospital (Tables 1 and 
3, Figs 1–4).‍ Hospitals were chosen 
from 4 different US regions.‍ Six 
sites were urban, 2 were suburban, 
and 1 was rural.‍ Six had >2000 
deliveries (range, 1229–4376) in the 
QI period of July 2014 to July 2015.‍ 
One hospital was designated “Baby-
Friendly, 
” and 3 were in the initial 
designation process.‍
Intervention Over Time
In Fig 5, we show the timeline for 
each site’s enrollment and audits.‍ 
Hospitals spent a median of 24.‍1 
(range, 14.‍4–39.‍0) weeks completing 
the QI intervention.‍ The maintenance 
mode for each site was a median of 
51.‍6 (range, 29.‍3–61.‍4) weeks.‍ Each 
team completed a median of 6 (range, 
5–9) PDSA cycles.‍ Each audit was 
completed over a median of 3 days

 (range, 0–60 days).‍ Each hospital 
completed a median of 14 audits 
(range, 9–16).‍
The QI teams at each site (which 
included bedside nurses, nurse 
managers, and physicians) chose 
interventions for PDSA cycles 
based on perceived needs and the 
effectiveness of previous cycles.‍ The 
interventions used in PDSA cycles 
and the percent of sites using each 
intervention are listed in Table 1.‍ 
The most common strategy was 
the posting of TodaysBaby posters 
for nursing staff (used at all 8 
hospitals), followed by nursing use 
of TodaysBaby pocket-size resource 
cards, huddle announcements, 
and staff meetings (each used by 7 
hospitals).‍ Five hospitals used staff 
e-mail blasts, removed contradictory 
messages from policies and education 
materials, and displayed posters and 
bulletin boards visible to families.‍ 
We are unable to formally assess 
whether particular interventions 
had greater or lesser impact with 
only 8 hospitals completing their QI 
interventions in varied combinations.‍
Outcomes
Aggregated data of the main 
outcomes are shown in Figs 1 and 2.‍ 
Mothers’ reports of receipt of nursing 
education on safe sleep practices  
(Fig 1) and observations of infants in 
a safe sleep position and environment 
(Fig 2) increased by >20 percentage 
points during the QI intervention.‍ In 
general, hospital units that had low 
baseline percentages of adherence 
with the outcome measures attained 
similarly high percentages after the 
QI intervention as those with higher 
baseline percentages (Table 3).‍

 Overall, each individual hospital 
had a median increase of 30% 
(range, 10%–50%) across the 6 
measures.‍ Maintenance mode data 
demonstrated that improvements 
were maintained, with the exception 
of maternal report of nursing 
education regarding pacifier use 
(Figs 3 and 4).‍
Contextual elements
Communication was minimal 
among the sites during the QI 
campaign, with the exception of the 
aforementioned conference call.‍ 
This collaborative discussion was 
well received and helpful, especially 
for hospitals that were earlier in 
their QI intervention.‍ The barriers 
discussed on the call included 
physician engagement, reviewing 
with physicians the evidence base for 
the recommendations, the need for 
scripting for nursing staff to answer 
common questions from families, and 
carving out staff time for the audits.‍
Because each unit implemented 
different interventions and different 
combinations of interventions, it 
is not possible to discern if any 
particular intervention was more 
effective than the others.‍ However, in 
both qualitative interviews and the 
concluding survey, teams reported 
that reminders at huddles and staff 
meetings, the TodaysBaby pocket-
sized cards used to teach parents, 
and individual crib cards (1 site 
created these for their own use) 
were the most useful strategies.‍ In 
general, there was enthusiasm for 
the PDSA cycle methodology.‍ Many 
sites endorsed the importance of 
having a champion.‍ The hospitals 
reported that the toolkits were easy 
to use, they liked the branding and 
the scripting, and all of the tools 
were helpful to some degree.‍ It was 
important for each hospital to be 
able to creatively tailor the approach 
for their site.‍ In addition, hospitals 
commented that it was helpful to 
view their progress in comparison 
with the other participating hospitals 
on the study Web site.‍ Although there 
were some initial concerns regarding 
the amount of time it would take and 
whether they could free up staff to 
perform the audits, all sites indicated 
that the audits were not time 
consuming (<30 minutes per cycle).‍ 
Teams were surprised to discover 
that often some of the “other” items 
in the cribs (eg, thermometers, bulb 
syringes) were related to infant care.‍ 
Most said that they would not change 
anything, but 2 sites mentioned that 
they would have liked more help with 
data collection, and 1 site said that 
they would have liked their PDSA 
cycles to be a little longer than the 
suggested 2 weeks.‍
DIsCUssIOn
Implementation of a nursing-
focused safe sleep toolkit using QI 
methodology was feasible among 8 
US maternity units and led to rapid 
improvement of adherence to AAP-
recommended safe sleep practices 
during postpartum hospitalization, 
with over 90% of infants observed to 
be sleeping in the supine position and 
almost 90% of infants observed to be 
in a safe sleep environment.‍ These 
improvements were sustained for 
12 months after the QI intervention.‍ 
This intervention was successful with 
minimal training in QI methodology 
and safe sleep practices provided by 
the study team among a diverse set of 
maternity units.‍
These results are consistent with 
results from studies in other hospital 
settings where QI methodology 
has been an effective strategy 
to increase adherence to infant 
safe sleep practices.‍21 
– 
23 As in the 
current study, the use of safe sleep 
toolkits that include education tools 
for nurses to deliver to families 
have also been successfully used 
in the NICU.‍24, 
25 In recent studies 
conducted in maternity units, 
researchers have demonstrated that 
bundled interventions using nurse 
modeling, parents viewing a DVD, 
and either nurses or parents signing 
a commitment or acknowledgment 
of the fact that education improved 
adherence to safe sleep practices 
at the time of discharge and at 4 
months.‍26, 
 
27
This project was unique in that it 
was designed to be a comprehensive 
campaign, and each site could select 
resources and strategies from the 
toolkit to tailor their PDSA cycles 
on the basis of specific needs.‍ The 
introduction and overview could 
be viewed online or presented in a 
webinar format, and the toolkit and 
materials could be downloaded as 
needed by each facility.‍ Hospitals 
could identify champions and form 
teams on their own.‍ Frequently asked 
questions and helpful resources were 
readily available online.‍
The only measure that did not 
reach the ≥90% target was the 
report of receipt of nursing advice 
to use a pacifier during sleep once 
breastfeeding has been established.‍ 
Lower reporting of receiving advice 
about pacifiers may be due to 
residual confusion regarding the 
AAP recommendations to introduce 
pacifiers as a part of safe sleep and 
sudden infant death syndrome risk 
reduction11 and the recent push 
to implement the Baby-Friendly 
Ten Steps, which discourage the 
introduction of pacifiers until 
breastfeeding is well established.‍28, 
 
29  
For future implementation, greater 
emphasis on this recommendation 
with careful explanation may be 
needed to encourage appropriate 
pacifier use as a risk reduction strategy.‍
It is important to ascertain whether 
gains attained during the birth 
hospitalization are sustained 
postdischarge.‍ The role modeling 
of safe sleep practices by hospital 
personnel is associated with greater 
caregiver adherence at home5, 
 
6 
because it establishes or reinforces 
the importance of the safe sleep 
practices.‍15 There are few studies in 
which researchers evaluated longer-
term effects of QI initiatives such

 as this, and discussing these effects 
are beyond the scope of this article.‍ 
However, incremental benefits may 
be hard to demonstrate given that 
many hospitals have high baseline 
levels of adherence.‍ Additional 
studies will be needed to determine 
the optimal timing and content 
needed for sustained increases in 
adherence.‍
The QI intervention was designed 
before the updated AAP policy 
statement in 2016, 
11 and therefore 
it is possible that the updated safe 
sleep recommendations could 
have required a change in the 
toolkit.‍ However, the 4 safe sleep 
recommendations included in the 
QI campaign were unchanged in the 
2016 AAP policy statement, making 
the QI campaign consistent with 
current AAP guidelines.‍
We did not formally assess each 
hospital’s baseline educational 
practices, although most did report 
having safe sleep brochures available.‍ 
However, units with low baseline 
percentages of adherence with 
the outcome measures attained 
similarly high percentages after the 
QI intervention as those with higher 
baseline percentages.‍
Participating teams were engaged in 
the larger SMART study, suggesting 
that they were committed to the 
success of the safe sleep intervention.‍ 
They also received basic training 
and support from the study team.‍ 
However, individual hospital-level 
data on unit-specific barriers were 
not collected.‍ Future maternity 
hospitals aiming to adopt the 
intervention may differ in level of 
engagement and resources, and there 
may be different barriers.‍
Teams collected their data at 
different times, depending on the rate 
of their PDSA cycles, so data were 
grouped by monthly intervals for 6 
months.‍ This provided only 7 data 
points (including the baseline), which 
was insufficient to create statistical 
process control charts, which would 
enable the creation of confidence 
limits around the outcomes.‍ 
Individual hospitals wishing to 
implement this intervention would 
be able to decide for themselves an 
appropriate end point.‍
COnCLUsIOns
Adherence to infant safe sleep 
practices (including supine position 
and proper sleep location) in 
the first months of life remains 
suboptimal.‍ Safe sleep education 
and role modeling for parents in 
the postpartum hospital setting are 
variable but represent an opportunity 
for intervention.‍ The implementation 
of a simple, nursing-based safe 
sleep education toolkit using basic 
QI methodology among a diverse 
group of maternity units led to rapid 
and sustained improvements in 
safe sleep education and practices.‍ 
This intervention has the potential 
for widespread adoption that may 
contribute to reduction in sleep-
related infant deaths.‍
