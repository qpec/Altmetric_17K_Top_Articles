Abstract Cephalopods are able to control their arms
sophisticatedly and use them for various behaviors, such as
camouflage, startling predators and hunting prey. Here, we
report a previously undescribed arm-flapping behavior of
the pharaoh cuttlefish, Sepia pharaonis, observed in cap-
tivity. S. pharaonis raised the first pair of arms and wrin-
kled the parts near the distal end, where the skin color was
darkened. Additionally, S. pharaonis spread the second and
third pairs of arms and bent them as if they were jointed,
and flapped the distal ends. S. pharaonis showed this
behavior in two different situations: after being introduced
into a large space, and during hunting. We discuss the
putative functions of this behavior, including possible
mimicry of a hermit crab, considering the situations in
which the behavior was observed.

Introduction
Coleoid cephalopods (cuttlefish, squids and octopuses) are
molluscs as well as being bivalves and gastropods, but they
have two remarkable characteristics. Firstly, they have the
most highly developed nervous systems among inverte-
brates, which are comparable to those of vertebrates
(Packard 1972; Hochner 2012; Vitti 2013). They show
various learning abilities such as associative learning,
conditional
discrimination
and
observational
learning
(Darmaillacq et al. 2014). Secondly, within the animal
kingdom, cephalopods have the most sophisticated ability
to
change
their
appearance
(Hanlon
and
Messenger
1988, 1996; Messenger 2001; Hanlon 2007). Their body
coloration, pattern, skin texture and posture are under the
direct control of the brain, which enables them to change
their appearance in milliseconds (Barbosa et al. 2008;
Ma
¨thger et al. 2008; Allen et al. 2009; Barbosa et al. 2012).
Using these characteristics, cephalopods are able to
adaptively change their appearance according to different
situations. Especially, they are extremely adept at camou-
flage. They are able to change their appearance to match
their color, contrast and pattern to their surroundings to
avoid being detected by predators (Chiao and Hanlon 2001;
Ma
¨thger et al. 2007; Chiao et al. 2010; Akkaynak et al.
2013), and imitate inanimate three-dimensional structures,
such as rocks, seaweed and algae to avoid being recognized
as prey by predators (Moynihan and Rodaniche 1982;
Hanlon and Messenger 1988; Buresch et al. 2011; Barbosa
et al. 2012). Previous studies have also reported that sev-
eral octopuses are able to mimic the appearance and
behavior of other animals (Norman et al. 2001).
Cephalopods change their appearance not only for
camouflage.
They
often
spread
their
arms
against
approaching predators (i.e., flamboyant display), which is

 considered a means of startling or frightening them (Han-
lon and Messenger 1996). Additionally, there are several
anecdotal reports that squids and cuttlefish use their arms
for luring prey (Hanlon and Messenger 1996).
In the present paper, we describe a novel arm-flapping
behavior of the pharaoh cuttlefish, Sepia pharaonis,
observed in two different situations. We briefly discuss its
putative function based on the situations where the
behavior was observed.
Materials and methods
Situation 1: arm-flapping behavior observed
in a large tank
Observations in 2011
Eggs of S. pharaonis were collected from the coastal
waters of Okinawajima Island in May 2011 and were
transported to the Department of Chemistry, Biology and
Marine Sciences of the University of the Ryukyus. In
November and December 2011, forty-eight individuals
were transported to Sesoko Station, at the Tropical Bio-
sphere Research Center, University of the Ryukyus. These
cuttlefish were maintained in six round tubs [110-L volume
(300-mm height, 700-mm diameter)], with eight individu-
als in each tank. The first time we observed the unusual
arm moving behavior was when cuttlefish were transferred
to a large circular tank [10,000-L volume (1.1-m height,
3.0-m diameter)] for the purpose of conducting other
experiments. We observed three of 48 cuttlefish flapping
their arms intensely, which had not been observed while
the cuttlefish were kept in the small maintenance tanks.
Therefore, after the experiments had finished, we trans-
ferred eight cuttlefish [206–211 days old; 88.1-mm mean
mantle length (ML)] simultaneously to the large circular
tank again to observe the behavior in December 2011. We
submerged a video camera (HD HERO; GoPro) at the
bottom of the experimental tank and recorded the behavior
of the cuttlefish. Observations were conducted for 5 days
after the cuttlefish had been transferred to the tank.
Observations in 2013
Eggs of S. pharaonis were collected from the coastal
waters of Okinawajima Island in April and May 2013 and
were transported to the Department of Chemistry, Biology
and Marine Sciences at the University of the Ryukyus.
Cuttlefish were reared in rectangular tanks [90-L volume
(400-mm length, 600-mm width, 400-mm height)]. We
introduced eight cuttlefish (234 days old; 139.8-mm mean
ML) into a larger tank [1500-L volume (1800-mm length,
1800-mm width, 500-mm height)] in December 2013. We
recorded behavior of the cuttlefish with a video camera
(HERO3 ? Black Edition; GoPro) submerged at the bot-
tom of the tank for 1 h immediately after they were
transferred to the tank.
The total recording time of the behavior of cuttlefish
was 404 min. We counted the occurrences of the behavior
shown by S. pharaonis (i.e., intense flapping of arms; see
‘‘Results’’) and measured the duration of each behavior.
When the behavior was continuously performed for more
than 5 s, we considered the behavior had occurred. When
the interval between a previous and subsequent display of
the behavior was longer than 10 s, we counted the two
events as separate occurrences.
Situation 2: arm-flapping behavior observed
while hunting prey
The cuttlefish were derived from the same egg masses
collected in 2013 and reared under the same conditions as
described above. We conducted experiments to examine
the development of the hunting ability of S. pharaonis. A
total of 34 individuals was used in the experiments:
42–47 days
old
(n = 6),
74–79 days
old
(n = 8),
104–109 days old (n = 8), 134–139 days old (n = 8), and
164–169 days old (n = 4). Cuttlefish were individually
introduced into an experimental tank [60-L volume (400-
mm length, 600-mm width, 250-mm height)], and pre-
sented with ten small live fish (tropical damselfish, Chry-
siptera cyanea) simultaneously as prey. We recorded the
hunting behavior of each cuttlefish for 2 h using a video
camera (HDR-CX560V and HDR-CX630V; Sony) moun-
ted above the experimental tank.
During the experiments, we unexpectedly observed
cuttlefish showing arm-flapping behavior similar to that
in situation 1, although the size of the experimental tank
did not differ from that of the rearing tank. We measured
the duration of this arm-flapping behavior according to the
definition described above, calculated the mean duration of
the behavior, and compared the total number of prey ani-
mals captured between the cuttlefish that did and did not
display this arm-flapping behavior. We also counted the
number of tentacular strikes, which is a behavior used to
capture prey, and tested whether the arm-flapping behavior
exhibited until immediately before the tentacular strike
affected the success ratio of the following strike. We also
examined the relationship between the total duration of the
arm-flapping and the total number of tentacular strikes. All
statistical analyses were performed using R version 3. 2. 1
(R Core Team 2015). We excluded the data of one indi-
vidual (i.e., 104–109 days old) from the analysis because
the prey animals were apparently weakened so that this
cuttlefish was able to capture them easily.

 Results
Situation 1: arm-flapping behavior observed
in a large tank
We observed the following arm-flapping behavior in 21
and 16 cases in 2011 and 2013, respectively. S. pharaonis
manipulated each pair of its arms differently (Fig. 1). The
first pair of arms was raised together vertically (Fig. 2a).
The parts near the distal end of the first arms were rounded,
and the skin color of these parts was darkened (Fig. 2a).
The second and third pairs of arms were separated and
extended (see S1 Electronic Supplementary Material),
often being bent as if jointed, and were flapped indepen-
dently (see S2 Electronic Supplementary Material). The
fourth pair of arms did not show any characteristic move-
ment and were positioned as usual. The mean duration of
the behavior was 36.2 s (±34.3 SD) and 20.9 s (±18.4 SD)
in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Cuttlefish displayed this
behavior both when moving around (see S1 Electronic
Supplementary Material) and when staying in the same
place (see S2 Electronic Supplementary Material). Even
when cuttlefish moved around while displaying this
behavior, they remained close to the bottom of the tank and
hardly swam in the water column. The color patterns of the
dorsal mantle during the behavior were not consistent.
During the behavior, cuttlefish often lightened their skin, in
a flickering manner, around their eyes and at the base of
their arms.
Situation 2: arm-flapping behavior observed
while hunting prey
Sixteen of 33 individuals showed the arm-flapping behav-
ior described above at least once during the experiments
(Fig. 3). The total duration of this behavior in each indi-
vidual was 2183.0 s (±1778.7 SD), and the mean duration
of the behavior was 242.9 s (±492.6 SD), which was sig-
nificantly longer than in situation 1 (Wilcoxon rank sum
tests, 2011, W = 326.5, P \ 0.001, 2013; W = 742.5,
P \ 0.001). Cuttlefish that displayed the arm-flapping
behavior captured a significantly larger number of prey fish
(4.0 ± 2.5 SD) than those that did not display this behavior
(1.9 ± 1.1 SD) (Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 199.0,
P \ 0.05). We observed a total of 298 tentacular strikes. In
98 cases of these, cuttlefish exhibited the arm-flapping
behavior until immediately before the strike. The success
ratio of a strike with and without the arm-flapping behavior
was 26.5% (26 out of 98) and 38.5% (77 out of 200),
respectively, but there was no significant difference
between them (v2-test, v2 = 3.65, df = 1, P [ 0.05). There
was a positive correlation between the total duration of the
arm-flapping and the number of tentacular strikes of each
individual
(Spearman’s
rank
correlation,
r = 0.71,
P \ 0.001, n = 33). Cuttlefish actively approached prey
animals while exhibiting this behavior yet the prey fish
seemed to pay little attention to the cuttlefish.
Discussion
In cephalopods, several behavior patterns that are charac-
terized by the spread of their arms have been reported
previously (Hanlon and Messenger 1996). Although S.
pharaonis also shows typical arm-spreading behaviors
(personal observation), the behavior we describe in the
present study differs from previously described arm-
spreading behaviors, because S. pharaonis was observed
here not only to spread its arms but also to flap them
intensely. Hanlon and Messenger (1996) reported that
Sepia latimanus raises the first pair of arms and twirls the
second pair. This behavior is apparently similar to the
behavior we observed here; however, S. latimanus waves
the first pair of arms side to side and darkens the second
pair of arms, whereas S. pharaonis did not do this in the
behavior observed in the present study. Thus, we consider
that the present behavior is different from that described in
S. latimanus.
Several functions have been suggested for behaviors
using the arms in cephalopods: masquerade, flamboyant
display and luring. With regard to the function of the
behavior we describe in the present study, masquerade is
unlikely since the present behavior is characterized by
conspicuous flapping movements of the arms, which would
disrupt the effectiveness of camouflage. A flamboyant
function is also unlikely because this display is only
exhibited when the predator is imminent (Hanlon and
Messenger 1996), whereas there were no predator stimuli

 during our observation. It is possible that the present
behavior functions as luring because 16 out of 33 cuttlefish
showed the behavior during hunting. In fact, the cuttlefish
that displayed the mimetic behavior captured twofold the
number of prey fish. However, prey animals did not seem
to be attracted to the cuttlefish, and cuttlefish actively
approached prey animals. Experimental verification is
necessary to conclude the luring function of this behavior
by S. pharaonis.
Another possibility is that the present behavior functions
as mimicry. The color and posture of the first pair of arms
resembled the eyes of a crustacean, and the movement of
their second and third pairs of arms resembled a crustacean
moving its appendages. The dorsal mantle of the cuttlefish
would correspond to the gastropod shell of a hermit crab.
Several previous studies have reported that octopuses are
able to impersonate other animals (Hanlon et al. 1999;
Hochberg et al. 2006; Huffard 2007; Hanlon et al. 2008;
Krajewski et al. 2009; Hanlon et al. 2010). A mimic
octopus, Thaumoctopus mimicus, is the most well-known
example of this, and has been suggested to impersonate
various venomous animals, such as a poisonous sole, sea
snake and lionfish (Norman et al. 2001). In addition,
Warnke et al. (2012) have reported that the stumpy-spined
cuttlefish, Sepia bandensis, seems to move like a snail.
Since cuttlefish are soft bodied and vulnerable to predation
(Hanlon and Messenger 1996), mimicking hermit crabs,
which have a hard shell to protect them against predators,
presumably would be beneficial to some degree for the
cuttlefish. In addition, hermit crabs are generally scav-
engers and filter feeders (Angel 2000) and not active
hunters. Thus, mimicking hermit crabs would help cuttle-
fish to approach their prey more closely, inside the range of
their tentacles (Messenger 1968). Nonetheless, the arm-
flapping behavior exhibited until immediately before the
tentacular strike did not increase the success ratio of the
following strike in the present study. We studied the arm-
flapping behavior in the simple visual environment of an
experimental tank, which lacked substrates, structural
objects and other animals including possible model species
(i.e., hermit crab). It is thus necessary to examine the effect
of the arm-flapping behavior under natural conditions.
Unfortunately, few field studies of S. pharaonis have been
conducted (Minton et al. 2001), and its behavior, habitat
and life history in the wild are poorly understood. Thus, we
are currently unable to identify the species that S. phar-
aonis may mimic. Future research in the wild as well as
experimental studies are necessary to verify the validity of
the above mimicry hypothesis and increase our under-
standing of the function of the described behavior.
