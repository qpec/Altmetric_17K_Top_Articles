Abstract
Background: Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction has mostly been attributed to chemotherapy; this explanation, however,
fails to account for cognitive dysfunction observed in chemotherapy-naı
¨ve patients. In a controlled, longitudinal, multisite
study, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive function in breast cancer patients is affected by cancer-related post-traumatic
stress.
Methods: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and healthy control subjects, age 65 or younger, underwent three
assessments within one year, including paper-and-pencil and computerized neuropsychological tests, clinical diagnostics of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and self-reported cognitive function. Analysis of variance was used to compare three
groups of participants—patients who did or did not receive chemotherapy and healthy control subjects—on age- and
education-corrected cognitive performance and cognitive change. Differences that were statistically significant after correc-
tion for false discovery rate were investigated with linear mixed-effects models and mediation models. All statistical tests
were two-sided.
Results: Of 226 participants (166 patients and 60 control subjects), 206 completed all assessment sessions (attrition: 8.8%).
Patients demonstrated overall cognitive decline (group*time effect on composite z-score: –0.13, P ¼ .04) and scored
consistently worse on Go/Nogo errors. The latter effect was mediated by PTSD symptoms (mediation effect: B ¼ 0.15, 95%
confidence interval ¼ 0.02 to 0.38). Only chemotherapy patients showed declined reaction time on a computerized alertness
test. Overall cognitive performance correlated with self-reported cognitive problems at one year (T ¼ –0.11, P ¼ .02).

 Conclusions: Largely irrespective of chemotherapy, breast cancer patients may encounter very subtle cognitive dysfunction,
part of which is mediated by cancer-related post-traumatic stress. Further factors other than treatment side effects remain to
be investigated.
Many patients with breast or other non–nervous system cancers
report cognitive dysfunction (1,2), and some are considerably
burdened by it (3–5). Based on evidence of impaired perfor-
mance on neuropsychological tests after chemotherapy (6),
which was bolstered by reports of structural and functional
brain anomalies after cytostatic treatment (7), neurotoxicity of
chemotherapy has been the prime suspect to cause the condi-
tion colloquially termed chemobrain (8–14). The singular role of
chemotherapy neurotoxicity for cognitive dysfunction in cancer
patients, however, has been questioned by findings of cognitive
dysfunction in patients whose systemic treatment had not yet
begun (15–24) or who were managed without chemotherapy
(25–27). Recent investigations have linked pretreatment cogni-
tive impairment to inflammatory processes caused by the tu-
mor, with as yet equivocal results (15,28,29).
Effects of having cancer on cognitive function are to be ex-
pected even if no adverse effects of medications were to occur.
It seems very unlikely that distress, sleep problems, and pro-
longed sick leave, among other factors associated with having
cancer, do not impact the brain, which, as a highly dynamic and
plastic organ, is susceptible to all experience and subtly changes
in interaction with it. In research on cancer-related cognitive
dysfunction, however, other factors than medication side ef-
fects have comparatively rarely been investigated (30–35).
Particularly, although memory and attention impairments are
symptoms of many mental diseases (36), which are highly prev-
alent in cancer patients (37), psychological morbidity has
merely been assessed with self-report screening instruments
and regarded as a confounder in most studies.
The Cognition in Breast Cancer Patients: The Impact of
Cancer-Related Stress (Cognicares) study was designed to test
the hypothesis that cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer pa-
tients is mediated by post-traumatic stress. Many breast cancer
patients experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) (38–41), and there is abundant evidence that PTSD and
PTSD symptoms impact the brain (42–48) and cognitive func-
tioning (49–51). Two previous articles on the Cognicares study
focused on PTSD symptoms (39) and pretreatment cognitive
function (13). Here, we report on cognitive performance and its
change in dependence of chemotherapy and PTSD symptoms
throughout the first year after diagnosis of breast cancer.
Methods
Participants and Enrollment
Women diagnosed with yet untreated stage 0 to IIIc breast can-
cer were eligible for participation if they were between age 18
and 65 years, proficient in German, free of substance abuse,
without history of neurological or psychotic disorder or sys-
temic treatment for any cancer. Women who had undergone
breast imaging with negative result at one of the study centers,
had never had cancer, and otherwise met the above-mentioned
criteria were eligible for the control group. Participants were en-
rolled as previously described (13). Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the Ludwig Maximilian University of
Munich and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, registration num-
ber NCT01264562 (52).
Assessment Proceedings
Three 120- to 150-minute assessment sessions were scheduled;
the first (T1) prior to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy for breast cancer patients and a minimum of one week
after negative breast imaging for control subjects; the second
(T2) a minimum of one week after completion of chemotherapy
or at matched intervals after T1, and the third (T3) one year after
T1. Assessments were conducted between January 2011 and

 October 2014 by Master’s-level psychologists. Participants were
compensated with 15 Euros for each assessment session.
Measures
Demographic and clinical data were collected from the partici-
pants and from medical records. Cognitive function was as-
sessed with paper-and-pencil (53–56) and computerized tests
(57). Alternate forms of the Verbal Learning and Memory Test
(VLMT) (55) were used. Premorbid intelligence was estimated
with a language-based test (58). Subjective cognitive functioning
was
measured
with
the
Cognitive
Function
Scale
of
the
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
Quality-of-life Questionnaire C30, version 3.0 (EORTC-QLQ-CF)
(59,60)
and
the
Questionnaire
of
Experienced
Deficits
of
Attention (FEDA) (61). PTSD symptoms were diagnosed with the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) (62). Diagnostic
procedures for PTSD have already been described (13,39).
Briefly, in addition to cancer-related PTSD symptoms, which
were fully assessed at all three time points, the worst non-
breast cancer-related traumatic event was assessed at T1. At T2
and T3, non-breast cancer-related traumatic events were as-
sessed if they had newly happened, and non-breast cancer-re-
lated, mostly long-standing PTSD symptoms diagnosed at
previous assessments were treated as persistent. The German
version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D) (63–64) was
used to measure depression and to screen for mental disorders.
All instruments were validated.
Statistical Analyses
Indices of cognitive function derived from the neuropsychologi-
cal tests have earlier been described in detail (13). As in the key
analyses of the previous report, commission errors and omis-
sion errors were aggregated in an error score for the Divided
Attention Test and the Go/Nogo Test, resulting in 18 indices of
specific cognitive abilities.
Outliers, even if they are legitimate data points, distort de-
scriptive statistics and reduce the power of statistical tests.
Therefore, in the raw cognitive scores, extreme outliers (data
points more than 3*interquartile range below the first quartile
or above the third quartile) were winsorized; that is, they were
replaced with the lowest or highest value not considered an ex-
treme outlier (65–67).
Winsorized cognitive raw scores were adjusted for age and
dummy-coded education, and z-standardized. Whenever qua-
dratic relations of cognitive scores and age were found, a qua-
dratic term for age was added in the regression. For each of the
time points, the mean across all age- and education-adjusted
cognitive indices was calculated as a composite score of overall
cognitive performance.
To determine cognitive change, T2 and T3 cognitive scores
were adjusted for T1 (68) and additionally for age and education.
Again, if appropriate, quadratic terms of T1 cognitive scores and
age were included. The mean of the resulting z-standardized resid-
uals across all cognitive indices served as a composite score of cog-
nitive change in relation to baseline at the respective time point.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare three
participant groups—control subjects, nonchemotherapy pa-
tients, and chemotherapy patients—on age- and education-
adjusted scores of cognitive performance and cognitive change
at T2 and T3. Multiple testing was addressed with a false discov-
ery rate (FDR) correction optimized for grouped hypotheses (69),
which was performed for four groups of 19 hypotheses each:
differences between the participant groups on cognitive perfor-
mance at T2, cognitive performance at T3, cognitive change at
T2, and cognitive change at T3; each group with 19 indices, in-
cluding a composite score. An FDR of 20% was accepted.
Cognitive indices that showed statistically significant differ-
ences of either performance or change after FDR correction were
investigated with linear mixed-effects models. Winsorized cogni-
tive raw scores of the respective index, or, for the composite
score, the mean across all winsorized cognitive raw scores stan-
dardized by the control subjects’ scores at T1, were entered as de-
pendent
variables.

 theoretical considerations and forced into the models. Mediation
models were used to investigate whether group effects were me-
diated by PTSD symptoms. The following variables were in-
cluded: participant group (independent variable); number of
PTSD symptoms (mediator); winsorized cognitive raw scores of
the respective index or, for the composite score, the mean across
all winsorized cognitive raw scores standardized by the control
subjects’ scores at T1 (dependent variable), and all other vari-
ables used in the linear mixed-effects models except time and its
interactions (covariates). Statistical significance of the regression
coefficients and the mediation effect was tested with a t-statistic
and a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure (10 000 repeti-
tions), respectively, which are included in the INDIRECT macro
for SPSS by Preacher and Hayes (70). Kendall tau (T) rank correla-
tion was used to test bivariate associations of cognitive indices
that showed effects of participant group with PTSD symptoms
and self-reported cognitive function.
We followed International Cognition and Cancer Task Force
(ICCTF) recommendations (12) and defined individual cognitive
impairment by the number of age- and education-adjusted cog-
nitive test scores 1.5 and 2 standard deviations below the mean
of the control group, applying a definition that rendered an im-
pairment rate of 5% in control subjects at T1 (13); namely, five or
more scores below 1.5 standard deviations and/or four or more
scores below 2 standard deviations. The relative risk of cognitive
impairment for patients was calculated.
The study was powered to detect 5% of explained variance
with 80% power at a statistical significance level of 5%. IBM SPSS
Statistics 22 and 23 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.); the software R (71),
packages lme4 (72), and lmerTest (73); and the mediation proce-
dure macro INDIRECT for SPSS (70) were utilized. All statistical
tests were two-sided with a 5% statistical significance level.
Results
Participants, Timing of Assessments, and Outlying Data
Participant enrollment has previously been described (13). Of
226 participants (166 patients and 60 control subjects) who par-
ticipated at T1, 215 and 206 also completed T2 and T3 assess-
ments, respectively (attrition: n ¼ 20, 8.8%) (Figure 1). Excluded
participants did not statistically significantly differ from con-
tinuers on age, education, AJCC tumor stage (74), number of
PTSD
symptoms
(data
not
shown),
and
the
age-
and
education-corrected composite cognitive z-score at T1 (mean
difference ¼ 0.0003, 95% CI ¼ –0.20 to 0.20, P ¼ .82, n ¼ 226).
Demographic and clinical characteristics of three participant
groups that emerged at T2—control subjects, nonchemotherapy
patients, and chemotherapy patients—are given in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 1 (available online). T2 and T3 assess-
ments took place approximately 7.5 months (control subjects:
mean/SD ¼ 32.6/2.9 weeks, n ¼ 58; nonchemotherapy patients:
mean/SD ¼ 32.2/3.3weeks, n ¼ 66; chemotherapy patients: mean/
SD ¼ 33.9/4.5weeks, n¼ 91) and one year (control subjects: mean/
SD ¼ 55.1/2.6weeks, n ¼ 56; nonchemotherapy patients: mean/SD
¼ 54.5/3.3 weeks, n ¼ 62; chemotherapy patients: mean/SD ¼
55.6/4.0weeks, n¼ 88) after T1, and approximately two months
(mean/SD ¼ 9.1/5.3weeks, n ¼ 91) and seven months (mean/SD ¼
31.0/5.5weeks,
n ¼ 88)
after
completion
of
chemotherapy,
respectively.
Sixty extreme outliers (0.5 % of all data points) were identi-
fied (24, 18, and 18 extreme outliers at T1, T2, and T3, respec-
tively) among the raw scores of the Trail-Making Tests A and B,
Verbal Learning and Memory Test consolidation, and all com-
puterized measures except Index phasic alertness and Go/Nogo
reaction time. The rate of participants with extreme outliers did
not statistically significantly differ between the groups at any
time point (Fisher-Freeman-Halton Exact Test, data not shown).
All extreme outliers were winsorized.
Comparisons of Participant Groups on
Cognitive Function
Winsorized cognitive raw data, age- and education-adjusted
performance scores, and age- and education-adjusted cognitive
change scores are shown in Tables 2 through 4, respectively.
Cognitive change at T3 is also displayed in Figure 2.
No differences of age- and education-corrected cognitive
performance
or cognitive change between the
participant
groups were detected at T2 (Tables 3 and 4). At T3, however, sta-
tistically significant differences of cognitive performance were
found on four indices (composite score, Alertness RT condition
1, Alertness SD of RT condition 1, Go/Nogo errors) (Table 3), and
these indices were further investigated. Linear mixed-effects
model analyses demonstrated effects of participant group on
three of these indices (Table 5):
On the composite score, an interaction effect of time with
both patient groups (estimate, –0.13 z-values, P ¼ .04) indicated

 decline of overall performance in patients relative to control
subjects at T3, which concurred with improvement of the entire
sample at T2 and T3, as signified by the effects of time alone
(T2: estimate, 0.12 z-values, P ¼ .004; T3: estimate, 0.21 z-values,
P < .001). On Alertness RT condition 1, an interaction effect of
time with chemotherapy group (P ¼ .03) indicated declined per-
formance of chemotherapy patients relative to nonchemother-
apy patients and control subjects at T3. On Go/Nogo errors,
effects of both patient groups (nonchemotherapy patients,
P ¼ .01; chemotherapy patients, P < .001) indicated consistently
worse performance of patients compared with control subjects,
while an interaction effect of time with chemotherapy group
signified improvement of chemotherapy patients relative to
nonchemotherapy patients and control subjects at T2 (P ¼ .01).
No effects of antiestrogen therapy were found in any of the lin-
ear mixed-effects model analyses (Table 5).
The composite score of cognitive performance correlated
statistically significantly with the FEDA (T ¼ �0.11, P ¼ .02,
n ¼ 206) at T3. No other statistically significant correlations of
self-reported cognitive function (Table 1) with any of the mea-
sures of cognitive performance that differed between the partic-
ipant groups at T3 emerged (data not shown).
Individual cognitive impairment was found in three control
subjects (5.3%, n ¼ 57), two nonchemotherapy patients (3.0%,
n ¼ 66), and five chemotherapy patients (5.8%, n ¼ 86) at T2; and
in four control subjects (7.3%, n ¼ 55), 11 nonchemotherapy pa-
tients (17.7%, n ¼ 62), and 15 chemotherapy patients (17.6%,
n ¼ 85) at T3. The relative risk (RR) of cognitive impairment was
not statistically significantly increased for breast cancer pa-
tients (RR ¼ 2.43, 95% CI ¼ 0.89 to 6.65, n ¼ 202 at T3).
Effects of PTSD Symptoms on Cognitive Function
In breast cancer patients, the number of PTSD symptoms de-
creased from T1 to T3 (Table 1). The distribution of PTSD symp-
toms was extremely skewed, with 70 (31.0%, n ¼ 226), 82 (38.1%,
n ¼ 215), and 97 (47.1%, n ¼ 206) participants not experiencing
any
PTSD
symptoms
at
T1,
T2,
and
T3,
respectively.
Correlations of PTSD symptoms with FEDA and EORTC-QLQ-CF
scores (Table 1) ranged in magnitude from 0.26 to 0.42 (all P <
.001, data not shown).
In linear mixed-effects models, PTSD symptoms did not sta-
tistically significantly predict any of the four cognitive indices
that differed between the participant groups (Table 5). In explor-
atory nonparametric bivariate analyses, all correlations of com-
posite cognitive change and Go/Nogo errors at T3 with PTSD
symptoms at T2 as well as T3 were statistically significant.
Statistical significance was retained when control subjects were
excluded from the analyses (Table 6). A mediation effect of
PTSD symptoms was detected on one of the three indices that
showed effects of participant group in linear models: The effect
of patient vs control group on Go/Nogo errors at T3 (unstandar-
dized regression coefficient B ¼ 0.52, P ¼ .04, n ¼ 193) decreased

 and lost statistical significance (B ¼ 0.37, P ¼ .16, n ¼ 193) when
the mediating effect of PTSD symptoms (bias-corrected boot-
strap results for indirect effect: B ¼ 0.15, 95% CI ¼ 0.02 to 0.38)
was accounted for (Figure 3).
To ensure that the observed mediation was not incidental to
the fact that cancer patients had more opportunities to endorse
PTSD symptoms—those related to the worst noncancer event as
well as those related to cancer, whereas the latter opportunity
did not exist for control subjects—the mediation model was ad-
ditionally run with either cancer-related or non-cancer-related
PTSD symptoms, whichever number was higher in an individ-
ual participant, as a mediator. The results changed only margin-
ally (bias-corrected bootstrap results for indirect effect: B ¼ 0.17,
95% CI ¼ 0.02 to 0.42).
Discussion
In the Cognicares study, we investigated whether any differ-
ences of cognitive performance and cognitive change between
breast cancer patients who did or did not receive chemotherapy
and healthy control subjects were mediated by cancer-related
post-traumatic stress. Only very limited cognitive dysfunction
was observed. Neither of the two patient groups showed a sta-
tistically significantly elevated rate of individual cognitive im-
pairment at any time point, and similar performance of
patients and control subjects was found on most indices of spe-
cific cognitive abilities, with two exceptions: Both patient
groups performed consistently worse than the control subjects
on a computerized measure of behavioral control, Go/Nogo er-
rors, notwithstanding some intermittent improvement of the
chemotherapy patients. In contrast, only patients who had re-
ceived chemotherapy showed decline of reaction time on a
computerized test of alertness at one year.
When cognitive indices were aggregated in a composite
score of overall cognitive functioning, thus allowing small dif-
ferences to add up, decline of both patient groups relative to
control subjects emerged at one year after diagnosis, whereas
steady improvement was observed in the sample as a whole.
Apparently, the patients had benefitted less from practice on
the neuropsychological tests than the control subjects. Overall
cognitive performance was statistically significantly associated
with one of two self-report measures of cognitive functioning at
one year.
Two of the three cognitive measures that showed effects of
participant group, composite cognitive change and Go/Nogo
errors, were statistically significantly associated with PTSD
symptoms at one year. The hypothesized mediation effect of
post-traumatic stress could be demonstrated for only one
of these indices: As observed prior to treatment (13), the effect
of having cancer on Go/Nogo errors was mediated by PTSD
symptoms also one year after diagnosis.
Our finding of cognitive dysfunction irrespective of chemo-
therapy is in line with a recently published meta-analysis (75)
and a study in patients with colorectal cancer, the largest inves-
tigation of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction to date (27). In
our study, the only decline limited to chemotherapy patients
was found on a test of alertness that required pressing a mouse

 button whenever a cross appeared on a monitor. Specific im-
pairment of psychomotor speed after chemotherapy has previ-
ously been observed (76) and may at least partly be due to
peripheral neuropathy (77). Furthermore, no deleterious effects
of antiestrogen therapy were observed.
Our findings suggest that the psychological consequences of
cancer may contribute more importantly to cognitive dysfunc-
tion than side effects of medication. Whereas the effect of nar-
rowly defined post-traumatic stress does not fully explain
breast cancer–related cognitive dysfunction, it may be part of a
concert of factors like insomnia, fatigue, psychological morbid-
ity, and prolonged sick leave, all of which ensue from the psy-
chological burden and life disruption associated with cancer.
This assumption is compatible with previous observations of
little (78) or no (79–81) cognitive dysfunction particularly in
European breast cancer patients. Relatively high standards of
social security may shield these patients from cancer-related
stress to some extent; and PTSD is altogether less endemic in
several European countries, including Germany, than in the
United States and many other regions (82).
We found more pronounced cognitive dysfunction at one
year than at seven months after diagnosis. Late-onset cognitive
impairment has previously been reported (83) and may be
caused by effects of chronic stress that fully unfold only over
time (84).
Strengths of the Cognicares study include a large sample,
low attrition, a neuropsychological battery composed of paper-
and-pencil and computerized tests, and clinical diagnostics of
PTSD symptoms. To safeguard against spurious results, self-
selection of participants—particularly of control subjects—was
avoided to minimize selection bias (85), and outliers, nonlinear
relationships, and multiple testing were addressed in the
analyses.
Even though to the best of our knowledge cognitive function
has never before been longitudinally tested in as many newly diag-
nosed young and middle-aged breast cancer patients as in the
Cognicares study, sample size is still a limitation. An FDR of 20%,
which permits one of five statistically significant results to be false
positive, was chosen to balance the risk of false-positive and false-
negative results. We can therefore not exclude that part of the ob-
served differences of cognitive performance between patients and
control subjects is a chance finding. Furthermore, nonexhaustive
assessment of non-cancer-related PTSD symptoms in breast cancer
patients and control subjects alike may have led to some degree of
inaccuracy.
The Cognicares study found evidence of subtle cognitive
dysfunction in breast cancer patients that seems largely inde-
pendent of chemotherapy. The effect of cancer-related post-
traumatic stress on specific cognitive abilities that was observed
at our pretreatment evaluation (13) was found again one year
after diagnosis. These findings suggest that post-traumatic
stress is one of several factors other than treatment side effects
that affect cognitive function in cancer patients. These factors
remain to be investigated in studies that are large and methodo-
logically sound enough to capture subtle effects.

Figure 3. Mediation of the effect of having breast cancer on Go/Nogo errors by current post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms one year after diagnosis.
A) Having breast cancer increases Go/Nogo errors at T3 by a mean of 0.52 errors (total effect). B) The mediation effect of PTSD symptoms increases Go/Nogo errors at T3
by a mean of 0.15 errors; having cancer increases PTSD symptoms at T3 by a mean of 1.83 symptoms; each PTSD symptom at T3 increases Go/Nogo errors at T3 by a
mean of 0.08 errors. If mediation is accounted for, the remaining effect of having cancer on Go/Nogo errors at T3 (dotted line) is not statistically significant (P ¼ .16). The
following covariates were included: depression score at T3 (B ¼ –0.02, P ¼ .37); age (B ¼ -0.15, P ¼ .05); age squared (B ¼ 0.002, P ¼ .05); menopausal status at T3 (B ¼ 0.24,
P ¼ .34); antiestrogen therapy at T3 (B ¼ –0.17, P ¼ .44); dummy coded educational level with low level as reference category (medium level: B ¼ 0.17, P ¼ .49; high
level: B ¼ 0.13, P ¼ .67; university degree: B ¼ 0.14, P ¼ .61); estimated premorbid intelligence (B ¼ 0.0008, P ¼ .90); medication potentially affecting brain function at T3 (B
¼ –0.003, P ¼ .99). Statistical significance of the estimated regression coefficients was tested with a t statistic, controlling for all covariates in the model. The mediation
effect was tested with a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure (10 000 repetitions). All statistical tests were two-sided. B ¼ unstandardized regression coefficient,
units are errors on the Go/Nogo test; CI ¼ bootstrapped 95% confidence interval; T3 ¼ assessment approximately one year after baseline.
