Spondyloarthritis encompasses a group of common inflammatory diseases thought to be
driven by IL-17A-secreting type-17 lymphocytes. Here we show increased numbers of GM-
CSF-producing CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in the blood and joints of patients with spondy-
loarthritis, and increased numbers of IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-producing CD4, CD8, γδ
and NK cells. GM-CSF production in CD4 T cells occurs both independently and in
combination with classical Th1 and Th17 cytokines. Type 3 innate lymphoid cells producing
predominantly GM-CSF are expanded in synovial tissues from patients with spondyloarthritis.
GM-CSF+CD4+ cells, isolated using a triple cytokine capture approach, have a specific
transcriptional signature. Both GM-CSF+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-producing CD4 T cells
express increased levels of GPR65, a proton-sensing receptor associated with spondyloar-
thritis in genome-wide association studies and pathogenicity in murine inflammatory disease
models. Silencing GPR65 in primary CD4 T cells reduces GM-CSF production. GM-CSF and
GPR65 may thus serve as targets for therapeutic intervention of spondyloarthritis.

 S
pondyloarthritis encompasses a group of inflammatory
diseases with common pathologic and genetic features.
These disorders include ankylosing spondyltis (AS), reactive
arthritis (ReA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and enteropathic arthritis
(EA)1. The prevalence of spondyloarthritis is at least 0.5% in
European and US populations2,3. Only one third of patients
achieve disease remission with TNF inhibitor therapies, therefore
a significant unmet clinical need remains4–7.
Genetic, functional and therapeutic evidence implicates IL-17-
producing cells in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis8–10.
Within the CD4 T cell compartment, Th17 cells can be pleotropic
and, in addition to the classical “type 17” cytokines IL-17A, IL-
17F and IL-2211,12, can also produce IFN-γ13 and GM-CSF14.
Murine models of inflammation suggest that co-expression of
GM-CSF and IL-17A by CD4 T cells marks out a pathogenic
subset of Th17 cells14,15, and neutralisation of GM-CSF in the
Sagakuchi model of spondyloarthritis causes improvement in
joint inflammation15. Noster et al.16 have provided evidence that
GM-CSF and IL-17A are antagonistically regulated, but it is
unclear if the CD4/GM-CSF axis is acting within the context of
Th17 immunity or independently. Additional pathogenic markers
of murine Th17 cells include GPR6517, a receptor implicated in
the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis by genome-wide association
studies18 .
In addition to classical CD4 Th17s, CD161-expressing CD8
T cells19, γδ T-cells20, innate lymphoid cells21 (ILC) and B cells22
have also been shown to be producers of IL-17A and/or GM-CSF.
ILC are broadly divided into three groups; ILC1s express T-bet,
ILC2 express GATA3 and ILC3 express RORγt and are thought
to be involved in type 17 immunity23. ILCs are present in the
gut24, lung25 and skin26, and have been described in the joint in
psoriatic arthritis27. The contribution of ILCs to pathogenic
immune responses is still being actively investigated.
Here we show that multiple lymphoid populations (including
ILCs) express more GM-CSF in patients with spondyloarthritis.
Increased lymphocyte GM-CSF production occurs both in the
context of a polyfunctional type 17 response, but also indepen-
dently of IL-17A. Primary human GM-CSF-producing CD4 cells,
isolated using a multiple cytokine capture approach, show a
specific transcriptional profile that includes upregulation of
GPR65, and we identify a function for this receptor in CD4
lymphocyte
GM-CSF
production.
Therapeutic
targeting
of
GPR65 may potentially attenuate pathogenic T cells while pre-
serving physiological type 17 immunity.
Results
GM-CSF+ lymphocytes are increased in spondyloarthritis. We
first performed intracellular cytokine staining of ex vivo periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 38 patients with
axial spondyloarthritis fulfilling the assessment of spondyloar-
thritis (ASAS) criteria28, 14 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) matched for CRP, and 17 sex and age matched healthy
donors (Supplementary Table 1 shows patient characteristics,
Supplementary Fig. 1A shows flow cytometry gating strategy). IL-
17A+ CD4 cells (Th17 cells) were increased in spondyloarthritis
compared to both control groups (Fig. 1a, b). We then looked
within the Th17 compartment for the percentage of cells also
expressing GM-CSF (Fig. 1c). We observed a significant increase
in these GM-CSF+Th17 cells in spondyloarthritis compared to
healthy donors (p = 0.0031, Kruskal–Wallis) and RA inflamma-
tory disease controls (p = 0.0066, Kruskal–Wallis). IL-17A+GM-
CSF+ cells were also increased in CD8, γδ and CD56+ lymphoid
subsets in spondyloarthritis (Fig. 1d).
Next we looked at the percentage of cells producing GM-CSF
independently of IL-17A. We observed a significant expansion of
GM-CSF+IL-17A−
cells
in
both
CD4
and
CD8
cells
in
spondyloarthritis compared to the two control populations
(Fig. 1e, f), but saw no difference in the CD56 and γδ
compartments (Supplementary Fig. 1D, E), and no difference in
the percentage of IFN-γ+ cells was seen in the CD4, γδ and CD56
compartments
(Supplementary Fig. 1B–E). GM-CSF+
CD4
frequency was not affected by co-existent psoriasis or IBD
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). We did however note increased GM-
CSF+ CD4 T cells in patients on anti-TNF therapy, but even with
the exclusion of these patients from the analysis, GM-CSF+ CD4
cells were still elevated in spondyloarthritis compared to controls
(Supplementary Fig. 2B).
Phenotypic analysis showed that single-positive GM-CSF+
CD4+ cells expressed CCR6 and CD161 at similar frequencies
to single-positive IFN-γ+CD4+ cells, whilst double-positive IL-
17A+GM-CSF+ CD4+ cells more commonly expressed CCR6 and
CD161 (similar to single-positive IL-17A+CD4+ cells) (Fig. 1g).
We used Boolean gating to delineate the functional overlap of IL-
17A, IFN-γ and GM-CSF production by CD4 T cells in healthy
controls, spondyloarthritis and RA (Fig. 1h). In all three cohorts,
GM-CSF+ CD4 T cells overlapped with both Th1 and Th17 cells
but also existed independently of these two effector subsets. In
spondyloarthritis the overall GM-CSF pool was expanded both
independently and in combination with of Th1 and Th17.
Spondyloarthritis synovial T cells are enriched for GM-CSF.
Since spondyloarthritis is characterised by joint inflammation, we
next studied synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) from the
inflamed joints of 5 patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis
(Supplementary Table 2 shows patient characteristics). We
compared the cellular sources of GM-CSF in spondyloarthritis
PBMCs
and
SFMCs
using
time-of-flight
mass
cytometry
(CyTOF) using a panel of 20 surface and 11 intracellular markers.
We gated on all live GM-CSF+ events and performed an unbiased
clustering analysis of all parameters using viSNE29 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3A, C shows the CyTOF gating and validation of CyTOF
using flow cytometry). We observed CD4 cells to be the largest
population of GM-CSF-producing cell in both spondyloarthritis
peripheral blood and synovial fluid, with significant contributions
from CD8 and CD56 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). Both
SFMCs and (matched) PBMCs showed co-production of GM-
CSF with IL-17A, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10 and TNF (Fig. 2a, b lower
sets of panels) confirming and extending our observations in
Fig. 1h. We confirmed these data by flow cytometry for 5 addi-
tional
matched
PBMC/SFMC
spondyloarthritis
samples
(Fig. 2c–g). Figure 2c shows not only a marked increase in the size
of the CD4 GM-CSF production (>9-fold) in the joint relative to
the blood, but also that in this patient 89% of IL-17A+ synovial
CD4 T cells co-expressed GM-CSF. In this additional cohort of 5
patients, no significant expansion of IL-17A+ single-positive CD4
cells in the synovial fluid relative to the blood was seen. However,
both IL-17A−GM-CSF+ CD4 cells and double-positive IL-17A
+GM-CSF+ CD4 and CD8 cells were markedly increased in
spondyloarthritis synovial fluid relative to blood (Fig. 2f, g).
Additionally, synovial tissue cultures of CD4 T cells from
4 spondyloarthritis patients showed comparable high levels
(>30%) of GM-CSF production (Supplementary Fig. 4).
ILC3 are enriched in the inflamed joint and produce GM-CSF.
The presence of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in human joints has
recently been described in psoriatic arthritis, a form of spondy-
loarthritis27, and we next asked if GM-CSF is produced by these
cells. We obtained synovial tissue from 4 spondyloarthritis and 3
RA patients undergoing arthroplasty (Supplementary Table 2
shows
patient
characteristics)

 mononuclear cells by in vitro explant culture. The flow cytometry
gating strategy used to identify ILCs in blood and synovial tissue
cultures is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. Lineage-negative, IL-
7R+ cells were indeed present in the synovial tissue and produced
cytokines upon stimulation (Fig. 3a). The predominant ILC
population in spondyloarthritis tissue was C-KIT+ ILC3s, whilst
in the blood of healthy donors and spondyloarthritis patients
ILC1 cells were the predominant subset (Fig. 3b). Figure 3c, d
shows that GM-CSF was the most commonly produced cytokine
for both ILC1 and ILC3 subsets in the synovial tissue-derived
cells. In the synovial cultures, ILC1 showed reduced IFN-γ, while
ILC3 showed increased GM-CSF compared to peripheral blood

Fig. 5B–E).
GM-CSF CD4 cells have a distinct transcriptional profile.
Given
that
our
patient
and
control
data
suggest
that
GM-CSF+CD4+ may constitute a distinct functional subset, we
next asked if GM-CSF+ CD4 T cells have a distinct transcription
signature compared to classical IFN-γ+ Th1 cells and IL-17A+
Th17 cells. In the absence of known surface markers that define
these cells we developed a triple-cytokine capture assay (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6A, B shows cytokine capture-stained cells and
FACS sorting strategy). This allowed us to purify CD4 T cells
producing GM-CSF, IL-17A and IFN-γ both in isolation and in
combination. We FACS sorted to high purity (>95%) GM-CSF+,
IL-17A+ and IFN-γ+ single-positive cells, IL-17A+GM-CSF+
double-positive cells and cytokine-negative CD45RA+ naive CD4
T cells, from an initial cohort of 4 healthy donors. Normalised
RNAseq gene counts for IL17A, IFNG and CSF2 and for the
transcription factors RORC, TBX21 and PTPRC are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 6C. Unbiased hierarchical gene clustering
analysis of the 5 sorted subsets showed GM-CSF+ single positive
cells to cluster more closely with IFN-γ+ single positive cells while
IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-positive cells clustered with IL-17A+
single positives (Fig. 4a shows mean data, Supplementary Fig. 6E
shows all donors). Differential gene expression analysis (com-
pared to CD45RA+ T cells) showed GM-CSF single positive cells
to have a gene expression profile with both unique (Fig. 4a,
highlighted in red boxes) and shared features compared to IFN-γ
+ and IL-17A+ single-positive cells (Fig. 4b). Volcano plots with
the top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes in the GM-CSF+
(Fig. 4c) and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ (Fig. 4d) are shown in addition to
network analysis for these two subsets (Fig. 4e). Pathway analysis
for the genes common to GM-CSF+ CD4 cells in Fig. 4f showed
altered p53 signalling, glycolysis, Th17 and apoptosis pathways
(individual genes used to define each pathway are listed in Sup-
plementary Table 3).
GPR65 expression is associated with GM-CSF. Next we asked if
any genes selectively expressed in GM-CSF+ cells (both inde-
pendently and in combination with IL-17A) might have be
potentially pathogenic, integrating our RNA sequencing data with
eQTL and GWAS data sets (Fig. 5a). GPR65, a proton-sensing G-
protein coupled receptor was the fourth highest ranked gene
identified from our bioinformatics ranking analysis and was
upregulated in the GM-CSF+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ but not in
IL-17A+ cells. (Fig. 5c). GPR65 is in complete linkage dis-
equilibrium with a SNP associated with ankylosing spondylitis
through GWAS studies18 (Fig. 5b). Increased expression of
GPR65 in GM-CSF+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ was confirmed by
qPCR in a second independent cohort of capture-sorted cells
from 3 healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. 6D). Next we studied
expression of GPR65 in pooled Th17 cells from additional
spondyloarthritis patients, healthy donors and RA disease con-
trols. We purified ex vivo CD4 IL-17A+ cells by single cytokine
capture from 4 spondyloarthritis, 4 RA and 3 healthy controls.
Since we showed that in spondyloarthritis nearly 40% of Th17
cells co-expressed GM-CSF (Fig. 1c), we hypothesised that ex vivo
sorted Th17 cells from spondyloarthritis would have higher
expression of GPR65 compared to the control populations, and
this was confirmed in Fig. 5d. We silenced GPR65 in primary
human T cells (confirmed by qPCR, Supplementary Fig. 7A) and
observed a significant downregulation of GM-CSF but not IL-17A
(Fig. 5e, f). Since GPR65 is a known extracellular pH sensor30, we
cultured isolated primary human CD4 cells in media with a pH of
6.5 and observed a significant increase in GM-CSF production
(Fig. 5g).
IL-7 promotes expansion of GM-CSF in CD4 T cells. Since IL-7
has been previously been shown to be a driver of GM-CSF in a
STAT5 dependent manner in murine models, we sought to
investigate the effects of IL-7 on human CD4 cells. Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8A, B show that IL-7 enhances the GM-CSF production
by CD4 cells, with a doubling of the number of cells expressing
this cytokine. IL-7 had no effect on IL-17A, IL-22, IFN-γ, TNF or
IL-17A/GM-CSF
double-positive
cells.
Adding
recombinant
human IL-7 to explant synovial tissue cultures from patients with
inflammatory arthritis (Supplementary Fig. 8C) increased both
the percentage of GM-CSF+ CD4 cells and GM-CSF production
by ELISA. There was also a statistically significant increase (p =
0.03) in the percentage of IL-22+ cells but no difference in IFN-γ
+, IL-17A+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ cells. However, culture in the
presence of IL-7 did not increase expression of GPR65 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7B). Finally, we sought to investigate the down-
stream target of GM-CSF in ex vivo PBMCs and SFMCs from
spondyloarthritis patients by looking at pSTAT5 induction in
response to recombinant human GM-CSF. We observed a clear
induction of pSTAT5 in CD14 monocytes in the blood and
synovial fluid but no effect on CD4+, CD8+, CD56+ and CD20+
cells (Supplementary Fig. 8D).
Discussion
We here show that human spondyloarthritis is characterised by a
program of lymphoid GM-CSF production in multiple com-
partments, including CD4 and CD8 T cells, γδ and innate lym-
phoid cells (ILC). This overlaps with an expansion of “type 17”
cytokine production previously reported for CD49 and γδ20 cells
and confirmed by our data. Notably in spondyloarthritis, GM-
CSF production is increased both independently of, and in
combination with, IL-17A and IFN-γ. This, together with our
data showing that CD4 T cells from synovial fluid are further
enriched for GM-CSF production, suggests that the GM-CSF
programme may be a primary pathogenic process.
We also show increased numbers of lineage-negative IL-7R-
positive type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in inflamed joints,
and further show that ILC3 cells derived from the joint abun-
dantly produce GM-CSF upon in vitro stimulation, albeit after
in vitro culture. C-Kit-expressing ILC3 are thought to contribute
to the cytokine environment through the production of IL-17A
and IL-22 in response to tissue stress23,31, and have recently been
shown to produce GM-CSF in the gut24. We show that ILC1s are
also present in the joint and show a downregulation of IFN-γ
relative to blood. Thus, our data suggest that GM-CSF may be an
important mediator in both innate and adaptive immune
responses in spondyloarthritis.

 Several lines of evidence have suggested that T cell-derived
GM-CSF may be pathogenic in murine and human inflammatory
diseases. Neutralization of GM-CSF has been shown to be
effective in the Sagakuchi mouse model of spondyloarthritis15
and in EAE models of neuro-inflamation16, with a T cell specific-
GM-CSF knockout shown to be protected from disease32. GM-
CSF-mediated immunity has been implicated in several human
diseases. Elevated GM-CSF-producing T cells have been shown in
the joints of patients with Juvenile Inflammatory Arthritis33.
Moreover an increased percentage of GM-CSF+ CD4 T cells have
been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple
sclerosis (MS) compared to non-MS controls16, and CD4 and
CD8 T cells expressing GM-CSF have been shown to be elevated
in the peripheral blood of patients with MS34.
In this study, we observed GM-CSF production both inde-
pendently and in combination with Th17 subsets. Importantly,
we here show that the percentage of IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-
positive cells is greatly increased in the peripheral blood of
patients with spondyloarthritis, with further increases in the
ex vivo synovial fluid. Th17 cells co-expressing GM-CSF are
thought to be particularly pathogenic in animal models of
inflammatory disease17,35,36. Lee et al.35 showed pathogenic Th17
cells
to
be
dependent
on
IL-23
and
downstream
TGF-
β3 signalling, with Csf2 (GM-CSF) one of the key upregulated
genes in murine pathogenic Th17 cells. Csf2 was also shown
recently to be upregulated in pathogenic Th17 cells isolated from
the central nervous system of diseased experimental autoimmune
encephalitis (EAE) mice17.
Our flow cytometry, CyTOF and gene expression data suggest
that GM-CSF+ CD4 T cells have a distinct phenotypic and
transcriptional profile. Several reports have shown GM-CSF
production to be more aligned with a STAT5 rather than a
STAT3 programme16, with IL-7 implicated as a driver of STAT5-
mediated GM-CSF-driven inflammation in the mouse EAE
model37. Moreover, it has been shown that GM-CSF production
by CD4 T cells is influenced by IL-1β38,39, with GM-CSF in turn
acting via monocytes to boost IL-1β production40. We recently
showed that RORγt inhibition of human Th17 cells in vitro led to
suppression of IL-17A+ but not GM-CSF+ CD4 T cells in vitro,
suggesting GM-CSF can act independently of RORγt41. In the
absence of clear surface phenotypic markers to identify GM-CSF+
CD4 T cells and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-positive CD4 T cells,
our RNA sequencing data represent an important insight into the
transcriptional regulation of these cells. We show GM-CSF+ cells
to have a transcriptional profile that is distinct from IFN-γ+ and
IL-17A+ cells, supporting the concept that GM-CSF+ T cells may
be a distinct T-cell phenotype. Gene clustering analysis identified
distinct, as well as overlapping groups of differentially expressed
genes for both GM-CSF+ cells and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-
positive cells.
In this study, we observe the percentage of GM-CSF+ CD4 and
CD8 T cells in spondyloarthritis to be significantly higher than
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as healthy controls. Interest-
ingly, the percentage of GM-CSF+ CD4 cells was especially high
in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, suggesting that this
pathway is downstream of TNF. This increase in GM-CSF may be
due to the fact that anti-TNF treated patients represent a subset
with more aggressive disease requiring the need for biological
therapies. Alternatively, the effects of TNF blockade may lead to a
loss of negative feedback leading to an increase of GM-CSF. An
increase in Th17 numbers after anti-TNF has been previously
reported in RA42 and the two mechanisms may be similar.
Our data would support development of clinical trials of anti-
GM-CSF in spondyloarthritis, particularly in view of the safety
and efficacy already reported in RA43,44. Even though we did not
observe an increase in circulating GM-CSF+ lymphocytes in RA,
the efficacy of the anti-GM-CSF antibody in this disease may be
predominantly due to the local effects of GM-CSF in synovial

 tissue, where increased numbers of cells expressing the GM-CSF
receptor have been described in both RA and psoriatic arthritis45.
Additionally, in RA, GM-CSF has been shown to play a function
in inflammatory dendritic cell differentiation46.
We here show that both human GM-CSF-producing CD4
T cells, and GM-CSF+ Th17 cells are characterized by high levels
of GPR65 expression. GPR65 is G-protein coupled receptor with
an extracellular proton sensing domain47 associated with anky-
losing spondyloarthritis by GWAS18. Its function in immune cells
remains unclear. We show culture of primary human CD4 cells in
an acidic environment significantly upregulates GM-CSF while
silencing of GPR65 reduced GM-CSF. Notably, a low pH envir-
onment has been reported in the inflamed synovium48 . Of
interest, Gpr65 expression was upregulated in pathogenic murine
Th17 cells, with knockout protecting against EAE17. The upre-
gulation of GPR65 in ex vivo sorted spondyloarthritis Th17 cells
further validates a function for this receptor in driving pathogenic
T cell responses in human disease. Since silencing of GPR65 in

 human CD4 cells leads to a significant decrease in GM-CSF,
inhibition of GPR65 using small molecules might constitute a
promising therapeutic approach, in combination with or as an
alternative to current therapies, although the potential human
in vivo side effect profile of such agents remains to be determined.
Such an approach may potentially preserve the protective func-
tion of non GM-CSF secreting Th17 cells49.
Taken together, our data suggest an important function in
human spondyloarthritis for GM-CSF production by multiple
lymphocyte populations, including CD4, CD8 and γδ T cells and
ILCs, within the context of globally enhanced type 17 immunity.
GM-CSF-producing CD4 cells have a distinct transcriptional
profile, which includes expression of GPR65. Our data provide a
strong scientific rationale for clinical trials targeting GM-CSF in
spondyloarthritis
and
additionally
identify
further
targets
including GPR65 involved in this likely ‘pathogenic’ module.
Methods
Patient and control recruitment. Peripheral blood samples were recruited, fol-
lowing informed written consent, from patients attending the Oxford University
Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust (Ethics reference number 06/
Q1606/139, National Health Service, Health Research Authority, South Central—
Oxford C Research Ethics Committee). All spondyloarthritis patients met assess-
ment of spondyloarthritis international society (ASAS) criteria for axial spondy-
loarthritis28. Age and sex matched healthy donors and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
patients meeting American college of rheumatology/European league against
rheumatism 2010 criteria50 matched for C-reactive protein were recruited. Patient
and control characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Power calculation
was based on 3 pairwise comparisons and observed differences in frequency of
Th17 cells from a previous cohort of patients51. A minimum sample size of 11 was
needed for each group for power of 0.8 and type 1 error rate of 5%.
Synovial fluid from patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis as defined by
ASAS criteria28 or psoriatic arthritis as defined by classification criteria for psoriatic
arthritis (CASPAR) criteria52 were also recruited under the same ethics as the
peripheral blood cohort with informed written consent. Additional synovial tissue
samples from spondyloarthritis28 and RA50 patients were studied (ethics reference
number 09/H0606/11, National Health Service, Health Research Authority, South
Central—Oxford C Research Ethics Committee). Patient characteristics are shown
in Supplementary Table 2.
Flow cytometry. The cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (125 ng/
ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), in the presence of
Golgiplug (Brefeldin A) and Golgistop (Monensin) (both from BD Biosciences
diluted according to manufacturer’s instructions) and incubated for four hours at
37 °C in 5% CO2. Staining antibodies and dilutions shown in Supplementary
Table 4. The cells were stained on ice and in the dark for 20 min, then permea-
bilised using Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation and permeabilization solution (BD Bios-
ciences) for 30 min and stained for intracellular cytokines. Flow cytometry was
performed on a BD Fortessa calibrated daily with calibration and tracking beads
from BD Biosciences. The data were analysed using FlowJo software (Treestar).
CyTOF staining. A volume of 8 μl of 103Rh intercalator (Fluidigm) was added to
cells and incubated for a 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 μl staining
buffer containing surface antibody master mix and incubated for 20 min at room
temperature, washed, then re-suspended in 500 μl of fix buffer (Fluidigm-Maxpar)
and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were permeabilised using 2 ml
of perm-S-buffer (Fluidigm-Maxpar) and intracellular staining was performed for
30 min at room temperature. All antibodies used are listed in Supplementary
Table 5. Finally, cells were suspended in 500 μl of the 191Ir/193Ir intercalator and
incubated overnight. Equalisation beads (Fluidigm-Maxpar) were added at a
concentration of 1:10 and the sample was acquired on a CyTOF-1 machine.
Analysis of data was carried out using FlowJo software (Treestar) and Cytobank
software.
Cytokine capture. Fresh lymphocyte cones were obtained from the NHS blood
and transplant service and PBMCs obtained by density centrifugation. CD4 T cells
were isolated by negative selection (Miltenyi). The next day cells were stimulated
with phorbol myristate acetate (125 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 μg/
ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. Cells were stained on ice for 5 min with IL-17A, IFN-γ
and GM-CSF capture antibodies (all Miltenyi biotech) and incubated at 37 °C for
45 min. At 5 min intervals the mixture was resuspended. Cells were then placed on
ice to stop cytokine secretion and stained with MACS detection antibodies (IL-
17A-PE, IFN- γ -FITC, GM-CSF-Biotin) all at a concentration of 1:25 μl. In
addition, cells were also stained with CD45RA-PerCpCy5.5, CD3 BV605, CD4
BV421 and ef780 viability dye followed by with anti-biotin APC secondary. Sorting
was carried out using an automated cell sorter BD Aria. Cells were sorted at 4 °C
into tubes containing sterile PBS.
Synovial tissue cultures. Freshly obtained surgical material was re-suspended in
25 ml of sterile RPRMI immediately. The sample was placed in a large petri dish
and cut into 3–4 mm pieces by hand. 20–30 pieces of the sample were placed in a 6-
well plate containing 5 ml of warm of RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum
containing 100 IU/ml IL-2 (Peprotech) + IL-7 10 ng/ml (Peprotech). Volume of
2.5 ml of media was aspirated every 72 h and replaced with the same volume
containing IL-2 100 IU/ml + IL-7 10 ng/ml. After 14 days non-adherent cells were
washed off the plate and filtered through a 70 μm filter. Cells were counted, rested
overnight and stimulated in the morning for intracellular cytokine staining.
RNA extraction. The AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit (Qiagen, catalogue number
80224) was used for RNA extraction. FACS sorted cells were spun down and re-
suspended in 350 μl of RLTplus buffer and transferred to 2 ml tubes. Samples were
then stored at −80 °C for batched RNA extraction. Homogenisation of the sample
was carried out using the QIAshredder (Qiagen). DNase I was used during the
extraction protocol to minimise DNA contamination. RNA was eluted into 35 μl of
RNase-free water. The RNA amount was quantified by nano-drop and the RNA
samples stored at −80 °C for storage until ready for sequencing.
RNA sequencing. RNA sequencing was carried out at the Wellcome Trust Centre
for Human Genetics core facility. RNA underwent quality control testing using a
bioanalyser followed by cDNA library preparation. Paired end sequencing was
performed at 100 base pairs on each side of the DNA fragment on the HiSeq 4000
platform. Total of 20–80 million fragments were sequenced per sample.
Analytical methods. Prism version 6 was used for statistical analysis. Bioinfor-
matic analysis of RNA sequencing samples was carried out using validated
packages in R. Reads were mapped to human genome reference sequence GRCh37
with tophat253, deduplicated using samtools v.1.254. Gene counts were retrieved
using htseq-cout55 and the Ensembl gene annotation. DESeq256, an R package, was
used for differential gene expression analysis.
Pathway and network analysis. Genes common to IL-17A+GM-CSF+ and GM-
CSF+ were defined if they, as compared to naive CD45RA+ cells, were differentially
expressed (FDR <5%) in both IL-17A+GM-CSF+ cells and GM-CSF+ cells but not
in IL-17A+ cells. Pathway analysis was conducted using the XGR software to
identify enriched pathways (compiled from KEGG; June 2017). Network analysis
was performed using the dnet package to identify a gene network that contains
groups of interconnected genes. In brief, the dNetPipeline function in the package
took as inputs a list of common genes with the significance level (i.e., the per-gene
maximum FDR in both cells) and output a gene network (FDR <1%) from a
human gene interaction data (compiled from the STRING database; May 2017).
Fig. 4 GM-CSF positive CD4 cells have a distinct transcriptional profile. RNA was extracted from 5 FACS sorted CD3+CD4+ T-cell populations: CD45RA+
(IFN-γ−IL-17A−GM-CSF−), GM-CSF+, IFN-γ+, IL-17A+ and IL-17A+GM-CSF+ double-positive, of triple cytokine capture-labelled activated PBMCs from four

 Prioritisation of key genes. We applied an in-house prioritisation system using
random forest plot modelling57 to generate evidence scores prioritising key genes
involved in spondyloarthritis. We utilised GWAS summary data (risk variants and
their detected p-values) for susceptibility in spondyloarthritis58,59 and eQTL
summary data60,61 to prioritise the 1643 genes that were differentially expressed in
GM-CSF+ CD4 cells from our data set. We prioritised genes based upon the
relative weight of evidence of GWAS association and the eQTL significance level
linking a SNP to a gene.
Statistical analysis. Prism version 6 was used for statistical analysis. When
comparing two unpaired groups with normal distribution of data a two-tailed
unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis. When comparing two unpaired
groups with data that was not normally distributed a Mann–Whitney test was used.
For paired data, a paired t-test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests were
used for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. When comparing more
than two unpaired groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bon-
ferroni’s correction was used for parametric data. Where the data were not

 normally distributed a Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison
analysis was used for statistical analysis. For matched data with more than two
groups, a one-way ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction was performed in
parametric data sets. In non-parametric data a Friedman test, a Dunn’s multiple
comparison analysis was performed. Significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05.
