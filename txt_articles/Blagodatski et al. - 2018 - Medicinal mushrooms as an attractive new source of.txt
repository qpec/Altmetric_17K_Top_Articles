ABSTRACT
Medicinal mushrooms have been used throughout the history of mankind for 
treatment of various diseases including cancer. Nowadays they have been intensively 
studied in order to reveal the chemical nature and mechanisms of action of their 
biomedical capacity. Targeted treatment of cancer, non-harmful for healthy tissues, 
has become a desired goal in recent decades and compounds of fungal origin provide 
a vast reservoir of potential innovational drugs. Here, on example of four mushrooms 
common for use in Asian and Far Eastern folk medicine we demonstrate the complex 
and multilevel nature of their anticancer potential, basing upon different groups of 
compounds that can simultaneously target diverse biological processes relevant for 
cancer treatment, focusing on targeted approaches specific to malignant tissues. We 
show that some aspects of fungotherapy of tumors are studied relatively well, while 
others are still waiting to be fully unraveled. We also pay attention to the cancer types 
that are especially susceptible to the fungal treatments.
INTRODUCTION
Nature has since long been an important source of 
inspiration for the medicine. Throughout evolution, nature 
produces a vast diversity of biologically active substances, 
which possess enormous therapeutic potential, amongst 
other things regarding the treatment of cancers. Natural 
products have already yielded a series of compounds 
widely used in anticancer chemotherapy, whilst application 
of such products in folk and traditional medicine has 
always been an important clue pointing to potential new 
sources of compounds with therapeutic potential. Well-
known examples include camptothecin derived from the 
bark and stem of the tree Camptotheca acuminata used in 
Chinese traditional medicine [1], vinca alcaloids derived 
from Madagascan periwinkle [2] or taxanes derived from 
the Pacific Yew [3]. Nevertheless, such “first-generation” 
natural chemotherapeutic agents are directed mostly 
against housekeeping processes (such as DNA replication 
or microtubule polymerization and stabilization), which 
are more active against fast proliferating cancer cells, but 
are in no way cancer-specific. This results in a variety 
of harmful side effects in the conventional anticancer 
chemotherapy, up to eventual patient’s death due to 
overdose. More up-to-date approaches to cancer treatment 
involve targeted therapies specific to the hallmarks of 
cancer and harmless or of low harm to the healthy tissues 
[4]. Search for compounds able to selectively act on cancer 
cells or on tumorigenic processes is therefore a problem of 
the highest priority in the field. Thus, it is a task of great 
importance to “mine the treasury” of natural products for 
such compounds in order to expand the arsenal of modern 
oncology with a variety of highly specific tools.

Cancer fungotherapy is a promising scientific field, 
which deals with antitumor substances derived from 
mushrooms. It has been an integral part of the world 
traditional medicine since the antiquity [5].
The concept of fungal treatment officially appeared 
in Traditional Chinese Medicine and can be dated back 
to several thousand years ago [6]. The ancient Chinese 
pharmacopoeia included hundreds of herbal and fungal 
species - the latter were considered to be the most effective 
natural remedies for various types of tumors [6]. In other 
countries of East and Southeast Asia, mushrooms were 
also highly valued and rated as “beneficial to health” for 
centuries. Plant and fungal products were also widespread 
in Russia, representing the main medicinal resources until 
the 18th century [7].
In the middle of the 20th century, some of the 
earliest scientific research was performed on Boletus 
edulis in order to study the antitumor activity of edible 
and medicinal mushrooms [8].
Over the past 60 years, the rate of studies focusing 
on fungi increased exponentially, but in many areas of 
research mushrooms as potential source for beneficial 
products are still ignored. For instance, 90% of fungal 
species were never analyzed with respect to their antibiotic 
and antitumor activity. Moreover, a large part of cancer-
related investigations done on fungi deals merely with 
characterization of unspecific cytotoxic or cytostatic 
effects on cancer cells (such effects would be harmful 
for healthy cells as well), rather than with modulation of 
specific oncogenic signaling pathways, which could be 
targets for modern, highly specific anticancer therapies. 
Importantly, a tumor has many “weak spots” and can be 
targeted at different levels, such as tumor-specific pro-
proliferation signaling, regulation of apoptosis, cancer-
specific metabolism, angiogenesis, metastasis and, 
last but not least, modulation of the immune system. 
The peculiarity of medicinal mushrooms is that, being 
producers of hundreds of compounds, they can affect 
multiple cancer-related processes in synergistic ways 
when used as a treatment. Thus, not only studies of certain 
fungal-derived compounds are important, but also research 
on complex anticancer effects caused by the combinations 
of molecules in their extracts is of a high interest.
In this review, we intend to analyze the recent 
knowledge, potential to cover the abovementioned 
processes on the example of four Basidiomycota 
mushrooms: Fomitopsis pinicola, Hericium erinaceus, 
Trametes versicolor and Inonotus obliquus. The fields of 
cancer fungotherapy and of search for novel antitumor 
agents are by far not limited to these species; however, 
these four can serve as typical representatives of 
widespread medicinal mushrooms used both in traditional 
medicine and in modern biomedical research. They belong 
to three different orders, and are a rich source of bioactive 
compounds such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, 
glucans, terpenoids, steroids, cerebrosides and proteins, 
which can be used for treatment of various cancers (Table 
1). We chose these representatives to convexly illustrate 
the therapeutic potential of the fungi and fungal-derived 
products in relation to cancer and to inspire further 
interdisciplinary work at the junction of oncology and 
mycology, which should result in future discoveries of 
novel low-toxic drugs with highly specific antitumor 
activities.
Fomitopsis pinicola
Fomitopsis pinicola, class Agaricomycetes, order 
Polyporales, family Fomitopsidaceae (common name Red 
Belted Conk) (Figure 1), is a brown rot fungus, a member 
of Basidiomycota. It is saprotrophic on the dead wood of 
coniferous and broad-leaved trees, which are common 
throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere. [9].
F. pinicola fruiting bodies, which are considered to 
be nontoxic mushrooms in Europe [10], have been used in 
Korean folk medicine as hemostatic and anti-inflammation 
agents [10, 11]. F. pinicola is known to contain a variety 
of primary metabolites (such as polysaccharides) and 
secondary metabolites (such as triterpenes, esters, lactones 
and steroids) [12, 13]. Extracts and isolated compounds 
from F. pinicola have demonstrated various biological 
activities, including antioxidant [14-16], antimicrobial 
[10], anti-inflammatory [17], and cytotoxic [18, 19]. 
Regarding the antitumor potential of F. pinicola, there 
is not much data present, but a few existing studies 
motivate to expand the research in this direction. Indeed, a 
nonspecific cytotoxic activity on human cancer cells such 
as HeLa and hepatocarcinoma lines SNU 185 and SNU 
354 has been shown for the methanol but not for water 
extracts of F. pinicola [16].
Recently, more studies have been performed on F. 
pinicola extracts in a search for more specific anticancer 
activity. Chlorophorm extracts of the mushroom have 
demonstrated cytotoxicity, which was almost twice more 
specific to colorectal cancer cells (SW-480) than to control 
HEK293 cells. The cytotoxic effect took place through 
the ROS-mediated apoptotic mechanism. Moreover, the 
extracts were able to inhibit migration of the SW-480 
cells in scratch wound and transwell assays by means of 
downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases [20]. The 
authors claim that one (but not the only) of the acting 
compounds of the mushroom is ergosterol, for it was 
one of the major components of the extracts and could 
produce similar, although slighter effects on SW-480 
cells [20]. Another study has revealed the potential of 
F. pinicola ethanol extracts not only to induce apoptosis 
in various human and murine cancer cell lines, but also 
to significantly inhibit xenograft sarcoma-derived tumor 
growth in mice, along with prolongation of their survival 
time and absence of severe side effects, when given as a 
food supplement [21]. Interestingly, combined treatment 
of mice with the extract and a common chemotherapeutic

the tumor growth. Taken together, these findings provide a 
stronger evidence that apart from the unspecific cytotoxic 
compounds, F. pinicola contains substances possessing 
specific anti-oncogenic potential, probably acting through 
induction of apoptosis. Regarding the fact that F. pinicola 
is known as an anticancer agent in the Chinese folk 
medicine, we can conclude that this mushroom is of a

certain interest for modern drug discovery as a potential 
source of novel anticancer compounds, which are yet to 
be characterized. Although ergosterol has been pinpointed 
as one of the candidates, the exact chemical nature of the 
acting compounds is still elusive. Biomolecular profiling 
of inedible mushrooms has revealed an unusually high 
phenolic content in F. pinicola, when compared to the 
others [15] and polyphenols are known to be bioactive 
compounds with anti-oncogenic properties [22]. Thus, 
detailed studies on polyphenoles of F. pinicola is a 
promising task for biomedicine.
Hericium erinaceus
Hericium erinaceus, class Agaricomycetes, order 
Russulales, family Hericiaceae, is an edible medicinal 
mushroom (Figure 2). It is also known under the name 
“Lion's mane” in English, “Yamabushitake” in Japan or “ 
Hóutóugū ” in China. [23].
The mushroom is considered a saprotroph or a 
weak parasite. It is found on oak (Quercus) and beech 
(Fagus) in Europe, North America, Japan, Russia, and 
China. [24]. H. erinaceus has attracted special scientific 
attention in recent four years, being intensively studied 
in terms of its primary and secondary metabolites and 
their possible medicinal use. It yielded a number of 
compounds belonging to different classes with potential 
biological activity, which were tested against multiple 
targets [25-27]. Among the isolated compounds, certain 
were characterized, such as erinacines derived from the 
mycelium or hericenones derived from the fruiting bodies 
[27]. A significant part of research has been focused on 
neuroprotective properties of the mushroom, which are 
now extensively described in many works [28]. Another 
large area of possible therapeutic and anti-carcinogenic 
application of H. erinaceus is its salutary influence on the 
digestive organs, including stomach, liver, intestine and 
colon. Water and ethanol extracts of the mushroom have 
demonstrated growth inhibitory effects on gastric (NCI-
87), liver (HepG2 and Huh-7), and colon (HT-29) cancer 
cell lines in the MTT proliferation assay, with the highest 
efficacy against Huh-7 cells (IC50 of 0.8 mg/ml for the 
dried extract). Although not comparing these results with 
non-cancer cell lines of the respective tissues, the same 
study describes efficient application of the extracts against 
xenograft tumors formed by aforementioned cancer cell

lines in SCID mice. The extracts, given orally, have 
demonstrated a tumor suppressing activity similar to 
that of 5-fluoruracil, a most widely used drug clinically 
applied for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, 
but demonstrated a much lower general toxicity than 
5-fluoruracil [29]. Another study shows that water extracts 
of H. erinaceus, given as a food supplement, possess an 
anti-metastatic activity, strongly inhibiting the migration 
of CT-26 murine colon carcinoma cells to lungs after 
intravenous injection into BALB/c mice, reducing the 
formation of tumor nodules in the lung by about 50%, and 
preventing metastasis-caused increase in the lung weight. 
The mechanism of action involves suppression of matrix 
melalloproteinases 2 and 9, as well as suppression of ERK 
and JNK kinase activation, also decreasing the general 
tumor cell viability [30].
Further research on tumor suppressing activity of 
the H. erinaceus extracts allowed to reveal the possible 
spectrum of their action modes. Studies on CT-26 derived 
human colon cancer xenograft tumors in mice have shown 
a significant reduction in tumor growth after treatment by 
H. erinaceus water extracts. It has been demonstrated that 
the extracts stimulated the activities of natural killer cells 
and macrophages on one hand and blocked angiogenesis 
on the other [30]. All these activities could contribute to 
reduction of the tumor growth, although the anticancer 
properties of the complex extract may not be limited by 
them. Another study by the same group has demonstrated 
a pro-apoptotic effect of same water extracts on U937 
human monocytic leukemia cells in comparison to normal 
human and murine fibroblasts, as measured by flow 
cytometry. The mechanism of action is supposed to be 
down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-
xL(S), XIAP, and cIAPs), but not up-regulation of pro-
apoptotic ones [31]. Further concerning the exploration of 
the immunomodulatory potential of H. erinaceus, it can 
be stated that polysaccharide fractions of the mushroom 
ethanol extract and derivatives thereof are able to promote 
dendritic cell maturation and dendritic cell-mediated 
cytokine production and T-cell proliferation [32], as 
well as to activate macrophages and increase TNFα 
production [33]. Stimulatory effects on intestinal immune 
system, manifested mainly through increase of surface 
IgA expression and natural killer cell activation, have 
also been reported in mouse in vivo experiments, when 
the polysaccharide fraction of H. erinaceus was given as 
a food supplement [34]. Although these investigations 
give no clue upon the exact structural and chemical 
properties of the active polysaccharides, the idea of their 
immunomodulatory input into the anti-carcinogenic 
potential of H. erinaceus is very attractive.
Efforts to study anticancer effects of individual 
compounds isolated from H. erinaceus have produced 
impressive results. Cyanthine diterpenoid Erinacine A, 
a mycelial derivative of H. erinaceus, has demonstrated 
growth-inhibitory activities against different cancer cell 
lines and tumors related to the digestive tract. It was able 
to arrest the cell cycle through ROS-mediated activation 
of the oxidative stress response, initiating potentiation 
of the JNK1/2 MAPKs, p70S6K and mTOR pathways 
in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1. 
It also showed significant proliferation decrease of the

DLD-1 and other colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 in 
comparison to the normal human colonic epithelial cells 
when analyzed by the MTT assay. Finally, Erinacine A has 
demonstrated an in vivo inhibition of DLD-1 xenograft 
tumor growth in nude mice [35]. The anticancer activity 
of Erinacine A mediated by ROS accumulation has also 
been confirmed by comparative proteomic assays in 
human gastric cancer cell lines MKN28 and TSGH9201 
[36]. Further studies have also shed light on anti-invasive 
properties of Erinacin A, which it demonstrated on DLD-
1 and HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells in the Boyden 
chamber and scratch wound healing assays. Proteomic 
studies have revealed the actin-binding proteins cofilin-1 
and profilin-1 as downstream actors activated by the 
Erinacine A-induced ROS response and mediating the 
anti-invasive effect [37]. Another class of compounds 
common for fungi are cerebrosides, and here cerebroside E 
isolated from H. erinaceus has shown an ability to inhibit 
(although slightly) the tube formation in the HUVEC cell 
culture, thus being a potential angiogenesis blocker. This 
compound also revealed antitoxic properties, reducing the 
damage of LLC-PK1 kidney cells after cisplatin treatment 
in culture – properties that may suggest it for the use in 
complex cancer chemotherapies [38].
Interestingly, H. erinaceus is not merely a source 
of low molecular weight biologically active compounds, 
but also of some proteins that possess potential 
tumor-suppressive activities. Indeed, a Hericium-
derived protein HEP3, which demonstrated a complex 
immunomodulatory impact in mice, has also been able to 
strongly reduce growth of CC531 cell xenograft tumors 
after intraperitoneal injection. The immunomodulatory 
effect was induced through stimulation of the gut 
microbiota with the protein and involved activation of the 
proliferation and differentiation of T-cells and stimulation 
of the intestinal antigen-presenting cells [39]. Another 
example of bioactive protein from the same mushroom is 
a glycoprotein HEG-5 that was able to induce apoptosis 
in a gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901, stimulating the 
expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as p53, Bax, 
Caspase 8 and Caspase 3 [40].
Another possible, though indirect, activity of 
H. erinaceus, which can be relevant for the gastric 
cancer is the ability of the fungal extracts to remediate 
gastrointestinal ulcers which, on their turn, can be 
classified as carcinogenic conditions. H. erinaceus has 
been used to treat gastritis and gastroduodenic ulcer 
in the Chinese folk medicine [41]. Ethanol extracts of 
H. erinaceus have shown a cytoprotective effect after 
treatment of alcohol-induced gastric ulcers in rats [42]. 
H. erinaceus is also able to inhibit growth of Helicobacter 
pylori, the bacterium known to be the causative agent for 
gastritis and ulcer. Analyses of petroleum ether extracts of 
the mushroom have been performed, showing ability of the 
extracts to suppress the growth of six Helicobacter pylori 
strains in the microdilution assay and in the disk diffusion 
assay in vitro. Separation of the extracts yielded two active 
compounds, namely the 1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-
3-methyl-1-butanone and the 2,5-bis(methoxycarbonyl)
terephthalic acid, which were responsible for the 
inhibitory activity [43]. A polysaccharide composed 
of glucose, mannose, and galactose isolated from the 
cultured mycelia of H. erinaceus [44] was able to show 
antioxidant properties on gastric mucosa cell line GES-
1 after hydrogen peroxide treatment, which makes this 
polysaccharide a good candidate for one of components 
responsible 
for 
the 
mushroom's 
gastroprotective 
effect [45].
Regarding the overall anticancer potential of 
Hericium erinaceus, it can be stated that this medicinal 
mushroom possesses a complex of active compounds, 
which are able to block tumorigenesis at different stages 
and by different mechanisms; most of them are confirmed 
by both cell culture and xenograft experiments. It has 
been demonstrated that H. erinaceus extracts or fractions/
components thereof exhibit: (i) immunostimulatory 
activities, (ii) anti-metastatic activities through inhibition 
of matrix metalloproteinases, (iii) gastro- and intestine-
protective activities, (iv) antioxidant potential, (v) pro-
apoptotic activities, (vi) inhibition of angiogenesis. 
This spectrum of anticancer properties is provided by 
different compounds: polysaccharides, lipids, terpenoids 
(including unique erinacines), and even proteins. Thus, 
two possible strategies of application of H. erinaceus to 
cancer treatment are possible: studies on the complex 
action of the extracts on patients with their further use 
as cancer-preventive food supplements, and the detailed 
investigation of compounds isolated from the mushroom 
and their mechanisms of action for using them in targeted, 
personalized anticancer therapy of the future. Up to date, 
most of the cancer-related research of the mushroom has 
focused on (though not limited by) gastrointestinal tumors. 
Many preclinical trials on tumor-bearing mice indicate 
H. erinaceus as a promising candidate for therapeutic 
use in this field. Nevertheless, up to date no clinical 
trials on the mushroom or compounds thereof exist, 
moreover, many active compounds are still unidentified, 
and many mechanisms of their action remain elusive. 
Thus, Hericium erinaceus is a relatively well-studied 
medicinal mushroom possessing a much larger therapeutic 
potential for the future compared to its currently exploited 
applications. Regarding the possibility to culture this 
mushroom on industrial scale [46], it has a great chance to 
become a part of modern natural products-based medicinal 
biotechnology.

on the trunks of living birch trees in the colder northern 
climates [47].
I. obliquus has long been used in folk medicine 
for cancer treatment in Russia, China, Korea and Japan 
[48-50]. Water extracts of I. obliquus have demonstrated 
cytotoxic and antimitotic activity on HeLa cells [51]. 
Extracts obtained from the mushroom by submerged 
fermentation induced apoptosis in the human colorectal 
carcinoma cell lines HCT-116 [52] and HT-29 [53]. 
Similar low-specific cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects of 
the Chaga extracts were reported on human colon cancer 
cells [53] and liver cancer HepG2 cells [54] without, 
however, elucidating the mechanisms of action. In vivo 
experiments with I. obliquus extracts have provided data 
on reduction of tumor growth by induction of apoptosis 
in human melanoma B16-F10 cells-derived xenografts in 
mice [55]. Growth of human Sarcoma-180 cells-derived 
xenografts was as well suppressed by different sub-
fractions of the Chaga extract [56].
Regarding the anticancer potential of individual 
compounds of I. obliquus, several groups can be 
highlighted for this mushroom. Unique lanostan-type 
triterpenoids inonotodiol and inonotsuoxides have revealed 
anti-carcinogenic effects in vivo using the mouse skin [48, 
57] and human leukemia-derived mouse xenograft tumors 
[58]. Low molecular weight polyphenolic compounds 
demonstrated a topoisomerase II inhibiting activity leading 
to growth reduction in cultured human colon HCT116 
carcinoma cells, identifying these polyphenoles as 
putative anticancer chemotherapeutic agents [59]. Another 
Chaga-derived polyphenol, 3,4-dihydroxybenzalacetone, 
inhibited the NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent 
gene expression in a panel of human cancer cell lines 
through blockade of IκBalpha (a subunit of NF-kappaB) 
phosphorylation and inhibition of NF-κB activity followed 
by suppression of synthesis of TNF-induced and NF-κB-
dependent proliferative, anti-apoptotic and pro-metastatic 
gene products. These effects led to increase of TNF-
induced apoptosis and decrease of TNF-induced invasion 
[60]. As Hericium erinaceus, the Chaga mushroom is 
extremely rich in polysachharides, which may perform 
immunomodulatory functions and inhibit tumorigenesis. 
In vivo trials of different Chaga-derived polysaccharides 
with different mouse xenograft tumor models have 
demonstrated reduction of tumor growth along with 
immunostimulatory effects [61-63]. Polysaccharides 
from I. obliquus have also demonstrated anti-metastatic 
activities and inhibition of migration in cancer cell culture 
experiments, by blocking the expression and activity of 
matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 via suppression of 
MAPKs, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways 
[64, 65]. It is also important to highlight that the Chaga 
mushroom contains ergosterol peroxide that has been 
reported to inhibit growth of several human colorectal 
cancer cell lines and of colon tumors in a mouse model 
through the mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
downregulation [66]. This is particularly important, 
because over-activation of this pathway is a cause of many 
cancer types, such as colon, liver and breast and, moreover, 
is highly specific to cancer in adult patients being virtually 
inactive in healthy tissues [67]. Nevertheless, it has to be 
pinpointed that the most recent studies confirm the Wnt/β-
catenin-inhibitory properties of the Chaga mushroom but 
indicate other major compound as the active one, namely 
Figure 3: The anticancer properties of Inonotus obliquus. Effects of different mushroom derivatives and their mechanisms of

the inotodiol, which efficiently suppressed Wnt-dependent 
breast cancer proliferation under diabetic conditions 
in a rat model [68]. As ergosterol is also found in other 
medicinal mushrooms including Fomitopsis pinicola 
discussed above, it can be one of important components 
of targeted cancer fungotherapy in general. Recent HPLC-
tandem mass-spectrometry study of Chaga mushrooms 
derived from France, Canada and Ukraine suggests that 
the Chaga of French origin is the most rich on betulin 
and betulinic acid, whereas Canadian Chaga is more rich 
on inotodiol [69]. Taken together, the Chaga mushroom 
can be regarded as a very promising but somewhat 
understudied species, because in spite of its broad use in 
folk medicine and of promising activities of extracts and 
certain compounds against cancer in vitro and in vivo, not 
many exact mechanisms of action are determined and no 
clinical trials on human patients have been performed.
Trametes versicolor
Trametes 
versicolor, 
class 
Agaricomycetes, 
order Polyporales, family Polyporaceae (Figure 4), is a 
medicinal mushroom also known as Coriolus versicolor or 
Polyporus versicolor, “Yun-Zhi” in China, “Kawaratake” 
in Japan, and “Turkey tail mushroom” in English. This 
fungus has been used as a therapeutic agent worldwide 
[70]. It grows on tree trunks throughout the world in many 
diverse climates, including North America [71].
A solid body of data exists on T. versicolor 
cytotoxic, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic actions on various 
cancer cell lines. Water-ethanol extracts of the mushroom 
caused the proliferation inhibition on three human 
breast cancer cell lines (T-47D, ZR75-30 and MCF-7), 
human cervical cancer cell line Bcap37, human B-cell 
lymphoma (Raji), human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-
60, NB-4), and human liver cancer cell line 7703 [72, 
73]. Such results do not prove anticancer function per se, 
but provide some clues and fit well within the context of 
other, more detailed data. Other studies have shown anti-
proliferative effects of an aqueous extract of T. versicolor 
on human breast cancer (4T1), prostate cancer (DU145), 
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), when compared to 
rat normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6), and African 
green monkey normal kidney (Vero) cell lines using the 
MTT assay. The results demonstrated that the T. versicolor 
extract was able to inhibit proliferation of DU145 and 4T1 
cell lines in a dose-dependent way. The extract however 
did not exert any significant anti-proliferative effect on 
HCC, IEC-6, and Vero cell lines (IC50>1000 μg/ml), 
showing its selective cytotoxicity for certain types of 
cancer and its safety for normal cell lines. Studies of the 
T. versicolor ethanol extract effects on human prostate 
cancer cell lines have demonstrated the selectivity towards 
inhibition of growth of the androgen-responsible cell line 
LNcAP, while producing slight or no effect on hormone-
independent lines PC-3, DU-145, and JCA-1 [74].
Separation of T. versicolor extracts has yielded 
many fractions and compounds, exhibiting targeted 
impact on cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. The most 
remarkable among them is the polysaccharide fraction 
which, along with some isolated carbohydrates and 
proteoglycans, possessed complex immunomodulatory 
potential similar to that of Hericium erinaceus and 
relevant for the anticancer treatment. As a recent example, 
a new glucan has been isolated from this mushroom by 
hot water extraction and subsequent chromatographic 
purification and has demonstrated an ability to 
significantly inhibit the xenograft sarcoma growth in 
mice [75]. Most clinically relevant representatives of T. 
versicolor-derived polysaccharides are the β-glucan-
based polysaccharopeptide fraction (PSP) and the 
polysaccharide fraction known as Krestin (PSK) [76]. 
Both have underwent excessive clinical and preclinical 
studies as immunotherapeutic anticancer agents [77]. 
Immunotherapy employing PSP has already become 
a routine clinical practice in Japan since 1977 and in 
China since 1987. PSP activates cells of the immune 
system, boosts production of cytokines and chemokines 
such as TNFα, interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6), histamine, 
and prostaglandin E, stimulates dendritic and T-cell 
infiltration into tumors and reduces the harmful side 
effects of chemotherapy [78]. Some studies have been 
performed to reveal the mechanism of PSP interaction 
with the immune system. Experiments on peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients have shown 
that PSP drives cytokine expression through activation of 
the TLR4-TIRAP/MAL-MyD88 signaling pathway [79]. 
It has also been found out that PSP treatment leads to 
increased proliferation of the peripheral blood monocytes, 
but does not directly affect the proliferation of T, B, and 
NK cells [80]. Nevertheless, orally given combination 
of PSP with acaccia resin as an adjuvant has led to a 
significant increase of a hapten-induced specific T-cell 
dependent B-cell response in mice, suggesting a complex 
mechanism of PSP action [81]. The T. versicolor-derived 
polysaccharide Krestin is an even more widespread and 
better-studied immunomodulator used for anticancer 
treatment. It is able to activate different types of immune 
cells. PSK has shown the ability to stimulate dendritic cells 
through the TLR2 receptor in vitro and to inhibit breast 
cancer growth in the mouse model with the antitumor 
effect dependent on CD8+ T-cell and NK cells, but not 
CD4+ T-cells. PSK did not inhibit tumor growth in TLR2-
/- demonstrating that it is a specific TLR2 agonist and 
has potent antitumor effects via activation of both innate 
and adaptive immunity [82, 83]. In another study, PSK 
enhanced the effect of trastuzumab-mediated anti-breast 
cancer therapy when given orally, activating the NK cells 
both directly and via interleukin-12 [84]. PSK has also 
been able to activate murine macrophages via the TLR4 
pathway, inducing TNFα and IL-6 secretion by wild type 
but not by TLR4-deficient peritoneal macrophages [85]. It

as well potentiated docetaxel-induced tumor suppression 
and antitumor immune response in an immunocompetent 
murine model of human prostate cancer [86]. Recent 
studies indicate that the TLR2 agonist in PSK is a lipid 
component, which acts cooperatively with the protein-
bound β-glucan [87].
Interestingly, a protein YZP purified from 
T.versicolor has demonstrated a related ability: specific 
triggering of differentiation of CD1d+ B cells into IL-10-
producing regulatory B-cells, which promote the anti-
inflammatory function [70]. It is also worth-mentioning 
that PSK has been shown to downregulate the over-
activated Hedgehog signaling cascade under hypoxic 
conditions and to suppress the malignant phenotype 
in pancreatic cancer in vitro and in mouse models 
[88]. This may be extremely important, for Hedgehog 
upregulation is a well-known hallmark of many cancer 
types and a desired therapeutic target [89]. Here we, 
again, observe a complex and synergistic action of several 
chemically diverse compounds from the same fungal 
species. Nevertheless, results on clinical trials exist that 
do not prove high therapeutic efficacy of PSK in human 
patients. Indeed, in Japan, PSK has been used for adjuvant 
immunotherapy against gastric cancer. Patients with stage 
II/III gastric cancer who underwent a surgical resection 
were included into a retrospective study. All patients 
received oral fluorinated pyrimidine anti-metabolites with 
or without PSK after the operation, and no significant 
difference between the control and the PSK group in 
relapse free survival was detected [90]. Such examples 
reflect that not all data obtained in model systems are 
applicable to real clinical practice, and cancer therapies 
have to be chosen very carefully to yield the desired 
effects. Successful applications of PSK in human patients 
have been demonstrated when the polysaccharide was 
applied to treat lung cancer. Different sets of data on 
non-randomized and randomized controlled clinical trials 
exist that show improvement of various survival measures 
including median survival and 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival, 
improvement of immune function and reduction of tumor-
associated symptoms [91]. In any case, larger and more 
rigorous randomized controlled trials for PSK in lung 
cancer patients have to be performed [91].
Alongside the lung cancer, T. versicolor-derived 
products are clinically applicable for the treatment of 
breast cancer [71]. Many studies and some clinical trials 
exist that describe the effect of the mushroom in animal 
models and human patients. Thus, a natural dietary 
supplement BreastDefend, which contains extracts from 
medicinal mushrooms including T. versicolor, inhibits 
proliferation and metastasis formation by the MDA-
MB-231 invasive human triple-negative breast cancer

cells in culture and suppresses their growth and breast-to 
lung cancer metastasis in a xenograft mouse model [92]. 
There are single-case reports [93] and Phase I clinical 
trial results [86] confirming that T. versicolor-based 
treatment may be used as a supplement to conventional 
anti-breast cancer therapy and lead to improvements of 
the immune status in immunocompromised breast cancer 
patients following standard primary oncologic treatment. 
The mushroom preparations are widely used in up-to-
date integrative oncology and prescribed to patients on a 
regular basis [94].
In general, T. versicolor can be characterized as 
a medicinal mushroom, which is most actively used 
in modern medicine in terms of anticancer treatment 
compared to the other species discussed in this review. It 
is mostly used as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, 
with data on clinical trials available, and has led to 
development of several commercial medicines, mostly 
acting as activators of the immune cells by the mushroom 
polysaccharide fractions through Toll-like receptors. 
Nevertheless, data on selective growth inhibition of 
certain cancer cell lines in culture, without any immune 
cells involved, suggest that there may be other specific 
mechanisms of action at play, besides the ones described 
before.
CONCLUSIONS
The complex anticancer potential of medicinal 
mushrooms may be embodied not only through 
inhibition of certain cancer-specific processes or targeted 
activation of tumor-specific apoptosis, but also through 
indirect actions such as immunomodulation [95]. The 
polysaccharide-mediated antitumor immunomodulatory 
action seems to be rather common for many medicinal 
mushrooms and gives a major input into the therapeutic 
potential of at least three out of the four reviewed species, 
which is probably determined by similar carbohydrate 
composition and thus similar effects on the immune 
system of different mushrooms. Extrapolating these data, 
we can suppose that other, less studied, polysaccharide-
rich mushroom species could possess similar or even 
superior immuno-stimulatory properties. Moreover, some 
of additional biological activities can be used for cancer 
prevention, diminishing the risk of tumorigenic conditions; 
to such activities we can attribute antioxidant, antibacterial 
and anti-inflammatory properties. That is why research 
on whole fungal extracts (sometimes reaching to the 
clinical trials) and even on extracts of complex mixtures 
of different medicinal mushrooms [96] are the important 
part of the given research field.
The four mushrooms reviewed in this article 
illustrate different stages of natural product-derived 
drug development. Each medicinal plant or fungus 
undergoes multiple stages of extraction, fractionation 
and purification of active compounds. At the same time 
these extracts, fractions and compounds are tested against 
different cancer models, from tumor-derived cell lines 
to animal models and clinical trials. Another dimension 
is studying the mechanisms-of-action and targets of 
the natural products and their derivatives. Maximum 
progress in all these trials brings us closer to a perfect 
natural drug for targeted cancer therapy. The mushroom 
discussed first in our review, Fomitopsis pinicola, is 
closer to the initial stages of involvement into modern 
cancer treatment: it is known to possess certain anticancer 
activities, and a set of compounds were isolated, but 
experiments on animal models and clinical trials are 
lacking, as well as precise studies on the molecular 
targets and signaling pathways affected by the fungus. 
Inonotus obliquus is a better-studied mushroom: here 
we have more data on mouse xenograft experiments 
and more molecular targets, including the Wnt/β-catenin 
pathway, a promising target for anticancer drugs of the 
future, but the medical relevance is still to be improved 
by clinical trials. Hericium erinaceus and especially 
Trametes versicolor are much more advanced in terms 
of medical applications due to their uncovered strong 
and complex immunomodulatory potential provided by 
rich polysaccharide and proteoglycan diversity. There are 
numerous clinical trials confirming applicability of these 
mushrooms and their extracts as components of modern 
anticancer chemotherapy. But the complex modes of 
action and molecular targets as well as exact structures 
of the active molecules from these mushrooms still have 
to be studied in more detail. In general, there has been 
a strong progress in the field of medicinal mushroom 
research in terms of anticancer drug development, but 
this work continues and much more progress still awaits 
us, especially in the fields of molecular targets of the 
medicinal mushrooms and the complex synergistic 
interplay of their different components.
