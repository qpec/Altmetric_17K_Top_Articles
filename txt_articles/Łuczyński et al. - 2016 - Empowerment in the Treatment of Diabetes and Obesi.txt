As the available therapies for diabetes and obesity are not effective enough, diabetologists and educators search for new methods
to collaborate with patients in order to support their health behaviors. The aim of this review is to discuss perspectives for
the development of new empowerment-type therapies in the treatment of diabetes/obesity. Empowerment is a process whereby
patients gain the necessary knowledge to influence their own behavior to improve the quality of their lives. It is carried out in
five stages: (1) identify the problem, (2) explain the feelings and meanings, (3) build a plan, (4) act, and (5) experience and assess
the execution. Although many years have passed since the advent and popularization of the concept of empowerment, the area
remains controversial, mainly with regard to the methodology of therapy. Some previous studies have confirmed the positive effect
of empowerment on body weight, metabolic control, and quality of life of patients with type 2 diabetes; however, few studies have
been conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes. There is still a need to confirm the effectiveness of empowerment in accordance
with Evidence Based Medicine by performing long-term observational studies in a large group of patients. In future, empowerment
may become part of the standard of care for patients with diabetes and/or obesity.
1. Introduction
Diabetes is one of the most threatening diseases of the
21st century, with epidemiological data indicating that its
incidence is increasing [1]. The disease and its treatment are
strongly associated with patients’ health behavior, as well
as their lifestyle and psychosocioeconomic status. Since the
available collaboration techniques are not effective enough,
new ways to communicate with patients are required in
order to support their health behaviors. These new methods
should empower patients to take responsibility for their own
health and lifestyle. The aim of this article is to discuss
the perspectives for the development of empowerment-type
therapies, a new approach involving cooperation between
the patient with diabetes and/or obesity and health care
professionals.
2. Treatment of Diabetes Remains
a Huge Challenge
In both type 1 and 2 diabetes, taking medication, a healthy
lifestyle, diet, and exercise are essential parts of therapy that
affect patients’ quality of life. Traditionally, the treatment
success in patients with diabetes was measured by adherence
to medical recommendations. The plan of self-control was
adjusted to the patients’ illness and not to their priorities,
objectives, possibilities, and lifestyle. It is very difficult for
patients with diabetes to comply with all medical recom-
mendations and maintain constant normoglycemia [2], even
though they are aware of the long-term complications result-
ing from chronic hyperglycemia. As a result, we often observe
continuous stress in both the patient and the health care
professionals.
Another issue in diabetes treatment is that implementing
complex diabetes therapy requires training of the patient
and/or the caregiver. The educational programs currently
used to train patients and caregivers in diabetes management
are diverse, despite the similar topics and issues [3]. It is also
important to note that focusing education programs closely
on the medical knowledge and physiology of diabetes alone
does not guarantee the correct treatment [4]. Patients must
also be willing to make changes to the lifestyle and/or diet and
to consistently take any prescribed treatment. What is needed
is the unification and standardization of training in diabetes

management, including those concerning empowerment and
involvement. Such actions should result in more effective
teaching and, ultimately, an improvement of metabolic con-
trol and decreased long-term complications of diabetes.
3. Empowerment Is a New Approach to
the Treatment of Diabetes and Obesity
Funnell et al. defined empowerment in 1991 as “a process
whereby patients have the knowledge and self-awareness nec-
essary to influence their own behavior and that of others in
order to improve the quality of their lives” [5]. This is a change
from a paternalistic model to a more equal relationship
between the patient and the health care professional. Patient
empowerment is a therapeutic technique focused on the
patient, in which the patient becomes willing and able to take
responsibility for their own life [6]. Empowerment is more
than intervention, technique, or strategy; it is a vision to help
people to change their behavior and make decisions beneficial
to their health. The potential of empowerment is huge; it may
change the behavior of not only individuals, but also entire
populations and communities. Therefore, empowerment-
type therapies can improve the health of entire societies.
The three main pillars of empowerment used in the
treatment of diabetes are the belief that (1) diabetes is a
patient-managed disease; (2) care for a patient with diabetes
should be conducted as education, that is, to provide the
necessary knowledge for the patients to make their own
decisions; and (3) patients should identify and implement
their own treatment goals, which have a real impact on their
lives.
The overall aim of empowerment is to provide the
patient with critical thinking skills and the ability to make
autonomous, informed decisions. Furthermore, empower-
ment facilitates and supports the patients’ reflection on their
experience of living with diabetes. Reflection occurring in
the doctor-patient relationship (which is characterized by
psychological safety, warmth, cooperation, and respect) is
essential for independent, positive changes in behavior, emo-
tions, and attitude. In summary, the patients are encouraged
to become active participants of self-care, and health care
professionals should facilitate this process.
4. Methodology of Empowerment Therapy
In recent years, the number of publications highlighting
the importance of empowerment as a way to encourage
people to take control and responsibility for managing their
health has increased. Despite the many articles in the field
of empowerment, including in the field of diabetes, there is
no agreement from the scientific community concerning the
definition, objectives, and methods of conducting this type
of therapeutic support [7]. However, in most cases before
implementing an empowerment-type approach, the health
care professionals must first assess the patient’s readiness to
change.
4.1. Assessment of Readiness to Change: The Use of Diabetes
Empowerment Scale. Currently, the readiness of patients with
diabetes to change is assessed using the Diabetes Empower-
ment Scale (DES) and two forms are in use: the full version
(28 questions) and the short version (DES-SF, 8 questions)
[8]. The DES consists of three parts: (1) managing the
psychosocial aspect of diabetes, (2) assessing dissatisfaction
and readiness to change, and (3) setting and achieving a
diabetes goal. The advantage of this questionnaire is its
simple construction, which allows the patients to complete
it themselves. In our experience, however, the meanings of
questions within the DES form often need to be explained to
patients, which may affect the obtained data.
The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) has shown suffi-
cient internal consistency, construct validity, reproducibility,
factorial construct validity, and concurrent validity among
patients with type 2 diabetes [9]. The results of the DES corre-
late with age, level of education, disease duration, educational
program of diabetes applied, and metabolic control [10, 11].
In a study conducted in a population of Chinese patients
with type 2 diabetes, the results of the DES-SF helped predict
patients’ self-control (assessed according to the Diabetes Self-
Care Activities Scale), including diet, physical activity, blood
glucose monitoring, medication, taking care of the feet, and
metabolic control [12]. The advantage of these studies is the
large number of participants. In the BENCH-D study, 2,390
patients with type 2 diabetes were evaluated in terms of
the DES-SF [13]. Patients who obtained a result in the top
quartile of the DES-SF were younger, more often male, with
a higher level of education, better metabolic control, and
lower rate of long-term complications compared to patients
from other quartiles [13]. Being in the top quartile of the
DES-SF also correlated with the results obtained for other
surveys, including improved self-control, satisfaction from
the treatment of diabetes, and person-centered communi-
cation, as well as decreased stress levels. At the same time,
significant differences in this regard were noted among the
various centers treating diabetes.
The Swedish version of the DES questionnaire showed
a correlation between higher diabetes empowerment and
longer diabetes duration in adult patients with type 2 diabetes
[14]. Women reported a greater need for support than men,
and working persons reported greater need for support than
retired ones [14]. In addition, persons living with a family had
a higher perception of requiring support from relatives than
those living alone [14]. The DES has also been used in patients
with prediabetes, where it was shown that both self-efficacy
and perceptions of the empowerment process determined the
health behavior [15]. Interestingly, diabetes empowerment
ability (evaluated with DES-FS) and not HbA1c/diabetes
complications was a predictor of quality of life among patients
with type 2 diabetes in China [16].
In summary, before training and possible reeducation
during the years of care occurs, the health care profession-
als/educators should assess patients’ readiness to change with
the DES survey.
4.2. Principles of Empowerment Therapy. If a patient is willing
to change, an empowerment-type therapy should be per-
formed. The stages of therapy are shown as follows.
 Journal of Diabetes Research
3
Stages of the Empowerment Therapy by Funnell and Anderson
[17]
Stage I: Identify the Problem
(1) What is the hardest thing about taking care of your
diabetes?
(2) Tell me about it.
(3) Give examples.
Stage II: Explain Feelings and Meanings
(1) What do you think about this?
(2) Why do you think so?
(3) How do you think, why is it so?
Stage III: Build a Plan
(1) What do you want?
(2) How could the current situation be changed to make
you feel better?
(3) Where do you want to be on this after some time (1,
3, 12 months)?
(4) What are the options for your conduct?
(5) What are the barriers to your goal?
(6) Who can help you?
(7) What are the costs and benefits of each of your
choices?
(8) What happens if you do nothing?
(9) How important is it to do something with this on a
scale from 1 to 10?
(10) Build an action plan.
Stage IV: Action
(1) Do you want to do what is necessary to solve the
problem?
(2) What are the stages of actions that could be carried
out?
(3) What do you intend to do?
(4) How will you know that you have achieved a success?
(5) What will you do right after leaving here?
Stage V: Experience and Assess the Execution of Your Plan
(1) How did it go?
(2) What have you learned?
(3) What are the obstacles encountered?
(4) What, if anything, would you do differently next time?
(5) What will you do after leaving here?
Empowerment allows the patient to gain/regain control
over their life; the process helps recognize, promote, and
strengthen the capacity of the patients to be responsible for
their own lives. This approach recognizes that although health
care professionals/educators have expert knowledge of the
disease, this does not mean they have expert knowledge
of the patient’s life. In the course of therapy, the patient
becomes a well-informed, active partner in their own care,
and the health care professional is given the task of helping
the patient in decision-making to achieve the patient’s goals
and overcome learning barriers.
During empowerment therapy, health care professionals
should listen to the patients and ask questions about what
the patient needs from them to better manage their diabetes.
Health care professionals should stop being responsible for
patients and become responsible to them. In addition, health
care professionals should show that they care first about the
patient as an individual and secondly about their diabetes.
The patient, in turn, must understand their role as the
person making decisions and take responsibility for them.
Furthermore, health care professionals must abandon the
illusion that they have control over their patients, including
their decisions on glycemic control and effects of therapy.
Many health care professionals will be pleased with this type
of action, that is, those who define success as creating a
relationship with the patient. While developing a relationship
with the patient takes more time, this approach increases the
efficiency of the visit and may reduce the overall number of
visits in the long term. For example, compared to routine
consultations, in the Empowerment, Motivation and Med-
ical Adherence (EMMA) program, doctors spoke less and
patients more, and modern communication tools were used
[18]. This approach resulted in effective education, acceptance
by patients, and building a relationship with the therapeutic
team [18]. The main difficulty in the EMMA program was the
realization of consultations at the scheduled time [18]. It is
also feasible to train and graduate peer leaders among adults
with diabetes for diabetes self-management support (DSMS)
interventions [19]. Therefore, successful empowerment ther-
apy requires a team approach, in which all members must
contribute and be willing to change. Lately, it has been shown
that psychological skills training for nurses can have a positive
impact on patient care including empowerment [20].
Questions about the type of therapy (individual or group),
topics, frequency and number of educational visits, the
contact time between the educator and the patient, the use
of new communication techniques, or ways to tackle barriers
to self-control remain unanswered. Furthermore, the review
of the literature indicates the effectiveness of empowerment
in terms of illness beliefs, compliance to medication, and
monitoring blood glucose. There is, however, no long-term
observation and evidence of changes in body weight, physical
activity, and depression symptoms for large groups of patients
with diabetes/obesity undergoing empowerment. Therefore,
the process and rules of empowerment should be defined
in accordance with the Evidence Based Medicine. This will
allow us to carry out reliable, prospective studies to prove the
efficacy of this approach and to establish the standards of care
for patients with diabetes and/or obesity.
In summary, the fundamental assumptions of empower-
ment are the following:
(1) Patients provide 98% of their own diabetes care.
 4
Journal of Diabetes Research
(2) The health and well-being of the patient is the result
of their own decisions and actions in daily life.
(3) Diabetes is so integrated into the life of the patient that
most activities of daily life influence it and, in turn,
daily life is influenced by diabetes and its treatment.
(4) As patients control their daily decisions, they are
responsible for these decisions and the resulting
consequences.
(5) Patients cannot delegate control or responsibility for
the treatment of diabetes, regardless of how much
they want to. Even if the doctor is in control, the
patient can change his/her mind about any doctor’s
decision. Thus, the patient controls and is responsible
for the treatment.
(6) Health care professionals cannot control patients and,
therefore, cannot be responsible for the independent
decisions of their patients.
(7) Health care professionals should do everything in
their power to make sure that their patients make
informed, independent decisions, that is, that they
have the knowledge and understanding of diabetes
treatment and an awareness of aspects of their per-
sonal lives that affect their decisions.
5. The Effects of Empowerment Therapy in
Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity
Most studies on the use of empowerment therapy were
conducted in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and/or over-
weight/obesity. The objectives of these studies included better
quality of life, normalization of body weight and lipid profile,
improved metabolic control, and prevention of diabetic
complications. The main limitations of these studies were the
small study sizes, short observation times, methodological
difficulties in conducting the research and assessment of its
effects, and the small differences in treatment effects between
the study and reference groups. Therefore, conflicting results
of the use of empowerment therapy have been reported.
5.1. Effect of Empowerment on Patients’ Quality of Life.
Empowerment perceptions strongly influence self-efficacy
and self-care and thus affect metabolic control in patients
with type 2 diabetes [21]. Therefore, to improve patients’
health behavior, an empowerment-type therapy should be
used instead of an authoritative-type approach. The effects
of these therapies are multidirectional. Indeed, participants
with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the Patient Empowerment
Program were characterized by fewer hospitalizations during
the 30-month observation compared to patients who did not
participate in the program [22]. In addition, the improvement
in the quality of life (through improvement in bodily pain and
emotional roles, among others) was noted [23]. Surprisingly,
this improvement did not correlate with the number of
sessions in which the patient participated [23]. In another
intervention, empowerment support through a life coach and
pharmacist counselor led to positive effects in terms of self-
efficacy, quality of life, and body mass index (BMI), but no
improvement in metabolic control (measured by glycated
hemoglobin [HbA1c] levels) was observed [24]. Previous
studies have confirmed the positive effect of empowerment
and education on metabolic control and quality of life of
patients with diabetes. However, only a few randomized
trials suggest a positive (albeit not very strong) influence of
empowerment therapy on mental health-related quality of life
independent effects on metabolic control [25]. This may be an
additional argument for using this type of patient support.
The so-called readiness to change, measured by a ded-
icated DES survey, is associated with the quality of life in
patients with type 2 diabetes and their treatment. After using
the Diabetes Conversation Map� tool, the proportion of
patients with type 2 diabetes showing willingness to start
lifestyle changes increased from 20.3% to 65.7% [26]. One of
the major problems relating to quality of life is in patients with
type 2 diabetes who should have insulin injections introduced
at some stage of their treatment. Often the decision is
postponed in these patients, as introducing insulin injections
is regarded by the patient as a personal failure. The goal
of empowerment is, among others, to raise the patient’s
awareness that this is the next stage of treatment and it leads
to better metabolic control [27].
5.2. Effect of Empowerment on Patients’ Metabolic Control
and Lipid Profile. Most studies show a positive effect of
empowerment therapy on HbA1c levels and lipid profile. For
example, after the 6-month empowerment-type intervention
among African-Americans with type 2 diabetes, a statistically
significant improvement in metabolic control was observed
compared to the control period (in which patients received
educational newsletters) [28]. Interestingly, during the con-
trol period, there was a statistically significant improvement
in blood pressure, cholesterol, diet, and glucose monitoring
[28]. Similarly, after the empowerment-type intervention in
the Italian SINERGIA program, a particularly strong effect
was achieved in patients with type 2 diabetes with very poor
metabolic control: that is, the percentage of patients with
HbA1c ≥ 9% decreased from 10.5% to 4.3% [29]. Furthermore,
in a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes, the use
of empowerment therapy not only resulted in improved
metabolic control (measured as the percentage of patients
with HbA1c ≤ 7.0%) and lipid profile (LDL-cholesterol ≤
2.6 mmol/L), but also reduced the frequency of doctor’s
appointments compared to a control (matched) group [30].
The Taiwanese MAGIC study also showed that empower-
ment therapy was effective in patients with type 2 diabetes;
after three months of the intervention in this Taiwanese
population, an improvement in metabolic control, self-care
behaviors, self-efficacy, and quality of life was observed [31].
Currently, we do not know what specific characteristics
determine the success of empowerment therapy. Age, sex,
duration of diabetes, and acculturation did not affect the
results of empowerment interventions (especially HbA1c
results and DES score) among first-generation immigrants
from Armenia aged ≥65 years with type 2 diabetes [32].
However, other elements, such as comorbidities, may affect
the results. Therefore, there is an ongoing study to examine
the use of empowerment in war veterans from southern
 Journal of Diabetes Research
5
Texas (USA) with poor metabolic control and accompanying
depression, that is, the Healthy Outcomes through Patient
Empowerment (HOPE) intervention [33]. This study will
examine whether the intervention has positive effects on both
diabetes and depression [33].
While most studies conducted to date show positive
results, several studies have not confirmed the effectiveness
of empowerment in all aspects of diabetes care. For example,
in a group of 344 patients with type 2 diabetes, intervention
was introduced to assist the patients in their decision-making
ability, as well as to provide individually tailored training and
more treatment options [34]. After the intervention, there
was no statistically significant increase in the empowerment
score (determined using a structured questionnaire) and
no change in the lipid profile compared to the control
group [34]. In another study (the Peer-Led, Empowerment-
Based Approach to Self-Management Efforts in Diabetes, or
PLEASED study), no improvement in metabolic control in
patients with type 2 diabetes was observed after one year of
the intervention compared to the diabetes self-management
education (DSME) control group [35]. However, there were
some positive effects of the intervention in the PLEASED
study, which related only to certain risk factors for cardio-
vascular diseases, such as lipid profile, blood pressure, and
BMI [35]. Furthermore, in the group of 569 patients with
type 2 diabetes participating in the Community Orientated
Diabetes Education (CODE) program, no link between the
characteristics of empowerment and metabolic and lipid
parameters was found [36]. Frequent contacts through a
telephone-based peer support program (PEARL) did not
improve cardiometabolic risks or psychological well-being
as compared to web-based multicomponent improvement
program (JADE) among Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes
[37]. The lack of the effectiveness of empowerment in these
studies may be due to methodological problems and/or an
insufficient number of patients.
5.3. Effect of Empowerment on the Long-Term Complications
of Diabetes. While we usually focus on a limited number of
short-term goals in psychological interventions (including
measurements of blood glucose, metabolic control, blood
pressure, and lipids), the most important goal is to reduce
the long-term complications of diabetes, including cardio-
vascular disease. When the Patient Empowerment Program
(PEP) was used at least once in a large group of patients with
type 2 diabetes, a reduction in the occurrence of the first
distant vascular complications (including nephropathy) and
reduction in overall mortality were observed compared to
matched patients without the intervention [38, 39].
5.4. Effect on Overweight and Obesity. Overweight and obe-
sity are one of the main problems associated with both type
1 and type 2 diabetes, as they increase the risk of cardiovas-
cular disease in these patients. However, most therapeutic
programs used in diabetes are verified based on achieving
metabolic control (mainly HbA1c) rather than normaliz-
ing body weight. Indeed, only a small number of studies
have used the normalization of body weight as a goal.
In one of these studies, a positive effect on the normalization
of BMI, systolic blood pressure, and stress levels was dem
onstrated following empowerment therapy among adult
patients with type 2 diabetes [40]. In addition, the health self-
empowerment workshop that was conducted among 153 low-
income adults with overweight/obesity resulted in increased
engagement in physical activity and healthy diet, as well as
a reduction in BMI and blood pressure, compared to the
control group [41].
Very few reports concern the use of empowerment
in childhood obesity. The Pediatric Obesity Empowerment
Model-Group Medical Visits (POEM-GMV) program exam-
ined the use of empowerment in children (average age of 10
years) who were overweight or obese [42]. This study showed
that empowerment was effective in terms of reducing the
body weight, especially in boys [42]. Moreover, improvement
in BMI was accompanied by reduced stress levels, increased
physical activity, improved diet, and reduction of watching
TV [42].
In summary, while there have been some conflicting
reports, overall empowerment therapy seems to improve the
quality of life, metabolic control, lipid profile, and BMI and
reduce the associated long-term complications (including
obesity and cardiovascular disease risk) in patients with type
2 diabetes.
6. The Effects of Empowerment Therapy in
Type 1 Diabetes
Five basic elements are applied in the treatment of type 1
diabetes: insulin, diet, self-control, exercise, and education.
Compliance with medical recommendations in this disease
entity is very burdensome for the patient. Effective methods
of influencing the emotional burden of type 1 diabetes are
unknown. For example, among 2,419 Danish adult patients
with type 1 diabetes, high emotional burden occurred more
frequently in younger women with comorbidities and chronic
abnormal metabolic control [43]. However, the biggest differ-
ences in the emotional burden level in this group of patients
were caused by low empowerment, poor quality of life, and
poor support [43]. In another study, patients with type 1
diabetes living without a partner were characterized by lower
DES scores compared with the control group [44]. The DES
is also used to assess the effects of support, through the
empowerment of parents who are struggling with a new
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in their children [45]. Patients
and their caregivers who are notably mentally burdened
should be qualified for new therapies that will improve their
functioning and quality of life.
The current standard of care in type 1 diabetes is flexible
intensive insulin therapy, which should lead to the achieve-
ment of correct metabolic balance and good quality of life.
However, this system is more complex and technically diffi-
cult than other insulin regimens. For example, despite the fact
that patients were subjected to empowerment therapy during
the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) courses,
they still expected and required additional support from
health care professionals [46]. This support from the health
care professionals related to the proper dosage of insulin and
 6
Journal of Diabetes Research
encouragement in dealing with problems, among others [46].
In the patients’ opinion, they require individual access to
support of clinicians. This implies potential limitations on the
use of this type of therapy and the need for support from a
large therapeutic team.
The German PRIMAS educational program included
elements of empowerment for people with type 1 diabetes
and resulted in the improvement in both diabetic parameters
and the degree of patient satisfaction with their treatment
[47]. Similarly, patient-centered communication was asso-
ciated with empowerment (assessed as greater perceptions
of control and competence) in adolescents with type 1
diabetes [48]. Only a few studies have been performed on
teenagers and young adults treated with the personal insulin
pump, including one utilizing the Guided Self-Determination
(GSD) therapeutic program [49]. The recently developed
GSD program is based on empowerment and is patient-
centered, thereby encouraging supportive problem solving
and decision-making skills related to treatment with a per-
sonal insulin pump in adolescents with type 1 diabetes [49].
However, it will take time to determine the effects of this
program in young people with type 1 diabetes. Another inter-
esting trial MODIAB-Web (person-centered web-based sup-
port) was designed to improve self-management in women
with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy and early motherhood
[50]. Diabetes management in this study was evaluated with
the Swedish short version of DES. The results showed that
women with HbA1c levels of ≤48 mmL/mol scored higher in
the subscales “goal achievement” in SWE-DES scale.
Theoretically all aspects of empowerment including edu-
cation, self-management, and shared decision-making can be
covered by mobile health technologies, so-called mHealth
[51]. For example, a mobile-phone-based tool to capture and
visualize food intake was effective in empowerment of young
people with type 1 diabetes with their diet [52]. However
the use of Web portal in the group of young patients with
type 1 diabetes and their parents did not show any additional
positive influence on the quality of life and empowerment
(DES) as compared to the control group [53].
Finally, it is worth considering whether empowerment
therapy is better used in patients with long lasting type
1 diabetes rather than at the time of diagnosis. Indeed,
empowerment seems to be the ideal tool for obtaining a better
quality of life and proper metabolic control in patients who
have become tiresome of the disease or who have decreased
motivation due to the ongoing routine.
7. Difficulties and Barriers in Implementing
the Empowerment Treatment
Although many years have passed since the development
and popularization of the idea of empowerment, much
controversy and misunderstanding in this area remains. The
misunderstanding of what empowerment actually entails
occurs in both health care professionals and patients. Indeed,
our current review highlights that the term empowerment
is often used interchangeably, with different intended mean-
ings. For example, some use the term to indicate a simple
reeducation process aimed at improving metabolic control
and better compliance with medical recommendations; oth-
ers use the term empowerment to describe a process whereby
the patients become motivated and comply with medical
recommendations, rather than simply leaving the diabetes
care in the patients’ hands [39].
The introduction of truly embracing empowerment by
health care professionals is extremely difficult because we
are profoundly embedded in a traditional approach to care.
This is because most educators believe that diabetes education
is aimed at increasing patients’ adherence with diabetes
recommendations. On one hand, these difficulties arise from
the type of training of health care professionals. This approach
is effective in acute diseases and is focused on convincing
the patient to follow the medical recommendations; however,
it does not work in chronic diseases, such as diabetes or
obesity. The essence of the work of empowerment educators
is to provide the information to the patients about the
effects and consequences of their health behavior. Health
care professionals cannot control the patients and are not
responsible for patients’ self-control. On the other hand, due
to methodological confusion, many educators/health care
professionals implement the educational systems, which are
based on an incorrect view on empowerment, and therefore
the effects of these programs may be confusing [54]. The
explanation of empowerment and improved understanding,
as well as the standardization of the implementation of the
therapy, will benefit both patients and the therapeutic team.
All these limitations can be clearly seen in pregnant
women with diabetes: for example, despite talk of empow-
erment, in practice, professionals often resort to traditional
medical models and although women’s glycemic control
can improve during pregnancy, prolonged improvements in
HbA1c patterns are not sustained [55].
Anderson and Funnell indicate a number of misconcep-
tions in the perception of both what empowerment is and
what is included in the methods of treatment [54]. It should
be emphasized that empowerment does not involve convinc-
ing, persuading, or changing patients, or doing something
to the patients [54]. The misconceptions of medical staff and
misunderstandings on the subject are shown as follows.
Misconceptions in Empowerment according to Anderson and
Funnell: The Beliefs of Health Care Professionals [54]
(1) My patients do not want to be “authorized, empow-
ered” and/or they want me to tell them what to do.
(2) I want to use empowerment in my patients to
maximize compliance. Empowerment means that the
patient is doing everything he should.
(3) I’m trying to “authorize, empower” my patients. I am
concerned when I fail to get results.
(4) There are patients who become “empowered”, patients
who do not become “empowered”, and those who
cannot be “empowered” because of age, education,
and so forth.
(5) I’m not sure when to use empowerment. I use empow-
erment in some patients; this is my spare wheel. I
never use empowerment in newly diagnosed patients.

(6) Education based on empowerment means focusing
only on the problems of the patient.
(7) I am using the empowerment approach, because it
allows patients to use any diet and adjust their own
insulin doses.
(8) Responsibility for the health of patients depends
entirely on the patients themselves.
(9) Empowerment assumes that the patient is able and
wants to take responsibility for his diabetes and to be
an equal partner in the decision-making process.
(10) Empowerment assumes that the doctor simply helps
patients to acquire knowledge and skills necessary for
informed choices about diabetes.
(11) Empowerment assumes that knowledge regarding
taking control will be understood and remembered by
patients upon communication.
In turn, the barriers in empowerment that are observed in
patients are frustration, fatigue, financial problems, trans-
port/access to the therapy center, and scheduling difficulties
[56].
Finally, there are a number of general difficulties in
implementing empowerment therapy [57]. First, if we assume
that the patient to be empowered must have adequate
knowledge to make “rational decisions,” we need to explain
the term “adequate knowledge.” Furthermore, what is a
“rational decision”? What factors (socioeconomic, political,
or cultural) determine whether the decision is rational?
Obtaining the right knowledge does not necessarily mean
a change of behavior will occur. In our daily practice, we
observe many patients who have sufficient knowledge to
make “rational decisions” but, for unknown reasons, they do
not make them. Finally, we must explain in more detail the
idea of active partnership. Currently, health care professionals
and patients are not certain what the rules and limits of
“active partnership” are.
8. Conclusions/Summary
Treatment of diabetes, similarly to most chronic diseases,
depends on the ability of the patient to cope with everyday
problems and to consistently comply with medical recom-
mendations. Therefore, E (for empowerment) has now been
added to the classical ABCD (Age, Body Weight, Com-
plications, Duration of the Disease) algorithm in diabetes
care [58]. Health care professionals should encourage the
patient and improve their ability to make informed decisions
concerning managing their own health, as well as improve
their self-esteem and responsibility for their own health.
Still, there is a need for confirmation of the effectiveness
of empowerment therapy in long-term observations on
large groups of patients according to the rules of Evidence
Based Medicine. In future, empowerment may become part
of the standard of care for patients with diabetes and/or
obesity.
