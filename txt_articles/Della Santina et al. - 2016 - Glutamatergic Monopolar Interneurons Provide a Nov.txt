SUMMARY
Excitatory
and
inhibitory
neurons
in
the
CNS
are distinguished by several features, including
morphology, transmitter content, and synapse archi-
tecture [1]. Such distinctions are exemplified in the
vertebrate retina. Retinal bipolar cells are polarized
glutamatergic neurons receiving direct photore-
ceptor input, whereas amacrine cells are usually mo-
nopolar inhibitory interneurons with synapses almost
exclusively in the inner retina [2]. Bipolar but not
amacrine cell synapses have presynaptic ribbon-
like structures at their transmitter release sites. We
identified a monopolar interneuron in the mouse
retina that resembles amacrine cells morphologically
but is glutamatergic and, unexpectedly, makes rib-
bon synapses. These glutamatergic monopolar inter-
neurons (GluMIs) do not receive direct photoreceptor
input, and their light responses are strongly shaped
by both ON and OFF pathway-derived inhibitory
input. GluMIs contact and make almost as many syn-
apses as type 2 OFF bipolar cells onto OFF-sustained
A-type (AOFF-S) retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). How-
ever, GluMIs and type 2 OFF bipolar cells possess
functionally distinct light-driven responses and may
therefore mediate separate components of the excit-
atory synaptic input to AOFF-S RGCs. The identifica-
tion of GluMIs thus unveils a novel cellular component
of excitatory circuits in the vertebrate retina, under-
scoring the complexity in defining cell types even in
this well-characterized region of the CNS.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
GluMIs Are Excitatory Monopolar Interneurons with
Classical Features of Retinal Bipolar Cells
Retinal bipolar cells comprise two major subclasses: ON bipolar
cells depolarize,
and OFF bipolar cells hyperpolarize,
in
response to light increments [3]. ON bipolar cells stratify in
approximately the inner half of the inner plexiform layer (IPL),
and OFF bipolar cells stratify in the outer half of the IPL. We pre-
viously labeled ON bipolar cells using the metabotropic gluta-
mate receptor 6 (grm6) promoter to drive expression of yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) [4] and OFF bipolar cells using the pro-
moter for Vsx1, a homeobox gene required for terminal differen-
tiation of these bipolar cells [5, 6], to drive expression of cerulean,
a cyan fluorescent protein [7]. Neurons in the Vsx1-cerulean
mouse retina are labeled sparsely [7] (Figure 1A), allowing the
morphology of individual cells to be identified (Figure 1B). In
addition to the expected labeling of all OFF bipolar cell types
(types 1–4), cerulean was expressed by a monopolar neuron
stratifying within the outer sublamina of the IPL, where type 1
and type 2 OFF bipolar cells stratify [8] (Figures 1A–1C). Neurons
with this morphology were also, surprisingly, found in grm6-YFP
retinas in which ON bipolar cells are labeled (Figures S1G and
S1H). These monopolar neurons had average arbor and somal
diameters of 24.3 ± 1.2 and 6.9 ± 0.1 mm, respectively (Figure 1D).
The somata and arbor size of these monopolar neurons are thus
characteristic of OFF bipolar cells [7] and narrow-field amacrine
cells (<150 mm diameter) [9], which are usually inhibitory glyciner-
gic interneurons [10].
The Vsx1-cerulean positive monopolar cells thus most closely
resemble amacrine cells. Nonetheless, these cells do not express
the GABA-synthesizing enzymes GAD67 or GAD65 (Figures 1E
and 1F), found in GABAergic amacrine cells, nor the glycine
transporter GlyT1, expressed by glycinergic amacrine cells (Fig-
ure 1G). Thus, these monopolar cells are not GABAergic or glyci-
nergic neurons. In fact, they are not immunoreactive for syntaxin,
a pan-amacrine cell marker [11] (Figure 1H). Instead, we found
that the monopolar cells express proteins characteristic of excit-
atory retinal neurons. Like bipolar cell axons, the monopolar
neuron’s processes in the IPL contain vesicular glutamate trans-
porter 1 (VGLUT1) (Figures 1I and 1J; Movie S1), suggesting that
they are glutamatergic interneurons. We thus name these cells
glutamatergic monopolar interneurons, or GluMIs.
GluMIs observed in the Vsx1-cerulean mouse line have arbor
and somata sizes similar to that of type 1 and 2 OFF bipolar
cells that costratify in the same sublayer of the IPL (OFF bipolar
arbors: 23.6 ± 5.4 mm, p = 0.9, soma: 6.7 ± 1.5 mm, p = 0.1,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, n = 19 cells compared to data in Fig-
ure 1D). Although the arbor morphology and stratification of
2070

 GluMIs resemble the axons of type 1 and type 2 OFF bipolar
cells, GluMIs are not labeled by specific markers of these two bi-
polar cell types: NK3R, which labels type 1 and 2 OFF bipolar
cells, and synaptotagmin 2, which labels type 2 OFF bipolar
cells [12] (Figures S1A–S1D). Rather, they are immunoreactive
for the calcium-binding protein CaBP5 (Figures S1E and S1F),
a protein that is expressed by type 3 OFF, type 5 ON, and rod
bipolar cells [13].
The resemblance of GluMIs to amacrine cells in morphology
but bipolar cells in transmitter content and protein expression
raises the question of whether GluMIs attain their monopolar
morphology following a developmental program typical of ama-
crine cells or of bipolar cells. Amacrine and bipolar cells demon-
strate differences in developmental timing and how they attain
their characteristic morphology [14]. Amacrine cells are born
earlier than bipolar cells, migrate freely to reach their final

 locations by birth, and then elaborate their arbors within the IPL
[15]. Bipolar cells instead maintain connections to the apical and
basal laminae of the retina as axonal and dendritic processes
elaborate within the OPL and IPL from the apical and basal neu-
roepithelial-like processes. The apical and basal processes
retract by postnatal day 10 (P10), and bipolar cells acquire their
polarized morphology [16].
To
determine
how
GluMIs
attain
their
characteristic
morphology, we examined Vsx1-cerulean retinas across post-
natal development. At postnatal day 5 (P5), all the labeled neu-
rons in the retinal periphery had the morphology of an immature
bipolar cell (Figure S2A: P5 periphery). However, in central retina,
some cells were observed to have short, unbranching apical pro-
cesses that were detached from the apical membrane, but with a
terminal arbor in the IPL (Figure S2A: P5 center, asterisk). Other
neurons with an axonal arbor had an apical process that
extended all the way to the external limiting membrane. By P7,
most OFF bipolar cells had retracted their apical processes
and elaborated some dendrites, while their axons appeared
stratified and their basal processes had retracted. At the same
time, some labeled neurons appeared to be in the process of
retracting their entire apical process toward the cell body (Fig-
ure S2A: P7 arrow). This retraction is more evident at P10,
when some cells have only a thin apically directed process (Fig-
ure S2A: P10 arrow). These thin processes were absent in P21
and older retina. Thus, GluMIs likely differentiate around the
same time as bipolar cells and share an initial polarized
morphology similar to bipolar cells. We propose that GluMIs
retract their apical process completely, resulting in a monopolar
form, whereas bipolar cells retract their apical process only up to
their dendritic terminals (schematized in Figure S2B).
GluMIs Form Ribbon Synapses with Postsynaptic
Targets in the IPL
To ascertain whether GluMIs share synaptic features that are
characteristic of bipolar cells, we performed immunostaining
for C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2), a marker of ribbon
synapses found typically in bipolar cells and photoreceptors.
Indeed, GluMI processes contain CtBP2-immunopositive clus-
ters (Figure 1K and Movie S2; Figures S1G and S1H). To confirm
that this labeling unequivocally identifies synaptic ribbons in
GluMIs, we carried out serial block-face scanning electron
microscopy (SBFSEM) of fluorescently identified GluMIs and
reconstructed their synapses. Using the Vsx1-cerulean line, we
first identified GluMIs and then used a titanium-sapphire laser
to burn fiducial marks (boxes) above the axonal arbor and at
the level of the cell body, a method called near-infrared branding
[17]. These fiducial marks allowed us to identify the GluMI under
SBFSEM (Figure 2A). Two SBFSEM reconstructions confirmed
that GluMIs do not possess dendrites. In these EM reconstruc-
tions, we classified processes that contained clusters of synap-
tic vesicles, but no ribbons, as originating from amacrine cells
whereas vesicle-free processes were classified as belonging to
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Both GluMIs that were recon-
structed contained ribbon structures at classic ‘‘dyad’’ arrange-
ments in which the ribbon is apposed to two postsynaptic
processes, including processes of RGCs and amacrine cells
(Figure 2B). The total number of ribbons observed within the ar-
bor of a GluMI that was fully reconstructed by EM (72 ribbons for
the cell in Figure 2) is similar to that obtained by CtBP2 immuno-
staining (77 ± 29 ribbons, n = 7 cells).
GluMIs Receive a Diversity of Conventional Synaptic
Contact, but Not Ribbon Contact
SBFSEM further revealed that GluMIs receive numerous con-
ventional, presumed amacrine cell, synapses (Figure 2), but no
ribbon synapses. We therefore explored the possibility of alter-
native excitatory inputs. One candidate is the VGluT3 amacrine
cell, which provides glutamatergic input to specific ganglion
cell types [18–20]. However, VGluT3 amacrine stratification in
the IPL does not overlap with GluMI dendrites (Figure S3A). Like-
wise, OFF cholinergic starburst amacrine cells do not costratify
with the GluMI neurites (Figure S3B). It is thus unlikely that these
amacrine cell types provide major synaptic input onto GluMIs.
GluMIs are heavily innervated by other amacrine cell types
(Figure 2). In fact, we counted 74 conventional synapses from
long-range processes (presumed GABAergic), as well as 46
from short-range processes (presumed glycinergic) [21] (Fig-
ure 2C). Innervation from amacrine cells could be reciprocal,
i.e. GluMIs can synapse onto an amacrine cell that also forms
synapses on the GluMI (Figure 2B), or non-reciprocal. Synaptic
contact with both GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine cells
was corroborated by the expression of GABA and glycine recep-
tors on the arbors of GluMIs (Figures S3C–S3H). Immunolabeling
for GABAA subunits revealed that GluMIs are relatively rich in
GABAAa1 and a3 subunits compared to GABAC receptors (Fig-
ures S3C–S3E). GABAAa2 receptors were not assessed due
to their localization mainly at the level of cholinergic amacrine
processes [22], outside the stratification level of GluMIs in the
IPL. In addition to GABA receptors, a1 and a3 but not a2
subunits of the glycine receptor were also abundant on GluMI
processes (Figures S3F–S3H). Therefore, similar to OFF bipolar
cells [23], inhibitory synapses onto GluMIs originate from both
GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine cells.
GluMIs Provide a Functionally Distinct OFF Pathway for
Excitatory Signals to Reach the Inner Retina
How do GluMIs fit into the retinal circuitry? Our EM observa-
tions revealed that GluMIs contact OFF RGC dendrites (Figures
3A and 3B). Because the dendritic arbor of the RGC in Figure 3A
exceeded the scanned SBFSEM region of interest, we could
not identify the RGC type. Thus, we biolistically labeled RGCs
and their glutamatergic postsynaptic sites (by expressing
YFP-tagged PSD95 [PSD95-YFP], a scaffolding protein at
glutamatergic synapses [24, 25]) in the Vsx1-cerulean retina.
We identified putative synaptic contacts between GluMIs
and RGCs based on the close apposition of PSD95-YFP within
the RGC dendrites and immunolabeled ribbons within GluMI
processes.
Among RGCs with dendritic arbors that stratified in the same
sublamina as the arbors of GluMIs, we identified the OFF-
sustained A-type (AOFF-S) RGC as a likely postsynaptic partner
of GluMIs (Figures 3C–3E). Each GluMI formed an average
of 3.7 ± 1.4 synaptic contacts with a RGC with dendritic
morphology and stratification characteristic of AOFF-S RGCs
(n = 7 cell pairs, 5 retinas; Figure 3F). AOFF-S RGCs were also con-
tacted by type 2 OFF cone bipolar cells, identified by colocaliza-
tion of PSD95-YFP with type 2 bipolar cell axons labeled with
2072
Current Biology 26, 2070–2077, August 8, 2016
 anti-synaptotagmin 2 antibody (data not shown). We found that a
type 2 bipolar cell formed an average of 5.4 ± 1.4 synaptic con-
tacts with a single AOFF-S RGC (n = 16 cell pairs, 4 retinas; Fig-
ure 3F). Type 2 bipolar cells provide about 45% of the excitatory
synapses on the AOFF-S RGC [26]. Because the arbor sizes of
GluMIs and type 2 bipolar cells are comparable, we predict
that if the GluMI arbors tile the retina, they would contribute
about 30% of the total excitatory synapses onto the AOFF-S RGC.
The anatomical evidence that GluMIs and type 2 bipolar cells
comprise distinct pathways for excitatory synaptic input to the
same RGC subtype motivated us to compare the visual
response properties of GluMIs and type 2 bipolar cells. To do
this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure
voltage responses evoked by spatially uniform, randomly flick-
ering light stimuli (Gaussian noise; Figures 4A–4E). This stimulus
allowed us to efficiently explore a variety of stimulus contrasts
and temporal frequencies.

We
characterized
responses
to
Gaussian noise stimuli using a linear-
nonlinear (LN) cascade model, which de-
scribes the light response with a linear
temporal filter (Figure 4F) followed by a
time-invariant
nonlinearity
(Figure
4G)
[27–29]. The linear filter provides an esti-
mate of the response of the cell to a brief,
incremental flash of light; the negative po-
larity of the primary lobe of filters for both
GluMIs and type 2 bipolar cells shows that
both cell types hyperpolarize in response
to light increments (OFF responses), as
expected from their axonal stratification
patterns. The more biphasic shape of
GluMI filters versus type 2 bipolar cell fil-
ters (Figures 4F and 4H; biphasic index =
0.41 ± 0.04 versus 0.22 ± 0.05, respec-
tively; p = 0.02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test)
indicates that responses of GluMIs exhibit a greater preference
for rapid versus slow changes in light intensity than responses
of type 2 bipolar cells.
Response nonlinearities differed substantially for GluMIs
and type 2 bipolar cells. GluMIs exhibited a strong asymmetry
in the shape of their nonlinearity, i.e., GluMIs responded more
robustly
to
positive
contrasts
(strong
hyperpolarization)
compared to negative contrasts (weak depolarization) (Fig-
ure 4G). We quantified this asymmetry with a rectification index
that ranges from �1, corresponding to a purely hyperpolarizing
response, to +1, corresponding to a purely depolarizing
response (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Unlike
the strongly rectified responses of GluMIs (rectification index =
�0.50 ± 0.04; n = 5 cells), type 2 bipolar cell responses were
near linear, i.e., there were equal and opposite responses to in-
crements versus decrements (rectification index = �0.02 ± 0.06
[n = 6 cells]; p = 0.004 for comparison to GluMI, Wilcoxon
Current Biology 26, 2070–2077, August 8, 2016

 rank-sum test) (Figures 4G and 4H). Thus, although GluMIs and
type 2 bipolar cells are both OFF cells, their light responses
clearly differ.
To examine whether differences in synaptic input contribute to
the distinct voltage responses of GluMIs and type 2 bipolar cells,
we also made voltage-clamp measurements in a subset of
recordings. To more easily separate ON versus OFF pathway-
derived synaptic inputs, we recorded responses to steps of light
intensity in these experiments. Negative contrast steps revealed
a likely explanation for the rectified voltage responses of GluMIs:
although decrements elicited an increase in excitatory synaptic
conductance in both cell types, the same stimuli reduced inhib-
itory conductance in type 2 bipolar cells but increased inhibitory
synaptic input onto GluMIs (Figures S4A–S4E). This suggests
that strong OFF pathway-driven (feed-forward) inhibition limits
the extent to which GluMIs depolarize in response to negative
contrasts, whereas increased excitatory input and decreased
inhibitory input together drive robust depolarizing responses to
OFF stimuli in type 2 bipolar cells. Strong feed-forward inhibitory
input to GluMIs may also contribute to the type-specific differ-
ences in response kinetics that we observed (Figures 4F and
4H). In both cell types, strong hyperpolarizing responses to light
increments were likely due to the combined effects of reduced
excitatory drive and the recruitment of ON pathway-derived
(crossover) inhibitory input (Figures S4A–S4E). Taken together
with our EM data showing that multiple amacrine cell types pro-
vide synaptic input to GluMIs (Figure 2) and our immunohisto-
chemical evidence that GluMIs express a diverse complement
of inhibitory receptor types (Figure S3), these results indicate a
critical role for inhibitory inputs in shaping the functional re-
sponses of GluMIs.
Given that we did not find ribbon synaptic contact onto GluMIs,
and that both VGluT3 and cholinergic amacrine cells are unlikely
to provide excitatory input to the GluMIs (Figures S3A and S3B), it
was surprising to observe excitatory synaptic input to the GluMIs.
However, consistent with the lack of ribbon contact (Figure 2) and
the little overlap with VGluT3 amacrine cell neurites (Figure S3A),
light step-evoked excitatory currents in GluMIs persisted in the
presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists
NBQX and D-APV (Figure S4F). Additionally, it is unlikely that

we traced an individual ribbon synapse back to the BC of origin, which resembles a type 2 BC.

synapses is shown in insets).

of light modulation. Gray lines show linear-nonlinear (LN) model predictions (see F and G). Note that LN models were constructed from responses to non-repeated
random noise stimuli.

(G) Static nonlinearities for cells in (D) and (E). Lines show cumulative Gaussian fits (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) to data (circles). Same color
scheme as (D)–(F). Note strong negative rectification of GluMI response versus more linear response of type 2 bipolar cell (gray arrow). The shaded upper right
quadrant corresponds to responses to negative contrast stimuli.
(H) Summary data for GluMIs (n = 5 cells) and type 2 bipolar cells (n = 6) measurements of linear filters (‘‘time to peak,’’ ‘‘biphasic index’’), nonlinearities
(‘‘rectification index’’), and resting membrane potentials (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). *p < 0.02; **p < 0.005; n.s. = not significant (p > 0.05),
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Error bars represent SEM.
(I) Mean excitatory synaptic current recorded in an example AOFF-S RGC in response to repeated noise stimulus. Gray line shows prediction from model with two
linear filters, each with their own static nonlinearity (2D LN model; see J and K). Horizontal dashed line shows holding current in absence of light modulation.
(J) Filters corresponding to the largest (‘‘feature 1,’’ black) and smallest (‘‘feature 2,’’ gray) eigenvalues. Note that the time axis is reversed to facilitate comparison
with (F). Inset shows mean ± SD peak normalized filters for the six AOFF-S RGCs in which we applied covariance analysis.

responses to negative contrasts. Gray arrow points to strongly rectified inward component measured for feature 2.
(L) Eigenvalues for features (eigenmodes) identified by response-weighted covariance analysis.
(M) Mean ± SD excitatory currents from three AOFF-S RGCs in response to brief (10 ms) decrement flashes (�80% contrast).

 GluMIs receive strong electrical synaptic input since we did not
find evidence for tracer coupling when we dialyzed GluMIs with
the gap-junction-permeable molecule neurobiotin (Figure S4G).
For now, we can conclude only that GluMIs receive their (weak)
excitatory input via an atypical OFF pathway.
The dissimilar light-response properties of GluMIs and type 2
bipolar cells (Figures 4D–4H) suggest that these cell types
convey distinct glutamatergic signals to their postsynaptic tar-
gets. We therefore attempted to separate stimulus-driven excit-
atory input to AOFF-S RGCs into components that might reflect
differential input from GluMIs versus type 2 bipolar cells. To do
this, we measured excitatory synaptic currents in AOFF-S RGCs
and used current-weighted covariance analysis to characterize
responses to the same Gaussian noise stimuli that we used to
characterize GluMI and type 2 bipolar cell responses (Figures
4I–4L)
(see
Supplemental
Experimental
Procedures).
This
approach is similar to the spike-triggered covariance techniques
that have been extensively used to extract multiple stimulus
dimensions contributing to the response properties of sensory
neurons
[30,
31].
However,
unlike
most
spike-triggered
approaches, we used voltage-clamp recordings to isolate
excitatory conductances. Hence, any response components
revealed
by
current-weighted
covariance
analysis
should
reflect properties of the excitatory inputs to AOFF-S RGCs.
Covariance analysis consistently revealed two features for which
response-weighted stimulus variance was clearly different from
the variance of the stimulus weighted by the mean response
(‘‘prior stimulus’’) (n = 6/6 cells) (Figure 4L). Thus, excitatory in-
puts to AOFF-S RGCs are best described by at least two temporal
features with distinct kinetics (time to peak = 42.8 ± 0.5 ms
versus 78.4 ± 2.2 ms; biphasic index = 0.25 ± 0.04 versus
0.66 ± 0.04 for ‘‘feature 1’’ and ‘‘feature 2’’) (Figure 4J). Interest-
ingly, the covariance analysis-derived features resembled AOFF-S
RGC excitatory currents measured in response to brief incre-
ment or decrement flash stimuli (time to peak = 52.9 ± 2.7 versus
76.5 ± 8.7 ms; biphasic index = 0.23 ± 0.09 versus 0.72 ± 0.13;
n = 3 cells) (Figures 4M and 4N). These features may therefore
correspond most closely to excitatory inputs driven by stimuli
consisting primarily of increments versus decrements in light
intensity.
Strikingly, in each of six cells, the nonlinearity for feature 2
had an unusual shape in which the measured responses were
restricted over a narrow range of inward (negative contrast stim-
uli) and outward (positive contrasts) currents (Figure 4K). Rectifi-
cation of the response to positive contrast stimuli (Figure 4K, up-
per right quadrant) is expected from the nonlinear input-output
properties of glutamatergic synapses, i.e., presynaptic hyperpo-
larization below the membrane potential at which vesicles are no
longer released cannot continue to reduce postsynaptic cur-
rents. However, the limited response to negative contrast stimuli
(Figure 4K, shaded lower left quadrant; gray arrow) that we
observed for feature 2 is what would be expected from the
strongly rectified light responses of GluMIs, i.e., the consistently
weak depolarizing response of GluMIs across a range of nega-
tive contrasts should produce a flat relationship between
stimulus contrast and inward current in AOFF-S RGCs (see gray
arrows in Figures 4G and 4K). Thus, GluMIs may contribute pref-
erentially to feature 2 of the excitatory input to AOFF-S RGCs. We
do not, however, have direct evidence for this hypothesis, and
other circuit features could equally well account for the shape
of the nonlinearity for feature 2—e.g., the synapses contributing
to this feature could saturate at low stimulus contrasts. Never-
theless, when considered together with the clear differences in
light-response properties between GluMIs and type 2 bipolar
cells (Figures 4D–4H) and our anatomical evidence that both
cell types provide synaptic input to AOFF-S RGCs (Figure 3), the
finding that excitatory input to AOFF-S RGCs consists of at least
two distinct components supports the idea that GluMIs provide
a source of excitation in the inner retina that is functionally
distinct from conventional OFF bipolar cells.
Our results add to the growing list of unconventional interneu-
rons in the vertebrate retina. For instance, nGnG [32] amacrine
cells are neither GABAergic nor glycinergic, but unlike GluMIs,
their neurotransmitter content remains unknown. Glutamatergic
VGluT3 amacrine cells have also been identified [33, 34], but
these cells co-express inhibitory and excitatory markers, release
inhibitory (glycine) or excitatory (glutamate) neurotransmitter in a
postsynaptic target-specific manner [19, 35], and do not appear
to possess ribbons [36]. A large-field, somatostatin-expressing
amacrine cell that has ribbon synapses has been found in the
cat retina [37], but these amacrine cells are not glutamatergic.
GluMIs are unique from these previously described unconven-
tional amacrine cells in that they closely resemble bipolar cells
in many respects (e.g., they express markers characteristic of bi-
polar but not amacrine cells), but they do not extend a dendrite to
contact photoreceptors in the outer retina. Additionally, single-
cell gene profiling suggests that a monopolar interneuron in the
mouse retina resembling GluMI expresses molecular signatures
found in bipolar cells (J.R. Sanes, personal communication). Of
the ‘‘amacrine’’ cell types in the recent EM reconstruction of
mouse IPL [38], GluMIs most closely resemble the type 14 cell
(AC17-30) in arbor morphology and cell body location in the inner
nuclear layer. However, our results suggest that GluMIs are not
likely to contact OFF starburst amacrine cells (Figure S3B), con-
trary to the predictions for AC type 14. Our current findings,
together with the gene profiling work of Sanes and colleagues,
thus underscore the need to integrate molecular, morphological,
and physiological information in classifying neurons.
