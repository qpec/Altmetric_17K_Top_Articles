Studies
 have  consistently
 shown
 that  males
 perform  better  than  females
 on  several
 spatial  tasks.
 Animal
and
 human
 literature
 suggests
 that sex  hormones
 have
 an  important
 role  in  both
 establishing
 and
 main-
taining
 this  difference.
 The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  examine
 the effects  of exogenous
 testosterone
on
 spatial  cognition
 and  brain  activity  in  healthy
 women.
 A  cross-sectional,
 double-blind,
 randomized,
placebo-controlled
 study  was  performed
 in  42  healthy
 young
 women
 who  either  received  one  dose of
0.5
 mg  sublingual
 testosterone
 or  placebo.
 They  then
 learned  a  virtual  environment
 and  performed
 nav-
igation
 tasks  during
 functional
 magnetic
 resonance
 imaging
 (fMRI).
 Subsequently,
 their  knowledge
 of
the
 virtual  environment,
 self-reported
 navigation
 strategy,  and  mental
 rotation
 abilities  were
 measured.
The
 testosterone
 group
 had  improved
 representations
 of
 the directions
 within  the  environment
 and
 per-
formed
 significantly
 better  on  the mental
 rotation  task  compared
 to  the  placebo
 group,  but
 navigation
success
 and  navigation
 strategy
 were  similar  in  the  two  groups.
 Nevertheless,
 the  testosterone
 group
had
 significantly
 increased
 activity  within  the  medial
 temporal
 lobe
 during  successful
 navigation
 com-
pared
 to the  placebo
 group,
 and  a positive
 correlation
 between
 testosterone
 load
 and  medial
 temporal
lobe
 activity  was  found.  Fetal  testosterone
 levels,
 measured
 as
 second-to-fourth
 digit
 length  ratio,
 inter-
acted
 significantly
 with  parahippocampal
 activity  and tended  towards
 giving
 higher
 mental  rotation
 task
scores.
 These
 results
 demonstrated
 that  testosterone
 had  a limited
 effect  pertaining
 specifically
 to  spa-
tial
 cognition
 involving
 3D-visualization
 in  healthy
 women,
 while
 complex
 behaviors
 such  as  navigation,
relying
 more  on  learned  strategies,
 were  not  altered  despite
 increased
 neuronal
 activity  in relevant
 brain
regions.

between

 and

 Indeed,
 MRT
 and
 navigation
 are
 the
two
 tasks
 with
 the
 most
 consistent
 and
 notable
 sex
 differences
with
 men
 scoring
 higher
 than
 women
 [1–6].
 Furthermore,
 per-
formance
 on
 MRT
 is
 moderately
 correlated
 to
 navigation
 ability
[7,8].
 The
 underlying
 biological
 mechanism(s)
 underpinning
 this
sexual
 dimorphic
 performance
 remain
 uncertain,
 but
 several
 lines
of
 evidence
 point
 to
 testosterone
 levels
 playing
 a
 significant
 role.
 In
general,
 increased
 testosterone
 levels
 are
 associated
 with
 improved
MRT
 performance
 in
 women
 [9–11].

task
 (vMWT),
 with
 one
 study
 indicating
 a
 positive
 association
between
 endogenous
 testosterone
 and
 navigation
 performance
in
 women
 [8],
 and
 other
 studies
 showing
 a
 neutral
 [7]
 or
 neg-
ative
 association
 [12].
 Testosterone
 has
 both
 organizational
 and
activational
 effects
 on
 the
 brain,
 which
 may
 both
 be
 involved
 in
the
 emergence
 of
 sexual
 dimorphic
 performance
 [13].
 The
 orga-
nizational
 effect
 takes
 place
 during
 development
 and
 results
 in
permanent
 changes
 in
 brain
 morphology.
 Fetal
 testosterone
 lev-
els
 are
 believed
 to
 be
 mirrored
 in
 the
 ratio
 between
 the
 length
of
 the
 second
 and
 fourth
 digit
 (2D:4D)
 [14],
 which
 is
 used
 in
some
 studies
 as
 a
 proxy
 for
 testosterone’s
 organizational
 effects
 on
the
 brain
 [15–19].
 The
 activational
 effect
 of
 testosterone
 is
 more
transient
 and
 depends
 on
 the
 current
 endogenous
 hormone
 level
[20,21].
 Both
 organizational
 and
 activational
 effects
 influence
 brain
function,
 and
 interactions
 between
 organizational
 and
 activational
effects
 are
 reported
 [22,23].
Navigation
 ability
 is
 subserved
 by
 several
 medial
 temporal
 lobe
(MTL)
 structures
 [24],
 predominantly
 the
 hippocampus,
 entorhi-
nal
 and
 parahippocampal
 cortices
 [25–28].
 Both
 androgen
 and
estrogen
 receptors
 are
 particularly
 densely
 expressed
 in
 the
 MTL
[29,30],
 and
 sex
 hormones
 have
 been
 demonstrated
 to
 have
 major
effects
 on
 hippocampal
 structure
 and
 function
 [8,31–33].
 In
 the
hippocampus,
 androgens
 can
 act
 on
 pyrmidal
 cells
 both
 directly
via
 the
 androgen
 receptor,
 as
 well
 as
 via
 one
 of
 the
 estrogen
receptors
 after
 convertion
 to
 estrogens
 by
 aromatase
 [34].
 Acti-
vational
 effects
 of
 testosterone
 have
 been
 shown
 in
 women,
 as
adult
 endogenous
 testosterone
 levels
 correlate
 positively
 with
 nav-
igation
 abilities
 in
 both
 adult
 women
 and
 female
 rats
 [8,35].
 In
animal
 models,
 it
 has
 been
 shown
 that
 testosterone
 administra-
tion
 increases
 hippocampal
 pyramidal
 dendritic
 spine
 density
 in
ovariectomized
 female
 rats
 [36].
 Hippocampal
 pyramidal
 dendritic
spine
 density
 is
 positively
 associated
 with
 memory
 [37–39],
 and
thus
 possibly
 navigation
 performance.
 Moreover,
 women
 born
 with
congenital
 adrenal
 hyperplasia,
 which
 is
 associated
 with
 exces-
sive
 production
 of
 androgens
 in
 fetal
 life,
 perform
 better
 on
 spatial
tasks
 than
 healthy
 controls
 [40]
 pointing
 to
 an
 organizational
 effect
of
 testosterone
 on
 spatial
 cognition
 in
 women.
 Still,
 no
 study
 has
assessed
 the
 effect
 of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 on
 navigation
 per-
formance
 in
 women,
 nor
 examined
 possible
 interactions
 between
testosterone’s
 activational
 and
 organizational
 effects
 in
 navigation,
and/or
 their
 separate
 contributions
 to
 navigation.
A
 positive
 effect
 of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 administration
 on
MRT
 performance
 in
 women
 is,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 well
 documented
[10,41,42].
 In
 contrast
 to
 navigation,
 mental
 rotation
 is
 not
 depen-
dent
 on
 the
 hippocampus,
 but
 relies
 on
 frontal
 and
 parietal
 regions
[43].
 Since
 there
 are
 no
 experimental
 animal
 models
 of
 mental
rotation,
 less
 is
 known
 about
 the
 possible
 neurobiological
 mecha-
nism(s)
 behind
 testosterone’s
 MRT
 enhancing
 effect.
 However,
 sex
hormone
 receptors
 are
 located
 throughout
 the
 cortex
 [44],
 includ-
ing
 frontal
 and
 parietal
 regions,
 and
 numerous
 effects
 have
 been
ascribed
 to
 sex
 hormone
 receptor
 activation
 [33,45–49].
 At
 the
 acti-
vational
 level,
 it
 has
 been
 shown
 both
 that
 endogenous
 testosterone
levels
 correlate
 positively
 with
 MRT
 performance
 [9],
 and
 that
 a
single
 dose
 of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 improves
 MRT
 performance
in
 healthy
 women
 [10].
 Moreover,
 prolonged
 androgen
 treatment
in
 female-to-male
 transsexuals
 improves
 MRT
 performance
 even
several
 weeks
 after
 cessation
 of
 testosterone
 administration
 [41].
There
 is
 conflicting
 evidence
 with
 regard
 to
 testosterone’s
 orga-
nizational
 effects
 on
 MRT
 performance
 [15,16,18,19],
 but
 women
exposed
 to
 higher
 intrauterine
 testosterone
 levels,
 i.e.,
 women
 with
congenital
 adrenal
 hyperplasia
 and
 female
 fraternal
 twins
 with
male
 co-twins,
 perform
 better
 than
 controls
 on
 several
 spatial
 tasks,
including
 MRT
 [11,40,50,51].
The
 neuronal
 correlates
 of
 testosterone’s
 effect
 on
 behavior
 in
healthy
 women
 have
 so
 far
 only
 been
 studied
 with
 paradigms
 prob-
ing
 social
 interaction,
 reward
 and
 mood,
 and
 only
 by
 comparing
overall
 responses
 to
 stimulus
 presentation
 versus
 a
 passive
 base-
line
 condition.
 A
 general
 finding
 across
 these
 studies
 is
 increased
brain
 activity
 in
 task
 positive
 regions
 [52–57].
 However,
 whether
this
 increase
 in
 activity
 is
 related
 specifically
 to
 task
 perfor-
mance
 or
 reflect
 a
 general
 increase
 in
 the
 BOLD
 signal
 due
 to
the
 mere
 exposure
 to
 a
 stimulus,
 cannot
 be
 surmised
 from
 these
results.
 In
 addition
 to
 increased
 brain
 activity,
 both
 increased
 and
decreased
 functional
 connectivity
 has
 been
 described
 during
 task
performance
 [54,58,59],
 but
 no
 study
 has
 examined
 if
 exogenous
testosterone
 influences
 resting
 state
 functional
 connectivity.
 The
described
 effects
 of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 on
 brain
 activity
 have
always
 been
 measured
 after
 a
 delay
 of
 several
 hours,
 when
 serum
levels
 have
 returned
 to
 normal,
 pointing
 to
 genomic
 mechanisms
behind
 the
 changes
 in
 fMRI
 activity
 [23,52–55,57,60].
The
 primary
 aim
 of
 the
 current
 study
 was
 to
 explore
 the
 effect
of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 administration
 on
 navigation
 ability
 and
its
 neuronal
 correlates
 in
 women
 using
 an
 ecologically
 valid,
 large
scale
 virtual
 environment
 (VE).
 Based
 on
 the
 above
 reviewed
 lit-
erature,
 we  predicted
 that
 sublingual
 administration
 of
 a
 single
dose
 of
 testosterone
 would
 increase
 spatial
 navigation
 perfor-
mance
 in
 women.
 Furthermore,
 we
 predicted
 that
 testosterone
administration
 would
 improve
 knowledge
 of
 the
 environment,
 i.e.,
improve
 judgments
 of
 direction
 and
 distance
 between
 landmarks
and
 increase
 use
 of
 available
 shortcuts.
 The
 latter
 prediction
 was
motivated
 by
 previous
 studies
 showing
 that
 men
 perform
 better
than
 women
 when
 navigation
 requires
 accurate
 directions
 [5,6,61],
have
 better
 pointing
 and
 navigation
 accuracy
 towards
 unseen
 tar-
gets
 [62,63],
 and
 better
 distance
 judgment
 compared
 to
 women
[62,64].
We
 further
 predicted
 that
 testosterone
 administration
 induced
changes
 in
 brain
 activity
 in
 certain
 regions
 of
 the
 MTL,
 and
 that
these
 changes
 would
 be
 specific
 to
 successful
 navigation.
 Specifi-
cally,
 we
 predicted
 increased
 activity
 in
 the
 anterior
 hippocampus
in
 the
 testosterone
 group,
 as
 activity
 in
 this
 area
 has
 been
 linked
to
 the
 use
 of
 an
 allocentric
 strategy,
 i.e.
 a
 more
 male
 like
 navi-
gation
 style
 [65],
 during
 VE
 navigation
 [25],
 and
 correlates
 with
successful
 VE
 navigation
 [26].
 The
 overall
 activity
 during
 naviga-
tion
 compared
 to
 baseline,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 would
 be
 similar
 in
the
 two
 groups.
 As
 a
 control,
 the
 effect
 of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 on
MRT  performance
 was
 assessed
 to
 ascertain
 that
 the
 experimental
setup
 allowed
 for
 reproduction
 of
 the
 earlier
 described
 perfor-
mance
 effects
 of
 testosterone.
 Since
 some
 previous
 studies
 suggest
an
 interaction
 between
 current
 testosterone
 level
 and
 fetal
 testos-
terone
 exposure
 on
 task
 performance
 [22,23],
 we
 investigated
correlations
 and
 interactions
 between
 the
 2D:4D
 ratio,
 naviga-
tion
 performance,
 MRT
 performance,
 and
 brain
 activity
 in
 the
 MTL
during
 successful
 navigation.
 Lastly,
 we
 explored
 the
 effects
 of
exogenous
 testosterone
 on
 resting
 state
 networks
 based
 on
 pre-
vious
 reports
 on
 increased
 functional
 connectivity
 in
 task
 positive
regions
 following
 testosterone
 administration.

 Materials
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Participants
53
 healthy
 right-handed
 women
 (19–30
 years,
 mean
 =
 22.5
years)
 were
 recruited
 at
 the
 university
 campus.
 The
 local
 ethics
committee
 only
 allowed
 the
 enrollment
 of
 participants
 that
 were
on
 oral
 contraceptives.
 Moreover,
 the
 participants
 had
 to
 take
 a
pregnancy
 test
 at
 the
 day
 of
 the
 experiment
 to
 ensure
 that
 pregnant
women
 were
 not
 included.
 To
 control
 for
 menstrual
 cycle
 induced
hormonal
 fluctuations
 and
 to
 ensure
 similar
 low
 endogenous
 hor-
mone
 levels
 in
 all
 participants,
 the
 women
 were
 instructed
 to
 stop
using
 oral
 contraceptives
 three
 to
 seven
 days
 prior
 to
 the
 study
 to
ensure
 that
 they
 were
 in
 their
 early
 follicular
 phase
 [66].

 women
 have
 the
 lowest
 estradiol
 levels.
 Several
 studies
 have
found
 associations
 between
 endogenous
 estradiol
 levels
 and
 per-
formance
 on
 spatial
 tasks
 in
 women
 [9,67,68].
 Furthermore,
 lower
estradiol
 levels
 will
 minimize
 potential
 competition
 for
 estrogen
receptors
 between
 estradiol
 and
 testosterone
 [34].
 The
 partici-
pants’
 computer
 gaming
 experience
 was
 assessed
 by
 asking
 if
 and
what
 type
 of
 experience
 they
 had
 with
 playing
 1st
 person
 computer
games.
 None
 of
 the
 participants
 reported
 notable
 computer
 gam-
ing
 experience.
 All
 participants
 provided
 written
 informed
 consent,
and
 received
 500
 Norwegian
 kroner
 as
 reimbursement.
 The
 study
was
 approved
 by
 the
 National
 Committee
 for
 Medical
 Research
Ethics
 in
 Midt-Norge,
 Norway.
2.2.
 Virtual
 environment
The
 VE
 has
 been
 described
 in
 detail
 previously
 [25,26].
 Briefly,
the
 environment
 mimics
 the
 inside
 of
 one
 floor
 in
 a
 large-scale
modern
 office
 building
 with
 rooms,
 corridors
 and
 open
 areas
 of
various
 sizes,
 but
 lacking
 exterior
 windows.
 The
 current
 version
of
 the
 environment
 included
 76
 landmarks
 inside
 and
 6
 landmarks
outside
 the
 office
 building.
 The
 landmarks
 inside
 the
 office
 building
were
 spread
 throughout
 the
 environment,
 and
 each
 of
 them
 con-
sisted
 of
 a
 distinct
 group
 of
 objects
 and/or
 pictures.
 The
 landmarks
outside
 the
 office
 building
 were
 skyscrapers
 visible
 to
 the
 partici-
pants
 through
 the
 glass
 ceiling
 and
 located
 in
 all
 cardinal
 directions
(Fig.
 1A).
2.3.
 Pre
 scanning
After
 inclusion,
 the
 participants
 were
 randomly
 divided
 in
two
 groups.
 One
 group
 received
 0.5
 mg  sublingual
 testosterone
solution;
 
the
 
other
 
received
 
a
 
sublingual
 
placebo
 
solution.
This
 procedure
 was
 double
 blinded;
 both
 solutions
 tasted
 and
looked
 identical,
 and
 were
 in
 identical
 containers
 labels
 A
and
 B.
 Blood
 was
 drawn
 immediately
 before
 administration
of
 testosterone/placebo,
 30
 min
 after
 and
 100
 min
 after.
 Serum
concentrations
 
of
 
total
 
testosterone,
 
estradiol,
 
progesterone,
androstenedione,
 sex
 hormone-binding
 globulin
 (SHBG)
 and
 dehy-
droepiandrosterone
 sulfate
 (DHEAS)
 were
 analyzed.
The
 testosterone
 dose
 used
 in
 the
 current
 study
 was
 0.5
 mg
sublingual
 cyclodextrine-bound
 testosterone
 (ACE
 Pharmaceuti-
cals,
 Zeewolde,
 The
 Netherlands).
 This
 dose
 results
 in
 a
 25-fold
increase
 in
 serum
 testosterone
 (s-testosterone)
 concentration
 with
Tmax (time
 to
 maximum)
 at
 15
 min,
 followed
 by
 a
 slow
 return
to
 baseline
 over
 150
 min
 [69].
 Two
 hours
 after
 administration
 of
placebo/testosterone,
 the
 participants
 began
 exploring
 and
 learn-
ing
 the
 VE
 using
 a
 desktop
 computer.
 They
 began
 by
 exploring
 freely
for
 20
 min,
 followed
 by
 four
 structured
 navigation
 tasks
 of
 varying
length
 to
 become
 familiarized
 with
 the
 VE
 in
 its
 full
 extent
 and
 to
see
 all
 landmarks
 at
 least
 once.
 In
 each
 of
 these
 four
 tasks,
 the
 par-
ticipants
 started
 at
 a
 specific
 landmark
 in
 the
 environment
 and
 had
to
 find
 a
 target
 landmark
 that
 was
 shown
 at
 the
 bottom
 center
 of
 the
screen.
 Upon
 arrival
 at
 the
 target
 landmark,
 a
 new
 target
 landmark
was
 presented.
 The
 participants
 were
 given
 new
 target
 landmarks
in
 the
 same
 manner
 until
 a
 whole
 sequence
 of
 landmarks
 was
 com-
pleted.
 The
 participants
 were
 excluded
 if
 they
 were
 unable
 to
 finish
the
 four
 structured
 navigation
 tasks,
 which
 encompassed
 locating
 a
total
 of
 60
 target
 landmarks
 within
 90
 min.
 Next,
 the
 fMRI
 paradigm
was
 demonstrated,
 followed
 by
 a
 short
 break.
 fMRI
 scanning
 was
commenced
 four
 hours
 after
 placebo/testosterone
 administration,
since
 previous
 fMRI
 studies
 investigating
 the
 impact
 of
 exogenous
testosterone
 on
 different
 cognitive
 and
 emotional
 measures
 have
shown
 effects
 on
 both
 behavior
 and
 brain
 activity
 using
 this
 delay
[10,23,52,54,60].
2.4.
 Scanning
 procedure
Scanning
 was
 performed
 on
 a
 3T
 Siemens
 Trio
 scanner
 with
 a
 32-
channel
 Head
 Matrix
 Coil
 (Siemens
 AG,
 Erlangen,
 Germany).
 Foam
pads
 were
 used
 to
 minimize
 head
 motion.
 The
 fMRI
 stimuli
 were
presented
 on
 an
 LCD
 monitor
 with
 a
 resolution
 of
 1280
 ×
 1024,
 and
the
 participant
 moved
 inside
 the
 virtual
 environment
 using
 an
 MRI
compatible
 joystick
 (Current
 Designs,
 Philadelphia,
 US).

 fMRI
 paradigm
 and

 fMRI
The
 fMRI

 was
 a
 self-paced
 block
 design
 task
 with
 alter-
nating
 blocks
 of
 navigation
 (max.
 duration
 40
 ±
 2
 s),
 and
 odd-even
number
 judgments
 (15
 s),
 the
 latter
 serving
 as
 the
 implicit
 base-
line
 [70].
 In
 the
 navigation
 condition
 participants
 were
 placed
 at
a
 different
 landmark
 at
 the
 start
 of
 each
 block.
 An
 image
 of
 a
 tar-
get
 landmark
 was
 shown
 at
 the
 bottom
 center
 of
 the
 screen,
 and
the
 participants
 were
 instructed
 to
 move
 as
 fast
 and
 accurately
as
 possible
 to
 this
 landmark
 using
 the
 joystick
 (Fig.
 1A).
 Navigat-
ing
 within
 the
 VE
 used
 in
 the
 current
 study
 has
 been
 reported
 to
depend
 on
 MTL
 activity
 in
 several
 previous
 publications
 [25,26].
The
 baseline
 task
 was
 an
 odd-even
 task
 [70]
 which
 involved
 push-
ing
 the
 right
 joystick
 button
 when
 a
 random
 even
 number
 (<100)
appeared
 and
 the
 left
 joystick
 button
 when
 a
 random
 odd
 number
(<100)
 appeared.
 The
 participants
 completed
 three
 experimental
runs,
 with
 15
 navigation
 blocks
 and
 15
 odd-even
 blocks
 in
 each
 run.
The
 order
 of
 the
 blocks
 was
 randomized
 within
 each
 run
 for
 each
participant,
 and
 the
 runs
 were
 randomized
 between
 participants.
Position
 data
 of
 the
 participants’
 movements
 inside
 the
 environ-
ment
 were
 logged
 with
 a
 time
 interval
 of
 30
 ms.
 After
 completing
the
 fMRI
 task,
 the
 participants
 also
 completed
 a
 resting
 state
 fMRI
session
 during
 which
 they
 were
 instructed
 to
 relax
 and
 keep
 their
eyes
 open
 for
 8
 min.

 Post-scanning
After
 scanning
 the
 participants
 completed
 a
 questionnaire
aimed
 at
 assessing
 the
 use
 of
 allocentric
 and
 egocentric
 strategies
when
 navigating
 through
 the
 environment.
 To
 this
 end
 we
 used
 a
study
 specific
 strategy
 questionnaire
 (SSSQ)
 inspired
 by
 the
 sense
of
 direction
 questionnaire-short
 form
 [72],
 but
 pertaining
 specifically
to
 the
 current
 VE.
 The
 SSSQ
 consists
 of
 24
 questions,
 eight
 of
 which
assess
 the
 use
 of
 allocentric
 and
 egocentric
 navigation
 strategies
and
 were
 used
 in
 the
 current
 study.
 These
 eight
 questions
 were;
“At
 the
 start
 of
 a
 task,
 when
 I
 was
 placed
 at
 a
 random
 location
within
 the
 VE,
 I
 located
 my  position
 using.”:
 (1)
 “
 a
 2D
 map-like
representation
 of
 all
 the
 outside
 landmarks”,
 (2)
 “.
 .
 .a  2D
 map-like
representation
 of
 the
 inside
 landmarks”,
 (3)
 “.
 .
 .
 where
 I
 was
 in
a
 sequence
 of
 inside
 landmarks”,
 (4)
 “.
 .
 .where
 I
 was
 in
 a
 spatial
route
 of
 inside
 landmarks”,
 and
 “When
 I
 was
 planning
 where
 to
go
 to
 the
 target
 landmark,
 I
 used.
 .
 .”:
 (5)
 “.
 .
 .a 2D
 map-like
 rep-
resentation
 of
 all
 the
 outside
 landmarks”,
 (6)
 “.
 .
 .a 2D
 map-like
representation
 of
 the
 inside
 landmarks”,
 (7)
 “.
 .
 .
 where
 I
 was
 in
a
 sequence
 of
 inside
 landmarks”,
 (8)
 “.
 .
 .where
 I
 was
 in
 a
 spatial
route
 of
 inside
 landmarks”.
 The
 participants
 rated
 the
 questions
from
 strongly
 agree
 (9)
 to
 strongly
 disagree
 (1).
 Questions
 1,
 2,
 5
and
 6
 entail
 the
 use
 of
 a
 map-like
 representation
 of
 the
 environ-
ment
 and
 thus
 represent
 the
 use
 of
 an
 allocentric
 (world-centered)
strategy
 [73],
 whereas
 questions
 3,
 4,
 7
 and
 8
 entail
 the
 use
 of
 a
sequence/route
 of
 landmarks
 and
 thus
 represent
 the
 use
 of
 an
 ego-
centric
 (self-centered)
 strategy
 [73].
 Scoring
 on
 questions
 3,
 4,
 7
and
 8
 were
 inverted;
 a
 high
 total
 score
 therefore
 represents
 an
allocentric
 strategy
 whereas
 a
 low
 total
 score
 represents
 an
 egocen-
tric
 strategy.
 In
 general,
 men
 rely
 predominantly
 on
 an
 allocentric
strategy
 when
 orienting
 themselves
 in
 an
 environment,
 whereas
women
 more
 often
 use
 an
 egocentric
 strategy
 [65,74].
 Allocentric
navigation
 is
 considered
 to
 rely
 on
 structures
 in
 the
 MTL,
 predom-
inantly
 the
 hippocampus,
 and
 the
 parahippocampal
 and
 posterior
entorhinal
 cortices
 [24,27,28,75–78].
 Egocentric
 navigation,
 on
 the
other
 hand,
 is
 considered
 to
 depend
 on
 the
 striatum
 [28,79–85],
although
 human
 and
 animal
 studies
 also
 suggest
 a
 role
 for
 the
hippocampus
 [24,27,28,75,76].
After
 completing
 the
 SSSQ,
 participants
 were
 asked
 to
 rate
 their
overall
 level
 of
 nausea
 during
 the
 VE
 experience
 on
 a
 scale
 from
 zero
to
 ten.
 During
 VE
 navigation,
 participants
 are
 exposed
 to
 a
 moving
landscape
 without
 appropriate
 physical
 motion,
 which
 is
 known
to
 cause
 nausea
 due
 to
 the
 illusion
 of
 self-motion
 in
 the
 opposite

 78–90
direction
 [86].
 There
 have
 been
 reports
 of
 more
 women
 than
 men
experiencing
 nausea
 during
 virtual
 navigation
 [87].
Subsequently
 the
 participants
 performed
 three
 computer-based
tests
 to
 ascertain
 their
 level
 of
 proficiency
 of
 the
 virtual
 environ-
ment
 [25,26]:
 (1)
 recognition
 of
 landmarks,
 where
 they
 were
 asked
to
 pick
 out
 15
 landmarks
 that
 were
 inside
 the
 environment
 from
a
 collection
 of
 30
 landmarks.
 (2)
 Judgment
 of
 distance
 between
landmarks,
 where
 they
 in
 each
 task
 were
 asked
 to
 pick
 out
 a
 land-
mark
 closest
 to
 a
 reference
 landmark
 from
 a
 collection
 of
 four.
 (3)
Judgment
 of
 direction
 between
 landmarks,
 where
 they
 in
 each
 task
were
 asked
 in
 what
 direction
 a
 target
 landmark
 was
 from
 a
 refer-
ence
 landmark.
 There
 were
 eight
 alternatives
 based
 on
 north-south
and
 east-west
 directions.
 Two
 points
 were
 given
 for
 indicating
 the
correct
 direction
 and
 one
 point
 was
 given
 for
 indicating
 either
 of
the
 two
 adjacent
 directions
 (Fig.
 1B).
2.7.1.
 2D:4D
 measurements
Since
 the
 2D:4D
 ratio
 may
 be
 a
 proxy
 for
 fetal
 testosterone
effects
 that
 in
 turn
 may
 have
 implications
 for
 adult
 performance
on
 cognitive
 tasks,
 this
 factor
 needs
 to
 be
 taken
 into
 consideration
when
 examining
 hormonal
 effects
 on
 cognition.
 Therefore,
 digital
copies
 of
 all
 participants’
 right
 hand
 were
 taken,
 and
 measure-
ments
 of
 the
 2nd
 and
 4th
 digit
 length
 were
 made
 using
 Photoshop
(Adobe
 systems,
 San
 Jose,
 USA).
 All
 digits
 were
 measured
 by
 two
independent
 investigators,
 mean
 value
 reported.
2.7.2.
 Mental
 rotation
The
 Vandenberg
 and
 Kuse
 (VK)
 [3]
 version
 of
 the
 MRT
 is
 con-
sidered
 to
 be
 the
 cognitive
 test
 most
 sensitive
 to
 sex
 differences,
 as
well
 as
 levels
 of
 sex
 hormones
 [2].
 A
 digital
 version
 of
 the
 VK
 MRT
was
 administered
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 experiment,
 approximately
 five
hours
 after
 the
 testosterone/placebo
 administration.
 The
 partici-
pants
 used
 a
 desktop
 computer
 and
 were
 presented
 with
 an
 image
of
 a
 3D-object
 built
 of
 10
 cubes.
 Below
 this
 object
 four
 smaller
objects
 of
 similar
 construction
 were
 displayed.
 Two
 of
 these
 were
correct
 alternatives
 and
 two
 were
 incorrect
 distractors.
 The
 two
correct
 objects
 were
 rotated
 versions
 of
 the
 main
 object;
 the
 dis-
tractors
 were
 rotated
 mirror-objects
 of
 the
 main
 object.
 The
 test
consisted
 of
 20
 problems
 and
 the
 participants
 had
 5
 min
 to
 solve
as
 many
 of
 these
 problems
 as
 possible,
 since
 the
 magnitude
 of
 sex
difference
 in
 MRT
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 be
 linearly
 correlated
 to
 the
amount
 of
 time
 available
 [88].
 Scoring
 is
 done
 by
 giving
 1
 point
if
 both
 choices
 are
 correct
 and
 to
 give
 no
 credit
 otherwise.
 This
eliminates
 the
 need
 to
 correct
 for
 guessing.
2.8.
 Data
 analysis
2.8.1.
 Hormone
 analysis
Hormone
 analyses
 were
 performed
 at
 the
 Department
 of
 Clinical
Chemistry
 at
 St.
 Olav’s
 University
 Hospital
 in
 Trondheim,
 Norway.
Serum
 concentrations
 of
 total
 testosterone
 and
 androstenedione
were
 measured
 by
 liquid
 chromatography
 separation
 followed
 by
tandem
 mass
 spectrometry
 (LC/MS–MS),
 using
 an
 Agilent
 1290
chromatograph
 with
 an
 Agilent
 6410
 Triple
 Quad
 LC/MS–MS
 detec-
tor
 (Agilent,
 California,
 USA).
 Serum
 concentrations
 of
 estradiol,
progesterone,
 SHBG
 and
 DHEAS
 were
 analyzed
 by
 electrochemi-
luminescence
 immunoassay
 (ECLI)
 in
 a
 Roche
 Modular
 E
 analyzer
(Roche
 Diagnostics,
 Mannheim,
 Germany).
 The
 intra-
 and
 interas-
say
 coefficients
 of
 variation
 were
 3.0
 and
 6.0%
 for
 testosterone,
 3.2
and
 5.0%
 for
 androstenedione,
 3.8
 and
 3.8%
 for
 estradiol,
 4.4
 and
4.1%
 for
 progesterone,
 2.3
 and
 2.4%
 for
 SHBG,
 and
 3.7
 and
 4.8%
 for
DHEAS,
 respectively.
 To
 estimate
 testosterone
 load,
 the
 area
 under
the
 curve
 (AUC)
 for
 s-testosterone
 during
 the
 first
 100
 min
 was
 cal-
culated
 using
 trapezoidal
 approximation.
 Statistically
 significant
differences
 in
 hormone
 levels
 were
 identified
 using
 a
 mixed
 ANOVA
model.
 A
 corrected
 p-value
 of
 <0.05
 using
 the
 Benjamini-Hochberg
method,
 which
 controls
 the
 false
 discovery
 rate,
 was
 considered
significant
 [89].
2.8.2.
 Demographic
 and
 performance
 data
 analysis
Group
 differences
 in
 age,
 2D:4D
 ratio,
 day
 in
 the
 menstrual
 cycle,
testosterone
 load
 and
 nausea
 were
 investigated
 with
 independent-
sample
 t-tests
 and
 not
 corrected
 for
 multiple
 comparisons,
 since
avoiding
 type
 I
 errors
 when
 describing
 the
 two
 groups
 was
 the
primary
 objective.
 A
 MANCOVA
 was
 run
 to
 examine
 the
 effects
of
 drug
 group
 (placebo/testosterone)
 on
 the
 outcome
 measures,
using
 2D:4D
 as
 covariate
 to
 identify
 any
 potentiating
 effects
 of
fetal
 testosterone
 levels.
 There
 were
 eight
 outcome
 measures;
 total
learning
 time
 (time
 to
 complete
 the
 structured
 learning
 tasks),
navigation
 success
 (percentage
 of
 tasks
 completed
 within
 the
 VE
during
 fMRI),
 navigation
 success
 time
 (mean
 time
 to
 complete
 all
successful
 fMRI
 navigation
 task),
 scores
 on
 the
 three
 post-scanning
tests
 of
 landmark
 recognition,
 distance
 and
 direction,
 navigation
strategy
 (SSSQ
 score)
 and
 finally
 MRT
 score.
 A
 corrected
 p-value
of
 <0.05
 using
 the
 Benjamini-Hochberg
 method
 was
 considered
significant
 [89].
 Pearson’s
 product-moment
 correlations
 were
 cal-
culated
 to
 assess
 the
 relationship
 between
 testosterone
 load
 and
scores
 on
 the
 two
 tests
 where
 a
 group
 difference
 was
 found,
 MRT
and
 VE
 direction,
 and
 between
 MRT
 score
 and
 navigation
 success.
An
 uncorrected
 p-value
 of
 <0.05
 was
 considered
 significant.
 All
 sta-
tistical
 data
 were
 analyzed
 in
 SPSS
 21.0
 (SPSS
 Inc.,
 Chicago,
 Illinois,
USA).
2.8.3.
 MRI
 data
 analysis
Distortion
 correction
 of
 the
 T2* weighted
 images
 was
 conducted
using
 spin
 echo
 images
 with
 opposite
 polarities
 [71].
 Imaging
 data
were
 then
 analyzed
 using
 FSL
 4.1.8
 (Analysis
 Group,
 FMRIB,
 Oxford,
UK).
 Non-brain
 tissue
 was
 removed
 from
 the
 T1W
 anatomical
images
 using
 BET2
 with
 robust
 center
 estimation
 (Brain
 Extraction
Tool,
 FMRIB,
 Oxford,
 UK).
 The
 resulting
 images
 were
 transformed
to
 the
 MNI
 1
 ×
 1
 ×
 1
 mm
 template
 (Montreal
 Neurological
 Insti-
tute,
 Montreal,
 QC,
 Canada)
 nonlinearly
 with
 FNIRT
 (FMRIB,
 Oxford
UK).
 The
 fMRI
 data
 was
 motion
 corrected
 using
 MCFLIRT,
 using
 the
median
 volume
 of
 each
 run
 as
 reference.
 Next,
 each
 functional
 run
was
 co-registered
 to
 the
 whole
 brain
 EPI
 image,
 and
 subsequently
to
 the
 anatomical
 T1W
 image,
 before
 it
 was
 transformed
 into
 MNI
space
 by
 using
 the
 transformation
 matrix
 obtained
 with
 the
 T1W
image.
 The
 functional
 data
 was
 smoothed
 with
 a
 3
 mm
 full-width
at
 half-maximum
 Gaussian
 filter,
 and
 temporally
 high-pass
 filtered
with
 a
 cut-off
 time
 of
 250
 s.
2.8.4.
 fMRI
 data
 analysis
The
 statistical
 analysis
 of
 the
 fMRI
 data
 was
 carried
 out
 in
FEAT
 (FEAT,
 FMRIB,
 Oxford,
 UK).
 Conditions
 were
 modeled
 accord-
ing
 to
 a
 boxcar
 stimulus
 function
 convolved
 with
 a
 two-gamma
hemodynamic
 response
 function.
 The
 effect
 of
 each
 condition
was
 estimated
 with
 GLM
 using
 FLAME
 1
 (FMRIB’s
 Local
 Analy-
sis
 of
 Mixed
 Effects).
 A
 brain
 mask
 was
 applied
 to
 investigate
activation
 in
 the
 MTL
 only.
 The
 mask
 was
 created
 from
 the
probabilistic
 maps
 of
 the
 Harvard
 Oxford
 Structural
 Atlases
(http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases),
 using
 no
 probability
threshold.
 The
 mask
 contained
 92,469
 1
 mm voxels,
 and
 included
the
 left
 and
 right
 hippocampus,
 parahippocampal
 gyrus
 and
 amyg-
dala.
 Effects
 of
 testosterone
 on
 brain
 activity
 during
 navigation
were
 investigated
 by
 the
 contrasts

 In
 the
 latter,
 runs
 with

 were
 excluded
 (7%
 across

 Moreover,
 the

 to

 and
 were
 preprocessed
 as
 described
 in
 Sec-
tion
 2.8.3. The
 preprocessed

 were
 temporally
 concatenated
across
 participants
 to
 create
 a
 single

 dataset
 using
 MELODIC.
Thirty
 independent
 components
 were
 extracted,
 each
 represent-
ing
 a
 network
 of
 brain
 regions
 with
 correlating
 BOLD

 The
 dual
 regression
 method
 [91]
 was
 used
 to
 estimate
the
 correspondence
 between
 each
 of
 these
 components
 and
 the
individual

 Group

 were
 tested
 with
non-parametric
 permutations
 as
 implemented
 in
 FSL’s
 randomise
tool,
 controlling
 for
 the
 family-wise

 Results
3.1.
 Participants
Seven
 (three
 in
 testosterone
 group)
 of
 the
 53
 included
 partici-
pants
 were
 unable
 to
 finish
 the
 VE
 learning
 period
 due
 to
 excessive
nausea,
 and
 these
 participants
 were
 therefore
 excluded
 from
 fur-
ther
 participation.
 Of
 the
 46
 remaining
 women,
 four
 (two
 in
 the
testosterone
 group)
 were
 excluded
 for
 failing
 to
 complete
 the
 struc-
tured
 learning
 task
 in
 the
 VE
 within
 the
 predefined
 90
 min
 time
limit.
 Only
 results
 from
 the
 42
 participants
 (21
 in
 each
 drug
 group)
who
 completed
 the
 entire
 experiment
 were
 included
 in
 the
 anal-
yses.
 There
 were
 no

 Discussion
In
 the
 current
 study,
 testosterone
 administration
 was
 found
to
 increase
 MTL
 activity
 related
 to
 successful
 navigation,
 but
 did
not
 affect
 behavioral
 measures
 of
 navigation
 success
 even
 though
MRT
 performance
 was
 significantly
 improved.
 The
 results
 point
 to
increased
 testosterone
 levels
 having
 a
 limited
 effect
 on
 spatial
 cog-
nition,
 pertaining
 specifically
 to
 performance
 on
 tasks
 probing
 3D
representations
 of
 space,
 since
 the
 testosterone
 group
 also
 per-
formed
 notably
 better
 on
 the
 VE
 direction
 task.
 Thus
 testosterone
levels
 appeared
 to
 have
 direct
 impact
 on
 certain
 basic
 aspects
 of
spatial
 cognition
 in
 women,
 while
 more
 complex
 spatial
 behaviors,
such
 as
 navigation,
 remained
 unaffected
 despite
 adaptive
 changes
in
 MTL
 activity
 indicating
 improved
 neuronal
 processing.
The
 testosterone
 group
 had
 bilaterally
 increased
 MTL
 activity
compared
 to
 the
 placebo
 group
 for
 successful
 >
 failed
 navigation
while
 there
 was
 no
 difference
 in
 level
 of
 activity

 This
 provides
 empirical
 evidence
 for
 a
 spe-
cific
 effect
 of
 testosterone
 on
 neuronal
 activity
 related
 to
 successful
task
 completion,
 as
 opposed
 to
 a
 more
 generalized
 increase
 in
neuronal
 activity
 shown
 in
 previous
 studies
 [52–57].
 The
 overall
level
 of
 activity
 (z-scores)
 was
 generally
 higher
 throughout
 the
entire
 MTL
 in
 the
 testosterone
 group,
 as
 reflected
 in
 the
 results
 of
the
 direct
 group
 comparison.
 The
 significant
 correlation
 between
testosterone
 level
 and
 MTL
 activity
 during
 successful
 navigation,
suggested
 that
 the
 genomic
 effect
 of
 testosterone
 on
 MTL
 activ-
ity
 was
 directly
 dependent
 on
 s-testosterone
 load.
 The
 increased
hippocampal
 activity
 in
 the
 testosterone
 group
 during
 success-
ful
 navigation
 was
 located
 anteriorly,
 with
 coordinates
 similar
 to
those
 found
 when
 correlating
 VE
 navigation
 activity
 with
 success
[26]
 and
 correlating
 VE
 navigation
 activity
 with
 precise
 knowl-
edge
 of
 the
 global
 directions
 within
 a
 VE
 in
 men
 [25].
 These
 results
suggest
 that
 differences
 in
 hippocampal
 activity
 found
 during
 suc-
cessful
 navigation
 in
 the
 present
 study
 reflect
 improved
 spatial
representations
 of
 the
 environment
 considered
 to
 reflect
 allocen-
tric
 strategies.
 It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 increased
 amygdala
 activity
during
 navigation
 is
 uncommon,
 although
 observed
 in
 some
 studies
in
 men
 [25,27].
 When
 examining
 the
 two
 drug
 groups
 separately,
amygdala
 activity
 was
 only
 present
 in
 the
 testosterone
 group,
 even
when
 examining
 sub-threshold
 activation
 (results
 not
 shown).
This
 demonstrated
 a
 specific
 effect
 of
 testosterone
 on
 amygdala
activity.
 Interestingly,
 both
 androgen
 and
 estradiol
 receptors
 are
particularly
 densely
 expressed
 in
 the
 adult
 amygdala
 [94–96],
and
 the
 structure
 is
 enriched
 with
 the
 testosterone
 converting
enzyme
 aromatase
 [97].
 Indeed,
 a
 common
 finding
 across
 previous
studies
 of
 testosterone
 administration
 in
 women
 is
 that
 testos-
terone
 alters
 amygdala
 activity
 and
 connectivity;
 for
 example,
testosterone
 increases
 amygdala
 activity
 in
 response
 to
 emotional
faces
 [53,55]
 and
 reduces
 the
 functional
 coupling
 between
 the
amygdala
 and
 orbitofrontal
 cortex
 during
 face
 judgment
 tasks
[54,58].
Surprisingly,
 the
 specific
 increase
 in
 MTL
 activity
 was
 not
accompanied
 by
 increased
 navigation
 performance
 in
 the
 testos-
terone
 group.
 MTL
 activity
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 increase
 during
successful
 navigation,
 is
 associated
 with
 improved
 performance,
and
 is
 higher
 in
 men
 compared
 with
 women
 during
 navigation
[25,26,98,99].
 It
 was
 therefore
 unexpected
 that
 the
 observed

BOLD
 signal
 increase
 in
 the
 testosterone
 group
 was
 accompanied
by
 similar
 performance
 as
 in
 the
 placebo
 group.
 We  speculate
 that
the
 women
 were
 unable
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 the
 altered
 neuronal
activity
 and
 instead
 continued
 to
 rely
 on
 an
 egocentric
 naviga-
tion
 strategy,
 as
 demonstrated
 by
 the
 SSSQ.
 Even
 though
 they
 had
better
 representations
 of
 the
 direction
 between
 landmarks
 in
 the
VE,
 they
 did
 not
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 this
 information
 and
 make
shortcuts.
 This
 was
 demonstrated
 by
 the
 finding
 that
 both
 drug
groups
 used
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 time
 to
 reach
 the
 target
 land-
marks.
 Lack
 of
 experience
 with
 1st
 person
 computer
 games
 among
the
 participants
 may
 have
 made
 them
 less
 able
 to
 take
 advantage
of
 the
 testosterone
 effects
 during
 VE
 navigation.
 Supporting
 this
notion
 is
 the
 finding
 of
 significantly
 better
 performance
 on
 the
 VE
direction
 test
 in
 the
 testosterone
 group,
 which
 is
 less
 dependent
on
 computer
 game
 experience.
 Adding
 computer
 game
 experi-
ence
 as
 a
 covariate
 in
 analyses
 of
 sex
 differences
 in
 navigation
 has
produced
 conflicting
 results,
 with
 some
 studies
 reporting
 dimin-
ished
 sex
 differences
 [100,101],
 whereas
 others
 find
 no
 effect
 [12].
Furthermore,
 one
 dose
 of
 testosterone
 may
 have
 positive
 effects
on
 simpler
 tasks
 such
 as
 the
 MRT
 and
 VE
 direction
 test,
 and
 at
the
 same
 time
 be
 insufficient
 to
 alter
 complex
 learned
 behav-
iors
 such
 as
 navigation.
 It
 is
 also
 important
 to
 take
 into
 account
the
 difficulty
 of
 a
 task,
 since
 ceiling
 or
 flooring
 effects
 may
 mask
group
 differences.
 Indeed,
 the
 VE
 related
 knowledge
 measurements
were
 increasingly
 difficult,
 as
 reflected
 by
 the
 participants’
 mean
scores
 (recognition:
 99%,
 distance:
 63%,
 direction:
 47%).
 As
 such,
it
 might
 be
 that
 an
 effect
 of
 testosterone
 is
 only
 observed
 when
the
 task
 becomes
 difficult
 enough
 to
 avoid
 ceiling
 effects.
 Indeed,
in
 addition
 to
 the
 large
 effect
 seen
 in
 the
 direction
 test
 (d
 =
 1.06),
a
 non-significant
 improvement
 was
 also
 seen
 in
 the
 distance
test
 scores
 (d
 =
 .43).
 Alternatively,
 the
 distribution
 of
 testosterone
receptors
 may
 be
 such
 that
 regions
 subserving
 3D
 representations
of
 space
 (MRT
 and
 VE
 direction)
 are
 enriched
 with
 testosterone
receptors
 and/or
 more
 amendable
 to
 its
 effects.
 Further,
 it
 is
also
 possible
 that
 the
 increased
 BOLD
 signal
 in
 the
 testosterone
group
 reflects
 changes
 in
 neuronal
 excitability
 per
 se,
 i.e.,
 not
related
 to
 functional
 or
 behavioral
 effects.
 Neuroactive
 steroids
have
 been
 shown
 to
 increase
 neuronal
 excitability
 [102],
 which
 in
turn
 could
 result
 in
 the
 increased
 BOLD
 signal
 observed
 in
 the
 cur-
rent
 study.
 It
 has
 been
 suggested
 that
 the
 effects
 of
 androgens
 on
hippocampal
 spine
 density
 could
 involve
 a
 rapid
 GABA-mediated
disinhibition
 of
 pyramidal
 cells
 in
 the
 hippocampus
 [103].
 If
indeed
 testosterone
 works
 by
 disinhibiting
 glutaminergic
 pyra-
midal
 cells
 in
 the
 hippocampus,
 which
 increases
 excitability,
 this
could
 be
 a
 possible
 biological
 model
 for
 the
 increase
 in
 BOLD
response
 seen
 in
 the
 present
 study.
 However,
 increased
 neuronal
excitability
 does
 not
 by
 itself
 predict
 improved
 performance.
 Fur-
thermore,
 navigation
 in
 general
 should
 lead
 to
 increased
 BOLD
signal
 in
 this
 model,
 while
 we
 observed
 increased
 MTL
 activity
only
 for
 the
 contrast
 successful
 >
 failed
 navigation.
 Thus
 a
 gen-
eral
 increase
 in
 neuronal
 excitability
 seems
 unlikely
 although
testosterone
 levels
 have
 been
 shown
 to
 correlate
 with
 a
 nonspe-
cific
 increase
 in
 brain
 activity
 in
 women
 [104].
 Taken
 together,
in
 women
 testosterone
 administration
 had
 a
 significant
 and
 spe-
cific
 physiological
 effect
 on
 the
 BOLD
 signal
 in
 the
 MTL
 related
to
 successful
 navigation,
 which
 did
 not
 translate
 into
 improved
navigation.
Testosterone
 did
 not
 change
 our
 measures
 of
 resting
 state
functional
 connectivity.
 Small,
 but
 robust
 differences
 in
 resting
state
 networks
 have
 been
 demonstrated
 between
 men
 and
 women
[105],
 and
 a
 recent
 resting
 state
 fMRI
 study
 showed
 that
 the
 neu-
rosteroids
 allopregnanolone
 and
 dehydroepiandrosterone
 reduced
resting
 state
 functional
 connectivity
 of
 the
 amygdala
 with
 frontal,
parietal
 and
 temporal
 areas
 [106].
 Moreover,
 different
 testos-
terone
 derivatives
 have
 been
 shown
 to
 change
 the
 functional
connectivity
 between
 amygdala
 and
 cortical
 regions
 [54,58].
 The
dual-regression
 approach
 that
 was
 implemented
 in
 the
 present
study
 has
 been
 demonstrated
 to
 be
 the
 method
 of
 choice
 in
 detect-
ing
 group
 differences
 in
 resting
 state
 functional
 connectivity
 [105].
Previously,
 seed-based
 functional
 connectivity
 approaches
 have
been
 used
 in
 studies
 with
 exogenous
 testosterone
 which
 have
shown
 increased
 functional
 coupling
 of
 the
 amygdalae
 after
 testos-
terone
 administration
 [54,58].
 It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 we
 did
 not
investigate
 task-related
 functional
 connectivity
 as
 in
 the
 above-
mentioned
 studies,
 but
 rather
 functional
 networks
 during
 rest.
Generally,
 sex
 differences
 in
 resting
 state
 networks
 are
 weak
 and
require
 large
 samples
 to
 reach
 significance
 [105],
 which
 might
explain
 the
 lack
 of
 significant
 effect
 of
 testosterone
 on
 resting
 state
networks
 in
 this
 study.
Testosterone
 administration
 was
 associated
 with
 improved
 per-
formance
 on
 MRT,
 in
 accordance
 with
 previous
 work
 [10].
 The
 effect
size
 found
 in
 the
 current
 study
 (d
 =
 .90)
 is
 comparable
 to
 studies
 of
testosterone
 effects
 in
 women
 (d
 =
 .95)
 [10]
 and
 to
 studies
 com-
paring
 men
 and
 women
 (mean
 d
 =
 0.94)
 [2].
 In
 addition,
 we
 found
a
 positive
 correlation
 between
 testosterone
 load
 and
 MRT
 perfor-
mance,
 further
 supporting
 the
 notion
 that
 women
 with
 relatively
high
 concentrations
 of
 testosterone
 perform
 better
 than
 their
 coun-
terparts
 on
 MRT
 [107].
 The
 MRT
 was
 performed
 outside
 the
 scanner
as
 the
 focus
 of
 this
 paper
 was
 navigation
 and
 navigation
 related
MTL
 activity
 after
 testosterone
 administration,
 and
 a
 review
 of
neuroimaging
 studies
 of
 mental
 rotation
 has
 shown
 that
 MRT
 per-
formance
 primarily
 rely
 on
 activity
 in
 parietal
 and
 frontal
 regions
which
 are
 outside
 the
 FOV
 used
 currently
 [43].
 A
 positive
 correla-
tion
 between
 parietal
 BOLD
 response
 and
 endogenous
 testosterone
concentration
 in
 women
 during
 MRT
 performance
 has
 been
 found,
but
 the
 effect
 of
 successful
 versus
 failed
 trials
 was
 not
 specifically
investigated
 [108].
 Thus,
 the
 neuronal
 correlates
 specifically
 under-
lying
 testosterone’s
 positive
 effects
 on
 MRT
 remain
 unknown.
 MRT
performance
 and
 VE
 navigation
 success
 tended
 towards
 (p
 =
 .053),
but
 were
 not
 significantly
 correlated,
 in
 contrast
 to
 what
 has
 previ-
ously
 been
 reported
 when
 comparing
 performance
 on
 the
 MRT
 and
a
 vMWT
 [7,8].
 The
 correlation
 coefficient
 in
 the
 current
 study
 and
 in
[7,8]
 are
 quite
 similar
 though.
 The
 lack
 of
 a
 significant
 correlation
might
 reflect
 the
 complexity
 of
 the
 current
 environment,
 which
stand
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 simpler
 design
 of
 the
 vMWT.
 Additionally,
the
 vMWT
 is
 a
 direct
 test
 of
 allocentric
 navigation
 whereas
 tests
 in
the
 current
 environment
 with
 all
 its
 landmarks
 could
 be
 completed
equally
 well
 relying
 on
 egocentric
 information,
 which
 was
 the
 pre-
ferred
 strategy
 in
 both
 the
 testosterone
 and
 the
 placebo
 groups
 in
this
 study.
The
 present
 study
 did
 not
 detect
 any
 significant
 interaction
between
 2D:4D
 ratio,
 as
 measure
 of
 fetal
 testosterone
 exposure,
and
 adult
 testosterone
 administration.
 There
 was
 a
 trend
 towards
 a
positive
 effect
 of
 fetal
 testosterone
 levels
 on
 MRT,
 possibly
 suggest-
ing
 a
 weak
 organizational
 effect
 of
 testosterone,
 modulating
 adult
testosterone
 responsivity
 on
 the
 most
 testosterone
 sensitive
 test.
There
 was
 also
 a
 trend
 towards
 a
 positive
 correlation
 between
 the
2D:4D
 ratio
 and
 parahippocampal
 activity,
 and
 group
 differences
 in
parahippocampal
 activity
 disappeared
 when
 including
 2D:4D
 ratio
as
 a
 confounder.
 Thus
 the
 organizational
 effects
 of
 testosterone
appeared
 to
 be
 limited
 to
 the
 parahippocampal
 cortex.
 This
 finding
is
 in
 line
 with
 evidence
 pointing
 to
 a
 protracted
 postnatal
 develop-
ment
 of
 the
 hippocampus
 and
 possibly
 the
 amygdala,
 which
 may
make
 these
 structures
 less
 affected
 by
 the
 organizational
 effects
 of
testosterone
 [109,110].
 The
 limited
 effect
 of
 2D:4D
 ratio
 on
 MRT
performance
 is
 divergent
 from
 the
 role
 of
 2D:4D
 ratio
 for
 empathy,
which
 is
 reported
 to
 explain
 >50%
 of
 the
 variance
 [23].
 The
 spatial
abilities
 tested
 here
 appeared
 to
 be
 either
 unaffected
 by
 exoge-
nous
 testosterone
 as
 well
 as
 2D:4D
 ratio
 (i.e.,
 navigation
 ability
and
 distance
 test),
 or
 largely
 explained
 by
 exogenous
 testosterone
and
 trending
 towards
 an
 effect
 of
 2D:4D
 ratio
 (MRT,
 direction
 test
and
 parahippocampal
 BOLD
 signal).
 Taken
 together,
 these
 findings

 to

4.1.
 Methodological
 considerations
The
 current
 study
 included
 a
 reliable
 method
 for
 measuring
several
 hormones
 and
 hormone
 binding
 proteins,
 and
 testos-
terone
 administration
 led
 to
 an
 isolated,
 significant
 increase
 in
testosterone
 levels.
 We  observed
 large
 variance
 in
 the
 serum
 con-
centration
 of
 testosterone
 after
 30
 min
 (range
 11–97-fold
 increase
from
 baseline).
 Similarly,
 a
 large
 variance
 in
 clearance
 rate
 was
observed
 (range
 80–91%
 reduction
 between
 30
 and
 100
 min).
 This
variability
 may
 be
 due
 to
 individual
 differences
 in
 the
 concentra-
tion
 of
 other
 hormones,
 sex
 binding
 proteins,
 or
 other
 factors.
 With
such
 a
 large
 variance,
 the
 use
 of
 AUC
 of
 s-testosterone
 between
our
 three
 measurements
 is
 a
 more
 representative
 measure
 of
 total
testosterone
 load
 at
 the
 individual
 level
 than
 peak
 serum
 concen-
tration
 of
 testosterone
 [111].
 Inclusion
 of
 naturally
 cycling
 women
who
 have
 lower
 levels
 of
 SHBG
 might
 have
 increased
 the
 free
fraction
 of
 testosterone
 [69],
 which
 in
 turn
 could
 potentiate
 testos-
terone’s
 effects
 on
 spatial
 abilities.
 Still,
 the
 testosterone
 dose
 vastly
exceeded
 the
 binding
 capacity
 of
 SHBG
 in
 the
 non-naturally
 cycling
women
 included.
 We  therefore
 do
 not
 believe
 that
 using
 non-
naturally
 cycling
 women
 impacted
 on
 the
 results.
 It
 should
 be
noted
 that
 previous
 studies
 that
 included
 women
 on
 oral
 contra-
ceptives
 report
 significant
 effects
 of
 oral
 testosterone
 on
 behavior
[23,52,54].
 Including
 women
 that
 were
 not
 matched
 on
 menstrual
phase
 would
 have
 introduced
 numerous
 biases
 caused
 by
 fluctu-
ating
 and
 varying
 hormone
 levels
 [9,67,68].
 By
 including
 women
during
 the
 phase
 when
 sex
 hormones
 are
 at
 the
 lowest
 level,
 we
opted
 to
 maximize
 any
 effect
 of
 exogenous
 testosterone
 in
 this
 first
study
 of
 testosterone
 administration
 effects
 on
 female
 navigation.
This
 approach
 does,
 however,
 reduce
 the
 generalizability
 of
 our
results.
 Moreover,
 the
 time
 interval
 between
 testosterone
 admin-
istration
 and
 primary
 task
 performance
 outcome
 was
 four
 hours
 in
the
 current
 study,
 similar
 to
 that
 in
 previous
 studies.
 Still,
 no
 effect
of
 testosterone
 was
 detected
 on
 navigation
 behavior
 in
 the
 cur-
rent
 study
 although
 the
 MRT
 performance
 effect
 was
 as
 previously
described
 in
 the
 literature.
 Whether
 testosterone
 administration
affects
 all
 higher
 cognitive
 functions
 with
 a
 similar
 time
 course
 is
unknown.
 However,
 using
 a
 four-hour
 time
 window
 has
 previously
been
 shown
 to
 affect
 a
 variety
 of
 measures
 [10,23,52,54,60].
 The
current
 study
 also
 found
 significantly
 improved
 MRT
 and
 direc-
tion
 test
 performance
 as
 well
 as
 increased
 BOLD
 signal
 around
 four
hours
 after
 testosterone
 administration,
 showing
 that
 other
 effects
than
 choice
 of
 time
 window
 are
 likely
 to
 underlie
 the
 lack
 of
 effect
of
 testosterone
 on
 navigation
 performance.
It
 should
 also
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 restricted
 FOV
 during
 fMRI
 and
the
 use
 of
 an
 anatomical
 mask
 in
 the
 analysis
 of
 the
 fMRI
 data
 made
areas
 outside
 the
 MTL
 unavailable
 for
 analysis.
 Thus,
 differences
 in
activity
 in
 other
 brain
 areas
 such
 as
 the
 retrosplenial
 cortex,
 pre-
cuneus
 or
 caudate
 nucleus,
 which
 might
 be
 expected
 based
 on
 the
participants’
 inclination
 towards
 an
 egocentric
 navigation
 strat-
egy,
 could
 not
 be
 addressed.
 The
 focus
 of
 the
 current
 study
 was,
however,
 on
 differences
 in
 the
 MTL
 since
 direct
 evidence
 of
 acti-
vational
 effects
 of
 testosterone
 is
 largely
 limited
 to
 this
 area
 [36].
In
 addition,
 sex
 differences
 in
 virtual
 navigation
 may
 have
 been
easier
 to
 detect
 in
 VEs
 with
 only
 distal
 reference
 points
 [112].
 The
VE
 in
 the
 current
 study
 consisted
 of
 both
 distal
 and
 proximal
 cues
in
 order
 to
 mimic
 an
 ecologically
 valid
 navigation
 situation
 with
both
 proximal
 and
 distal
 landmarks.
 A
 surprisingly
 large
 effect
 of
testosterone
 administration
 was
 found
 on
 nausea.
 However,
 no
 cor-
relation
 was
 found
 between
 performance
 in
 the
 VE
 and
 level
 of
nausea,
 and
 we
 therefore
 do
 not
 believe
 this
 difference
 affected
our
 results.
 Finally,
 a
 note
 should
 be
 made
 regarding
 the
 statisti-
cal
 thresholds
 used.
 In
 this
 study,
 we
 have
 grouped
 the
 variables
into
 four
 “families”
 that
 have
 been
 treated
 separately:
 the
 baseline
comparisons,
 the
 hormonal
 measurements,
 the
 fMRI
 results
 and
the
 behavioral
 outcome
 measurements.
 Tests
 within
 a
 family
 were
corrected
 for
 multiple
 comparisons
 using
 the
 Benjamini-Hochberg
method
 [89]
 which
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 work
 even
 with
 dependent
measurements
 [113]
 such
 as
 for
 several
 of
 the
 behavioral
 outcome
measures.
 No
 corrections
 for
 multiple
 comparisons
 were
 applied
for
 the
 correlation
 analyses.
 Caution
 should
 therefore
 be
 made
when
 interpreting
 these
 findings.

 Conclusions
The
 current
 study
 confirmed
 that
 there
 is
 a
 relationship
 between
testosterone
 load
 and
 mental
 rotation
 abilities
 in
 healthy
 women.
We
 further
 showed
 that
 women
 who
 received
 testosterone
 had
 sig-
nificantly
 improved
 representation
 of
 the
 direction
 within
 the
 VE.
No
 effects
 of
 testosterone
 on
 navigation
 performance
 were
 found
despite
 increased
 brain
 activity
 within
 the
 MTL
 specifically
 dur-
ing
 successful
 navigation
 in
 the
 testosterone
 group.
 In
 the
 MTL,
navigation
 activity
 in
 the
 parahippocampal
 cortex
 was
 shown
 to
be
 sensitive
 to
 both
 activational
 and
 organizational
 testosterone
effects.
 Why
 certain
 behaviors
 and
 certain
 brain
 regions
 were
 more
sensitive
 to
 testosterone
 remain
 uncertain.
 We  speculate
 that
 this
is
 either
 related
 to
 differences
 in
 the
 effect
 of
 exogenous
 testos-
terone
 in
 brain
 regions
 supporting
 the
 task
 at
 hand
 (localization
and
 concentration
 of
 receptors,
 enzyme
 activity,
 and
 organizational
effects),
 and/or
 that
 some
 tasks
 can
 be
 solved
 equally
 well
 using
 dif-
ferent
 strategies
 and
 are
 therefore
 less
 susceptible
 to
 the
 effects
 of
testosterone,
 and
 more
 dependent
 on
 habit.
