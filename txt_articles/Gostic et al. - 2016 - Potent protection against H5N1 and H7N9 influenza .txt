INFLUENZA EPIDEMIOLOGY
Potent protection against H5N1 and
H7N9 influenza via childhood
hemagglutinin imprinting
Katelyn M. Gostic,1 Monique Ambrose,1 Michael Worobey,2* James O. Lloyd-Smith1,3*
Two zoonotic influenza A viruses (IAV) of global concern, H5N1 and H7N9, exhibit
unexplained differences in age distribution of human cases. Using data from all known
human cases of these viruses, we show that an individual’s first IAV infection confers
lifelong protection against severe disease from novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes in
the same phylogenetic group. Statistical modeling shows that protective HA imprinting is
the crucial explanatory factor, and it provides 75% protection against severe infection and
80% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict
age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and demonstrate that a novel
strain’s pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype
dominates seasonal influenza circulation. These findings open new frontiers for rational
pandemic risk assessment.
T
he spillover of novel influenza A viruses
(IAV) is a persistent threat to global health.
H5N1 and H7N9 are particularly concern-
ing avian-origin IAVs, each having caused
hundreds of severe or fatal human cases (1).
Despite commonalities in their reservoir hosts
and epidemiology, these viruses show puzzling
differences in age distribution of observed human
cases (1, 2). Existing explanations—including pos-
sible protection against H5N1 among older birth-
year cohorts exposed to the neuraminidase of
H1N1 as children (3, 4) or age biases in exposure
to infected poultry (5–7)—cannot fully explain
these opposing patterns of severe disease and
mortality. Another idea is that severity of H5N1
and H7N9 differs by age and so leads to case as-
certainment biases (1), but no explanatory mech-
anism has been proposed.
The key antigenic determinants for IAV sus-
ceptibility are the virus’s two surface glycopro-
teins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA), where different numbered subtypes canon-
ically indicate no cross-immunity. However, recent
experiments have revealed that broadly protective
immune responses can provide cross-immunity
between different HA subtypes, particularly sub-
types in the same phylogenetic group (8–14). HA
group 1 contains human seasonal subtypes H1,
H2, and avian H5, whereas group 2 contains
seasonal H3 and avian H7 (Fig. 1A and fig. S1).
Combining these insights into heterosubtypic im-
munity with the concept of “original antigenic
sin” (15) or “antigenic seniority” (16), we hypothe-
sized that individuals imprint on the HA group
of their first IAV exposure and thereby experience
a reduced risk of severe disease from novel IAVs
within that same phylogenetic group. This hypo-
thesis predicts that the 1968 pandemic, which
marked the transition from an era of group 1 HA
circulation (1918–1968) to a group 2–dominated
one (1968 to the present) (Fig. 1B), caused a major
shift in population susceptibility that would ex-
plain why H5N1 cases are generally detected in
younger people than are H7N9 cases (2, 17–19).
Our analysis of human cases of H5N1 and H7N9
revealed strong evidence that childhood HA im-
printing indeed provides profound, lifelong pro-
tection against severe infection and death from
these viruses. These findings allowed us to develop
new approaches for IAV pandemic risk assess-
ment, preparedness, and response but also raise
possible challenges for future vaccination strategies.
Reconstructing IAV exposure history
by birth year
To investigate whether an individual’s initial child-
hood exposure to IAV influences later susceptibility
to H5 and H7 viruses, we estimated the fraction of
each birth-year cohort from 1918 to 2015 with first
exposure to H1, H2, or H3—or the fraction still
naïve—for each country in our study (China, Egypt,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam). We
estimated the annual probability of IAV infection
in children using published age-seroprevalence
data (20, 21) and then rescaled this baseline at-
tack rate to account for year-to-year variability in
IAV circulation intensity (supplementary text).
One resulting country-specific reconstruction
of HA history is depicted in Fig. 1C. Although
H3N2 has dominated since 1968, a non-negligible
fraction of many birth-year cohorts from the 1970s
onward was exposed first to H1N1 viruses, with
notable peaks near the reemergence of H1N1 in
1977 and the 2009 pandemic.
H5N1 and H7N9 cases track HA
imprinting patterns
Next, we compiled data on all known human cases
of H5N1 and H7N9 with reported patient age
(Fig. 2, A and B). These data encompass mostly
clinically severe and fatal cases; total incidence
remains unknown. Thus, our analysis focused on
the determinants of severe cases. The possible
existence of many undetected mild cases, as hy-
pothesized for H7N9 (1), is consistent with HA
imprinting because broadly protective immune
responses are expected to provide partial protec-
tion (8, 14), i.e., to reduce severity without prevent-
ing infection altogether (4, 12, 22–25).
The preponderance of observed H7N9 cases
among older cohorts and of H5N1 cases among
younger cohorts is clear (Fig. 2, A and B). These
patterns reflect birth year, not age: H5N1 cases
occurred during 19 years from 1997 to 2015, yet
cases from all years exhibit similar dependence
on birth year. Analysis of 361 H5N1 cases in Egypt,
the one country with many cases across the past
decade, shows no trend in case birth years through
time, whereas case age increased steadily (P =
0.0003, Spearman’s correlation) (fig. S2). So, on
average, the same birth cohorts remained at high
risk of severe infection, even as members grew
10 years older.
The case data normalized to demographic age
distributions in affected countries are depicted
in Fig. 2, C and D. (If all birth cohorts had equal
risk of severe infection, case incidence would be
proportional to age distribution.) Bars above the
midline thus represent birth years showing ex-
cess risk; bars below indicate a shortfall. This
normalization highlights two points: (i) Excess
incidence and mortality data for H5N1 and H7N9
are near-mirror images of each other. (ii) The
group 1–to–group 2 HA transition in 1968 is the key
inflection point, with those born before the em-
ergence of H3N2 showing protection against sev-
ere cases of H5N1 but not H7N9 and those born
after 1968 showing the opposite pattern. For
H7N9, severe case incidence also spikes in birth
years around 1977 and 2009, when resurgent H1N1
circulation would have caused considerable mis-
matched imprinting. One-sided binomial exact
testsshowedthatexcessH5N1incidencehadalower
probability of occurring in cohorts born before
1968 (P < 1e−10), whereas excess H7N9 incidence
was more probable in these same cohorts (P < 1e−9).
The same pattern held for excess mortality (sup-
plementary text). These patterns suggest that
the immune system imprints on conserved HA
epitopes from the first-ever exposure to IAV,
which results in heterosubtypic (but within-
group) protection against severe infection.
Even more striking is the tight correspondence
of observed H5N1 and H7N9 incidence and mor-
tality with a priori predictions based on HA
imprinting patterns and demographic age dis-
tributions (Fig. 2). We emphasize that the black
lines in Fig. 2 are not fitted to the case data but

 are independent predictions [e.g., (Fig. 1C)]. Differ-
ences between the predictions and data are
remarkably small—some noise arises from gen-
eralization across time and countries (e.g., attack
rates for the reconstruction came from German
data, but focal populations are largely Asian) and
from small case numbers. Incorporating addi-
tional epidemiological factors and estimating the
protective efficacy of imprinting further improved
correspondence between predictions and data
(fig. S3). In contrast, NA imprinting patterns
(which fully capture patterns of childhood ex-
posure to N1) are a poor fit to H5N1 and H7N9
data from 1957–1968 cohorts (fig. S4), and NA-
mediated protection is not supported by statis-
tical modeling.
HA imprinting explains age distributions
To formally assess the HA imprinting hypothesis
alongside previous explanations (1, 3–7) for ob-
served H5N1 and H7N9 age distributions, we
developed a set of multinomial models. These
models related the probability that a case oc-
curred in a given birth cohort to country- and
year-specific demography; to risk factors includ-
ing age-based risk of exposure to poultry, age-
based risk of severe disease or case ascertainment;
and to reconstructed patterns of first exposure
(and, hence, potential immunological imprinting)
to HA or NA subtypes (table S1). Model compari-
son showed that HA imprinting was the domi-
nant explanatory factor for observed incidence
and mortality patterns for both H5N1 and H7N9
(Table 1). It was the only tested factor included in
all plausible models for both viruses (i.e., all mod-
els with Akaike weights greater than 4e−5).
The best models also included age-based risk
of severe disease, echoing patterns known from
seasonal influenza epidemiology. Age-based poul-
try exposure risk [estimated based on contact data
from China (6, 7)] was included for H7N9 but not
H5N1, which may reflect that age-specific poultry
exposures vary across the multiple countries
affected by H5N1 or that humans interact differ-
ently with ill (H5N1-infected) versus asymptomatic
(H7N9-infected) poultry. In models including HA
imprinting, NA imprinting never showed any
significant effect (table S2). Remarkably, despite
differences between the viruses and age cohorts
involved, the estimated protective effects of HA
imprinting were nearly identical for H7N9 and
H5N1. In all models, protective HA imprinting
reduced the risk of severe infection with H5N1
or H7N9 by ~75% and the risk of death by ~80%
(Table 1, figs. S5 to S7, and table S2).
Antigenic seniority across
influenza subtypes
Most individuals born before the emergence of
H3N2 in 1968 and exposed first to group 1 HA
antigens (Fig. 1) have also been exposed to H3N2
after 1968—probably multiple times. Yet these
seasonal group 2 exposures later in life evidently
fail to override group 1 HA imprinting from child-
hood (Fig. 2). The birth year–specific protection
seen for human H5N1 and H7N9 thus clearly in-
dicates that clinically relevant antigenic seniority—
preferential recall of immunological reactivities
to antigens encountered earlier in life upon later
exposure to cross-reactive antigens (16)—can act
across HA subtypes of the same HA group, not
only within subtypes as often assumed.
Although the precise mechanism underlying
antigenic seniority in this context remains to be
determined, antibodies directed against conserved
HA epitopes provide a plausible explanation for
protection at the level of HA groups. For example,
research following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic drew
attention to the fact that primary exposure to a

 novel IAV can preferentially boost broadly pro-
tective antibodies that bind conserved HA head or
stem epitopes shared by different HA subtypes
(8–14), even though immune memory against
more variable epitopes on the novel HA head
may be absent. This absence may in fact enable
robust expression of otherwise-subdominant,
broadly protective responses to conserved epitopes
such as those on the HA stem (8). In particular,
primary exposure to H5N1 or H7N9 can activate
HA stem–specific reactivities induced by previous
infection by H1 or H3, respectively (12, 13, 26).
Indeed, others have suggested that heterosub-
typic antibodies might attenuate disease from
other IAV strains and may be imprinted to some
degree by childhood exposure, although their
serological assays provided no ability to detect or
predict actual patterns of protection relevant to
H5N1 and H7N9 in human populations (27).
Given the immunodominant nature of HA
head reactivities (13, 14, 26, 28), conserved HA
head epitopes shared within, but not between,
HA groups (29) may play a role in these patterns
of protection. Cross-reactive HA-specific CD4+
or CD8+ T cell responses should also be investi-
gated, because they, too, are likely to be dispropor-
tionately shared within HA groups (given the
sequence similarities within each clade) and
might be especially capable of facilitating the sort
of long-term immunity indicated by the data.
Nevertheless, current data, including the high
degree of sequence conservation of stem domains
within each HA group (Fig. 1A and fig. S1), seem
most consistent with a stem-directed mechanism
for the antigenic seniority acting at the HA-group
level (13). Divergence in HA stem amino acid
sequences within each phylogenetic group is
comparable to divergence in HA head sequences
within a single HA subtype [i.e., the scale at which
antigenic seniority is already known to act (16)]
(fig. S1), but stem divergences between the two
HA groups are markedly higher. Notably, H3 and
H7 are as divergent as any pair of group 2 HAs;
because H3 childhood exposure provides protec-
tion against H7, it may thus protect as well or
better against the other group 2 HAs (H4, H10,
H14, and H15) but perhaps not at all against
more divergent group 1 HAs (fig. S1C). Similarly,
the joint consideration of protein sequence con-
servation patterns (Fig. 1A and fig. S1) along with
immunological and epidemiological data sug-
gests that H1 or H2 childhood exposure may
protect generally against zoonotic group 1 HAs
but not group 2 HAs.
The putative generality in HA imprinting pro-
tection patterns for novel HA subtypes other than
H5N1 or H7N9 is tentatively supported by the
preponderance of HA group–mismatched child-
hood exposures among the small number of clin-
ically significant human cases detected to date.
By pooling data from 28 human cases of H5N6,
H6N1, H7N7, H9N2, H10N7, and H10N8, we found
that age patterns are consistent with HA imprint-
ing (P = 0.019; see supplementary text), but case
numbers are insufficient to investigate particular
subtypes. Immunological experiments [e.g., using
chimeric HA proteins (12)] are needed to system-
atically map HA cross-protection patterns across all
HA subtypes, both within and between HA groups.
Rational projections of future
pandemic risk
For any new pandemic IAV strain capable of
efficient human-to-human transmission, HA im-
printing patterns would combine with age-based
mixing patterns (30–32) to determine the epide-
miological impacts of the first pandemic wave.
We created projections for a putative pandemic-
capable strain of subtype H5 or H7—such as a
gain-of-function strain or a natural variant with
mutations increasing human-to-human transmis-
sibility. The data on observed H7N9 and H5N1
cases enabled us to quantify how matched HA
imprinting reduces the probability of developing
a severe infection, but not how matched imprint-
ing affects an individual’s probability of acquir-
ing a milder infection or the infectivity of such
mild infections. People who become infected de-
spite prior immunity likely transmit influenza at
reduced rates owing to diminished viral titers
and viral shedding, as observed in humans and
in animal models (4, 12, 22–25). We thus as-
sumed, conservatively, that imprinting does not
change the probability of acquiring infection upon
exposure but can reduce severity and infectivity
in individuals with protective HA imprinting.
The projected age-structured attack rate of
severe cases for hypothetical pandemics of H5
or H7 IAV occurring in 2015 in the United King-
dom is illustrated in Fig. 3A. The projected risk
profiles for severe infection are shaped strongly
by HA imprinting, including the prediction that
individuals above 50 years of age (i.e., born well
before 1968 and first exposed to a group 1 HA)
would experience much lower morbidity than
younger age groups in an H5 pandemic. Similar
projections for China and Vietnam reveal the in-
fluence of demographic differences between
countries (fig. S8). The qualitative patterns in
projected age impacts are robust to a wide range
of assumptions about how seasonal influenza vac-
cination might affect imprinting (Fig. 3A) and to
the assumed infectivity of mild cases arising in in-
dividuals with protective HA imprinting (fig. S8A).
Projections for pandemics occurring a decade
from now highlight predictable shifts in severe
disease risk patterns as the imprinted population
ages, with the key pivot point around birth years
near 1968 shifted to older ages (fig. S8). Impacts
in the youngest age groups would depend on pat-
terns of IAV circulation in the coming decade. All
pandemic projections that account for HA im-
printing exhibit markedly lower severe attack
rates than projections assuming no imprinting
protection (Fig. 3A and fig. S8). Total attack rates
(including mild and subclinical cases) would be

 higher and more evenly distributed across age
groups than the severe attack rates shown here.
Over any prolonged period when IAV circu-
lation is dominated by one HA group, imprinting
generates growing herd immunity against zoo-
notic IAV strains from that group. Conversely,
zoonotic strains from the mismatched HA group
benefit from the rising proportion of humans
without protection. So long as mild cases arising
in people with group-matched imprinting con-
tribute any less to transmission than unprotected
cases, or if some fraction of infection events is
prevented by imprinting-derived immunity, im-
printing will alter the transmissibility of zoonotic
IAV strains in the human population. This is
summarized by the effective reproductive num-
ber, Reff, which quantifies transmission in a par-
tially immune population (Fig. 3B). Crucially, a
zoonotic strain that is initially subcritical (i.e.,
with Reff < 1 and therefore unable to spread sus-
tainably) could—solely because of susceptibility
changes in the human population—emerge as
supercritical and hence as a pandemic threat, if
the mismatched HA group dominates IAV cir-
culation for a sufficient period (Fig. 3B).
Our work implies that we have never seen a
true “virgin soil” influenza pandemic and that
all prior estimates of R0 for pandemic IAVs are
systematic underestimates because they do not
account for protection induced by HA imprint-
ing. Conversely, we see that imprinting raises
the threshold R0 necessary for a novel subtype
to invade. Note that the cocirculation of group
1 and 2 HAs since 1977 has balanced herd
immunity in a way that increases the inherent
transmissibility needed for a novel subtype
from either HA group to invade. As a generality,
Reff for zoonotic influenza strains will change
through time depending on seasonal influenza
patterns and demographic background, and
the magnitude of change will depend on the in-
fectivity of imprinting-protected cases (fig. S9).
Discussion
Our findings show that major patterns in zoo-
notic IAV epidemiology, previously attributed to
patient age, are in fact driven by birth year. IAV
strains circulating during an individual’s child-
hood confer long-term protection against novel
HA subtypes from the same phylogenetic group.
Hence, antigenic seniority extends across IAV
subtypes, introducing previously unrecognized
generational structure to influenza epidemiology.
These immune imprinting effects have impli-
cations for public health and highlight that in-
fluenza virulence represents a joint phenotype
between virus and host—even for strains not yet
adapted to the human population.
These findings support the hypothesis that the
unusually high mortality in young adults during
the 1918 H1N1 (group 1) pandemic may have
arisen primarily from mismatched H3 (group 2)
imprinting in the cohort born between ~1880
and 1900 (19). This same cohort was strongly af-
fected during the (group 1) 1957 pandemic (33),
yet they suffered no excess mortality when they
were even older, during the (group 2) 1968 pan-
demic (34). The possibility that mismatched HA
imprinting currently contributes to the greater
health impacts of seasonal H3N2 (relative to
H1N1) in today’s older age classes is worth in-
vestigating. And a diagnostic assay to determine
whether an individual was imprinted on a group
1 or group 2 HA may be useful for individualized
clinical care and vaccine design strategies, both
for pandemic and seasonal IAVs.
Our findings raise questions about whether
seasonal influenza vaccination might boost broad-
ly protective anti-HA responses (27) or alter im-
printing from natural infection in IAV-naïve
children. By exposing IAV-naïve children simul-
taneously to group 1 (H1N1) and group 2 (H3N2)
antigens, vaccination might confer dual imprint-
ing to both HA groups or prevent strong imprint-
ing against either HA group—or it could have no
effect beyond delaying the age of imprinting via
the first natural infection. Our sensitivity analy-
ses demonstrated that, given the low IAV vac-
cination coverage in H5N1- and H7N9-affected
countries, none of these effects would change our
study’s conclusions (fig. S7). However, to properly
inform early childhood vaccine policy, future re-
search must determine which, if any, of these ef-
fects occur.
HA group imprinting also might complicate
“universal” vaccination approaches targeting con-
served HA epitopes. Our findings indicate potent,
long-lasting cross-protection between subtypes,
putatively based on such responses. However,
universal vaccination may have to outperform
natural infection in its ability to induce broad
immunity in the face of previous imprinting. The
persistence of group 1 imprinting in older adults,
despite decades of natural exposure to H3N2 after
1968 (Fig. 2), as well as the relative weakness of
group 2 anti-HA stem reactivities in these older
cohorts (11), suggests that HA exposures later in life
do not readily alter broadly protective responses in
individuals already imprinted to a particular HA
group. To be effective, would bivalent (group
1 and group 2 HA stem) universal vaccines need
to be delivered to infants before natural IAV in-
fection? Or might universal vaccines even impair
natural, long-term protection of the sort we have
detected against H5N1 and H7N9 if received before
an individual’s first natural IAV infection?
Our findings are consistent with the known
potential for repeated infection by seasonal IAV
subtypes. Group-matched imprinting, like other
broadly protective IAV immune responses, is ex-
pected to protect against severe disease but not
necessarily against infection (8, 12, 14). This
parallels the reduced severity observed for re-
peat infections with seasonal strains (22, 23, 25).
Furthermore, reexposure to a seasonal subtype
typically elicits memory responses against the
immunodominant HA head, which mask sub-
dominant broadly protective responses involved
in group-level imprinting (26).
For any country with suitable contact and
demographic data, the methods shown here can
provide rolling estimates of which age groups
would be at highest risk for severe disease should
particular novel HA subtypes emerge. Such pro-
jections could guide cohort- or region-specific
prevention, preparation, or control. Quantitative
projections of changes in Reff—and hence pan-
demic risk—will require further research into the
protection arising from matched imprinting: Is
some fraction of cases prevented entirely, and by
what factor is infectivity reduced in mild cases
arising in protected individuals?
Our findings show that emergence risk cannot
be considered in isolation, even for “novel” path-
ogens that have not circulated in humans before.
These pathogens are commonly assumed to have
a blank slate of immunologically naïve humans to
infect, but cross-protection from related patho-
gens can generate substantial population immu-
nity. When this community of related pathogens
undergoes major shifts, as during influenza pan-
demics, the landscape of population immunity
changes accordingly. Thus, emergence of novel
pathogens can be governed by bottom-up con-
trol, with population immunity acting in an im-
portant and predictable manner to modulate the
widely recognized effects of virological and eco-
logical risk factors. This perspective opens new
frontiers for quantitative and mechanistic anal-
ysis of emergence risk.

Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine
light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers.We found that individual
atomic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well
below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the atomic scale.These
atomic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. Although unstable
at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single
atomic cavities to be probed for many minutes.Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such
extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 106 enhancement of optomechanical coupling
between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds.This work sets the basis
for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-molecule level.
C
oinage metal nanostructures support local-
ized surface plasmons, which confine optical
fields to much smaller than their wavelength
(1). This extreme enhancement enables vi-
brational spectroscopy within small vol-
umes, even down to single molecules (2, 3). For
many years, lateral resolution was believed to be
~10 nm (4); however, recent experiments have
resolved the atomic structure of single molecules
using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS)
(3) and have demonstrated direct sequencing of
RNA strands (5). Atomistic simulations also suggest
that plasmonic confinement to atomic scales is
possible (6).
Here, we show that light-activated mobiliza-
tion of surface atoms in a plasmonic hotspot trig-
gers the formation of additional “picocavities”
bounded by a single gold atom. Because of strong
optical field gradients that switch the Raman
selection rules, the ultrasmall localization of light
in these cavities alters the number and variety of
vibrational modes of trapped molecules observed.
The resulting cascaded ultrastrong plasmonic con-
finement pumps specific molecular bonds, thereby
creating nonthermal vibrational populations and
constituting an optomechanical resonator. Remark-
ably, cryogenic control of the plasmonic nanometric
cavity allows for systematic and stable monitoring
of picocavity formation and disassembly. We thus
demonstrate the possibility of resolving the dy-
namics of individual bonds within molecules. The
existence, monitoring, and selective control of these
picocavities will be important not only in photo-
chemistry and photophysics but also as a plat-
form for optomechanics, coherent control, and
quantum information devices.
To produce stable, robust picocavities, we
bypass complex scanning tip spectroscopies, in-
stead using straightforward self-assembly to cre-
ate “nanoparticle-on-mirror” (NPoM) geometries
(Fig. 1A). Individual gold nanoparticles are spaced
above a planar gold substrate by a nanometer-thick
self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of biphenyl-4-
thiol (Fig. 1B). Both the scattering and surface-
enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signals from
individual constructs are highly reproducible. All
measurements are recorded at cryogenic temper-
atures, using a modified dark-field microscope
and laser pumping at 633 nm (7). Low-temperature
time-series SERS spectra from a typical gold nano-
particle (Fig. 1C) show vibrational modes that can
be divided into two sets: A first set of vibrational
modes is ever-present with constant intensity (“per-
sistent lines”) while a second “blinking” set of
lines appears (arrows), disappears, and changes
intensity over time.
Comparing the observed spectra with density
functional theory (DFT) simulations confirms that
both types of lines originate from the biphenyl-4-
thiol SAM. However, in the blinking set, the relative
intensities are altered, and normally Raman-
inactive lines [infrared (IR) absorption lines] are
mixed into the SERS spectrum. Each realization
of this fluctuating state displays different lines for
each enhancement, indicating selective excitation
of specific vibrations (see fig. S13 for additional
spectra). By contrast, SERS intensities in the per-
sistent set are unaffected by the appearance of
blinking lines. As shown below, this suggests that
the blinking lines originate from a very small vol-
ume inside the plasmonic gap, containing only a
single molecule. Such tight localization yields ex-
tremely high field gradients, accounting for the
observation of Raman-inactive IR modes (8).
Additional evidence implies that these small
hotspots are actually sub-nm3 volumes that we
term “picocavities,” each consisting of only one
gold atom. Full electromagnetic simulations (Fig.
1, D and E) show that picocavities locally boost
the near-field intensity, leaving the rest of the
plasmonic hotspot unaffected. The high field in-
tensity within the extremely small (<1 nm3) local
hotspot (Fig. 1, D and E) markedly enhances the
SERS intensity of nearby molecules. We find
that picocavities are spontaneously formed and
destroyed under laser illumination but can be
stabilized.
Picocavities are atomic-scale subnanometer
structures forming an extreme class of optical lo-
calization that pushes electromagnetic coupling to
the limit. To exploit and monitor their optical ac-
tivity and to experimentally estimate the picocav-
ity localization volume Vloc, we explore how they
modify the Raman scattering when exciting a
molecular vibration. This process is greatly am-
plified by the extreme confinement of the incident
light in the plasmonic gap. As a result, the popula-
tion n of excited vibrational states (at frequencies
