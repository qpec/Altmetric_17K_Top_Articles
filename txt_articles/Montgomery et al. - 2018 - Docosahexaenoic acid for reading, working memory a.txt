Abstract
Background
Omega-3 fatty acids are central to brain-development of children. Evidence from clinical tri-
als and systematic reviews demonstrates the potential of long-chain Omega-3 supplemen-
tation for learning and behavior. However, findings are inconclusive and in need of robust
replication studies since such work is lacking.
Objectives
Replication of the 2012 DOLAB 1 study findings that a dietary supplementation with the
long-chain omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had beneficial effects on the reading,
working memory, and behavior of healthy schoolchildren.
Design
Parallel group, fixed-dose, randomized (minimization, 30% random element), double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial (RCT).
Setting
Mainstream primary schools (n = 84) from five counties in the UK in 2012–2015.
Participants
Healthy children aged 7–9 underperforming in reading (<20th centile). 1230 invited, 376 met
study criteria.
Intervention
600 mg/day DHA (from algal oil), placebo: taste/color matched corn/soybean oil; for 16
weeks.

 Main outcome measures
Age-standardized measures of reading, working memory, and behavior, parent-rated and
as secondary outcome teacher-rated.
Results
376 children were randomized. Reading, working memory, and behavior change scores
showed no consistent differences between intervention and placebo group. Some behav-
ioral subscales showed minor group differences.
Conclusions
This RCT did not replicate results of the earlier DOLAB 1 study on the effectiveness of nutri-
tional supplementation with DHA for learning and behavior. Possible reasons are discussed,
particularly regarding the replication of complex interventions.

Introduction
Some high-quality evidence demonstrates that increasing children’s dietary intake of the long-
chain omega-3 fatty acids may improve concentration, reduce disruptive behavior and leads to
better reading and spelling [1,2]. Biochemical and neuroscientific research has long demon-
strated the important role of longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids–docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)- for brain development [3,4].
Influential evidence for the potential benefits from DHA omega-3 supplementation in chil-
dren stems from the DOLAB (DHA Oxford Learning and Behavior) I study [5]. This random-
ized, controlled trial (RCT) found that a 16-week dietary intervention with 600mg/day of
algal-source DHA led to significant improvement over placebo for behavior and learning
among healthy but under-performing children, aged 7–9 years, from mainstream UK schools.
Prior to DOLAB I, most studies of omega-3 supplementation for learning and behavior had
involved child populations with specific developmental conditions such as attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [6,7], dyslexia and developmental coordination disorder
(DCD) [8]. Those studies were small and their generalizability was limited by differences
between the populations being studied, the treatment formulations that were used, and the
outcomes assessed [9]. By contrast the DOLAB I study provided the first good evidence for the
benefits of DHA omega-3 in a large sample of healthy pupils with particularly poor reading
but otherwise without any behavioral or learning diagnosis.
Since the publication of the original study and the observation of heterogeneous evidence
regarding learning and behaviour outcomes several trials have been published. Notably these
usually focus on population with diagnosed learning or behavioural problems. A recent sys-
tematic review of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for learning disorders
found insufficient evidence of benefits in children with ADHD [10]. Notably, this review also
pointed to the lack of comparable studies reporting reading as an outcome. Since then a few
smaller trials found no effects for ADHD [11] however positive effects on spelling [12] and

Competing interests: Funding for the trial was
provided by DSM Nutritional Products, who also
provided product and placebo. PM, JRB, AB, and
TFS declare that no other competing interests exist.
PM and AJR act as occasional paid consultants
(lectures and advisory work) for companies and
organizations involved in producing, selling, or
promoting foods or supplements containing
omega-3. None of these issues alter the authors’
adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing
data and materials.
 comprehensive assessments of reading ability in mainstream Scandinavian children [13,14]
have been found, while other trials obtained insufficient evidence in these domains [15]. How-
ever, these studies test combinations of PUFAs with e.g. iron, and often recruited very different
samples of school age children.
Three recent systematic reviews find small improvements in ADHD-type behavioral out-
comes [16–18]. At the same time two Cochrane reviews [10,19] and a recent review of reviews
[20] conclude that current evidence for a positive effect of polyunsaturated fatty acid supple-
mentation for ADHD is insufficient. Interestingly, Gillies et al. [19] comment on the contra-
dicting results to Bloch & Qawasmi [1],partly suggest that such results are due to differing
combinations of parent- and teacher-rated behavior and different sets of inclusion criteria.
Of the aforementioned reviews, two included the original DOLAB I study. Whilst Tan
et al.’s [10] inclusion criteria excluded DOLAB I, and Gillies et al. [19] was written prior to the
publication of the original trial paper. The DOLAB I study was part of meta-analyses in Haw-
key & Nigg [18] and notably in Cooper et al. [17]. For example, the latter study’s findings are
strongly influenced by the results from the DOLAB 1 study, with meta-regression weights
>40%.
The inconclusiveness of the current evidence on PUFA supplementation for learning and
behavior in young children, particularly due to the lack of comparable studies, and the poten-
tial impact of the original DOLAB I study in past systematic reviews, highlights the need for
the replication of the trial.
Importantly for the current state of evidence, Gillies et al. recommend that “future research
[should] address[. . .] current weaknesses in this area, which include small sample sizes, variability
of selection criteria, variability of the type and dosage of supplementation, short follow-up times
and other methodological weaknesses.” [19]. This recommendation relates to ADHD studies,
and should apply even more to studies in more general populations that are less common. The
DOLAB II trial was a well-designed and well-powered study, with the same selection criteria,
dosage and intervention period as the initial trial, thus providing the most rigorous direct test
of the original findings. To the authors’ knowledge it is the first trial to assess the effects of
DHA omega-3 on children’s learning and behavior in a replication RCT.
Objectives
To replicate the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-3
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the reading, working memory, and behavior of healthy
schoolchildren as originally found in the DHA-Oxford-Learning-and-Behaviour (DOLAB I)
study.
Methods
This was a parallel group, fixed-dose, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT).
The protocol for this trial and CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see
Protocol S1 File (and at https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.k8kczuw) and Checklist S2
File and the study was registered at www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN48803273).
Participants and setting
The study was open to healthy children attending mainstream UK primary schools in Oxford-
shire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes and Swindon who were aged 7–9
years.

 Inclusion.
Included children had to be below the 20th centile on a standardized word
reading test, “The British Ability Scales” (BAS II) [21] but with no other significant special edu-
cational needs.
However, during the first wave of recruitment it was found that due to recent changes in
the teaching of literacy, children’s ability to decode words had considerably improved. Conse-
quently this study used a recalibrated version of the BAS II (New BAS II) and for comparison
the new BAS 3 [22], to appropriately measure children’s reading ability. In order to meet the
planned sample size, it was decided to recruit children who fell below the 20th centile on either
the recalibrated new BAS II or the BAS 3 word reading tests and the protocol was modified
accordingly.
Exclusion.
Children with specific medical disorders (e.g. visual or hearing impairment),
or who were taking medications expected to affect behavior and learning, were excluded from
the study, as were those whose first language at home was not English. Schools were also asked
to exclude any children whose social/family circumstances would have made inclusion into
the study inappropriate (e.g. serious illness in the family). Children who, according to their
parents, ate oily fish twice or more a week or took omega-3 supplements were also excluded.
Local authorities in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire and the Unitary
Authorities in Swindon and Milton Keynes were partners in the research, providing information
on children’s performance on national attainment tests conducted at age 7 (Key Stage 1)–further
details on the recruitment can be found in the supporting information. (Recruitment S3 File)
Having been informed about inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, teachers at par-
ticipating primary schools and academies created lists of those children whose current reading
performance suggested they may benefit from inclusion to the study and on this basis, letters
of invitation were sent to parents (see Fig 1).
Ethics
Written informed consent was gained from parents, and verbal assent from the children, prior
to the initial screening assessments. Ethical consent was gained from the Oxford B NHS Ethics
Board, 15/10/2012, ref:12/SC/0465. Data was stored and processed anonymously.
Intervention
Active treatment consisted of a fixed dose of 600 mg DHA (from algal oil), delivered in three
500 mg capsules per day, each providing 200 mg DHA. The placebo treatment consisted of
three, taste- and color-matched 500 mg capsules per day containing corn/soybean oil. Both
treatments were provided by DSM Nutritional Products, for full details see Supporting Infor-
mation Capsule Content S4 File.
Schools were given a 16-week supply of capsules (labelled with each participating child’s
name) and asked to dispense 3 capsules daily at lunch time during school terms. Likewise,
parents were given a 16-week capsule supply for weekends, school holidays and at any other
time pupils were absent from school.
To ensure implementation fidelity schools and parents were given detailed instructions for
dispensing capsules. To increase compliance parents further received a sticker diary to record
capsule consumption. To log any health issues and/or problems with capsule consumption,
schools and parents received fortnightly phone calls during the course of the intervention,
which were also used to encourage continued compliance.
Due to issues with the colorant and key ingredient (non-vegetarian gelatine) of the capsule
shells these were changed in January 2014 and the protocol amended (for more information
see Protocol Amendment S5 File).

 Outcomes
Primary outcomes assessed at baseline and at 16-week follow-up were:
a) Reading.
Assessment through both the Word Reading Achievement sub-tests from the
British Ability Scales (New BAS II and BAS 3 [21,22]). These are a widely used age-standard-
ized, single word reading test, normed on UK children, and sensitive enough to show signifi-
cant change over four months. Standardized scores have a mean of 100 and a standard
deviation of 15, with higher scores indicating better reading.
b) Working memory.
Assessment via the recall of digits forward and recall of digits back-
ward sub-tests from the BAS II. Again, these measures are age standardized, but use T-scores,
with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, with higher scores indicating better working
memory.
c) Behavior.
Assessment by parents using the long version of the Conners’ Rating Scale
(CPRS-L) [23,24]. This is an age-standardized, highly valid and reliable instrument, measuring
child behavioral problems over several domains, expressed as T-scores (mean = 50, sd = 10).
Reductions in these scores represent an improvement of child behavior.
For many years these scales have been routinely used in medication trials for children with
behavior problems such as ADHD; they have also been successfully used in several previous
trials of fatty acid supplementation. The secondary outcome of behavior in school was mea-
sured with the teacher version of the Conners’ Rating Scale (CTRS-L)[25,26].
Other measures
i) Demographic information.
Information on eligibility for free school meals (FSM) was
gained from local authority data and used as a proxy for Social Economic Status (SES). Local
authority data were also used to report gender and age. Where such information was unavail-
able, parent reported data was used instead.
ii) Health information.
At baseline information was collected from parents/guardians on
each child’s current health status (including items from the side effects scale, see below). Infor-
mation was also collected on possible diagnoses of ADHD and Dyslexia. Height and weight
were assessed by the researchers at each child’s baseline assessment and BMI percentiles were
calculated using Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines [27].
iii) Medication.
Medication information along with supplement use and fish consump-
tion were collected from parents using a checklist. This latter information was used to confirm
eligibility for the study.
iv) Compliance.
Compliance was assessed by counting the capsules returned and by way
of analyses of fingerstick blood tests pre- and post-intervention (for technical details see Sup-
porting Information Blood fatty acid data S6 File). Schools and parents were also provided
with a ‘calendar’ and stickers to encourage children’s compliance and to help keep track of
each day’s capsule consumption. Fortnightly health-check calls also provided an opportunity
for researchers to encourage compliance.
v) Side effects.
Side effects were recorded using the Barkley Side Effects Rating Scale
(SERS) [28], a commonly-used instrument assessing the frequency and severity of 17 common
side effects which may occur as the result of taking medication or supplements. Each symptom
is rated on a 10-point scale from absent to severe.
vi) Attendance.
Parental consent was gained for schools to disclose each child’s atten-
dance at school during the 16-week intervention, and this was recorded and collected at post-
Fig 1. Flow of participants from invitation to randomization (CONSORT flowchart).

 intervention measuring each half day’s absenteeism due to illness. Parents were also asked to
report the number of days off school due to ill-health in the past school term at baseline and
during the course of the intervention at the end of the study.
Description of procedures
Baseline.
Baseline assessments took place in schools during normal school hours in a
quiet room by two trained researchers. Each child was assessed individually on reading. Only
those children who met our inclusion criteria (< 20th centile on the New BAS II or BAS 3),
were included into the study and assessed on their working memory. Behavior questionnaires
were sent out to parents with our letter of invitation whilst teachers of all those included in the
study were given these questionnaires at the end of this assessment.
Post-intervention.
Children were re-assessed at school 16 weeks post-intervention, when
all primary outcome measures were repeated. On completion of the study, all participants
were given a three months’ supply of the active supplement, as well as a £5 gift token.
Sample size
Power calculations were based on change scores of reading ability from DOLAB I. In children
with initial reading performance below the 20th percentile these were mean = 2.0 (SD 4.2)
for the active group and mean = 0.9 (SD 3.9) for the placebo group, giving an effectsize of
d = 0.28. Sample sizes were calculated with GPOWER, v3.15 [29] for a t-test. These indicated
that approximately 200 participants per group would provide 80% power with an α of 5%.
Randomization
A statistician at Sealed Envelope Ltd. independently performed the randomization with mini-
mization via a 1:1 allocation ratio. The program’s minimization algorithm ensured balanced
allocation of participants between the treatment groups for each school (to allow for any socio-
demographic/school differences) and sex of the child (a potentially important factor [30]) but
also included a 30% random allocation element. It was performed after eligibility was assured
and was independently concealed until after the initial two-group analyses were complete. All
processes are in line with CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration procedures [31] (For
technical specifications see Supporting Information–Randomisation S7 File).
Blinding
Investigators, participants and those assessing outcomes were all blind to treatment allocation.
Post-intervention, both teachers and parents of participants were asked whether they thought
their child had been allocated to Active treatment or Placebo, and these estimates were used to
assess the maintenance of blinding.
Imputation
Item-missing values in the Conner’s Rating Scales were imputed using treatment group
median values, which provide some robustness against outliers, whilst not relying on an uncer-
tain MAR assumption needed for multiple imputations. Observations lost to follow-up were
also imputed using treatment group median values. Appropriate checks were made that partic-
ipants with missing data did not differ significantly on any demographic variables. The meth-
ods replicated those used in DOLAB 1.

 Statistical methods
The assessment of blinding (i.e. treatment group guess) was examined using χ2–test by treat-
ment group, whilst differences in side-effects scores were tested using Wilcoxon-rank sum
tests.
Group comparisons on primary outcomes were carried out using change scores (i.e. the
post-intervention score minus baseline score), in line with previous studies including DOLAB
I. Main analyses were conducted using t-tests for mean differences of changes (in line with the
original study) on an intention-to-treat principle (ITT): thus, all children were included
according to treatment allocation, irrespective of continued participation in the trial after
randomization.
For all primary outcomes, pre-planned group comparisons were carried out on the whole
sample of children who were recruited into the study. Subgroup comparisons were also carried
out on those children whose baseline reading scores were �10th centile (to evaluate any possi-
ble trends related to the severity of initial reading problems).
To assess potential biases due to missingness additional per-protocol analyses were con-
ducted on any measure with >15% missing values. Furthermore, post-hoc multivariate (OLS)
regressions were undertaken to assess whether the statistically inefficient use of change-scores
(in line with original paper) might affected the results. A second set of models further
accounted for the minimization factors (school and gender) and assessed the consistency of
the results based on the group comparisons (for details see Supporting Information–Multi-
variate Analyses S1 Table). These robustness checks are briefly discussed.
All analyses were undertaken using Stata 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station TX). Analysis
syntax and an anonymised dataset are available for replication through the Open Science
Framework: https://osf.io/9ynjf.
Results
Recruitment
Recruitment was carried out in 84 primary schools and academies in five local and unitary
authorities proximate to Oxfordshire, beginning in January 2013 and finishing in March 2015.
Post-intervention assessments (16 weeks after enrolment) were completed in July 2015. Of the
1230 children who were invited, 618 of their parents/guardians gave consent and their children
were assessed. Of these, 376 met study inclusion criteria and were randomized. The most com-
mon reason for exclusion was that their reading exceeded the 20thcentile (n = 231); other rea-
sons for exclusion are described in the flowchart of participants (n = 11) detailed in Fig 1. The
achieved sample size is 24 short of the planned N reflecting resource constraints.
Follow-up.
Of the 376 children randomized, 372 were assessed again after the 16-week
intervention (185 Active, 187 Placebo). Lost participants were equally balanced between
groups.
Baseline data. The two treatment groups did not differ on any of the core demographic
variables, nor on any of the primary outcome measures at baseline with the exception of work-
ing memory (Digits Forward). Demographic information is provided in Table 1. The mean
age of the sample was 8 years 7 months, 62.5% were male, 84% white, and around 20% were
eligible for free school meals. Baseline data on the primary outcomes are shown in Table 2.
With respect to these, mean reading performance of the children randomized was 1.3 sd (20.4
points) below the normative value (score = 100), equating to a reading performance around 27
months below chronological age. Working memory scores were around 0.8 sd (8 points, digits
forward) and 0.7 sd (7 points, digits backward) below population norms (score = 50). On the

 behavior measures, both teacher and parent ratings were all within the normative range, with
the exception of the ‘cognitive problems’ sub-scale (assessing attentional and related difficul-
ties), where these children scored 1 (parent rated, approx. 10 points) to 1.5 (teacher rated,
approx. 15 points) sd above population means, as well as parent rated DSM-IV Inattentive,
+1.2sd. All other behavioral measures were slightly elevated (> +0.5 sd), with the exception
of ‘perfectionism’ (parent rated) and ‘oppositional’, ‘global emotional lability’, as well as
‘DSM-IV Hyperactive Impulsive’.
Did blinding work?.
Parent and teacher estimates of group allocation at post-intervention
were used to assess the maintenance of blinding. Group comparisons carried out on these esti-
mates showed there were no significant differences between groups (parents’ estimate: chi2
(df) = 1.327(2); teachers’ estimate: chi2(df) = 0.818(2), as shown in Table 3.
Numbers analysed.
Intention-to-treat analyses were carried out on the whole sample ran-
domized (n = 376). Analyses were also carried out on the pre-planned sub-group defined by
baseline reading of below the 10th centile (n = 213) in line with the protocol. Behavior ratings
were the only measures with >15% of the data missing (change scores n = 196 for teachers
(52%), and n = 187 for parents (50%)), so additional per-protocol analyses were conducted on
these measures.
Outcomes
a) Reading.
Standardized reading score data are shown in Table 4, and changes on this
measure, which were the primary outcome, are illustrated in Fig 2. The same data expressed as
‘reading ages’ are shown in Table 5.
After the 16-week treatment period no statistically significant differences were found
between treatment groups post-intervention.
The whole group randomized (n = 376), showed no statistically significant reading gain dif-
ferences by treatment group above those that would be expected over this time period (Active
change(sd) = 0.64(3.7); placebo change(sd) 0.83(3.6), p(t) = 0.616(-0.502). This is further illus-
trated by the fact that children’s reading age increased by 3.1 months (active) and 3.7 months
(placebo) respectively over the 4 months of the intervention (Table 5).

 The same result was obtained for the pre-planned sub-group whose baseline reading was at
or below the 10th centile (n = 213). In this subgroup, no statistically significant group differ-
ences in change-scores were observed (Active change(sd) = 1.4(3.6); Placebo change(sd) = 1.4
(3.7); p(t) = 0.938(-0.078)).
Finally, Table 6 reports the group mean differences and 95% confidence intervals, in the
main sample the differences is -0.594 (95% CI: -1.937, 0.749) in the subgroup -0.576 (-2.019,
0.867) points on the BASII reading scores. This further shows that the treatment group differ-
ences are not substantially meaningful.
b) Working memory.
At baseline (Table 7), digits forward scores differed statistically sig-
nificantly between the treatment groups in both the whole sample and the subgroup of chil-
dren in the <10-centile of the (normative BAS) reading distribution. At post-intervention,
group means differed significantly for digits forward (Whole sample: active mean(sd) = 43.8,
(9.1), placebo mean(sd) = 42.0(9.3), p(t) = 0.059(1.982); 10th centile subgroup: Active mean
(sd) = 43.7(8.1), placebo mean (sd) = 41.9(9.0), p(t) = 0.047(1.994)). In line with these differ-
ences the change scores are both small and not statistically significant for digits forward (active
change(sd) = 0.91, (7.7), placebo change(sd) = 1.72(7.9), p(t) = 0.826(-0.22)). Table 8 reports
the group mean differences and 95% confidence intervals, in the main sample the differences
is -1.797 (95% CI: -3.665, 0.071) in the subgroup -0.576 (95% CI; -5.304, -0.031) points, neither
is close to the 10-point, one standard deviation measure indicating a clinically relevant
difference.
Digits Backwards (Table 9) only differed statistically significantly at post-intervention
(Whole sample: Active mean(sd) = 43.7(8.1), placebo mean(sd) = 41.9(9.0), p(t) = 0.044
(2.018); and for the 10% Subgroup: Active mean(sd) = 43.5(9.3), placebo mean(sd) = 40.5(9.5),
p(t) = 0.018(2.38)). Again, we find the change scores for digits backwards (active change(sd) =
-0.4, (9.8), placebo change(sd) = -0.4(9.8), p(t) = 0.356(0.925)), do not differ in a statistically
significant way.

 The group mean differences (Table 8) for digits backwards are, in the main sample -1.774
(95% CI: -3.503, -0.045) and in the subgroup -3.061 (95% CI; -5.597–0.526) points.
c) Behavior.
Across both treatment groups, behavior ratings from parents showed small
changes (ranging from -1 to -3.8 points) over the 16-week treatment period, as shown in
Table 10 (ITT) and Table 11 (per-protocol). These reductions of behavioral problems at post-
intervention occur across both treatment groups, and no statistically significant group differ-
ences are found. Table 12 further highlights this point due to the small group mean differences
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals including zero.
1) Parent-ratings:
The ITT analyses showed a significant difference in favor of the Placebo group change scores
for the Anxiety sub-scale (Active mean(sd) = -1.0(7.9), Placebo mean(sd) = -3.8(9.6), p(t)<
0.01(3.123)) and for the Global change scores for Emotional Lability (Active mean(sd) = 0.9
(9.6), Placebo mean(sd) = -2.8(9.8), p(t)<0.05(2.357) and DSM IV Inattention (Active mean
(sd) = -1.0(8.9), Placebo mean(sd) = -3.2(10.2), p(t)<0.02(2.417).

 In the per-protocol analyses (n = 187–8), no group differences were significant with the
exception of a trend in favor of the Placebo group on the Anxiety sub-scale (Active mean(sd) =
-0.8(7.3), Placebo mean(sd) = -4.1(9.3), p(t)<0.007(2.717)).
2) Teacher-ratings:
The ITT analyses (Table 13) showed that behavioral improvements (that is lower scores) as
rated by teachers were greater for the Placebo group over Active treatment on the Anxiety sub-
scale (Active mean = -0.5(10.8), Placebo mean(sd) = -3.7(11.0); p(t)<0.01(2.847)).
However, these were not consistent across sub- and global scales and the per-protocol anal-
yses (n = 196, Table 14), no significant effects of treatment were found. Table 15 further high-
lights this point due to the small group mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals including zero.
One systematic finding was the consistent reduction in the teacher ratings across both treat-
ment groups.
Multivariate robustness checks
The above results were check for robustness given the statistically inefficient use of change-
scores as well as for the influence of the minimization factors gender and school. Multivariate
(OLS) regressions resulted in the same overall conclusions and are reported in Supporting
Materials—Multivariate Analyses S1 Table.
Other measures
Adverse events. The DHA supplement provided is generally regarded as safe (G.R.A.S.)
[32] and so no stopping guidelines were put in place except in the case of severe adverse events.
As expected, there were none in the course of this trial. The parents of one child in each group
reported episodes of diarrhoea and one child in the placebo group was diagnosed with Asper-
ger’s and prescribed Ritalin during the course of the intervention. In addition, one school
reported a negative behavior change in 9 children (4 in the Active and 5 in the Placebo group)
and another school reported the onset of severe nose bleeds in a child in the Active group.

 Health information and attendance.
No group differences were found post-intervention
either on child’s health status reported in the health questionnaire. No differences were found
in school-reported “half-day absences for illness” between groups at post-intervention assess-
ment. Those in the active group (n = 169) reported 4.9 (sd = 5.3) half day’s absence as com-
pared to those in the placebo group (n = 170) who had 5.4 (sd = 6.2) half day’s absence,
p = 0.63 (Wilcoxon-z = -0.31).
Reported side effects. No group differences were found for potential side effects assessed
by the Barkley scale (Table 16 and Table 17).
Compliance.
Counts of capsules returned by schools indicated mean compliance of
approximately 75% and this did not significantly differ between Active (capsules were returned
from n = 108 participants) and Placebo groups (capsules were returned from n = 104 partici-
pants). From 200 capsules allocated to schools for each child, quantities returned were: Active
mean(sd) = 42.5(43.8) and Placebo mean(sd) = 48.9(48.8) (p(t)<0.317(-1.1)). Of the 142 cap-
sules allocated to parents for non-school days, more than 50% of data were missing and so
these are not reported.
Objective data from fingerstick tests show that children in the active group had DHA levels
of 2.9% (n = 140) compared to 1.5% in the placebo group (n = 129) (p(z)<0.001(11.3)) at post-
intervention. Change scores indicate the active group increase their blood DHA from 1.6% to
2.9%, while the placebo group showed no such changes (p<0.001(10.54)). The baseline and
post-intervention distribution of blood DHA levels by treatment group are illustrated in Fig 3.
below.
Discussion
With this randomized, control trial, we made every attempt to rigorously replicate our previ-
ous findings of an improvement in reading and behavior following a dietary supplementation
with the omega-3 fatty acid DHA amongst school children aged 7–9 whose reading was ini-
tially below the 20th-centile of pupils. In line with the original DOLAB I study, our primary
outcomes were changes in reading, working memory and behavior (ADHD-type symptoms,
parent-rated). In summary, this study did not replicate the original findings of significant,

DOLAB II: A replication RCT of omega-3 DHA for learning and behavior

 positive effects of omega-3 DHA on either learning or behavior. No systematic adverse effects
from the supplementation were observed. As such the study does not provide supporting evi-
dence for the benefits of this safe nutritional intervention.
Why did the DOLAB studies not replicate?
The results of the DOLAB II replication RCT and DOLAB I are clearly at odds. It is not
entirely surprising that this study did not replicate the earlier one as has been found in many
trials recently [33,34]. A number of substantive and necessary differences between the initial
and the replication study might have contributed to these findings, despite the similar design
of the two studies a combination of recruitment, measurement and uptake differences will
have introduced considerable between-study heterogeneity.
First, the UK national curriculum relating to reading was changed in 2011 with a re-intro-
duction of the phonic teaching approach. To address this change, a recalibrated version of the
BAS II reading measure was used, which may, perhaps, have been less sensitive to detecting
reading changes than its uncalibrated version.
Second, whilst the trial design of the DOLAB II replication RCT was identical to the initial
study, we focused from the onset on the poorest reader amongst the pupils. Arguably this
should have provided a higher power for detecting statistically significant intervention effects.
However, the more restrictive inclusion criteria made recruitment more difficult. Compared
to DOLAB I, pupils were recruited from five counties rather than one and the recruitment
period was extended to 29 instead of 23 months. The larger recruitment area prevented the
research team from repeated follow-up data collection visits, and consequently was identified
as one source of the substantive missing teacher- and parent- self-report data.
Third, an additional recruitment challenge arose from the change of local authority run pri-
mary schools to self-governing academies, which had to be individually approached to gain
school consent.

DOLAB II: A replication RCT of omega-3 DHA for learning and behavior

 of this study would be 0.08 (8%), correspondingly to achieve 80% power given this effect size a
sample of more than 11500 participants would have been necessary.
Finally, there appears to have been a lower omega 3 DHA uptake than in the previous trial,
with DHA levels post-intervention being 2.9% as opposed to 3.8% in DOLAB I. However,
changes in blood DHA levels bear no clear relationship in changes with primary outcomes
when considering those with higher increases in DHA levels compared with those with lower
increases or no changes (see Supporting Information S8 File).
Contrasting with common challenges to replication
This study is a good example of the replication problems outlined in the literature [33], we will
discuss key issues following from John Ioannidis seminal paper. Protocol power calculations
indicated a sample size of n = 400 would be required and in the event n = 376 participants
were recruited. Our achieved power calculations underscoring this point even further. Several
potential sources of bias may have affected the results, however our preregistered protocol
(Protocol S1 File) and CONSORT-compliant (Checklist S2 File) reporting attends to most of
these and provides transparency through the study. For example, clear hypotheses and a prese-
lected (and reported) outcomes are provided therein. Both implementers and assessors were
blinded to treatment group. Further, data and analysis syntax (Stata dofile) are available with-
out restriction through the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/9ynjf.
For additional analyses. Systematic reviews and other studies of this question provide incon-
sistent results, as they include heterogeneous groups of participants, interventions, compara-
tors and outcomes [10,11,16–20]. Furthermore, there are implementation differences in dose,
delivery, uptake and context both generally [35], specifically to this field [36], and with regard
to this trial as discussed (see above). Consequently, the ratio of true to no relationships in the
area of fatty-acid supplementation is problematic, and this is partly due to the large number of
small studies finding small effects which are known to provide a poor basis for replication.
This is arguably a complex intervention to evaluate [37], with multiple modes of delivery and

 outcome (child, parent, school), long causal pathway (bio-psycho-social mechanism for a
behavioral change), where proximal (16-week) outcomes may not indicate distal change. This
study was conducted without direct influence of its funder by way of a robust contract, there
may remain researcher biases (self-serving, consistency and allegiance [38]) but again, trans-
parent reporting guidelines aim to address these matters.
Finally, the reporting of these null-results illustrates our commitment to avoid publication
biases, and our conviction that these add to the knowledge base on nutritional interventions.
At a minimum, these studies contribute to the increased power of systematic reviews and
meta-analyses.
Implications for research and practice
This study serves as an example for the need for robust, comparable trials for replication. Stan-
dardization of populations, interventions in terms of dose, composition and delivery would
help evaluate the evidence base for this safe intervention. Currently trials use a range of place-
bos making comparisons difficult and result in mixed and vague outcomes. This poses a partic-
ular challenge to systematic reviews and meta-analysis trying to establish the best available
evidence. The development of a core outcome set for similar trials on nutrition, learning, and
behavior would be helpful [39]. Secular changes, such as reading curricula updates, may make
replication challenging. And thus, even if the design and setting of studies are comparable
non-replication will occur as this study demonstrated.
