Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the loss and dys-
function of neurons in motor pathways and leads to severe weak-
ness, stiffness, and ultimately death in 3–5 years. Approximately 
15%–20% of ALS can be associated with a genetic cause. Among 
the genetically defined ALS cases, about 20% are associated with 
mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Although 
the exact toxicity of SOD1 mutations remains incompletely under-
stood, there is a consensus that there is a toxic gain of function, and 
some key data support this idea. First, overexpression of mutant 
SOD1 in mice or rats recapitulates important aspects of human 
ALS, including loss of neuromuscular junction innervation and 
motor neuron death (1, 2). Second, loss of SOD1, while resulting 
in eventual motor neuron dysfunction, does not result in motor 
 
neuron death (3, 4). Third, in humans, individual disease muta-
tions are associated with varying levels of SOD1 activity, yet there 
is no correlation between disease severity and SOD1 activity (5–7). 
Given the toxic gain-of-function role of SOD1, lowering levels of 
SOD1 is predicted to be therapeutic.
One method of lowering SOD1 is to target the SOD1 mRNA 
using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that bind to the SOD1 
mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing. The ASO activates RNase 
H1 that destroys the targeted RNA. Direct delivery of ASOs 
to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) affords widespread distribu-
tion of ASOs throughout the brain and spinal cord in rodents 
and nonhuman primates (8–13). ASOs for CNS disorders have 
advanced to clinical trial for Huntington’s disease (registered 
 
at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02519036), SOD1-associated ALS 
(NCT02623699), and Alzheimer’s disease (NCT03186989). 
Most impressively, a splicing-modifying ASO has recently been 
approved by the FDA (14) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (15).
An SOD1 ASO was used both in the first demonstration of the 
utility of ASOs in animal models of CNS disease (8, 16) and the first 
human clinical trial (9). Although there was tremendous enthusiasm 
for the early SOD1 ASO (ASO 333611), effects in the animal models 
were modest and advances in ASO technology identified other, more 
effective ASO designs for CNS disease, such that it became likely 
that a more potent ASO could be developed. We describe here the 
recent development of more potent ASOs with substantial prolon-
gation of survival in SOD1 rodent models. The increased efficacy of 
these ASOs allowed us to test how changes in disease markers may be 
 
halted or reversed in those models, a key question for application 
 
of this therapy in human clinical trials. Suppression of SOD1 after 
 
disease onset reversed the disease course, indicating that inter-
vention in symptomatic patients may not only halt disease but 
also reverse some aspects of it. The work described here provided 
the foundation for advancement of this compound to the ongoing 
human clinical trial in SOD1 ALS patients (NCT02623699).
Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are responsible for 20% of familial ALS. Given the gain of toxic function in this 
dominantly inherited disease, lowering SOD1 mRNA and protein is predicted to provide therapeutic benefit. An early generation 
antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting SOD1 was identified and tested in a phase I human clinical trial, based on modest 
protection in animal models of SOD1 ALS. Although the clinical trial provided encouraging safety data, the drug was not 
advanced because there was progress in designing other, more potent ASOs for CNS application. We have developed next-
generation SOD1 ASOs that more potently reduce SOD1 mRNA and protein and extend survival by more than 50 days in SOD1G93A 
rats and by almost 40 days in SOD1G93A mice. We demonstrated that the initial loss of compound muscle action potential in 
SOD1G93A mice is reversed after a single dose of SOD1 ASO. Furthermore, increases in serum phospho-neurofilament heavy chain 
levels, a promising biomarker for ALS, are stopped by SOD1 ASO therapy. These results define a highly potent, new SOD1 ASO 
ready for human clinical trial and suggest that at least some components of muscle response can be reversed by therapy.

human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), these new ASOs (ASO 
1 and ASO 2) potently lowered SOD1 mRNA in a dose-dependent 
manner (Figure 1B). The new ASOs were more efficacious than the 
previous SOD1 ASO, 333611 (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure

Results
Next-generation SOD1 ASOs more potently reduce mRNA and pro-
tein in rodent models compared with previous ASOs. Based on an in 
vitro screen of over 2,000 ASOs targeting the human SOD1 gene 
and subsequent optimization, 2 particularly potent ASOs target-
ing the 3′ UTR were selected for further testing (Figure 1A). In a 
Figure 1. New SOD1 ASOs reduce mRNA and protein in vitro and in vivo, and are more potent than the previous SOD1 lead. (A) Oligonucleotides containing 
phosphorothioate backbone modifications (unmodified phosphodiester linkages noted with red o) and 2′-O-methoxyethylribose (MOE; orange) and (S)-2′,4′-
constrained 2′-O-ethyl (cEt; blue) groups in the 5′ and 3′ wings were targeted to the 3′ UTR of SOD1 mRNA (ASO 1 and ASO 2), exon 1 of SOD1 mRNA (333611), or 
nothing in the human or rodent genome (inactive ASO). The sequences evaluated and location of chemical modifications are provided. (B) SHSY5Y cells were 
treated with SOD1 ASOs by electroporation. After 24 hours, SOD1 mRNA was measured. New SOD1 ASOs are more potent than the previous lead ASO (n = 2 per 
concentration, average ± range). (C and D) Candidate ASOs for human SOD1 were screened in mice (C) and rats (D) expressing human SOD1. ASOs were injected 
i.c.v. (mice) and intrathecally (rats) and mRNA was measured in lumbar spinal cord 2 weeks after dosing. Potent ASOs were identified that lowered SOD1 mRNA 
in both species with ED50 between 50 μg and 70 μg (n = 3 per dose, individual animals). (E) Tissue concentrations of ASO were measured and correlated with 
SOD1 mRNA lowering, demonstrating an EC50 of 0.9 μg/g in mice and 1.4 μg/g in rats (n = 24). (F) A single intrathecal bolus of 500 μg ASO 1 or ASO 2 was given to 
SOD1G93A rats. SOD1 mRNA levels were assessed in the spinal cord at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after bolus. ASO 1 and ASO 2 suppressed SOD1 mRNA levels for more 
than 8 weeks (n = 2–7 per time point, average ± SEM). (G) A single intraventricular bolus of ASO 1 or ASO 2 was given to SOD1G93A rats. Misfolded SOD1 protein from 
spinal cord was assessed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after bolus (n = 7 per time point, average ± SEM). (H) Six weeks after a single intraventricular bolus of ASO 1, SOD1 
protein was quantified in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1G93A rats. *** P = 0.0005.

mutant SOD1 in SOD1G93A rodent models is known to cause severe 
atrophy of the limbs and trunk that leads to loss of motor function 
and eventually death (17). To investigate whether a SOD1-lowering 
ASO strategy could delay disease parameters, SOD1G93A mice were 
injected intraventricularly with bolus doses of 300 μg ASO 1 at 
50 and 94 days of age. Weight and performance on rotarod were 
tested weekly. Mice that received ASO 1 maintained weight 26 days 
longer and performed better on rotarod than mice injected with a 
control inactive ASO (inactive ASO) at similar concentrations (Fig-
ure 2, A and B). Median survival for ASO 1–treated mice was 37 days 
longer compared with inactive ASO, representing a 22% extension 
of survival in the mouse model (Figure 2C).
SOD1G93A transgenic rats were injected intrathecally with a 
single bolus dose of artificial CSF (aCSF) or 1,000 μg ASO vehi-
cle, ASO 333611, ASO 1, ASO 2, or inactive ASO. ASO 333611 is 
the previous SOD1 ASO as described in reference 8 and used in 
a phase I study in SOD1 ALS participants (9). Rats assigned to 
the lead ASO treatment groups performed better in all catego-
ries when compared with the vehicle treatment group. SOD1G93A 
rats treated with ASO 1 or ASO 2 maintained weight 70 days 
 
(P < 0.0001) and 67 days (P < 0.001) longer, respectively, than rats 
treated with aCSF (Figure 2D). In contrast, the intrathecal bolus 
of ASO 333611 or inactive ASO did not significantly delay onset 
compounds in vivo, ASOs were delivered to the CSF of mice and 
rats expressing human SOD1G93A via intraventricular (mice) or 
intrathecal (rats) bolus injection. CSF administration distributes 
ASOs throughout the brain and spinal cord (8–13). Human SOD1 
mRNA was reduced in spinal cords of SOD1G93A mice in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 1C) with approximately 75% maximum 
reduction of SOD1 following a single injection of ASO 1 or ASO 2. 
Again, ASO 1 and ASO 2 were substantially more active and effi-
cacious than the previous ASO 333611. Similar dose-dependent 
reductions in human SOD1 mRNA were achieved in SOD1G93A rats 
(Figure 1D), with ASO 1 and ASO 2 exhibiting greater activity than 
333611 (Figure 1D). Potency of the lead ASO 1 was indistinguish-
able in SOD1G93A mice and rats, with a lumbar cord EC50 of 0.9 μg/g 
and 1.4 μg/g tissue, respectively (Figure 1E). ASO 1 and ASO 2 also 
exhibit prolonged duration of action, with nearly 10 weeks of sus-
tained SOD1 mRNA lowering following a single intrathecal bolus 
injection in SOD1G93A rats (Figure 1F). Similarly, misfolded SOD1 
also exhibits sustained reduction after a single bolus injection (Fig-
ure 1G). Consistent with our previous findings, native SOD1 mRNA 
(Supplemental Figure 1B) and protein (Figure 1H) are also reduced 
in spinal cord tissue following ASO treatment.
Treatment with SOD1-lowering ASO significantly delays disease 
onset and extends survival in SOD1G93A mice and rats. Expression of 
Figure 2. SOD1 ASOs prolong onset, survival, and motor performance of SOD1G93A mutant animals. (A–C) Mice were dosed i.c.v. twice, at day 50 and again 
at day 94, each time with 300 μg ASO 1 (n = 20 per treatment group, all females). (A) Onset of disease was scored as percentage of animals losing 10% of 
peak body weight. Median onset for mice treated with the control ASO was 140 days, whereas treatment with ASO 1 increased median onset to 183 days  
(P < 0.0001, log-rank Mantel-Cox). (B) Motor performance was tested through the rotarod test: mice were tested once a week starting at 80 days of age 
until they could not stay on the rod for at least 30 seconds. ASO 1 treatment significantly increased rotarod performance: in the control group, the median 
age at which 50% decrease in performance was reached was 147 days, whereas in the ASO 1–treated animals, the median increased significantly to 182 
days (P < 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA). (C) The median survival of mice treated with the control ASO was 168 days, whereas the treatment with ASO 1 increased 
median survival to 205 days (P < 0.0001, log-rank Mantel-Cox). (D and E) Rats were injected intrathecally with a 1,000 μg single bolus dose of inactive con-
trol ASO (n = 16), aCSF vehicle control (n = 19), ASO 333611 (n = 17), ASO 1 (n = 19), or ASO 2 (n = 18). (D) Rats treated with ASO 1 or ASO 2 maintained weight 
70 days (P < 0.0001) and 67 days (P < 0.001) longer, respectively, than rats treated with aCSF. 333611 delayed onset of weight loss modestly (median 139 
days, compared with aCSF median 121 days). (E) Survival was markedly prolonged in the ASO 1 and ASO 2 treatment groups by 53 days (P < 0.0001) and 64 
days (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared with aCSF control treatment in which rats survived to a median age of 166 days. This represents a 32% (ASO 1) 
and 39% (ASO 2) extension of survival. P values were determined by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

of phospho-neurofilament in SOD1G93A mice. To test whether SOD1 
reduction by ASO could affect markers of disease, SOD1G93A 
mice were injected intraventricularly once at 5 weeks of age with 
100 μg ASO 1 and evaluated for changes in compound muscle 
action potential (CMAP), neuromuscular junction innervation, 
and serum phospho-neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH) levels. 
In SOD1G93A mice, CMAP declines over time, preceding the loss 
of motor neurons (18, 19). SOD1G93A mice treated with ASO 1 at 
5 weeks maintained CMAP over the next 12 weeks, whereas the 
control-treated animals’ CMAP was reduced by more than half 
over the same time period (Figure 3A). Consistent with CMAP 
electrophysiological demonstration of preserved muscle func-
tion, ASO 1–treated mice maintained innervation of the tibialis 
anterior muscles in the hind limbs, whereas control-treated ani-
mals showed evidence of denervation of more than 75% of muscle 
endplates (Figure 3B). pNFH increases in CSF and serum in ALS 
rodent models, human patients with ALS, and other neurodegen-
erative diseases and it has been proposed as a potential pharmaco-
dynamics marker (20–22). SOD1 mice treated with ASO 1 showed 
lower levels of pNFH compared with SOD1 mice treated with con-
trol ASO (Figure 3C).
Reversal of SOD1-mediated neuronal dysfunction may be achieved 
by treatment with SOD1 ASO and is measurable by CMAP and pNFH 
levels. Two major questions regarding markers of disease in neu-
rodegenerative diseases are: to what extent therapeutics may be 
able reverse disease and whether this reversal can be measured. 
SOD1G93A mice were treated at 9 weeks of age when CMAP had 
clearly begun to decline and pNFH had begun to rise (Figure 
4, A and B). Treatment with ASO 3, an SOD1 ASO with dose-
dependent reductions in SOD1 mRNA similar to those in ASO 1 
and ASO 2 (Supplemental Figure 4), demonstrated a sustained 
increase in CMAP whereas control ASO–treated mice showed a 
continued steady decline (Figure 4A). Similarly, pNFH, which at 
time of injection (9 weeks) had already begun to rise in SOD1G93A 
mice (Figure 3C), was still significantly lower 8 weeks after treat-
ment with ASO 3 (inactive ASO–treated group, 22 ng/ml ± 1.9 
ng/ml; ASO 3–treated group, 12 ng/ml ± 1.2 ng/ml; mean ± SEM, 
 
P < 0.001) (Figure 4B). We also found that both pNFH serum 
and CSF levels were responsive to SOD1 ASO treatment in ALS 
when compared with the aCSF group (delayed by 17.5 days and 7 
days, respectively). Survival was markedly prolonged in the ASO 1 
and ASO 2 treatment groups by 53 days (P < 0.0001) and 64 days 
 
(P < 0.0001), respectively (Figure 2E), compared with aCSF con-
trol treatment in which rats survived to a median age of 166 days. 
This represents a 32% (ASO 1) and 39% (ASO 2) extension of sur-
vival. The effect was similar for both male and female rats (Supple-
mental Figure 2). This result is substantially improved compared 
with published results using ASO 333611 infused intraventri-
cularly (10 days, ref. 8) or compared with ASO 333611 delivered 
intrathecally in this study (195-day median survival, 29-day pro-
longation) (Figure 2E).
To assess if timing of administration impacts disease onset or 
survival, SOD1G93A mice were dosed with either ASO 1 or inactive 
control by i.c.v. bolus at a single time point, either day 80 or 110. Dis-
ease onset was delayed and survival markedly extended regardless 
of the time point of injection (Supplemental Figure 3). There was no 
significant difference in the onset or survival between the 80-day 
active ASO treatment and the 110-day active ASO treatment.
SOD1 ASO treatment preserves compound muscle action poten-
tial, maintains neuromuscular innervation, and results in lower levels 
Figure 3. One single i.c.v. injection of SOD1 ASO extensively preserves 
neuromuscular synapses and neuronal loss in SOD1G93A mutant mice. 
(A–C) Mice were injected once at 5 weeks of age with a single dose of 300 
μg ASO 1. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP), neuromuscular 
junctions (NMJ), and phospho-neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH) were 
measured at multiple time points (n = 12 per group; average ± SEM). (A) 
Results validated a significant effect of ASO 1 as compared with the 
inactive ASO (significant at weeks 7–17). CMAP values recorded from ASO 
1–treated animals were not significantly different from those recorded 
from WT animals except at weeks 15 and 17 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001, 
respectively, 2-way ANOVA). (B) ASO 1 significantly protected SOD1 mice 
from NMJ loss at the tibialis anterior muscle. Although there was a sig-
nificant difference in NMJ number between WT animals and SOD1 animals 
injected with a control ASO at all ages analyzed (data not shown), ASO 1–
treated mice did not show significant differences compared with WT mice 
(P < 0.0001). (C) Blood was collected at baseline (5 weeks) before i.c.v. 
injection, and then again at 8 and 10 weeks of age. pNFH serum levels 
were significantly decreased at 8 and 10 weeks of age by ASO 1 treatment 
(P < 0.001, 2-way ANOVA).

dependent manner (Figure 5A). Quantification of drug levels in 
various tissues confirmed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
relationship, with an estimated composite EC50 of 20 μg/g tissue 
(Figure 5B). This is consistent across all tissues assessed (Supple-
mental Figure 7). The decrease in potency in NHP SOD1 compared 
with human SOD1 in transgenic rodents (Figure 1E, EC50 0.9–1.4 
μg/g) is likely attributable, in part, to the single mismatch of ASO 
1 to the NHP SOD1 transcript. SOD1 protein levels in the tissue 
were lowered by approximately 50% (Figure 5C). A corresponding 
dose-dependent decrease in CSF SOD1 levels was also observed, 
confirming CSF SOD1 levels reflect target reduction in the CNS 
in the larger NHP brain (Figure 5D). CSF SOD1 protein remains 
reduced approximately 100 days after the last administration 
(Figure 5E). These data in NHPs demonstrate effectiveness of the 
SOD1 ASO in a larger animal and are an important step toward 
understanding the use of the compound in human clinical trials.
Discussion
ASOs targeting SOD1 were previously used to demonstrate 
widespread distribution of ASOs in the CNS following CSF 
delivery, proof of principle in animal models, and important 
early safety in a first-in-humans clinical study (8, 9, 24). Bene-
fiting from advancements in ASO technology, here we describe 
other, more potent ASOs that demonstrate a prolonged survival 
benefit in both mouse and rat SOD1 models, the longest to date 
using a relevant therapeutic. With this added ASO potency, we 
were able to test whether treating after the disease progressed 
would also provide benefit, and we found a notable reversal of 
the CMAP. These data establish a novel therapeutic for SOD1-
mediated ALS, which is currently under clinical investigation 
(NCT02623699).
For many genetically linked neurodegenerative diseases, 
patients remain asymptomatic for more than 5 decades but when 
they develop signs of disease, the progression is relatively rapid 
over a period of about 5 years. Understandably, there is concern 
that once the disease starts, it may be difficult or impossible to 
slow or reverse the neurodegenerative process. We have attempted 
 
to address the importance of timing in 2 approaches. The first was 
to limit the intervention to a single time point, ranging from early 
in the mouse’s life to well after some disease processes, such as 
denervation of the tibialis, have occurred. Using mouse clinical 
measures such as disease onset or survival, timing was irrelevant 
to the magnitude of benefit. Potentially of greater interest are the 
data in Figure 4A showing reversal of a specific, highly quantifi-
able endpoint in this very rapid model of ALS. CMAP is the sum-
mation of the amount of functional innervation to a given muscle. 
The fact that this measure increases in mice in the ASO treatment 
setting demonstrates a remarkable ability for the motor system 
to recover. Concomitant with this, there was decreased dener-
vation at the neuromuscular junction, reinforcing the functional 
recovery (Figure 4B). We also demonstrated that serum and CSF 
pNFH levels, which are increased in rodent and human ALS, were 
decreased by this therapy. This defines, for the first time, serum 
and CSF pNFH levels as a pharmacodynamic marker for ASO 
therapy. Perhaps even more importantly, these neurofilament 
data suggest that any particularly effective therapy in humans 
may reverse the rise in serum/CSF pNFH. Taken together, these 
rats (Supplemental Figure 5). Furthermore, it was recently dem-
onstrated that motor neuron–enriched miR-218 is temporally 
increased in ALS rat model CSF and its levels correlate with motor 
neuron loss (23). Here, we found that miR-218 CSF levels were 
also responsive to SOD1 ASO therapy (Supplemental Figure 5). 
These results suggest that SOD1-mediated neuronal dysfunction 
is, at least in part, reversible with a potent therapeutic.
SOD1 ASOs lower SOD1 mRNA and protein in nonhuman pri-
mates. To evaluate the distribution and pharmacokinetic proper-
ties of the new SOD1 ASO in a larger brain, ASO 1 was delivered 
via intrathecal injection to cynomolgus monkeys. ASO 1 was 
optimized for targeting human SOD1, but it is complementary to 
nonhuman primate (NHP) SOD1 with a 1-base mismatch, and it 
is active in NHP cells (Supplemental Figure 6). ASO 1 was evalu-
ated in NHPs at doses of 4 mg, 12 mg, and 35 mg delivered intra-
thecally, with each monkey receiving 5 doses. One week after the 
final dose, SOD1 mRNA was lowered broadly in the CNS in a dose-
Figure 4. SOD1 ASO injected at 9 weeks of age is able to reverse CMAP 
amplitudes and lower serum pNFH levels in SOD1G93A mutant mice. (A and 
B) Mice were injected once at 9 weeks of age with either a control ASO or 
with ASO 3 (100 μg). (A) CMAP amplitudes at the tibialis anterior muscles 
were recorded at baseline (5 weeks) and then every other week thereafter  
(n = 12 per group, average ± SEM). On the week of dosing (9 weeks), CMAP 
was recorded prior to i.c.v. injection. Typically, SOD1 mice show a steady 
decline in the CMAP amplitudes recorded at the tibialis anterior; however, 
one single dose of ASO 3 at 9 weeks of age was able to reverse the trend 
and by 15 weeks the ASO 3–treated mice had CMAP amplitudes signifi-
cantly higher than mice treated with a control ASO (P < 0.001, 2-way 
ANOVA). (B) Blood was collected from each animal at 9, 11, 13, 15, and 
17 weeks of age and pNFH levels were quantified. pNFH serum levels of 
control mice showed a steady increase whereas those of ASO 3–treated 
mice did not. Levels at 15 weeks: inactive ASO, 19.9 ng/ml ± 5.1 ng/ml; ASO 
3, 10.6 ng/ml ± 2.5 ng/ml. Levels at 17 weeks: inactive ASO, 33.96 ng/ml ± 
9.3 ng/ml; ASO 3, 16.5 ng/ml ± 4.3 ng/ml. P < 0.0001, 2-way ANOVA, n = 12 
per group, average ± SEM.

data show reversal of neurodegeneration and define electrophysi-
ologic and serum pharmacodynamic markers that can be directly 
 
translated to human clinical studies. miR-218, a motor neuron–
specific microRNA, also shows changes in CSF with SOD1 ASO 
treatment in SOD1G93A rats and may be another outstanding phar-
macodynamic marker for motor neuron–targeted therapeutics 
(23). Measuring miR-218 in human CSF will be a critical next step.
Clinical trials in a rare population such as SOD1-related ALS 
may be challenging given the relatively small number of patients 
affected by the disease, but much of the groundwork for such a 
trial has been established. Natural history studies of SOD1 ALS 
have defined survival times in this patient group. For people with 
A4V mutations in SOD1, which represent 50% of the SOD1-asso-
ciated ALS population in the United States, survival is 1.2 years. If 
we anticipate a change of 50% in survival in patients, as few as 52 
 
participants would be needed to determine if an ASO changed sur-
vival (25). An even more important first step in clinical trials is to 
determine if SOD1 in the CSF is lowered by the ASO. The NHP CSF 
data included here demonstrate that an intrathecally adminis-
tered ASO can reduce CSF target protein concentrations, confirm-
ing CSF protein as a translational pharmacodynamic end point. 
Similar clinical measures of CSF SOD1 protein are crucial to dem-
onstrate drug action and pharmacodynamic activity for ongoing 
 
clinical trials (24). Recent SOD1 protein kinetics (26) have deter-
mined the half-life of CSF SOD1 in humans to be 25 ± 7.4 days.
One concern for this approach is the safety associated with 
loss of SOD1 expression. While safety will remain an important 
consideration in human clinical studies, for SOD1 ALS there are 
several data points that provide some reassurance. As noted above, 
extensive evidence supports the primary toxicity of SOD1 muta-
tions as resulting from gaining a novel toxic property. Overexpres-
sion of mutant SOD1 in mice or rats mimics important aspects of 
ALS in humans, including loss of neuromuscular junction innerva-
tion and motor neuron death (1, 2). Loss of SOD1 results in motor 
 
neuron dysfunction but not motor neuron death (3, 4), and nei-
ther loss nor increase of normal SOD1 activity in mouse models 
of SOD1 ALS alters survival (27). In humans, individual disease 
mutations are associated with varying levels of SOD1 activity, and 
some patients with disease-causing mutations even have appar-
ently normal SOD1 activity (7). Lastly, SOD1 ASOs have been 
found to be safe in humans (9). A clinical trial based on this prior 
work and the work presented here is already underway in SOD1-
related ALS (NCT02623699) using ASO 1.
For many neurodegenerative diseases, the proteins implicated 
by genetic forms of the disease are also implicated in the pathways 
or pathology of a broad number of cases. Based on this experience, 
it was anticipated that SOD1 would be involved broadly in ALS. 
The data regarding this issue are not yet clear. Using some staining 
protocols, misfolded SOD1 may be found in pathological samples 
from non-SOD1 genetic ALS (28). However, other studies have 
not replicated these findings (29). The simple explanation of using 
 
different reagents and samples does not fully explain the discrep-
Figure 5. SOD1 ASO lowers SOD1 in nonhuman primate CNS and CSF. (A–C) The safety of the ASO was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys, which also provided 
an opportunity to understand the on-target activity of the ASO and the utility of SOD1 in the cerebrospinal fluid as a marker of target suppression in the 
tissue. Monkeys were dosed with artificial CSF or 4, 12, or 35 mg ASO 1, with each monkey receiving 5 doses. One week after the final dose, SOD1 mRNA and 
protein were quantified and associated with ASO concentration across brain regions. (A) A dose-dependent lowering of mRNA across CNS regions, including 
the lumbar spinal cord, was observed (n = 6, average ± SEM). L, lumbar; Th, thoracic; Cerv, cervical; Fr, frontal cortex; Motor, motor cortex; Hip, hippocampus; 
Pons, pons; Cb, cerebellum. (B) A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship could be observed, with an estimated IC50 of 20 μg/g tissue (n = 126, each 
point representing one tissue). (C) A dose-dependent lowering of SOD1 protein across CNS regions, including the lumbar spinal cord, was observed (n = 6, aver-
age ± SEM). aCSF, artificial CSF. (D) A dose-dependent lowering of SOD1 protein in CSF as compared with the vehicle-treated group was observed (n = 6; line, 
average; 4 mg, P = 0.0019; 12 mg, P = 0.0006; 35 mg, P = 0.0003; 1-way ANOVA). **P < 0.005; ***P < 0.001. (E) CSF SOD1 protein remains significantly reduced 
as compared with day 0, roughly 100 days following the last intrathecal ASO administration (n = 6, average ± SEM; ****P = 0.0001; 1-way ANOVA).

ancies. Perhaps most intriguing are data showing that lowering 
SOD1 in human astrocytes or oligodendrocytes decreases the tox-
icity of these cells to cultured motor neurons (30, 31). Overall, while 
these data are suggestive that SOD1 may be involved more broadly 
in ALS than the 1%–2% of the ALS population with genetic SOD1 
mutations, the data are not yet strong enough to push forward a 
SOD1-lowering therapy in all ALS. As further data emerge on SOD1 
in sporadic ALS and as we learn more about safety and efficacy of 
ASOs in the SOD1 genetic population, SOD1 ASOs for ALS without 
known SOD1 mutations will likely need to be reconsidered.
ASO therapeutics for neurologic diseases are in clinical trial 
or are anticipated shortly for clinical trial for a number of dis-
orders. Phase III trials for a splicing ASO for spinal muscular 
atrophy (SMA) were stopped early because of success and led 
to recent FDA approval of these drugs for clinical use (14). A 
splicing ASO recently received conditional approval for Duch-
enne muscular dystrophy (32). ASOs for Huntington’s disease 
are currently in phase I trial in Europe. ASO lowering of tau 
showed impressive efficacy in mouse preclinical studies (12) 
and is in early clinical trials (NCT03186989). ASOs targeting 
C9ORF72 expansions that cause ALS/FTD showed efficacy in 
stem cell–derived neurons (33, 34) and mouse models (35) and 
are likely to be in human clinical trial in the near future. Thus, 
the approach outlined here for targeting mRNA in the brain and 
spinal cord with ASOs is increasingly being used for neurologi-
cal disorders and hopefully will become part of a clinical treat-
ment paradigm, as in SMA.
While we are enthusiastic and encouraged by the demonstra-
tion of reversal in these studies, we recognize that these results 
may or may not directly translate to humans. Subsequent data 
from human clinical studies compared with the data presented 
here may be the best opportunity to fully evaluate the transla-
tional potential of SOD1 models. There has been much prior 
criticism of SOD1 models and their failure to predict efficacy in 
humans, but for the vast majority of these failed clinical studies, 
2 important components were often missing: first, a demonstra-
tion that the pathway targeted by the drug was involved in the 
 
participants being treated; and second, a pharmacodynamic 
marker to demonstrate that the drug worked as designed in 
humans. The ASO SOD1 trial in humans with SOD1 ALS is 
directly on target and the pharmacodynamic marker, SOD1 in 
the CSF, has been clearly defined (26).
There are other methods to target SOD1 mRNA. Indeed, 
recent data in animal models using virally driven RNAi showed 
promising results (36, 37). While there may be some additional 
issues surrounding delivery of virus, these strategies are plau-
sible. Antibodies that target SOD1 are currently being devel-
oped (38–41). In addition, small molecules targeting SOD1 have 
been considered. Pyrimethamine has been tested in phase I/II 
trial and showed an approximately 10%–15% lowering of SOD1 
in CSF (42). Arimoclomol, a heat shock protein activator, was 
tested in rapidly progressive ALS. Patients treated with arimo-
clomol showed a trend toward longer survival (43). It is possible 
that some of these approaches could be used in conjunction with 
ASOs. All, including ASOs, require ongoing studies in human 
SOD1 ALS to determine success.
In conclusion, ASOs targeting SOD1 show extension of sur-
vival in SOD1 mice and rat models and reversal of CMAP. These 
ASOs are also effective in NHPs. Given the growing experience 
with ASOs in clinical trials, the new SOD1 ASOs are an exciting 
therapeutic for human SOD1 ALS.
Methods
Antisense oligonucleotides. The antisense oligonucleotides used in the 
present study are described in Table 1 and were manufactured and 
provided by Ionis Pharmaceuticals.
Intrathecal bolus injection in the rat. SOD1G93A transgenic rats 
received a 30-μl intrathecal bolus injection via polyethylene catheter 
placed between the L3 and L5 vertebrae of the lumber spinal cord, as 
previously described (44). For proof-of-concept studies, 65-day-old 
rats were given 1000 μg ASO 1, ASO 2, ASO 3, ASO 333611, inactive 
ASO, or an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) vehicle control. All 
ASOs were provided by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and diluted in aCSF. All 
treatment groups were sexual phenotype– and litter-matched to con-
trol for drift in copy count or sexual phenotype–induced variances. In 
addition, researchers were blinded to the identity of the ASO at the 
time of treatment and throughout the duration of the experiment. For 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, adult animals were 
dosed and tissue was collected 2 weeks after dosing for RNA quantifi-
cation, unless otherwise noted.
Dosing of mice. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions were 
performed as previously described (45). Surgeries were conducted 
according to Biogen Guidance for Aseptic Rodent Surgery. Animals 
were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. The eyes of the animal 
were treated with ocular lubricant. The fur of the scalps and anterior 
backs were clipped and the animal was placed in a stereotaxic appara-
tus. Buprenorphine was administered subcutaneously prior to incision 
(1.0 mg/kg). An 11.5-cm, slightly off-center incision was made in the 
scalp. A 25-gauge needle attached to a Hamilton syringe was placed 
at bregma level and the needle was then moved to the appropriate 
anterior/posterior and medial/lateral coordinates (0.2 mm anterior/
posterior and 1 mm to the right medial/lateral). The proper amount 
of injection solution was injected at rates of approximately 1 μl/ 
second for a total of 10 μl. This flow rate has been shown to deliver 
sufficient compound with consistency and no side effect to the animal.

neously image GFP and RFP. Both automated and manual counting 
methods for TMR-α–bungarotoxin and VAchT were performed.
pNFH quantification. pNFH serum levels were measured through 
the ELLA microfluidic ELISA platform (Protein Simple) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a maximum of 100 μl blood 
was collected through facial vein puncture at the indicated time points. 
Serum samples were prepared by centrifugation of BD Vacutainer SST 
tubes (BD Diagnostics) and stored at –80°C until used.
Gyrolab assay for misfolded SOD1 protein. Rat spinal cord samples 
were homogenized in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCL, 10% glycerol, 
1% Triton X-100 and then diluted at 1:30. Misfolded SOD1 protein was 
measured with the following antibodies: capture antibody D3H5 (40) 
(working concentration: 100 μg/ml); and detection antibody B8H10 
(working concentration, 50 nM; Medimabs MM-0070-P). Concentra-
tions were measured on a Gyrolab XP Workstation based on a standard 
curve of denatured recombinant human SOD1 protein.
Cynomolgus monkey SOD1 protein quantification. Protein levels 
were measured using an ELISA method specifically qualified to quan-
tify the amount of SOD1 in cynomolgus monkey brain tissue and CSF. 
Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with SD-G6 antibody diluted in 
0.2 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer and blocked with SuperBlock-
PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hours at ambient temperature. 
The SOD1 reference standard was generated at Biogen and was used 
to prepare standards and quality controls (QCs) to final concentrations 
in SuperBlock-PBS. Cynomolgus brain tissue, CSF samples, and the 
endogenous QC (EQC) were diluted 1:64 with SuperBlock-PBS. Plates 
were incubated for 1 hour with sample, washed, and then incubated 
with 2.5 μg/ml SOD-100 antibody diluted in SuperBlock-PBS for 1 
hour, then washed and incubated for 1 hour with 1:32,000 dilution 
goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated antibody. After washing, TMB 
substrate was added.
Study approval and experimental animals. SOD1G93A rats (Taconic 
Biosciences, model 2148) were bred in-house on a Sprague-Dawley 
background. All rats were kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. SOD1G93A 
mice (B6.CgTg(SOD1*G93A)Gur/J) were bred and maintained at the 
Jackson Laboratories breeding facility. Food and water were provided 
ad libitum. Breeding and experimental procedures were completed 
in accordance with an animal use protocol approved by the Animal 
 
Studies Committee at Washington University School of Medicine, 
Biogen, and Ionis Pharmaceuticals. All mouse studies were conducted 
using female animals only.
The NHP study was performed at Covance Laboratories GmbH. 
Covance Laboratories GmbH test facility is fully accredited by the 
AAALAC. All procedures in the study plan were in compliance with 
the German Animal Welfare Act and were approved by the local 
IACUC. Briefly, 30 healthy cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicu-
laris) approximately 2–5 years of age and between 2–6 kg in weight at 
study start were used for testing. NHPs were administered, by intra-
thecal bolus injection, 5 doses of ASO or aCSF on days 1, 14, 28, 56, and 
84 with 1.0 ml dosing volume using a 35 mg/ml dosing solution. NHPs 
were euthanized on day 91. CSF collection was performed predose 
at day 1 (baseline) and at day 91, just before necropsy. To determine 
the time frame for SOD1 protein recovery, CSF was collected from a 
separate cohort of animals predose on day 1 (baseline), and predose 
on days 56, 91, 112, and 119. NHPs received neurological examinations 
predose on days 1, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 91 and at least once every 2 weeks 
between days 28 and 91.
The incision was sutured closed using 1 horizontal mattress stitch with 
5O Ethilon suture. Depending on the experiment, mice were injected 
either once (at day 35) or twice (at day 50 and day 94) in order to obtain 
sustained mRNA lowering of SOD1.
Motor assessments in the rat. Prior to surgery, rats were assessed for 
baseline weight and general motor capabilities. Following surgery, rats 
were monitored weekly for changes in these values. Weight loss was cal-
culated from the time of surgery to identify disease onset (peak weight) 
(46). When an animal began to show paralysis in any portion of the body, 
a HydroGel pack (Clear H2O) was placed on the bottom of the home cage 
to limit dehydration. Monitoring continued until the rats reached end-
stage, defined as loss of the ability to right itself after being placed on its 
side, or inability to ambulate from a given location. The date of end-stage 
and subsequent euthanasia was recorded for survival analyses.
Euthanasia and tissue collection. For proof-of-concept studies, 
upon reaching end-stage, rats were exsanguinated by transcardial 
perfusion with heparinized (0.03%) PBS. Sections of the brain and 
spinal cord were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein 
analysis. For pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, follow-
ing in-life completion, animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 
as approved by IACUC protocol. For RNA analysis, 2-mm sections of 
lumbar spinal cord were collected. Adjacent to the RNA sampling, 
pieces of lumbar cord were also collected for ASO quantification. Each 
dissected region was then frozen at –80°C until analysis.
Rotarod in mice. Mice were given 1 day to become familiar with the 
rotarod apparatus before the test by placing them on a rod slowly rotat-
ing at 2 rpm for 5 minutes. To determine motor function deficiency, 
mice were put on the rod at increasing speeds from 2 rpm to 40 rpm in 
180 seconds and at 40 rpm for an additional 60 seconds. Tests were 
given 2 times in a day. Mice were tested once a week starting at 80 
days of age until they could not stay on the rod for at least 30 seconds.
Compound muscle action potential. CMAP recordings were per-
formed at the indicated time points under isoflurane anesthesia. Dispos-
able monopolar 28-gauge needle electrodes were used for stimulation 
and recording. The sciatic nerve was stimulated near the sciatic notch 
with constant-current monophasic square-wave pulses (0.1 millisecond 
duration, 2-second intervals). For CMAP recordings, the recording elec-
trode was placed intramuscularly 1 mm deep in the tibialis anterior. Stim-
ulation current was increased until a maximum CMAP was obtained, 
and recordings were performed using a current level 0.5 mA above this 
value (supramaximal stimulation). The amplitude represents the peak-
to-peak amplitude of the biphasic CMAP waveform (averaged over 4 
stimuli). For each animal, right and left leg amplitudes were averaged.
NMJ staining and counting. Tibialis anterior muscle samples were 
postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 minutes after collec-
tion and then incubated into 20% sucrose for 24 hours for cryoprotec-
tion. Samples were shipped to Clarapath Inc. for analysis. All samples 
were sectioned using the Clarapath Inc. tape-transfer system at 20 
μm in a cryostat. Sections were collected directly onto glass slides. 
Slides were stained with a rabbit antivesicular acetylcholine trans-
porter (VAchT; 1:11,000); the antibody was provided by Target ALS 
through Covance. The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 488 
donkey anti-rabbit (Life Technologies). All slides were counterstained 
with TMR-α–bungarotoxin (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 
1:750. All stained slides were imaged using a ×20 objective (0.75 NA) 
at a resolution of 0.45 μm/pixel. A single focal plane was collected for 
all samples. A multiband fluorescence filter set was used to simulta-

Statistics. P < 0.05 was considered significant for all stud-
ies. For survival studies for mice and rats, a log-rank Mantel-Cox 
test was used. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc 
test was performed for Figure 5, D and E. IC50 values were cal-
culated with the formula log (inhibitor) vs. response – variable 
slope (4 parameters), using Prism6 software formula log (agonist) 
vs. response - find ECanything, with the following constraints: 
 
bottom > 0, top = 100, F = 50 for ED50 and EC50, and F = 80 for EC80. 
For all other comparisons, a 2-way ANOVA was used.
