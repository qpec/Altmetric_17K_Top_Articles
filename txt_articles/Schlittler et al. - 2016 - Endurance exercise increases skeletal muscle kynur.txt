emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with depressive
disorder. Recent animal studies show that exercise protects from
depression by increased skeletal muscle kynurenine aminotransferase
(KAT) expression which shifts the kynurenine metabolism away from
the neurotoxic kynurenine (KYN) to the production of kynurenic acid
(KYNA). In the present study, we investigated the effect of exercise
on kynurenine metabolism in humans. KAT gene and protein expres-
sion was increased in the muscles of endurance-trained subjects
compared with untrained subjects. Endurance exercise caused an
increase in plasma KYNA within the first hour after exercise. In
contrast, a bout of high-intensity eccentric exercise did not lead to
increased plasma KYNA concentration. Our results show that regular
endurance exercise causes adaptations in kynurenine metabolism
which can have implications for exercise recommendations for pa-
tients with depressive disorder.

DEPRESSION IS A DISABLING mental disorder with a large impact
on quality of life (9, 12). Furthermore, with almost 300 million
people affected worldwide, depressive disorders are a major
burden for the health care system (8, 9). Evidence-based
treatment strategies include antidepressant pharmacotherapy
and psychotherapy (15). Moreover, physical exercise is in-
creasingly used to complement or substitute traditional meth-
ods even though the underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood (4, 13).
A recent study showed that modifications of the kynurenine
pathway are involved in the beneficial effects of exercise on
depression (1). Kynurenine (KYN) is a product of tryptophan
metabolism and its degradation follows one of two possible
pathways: KYN is either converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine
(3HK) and quinolinic acid (QUIN), a neurotoxic N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist or to the neuroprotective
NMDA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA). In
the brain, the conversion to KYNA is catalyzed by kynurenine
aminotransferases (KATs) found in astrocytes (17, 18, 20). The
same enzymes have been detected in peripheral tissues such as
skeletal muscle (1). The relative balance between the two
branches of the pathway may play an important role in the
development of depressive disorders. In fact, induction of the
neurotoxic branch with increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid
QUIN and an increased serum QUIN-to-KYNA ratio (QUIN/
KYNA) have been associated with depressive behavior (2, 5,
18, 20, 21).
Exercise activates the PGC-1�1-PPAR�/� pathway which
has been shown to induce skeletal muscle KAT expression (1,
19). Experiments with PGC-1�1 skeletal muscle-specific trans-
genic mice showed that an increased expression of skeletal
muscle KATs shifts the KYN metabolism towards enhanced
synthesis of KYNA which reduces accumulation of KYN,
hereby protecting from stress-induced depression (1).
Sedentary human subjects had increased skeletal muscle
KAT gene expression after participating in a 3-wk endurance
exercise program (1). Little is known, however, of the effect of
exercise on skeletal muscle KAT protein levels and on plasma
kynurenine metabolites in humans.
In the present study, we therefore compared KAT protein
expression of endurance-trained and untrained subjects. In
addition, we measured plasma KYNA and QUIN concentra-
tions after different types of exercise.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human experiments. Skeletal muscle biopsies from two groups of
subjects were used for analysis of mRNA and protein expression. The
first group consisted of nine recreationally active male subjects who
were pursuing endurance training for a 150-km road cycling time trial
(END; 11.8 � 4.8 training hours per week). The subjects of the
second group (CTRL; n � 8; all male) were also recreationally active
but did not specifically participate in endurance training. Skeletal
muscle biopsies were taken from m. vastus lateralis under local
anesthesia using the Pajunk DeltaCut system (Pajunk, Geisingen,
Germany). Approximately 30 mg of muscle tissue was collected for
each subject, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at �80°C until
further analysis. Local compression was applied on the biopsy site for
a few hours.
Blood plasma was collected from both groups at rest and from the
END group several time points after completion of the 150-km road
cycling time trial. In addition, we collected plasma from another
group of recreationally active subjects (n � 11; 10 male, 1 female)
before and after running a half-marathon race on a hilly course.
Furthermore, plasma was collected from a third group of subjects
before and after performing eccentric exercise that consisted of a
series of 100 drop jumps from a 50-cm platform with active deceler-
ation to 90° knee angle, immediately followed by a maximal rebound
jump (n � 9; all male). Venous blood samples were collected in

 EDTA-treated vacutainers and centrifuged for 15 min (3,000 rpm and
4°C). Plasma was then transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored at
�80°C until analysis.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee and each
subject provided written informed consent before participation.
Western blot analysis. Frozen human vastus lateralis biopsies were
homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 �l/mg muscle)
with a ground glass homogenizer. The buffer (pH 7.6) consisted of 20
mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 20% glycerol (vol/vol), 0.5% Triton X-100 (vol/vol), and 1
tablet per 50 ml protease inhibitor cocktail (no. 11836145001, Roche).
Homogenates were rotated for 30 min at 4°C and subsequently
centrifuged at 700 g and 4°C for 10 min. Protein content of the
supernatant was quantified using the Bradford assay (no. 500-0006,
Bio-Rad) and samples were diluted 1:1 in Laemmli sample buffer (no.
161-0737EDU, Bio-Rad) with 5% �-mercaptoethanol (vol/vol) and
heated at 95°C for 5 min.
Protein (10 �g/well) was separated on a 4–12% precast Bis-Tris
gel (NP0336PK2, NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred to polyviny-
lidine fluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Billerica, MA).
Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with LI-COR
blocking buffer (927-40000, LI-COR) and incubated overnight at 4°C
with the following antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: 1:1,000
rabbit anti-KAT1 (anti-CCBL1, 12156-1-AP, Proteintech, Man-
chester, UK), 1:1,000 rabbit anti-KAT2 (anti-KATII/AADAT, LS-
C309277/65009, LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA), 1:200 rabbit
anti-KAT3 (anti-CCBL2, HPA026538, Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm,
Sweden), 1:800 rabbit anti-KAT4 (Antibodies-Online, Aachen, Ger-
many), and mouse anti-actin (ab3280, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
While the antibodies for KAT 1, KAT 3, and KAT 4 clearly gave one
specific band, the KAT 2 antibody showed more than one band per
lane and only the band at the specific size of KAT 2 (47 kDa) was
quantified. After washing with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, mem-
branes were incubated with secondary antibody [1:15,000 IRDye
680-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and IRDye 800-conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer (926-68072 and 926-32213,
LI-COR)] at room temperature for 1 h.
Bands were visualized by infrared fluorescence (IR-Odyssey scan-
ner, LI-COR Biosciences) and band densities were quantified using
Image Studio software (version 2.0.38; LI-COR Biosciences) soft-
ware. All values were normalized to �-actin.
Analysis of gene expression. Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (5 PRIME)
was used to isolate total RNA from the muscle biopsies. Amplification
Grade DNase I (Life Technologies) was added to 1 �g of RNA and
from that, 500 ng were used for cDNA preparation with the Applied
Biosystem Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). A ViiA 7
Real-Time PCR system thermal cycler with SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (both Applied Biosystems) was used for quantitative real-time
PCR. Gene expression analysis was performed using the ��Ct
method and all values were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphori-
bosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA levels relative to controls.
High-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma samples
were diluted (1:2, vol/vol) with 0.4 M perchloric acid (PCA) contain-
ing 0.1% sodium metabisulfite and 0.05% EDTA and then centrifuged
for 5 min at 21,000 g immediately before analysis. The supernatant
was further diluted (1:1,10, vol/vol) with 70% strength PCA and
re-centrifuged for 5 min at 21, 000 g. The supernatant was transferred
to a new Eppendorf tube for high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). HPLC was performed using an isocratic HPLC system with
a dual-piston, high-pressure delivery pump (LC 10AD Shimadzu,
Japan) and a ReproSil-Pur C18 column (4 � 150 mm, Dr. Maisch,
Ammerbuch, Germany). A fluorescence detector (Jasco FP-2020,
Hachioji City, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 344 nm and an
emission wavelength of 398 nm (18 nm bandwidth) was used for
detection.
A mobile phase (7.0% acetonitrile and 50 mM sodium acetate in
ultrapure dH20; pH 6.20 adjusted with acetic acid) was pumped
through the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Twenty-microliter
samples were manually injected into a Rheodyne injector (Rhonert
Park, CA) with a 100-�l single sample loop volume. A zinc acetate
(0.5 M not pH adjusted) buffer was added postcolumnar (pump P-500
Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. The fluores-
cence signals were digitized and analyzed with Datalys Azur Software
(Grenoble, France). The concentration of KYNA was extrapolated
from daily prepared standard curves by dilution of aliquots. The
retention time for KYNA was 7.8 min. The limits of detections were
at least 20 times lower than the reported plasma concentrations.
QUIN analysis was performed with liquid chromatography/tandem
mass spectrometry at BEVITAL AS (Norway) as previously de-
scribed (16).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 6. Data are presented as means � SE, and P � 0.05
was considered to be significant. Differences in KYNA plasma con-
centrations and QUIN/KYNA ratio before and after exercise were
assessed with one-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a
Tukey post hoc test. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare gene and
protein expression between different groups. Correlations were cal-
culated by Spearman rank correlation.
RESULTS
Gene and protein expression in skeletal muscle. To investi-
gate whether practicing endurance exercise on a regular basis
can affect skeletal muscle KAT expression, we compared
muscle biopsies from actively endurance trained (END) and
control subjects (CTRL). Changes in the expression of KAT
genes and its upstream regulatory pathway PGC1�1-PPAR�/�
were analyzed. Muscle biopsies from the END subjects dis-
played higher mRNA expression for KAT isoforms 1–4 than
the CTRL group (Fig. 1A). Moreover, mRNA expression of
PGC-1�1 and PPAR� genes were significantly higher in the
END subjects than in CTRL, whereas PPAR� was similar in
the two groups (Fig. 1A). To further confirm that the PGC-1�1
pathway was activated in the END group, the PGC-1�1 down-
stream genes CPT1B, VEGFA, and PDK4 were analyzed and
all three showed higher expression in END than in CTRL
(Fig. 1A).
The expression of PGC-1�1 and PPAR� genes directly
correlated with KAT 4 gene expression (Fig. 1B).
To further confirm that the observed changes in KAT gene
expression correspond to changes in protein levels, we per-
formed immunoblotting using specific antibodies. KAT protein
expression was significantly higher in the END group than in
the CTRL group (Fig. 2, A and B).
Plasma kynurenine metabolites. To study changes in
kynurenine metabolism during exercise, we measured KYNA
and QUIN concentrations and calculated the QUIN/KYNA
ratio in plasma samples from subjects before and after per-
forming different types of exercise.
One hour after a 150-km road cycling time trial, plasma
KYNA was substantially increased by 63% (Fig. 3A), whereas
QUIN only increased by 19% (338 � 16 nM to 404 � 30 nM;
n � 9, P � 0.05). The QUIN/KYNA ratio decreased after
exercise by 27% (Fig. 3B). The KYNA concentration and
QUIN/KYNA ratio returned to baseline within 24 h (Fig. 3, A
and B). To further confirm that endurance exercise leads to
increased plasma KYNA, another group of subjects was ana-
lyzed before and after performing a half- marathon race on a
hilly course. This group also showed an increase (125%) in
plasma KYNA 30 min after finishing the race (36 � 3 nM to

 81 � 8 nM, n � 11, P � 0.0001). In contrast, plasma
concentration of KYNA, QUIN, and the QUIN/KYNA ratio
were not changed in subjects that performed eccentric exercise
consisting of a series of 100 drop jumps (Fig. 3, C and D). In
summary, plasma concentration of KYNA increases and the
QUIN/KYNA ratio decreases transiently following endurance
exercise but not after eccentric muscle work.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated whether regular partic-
ipation in endurance exercise can lead to long-term adaptations
of peripheral KYN metabolism in humans. We show that
endurance exercise causes a transient increase in plasma
KYNA concentration and a reduction in the QUIN/KYNA
ratio. Moreover, in endurance-trained individuals, long-term
muscle adaptations in the KYN metabolism occur by increased
expression of KAT genes and proteins, which is linked to
upregulation of PGC-1�1 and PPAR� gene expression.
Recreationally active humans who were engaged in endur-
ance exercise on a regular basis had higher skeletal muscle

 KAT gene expression than subjects with no specific endurance
training. These results are consistent with a previous study that
reported an increase in KAT gene expression in sedentary
subjects after a 3-wk endurance exercise program (1). That
study also found elevated PGC-1�1, PPAR�, and PPAR� gene
expression after exercise and demonstrated that activation of
the PGC-1�1-PPAR�/� pathway is the underlying mechanism
for KAT upregulation. We also observed higher PGC-1�1 and
PPAR� gene expression for the END subjects, but PPAR�
gene expression did not differ between the two groups. In
further support for an increased activity of the PGC-1�1
pathway, we observed increased expression of the PGC-1�1
downstream genes CPT1B, VEGFA, and PDK4 in endurance
athletes.
To our knowledge, only one previous study has investigated
the effect of exercise on skeletal muscle KATs in humans (1).
That study reported only mRNA expression which is not
always mirrored by a corresponding increase in protein levels.
We here show that humans participating in active endurance
training display both an increased mRNA expression of the
KAT genes as well as increased protein levels, which supports
a mechanism of exercise-induced adaptations in the KYN
pathway as previously reported (1).
We show that, following aerobic endurance exercise, a
transient flux of the kynurenine pathway occurs with a prefer-
ential increase in the KYNA concentration (63%) over QUIN
(19%), leading to a decreased QUIN/KYNA ratio. This would
have relevance for patients with major depression as an in-
creased serum QUIN/KYNA ratio has been linked to patients
with depressive disorder. Interestingly, the QUIN/KYNA ratio
was reduced when depressive patients were treated with elec-
troconvulsive therapy (21).
To further investigate how other types of exercise affect
KYN metabolism, we analyzed plasma samples of subjects
who performed eccentric exercise (100 repeated drop jumps).
While this type of exercise is considerably less energetically
demanding than running or cycling, it still exerts substantial
stress on the muscle and induces extensive muscle soreness
(11). Nevertheless, the eccentric exercise protocol did not
cause any change in plasma KYNA or the QUIN/KYNA ratio.
A recent study that screened for plasma metabolite changes
following exercise reported an increase in plasma KYNA after
marathon running but not after a short treadmill exercise test
(14). In summary our results suggest that the exercise-induced
enhancement of the KYNA pathway is linked to endurance
exercise with a prolonged and high metabolic demand rather
than high force eccentric contractions.
The increase in plasma KYNA can possibly depend on
differences in the availability of free tryptophan (TRP). At rest,
the majority of TRP in the blood is bound to albumin and only
a small proportion is available in the free form. Free fatty acids
(FFA) competitively bind to albumin, and dissociate the bound
TRP thus increasing the concentration of free TRP in the blood
(3, 7). It is possible that the increased lipolysis and subsequent
rise in plasma FFA, which occurs during prolonged endurance
exercise (10), causes an increase in free TRP and thus an
increased flux through the kynurenine pathway.
In our study, resting plasma KYNA was similar in all
subjects. After endurance exercise, plasma KYNA concentra-
tion increased transiently. In this context it is noteworthy that
circulating KYNA is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, which
likely contributes to the decay of KYNA following exercise
(6). Thus transient and repeated, rather than sustained, in-
creases in plasma KYNA would be the link between KYNA-
induced reduction of depressive symptoms and exercise in
humans. This notion can have bearing on exercise recommen-
dations for patients with depression, which then should be
focused on repeated endurance-type training.
Our results show that recreationally active humans who
engage in regular endurance training have increased skeletal
muscle KAT gene and protein expression. Mice with increased
muscular KAT levels have been shown to be resilient to
stress-induced depression due to an enhanced peripheral con-
version of KYN to KYNA (1). Our study supports a similar
mechanism also in humans. This highlights the effect of
exercise on KYN metabolism in humans and opens up for
further mechanistic understanding on exercise as a treatment
for depressive disorders.
