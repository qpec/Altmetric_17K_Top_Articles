Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socio-economic problem, but no
pharmacological agent is currently approved for the treatment of acute TBI. Thus, there is a
great need for advances in this field. Here, we describe a short peptide (sequence CAQK)
identified by in vivo phage display screening in mice with acute brain injury. The CAQK
peptide selectively binds to injured mouse and human brain, and systemically injected CAQK
specifically homes to sites of brain injury in mouse models. The CAQK target is a
proteoglycan complex upregulated in brain injuries. Coupling to CAQK increased injury site
accumulation of systemically administered molecules ranging from a drug-sized molecule to
nanoparticles. CAQK-coated nanoparticles containing silencing oligonucleotides provided the
first evidence of gene silencing in injured brain parenchyma by systemically administered
siRNA. These findings present an effective targeting strategy for the delivery of therapeutics
in clinical management of acute brain injuries.

 A
cute brain injury such as traumatic brain injury (TBI)
disrupts the normal function of the brain and generally
has a poor prognosis for functional recovery and survival.
Termed a ‘silent epidemic’, TBI is a leading cause of mortality and
morbidity in children, teens and active adults from ages 1 to 44,
with an annual incidence of 2.5 million in the US (ref. 1). TBI
can lead to acute and potentially long-lasting neurological
dysfunction, including the development of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy or even Alzheimer’s disease2. A majority of
combat-related TBI cases are additionally complicated by a
penetrating injury to the brain, which is often even more difficult
to manage than non-penetrating injuries3. Despite this substantial
socio-economic impact, TBI treatment is limited to palliative care
and no specific therapies with long-term benefits are available.
The
blood–brain
barrier
(BBB)
is
considered
a
major
impediment to systemic treatment of central nervous system
(CNS) diseases. As a result, localized delivery of drugs within the
brain has been explored, but it has limitations in clinical settings.
In acute brain injury and several cerebrovascular diseases,
including stroke, hypertension and ischaemia, the BBB is
transiently disrupted, which allows extravascular access for
macromolecules and neuroprotective drugs from the systemic
circulation. In fact, the leakage of serum proteins into brain
parenchyma is used to test for BBB integrity4. However, lack of
specific binding of passively accumulating proteins in the injured
area can result in low retention and subsequent washout over
time. Due to this clearance, the therapeutic efficacy of a
systemically administered drug may be greatly limited.
We previously employed in vivo phage display as a powerful
and unbiased method to probe tissues in situ for specific
molecular signatures and discovered homing peptides specific
for different pathologies including tumours, atherosclerotic
plaques and wounds5–7. We reasoned that an acute and
complex event such as TBI is suited for a similar approach as
site-specific molecular changes in protein expression have been
reported8. In this study, we set out to identify peptides that would
recognize specific molecular changes at the sites of traumatic
injury in the brain, and enhance delivery of therapeutic
compounds to such sites. The goal of this approach was to
explore an alternative to local delivery of therapeutics, which is
invasive and can add complications to the injury.
Results
Isolation of brain injury selective peptide by phage display. To
isolate peptides that specifically target brain injury, we inflicted
unilateral puncturing stab wound injuries to the right hemisphere
of adult male mice (Fig. 1a). The penetrating brain injury (PBI)
resulted in rupturing of BBB visualized by selective leakage of
mouse IgG into the brain parenchyma on the injured side
(Fig. 1b). PBI also caused cortical tissue loss, axonal damage and
loss of myelin in the corpus callosum (Supplementary Fig. 1b),
and was accompanied by an increase in glysocaminoglycan
deposition in the injured hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
A T7 phage library that displays on the phage surface 9-amino
acid cyclic peptides with the general composition of CX7C
(C ¼ cysteine; X ¼ any amino acid)7 was intravenously injected
6 h after PBI. Phage was harvested 30 min after injection from the
injury site and the corresponding contralateral hemisphere. Phage
recovery was 10-fold higher from the injured hemisphere than
from the uninjured contralateral side, indicating BBB breakdown
caused by the injury. High-throughput sequencing analysis of the
recovered phage pool revealed a striking enrichment of phage
with the tetra-peptide insert, CAQK, which comprised 22%
(1.28 � 105 p.f.u.) of total recovered phage pool (6.4 � 105 p.f.u.;
Fig. 1c). In addition to the truncated CAQK peptide, full-length
(9aa) cyclic inserts starting with the CAQK motif were also
recovered at lower frequency. A second round of biopanning
increased the CAQK fraction to 83% of the total recovered phage
pool. Interestingly, there was some CAQK phage recovery from
the contralateral side (4%), which suggested a mild impairment
triggered through the contralateral injury (Fig. 1d). No CAQK
was recovered from the brain of a normal mouse injected with the
phage library.
To validate the selectivity of CAQK, a fluoresceinamine
(FAM)-labelled CAQK peptide was chemically synthesized.
In agreement with the phage screening results, the synthetic
FAM-CAQK peptide, when injected intravenously, showed
selective homing to the injured brain on macroscopic examina-
tion (Fig. 2a), and immunohistochemical staining for the
FAM label on the peptide (Fig. 2b). A FAM-labelled control
peptide (CGGK) of the same length and overall charge as CAQK
yielded minimal fluorescent signal. No CAQK accumulation was
observed in healthy brain (Supplementary Fig. 2a) or in other
major tissues (Supplementary Fig. 2b) after 30 min circulation,
except in the kidney, which is the common route for peptide
elimination from the circulation.
To investigate if CAQK targets other types of brain injuries, we
tested peptide homing in a controlled cortical impact injury (CCI)
model. Without penetrating injury, this model mimics cortical
tissue loss, axonal injury, concussion and BBB dysfunction of TBI
(ref. 9). CAQK homed to the injured area in the brain in this
model (Fig. 2i). Binding of CAQK peptide was specific to brain
injuries as no peptide accumulation was detected in perforating
injuries inflicted on the liver and skin (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).
These findings suggest that the binding epitope for CAQK
peptide is specific for sites of brain injury, at least in the models
tested.
CAQK homing to PBI was observed up to 5 days after the
injury (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating a potential window
for effective systemic CAQK-targeting. To visualize peptide
accumulation across the entire brain, whole brains were processed
and made transparent using the CLARITY protocol10 and FAM-
CAQK was visualized in the transparent tissue. FAM-CAQK
signal in the clarified brain was restricted to the injured quadrant
of the brain and was higher than the signal from FAM-CGGK
control (Fig. 2c,d). CAQK accumulated in the region of the
commissural fibres of the corpus callosum and in ring-shaped
cellular structures in the cortex (Fig. 2e). CAQK accumulation led
to a greater retention in the injured brain, as the peptide signal
was visible 3 h after injection whereas the control peptide was
completely washed out (Supplementary Fig. 4).
CAQK binding is specific to sites of brain injury. To further
characterize the binding of CAQK to the injured brain area, we
carried out overlay binding experiments with silver nanoparticles
(AgNPs) conjugated with CAQK (CAQK-nanoparticles (NPs))
on mouse brain sections (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). CAQK-NPs
showed strong binding to the injured brain sections, whereas the
binding of control NPs (CGGK-NP) was negligible (Fig. 2f–h).
Low binding of CAQK-NPs to brain sections from normal
animals was observed, suggesting the presence of low levels of the
peptide binding epitope in normal brain, and its elevation upon
injury. Similar binding pattern of CAQK-NPs was also observed
in the CCI model (Supplementary Fig. 5d,e). Binding specificity
was confirmed by inhibiting the CAQK-NP binding with excess
of free CAQK, which resulted in near complete inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. 5f–h).
CAQK peptide interacts with components of brain ECM. To
identify the potential protein targets of CAQK in the brain tissue,

 we performed mass spectrometry proteomics analysis of proteins
separated from extracts of injured brain by affinity chromato-
graphy on immobilized peptides (Supplementary Fig. 6). Table 1
shows a comparison of proteins in eluates from CAQK and
control (CGGK) columns. Among the large number of proteins
identified, peptides prominent in the CAQK column eluates
belonged primarily to the lectican family of chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycans (CSPGs11). These included versican, associated
proteins tenascin-R and the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link
protein (Hapln). Versican and Hapln4 were exclusively present in
the CAQK column eluates. In normal brain, lectican proteoglycans
form extracellular matrix (ECM) complexes known as perineuronal
nets (PNN)12 around neuronal surfaces and the expression of some
of these lectican proteoglycans is upregulated at sites of CNS
injury13,14.
We confirmed the increase in expression of ECM-associated
CSPGs at sites of brain injury by immunostaining. Versican,
tenascin-R, and the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein
(hapln4), all of which are components of the brain ECM complex
upregulated following an injury, showed high expression in
the injured but not the uninjured hemisphere of the brain
(Supplementary Fig. 7). The signal from intravenously injected
CAQK co-localized with versican, tenascin-R and Hapln4
(Fig. 3a). The peptide signal also co-stained with Wisteria
floribunda agglutinin lectin, a marker for PNNs. At the cellular
level, FAM-CAQK prominently accumulated at mature oligo-
dendrocytes
identified
by
expression
of
the
adenomatous
polyposis coli marker. In several instances, the CAQK binding
pattern followed elongated cells that aligned in the direction of
the callosal axons (see CAQK with adenomatous polyposis coli
and even better with NG2 in Supplementary Fig. 8). Only a few
isolated Olig2 and NG2-positve cells, most likely oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells, bound the peptide. No CAQK was detected in or
around
other
glial
cell
populations,
including
astrocytes
(GFAP þ )
and
microglia
(Iba þ ;
Supplementary
Fig.
8).
Collectively, these data suggest that the binding molecule
(receptor) for CAQK peptide is present in the PNN complex
that is upregulated in brain injuries.
To explore further the association of CAQK with the PNN
complex, in vitro binding of CAQK phage to ECM produced by
U251 human astrocytoma cells was tested. These cells express
high levels of versican and other members of the brain ECM
(ref. 15), which suggests that these cells are activated in culture.
CAQK phage showed significantly higher binding to the U251
ECM than a control phage (Fig. 3b). In addition to providing
further evidence for the ECM binding of CAQK, this result
indicates that CAQK recognizes the human target. This is not
surprising, as peptides are generally not species-specific in their
binding properties16. Binding to this ECM was specific as it was
inhibited with excess free CAQK peptide. Moreover, enzymatic
treatment of the ECM with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase
resulted in loss of versican staining (Supplementary Fig. 9) and
correspondingly reduced CAQK binding (Fig. 3c,d). This suggests
that the epitope for CAQK resides in the complex formed by the
CSPGs, hyaluronic acid and associated proteins.
CAQK as a carrier of diagnostics and therapeutics. The accu-
mulation of the FAM label attached to the CAQK peptide
suggested that CAQK is capable of delivering low molecular
weight compounds into sites of brain injury. To investigate
further
the
translational
potential
of
the
CAQK-targeting
approach, we first examined CAQK-mediated delivery to brain
injury of NPs as a model of both an imaging agent and a drug
carrier. CAQK conjugated, silver NPs (mean diameter—20 nm),
administered
intravenously,
showed
significantly
greater
accumulation
in
injured
brain
tissue
than

 (Supplementary Fig. 10). The localization of CAQK-NPs was in
excellent agreement with the localization of the free CAQK
peptide (Fig. 2b,e). Thus, CAQK targeted NPs mimic the homing
ability of the free peptide.
To demonstrate the versatility of CAQK system, we tested
delivery of oligonucleotides loaded into porous silicon NPs
(PSiNPs) as a carrier17. Our proof of concept approach was to
silence local expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)
systemically expressed in transgenic mice from the CAG
promoter18. We simulated therapeutic oligonucleotides by using
short interfering RNA (siRNA) against GFP loaded in CAQK
conjugated PSiNPs (Supplementary Fig. 11a–d). PSiNPs were
intravenously injected into the GFP mice with PBI and visualized
by time-gated luminescence imaging19,20 allowing quantification
of their accumulation in the excised brains. The imaging showed
that CAQK-PSiNPs accumulated in the injuries at markedly
higher (35 fold) levels than PSiNPs coated with a control peptide
(Fig. 4b). Other tissues, including regions of the brain outside the
injury area, showed no significant difference in the accumulation
of CAQK and control PSiNPs (Fig. 4c). Confocal microscopy on
transverse cortical sections from mice injected with CAQK-
PSiNP-siGFP exhibited a large void of GFP expression at the
injury site, whereas brains from mice treated with control NPs did
not differ from untreated brains (Fig. 4d). We observed 70%
silencing of GFP expression by targeting siGFP, whereas minimal
silencing was observed with untargeted siGFP and other controls.
This silencing was visible across the entire injury and not just in a
particular cell type presumably due to the gradual degradation of
PSiNP and release of the siGFP over time in the injury. The gene
silencing was specific for brain injury, as GFP expression
remained unaltered in normal brains or in other major tissues
(Supplementary Fig. 11e).
Lastly, to examine CAQK recognition of human brain injury,
we tested ex vivo binding of CAQK-conjugated silver NPs on
human cortical sections obtained from a head trauma patient.
The CAQK-NPs showed intense binding to the injured brain
sections from the cortex and the corpus callosum areas, whereas
binding to normal brain sections was minimal (Fig. 5a). Similar to
the mouse brains, we observed significant elevation in expression
of versican and hapln4 in injured brain than in normal brain by
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5b). These findings confirm CAQK
binding to human target and support its potential utility for
therapeutic application in humans.
Discussion
We describe a 4-amino acid peptide that selectively recognizes
brain injuries and accumulates at the sites of injury. We show that
this peptide, CAQK, enhances the accumulation of systemically
administered payloads with chemistries ranging in size from a
drug-sized molecule to nanoparticles, and incorporating a variety
of imaging and therapeutic functions of potential utility in clinical
management of brain injuries. Importantly, the target of this
delivery system is expressed both in mouse and human brain
injuries.
We used two mouse models in this study. The PBI model
mimics gunshot or shrapnel wounds, such as the ones sustained
by a warfighter. The blunt cortical impact model more generally
reproduces the features of severe TBI. CAQK recognized the
injuries in both models, suggesting broad utility across acute
brain injuries. The fact that the contralateral hemisphere, unlike
normal brain, accumulated some CAQK phage suggests that less
severe injuries than the ones we used may also be targeted with
CAQK. It remains to be tested whether CAQK also homes to
spinal cord injuries, or even demyelinating CNS lesions such as in
multiple sclerosis. Importantly, we also show that CAQK
recognizes its target in cultured human cells and in cortical
sections of injured human brain.
The phage screening in this study revealed a novel aspect of the
in vivo screening; whereas the previous screens have probed
the vasculature of the target tissue, even in the brain21–23, the
compromised BBB integrity in brain injury allowed the phage to
probe the extravascular brain tissue. Moreover, the high-
throughput sequencing of the peptide-encoding inserts in the
phage
genome
provided
a
technical
improvement
to
the
screening. One round of selection, as opposed to repeated
rounds as previously done, provided a fingerprint of over 200,000
peptide sequences, revealing a striking enrichment of phage
displaying the CAQK peptide sequence. Although a cyclic phage
library was used, a library of this design contains a minority of
linear peptides because stop codons occur within the random
insert causing truncation of the cyclic peptide. Additionally,
mutations may also change the structure of the peptide. Thus,
peptides that do not conform to the general structure of the
library are commonly encountered in phage screening24,25. The
recovery of cyclic peptides containing the CAQK motif, in
addition to the dominant linear CAQK peptide, suggests that
CAQK motif is also active in the context of a cyclic peptide.
BBB disruption is an important contributor to secondary injury
following TBI, and therapies to restore BBB functionality
are under investigation for neuroprotection26. The localized
permeability of BBB and the delayed onset of secondary injury
provide a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention.
The literature27 and our results suggest the duration of the BBB
impairment is at least up to 5 days. Within this time window,
affinity ligand-based (synaphic) targeting can be an effective drug
delivery
approach;
our
results
show
as
high
as
35-fold
enhancement in the accumulation of systemically administered
imaging agents and therapeutics at and around the site of injury.
The concentrating effect of synaphic targeting is likely
accounted for by two factors: the peptide can access and bind
to its target that allows accumulation of the payload and causes
retention at the site of injury. The impairment of the BBB allows
all circulating substances to enter the injury area. And, if the
peptide receptor is sufficiently abundant relative to the amount of
the peptide-drug conjugate used, the binding of the peptide to the
receptor can drive payload accumulation beyond what is caused
by passive leakage28. This is the case in brain injury, where the
components of the CSPG complex are overexpressed upon an

 injury12 (Supplementary Fig. 7). The second important factor
is the retention effect. As the drug concentration decreases
in circulation, the drug is washed out of the injury area29.
Peptide binding to its target can retain the drug in the
injured
microenvironment
by
minimizing
this
washout
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, the targeting approach in
this work encompasses the critical period of healing, which
may provide a more lasting therapeutic effect, at least when
the
therapeutic
action
is
long-acting.
Notably,
some
oligonucleotides, which is one of the types of drugs we
successfully delivered in this work, have been shown to remain
active for weeks in tissues30.
CNS injury results in formation of a CSPG-rich glial scar,
which is a major barrier to regeneration31. Strategies to prevent
the accumulation of CSPGs in injury or dissolve existing deposits
have been explored14. However, site-specific delivery of the active
compounds has been a challenge. The intrinsic affinity of CAQK
peptide for CSPG rich areas in injured brain could be effective in
directing a CSPG-reducing payload, such as the chondroitinase
ABC
enzyme32.
Having
successfully
targeted
nanoparticle
payload into brain injuries, we would expect to accomplish the
same with proteins, such as chondroitinase. The ability of the
present approach to concentrate a payload at the site of brain
injury is important for reducing toxicity at off-target sites.
An example of an existing therapeutic agent that would benefit
from reduced toxicity is the neuroprotective agent brain-derived
neurotrophic factor33. It has side effects in the normal brain,
which CAQK does not target. Thus, our targeting approach has

 the potential of converting agents with unfavourable pharmaco-
kinetic profile into efficient drugs.
Oligonucleotide-based drugs are a new class of drugs with great
potential but hampered by delivery problems in vivo. An example
is siRNA, a therapeutic modality with the desired characteristics
of specificity and potency, but particularly difficult to deliver
through systemic circulation. Previous studies on siRNA therapy
of brain injuries have either used direct injection into the CNS
space or silenced a target present in the brain endothelial cells34.
The CAQK-mediated targeted delivery of siRNA reported here
provides the first evidence of delivery of active siRNA into injured
brain tissue from systemic circulation. A number of targets for
gene silencing (such as Bcl-2 family proteins, caspases, histone
deacetylases (HDAC) and phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN)) have been suggested for brain injury34. Here, CAQK-
mediated siRNA delivery was accomplished by using porous
nanoparticles as a carrier. Thus, these results also open up brain
injuries for nanomedicine-based therapeutic approaches.
The discovery of CAQK has translational potential because it
can direct a payload from systemic circulation to the site of acute
brain injury and retain it there for therapeutically relevant
timescales. This approach provides an alternative to local delivery,
which is invasive and can add complications to the injury.
Moreover, the approach could be transferable to human patients,
because CAQK recognizes the human target molecule and because
the expression of the target appears to be elevated in injured
human brain tissues in the same way it is in the mouse injuries.
Methods
Brain injury models. All animal experiments were conducted under an approved
protocol of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sanford Burnham
Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. Eight- to ten-week-old male BL6 mice were
anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane (Aerrane; Baxter, UK) in 70% N2O and 30% O2,
and positioned in a stereotaxic frame. Using a head restraint, a 5-mm craniotomy
was made using a portable drill and a trephine over the right parietotemporal
cortex and the bone flap was removed. PBI model was used as described35,36. Nine
needle punctures using a 21G needle were made 3 mm deep according to a 3 � 3
grid, spaced 1 mm in width and 1 mm in height. For TBI, a CCI model was used as
described37. Mice were subjected to CCI using the benchmark stereotaxic impactor
(Impact One; myNeuroLab.com) with the actuator part mounted directly on the
stereotaxic instrument. The impactor (3 mm in diameter) tip accelerated down to
the 1.0 mm distance, reaching the preset velocity of 3 m s � 1, and the applied
electromagnetic force remained there for the dwell time of 85 ms, and then
retracted automatically. The contact sensor indicated the exact point of contact for

 reproducible results. In both models, facemask anaesthesia (1–2% isoflurane in
70%/30% nitrous oxide/oxygen) was used during the entire procedure and
afterwards, the scalp was closed with sutures, anaesthesia discontinued and mice
were administered buprenorphine i.p. for pain control. For the first 2 h after injury,
mice were closely monitored in their cages.
In vivo phage display. Six hours after brain injury, mice were intravenously
injected with 1e10 p.f.u. of a CX7C naı
¨ve phage library in 100 ml of PBS. The library
was allowed to circulate for 30 min, after which mice were anaesthetized with 2.5%
avertin and perfused with PBS intracardially. Brains were extracted, and the tissue
surrounding the injury and the corresponding region from the contralateral side
was isolated. Tissues were homogenized in LB-NP 40 (1%) and phage was
processed as described7. Briefly, recovered phages were titered and amplified in
E. coli BLT5403 and purified for input for second round of screening. The colonies
recovered from second round were sequenced using Sanger sequencing (Eton
biosciences, San Diego, USA). Alternatively, after first round, the phages in the
lysate were rescued by amplification in E. coli and peptide-encoding portion of the
phage genome was sequenced using Ion Torrent high-throughput sequencing.
Peptide synthesis and coupling. The peptides were synthesized on a microwave-
assisted automated peptide synthesizer (Liberty; CEM, Matthews, NC) following
Fmoc/t-Bu (Fmoc:Fluorenyl methoxy carbonyl, t-Bu: tertiary-butyl) strategy on rink
amide resin with HBTU (N,N,N0,N0-Tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)uranium
hexafluorophosphate (OR) O-(Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N0,N0-tetramethyluronium hex-
afluorophosphate) activator, collidine activator base and 5% piperazine for deprotection.
Fluorescein and biotin tags were incorporated during synthesis at the N-terminus of the
sequence. Cleavage using a 95% trifluoro acetic acid followed by purification gave
peptides with 490% purity. Peptides were lyophilized and stored at � 20�C.
Animal experiments for skin and liver injury. For liver injury model, animals
were anaesthetized and a midline laparotomy was performed by first cutting the
skin, bluntly separating the muscle and then lifting the peritoneum with sterile
forceps. A small hole was made into the lifted peritoneum and the hole was
carefully expanded (without damage to the internal organs) in both directions
along the midline. Once good exposure to liver was obtained, the artery was
clamped (Roboz surgical (RS-5420)) and excision wound 2 mm in depth on the
surface of one of the livers lobes was made. The clamp was removed from the artery
allowing blood to flow. The incisions on peritoneum, muscle and skin were closed.
The mice were then placed on a heating pad in their cage and monitored closely
until they recovered from anaesthesia.
For skin wounds, induction of anaesthesia was done and the skin was cleaned
with alcohol and betadine and four 6- or 8-mm skin biopsies were made to
the back skin of the mouse. None of the skin wounds were covered or sutured
closed to guarantee optimal and infection-free healing. To test peptide homing,
FAM-labelled peptide (50 nmoles) was injected i.v. 6 h after injury and allowed to
circulate for 30 min. Mice were perfused intracardially with saline and organs were
isolated and analysed by immunostaining.
Homing studies and tissue sections. Animals were intravenously injected, 6 h
after injury, with 50 nmoles of peptide dissolved in PBS, and allowed to circulate
for 30 min. Mice were perfused intracardially with saline and organs were isolated
and imaged using the Illumatool Bright Light System LT-9900 (Lightools
Research). Brains and organs were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at pH 7.4
overnight, washed with PBS and placed in graded sucrose solutions overnight
before optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) embedding. Ten-micro-
metre-thick sections were cut and analysed by immunofluorescence. For a com-
plete histological analysis, sections were stained with the Movat pentachrome kit
(American Mastertech Inc.) following the manufacturers instructions.
Immunofluorescence. Frozen sections were permeabilized using PBS-Triton
(0.2%), blocking was carried out using 5% blocking buffer: 5% bovine serum
albumin, 1% goat serum, 1% donkey serum in PBS-T. Primary antibodies were
incubated in diluted (1%) blocking buffer overnight at dilutions 1/100 or 1/200 at
4 �C, washed with PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1/200 or
1/500 in 1% diluted buffer for 1 h at room temperature, subsequently washed with
PBS-T, counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 1 mg ml � 1 in PBS for
5 min, washed with PBS, mounted using mounting media (Vector Biolabs) and
imaged on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM-710). Staining was done using the
following antibodies and reagents: Fluorescein (Invitrogen A889), Versican
(abcam, ab177480), hapln4 (R&D systems, AF4085), tenascin0-R (R&D systems,
AF3865), Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (Sigma, L1516), NG2 and olig2 (gift from
Dr William Stallcup at SBPMDI), GFAP (Dako, Z0334) and MBP (Millipore -
MAB386).
CLARITY imaging of brain. CLARITY was performed on freshly extracted brain
tissues as described10. Briefly, mice were intravenously injected with FAM-labelled
peptides 6 h after brain injury. After 30-minute circulation, mice were intracardially
perfused with PBS and hydrogel solution (Acrylamide (4%), bis (0.05%), VA-044
Initiator (0.25%), paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS). Following perfusion, the tissues
were incubated in the hydrogel solution at 4 �C for 2–3 days. At UCSD
Neuroscience Core and Light Microscopy Facility the tissues were then degased
with nitrogen and incubated at 37 �C for 3–4 h for polymerization. Samples were
then passively cleared in 4% SDS solution for B4 weeks until the tissue became
transparent. Finally, the samples were washed in PBS-T for 2 days and incubated in
gradient glycerol solutions: 30, 50 and 80%, B1 day each and stored in 80%
glycerol at room temperature until imaged on a confocal microscope (Leica SP5).
Affinity chromatography and proteomics. For identifying CAQK binding
proteins, mouse brains with brain injury were collected 6 h after injury. Using
liquid nitrogen, the brains were crushed and ground into powder using a mortar
and pestle. Next, brain tissue was lysed in PBS containing 200 mM n-octyl-beta-D-
glucopyranoside and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) as described38. The cleared
lysate was loaded on to CAQK or control peptide (CGGK) coated Sulfolink-agarose
beads (Pierce, Waltham, MA) and incubated at 4 �C for 3–4 h. The column was
washed with wash buffer (75 mM octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and protease
inhibitor cocktail in PBS) followed by washing with 0.5 mM control peptide in
wash buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The bound proteins were
eluted with 2 mM-free CAQK peptide. The eluted factions were pooled, their
protein concentration determined by using bicinchoninic acid protein assay
(Thermo Fischer) and the samples were digested using the filter-aided sample
preparation method39. Finally, the digested samples were desalted, dried and
subjected to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis at the
Proteomics Core facility of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery
Institute. All mass spectra were analysed with MaxQuant software version 1.5.0.25.
The MS/MS spectra were searched against the Mus musculus Uniprot protein
sequence database (version July 2014).
Phage binding to ECM. Cells grown as confluent monolayer in a 96-well plate
were gently removed by a enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and plates blocked with 200 ml of 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS
with 0.005% T20 for 1 h at 37 �C. Phage was incubated in the plate at 4 �C for
overnight and unbound phage was removed by washing three times with 200 ml of
PBST. The bound phage was detected by incubating with an in-house generated
anti-T7 phage antibody for 1 h at 4 �C. Following washing, horseradish peroxidase-
labelled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 1:1,000 in PBS, and 100 ml was
added to the wells, followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature and
washing three times. Next, 100 ml of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD)
silver and gold substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the wells and incubated at
room temperature until visible colour was observed (o30 min). Adding 50 ml of
1 M H2SO4 stopped the reaction and the plate was read at 495 nm (FlexStation 3
Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For enzymatic digestion,
chondroitinase ABC (2 U ml � 1, Sigma) or hyaluronidase (500 U ml � 1) was added
to the plate for 3 h at 37 �C. The plate was then washed with PBST three times
before incubation with phage.
Silver nanoparticles synthesis and targeting. AgNPs with PEG coating and
peptide functionality were prepared as reported previously with some modifica-
tions40. AgNPs of B20 nm diameter were synthesized by tannic acid reduction of
silver nitrate in citrate solution41. AgNO3 (252 mg) dissolved in 2.5 l water was
stirred and heated to 60 �C, then 50 ml water containing tannic acid (6.1 mg) and
trisodium citrate dihydrate (1 g) was added. After 3 min, the solution was brought
to a boil for 20 min. Final optical density at 400 nm was B10. Lipoic PEG amine
(51.9 mg, 3,400 g mol � 1, Nanocs) was reduced in 84 mM tris-carboxylethyl
phosphine (TCEP pH 7.0, Sigma) in 4.1 ml water for 3 h. AgNPs were portioned to
500 ml and heated to 50 �C, then lipoic PEG amine solution (0.79 ml) was added,
followed by 0.25 ml 0.5 M TCEP. After 30 min, the solution was cooled to room
temperature. Tween 20 (T20, 0.25 ml and 10% in water) and 20 ml 2 M NaCl were
added, and incubated overnight at 4 �C. AgNPs were concentrated 50-fold and
purified by stirred cell (Millipore) with a 100 kDa membrane into 0.5 � PBS with
0.005% T20 and 5 mM TCEP, then passivated with 0.03 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine
methyl ester (Sigma), and 0.10 mM tetracysteine peptide (acetyl-CCPGCC-amide,
LifeTein), washed at 20 kRCF and resuspended at 300 OD at 405nm in 0.05 M
phosphate buffer with 0.005% T20. This product could be stored at least 6 months
at 4 �C. A bifunctional linker was reacted with the amine to introduce maleimide
groups (NHS-PEG-Mal, 5 kDa JenKem USA), washed by centrifugation, and
reacted with cysteine peptide (FAM-x-CAQK-NH2) or a control thiol-containing
peptide, or L-cysteine (Sigma). The product was washed in PBS with 0.005% T20
(PBST), filtered (0.22 mm), with a typical final optical density of 150 at the Ag
plasmon peak of 400 nm. We estimated this concentration to be B30 nM in AgNPs
using an extinction coefficient of 5 � 109 M � 1 cm � 1 for spherical silver obtained
from ref. 42. Fixed tissue sections were stained for Ag using Silver Enhance
(Thermo Fischer), counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Sigma) and mounted in
DPX (Sigma). AgNP signal in tissue sections was quantified by Image J software by
isolating grey pixels that represent Ag. For animal experiments, 35 nM of
peptide-conjugated AgNPs were injected intravenously in mice 6 h after PBI.
The particles were allowed to circulate for 2 h, and the mice were perfused and the

 brains were isolated. Silver accumulation in the brain was analysed by silver
staining autometallography with counterstaining with nuclear fast red (Sigma).
Tissue section overlay of silver nanoparticles. Overlay experiments to analyse
ex vivo binding were carried out on frozen brain tissue sections following the same
protocol for immunofluorescence staining described above taking the nanoparticles
as if they were the primary antibody and using no secondary antibody. Peptide-
coated AgNPs in PBS-T at a 1nM concentration were used and the incubation time
was 1 h at 37 �C. Sections were imaged with fluorescent microscopy by looking at
intrinsic emission from the FAM tag on the peptide.
Synthesis and functionalization of porous silicon nanoparticles PSiNPs.
Single-crystalline highly doped p-type silicon wafers (B1 mO cm resistivity,
o1004 polished, boron-doped) were purchased from Virginia Semiconductor,
Inc. PSiNPs were prepared by electrochemical perforation etching of the silicon
wafers, as described previously43. Briefly, the silicon wafer was anodically etched in
an electrolyte consisting of 3:1 (by volume) of 48% aqueous HF:ethanol. Etching
was carried out in a Teflon etch cell that exposed the polished silicon wafer surface,
using a platinum coil counter electrode. The silicon wafer was contacted on the
backside with a strip of aluminium foil. The etching waveform consisted of a square
wave in which a lower current density of 50 mA cm � 2 was applied for 1.8 s,
followed by a higher current density of 400 mA cm � 2 for 0.36 s. This waveform
was repeated for 140 cycles, generating a perforated porous silicon film with
alternating layers of high and low porosity. The resulting porous nanostructure was
removed from the silicon substrate by applying a current density of 3.7 mA cm � 2
for 250 s in an electrolyte consisting of 1:30 (by volume) of 48% aqueous
HF:ethanol. The free-standing porous silicon films were then fractured to the
desired size (nominally 150 nm) by ultrasonication, and the resulting nanoparticles
were oxidized by immersion in aqueous borax solution to activate
photoluminescence44.
Peptide conjugation and siGFP loading to PSiNPs. An aliquot of PSiNPs
(2mgml� 1 in ethanol) was mixed with 20ml of 3-(ethoxydimethyl)-propylamine silane
by vortex overnight at room temperature. The amine-terminated nanoparticles were
rinsed three times with ethanol and then further reacted with 1ml of succinimidyl
carboxy methyl ester-polyethylene glycol-maleimide (10mgml� 1 in ethanol) for 2h,
followed by rinsing with ethanol and deionized water (three times each). An aqueous
solution of the peptides (500ml, 1mgml� 1, either CAQK or control) was added to the
resulting nanoparticles and mixed by vortexing for 2h to conjugate the peptide via the
free cysteine residue at the terminal group of the peptide45. Peptide conjugation was
confirmed by measuring fluorescence of a FAM tagged to the peptide. The amount
of peptide on nanoparticles was estimated to be B70nmolmg� 1 (peptide/PSiNPs).
The oligonucleotide siGFP was electrostatically loaded to the positively charged porous
inner structure of the nanoparticles by mixing with siRNA solution (200mM) at 4�C for
24h. The loading amount of siGFP wasB7wt% (siGFP/PSiNP), which was determined
by measuring absorbance at 260nm. Note that the PEG linkers were attached only
onto the outer surface (not the inside pores) of PSiNPs due to their large molecular
weight and long-chain length relative to the pore size (B12 nm). 3-(ethoxydimethyl)-
propylamine silane and succinimidyl carboxy methyl ester-polyethylene glycol-
maleimide (SCM-PEG-Mal, MW 5000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
Laysan Bio, respectively, and used as received without further purification. RNase-free
water was purchased from Thermo Fischer (Carlsbad, CA). Small interfering RNA
against GFP (siGFP) was purchased from Dharmacon. The sequences for the sense and
antisense strands of siGFP are: 50-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACCdTdT-30 (sense)
and 50- UGCGCUCCUGGACGUAGCCTTdTdT-30 (antisense).
Characterization of PSiNPs. Transmission electron microscope images were
obtained on JEOL-1200 EX II operating at 120 kV. Dynamic light scattering (DLS,
Zetasizer ZS 90, Malvern Instruments) was used to determine the hydrodynamic
size and Zeta potential of the nanoparticles. Photoluminescence and fluorescence
spectra were obtained using a QE pro spectrometer (Ocean Optics). Concentration
of siRNA was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a spectro-
meter (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) based on the OD260 standard
curve of siRNA.
In vivo siRNA targeting and analysis. Transgenic CAG-GFP mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock #006567). Brain injuries were done
as described above. Peptide-conjugated and siRNA-loaded PSiNPs (300 mg) were
administered twice via tail-vein injections at 6 and 24 h post injury (n ¼ 3). Three
days after injury, mice were perfused, organs harvested and fixed for downstream
analysis. The tissues were imaged under a time-gated imaging set-up and the GFP
expression was analysed by researchers blinded to the experimental groups.
Gated luminescence imaging of silicon nanoparticles (GLISiN). Gated
luminescence images were acquired from a custom-built time-domain imaging
system using an intensified CCD camera (iSTAR 334 T, Andor Technology Ltd.),
as reported19. A tunable laser consisting of a tripled Nd:YAG-pumped optical
parametric oscillator (Opolette 355, Opotek Inc.) were used as an excitation source
at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, which was synchronized and triggered with the CCD.
The Andor SOLIS software was used to control time delays and acquisition
conditions and to analyse signal-to-noise ratio. Mouse tissues were placed on a
black polystyrene plate, and bright field (under ambient light) and gated
luminescence (under excitation with pulsed laser, lex ¼ 410 nm) images were taken.
Human tissue experiments. Formalin-fixed human brain tissues were obtained
from the Brain Tissue Repository maintained by the Center for Neuroscience &
Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) at the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences (USU) in Bethesda, MD. The TBI case is from a patient with
moderate TBI (automobile accident) who died at age 72. The control case is from a
63-year-old male without any neurologic diagnosis or any signs of TBI on detailed
neuropathologic evaluation. Fixed tissues were cryopreserved and sectioned for
overlay binding with AgNPs as described above. For immunohistochemistry,
an antigen retrieval step was done before incubation with anti-hapln4 and
anti-versican antibodies.
Statistical analysis. All data represents mean value±s.e.m. All the significance
analysis was done using Statistica 8.0 software, using one-way ANOVA or
two-tailed heteroscedastic Student’s t test. The details of the statistical tests
carried out are indicated in respective figure legends.
