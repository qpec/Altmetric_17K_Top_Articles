BACKGROUND
Long-term trends in excess risk of death and cardiovascular outcomes have not 
been extensively studied in persons with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.
METHODS
We included patients registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Register from 
1998 through 2012 and followed them through 2014. Trends in deaths and cardio-
vascular events were estimated with Cox regression and standardized incidence 
rates. For each patient, controls who were matched for age, sex, and county were 
randomly selected from the general population.
RESULTS
Among patients with type 1 diabetes, absolute changes during the study period in 
the incidence rates of sentinel outcomes per 10,000 person-years were as follows: 
death from any cause, −31.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], −56.1 to −6.7); death 
from cardiovascular disease, −26.0 (95% CI, −42.6 to −9.4); death from coronary 
heart disease, −21.7 (95% CI, −37.1 to −6.4); and hospitalization for cardiovascular 
disease, −45.7 (95% CI, −71.4 to −20.1). Absolute changes per 10,000 person-years 
among patients with type 2 diabetes were as follows: death from any cause, −69.6 
(95% CI, −95.9 to −43.2); death from cardiovascular disease, −110.0 (95% CI, 
−128.9 to −91.1); death from coronary heart disease, −91.9 (95% CI, −108.9 to −75.0); 
and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, −203.6 (95% CI, −230.9 to −176.3). 
Patients with type 1 diabetes had roughly 40% greater reduction in cardiovascular 
outcomes than controls, and patients with type 2 diabetes had roughly 20% 
greater reduction than controls. Reductions in fatal outcomes were similar in pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes and controls, whereas patients with type 2 diabetes had 
smaller reductions in fatal outcomes than controls.
CONCLUSIONS
In Sweden from 1998 through 2014, mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular 
outcomes declined substantially among persons with diabetes, although fatal out-
comes declined less among those with type 2 diabetes than among controls.

iabetes mellitus is a complex and 
heterogeneous group of chronic meta-
bolic diseases that are characterized by 
hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes occurs predomi-
nantly in young people (diagnosis at 30 years of 
age or younger) and is generally thought to be 
precipitated by an immune-associated destruc-
tion of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, 
leading to insulin deficiency and an absolute 
need for exogenous insulin replacement.1 Type 2 
diabetes is a progressive metabolic disease that 
is characterized by insulin resistance and even-
tual functional failure of pancreatic beta cells.2 
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been in-
creasing dramatically over the past few decades,3 
with projections of an even greater growth over 
coming decades.4
Landmark studies such as the Diabetes Con-
trol and Complications Trial, United Kingdom 
Prospective Diabetes Study, Collaborative Atorva-
statin Diabetes Study, and several others have 
shown the importance of glucose-lowering ther-
apy, statin use, blood-pressure control, and multi-
factorial intervention in reducing the risk of 
cardiovascular outcomes among patients with 
diabetes.5-18 These trial results and the clinical 
application of their findings, along with lifestyle 
interventions (including smoking cessation), are 
likely to have improved outcomes in patients with 
diabetes during the past two decades. We set out 
to investigate the long-term trends (1998 through 
2014) in all-cause mortality and the incidence of 
major diabetes-related cardiovascular complica-
tions, as compared with contemporary trends in 
the general population.
Methods
Study Design and Support
The study was supported by the Swedish Asso-
ciation of Local Authorities and Regions and 
other nonprofit agencies; no industry support 
was provided. The ethics review board at the Uni-
versity of Gothenburg approved the study.
Data Sources
The Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), 
initiated in 1996, has been described previous-
ly.19,20 This registry includes information on risk 
factors, complications of diabetes, and medica-
tions for patients 18 years of age or older. Each 
patient provides informed consent (oral or writ-
ten) for inclusion in the register, and virtually all 
patients in Sweden with diabetes are included.21 
Persons with at least one observation in the NDR 
between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2012, 
were included in the study.
Type 1 diabetes was defined according to epi-
demiologic criteria: treatment with insulin and 
diagnosis at 30 years of age or younger. Type 2 
diabetes was also defined according to epidemio-
logic criteria: treatment with diet, with or with-
out the use of oral antihyperglycemic agents, or 
treatment with insulin, with or without the use 
of oral antihyperglycemic agents; the latter cate-
gory applied only to patients who were 40 years 
of age or older at the time of diabetes diagnosis.
At the time of the first registration of each 
person with diabetes in the NDR, controls, ran-
domly selected from the general population, were 
identified who were matched for age, sex, and 
county.20,22 Separate controls were selected for the 
cohort with type 1 diabetes and the cohort with 
type 2 diabetes; no person served as a control in 
both analyses. Information with respect to car-
diovascular outcomes and deaths was retrieved 
from the Swedish Inpatient Registry and the 
Swedish Cause of Death Registry. Data linkage 
is virtually complete owing to the use of unique 
personal identification numbers, which are as-
signed to all Swedes at birth or at the time of 
immigration.
Outcomes
The outcomes that we assessed included death 
from any cause, acute myocardial infarction, 
coronary heart disease, all cardiovascular disease, 
stroke, and heart failure. The composite outcome 
of cardiovascular disease was defined as the first 
occurrence of acute myocardial infarction or 
stroke. Outcomes were identified in hospital 
discharge records with the use of codes in the 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision 
and 10th Revision. The specific codes are listed in 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The last date for inclusion in the current 
analysis cohort was December 31, 2012. Patients 
were followed until December 31, 2013, for all 
outcomes, except for death from any cause, for 
which follow-up ended on December 31, 2014.
Statistical Analysis
Follow-up was stratified according to seven 
2-year periods for all outcomes, except for death 
from any cause, for which we used eight periods

Mortality and Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes
(with the final period including only 1 year). 
Incidence rates for each time period were calcu-
lated for each outcome of interest; the rates were 
standardized to the age and sex distribution 
from the initial time period. For the incidence 
analyses, each person with diabetes was matched 
with five controls who were randomly selected 
from the general population. Numerators were 
the number of first events in a particular time 
period, and denominators were the number of 
persons at risk during the same time period. 
Incidence rates are expressed as the number of 
events per 10,000 person-years of observation.
Data on persons who had a nonfatal out-
come, even before inclusion in the NDR, were 
censored at the time of the outcome, and per-
sons with that outcome were not included in the 
numerator or denominator for that specific out-
come but could be included in the numerator 
and denominator for fatal and other nonfatal 
outcomes. Data on persons who died were cen-
sored at the time of death. If a study participant 
had a nonfatal cardiovascular event but died 
within the first 30 days after that event, the 
participant was considered to have had a fatal 
outcome.
We also constructed Cox regression models 
for all outcomes to compare the change in event 
rates over time between patients with diabetes 
and matched controls. For the regression mod-
els, each person with type 1 diabetes along with 
the five matched controls were followed from 
the index date (first observation in the NDR) 
until an event or appropriate censoring. Persons 
with type 2 diabetes were matched with one 
control only. The regression models included 
sex, time-updated age categories, time period, 
and a “group” variable denoting patient or con-
trol. Changes in the rates of individual and 
composite outcomes over a 10-year period were 
assessed separately for patients with diabetes 
and for controls. In order to compare differences 
in the change in event rates over time between 
patients and controls, we introduced terms in 
the models for the interaction of group with 
each of the main effects, including time period. 
The test for the interaction between time period 
and group yielded a coefficient that showed the 
relative trend difference between patients and 
controls. The coefficient was raised to the fifth 
power, which yielded a hazard ratio for a period 
of 10 years (each time period includes 2 years). 
Thus, the Cox regression estimated the differ-
ence between patients and controls over a period 
of 10 years. Estimates significantly above 1.0 
were interpreted as a greater event-rate reduction 
among patients with diabetes than among con-
trols.
Because of the exploratory nature of this 
study, two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were 
considered to indicate statistical significance. 
No adjustments were made for multiple com-
parisons. All analyses were performed with the 
use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Study Population
A total of 36,869 patients with type 1 diabetes 
and 457,473 patients with type 2 diabetes were 
included, along with matched controls for each 
diabetes cohort. Baseline characteristics of the 
patients with type 1 diabetes are presented in 
Table 1, and those of the patients with type 2 
diabetes are shown in Table 2. The mean age at 
entry was 35.3 years among people with type 1 
diabetes and 65.2 years among people with type 
2 diabetes. The mean glycated hemoglobin level 
was 8.2% (66.0 mmol per mole) in patients with 
type 1 diabetes and 7.1% (54.5 mmol per mole) 
in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mean dura-
tion of diabetes before entry into the registry 
was 20.0 years among patients with type 1 dia-
betes and 5.7 years among patients with type 2 
diabetes. As expected, histories of acute myocar-
dial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, 
heart failure, amputation, and end-stage kidney 
disease were more frequent among patients with 
diabetes than among controls. The mean duration 
of follow-up was 11.2 years for patients with 
type 1 diabetes and 6.5 years for patients with 
type 2 diabetes.
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Over a median of 15 years of observation, the 
mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level at the 
time of initial registry enrollment changed from 
66.2 to 68.4 mmol per mole in patients with type 
1 diabetes and from 60.2 to 56.7 mmol per mole 
in patients with type 2 diabetes. In both groups, 
significant decreases were observed in levels of 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and 
systolic blood pressure, the prevalence of macro-
albuminuria, and the frequency of prescription 
of statins and antihypertensive medications. Base-
line characteristics according to period of regis-

the Supplementary Appendix. Overall group char-
acteristics according to period of clinic evalua-
tion on the basis of all visits for each time period 
are shown in Tables S4 and S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Mortality
The absolute change in all-cause mortality among 
patients with type 1 diabetes from 1998 to 2014 
was −31.4 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 
−56.1 to −6.7) per 10,000 person-years. The cor-
responding change among matched controls 
was −13.9 deaths (95% CI, −20.1 to −7.7) per 
10,000 person-years (Fig. 1A, and Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The mortality rate de-
clined by 29% in the group with type 1 diabetes 
(hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.78) and by 
23% in controls (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.72 
to 0.83) (Table 3). The ratio of hazard ratios for 
patients with type 1 diabetes as compared with 
controls indicated that the change in all-cause 
mortality among patients with type 1 diabetes 
did not differ significantly from the change 
among controls (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.99 
to 1.18; P 
= 
0.09) (Table 3).
From 1998 to 2014, all-cause mortality among 
patients with type 2 diabetes changed by −69.6 
deaths (95% CI, −95.9 to −43.2) per 10,000 person-
years (Fig. 2A, and Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), with a relative event-rate reduc-
tion over the study period of 21% (hazard ratio, 
0.79; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.80) (Table 3). The corre-
sponding absolute change in all-cause mortality 
among matched controls was −134.7 deaths 
(95% CI, −145.2 to −124.1) per 10,000 person-
years, with a relative event-rate reduction of 31% 
(hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.70). The 
decline in the all-cause mortality rate was 13% 
greater among controls than among patients 
with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 
0.85 to 0.89; P<0.001).
With respect to death from cardiovascular 
disease, the absolute change among patients with 
type 1 diabetes was −26.0 cases (95% CI, −42.6 
to −9.4) per 10,000 person-years (Fig. 1B, and 
Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
relative event-rate reduction was 42% (hazard 
ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.68) among patients 
with type 1 diabetes and 38% (hazard ratio, 0.62; 
95% CI, 0.53 to 0.72) among controls. There was 
a nonsignificant difference between patients with 
type 1 diabetes and controls for this outcome 
(hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.26; P 
= 
0.53) 
(Table 3).
The change in the incidence of death from 
cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 
diabetes was −110.0 cases (95% CI, −128.9 to

−91.1) per 10,000 person-years (Fig. 2B, and Table 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The corre-
sponding event-rate reduction was 46% (hazard 
ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.55). There was a 6% 
greater reduction in death from cardiovascular 
disease among controls than among patients 
with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 
0.90 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.004) (Table 3).
The results for death from coronary heart dis-
ease were broadly similar to those for death from 
cardiovascular disease. The absolute change was 
−21.7 deaths (95% CI, −37.1 to −6.4) per 10,000 
person-years among patients with type 1 diabetes 
and −91.9 deaths (95% CI, −108.9 to −75.0) per 
10,000 person-years among patients with type 2 
diabetes (Figs. 1C and 2C). There was a nonsig-
nificant difference between patients with type 1 
diabetes and controls for this outcome (hazard 
ratio, 0.97; P 
= 
0.74) and a 6% greater reduction 
in death from coronary heart disease among con-
trols than among patients with type 2 diabetes 
(hazard ratio for patients with type 2 diabetes vs. 
controls, 0.94; P 
= 
0.009) (Table 3).
Hospitalizations
With respect to hospitalization for cardiovascular 
disease, the event-rate reduction was 36% among 
patients with type 1 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.64; 
95% CI, 0.56 to 0.72) and 44% among patients 
with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 
0.54 to 0.57) (Figs. 1D and 2D, and Tables S8 and 
S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was a 
greater decline in hospitalization for cardiovas-
cular disease among patients with either type of 
diabetes than among controls (Table 3). Findings 
with respect to hospitalization for acute myocar-
dial infarction, coronary heart disease, and stroke 
were broadly similar (Table 3, and Figs. S1 and 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There was no significant reduction in the rate 
of hospitalization for heart failure among either 
patients with type 1 diabetes or controls (Table 3). 
By contrast, we observed a 29% reduction in 
hospitalization for heart failure among patients 
with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.69 to 0.73). There was an 18% greater reduc-
tion in the rate of hospitalization for heart fail-
ure among patients with type 2 diabetes than 
among controls (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12 
to 1.23; P<0.001) (Figs. S1 and S2 and Tables S8 
and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
Our analysis of Swedish nationwide registry data 
from 1998 to 2014 showed marked reductions in 
mortality and in the incidence of cardiovascular 
complications among adults with either type 1 
diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The reduction in the 
rate of fatal outcomes did not differ significantly

between patients with type 1 diabetes and con-
trols, whereas patients with type 2 diabetes had 
less reduction in the rate of fatal outcomes than 
controls. The rate of nonfatal outcomes, however, 
was reduced to a greater degree among patients 
with either type of diabetes than in the respective 
matched control group. There remains a substan-
tial excess overall rate of all outcomes analyzed 
among persons with either type 1 diabetes or 
type 2 diabetes as compared with the general 
population. Although it is difficult to compare 
event-rate reductions across countries owing to 
differences in access to care, standards of clini-
cal care, and diagnostic criteria for diabetes, our 
findings are generally consistent with trends in 
overall mortality and cardiovascular disease asso-
ciated with diabetes that have been observed in 
North America and Europe.23-30
The changes observed in our study most likely 
reflect a combination of advances. The increas-
ing emphasis on integrated care of patients with 
chronic disease, improved patient education in 
disease management, and advancements in clini-
cal decision-making support have probably reduced 
the rates of cardiovascular complications among 
patients with diabetes.31 Advances in revascular-
ization and increased use of glucose-monitoring 
systems may have also played a role.32 Perhaps 
most important, improved management of risk 
factors such as hypertension, elevated levels of 
LDL cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin, and 
macroalbuminuria and the associated higher 
frequency of treatment with statins and antihy-
pertensive medications have transformed cardio-
vascular risk reduction.5,9,14,17,33,34 As is apparent 
from our data, rates of major cardiovascular risk

factors are gradually decreasing, with improved 
control in patients with type 1 diabetes and those 
with type 2 diabetes.
Heart failure has been a somewhat neglected 
complication of diabetes.23,35 Hospitalizations for 
heart failure did not decline significantly among 
either patients with type 1 diabetes or their 
matched controls. However, patients with type 2 
diabetes had a greater event-rate reduction than 
controls. These findings are somewhat surpris-
ing, because rates of hospitalization for coronary 
heart disease and acute myocardial infarction, 
as well as the number of persons with hyperten-
sion and the rate of macroalbuminuria (risk pre-
dictors for heart failure), have decreased to a 
greater degree among patients with type 1 dia-
betes than among those with type 2 diabetes. 
These observations suggest that other processes, 
less well appreciated and therefore less well 
treated, that contribute to heart-failure risk are 
not affected by contemporary clinical care for 
patients with type 1 diabetes.
Some limitations of our study should be noted. 
First, classification of diabetes type was not based 
on detection of islet autoantibodies or measure-
ment of C-peptide levels. However, we believe 
that misclassification is unlikely to have biased 
our findings. The epidemiologic definitions that 
we used have been validated as accurate in 97% 
of cases, as reported previously.36 (See the Supple-
mentary Appendix for a more detailed discussion 
of this issue.37) Second, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that secular trends, such as evolving 
diagnostic thresholds or admissions criteria, could 
have influenced the changes in event rates that 
we have reported. Third, our results are model-
dependent and could change slightly with differ-
ent approaches to the data. Finally, correction for

Mortality and Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes
multiple testing was not performed, and thus 
caution is needed with respect to the interpreta-
tion of significance tests.
In conclusion, we report a decline in all-cause 
mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular 
complications among patients with type 1 dia-
betes or type 2 diabetes in the Swedish NDR. 
The reduction in fatal outcomes did not differ 
significantly between patients with type 1 diabe-
tes and controls, and the reduction in such out-
comes was smaller among patients with type 2 
diabetes than among controls. Nonfatal out-
comes decreased more rapidly among patients 
with either type of diabetes than among con-
trols, but the event rates of all outcomes studied 
remained significantly higher among patients 
with diabetes.
