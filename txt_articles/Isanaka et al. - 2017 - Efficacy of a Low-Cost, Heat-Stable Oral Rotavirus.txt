BACKGROUND
Each year, rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for about 37% of deaths from 
diarrhea among children younger than 5 years of age worldwide, with a dispropor-
tionate effect in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Niger to evaluate the effi-
cacy of a live, oral bovine rotavirus pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, Serum Institute 
of India) to prevent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy infants received three 
doses of the vaccine or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Episodes of gastro-
enteritis were assessed through active and passive surveillance and were graded on 
the basis of the score on the Vesikari scale (which ranges from 0 to 20, with 
higher scores indicating more severe disease). The primary end point was the effi-
cacy of three doses of vaccine as compared with placebo against a first episode of 
laboratory-confirmed severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (Vesikari score, ≥11) begin-
ning 28 days after dose 3.
RESULTS
Among the 3508 infants who were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis, 
there were 31 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in the vaccine group and 87 
cases in the placebo group (2.14 and 6.44 cases per 100 person-years, respectively), 
for a vaccine efficacy of 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.9 to 77.9). Similar 
efficacy was seen in the intention-to-treat analyses, which showed a vaccine effi-
cacy of 69.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 78.7). There was no significant between-group 
difference in the risk of adverse events, which were reported in 68.7% of the infants 
in the vaccine group and in 67.2% of those in the placebo group, or in the risk of 
serious adverse events (in 8.3% in the vaccine group and in 9.1% in the placebo 
group); there were 27 deaths in the vaccine group and 22 in the placebo group. 
None of the infants had confirmed intussusception.
CONCLUSIONS
Three doses of BRV-PV, an oral rotavirus vaccine, had an efficacy of 66.7% against 
severe rotavirus gastroenteritis among infants in Niger. (Funded by Médecins sans

R
otavirus is a leading cause of severe 
gastroenteritis among young children and 
is responsible for approximately 37% of 
deaths from diarrhea among children younger 
than 5 years of age worldwide.1,2 Two live, oral, 
attenuated rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix, GlaxoSmith-
Kline, and RotaTeq, Merck) have met the pre-
qualification requirements of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), stipulations that allow for 
purchase by United Nations agencies.3 The ef-
ficacy of these vaccines has been shown, with 
an important effect on hospital admissions and 
mortality.4-14
Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of 
death associated with rotavirus disease,1 but vac-
cination on a large scale presents challenges.15-17 
Current prices of the two licensed vaccines are 
probably unsustainable without external subsidies. 
In addition, the global supply of the vaccines is 
constrained,18-20 and unreliable transportation and 
storage systems make delivery of vaccines that 
require refrigeration difficult. A heat-stable, live, 
oral bovine rotavirus pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, 
Serum Institute of India)21 was developed for sale 
at or below the current price of the two WHO 
prequalified vaccines that are supported by the 
Gavi Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for 
Vaccines and Immunization). The introduction 
of BRV-PV may help to minimize the burden on 
already strained immunization programs. As part 
of an effort to identify rotavirus vaccines for use 
in resource-constrained settings, we assessed the 
efficacy and safety of BRV-PV against severe rota-
virus gastroenteritis among healthy infants in 
Niger.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized, phase 3, event-driven trial in Mada-
rounfa, Niger, to assess the efficacy and safety 
of BRV-PV against severe rotavirus gastroenteri-
tis. A placebo-controlled design was chosen be-
cause the vaccine was not licensed or available in 
Niger at the time of study initiation, and data 
were needed to inform policy decisions in low-
resource countries.22,23 After a parent or guardian 
provided written informed consent, healthy in-
fants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive three doses of the vaccine or placebo at 
6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Since rotavirus circu-
lates year-round in Niger,24 enrollment was con-
tinuous beginning in August 2014. Infants were 
eligible if they were healthy and the parents re-
sided in villages within the catchment area of 
study sites and intended to remain in the area 
for at least 2 years. Full details of the study de-
sign are provided in the protocol, available with 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The trial was conducted in accordance with 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The trial pro-
tocol was approved by the ethics committee of 
the WHO in Switzerland; the Western Institu-
tional Review Board in Olympia, Washington; 
Comité Consultatif National d’Ethique in Niger; 
Comité de Protection des Personnes in France; 
and Hôpitaux Universitaires de Génève in Swit-
zerland. A data and safety monitoring board 
regularly reviewed the trial data, and an indepen-
dent adjudication committee reviewed suspected 
cases of intussusception. The first and last au-
thors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of 
the data and all analyses and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol.
Vaccine
The trial vaccine, the calcium carbonate buffer, 
and the placebo were developed and manufac-
tured by Serum Institute of India, which donated 
the vaccine, buffer, and placebo. BRV-PV is a 
bovine–human reassortant vaccine containing 
rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 
(>5.6 log10 fluorescent focus units per serotype per 
dose) and is stable for 2 years at a temperature 
of 37°C and for 6 months at 40°C.21 The placebo 
was the same formulation but without the viral 
antigens. The vaccine and placebo were admin-
istered orally in liquid form and were identical 
in appearance and packaging.
The vaccine and placebo were stored at 2°C to 
8°C from the time of shipping to arrival at the 
Epicentre facility in Maradi, Niger. There the 
vaccine and placebo were stored at temperatures 
not exceeding 25°C and, after dispatch, at ambient 
temperature until administration.
Study physicians at health centers administered 
the initial dose to infants who were 6 to 8 weeks 
of age, with each subsequent dose given at 
4-week intervals (range, 3 to 8 weeks). Vaccina-
tion was delayed only if the child was unable to 
swallow, had a history of vomiting within the 
previous 24 hours, or required immediate hospi-
talization. Vaccines that were routinely adminis-

tered according to the guidelines of the Expanded 
Program on Immunization were concomitantly 
administered with the vaccine or placebo. No 
specific instructions to the mothers about breast-
feeding were given at the time of administration.
Randomization
Unique assignment numbers were prepared with 
the use of a computer-generated random-number 
list with nondisclosed permuted blocks of ran-
dom sizes (DiagnoSearch Life Sciences). Vaccine 
and placebo packages were labeled with assign-
ment numbers with identical presentation. All the 
practitioners and participants were unaware of 
the treatment assignments.
Assessment of Efficacy
We defined gastroenteritis as three or more 
looser-than-normal stools during a 24-hour 
period with or without vomiting. We used the 
20-point Vesikari clinical scoring system to de-
fine severity,25 with a score of 11 or more classi-
fied as severe; in post hoc analyses, a score of 15 
or more was classified as very severe. Gastroen-
teritis episodes were classified as two episodes 
if they were separated by at least 5 consecutive 
diarrhea-free days.
Cases of gastroenteritis were captured through 
facility- and home-based surveillance on the basis 
of available evidence regarding health care–
seeking behavior.26 Trial staff members were 
assigned to all health facilities in the trial area 
(e.g., 1 hospital, 5 health centers, and 12 com-
munity health posts). Caregivers were informed 
about the signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis 
and were asked to seek care at a local facility 
free of charge. Home-based surveillance was 
used to identify episodes of gastroenteritis for 
which a caregiver chose not to bring the infant 
to a health facility. Caregivers were advised to 
immediately inform the trial’s community health 
agent in their village if an infant had three or 
more looser-than-normal stools within a 24-hour 
period. Episodes that were not immediately re-
ported to a health facility or to the health agent 
were captured during scheduled weekly home 
visits with the health agent. In such cases, daily 
home visits were conducted until resolution was 
confirmed with at least 5 consecutive diarrhea-
free days.
Stool samples were collected for all episodes 
of gastroenteritis up to 7 days after the last day 
of symptoms. Such specimens, which were masked 
with respect to randomized group, were trans-
ported in freezer packs at 2°C to 8°C on the same 
day and frozen at −80°C for up to 5 days before 
testing. Rotavirus antigen in stool was detected 
by means of enzyme immunoassay (Premier Rota-
clone, Meridian Bioscience), which was performed 
in duplicate, at the Epicentre laboratory located in 
the regional hospital in Maradi. A gastroenteritis 
episode was considered to be caused by rotavirus 
if any rotavirus strain was detected on enzyme 
immunoassay.
Assessment of Safety
Adverse events included all untoward medical 
events and were assessed from the time of the 
first dose until 28 days after the third dose. 
Serious adverse events, including intussuscep-
tion, were defined as any new health-related 
problem that resulted in death, was life-threat-
ening, necessitated hospitalization or prolonga-
tion of existing hospitalization, or resulted in 
disability or incapacity; serious adverse events 
were to be assessed from the time of the ad-
ministration of the first dose until the child 
reached 2 years of age. All adverse events and 
serious adverse events were assessed on the 
basis of facility- and home-based surveillance. 
Caregivers were informed of the signs and symp-
toms of adverse events and serious adverse 
events, including intussusception, and were asked 
to seek care at a local health facility or with the 
trial’s community health agent when any event 
was suspected and of concern. Events that were 
not reported to a health facility or community 
health agent were captured during scheduled 
weekly home visits. In such cases, a symptom 
history was recorded through caregiver interview 
at the time of identification and during daily 
home visits until resolution.
End Points
The primary end point was the efficacy of three 
doses of BRV-PV versus placebo against a first 
episode of laboratory-confirmed severe rotavirus 
gastroenteritis. Secondary end points included 
analyses of vaccine efficacy against rotavirus 
gastroenteritis of any severity, against very severe 
rotavirus gastroenteritis, and against gastroen-
teritis of any cause. Other secondary end points 
were the incidence of immediate adverse events 
within 30 minutes after the administration of

any dose, adverse events that occurred after the 
first dose until 28 days after the third dose, and 
serious adverse events, including intussusception, 
hospitalization, and death.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that a sample size of 7700 infants 
would provide a power of a least 90% to detect a 
50% true vaccine efficacy with a lower boundary 
of the 95% confidence interval of more than 0, 
assuming a 2% rate of severe rotavirus gastroen-
teritis and a 20% rate of nonassessibility (i.e., 
unavailable stool sample or laboratory result) 
among participants. Under these assumptions, 
117 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (39 
in the vaccine group and 78 in the placebo group) 
were required to establish 50% true vaccine effi-
cacy. Since the trial was event-driven, we deter-
mined that data collection for the primary effi-
cacy analysis would be cut off when we had 
identified 117 cases of severe rotavirus gastroen-
teritis that had occurred at least 28 days after the 
third dose of vaccine, which established Novem-
ber 26, 2015, as the cutoff date. The analyses that 
are presented here include follow-up to this date, 
although trial follow-up will continue for second-
ary end points and safety until the participants 
are 2 years of age.
Vaccine efficacy was calculated as the person-
time incidence rate in the vaccinated group divid-
ed by the person-time incidence rate in the place-
bo group, multiplied by 100. The incidence rate 
was calculated as the number of infants who 
had at least one event divided by all available 
follow-up time (calculated as the total time until 
the occurrence of the event, the date of loss to 
follow-up, or data cutoff) with corresponding 
95% confidence intervals derived from the exact 
confidence interval with the use of Poisson dis-
tribution. A participant was considered to be lost 
to follow-up after there had been no contact for 
3 months after the last scheduled visit.
The per-protocol population, which was deter-
mined before unblinding, was considered to be 
the primary analysis population for vaccine ef-
ficacy. This population included infants who had 
received three doses of vaccine or placebo (com-
plete course) without a major protocol violation 
and excluded those who had a laboratory-con-
firmed rotavirus episode between the time of 
the first dose of vaccine to 28 days after the 
third dose. Follow-up in the per-protocol popu-
lation began 28 days after the third dose of vac-
cine. For the infants who had more than one 
episode of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, only 
the first episode was counted toward the pri-
mary end point. Secondary analyses were per-
formed in the intention-to-treat population, 
which included all the participants who had 
received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo, 
with follow-up beginning at the time of the 
first dose.
Safety analyses were performed in the inten-
tion-to-treat population and included follow-up 
from the time of enrollment until 28 days after 
the third dose (for adverse events) or until the 
end of follow-up (for serious adverse events). We 
used Fisher’s exact test to analyze the between-
group difference in the incidence of at least one 
adverse event and at least one serious adverse 
event.
We used the Kaplan–Meier method and the 
log-rank test to compare the rate of survival 
without an episode of severe rotavirus gastroen-
teritis during follow-up. We calculated the num-
ber of events that were prevented per 100 infants 
per year as 100 times the difference in the inci-
dence rate of the placebo and vaccine groups; we 
derived the associated confidence interval using 
the method of Zou and Donner.27
All P values are two-sided, with a value of less 
than 0.05 considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance. No adjustment for multiple compari-
sons was made, since the single primary end 
point was the efficacy of three doses of vaccine 
against a first episode of severe rotavirus gastro-
enteritis beginning 28 days after the third dose. 
Missing data were considered to be missing at 
random, and no imputation was applied. All 
analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
Trial Participants
From August 2014 through November 2015, we 
screened 4137 infants for participation in the 
trial. Of these infants, 4092 underwent random-
ization, received at least one dose of vaccine or 
placebo, and were included in the intention-to-
treat population (Fig. 1). A total of 3508 infants

cebo group) were included in the per-protocol 
analysis. The characteristics of the infants in the 
two groups were similar at baseline (Table 1).
Vaccine Efficacy
At 28 days after the third dose of vaccine or 
placebo, severe rotavirus gastroenteritis had been 
reported in 31 infants in the vaccine group and 
in 87 in the placebo group (2.14 cases vs. 6.44 
cases per 100 person-years), resulting in a per-
protocol vaccine efficacy of 66.7% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 49.9 to 77.9) (Table 2). Vacci-
nation with rotavirus vaccine prevented 4.30 (95% 
CI, 2.75 to 5.85) episodes of severe rotavirus gas-
Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.
Participants could have more than one reason for exclusion from the study. Included in the per-protocol analysis were 
infants who had received all three doses of vaccine or placebo according to the protocol and in whom no laboratory-
confirmed episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis had occurred between the time of the first dose until 28 days after 
the third dose.

troenteritis per 100 person-years. Among the in-
fants who had received at least one dose of vac-
cine or placebo (intention-to-treat population), 
severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was reported in 
35 infants in the vaccine group and in 125 in the 
placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 
69.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 78.7).
In both the per-protocol and intention-to-
treat populations, the proportions of infants 
who did not have an episode of severe rotavirus 
gastroenteritis were significantly higher in the 
vaccine group than in the placebo group 
throughout follow-up (P<0.001) (Fig. 2). Vaccine 
efficacy increased with increasing severity of 
rotavirus gastroenteritis, and the between-group 
difference was significant for very severe gastro-
enteritis of any cause. There was no significant 
between-group difference in vaccine efficacy ac-
cording to coadministration of the oral polio 
vaccine (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org).

Efficacy of an Oral Rotavirus Vaccine in Niger
 
Adverse Events
Immediate adverse events (all grade 1 or 2 fever 
or vomiting) were reported in 3 infants in the 
vaccine group and in 1 in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.37). During the period between the first 
dose of vaccine or placebo and 28 days after the 
third dose, at least one adverse event was recorded 
in 1405 infants (68.7%) in the vaccine group and 
in 1376 (67.2%) in the placebo group (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Analyses of the 
adverse events showed a similar frequency of all 
classes of events in the two groups (P>0.15).
Fewer serious adverse events were reported in 
the vaccine group than in the placebo group (169 
vs. 186 infants with ≥1 event, P 
= 
0.37) (Table 3). 
Overall, there was no significant difference in 
mortality between the vaccine group and the pla-
cebo group (27 deaths and 22 deaths, respective-
ly; P 
= 
0.48). The most common causes of death 
were infections and infestations (in 37 infants) 
and metabolism and nutrition disorders (in 6) 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Med-
ical investigators determined that no serious ad-
verse event was related to the trial intervention. 
There were no confirmed cases of intussusception.
 
Discussion
In this phase 3 trial in Niger, we found that 
three doses of BRV-PV, an oral rotavirus vaccine, 
protected healthy infants from severe rotavirus 
gastroenteritis. In a previous double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial in Ghana, Kenya, and Mali, the 
efficacy of the RotaTeq vaccine against severe 
rotavirus gastroenteritis was 39.3% (95% CI, 
19.1 to 54.7).4 In a similar trial in South Africa 
and Malawi, the efficacy of the Rotarix vaccine 
was 61.2% (95% CI, 44.0 to 73.2).7 In our trial, 
against a higher background incidence of severe 
disease than in the countries in the other two 
trials and with a vaccine efficacy of 66.7%, there 
were 4.30 fewer cases of severe rotavirus gastro-
enteritis per 100 infant-years among infants who 
received BRV-PV than among those who received 
placebo.
Efficacy estimates were lower than those ob-
served in trials of other rotavirus vaccines among 
children in Europe and Latin America (80.5 to 
90.4%),10,12,28,29 a finding that is consistent with 
the results of studies comparing the efficacy of 
various vaccines against other diseases in these 
regions.30-33 The same efficacy gradient has also 
been found in industrialized countries in analyses 
of differences according to socioeconomic status.34
The underlying mechanisms for this finding re-
main poorly understood. Considerations have 
included the epidemiologic features of rotavirus 
infection (e.g., an earlier age at first infection 
among children in Africa, which confers natural 
protection in the placebo group),35 host character-
istics (e.g., poor nutritional status and differences 
in the gut microbiome, enteropathy, and enteric 
coinfections), and interference from maternal

antibodies in breast milk36 and from coadminis-
tration of the oral polio vaccine, which can reduce 
rotavirus antibody levels.37-39 Thus, there is a need 
to explore the role of prenatal nutritional status 
on immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy.
We did not identify any safety concerns with 
BRV-PV. Fewer serious adverse events and hospi-
talizations were reported among vaccinated in-
fants than among those who received placebo. 
There was no significant difference in overall 
mortality between the groups and no plausible 
temporal or biologic causality for reported ad-
verse events. No confirmed cases of intussuscep-
tion were observed, a finding that was consistent 
with the results of other trials of oral rotavirus 
vaccine in the region.40 However, this study was 
not powered to detect an increased incidence of 
rare events such as intussusception.
In 2013, the WHO recommended that rotavi-
rus vaccine be administered whenever children 
present for routine immunizations, a protocol 
that would allow for relaxation of upper age re-
strictions and thus greater coverage.2 In our trial, 
the vaccine efficacy in the intention-to-treat 
population (73.0%), in which the vaccine admin-
istration schedule was more flexible than that in 
the per-protocol population, may more closely 
represent the efficacy under real-world conditions. 
The use of a reduced two-dose schedule with 
pentavalent vaccines has advantages with respect 
to cost and logistics, but evidence has been con-
sistent with respect to the higher efficacy of a 
three-dose schedule.41
This study has several important limitations. 
First, the vaccine was not consistently given con-
comitantly with the oral polio vaccine. However, 
secondary analyses that estimated vaccine effi-
cacy according to whether BRV-PV was coadmin-
istered with oral polio vaccine suggested that the 
observed efficacy was not due to lower rates of 
concomitant administration. Second, the Vesikari 
score was originally designed for use in settings 
of high parental literacy,25 which may have led to 
underscoring of some cases in our trial because 
of low parental literacy, although in such cases 
the results would not have differed between the 
two groups. Finally, at the time of the analysis, 
no extensive genotyping data were available to 
weigh the vaccine efficacy against a changing 
pattern of circulating serotypes, and the limited 
time period for this analysis precluded the inclu-
sion of efficacy data up to 2 years of follow-up.
At present, 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa 
either are using or plan to introduce rotavirus 
vaccines.42 BRV-PV does not require refrigeration 
and has reasonable efficacy with respect to mor-
