Models addressing urgent clinical needs for older adults
with multiple advanced chronic conditions are lacking.
This observational study describes a Community Parame-
dicine
(CP)
model
for
treatment
of
acute
medical
conditions within an Advanced Illness Management (AIM)
program, and compares its effect on emergency depart-
ment (ED) use and subsequent hospitalization with that of
traditional emergency medical services (EMS). Community
paramedics were trained to evaluate and, with telemedi-
cine-enhanced physician guidance, treat acute illnesses in
individuals’ homes. They were also able to transport to the
ED if needed. The CP model was implemented between
January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015 in a suburban–urban
AIM program. Participants included 1,602 individuals
enrolled in the AIM program with high rates of dementia,
decubitus ulcers, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Participants
had a median age of 83 and an average of five activity of
daily living dependencies (range 0–6). During the study
period, there were 664 CP responses and 1,091 traditional
EMS transports to the ED among 773 individuals. Only
22% of CP responses required transport; 78% were evalu-
ated and treated in the home. Individuals that community
paramedics transported to the ED had higher rates of hos-
pitalization (82.2%) than those using traditional EMS
(68.9%)
(P < .001).
Post-CP
surveys
showed
that
all
respondents felt the program was of high quality. Results
support the potential benefits of CP and invite further eval-
uation of this innovative care model.

N
ew models are needed to improve the quality and
costs of care for older adults with multiple advanced
chronic conditions. Two out of three older Americans have
multiple chronic conditions, and treatment for this popula-
tion accounts for 66% of the country’s healthcare budget.1
Homebound older adults are a particularly costly and vul-
nerable subpopulation. Constituting 5.6% of the commu-
nity-dwelling Medicare population (~2 million people),
they tend to be older, female, nonwhite, and less affluent
than those who are not homebound, and only 11.9%
receive primary care services at home.2 Homebound indi-
viduals are often unable to access outpatient care and
forgo needed treatment for extended periods of time.
Faced with an exacerbation of a chronic illness or a new
acute problem, their only option is to dial 911 and seek
treatment in the emergency department (ED).3
Evidence supports an overreliance on hospital ser-
vices for older adults and homebound individuals. More
than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries who are evalu-
ated and treated in the ED (without hospital admission)
may be safely treated in a lower-acuity setting,4 and home-
bound individuals are significantly more likely than those
who are not homebound to have been hospitalized in
the last year (52.1% vs 16.2%).2 Intervening in the
prehospital space could result in significant cost savings—an
estimated $560 million per year for Medicare beneficia-
ries alone4—while also improving individual experience
and avoiding iatrogenic harms that older adults often
incur.5–7
Preventing hospitalization of older adults will require a
multifaceted approach. Efforts to date include engaging and
educating specialists and identifying important research

creation of geriatric EDs, all of which show promise and, in
some cases, have had a beneficial effect.8–10
Community Paramedicine (CP) is a model for health-
care delivery that uses emergency medical service (EMS)
providers to deliver care that is integrated with other
healthcare entities.11 A CP model using paramedics as
physician extenders to provide urgent in-home healthcare
for homebound individuals with multiple chronic illnesses
is described here, but CP is being explored around the
country for varying functions, including hospital postdis-
charge visits, monitoring of chronic conditions, and home
safety assessments.12–14 Important characteristics of all
programs include provision of care that is integrated into
the current healthcare system, person-centered, and physi-
cian led.11 Results of CP programs have been promising,
with programs reporting reduction in costs, use of 911,
and ED visits.15
This prospective observational study explored the feasi-
bility of in-home evaluation and treatment of acute illnesses
by paramedics within an Advanced Illness Management
(AIM) program. The ED transport rate after a CP response
was examined, and the subsequent hospitalization rates for
individuals transported after a CP response were compared
with those transported by traditional EMS. Clinical reasons
for CP deployment and operational metrics are also reported
in hopes of informing the growth of this field.
METHODS
Northwell Health, a large integrated health system, oper-
ates an AIM program consisting of 11 primary care provi-
ders
(nurse
practitioners
and
physicians),
five
social
workers, and five medical coordinators who annually pro-
vide home-based primary care to more than 1,200 people
in Queens and Long Island, New York.
Based in Northwell’s Center for Emergency Medical
Services (CEMS), CP uses paramedics trained in critical
care as physician extenders to provide on-demand urgent
care in an individual’s home. Designed to fit within current
New York State EMS regulations, the program allows col-
laboration between paramedics and the individual’s com-
prehensive care team to leverage appropriate resources
based on individual need.
Community paramedics are a group of experienced
paramedics who have received an additional 40 hours of
instruction in geriatrics and home-based primary care
through didactic training (expanded assessment skills, elec-
trocardiogram interpretation, program-specific workflows),
and physician observation (in the ED and on home visits
with AIM providers). Educational materials were devel-
oped in conjunction with subject matter experts and prior
literature and were based on program-specific needs; the
CEMS Medical Director provided credentialing. Northwell
Health provided cost of paramedic training. CP capabili-
ties include physical examinations, end-tidal carbon diox-
ide
measurements,
electrocardiograms,
blood
glucose
monitoring, medication administration (oral, intravenous,
intramuscular, inhalational), and transport to the ED when
indicated. An AIM physician who is certified to provide
New York State Online Medical Control and has received
additional training in CP capabilities and programmatic
workflows directly oversees
all care telephonically or
through secure videoconference.
The AIM program encourages individuals and care-
givers to call at any time of day with medical concerns.
Emergency calls are routed to a nursing clinical call center
where they are triaged using emergency communication
nurse system de-escalation algorithms. After triage, the
nurse can deploy an ambulance, activate a CP response, con-
nect with an AIM provider (who can deploy a CP response),
or dispense protocol-driven telephonic advice (Figure 1).
In this observational study, individuals were classified
in the intervention group if they were evaluated at least
once by CP and in the usual care group if they received
only traditional EMS responses during the study period
(January 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015). In addition to activity
of daily living (ADL) dependencies and advanced care
planning status, which clinicians routinely update, infor-
mation on chief complaint (entered by physicians after
every CP response) and participant demographic character-
istics were extracted from electronic health records. Infor-
mation on response time, time on scene, and medications
administered were collected from CEMS records. Postvisit
feedback was solicited by mail. Surveys were sent within
1 week of all CP responses; a survey was not sent to indi-
viduals who died before the mailing. The Northwell
Health institutional review board approved the research
with a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act waiver and exemption from written consent. Cross-
sectional univariate analyses were used, treating each
individual or each call as an independent event. Chi-square
tests were used for categorical variables and t-tests for con-
tinuous variables. All statistical analyses were performed
using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows characteristics of the 1,602 individuals
enrolled in the AIM program during the study period.
Two-thirds were female, median age was 83, and median
number of ADL dependencies was 5 (range 0–6). The
study population had high rates of chronic conditions:
dementia (44%), decubitus ulcers (29%), diabetes mellitus
(26%),
congestive
heart
failure
(24%),
and
chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (15%).
Of enrolled individuals, 773 (48.3%) had at least one
emergency response during the study period; 404 (52.3%)
used CP at least once, and 369 (47.7%) used only tradi-
tional EMS. Individuals seen by community paramedics
were significantly more likely to be older, have more ADL
dependencies, and have a do-not-resuscitate order than
those using only traditional EMS responses. Both groups
had high rates of advance care planning.
One thousand seven hundred fifty-five events (CP
responses and traditional EMS transports) occurred during
the study period, with a median of 2 responses per person;
664 (37.8%) were CP responses, and the remaining 1,091
(62.2%) were traditional EMS responses. In 78% of CP
responses, individuals were evaluated, treated, and remained
at home. Average CP response time (call initiation to para-
medic in home) was 21 minutes, and average time on scene
was 70 minutes. The most common medications given in

 the home were normal saline, albuterol, ipratropium bro-
mide, furosemide, ondansetron, and methylprednisolone.
After transport to the ED (total 1,237 events), hospital
admission rate was significantly higher for individuals
transported after a CP response (82.2%) than after a tradi-
tional EMS transport (68.9%) (P < .001). There was no
difference in length of stay between individuals admitted
to the hospital after transport by CP (5.9 days) and tradi-
tional
EMS
(5.2 days)
(P = .27).
Of
individuals
who
received a CP visit and were not transported to the ED,
1.7% (9/518) were subsequently seen in an ED within
24 hours of the CP response.
Community paramedics were most often dispatched
for pulmonary complaints (shortness of breath, cough)
(23.6%), followed by neurological and psychiatric (most
often altered mental status, less commonly stroke symp-
toms, seizure) (17.9%), generalized malaise or weakness
(15.2%), and cardiac or blood pressure concerns (chest
pain, hypo- or hypertension) (10.1%). There were no sig-
nificant differences between ED transport and in-home
treatment rates for any chief complaints with the exception
of cardiac or blood pressure concerns; 9% more individu-
als were transported in this group.
Three hundred twenty-nine individuals or caregivers
were mailed surveys within 1 week of the CP response,
and 116 (35%) responded. All agreed or strongly agreed
that CP delivered high-quality services and care, and 97%
agreed that they would use the service in a future medical
emergency; 91.4% reported they would have sought emer-
gency care if CP had not been available. There were no
statistically significant differences in sex or hospital trans-
port by CP between survey respondents and nonrespon-
dents, although surveys were more likely to have been
returned for older adults (average age: respondents 85,
nonrespondents 81, P = .02).
DISCUSSION
The authors experience suggests that this CP model, in
which paramedics act as physician extenders to provide
acute in-home healthcare, could enhance current treatment
models for homebound individuals with advanced illness.
CP can safely assess and treat medically complex individu-
als at home, demonstrating a low post-CP ED presentation
rate. Furthermore, the significantly higher admission rate
for individuals transported by CP shows that paramedic–
physician teams can identify the sickest individuals who
need and want inpatient treatment. This program is
designed to honor individuals’ goals of care, so even some
of the sickest individuals were treated in the home with
comfort-oriented measures, highlighting the need for high
rates of advance care planning in such a model. Postvisit

locus of care. cCommunity paramedics can provide more than 20 medications (intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational) in the

 feedback indicated that individuals and caregivers wel-
comed this care model enhancement, likely because it
was consistent with desires to age in place and receive
meaningful clinical care given CP’s unique ability to
deliver
advanced
diagnostics
and
in-home
medication
administration on an urgent basis around the clock.
As payers push providers to assume risk for healthcare
spending, it is anticipated that the opportunity for cost
savings will lead to CP program expansion. Lack of reim-
bursement for nontransported paramedic services is an
obstacle to this model’s proliferation. With Medicare’s
average hospitalization cost of $12,200 in 2012,16 prevent-
ing even a few admissions could offset the cost of a CP
program and generate revenue in risk-based arrangements.
CP pilot programs are currently being funded through
grants, institutional support, and per-member-per-month
fees; further research generated from these pilot programs
on cost savings, satisfaction, and safety could provide evi-
dence for reimbursement for CP services.
Data from other programs using CP to treat urgent
conditions are promising. One randomized controlled trial
from the United Kingdom that used CP during daytime
hours to care for a limited scope of medical conditions
showed a reduction in ED visits and a nonsignificant trend
toward reduction in cost of care for individuals in the CP
group.17 Another used CP to treat elderly adults with
minor medical conditions at home; the intervention group
experienced a decrease in ED visits and hospital admis-
sions, greater satisfaction, and no significant difference in
28-day mortality.18 Systematic reviews concluded that this
model provided value by treating adults on scene, reduced
referrals to EDs, and showed promise in improving system
performance and outcomes.19,20
There are limitations to this report, including selection
bias and lack of control group; clinical judgment guided
CP deployment and the decision to transport during the
response. Survey return rate was relatively low, and future
studies may seek a higher rate by collecting satisfaction
results telephonically. In addition, this program might not
be easily replicated in all locations for two reasons. First,
laws governing the use of paramedics as physician exten-
ders may be prohibitive, and second, programs may lack
the institutional support that is often needed to initiate a
CP program. Nonetheless, as the number of adults with

 advanced illness rises, the need for a meaningful around-
the-clock clinical response will only grow. This report
shows the potential feasibility and benefits of a CP model
in which paramedics and physicians move from risk-avoi-
