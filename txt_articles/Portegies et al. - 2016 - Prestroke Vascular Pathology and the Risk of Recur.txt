urvival after stroke has improved over the past decades, 
thanks to thrombolytic therapy, specialized stroke units, 
and better secondary prevention.1,2 However, such improved 
survival may lead to more people having long-term hazards of 
stroke, such as recurrent stroke and dementia.3,4 These long-
term risks after stroke are not well documented, nor are the 
factors that determine this risk. In this regard, risk factors 
that lead to the initial stroke may also predispose to clinical 
adverse events after stroke. Indeed, we previously showed that 
27% of all deaths after stroke can be attributed to risk factors 
already present before stroke.5
We now expand on that previous report by investigating 
recurrent stroke and poststroke dementia and how these are 
affected by prestroke risk factors.
Methods
Extensive details on the Methods are presented in the online-only Data 
Supplement and are largely identical to a previous article.5 Briefly, this 
study was embedded within the population-based Rotterdam Study,6 
which totals 14,926 participants aged >45 years, who were repeatedly 
examined every 4 years. We selected 1243 participants who had an inci-
dent stroke between 1990 and 2012 and matched these to 4 participants 
without stroke with matching done on date of selection, age, sex, and 
visit to the same examination round, using an incidence density sam-
pling. Participants were then followed up for the occurrence of stroke 
or dementia until January 1, 2012. In total, 1237 participants with 
stroke and 4928 stroke-free participants were eligible for the analyses 
with recurrent stroke and, respectively, 993 and 4363 for the dementia 
analyses (Figure I and Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Results
Risk of recurrent stroke and dementia was highest in the short-
term, but even beyond the first year, the risk of recurrent stroke 
(incidence rate ratio, 3.16 [95% confidence interval, 2.59–
3.85]) and dementia (incidence rate ratio, 1.73 [1.38–2.17]) 
remained increased. However, these differences were only 
statistically significant from years 1 to 5 (Figure).
Participants with stroke had a worse cardiovascular pro-
file than participants without stroke (Table I online-only 
Data Supplement). Main factors contributing to a recurrent 
Background and Purpose—Improved short-term survival after stroke has necessitated quantifying risk and risk factors 
of long-term sequelae after stroke (ie, recurrent stroke and dementia). This risk may be influenced by exposure to 
cardiovascular risk factors before the initial stroke. Within the population-based Rotterdam Study, we determined the 
long-term risk of recurrent stroke and dementia, and the proportion of recurrent strokes and poststroke dementia cases 
that are attributable to prestroke cardiovascular risk factors (ie, the population attributable risk).
Methods—We followed up 1237 patients with first-ever stroke and 4928 stroke-free participants, matched on age, sex, 
examination round, and stroke date (index date), for the occurrence of stroke or dementia. We calculated incidence rates 
in both groups and estimated the individual and combined population attributable risk of prestroke cardiovascular risk 
factors for both outcomes.
Results—Beyond 1 year after stroke, patients retained a 3-fold increased risk of recurrent stroke and an almost 2-fold 
increased risk of dementia compared with people without stroke. In total, 39% (95% confidence interval, 18%–66%) 
of recurrent strokes and 10% (95% confidence interval, 0%–91%) of poststroke dementia cases were attributable to 
prestroke cardiovascular risk factors. These percentages were similar for first-ever stroke and dementia in the matched 
stroke-free population.
Conclusions—Long-term risks of recurrent stroke and poststroke dementia remain high and are substantially influenced 
by prestroke risk factors, emphasizing the need for optimizing primary prevention.

stroke were hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, smoking and transient isch-
emic attack (Table 1). The total population attributable risk 
(PAR) for all risk factors combined was similar in people 
with stroke (0.39 [0.18–0.66]) compared with those without 
(0.39 [0.24–0.57]).
We found no significant associations of prestroke cardiovas-
cular risk factors with dementia (Table 2), resulting in a low PAR 
of 0.10 (0.001–0.91) in people with stroke versus 0.09 (0.02–
0.37) in those without. Adjusting for competing risks resulted 
in slightly lower hazard ratios of diabetes mellitus and smoking 
(Tables II and III in the online-only Data Supplement).

 Portegies et al  Prestroke Risk Factors for Hazards After Stroke   2121
Stratification by sex showed prestroke cardiovascular 
risk factors to have a stronger effect on recurrent strokes 
in women than in men (Tables IV and V in the online-only 
Data Supplement), whereas the reverse was true for dementia 
(Tables VI and VII in the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
We found that patients with stroke remain at an increased risk 
of stroke and dementia up to at least 5 years after their event 
compared with people without stroke. Prestroke cardiovascu-
lar risk factors accounted for a large proportion of recurrent 
strokes (39%), and to a lesser extent of poststroke dementia 
(10%). These proportions were similar for first-ever stroke 
and dementia in stroke-free participants.
To date, studies investigating risk factors of stroke out-
comes have established that the risk of recurrent stroke is 
strongly determined by cardiovascular risk factors measured 
at time of stroke,7,8 whereas the risk of poststroke cognitive 
decline and dementia is largely driven by characteristics of 
the stroke itself (ie, location and severity).9,10 The main nov-
elty of our study is that we showed that a substantial pro-
portion of recurrent strokes and dementia cases after stroke 
is attributable to prestroke cardiovascular risk factors. These 
factors may have caused irreversible damage before the ini-
tial stroke and thus before secondary prevention started, sug-
gesting that secondary prevention might be too late. Because 
the known modifiable risk factors as used in this study only 
contribute to a part of recurrent stroke and dementia cases, 
our findings also indicate that further research into novel 
modifiable factors is necessary. These may include genetic 
factors, biomarkers, presence of prestroke subclinical vascu-
lar disease, or response to treatment.10,11
Strengths of our study are the population-based setting, 
long follow-up, availability of cardiovascular risk factors 
measured before time of stroke, and the thorough follow-up 
for clinical events. Limitations of our study are that we only 
measured prestroke risk factors once and the lack of data 
on stroke severity, a possible mediator in the association. 
Moreover, 6.2% of the population did not visit the research 
center before the stroke, which could lead to selection bias if 
they were unhealthier. Similarly, up to 9.7% of data on risk 
factors was imputed, which may lead to misclassification. We 
also acknowledge that the PAR may be somewhat overesti-
mated because of competing risk of death. Slight overestima-
tion also occurs because the PAR assumes complete removal 
of a risk factor, which in reality is often unachievable.12,13 On 
the contrary, the PAR may be underestimated because we only 
estimated the effect that removal of a risk factor will have on 
poststroke clinical events. However, in reality, removal of a 
risk factor may also prevent stroke itself, which precludes any 
poststroke events.12
Conclusions
Patients with stroke remain for a long time at an increased 
risk of recurrent stroke and dementia. Prestroke cardiovascu-
lar risk factors contribute to 39% of recurrent strokes and 10% 
of poststroke dementia cases. Taken together, this emphasizes 
the need of optimizing both primary and secondary preven-
tions. At the same time, our results encourage exploration of 
other potentially modifiable factors.
