Introduction
Melanoma regression, either through adoptive T cell therapy (ATT) 
or T cell checkpoint inhibitors blocking CTLA4 or PD-1/PD-1 ligand, 
correlated with increased frequencies of neoantigen-specific T cells, 
as deduced from cancer genome sequencing (1–3). However, the 
potential of neoantigen-specific T cells to induce tumor regression 
is largely unexplored (4). Neoepitopes may vary in their suitability as 
target (5), but identifying suitable epitopes remains difficult because 
in vitro analysis of T cells often cannot predict in vivo efficacy (6). 
Similarly, although T cells against neoepitopes are not subjected to 
central tolerance mechanisms, their fate in cancer-bearing individu-
als is unclear, as is the functional quality of T cell receptors (TCRs) 
obtained from individuals with cancer. Therefore, we investigated 
different human melanoma mutations as targets for TCR gene ther-
apy in a syngeneic HLA-A2–transgenic cancer model in which spe-
cific immune recognition relies on human molecules (MHC, TCR, 
and tumor antigen), while cellular components (tumor cells, T cells 
and host) are of mouse origin. Using the model, we also compared a 
native melanoma epitope with its anchor-modified variant to deter-
mine whether experiments using peptide analogs are of predictive 
value for the design of clinical applications.
Results and Discussion
Three cancer-driving mutations have been described in the 
cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene of human melanomas, 
substituting arginine at position 24, which is critical for binding 
to p16INK4A (R24C, R24H, and R24L) (7–9). Since these mutations 
modify an HLA-A2 anchor position, the CDK4 peptide becomes 
antigenic and is recognized by specific T cells (7, 10) if the muta-
tion stabilizes the peptide:MHC complex. We isolated the TCR 
14/35 from a T cell clone, which was established by culture with 
the autologous melanoma cell line SKMEL-29 bearing the R24C 
mutation (ref. 7 and Figure 1A). The 14/35-transduced human 
T cells (Figure 1B) recognized HLA-A2+ SKMEL-29 (R24C) 
and WM-902B melanoma cells bearing the R24L mutation, as 
indicated by IFN-γ release and cytotoxic activity, by measur-
ing CD107a expression (Figure 1, A and C, and Supplemental 
Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this 
article; doi:10.1172/JCI83465DS1). In contrast, 14/35-trans-
duced human T cells did not recognize SKMEL-37, containing 
the R24H mutation (Figure 1, A and C, and Supplemental Fig-
ure 1A), which probably does not support MHC binding and 
was therefore excluded from further analysis. The 624MEL-38 
melanoma cells, containing wild-type CDK4, were also not rec-
ognized (Figure 1, A and C, and Supplemental Figure 1A). West-
ern blot analysis confirmed expression of CDK4 in all human 
melanoma cell lines (Supplemental Figure 2). The antitumor 
response of 14/35-transduced T cells was similar to that of T 
cells modified with a tyrosinase-specific TCR that was derived 
from a nontolerant T cell repertoire (anti-TYR; ref. 11 and Fig-
ure 1, B and C). R24L, but not R24C or R24H, is predicted to 
increase the affinity of the mutated CDK4 peptide to HLA-A2 
(Table 1). However, the binding prediction of the cysteine-con-
taining peptide R24C is problematic, because algorithms do not 
account for unavoidable oxidation and cysteinylation during 
In successful cancer immunotherapy, T cell responses appear to be directed toward neoantigens created by somatic 
mutations; however, direct evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells cause regression of established cancer is lacking. Here, we 
generated T cells expressing a mutation-specific transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) to target different immunogenic mutations 
in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) that naturally occur in human melanoma. Two mutant CDK4 isoforms (R24C, R24L) 
similarly stimulated T cell responses in vitro and were analyzed as therapeutic targets for TCR gene therapy. In a syngeneic 
HLA-A2–transgenic mouse model of large established tumors, we found that both mutations differed dramatically as targets 
for TCR-modified T cells in vivo. While T cells expanded efficiently and produced IFN-γ in response to R24L, R24C failed to 
induce an effective antitumor response. Such differences in neoantigen quality might explain why cancer immunotherapy 
induces tumor regression in some individuals, while others do not respond, despite similar mutational load. We confirmed the 
validity of the in vivo model by showing that the melan-A–specific (MART-1–specific) TCR DMF5 induces rejection of tumors 
expressing analog, but not native, MART-1 epitopes. The described model allows identification of those neoantigens in human 
cancer that serve as suitable T cell targets and may help to predict clinical efficacy.

mouse MC703 tumor cells. The fibrosarcoma MC703 was gen-
erated in an HLA-A2–transgenic mouse (HHD, chimeric HLA-
A2/H-2Db) (13) and expressed HHD (Figure 1E). The tumor cells 
MC703-R24C and MC703-R24L expressed similar amounts 
of mutant CDK4 (Figure 1F) and were similarly recognized by 
HHD-derived T cells that were transduced with 14/35 (Figure 1, 
G and H, and Supplemental Figure 1B). Transgenic expression 
of CDK4 variants in MC703 tumor cells was somewhat higher if 
compared with the native expression in human melanoma cell 
lines (Supplemental Figure 2). In vitro analysis of both CDK4 
assays. Furthermore, it was suggested that the highly oxidiz-
able sulfur residue in cysteine may contribute to MHC binding 
and could function as “pseudo”-anchor residue (5), an excep-
tion that is not considered when evaluating the R24C peptide in 
silico (12). Experimentally, 14/35-transduced human T cells rec-
ognized both the R24C and the R24L peptides, and differences 
were only detectable at low peptide concentrations (Figure 1D). 
This does not reflect the large differences obtained from MHC-
binding predictions. To analyze the quality of both neoepitopes 
as therapeutic targets in a model of large established tumors,

genes improved recognition of MC703 cells, while the rel-
ative difference in recognition of both neoepitopes remained 
unchanged (Supplemental Figure 5). Under these limiting con-
ditions, a better recognition of the R24L compared with the 
R24C mutation became clearly apparent. However, tumors 
expressing increased amounts of the R24C epitope still pro-
gressed after transfer of 14/35-TE (Figure 2C and Supplemen-
tal Table 1). In contrast, all R24L epitope–expressing tumors 
were eradicated (Figure 2D), suggesting that R24L is a rejec-
tion epitope in human melanoma if sufficient peptide:MHC I 
complexes are present on the tumor cells.
To investigate differences in therapeutic outcome when tar-
geting R24C or R24L, we followed 14/35-TE after transfer into 
mice bearing MC703-R24C or MC703-R24L tumors. On day 7 
after ATT, high numbers of CD8+ 14/35-TE were detected when 
tumors expressed the R24L mutation (Figure 2E), while T cell 
expansion was significantly impaired when tumors expressed 
R24C (Figure 2, E and F). We asked whether 14/35-transduced 
CD4+ T cells contributed to the response to R24L. However, 
only CD8+ but not CD8– 14/35-TE expanded in vivo in response 
to R24L (Supplemental Figure 6A). Similarly, the total number 
of CD8+ but not CD8– 14/35-TE increased during the course 
of ATT (Supplemental Figure 6, B and C). Furthermore, only 
CD8+ but not CD4+ 14/35-transduced HHD T cells (Supple-
mental Figure 6D) secreted IFN-γ and IL-2 after incubation 
with MC703 target cells (Supplemental Figure 6, E and F), sug-
mutations, using human 14/35-transduced T cells and human 
melanoma cells that naturally express the CDK4 mutations or 
T cells and tumor cells from HHD mice, suggested R24C and 
R24L as relevant targets for specific T cells.
For in vivo analysis, we used HHD Rag–/– mice lacking 
mouse MHC I molecules, B cells, and T cells to focus on a 
single human MHC I molecule and to exclude endogenous T 
cell responses. HHD Rag–/– mice bearing large tumors (grown 
for 3 to 4 weeks, having an average diameter of 9–10 mm) 
were treated with 14/35-transduced effector T cells derived 
from HHD mice (14/35-TE). Remarkably, 14/35-TE did not 
even delay progression of MC703-R24C tumors (Figure 2A 
and Supplemental Table 1), while large MC703-R24L tumors 
regressed upon 14/35-TE treatment (Figure 2B). However, 
probably because expression of HHD in transgenic mice is 
low (Supplemental Figure 3) and the antigen expression level 
is critical for successful ATT (14), tumors eventually relapsed. 
We repeated the experiments using MC703 cells that express 
minigenes encoding 3 copies of the R24C (MC703-ACD) or the 
R24L (MC703-ALD) epitope (Supplemental Figure 4, A and B) 
to compensate for low MHC expression. Both cancer cell lines 
were similarly recognized by 14/35-TE in vitro (Supplemental 
Figure 4C). To determine the improvement in target cell recog-
nition by increasing the amount of epitopes on the cancer cells, 
we titrated the number of antigen-expressing MC703 cells 
necessary to stimulate 14/35-transduced HHD T cells. Using

sent an unprecedented case of the stochastic nature of creating 
immuno 
genic neoepitopes of dramatically different quality. It is 
likely that both neoepitopes were selected for their oncogenicity 
and were recognized on the autologous tumor, leading to expan-
sion of a specific T cell response. In the case of CDK4R24C, T cells 
were clonally expanded on the autologous melanoma cells (7), 
while in the case of CDK4R24L, neoepitope-specific T cells were 
detected at low frequency within the tumor-infiltrating lympho-
cytes (10). Both CDK4 neoepitopes were naturally expressed 
by human melanoma cells and stimulated specific T cells in 
vitro. Also in common, T cells to both neoepitopes neither pre-
vented melanoma nor selected escape variants in the respective 
patient, which is compatible with data from a sporadic cancer 
model (24). Paradoxically, the mutant CDK4-specific TCR, 
raised against the R24C mutation, was only effective against 
R24L. Given the generally high mutation load in human mela-
noma, we hypothesize that deviation of the T cell response to the 
R24C mutation might deter the T cell response to other reces-
sive neoepitopes (25). Thus, our data may give one explanation 
for the differential response of patients to checkpoint inhibi-
tors despite similar mutational load. We note, however, that the 
R24L mutation needed to be expressed in sufficient amounts 
to prevent tumor recurrence, as suggested (14). Data on target-
ing MART-1 confirmed the difficulty of predicting therapeutic 
efficacy based on in vitro analysis and the importance of high 
peptide:MHC affinity (6). The results are at variance with clini-
cal trials in melanoma patients with the DMF5 TCR that showed 
some efficacy (26). However, in these trials, high-dose IL-2 
was additionally applied, which alone can achieve responses in 
16% of the patients (27). Alternatively, low MHC I expression in 
HHD-transgenic cells could have impeded TCR gene therapy. 
The current syngeneic model using large established tumors 
and only the T cell recognition system that is of human origin 
allows identification of (un)suitable epitopes, which, in turn, 
may help to improve clinical success rates.
gesting that therapeutic effects can be ascribed to CD8+ 14/35-
TE. Next, we analyzed serum levels of IFN-γ, a critical effector 
cytokine for tumor rejection (15), to obtain evidence for func-
tional T cell activation in vivo. The concentration of IFN-γ in 
blood correlated with the number of CD8+ 14/35-TE and was 
higher if tumors expressed the R24L mutation (Figure 2, G and 
H). This is in line with the observation that 14/35-transduced 
HHD T cells showed higher sensitivity for tumor cells express-
ing the R24L mutation (Supplemental Figure 5), which likely 
improved T cell activation/expansion in vivo and supported 
IFN-γ production in lymphopenic tumor-bearing mice.
To confirm the critical role of the target epitope in ATT, we 
employed native and anchor-modified melan-A (MART-1) epi-
topes. The MART-1 nonamer peptide AAGIGILTV (AAG) (16) 
is assumed to be relevant in HLA-A2+ melanoma (17), whereas 
MART-1–specific T cells are often analyzed using the decam-
eric peptide ELAGIGILTV (ELA) (18). ELA is modified from its 
original sequence in position 2 to improve MHC binding (Table 
1). Biochemical analyses showed that the MART-1–specific TCR 
DMF5 engages both ligands similarly, with only minor differ-
ences in affinity (19). To evaluate the potential of DMF5-trans-
duced T cells to eliminate AAG-expressing cancer, we gener-
ated MC703 cells expressing minigenes that encode either AAG 
(MC703-AAG) or ELA epitopes (MC703-ELA, Figure 3A). Both 
cancer cell lines were equally recognized by DMF5-transduced 
HHD T cells in vitro (Figure 3, B and C). However, the growth of 
MC703-AAG tumors was not influenced by ATT using DMF5-
TE (Figure 3D and Supplemental Table 1), while MC703-ELA 
tumors were rejected (Figure 3E). In a manner comparable to 
the differences in the recognition of the 2 CDK4 neoepitopes by 
14/35-TE, CD8+ DMF5-TE expanded in mice bearing ELA- but 
not AAG-expressing MC703 tumors (Figure 3F).
In mice and humans, effective T cell responses seem pri-
marily directed against somatically mutated neoepitopes 
(20–23). The 2 CDK4 mutations in human melanoma repre-
