Circadian clock desynchronization has been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular
disease and related risk factors (eg, obesity, diabetes). Thus, we examined the extent to which
circadian desynchronization exacerbates ischemic stroke outcomes and whether its detrimental
effects on stroke severity and functional impairments are further modified by biological sex. Cir-
cadian entrainment of activity rhythms in all male and female rats was observed during exposure
to a fixed light-dark (LD) 12:12 cycle but was severely disrupted when this LD cycle was routinely
shifted (12 h advance/5 d) for approximately 7 weeks. In contrast to the regular estrous cycles in
fixed LD animals, cyclicity was abolished and persistent estrus was evident in all shifted LD females.
The disruption of estrous cyclicity in shifted LD females was associated with a significant increase
in serum estradiol levels relative to that observed in fixed LD controls. Circadian rhythm disruption
exacerbated stroke outcomes in both shifted LD male and female rats and further amplified sex
differences in stroke impairments. In males, but not females, circadian disruption after exposure
to the shifted LD cycle was marked by high rates of mortality. In surviving females, circadian
desynchronization after exposure to shifted LD cycles produced significant increases in stroke-
induced infarct volume and sensorimotor deficits with corresponding decreases in serum IGF-1
levels. These results suggest that circadian rhythm disruption associated with shift work schedules
or the irregular nature of our everyday work and/or social environments may interact with other
nonmodifiable risk factors such as biological sex to modulate the pathological effects of stroke.

n mammals, the generation and photoentrainment of
circadian rhythms is mediated by a hierarchical organi-
zation of cell-autonomous clocks distributed throughout
the body. In the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the anterior
hypothalamus,theensembleofcellularclocksfunctionsas
a master pacemaker in this hierarchical network, whereas
clocks located in other brain regions and peripheral tissues
provide for the local coordination of tissue- or cell-specific
processes in time (1). The circadian timekeeping function
of suprachiasmatic nuclei and peripheral clocks is stable
under “normal” conditions. However, circadian rhythm
disturbances or desynchronization are known to occur in
responsetoshiftwork,jetlagandevenworkplaceorsocial
influences that commonly impose highly irregular sched-
ules on our sleep-wake patterns, mealtimes, and other
health-related processes.
Pathologies and environmental disturbances in the reg-
ulation of circadian rhythms have been linked to human
health disorders, including vascular disease or related risk
factors. Basic research studies have typically used 2 dif-
ferent approaches, genetic mutations in core clock genes
and environmental manipulations simulating shift work-

 type schedules, to illustrate the effects of circadian rhythm
disturbances on cardiovascular physiology. Global dele-
tion of the clock gene Bmal1 has been shown to abolish the
daily rhythm in blood pressure and induce constant hy-
potension (2). Furthermore, altered circadian rhythms in
Clock mutant mice are accompanied by notable risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular disease including obesity and met-
abolic syndrome (3, 4). In a similar fashion, chronic mod-
ulation of circadian rhythms through shift work-like
reversing of the light-dark (LD) cycle accelerates the de-
velopment of coronary pathology and congestive heart
failure in cardiomyopathic hamsters (5). Clinical studies
provide further evidence implicating circadian rhythm de-
synchronization, due to shift work or misalignment with
abnormal external cycles, as a contributing factor for vas-
cular disease in general and stroke severity/recovery in
particular. The alteration of circadian rhythms in subjects
maintained on a 28-hour day is associated with hypergly-
cemia, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated arterial blood pres-
sure (6), all of which substantially increase the risk for
cardio- and cerebrovascular disease.
At present, little is known about how circadian distur-
bances affect stroke severity and how this variable inter-
acts with other nonmodifiable risk factors such as age and
biological sex to modulate the pathological effects of
stroke. Stroke is an inflammatory disease and poststroke
disruption of the blood brain barrier as well as activation
of systemic and brain resident immune cells are key factors
in the pathophysiology of stroke. Hence, the immune sys-
temmaybeanimportanttargetforthepathologicaleffects
of circadian disruption on stroke. This possibility is indi-
rectly supported by recent studies demonstrating that
global disruption of circadian rhythms in mice with tar-
geted clock gene mutations increases the infiltration and
activation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and ex-
acerbates macrophage inflammatory responses and tissue
inflammation(7).Usingamiddlecerebralarteryocclusion
(MCAo)-induced model of ischemic stroke, the objective
of our experiments was to examine the extent to which
circadian rhythm desynchronization exacerbates stroke
severity and whether this pathological impact is modified
by biological sex.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult (5–7 mo old) female and male Sprague Dawley rats
were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. All animals were
housed individually in cages equipped with running wheels to
provide for continuous analysis of wheel-running activity.
Experiments used a chronic LD cycle shift paradigm that has
been shown to be effective in desynchronizing circadian rhythms
and in inducing pathological changes in cardiovascular physiol-
ogy (5). After baseline acclimation under LD 12:12 conditions
(lights-on at 6 AM) for about 2 weeks, animals were randomly
divided into 2 groups (n � 10/treatment group) and exposed for
8weekseithertothis“fixed”LD12:12cycleortoa“shifted”LD
12:12 cycle. In the shifted LD 12:12 cycle, lights-on was ad-
vanced by 12 hours every 5 days for approximately 7 weeks. At
the conclusion of this treatment period, animals in both groups
were exposed to the same LD 12:12 schedule (lights-on at 6 AM)
and subjected to experimental ischemic stroke surgery at the
same relative time during the circadian cycle (ie, midday or in-
active phase). Sensorimotor testing was performed 2 days before
and 5 days after MCAo surgery at Zeitgeber time 5 (ie, 5 h after
lights-on) to assess functional deficits. At 5 days after MCAo,
terminalbloodsampleswerecollectedandbrainswereprocessed
for histological analysis of infarct volume. This analysis was
separately performed on male rats (n � 20) and on independent
cohorts of females (n � 40). All animal procedures used in this
study were conducted in compliance with Animal Use Protocol
2014–0021 as reviewed and approved by the Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University.
Analysis of wheel-running activity
Wheel-running activity was continuously recorded, stored in
10-minute bins, graphically depicted in actograms and analyzed
using ClockLab data collection and analysis software (ActiMe-
trics). Entrainment and qualitative parameters of the activity
rhythmweremeasuredoverthesameintervalforallanimals.The
onset of activity for a given cycle was identified as the first bin
during which an animal attained 10% of peak running-wheel
revolutions (ie, intensity). Activity duration (�) was determined
by measuring the time interval between the daily activity onsets
and offsets. In addition, �2 periodogram analysis was used to
determinetheamplitudeoftherhythminwheel-runningactivity.
Estrous cycle determination
The effects of experimental LD cycle manipulations on es-
trous cyclicity were tested using separate groups of fixed (n � 8)
and shifted (n � 8) LD female rats. Before and immediately after
the conclusion of LD manipulations when animals in both
groups were exposed to the same LD 12:12 schedule (lights-on
at 6 AM), estrous cyclicity was assessed by obtaining daily vaginal
smears(10–11 AM)overa14-to20-dayperiod.Smears,obtained
with a cotton swab, were placed on a slide and later examined
under a microscope (�10 objective; Nikon Instruments) and
staged according to commonly accepted criteria (8).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Animals were subjected to stereotaxic surgery to occlude the
leftmiddlecerebralarteryusingendothelin-1(ET-1)asdescribed
previously (9, 10). Briefly, animals were anesthetized (ketamine/
xylazine) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf). A midline
incision was made on the scalp and a craniotomy was performed
on the left side with a small drill using the following coordinates
(relative to bregma): �0.9 mm anteroposterior, �3.4 mm me-
diolateral, �8.5 mm dorsoventral. ET-1 (3 �L of 0.5 �g/�L;
American Peptide Co Inc) was injected at a rate of 0.25 �L per
30 seconds onto the middle cerebral artery. To minimize back-
flow, the syringe was maintained in place for 3 minutes after
ET-1 administration. Rats were maintained on heating pads dur-

 ing the procedure and then placed under heating lamps during
recovery. Poststroke survival was carefully recorded at 24-hour
intervals. All surviving animals were sacrificed at day 5 after
MCAo. At termination, the brain was rapidly removed and pro-
cessed for triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining to assess
infarct volume.
Infarct volume
Brain sections (2 mm) between �2.00 mm and �4.00 mm
from bregma were incubated in a 2% TTC solution at 37°C for
20 minutes. Stained sections were photographed using a Nikon
E950 digital camera attached to a dissecting microscope. Digi-
tized images were used to estimate infarct volume using the
Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). Three separate slices
were used for analysis, and only the superior face of each slice,
which is clearly stained by TTC, was analyzed. The area of the
infarct was quantified in all slices and compared with measure-
ment of the total area of the contralateral hemisphere. In each
case, infarct volume was determined using the following algo-
rithm: the infarct area of 2 adjacent slices was averaged and then
multiplied by the thickness of the slice, and values were added
across all slices. A similar approach was used to determine the
volume of the nonoccluded hemisphere. Then, volume of the
infarct was expressed as a percentage of the contralateral (non-
occluded) hemisphere. To ensure reliable and unbiased estima-
tion of the infarct zone, all images were first coded and then
digitallyconvertedtoblackandwhite.Allvolumetrictraceswere
performed by an investigator blind to the codes.
Behavioral assays
Motor impairment after MCAo was assessed using the vibris-
sae-evoked forelimb placement task as well as the adhesive tape
test, using procedures reported by Selvamani and Sohrabji (10)
and Balden et al (11). The vibrissae-elicited forelimb placement
test was used both before and after MCAo surgery. Animals were
subjected to same-side and cross-midline placing trials elicited by
stimulating the ipsi- and contralesional vibrissae. During the
same-sideforelimbplacingtrials,theanimalwasgentlyheldsuch
that all 4 limbs were free to move. The animal’s ipsilesional
vibrissae were brushed against the edge of a table to elicit a
forelimb placing response, which typically involved the forelimb
ipsilateral to the stimulated vibrissae. Ten trials were performed
before the same task was repeated for the contralesional vibris-
sae. In the cross-midline placing trials, the animal was held gently
by the upper body such that the ipsilesional vibrissae lie perpen-
dicular to the tabletop and the forelimb on that side is gently
restrained as the vibrissae was brushed on the top of the table to
evoke a response from the contralateral limb and vice versa.
Between each trial, the animal was allowed to rest all 4 limbs
briefly on the tabletop to help relax its muscles. Trials in which
theanimalseemedtostruggleormakeprematureforelimbmove-
ments were not counted. Scoring during the trials was done by an
experimenter blind to the animal’s treatment group, and was
based on a 4-point scale (0–3), with a score of 3 representing
brisk forward and upward movement that ended in the paw pads
making a flat, full contact with the tabletop.
The adhesive tape test was also performed both before and
aftersurgery.Twopiecesofadhesive-backedfoamtape(1� 1⁄2”)
were used as a tactile stimuli attached to the palmar surface of the
paw of each forelimb. For each forelimb, the latency time to
remove each stimulus (tape) from the forelimbs was recorded
during 3 trials per day for each forepaw. Animals were allowed
to rest for 1 minute between sessions, and each test session had
a maximum time limit of 120 seconds.
Estradiol assay
Serum estradiol levels in terminal blood samples were mea-
sured using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman) as
per manufacturer’s protocol. Serum and standard samples (50
�L/well)wereassayedinduplicate.Assaysensitivityrangedfrom
6.6 to 4000 pg/mL. Plates were read at 420 nm in a plate reader
(BioTek), and sample measurements were interpolated from the
standard curve. The intraassay coefficient of variation was
7.2%.
IGF-1 ELISA
Concentrations of circulating insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)-1 in plasma were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, standards,
controls, and aliquots of serum samples were loaded into a 96-
well plate precoated with antibodies specific for IGF-1 and in-
cubated at room temperature for 2 hours. With intervening
washes, plates were sequentially incubated with 100 �L of con-
jugate for 2 hours, and 100 �L of substrate solution for 30 min-
utes. The color reaction was stopped by an equal volume of stop
solution and read at 450 nm (540-nm reference wavelength) in
a microplate reader (Bio-Tek). Standard curves were established
from optical densities of wells containing known dilutions of
standard (31.2–2000 pg/mL) using KC3 software (Bio-Tek), and
sample measurements were interpolated from standard curves.
For homogenized tissues, the results of these assays were nor-
malized for individual sample protein content. The intraassay
coefficient of variation was 4.3%.
Statistical analysis
Kaplan-Meier survival plots were used to assess poststroke
mortality in males and females. Quantitative measurements of
dailywheel-runningactivitywereanalyzedbytwo-wayANOVA
for sex (male, female) and LD treatment (fixed, shifted) differ-
ences. Based on survival data, infarct volume and sensorimotor
behavior were assessed further only in female subjects for sta-
tisticaldifferencesamongtreatmentgroups.Forbehavioraltests,
a paired Student’s t test was initially used within each group to
compare pre- and poststroke values. For infarct volume and be-
havioral data, group differences were evaluated using a pooled
Student’s t test. In each case, group differences were considered
significant at P � .05.
Results
During baseline exposure to LD 12:12 lighting conditions,
entrainment of the circadian rhythm of wheel-running ac-
tivity was observed in all animals. Throughout the 8-week
experimental analysis, all male and female rats in the fixed
LD treatment group maintained stable entrainment to LD
12:12 (Figure 1A) such that their daily onsets of activity
consistently occurred around 5–15 minutes after lights-off

 (6 PM). In contrast, male and female rats exposed to shifted
LD cycles were distinguished by desynchronized patterns
of wheel-running behavior in which the phase angle be-
tween the onset of activity and lights-off was highly vari-
able from day to day. In shifted LD male and female rats,
both the amplitude of the activity rhythm and the duration
of wheel-running activity were significantly (P � .05) de-
creased in comparison with fixed LD animals of the same
sex (Figure 1B). Despite these alterations in the entrain-
ment and qualitative parameters of the activity rhythm,
exposure to shifted LD cycles had no significant effect on
the total amount of daily wheel-running behavior relative
to that observed in fixed LD controls (Figure 1B) (main
effect of LD cycle; F1,35 � 0.33). Similar to the sex differ-
ences reported previously (12, 13), daily activity levels
(wheel revolutions/24 h) were significantly (main effect of
sex; F1,35 � 32.03; P � .05) and approximately 10-fold
greater in female subjects than in their male counterparts
within each treatment group.
During baseline analysis before experimental LD ma-
nipulations, regular estrous cycles with a length of 4–5
days were observed in all female rats. After exposure to
experimental lighting conditions for
40 days, all females on the fixed LD
cycle exhibited normal estrous cycles
albeit of longer duration (�7 d),
whereas
cyclicity
was
completely
abolished and smears were indicative
ofpersistentestrusinallshiftedLDan-
imals (Figure 2A). In conjunction with
this loss of estrous cyclicity and the
sustained condition of persistent es-
trus, serum estradiol levels in shifted
LD females were significantly higher
(P�.05)thanthosefoundinfixedLD
controls. Serum estradiol levels in

 Sex differences were clearly evident in the effects of
circadian desynchronization on stroke-induced patholog-
icaloutcomes.Kaplan-Meiersurvivalplotsindicatethatin
males, but not females, exposure to shifted LD cycles is
associated with a significant increase (P � .005) in mor-
tality and decrease in survival time relative to fixed LD
controls (Figure 3). Among female subjects, the rate of
mortality in response to MCAo-induced stroke was low
(20%) and identical in fixed and shifted LD animals. In
addition, there were no group differences in survival time,
with all mortalities in control and experimental females
occurring on day 2 after surgery. By comparison, male rats
exposed to shifted LD cycles were distinguished by short
survival times (1 d) and extremely high rates of mortality
(70%).
Further analysis of surviving females revealed that cir-
cadian desynchronization during exposure to shifted LD
cycles also amplified the extent of stroke-induced brain
injury and functional impairment. Based on TTC staining
in coronal sections obtained 5 days after ET-1-induced
MCAo, all surviving females in both LD paradigms ex-
hibited evidence of cortical and striatal infarction. How-
ever, females exposed to shifted LD cycles had signifi-
cantly larger (P � .05) infarct volumes compared with
fixed LD controls (Figure 4). At 5 days after MCAo, the
size of stroke-induced infarction in shifted LD females was
increased by approximately 2-fold relative to the stroke
volume observed in the fixed LD group.
Functional deficits associated with MCAo-induced in-
farction were assessed using 2 independent tests of senso-
rimotor performance. MCAo reduced accuracy on the
vibrissae-evoked paw placement task. Performance on
this task, which requires a reaching movement with the
front paw in response to stimulation
of the vibrissae, was accurate for
both paws in all animals before
stroke (Figure 5). After stroke, per-
formance in all animals was un-
changed with the ipsilesional paw,
but was significantly impaired (P �
.05) with the contralesional paw rel-
ative to prestroke standards, typical
of MCAo-induced infarction. How-
ever, the extent of this impairment

monly used in MCAo stroke models

differences
in
stroke-induced functional impairment. Consistent with
the effects of circadian desynchronization on infarct vol-
ume, MCAo-induced impairment of sensorimotor func-
tion on the adhesive removal test was more severe in
shifted LD females than fixed LD controls. No significant
pre- and poststroke differences between the fixed and
shifted LD groups were observed in the average latency for
tape removal from the ipsilesional paw. In both groups,
the latency for tape removal was increased in the contral-
esional paw after stroke (Figure 6), but the differences
between pre- and poststroke times in shifted LD females
were about 2-fold and significantly greater (P � .05) than
those observed in fixed LD controls.

 Because IGF-1 is an intermediary factor that acts syn-
ergistically with estrogen to modulate neuroprotective re-
sponses to stroke (9, 10), circulating levels of IGF-1 were
also analyzed in all animals poststroke. IGF-1 was ubiq-
uitously detected in serum from both treatment groups,
but circulating levels of this growth factor were signifi-

Specifically, exposure to shifted LD cycles reduced serum

with those observed in fixed LD
controls.
Discussion
Shift work schedules have been
linked to circadian rhythm disrup-
tion and its attendant role in chronic
heath disorders especially vascular
disease.
Among
women
in
the
Nurses Health Study, the risk of car-
diovascular disease after adjustment
for cigarette smoking and related
health factors was higher in subjects
who had worked rotating night
shifts relative to those with no shift
work experience (15). Correspond-
ing results from a Danish cohort
study indicate that the relative risk
for
cardiovascular
diseases
was
again increased among nonday workers compared with
day workers (16). Data indicating that stroke- and car-
diovascular-related, but not overall, mortality are signif-
icantly increased among male shift workers in Sweden
provides further evidence for the susceptibility of the vas-
cular system to circadian rhythm disruption (17). In sup-
port of these epidemiological observations on the link be-
tween shift work and vascular disease, the present study
demonstrates that periodic rotation of the LD cycle dis-
rupts circadian entrainment of the activity rhythm and

 increases the severity of stroke outcomes in adult rats.
Circadian rhythm disruption in response to the shifted LD
cycle was accompanied by an increase in MCAo-induced
mortality in males, whereas this exacerbated stroke sever-
ity in females such that infarct volume and sensorimotor
deficits were increased. It is noteworthy that in females,
exposure to the shifted LD cycle also abolished estrous
cyclicity, resulting in constant estrus and elevated levels of
circulating estradiol.
Stroke occurrence and severity are gated on a rhythmic
basis. In a study of cases in the Takashima Stroke Registry
with a classifiable time of onset, ischemic events were
marked by significant diurnal variation, with the largest
proportion occurring in the morning (40.7) and the lowest
during the night (14.0) even after adjustment for age, gen-
der, and risk factors (18). Furthermore, case fatality was
higher for morning strokes as compared with other times
of day. Coincident with this pattern, molecular mediators
of myocardial infarction and stroke, such as plasminogen
activatorinhibitor,peakinthemorningandmaytherefore
contribute to the time-dependent gating of infarction (19).
Stroke risk, presentation, and long-term recovery differ
in males and females; in younger demographics, more
strokes occur in men than women but with advancing age
(60� y), where stroke morbidity is much higher, women
have a greater risk for the disease with worse outcomes
(reviewed in Ref. 20). Sex differences in response to ex-
perimental ischemic stroke are also well established in an-
imal models. Young females sustain smaller infarcts and
better cerebral blood flow than age-matched males (21–
23). In the present study, circadian rhythm disruption ap-
pears to exacerbate these sex differences in stroke impair-
ments because exposure to shifted LD cycles dramatically
increased stroke-induced mortality in male but not female
rats. Ovarian hormones, especially estrogen, may mediate
the female advantage with regard to the lethal patholog-
ical effects of circadian rhythm disruption on stroke out-
comes. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by studies
demonstrating that infarct volume is increased in ovari-
ectomized females relative to intact animals or estrogen-
replaced animals (9, 24–26) and that exogenous estrogen
treatment also promotes neuroprotection in response to
stroke in males (27).
Although the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are
germane in explaining sex differences in stroke outcomes
associated with circadian rhythm disruption, other factors
may play a more critical role in stroke neuroprotection in
females than estrogen alone. In this regard, IGF-1 plays a
key role in modulating neuroprotective responses to
stroke in young females. Low levels of IGF-1 are associ-
ated with increased morbidity and mortality in ischemic
heart disease and stroke (28–30). In addition, exogenous
IGF-1 reduces ischemic injury (31–33), stimulates stroke-
induced neurogenesis (34) and promotes neuronal sur-
vival, neuronal myelination and angiogenesis (35, 36). In
the current study, increased infarct size and sensorimotor
deficits in shifted LD females were accompanied by an
apparent decrease in circulating levels of IGF-1. Because
this finding is based on single time-point analysis during
the midday coincident with the rhythmic peak in circulat-
ing levels of IGF-1 (37), the observed changes in IGF-1
levels in shifted LD females may alternatively reflect a
temporal modification in the phase of the IGF-1 rhythm.
Nonetheless, it is possible that these changes in the levels
or rhythmic pattern of IGF-1 in the circulation, coupled
with the loss of estrous cyclicity, may impose an aging
phenotype in young females that is characterized by poor
stroke outcomes.
The specific mechanisms by which circadian distur-
bances affect stroke severity and interact with other non-
modifiable risk factors to modulate the pathological ef-
fects of stroke are unknown. Stroke is an inflammatory
disease and poststroke disruption of the blood brain bar-
rier in concert with activation of systemic and brain res-
ident immune cells have been implicated in the pathophys-
iology of stroke. Hence, the immune system may be an
important target for the pathological effects of circadian
disruption on stroke. This possibility is indirectly sup-
ported by studies demonstrating that global disruption of
circadian rhythms in mice with targeted mutations in the
clock genes Per1 and Per2 potentiates the activation and
inflammatory responses of proinflammatory M1 macro-
phages, leading to increased tissue inflammation (7). It is
anticipatedthatfutureapplicationsofthismodelwillyield
novel insight into the pathophysiological changes in en-
docrine signals, cytokines and growth factors that link
disordered circadian clocks to cerebrovascular disease.
