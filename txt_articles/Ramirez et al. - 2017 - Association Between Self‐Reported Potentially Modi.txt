Risk Factors and Perceived Need to Improve Physical Health: A
Population-Based Study

Background-—An individual’s perceived need to improve their physical health (PNIPH) is an essential precursor to adopting healthy
behaviors. Nine potentially modifiable risk factors (PMRFs) for myocardial infarction collectively account for ≥90% of the population
attributable risk. Though widely recognized, their impact on individuals’ health perceptions is unclear.
Methods and Results-—Residents from 6 provinces were administered a module on changes to improve health as part of the
2011–2012 Canadian Community Health Survey, yielding relevant data for 8 of the 9 PMRFs sought. The potential effects of
PMRFs individually and cumulatively on PNIPH were examined using modified Poisson regression. In total, 45 443 respondents
were included, representing 11 006 123 individuals and corresponding to 96.8% of the adult population of the sampled provinces.
The sum of PMRFs was positively associated with PNIPH (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.07–1.09 per additional PMRF)
with 82.3% of individuals with ≥5 PMRFs reporting this perception. Smoking, obesity, and low physical activity were most strongly
associated with PNIPH, whereas hypertension and diabetes mellitus exhibited no association with this outcome after adjusting for
potential confounders. Barriers to adopting healthy behaviors were reported by 55.9% of individuals endorsing PNIPH.
Conclusions-—The cumulative burden of PMRFs is positively associated with PNIPH; however, individual PMRFs differentially
contribute to this perception. Among those at highest cardiac risk, �1 in 5 denied PNIPH. A better understanding of factors
underlying health perceptions and behaviors is needed to capitalize on cardiovascular preventive efforts. (J Am Heart Assoc.

espite decades of steady progress, ischemic heart
disease remains among the leading causes of morbidity
and mortality.1,2 Much of the progress made thus far has been
attributed to advances in acute interventions and secondary
preventive cardiovascular therapies; however, changes in risk
factor trends are estimated to account for roughly half to two
thirds of the observed improvements in developed coun-
tries.3–5 Emerging increases in prevalence of certain cardio-
vascular risk factors (particularly obesity, diabetes mellitus,
and hypertension) therefore threaten to halt or potentially
reverse these public health gains.3,6 Indeed, disproportion-
ately slower improvements or increases in mortality from
ischemic heart disease among younger demographics, par-
ticularly among women, have recently been reported, collec-
tively underscoring the need to bolster primary preventive
strategies.7–11
INTERHEART identified 9 potentially modifiable risk factors
(PMRFs) that collectively account for ≥90% of the population
attributable risk for acute myocardial infarction (MI) world-
wide: smoking, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, daily consumption of
fruits and vegetables, regular alcohol consumption, regular
physical activity, and a raised apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1
ratio. These PMRFs are associated with MI irrespective of sex
or age and exhibited a cumulative effect.12 Though they have
been well described in the medical literature and are broadly
well known among laypersons, their impact on individuals’
health perceptions and behaviors is less clear. Given that an
individual’s perceived need to change is regarded as an
essential precursor to intending and committing to behavioral
changes,13–15 these associations have important implications

 for preventive health care strategies. We therefore sought to
examine the association between individual and cumulative
PRMFs with overall physical health perceptions using data
from the 2011–2012 Canadian Community Health Survey
(CCHS). We hypothesized that PMRFs would be positively
associated with a perceived need to improve physical health
(PNIPH) both individually and cumulatively.
Methods
Data Source and Sample
The 2011–2012 CCHS was a cross-sectional survey of
Canadians aged 12 years or older conducted by Statistics
Canada (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Persons living on Indian
Reserves or Crown lands, full-time members of the Canadian
Forces, institutionalized persons, and persons living in the
Quebec health regions of R�
egion du Nunavik and R�
egion des
Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James were excluded from the survey
(collectively accounting for <3% of potential respondents). The
national combined household- and person-level response rate
was 68.4%.16 Residents from 6 provinces were administered a
survey module on changes to improve health and formed the
sample of our study. All analyses were restricted to individuals
aged 18 years or older. Individuals who refused or otherwise
did not provide an answer to the survey question relating to
the outcome of interest were also excluded.
Public Use Microdata Files were used for this study, which
contain anonymized data, underwent formal review and
approval by an executive committee of Statistics Canada,
and were made publicly available for statistical and research
purposes through the Data Liberation Initiative.16,17 Consent
was obtained from all respondents at the time of survey
administration.
Variable and Outcome Definitions
Eight PMRFs were dichotomized as present or absent.
Cigarette smoking was defined as current smoking or having
quit smoking within the preceding 12 months. Obesity was
defined by a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 as calculated
from self-reported height and weight. Low physical activity
was defined as a reported mean total daily energy expenditure
of <1.7 kcal/kg per day on transportation and leisure time
activities, which corresponds to less than moderate exercise
for 4 hours weekly (the criterion used in the INTERHEART
study12). High stress was defined as a perceived life and/or
work stress score of ≥4 on a 5-point scale (corresponding to
“quite a bit stressful” or “extremely stressful”). Hypertension
was deemed present if respondents reported that they had
“high blood pressure” as diagnosed by a health professional, if
they were “ever diagnosed with high blood pressure” by a
health professional, or if they reported having taken “any
medicine for high blood pressure” in the past month. Diabetes
mellitus was self-reported as having been diagnosed by a
health professional. Fruit and vegetable consumption was
measured as a frequency with 5 times/day used as the
cutoff.18,19 Low or moderate alcohol intake was defined as
<4 drinks/week and having consumed alcohol within the
preceding
12 months.20
Abstinence
from
alcohol
and
≥4 drinks/week were considered separately and as a com-
bined variable, when appropriate. Apo levels or other
measures of dyslipidemia were not included because only
indirect data on this PMRF were obtained in only a subset of
survey respondents.16
Important covariates (potential confounders or effect
modifiers of the association of interest) selected a priori
included age, sex, marital status, culture or racial origin,
highest level of education achieved, total yearly household
income, and having a regular medical doctor. Age was
categorized into 3 groups: 18 to 39, 40 to 59, and ≥60 years.
Marital status was classified as single, never married; married
or in a common-law relationship; or widowed, separated, or
divorced. Culture or racial origin was categorized as white or
visible minority. Highest level of education was grouped into 3
levels: less than secondary school graduation; secondary
school graduation without postsecondary education; and
some postsecondary education (with or without program
completion). Total yearly household income was divided into 3
levels: <$40 000, $40 000 to $79 999, and ≥$80 000
(Canadian dollars). Canadian dollars were comparable to US
dollars during the 2011–2012 period.
Data on smoking were missing in 0.7%, BMI in 3.4%,
physical activity in 0.7%, stress in 1.2%, hypertension in
<0.1%, diabetes mellitus in 0.1%, fruit and vegetable con-
sumption in 5.7%, alcohol intake in 1.7%, marital status in
0.2%, culture or racial origin in 3.1%, highest education level
achieved in 3.4%, household income in <0.1%, and having a
regular medical doctor in <0.1%. Data were complete for age
and sex. For all variables with ≥1% missing data, an additional
category (“unknown”) was created; otherwise, respondents
with missing data were excluded from analyses. The number
of self-reported PMRFs per respondent was calculated as their
sum, each based on responses to relevant survey questions.
The outcome of interest was PNIPH as defined by an
affirmative response to the question, “Do you think there is
anything you should do to improve your physical health?”.
Responses to follow-up questions on specific behavior
changes were used to confirm the relevance of affirmative
responses to cardiac risk. Analyses of responses to the
questions, “Is there anything stopping you from making this
improvement?”, and “What is [stopping you from making this
improvement]?” among individuals endorsing PNIPH were also
undertaken to gain insight into barriers to behavioral change.

 Statistical Analyses
The CCHS uses a complex survey design with stratification,
multiple stages of selection, and unequal probability sam-
pling,16 which was taken into consideration in point and
variance estimations.21 First, relative weights were calculated
by dividing survey weights by average weights for responses
from all respondents. Adjusted weights were then calculated
by dividing relative weights by the square root of the average
design effect, which is a mean of the coefficients of variation
for the study variables (provided by Statistics Canada22). The
use of this approximate method of incorporating the design
effect tends to yield conservative tests of significance.23
Chi-square and t tests were used to examine associations
between all variables of interest and the outcome. The
associations of individual PMRFs and their sum with the
outcome were assessed by modified Poisson regression using
a robust error variance procedure (sandwich estimation).24
Multivariable models were fit by manual forward and back-
ward selection using the change in the exposure-outcome
association and clinical judgment to guide covariate inclusion.
Adjusted prevalence ratios for combinations of PMRFs were
derived by summation of their respective model coeffi-
cients.12 Effect measure modification was assessed by
interaction terms and comparison of stratified effect mea-
sures. All analyses were performed using SAS software
(version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). An alpha level of
0.05 was used to define statistical significance (2-tailed
analyses). All continuous variables are reported as mean�SD
or median (interquartile range; IQR) and all categorical
variables as number (%). All prevalence ratios (PRs) are
provided with 95% CIs.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact
of missing values for variables with overall ≥1% missing data.
Additionally, the data were reanalyzed using a BMI criterion of
25 kg/m2 (to include overweight status as a PMRF) and a
cutoff for mean total daily energy expenditure of <1.1 kcal/kg
per
day
on
transportation
and
leisure
time
activities
(�150 min/week of moderate exercise) to define low phys-
ical activity as per the American Heart Association definitions
for ideal cardiovascular health.6 Last, all prespecified analyses
were repeated using data from the 2013–2014 CCHS, which
sampled fewer, but different, provinces.17
Results
Respondent Characteristics and Relevance of the
Outcome to Cardiac Risk
A total of 45 443 respondents were included in the analyses
after excluding 992 (2.1%) from whom the outcome of interest
was not provided and 834 (1.8%) because of missing values
for variables with <1% total missing data (Figure 1). This
sample represented 11 006 123 individuals, corresponding
to 96.8% of the adult population of the 6 provinces included
and 40.9% of the entire country. Respondents were from
Alberta (25.6%), Manitoba (8.0%), Quebec (55.4%), Nova
Scotia (6.6%), Prince Edward Island (1.0%), and Newfoundland
and Labrador (3.6%). The mean number of PMRFs was
2.5�1.0 with a median of 2 (IQR, 1–3). Mean BMI was
26.1�3.7 kg/m2.
Overall, 73.6% of individuals reported PNIPH, of which
81.1% reported an intention to improve their health in the
upcoming year. Among individuals who endorsed PNIPH,
99.8% identified a specific behavioral change as being most
important, of which increasing exercise, losing weight,
improving dietary habits, and quitting/reducing smoking
accounted for 90.7% (Figure 2A). These behaviors were also
the most commonly reported changes planned among
individuals who intended to improve their health within the
year (Figure 2B).
Exploratory Analyses
Level of education was positively associated with PNIPH in
unadjusted analyses. In contrast, older age; being widowed,
separated, or divorced; low total yearly household income;
and having a regular medical doctor were associated with a
reduced likelihood of this perception. Men and women
expressed this opinion in comparable proportions, as did
whites and those of a visible minority. Smoking, obesity, low

 physical activity, high stress, and low fruit and vegetable
consumption were positively associated with PNIPH; however,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lack of or excessive
alcohol intake were not. The sum of self-reported PMRFs was
nevertheless significantly associated with PNIPH (Table 1).
Associations Between Individual and Cumulative
PMRFs and PNIPH
Modified Poisson regression models for both individual and
the sum number of PMRFs were fit. Multivariable models
including all 8 PMRFs identified smoking, obesity, and low
physical activity as most strongly associated with PNIPH. The
association with the outcome was less marked for high stress
and low fruit and vegetable consumption. Self-reported
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and excessive alcohol con-
sumption were not associated with PNIPH whereas absti-
nence from alcohol was negatively associated with this
perception (Table 2).
Overall, each additional PMRF was associated with a PR of
1.06 (95% CI, 1.05–1.07) for PNIPH. Controlling for potential
confounders increased this PR to 1.08 (95% CI, 1.07–1.09),
with all terms in the multivariable model reaching statistical
significance except for culture or racial origin and having a
regular doctor, which did not change the adjusted PR when
removed (Table 3). All variables were kept in the final model
to generate adjusted and stratified PRs because of their
impact on the effect measure and/or clinical relevance.
Interaction terms suggested that age, culture or racial origin,
and total yearly household income modified this association
(Pinteraction≤0.025). Older individuals and those self-identifying
as white were more likely to endorse PNIPH relative to their
younger counterparts and to those self-identifying as being of
visible minorities, respectively (Table 4). Given the nonuni-
form contribution of individual PMRFs to PNIPH, specific
combinations of PMRFs were examined (Figure 3). The
combination of
all
PMRFs
(including
excessive
alcohol
consumption) was associated with a PR of 1.92 (95% CI,
1.71–2.16).
Perceived Barriers to Improving Physical Health
Barriers to adopting positive health changes were reported by
55.9% of individuals with PNIPH. The most frequently cited
barriers were a lack of will power or self-discipline, work
schedule, and family responsibilities. Cost, stress, lack of
available resources in an individual’s area, and problems with
transportation were each identified by fewer than 5%
(Figure 4).
Sensitivity Analyses
Excluding all respondents with missing data for any PMRF or
demographic variable yielded a sample size of 39 772.

 adjusted, and strata-specific adjusted effect measures for the
sum of PMRFs and for a high burden of PMRFs (≥3) remained

respectively. Redefining low physical activity as mean total

on
transportation and leisure time activities and differentiating
normal weight from overweight/obesity by using a BMI cutoff
of 25 kg/m2 resulted in an additional 2626 (5.8%) respon-
dents having ≥3 PMRFs. The weighted proportions of
individuals with ≥3 and ≥5 PMRFs reporting PNIPH were
similar at 78.5% and 80.1%, respectively, however. Adjusted
PRs of individual PMRFs for the outcome of interest remained
within 0.02 of those presented in Table 2. Similarly, the point
estimates of adjusted and strata-specific PRs for the sum of
PMRFs and for a high burden of PMRFs (≥3) again remained
within 0.01 and 0.02 of those presented in Table 4,
respectively.
The 2013–2014 CCHS had a national combined house-
hold- and person-level response rate of 66.2%.17 It adminis-
tered the relevant survey module on changes to improve
health to 4 provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova
Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, resulting in a smaller
sample size (n=26 315) after excluding those in whom the
outcome of interest was not provided and with missing values
for variables with <1% total missing data. This represented
5 227 803 individuals, which is 47.5% of the population that
was covered in the 2011–2012 version used in our main
analyses. The mean number of PMRFs was 2.4�1.0 with a
median of 2 (IQR, 1–3). Mean BMI was 26.1�3.8 kg/m2.
Weighted associations between respondent demographics or
PMRFs and PNIPH were comparable to those identified in the
2011–2012 CCHS (Table S1). Weighted crude and adjusted
PRs for individual PMRFs as well as for the sum of PMRFs and
a high burden of PMRFs were also similar (Tables 5 and 6).
Discussion
Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in North America and abroad, yet it is largely
preventable with most of the risk attributed to a small number

 of potentially modifiable, lifestyle-related factors.12 Though
the importance of primary preventive strategies is well
recognized, little is known about the association between
PMRFs and individuals’ health perceptions and behaviors. Our
study suggests (1) that the burden of PMRFs is positively
associated with PNIPH, but (2) that individual PMRFs
unequally contribute to this perception, and (3) that even
among those at highest risk (those with ≥5 PMRFs), nearly 1
in 5 do not feel that they need to improve their physical
health.
Among the PMRFs examined, smoking, obesity, and low
physical activity were most strongly associated with PNIPH.
Commensurate
with
these
associations,
the
population
attributable risks for MI of these PMRFs are substantial,
reportedly ranging from 26.1% to 59.5% for North American
men and women.12 Low fruit and vegetable consumption and
high levels of stress were modestly associated with PNIPH,
whereas this association was absent for diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and excessive alcohol consumption and was
negative for abstinence from alcohol. Similar discrepancies in
health perceptions associated with cardiovascular risk factors
have previously been reported by V€
ah€
asarja et al in their
study of Finnish individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, finding that larger waist circumference and low
physical activity were associated with a perceived need to
increase
physical
activity
levels,
but
that
smoking,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, or a family history of diabetes
mellitus were not.13
Several points are worth noting when interpreting our
results and their implications. Though beliefs about potential
harms (ie, risk perceptions) play a fundamental role in shaping
health behaviors,25 the relationship is complex26 and may be
influenced by individual dimensions of the perceived risk
(perceived likelihood, susceptibility, or severity), ease or cost
of carrying out the behavior,25 the value ascribed to the
outcome of the behavior,13 and sociocultural norms or
attitudes.27 For instance, though both smoking and obesity
were most strongly associated with PNIPH, these associations
have not equally translated into positive behavioral changes: A
continuous decline in the prevalence of smoking has been
observed in North America,28 whereas the prevalence of
obesity remains markedly high,29 may be increasing,28 and is
projected to increase further.30 The implications of these
latter trends are considerable given that elevated BMI is
associated with further weight gain over the long term,
compounding its associated risk.31 It is likely that such
disparities are a product of the above influences on the risk
perception/health behavior relationship. In effect, PNIPH is
essential, but alone may not be sufficient to bring about
health behavior change.32,33 This is consistent with the
psychological theories of behavioral change, including the
theory of planned behavior, the transtheoretical model of
change, and principles underlying motivational interview-
ing.13–15 It is also supported by smaller studies examining
the association between PNIPH and specific intended health
changes relevant to cardiac risk.34–36 In our study, nearly all
individuals endorsing PNIPH also identified a health behavior
change that was perceived as important to improving their
health; however, nearly 19% reported that they did not intend
to improve their health within the following year. Furthermore,
though more than one half of individuals with PNIPH reported
that barriers to adopting positive behavior changes existed,
the most frequently cited barrier was a lack of willpower or
self-discipline.
Current North American guidelines on physical activity
recommend considerably less exercise than the cutoff used
in the INTERHEART study (150 versus 240 minutes of
moderate exercise weekly).6,37 Using this less-demanding
criterion for high physical activity resulted in an additional
13.4% being categorized as lacking this PMRF, but did not
appreciably change its effect measure for the outcome of
interest, suggesting that physical health perceptions in this
group were comparable to those of individuals exercising
more intensely and/or frequently. In fact, though increasing
amounts of exercise generally confer increasing health
benefits, most cardiovascular gains occur with at least
150 minutes—a finding that has formed the basis of current
recommendations.6

 Though fruit and vegetable consumption is known to confer
cardiovascular benefits18,19 and pertinent dietary recommen-
dations
exist,38,39
quantifying
the
relationship
between
amount consumed and cardiovascular benefit is difficult, in
part because fruits and vegetables typically form only part of
an individual’s diet.6 Cereals, meats, dairy products, and the
fat and glycemic content of foods selected can contribute to
cardiovascular risk or benefit.40–44 Therefore, though a diet
rich in fruits and vegetables is more likely to be cardiopro-
tective and reflective of more health-conscious behavior, this
association is imperfect. Similarly, though life and work stress
were combined into 1 PMRF in our study (analogous to the
home, work, and financial stress components of the combined
psychosocial index used in the INTERHEART study12), data on
other components of that index (depression, locus of control,
and stressful life events)45 were incomplete and therefore not
incorporated, potentially resulting in an underestimation of
the prevalence and in a less-precise estimate of the effect of
the more broadly defined psychosocial PMRF. As well, data on
respondents’ medication regimens (particularly antihyperten-
sive and glycemic agents) or treatment effectiveness were not
available or deemed sufficiently reliable to include in the
study. Though self-reported diabetes mellitus has been
validated in the INTERHEART modifiable risk score model for
MI,46 the inability to adjust for this potential confounder may
account for the respective effect measures observed given
that individuals being treated for hypertension or diabetes
mellitus may have felt that these conditions were controlled.
This could have led to under-reporting of either or both
conditions while still perceiving a need to improve physical
health or incorrectly reporting the conditions, but perceiving
that their health impacts were minimized. Notably, however,
the importance of lifestyle modification irrespective of
pharmacological treatment has been emphasized, particularly
for diabetes mellitus given a lack of evidence that glycemic
control alone improves macrovascular outcomes.47 Last,
though low or moderate alcohol consumption has been
associated with cardiovascular benefits,48 the link is compli-
cated20,49 and the benefits of alcohol are offset by its well-
known potential harms, which may affect its perceived health
impact. Differing interpretations or estimations of this balance
of risk and benefit may account for the negative association
between abstinence from alcohol and PNIPH as well as for the
lack of association between excessive alcohol consumption
and PNIPH.

 contributing at all. Though these associations may suggest a
degree of public awareness of the health implications of
PMRFs in general, our study suggests that it is modest and
inconsistent,
with
a
sizeable
proportion
of
the
public
reporting that they do not feel that they should improve
their health even among those at highest cardiovascular risk.
Moreover, this association was attenuated among younger
age groups and persons identifying as being of visible
minorities—findings
that
warrant
further
investigation.
Numerous explanations may account for these findings,
including increased contact with health care providers at
older ages and cultural influences on health and/or health
care use50; however, these remain speculative given the
limitations of the data set. The statistical power afforded by
our sample size may have also identified minimal differences
in certain cases (as in our exploratory analysis). A greater
understanding of factors underlying health perceptions and
behaviors, including among these subgroups, may yield
considerable benefits.
There are several important limitations of our study. The
outcome variable selected is inherently imperfect and likely
failed to capture important nuances in health perceptions.
However, perceived need to change cardiovascular health
behavior has been assessed in analogous fashions by others
given a lack of accepted measure for this or similar latent
variables.13,34–36 Furthermore, among those with PNIPH as
defined by this variable, nearly all identified a specific lifestyle
change as being most important for improving their health,
the majority reported an intention to improve their physical
health in the next year, and nearly all the changes planned are
known to modify cardiac risk, arguing for the value of the
outcome selected. Nevertheless, a panel of questions target-
ing different aspects of health perceptions and determinants
of lifestyle behavioral change (eg, the validated Determinants

 of Lifestyle Behavior Questionnaire51) would have allowed for
a more-robust analysis. Our regression models examining the
relationship between the overall sum of PMRFs and PNIPH
assume that each PMRF contributes uniformly to the
outcome, which we show to not be the case and which
render our effect estimates less precise. However, this
analysis is relevant to clinical practice given that cumulative
PMRFs elicit greatest concern. Data on individual and specific
combinations of PMRFs are also provided. Data were
collected by self-reports and are therefore subject to
measurement error, particularly recall bias. Standardized
interviewer questionnaires and the sampling strategy used16
render interviewer and selection bias less likely. In addition,
as mentioned above, only 8 of the 9 PMRFs identified in the
INTERHEART study were assessed because a robust measure
of dyslipidemia was not collected. Given the strong associ-
ation between dyslipidemia and other PMRFs,52,53 it is likely
that its inclusion would have attenuated the exposure-
outcome associations identified. Abdominal obesity was not
included in the survey; therefore, BMI was used as a surrogate
measure, which may not optimally reflect the importance of
fat distribution on cardiovascular risk.54,55 However, BMI is
recommended and routinely used to detect and monitor
weight in clinical practice.56,57 Knowledge regarding addi-
tional comorbidities that may independently influence indi-
viduals’ opinions on the need to improve their physical health
were unaccounted for. Last, culture or racial origin was
grouped into white, visible minority, and not stated, which
limits detailed analyses of potential sociocultural influences
on health perceptions.
Conclusions
The cumulative burden of PMRFs is positively associated with
PNIPH; however, individually, PMRFs are differentially associ-
ated with this perception. A substantial proportion of
individuals at risk for cardiovascular events do not feel a
need to improve their physical health, indicating an urgent
need to identify means to modify public health perceptions
and behaviors.
