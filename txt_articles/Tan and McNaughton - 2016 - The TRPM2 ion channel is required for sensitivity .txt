Abstract
How do we detect warmth? Thermally-activated ion channels expressed in somatosensory neurons 
detect the entire thermal range from extreme heat (TRPV2), painful heat (TRPV1, TRPM3, 
ANO1), non-painful warmth (TRPV3 and TRPV4) and non-painful coolness (TRPM8) through to 
painful cold (TRPA1)1–7. Genetic deletion of each of these ion channels, however, has only 
modest effects on thermal behaviour in mice6–12, with the exception of TRPM8, whose deletion 
has marked effects on the perception of moderate coolness in the range 10°C - 25°C13. The 
molecular mechanism responsible for detecting non-painful warmth, in particular, is unresolved. 
Here we used calcium imaging to identify a population of novel thermally-sensitive somatosensory 
neurons which do not express any of the known thermally-activated TRP channels. We then used a 
combination of calcium imaging, electrophysiology and RNA sequencing to show that the ion 
channel generating heat sensitivity in these neurons is TRPM2. Autonomic neurons, usually 
thought of as exclusively motor, also express TRPM2 and respond directly to heat. Mice in which 
TRPM2 had been genetically deleted showed a striking deficit in their sensation of non-noxious 
warm temperatures, consistent with the idea that TRPM2 initiates a “warm” signal which drives 
cool-seeking behaviour.
Previous studies have described novel heat-sensitive neurons not activated by agonists for 
any of the known heat-sensitive ion channels5,14–16. We identified these neurons in 
cultures from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by using calcium imaging and selective agonists for 
known thermo-TRP ion channels. Around 10% of neurons express a novel heat-sensitive 
mechanism (see Fig 1A-C and Supplementary Information video 1). Changing the order of 
application of agonists or using a lower starting temperature had little effect on this 
proportion (Extended Data Figs. 1, 2). Novel heat-sensitive neurons were found to be 
activated over a wide range of temperatures, with a subset activated in the range of warm 
temperatures between 34°C and 42°C, suggesting a possible role in warmth sensation, and a 
second group activated only at higher temperatures (Fig. 1D, E). Novel heat-sensitive

 neurons were significantly larger than either TRPV1 expressing or TRPM3-expressing 
neurons (Extended Data Fig. 3). We investigated the possibility that the novel heat-sensitive 
mechanism may be co-expressed with TRPV1 and TRPM3 by blocking these channels with 
antagonists before applying heat; the higher proportion of neurons responding (46% in 
Extended Data Fig. 4A, compared to <10% expressing only the novel heat-sensitive 
mechanism, see Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs 1, 2, 4B) shows that there is significant co-
expression. The phenotype of neurons expressing the novel heat-sensitive mechanism was 
investigated by identifying novel heat-sensitive neurons in the presence of TRP channel 
blockers (red in Fig 5A) and then exposing to IB4, which marks a non-peptidergic neuronal 
population (green in Extended Data Fig 5B). These results show that the novel heat-sensitive 
mechanism is predominantly expressed in IB4+ neurons (74% IB4+).
We next sought to identify a source of neurons which expresses a less complex set of heat-
sensitive ion channels than are present in DRG neurons. In isolated sympathetic neurons 
from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) we found that no neuron showed an increase in 
[Ca2+]i to agonists of known thermo-TRP channels, but that 58% showed a significant 
response to heat (Fig. 2A and Extended Data Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained in 
parasympathetic neurons isolated from the pterygopalatine ganglion (PPG), in which 49% of 
neurons showed novel heat sensitivity (not shown). Autonomic neurons therefore express the 
novel heat-activated ion channel in isolation, which offers an advantageous preparation for 
determining its properties.
We found that the heat-activated calcium increase in autonomic neurons was due to an influx 
of Ca2+ from the external solution, and that it was reduced but not abolished by removal of 
external Na+ (Extended Data Fig. 6C). The TRPV channel family activator 2-APB17 
suppressed the heat-activated Ca2+ influx, and the TRPV blocker ruthenium red2 had no 
effect (Extended Data Fig. 6D, E), making it unlikely that the novel heat-activated 
mechanism is a TRPV family member. The Ca2+ influx was unaffected by the voltage-
dependent Na channel blocker TTX at a high enough concentration to block the TTX-
insensitive Na+ channels NaV1.8 and NaV1.9 (Extended Data Fig. 6F). L-type Ca2+ channel 
blockers prevented firing of action potentials during simultaneous recordings of membrane 
voltage and intracellular calcium imaging but did not completely block the heat-activated 
Ca2+ influx (Fig. 2B; see also Extended Data Fig. 6G). These observations, taken together, 
show that the heat-sensitive ion channel is permeable both to Ca2+ and to Na+, and that 
when the channel is opened by heat, the resulting depolarization activates L-type Ca 
channels and thus augments the calcium influx. The fact that membrane current through the 
novel heat-activated ion channel is carried by Na+ and Ca2+ makes it unlikely that the 
channel is ANO1, which is permeable to chloride ions6.
We next investigated the voltage- and time-dependent behaviour of the novel heat-activated 
ion channel, isolated by suppressing voltage-dependent calcium, sodium and potassium 
currents1. The current-voltage relation was approximately linear, with a reversal potential 
close to zero (Fig. 2C), and the channel showed no time-dependent gating by membrane 
voltage (Extended Data Fig. 7). Interestingly, activation of the channel by mild warmth was 
strongly potentiated by hydrogen peroxide, both in autonomic neurons (Fig. 2D) and in 
DRG neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4C, D).

 To identify the ion channel responsible for the novel heat sensitivity we carried out an 
analysis of mRNA expression (RNAseq). We investigated two sympathetically-derived cell 
lines, MAH cells18 and PC12 cells. Like primary autonomic neurons, no cell in either line 
responded to agonists of any of the conventional thermo-TRP channels, but a significant 
fraction of cells responded to heat with thermal thresholds similar to those in somatosensory 
neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8). We also found that the fraction of heat-sensitive neurons in 
both lines was reduced by differentiation to a neuronal-like phenotype (red bars, Extended 
Data Fig. 8).
The properties of mixed Na+/Ca2+ permeability, a reversal potential near 0mV and absence 
of time-dependent gating by membrane potential (see above) are consistent with a member 
of the large TRP and CNG ion channel families. RNAseq analysis of the MAH cell line 
showed that detectable mRNA was present only for the seven TRP channels shown in Table 
1, out of all TRP and CNG channels. TRPC3, TRPV2, TRPM4 and TRPM7 are unlikely 
candidates for the warmth-sensitive channel as all have non-linear IV relations19, while the 
warmth-sensitive ion channel is linear (see Fig. 2C). TRPC1 and TRPV2 are observed to be 
strongly upregulated by culture in differentiation medium (Table 1), in disagreement with 
the downregulation observed for the heat-sensitive ion channel (Extended Data Fig 8A). 
TRPV2 is activated only by extreme heat20 and TRPM4 is Ca-impermeable21, neither of 
which accords with the properties of the novel heat-sensitive ion channel. TRPC2 is a 
pseudogene in primates and seems unlikely to play an important role in behavioural warmth 
sensation, a fundamental property in all mammals. This leaves only TRPM2, which has a 
linear IV relation22, is activated at temperatures above 35°C22 and is expressed in DRG 
neurons23,24, as the most likely candidate for the warmth-sensitive ion channel. Thermal 
activation of TRPM2 is enhanced by hydrogen peroxide25 and the channel is blocked by 2-
APB26, both of which are characteristics shared by the novel heat-sensitive ion channel (Fig 
2D, Extended Data Figs. 4C, 4D and 6D).
We confirmed the identity of the novel heat-sensitive ion channel using calcium imaging 
experiments on neurons from TRPM2-/- mice27,28. The proportions of DRG neurons 
responding to TRP channel agonists were similar to those in WT neurons (Fig. 1B and 
Extended Data Figs 1C, 2C), but the proportion of novel heat-sensitive neurons was 
significantly reduced, from ~10% to around 3% (red bars in Fig. 1C; p≦0.0001, Fisher’s 
exact test, see also Extended Data Figs. 1, 2 and 4). Moreover, the mean amplitude of the 
residual heat responses in TRPM2-/- neurons not responding to TRP channel agonists was 
greatly reduced, from F340/380 = 2.336 ± 0.2060 in WT to 0.6202 ± 0.2435 in TRPM2-/- 
(Fig. 1C; p≦0.0001, two-tailed unpaired t test). Significantly, the sensitivity of the heat 
response to hydrogen peroxide was abolished by deletion of TRPM2 (Extended Data Fig 
4C, D). In experiments on the thermal thresholds of novel heat-sensitive neurons (Fig. 1D, 
E) deletion of TRPM2 abolished almost all thermal sensitivity in the range 34°C - 42°C 
(reduced from 4.4% in WT to 0.9% in TRPM2-/-, p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test), though 
some neurons still responded to temperatures in the noxious thermal range (reduced from 
15% in WT to 3.1% in TRPM2-/-, p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). We also considered the 
possibility that TRPM2 may contribute to the heat response in DRG neurons in which it is 
co-expressed with TRPV1 and/or TRPM3. Deletion of TRPM2 was found not to affect the 
maximum amplitude of the response to heat in TRPV1-expressing neurons, but it did reduce

 the response of TRPM3-expressing neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9), suggesting that co-
activation of TRPM2 and TRPM3 is important in determining the heat responses of these 
neurons. Finally, in SCG neurons from TRPM2-/- mice both the numbers and response 
amplitudes of heat-sensitive neurons were greatly reduced (Extended Data Fig 6B).
Expression of mRNA for TRPM2 was demonstrated in heat-sensitive DRG neurons using in 
situ hybridization. TRPM2 mRNA was surprisingly abundant in neurons, being expressed in 
89% of DRG neurons, but was expressed in at most a very small minority of glial cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 10). In prior tests for heat sensitivity in the same neurons, 42% of 
neurons positive for TRPM2 mRNA had responded when TRPV1 and TRPM3 were 
blocked. The reason why not all neurons positive for TRPM2 mRNA respond to heat is not 
clear, but could be due to a low conversion of mRNA into TRPM2 protein or to low 
trafficking to the membrane in around half of DRG neurons. However, many fewer neurons 
responded to heat in the population not expressing mRNA for TRPM2 (13%, see Extended 
Data Fig. 10), a figure that is consistent with the small number of heat-sensitive neurons still 
seen in DRG cultures from TRPM2-/- mice (see for example Fig 1B).
Finally we investigated whether genetic deletion of TRPM2 has an impact on thermal 
preference. The most striking behavioural difference was that WT mice avoided the non-
noxious warm temperature of 38°C, while TRPM2-/- mice showed little preference (Fig. 3C, 
E and Supplementary Information video 2). The difference became much less noticeable at 
43°C, where noxious heat avoidance mechanisms driven by TRPV1, TRPM3 and ANO1 
come into play3–9. WT mice also showed a less strong aversion than TRPM2-/- mice for the 
non-noxious cool temperature of 23°C (Fig. 3A, E). Expression of TRPM2 therefore causes 
WT mice to prefer cooler temperatures over a range of temperatures extending from 23°C to 
above 38°C, though we note that the actual temperature at the sensory nerve ending will be 
higher than the plate temperature, particularly at the lower end of this range, because of the 
influence of body temperature.
The work presented here shows that TRPM2 accounts for a novel heat sensitive mechanism 
in both somatosensory and autonomic neurons. The altered thermal preference in TRPM2-/- 
mice supports the hypothesis that TRPM2 expressed in somatosensory neurons provides a 
non-noxious “warm” signal which drives mice to seek cooler temperatures over a wide 
temperature range, from 23°C to above 38°C. Other studies have shown that TRPM8 
provides a “cool” signal which drives warmth-seeking behaviour over the range 10°C - 
25°C13, while activation of TRPV1, TRPM3 and ANO1 provide a high-temperature noxious 
heat avoidance signal3–9.
Methods
Animals
All in vitro experiments used C57BL/6 mice younger than 5 weeks old, except for adult 
DRG temperature threshold experiments (e.g. Fig. 1 C, D), in which 3 month old adult mice 
were used (these mice were from the same group as was used for two-plate thermal 
preference tests experiments, see Fig. 3). TRPM2 KO mice were kind gifts from Professor 
Yasuo Mori, and were generated as reported previously27,28. Mice were maintained on a

 12h day/12h night cycle. All mice used in two-plate thermal preference tests had been 
backcrossed onto the parental C57Bl6/6J strain for 7 generations, and WT and TRPM2-/- 
mice were littermates from breeding pairs of TRPM2+/- heterozygote mice.
Primary neuron cultures
PPG, SCG and paravertebral chain ganglia were extracted from 3 or more mice and DRG 
from a single mouse. Ganglia were incubated in papain (2 mg/ml in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free 
HBSS) for 30 min at 30°C, followed by incubation in collagenase (2.5 mg/ml in Ca2+ and 
Mg2+-free HBSS) for 30 min at 37°C. Ganglia were re-suspended and mechanically 
dissociated in Neurobasal-A/B27 growing medium, which was prepared with Neurobasal®-
A Medium supplemented with 0.25% (v/v) L-glutamine-200 mM (Invitrogen), 2% (v/v) 
B-27® Supplement (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and nerve 
growth factor (NGF) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 ng/ml. Dissociated neurons were centrifuged 
and plated onto coverslips pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (10 μg/ml) and laminin (40 μg/ml). 
Neurons were kept in a 37°C incubator with a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere for at least 3 h 
before use, and all neurons were used within 24h.
PC12 cell cultures
The growth medium used for PC12 cell culture was RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich), 
supplemented with: 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) L-
glutamine-200 mM (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) horse serum (Invitrogen) and 5% (v/v) fetal 
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). The differentiation medium for PC12 cells was RPMI-1640 
supplemented with: 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) L-
glutamine-200 mM (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) horse serum (Invitrogen), and NGF (Sigma-
Aldrich) with final concentration at 100 ng/ml. PC12 cells were incubated and maintained in 
a 37°C incubator with a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere. Medium was changed every 2 days, 
and cells were split every 3-4 days when grown to 90% confluency. The PC12 cells were 
seeded for imaging on coverslips pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) 
and collagen IV (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). PC12 cell lines were not authenticated.
MAH cell cultures
MAH cells were kind gifts from Aviva Tolkovsky and Susan Birren18. The growth medium 
used for MAH cell culture was L-15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with: 1% (v/v) 
penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) L-glutamine-200 mM (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) 
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 17% (v/v) NaHCO3 (150 mM), and dexamethasone 
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 5 μM. The cell line was not tested for mycoplasma contamination. The 
differentiation medium for MAH cells was the same as the growth medium except 
dexamethasone was replaced with a cocktail of neurotrophic factors: CNTF (10 ng/ml; 
Peprotech), bFGF (10 ng/ml; Peprotech), and NGF (50 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Medium was 
changed every 2 days and MAH cells were split every 4 days when grown to 90% 
confluency and incubated and maintained in a 37 °C incubator with a 95% air/5% CO2 
atmosphere. MAH cells used for imaging were seeded on coverslips pre-coated with poly-L-
lysine (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and laminin (40 μg/ml; BD Science). MAH cell lines were 
not authenticated.

 Extracellular solutions and perfusion system for electrophysiology
Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were carried out with extracellular solution 
containing 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES and 5 
mM glucose; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH and osmolarity was between 295-305 
mOsm. Sodium-free extracellular solution is prepared with the formulation above except for 
replacing sodium chloride with equimolar choline chloride. Calcium-free extracellular 
solution is prepared with the formulation above except for removal of calcium chloride. An 
8 line manifold gravity-driven system controlled by an automated solution changer with a 
common outlet was used to apply solution to the cells. The temperature in three lines was 
heated or cooled with a Peltier device regulated by a proportional gain feedback controller 
designed by Dr. V. Vellani (CV Scientific, Inc). The temperature in each experimental 
protocol was recorded by a miniature thermocouple immediately before the solution entered 
the bath or (in separate control experiments) at the cell location at the tip of the solution 
outlet. All compounds applied were prepared as stock solutions first and then diluted to the 
concentration needed before experiments. Capsaicin was dissolved in ethanol to make 5 mM 
stock solutions. Pregnenolone sulphate was dissolved in DMSO to make 500 mM stock 
solutions. 2-APB was dissolved in DMSO to make 500 mM stock solutions. The TRPV4 
agonist, PF-4674114, was dissolved in DMSO to make 5 mM stock solutions. Nifedipine 
was dissolved in DMSO to make 100 mM stock solutions. TTX was dissolved in pH 4.8 
citrate buffer to make 100 mM stock solutions. Verapamil, ruthenium red, and H2O2 were 
dissolved in extracellular solution on the day of experiments.
Calcium imaging
Cells were loaded with 5 μM fura-2, AM (Invitrogen) with 0.02% (v/v) pluronic acid 
(Invitrogen) in growth medium for 30 min. After loading, coverslips were put in an imaging 
chamber and transferred to a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. Cells were 
continuously perfused with extracellular solution and were illuminated with a 
monochromator alternating between 340 and 380 nm (OptoScan; Cairn Research), 
controlled by WinFluor 3.2 software (Dr. John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, 
Glasgow, UK). Emission was collected at 510 nm and the resulting pairs of images were 
acquired every two seconds with a 100 ms exposure time using an iXon 897 EM-CCD 
camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, United Kingdom). Image time series were converted 
to .tiff and processed with ImageJ software. Images of the background fluorescence intensity 
were obtained for both wavelengths and subtracted from the respective image stack before 
calculating the F340/380 ratio images. A minority of neurons (<10%) exhibited an unstable 
F340/380 baseline in the absence of any applied stimulus, usually caused by poor dye loading 
but in some cases apparently due to low-frequency repetitive firing even in the absence of 
any treatment, and were removed from analysis. In experiments to identify neurons 
responding to known TRP channel agonists (Fig. 1A), we found that PS caused a very slow 
increase in F340/380 ratio in some neurons, clearly distinguishable from the rapid elevation in 
[Ca]i seen in TRPM3-expressing DRG neurons. This slow response can probably be 
attributed to an off-target effect of PS as it was also seen in autonomic neurons which do not 
appear to express TRPM3 (Fig. 2). A positive response to all agonists was therefore defined 
from the rate of increase of [Ca]i following agonist application, as an increase of F340/380 
ratio, between two consecutive time points following application of agonist, which exceeds

 the mean + 3.09 SD (cumulative probability value of 99.9%) of all such differences in the 
absence of any agonist. A heat-sensitive neuron is defined as a neuron with a peak increase 
in F340/380 during a heat stimulus larger than the mean + 3.09 SD of the peak increase in 
F340/380 of the glial cells in the same experiment (see Fig. 1B). The thermal threshold of a 
heat-responsive neuron (see Fig. 1D, E) was defined as the temperature when the increase in 
F340/380 ratio between two consecutive time points is larger than the mean + 3.09 SD of the 
increase in F340/380 of the glial cells between two consecutive time points in the same 
experiment. For MAH and PC12 cell cultures, where no glial cells were present, we used the 
value of mean + 3.09 SD obtained from glial cells in similar experiments on neuronal 
cultures.
Supplementary Information video 1 shows an example series of calcium images.
Patch clamp recordings
The intracellular solution for concurrent calcium imaging and patch clamp (see Fig. 2B) 
contained 140 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM NaGTP, 2 mM EGTA, 10 
mM HEPES and 167 μM fura-2; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The intracellular 
solution for current-voltage relationship determination, in which Ca2+ and K+ currents were 
blocked (see Fig. 2D), contained 130 mM CsCl, 2.5 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM NaGTP, 10 mM 
HEPES, 10 mM TEA, and 5 mM 4-AP; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. The osmolarity 
of both of the intracellular solutions was between 295-305 mOsm. The extracellular solution 
for current-voltage relationship determination contained 125 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 
mM HEPES and 5 mM glucose, 10 mM TEA, 5 mM 4-AP, 2μM tetrodotoxin, and 100 μM 
CdCl2.
All patch clamp experiments were carried out with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier 
(Axon Instrument, USA). Patch pipettes (Blaubrand 100 μl borosilicate glass, Scientific 
Laboratory Supplies, Germany) were pulled using a Flaming/Brown P-97 horizontal 
micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, USA) and had a resistance between 3 and 5.5 MΩ. 
A giga-ohm seal was formed between the patch pipette and the cell membrane and the 
pipette capacitance transients were cancelled before achieving the whole cell configuration. 
All experiments were begun in voltage clamp mode with holding potential at -60 mV at the 
time of entering whole cell mode. After entering the whole-cell mode, series resistance was 
adjusted to be lower than 20 mega-ohm. Resting membrane potential was tested and only 
neurons with membrane potentials more negative than -50 mV were used for recording. Data 
were acquired and analysed with pClamp10 software (Axon Instruments, USA) and whole 
cell currents and voltages were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.
RNA-seq
MAH cells were trypsinized and collected as a cell pellet prior to lysis. RNA extraction was 
performed with the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. 2 samples from MAH cells grown in growth medium and 2 samples from MAH 
cells grown in differentiation medium were sent to Oxford Gene Technology to complete the 
rest of the steps for RNA-sequencing. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the Illumina 
TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2. A total of 4 samples (two cold-sensitive MAH cells and

 two cold-insensitive MAH cells) were sequenced on 2 lanes on the Illumina HiSeq2000 
platform using TruSeq v3 chemistry. All sequences were paired-end and performed over 100 
cycles. Read files (Fastq) were generated from the sequencing platform via the 
manufacturer's proprietary software. Reads were processed through the Tuxedo suite. Reads 
were mapped to their location to the appropriate Illumina iGenomes build using Bowtie 
version 2.02. Splice junctions were identified using TopHat, version v2.0.9. Cufflinks 
version 2.1.1 was used to perform transcript assembly, abundance estimation and differential 
expression and regulation for the samples. Visualisation of differential expression results 
were performed with CummeRbund. RNA-Seq alignment metrics were generated with 
Picard.
In situ hybridization following calcium imaging
Coverslips were marked on the periphery with a diamond knife to assist localization of the 
imaged region and were then calcium-imaged as above to identify novel heat-sensitive 
neurons. Following calcium imaging, coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS) then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C for 20 min. TRPM2 mRNA was 
detected with Digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes against mouse TRPM2 (NM_138301.2). 
We are very grateful to Prof. Yasuo Mori of Kyoto University for providing the mouse 
TRPM2 gene cloned into the pCI-neo plasmid (Promega).
Probe synthesis—For the TRPM2 antisense probe the plasmid was linearized with EcoRI 
and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase and for the TRPM2 sense probe, which was used 
as a negative control, the plasmid was linearized with SalI and transcribed with T7 RNA 
polymerase.
Hybridization—Fixed coverslips were rinsed in PBS with 0.1% Triton, and were then 
incubated in in situ hybridization solution without probe at 47°C for 30 min as pre-
hybridization step. After pre-hybridization, coverslips were transferred into in situ 
hybridization solution with antisense or sense probes for hybridization at 47°C overnight29.
Post-hybridisation steps—Following hybridization coverslips were washed in 2 x SSC 
and then 0.2 x SSC at 47 °C for 30 min for each solution. Coverslips were then washed 
twice with KTBT solution at room temperature for 5 min for each washing. 25% normal 
goat serum was then used for blocking cells for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were 
then incubated in 25% normal goat serum containing pre-absorbed anti-digoxygenin 
antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washing 
3x in KTBT for 15 min each wash, and then twice in alkaline phosphatase buffer at room 
temperature for 10 min each wash. Coverslips were then developed in alkaline phosphatase 
buffer containing 337.5 μg/ml NBT and 175 μg/ml BCIP in the dark for 8 h before being 
washed in KTBT, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, washed in PBS, and then mounted in 
29SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI. DIC transmitted-light images were 
acquired through a Plan Fluor 10x Ph1 DLL objective with a DS-Qi2 monochrome camera 
on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. A GFPHQ filter was used to enhance the dark 
purple color. The images were rotated, cropped, and resized with ImageJ to be aligned with 
the images obtained in calcium imaging.

 Staining for isolectin B4 (IB4) following calcium imaging
DRG neurons on marked coverslips were calcium imaged as above then rinsed with 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C for 20 
min. After fixation, coverslips were washed twice in PBS with 0.1% Triton then incubated in 
solution containing 10 µg/ml IB4 bound to Alexa Fluor 594, 10% normal goat serum, 2% 
bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton, and 10 mM sodium azide for 1 h at room temperature 
followed by washing with PBS three times. DIC transmitted-light images were acquired 
through a Plan Fluor 10x Ph1 DLL objective with a DS-Qi2 monochrome camera on a 
Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. A Texas Red HYQ filter was used to capture the 
Alexa 594 signal. The images obtained were rotated, cropped, and resized with ImageJ to be 
aligned with the images obtained in calcium imaging.
Two-plate thermal preference tests
To eliminate as far as possible any extraneous genetic influences the TRPM2-/- mice were 
backcrossed onto the parental C57Bl6/6J line for 7 generations27,28. To minimize 
environmental effects, WT and TRPM2-/- littermates from heterozygous matings were 
compared in behavioural experiments. Sample size to achieve significance was determined 
from trial experiments, and all mice were tested at all temperatures (see Fig. 3 legend). We 
used a two-plate thermal preference test with one plate maintained at a temperature of 33°C, 
which other studies have shown is the preferred temperature11, and the other at a variable 
temperature. The temperatures of test and control plates were reversed after 30min to control 
for any influence of environmental cues. Other studies have observed sex differences in 
mouse thermal behaviour12 so we followed other authors5,11 in using only adult males 
(10-16 weeks old) in behavioural experiments.
Two hot/cold-plate machines (Bioseb, France), placed back to back, formed the two-plate 
thermal apparatus. Plates were enclosed in a plexiglass chamber divided into two lanes, with 
an opaque compartment between them, and two mice were tested simultaneously in adjacent 
lanes (see Supplementary Information video 2). The temperature of each plate was 
controlled by T2CT software (Bioseb, France). Plate temperatures were tested with an 
infrared thermometer (Bioseb) and were found to be accurately controlled to within 0.2 °C 
of the command temperature over the entire plate area. One plate was maintained at the 
preferred temperature of 33°C, and mice were initially placed onto the plate with starting 
temperature other than 33°C (“plate A”, see Fig. 3) before initiating recording. The 
movements of the mice between the two plates were recorded for 3495 seconds without 
human presence and the mouse position was determined with an automated video tracking 
system (Bioseb), so operator blinding was not necessary. The temperatures of the two plates 
were exchanged 1800 seconds after initiation of recording; plate temperature settled to 
within 0.2°C of the new temperature within 180s of the change. Experiments were 
performed between 8am and 10pm with room temperature at 20°C. All mice were tested at 
all temperatures, so randomization for the purposes for group allocation was not needed. For 
experiments testing thermal preference between the two mildest temperatures, 28°C vs 33°C 
and 33°C vs 38°C, mice were tested again, with the starting temperatures of the two plates 
exchanged, 3-5 h after the first recording. For other temperatures recordings were made only 
once on a particular mouse. Mice were tested with the protocols, in order, of 28°C vs 33°C,

 33°C vs 38°C, 23°C vs 33°C and 33°C vs 43°C. Sample size was based on pilot 
experiments. When making statistical comparisons variances were checked to ensure that it 
was similar between groups being compared. All animal experiments were approved by the 
Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB), King’s College London.

A. Method for detecting novel heat-sensitive somatosensory neurons. Representative traces 
showing increases of [Ca2+]i (F340/380 ratio, ordinate) in DRG neurons in response to the 
TRPV1-3 agonist 2-APB (250μM), to the specificTRPV4 agonist PF-4674114 (V4 agonist, 
200 nM), to the specific TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (Caps, 1μM), to the TRPM3 agonist 
pregnenolone sulphate (PS, 100μM), to a heat ramp from 35°C to 46°C (temperature 
protocol shown at bottom), and to KCl (50 mM). Other details as in Fig. 1. From top:

 TRPV1-expressing neuron responding to 2-APB, capsaicin (1 μM) and heat (red, 30% of 
500 neurons); TRPM3-expressing neuron responding to PS (blue, 100 μM) and heat (18%); 
TRPV1- and TRPM3- co-expressing neuron responding to 2-APB, PS, capsaicin, and heat 
(brown, 10%); neuron unresponsive to TRP channel agonists but showing a response to heat 
and therefore expressing a novel heat sensitive ion channel (black, 8% of total). No neuron 
responded to the specific TRPV4 agonist PF-4674114 (200nM).
B. Heat has a small effect on the fura-2 fluorescence ratio30, so we eliminated neurons in 
which an increase of fluorescence ratio was due simply to this physical effect by comparing 
the increase of fura-2 fluorescence ratio in neurons with that in glial cells in the same 
culture. Maximum increases in F340/380 ratio in response to a heat ramp from 35°C to 46°C 
in WT glial cells (black bars, top, n=60) and in WT DRG neurons not responding to known 
thermo-TRP agonists (black bars, bottom, from same images as the glial cells in top panel, 
n=139). Vertical black dashed line in top panel shows mean + 3.09 SD (cumulative 
probability value of 99.9%) of the increase in the F340/380 ratio in glial cells; this value is 
taken as the maximum increase in F340/380 ratio caused by effect of heat on fura-2 and is 
used as the cut-off value for defining novel heat-sensitive neurons present in the same 
culture dish (vertical black dashed line in lower panel). Similar results from separate culture 
of TRPM2-/- glia (n = 40) and neurons (n= 76) shown in red. The proportion of novel heat-
sensitive neurons was significantly reduced from 8% (41/500) in WT to 0.4% (1/282) in 
TRPM2-/- (p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). The increases in F340/380 ratio of novel heat-
sensitive neurons above the cut-off value in response to heat (smallest increase = 0.019854) 
are all higher than that of the single heat-responding TRPM2-/- neuron (0.019084).
C. Pie charts showing the percentage of novel heat-sensitive neurons responding to TRP ion 
channel agonists and to heat in WT DRG neurons (left) and DRG neurons from TRPM2-/- 
mice (right). Deletion of TRPM2 reduces the percentage of novel heat-sensitive neurons 
from 8% to 0.4%.
Cell numbers: A,B,C: 500 DRG neurons from one WT mouse on 3 coverslips and 282 DRG 
neurons from one TRPM2-/- mouse on 2 coverslips were imaged. No further replicates 
performed.

neurons did not respond to any of the agonists nor to heat (not shown). No neuron responded 
to the specific TRPV4 agonist PF-4674114 (200nM).
B. Maximum increases in F340/380 ratio in response to a heat ramp from 30°C to 46°C in WT

known thermo-TRP agonists (black bars, bottom, from same images as the glial cells in top 
panel, n=103). Vertical black dashed line in top panel shows mean + 3.09 SD (cumulative 
probability value of 99.9%) of the increase in the F340/380 ratio in glial cells; this value is 
taken as the maximum increase in F340/380 ratio caused by effect of heat on fura-2 and is 
used as the cut-off value for defining novel heat-sensitive neurons present in the same 
culture dish (vertical black dashed line in lower panel). Similar results from separate culture 
of TRPM2-/- glia (n = 60) and neurons (n= 73) shown in red. The proportion of novel heat-
sensitive neurons was significantly reduced from 7% (103/491) in WT to 2% (73/522) in 
TRPM2-/- (p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). The mean increase in F340/380 ratio of novel heat-
sensitive neurons above the cut-off values in response to heat was also significantly reduced 
from 1.237 ± 0.09207 in WT (n=36) to 0.7959 ± 0.03767 in TRPM2-/- (n=8) (p=0.0313;

 Extended Data Fig. 3. Diameters of novel heat-sensitive DRG neurons compared to neurons 
responding to other TRP agonists.
A. Diameters of 1324 DRG neurons taken from experiment illustrated in figure 1A (dotted 
line). Subpopulations of neurons are shown as follows: those responding to capsaicin and 
thus expressing TRPV1 (red); to PS and thus expressing TRPM3 (blue); to both agonists and 
thus co-expressing TRPV1 and TRPM3 (brown); to 2-APB alone (green); novel heat-
sensitive neurons (orange), and neurons responding neither to heat nor to any of these 
agonists (black).
B. Diameter comparison of subpopulations of neurons. TRPV1-expressing neurons have the 
smallest mean diameter (18.58 ± 0.17μm), TRPM3-expressing neurons are intermediate 
(21.75 ± 0.33μm) and neurons expressing only the novel heat-sensitivity have the largest 
mean diameter (25.47 ± 0.48μm). Significance from one-way ANOVA and multiple 
comparisons with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (****: ≦0.0001; ns: not significant).

 the cut-off values (dashed lines) in response to heat was also significantly reduced from 
1.619 ± 0.06133 in WT (n=265) to 1.027 ± 0.08394 in TRPM2-/- (n=175) (p≦0.0001; two-
tailed unpaired t test). In similar experiments with TRPV1 blocker BCTC (4μM) and 
naringenin (10μM), 37% of WT neurons responded to heat (data not shown, n = 554).
B. Similar plot as in A, but data from the subgroup of novel heat-sensitive neurons not 
responding to agonists for known thermo-TRP channels. After exposure to heat in presence 
of blockers of TRPV1 and TRPM3, blockers were removed and neurons not responding to 
known TRP agonists were identified as in Fig. 1A. Data from same experiment as shown in 
A. Proportion of neurons expressing the novel heat-sensitive mechanism in isolation (i.e. 
without co-expression of TRPV1 or TRPM3) was significantly lower (52/580, 9%) than all 
neurons expressing the novel heat sensitive mechanism (46%, see A). The proportion of 
novel heat-sensitive neurons was significantly reduced in TRPM2-/- mice, from 9% to 0.6% 
(6/1007, p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test).
C. Temperature ramp to 42°C. Few novel heat-sensitive neurons respond to this low 
temperature in either WT or TRPM2-/-. Total numbers of neurons n=173 for WT, n=211 for 
TRPM2-/-.
D. Responses of same neurons to same temperature ramp to 42°C following addition of 
H2O2 (400μM). Enhancement of response in WT (black bars) largely abolished in TRPM2-/- 
(red bars). The proportion of novel heat-sensitive neurons after sensitization with H2O2 was 
significantly reduced from 11% (74/635) in WT to 8% (48/601) in TRPM2-/- (p=0.0356; 
Fisher’s exact test). The mean increase in F340/380 ratio of novel heat-sensitive neurons 
above the cut-off values in response to heat was also significantly reduced from 1.175 
± 0.1516 in WT (n=72) to 0.4485 ± 0.04329 in TRPM2-/- (n=48) (p=0.0002; two-tailed 
unpaired t test).
Cell numbers and replicates. A, B: 580 DRG neurons from one WT mouse on 5 coverslips 
and 1007 DRG neurons from one TRPM2-/- mouse on 5 coverslips were imaged for the 
protocol with AMG9810. 554 neurons from one WT mouse on 4 coverslips were imaged for 
the protocol with BCTC. No further replicates.
C, D: 635 DRG neurons from one WT mouse on 3 coverslips and 601 DRG neurons from 
one KO mouse on 3 coverslips were imaged. Experiment was replicated with similar results

percentage of IB4-positive neurons is significantly higher in the heat-sensitive group than in 
the heat-insensitive group (p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). Note that the diameters shown in

heat to 47°C (temperature protocol shown at bottom); and KCl (50 mM). Similar results 
obtained with parasympathetic neurons from pterygopalatine ganglion (PPG, data not 
shown). Trace is same as shown in Fig. 2A.
B. Similar histograms as in Extended Data Figs. 1B and 2B, but for SCG glial cells and 
neurons from WT mice (black bars) and TRPM2-/- mice (red bars). 58% of WT SCG 
neurons (n=436) showed novel heat-sensitivity with increases in F340/380 ratio above the 
criterion level obtained from glial cells (n=80) in same culture (black vertical dashed line). 
In similar experiments on PPG neurons (n=484), 47% showed novel heat-sensitivity (not 
shown). Red bars and red dashed line show results from SCG glia (n=80) and neurons 
(n=430) from TRPM2-/- mice. The proportion of novel heat-sensitive neurons was 
significantly reduced by deletion of TRPM2, from 58% (252/436) in WT to 12% (53/430) in 
TRPM2-/- (p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). The mean increase in F340/380 ratio of heat-
sensitive neurons above the cut-off values in response to heat was also significantly reduced, 
from 1.629 ± 0.1928 in WT (n=252) to 0.5050 ± 0.1270 in TRPM2-/- (n=53) (p=0.0086; 
two-tailed unpaired t test).
C. Heat-evoked Ca2+ increase in SCG neurons is reduced but not abolished by removal of 
extracellular Na+ (replaced with choline) and is abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+ 
(remaining small increase in F340/380 ratio is due to temperature sensitivity of fura-2, see 
part B). Similar results seen in 133 SCG neurons.
D. Heat-evoked Ca2+ increase in SCG neurons is blocked by TRPV agonist 2-APB (25μM). 
Similar results seen in 130SCG neurons.
E. Ca2+ increase in PPG neurons is not affected by TRPV channel blocker ruthenium red 
(50μM). Similar results seen in 75 PPG neurons.
F. Ca2+ increase in PPG neurons is not affected by the Na channel blocker TTX (2μM). 
Similar results seen in 35 PPG neurons.
G. The Ca2+ influx in PPG neurons is reduced but not eliminated by the L-type Ca2+ 
channel blocker verapamil (100μM). Similar results seen in 30 PPG neurons.
Cell numbers and replicates. A: 166 SCG neurons from three WT mice on 3 coverslips were 
imaged. B: 436 SCG neurons from two WT mice on 4 coverslips and 430 SCG neurons 
from two TRPM2-/- mice on 4 coverslips were imaged. Similar results as those shown for 
WT obtained with 15 further coverslips of SCG neurons from 9 WT mice and 7 coverslips 
of PPG neurons from 6 WT mice. C: 133 SCG neurons from 3 WT mice on 5 coverslips

of cells responded to heat with increase above mean criterion level obtained from glial cells 
in neuronal cultures (see Fig. 1B). Red: similar histogram after 12d culture in growth factors

responded to heat. The proportion of heat-sensitive cells was significantly reduced from 27%

 The 66% reduction in the proportion of heat-sensitive cells was not significantly different 
from the reduction in TRPM2 expression caused by differentiation of MAH cells (Table 1 
line 5; p = 0.056; two-tailed unpaired t test). The mean increases in F340/380 ratio above the 
cut-off values (dashed lines) in response to heat were 1.755 ± 0.1255 in dexamethasone 
(n=69) and 1.420 ± 0.1474 in presence of growth factors (n=16) (p=0.2203; two-tailed 
unpaired t test).
B. PC12 cells. Black: culture in growth medium (10% horse serum + 5% fetal bovine serum, 
n=200). 93% of cells responded to heat with increase above mean criterion level obtained 
from glial cells in neuronal cultures (see Fig. 1B). Red: Effect on heat responses of 12d 
culture in NGF (1% horse serum plus 100 ng/ml NGF, n = 108). The proportion of heat-
sensitive cells was significantly reduced from 93% (186/200) in growth medium to 46% 
(50/108) in NGF (p≦0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). We note that a significantly lower 
expression of mRNA for TRPM2 in differentiated PC12 cells has been reported31. The 
mean increase in F340/380 ratio above the cut-off values (dashed lines) in response to heat 
was significantly reduced from 3.753 ± 0.2431 in growth medium (n=186) to 2.603 ± 0.3104 
in NGF (n=50) (p=0.0213; two-tailed unpaired t test).

function of diameter with sense probe (5μm bins) was used as threshold criterion for 
significant expression of TRPM2 in images of antisense hybridization. A similar analysis of 
non-specific density was carried out for glial cells.

 B. Representative DIC transmission image with antisense probe against TRPM2. Using the 
threshold criterion as function of diameter obtained from sense probe images (see A), 89% 
(1121/1250) of DRG neurons but 3% (4/120) of glial cells were positive for TRPM2 mRNA.
C. Novel heat-sensitive DRG neurons determined using calcium imaging. Increases in 
[Ca2+]i (F340/380 ratio image, intensity-coded in red) in response to a heat ramp to 46°C with 
TRPV1 blocked with AMG9810 (5μM) and TRPM3 blocked with naringenin (10μM).
D. Superimposed image of novel heat-sensitive neurons (red) and in situ hybridization using 
antisense probe. Solid red arrows indicate novel heat-sensitive neurons also positive for 
TRPM2; solid black arrow shows neuron not responding to heat but positive for TRPM2; 
open black arrow shows cell negative for TRPM2 (i.e. with density below the criterion level 
obtained from E). 42% (92/218) of DRG neurons positive for TRPM2 exhibited novel heat-
sensitivity. However only 13% (2/16) of DRG neurons negative for TRPM2 from in situ 
hybridization exhibited novel heat-sensitivity. The percentage of novel heat-sensitive DRG 
neurons is significantly reduced in TRPM2 negative DRG neurons (p=0.0188; Fisher’s exact 
test). Scale bars shown on right lower corner indicate 50 μm.
E. Density of non-specific label in neurons obtained from hybridization with sense probe 
(see A) depends on cell size. Data used to calculate significance thresholds for neurons in B.
Cell numbers and replicates. A: One coverslip exposed to sense probe was used as negative 
control. B: All neurons on 5 coverslips were measured and one coverslip was measured for 
TRPM2-positive glial cells; C, D: One coverslip was analysed as in A and B for the 
combined calcium imaging and in situ hybridization protocol. E: 500 DRG neurons on one 
coverslip exposed to sense probe was used to determine the background threshold as a 
function of cell diameter. Similar in situ hybridization results obtained on 16 further 
coverslips.

A. Sympathetic neurons from superior cervical ganglion (SCG) respond to heat but not to 
TRP channel agonists.
B. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (10 μM) blocks spiking but not steady 
depolarization in response to heat in a patch-clamped PPG neuron (top) and reduces but does 
not eliminate the Ca2+ increase (middle). Simultaneous recording of membrane potential and 
[Ca2+]i (F340/380 ratio) in current–clamped PPG neuron.
C. Current-voltage relations at 36°C and 47°C of voltage-clamped PPG neuron in response 
to voltage ramp shown top left. Similar IV relation observed with inverse voltage ramp 
starting from 100mV (Extended Data Fig. 7). See Methods for details.
D. H2O2 (400μM) potentiates Ca2+ increase in response to a mild temperature stimulus 
(42°C) in SCG neurons. Note potentiation is long-lasting after H2O2 removed. Similar 
results obtained in PPG neurons. Percentage of neurons (n=456) responding to heat, 
determined as in Extended Data Fig. 1B, was 5% before, 59% during and 54% post-H2O2.

 Figure 3. Deletion of TRPM2 shifts adult male mouse thermal preference towards warmer 
temperatures.
A-D: Two-plate thermal preference test. One plate is at 33°C at the start of the experiment, 
the other (“plate A”) is at a variable temperature as shown above each graph. Temperature 
reversed at t= 30min to account for any possible bias caused by external cues. Points show 
mean behavioural preference averaged over 5 min intervals (error bars mean ± SEM, n = 11 
for WT and 9 for TRPM2-/-). Mice were WT or TRPM2-/- male littermates, 12-16 weeks of 
age. No difference observed between the thermal behaviour of WT and heterozygous 
TRPM2+/- mice (not shown, n = 4).

Table 1
mRNA levels of TRP ion channel genes in MAH cells in growth medium containing 
dexamethasone (5 μM) and in differentiation medium containing growth factors bFGF 
(10 ng/ml), CNTF (10 ng/ml) and NGF (50 ng/ml).
All genes within the TRP channel family and the six cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels (CNGA1-4, 
CNGB1, and CNGB3) were examined. The seven genes listed are the ones whose mRNA levels are detectable 
in MAH cells in either condition. FPKM is fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads. The 
p values give significance of change of expression using one-way Anova; q-values are post-hoc corrected for 
multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method. Two biological replicates in each condition 
were deep-sequenced.
