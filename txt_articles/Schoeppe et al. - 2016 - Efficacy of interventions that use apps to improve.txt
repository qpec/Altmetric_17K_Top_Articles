Abstract
Background: Health and fitness applications (apps) have gained popularity in interventions to improve diet,
physical activity and sedentary behaviours but their efficacy is unclear. This systematic review examined the efficacy
of interventions that use apps to improve diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children and adults.
Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted in five databases to identify papers published between
2006 and 2016. Studies were included if they used a smartphone app in an intervention to improve diet, physical
activity and/or sedentary behaviour for prevention. Interventions could be stand-alone interventions using an app
only, or multi-component interventions including an app as one of several intervention components. Outcomes
measured were changes in the health behaviours and related health outcomes (i.e., fitness, body weight, blood
pressure, glucose, cholesterol, quality of life). Study inclusion and methodological quality were independently
assessed by two reviewers.
Results: Twenty-seven studies were included, most were randomised controlled trials (n = 19; 70%). Twenty-three
studies targeted adults (17 showed significant health improvements) and four studies targeted children (two
demonstrated significant health improvements). Twenty-one studies targeted physical activity (14 showed
significant health improvements), 13 studies targeted diet (seven showed significant health improvements) and five
studies targeted sedentary behaviour (two showed significant health improvements). More studies (n = 12; 63%) of
those reporting significant effects detected between-group improvements in the health behaviour or related health
outcomes, whilst fewer studies (n = 8; 42%) reported significant within-group improvements. A larger proportion of
multi-component interventions (8 out of 13; 62%) showed significant between-group improvements compared to
stand-alone app interventions (5 out of 14; 36%). Eleven studies reported app usage statistics, and three of them
demonstrated that higher app usage was associated with improved health outcomes.
Conclusions: This review provided modest evidence that app-based interventions to improve diet, physical activity
and sedentary behaviours can be effective. Multi-component interventions appear to be more effective than stand-
alone app interventions, however, this remains to be confirmed in controlled trials. Future research is needed on
the optimal number and combination of app features, behaviour change techniques, and level of participant
contact needed to maximise user engagement and intervention efficacy.

 Background
The prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 dia-
betes is a major public health goal worldwide [1]. In
2012, NCDs were responsible for 38 million (68%) of the
world’s 56 million deaths [1]. Lifestyle behaviours includ-
ing diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour are
key modifiable risk factors for these diseases and im-
proving these behaviours is considered essential to redu-
cing the financial and health burden of these NCDs [1].
Unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and sedentary behav-
iour are known to track from childhood into adulthood
and are difficult to change later in life [2, 3]. This exacer-
bates associated health problems and demonstrates why
preventing the development of these health risk factors
throughout the lifespan is important.
Given the global scale of NCDs, preventative interven-
tions that can reach large populations at low cost are
needed. Smartphones and tablets, including the software
applications (apps) that run on these devices, have be-
come an integral part of people’s life with large increases
in usage rates since their introduction in 2007 [4, 5]. For
example, 70% of Americans, 61% of Europeans and 74%
of Australians regularly use a smartphone and/or tablet
[5, 6]. The growth in mobile technologies has also stim-
ulated the growth in health and fitness apps to provide
behavioural interventions that can reach large popula-
tions [7]. Clever use of apps in health promotion and
prevention of disease has enabled researchers to apply
health behaviour changes techniques (e.g., goal setting,
self-monitoring, performance feedback) that have proven
to facilitate health behaviour change across diverse
population groups and settings [7, 8].
Despite the increasing use of apps in health behaviour
change studies their efficacy is unclear, particularly for
different lifestyle behaviours such as diet, physical activ-
ity and sedentary behaviour, as well as for specific popu-
lation
groups
including children
and adults. Some
systematic reviews [9–13] have addressed the potential
of health apps to improve diet, physical activity and/or
sedentary behaviour. However, the scope of these re-
views has been broad and many questions remain.
Firstly, most previous reviews [9–11, 14] were on elec-
tronic and mobile health (e-& mHealth) interventions,
not specifically on app-based interventions. Secondly,
many reviews [7, 8, 15–18] have focused on app design,
the incorporation of established behaviour change tech-
niques and they examined intervention feasibility rather
than efficacy. Thirdly, many previous reviews [19–22]
have focused on the use of apps for the treatment of
obesity and chronic diseases. As such, little is known
about the potential of using apps to change health be-
haviours for disease prevention. Finally, no reviews have
distinguished between app interventions for children
versus adults. This is important as app features appeal-
ing to children and adolescents may differ from those
used by adults, and the choice of app features will likely
determine user engagement, retention and ultimately
intervention efficacy [22].
This review aimed to address these gaps in the litera-
ture by systematically synthesising evidence for the effi-
cacy of interventions that use apps to improve diet,
physical activity and sedentary behaviour for NCD pre-
vention. Since app features used by children may differ
from those used by adults, we distinguished between
app interventions targeted to children and adults.
Methods
Literature search
This review was conducted and reported according to
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Additional
file 1) [23]. Systematic searches were conducted be-
tween November and December 2015 in five data-
bases: Scopus, CINAHL, SportDiscuss, PsycINFO and
Web of Science. The search was limited to English
language literature, humans, and the year of publica-
tion between 01 January 2006 and 31 October 2016.
It was considered unlikely that app interventions were
developed before 2006/2007 when smartphones were
introduced. Systematic search strategies were designed
using a combination of thesaurus and free terms cov-
ering the following terms: application, app, smart-
phone,

eating, food, fruit, vegetable, snack, soft drink, car-
bonated beverage, intervention, program, programme,
health promotion, prevention and trial. The detailed
search strategies used for each database are presented
in the Additional file 2. Additionally, articles were
identified via hand-searching and reviewing reference
lists of relevant papers.
Inclusion criteria and study selection
Studies were included in the present review if (1) they
used an app in an intervention to influence at least one
of the following lifestyle behaviours: dietary intake, phys-
ical activity, sedentary behaviour; (2) targeted children
and/or adults; (3) focused on behaviour change for dis-
ease prevention (i.e., not specifically aiming to treat and
manage health conditions such as obesity, hypertension
and NCDs); and (4) reported data regarding efficacy for
behaviour change (e.g., change in daily minutes of phys-
ical activity). In addition, studies could also report (but
were not required) other relevant outcomes that may
Schoeppe et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2016) 13:127

 have conceivably been impacted by health behaviour
change (i.e., fitness, body weight, blood pressure, glu-
cose, cholesterol, quality of life). All types and units of
measurements for the lifestyle behaviours and related
health outcomes were acceptable (e.g., objective meas-
ure,
self-report,
minutes,
steps,
servings,
calories,
kilograms). The app intervention could be a stand-alone
intervention using apps only, or a multi-component
intervention where the use of an app was one of several
intervention
components
(e.g.,
physical
education,
provision of physical activity equipment, parental educa-
tion, face-to-face counselling). Studies were excluded from
the review if: (1) non-experimental study designs were uti-
lised (i.e., observational or case studies, studies reporting
prevalence or trend data, feasibility studies, measurement
studies, theoretical papers); and (2) the publication was
not a peer-reviewed primary study (i.e., letters, commen-
taries, conference proceedings, reviews, narrative articles).
Initially, titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by
a single reviewer (SS). As per best practice for systematic
reviews [23], two reviewers (SA, WVL) independently
reviewed the eligibility of studies for inclusion in the re-
view, with disagreement resolved by discussion and con-
sensus with a third reviewer (SS).
Data extraction
Data extraction was conducted using a standardised form
developed specifically for this review (Table 1); similar to
those used in other systematic reviews [12, 24, 25]. For all
included studies, data were extracted for author, year,
country, study design, intervention duration, measure-
ment time points, attrition rate, sample, behaviour change
theory, app features including behaviour change tech-
niques, intervention components, outcomes, measures
and main study results. The primary outcome measures
extracted for main study results were dietary intake, phys-
ical activity and sedentary behaviour. Other relevant out-
come
measures
closely
related
to
these
behaviours
included weight status (body mass index, body weight,
waist circumference), fitness, blood pressure, cholesterol,
glucose and quality of life. To determine whether the in-
terventions had a significant effect on behavioural and
health outcomes, data on significance and magnitude of
within- and between-group differences was extracted. For
each included study, two reviewers independently ex-
tracted data (NAB and either SS, SA or WVL). Reviewers
one and two agreed on the data extraction in over 70% of
the studies. Disagreement was easily resolved by discus-
sion and consensus with a third reviewer (either SS,
SA or WVL).
Study quality assessment
The quality of the included studies was assessed using
25-point criteria adapted from the CONSORT checklists
for the reporting of randomised controlled trials [26].
While the CONSORT checklist is intended for con-
trolled trials, most criteria are applicable to other study
designs and the weaker study designs justifiably received
a lower score than studies using a controlled trial design.
This approach has been used in other reviews [24]. Each
criterion was rated as 1 (fulfilled), 0.5 (not all sub-items
making up the criterion were fulfilled), 0 (not fulfilled or
unclear), or not applicable (criterion was not applicable
to the study design). Not applicable criteria were dis-
counted from the ‘overall study quality score’ (sum of
points). Hence, the highest attainable quality score was
not 25 for all studies. Adapted from previous reviews
[27, 28], the obtained study quality score for each study
was divided by the highest attainable score and multi-
plied by 100 to give a percentage of fulfilled criteria; and
studies were then grouped into high (>66.7%), fair (50–
66.6%) or low (<50%) study quality (Additional file 3).
The study quality assessment was conducted independ-
ently by two reviewers (SS, SA), with disagreement re-
solved by discussion and consensus with a third reviewer
(WVL). Percent agreement between reviewers one and
two for the scoring of the CONSORT criteria was 89%,
with the most common points of discrepancy relating to
recruitment methods, outcomes reporting and blinding
procedures.
Results
Study selection
A flowchart of the study selection process is presented
in Fig. 1. A total of 6926 publications were identified
from the database search. After removal of duplicates,
4945 publication titles and abstracts were screened, and
194 full-text articles were considered potentially eligible
for inclusion. Of these, 30 articles reporting data on the
efficacy of an app-based intervention to improve diet,
physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour for pre-
vention were included for final review. Some articles
[29–34] reported on the same studies, and as such, a
total of 30 articles describing 27 studies were in-
cluded in this review.
Study characteristics
Characteristics of the app intervention studies included
in this review are presented in Table 1.
Twelve studies were conducted in North America
[35–46], seven studies in Australia/New Zealand [29–32,
47–51], seven studies in Europe [33, 34, 52–57], and one
study in the Middle-East [58]. Most studies were rando-
mised controlled trials (n = 19) with 2-group [29, 31,
35, 40, 43–46, 48, 50, 52–55, 58] or 3-group [33, 34,
42, 47, 56, 57] study designs. The remaining studies
were controlled trials (n = 3) [33, 37, 49], randomised trials
(n = 1) [39] or pre-post studies (n = 4) [36, 38, 41].

 Twenty-three studies [31–36, 38, 39, 41–46, 48–58] tar-
geted adults (mean age: 41.5 years, range: 18–71 years)
and four studies [29, 37, 40, 47] targeted children or ado-
lescents (mean age: 12.4 years, range: 8–17 years). The
total number of participants across the 27 studies was
2699 (510 children/adolescents, 2189 adults). Samples
sizes ranged from 17 to 502 (mean sample size: 100). The
duration of interventions ranged from 1–24 weeks, with
an average intervention duration of 10 weeks. Follow-up
assessments were at 4 weeks (n = 5), 8 weeks (n = 8),
12 weeks (n = 9), 20 weeks (n = 2), 6 months (n = 2),
9 months (n = 1) and 18 months (n = 1). Attrition rates
ranged from 0% [36] to 57% [51], with an average attrition
rate of 17%. The majority of studies [31, 33, 35–45, 47, 48,
50, 53, 55–58] reported higher rates of female participa-
tion (on average 64% of participants were female). The tar-
geted health behaviours were dietary intake (n = 13),
physical activity (n = 21) and sedentary behaviour (n = 5).
Other reported lifestyle-related health outcomes were:
weight status (n = 11); fitness (n = 3); blood pressure
(n = 4); blood glucose (n = 1); cholesterol (n = 1); and
quality of life (n = 2). Ten studies [33, 36–38, 43–45,
49, 50, 55, 57] targeted a single health behaviour,
whilst 17 studies [29, 31, 35, 39–42, 46–48, 50–56, 58] tar-
geted multiple health behaviours and related health out-
comes. Fourteen studies [33, 37–40, 42, 45–47, 51, 52,
55–57] involved interventions delivered solely via an app
(stand-alone intervention) and 13 studies [29, 31, 35, 36,
41, 43, 44, 48–50, 53, 54, 58] involved interventions that
used apps in conjunction with other intervention strat-
egies (multi-component intervention), such as physical
education, parental education,
counselling sessions,
printed materials, motivational emails, websites and
pedometer use. Fifteen studies [29, 31, 36–39, 45, 46,
48–50, 52, 56–58] used a newly designed app in the
intervention and 12 studies [33, 35, 40–44, 47, 51,
53–55] used a commercially available app. Further, 15
of the 27 studies reported intervention designs based on
behaviour change theories, such as Self-determination
Theory (n = 3) [29, 35, 37], Transtheoretical Model (n = 4)
[31, 33, 41, 48], Social Cognitive Theory (n = 4) [29, 39, 44,
46], Theory of Planned Behaviour (n = 2) [45, 50], Control
Systems Theory of Self-regulation (n = 1) [58], and the
Behaviour Change Wheel (n = 1) [55].
Study quality
A detailed summary of quality assessments of included
studies is presented in the Additional file 3. Overall,
study quality ranged from high (n = 11) [29, 31, 43–45,
47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 58], to fair (n = 8) [35, 37, 46, 49, 55–
57], and low (n = 8) [33, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 51, 52]. Study
quality of interventions targeted to children/adolescents
was high (n = 2) [29, 47] and fair (n = 2) [37, 40], and
study quality of interventions targeted to adults ranged
from high (n = 9) [31, 44, 45, 48, 50, 53, 54, 58], to fair
(n = 6) [35, 46, 49, 55–57], and low (n = 8) [33, 36, 38,

 39, 41, 42, 51, 52]. Most of the 13 interventions that
used an app in combination with other intervention
strategies were of high quality (n = 9) [29, 31, 43, 44, 48,
50, 53, 54, 58], whilst most of the 14 stand-alone app in-
terventions were of fair (n = 6) [37, 40, 46, 55–57] or low
quality (n = 6) [33, 38, 39, 42, 51, 52]. Study quality did
not differ markedly between app interventions targeting
multiple health behaviours and related health outcomes
(high: n = 8, fair: n = 4, low: n = 5) and those targeting
a single health behaviour (high: n = 3, fair: n = 4, low:
n = 3). On average, the included studies fulfilled 61%
of
the
assessment
criteria
(range:
34–92%).
Most
studies met the CONSORT requirements to provide a
strong scientific rationale and described their partici-
pant eligibility, statistical methods and interventions
clearly. Fewer studies reported sample size calcula-
tions [29, 31, 35, 43, 47, 50, 53–55, 57, 58] and in-
cluded randomisation [29, 31, 35, 37, 39, 43–48, 50,
52–55, 58] and blinding procedures [31, 44–50, 53] in
their study design. Attrition rates were reported or
could be calculated for the majority of studies [29, 31, 33,
35–51, 53–58].
Intervention efficacy
A summary of intervention effects for the included life-
style behaviour outcomes (diet, physical activity, sedentary
behaviour) and related health outcomes (weight status, fit-
ness, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, quality of life)
are presented in Table 2. Overall, a slightly larger propor-
tion of single health behaviour interventions (5 out of 10;
50%) [33, 45, 49, 55, 57] showed significant between-
group improvements than multiple health behaviour inter-
ventions (7 out of 17; 41%) [29, 31, 48, 50, 53, 54, 58]. Fur-
ther, a larger proportion of interventions that used an app
in conjunction with other intervention strategies (8 out of
13; 62%) demonstrated significant between-group im-
provements in the behavioural and health outcomes
[29, 31, 48–50, 53, 54, 58] compared to stand-alone
app interventions (5 out of 14; 36%) [33, 40, 45, 55, 57].
Children and adolescents
Of the four studies that specifically targeted children
and/or adolescents, one study [29] reported significant
between-group improvements in diet, sedentary behav-
iour and fitness in the app intervention group. Another
study [37] reported a significant within-group increase
in physical activity, but no significant difference between
groups. The remaining two studies [40, 47] reported no
significant changes in the behavioural or related health
outcomes.
Adults
Of the 23 studies that targeted adults, 17 studies re-
ported significant improvements in diet (n = 6) [31, 38,
45, 54, 57, 58], physical activity (n = 13) [31, 33, 36, 37,
39, 41, 43, 48–50, 53–55, 58], sedentary behaviour (n = 1)
[39], and other improved outcomes including weight sta-
tus (n = 4) [31, 41, 42, 58], 49], fitness (n = 1) [56], blood
pressure (n = 2) [41, 56] and cholesterol (n = 1) [41]. Of
the studies reporting significant findings, 11 studies de-
tected significant between-group differences in diet (n = 5)
[31, 45, 54, 57, 58], physical activity (n = 9) [31, 33, 48–50,
53–55, 58] and weight status (n = 2) [31, 58] in favour of
the app intervention group. Seven studies found signifi-
cant within-group improvements in diet (n = 1) [38],
physical activity (n = 4) [33, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43], seden-
tary behaviour (n = 1) [39] and weight status (n = 2)
[41, 42, 56], blood pressure (n = 2) [41, 56] and chol-
esterol levels (n = 1) [41]. Five studies [35, 44, 46, 51, 52]
reported no significant changes in the health outcomes of
interest, and no significant findings were found in relation
to the outcome glucose levels (assessed in one study).
Characteristics of efficacious interventions
App interventions showing significant between-group
improvements in the behavioural and health outcomes
tended to be multi-component interventions [31, 36, 41,
43, 48–50, 53, 54, 58], with sample sizes above 90 partic-
ipants [35, 43, 44, 47–49, 53] and intervention durations
longer than 8 weeks [37, 42–45, 47, 49]. A slightly larger
proportion of single health behaviour [33, 45, 49, 55, 57]
versus multiple health behaviour interventions [29, 31,
48, 50, 53, 54, 58] demonstrated between-group im-
provements (50% versus 41%, respectively). Further,
most of the interventions [29, 31, 33, 39, 42, 45, 48–
50, 53, 55, 56, 58] showing significant improvements
in
the
behavioural
and
health
outcomes
included
goal-setting, self-monitoring and performance feed-
back in the app design. Some efficacious interventions
also incorporated other behaviour change techniques,
such as motivational messages [29, 36, 57], health
education/tailored advice [29, 31, 38, 48, 54, 57],
reinforcement [33, 39, 40, 45], gamification in the
form of exergames, award and rewards [37–40, 50],
social support through interaction with peers [33, 37,
50] and friendly team challenges [29, 37, 39, 45].
There was not enough data to identify which behav-
iour change techniques determined intervention efficacy.
Moreover, there was no difference in the behaviour
change techniques incorporated in apps for children com-
pared to those used in apps for adults. Eleven studies
[31, 38, 40, 43, 45, 48–50, 54, 56–58] out of the 19
studies showing significant improvements in behav-
ioural and health outcomes reported usage statistics
to determine participants’ engagement with the app.
Three of these studies [38, 43, 49] examined associa-
tions between app usage and changes in the behav-
ioural and health outcomes. Their findings showed that
Schoeppe et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2016) 13:127 
Page 20 of 26
 higher app usage was associated with improvements in
physical activity and healthy eating [38, 43, 49].
Discussion
This systematic review found modest evidence for the
efficacy of app interventions to improve diet, physical
activity and sedentary behaviours for NCD prevention.
Overall, 19 out of the 27 identified studies reported sig-
nificant improvements in behavioural and related health
outcomes. Most of these studies reported significant
between-group improvements in the app intervention
group versus comparison group, which is considered the
gold standard to demonstrate intervention efficacy [59].
Notwithstanding study limitations, the findings from this
review indicate that apps can be an effective tool to im-
prove health behaviours. The advantages of smartphone
apps over other intervention delivery modes such as
websites, face-to-face counselling and group sessions
may partially explain the efficacy of app interventions.
Given that many people have busy lifestyles, they value

 convenient access to health behaviour change programs
that provide information and advice, real-time self-
monitoring, feedback, reinforcement, social support, and
rewards ‘on the go’ [60]. The appeal of smartphones for
assistance in health promotion concurs with the trend
that more people are seeking health information via mo-
bile devices [61, 62]. In this context, apps provide the
opportunity to bring behavioural interventions into real
life situations where people make decisions about their
health.
Despite the potential of apps, half of the interventions
identified in this review used apps in conjunction with
other intervention strategies. The remaining interven-
tions were stand-alone interventions where the app was
the sole intervention component. Importantly, however,
is the observation that most of the multi-component
interventions demonstrated significant between-group
improvements in behavioural and health outcomes,
whereas fewer stand-alone app interventions reported
significant between-group improvements. This raises the
question whether multi-component interventions yield
stronger intervention effects than stand-alone app inter-
ventions. Many reviews of health behaviour change in-
terventions [63–67] recommend the use of multiple
intervention strategies to achieve long-term health be-
haviour change. Reviews of website-delivered interven-
tions [9, 28, 68] have also shown stronger behaviour
change effects when combined with other intervention
strategies such as SMS, telephone coaching and motiv-
ational emails. As such, it is likely that the integration of
apps in multi-component interventions produces stron-
ger health outcomes compared to stand-alone app inter-
ventions; however, this remains to be tested in future
trials.
The majority of app interventions were targeted to
adults; only four out of the 27 identified app interven-
tions were specifically aimed at children or adolescents.
This is consistent with previous e & mHealth reviews
[11, 12, 25, 69] showing that internet and mobile phone
delivered interventions have mainly targeted adult popu-
lations. Although smartphones and tablets have become
an integral part of children’s lives [70], surprisingly few
interventions
have
yet
utilised
app
technology
in
pediatric health behaviour change programs [12]. How-
ever, as exergame and serious game apps are becoming
increasingly popular among children and adolescents
[71], it is likely that more app studies focussing on chil-
dren will be conducted in the near future.
The average attrition rate (i.e., participant loss to
follow-up) reported in the app interventions was 17%,
which is lower compared average attrition rates of 23–
27% found in web-based interventions [28, 68, 72].
Lower participant attrition indicates less bias in the esti-
mated intervention effects [73]. However, participant
attrition does not capture participants’ engagement with
the app intervention which also determines intervention
effects. For example, web- and app-based interventions
that have examined participant engagement found that
higher levels of website and app usage were associated
with increased intervention efficacy [38, 43, 68]. Despite
this, less than half of the studies reported usage statistics
to determine participants’ engagement with the app.
This is consistent with previous reviews [24, 28, 68]
reporting that few internet and mobile interventions re-
corded participants’ engagement with the intervention
technologies. Given the relative ease by which app usage
statistics can be tracked, it is unfortunate that this data
is not being collected and published for all studies in this
area. We know that participant engagement, measured
by number of website logins, usually declines after the
first few weeks in website and social media interventions
[24, 28, 68]. An example is the Australian 10,000 Steps
program, a successful, freely available web- and app-
based intervention to promote physical activity [61]. Par-
ticipants’ engagement with the 10,000 Steps website and
app lasts on average 5–6 weeks, with longer usage dur-
ation (on average 8 weeks) being observed in people
who use both the 10,000 Steps website and app [61].
This rapid decline in usage concurs with qualitative re-
search showing that people often lack commitment to
using any particular app and they tend to engage in only
transient, casual app use [60]. Since participant engage-
ment determines intervention exposure, and level of
intervention exposure determines intervention efficacy
[28, 61, 74], better understanding of factors that improve
participant engagement and retention is needed.
To increase user engagement with health behaviour
change apps, more information is needed about what
app features and behaviour change techniques people
value and use. Recent focus group data showed that
[60, 75] that young people value health behaviour
apps that require low effort, are pleasant to use, are
developed by credential experts, enable self-monitoring,
provide advice on how to change behaviour, include posi-
tively framed alerts/reminders (but not too frequent), pro-
vide accurate tracking functions, incorporate adequate
privacy settings, and clearly show what the app will do (no
surprises). Some of these user preferences were part of the
efficacious apps identified in this review. For example,
most apps included goal-setting, self-monitoring and per-
formance feedback [29, 31, 33, 39, 42, 45, 48–50, 53, 55,
56, 58]. Additionally, some apps incorporated tailored ad-
vice, motivational prompts and reinforcement, gamifica-
tion, social support or friendly team challenges [29, 33,
37–40, 45, 48, 50, 54, 57]. Reviews of web-based interven-
tions have demonstrated that interventions including
more behaviour change techniques are more effective
[74, 76]. This may also apply to app-based interventions.
Schoeppe et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2016) 13:127 
Page 22 of 26
 However, it remains unclear what the optimal number
and combination of app features and behaviour change
techniques is to increase user retention and ultimately
intervention efficacy. It is also possible that efficacy de-
clines when too many features or techniques are imple-
mented. Furthermore, socio-demographic factors (e.g.,
sex, age, education) and psychosocial factors (e.g., atti-
tudes, perceived benefits, enjoyment) may also influence
app usage [60]. Emerging research on the adoption of app
technology showed that higher app usage is associated
with being female and of younger age [61, 77], as well as
with personal interest in new technologies, positive atti-
tudes towards smartphone apps and perceived benefit of
use [77]. Therefore, targeting and tailoring smartphones
apps to specific population groups may also enhance the
efficacy of app-based interventions.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this systematic review are that it was con-
ducted and reported according to PRISMA guidelines
[23], and study quality was systematically assessed using
the CONSORT checklist [26]. The search strategy was
comprehensive, and study selection, data extraction, and
quality rating were completed by two independent re-
viewers, as is standard practice for high quality system-
atic review [23]. These procedures ensure accuracy of
the reviewed data. The scope of this review was limited
to app interventions improving behavioural and related
health outcomes for prevention; hence app interventions
relating to chronic disease treatment were not captured
in this review. Few app interventions identified in this
review focused on dietary and sedentary behaviours
which makes it more difficult to draw conclusions on
the efficacy of app interventions targeting these behav-
iours, as opposed to those targeting physical activity be-
haviour. Furthermore, the included studies varied widely
in terms of methodological quality, with some studies
scoring very poorly, thereby reducing the trust that can
be placed in their findings. Finally, the possibility of pub-
lication bias should also be acknowledged. As with all
systematic reviews examining the efficacy of interven-
tions, it is possible that some studies with null findings
have not been published [78].
Recommendations for future research
Based on this review, it is recommended that future
studies:
� Test the efficacy of specific app features and
behaviour change techniques in high quality
controlled trials to distinguish effective from
ineffective intervention components.
� Directly compare the efficacy of stand-alone app
intervention compared to multi-component
interventions that use apps in combination with
other intervention strategies.
� Compare the efficacy of app interventions to other
intervention delivery modes, such as website, print-
based and face-to-face interventions.
� Utilise larger sample sizes to ensure they are sufficiently
powered to detect significant intervention effects.
� Tailor app interventions to specific population
groups (e.g., women, young people) in whom usage
and adoption of app technology is high.
� Report app usage statistics using objective and
self-report measures to examine levels of and
reasons for participant (dis)engagement and
intervention exposure.
� Explore the optimal duration and intensity of app
interventions to ensure user engagement and
retention as the intervention progresses.
� Identify factors that increase user engagement and
retention in app interventions to sustain behavioural
health improvments in the long-term.
� Investigate the relationship between user engagement
and intervention efficacy, whilst taking into account
socio-demographic and psychosocial factors.
Conclusions
Interventions using apps to improve diet, physical ac-
tivity and sedentary behaviour for prevention show
promise for effective behaviour change in children
and adults. The evidence base is largest for the use of
apps to increase physical activity in adults. Fewer in-
terventions have used apps to improve dietary and
sedentary behaviours, and very few app interventions
have targeted children and adolescents. Multi-component
interventions that combine apps with other intervention
strategies appear to be more effective than stand-alone
app interventions, however, this remains to be tested
further in controlled trials. Overall, there is still con-
siderable scope to improve the efficacy of app-based
interventions. In particular, intervention studies should
gather more app usage statistics to identify factors that
improve user engagement and retention, and its relation-
ship with intervention efficacy. In addition, more forma-
tive research is needed to determine the optimal number
and combination of app features, behaviour change
techniques, and level of participant contact needed to
maximise user engagement and ultimately intervention
efficacy.
