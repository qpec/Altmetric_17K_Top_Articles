AbsTrACT 
background Clinical assessments and rehabilitation 
in athletic groin pain (AGP) have focused on specific 
anatomical structures and uniplanar impairments rather 
than whole body movement.
Objective To examine the effectiveness of rehabilitation 
that targeted intersegmental control in patients with 
AGP and to investigate post rehabilitation changes in 
cutting biomechanics.
Methods Two hundred and five patients with AGP 
were rehabilitated focusing on clinical assessment of 
intersegmental control, linear running and change of 
direction mechanics in this prospective case series. Hip 
and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) was the primary 
outcome measure. Secondary measures included pain-
free return to play rates and times, pain provocation on 
squeeze tests and three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical 
analysis during a 110° cutting manoeuvre.
results Following rehabilitation, patients 
demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in 
HAGOS scores (effect size (ES): 0.6–1.7). 73% of 
patients returned to play pain-free at a mean of 9.9 
weeks (±3.5). Squeeze test values also improved 
(ES: 0.49–0.68). Repeat 3D analysis of the cutting 
movement demonstrated reductions in ipsilateral trunk 
side flexion (ES: 0.79) and increased pelvic rotation in 
the direction of travel (ES: 0.76). Changes to variables 
associated with improved cutting performance: greater 
centre of mass translation in the direction of travel 
relative to centre of pressure (ES: 0.4), reduced knee 
flexion angle (ES: 0.3) and increased ankle plantar flexor 
moment (ES: 0.48) were also noted.
Conclusions Rehabilitation focused on intersegmental 
control was associated with improved HAGOS scores, 
high rates of pain-free return to sporting participation 
and biomechanical changes associated with improved 
cutting performance across a range of anatomical 
diagnoses seen in AGP.
InTrOduCTIOn
Athletes with athletic groin pain (AGP) frequently 
present with single or multiple painful anatomical 
sites in the groin.1 2 Coexisting painful structures 
along with a lack of histological pathology studies3 
make it challenging to identify a specific diagnosis 
on which to focus treatment.1 Attempts have 
been made to group painful structures by both 
anatomy4 and entity,2 but the descriptive termi-
nology in use remains both wide and confusing,5 
and there have been recent attempts to simplify 
using expert consensus.6 
No clear differences in outcomes on return 
to play (RTP) times or rates, between surgical 
intervention and rehabilitation, were found in a 
recent systematic review.7 The success of exer-
cise-based rehabilitation for AGP has been docu-
mented.8 9 Programmes targeting lumbopelvic 
control and muscle strength, focusing on adductor 
strengthening, have been compared with manual 
therapy10 and with rest and active recovery11 with 
good outcomes at long-term follow-up.12 These 
studies commonly included patients with a single 
anatomical presentation: adductor-related groin 
pain. This limits their generalisability in treating 
athletes presenting with other entities.7 10 11
Outcome measures used to assess interven-
tions in AGP include patient-reported outcome 
measures such as the Hip and Groin Outcome 
Score (HAGOS), and strength and pain prov-
ocation measures such as adductor squeeze 
testing.13 14 To date, despite multiplanar move-
ment patterns (such as change of direction and 
high-speed sprinting) being reported as provoca-
tive activities in athletes with AGP
,15–18 these have 
not been used as outcome measures. The physical 
demands of acceleration and braking (common 
in field sports) are not evenly distributed across 
the hip, knee and ankle but depend heavily on 
the relationship between the centre of mass and 
centre of pressure.19 20 This complex relationship 
is not controlled by a single muscle group that can 
be targeted in isolation.
Three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis enables 
the evaluation of complex multiplanar, multi-
joint movements.21 22 While performing a cutting 
manoeuvre, patients with AGP could be character-
ised into three distinct movement strategies (clus-
ters). These biomechanical clusters did not correlate 
with a specific site of groin pain.23 An individual 
athlete’s risk of developing AGP is likely linked 
to a combination of individual risk factors such as 
training load, recovery and sport/position.24–26 We 
hypothesise that an athlete’s movement strategy 
may also be part of this equation, leading to a 
biomechanical overload resulting in symptoms. As 
a result, an intervention focusing on intersegmental 
control is a novel approach to rehabilitation in AGP
.
The aim of this study was to describe the outcome 
of a rehabilitation programme focusing on interseg-
mental control, in consecutive patients who presented 
with a variety of anatomical diagnoses relating to AGP
. 
The primary outcome measure used was the HAGOS 
questionnaire. Secondary measures included RTP

tation intervention would be effective across all clinical outcomes 
irrespective of anatomical diagnosis.
MeThOds
Three hundred and twenty-two male patients who presented to 
the sports medicine department of Sports Surgery Clinic, Dublin, 
from January 2013 to May 2015 were assessed for eligibility in 
this study. Patients presented to the clinic independently or by 
third-party referral. Of the 322 patients, 205 were eligible for 
inclusion in the study (figure 1). All patients signed informed 
consent. The methodology of the study reported is in keeping 
with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies 
in Epidemiology guidelines.27
diagnostic assessment
A sports and exercise medicine physician performed an injury 
history (including sport participation and duration of symptoms) 
and clinical examination, which included initial interpretation 
of MRI to make an anatomical diagnosis and exclude pathology 
unsuitable for rehabilitation. The clinical assessment, radio-
logical findings and differential diagnostic process have been 
detailed elsewhere.1

Inclusion criteria
All patients reported pain in the anterior hip and groin area 
during their chosen sporting activity, and symptom duration 
was greater than 4 weeks. All patients had a stated intention of 
returning to the same level of preinjury participation in compet-
itive multidirectional sport. All patients with an anatomical diag-
nosis falling under AGP (iliopsoas, adductor, pubic aponeurosis 
and hip) were included as per Falvey et al.1
Exclusion criteria
Patients with hip joint arthrosis (grade 3 or higher on MRI28); 
those who did not intend to return to preinjury activity levels; 
those who could not commit to completing the rehabilitation 
programme as prescribed due to time or equipment/facility 
constraints; and those with underlying medical conditions such 
as inflammatory arthropathy or infection were excluded.
Patients eligible for inclusion completed the HAGOS question-
naire as the primary outcome measure on initial assessment and on 
discharge to RTP
, which has been shown to be a reliable measure 
(Intraclass Correlation: 0.82–0.91), with a smallest detectable 
change at group level of 2-7-5.2 and an SE of measure of 6.4–12.2.29
Clinical assessment
Those patients eligible for inclusion underwent a physical assess-
ment with a senior physiotherapist documenting pain provoca-
tion tests using crossover test17 and squeeze tests at 0°, 45° and 
90°,30 and the symmetry of hip internal rotation at 90° hip flexion 
with a goniometer (Saehan). The pressure (mm Hg) at onset of 
the patient’s groin pain and maximum pressure achievable were 
recorded using a sphygmomanometer (DS66, Welch Allyn), which 
was set at a pretest pressure of 20 
mm Hg. The reliability of the 
squeeze test has been shown previously (ICC: 0.89–0.92) with an

SE of measurement between 1.6% and 3.3%,30 and these tests have 
been reported as valid for use in clinical research on groin pain.31
biomechanical assessment
Subsequently patients underwent 3D biomechanical analysis 
of a 110° cut (figure 2). The cutting task was performed at the 
patient’s perceived maximal effort for each trial. The approach 
speeds are reported to demonstrate comparability. The reliability 
(ICC >0.85), validity and methodology of this test have been 
reported previously.21 23 32 The biomechanical variables included 
in the analysis were joint angles and internal joint moments, joint 
powers (rate at which joint work is done) and joint work (change 
in angle multiplied by change in moment) for all three anatom-
ical planes. Details regarding the method of calculation of these 
variables have been described previously.23
Intervention
The rehabilitation programme consisted of three levels. 
 
Level 1 addressed intersegmental control and strength (figure 3), 
level 2 involved linear running mechanics and increasing linear 
running load tolerance (linear A) (figure 4), and level 3 targeted 
multidirectional mechanics and the transition back to high inten-
sity sprinting (linear B) (figure 5). The rehabilitation interven-
tion is reported in detail in accordance with the Template for 
Figure 5 Intersegmental control focus of multidirectional drills (the figure demonstrates the intersegmental control the drills targeted).

Intervention Description and Replication checklist and guide33 
in online supplementary appendix A. The exercise selection 
was dictated by the patient’s physical competency (ie. ability to 
perform the exercise with appropriate technique), and progres-
sion through the programme was individualised according to 
each patient achieving key goals for progression (figure 6).
Patients whose symptoms were not improving during reha-
bilitation in spite of improving segmental control were referred 
back to the sports medicine physician for review and were 
considered to have failed rehabilitation. Patients who withdrew 
were contacted regarding their reason for withdrawal.
Patients completed the HAGOS questionnaire after rehabili-
tation and pain-free RTP
, and where possible pain provocation 
testing and 3D biomechanics were also repeated. Patients were 
cleared to RTP in their chosen sports once they had passed 
through the three rehabilitation levels and demonstrated symp-
tom-free completion of linear A and B and multidirectional 
drills. Time to RTP was to their first full participation in training/
competition after being cleared. Where secondary testing 
revealed symptoms on squeeze testing or residual biomechan-
ical asymmetries during cutting, in spite of pain-free completion 
of the running programme, further follow-up was performed. 
This was to ensure complete resolution of these deficits before 
discharge from the programme.
statistical analysis
Data analysis was carried out using SPSS V
.21.0 to report 
descriptive statistics for patient data. Spearman’s rank correla-
tion was used to correlate RTP time and duration of symptoms 
prior to rehabilitation. One-way analysis of variance was used 
to calculate the difference in RTP time between anatomical 
diagnoses and movement clusters at initial assessment. Paired 
samples t-test was used to analyse the change in HAGOS and 
squeeze test scores after rehabilitation. To examine if differences 
exist between the kinematic and kinetic measures post rehabil-
itation, statistical parametric mapping (1D, paired t-test) was 
used.34 Effect sizes were calculated in a point-by-point manner, 
and reported according to Cohen’s d (d>0.3 =  
small; d>0.5 
=  
medium; d>0.7 =  
strong).35 Data processing and statistical 
parametric mapping were performed using MATLAB (R2015a, 
MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).
resulTs
T
wo hundred and five patients entered rehabilitation (24.9 ± 5.1 
years; 179.4 ± 5.8 cm; 80.4 ± 9.2 kg), with a median duration 
of symptoms of 32 weeks (IQR: 20–52 weeks) and participated 
across a range of field sports (table 1). The most commonly 
identified anatomical diagnoses were pain or tenderness at 
the pubic aponeurosis (64%), which was superior to the pubic 
symphysis, with 17% adductor, 15% hip and 4% iliopsoas, with 
 20% reporting bilateral symptoms.
Fifty-five patients (27%) commenced the rehabilitation 
process but did not complete repeat Hip and Groin Outcome 
Score. Eight of these patients’ symptoms failed to resolve during 
rehabilitation and were removed from the study (pubic aponeu-
rosis=5; adductor=2; hip=1.) Reasons reported for dropout 
prior to discharge included desire to return to play in spite of 
remaining symptoms (n=6), geographical travel issues to clinic 
for review (n=7) and other commitments (n=8), with the rest 
non-contactable for reason of non-return (n=26) despite efforts 
to do so by email and telephone (figure 1).

hAGOs questionnaire
A significant improvement across all subsections of HAGOS was 
seen post intervention (table 2). 
squeeze test
A significant improvement in squeeze tests was demonstrated at 
all three angles, with 94% (105/112) of patients achieving pain-
free squeeze at 0°, 45° and 90° on RTP (table 3).
rTP rates and times
The pain-free RTP rate of those who entered the study was 73% 
(150/205), with patients attending 5.1 (±1.5) appointments 
prior to RTP
. There was no difference in time to RTP based on 
anatomical diagnosis (p=0.56), and there was no correlation 
between duration of symptoms prior to rehabilitation and time 
to RTP (p=0.17).
Changes in 3d biomechanical analysis of cutting
Biomechanical analysis of a 110° cutting manoeuvre (n=112) 
using the previously described cluster analysis23 during initial 
assessment placed 43% in cluster 1, 21% in cluster 2% and 36% 
in cluster 3, with no significant difference in RTP times between 
the clusters (p=0.57).
Comparative analysis displayed significant changes in post-
rehabilitation kinetic and kinematic variables (figure 7). The 
strongest effect size was for increased pelvic rotation towards 
the direction of intended travel, and greater trunk side flexion 
towards the direction of intended travel throughout stance 
phase (table 4). There were medium effect sizes for changes 
in pelvic tilt towards the direction of intended travel, reduced 
trunk-on-pelvis side flexion towards the stance leg, reduced 
hip flexion and increased ankle dorsiflexion. There were small 
effect sizes for a number of variables, including increased

thoracic rotation in the direction of intended travel, reduced 
hip abduction and knee flexion angle. The centre of mass 
was more anterior relative to the centre of pressure during 
the eccentric phase of cutting, more towards the direction of 
intended travel throughout stance phase after rehabilitation 
and ground contact time was reduced. There was no differ-
ence in the centre of mass velocity (approach speed) at initial 
contact before (2.14 m/s (±0.3)) and after rehabilitation (2.16 
m/s (±0.29)) (p=0.434).
Kinetic analysis demonstrated increased ankle plantar 
flexion moment post rehabilitation and reduced hip extensor 
moment as well as reduced hip adduction moment during 
push-off (table 5). Analysis of total work done at each joint 
showed a large increase in total work done at the ankle, a 
moderate reduction in the total work done at the hip and a 
small reduction at the knee after rehabilitation. This primarily 
was affected by large increases in work in the sagittal plane of 
the ankle and moderate reductions in work in all three planes 
at the hip and frontal plane at the knee (table 6).
dIsCussIOn
We describe a rehabilitation programme for patients with AGP
, 
regardless of clinical entity. The programme was designed to 
target intersegmental control (across strength, linear and multi-
directional drills) and optimise the biomechanics of maximal 
effort change of direction cutting. The post rehabilitation cohort 
demonstrated significantly different change of direction strate-
gies during the cutting manoeuvre.
Clinical outcomes (hAGOs, rTP, squeeze test)
HAGOS subscores for pain, symptoms, activities of daily living 
and sports/recreation all returned to normative levels36 but 
remained reduced compared with athletes who have never had 
groin pain.29 This pattern of recovery has been identified in 
similar cohorts previously.37 Quality of life and participation in 
physical activities scores remained below this normal distribu-
tion on discharge (table 2). Recovery of quality of life scores 
have been shown to be inversely associated with longer dura-
tion of symptoms.37 These lower scores may reflect ongoing 
self-driven or coach-driven load management and psychological 
factors relating to the long duration of symptoms, which may 
continue to improve over time as the patient makes a successful 
return to sport.
This study examined both HAGOS and pain provocation tests 
with reported pain-free RTP to improve outcome validity. The 
demonstrated pain-free RTP rates (73%) and times (9.9±3.4 
weeks) compare favourably with anatomically specific rehabil-
itation protocols used by Hölmich (68% RTP
, 18.5 weeks)11 
and Weir (48% RTP
, 17.3 weeks),10 as well as surgical proto-
cols for adductor (63%–76% 
RTP
, 14–18 weeks)38–40 and pubic 
pathology (100% RTP
, 13–28 weeks).41 42 Both rehabilita-
tion papers are randomised control trials,10 11 not prospective 
case series as in this case; a higher level of evidence ensuring 
their outcomes did not occur by chance. Of those who made a 
pain-free RTP
, seven patients demonstrated residual symptoms 
on squeeze test at discharge, suggesting a clinical lag between 
pain-free RTP and pain-free squeeze at 0°, 45° and 90°. As the 
median duration of symptoms prior to rehabilitation was over 8 
months, the authors consider the mean time to RTP of 9.9 weeks 
encouraging and believe the intervention may have influenced 
outcomes.
biomechanical changes in cutting
Following rehabilitation, patients demonstrated changes in 
various biomechanical variables post rehabilitation, which 
have been shown to be related to cutting performance. These

include reduced ground contact time,21 43 44 increased centre of 
mass distance to the centre of pressure in the frontal plane,20 
reduced trunk side flexion towards the stance leg,21 43 reduced 
knee flexion,44 and increased ankle power and plantar flexion 
moment.21 These changes also concurrently reduced the load 
around the hip and groin as work in all three planes of the hip 
and the adductor moment were reduced.
Components of rehabilitation
Exercise selection was based on individual patient competency 
and progressed according to improvements in segmental control. 
Without appropriate execution of any exercise, the patient may 
not achieve the desired training effect or change in segmental 
control, leading to delayed recovery and commonly an aggra-
vation of symptoms despite appropriate dosage. This approach 
ensured the programme was set at a level specific to the patient 
and progressed as quickly or slowly as the individual compe-
tency and symptom levels allowed, ensuring the most appro-
priate exercise selection and recovery time.
Level 1 focused on intersegmental control and strength. 
Reduced gluteal and iliopsoas activation during hip exten-
sion has been suggested to increase anterior hip joint forces, 
and thus restoring function in both is essential to optimising 
load distribution in the region.45 Loss of lumbopelvic control 
into anterior pelvic tilt has been shown to increase dynamic 
femoroacetabular impingement and load across the symphysis 
pubis,46 47 and changes in pelvic position relative to the femur 
have been shown to influence hip muscle action and joint 
loading at the hip.48 49 Hip strength and rate of force develop-
ment relative to body weight have been shown to correlate posi-
tively with cutting performance and biomechanics.50 51 Level 1 
included exercises that focused on control between individual 
segments and combined them with compound movements such 
as deadlift, squat and lunge, which targeted multisegmental 
coordination while developing strength. It is noteworthy that 
this study demonstrated a significant improvement in adductor 
strength in the absence of any isolated adductor strengthening 
during rehabilitation, perhaps demonstrating the efficacy of 
restoring pain-free function to the area in improving adductor 
function.
linear and multidirectional mechanics
Acceleration, sprinting and change of direction are the most 
commonly reported aggravating activities for AGP; therefore, 
early incorporation of rate of force development and running 
mechanics, through linear and multidirectional drills, was 
deemed important.52 53 The linear running drills addressed 
overstride and dynamic anterior pelvic tilt. Overstride may 
increase anterior hip joint forces at end range extension54 
causing increased hip joint load,52 55 while anterior pelvic tilt 
may increase femoroacetabular contact and pubic symphysis 
stress.46 47 The linear running programme A and B gradually 
increased patients’ load tolerance and exposure to avoid injury 
associated with acute spikes in training load on resumption of 
playing.53 Change of direction drills have been shown to be 
more effective at improving change of direction performance 
than strength training or sprint training alone.56 Progression to 
the multidirectional drills focused on the rate of force devel-
opment across all three planes and reactive agility to prepare 
the patient for sports-specific movements with the associated 
enhancement in cutting mechanics and performance outlined 
above.
limitations
This was not a randomised trial and there is no explicit control 
group. The results are impacted by a loss to follow-up rate of 
27% and additionally a further 14% returning to play without 
final 3D comparison. An omission was made in the registration 
of the study in the non-inclusion of an additional secondary 
outcome measure of RTP
.
Future studies should look at the relationship between changes 
in specific biomechanical variables and outcome measures such 
as HAGOS and RTP to allow for more targeted rehabilitation 
strategies, as well as compare the current rehabilitation approach 
with previously published anatomical specific protocols.
COnClusIOn
This study demonstrated that a rehabilitation programme 
focused on intersegmental control improved patients’ HAGOS 
scores and pain provocation tests, and allowed 73% of patients 
to return to play pain-free faster than in previous trials. In this 
study, successful rehabilitation effected a change in cutting 
biomechanics, which reduced mechanical work across the hip as 
well as variables associated with improved cutting performance. 
An approach to rehabilitation based on intersegmental control 
may offer an alternative to strategies based on specific anatom-
ical diagnoses, and warrants further comparison in randomised 
control trials.
What are the findings?
 
► A rehabilitation programme focused on intersegmental 
control was associated with improvement in a range of 
outcome measures (return to play, Hip and Groin Outcome 
Score, squeeze test) in patients with diverse (and multiple) 
anatomical diagnoses for athletic groin pain.
 
► Rehabilitation focusing on intersegmental control elicited 
changes in the change of direction biomechanics associated 
with improved cutting performance.
 
► Three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical examination can 
provide new insights into understanding rehabilitation 
interventions.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► Focus attention towards identifying movement strategies as a 
risk factor for athletic groin pain.
 
► Allow the focus of rehabilitation to be on intersegmental 
coordination control rather than specific anatomical 
structures.
 
► Identify specific targets for rehabilitation through 3D motion 
analysis.
