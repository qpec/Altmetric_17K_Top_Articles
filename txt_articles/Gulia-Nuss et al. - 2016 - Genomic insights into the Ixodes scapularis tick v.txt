Genomic insights into the Ixodes scapularis tick
vector of Lyme disease
Monika Gulia-Nuss et al.#
Ticks transmit more pathogens to humans and animals than any other arthropod. We
describe the 2.1 Gbp nuclear genome of the tick, Ixodes scapularis (Say), which vectors
pathogens that cause Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis and other
diseases. The large genome reflects accumulation of repetitive DNA, new lineages of retro-
transposons, and gene architecture patterns resembling ancient metazoans rather than
pancrustaceans. Annotation of scaffolds representing B57% of the genome, reveals 20,486
protein-coding genes and expansions of gene families associated with tick–host interactions.
We report insights from genome analyses into parasitic processes unique to ticks, including
host ‘questing’, prolonged feeding, cuticle synthesis, blood meal concentration, novel meth-
ods of haemoglobin digestion, haem detoxification, vitellogenesis and prolonged off-host
survival. We identify proteins associated with the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis,
an emerging disease, and the encephalitis-causing Langat virus, and a population structure
correlated to life-history traits and transmission of the Lyme disease agent.

(subphylum
Chelicerata:
suborder
Ixodida)
are
notorious ectoparasites and vectors of human and animal
pathogens, transmitting a greater diversity of infectious
agents than any other group of blood-feeding arthropods. Ticks
are responsible for serious physical damage to the host, including
blood loss and toxicosis. Tick-borne diseases result in significant
morbidity and thousands of human and animal deaths annually.
The genus Ixodes includes multiple species of medical and
veterinary importance, most notably serving as vectors of Lyme
borreliosis in North America, Europe and Asia. Lyme disease is
the
most
prevalent
vector-borne
disease
in
the
northern
hemisphere1. In the USA, 22,014 confirmed human cases were
reported in 2012 (ref. 2), with B10-fold more infections
suspected3. In Europe, B65,500 Lyme borreliosis patients are
documented annually4. In the USA, Ixodes scapularis also vectors
the infectious agents that cause human babesiosis, human
granulocytic
anaplasmosis,
tick-borne
relapsing
fever
and
Powassan encephalitis. The increased incidence and distribution
of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases5 necessitates new
approaches for vector control.
Subphyla
Chelicerata
(includes
ticks
and
mites)
and
Mandibulata (includes insects) shared a common ancestor
543–526 million years ago (Myr ago)6. Tick life cycles differ in
many aspects from those of insects (Fig. 1) and include long
periods of host attachment and blood feeding, as well as months
living off-host without feeding. ‘Three-host’ ticks such as
I. scapularis require a host blood meal at each life stage.
Feeding occurs over several days and involves a period of slow
feeding followed, after mating and insemination, by rapid
consumption of a large blood meal. The synthesis of flexible
new cuticle is a unique feature that permits the engorgement of
ixodid ticks during feeding7. Moulting occurs off-host, and the
subsequent developmental stage will ‘quest’ for a new host from
vegetation. I. scapularis exhibits a wide host range including
small, ground-dwelling vertebrates, birds, white-tailed deer and
humans.
The
I.
scapularis
genome
assembly
is
the
first
for
a
medically important acarine species. It affords opportunities for
comparative evolutionary analyses between disease vectors from
diverse arthropod lineages and serves as a resource for the
exploration of how ticks parasitize and transmit pathogens to
their vertebrate hosts.
Results
The first genome assembly for a tick vector of disease. The
assembly, IscaW1, comprises 570,640 contigs in 369,495 scaffolds
(N50 ¼ 51,551 bp) representing 1.8 Gbp, including gaps (Table 1,
Supplementary Table 2). The ab initio annotation of 18,385
scaffolds 410 Kbp in length and representing 1.2 Gbp (57% of
the genome) predicted 20,486 protein-coding genes, and 4,439
non-coding
RNA
genes
(Supplementary
Figs
1–6
and
Supplementary Table 3). Ixodid ticks typically have haploid
genomes that exceed 1 Gbp (ref. 8). In contrast, the 90 Mbp
genome of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a
horticultural pest, is the smallest of any known arthropod, and
contains o10% transposable elements9. Repetitive DNA is
estimated to comprise B70% of the I. scapularis genome10,
reflecting an extreme case of tandem repeat and transposable
element accumulation.
The I. scapularis genome possesses 26 acrocentric autosomes
and two sex chromosomes (XX:XY)11,12. Fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH)-based physical mapping was used to
develop a karyotype and physical map12 (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Tables 12 and 15). Mapping revealed that tandem repeat
accumulation in centromeric or peri-centromeric regions, also
noted in some other arthropods13, is high in I. scapularis and
comprises B40% of genomic DNA10. The low complexity
tandem repeat families, ISR-1, ISR-2 and ISR-3, account for
B8% of the genome12 (Supplementary Text). The most abundant
ISR-2 (95–99 bp; B7% of the genome) is localized at the near-
terminal heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes (Fig. 2).
The moderately repetitive fraction of the genome (B30% of
genomic DNA10) contains numerous copies of Class I and Class
II transposable elements (Supplementary Tables 13 and 14 and
Supplementary Text). For example, 41 well-represented elements
(that is, comprising a full-length canonical and/or consensus
sequence (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8)) of the long-terminal
repeat (LTR) retro-transposon family, estimated to make up
o1% of the genome, were identified. Thirty-seven members of
the Ty3/gypsy group were identified, with the remainder being
Pao/Bel-like. Two (Mag and CsRn1) of the six well-known insect
Ty3/gypsy lineages were confirmed in the tick and two new
clades, Squirrel and Toxo, are likely specific to the subphylum
Chelicerata (Supplementary Fig. 8). Structural characterization of
elements belonging to these lineages revealed shared features that
include the CCHC gag and GPY/F integrase domains, and two
ORFs matching gag and pol. The LTRs possess the TG..CA
pattern14 and their integration generates a duplication of 4 bp.
Non-LTR retro-transposons comprise about 6.5% of the
genome. Sequence conservation and transposable element copy
number suggest recent activity in the I. scapularis CR1, I and L2
clades; these elements are also abundant in birds, mammals and
lizards, and the possibility of horizontal transposable element
transmission warrants further investigation. The R2, RTE and
LOA non-LTR retro-transposon clades found in mosquitoes and
Drosophila were not identified in the tick. Seemingly intact
mariner and piggyBac transposable elements were identified,
indicating possible recent or active transposition, and 234
miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were
annotated. These MITEs range in copy number from 50 to 14,500
and occupy B5% of the genome. Collectively, these findings
suggest a genome permissive to high repeat accumulation.
Approximately 60% of tick genes have recognizable orthologs
in other arthropods, about half of which are maintained across
representative
species
of
the
major
arthropod
lineages
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Approximately 50% of the remaining
genes have homologs and B1/5th of tick genes appear unique (T.
urticae has a similar proportion of unique genes); these provide
an important resource to understand tick-specific processes and
develop highly selective interventions. Analysis of gene models
and 20,901 tentative consensus sequences (the Gene Index
Project; compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi) compiled from 192,461
expressed
sequence
tags
(ESTs)
identified
B22%
of
I. scapularis genes as paralogs (Supplementary Note 1 and
Supplementary Table 11). This is in line with estimates for Homo
sapiens (15%)15 and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans
(20%)16. Complementary analyses of paralogs17 suggest two
duplication events in I. scapularis, involving hundreds of genes
that took place within the last 40 million years, consistent with the
radiation of ticks through Europe, America and Africa. The tick
mitochondrial genome retains the inferred ancestral arthropod
organization
as
predicted
by
its
phylogenetic
position18
(Supplementary Fig. 10).
The genome-scale quantitative molecular species phylogeny
(Supplementary Text) inferred from single-copy orthologs from
OrthoDB19, confirms the expected position of Chelicerata as basal
to crustaceans and insects (Fig. 3a). The rate of molecular
evolution of I. scapularis genes is slightly slower than that of other
representative arthropods, and considerably slower than the
rapidly evolving dipterans. Quantification of shared intron
positions (Fig. 3b) and lengths (Fig. 3c) among orthologs

 reveals that I. scapularis shares greater than 10 times more intron
positions exclusively with the non-arthropod species compared
with the crustacean Daphnia pulex (Supplementary Figs 11–14
and Supplementary Tables 7–10). The species tree topology is
reconstructed using only intron presence/absence data, but its
branch lengths reveal that I. scapularis intron positions are more
similar to those of the outgroup species, than to the other
arthropods. This distinction is underscored by the contrasting
length distributions of shared introns; I. scapularis lengths are
most similar to those of mouse and other vertebrates, and an

analysed. Ancestral eukaryotic
genes likely possessed high intron densities similar to those of
modern mammals20. The tick genome, therefore, supports an
intron-rich gene architecture at the base of the arthropod
radiation and more similar to that of ancestral metazoans than
extant pancrustaceans.
Ticks as parasites. Tick mouthparts (chelicerae and barbed
hypostome) attach to and create a feeding lesion in the dermis of
the host (Fig. 1b). Tick saliva consists of a complex mixture
of peptides and other compounds that facilitate attachment and
disarm host haemostasis, inflammation and immunity, thereby
enabling prolonged blood feeding. Antimicrobials in the saliva21
presumably prevent bacterial overgrowth within the ingested
blood and/or feeding lesion. Transcriptome analyses indicate
that tick saliva is exceptionally diverse compared with that of
salivary glands

Figure 1 | Genes associated with the unique parasitic lifestyle of Ixodes scapularis. (a) Host detection. Ticks spend long periods off-host and locate hosts
by ‘questing’ from vegetation. The Haller’s organ, located on the first pair of tarsi, is the major sensory appendage. The tick has a relatively small repertoire
of visual and chemosensory genes and an expansion of detoxification genes, presumably to counteract environmental toxicants. (b) Attachment and blood
feeding. The tick creates a wound cavity and injects saliva containing cement, vasodilators, pain inhibitors, anticoagulants and immune-suppressing factors
to facilitate long periods of attachment and blood feeding. (c) Engorgement. Blood engorgement takes place over days to weeks and includes slow and rapid
phases (dotted lines indicate increase in body volume). New cuticle is putatively synthesized to accommodate ingestion of the large (B100-fold increase in
body weight) blood meal. The tick has an expansion of neuropeptide receptors to regulate diuresis and concentrate the blood meal. (d) Digestion. The
processes of haemoglobin digestion in intracellular vesicles of midgut cells and haem sequestration involving specialized storage proteins are unique to
ticks. Haemolyzed erythrocytes are absorbed by midgut epithelial cells by pinocytosis. Digestion is accomplished by fusion with lysosomes containing
digestive enzymes (see text) and sequential breakdown of proteins (1) liberating haem and 8–11 kDa peptide fragments, (2) B5–7 kDa fragments, (3) 3–
5 kDa peptides and finally (4) dipeptides and free amino acids. Amino acids are transcytosed from the digestive cells into haemolymph and haem is
transported by haem-binding proteins to haemosomes for detoxification. Absorbed nutrients are converted to storage proteins (CP) throughout
development or to vitellogenin in adult females for yolk provisioning of the egg just before oviposition. AMP, antimicrobial peptide; CAT, cathepsin; CP,

 haematophagous insects22. Also, genes encoding salivary gland
products are evolving rapidly in comparison with other gene
families, possibly due to the immune pressure imposed by the
host. Notably, the genome reveals an expanded repertoire
(74, 0.4% of the predicted proteome) of proteins containing a
Kunitz domain (Supplementary Table 16), implicated in protease
inhibition and channel-blocking activity, with roles in inhibiting
coagulation, angiogenesis and vasodilation. The tick genome
is the richest source of this gene family identified to date.
In contrast, only 0.05% of human and 0.1% of bovine proteins
have this signature domain23, while the mosquito vectors Aedes
aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae have only
five, eight and four proteins with this domain, respectively. Other
tick gene expansions of note include the lipocalins (40 genes),
linked to anti-inflammatory activity in other systems24, and
the metalloproteases (34 genes), which are involved in fibrin
degradation and inhibition of angiogenesis25
Ticks have evolved a novel mechanism for haemoglobin
digestion. Haemolysis of host erythrocytes occurs in the midgut
but the digestion of blood meal proteins takes place within
specialized vesicles of midgut epithelial cells following inter-
nalization by pinocytosis (Fig. 1d). Haemoglobin digestion occurs
via a cascade of proteolytic enzymes resulting in dipeptides and
free amino acids that are transcytosed into the haemolymph
(Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table 21). Orthologs
of Ixodes ricinus haemoglobinolytic enzymes26 were identified
in the I. scapularis genome that contains multiple genes for
cathepsin D (three genes), cathepsin L (three genes), and serine
carboxypeptidase (four genes), suggesting the relative importance
of these enzymes in haemoglobin digestion. Haemoglobinolytic
enzymes have also been identified in other tick species27,28,
suggesting that this mode of haemoglobin digestion is widespread
throughout the Ixodida. Liberated haem is transported from the
digestive vesicles by transport proteins to haemosomes, unique
storage vesicles where haem is detoxified by formation of
haematin-like aggregates29. Thus, haemoglobinolysis in ticks is
similar to that in endoparasitic flatworms and nematodes.
However,
tick-specific
intracellular
digestion
in
midgut
epithelial
vesicles
and
haem
detoxification

specialized
haemosomes could offer novel acaricide targets (Supplementary
Text and Supplementary Table 21).
Haem is associated with multiple essential functions as it
complexes with proteins that perform oxygen transport and
sensing, enzyme catalysis and electron transfer30. However,
ticks are incapable of de novo haem synthesis, and it has been
proposed that they rely on haem recovery from the diet31.

 enzymes hemF, hemG and hemH associated with the production
of protohaem (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary
Table 20) suggests these may be remnants of a once functional
haem synthesis pathway that became redundant following
adaptation to a blood diet. In the absence of de novo synthesis,
haem storage in ticks is likely essential, especially during the
extended periods that occur between blood feeding and during
egg development. In ticks, two families of storage proteins ensure
haem availability and protect against the toxicity of a haem-rich
diet: haemlipoglyco-carrier proteins (CPs) and the yolk proteins,
vitellogenins (Vgs)32 (Fig. 1d). CPs are predominant in all tick
developmental stages except the embryo. In contrast, Vg is
produced in the fat body and midgut of adult females during
vitellogenesis (Fig. 4), and is transported via the haemolymph to
the developing oocyctes where it is stored as vitellin. Vitellin is the
main protein in the egg and the likely source of haem for
developing embryos33. Ten putative CP genes, the most described
from a tick to date, and two Vg genes were identified in the
I. scapularis genome (Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary
Table 22).
The genome contains orthologs for at least 39 invertebrate
neuropeptide genes (Supplementary Tables 25–28), including
peptides that regulate ecdysis, cuticle synthesis, hardening and
tanning. Orthologs involved in insect moulting34, that is,
corazonin, eclosion hormone, cardioactive peptide and buriscon
a and b, were identified (Fig. 4). Additional novel putative
neuropeptide genes were identified based on the presence of
tandem repeats in conserved C-terminal sequences, including the
canonical sequences for amidation and dibasic (or monobasic)
cleavage signals (Supplementary Table 25). ESTs matching
corazonin, eclosion hormone and bursicon a and b were
found in the synganglion transcriptome of adult Dermacentor
variabilis35,
which

suggesting
previously
unrecognized
roles

hormones.
Companion analyses36 identified major differences in gene
expression between I. scapularis and the soft tick, Ornithodoros
turicata (Argasidae) in response to feeding that may explain how
synganglion neuropetides regulate different life styles of the two
tick families. The identification of orthologs of neuropeptides
known to regulate insect moulting provides a much needed
starting point to understand the regulation of development in
ticks and in the modification of cuticle to accommodate the
approximately 100-fold increase in size that occurs during blood
feeding (Fig. 4).
In ticks, over-hydration from large blood meals is counter-
balanced by hormonally controlled salivary secretion into the
host, presumably regulated by neuropeptides and their G-protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Fig. 1c). The homologs of many
insect neuropeptides, protein hormones, biogenic amines and
associated GPCRs37 (Supplementary Tables 25–28) that steer
processes
such
as
diuresis,
behaviour,
reproduction
and
development38, were identified in I. scapularis. Some of the
neuropeptide genes identified encode multiple neuropeptides. Of
note is the extreme number of copies (19) of the kinin gene,
which
ranges
from
one
to
eight
in
other
arthropods38
(Supplementary Table 28), suggesting that high peptide copy
number is also needed for effective diuresis. In accordance, four
kinin GPCRs are present (Supplementary Table 28). The tick has
20 GPCRs for five biogenic amines, a number similar to that
for all other sequenced arthropods37, suggesting an early
evolutionary origin of these molecules and a core set of highly
conserved arthropod signalling molecules. Typically in insects,
each neuropeptide interacts with one, or at most two, GPCRs37.
Remarkably,
the
numbers
of
some
neuropeptide
GPCRs
have expanded significantly (up to 10-fold) in I. scapularis
(Supplementary Tables 26 and 28). This includes the GPCRs
for
AKH/corazonin-related
peptide,
allatostatin-A,
diuretic
hormones (calcitonin- and CRF-like), inotocin, kinin, pigment-
dispersing-factor, sulfakinin, and tachykinin (Supplementary
Table 28)37. In insects, these GPCRs are involved in regulating
meal size (kinin), satiety (sulfakinin) and diuresis (kinin,
tachykinin and calcitonin-like diuretic hormone)38. In ticks,
the increased efficacy and fine regulation of diuresis may be
accomplished through an increased repertoire of diuretic GPCRs
rather than via corresponding neuropeptides, emphasizing their
potential as targets for tick control.
Blood feeding is essential for reproduction in adult female ticks
(Fig. 4). In lower insects, reproduction is largely regulated by
juvenile hormone III. Biochemical evidence suggests that ticks
do not synthesize juvenile hormone III and instead employ
ecdysteroids to initiate vitellogenesis (Fig. 4, reviewed in33). In
insects, the final hydroxylations for the synthesis of ecdysteroids
are performed sequentially by cytochrome P450s (CYP450s)

(a) The species phylogeny computed from the concatenated alignment of
single-copy orthologous protein-coding genes confirms the position of the
Subphylum Chelicerata at the base of the arthropod radiation, an outgroup
to the clade Pancrustacea that contains crustaceans and hexapods. The
average rate of I. scapularis molecular evolution is slower than that in the
fast-evolving dipterans (Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster),
comparable to other representative arthropods for which genome
sequences are available, and faster than that of vertebrates.
(b) Quantification of the proportions of shared and unique intron positions
from well-aligned regions of universal orthologs reveals that, compared with
the crustacean, Daphnia pulex, I. scapularis shares more than 10 times as
many introns exclusively with at least one of the five outgroup species
(from Cnidaria and Vertebrata) (dotted box, 13.8% versus 1.1%).
Conversely, D. pulex has more intron positions exclusively in common with
the representative insects (dashed box, 2.3% versus 0.6%). (c) I. scapularis
intron lengths are more similar to those of introns from orthologous genes
in the vertebrates Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, and are an order of
magnitude longer than introns from the pancrustacean species analysed.
The intron length distributions are shown for ancient introns found in both
I. scapularis and D. pulex and at least one of the five outgroup species and at
least one insect; boxplots indicate medians, first and third quartiles, and

Genes for seven of the nine enzymes in the insect mevalonate
pathway that produces the juvenile hormone precursor, farnesyl-

five insect enzymes involved in the conversion of farnesyl-PP to
juvenile hormone III. Only the gene for farnesol oxidase in the
juvenile hormone branch was found in the I. scapularis genome

of I. scapularis and D. variabilis. The tick genome reveals a
striking expansion of the methyl transferase family (44 genes) and
EST data indicate that at least 26 of these are transcribed
(Supplementary Fig. 19). However, the I. scapularis methyl

Figure 4 | Model of neuroendocrine processes controlling mating and egg production in Ixodes scapularis. (1) Mating takes place off or on the host
(before or during blood feeding), but is required for rapid blood feeding. The male attaches to the genital pore of the female via its mouthparts (evidence
suggests the potential involvement of female specific cuticular lipids and a non-volatile mounting pheromone in I. scapularis), then transfers sperm and
gonadotropins (unidentified at present), among other seminal components, including the spermatophore, (2) Gonadotropins initiate the synganglion to
release EDTH, stimulate rapid engorgement, initiate synthesis of neuropeptides which in insects regulate moulting and synthesis of new cuticle (tick
functions unknown), and release of allatostatins and allatotropins (which may stimulate or inhibit the mevalonate-farnesal pathway), (3) EDTH initiates
production of ecdysteroids by the epidermis, (4) High ecdysteroid titres activate transcription factors for VgR in the ovaries, are stored in developing eggs
and, as 20-E, activates transcription factors for Vg in the fat body and specialized cells of the midgut, (5) Vg is taken up via VgR-receptor mediated
endocytosis by developing oocytes and incorporated into the yolk as vitellin, and (6) The female produces a single batch of B3,000 mature eggs from the
genital pore that are passed forward to the mouthparts for coating with wax released from the Gene’s organ. Biochemical and genomic evidence suggests
that I. scapularis do not make JH III although the genes for the preceding mevalonate and parts of the farnesal pathway were identified. Dashed lines indicate

was

in

the

genome
(Supplementary Table 18) or synganglion transcriptomes. The
neuropeptides, allatostatin and allatotropin, which perform a
variety of functions in insects, including the regulation of juvenile
hormone biosynthesis, were also identified in the tick (Fig. 4).
Important questions remain as to the role of the mevalonate-
farnesal pathway in tick reproduction and development. In a
complementary study, transcripts for genes in the mevalonate-
farnesal pathway were identified from the synganglion of two
hard and one soft tick species39.
The I. scapularis genome reflects a parasitic lifestyle requiring
detoxification of multiple xenobiotic factors (Fig. 1a). We
identified a record 206 CYP450 (Supplementary Table 23) and
75
carboxylesterase/cholinesterase-like
genes,
including
five
putative acetylcholinesterase genes (Supplementary Table 24).
CYPs are haem-containing enzymes that catalyse biological
oxidation
reactions,
many
of
which
detoxify
xenobiotics,
including acaricides. In contrast, the body louse, Pediculus
humanus,
also
an
obligate
blood-feeding
ectoparasite,
has
36 CYPs, the fewest known in an animal40, while the plant
feeding mite, T. urticae has 81 (ref. 9). Carboxylesterases are also
associated with metabolic detoxification in animals. While the
function of these enzymes is not known, the abundance of these
genes in I. scapularis may reflect the need to detoxify large
blood meals from diverse hosts and toxicants encountered during
off-host stages.
As a parasite that lives largely off-host, I. scapularis has
developed unique mechanisms for host detection that are
reflected in the genome (Fig. 1a). The sensory system in ticks
includes setiform sensilla for chemo-, mechano-, thermo- and
hygroreception, non-setal sensilla and dorsal light-sensing cells.
Chemoreception occurs presumably through the unique Haller’s
organ located on the tarsi that are presented when ticks ‘quest’ for
a host. In insects, smell and taste are mediated by families of
membrane receptors and extracellular ligand-binding proteins41.
The chemoreceptor genes identified in the tick genome belong
to the gustatory receptor and ionotropic glutamate receptor
(iGluR)-related ionotropic receptor families. Sixty-two gustatory
receptors were identified that fall into three major clades
(Supplementary
Fig.
20,
Supplementary
Table
29
and
Supplementary Note 1). The largest of the clades (43 genes) is
exclusive to I. scapularis and the relatively short branch lengths
compared with those for other representative species, suggest a
recent lineage-specific expansion. Although phylogenetically
distant, this clade is related to the Dipteran sugar receptors and
a set of three distinctive D. pulex gustatory receptors42. The
second clade includes 16 tick gustatory receptors, also more
closely related to the sugar receptors than to other representative
gustatory receptors, with branch lengths suggesting an early
diversification. The remaining clade (three genes) clusters with
the largest D. pulex expansion. Of the 29 IR/iGluR genes
identified, 15 are likely of the chemosensory type (ionotropic
receptor) and 14 are canonical iGluRs (Supplementary Fig. 21
and Supplementary Tables 30 and 31). Members of the
insect odorant receptor, odorant-binding protein (OBP) and
chemosensory protein B families43 were not identified in the tick
and only one member of the chemosensory protein (CSP) family
was found. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the origin of
insect odorant receptors and OBPs occurred after the split of the
lineages Hexapoda and Crustacea (B470 Myr ago)42,44; the CSPs,
however, are predicted to appear before the split of the
Chelicerata and Pancrustacea lineages. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate that odorant receptors belong to a divergent lineage
originated from gustatory receptors, while OBPs could have
derived from a CSP-like ancestor44. Both events may have
occurred concomitantly as an adaptation of ancestral hexapods
to the terrestrial environment (380–450 Myr ago). Chelicerate
olfaction may, therefore, rely exclusively on ionotropic receptors,
which are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia45,
although it is also possible that some gustatory receptors have
been recruited to this sensory function, as in Drosophila
melanogaster46.
Comparative

enzymes and other transcripts specific to the Haller’s organ in
ticks47. Evidence suggests the potential involvement of female
specific cuticular lipids and a non-volatile mounting pheromone
in I. scapularis during mating48. These data and morphological
studies provide an emerging model for research on tick chemical
communication and new control methods.
The tick possesses a small repertoire of photon-sensitive
receptors compared with most insects. Genes for three opsin
GPCRs were identified (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 26) and
include orthologs of the insect putative long-wavelength sensitive
‘visual’ opsins, the honey bee ‘non-visual’ pteropsin likely
involved in extraocular light detection and regulation of circadian
rhythm49, as well as the D. melanogaster Rh7 opsin50. Orthologs
of the insect UV and short wavelength receptors were not
identified. This indicates a reduced visual system as compared
with other blood-feeding arthropods (Supplementary Text) that
rely heavily on visual processes during flight for location of mates,
hosts and oviposition sites. During host detection, olfactory,
mechano- and thermoreception may offset limited visual acuity
and wavelength detection in the tick.
Ticks as vectors of pathogens and parasites. Ticks are biological
vectors of viruses, bacteria and protozoa that are typically
acquired via the blood meal and transmitted through saliva
during feeding (Fig. 5). The tick immune system has several
mechanisms to fend off pathogen invasion. Most components of
the Toll, IMD (Immunodeficiency), JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase/
Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) immune
pathways and the RNA interference-antiviral signalling pathways
were identified in the tick genome (Supplementary Figs 22 and 23
and Supplementary Table 17). The repertoire of immunity-related
genes also includes akirins, antimicrobial peptides, caspases,
defensins, oxidases, the fibrinogen-related protein family of
ixoderins,
lysozymes,
thio-ester
containing
proteins
and
peptidoglycan-recognition proteins (Supplementary Table 17).
Multiple infection factors facilitate transmission of the Lyme
disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi (Fig. 5). These include the
tick salivary gland proteins Salp15, Salp20, Salp25D, tick salivary
lectin pathway inhibitor and tick histamine-release factor, as well
as the tick receptor for OspA and tick protein tre31, and the
Borrelia lipoprotein BBE31 (ref. 51). Increasingly, research is
focused
on
interactions
with
Anaplasma
phagocytophilum
(Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae), the causative agent of human
granulocytic anaplasmosis prevalent in the USA and Europe52.
The I. scapularis proteins P11, SALP16, a1, 3-fucosyltransferases
and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis E3 ubiquitin ligase are
required for A. phagocytophilum infection and transmission, and
modification of the tick cytoskeleton by A. phagocytophilum
increases infection53–55. To establish infection, A. phagocytophilum
inhibits apoptosis in midgut and salivary gland cells through the
JAK/STAT and intrinsic pathways56. In response, the extrinsic
apoptosis pathway is induced in tick salivary glands. All known
components of these pathways were identified in the tick with the
exception of the Perforin ortholog (Supplementary Table 17).
Systems biology analyses56 revealed that the generalized responses

 of tick cells to A. phagocytophilum infection include changes in
protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and glucose
metabolism. Protein misfolding is increased in infected tick cells, a
possible strategy by which A. phagocytophilum evades the cellular
response to infection. The subsequent activation of protein
targeting and degradation, reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress
and prevents cell apoptosis, and may also benefit the pathogen
through provision of raw materials critical for an obligatory
intracellular parasite with reduced biosynthetic and metabolic
capacity57. In addition, A. phagocytophilum can induce an increase

Tick cells respond to pathogen infection by decreasing glucose
metabolism and increasing Subolesin and Heat Shock Protein
expression, and limiting rickettsial infection59,60.

were
identified
(Supplementary
Tables 32–35). In total, 83 proteins were differentially represented
(50 under- and 33 over-represented; Supplementary Fig. 24 and
Supplementary Table 32). Under-represented (13) and over-
represented (8) proteins were identified during early infection
(11–17% infected cells at 3 days post-inoculation). Most were also
represented as infection advanced when the number of under-
and over-represented proteins increased to 50 and 31, respectively
(56–61% infected cells; 10 days post-inoculation). Analysis of
protein ontology demonstrated differences between under- and
over-represented proteins in both early and late infections for cell

The genome of a Rickettsia (Alphaproteobacteria: Rickettsiales)
species, Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ixodes scapularis (REIS), was
assembled from both bacterial artificial chromosome clones and
recruited whole-genome shotgun reads (available at GenBank,

Phylogenomics
analysis
of
the

genome, which comprises a single 1.82 Mbp chromosome and

ancestral to all Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia species, providing
a valuable resource for understanding the evolution of symbiosis
versus pathogenicity61.
Much less is known about the molecular mechanisms involved
with viral interactions in ticks. Research suggests the RNA

Population structure of Ixodes scapularis in North America.
The
restriction-site-associated
DNA
sequencing
(RADseq)
technique was employed for genome-wide discovery of single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and examination of genetic
diversity within and among eight I. scapularis populations from
the north-east, mid-west and south-east regions of the USA and
the Wikel reference colony. F-statistics were used to assess genetic
distance as evidence of selection. FIS values (range 0.003–0.012;
Supplementary Table 36) suggest random mating or low levels of
inbreeding among members comprising each population. Further
supporting this hypothesis, among all populations, the average
observed heterozygosity (Ho) per variable SNP was comparable
(range 0.013–0.016) to expected heterozygosity (He) (range
0.013–0.018) and the nucleotide diversity over all SNP loci (p)
(range 0.015–0.019) was comparable among samples. FST values
(range 0.03–0.16; Supplementary Table 37), support a single
species classification for I. scapularis across North America
as
previously
reported64.
Low-moderate
genetic
variation
(FST¼ 0.03–0.06) was observed among northern tick populations
from Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Wisconsin, and moderate variation (FST ¼ 0.07–0.09) among
southern populations from Florida, North Carolina and Virginia.
FST analyses revealed signatures of north–south structure in
I. scapularis populations. Moderate-to-high genetic variation
was observed between northern versus southern populations
(FST ¼ 0.10–0.15).
Interestingly,
low
genetic
variation
(FST ¼ 0.03–0.06) was observed between populations from the
mid-west (Indiana and Wisconsin) versus the north-east (Maine,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire), two areas associated with a
high prevalence of human Lyme disease cases. As expected,
moderate-to-high genetic variation was observed between the
reference Wikel colony and field populations (FST ¼ 0.07–0.16).
The population structure of I. scapularis was separately
analysed using a subset of representative SNPs. Membership
probabilities, interpreted as proximities of individuals belonging
to each cluster, revealed five clades (Fig. 6), with clear separation
of the Wikel colony from field populations. Clustering of Indiana
and New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, Maine and Wisconsin
populations,
indicates
significant
shared
alleles,
while
the
Virginia, Florida and North Carolina populations may share a
small number of alleles. Interestingly, the population structure
suggests a genetic component associated with differences in the
natural history of northern and southern I. scapularis and a
correlation to the prevalence of human Lyme disease cases. The
incidence of Lyme disease is greatest in the upper mid-west and
north-east where I. scapularis populations feed predominantly on
deer as adults and complete the life cycle over 2 years. In contrast,

Figure 7 | De-orphanizing Ixodes scapularis receptors as candidate
targets for the development of new acaricides. The newly identified
I. scapularis dicysteine-loop, ligand-gated anion channel subunit (IscaGluCl1,
KR107244) contains the ‘PAR’ motif centred on the 0’ position in the
second transmembrane region (TM2), characteristic of ligand-gated anion
channels and is aligned with a brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus GluCl
(RsGluCl1, ACX33155) and human glycine receptor a-subunit (P23415) (a).
Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte receptor expression vehicle, IscaGluCl1
yielded robust chloride currents in response to 10 � 4 M L-glutamate (b) and
ibotenate (c) but only weak currents in response to the same concentration
of D-glutamate (c); ibotentate and D-glutamate responses are depicted
relative to L-glutamate (n ¼ 6, 8; error bars represent±1 s.e.m.). No
response was detected in the presence of 10 � 4 M acetylcholine (ACh),
g-amino butyric acid (GABA), dopamine, histamine, serotonin, tyramine or

forming GluCl subunit, (IscaGluCl1), illustrated by a schematic of a

 southern populations exploit a wider range of vertebrate hosts
and are not quiescent during winter64,65. These data provide
important resources to determine the genetic basis of host
preference and vector competence, and the correlation with Lyme
disease transmission.
Genome-based interventions to control tick-borne disease.
Prevailing methods of tick control rely heavily on the use of
repellents and acaricides. Resistance to currently applied pesti-
cides that disrupt neural signalling and tick development has
prompted the search for novel targets. GPCRs represent a source
of candidate targets for development of novel interventions.
High-throughput target-based approaches have been employed to
discover new mode-of-action chemistries that selectively inhibit
the I. scapularis dopamine receptors66. The ligand-gated ion
channels (LGICs) offer another rich source of targets. iGluRs play
a major role in neurotransmission and chemosensory signalling
within arthropods67. Twenty-nine putative iGluR genes and 32
putative cys-loop receptors were identified in the I. scapularis
genome (Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 31). Among the iGluR
genes, 14 encode members of the three principal subclasses of
synaptic iGluRs (AMPA, Kainate and NMDA; Supplementary
Fig. 21 and Supplementary Tables 30 and 31), while the
remaining 15 more divergent sequences likely belong to the
chemosensory ionotropic receptor subfamily (see above). The
cys-loop LGIC family also contains six candidate glutamate-gated
Cl �
channels (GluCls), 12 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
subunits,
and
four
GABA-gated
chloride
channels.
One
histamine-gated Cl � channel and one pH-gated Cl � channel
gene were also identified. Both the iGluRs and cys-loop LGIC
families contain tick-specific genes with no apparent insect
ortholog. This striking divergence may contribute to the apparent
ineffectiveness of some insecticides on acaricidal targets67.
Classifying
LGIC
candidates
by
functional
expression
is
underway and an example is shown for a GluCl (Fig. 7;
Supplementary Fig. 25). Selective targeting of tick LGICs and
GPCRs may offer routes to new, safe and effective acaricides.
Discussion
The genome sequence of I. scapularis, the first for a medically
important chelicerate, offers insights into the molecular processes
that underpin the remarkable parasitic lifestyle of the tick and its
success as a vector of multiple disease-causing organisms.
Foundational studies of genome organization and population
structure will advance research to determine the genetic basis of
tick phenotypes, and efforts are ongoing to discover novel
chemistries that selectively disrupt molecular targets mined from
the genome. This study is a pioneering project for genome
research on ticks and mites of public health and veterinary
importance, with efforts proposed to expand genomic resources
across this phyletic group. In 2011, the National Institutes of
Health approved the sequencing of additional species of hard
ticks, including European and Asian Ixodes species, the soft
tick
Ornithodoros
moubata
(Family
Argasidae)
and
the
Leptotrombidium mite vector of scrub typhus (Superorder
Acariformes)68 (Supplementary Table 38). The I. scapularis
genome offers a roadmap for research on tick–host–pathogen
interactions to achieve the goals of the One Health Initiative69
and improve human, animal and ecosystem health on a global
scale.
Methods
Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation. The genome of I. scapularis
Wikel strain was sequenced in a joint effort by the Broad Institute and the JCVI
and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National
Institutes of Health. The I. scapularis Wikel strain (Quinnipiac University,
Hamden, CT) genome was sequenced to approximately 3.8-fold coverage using
Sanger sequencing and assembled using the Celera Assembler configured to
accommodate high repeat content within the genome and heterozygosity in the
donor population (Supplementary Table 1). The assembly and raw reads are
available at GenBank under the project accession ABJB010000000, consisting of
contig accessions ABJB010000001-ABJB011141594 and VectorBase as IscaW1, 3
May 2012. The annotation of the I. scapularis genome was performed via a joint
effort between the JCVI and VectorBase. The genome annotation release
(IscaW1.4) is available at VectorBase (https://www.vectorbase.org/) and GenBank
(accession ID: ABJB010000000). Forty-five bacterial artificial chromosome clones,
B183,834 ESTs and 45 microRNAs were also sequenced and annotated
(Supplementary Figs 4–6 and Supplementary Tables 4–6).
Proteomics of Ixodes-Anaplasma interactions. The I. scapularis ISE6 cells were
inoculated with A. phagocytophilum (human NY18 isolate) or left uninfected.
Uninfected and infected cultures (n ¼ 5 independent cultures each) were sampled
at early infection (11–17% infected cells (Avg±s.d., 13±2)) and late infection
(56–61% infected cells (Avg±s.d., 58±2)) and used for proteomics. Protein
extracts from the four experimental conditions, control uninfected early, infected
early, control uninfected late and infected late (100 mg each) were gel-concentrated,
digested overnight at 37 �C with 60 ng ml � 1 trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
and the resulting tryptic peptides from each proteome were extracted and iTRAQ
labelled for the analysis. The samples were fractionated by isoelectric focusing and
each fraction analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Surveyor LC system coupled to a linear ion trap
mass spectrometer model LTQ (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA) and protein
identification was carried out using SEQUEST algorithm (Bioworks 3.2 package,
Thermo Finnigan), allowing optional (Methionine oxidation) and fixed modifica-
tions (Cysteine carboxamidomethylation, Lysine and N-terminal modification of
þ 144.1020 Da). The MS/MS raw files were searched against the alphaproteo-
bacteria combined with the arachnida Swissprot database (Uniprot release 15.5,
7 July 2009) supplemented with porcine trypsin and human keratins. This joint
database contains 638,408 protein sequences. False discovery rate of identification
was controlled by searching the same collections of MS/MS spectra against inverted
databases constructed from the same target databases. The alphaproteobacteria
Swissprot database was used to identify Anaplasma and discard possible symbiotic
bacterial sequences from further analyses.
Ixodes scapularis genetic diversity and population structure. 74 RADseq
libraries were produced from female I. scapularis representing nine ‘populations’
from the states of Florida, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New
Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin and the Wikel reference colony. RADseq
libraries were constructed using 1 mg genomic DNA from individual ticks,
separately digested with the SbfI restriction enzyme. Adaptor ligated libraries were
pooled and sequenced at the Purdue Genomics Core Facility on the Illumina HiSeq
2500 in Rapid run mode. Further analysis was performed by the Bioinformatics
Core at Purdue University. Illumina reads were corrected for restriction site,
clustered and de-multiplexed (sorted by barcode) using the ‘process_radtags.pl’
script of STACKS. For SNP identification, reads from each sample were separately
aligned to the IscaW1 assembly using the end-to-end mode and default parameters
of Bowtie2 v 2.1.0. Genetic diversity within and between I. scapularis populations
was calculated using 745,760 SNPs across 35,460 polymorphic loci. F-statistics were
used to assess genetic distance or differentiation as evidence of selection where FIS
is the inbreeding coefficient of an individual (I) relative to the subpopulation (S)
and FST is the difference in allele frequency between subpopulations (S) compared
with the total population (T). The population structure of I. scapularis across North
America was separately analysed using a subset of 34,693 representative SNPs
(1 SNP per polymorphic locus). The ‘population’ step from STACKS was used to

Functional expression of tick LGICs. Expression studies were performed on
mature oocytes extracted from anaesthetised female Xenopus laevis. Briefly,
complementary RNA encoding IscaGluCl1 was injected at 1 mg ml � 1 using a
Drummond Nanoject injector into oocytes that had been treated for 20–40 min in a
2 mg ml � 1 solution of collagenase type 1A (Sigma UK) in calcium-free saline.
Following 3–5 days incubation at 18 �C in saline supplemented with penicillin
(100 units per ml), streptomycin (100 mg ml � 1), gentamycin (50 mg ml � 1) and
2.5 mM sodium pyruvate, oocytes were secured individually in a Perspex chamber
(B90 ml) and perfused continually in saline at 5 ml min � 1. They were impaled by
two glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl (resistance 1–5 MOhm in saline),
with which the oocytes were voltage clamped at � 100 mV using an Axoclamp 2A
amplifier. Solutions were applied in the perfusing saline. The saline consisted of
(in mM): NaCl 100, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, adjusted to pH 7.6 with
10 M NaOH.
