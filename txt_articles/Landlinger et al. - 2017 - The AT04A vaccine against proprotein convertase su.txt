Aims
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treat-
ment of hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis. PCSK9 binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor and en-
hances its degradation, which leads to the reduced clearance of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and a
higher risk of atherosclerosis. In this study, the AT04A anti-PCSK9 vaccine was evaluated for its therapeutic potential
in ameliorating or even preventing coronary heart disease in the atherogenic APOE*3Leiden.CETP mouse model.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Control and AT04A vaccine-treated mice were fed western-type diet for 18weeks. Antibody titres, plasma lipids, and in-
flammatory markers were monitored by ELISA, FPLC, and multiplexed immunoassay, respectively. The progression of ath-
erosclerosis was evaluated by histological analysis of serial cross-sections from the aortic sinus. The AT04A vaccine
induced high and persistent antibody levels against PCSK9, causing a significant reduction in plasma total cholesterol
(-53%, P< 0.001) and LDLc compared with controls. Plasma inflammatory markers such as serum amyloid A (SAA),
macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b/CCL4), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), cytokine stem cell
factor (SCF), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) were significantly diminished in AT04A-treated mice. As
a consequence, treatment with the AT04A vaccine resulted in a decrease in atherosclerotic lesion area (-64%, P= 0.004)
and aortic inflammation as well as in more lesion-free aortic segments (þ119%, P= 0.026), compared with control.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
AT04A vaccine induces an effective immune response against PCSK9 in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice, leading to a sig-
nificant reduction of plasma lipids, systemic and vascular inflammation, and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta.

Introduction
Elevated circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) is one
of the major risk factors positively correlated with premature
development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 The main pathway of
LDLc clearance from the blood circulation involves the LDLR on
hepatocytes.2,3 The serine protease PCSK9, mainly synthesized in the
liver, binds to the LDLR and enhances its degradation, thereby

modulating cholesterol levels of circulating apoB-containing lipopro-
teins (i.e., VLDL and LDL).4,5 By inhibiting PCSK9, LDLR expression
and its activity are increased, leading to plasma VLDL- and LDL-
cholesterol lowering.
The current hypothesis relating to the role of cholesterol in CVD
is that the effect of lowering LDLc on CVD is independent of the
means by which LDLc is lowered.6 The most commonly-used drugs
to treat hypercholesterolaemia are 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-
CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins. Statins in general have
been shown to reduce LDLc by 30–60%, providing an estimated 25–
30% reduction in CVD.7 However, many patients are unable to
achieve their optimal lipid levels despite intensive statin therapy,8,9
and high doses of statins may increase the incidence and severity of
multiple adverse events such as myopathy and hepatotoxicity.10
Moreover, statins do not only induce a beneficial increase in LDLR,
but also increase PCSK9, which leads to LDLR degradation, thus
causing a negative feedback response that attenuates the statins’ lipid
effects.11
The most advanced alternative approach for LDLc lowering is the
inhibition of PCSK9 action by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The
novel anti-PCSK9 antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab, which
were recently granted FDA approval, are safe and achieved a 50–70%
reduction in LDLc when used either as monotherapy or in combin-
ation with a statin.12,13 They are approved as second line treatment in
patients at risk who are unable to reach the LDLc goal despite max-
imally tolerated statin therapy or for patients who are statin-intoler-
ant.14,15 Preclinical efficacy studies with the PCSK9 mAb alirocumab
were performed in the APOE*3Leiden.CETP mouse model. These
double-transgenic mice represent a valuable model for the preclinical
evaluation of interventions on atherosclerosis development, because
of its humanized lipoprotein metabolism. The diet-induced develop-
ment of atherosclerosis in these mice has a pro-inflammatory plaque
phenotype, and shows responsiveness to all lipid-modulating inter-
ventions that are being used in the clinic.16–18 In this model, alirocu-
mab was able to decrease plasma lipids and atherosclerosis
development, and in combination with atorvastatin the beneficial ef-
fects of PCSK9 mAb treatment were enhanced.18,19 However, mAbs
show relatively short in vivo half-lives, thus the long-term efficacy of
mAb therapy is accompanied by frequent application and high costs.
We developed an active immunization against the body’s own
PCSK9 for a widely-applicable and more cost-effective long-term
LDLc cholesterol management.20 This so-called AT04A vaccine was
tested for its efficacy in APOE*3Leiden.CETP transgenic mice.
AT04A was able to induce a high immune response against PCSK9
without any side effects; leading to a significant reduction of plasma
lipids over the whole intervention period. Consequently, a reduction
of systemic and vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic lesions in
the aorta at the end of the intervention period was observed.
Materials and methods
Animals
Female APOE*3Leiden.CETP transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 back-
ground (7–9 weeks of age) were used. The number of animals per
group was calculated using a probability of 0.05. Based on our experi-
ence from previous studies, we expected to have a variance of 15%
(sigma 40%) in plasma lipids and a minimal effect of treatment of 30%,
resulting in 15 animals per group.
Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment
Committee of The Netherlands Organization of Applied Scientific
Research TNO under registration number 3655.
Treatment and analyses
Mice were immunized five times subcutaneously either with AT04A
or a control vaccine. Four weeks after prime immunization (W0)
normal chow was switched to WTD 0.1% (w/w) cholesterol in order
to induce atherosclerosis (see Supplementary material online, Figure
SI). Blood was withdrawn at the time points W-4, W0, W4, W8,
W12, W16, and W18 and used for the determination of the titre and
total cholesterol levels, the lipoprotein profile, and the plasma
PCSK9 concentration. After W18 the atherosclerotic lesion area and
severity in the aortic root of each individual mouse were assessed.
The plaque composition, the number of monocytes adhering to the
endothelium, ICAM-1 expression, and NLRP3 expression in macro-
phages were analysed.
Detailed information about materials and methods are provided in
the Supplementary material online.
Statistical and correlation analysis
All values were evaluated for homoscedasticity and normality
assumption using both Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk
normality tests. For the comparison of two groups, the unpaired
two-tailed Student’s t-test was used, followed by the Mann–Whitney
correction for non-parametric data as indicated in the respective
figure legend. A Spearman’s rank-order correlation was used to
determine the relation between two parameters. The software used
for statistical analyses were IBM SPSS Statistics version 18. The
P-values <
_ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
AT04A induces a strong and persistent
immune response and decreases plasma
PCSK9 levels
APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice were used as a model for atherosclerosis
with a pro-inflammatory plaque phenotype that can be induced upon
high fat and cholesterol-containing diet.
A peptide (AFFITOPEV
R ) which was previously designed to mimic
the N-terminal epitope of the mature human and homolog mouse
Translational perspective
• The present study is the first intervention study in a well-es-
tablished, translational mouse model for hyperlipidaemia and
atherosclerosis showing that active immunization against
PCSK9 reduces atherosclerosis development as well as sys-
temic and vascular inflammation. Anti-PCSK9 AT04A vaccine
may therefore represent an effective and economic approach
for the treatment and even prevention of cardiovascular
pathologies.

PCSK9 protein (153aa-692aa) was formulated into the AT04A vac-
cine.20 The mice were immunized with AT04A and control vaccine
five times in bi-weekly intervals, and an 18-week western type diet
(WTD) was started 4 weeks after prime immunization, which refers
to time point W0 (Figure 1A and Supplementary material online,
Figure SI). Titre analyses over time revealed that AT04A was able to
induce a specific and long-lasting immune response against PCSK9,
which reached a maximum mean titre of 1/12 243 (ODmax/2)
12weeks after prime immunization, which corresponds to W8 of
WTD. The immune response to PCSK9 highly varies between indi-
vidual mice and no statistically significant differences in titres of W4–
W18 were found (Figure 1A).
As expected, control immunized mice did not show any immune
response against PCSK9 (Figure 1A).
As evidence for a direct interaction between the induced anti-
PCSK9 antibodies and the target protein, the plasma concentration
of muPCSK9 in AT04A-treated vs. control immunized mice was
determined over time (Figure 1B and C). At the immunization start
(W-4) the PCSK9 level in AT4A and control treated group was com-
parable. However, in W4, W8, W12, and W18 AT04A vaccine
treated mice showed a highly significant decrease in PCSK9 concen-
tration of 57, 59, 49, and 24%, respectively (P < 0.001, P < 0.001,
P = 0.001, and P = 0.029, respectively) (Figure 1B) demonstrating a
consistent and long-lasting effectiveness of the AT04A vaccine (Figure
1C). Due to unknown reasons, the plasma PCSK9 level of control
treated mice dropped in W18, however, the difference between
AT04A and control treated mice remained significant (Figure 1B).
AT04A decreases plasma TC and
non-HDLc levels in APOE*3Leiden.
CETP mice
Four weeks after the cholesterol-containing WTD was initiated, con-
trol immunized APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice showed a strong increase
of plasma TC level from 3.4 mM (W0) to 15.5mM (W4), which re-
mained elevated until W18 (12.1 mM) (Figure 2A). In contrast, in the
AT04A immunized mice a sustained reduction of plasma TC from
W0 (2.8mM, P = 0.002) to W18 (7.8mM, P = 0.002) was observed
(Figure 2A). Thus, cholesterol exposure over the whole time period
of atherosclerosis inducing WTD (W0–W18) was decreased by 53%
(P < 0.001) in AT04A vs. control-treated mice (Figure 2B).
The TC lipoprotein profile of pooled plasmas per group was
determined by FPLC (Figure 2C–F). Plasma levels of HDLc remained
unaffected by AT04A vaccination, however the levels of non-HDLc
(VLDLc and LDLc) were clearly reduced (Figure 2F–H), indicating
that the anti-PCSK9 vaccine may be a powerful therapeutic approach

for long-term non-HDLc/LDLc management. A strong positive cor-
relation between TC and plasma PCSK9 concentration was found (rs
= 0.75; P < 0.001) suggesting a specific and effective targeting of
PCSK9 by AT04A vaccine.
AT04A reduces number, size, and
severity of atherosclerotic lesions in the
aorta
In order to assess the effect of AT04A on atherosclerotic development
upon 18weeks of WTD, the aortic root was isolated and the lesions as
well as the lesion severity were determined. AT04A vaccine-treated
mice showed a significantly reduced lesion area (-64%, P= 0.004; Figure
3A) and number of lesions per cross section (-35%, P= 0.037; Figure
3B), compared with controls. Moreover, in AT04A-vaccinated mice a
significant higher percentage of lesion-free area per section (þ119%,
P= 0.026) was detected (Figure 3C). The lesion severity was
categorized according to the American Heart Association guidelines.21
Although the relative amount of mild lesions (type I–III) was similarly
distributed between AT04A and control immunized mice, the more
severe lesions (type IV–V) were decreased in AT04A treated mice
(-64%, P= 0.051) (Figure 3C). Representative images of the differently
categorized atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root of AT04A and
control immunized mice are depicted in Figure 3D. A strong positive
correlation between the atherosclerotic lesion area and plasma TC as
well as plasma PCSK9 levels was observed (rs= 0.75, P< 0.001 and
rs= 0.6, P= 0.001, respectively).
AT04A immunization reduces necrotic
core content
The effects of AT04A vaccination on the plaque composition of se-
vere lesions (type IV–V) were assessed by immunohistochemistry.
The necrotic core areas including cholesterol clefts and lesion macro-
phages were quantified as pro-inflammatory factors, and smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) in the fibrotic cap and collagen area as fortifying
factors (Figure 4A). Representative images are shown in Figure 4B. All
data are expressed as percentages of total plaque areas. In AT04A-
treated mice the necrotic core area was 1.9 vs. 8.1% in the control-
treated group, representing a reduction of 77% (Figure 4A)
(P = 0.001). Macrophage, SMC, and collagen content were not signifi-
cantly altered by AT04A treatment. Despite the decrease in necrotic
core content, the plaque stability index was not changed, and was 2.3
in control and 3.0 in AT04A treated mice.
AT04A reduces vascular inflammation
Since atherosclerosis is not only a lipid-driven disease, but also a
chronic low-grade inflammatory disease of the vessel wall, the num-
ber of monocytes adhering to the activated endothelium, the expres-
sion of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in the endothelium as well as
the expression of the caspase-1-activating inflammasome protein
NLRP3 in macrophages was determined in the diseased aortic root
area. In the control group 2.3 monocytes per cross-section were
counted, compared with 1.4 in the AT04A-treated group (-38%,
P = 0.014) (Figure 5A). The reduction in monocyte adherence was

reinforced by a similar significant decrease in ICAM-1 expression in
endothelial cells upon AT04A vaccination (-37%, P = 0.018) (Figure
5B and C). Since NLRP3 is predominantly expressed by myeloid cells,
we determined the amount of NLRP3 expression in the macrophage
area and a decrease by 68% in AT04A compared with control treated
mice was observed (0.3± 0.2 vs. 0.9 ± 0.8, P = 0.06) (Figure 5D and E).
Together, these findings suggest that AT04A immunization results in
a reduction of activated endothelial cells and pro-inflammatory
macrophages.
AT04A decreases inflammatory
biomarkers
In order to assess system inflammation upon high-fat diet-induced
atherosclerosis in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice, a panel of plasma in-
flammatory markers was analysed. The liver-derived inflammation
marker serum amyloid A (SAA), reported to be elevated in diet-
induced atherosclerosis in mice,22 showed a significant reduction in
anti-PCSK9 AT04A treated mice at W4 (-21%; P = 0.007) and W8
(-28%; P < 0.001) relative to the negative control, but was not signifi-
cantly affected later in the study (see Supplementary material online,
Figure SII). Myriad RBM’s mouse inflammation multi-analyte profile
represents a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of multiple in-
flammatory biomarkers and pathways including cytokines, chemo-
kines, and growth factors. In plasma obtained 18weeks after the start
of WTD four markers, namely macrophage inflammatory protein-1b
(MIP-1b/CCL4), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22),
the cytokine stem cell factor (SCF), and vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGF-A), showed a significant reduction in AT04A
compared with control-immunized mice whereas the decreases in
SCF was most pronounced (see Supplementary material online,
Table SI). Furthermore, the macrophage colony stimulating factor 1

tended to be decreased (see Supplementary material online, Table
SI). A Spearman’s test showed a strong, positive correlation between
TC and SCF (rs = 0.65; P < 0.001) and VEGF-A (rs = 0.58; P = 0.001),
but not for TC and MIP-1b/CCL4 (rs = 0.02; P = 0.93) and MDC/
CCL22 (rs = 0.26; P = 0.18).
Safety aspects
No effects on viability, body weight, or food intake were found in the
AT04A-compared with control-immunized mice (see Supplementary
material online, Table SII). Liver weight, which is considered as a sensi-
tive indicator for toxicity, was not affected by AT04A vaccine-treated
mice (see Supplementary material online, Table SII). Moreover,
plasma pooled per group showed no apparent differences in aspar-
tate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) values as
markers of hepatocellular damage (see Supplementary material on-
line, Table SII). Other safety aspects such as absence of target-specific
T-cell response and absence of cross-reactivity of induced antibodies
with other endogenous proteins have been previously reported by
Galabova et al.20
Discussion
The present study shows that active immunization against PCSK9
with the so-called AT04A peptide-based vaccine elicits antibodies
that effectively bind and remove PCSK9 from the circulation and re-
duce circulating TC, (V)LDLc, TG, and biomarkers of inflammation,
which is accompanied by reduction of vascular inflammation and

atherosclerotic lesions and plaques in the aortas of a mouse model of

PCSK9 plays a fundamental role in LDL metabolism through the
binding and degradation of LDLR. With respect to LDLc as one of
the major risk factors positively correlated with premature develop-
ment of CVD,1 PCSK9 inhibition is supposed to reduce atheroscler-
otic events. Recently, the human PCSK9 mAbs evolocumab and
alirocumab reached FDA approval and were recommended in the

2016 ESC/EAS Guidelines14 as second line treatment for high LDLc
for adults whose cholesterol is not adequately controlled by diet or
statin treatment. However, whereas both mAbs reduced the inci-
dence of cardiovascular events in a post-hoc exploratory analysis,
trial results whether anti-PCSK9 mAb therapy actually reduces ath-
erosclerotic burden and CVD events is still under investigation.12,13
The main limitation for mAb therapies with broader applications
certainly is that their use for chronic disorders is cost-prohibitive.
Moreover, it has been reported that a substantial proportion of pa-
tients undergoing a sustained treatment with mAbs lose responsive-
ness over time due to the induction of anti-drug antibodies.23
Thus, an appealing new alternative to mAb-based therapies is the ac-
tive
immunization
against
self-antigens
involved
in
chronical
disorders.24,25
Previously, we showed that our AFFITOPEV
R-based anti-PCSK9 ac-
tive immunization approach is able to induce a strong humoral im-
mune response against PCSK9, which persisted for up to one year in
vaccinated mice.20 Furthermore, TC concentration was reduced by
up to 30% and LDLc up to 50% in anti-PCSK9 immunized compared
with control mice. Immunization against PCSK9 has also been tested
by others using different approaches.26 In the first approach, human
recombinant PCSK9, along with a DNA oligonucleotide as an adju-
vant, was tested and found to induce an approximately 40% reduc-
tion of LDLc in mice.27 Crossey et al.28 designed a human PCSK9
vaccine where PCSK9 peptides are displayed at high valency on the
surface of a bacteriophage virus-like particle, resulting in a �55% re-
duction of TC relative to controls
However, the present study is the first to show that active immun-
ization against PCSK9 does not only reduce TC and (V)LDLc, but also
has an impact on systemic and vascular inflammation and atheroscler-
otic development in a mouse model of diet-induced atherosclerosis.
Vaccination with AT04A, which led to a reduction of TC exposure by
53%, had a strong impact on atherosclerotic development. The
AT04A vaccine was able to induce a specific immune response against
PCSK9. In contrast to previously reported studies where an anti-
PCSK9 peptide vaccine20 as well as monoclonal anti-PCSK9 anti-
bodies19 rather stabilized the target protein and increased the murine
plasma PCSK9 level, AT04A-treated APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice
showed a reduction of the target protein exposure during the study
by 48%. Already after the second immunization with AT04A vaccine
the induced anti-PCSK9 antibody concentration was sufficient to sig-
nificantly decrease TC in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice on normal chow
(W0). Four weeks after the onset of WTD the anti-PCSK9 titre in
AT04A-vaccinated mice rose to approximately 1/4000, correspond-
ing to an antibody concentration of �200 mg/mL, and resulted in a TC
decrease of 63% compared with control (P< 0.001). Although the
mean anti-PCSK9 titre reached its maximum in week 8, no additional
TC lowering was found at this timepoint, indicating a plateau effect
after 4weeks with maximally retained efficacy during the study. Due
to this sustained TC reduction, anti-PCSK9 vaccine-treated mice
showed significantly less lesion areas (-64%, P = 0.004) and severity
(-64%, P = 0.051) in the aortic root compared with control.
Consistent with our data, Ku
¨hnast et al.18 reported a dose-dependent
decrease in atherosclerosis development in APOE*3Leiden.CETP
mice
treated
with
the
human
PCSK9
monoclonal
antibody
alirocumab. Notably, the AT04A vaccination was applied as a stand-
alone therapy and thus, future evaluations are required to test
whether these effects are still ensured on a statin background
treatment.
For many years, atherosclerosis was considered to be mainly a
lipid-driven disease caused by the continuous accumulation of choles-
terol in the arterial intima. However, it is increasingly recognized that
atherosclerosis is predominately a chronic low-grade inflammatory
disease of the vessel wall with an interplay of humoral, cellular, and
locally produced pro-inflammatory factors.29,30 One of the initial
stages of atherosclerotic disease is endothelial cell activation and the
recruitment of inflammatory cells to the vessel wall.29,30 Multi-analyte
profiling of inflammatory markers showed a reduction of several
cytokines with chemotactic activity for monocytes by AT04A vaccine
(see Supplementary material online, Table SI) which is in line with the
reduced expression of endothelial ICAM-1 and adherence of mono-
cytes to the vessel wall. The decreased levels of M-CSF-1 and VEGF-
A, which activate endothelial cells and stimulate monocyte/macro-
phage migration, may have additionally contributed to the reduction
in lesion number and size.
Interestingly, despite the reduced monocyte adherence, the
macrophage content was not affected by AT04A immunization.
A potential explanation is that the amount of macrophages is similar
but that the macrophages in the control group, are more activated
and overloaded with cholesterol which may result in damage and ne-
crosis. The necrotic core is a major characteristic of advanced ath-
erosclerotic lesions and plays an important role in both their
progression to a hazardous state and their vulnerability.31 To test this
hypothesis, we measured the necrotic core and NLRP3 as marker of
macrophage activation. Morphological analysis indicated that vaccin-
ation with AT04A strongly decreased the necrotic core content,
including cholesterol clefts, by 77%. Overload of lipid material in the
vessel wall leads to apoptosis and necrosis of foam cells,32 and to
deposition of cholesterol crystals,33,34 which stimulate caspase-1-
activating NLRP3 inflammasomes and aggravate the inflammatory re-
sponse.33,35 Indeed NLRP3 expression in the macrophage area was
three-fold increased in the control mice as compared to the AT04-
treated mice, which substantiates this hypothesis. Collectively, these
data indicate that immunization with AT04A diminishes the forma-
tion of a necrotic core and macrophage inflammation, which may
have contributed to the reduced inflammatory response in the vessel
wall and attenuation of atherosclerotic development.
Little is known about the pro-inflammatory role of PCSK9.
Inflammatory cytokines were measured in the plasma from septic
shock patients carrying either a PCSK9 LOF allele or a PCSK9 GOF
allele. Significantly lower plasma cytokine concentrations in patients
carrying a LOF allele were found.36 These results mirrored the data
obtained from PCSK9 knockout mice, which displayed decreases in
inflammatory cytokine production in response to LPS.36 It was also
reported that PCSK9 of macrophage origin directly promotes lesion
inflammation in mice, independently of systemic lipid changes. PCSK9
accumulated in the artery wall induced infiltration of pro-
inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes into the atherosclerotic lesion,
indicating a local effect of human PCSK9 on atherosclerotic lesion
composition.37 Thus, lowering of plasma PCSK9 levels per se may
also have direct local effects on vascular inflammation and athero-
sclerotic plaque formation. Unfortunately, we were not able to
examine the local effects of PCSK9 in aortic plaques due to known
technical limitations.38

The current challenge for the prevention of atherosclerotic events
is certainly the side-effect free lowering of lifetime LDLc exposure,
thus preventing chronic low-grade inflammatory disease of the vessel
walls. The association between the change in relative risk for CHD
and the absolute change in LDLc levels over lifetime due to genetic
variation has recently been emphasized.39
The AT04A anti-PCSK9 vaccine would be an ideal therapeutic
agent to fulfill these requirements for long-term LDLc management,
because of its sustained efficacy and cost-effective application, accom-
panied by anti-inflammatory effects. AT04A is currently being tested
in a phase I clinical trial.
