We engineered a microneedle patch integrated with cardiac stromal cells (MN-CSCs) for therapeutic heart regen-
eration after acute myocardial infarction (MI). To perform cell-based heart regeneration, cells are currently
delivered to the heart via direct muscle injection, intravascular infusion, or transplantation of epicardial patches.
The first two approaches suffer from poor cell retention, while epicardial patches integrate slowly with host my-
ocardium. Here, we used polymeric MNs to create “channels” between host myocardium and therapeutic CSCs.
These channels allow regenerative factors secreted by CSCs to be released into the injured myocardium to pro-
mote heart repair. In the rat MI model study, the application of the MN-CSC patch effectively augmented cardiac
functions and enhanced angiomyogenesis. In the porcine MI model study, MN-CSC patch application was non-
toxic and resulted in cardiac function protection. The MN system represents an innovative approach delivering
therapeutic cells for heart regeneration.
INTRODUCTION
On average, 635,000 Americans have a new coronary heart attack per
year, which is defined as the first instance of a hospitalized myocardial
infarction (MI) or a coronary heart disease death. Around 300,000 more
have a recurrent attack, and an additional 155,000 experience silent MIs
(1). Thirty-six percent of MI survivors will have an increased risk of
developing heart failure down the road (2, 3). To date, no approved
therapy has been developed to decrease the size of an established heart
scar (4). Stem cell therapy aims to improve the treatment options avail-
able to MI survivors. It seeks to curb adverse heart remodeling, to re-
generate viable myocardium, and to reduce scar size (5). In the past two
decades, stem cell therapies have gained attention as potential therapies
for many incurable diseases (6–8). Paracrine mechanism plays an essen-
tial role in adult stem cell–mediated tissue repair. For example, regen-
erative factors released from stem cells can promote endogenous repair
of the injured myocardium (9–11). We have been studying heart-
derived cardiac stem/stromal cells (CSCs) over the past several years
(12–14). The notion that injection of CSCs may offer beneficial effect
since mild to moderate MI has been confirmed in recently completed
clinical trials (15, 16). One major hurdle hampering the efficacy of CSC
therapy is the extremely low cell retention rate after delivery (17). Within
24 hours of delivery, more than 90% of injected cells are typically lost
(18, 19), regardless of the delivery route (such as intracoronary or intra-
myocardial injection). Bioengineering approaches, including injectable
biomaterials, cardiac patches, and magnetic/molecular targeting, have
been studied to improve cell engraftment rate (20). The cardiac patch
strategy can drastically improve cell retention (21). However, the chal-
lenge remains to integrate the transplanted biomaterials/stem cells
construct with the host myocardium. Previous reports indicated that
integration happened slowly (22).
Here, we described a polymeric microneedle patch integrated with
CSCs (MN-CSCs) for therapeutic heart regeneration. The painless MN
patches have been established as an effective transcutaneous delivery
device for transporting a variety of therapeutics (23–28). In this strategy,
the MN-CSC system offers unique advantages over conventional cardiac
patches: The MNs serve as the channels to allow for communication
between the patch and the host myocardium, as the transplanted patch
could get nutrients from the heart while releasing the paracrine factors
to repair the heart. We demonstrated that the MN-CSC patch could
promote healing in experimental animals of MI by promoting angio-
myogenesis, reducing scar size, and augmenting cardiac functions.
RESULTS
Characterization of MN array
The concept of MN-CSC cardiac patch therapy is illustrated in Fig. 1A.
Briefly, a MN patch was fabricated from an aqueous solution of bio-
compatible polymer poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a micromolding ap-
proach (23). The PVA is 99% hydrolyzed and has a molar mass of
89,000 to 98,000 g/mol. The prepared MN array patch was a 12-mm
by 12-mm patch with a 20 by 20 MN array. The needle had a conical
shape, with a base diameter of 300 mm, a tip diameter of 5 mm, and a
height of 600 mm, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B and fig. S1A). The MN had a
mechanical strength of ~2 N per needle (fig. S1B), which allowed for
sufficient skin penetration without breaking (29, 30). Meanwhile, the
integrity of the PVA MN was maintained without obvious deformation
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) during days 1, 3, and 7 (fig. S1C).
Biocompatibility of the MN array with CSCs
and cardiomyocytes
Rat CSCs (1 × 105) were encapsulated in the fibrin gel and then in-
tegrated onto the surface of MN array (Fig. 1C). The porous structure
of MN allowed the release of CSC factors through the polymeric
needles. The integrated MN-CSC patch was cultured by positioning

 into a microfluidic channel with Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
(IMDM) (Fig. 2A). LIVE/DEAD staining revealed excellent viability of
CSCs on day 3 in culture, and quantitative analysis indicated that the
viability of CSCs in fibrin gel was not compromised when cocultured on
MN array on days 1, 3, and 7 (Fig. 2B). After 3 days of culture, confocal
microscopy was usedto assess the distribution of the CSCs(green) with-
in the MN (red) patch (Fig. 2C). Z-stack reconstruction showed that
some CSCs migrated from the fibrin gel into the MN cavity (Fig. 2C).
Since most of the beneficial effects of CSC therapy were through their
secretion, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to
measure the concentrations of various CSC-secreted factors, namely,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the media under-
neath. The factors could be detected, and their release profiles were
similar to those of CSCs cultured on the tissue culture plate (TCP) at
various time points (Fig. 2D). We then tested the biocompatibility of
the MN-CSC patch in vitro with isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
(NRCMs). NRCMs were cultured with the presence of a MN or MN-CSC
patch in the media. A solitary NRCM culture was included as a con-
trol. LIVE/DEAD assay indicated the viability of NRCMs (Fig. 2E
and fig. S2), and quantitative analysis indicated that the morphology
and viability of NRCMs were not compromised when cocultured
with a MN or MN-CSC patch (Fig. 2, F and G). Moreover, time-lapse
videos revealed that coculture with a MN-CSC patch substantially
increased cardiomyocyte contractility (Fig. 2H and movies S1 to S3).
In addition, MN-CSCs robustly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation
(Fig. 2, I and J). Collectively, these data suggested that the MN patch
was nontoxic to cardiomyocytes and that MN-CSCs could promote
cardiomyocyte functions.
MN-CSC therapy in a rat MI model
We then went ahead to test the MN-CSC patch in rats with acute MI
(Fig. 3A). Immediately after left anterior descending (LAD) artery liga-
tion, a 0.5-cm by 0.5-cm MN-CSC patch containing 1 × 106 rat CSCs
was placed onto the MI area (Fig. 3B and movie S4). Hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining indicated that the MN-CSC patch was on the sur-
face of infarcted heart on day 7 (Fig. 3C). Cy5.5-labeled MNs could be
readily detected on the heart 7 days after the transplantation (Fig. 3D).
Furthermore, the tissue densities of CD68+ macrophages were identical
across all three groups (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the MN-CSC patch did
not aggravate the inflammation in the post-MI heart. In addition, no
evident raises in CD3/CD8+ T cell infiltration were observed in the
hearts treated with MN-CSC on day 7 (fig. S3). Treatment with the
MN-CSC patch reduced myocardial apoptosis (Fig. 3F) and promoted
myocyte proliferation (Fig. 3G) and angiogenesis (Fig. 3H). Masson’s
trichrome staining revealed heart morphology and fibrosis 3 weeks after
various treatments (Fig. 4A; red, viable tissue; blue, scar). M-mode echo-
cardiographic images showed the left ventricular (LV) wall motion after
different treatments (Fig. 4B). MN-CSC transplantation increased in-
farct wall thickness (Fig. 4C) and viable tissue in the affected area
(Fig. 4D). As a cardiac function indicator, LV ejection fractions
(LVEFs) were determined by echocardiography at baseline (4 hours
after MI) and 3 weeks afterward. The LVEFs at baseline were in-
distinguishable among all three groups, indicating a uniform degree

 of initial injury (Fig. 4E). Three weeks after treatment, the hearts that
received MN-CSC transplantation had the greatest LVEFs (Fig. 4F).
Compared to the MI control animals, the empty MN patch generated
neither beneficial nor detrimental effects in the post-MI heart. Addi-
tional rat studies were performed to compare the treatment effects
from a PVA patch with CSCs but no MNs (No–MN-CSC group)
and a MN CSC patch (MN-CSC). Masson’s trichrome staining re-
vealed heart morphology and fibrosis 3 weeks after treatment (fig.
S4A; red, viable tissue; blue, scar tissue). Compared to the non-MN
control, infarcted sizes were effectively controlled by MN-CSC patch
transplantation (fig. S4B). Also, viable tissue in the risk area (fig. S4C)
and infarct wall thickness (fig. S4D) were greater with MN-CSC patch
treatment. The LVEFs at baseline were indistinguishable between
these two groups, indicating a similar degree of initial injury (fig.
S5A). Three weeks after, the hearts that received MN-CSC patches
had greater LVEFs (fig. S5B). To address the toxicity issue of PVA
patches, we measured serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspar-
tate transaminase (AST) (for liver functions) (fig. S6, A and B), and cre-
atinine andbloodureanitrogen (BUN) levels (forkidney functions) (fig.
S6, C and D) 21 days after patch transplantation. The results indicate
that patch treatment did not induce any hepatic or renal function im-
pairment. Together, these results indicate that the MNs on the MN-
CSC patches are indispensable for the full therapeutic benefit. We
reason that the MNs provide a pathway for molecules to diffuse from
the CSCs to the site of injury (Figs. 2C and 3D) more efficiently than
the non-MN controls.
MN-CSC therapy in a porcine model of acute MI
Despite the widespread use of rodent models for cellular cardio-
myopathy, the use of the porcine model is well justified, as the pig heart
has human-like myocardial blood flow, ventricular mechanics, and
dimensions. Therefore, we performed a pilot porcine study on
MN-CSC cardiac patch. The safety and preliminary therapeutic efficacy
were determined in pigs with acute MI induced by LAD permanent
ligation (Fig. 5A). Successful open-chest surgical induction of MI
was verified by the elevation of the ST segment on electrocardiogram
(ECG) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level in serum (Fig. 5B and fig.
S7). Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of porcine heart
sections determined the infarct area 48 hours after MI (Fig. 5D). The
infarct sizes were the same across the two groups (Fig. 5C). The baseline
(4 hours after MI) and endpoint (48 hours after infarct) LVEFs were
measured as indicators of cardiac functions in both groups. The baseline
LVEFs were similar for both control and MN-CSC patch groups,
which indicated a similar degree of initial injury (Fig. 6A). However,
MN-CSC–treated group exhibited greater LVEFs than those from
the control group at 48 hours (Fig. 6B). LV fractional shortening
(LVFS) showed a similar trend (Fig. 6, D and E). We also calculated
treatment effects, i.e., the changes in LVEF and LVFS from the baseline
to the endpoint. While the control group displayed a functional decline,
treatment with MN-CSC patches preserved cardiac functions (Fig. 6, C
and F). To address the toxicity concerns of the MN-CSC patch, blood
was collected and tested at baseline (before MI surgery) and 48 hours
after MI. The concentrations of ALT and AST indicated that liver
functions were not impaired by the MN-CSC therapy (Fig. 6, G and
H). Also, the creatinine and BUN analyses indicated that MN-CSC
patch treatment did not induce any renal function impairment (Fig. 6,
I and J). Together, we conclude that MN-CSC patch transplantation
after acute MI could contribute to the preservation of cardiac function
without inducing toxicity.
DISCUSSION
“A bandage for a broken heart” has always been a dream for car-
diologists and tissue engineers. Here, we integrated therapeutic
CSCs with a MN array to form an innovative “cardiac patch.” Un-
like conventional cardiac patches (31–33), the prickly MNs can serve
as the communication channels between the transplanted CSCs and the
host myocardium. PVA has been widely used to fabricate hydrogels
for medical application because of its excellent biocompatibility
(34–36). In addition, PVA is used for MN fabrication here because
of its high mechanical strength in dry state and its ability to transport
solute in gel state after being inserted to skins, where PVA MN could
maintain its integrity as a gel within a short term (35, 37, 38), and
eventually get dissolved and absorbed by skins over a long period
(39, 40). Thus, the slow dissolution rate of PVA also provides sus-
tained release of regenerative factors from the encapsulated CSCs.
While biodegradable polymers are advantageous for medical appli-
cations, the degradation by-products and fragmentation of these
polymers may cause side effects as well. Providing the proof of con-
cept in the present studies, future studies will focus on the optimi-
zation of biodegradability and biocompatibility of the polymers for
the MN-CSC patches.
The in vitro experiment emulated the placement of the MN-
CSC patch on the surface of a heart to answer two questions: (i) Can
the media support CSC growth in the integrated device? and (ii)
Can CSC-derived factors be released into the media underneath?
(Fig. 2). We found that the viability of CSCs cultured on the MN
patch was not compromised, indicating that neither the PVA nor the
fibrin gel was toxic to the cells. Furthermore, CSC-secreted factors
were able to diffuse through the needles into the media. We then
cultured cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) in the media underneath the
MN-CSC patch. The viability of cardiomyocytes was not affected by
the placement of the MN-CSC patch. Instead, coculturing with the
MN-CSC patch promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and beating.
This was consistent with the observation when cardiomyocytes were
cocultured with CSCs (41, 42).
We then evaluated the in vivo biocompatibility of the MN-CSC
patch in rats with acute MI. Syngeneic rat CSCs were used to avoid
rejection of the transplanted cells. Nevertheless, foreign body reac-
tions could be triggered against the materials and structures of the
MN patch. It was confirmed that the MN-CSC could be successful-
ly placed onto the surface of the heart without the deconstruction
of the needles (Fig. 3). Moreover, the insertion of MNs (400 to 500 mm)
caused negligible cardiac tissue damage (Fig. 3). The myocardial
tissue density of CD68+ macrophages was indistinguishable among
the groups (Fig. 3), and there is no evidence of elevated infiltrations
of CD3/CD8-positive T cells in the heart treated with the MN-CSC
patch (fig. S3). In addition, the normal levels of ALT, AST, BUN,
and creatinine in the pig model treated with a MN patch confirmed
the safety and biocompatibility of the cardiac patch (Fig. 6). This
was consistent with the notion that PVA is a material with great
biocompatibility.
Next, we tested the hypothesis that the transplanted MN-CSC
patch could serve as a mini-drug plant for sustained release of re-
generative factors. Previous reports indicated that transplantation
of CSCs stimulated endogenous repair by reducing apoptosis and
promoting angiomyogenesis (12, 42). However, these effects were
not long lasting because of the poor retention/engraftment of CSCs.
These caveats were overcome by the MN-CSC strategy. MN-CSC ther-
apy robustly reduced myocardial apoptosis but increased the numbers

 of cycling cardiomyocytes and vasculatures in the peri-infarct area. Fur-
thermore, these protective and regenerative effects at the cellular level
translatedinto the improvement of overallheartmorphology and pump
function (Fig. 4). The hearts that received the MN-CSC patch had the
greatest wall thicknesses, viable tissues, and LVEFs. Following an acute
MI, the heart could undergo severe remodeling, which includes the
thinning of LV wall, the replacement of healthy myocardium with scar,
and the continuous deterioration of cardiac function. Transplantation
of a MN-CSC patch was not only able to alter this trajectory of mal-
adaptive remolding but also promoted cardiac repair. Moreover, the
safety and efficacy of MN-CSC cardiac patch were evaluated in a pig
model of acute MI. The result supported the notion that MN-CSC patch
transplantation could preserve cardiac pump function (Fig. 6).
It is worth noting that we delivered the MN-CSC patch through
open-chest surgery. In the future, minimally invasive approaches
should be explored to deploy this patch on the surface of the heart. Fur-
ther studies could also focus on the design of “smart” MN patches that
release regenerative factors in response to physiological environmental
stimulus in the post-MI heart (43, 44).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Derivation of rat CSCs
This methodology was taken from our previous study (45). CSCs were
explanted from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat hearts. Myocardial samples
were excised from WKY rats and cut into 2-mm3 fragments. These were
washed with PBS and partially digested with collagenase (Sigma-
Aldrich). They were then cultured in IMDM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Corning, Corning,
NY, USA) as cardiac explants on a fibronectin (Corning)–coated surface

 (0.5 mg/ml). Stromal-like cells and phase-bright cells emerged
from the cardiac explant. The explant-derived cells were passaged
with TrypLE Select (Gibco). Passaged cells were seeded in Ultra-
Low attachment flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) at a density of 2 ×
104 cells/ml. The spontaneous aggregation of these explant-derived
cells into cardiospheres was observed after 1 week. The cardiospheres
were then passaged into fibronectin-coated surfaces to complete the
generation of cardiosphere-derived CSCs. All cultures were incubated
in 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Fabrication and characterization of MNs
This methodology was taken from our previous study (46). MNs were
fabricated using five uniform silicone molds from Blueacre Technology
Ltd. The MNs have a 300-mm-diameter round base, which tapers for a
height of 600 mm before ending in a tip that is roughly 5 mm in radius.
The MNs were arranged 600 mm apart, tip to tip, in a 20 by 20 array.
First, aqueous PVA solution (10 weight %, 100 ml) was prepared and
deposited in a silicone mold, which was kept under vacuum for 20 min.
The mold was then centrifuged at 500 rpm for 20 min in a Hettich Uni-
versal 32R centrifuge to compact the gel solution into MN cavities.
Then, additional aqueous solutions of PVA (100 ml) were loaded into
the mold, and the above procedure was repeated several times, until a
total volume of 500 ml of PVA solution was added to the mold. Last,
each micromold was dried under vacuum for another 24 hours. Once
dried, the MN array patch was carefully separated from the silicone
mold for further application. An FEI Verios 460L field-emission
scanning electron microscope was used to assess the morphology of
the MNs. Cy5.5-labeled PVA MN was prepared similarly. In short,
Cy5.5 was first used to modify PEG5K-NH2, which was subsequently
dissolved in PVA aqueous solution to label the MN. The modification
of Cy5.5 with PEG5K could increase its water solubility and retention in
MN. A stress-strain gauge was used to determine the mechanical
strength of the MNs by pressing a stainless steel plate toward the
MNs on a DTS delaminator. The initial gauge between the tips of
MN and the plate was 2.00 mm, with the load cell capacity of 10.00 N.
The plate approached MNs at a speed of 0.1 mm/s. The force that led
to the failure of MNs was defined as the force at which the needle
began to buckle.
Preparation of MN-CSCs
This methodology was taken from our previous study (12). CSCs
were first encapsulated in fibrin gel (Baxter Healthcare Corp.) and
then placed on the basal side of MN patch to form MN-CSC. In
vitro, the MN-CSC patch was cultured in a four-well chamber with
20% FBS media. The viability of the cells was evaluated with a
LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity kit on days 1, 3, and 7. For con-
focal imaging, DiO-labeled CSCs were encapsulated in fibrin gel
and placed on the basal side of a Cy5.5-labeled MN patch. After
3 days of culture, the MN patch was imaged using a confocal mi-
croscope (Zeiss LSM 880).
In vitro cytokine release
This methodology was taken from our previous study (47). Rat CSCs
(1 × 105) or MN-CSC containing 1 × 105 rat CSCs were cultured in
1 ml of FBS-free media in a 24-well plate. Conditioned media were
collected from the plates on days 1, 3, and 7 to study the cells’ release
of growth factors. The concentrations of various growth factors in the
media were measured by ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN; B-Bridge International, Cupertino, CA) as per the manufac-
turer’s instructions. The growth factors assayed were HGF, VEGF,
and IGF-1.
Culture of NRCMs with MN-CSCs
NRCMs were derived from Sprague-Dawley rats as previous described
(48). We cultured NRCMs in a four-well chamber. A MN or MN-CSC
patch was placed on the surface of NRCMs. A solitary NRCM culture
was included as a control. A LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity kit was
used to determine the cell viability of NRCMs at day 3. The morphology
of the cells was characterized using National Institutes of Health (NIH)
ImageJ software. Cell proliferation was evaluated by the percentage of
a-SA/Ki67-positive cardiomyocytes by immunocytochemistry staining.
Immunogenicity studies on MN-CSC
Rats were anesthetized with ketamine. Then, their hearts were exposed
by left thoracotomy under sterile conditions. An MN-CSC patch
containing 1 × 106 CSCs was placed onto the heart. Those rats that
underwent the left thoracotomy but did not receive a patch were set
as normal control. After 7 days, all rats were sacrificed, and hearts were
collected and cryopreserved in optimum cutting temperature (OCT)
compound. They were then cryosectioned and fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde. Protein block solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA)
containing 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to
permeabilize and protein-block each section. The following primary
antibodies were used to target the desired proteins after an overnight
incubation at 4°C: mouse anti-CD8a (1:100; MCA48R, AbD Serotec,
Raleigh, NC) and rabbit anti-CD3 (1:100; ab16669, Abcam). Subse-
quently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) secondary antibodies
(1:100; Abcam) were usedfor the detection of primary antibodies. DAPI
(Life Technologies, NY, USA) was used to counterstain cell nuclei.
Images were taken with an Olympus epifluorescence microscope.
Rat model of MI
All animal work was compliant with the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at North Carolina State University. This methodology
was taken from our previous study (49). Briefly, rats were anesthetized
with ketamine and were positioned right laterally on a sterile operating
table. Their hearts were exposed by left thoracotomy, and their LAD
coronary arteries were permanently ligated to produce an acute MI. Im-
mediately after MI induction, one of the following randomized treat-
ments was administered to each rat: (i) MI group: MI induction
without any treatment; (ii) MI + MN group: MN patch was placed onto
the surface of infarcted heart; (iii) MI + CSC group: CSCs (1 × 106)
encapsulated in fibrin gel were placed onto the infarcted heart; (iv)
MI + MN-CSC group: MN-CSCs patch containing 1 × 106 CSCs was
placed onto the infarcted heart. After patch application with a gentle
pressure by tweezer tips for 30 s, we applied fibrin glue on the MN side
of the patch to aid adhesion.
Transplantation of patches with or without MNs in rats
with MI
All animal work was compliant with the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at North Carolina State University. Briefly, rats
were anesthetized with ketamine. Immediately after MI induction
(49), animals were randomized to receive one of the following two
treatments: (i) MI + No–MN-CSC group: a PVA patch without
MNs containing 1 × 106 CSCs was placed onto the infarcted heart;
(ii) MI + MN-CSC group: a MN-CSC patch containing 1 × 106 CSCs
was placed onto the infarcted heart. Serum ALT, AST, creatinine, and

 BUN levels were measured 21 days after transplantation. Normal range
for rats is as follows: ALT, 10 to 40 IU/liter; AST, 50 to 150 IU/liter (50);
creatinine, 0.1 to 0.55 mg/dl; BUN, 3.56 to 25.43 mg/dl (51).
Pig model of MI
All animal work was compliant with the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at North Carolina State University. Acute MI was in-
duced in female Yorkshire pigs (20 to 30 kg) by permanent ligation of
LADduring anopen-chest surgery (52).Twenty minutes afterischemia,
a 2.5-cm by 2.5-cm MN-CSC cardiac patch was placed on the heart to
cover the MI-injured area that is downstream of LAD (Silkam 2/0,
B. Braun Suture). The control animals received no cardiac patches. Af-
ter the procedures, all animals were closely monitored by university vet-
erinary services staff, and then the pigs were euthanized 48 hours after
MI injury. LVEFs were determined by echocardiography using a Philips
CX30 ultrasound system, coupled with an S4-2 high-frequency probe at
two time points (4 and 48 hours after MI). Blood was collected before
MI and 24 and 48 hours after MI. Infarct area of LV myocardium was
traced through the digital images of TTC staining (five slices) and
measured by ImageJ analysis. Then, the infarct ratio was measured
and calculated as Infarct size ¼ ∑5
n¼1ðslice infarcted area%�slice weightÞ
heart weight
� 100%.
TTC assay
This methodology was taken from our previous study (45). TTC assay
was performed to differentiate the active cardiactissue and the inactive
infarct cardiac tissue. A sterilized solution of TTC was made by dis-
solving TTC (2 g; MP Biomedicals LLC) into 200 ml of sterilized PBS
and then prewarmed at 37°C in the incubator for 30 min. The heart
was collected and washed with sterilized PBS and then placed in a freezer
until the heart became stiff. Five 7-mm sections were cut from apex
to bottom and incubated in prewarmed TTC solution at 37°C for
30 min. Afterward, 10% formaldehyde solution was applied for 2 hours
to fix the sections.
Cardiac function assessment
This methodology was taken from our previous study (12). Rats were
anesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen mixture before undergoing trans-
thoracic echocardiography in the supine position at 4 hours and
3 weeks. An animal cardiologist who was blinded to the experimental
design performed the procedure using a Philips CX30 ultrasound sys-
tem with a L15 high-frequency probe. The hearts were viewed in two-
dimension (2D) along the long axis, at the height of the greatest LV
diameter. The following formula was used to determine the EF:
(LVEDV − LVESV/LVEDV) ×100%. 2D guided ultrasound images
were captured in motion mode at the level of the chordae tendineae.
Heart morphometry
This methodology was taken from our previous study (12). All animals
were sacrificed 3 weeks after MI induction, after the echocardiography
study. Hearts were collected and cryopreserved in OCT compound.
Heart sections (10 mm thick) were cut from the apex to the height of
the ligation. Each section was cut at 100-mm intervals. Masson’s tri-
chrome [HT15 Trichrome Staining (Masson) Kit, Sigma-Aldrich]
staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
A PathScan Enabler IV slide scanner (Advanced Imaging Concepts,
Princeton, NJ) was used to acquire images of each stained section. These
were used to assess morphometric parameters (i.e., infarct thickness and
viable myocardium), which were quantified with NIH ImageJ software.
Histology
This methodology was taken from our previous study (12). For immu-
nohistochemistry, heart cryosections were fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde. Permeabilization and protein blocking were done with
protein block solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) containing 0.1% sapo-
nin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Proteins of interest in the samples
were targeted with the following primary antibodies after an overnight
incubation at 4°C: rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:100; ab15580, Abcam), mouse
anti-CD68 (1:100; ab955, Abcam), mouse anti–a-SA (1:100; a7811,
Sigma-Aldrich), and mouse anti-actin a–smoothmuscle (1:100; A5228,
Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies were conjugated with FITC or
Texas Red secondary antibodies (1:100; Abcam). For the cell apoptosis
assays, heart cryosections were incubated with TUNEL solution (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). DAPI (Life Technologies,
NY, USA) was used for nuclear staining. Images were taken with an
Olympus epifluorescence microscope.
For H&E staining, sections were fixed in hematoxylin (Sigma-
Aldrich, MO, USA) for 5 min at room temperature and then rinsed for
2 min in running water. The sections were then dipped in acid alcohol
for 2 s, in sodium bicarbonate (five dips), and in dehydrant (Richard-
Allan Scientific, MI, USA) for 30 s. They were subsequently submerged
in eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) for 2 min and thoroughly washed
in dehydrant and xylene (VWR, PA, USA).
Statistical analysis
This methodology was taken from our previous study (12). Results are
shown as means ± standard deviation. A two-tailed Student’s t test was
used to compare between two groups. One-way ANOVA, followed by
post hoc Bonferroni test, was used to compare among three or more
groups. If the P value is <0.05, the difference in means is considered
statistically significant.
