We conducted the first synthesis of theories on causal associations and pathways connecting degree of control
in the living environment to socio-economic inequalities in health-related outcomes. We identified the main
theories about how differences in ‘control over destiny’ could lead to socio-economic inequalities in health, and
conceptualised these at three distinct explanatory levels: micro/personal; meso/community; and macro/soci-
etal. These levels are interrelated but have rarely been considered together in the disparate literatures in which
they are located. This synthesis of theories provides new conceptual frameworks to contribute to the design
and conduct of theory-led evaluations of actions to tackle inequalities in health.

1. Introduction
In the public health literature, there is a growing recognition
that what Syme (1989) terms ‘control over one's destiny’ may be a
fundamental social determinant of health, and lack of control an
underlying cause of observed socio-economic inequalities in
health. Marmot, for example, emphasises:
“For people above a threshold of material wellbeing, another kind
of wellbeing is central. Autonomy – how much control you have
over your life – and the opportunities you have for full social
engagement and participation – are crucial for health, well-being
and longevity. It is inequality in these that plays a big part in
producing the social gradient” (Marmot, 2004: p2).
Concepts of control, autonomy and power to exercise choice are
potentially important factors in determining access to resources to
promote and maintain health. These notions are articulated in Amartya
Sen's theories of “freedom” and “capabilities”, for example, the sub-
stantive freedom to have opportunities and exercise choices over daily
life – and the degree to which different groups in the population have
that freedom (Sen,1999a). Sen contends that relative lack of control and
powerlessness are fundamental causes underpinning the socio-eco-
nomic inequalities in health observed between different groups within
the population. Similarly, the Global Commission on Social Determi-
nants of Health concluded that health inequalities are “caused by the
unequal distribution of power, income, goods and services, globally and
nationally” (CSDH, 2008: p.1). In making recommendations for tackling
these root causes in England, the 2010 Marmot Review stressed the
importance of creating the conditions for people to take control over
their lives and places “empowerment of individuals and communities is at
the centre of action to reduce health inequalities” (Marmot, 2010: p34).
This conviction is so strong that many national and global strategies
to promote population health and reduce inequalities include increas-
ing control and empowerment as central recommendations for action
(CSDH, 2008; Dahlgren and Whitehead, 2007; Marmot, 2010; WHO,
2013). Key questions remain, however, about what the principal path-
ways between control and health inequalities could be; whether there
is empirical evidence to support or refute hypothesised pathways and
whether anything can be done to boost empowerment and reduce
related health inequalities.
Some of these questions have been addressed specifically in relation
to the work environment. The theory of “demand and control”, for
example, and the generation of health-damaging stressors was origin-
ally developed in relation to the work environment (e.g. Karasek and
Theorell, 1990). Observational evidence showed that employees who
experienced the twin pressures of high job demands but low control in
their work were at higher risk of psychosocial stress, which has been
linked to physical conditions such as coronary heart disease (CHD)
(Bosma et al., 2005; Kuper and Marmot, 2003). Furthermore, exposure
to low job control increases with decreasing social position and may
have contributed to the observed social variations in CHD incidence
(Marmot et al., 1997). Subsequent evidence has emphasised the im-
portance of job control and social support at work. This has led to the
hypothesis that interventions to increase control at work and improve
the quality of social support may reduce exposure to psychosocial
stressors and thereby improve health (Kuper et al., 2005; da Costa and
Vieira, 2010).
But what is known about the pathways and mechanisms op-
erating in the wider living environment, beyond the circumscribed
setting of the work environment? Much less attention in the sci-
entific literature has been paid to the concept of control in the day-
to-day living environment and pathways to health inequalities. In
the Whitehall II study, people who reported low control at home
had a higher risk of depression, and it also predicted heart disease
in women, but not men. There is some evidence that the level of
control in the living environment varies by social position (as there
is for control in the work environment), suggesting potential
pathways to inequalities in health (Marmot, 2004; Chandola et al.,
2004). There are many relevant studies regarding control in the
living environment in disparate literatures, which have not been
brought together to address questions of impact at the population
level. We therefore set out to fill this evidence gap, by conducting a
critical review of theory (the focus of this paper), as well as sys-
tematic reviews of the observational and intervention evidence
related to control in the living environment.
Here, we report the findings from our critical review addressing
the review question: what theories and conceptual frameworks have
addressed the causal associations and pathways connecting degree of
control in the living environment to socio-economic inequalities in
health-related outcomes?
2. Methods
2.1. Locating the theories
Interest is growing in the development of appropriate methods
for review and synthesis of theories in the public health field
(Lorenc et al., 2012; Bonell et al., 2013; Campbell et al., 2014;
Pound and Campbell, 2015a, 2015b). We were guided by these
methods, and built upon the approach developed in our mapping
review of theories on pathways between crime, fear of crime, and
mental health (Lorenc et al., 2012), as follows.
First, we anticipated the need for an iterative approach to searching
and to search diverse literatures to identify theories about causal
pathways between control in the living environment and the genera-
tion of health inequalities. We identified three central literatures:
� public health/health inequalities/social determinants of health;
� health development/global health;
� sociological/community development.
Second, from our expert knowledge of these three fields and
suggestions from subject experts, we identified a small number of
seminal texts, which were widely acknowledged as influential in the
theoretical discourses on control in the living environment. We then
employed a ‘pearl-growing’ approach, which involved hand searching
the reference lists of each seminal paper for other relevant publica-
tions, then widening the search further by citation chasing in an
iterative process. Key informants (including project co-investigators
and the authors of seminal papers) were also asked to identify spe-
cialist websites and relevant papers in press, as well as books and book
chapters where theoretical works are more likely to be published.
Third, the identification of relevant theories was supplemented as
the theory review progressed, by noting theoretical discourses found in
empirical studies when we conducted systematic reviews of observa-
tional and intervention studies as part of a wider evidence synthesis
project. We continued to identify theories until saturation was reached.

 2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Theories had to describe a hypothesised causal pathway from some
concept of ‘control’ in the living environment (see Box 1) to socio-
economic inequalities in health, given our focus on the generation and
maintenance of socio-economic inequalities in health. To be included,
the theories had to include all three of the following components:
a) An explanation of how degree of control could influence
health or health-related factors. Control had to be con-
ceptualised as an individual’s or group’s power over decisions
that affect their daily lives. Terms that are used in the litera-
ture to imply similar meanings to ‘control’ by this definition,
included power, empowerment, autonomy, self-determina-
tion, agency. ‘Mastery’ theories were excluded where mastery
was conceptualised as self-control/mastery over one’s own
emotions, which implies restriction rather than freedom.
b) Clear location of the theory in the living environment.
Theories concerning the work environment were therefore
excluded.
c) An explanation of how systematic differences in health-related
outcomes could evolve between different gender, ethnic or
socio-economic groups.
The absence of components b) and c) led to the exclusion of much
of the psychological literature, for example, the substantial body of
literature on theories of perceived ‘locus of control’ and association
with health outcomes, when the theory did not reference the social
context in which people live or the processes by which differences in
locus of control could result in socio-economic inequalities in health.
Similarly, theories of self-efficacy that had component a) were ex-
cluded if they did not also have components b) and c). For the same
reasons, much of the literature about the impact that patients could
have if they had control over the decisions affecting their health was
excluded because they did not contain components b) and c).
2.3. Synthesis
Key theoretical elements of the works identified and meeting the
inclusion criteria were summarised as a critical narrative review. This
involved holding a series of reflective sessions in which we mapped
out the hypothesised pathways from control in the living environ-
ment to health inequalities in the form of logic models. We con-
sidered similarities and contrasts between the theoretical discourses
in the identified texts and developed a set of frameworks for
grouping the potential pathways by the level at which they operated.
We incorporated all identified theories that contained the three es-
sential components (a, b and c) into the logic models (Section 3). The
pathways in the logic models are all supported by the theories that
we encountered, though not necessarily by the empirical evidence
that we obtained at a later stage. We did not filter the theories on the
grounds of plausibility (they are all included), nor did we make any
judgement about which were major and which were minor path-
ways. We concluded that we would need the results from our sys-
tematic review of empirical studies to be able to make such assess-
ments of plausibility and major/minor pathway.
3. Results
The three central literatures produced distinct theories that, in
the main, did not cross-reference: the public health/social de-
terminants of health literature yielded theories at the micro-level;
the sociological/community development literature focussed on the
meso-level, and the health development references addressed
macro-level theories. The pearl-growing from seminal papers
Box 1–Definitions of the notion of control (or lack of it).
Individual:
Autonomy: freedom to act and make decisions for oneself. “How much control you have over your life” (Marmot, 2004: p2).
Control over one’s destiny: “the ability of people to deal with the forces that affect their lives, even if they decide not to deal with
them” (Syme, 2004: p3). This notion is tied up with hope for the future - lack of ‘control over destiny’ engenders hopelessness/no hope
for the future.
Ontological security: “The confidence that most human beings have in the continuity of their self-identity and in the constancy of
their social and material environments. Basic to a feeling of ontological security is a sense of the reliability of persons and things”
(Giddens, 1991: p92).
Sense of coherence: Part of having a sense of coherence is a) comprehensibility: knowing/expecting that there is some coherence
or continuity to your life; b) manageability: a belief that things are manageable and within your control, and that you have the
resources and skills to do so; and c) meaningfulness: a belief that things in life are worthwhile, and that there is a good reason to
survive and face challenges (Antonovsky, 1993).
Power: is the ability to exert one’s influence to effect change on the behalf of oneself or others (Phelan et al., 2010)
Powerlessness: “an objective phenomenon, where people with little or no political or economic power lack the means to gain
greater control and resources in their lives” (Albee, 1981 in: Wallerstein, 1992: p 193). The converse is ‘empowerment’ – an outcome
as well as a process.
Perceived control/control beliefs: individuals’ beliefs about the extent to which they can control or influence [health] outcomes
(Skinner, 1996)
‘Real’ control/actual control: the amount of control that individuals are able to exercise [over their living environment in this case].
Collective:
Community control/empowerment: “a social action process by which individuals, communities, and organisations gain mastery
over their lives in the context of changing their social and political environment to improve equity and quality of life” (Wallerstein,
2002: p73).
Cultural continuity: has similarities with the notion of ontological security above: a sense of ownership of a collective past and
stability in the future (Chandler and Lalonde, 2008).
Collective efficacy/perceived neighbourhood control: The belief of community members that they have the capacity to create
change (Sampson et al. 1997).
Power with (rather than power over): “a limitless expanding resource, which comes from within and from collaborative work with
others and leads to empowered communities as people empower themselves”(Wallerstein, 2002: p74).
Social protective factors: defined as an interaction of: Community empowerment, community capacity, community competence,
social cohesion, collective efficacy, sense of community, social capital (Wallerstein, 1992). Note that Wallerstein makes a distinction
between ‘community empowerment’ and ‘social capital’ seeing them both as separate but interacting social protective factors.

 yielded the most material, with that gleaned from the supplemen-
tary electronic searches of empirical studies providing elaborations
of theories that had already been identified by the citation chasing.
3.1. Concepts of ‘control’
From the theories we reviewed, it is clear that there are many
understandings of control – how it can operate at different levels
(personal, community, and society) – and how it can concern beliefs,
perceptions, and senses, on the one hand, and processes and out-
comes on the other. Common notions of control identified in the
relevant literature are summarised in Box 1.
During the reflective sessions, we considered similarities and
contrasts between the theoretical discourses, and discerned that
explanations were conceived as operating at three main levels
(Table 1). This classification draws on the Dahlgren and Whitehead
(1993) model, which conceptualises the main determinants of
health as interacting layers of influence, one over the other, op-
erating at the individual, community, system and macro-en-
vironmental levels. We outline the theoretical pathways at each
level and their intersections in the following three sections.
3.2. Micro/personal level theories
At the micro level, theories suggest mechanisms by which
people in lower social positions experience lower control over
their destiny, including a relative deficit of resources needed for
health and wellbeing. This low control in turn causes chronic
stress responses, which can lead to higher prevalence of physical
and mental health problems than their more advantaged coun-
terparts. Theories can be divided into those that concern pathways
leading from ‘real’ or ‘actual’ control and those leading from
‘perceived’ control, as detailed below.
3.2.1. The ‘actual’ control pathways
Two, inter-related strands of theory connect the experience of
low social position with poorer physical and mental health, as
depicted in Fig. 1. The top strand is concerned with the role of ‘real’
or ‘actual’ control (as opposed to ‘perceived’ control/control beliefs
depicted in the lower strand). Actual control relates to the amount
of control that individuals are able to exercise over their living
environment through the economic and social resources they have
at their disposal. Theory proposes that people in low social posi-
tions have fewer resources to cope with the excessive demands
that their life entails, compared with people in higher positions
Table 1
The identified theories were conceptualised at three distinct explanatory levels.
Level
Description
1. Micro/personal
A person’s social position influences the resources they have to control their destiny (in terms of money, power, information, prestige) and influence
critical decisions affecting their lives.
2. Meso/community
Notions of community/collective control go beyond individual circumstances to encompass the strength/power generated by joining together to
have greater influence over material and social conditions in immediate neighbourhoods/living space.
3. Macro/societal
Cultural orientation towards different groups in the population (for example son preference and gender bias) and socio-political transitions (for
example, experiences of former USSR countries) operate at the level of whole societies, influencing the degree of control that members of a society
have over their lives.

 (Lundberg et al. 2007). This leads to low actual control over des-
tiny, in terms of money, power, information, prestige (Syme, 1989,
2004). It also leads to a decline in the power that an individual has
to influence critical decisions affecting their lives (Marmot, 2004).
Lower control over, and amount of, economic and social resources
experienced by people in low social positions is hypothesised to
have both direct and indirect effects on health. The direct effect is
through greater exposure to health-damaging living environ-
ments, leading to poorer health for people in lower social positions
(CSDH, 2008).
The indirect effect is posited to operate through chronic stress
responses. With low control, demand overload goes up, causing a
decline in ability to cope with stressful home and work en-
vironments, and a decline in ontological security, as the world is
experienced as an insecure, unpredictable place (Giddens, 1991;
Hiscock et al., 2001). Demand overload, powerlessness and in-
security are hypothesised to induce chronic stress responses
(which have been found to be higher in people in low social
positions (Steptoe, 2006)) which lead to poorer health in terms of
both mental and physical conditions (Syme, 1989, 2004; Marmot,
2004; Bosma, 2006; Phelan et al., 2010). The physiological me-
chanism entails chronic stressors stimulating biological systems
by
activating
autonomic,
neuroendocrine,
immune
and
in-
flammatory responses. This also leads to the release of hormones,
such as cortisol and adrenaline (epinephrine), which have effects
on peripheral tissues, e.g. cortisol stimulates glucose production
in the liver, and helps release free fatty acids from fat stores;
activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to increased
blood pressure and heart rate, and stimulation of blood clotting
factors. If systems are exposed to repeated stimulation, such as
with chronic stressors, dysregulation may occur, resulting in
adverse health outcomes (Steptoe, 2006).
Charlton and White (1995) introduce the notion of differential
“margins of resources” as an explanatory variable for socio-eco-
nomic inequalities in health. They hypothesise that access to re-
sources, balanced by needs, results in a margin of resources, at an
individual level – a reserve of resources – the size of which pre-
dicts social position and thus level of inequality. The size of this
margin in turn influences the degree of autonomy/choice/control
and time preference that people in different social positions have,
which together influence health-related behaviours, access to
health care, avoidance of health risks, and so on. ‘Time preference’
in this context means the degree to which an individual can invest
their current resources in an uncertain future (Adams, 2009). For
more disadvantaged groups, income and employment are in-
secure, which makes the future uncertain and difficult to plan for.
In such circumstances, it is postulated, more disadvantaged groups
may choose gains that are almost certain today (present time
preference), rather than less certain gains in the future. This may
lead to the decision to smoke or drink, for example, to gain instant
benefit, even if there is a known risk of health damaging effects of
the behaviour sometime in the future. Conversely, more ad-
vantaged groups, with more financial and job security, are able to
be more future-orientated, and may find it easier to forego the
present attractions of smoking or drinking to achieve greater
health benefit in the future (Adams, 2009).
The emphasis on differential resources also chimes with the
‘theory of fundamental causes’ developed primarily by Link and
Phelan (Link and Phelan, 1995; Phelan et al., 2004; Phelan et al.,
2010). They developed the theory to explain why the association
between low socio-economic position and poorer health had
persisted over many decades (even centuries), despite the demise
of earlier risk factors and diseases that appeared to explain the
association. They evoke the notion of an array of resources, in-
cluding power and beneficial social connections, but also encom-
passing money, knowledge and prestige, which individuals and
groups deploy to avoid risk and adopt protective strategies. They
propose that there is a social gradient in these key resources
embodied in different social positions, which thereby allows
people in more privileged social positions to gain a health ad-
vantage, and in the process reproduces the observed health in-
equalities (Phelan et al., 2010).
3.2.2. The ‘perceived’ control pathways
In the second (lower) strand depicted in Fig. 1, theories con-
cerning ‘perceived control’/control beliefs are invoked. One line of
reasoning is that children growing up in families with low socio-
economic positions are socialised into being fatalistic, believing
that they have lower control over their destiny than their more
privileged counterparts, and these low control beliefs continue
and are amplified in adulthood (Wheaton, 1980; Bosma et al.
1999). The hypothesis is that they have low expectations of what
they can achieve in life and a relative lack of orientation towards
the future, in large part because they are subjected to the low-
expectations for them of significant others, such as families, tea-
chers, prospective employers, because of their low position. Low
control beliefs are postulated to lead to contrasting psychological
responses. Firstly, there may be an aggressive response involving
anger and hostility, which can induce chronic stress responses and
also lead to an increase in health-damaging behaviour, such as
smoking and problem drinking. The idea is that feelings of having
little control over what happens to you – of feeling trapped – can
evoke frustration and anxiety that brings out an aggressive coping
strategy (Wilkinson, 1999; Schrijvers et al., 2002). Secondly, low
control beliefs may evoke a passive response, such as ineffective
coping, low self-efficacy or esteem, which may go on to induce
depression (Ross and Mirowsky, 1989) and reduce success in
changing behaviour for the better – you have to have some hope
for the future to successfully quit smoking (Charlton and White,
1995). Thirdly, there may be a direct effect of low control beliefs on
metabolic disturbance – induced by chronic exposure to stressors.
These may lead on to such responses as higher risks of CVD, lower
endocrine and immune function (Bosma, 2006; Marmot, 2004;
Steptoe, 2006). All these pathways may result in poorer physical
and mental health with declining social positions.
In Fig. 1 there is a two-way arrow connecting low control to low
control beliefs, because one may induce the other: people who
have low actual control may quite realistically hold low control
beliefs – the beliefs reflect the reality of their day-to-day lives.
Conversely, low control beliefs may lead children not to do as well
as they could at school, going for lower paid jobs or failing to get
jobs, all of which may put them in a position of low actual control
over resources.
3.3. Meso/community level theories
At the meso/community level, the theories centre on the pro-
cesses by which people interact with the places in which they live.
The starting point for this explanation is disadvantaged living
environments, and the interaction between disadvantaged people
and places that may produce a sense of collective threat and
powerlessness. Together, these act as chronic stressors, which over
time are damaging to health. Contrasting theories, on the other
hand, maintain that the converse of powerlessness – community
empowerment – may result from the interaction between people
and place, when community members act together for mutual
benefit and challenge unhealthy material conditions, or attract
resources to their neighbourhood, to make it a better place to live.
There is a distinct class of theories on mechanisms conceptualised
as operating at the ecological level – the interaction of places with
people, leading from some form of collective control to health,
illustrated in Fig. 2. These theories are detailed as follows.

 3.3.1. Neighbourhood disorder
One line of reasoning, depicted in the lower pathways of Fig. 2,
stems from sociological studies of stressors at the neighbourhood
level, leading to theories of neighbourhood disorder: concerning
both the sociological processes that create neighbourhood dis-
order and the multiple effects on health and wellbeing of that
disorder. The theories were developed predominantly, though not
exclusively, from sociological studies of deteriorating trends hap-
pening in US cities (Wallace and Wallace 1990; Pearlin, 1989; Hill
et al., 2005; Latkin and Curry, 2003; Mirowsky and Ross, 2003). In
environments of concentrated disadvantage – where both the
places and the people suffer multiple disadvantages – conditions
may interact to produce neighbourhood disorder, characterised by
minimal safety, low investment or divestment/‘hollowing out’ of
public services including health, social welfare, fire and police
protection; segregation; and high transience/turnover of residents
(high
“churn”)
(Wallace,
1993).
Residents
experience
these
neighbourhoods as dangerous and threatening, and collective
threat is alienating and distressing even though few people get
personally victimized (Ross, 2011).
In Fig. 2, there can also be a direct pathway leading from
neighbourhood disorder to the generation of a widespread sense
of powerlessness, which may lead to anger and depression. A
common narrative is that collective threat is alienating and in-
creases the sense of mistrust and powerlessness amongst re-
sidents, which in turn lead to psychological distress – anxiety,
anger, depression, and other responses to chronic stressors – and
on to poorer mental and physical health and wellbeing. Key in-
teractions here are posited to be between collective mistrust and
perceived powerlessness. The sense of powerlessness can be re-
inforced if it takes place within a threatening environment, so that
collective mistrust is amplified. Conversely, a sense of control (as
opposed to powerlessness) in a threatening environment would
moderate collective mistrust (Ross, 2011).
3.3.2. Collective control/empowerment pathway
The upper pathway of Fig. 2 depicts pathways from collective
control/empowerment
to
health
drawn
from
the
health
promotion, community development, and poverty-reduction lit-
eratures. These meso-level pathways start with environments of
concentrated disadvantage or poverty, as with neighbourhood
disorder theories, but asks the positive question about whether
there are social protective factors in any given community which
interact with its capacity to challenge unhealthy material condi-
tions, “even in the face of concentrated disadvantage or poverty”
(Wallerstein, 2002: p73). In the social determinants of health lit-
erature, powerlessness is seen as a core risk factor for disease and,
conversely, that empowerment can be an important strategy for
improving a population's health (Syme, 1989; Marmot, 2004; Po-
pay, 2010).
Powerlessness, or lack of control over one’s destiny, is seen as a
chronic stressor, growing out of the day-to-day experience of
hard-pressed communities, living in hardship over a long period of
time. The hypothesis is that “lack of control over destiny produces a
susceptibility to ill-health for people who live in high demand or
chronically marginalised situations and who lack adequate resources,
supports, or abilities to exert control over their lives” (Waller-
stein,1992: p 202).
The converse of powerlessness is seen as community em-
powerment, which is a strategy to develop ‘power with others’
(rather than ‘power over others’) to bring about social and poli-
tical change (Rifkin, 2003). Wallerstein envisages community
empowerment as “a multi-level construct that involves people as-
suming control and mastery over their lives in the context of their
social and political environment; they gain a sense of control and
purposefulness to exert political power as they participate in the
democratic life of their communities for social change… A study of
empowerment,
therefore,
implies
not
just
studying
individual
change, but also change in the social setting itself” (Wallerstein,
1992: p 198).
Health outcomes from community empowerment are hy-
pothesised to be direct, for example when neighbourhood activity
successfully prevents placement of a toxic waste facility in the area
or when community action leads to the passing of a clean air or-
dinance. Indirect health effects may also occur through the re-
duction in social isolation that participation in the community
Fig. 2. Meso/community pathways from low control to socio-economic inequalities in health.
M. Whitehead et al. / Health & Place 39 (2016) 51–61
56
 activities brings about, which in turn leads to improved mental
health (Wallerstein, 2002).
The notion is that community empowerment in Fig. 2 is both
an outcome and a process (Perkins and Zimmerman, 1995; Zim-
merman, 2000). It is an outcome of the interaction of place with
social protective factors operating in the community such as so-
cial cohesion, community capacity, ontological security or sense
of continuity (Hiscock et al. 2001), which help to create the
conditions for community empowerment. But community em-
powerment could be considered a social protective factor in its
own right – forming part of the process that results in greater
community control over decisions that affect residents’ daily
lives. Recently, the notion of social protective factors has been
elaborated to include ‘health assets’ that communities possess
(Morgan et al. 2010).
The positive health impacts achieved when community mem-
bers act together for mutual benefit are proposed to operate
through both direct and indirect pathways. The potential direct
pathways include a reduction in exposure to environmental toxins
as a result of collective control, and the garnering of resources to
prevent or mitigate risks to health (Popay, et al. 2007; De Vos et al.
2009). There may also be indirect pathways – through improving
social supports and supportive networks which combat social
isolation and foster a sense of connectedness and community
competence. These in turn may help foster trust in the neigh-
bourhood and neighbours, reducing alienation and distress (Ber-
nard et al. 2007).
One potentially negative pathway leading from community
empowerment to greater distress/ill-health has been posited by
some commentators (Hunt, 1987, Popay, 2010). This stems from
the reality that there is only so much that communities can do,
even if working together highly effectively, to change the larger
political, socioeconomic and cultural forces that shape their dis-
advantaged environment. There is a risk of ‘burn-out’ or dis-
illusionment
among
community
activists
when
heightened
awareness leads them to realise the limits of their influence. In
these circumstances, instead of heightening control over destiny,
the process may add to a sense of powerlessness - in a vicious
circle that is harmful for health. Well-meaning community de-
velopment projects can also raise expectations which might not be
met, leading to further disillusionment.
3.4. Macro/societal level theories
At the macro/societal level, theories recognised the importance
of considering people in their societal context. People live in so-
cieties with varying degrees of exclusion and discrimination. These
theories posit that cultural, social or political processes that ex-
clude or discriminate against whole sections of society result in
low status and hence low control of discriminated groups over
access to the necessities for health.
The notion of control as an important experiential factor in
people’s lives comes through in the health development literature.
Amartya Sen, for example, expresses the view that:
“The success of an economy and of a society cannot be separated
from the lives that the members of the society are able to lead.
Since we not only value living well and satisfactorily, but also
appreciate having control over our own lives” (Sen, 2003a).
Observation of the debilitating lack of control over everyday life
experienced by poor rural women in parts of South Asia was the
inspiration for Amartya Sen’s investigations into the world’s
‘missing women’ (Sen, 1989a; 2003) and his notion of develop-
ment as a form of freedom: freedom and capabilities to live a long
and healthy life (Sen, 1989b; 1999a). Cultural orientation towards
different groups in the population (for example, son preference
and gender bias) and socio-political transitions (for example,
during the macro-economic transitions experienced by former
USSR countries) operate at the level of whole societies, influencing
the degree of control that members of a society feel they have, and
actually do have, over their lives. Mechanisms concerning the
position of women in society and the effects of massive social
transitions, in particular, can only really be understood at the so-
cietal level, as detailed in the following.
3.4.1. Gender discrimination and the low status of women
Amartya Sen’s philosophical theories of “freedom” and “cap-
abilities” have been influential in shaping thinking about the im-
portance of control in human development. In particular, Sen’s
work has focused attention on the lack of freedom and its health
consequences for women in contexts where there is gender bias in
relative care (Sen 1999a; 1999b). Fig. 3 illustrates the hypothesised
pathways between the low status of women in societies with overt
gender discrimination, and health and wellbeing outcomes.
Fig. 3. Pathways from women’s low status in society to poorer health outcomes.
M. Whitehead et al. / Health & Place 39 (2016) 51–61
57
 The central theory is that low female status in particular so-
cieties may lead to reduced control for women over their access to
food and nutrition, health services, education and employment
opportunities, as well as reduced access to household resources
and fertility and reproductive rights (Sen, 2001; Sen 1999a; Sen
1999b). These processes may lead to poorer population health
outcomes through higher rates of domestic violence against wo-
men and girls, and of malnutrition; lower rates of access to es-
sential health care, reduced schooling and subsequent income,
which leads on to poorer health outcomes compared with women
in societies without such a degree of gender discrimination
(Allendorf, 2007; Shen, 1997; Wickrama and Lorenz, 2002).
In addition, in societies with marked son preference, further
mechanisms are posited as coming into play, depicted at the foot of
Fig. 3. Countries with entrenched cultural preferences for boys over
girls (‘son preference’) include China, India, Pakistan, Egypt, Ban-
gladesh, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Algeria, Turkey and Tunisia. There
is an indirect pathway from son preference to poorer health out-
comes though reduced access to food and nutrition, education,
employment and health care, which leads on to poorer nutrition, as
part of a relative neglect of girl children, which cumulatively leads
to poorer health outcomes (Asfaw et al. 2010; Jayachandran and
Kuziemko, 2011, Osmani and Sen, 2003). But a more direct pathway
to higher death rates and lower survival chances has also been
postulated: through mechanisms such as infanticide of girl babies,
and – in recent decades when technologies have developed – the
practice of sex selective abortion (Banister, 2004; Klasen and Wink,
2003). Sen contends that progress in bringing female death rates
down in some son preference countries (as part of a general im-
provement in population health) has been counterbalanced by a
rise in sex-selective abortion (Sen, 2003b). As well as having a direct
effect on the survival chances of female foetuses, girls and women,
commentators warn of wider societal impacts of having fewer
women than normal in the adult population, including, in China in
particular, having millions of men without spouses or children. The
posited consequences include increased risks of coerced marriage,
bride abduction, trafficking of women and girls, sexual exploitation
and violence across communities (Bongaarts, 2013).
3.4.2. Theories about the loss of control and health during rapid
socioeconomic transition
Distinct theories about mechanisms operating at the macro/
societal level arise from observations of the health impact of the
collapse of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s. This brought
with it sharp social and economic crises in the countries con-
cerned across the whole population, coupled with declines in life
expectancy on a scale unprecedented in European peacetime his-
tory in modern times (Shkolnikov et al., 2001). Furthermore, the
impact on life expectancy was not evenly spread across the po-
pulation, but affected the worst-off in society the most (Shkolni-
kov et al., 1998). The hypothesised pathways involving loss of
control at a societal level are depicted in Fig. 4.
Debates about the potential causes of the decline in life ex-
pectancy as a result of this natural experiment in reduced societal
control have featured the change in material factors, such as an
increase in poverty and unemployment, and psychosocial factors
including an increase in both stressful life events, and the feeling
that everyday life is being turned upside down and spinning out of
control (Cornia and Paniccia, 2000). A further reaction to such
stressors in some former Soviet Union countries, at least in Russia,
has been posited to be through behavioural pathways, such as
people, particularly men, turning more and more to alcohol to
cope with overwhelming stressors, with resulting effects on
mortality and morbidity (Moskalewicz et al., 2000).
The pathways in Fig. 4 start with the rapid social, economic and
political transition in the former Soviet Union causing insecurity,
and in some cases a breakdown, in the systems that people rely on
in their everyday life: insecurity in the labour market, un-
employment, decline in social protection and health care systems,
breakdown in law and order, increases in poverty and family in-
stability (Cornia and Paniccia, 2000). All these insecurities/loss of
control contribute to an increase in health risks across the popu-
lation, including rises in psychological and somatic responses to
chronic stressors, violence, substance misuse as a form of coping,
and exposure to environmental hazards as safety standards de-
cline (McKee, 2001). These in turn lead to physical and mental
health problems. The social fabric of the society also suffers in such
conditions, with lower levels of perceived control and agency
causing a loss of optimism/hope for the future, loss of trust and
perceptions of security, which in turn feed into increased health
risks, and ultimately poor population health and wellbeing.
3.5. Interactions between levels
From our synthesis, we contend that the micro, meso, and
macro-level explanations should not be considered in isolation,
Fig. 4. Pathways from traumatic societal transitions to poorer population health.
M. Whitehead et al. / Health & Place 39 (2016) 51–61
58
 but as part of a comprehensive whole, as there are mechanisms at
each level that interact with other levels. Our assertion draws on
the Dahlgren and Whitehead (1993) model, which conceptualises
the main determinants of health as interacting layers of influence,
one over the other, operating at the individual, community, system
and macro-environmental levels.
The micro-level explanations in our synthesis of theories start
from the premise, without necessarily stating it explicitly, that
there are mechanisms operating at the community and societal
level influencing the social positions in which people end up, the
differing social context in which they live, and the resulting dif-
ferentials in power associated with those positions in a particular
society. Most of these micro-level explanations assume that people
in less privileged social positions have less control over their
destiny than their counterparts in more privileged positions. The
reasons, we contend, also stem from interactions with the meso
and macro levels.
Most of the meso-level explanations of the pathways from
collective control to socio-economic inequalities in health start
with the premise that communities living in materially and so-
cially disadvantaged places have less control over the decisions
that influence their day-to-day lives and less power to influence
change for the better. This begs the question: why? And the an-
swers need to draw on micro-level explanations (the socio-
economic composition of the local population and how that in-
fluences collective control), interacting with macro-level influ-
ences from societal culture, politics and policy. A paradox is that
these individual and societal influences interact to produce a new
phenomenon – collective control – which cannot, for example, be
reduced to, or measured by, indicators of individual control.
At the macro-level, explanations of the low status and low
control of women in societies with overt gender discrimination
focus on the operations of historical, cultural and gender power
relations at the political and organisational levels. But they also
bring in how these power relations are experienced by women at a
more personal level – in the neighbourhoods and households in
which they live.
4. Discussion
Our review has identified some key theories on how differ-
ences in ‘control over destiny’ could lead to socio-economic in-
equalities in health, which we conceptualised as being at three
distinct explanatory levels. There are explanations that stem from
social position of individuals (micro/personal level); those that
start with the place/community context in which people live, and
its interaction with people (meso/community level); and those
that deal with the whole societal context (macro/societal level).
These levels are interrelated; an important innovation in our study
is to bring together, for the first time, the various theories con-
cerning pathways from low control to the generation of socio-
economic inequalities in health, which have previously tended to
be viewed in isolation. This synthesis thus brings a new lens to
both the theoretical and policy debate on causes and action on
socio-economic inequalities in health.
There are limitations to this synthesis of theory which should
be considered. All four frameworks depicted in Figs. 1–4 start with
low status and low control of one form or another and follow the
pathways from there to socio-economic inequalities in health. In
doing so, we missed out the processes that come beforehand – the
theories of social stratification by which people end up in different
social positions with different degrees of power. We also did not
seek to synthesise the counter-theories and critiques of the the-
ories that are discussed here. This is partly because any one of the
links on the postulated causal pathways depicted in Figs. 1–4
would require a paper of its own to offer a meaningful critique. It is
also because, after the synthesis of theories, the next logical step is
to look at the empirical evidence for the hypothesised pathways.
The empirical evidence will support or refute the separate links
and help eliminate the pathways for which there is little or no
supporting evidence. This process in turn should reveal alternative
theories for the phenomena under study. Most important of all, we
had to draw a boundary around the theories to make the task
manageable and ultimately useful for informing future strategy
development. In this way, these limitations are also a strength.
The synthesis of these disparate theories, and their classifica-
tion into distinct levels, serve several important purposes in terms
of illuminating further research and public health strategy devel-
opment. First, identifying the potential pathways and mechanisms
suggests causal linkages to explore empirically. What is the em-
pirical evidence to support or refute these hypothesised causal
pathways? Are some pathways more important than others in
generating health inequalities? Figs. 1–4 can be used as logic
models to design both systematic reviews of the observational
evidence and empirical studies to test specific links in the chain. To
this end, we have undertaken a series of systematic reviews of the
observational and intervention evidence in an attempt to assess
the various potential pathways (forthcoming).
Second, the synthesis points to different types of evidence that
would need to be examined and suggests a range of diverse lit-
eratures to search. Where would you look for the evidence? The
answer may be different for different levels. Most of the high
quality evidence for the micro-level pathways in Fig. 1 comes from
longitudinal cohort studies in the social epidemiology/health in-
equalities literature. But cohort studies would be of much less use
when examining the impact of son preference on female survival
chances at the macro-level, for example. In this case, evidence
from demographic studies of population sex ratios from the health
development literature, together with qualitative studies of the
experiences of women in son preference countries, would be in-
formative. Likewise, some of the meso-level community control
linkages are investigated in the community psychology and com-
munity development literatures, as well as in sociology and poli-
tical science. The notion of control itself differs markedly across
the different bodies of literature, but also varies depending on the
level at which control is conceptualised. This is reflected in the
diverse markers or measures of control employed within the
studies: collective control is very different from individual control
and requires a whole new approach to the development of in-
dicators to capture the phenomenon. This adds to the complexity
of doing this theory review of such diverse literatures.
Third, the ‘logic models’ that we have developed suggest points
along the pathways for possible intervention to reduce the asso-
ciated socio-economic inequalities in health or their determinants.
The possibilities and relative effectiveness of intervening on one
pathway versus another can then be investigated. For example, at
the micro/personal level, should interventions be aimed at low
control beliefs and self-efficacy of more disadvantaged socio-
economic groups, or on their lack of resources to cope with ex-
cessive demands? Would interventions operating at multiple le-
vels be more effective? Our synthesis of theories should provide
new conceptual frameworks to contribute to the design and con-
duct of theory-led evaluations of actions to tackle socio-economic
inequalities in health.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have brought together three distinct sets of
literature and identified the principal theories exploring how dif-
ferences in ‘control over destiny’ could lead to socio-economic

59
 inequalities in health. We grouped the theories by the level at
which
they
operated:
micro/personal;
meso/community
and
macro/societal and identified several principal pathways by which
low control could be linked to poorer physical and mental health
in poorer groups.
Explanations stem from being in a low social position; living in
a disadvantaged environment with a sense of collective threat and
powerlessness and the degree to which people are discriminated
against and excluded from the society in which they live. At each
level and for each pathway we suggest causal linkages to explore
empirically, as well as possible points for future intervention. To
our knowledge this is the first synthesis to explore the principal
pathways through which control in the living environment could
influence health and health inequalities.
