Abstract
Background Adequate recovery from exercise is essential
to maintain performance throughout training and compe-
tition. While compression garments (CG) have been
demonstrated to accelerate recovery, the literature is
clouded by conflicting results and uncertainty over the
optimal conditions of use.
Objectives A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the
effects of CG on the recovery of strength, power and
endurance performance following an initial bout of resis-
tance, running, or non-load-bearing endurance (metabolic)
exercise.
Methods Change-score data were extracted from 23 peer-
reviewed studies on healthy participants. Recovery was
quantified by converting into standardized mean effect
sizes (ES) [±95% confidence interval (CI)]. The effects of
time (0–2, 2–8, 24,[
24 h), pressure (
\
15 vs. C15 mmHg)
and training status (trained vs. untrained) were also
assessed.
Results CG
demonstrated
small,
very
likely
benefits
[p \ 0.001, ES = 0.38 (95% CI 0.25, 0.51)], which were
not influenced by pressure (p = 0.06) or training status
(p = 0.64). Strength recovery was subject to greater
benefits than other outcomes [p \ 0.001, ES = 0.62 (95%
CI 0.39, 0.84)], displaying large, very likely benefits at
2–8 h [p \ 0.001, ES = 1.14 (95% CI 0.72, 1.56)] and
[
24 h [p \ 0.001, ES = 1.03 (95% CI 0.48, 1.57)].
Recovery from using CG was greatest following resistance
exercise [p \ 0.001, ES = 0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.61)],
demonstrating the largest, very likely benefits at [
24 h
[p \ 0.001, ES = 1.33 (95% CI 0.80, 1.85)]. Recovery
from
metabolic
exercise
(p = 0.01)
was
significant,
although large, very likely benefits emerged only for
cycling performance at 24 h post-exercise [p = 0.01,
ES = 1.05 (95% CI 0.25, 1.85)].
Conclusion The largest benefits resulting from CG were for
strength recovery from 2 to 8 h and [
24 h. Considering
exercise modality, compression most effectively enhanced
recovery from resistance exercise, particularly at time points
[
24 h. The use of CG would also be recommended to
enhance next-day cycling performance. The benefits of CG
in relation to applied pressures and participant training status
are unclear and limited by the paucity of reported data.
Key Points
Small, significant and very likely benefits on exercise
recovery can be achieved through use of
compression garments (CG).
The greatest benefits from CG are evident in
recovery of strength performance and from
resistance exercise, which may imply that CG
ameliorate muscle damage.
Next day cycling performance was also subject to
large, very likely benefits following the use of CG.

 1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Establishing effective recovery methods for elite athletes is
essential in order to increase the likelihood of victory, and
to maintain training intensity in the face of ever improving
performances and increasing training loads [1, 2]. While
maintaining a high volume and intensity of training is
necessary for optimizing training adaptation [3], athletes
must
also aim
to
preserve
competitive
performance
throughout multiple weekly [4] or even daily contests [5].
In short, athletes who recover faster are likely to perform
better and train harder [6].
Recent years have seen the emergence of a number of
interventions aimed at accelerating recovery, including
cold water immersion [7], contrast bathing [8], and com-
pression garments (CG) [9]. However, recovery demands
following training are highly specific to the intensity,
duration and modality of exercise [10]. For example, while
cycling performance is limited by metabolite accumulation
and substrate depletion [11], it is also subject to relatively
low levels of muscle damage in comparison to load-bearing
exercise [12]. Such specificity may in part explain the
conflicting evidence surrounding many emerging recovery
interventions, as the damage incurred by different activities
will require distinct physiological processes for regenera-
tion [13]. Proper consideration of both exercise modality
and subsequent performance outcome is therefore integral
to the efficacy of any recovery strategy [10, 13].
In particular, the use of CG for recovery has been the
subject of much speculation over the physiological mech-
anisms responsible [9, 14]. Compression has been proposed
to prevent performance deterioration and improve recovery
by accelerating nutrient delivery [15, 16] and metabolite
removal [17, 18], as well as by ameliorating post-exercise
oedema, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and
muscle damage [19]. More importantly, such physiological
benefits to recovery are frequently observed alongside
accelerated recovery of muscular power [20], strength
[21, 22] and endurance. As athletic performance is a
composite of many physiological and psychological fac-
tors, it is possible that CG aid recovery on a number of
levels. One of the most thoroughly investigated mecha-
nisms for the benefits of CG [16, 19, 21] is the potential of
such garments to minimize the symptoms of the exercise-
induced muscle damage (EIMD) that typically occurs as a
result of unaccustomed or eccentric exercise [23]. Whilst
eccentric exercise is beneficial for training power [24, 25],
strength and hypertrophy [26], such exercise is extremely
damaging. Strength production may be impaired for up to
10 days [27, 28], while EIMD is also associated with both
swelling and DOMS, which typically peak between 36 and
48 h [19]. Furthermore, as any load-bearing exercise will
induce EIMD because of the inherent eccentric nature of
running [12], muscle damage is an inescapable part of
training for the majority of athletes.
Whilst the mechanisms behind the recovery benefits of
CG are still unclear, the application of external compres-
sion is known to influence several areas of haemodynamic
and cellular function [29]. In a clinical setting, CG have
been shown to compress dilated veins and reduce venous
reflux to enhance venous return and reduce oedema [30].
This also increases ‘‘muscle pump’’ to accelerate blood
flow [31]. A similar mechanism may underlie the benefits
of CG in an exercise setting. For example, enhanced
recovery of strength and power performance is frequently
reported alongside reduced levels of oedema [19]. While
the successful management of oedema helps to reduce
DOMS and increase mobility [16], this effect may also
attenuate the progression of muscle damage. Fluid accu-
mulation in muscle tissue increases osmotic pressure and
subsequent cell lysis [32], while CG have been shown to
reduce
cellular
trauma
alongside
swelling
[30,
32].
Reductions in circulating levels of the intramuscular pro-
tein creatine kinase (CK) are frequently reported when CG
are worn following exercise [19, 20, 33]. Haemodynamic
effects of CG have also been postulated to aid recovery by
enhancing
levels
of
nutrient
delivery
[15,
16]
and
metabolite removal [34, 35]. Accordingly, observations of
reduced muscle damage following post-exercise compres-
sion have been suggested to reflect enhanced cellular
regeneration and protein synthesis [16] made possible by
enhanced circulation [17].
Despite the prevailing consensus shifting in favour of
CG as a recovery aid [9, 22, 36], recent reviews highlight
inconsistent and variable results [9, 14, 34, 37]. For
example, the recovery of strength has been frequently
improved by CG at time points over 24 h, with reported
benefits over controls consistently ranging from between 5
and 10% [9, 19, 21, 34, 38]. Conversely, CG were asso-
ciated with impaired recovery of acceleration (2.5%)
compared with controls following a 3-day basketball
tournament [6], while recent reviews suggest compression
confers only trivial effects on recovery from running
[37, 39]. These discrepancies are likely due to the specific
nature of post-exercise recovery demands arising from
distinct exercise challenges and subsequent performance
measures [12]. Variation in the populations studied may
also influence the efficacy of CG [14, 40]. EIMD is known
to elicit protective neurophysiological adaptations that
reduce the damage arising from subsequent bouts [41].
This phenomenon has been termed the repeated bout effect
and has been seen to last at least 6 months in untrained
participants [40], becoming less pronounced as tolerance to
F. Brown et al.
123
 EIMD improves in line with training status [41]. Training
history may therefore influence the efficacy of CG. In
addition, variation in the duration of CG application,
whether CG are worn during and after, or after exercise
only, as well as the assessment of recovery at different time
points, all continue to obstruct researchers’ ability to draw
definitive conclusions [14, 34, 39].
As CG are defined by the capacity to provide external
pressure to the body surface [14], it could be argued that
controlling for exerted pressure is the foremost priority for
making any firm conclusions on efficacy. Many clinical
benefits of CG appear to be proportional to the pressure
they exert, from reducing swelling [29, 42] to augmenting
blood flow [43]. However, many studies have neglected to
report the pressures applied by CG [22], have calculated
pressures by indirect modelling techniques [19], have
estimated pressures from manufacturer recommendations
[33] or have cited pressures measured in prior trials [44].
These inconsistencies have prevented definitive conclu-
sions being made on the effects of CG pressure on recovery
[34, 39], as indirect measures would likely be inaccurate
given the wide variation arising from anthropometric dif-
ferences [45]. As a result, off-the-shelf garments fitted
according to the height and mass of an individual are
unlikely to fit correctly. The relationship between the
pressures exerted by CG and the ensuing recovery benefits
has yet to be elucidated.
1.2 Objectives
The aim of this analysis was to systematically review the
effects of CG for exercise recovery, in relation to exercise
modality, subsequent performance outcomes, the duration
and timing of CG application, participant training status
and applied pressure.
2 Methods
2.1 Literature Search
Randomized controlled trials on the use of CG for per-
formance recovery in healthy humans were identified fol-
lowing a search of academic databases using the following
terms: [(compression garment OR compression tights OR
compression stockings OR tights OR stockings OR gar-
ments) AND recovery AND (exercise OR EIMD OR per-
formance OR recovery OR sport OR athlete)]. The
databases SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and PubMed
were used to identify academic papers (written in English),
from the start of records until May 2016. Relevant papers
were used for reference and citation searching. Only arti-
cles from peer-reviewed academic journals were included.
Results were also screened with use of the Web of Science
filters for ‘‘categories’’ [biochemical research methods OR
biochemistry OR molecular biology OR biology OR
physiology OR applied chemistry OR materials science OR
biomaterials OR sport sciences OR engineering (biomedi-
cal)] AND ‘‘research areas’’ (sport sciences OR life sci-
ences OR biomedicine OR biochemistry OR molecular
biology).
2.2 Outcome Variables
Changes from baseline scores were extracted from studies
that assessed the effects of CG (all types) compared to a
control condition on the recovery of maximal physical
performance following exercise. Standardized mean effect
sizes (ES) were calculated from the differences in pre–post
change scores between CG and control groups, using the
standard deviation of these changes (SDchange). Accepted
performance outcomes included the following: strength,
power and endurance. Power outcomes had to measure the
rate at which force was applied, and therefore included
jump height, sprint speed/time, and wattage from force
dynamometry protocols. Endurance performance, however,
was defined as any continuous measured outcome that
surpassed 1 min in duration and would be limited by aer-
obic capacity (below which outcomes were classified as
power). Strength measures must have reported perfor-
mance in units of mass, weight or force, and included force
dynamometry, as well as total and maximum loads lifted in
resistance
protocols.
To
differentiate
between
trials
assessing recovery and performance, only studies that
featured a temporal separation between an initial damaging
intervention
and
subsequent
performance
tests
were
included. For example, bouts of repeated sprinting or
resistance exercise that featured rests between sets met our
criteria if CG were worn throughout recovery periods.
2.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies that did not yield change-score data were excluded
from the analysis. Trials were excluded if CG were used in
combination with an additional treatment (e.g. nutritional
supplements) and if CG were not worn during or imme-
diately after exercise (within 2 h). Studies were therefore
excluded if CG were worn only throughout exercise and
subsequently removed before the recovery period. Studies
of clinical populations were excluded, as were studies that
failed to provide sufficient data for the analysis of ES.
2.4 Data Collection and Risk of Bias Assessment
Change scores were extracted or calculated from selected
studies. Where insufficient raw data were reported, these

 were requested from corresponding authors or extrapolated
from figures after digital magnification. In accordance with
current guidelines for conducting meta-analyses [46],
where SDchange was not available, values were calculated
using a correlation coefficient derived from studies that
provided sufficient data [33, 44, 47]. Results were assessed
with the I2 statistic, quantifying the percentage of vari-
ability in ES from heterogeneity, rather than chance [48].
This was used to guide subsequent subgroup analysis. Risk
of bias was reported in accordance with current consensus
[46].
2.5 Stratification of Studies
Studies were categorized into three groups, according to
the characteristics of the exercise used prior to the CG
recovery intervention. The stratification was guided by the
results of previous research, noting differences in recovery
demands between high-intensity sports and lab-based
eccentric damage protocols [7]. Accordingly, papers were
grouped into studies on resistance exercise (defined as
those that specifically targeted muscle damage with resis-
tance training, force dynamometry or drop-jumps), run-
ning, and metabolic exercise protocols (defined as non-
load-bearing endurance exercise, which included cycling or
skiing
ergometry).
Subsequently,
results
were
also
analysed according to performance measures, being divi-
ded into strength, power and endurance outcomes. Fur-
thermore, the relative benefits of CG were assessed in
relation to the time point of subsequent testing, results
being grouped into those taken at 0–2, 2–8, 24 and[
24 h.
Additionally, the influence of pressure on recovery was
assessed by grouping studies into those that applied a (di-
rectly measured) minimum of C15 mmHg at the thigh and
those that utilized looser fitting garments. This level of
compression pressure is required for enhanced venous
return [43]. Finally, studies were also grouped according to
participant training status, trained individuals being defined
as those regularly competing in a given sport, belonging to
a sports club, or those regularly exercising three or more
times per week. Participants were classified as untrained if
described as such by the authors [19, 49] or they were
inexperienced in the exercise modality that was studied
[50, 51].
2.6 Statistical Analysis
Data were analysed using the RevMan statistical software
package (version 5.0; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The
Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, 2011) [46]. Stan-
dardized mean ES and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
reported as (ES [LCL, UCL]), where LCL and UCL

 represent the lower and upper 95% confidence limits,
respectively. Subgroup differences were presented as
p values with v2 scores, while the likelihood of independent
results was presented as p values alongside corresponding
z scores. The threshold values for standardized changes
were as follows: B0.2 (trivial), [
0.2 (small), [
0.5 (mod-
erate) and [
0.8 (large), where 0.2 was taken to represent
the smallest worthwhile effect [52]. The threshold for
statistical significance was set at p = 0.05, and changes
were deemed very likely beneficial if the 95% CI cleared
the threshold for the smallest worthwhile change [36, 52].
Effects were deemed unlikely beneficial if the 95% CI
extended across the threshold for the smallest worthwhile
change.
3 Results
3.1 Summary
In total, 136 data points from 23 studies were included in
the analysis of the effect of CG over time (Table 1; Fig. 1).
These spanned from 1995 to 2015, and included a total of
348 participants (256 males and 92 females). Trials fea-
tured the use of graduated tights (11 trials, 149 partici-
pants),
stockings
(two
trials,
40
participants),
knee
socks/calf sleeves (two trials, 44 participants), arm sleeves
(four trials, 71 participants), whole body garments (three
trials, 34 participants), and a sleeved top (one trial, ten
participants). After omitting anthropometric data from one
study that reported insufficient results, the mean age and
body mass of the participants were 25 ± 9 years and 74.9
± 8.7 kg, respectively. These data were also used to
compare and quantify the effects of CG for different
performance outcomes, exercise modalities, and participant
training status. A significant (p \ 0.001, z = 5.53), small
and very likely beneficial effect of compression on recov-
ery was observed when compared with a control group
[ES = 0.38 (95% CI 0.25, 0.51)]. Risk of bias is indicated
in Fig. 2.
3.2 Analysis of Pressure
Three studies were identified in the high-pressure group,
applying pressures from 18 to 18.3 mmHg [53, 55, 62],
while five studies [21, 35, 44, 59, 63] reported directly
measuring pressures \
15 mmHg (4.8–11.8 mmHg). No
effect of compression pressure on the magnitude of

 3.3 Training Status
No significant difference was found between the effects of
CG on the recovery of trained and untrained participants
across all time points, considering all exercise modalities
and performance outcomes (p = 0.64, v2 = 0.21). Sub-
group analysis resulted in no meaningful reduction of
heterogeneity: I2 values of 66 and 63% for trained and
untrained participants, respectively, compared with 66%
for
the
combined
group.
Both
trained
(p \ 0.001,
z = 4.84) and untrained populations (p = 0.007, z = 2.70)
experienced significant benefits from CG on recovery.
However, whilst the small benefits of CG were very likely
beneficial for trained participants, as demonstrated by the
95% CI failing to transect the threshold for the smallest
worthwhile effect [ES = 0.37 (95% CI 0.22, 0.51)], this
was not the case for untrained participants [ES = 0.45
(95% CI 0.12, 0.78)].

 3.4 Time-Point Analysis
When all performance measures were considered, CG-
mediated recovery was significantly influenced by time
point (p \ 0.001, v2 = 31.6). This was reflected in reduced
heterogeneity in three of the four time periods analysed,
with I2 values of 0, 0, 65 and 82% being reported for the
0–2, 2–8, 24 and [
24 h time points, respectively, com-
pared with 66% for the combined group. Whilst recovery
was significantly enhanced by CG at each time point
(Figs. 3, 4, 5), effects were trivial and unlikely beneficial at
0–2 h [p = 0.01, z = 2.52; ES = 0.14 (95% CI 0.03,
0.24)]. However, later time points were subject to signifi-

3.5 The Effects of Compression Garments (CG)
on Recovery Outcomes
The magnitude of CG-mediated recovery was significantly
different (p = 0.03, v2 = 6.94) between performance out-
comes (strength, power and endurance; Figs. 6, 7, 8).
Accordingly, I2 values were smaller in two of three sub-
groups
(strength = 64%,
power = 66%,
endur-
ance = 22%) compared with the total group (I2 = 66%).
Strength recovery was subject to the largest benefits from
CG (p \ 0.001, z = 5.30), which were moderate in mag-
nitude and very likely beneficial [ES = 0.62 (95% CI 0.39,
0.84)]. The effects of CG on strength recovery were sig-
nificantly greater than on power over all time points
(p = 0.008, v2 = 6.93). No other differences between
outcomes were apparent. Analysis of strength recovery at
different times revealed significant (p \ 0.001, z = 5.33),
large, very likely beneficial effects at 2–8 h [ES = 1.14
(95% CI 0.72, 1.56)] and [
24 h [p \ 0.001, z = 3.70,
ES = 1.03 (95% CI 0.48, 1.57)].
The effects of CG on power recovery (Fig. 7) were
significant across all time points (p = 0.008, z = 2.64),
although the small effect was not very likely to represent a
worthwhile benefit [ES = 0.23 (95% CI 0.06, 0.41)]. Sig-
nificant but not very likely benefits from CG on the
recovery of power were demonstrated only at [
24 h
[p = 0.02, z = 2.31, ES = 0.59 (95% CI 0.09, 1.10)].
The recovery of endurance performance over all time
points, following all exercise challenges (including both
running and metabolic exercise), was also significantly
improved with the use of CG (p = 0.04, z = 2.04).
Endurance recovery was subject to small but not very
likely benefits from CG [ES = 0.39 (95% CI 0.02, 0.77),
Fig. 8]. A significant (p = 0.01, z = 2.58), large and very
likely beneficial effect was apparent at 24 h [ES = 1.05
(95% CI 0.25, 1.85)], with no effects at either 0–2 or
[
24 h.
3.6 The Benefits of CG for Different Types
of Damaging Exercise
There was a significant effect of exercise modality on
the effects of CG over all time points (Figs. 9, 10, 11)
for all measures of recovery (p \ 0.001, v2 = 28.6).
Heterogeneity, as shown by the I2 statistic, was lower in
two of the three subgroups (resistance = 79%, run-
ning = 0%,
metabolic = 0%)
compared
with
the
combined data set (I2 = 66%). Recovery from resistance
exercise (Fig. 9) was subject to the greatest effects
[ES = 0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.61)], which, although small,
were very likely beneficial and significant (p \ 0.001,
z = 8.09). Analysing the resistance exercise group sep-
arately revealed large, very likely [ES = 1.14 (95% CI
0.72, 1.56)] and significant (p \ 0.001, z = 5.33) benefits
at 2–8 h, as well as at 24 h [p = 0.004, z = 2.92,
ES = 1.10 (95% CI 0.36, 1.83)] and [
24 h [p \ 0.001,
z = 4.97, ES = 1.33 (95% CI 0.80, 1.85)]. In contrast,
the
impact
of
CG
on
recovery
was
insignificant
(p = 0.23, z = 1.20), trivial and unlikely following run-
ning [ES = 0.06 (95% CI -0.04, 0.17)]. Accordingly,
the effects on CG on recovery were significantly greater
following resistance exercise compared with running
(p \ 0.001, v2 = 27.6).
The recovery of endurance or power performance fol-
lowing
metabolically
challenging
(non-load-bearing)
exercise was subject to significant (p = 0.01, z = 2.49)
benefits from CG. However, these moderate benefits were
unlikely [ES = 0.44 (95% CI 0.09, 0.79)]. When analysed
independently, the effects of CG on recovery from meta-
bolic exercise were significant only at the 24 h time point
(p = 0.01, z = 2.58). This effect was large and very likely
beneficial [ES = 1.05 (95% CI 0.25, 1.85)].
4 Discussion
This meta-analysis, which included 136 data points from
23 studies, is the first to evaluate the effects of CG in
relation to performance outcomes, exercise challenges,
training status and recovery time points. Its findings may
help inform practice by identifying the optimal conditions
under which CG may aid recovery. In summary, CG would
seem to be most effective for recovery from resistance
exercise and prior to strength performance. Large, very
likely benefits were demonstrated in these conditions, as
well as for next-day cycling performance. The benefits of
CG in relation to applied pressures and participant training
status are unclear and limited by the paucity of reported
data.

 4.1 Performance Outcomes
These data demonstrate that CG exert a preferential effect
on strength recovery. Whilst previous analyses have
reported a tendency for CG to exert greater relative effects
on power recovery [9, 64], these analyses were less
extensive. Hill et al. [21] reported a tendency towards
larger effects for power recovery compared with strength,
following the analysis of 17 power outcomes from six
studies and 16 strength outcomes from five studies (a total
of eight studies and 33 data points). Similarly, Marques-
Jimenez et al. [64] recently reported a tendency towards
comparatively greater effects on power recovery after
analysing 30 power outcomes from five studies and 45
strength outcomes from eight studies (nine studies and 75
data points in total). However, the present results from the
analysis of 136 data points demonstrate a significantly
larger effect from CG on strength compared with power,
while very likely benefits were apparent for strength out-
comes only (Figs. 6, 12). Analysing the recovery from
specific exercise challenges seems to mirror these findings,
as CG were most effective following resistance or plyo-
metric exercise (Figs. 9, 10, 13). This finding is supported
by numerous studies that demonstrate that CG serve to
attenuate symptoms of muscle damage [17, 19, 20]. Fur-
thermore, CG demonstrated large, very likely benefits on
strength recovery at [
24 h, when muscle damage and
associated force decrements are greatest [27, 28]. This
suggests that compression enhances force recovery by
ameliorating EIMD.
4.2 Compression, Muscle Damage and Strength
Recovery
Within the studies reviewed, the greatest levels of muscle
damage were observed following resistance exercise. The
greatest circulating levels of CK, for example, were
reported to reach 1350 U�L-1 following two sets of 50
bicep curls with 12 maximal eccentric contractions [19]. In
contrast, far lower [CK] values of 353 U�L-1 [58] and
305 U�L-1 [47] were elicited by repeated sprint protocols.
These findings are consistent with existing literature that
suggests that resistance exercise typically leads to greater
levels of muscle damage than running [65–67], while non-
load-bearing exercise is subject to even less eccentric load
[12]. Although running can result in comparable levels of
EIMD to resistance exercise, for example, following a
marathon [21], levels of EIMD reported throughout the
literature are generally lower than those from resistance
training [68].
The large benefits of CG on both strength recovery and
recovery from resistance exercise are concordant with a
role in ameliorating muscle damage. The results of this
meta-analysis support this theory in three main ways.
Firstly, force recovery is intimately linked to muscle
damage, being impaired to a greater extent by EIMD than

 either running [69] or power outcomes [19, 20, 70] from 24
to 48 h. Secondly, the observed time course of recovery for
both resistance exercise and strength performance lends
further weight to the idea that CG ameliorate muscle
damage. Apart from the 2–8 h time point, very likely

performance
[ES = 1.03 (95% CI 0.48, 1.57)] and following resistance
exercise [ES = 1.33 (95% CI 0.80, 1.85)] were only
apparent at [
24 h. A delayed recovery from resistance
exercise is a common feature of EIMD [27], while
impairments to strength are known to persist for longer
than impairments to power [70, 71]. Strength recovery at
time points [
24 h post-exercise will depend upon the
attenuation of EIMD [70, 71]. Finally, markers of muscle
damage, although not quantified in this meta-analysis, were
greatly attenuated by CG in studies on strength recovery
and resistance exercise. Where measured, reductions in CK
activity were reported in parallel with both improved
strength performance and DOMS [17, 19, 20], while four
studies that demonstrated significant benefits from CG also
reported lower levels of swelling compared with controls
[19, 22, 44, 49]. Interestingly, oedema has been suggested
to play a mechanistic role in the progression of muscle
damage, rather than simply representing a symptom of
EIMD. It is thought that the infiltration of fluid into muscle
cells increases osmotic pressure, leading to further cell
lysis and muscle damage [30, 32]. CG may therefore
enhance recovery by ameliorating swelling to limit the
progression of EIMD [17, 19, 20].
In contrast to the long-term benefits of compression,
some of the greatest effects of CG on strength recovery
were demonstrated at 2–8 h. All data were extracted from a
single trial, which assessed the effects of CG over 24 h
recovery from resistance training [22]. The authors repor-
ted faster recovery of upper body strength [chest-press 1
repetition maximum (RM)] over the first 8 h (p \ 0.05).
However, the mechanisms of action over these time points
were unclear as the CG and control groups displayed
similar levels of lactate, muscle damage (myoglobin and
CK), anabolic hormones (insulin like growth factor-1 and
free testosterone), and inflammation, as shown by inter-
leukin 6 and interleukin 1 [22]. It is interesting that whilst
the effects of muscle temperature on strength and power
performance are well established [72], and may explain
both detrimental [73] and ergogenic [74] effects of recov-
ery interventions, the effects of temperature as a mediating
factor on compression have yet to be defined. Other
mechanisms proposed to explain the short-term recovery
benefits of CG include proprioceptive or neuromuscular
effects [75], improved lactate clearance [18, 58, 61, 63] and
increased oxygen saturation [76].
4.3 Compression, Power Recovery, and Running
In contrast to resistance exercise, no likely recovery benefits
from CG were demonstrated following running. This finding
isin agreement withprevious research,with a recent reviewof
32 trials using CG during or after running reporting insignif-
icant effects on recovery [37]. An earlier review of 23 peer-
reviewed papers, 11 of which were studies on recovery from
running, also found insignificant effects from CG [39]. The
mechanisms by which load-bearing exercise retards recovery
are complex and varied, and include muscle damage and the
depletion of endogenous energy substrates [77], the accu-
mulation of metabolic by-products [78, 79] and impaired
neuromuscular function [80]. It is therefore unsurprising that
ameliorating muscle damage alone is often insufficient to aid
recovery from running [33, 81], as this milieu of degenerative
processes is unlikely to be wholly addressed by a single
recovery method. Generating power, too, depends on a varied
combination of physiological factors, including neuromus-
cular [70], coordinative [82] and tendon-mediated compo-
nents [83]. This will reduce the relative influence of muscle
damage and, potentially, the benefits of CG. Compression
may have also failed to provide very likely benefits on power
recovery due to the wide variation in the performance mea-
sures studied. The current analysis grouped together power
outputs for squat jumps, countermovement jumps, numerous
resistance exercises (at various loads and velocities), and
various running and ergometer-based sprint protocols. The
large number of outcomes analysed here (79 data points)
compared with previous meta-analyses (17 and 30 data points
for the analyses of Hill et al. and Marques-Jimenez et al.,
respectively) may further explain the conflict between results
[6, 33, 38, 47, 55–62]. As the recovery rates of these different
movements are unique to their neuromuscular profiles
[84, 85], any positive impacts from CG that stem purely from
attenuating muscle damage will vary according to outcome
measures.

 12, 13). As studies featuring metabolic exercise modalities
subjected participants to minimal eccentric load, muscle
damage would have been far lower in this group than for
load-bearing exercise [12]. Subsequent endurance perfor-
mance is also known to be far less affected by EIMD than
strength [69]. The trivial recovery benefits of CG for
endurance training are therefore consistent with a role in
ameliorating muscle damage.
Although large, very likely beneficial effects of CG
were apparent at 24 h following metabolic exercise or prior
to endurance performance, no recovery benefits following
endurance exercise were apparent at 0–2 h. Such a finding
is perhaps surprising given reports of CG enhancing
metabolite clearance throughout repeated sprints [63] and
immediately post-exercise [34]. It is likely that variations
in athlete training status, the duration of recovery, and the
specific demands of individual exercise challenges are
responsible
for
inconsistencies
in
short-term
effects
[86, 87]. For instance, although enhanced lactate clearance
from CG failed to improve recovery of repeated ski per-
formance over 3 9 3-min bouts in competitive endurance
athletes [63], the reported peak lactate ([La]pk) values of
2.8–3.0 mmol/L would have been unlikely to limit per-
formance. Such levels are well below the [La]pk values of
13.5 ± 0.9 mmol/L [88] and 7.28 ± 1.85 mmol/L [89]
previously reported in collegiate and elite cross-country
skiers, respectively. Conversely, CG were associated with
both improvements in post-exercise lactate and improved
recovery in the second of two 30-min cycling time trials
separated by 1 h [44]. The reported mean post-exercise

 [La]pk value of 10.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L would have been
physiologically relevant to recovery and subsequent per-
formance at 1 h. In contrast, the significant and very likely
benefits of CG at 24 h in metabolic trials cannot be
attributed to improved lactate metabolism. No benefits on
post-exercise [La]pk were reported following either of two
bouts when CG were worn throughout each of two daily
40-km time trials and the intervening 24 h [35].
As with trials of resistance exercise, positive effects of
CG on endurance have also been reported alongside
reductions in swelling [44]. A significant attenuation of
the post-exercise increase in thigh circumference was
reported alongside improved subsequent performance in
the CG group (15-min time trial), 1 h after the initial
30-min cycling bout [44]. However, no measures of leg
circumference were taken in the only trial that assessed
recovery of endurance performance at 24 h [35]. It is
therefore impossible to confirm whether CG served to
enhance next-day recovery by ameliorating swelling.
Conversely, compression-mediated reductions in post-
exercise swelling were not significant in any of the run-
ning studies, in line with the lack of CG efficacy in this
group [6, 33]. The conditions for optimal CG efficacy may
be influenced by likelihood of post-exercise swelling at a
specific time point.
4.5 Pressure
The effects of CG on recovery were not different between
trials applying garment pressures more or less than
15 mmHg (p = 0.06, v2 = 3.46). However, only 24 data
points from eight trials were identified where garment
pressures had been measured directly. The apparent trend
towards poorer recovery in the higher pressure group likely
reflects the fact that all of these studies reported endurance
measures. In comparison, data from the lower pressure
trials will have been skewed by the inclusion of studies on
resistance exercise and strength recovery, which displayed
a preferential treatment effect from CG. Although greater
pressures have been demonstrated to be more beneficial for
reducing T2 relaxation times throughout recovery [90], to
date, no evidence exists to suggest an enhanced effect on
the recovery of performance. Methodological inconsisten-
cies in measuring pressure, as well as variations between
exercise protocols, continue to obscure the effects of gar-
ment pressure on recovery [34, 39]. More research is
required to quantify the effects of CG in relation to the
pressures they apply.
4.6 Training Status
The results of this analysis would suggest that the effects of
CG are not dependent on training status. However, the
definition of training status is prone to subjective bias, not
least due to heterogeneity in the populations studied. The
participants studied by Jakeman et al. [38], for example,
exercised a minimum of three times per week and included
representatives of competitive university teams (personal
communication, John Jakeman). However, athletes were
excluded if actively involved in lower body resistance or
plyometric training, despite including athletes competing
regularly and participating in sprint training. Therefore,
this cohort could theoretically have included both high-
performance
athletes
that
routinely
sustained muscle
damage from load-bearing exercise as well as recreational
exercisers with no prior experience of running or resistance
training (for example, swimmers and cyclists). Further bias
may have resulted from the fact that all of the participants
in the untrained group belonged to just four trials of
resistance exercise [17, 19, 50, 51]. This exercise modality
was associated with the largest recovery benefits from CG.
The potential for training status to influence the efficacy of
CG is still unknown, but a case could be made for a
preferential effect in either group. As the repeated bout
effect minimises subsequent levels of DOMS and perfor-
mance decrements in trained participants [41, 91], it could
be feasible that untrained individuals stand to gain the most
from CG. However, it is also possible that this greater
degree of muscle damage could mask anything other than

 very large benefits from compression. There is a lack of
studies analysing the effects of CG in untrained partici-
pants in activities other than resistance exercise. More
trials with untrained participants are required that provide
direct measurements of garment pressures.
4.7 Limitations
The strength of the conclusions drawn from this analysis is
limited to a large degree by methodological differences
amongst the trials reviewed. Both performance outcomes
and exercise protocols were subject to heterogeneity, with
power outcomes in particular being subject to varied
mechanical, neuromuscular and technical requirements
[33, 55–58].
Meaningful interpretation of these results, as well as
assessment of the quality of included studies, was made
difficult by inconsistencies in data reporting. No trials gave
information on randomization, and whilst compression
trials are inherently prone to control issues, none reported
data on the effectiveness of blinding (Fig. 2). Whilst this
analysis focused on performance recovery, more consistent
reporting of physiological measures would also help to
clarify the mechanisms responsible. This would help
strengthen recommendations on the particular exercise
modalities and subsequent performance outcomes for
which CG are most effective. Consistent reporting of
swelling, CK and DOMS, as well as skin temperature,
lactate concentration and neuromuscular function, could
help elucidate the mechanisms responsible for specific
recovery benefits. Furthermore, the subjective and incon-
sistent nature of reporting participant characteristics among
the studies reviewed also obscured the effects of training
status.
Particular analyses were also limited by the small
numbers of eligible studies. For example, drawing valid
conclusions on the effects of pressure was not possible, as
only eight trials directly recorded compression pressures
[21, 35, 36, 53, 55, 59, 62, 63]. Finally, the large, very
likely benefits reported for strength recovery at 2–8 h fol-
lowing resistance exercise [22] and for next-day cycling
performance [35], respectively, were both based on the
results of single studies. More research on recovery in these
scenarios,
as
well
as
the
physiological
mechanisms
involved, could help confirm the optimal conditions for
compression.
5 Conclusions
Compression
would
seem
to
be
most
effective
for
improving long-term (
[
24 h) recovery from exercise that
elicits a large degree of muscle damage, such as resistance
or plyometric exercise. Regarding performance outcomes,
CG confer the largest benefits to strength from 2 to 8 h [22]
or [
24 h. A large, very likely beneficial effect also exists
for next-day cycling performance. These findings could
provide effective guidance on the use of CG to optimize
performance recovery following training or competition.
From this meta-analysis, CG would be recommended to
aid the recovery of:
•
Maximal strength at least 24 h post-exercise (for
example, in strength and power athletes undertaking
resistance training programmes).
•
Strength and power performance following resistance
training or eccentric exercise.
•
Next-day cycling performance.
Further investigation of the mechanisms involved for
recovery from specific forms of exercise is required to
provide further guidance on the effective use of CG.
