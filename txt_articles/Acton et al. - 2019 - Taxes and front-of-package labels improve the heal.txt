Abstract
Background: Sugar taxes and front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labelling systems are strategies to address diet-
related non-communicable diseases. However, there is relatively little experimental data on how these strategies
influence consumer behavior and how they may interact. This study examined the relative impact of different
sugar taxes and FOP labelling systems on beverage and snack food purchases.
Methods: A total of 3584 Canadians 13 years and older participated in an experimental marketplace study using
a 5 (FOP label condition) × 8 (tax condition) between-within group experiment. Participants received $5 and were
presented with images of 20 beverages and 20 snack foods available for purchase. Participants were randomized
to one of five FOP label conditions (no label; ‘high in’ warning; multiple traffic light; health star rating; nutrition
grade) and completed eight within-subject purchasing tasks with different taxation conditions (beverages: no tax,
20% tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), 20% tax on sugary drinks, tiered tax on SSBs, tiered tax on sugary
drinks; snack foods: no tax, 20% tax on high-sugar foods, tiered tax on high-sugar foods). Upon conclusion, one of
eight selections was randomly chosen for purchase, and participants received the product and any change.
Results: Compared to those who saw no FOP label, participants who viewed the ‘high in’ symbol purchased less
sugar (− 2.5 g), saturated fat (− 0.09 g), and calories (− 12.6 kcal) in the beverage purchasing tasks, and less sodium
(− 13.5 mg) and calories (− 8.9 kcal) in the food tasks. All taxes resulted in substantial reductions in mean
sugars (− 1.4 to − 4.7 g) and calories (− 5.3 to − 19.8 kcal) purchased, and in some cases, reductions in sodium
(− 2.5 to − 6.6 mg) and saturated fat (− 0.03 to − 0.08 g). Taxes that included 100% fruit juice (‘sugary drink’
taxes) produced greater reductions in sugars and calories than those that did not.
Conclusions: This study expands the evidence indicating the effectiveness of sugar taxation and FOP labelling strategies
in promoting healthy food and beverage choices. The results emphasize the importance of applying taxes to 100% fruit
juice to maximize policy impact, and suggest that nutrient-specific FOP ‘high in’ labels may be more effective than other
common labelling systems at reducing consumption of targeted nutrients.

 Background
Diet-related non-communicable diseases are among the
leading causes of premature death and disability world-
wide [1]. Diets high in processed foods and low in fruits,
vegetables and whole grains remain dominant in devel-
oped countries, and are supplanting more traditional diets
in lower income countries [2, 3]. Several strategies have
emerged to improve dietary intake at a population level,
including the use of fiscal measures and front-of-package
(FOP) nutrition labelling [4, 5].
Food and beverage taxes aim to increase the price of
less healthy food and beverage products. Although some
jurisdictions
have
applied
health-oriented
taxes
to
foods—such as those high in calories, sugars, sodium, or
saturated and trans fats [6]—most have focused on bev-
erages high in sugars, which are typically defined one of
two ways [7]. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are bev-
erages containing ‘added sugar’ (any sugars added during
processing or preparation [8]), such as regular soft
drinks, sports drinks, flavoured waters, and fruit drinks
[9]. In contrast, sugary drinks are defined based on the
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for ‘free
sugars’ (i.e., all added sugars, plus those naturally present
in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit juice concentrates
[7]), and therefore include all beverages under the um-
brella of SSBs, plus 100% juice products. This study pre-
sented in this manuscript compares policies that target
SSBs versus those that target the broader definition of
sugary drinks.
To date, the vast majority of beverage taxes have been
applied to SSBs. Mexico, UK, Ireland, France, South
Africa, and Chile, as well as several US cities (e.g.,
Berkeley, Philadelphia, Boulder, Seattle) have all imple-
mented SSB taxes [6, 10–17]. Evidence from experimen-
tal
studies,
observational
assessments
of
real-world
taxes, and simulation modelling suggests SSB taxes ap-
plied at a rate equivalent to at least 20% of a products’
price are likely to be an effective means of reducing
purchasing and consumption of high-sugar beverages, as
well as a strong incentive for product reformulation
[18–25]. However, given their relative novelty, the opti-
mal design of SSB taxes to reduce SSB consumption and
encourage product reformulation while also generating
revenue for investment in other health promotion efforts
remains unclear. For example, the range of beverages
subject to taxation varies considerably across jurisdic-
tions: several exclude sugar-sweetened milks, some in-
clude diet beverages, and the vast majority exclude 100%
fruit juice. Additionally, policies vary in the type of tax
(e.g., excise, sales). Excise taxes apply price increases at
the point of the manufacture, sale, or distribution of a
good, whereas sales taxes are levied at the point of pur-
chase [26]. Under the umbrella of excise taxes, the most
common in the context of SSB taxes, price increases
may be applied in a ‘specific’ format—either based on
product volume or nutrient volume—or in an ‘ad
valorem’ format, applied as a percentage of the product’s
price (e.g., 20%) [26]. Some research suggests a specific
excise tax based on beverage volume or sugars content
may be preferable to a sales tax or ad valorem excise
tax—both of which constitute a percentage price in-
crease. Specific taxes create a higher relative price in-
crease in cheaper goods, reducing the potential for
consumers to choose less costly but equally unhealthy
items [25–27]. Another emerging tax model is a tiered
tax, which is a specific tax that applies varying price in-
creases to products based on two or more predefined
levels of sugar content or product volume. The UK’s ex-
cise beverage tax uses this tiered model based on bever-
age sugar content [14], while Mexico’s SSB regulations
assign a specific excise tax, roughly equivalent to 1 cent
per ounce of beverage [10]. To the authors’ knowledge,
no experimental studies have directly compared the
effectiveness of sugary drink taxes based on product
volume (i.e., ad valorem excise) versus those based on
sugar content (i.e., tiered) on consumer purchasing and
consumption, and few have compared taxes that define
SSBs in different ways.
FOP nutrition labels are another policy measure to
promote healthy eating. FOP labelling systems seek to
provide simple, interpretive information on the front of
packaged food and beverage products to help consumers
quickly and easily evaluate their healthfulness [28]. An
increasing variety of these labelling systems are being
implemented internationally [28]. FOP labelling systems
can broadly be categorized as ‘nutrient-specific’ systems
that provide information on one or more specific nutri-
ents (e.g., Chile’s ‘high in’ nutrient warnings, UK’s traffic
light labels) or ‘summary indicator’ systems that provide
a score or rating of the overall nutrient profile of a prod-
uct (e.g., Australia and New Zealand’s Health Star
Rating, France’s five-colour Nutri-Score) [28]. Reviews of
the existing evidence suggest that FOP nutrition labels
may be an effective approach to help consumers choose
healthier products; however, there is no consensus as to
which FOP label system may be most effective [29–32].
Further, a majority of existing research has focused on
the first generation of FOP labelling systems, such as
star ratings, traffic light symbols, and guideline daily
amount labels. There is less evidence on more recent
FOP systems such as ‘high in’ warning labels and France’s
five-colour Nutri-Score system.
Canada is currently finalizing regulations for a mandatory
nutrient-specific FOP labelling system. Similar to Chile’s
system, the new policy will require all packaged foods and
beverages to display a ‘high in’ symbol if they exceed thresh-
olds for sugars, sodium, or saturated fats [33]. In addition,
health advocacy groups are increasingly calling for a

 national sugary drink tax in Canada [34, 35]. There is a
need for evidence comparing the relative effectiveness of
different taxation strategies and FOP labelling formats—as
well as how these policy measures interact when applied in
combination—to help inform the implementation of FOP
labelling and tax policies in Canada and other countries.
Additionally, it is unknown whether policies have similar
impacts on purchasing and consumption of foods com-
pared to beverages.
The current study, which utilized an experimental
marketplace, sought to test the relative impact of (1) dif-
ferent food and beverage sugar taxes, and (2) different
formats of nutrient-specific and summary indicator FOP
nutrition labels on Canadian consumers’ purchasing of
sugars, sodium, saturated fats, and calories. Purchases
were assessed using a range of beverage and snack food
products typically available at a convenience or corner
store, which provided a wide range of nutrient profiles.
The study examined five primary research questions: (1)
Does a tax on SSBs impact purchases of sugars, sodium,
saturated fats and calories differently than a tax on sugary
drinks?; (2) Does a tiered specific excise tax based on
sugar content impact purchases differently than an ad
valorem tax?; (3) Do nutrient-specific FOP nutrition labels
(e.g.,‘high in’ warnings, multiple traffic lights) impact pur-
chases differently than summary indicator FOP systems
(e.g., health star ratings, 5-colour nutrition scores)?; (4)
Do sugar taxes and FOP labels have similar impacts on
purchases when applied to foods compared to beverages?;
and (5) Do the effects of sugar taxes and FOP labelling
systems interact when applied in combination?
Methods
Study design
The study was conducted from March to May 2018. Ethical
approval was granted by the Office of Research Ethics at
the University of Waterloo (ORE #22494).
An experimental marketplace is an approach commonly
used in the field of behavioural economics and marketing
to study actual consumer behaviour, and provides the op-
portunity to manipulate price and other variables of inter-
est to assess their influence on consumers’ purchases [36,
37]. Participants are provided with a sum of money, and
presented with multiple products available for purchase. If
the participant does not spend the entire sum of money,
they are permitted to keep the remainder, along with the
product they selected. In this way, participants spend real
money and incur a financial cost for their purchases, lead-
ing to more realistic product selections [36, 37].
Study protocol
Participants and recruitment
Participants aged 13 years and older were recruited using
convenience sampling from large shopping centres in
three Canadian cities (Kitchener, Waterloo, and Toronto)
within the province of Ontario. Youth are an important
subpopulation to include in diet-related research due to
their higher consumption of nutrients of concern and dif-
fered interactions with tax and labelling policies compared
to older populations [38–41]. Research assistants were sta-
tioned at booths in high-traffic areas in the shopping cen-
tres, and approached potential participants to ask if they
were interested in participating in a study on food and bev-
erage purchasing patterns. All interested participants were
asked to provide their age prior to giving written informed
consent and beginning the study. Additional written in-
formed consent from a parent or guardian was required
for all participants under 16 years; if a parent or guardian
was not present, the shopper was not permitted to partici-
pate. Participants completed the study at the booth with
the research assistant, immediately following consent.
Purchasing tasks
The experimental purchasing tasks were delivered in the
format of a 5 (FOP label condition) × 8 (tax condition)
between-within group experiment. A visual depiction of
the purchasing task protocol is available in Additional
file 1 (Figure S1). Participants were randomly assigned
to one of five FOP label conditions. Within their assigned
label condition, participants completed eight consecutive
purchasing tasks, which each corresponded to a different
tax condition. In each of the eight purchasing tasks, par-
ticipants were shown a selection of beverage or snack
products on a large (62.5 × 50 cm) laminated print-out,
which was designed to replicate the appearance of a gro-
cery or convenience store shelf (Fig. 1). A new print-out
was shown for each purchasing task, reflecting the appro-
priate label and tax condition for that purchase. In the first
five purchases, participants selected from 20 different bev-
erage products. In the last three purchases, participants
selected from 20 different snack food products. The order
of the tax conditions was randomized within the five bev-
erage tasks and within the three food tasks. At the end of
the survey, the program randomly selected one of the
eight purchasing tasks to be the actual purchase, and the
participant received the product selected with that task.
Prior to each of the eight purchasing tasks, research
assistants emphasized the following points to each par-
ticipant: (1) they had a budget of $5.00 to purchase one
item, (2) the labels may be different from what they’ve
seen in the past, (3) the prices may have changed since
the last task, and (4) they would receive their change
from the $5.00 and the actual food or beverage product
from one of the eight purchases. Research assistants
were instructed to not engage in discussion or answer
questions about nutrition, diet, or food policies. For each
task, participants made their selection on an iPad after
viewing the large shelf image. Participants did not know

Page 3 of 15
 which purchase selection they would receive (along with
any change from the $5.00) until the end of the experi-
ment and were instructed to treat all eight tasks as real
purchases.
Upon completion of the eight purchasing tasks, each
participant was asked “In all of the previous purchasing
tasks, did you notice any nutrition labels or symbols on the
front of the food and beverage packages?”, with response
options “yes”, “no”, “don’t know”, or “refuse to answer”.
Experimental conditions
Five FOP label conditions were tested, including two
nutrient-specific labels and two summary indicator sys-
tems. The FOP label conditions were no label (control);
a high in warning system labelling foods high in sugars,
sodium or saturated fats; a multiple traffic light system
(MTL) for sugars, sodium and saturated fats; a health
star rating label; and a five-colour nutrition grade label
(Fig. 2).
The high in warning system was modelled after early
iterations of Health Canada’s proposed FOP warning
symbols for foods high in sugars, sodium and saturated
fats, with nutrient thresholds based on Health Canada’s
proposed guidelines [33]. The MTL system was loosely
based on the UK’s voluntary traffic light labelling system
[42]. To ensure comparability with the high in system,
MTL labels were displayed only for sugars, sodium and
saturated fats. Criteria for ‘high’
, ‘medium’ and ‘low’ were

 based on the UK’s regulations [42]; however, in two
cases in which the MTL was incongruent with the high
in warning labels, the MTL was adjusted to match
Health Canada high in warnings. The health star rating
label design and scoring system were modeled after
Australia and New Zealand’s Health Star Rating system
[43]. The nutrition grade system was designed based on
France’s Nutri-Score system [44]. Due to differences in
criteria and scoring algorithms across the two summary
indicator
systems,
the
nutrition
grade
scores
were
adjusted to match those of the health star rating for the
purposes of this study (i.e., 0.5 to 1 stars = ‘E’ nutrition
grade; 1.5 to 2 stars = ‘D’; 2.5 to 3 stars = ‘C’; 3.5 to 4
stars = ‘B’; 4.5 to 5 stars = ‘A’). The FOP labels were not
applied to fresh fruits or vegetables (i.e., the apple and
carrots) to align with most real-world FOP nutrition
labelling systems. See Additional file 1: Table S1 for
details on the FOP labels assigned to all food and bever-
age products.
Five beverage-based sugar tax conditions (Table 1)
were tested: no tax (control), a 20% ad valorem tax on
SSBs (20% SSB), a 20% ad valorem tax on sugary drinks
(20% SD), a tiered specific tax on SSBs (tiered SSB), and
a tiered specific tax on sugary drinks (tiered SD). Bever-
ages were categorized as SSBs if they contained added
sugar, as previously defined [8]. Beverages were catego-
rized as sugary drinks if they contained free sugar, as
defined by WHO [7]. 20% SSB and 20% SD taxes were
applied to beverages containing more than 5 g of added
or free sugars (respectively) per 100 ml. Tiered SSB and
tiered SD taxes applied a 10% price increase to beverages
containing 5 to 8 g, or a 20% price increase to beverages
containing more than 8 g of added or free sugars per
100 ml (modelled after the SSB tax implemented in the
UK [45]). The study also tested three food-based sugar
tax conditions: no tax (control), a 20% ad valorem tax
on high-sugar foods (20%), and a tiered specific tax on
high-sugar
foods
(tiered).
Here,
the
20%
tax

 assigned to all foods containing more than 10 g of total
sugars per 100 g; the tiered tax applied a 10% price in-
crease to foods containing more than 10 to 20 g of total
sugars per 100 g, and a 20% price increase to foods con-
taining more than 20 g of total sugars per 100 g. The
SSB and SD tax formats were not applicable to the snack
food purchases. Additional file 1 provides details on how
the taxes were assigned to each product (Table S2), as
well as nutrition information of all products (Table S3).
Sociodemographic measures
Following the purchasing tasks and using the iPad, par-
ticipants provided information on their previous 7-day
sugary drink consumption using a brief single-item bev-
erage frequency measure (“During the past 7 days, how
many sugary drinks did you have?”) [46]. Participants
also reported their age, sex, ethnicity, education, income
adequacy (“Thinking about your total monthly income,
how difficult or easy is it for you to make ends meet?”),
and height and weight. Self-reported height and weight
were used to calculated body mass index (BMI), which
was categorized into “underweight”, “normal weight”,
“overweight” and “obese” using the WHO thresholds
[47]. BMIs for participants 19 years of age or younger
were calculated using growth charts as recommended by
CDC and WHO guidelines [48, 49]. All survey items
were completed after the experiment to minimize influ-
ence on participants’ behaviours in the purchasing tasks.
Remuneration
After participants had completed all survey items, the
survey program randomly selected one of their eight
purchasing tasks. Research assistants gave participants
their actual food or beverage product and their change
from the $5.00 corresponding to that purchase.
Outcome variables
Four primary outcomes were explored: grams of sugars
purchased, milligrams of sodium purchased, grams of
saturated fats purchased, and number of calories pur-
chased per task. All four outcomes were measured based
on the total amount of sugars, sodium, saturated fats, or
calories in the entire package of the product selected in
each purchasing task; all products were single-serving
sized and expected to be consumed in one sitting. All
four nutrient outcomes were assessed for both foods and
beverages. Although sugars and calories were the princi-
pal nutrients of concern for the beverages, several pre-
sented
beverages
contained
substantial
amounts
of
sodium (i.e., sports drinks) and saturated fat (i.e., milks).
The impacts of the sugar-based taxes on purchasing
were explored for all four nutrient outcomes (including
sodium and saturated fats) so as to capture any potential
‘spillover’ effects of sugar-based taxes [50]. Secondary
outcomes included potential interaction effects between
FOP labelling and taxes, as well as participants’ reported
noticing of the FOP nutrition labels.
Analyses
Chi square tests (for categorical variables) and one-way
ANOVAs (for linear variables) were used to test for
sociodemographic
differences
between
experimental
conditions
(FOP
label
format).
Separate
two-tailed
repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to investigate
the effects of labelling and tax on the amount of sugars,
sodium, saturated fats, and calories purchased; foods
and beverage purchases were analysed separately, result-
ing in a total of eight ANOVAs. Repeated-measures
ANOVAs were used to account for the repeated nature
of the purchasing tasks. All ANOVAs included a tax
condition × label condition interaction. In the case that
an ANOVA violated the assumption of sphericity [51],
Greenhouse-Geisser corrections [52] were applied to the
results. All statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSS software (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY;
2017). The significance threshold was set at 0.05 for all
tests. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were ap-
plied. It has been suggested that experiments based on
distinct, conceptually sound a priori hypotheses and which
have discrete, separate experimental arms should not
apply adjustments for multiple comparisons [53–55]. Re-
sults should be interpreted by the strength and magnitude
of the effect sizes, p-values, and confidence intervals.
Results
Sample characteristics are presented in Table 2. A total
of 3702 participants (96.7% of those who consented)
completed the study; 118 participants were removed due
to data quality concerns reported by the research assis-
tants (e.g., significant cognitive difficulties or distraction,
visual impairment, substantial influence from peers),
resulting in a final sample size of 3584. Participants
spent an average of 17.3 min to complete the purchasing
tasks and subsequent survey items.
There were no significant differences in sociodemo-
graphic measures across the between-group (FOP label
format) experimental conditions (Table 2).
Label noticing
Among participants who were assigned to view products
with a FOP label, 51.5% reported noticing any nutrition
labels or symbols on the food and beverage packages.
Table 3 presents the proportion of participants who re-
ported noticing nutrition labels or symbols across each
label condition.

 Beverage purchasing tasks
Mean amounts of sugars, sodium, saturated fats and
calories purchased in the beverage tasks are presented in
Fig. 3. Repeated-measures ANOVA results are presented
in Table 4, including pairwise comparisons between all
tax and labelling conditions. There were no significant
two-way interactions between tax and labelling condi-
tion for any of the four outcomes in the beverage tasks.
Taxes
Participants purchased fewer grams of sugars and calo-
ries in all tax conditions (20% SSB, 20% SD, tiered SSB,
tiered SD) compared to the no tax control condition
(Table 4). The 20% SD tax condition resulted in less
sugars and calories purchased compared to the 20% SSB
and tiered SSB conditions. Participants purchased fewer
calories in the tiered SD condition compared to the 20%
SSB and tiered SSB taxes.
For the 20% SSB, 20% SD, and tiered SSB tax condi-
tions, participants’ beverage purchase selections con-
tained less sodium compared to the no tax control
condition. The 20% SSB tax resulted in less sodium pur-
chased in comparison to the 20% SD, tiered SSB, and
tiered SD tax conditions. The 20% SD and tiered SSB
conditions resulted in less sodium purchased compared
to the tiered SD condition.
Participants purchased fewer grams of saturated fats in
the 20% SSB and tiered SSB tax conditions compared to
the no tax control condition. The 20% SSB tax condition
also resulted in fewer grams of saturated fats purchased
compared to the 20% SD condition. Participants pur-
chased fewer grams of saturated fats in the tiered SSB
condition compared to the 20% SD and tiered SD taxes.
FOP labelling
Participants assigned to the high in label condition pur-
chased beverages containing less sugars, saturated fats,
and calories compared to the no label control condition
(Table 4). There were no significant differences in
amount of sodium purchased between any of the label-
ling conditions in the beverage purchasing tasks.
Food purchasing tasks
Mean grams of sugars, sodium, saturated fats, and calo-
ries purchased in the food purchasing tasks are pre-
sented in Fig. 4. Repeated-measures ANOVA results for
the food tasks are presented in Table 4. There were no
significant two-way interactions between tax and label-
ling condition for any of the four outcomes in the food
tasks.
Taxes
Participants selected snack foods with less sugars, satu-
rated fats, and calories in both the 20% and tiered condi-
tions compared to the no tax control. The tiered food
tax resulted in a higher amount of sodium purchased in
comparison to the control condition.
FOP labelling
There were no significant differences in the amount of
sugars or saturated fats in the snack food purchase selec-
tions between any of the FOP labelling conditions. Par-
ticipants assigned to the high in and MTL conditions

 purchased less sodium and fewer calories compared to
the no label control condition, as did those assigned to
the MTL compared to the nutrition grade. Participants
who viewed the health star rating also purchased fewer
calories than those in the no label control condition.
Discussion
The findings suggest that sugar-based taxes and FOP
nutrition labels can influence purchasing behaviour for
beverage and snack purchases. As expected, the sugar-
based taxes had the greatest impact on amounts of
sugars and calories purchased. Within the beverage pur-
chasing tasks, participants purchased products with up
to 19% less sugars (− 4.7 g) and up to 18% fewer calories
(− 19.8 kcal) compared to no tax. There were also sub-
stantial reductions in the foods purchased: sugar levels
were 14 to 15% lower (− 1.4 to − 1.5 g) and calories were
3 to 4% lower (− 5.3 to − 6.7 g) under the tax conditions
versus no tax. Although all tax formats for both bever-
ages and foods affected the amounts of sugars and calo-
ries purchased, reductions were greatest when the tax
was applied to 100% juice products in the ‘sugary drinks’

 conditions as opposed to only sugar-sweetened bever-
ages. Modelling studies suggest that including 100%
juice in sugary drink taxes substantially increases the
population-level health and economic impact of sugary
taxes, mainly because fruit juice is one of the most fre-
quently consumed sugary drinks in Canada and other
Western countries [34, 56].
Although the taxes tested were based on sugar con-
tent, they also resulted in reductions in sodium and
saturated fats purchased. For beverages, reductions in
both sodium and saturated fats were as large as 9%
(− 6.6 mg sodium; − 0.04 g saturated fat), and were
driven mainly by switching away from sports drink
and milk products, respectively. Similar reductions in
saturated fat were observed among food purchases.
As is the case in the broader food supply, the high-sugar
foods presented in this study were often high in sodium
and saturated fats as well [57], leading to ‘spillover’ effects
of sugar taxes. However, participants purchased foods
higher in sodium under the tax vs. no-tax conditions.
These results suggest potential trade-off effects for snack
foods: in order to avoid more expensive sugary foods, par-
ticipants may have been more likely to switch to alterna-
tive snacks containing more sodium. To our knowledge,
very little research has examined the compensatory effects
of sugar taxes on purchases of other nutrients of concern
such as sodium or saturated fats. Given an increasing
focus on overall dietary patterns rather than isolated nutri-
ents or foods [58], research with this expanded focus is an
important contribution to the literature. The potential
‘spillover’ or compensatory effects of sugar taxes—whether
positive or negative—should be key considerations for pol-
icymakers implementing sugar-based taxes.
Few differences were observed among taxes assigned
based on product price (20% ad valorem tax conditions)
and those assigned based on sugars content (tiered spe-
cific tax conditions). Although these tax structures may
have similar impacts on consumer behaviour, they may
have a different impact on industry behaviour, in terms
of product reformulation. A tiered specific tax—based
on either product volume or sugar content—may be
more effective than a single-level ad valorem tax in mo-
tivating manufacturers to reduce sugar content, since
tiered taxes offer intermediate sugar thresholds that may
be easier to achieve [25]. Reports from the UK suggest
that their tiered SSB tax has incentivized manufacturers
to produce lower-sugar product formulations in efforts
to avoid the levy [59]. Further research assessing the
more novel tiered tax formats would be beneficial for
policymakers considering a tax strategy.
For the FOP labels, the nutrient-specific high in warn-
ing performed most consistently in terms of reducing
amounts of energy and the nutrients of interest. Partici-
pants in the high in condition purchased beverages with
11% less sugar (− 2.5 g), 18% less saturated fat (− 0.1 g),
and 12% fewer calories (− 12.6 kcal) compared to the
control condition. Similarly, in the food purchasing
tasks, the high in warning produced an 8% reduction
in sodium (− 13.5 mg) and a 5% reduction in calories
(− 8.9 kcal) purchased. Although these reductions may
appear modest at an individual level, they may translate to
substantial reductions at a population level. The MTL and
health star rating formats produced less consistent reduc-
tions in sodium and calories, while the nutrition grade—
modelled after France’s Nutri-Score system—had minimal
effects, resulting in similar outcomes to the control condi-
tion in all cases. Given the focus in this study on
nutrient-specific outcomes, it is perhaps not surprising
that the nutrient-specific FOP formats produced the great-
est reductions in the targeted nutrients. It is also notable
that ‘high in’ labels were most likely to be noticed com-
pared to the other FOP labels, which highlights the im-
portance of the general design and ‘salience’ of labels to
engage consumers’ attention [60]. These results reflect
similar findings from a range of experimental studies in-
vestigating nutrient-specific FOP warnings [61–66]. The
poor performance of the five-colour nutrition grade in this
study is in contrast to more promising results from France
on the Nutri-Score system [67]; however, these differences
may be due to the focus of the current study’s outcomes
on specific nutrients of concern rather than overall nutri-
tional quality. The findings may also indicate that the
Nutri-Score system may require more public education
than more intuitive symbols such as the high in labels. Fu-
ture research should compare the impacts of different
FOP formats on purchasing of both targeted nutrients
and broader outcomes related to overall diet quality and
implications for health.
No interaction effects were observed between the tax
and FOP labelling conditions. However, the findings
demonstrate that taxation and FOP labels have inde-
pendent effects, which remained in the presence of the
other policy. In other words, FOP labels had an effect
above and beyond the effects of taxation, and vice versa.
The cumulative effects of the tax and label interventions
were considerable, suggesting greater public health bene-
fit when both policies are implemented.
Several limitations should be noted. First, the study
did not use a systematic sampling method, limiting
generalizability to the larger Canadian population. How-
ever, the sample provided a large age range and good
variability across sociodemographic characteristics, with
notable similarities to the Canadian population in the
proportion of participants identifying as Indigenous [68].
This study used an experimental marketplace design to
replicate authentic purchasing behaviours as closely as
possible; however, it may not represent how consumers
interact with price and labels in real world settings, in
Acton et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity           (2019) 16:46 
Page 12 of 15
 which other influences (e.g., family members’ or peers’
preferences) may come in to play. Additionally, partici-
pants did not make purchases with their own money,
which may have lead to more carefree spending. Both
policy measures tested in this study were presented to
participants without an associated description or explan-
ation. Only about half of the participants reported no-
ticing the FOP labels when they were present, which is
substantially lower than rates of consumer awareness in
countries with existing mandatory FOP labelling systems
[69–71]. Notably, over a quarter of the participants ran-
domized to the control condition (who were shown no
FOP labels) reported seeing ‘nutrition labels or symbols’
,
suggesting that even fewer of the other participants may
have actually noticed the FOP labels of interest, even if
they reported so. Therefore, effect sizes may be greater
under real world conditions, in which consumers are
more likely to be aware of a FOP labelling system.
Strengths of the study include the use of a randomized
between-within experimental design, and behavioural
outcomes with ‘real’ monetary consequences. Indeed,
few studies to date have combined the high internal val-
idity provided by an experimental design with actual
purchase tasks.
Conclusions
The study findings provide empirical support for the
effectiveness of sugar taxes and FOP nutrition labels to
help reduce consumption of sugars, sodium, saturated
fats, and calories. Results suggest that including 100%
fruit juice in the scope of taxed beverages leads to
greater reductions in sugar consumption, and that sugar
taxes may help to reduce consumption of sodium and
saturated fats in addition to sugars and calories. Among
FOP label designs, nutrient-specific FOP ‘high in’ warn-
ings produced the most consistent reductions in nutri-
ents of concern, reinforcing the approach taken in Chile
and regulatory proposals in Canada and Brazil. Further
‘post-implementation’ research is required to understand
how such interventions, on their own and in combin-
ation, affect overall diet quality at the population level.
