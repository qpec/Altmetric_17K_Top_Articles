Women vaccinated against HPV16/18 are approaching the age for cervical screening; however, an updated screening algo-
rithm has not been agreed. We use a microsimulation model calibrated to real published data to determine the appropriate
screening intensity for vaccinated women. Natural histories in the absence of vaccination were simulated for 300,000 women
using 10,000 sets of transition probabilities. Vaccination with (i) 100% efficacy against HPV16/18, (ii) 15% cross-protection,
(iii) 22% cross-protection, (iv) waning vaccine efficacy and (v) 100% efficacy against HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 was added,
as were a range of screening scenarios appropriate to the UK. To benchmark cost-benefits of screening for vaccinated women,
we evaluated the proportion of cancers prevented per additional screen (incremental benefit) of current cytology and likely
HPV screening scenarios in unvaccinated women. Slightly more cancers are prevented through vaccination with no screening
(70.3%, 95% CR: 65.1–75.5) than realistic compliance to the current UK screening programme in the absence of vaccination
(64.3%, 95% CR: 61.3–66.8). In unvaccinated women, when switching to HPV primary testing, there is no loss in effectiveness
when doubling the screening interval. Benchmarking supports screening scenarios with incremental benefits of �2.0%, and
rejects scenarios with incremental benefits �0.9%. In HPV16/18-vaccinated women, the incremental benefit of offering a third
lifetime screen was at most 3.3% (95% CR: 2.2–4.5), with an incremental benefit of 1.3% (20.3–2.8) for a fourth screen. For
HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58-vaccinated women, two lifetime screens are supported. It is important to know women’s vaccina-
tion status; in these simulations, HPV16/18-vaccinated women require three lifetime screens, HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58-vac-
cinated women require two lifetime screens, yet unvaccinated women require seven lifetime screens.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the develop-
ment of cervical cancer, with HPV types 16 and 18 known
to be particularly high risk.1 There are two public health
interventions to prevent cervical cancer: cervical screening
and HPV vaccination. Cervical screening aims to identify
and treat precancerous changes to the cervix, preventing
cervical cancer developing. Current screening guidelines in
England are for 3-yearly cytology screening with HPV triage
for women aged 25–49 and 5-yearly for ages 50–64. HPV
triage is carried out on cytology results which are borderline
or mild (using the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervi-
cal
Pathology
terminology).
In
January
2016
the
UK
National Screening Committee announced their intention to
introduce primary HPV testing. Randomised controlled tri-
als show this is more effective in preventing cervical can-
cer.2 It is more sensitive than cytology for detecting high-
grade CIN, though less specific,3 and several countries
are in the process of switching to primary HPV testing,
with primary HPV testing introduced in the Netherlands in
January 2017.
HPV vaccination of teenage girls became widespread in
2007–2009. In England, the HPV vaccine was introduced in
2008 for girls aged 12–13. In 2015, a nonavalent vaccine was
approved for use in Europe, additionally protecting against
HPV types 31/33/45/52/58; together with HPV types 16/18,
they are responsible for approximately 90% of cervical can-
cers. The difference in screening offered may differ following
vaccination with the bivalent (HPV types 16/18, responsible
for approximately 70% of cervical cancers) or quadrivalent
(HPV types 6/11/16/18, responsible for approximately 70% of
cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts) and the nonavalent
vaccines; this difference should be taken into account when
estimating cost-effectiveness.

 Women vaccinated through the catch-up programme
(vaccinated aged 13–18 in 2009) first entered the screening
programme in England in September 2016. Following the
same screening intervals as unvaccinated women, as currently
recommend in the U.S.,4 is unlikely to be a good use of
resources. However, an updated algorithm has not yet been
settled on. We do not directly address screening intensity in
women vaccinated as part of the catch-up cohort, as we con-
sider women vaccinated at age 12, with the assumption that
this is prior to HPV exposure; however the first full cohorts
vaccinated against HPV16/18 approaching the recommended
age for screening to begin, updated screening interval recom-
mendations are required soon. If the screening programme
continues to start at age 25, women vaccinated at age 12 will
enter the screening programme from 2021.
Simulation models are increasingly used to inform health
policy decisions, where information about long-term out-
comes will not be available for many years.5 Typically, mod-
els are calibrated to a particular population and thus provide
simulation results specific to that population. Here, we
instead investigate outcomes shown to be robust under
diverse model calibrations and study their values and varia-
tion when model parameters are picked randomly from a
realistic distribution. Thus our results should be applicable to
a wide variety of populations.
Materials and Methods
Natural history model
We developed a simple model of cervical cancer natural his-
tory where transitions between disease states are made at
half-yearly intervals, from ages 12 to 80. Initially everyone is
assumed to be HPV-negative, and we do not allow for hys-
terectomies or deaths prior to age 80. The states and possible
transitions are shown in Figure 1; “asymptomatic” refers to
cancers
only
diagnosed
as
a
result
of
screening,
and
“symptomatic” cancers are diagnosed without (or despite)
screening. If an asymptomatic cancer is not detected through
screening, it may progress to become symptomatic, according
to the transition probabilities, or remain asymptomatic until
age 80. In line with scientific evidence,6,7 we assume cervical
cancer cannot occur without HPV infection.
The transition probabilities are HPV-type and age depen-
dent. For simplicity, we consider two groups of HPV types:
16/18 and all other (non-16/18) high-risk types. As the tran-
sition probabilities are subject to uncertainty, 10,000 sets of
normally distributed parameters were sampled independently,
with means and standard deviations chosen to reflect the
uncertainty reported in the literature (Fig. 1). We rejected
parameter sets for which the simulation results were inconsis-
tent with the literature (Table 1). This rejection may be con-
sidered to be a minimal version of calibration. Rather than
calibrating to a particular population, we calibrate so the
model is similar to a real population. To demonstrate the
variability due to the simulations rather than the choice of
parameters, we also simulate 1,000 cohorts using fixed
parameters (i.e., setting the standard deviation to 0). Each
cohort consists of 300,000 simulated natural histories, the
approximate number of girls aged 12 in England.8 Confi-
dence intervals were based on empirical limits from the
10,000 cohorts with randomly selected parameters.
We did not consider new HPV infections beyond age 65;
they are assumed to be rare, and, due to the slow development
of cervical cancer, are unlikely to result in cancer. We cali-
brated age-specific HPV prevalence to the published age-
specific HPV prevalence data from the ARTISTIC trial in
England (Fig. 2) using an iterative process to estimate the tran-
sition probabilities,9 with estimates in the literature as a start-
ing point.10 We ensured an appropriate proportion of cancers
were caused by HPV16/18,11 and the range of lifetime risks of
cervical cancer in the absence of screening was realistic.12
The model was run independently for HPV16/18 and
non-16/18 high-risk HPV types. The results were combined
by taking the more advanced state at each time point (e.g.,
low-grade CIN is more advanced than HPV infection). We
assumed that 10% of the population were high risk – i.e.,
they had a higher risk of becoming infected with both HPV-
16/18 and non-16/18 high-risk HPV types; this was modeled
by increasing the ‘susceptible’ to ‘HPV infection’ transition
probability reported in Figure 1 by 20% for these individuals.
Vaccination
In addition to the natural history in the absence of HPV vac-
cination, five scenarios exploring vaccine efficacy were con-
sidered. In all scenarios, 100% vaccination coverage was
assumed to occur at age 12, as we are interested in screening
algorithms for women known to have been vaccinated.
What’s new?
In England, the first cohorts of teenage girls to be vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) will soon be entering the
country’s cervical cancer screening program. However, appropriate screening intervals for vaccinated women are yet to be
established. Here, the necessary number of lifetime screens for HPV16/18-vaccinated women and HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/
58-vaccinated women was determined using the proportion of cancers prevented per screen benchmarked against current
screening practice. The findings suggest that three lifetime screens would be sufficient for cervical cancer prevention in
HPV16/18-vaccinated women, while just two lifetime screens would be effective for HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58-vaccinated
women.

infections,

ated with cervical cancer is achieved.
2. The quadrivalent vaccine provides some cross-protection, pre-
venting 14.7% of non-16/18 high-risk HPV infections associ-
ated with cervical cancer, in addition to 100% of HPV16/18
infections. The protection does not wane with time.
3. The bivalent vaccine provides some cross-protection, pre-
venting 22.1% of non-16/18 high-risk HPV infections asso-
ciated with cervical cancer, in addition to 100% of HPV16/
18 infections. The protection does not wane with time.
4. The vaccine prevents 100% of HPV16/18 infections at vac-
cination (age 12), but the effectiveness drops by 0.25%
(absolute) per six months since vaccination, making the
vaccine less effective, so by age 27, the protection is 92.5%
for HPV16/18. There is no cross-protection.

 5. The nonavalent vaccine: 63.6% of non-16/18 high-risk
HPV infections associated with cervical cancer are pre-
vented,14 in addition to 100% of HPV16/18 infections. The
protection does not wane with time.
The level of cross-protection for the quadrivalent and biva-
lent vaccines (II and III above) were estimated from a weighted
average of the level of protection against 6-month type-specific
HPV persistence in trials of the quadrivalent15 and bivalent16
vaccine, weighted by HPV type prevalence in cancers not
caused by HPV16/181; see Supporting Information. Waning
vaccine effectiveness was based on 95.6% effectiveness after 9.4
years against incident infection.17 The vaccines only affect the
transition between susceptible and HPV positive.
Screening and treatment
Various screening programmes were applied to the simulated
natural history datasets. We considered both 100% compli-
ance with screening, to generate the optimal recommenda-
tions for women who adhere to screening recommendations,
and a more realistic scenario, based on cervical screening
attendance in England (Supporting Information), to provide
population-level recommendations. The screening scenarios
considered are given in Table 2.
All screening scenarios assume HPV primary testing with
partial genotyping for HPV16/18 (to allow differential follow-
up) with cytology triage. For details of the assumptions
regarding test sensitivity, see Supporting Information. We
additionally consider two screening scenarios (A0, B0) under
the current screening programme, using cytology with HPV
triage. These scenarios mirror screening scenarios A and B in
Table 2, but use cytology as the primary test, with HPV tri-
age of low-grade cytological abnormalities. Cancer is diag-
nosed
when
transition
occurs
from
asymptomatic
to
symptomatic cancer (i.e., assuming no delay in symptom rec-
ognition), or through screening. Therefore, in the absence of
screening only symptomatic cancers are diagnosed.
Statistical methods
We report the mean number of screens, including recall tests
following a positive HPV test and negative cytology test, but
excluding tests taken during surveillance following treatment.
We compare the number of cancers that would be diagnosed
under the vaccination/screening scenarios to the number of
symptomatic cancers in the absence of screening or vaccina-
tion (asymptomatic cancers would not be diagnosed in the
absence of screening), and from these numbers calculate the
proportion of cancers that would be prevented by that com-
bination of vaccination and screening. Rather than using tra-
ditional measures of cost-effectiveness, we calculate the
incremental benefit of each additional screen as the difference
in the proportion of cancers prevented with a given number
of screens to the proportion of cancers prevented using one
fewer screen (when multiple scenarios with the same number
of lifetime screens are considered, we use the scenario which
prevents the highest proportion of cancers), and dividing this
by the difference in number of lifetime screens between the
two scenarios (which will be close to but not exactly 1, due
to differences in the number of follow-up tests between sce-
narios). For example, if scenario A prevents 85% of cervical
cancers using 3.15 lifetime screens, and scenario B prevents
89% using 4.20 lifetime screens, the incremental benefit per
additional screen is (89 2 85)/(4.20 2 3.15), 3.8%. The
incremental benefit of the current screening practice (12 life-
time screens) is taken to be the benefit of each additional
screen compared to 6- and 10-yearly screening (7 lifetime
screens). We use 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles to provide

 empirical 95% central ranges (95% CR) for the percentage of
cancers prevented and incremental benefit.
We calculated a benchmark for what level of incremental
benefit would be required for a more intensive screening pro-
gramme to be accepted by calculating the incremental benefit
of 3(5)-yearly HPV testing compared to 6(10)-yearly HPV
testing, and 3(5)-yearly cytology testing compared to 6(10)-
yearly cytology testing, each with realistic screening coverage.
Incremental benefits greater than that achieved by 3(5)-yearly
cytology are assumed to be worthwhile. Incremental benefits
less than that achieved by 3(5)-yearly HPV testing are
assumed not to be acceptable. We do not attempt to identify
an exact threshold.
The simulation model was coded in C11, and the data
analysis was carried out in Stata v13.1.
Results
The main results use 10,000 parameter sets; full results for all
vaccination/screening scenarios considered are presented in
Supporting Information, Tables S1–S4. In the absence of
screening, with no vaccination, the cumulative risk of cervical
cancer to age 80 was 2.19% (95% CR: 1.67–2.69). The vaccine
which protected against 100% of HPV16/18 with no waning
prevented 70.3% of cervical cancers (95% CR: 65.1–75.5), the
quadrivalent vaccine with cross protection prevented 74.0%
(95% CR: 69.5–78.6), the bivalent vaccine with cross protec-
tion prevented 76.4% (95% CR: 72.2–80.6), the vaccine with
waning efficacy prevented 65.8% of cancers (95% CR: 60.8–
70.8) and the nonavalent vaccine prevented 88.4% (95% CR:
86.1–90.5).
In the absence of vaccination, the incremental benefit (per
screen) of 3(5)-yearly screening with cytology compared with
6(10)-yearly screening was 2.0% of cervical cancers that
would occur in the absence of any vaccination or screening
(95% CR: 1.2–2.8), assuming realistic screening coverage. The
corresponding incremental benefit for 3(5)-yearly HPV test-
ing in the absence of vaccination compared to 6(10)-yearly
screening with realistic screening coverage was 0.9% (95%
CR: 0.3–1.7). We use these as a range of benchmarks for
screening in vaccinated women, rejecting incremental benefits
�0.9% and accepting incremental benefits �2.0% of cancers
prevented per additional screen.
With realistic HPV primary screening coverage, in the
absence of vaccination, the incremental benefit per screen of
having 6- and 10-yearly screening compared with 4 lifetime
screens would be a 3.0% (95% CR: 2.2–3.8) reduction in cer-
vical cancers per additional screen (Table 3). With full
screening coverage, the benefits per additional screen are very
similar.
The proportion of cancers prevented is slightly higher for
women vaccinated against HPV16/18 (scenario I) but not
screened (70.3% (95% CR: 65.1–75.5)) and 3(5)-yearly cytol-
ogy screened unvaccinated women with realistic screening
coverage (64.3% (95% CR: 61.3–66.8)).
We next consider the vaccine with 100% protection
against HPV16/18 with neither waning nor cross-protection,
with realistic HPV primary screening compliance at different
screening intervals (Table 4). In the scenario of two lifetime
screens, the incremental benefit per screen in vaccinated
women was the prevention of an additional 3.9% (95% CR:
2.6–5.2) of cancers compared to the scenario with one life-
time screen (Table 4). With three lifetime screens, depending
on the ages at which they occurred, the incremental benefit
of the third screen was around 2% (Table 4). There was no
benefit compared with two lifetime screens at ages 30 and 45
when the screening ages considered were 25, 45 and 65; how-
ever, screens at ages 30, 40 and 55 prevented an additional
2.8% (95% CR: 1.7–3.9) of cancers compared with screening
at 30 and 45 only. Compared to the scenario with three life-
time screens (at the best of the ages considered here – ages
30, 40 and 55), having a fourth lifetime screen (at ages 30,
40, 50 and 65) prevented only 1.0% (95% CR: 20.3–2.5) of
cancers per additional screen. The incremental benefit of fur-
ther screens beyond four was below 1%. These results were
very similar for the other 16/18 vaccine scenarios considered,
with slightly smaller benefits of screening when cross protec-
tion was assumed, and slightly larger benefits when the vac-
cine efficacy was allowed to wane (Table 4). With full
screening coverage, the benefits per additional screen are very
similar, with an incremental benefit of 2.7% (95% CR: 1.9–
3.5) per additional lifetime screen with screening invitations
at ages 30, 40 and 55 compared to two screening invites per
lifetime at ages 30 and 45, and an incremental benefit of
1.0% (95% CR: 0.4–1.6) per additional screen for four

 lifetime invites at ages 30, 40, 50 and 65 compared to three
at ages 30, 40 and 55.
When considering the nonavalent vaccine, with 100%
screening coverage the incremental benefit with three lifetime
screens was 1.0% (95% CR: 0.6–1.5) per additional lifetime
screen, 1.6% (95% CR: 1.0–2.1) per additional lifetime screen
for two lifetime screens, and 5.8% (95% CR: 4.6–7.1) for one
lifetime screen compared to no screening. The results were
similar with realistic screening coverage. When the analyses
were restricted to simulated natural history datasets which
produced the highest 2.5% of cumulative risks of cervical
cancer up to age 80 (cumulative risk up to age 80 in the
absence of vaccination or screening �2.7%) and lowest 2.5%
of cumulative risks up to age 80 (cumulative risk up to age
80 �1.7%), very similar results were found (Supporting
Information, Tables S5 and S6).
The results using fixed natural history transition parame-
ters produced very similar point estimates and narrower cen-
tral ranges for the proportion of cancers prevented and
incremental benefit of each additional screen for each vaccine
and screening combination, for both full screening coverage
and realistic screening coverage (Supporting Information,
Tables S3 and S4).
Discussion
The natural history of cervical cancer is relatively well under-
stood, which makes modelling an attractive option to esti-
mate the impact of changes to screening programmes prior
to implementation. We carried out a simulation study to
consider the impact of a variety of screening algorithms on
the incidence of cervical cancer in unvaccinated women and
under four scenarios with varying vaccination efficacy. We
consider vaccinated and unvaccinated women separately, as
the population will contain a mix of these women, and the
appropriate intensity of cervical screening differs between
these groups. Our results confirm that even in unvaccinated
women, screening intervals can be safely lengthened with the
introduction of HPV testing with cytology triage, compared
to cytology testing. We benchmarked the incremental benefits
of cytology and HPV screening in unvaccinated women to
establish boundaries for which screening scenarios to support
based on their incremental benefits. In women vaccinated
with a 16/18-vaccine, there was substantial (>2%) incremen-
tal benefit of offering three rather than two lifetime screens,
whereas the incremental benefit beyond three was limited
(0.8–1.3%). These results were consistent for the wide range
of transition probabilities and three 16/18-vaccine scenarios
considered. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vac-
cine, the incremental benefit beyond two invites was minimal
(�1.1%) and the incremental benefit of two screens over one
was small (1.0–1.6%).
By considering realistic screening coverage and perfect
screening compliance, and ensuring the natural history model
reflects observed HPV prevalence (e.g., in England), we aim
to
ground
the
analyses
in
real
world
settings,
as
recommended by Kim et al.5 We have considered a variety of
vaccination scenarios, including a nonavalent vaccine, which
is produced by the same company as the quadrivalent vac-
cine, and is therefore likely to replace the quadrivalent vac-
cine in the coming years.
As with all simulations, the underlying model is based on
numerous assumptions. Natural history models for cervical
cancer are well studied; however, advanced precancerous dis-
ease is usually treated; therefore there is little evidence on
which to base transition probabilities from high-grade CIN
or asymptomatic cancer, and the evidence that does exist
mainly comes from one study18 in which treatment of CIN3
was withheld in 1965–1974. Lesions that are currently con-
sidered CIN3 may differ to a lesion labelled CIN3 50 years
ago, and progression rates may vary by age; additionally pre-
vious research has shown that progression from CIN3 to can-
cer in young women cannot occur at the rate suggested by
this study.19 However, similar conclusions were obtained
when the natural history transition probabilities were drawn
from distributions reflecting their uncertainty. Our natural
history model is relatively simple, excluding hysterectomy
and death prior to age 80, though as our outcome is the pro-
portion of cancers prevented, these exclusions cancel out as
they are applied to both the numerator and denominator,
and should therefore not have a large impact on the results.
Additionally, our model is fast to simulate (around 86 sec
per simulation, including all 6 vaccine scenarios and 13
screening scenarios, when run on a Linux IBM System X
iDataPlex dx360 M3 Server node using a Core Intel Xeon
E5645 (Westmere) processor), features far fewer parameters
than a more complicated model and is calibrated to observed
data in England. Additionally, by selecting parameter values
at random from a multivariate normal distribution, we have
shown that our results are robust to the choice of parameters
and the target population.
Although we have boundaries for which screening scenar-
ios to support based on incremental benefits, accepting
screening scenarios with an incremental benefit �2.0% and
rejecting those �0.9%, we provide no guidance as to what to
do when the incremental benefit falls between these bound-
aries. Considering additional scenarios could help narrow this
interval, but it is unlikely that this method could be used to
define an exact cut-off. Rather we think that other country-
specific factors should be considered, including the underly-
ing risk of cervical cancer, the GDP, and the existing screen-
ing infrastructure.
In previous work, we estimated that, compared to no
screening, 74.1% of cervical cancers could be prevented if all
women were regularly screened.20 This is lower than the pro-
portion estimated in these simulations (86.5%). The simula-
tion
with

assumes
full
compliance to follow-up appointments, such as repeat screen-
ing and colposcopy, whereas our previous estimate only
assumed that all women regularly attended the screening
appointment, not follow-up. In addition, Landy et al. used

Cervical screening in women vaccinated against HPV

 empirical data from prior to 2012, when HPV triage was
introduced in England, whereas this simulation models cytol-
ogy with HPV triage, which would increase the estimated
proportion of cancers which would be prevented if all women
were screened regularly. The estimate with realistic screening
coverage, which does not assume full compliance to follow-
up, was 64.3% of cancers prevented compared to no screen-
ing in the simulation, and current screening was estimated to
prevent 60.5% in the previous research.
We have not incorporated individual-level information
about the simulated women (beyond age), though have
allowed 10% of women to be at higher risk of contracting
both HPV16/18 and other high-risk HPV. We do not con-
sider herd immunity, which would be expected to lower the
incremental benefit of additional screens in unvaccinated
women. We consider only a small range of possible screen-
ing scenarios, and a single level of realistic screening cover-
age. We have only considered women who were fully
vaccinated at age 12, prior to HPV exposure, or not vacci-
nated at all, not women who were partially vaccinated.
Despite these limitations, it is reassuring that different mod-
els developed by groups working independently produce
similar results.
New screening guidelines in the Netherlands, imple-
mented from January 2017, recommend HPV testing at ages
30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 (five lifetime screens) for women whose
previous tests were negative,21 and Australian guidelines, due
to be implemented in December 2017, recommend 5-yearly
screening for women aged 25–74 (10 lifetime screens) using
primary HPV testing.22 Assuming similar underlying risks
and test sensitivities, these simulation results suggest that
fewer lifetime screens in these countries would result in a
similar incidence rate in vaccinated women. Conversely offer-
ing only five lifetime screens to unvaccinated women would
lead to an increase in cancer incidence.
Our results are consistent with results from previous sim-
ulations studies, which demonstrate that less frequent screen-
ing is needed in women vaccinated with a 16/18-vaccine than
unvaccinated women to provide at least the same protection
against cervical cancer.23–25 Screening in women vaccinated
with the nonavalent vaccine has been considered in a simula-
tion study by Kim et al.,23 where 10-yearly HPV testing from
age 30 ($200,000 per QALY) or 35 ($50,000 or $100,000 per
QALY) to 64 were the most cost-efficient strategies. This cor-
responds to three or four lifetime screens, compared to our
result of two lifetime screens; in comparison, Naber et al.
concluded that the optimal screening strategy for women vac-
cinated against HPV-16/18 was three lifetime screens using
primary HPV screening with cytology triage.25 The range for
cost-effectiveness considered by Kim et al. was $50,000–
$200,000 per QALY gained, whereas in the United Kingdom,
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
considers an intervention to be potentially cost effective at
£20,000–£30,000 ($25,814–$38,721) per QALY gained. Our
study does not directly consider cost-effectiveness, but the
incremental benefit of each additional screen does so indi-
rectly, with current screening practice having an incremental
benefit of 2.0% compared to 6(10)-yearly screening in unvac-
cinated women, giving an approximate cut-off for what
reduction in cancer incidence is considered to be cost-
effective in England. In our model, the nonavalent vaccine
prevented 88.4% of cervical cancers across the 10,000 param-
eter sets considered, compared to 85.3% in Kim et al.’s simu-
lations. Additionally, the sensitivity of HPV testing and the
sensitivity of cytology to high-grade precancerous disease was
higher in our study, reflecting the high-quality cytology in
England.
We are aware of one simulation study which considers
screening combined with the nonavalent vaccine in England,26
though it evaluates scenarios at a population level, assuming
vaccination status will be unknown, rather than separately for
vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Additionally, the out-
come considered is cervical cancer death, rather than inci-
dence. That simulation concluded four lifetime screens was
most cost-efficient in England, though the difference in dis-
counted life-years between two and four lifetime screens was
around 0.0006 years (5.3 hr), which would be reduced if the
time taken to attend screening was accounted for. Assuming
realistic screening coverage in our simulations, the incremental
benefit acceptable in England appears to be 2.0% per additional
screen, corresponding to the prevention of 43 cancers per
100,000 screens (1 cancer per 2301 screens).
Our results clearly demonstrate that the screening pro-
gramme should be personalised based on vaccination status.
This will require the linkage of vaccination status to the
screening programme, a process already recommended in
England.27 In England, there are few inequalities in routine
(as opposed to catch up) HPV vaccine uptake by socioeco-
nomic status,28 though there is evidence of poor uptake
among certain cultural and ethnic groups. Current US guide-
lines recommend the same screening intervals for women
regardless of vaccination status,4 though this is likely to be
updated once vaccinated women enter screening and the data
have been evaluated. Assuming future cervical screening
guidelines differ for vaccinated and unvaccinated women,
countries which do not have a good record of who received
the HPV vaccine may wish to consider the potential use of
HPV antibody testing as part of a future cervical screening
programme. Whilst herd immunity will lead to a lower risk
in unvaccinated women in the vaccination era than prior to
vaccination, until the level of herd immunity has been estab-
lished to be safe to reduce the required frequency of cervical
screening, vaccinated and unvaccinated women should have
different screening algorithms.
At present, if women in England do not attend screening
after an invite, they are sent a reminder, then re-invited at
the age at which they would have been invited had they had
a negative test at the missed screen. With longer screening
intervals or a small number of lifetime screens, it would be
important to re-invite women at shorter intervals if they fail

 to attend – the longer intervals modelled in this article are
only safe following a negative HPV test.
Our analyses clearly demonstrate that many fewer lifetime
screens are necessary for vaccinated women to have the same
level of protection against cervical cancer as is currently pro-
vided by 3- and 5-yearly cytology screening in unvaccinated
women. Different screening algorithms will be appropriate
for vaccinated and unvaccinated women, at least until herd
immunity data confirms it is safe to reduce screening in
unvaccinated women. This emphasizes the importance of
recording vaccination status, and linking this information to
the screening programmes call–recall database.
