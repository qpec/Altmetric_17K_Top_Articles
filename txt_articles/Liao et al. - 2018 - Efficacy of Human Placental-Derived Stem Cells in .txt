ABSTRACT
Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a devastating inherited skin blistering disease
caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that encodes type VII collagen (C7), a major structural
component of anchoring fibrils at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). We recently demonstrated
that human cord blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells promote wound healing and ameli-
orate the blistering phenotype in a RDEB (col7a12/2) mouse model. Here, we demonstrate signifi-
cant therapeutic effect of a further novel stem cell product in RDEB, that is, human placental-
derived stem cells (HPDSCs), currently being used as human leukocyte antigen-independent donor
cells with allogeneic umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation in patients with malignant and
nonmalignant diseases. HPDSCs are isolated from full-term placentas following saline perfusion,
red blood cell depletion, and volume reduction. HPDSCs contain significantly higher level of both
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic stem and progenitor cells than cord blood and are low in T
cell content. A single intrahepatic administration of HPDSCs significantly elongated the median life
span of the col7a12/2 mice from 2 to 7 days and an additional intrahepatic administration signifi-
cantly extended the median life span to 18 days. We further demonstrated that after intrahepatic
administration, HPDSCs engrafted short-term in the organs affected by RDEB, that is, skin and
gastrointestinal tract of col7a12/2 mice, increased adhesion at the DEJ and deposited C7 even at 4
months after administration of HPDSCs, without inducing anti-C7 antibodies. This study warrants
future clinical investigation to determine the safety and efficacy of HPDSCs in patients with severe
RDEB. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2018;7:530–542
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
A major challenge for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a
generalized blistering in the skin as well as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A systemic approach
that is safe to patients and alleviates both the outside and inside manifestations is in great
demand for patients with RDEB. This article demonstrates significant therapeutic benefits of
human placental-derived stem cells (HPDSCs) in a mouse model of RDEB, in the absence of any
conditioning regimen. HPDSCs effectively migrated to the organs affected by RDEB, that is, skin
and GI tract, deposited the missing protein (C7), and significantly improved the adherence of
the epidermis to the dermis of the skin without inducing anti-C7 antibodies. As HPDSCs have
already been demonstrated to be safe in humans with malignant and nonmalignant diseases,
the results from this study will greatly facilitate a future clinical investigation using HPDSCs as
human leukocyte antigen-independent donor cells in patients with RDEB.
INTRODUCTION
Recessive
dystrophic
epidermolysis
bullosa
(RDEB) is an inherited mucocutaneous blistering
disease caused by mutations in COL7A1 [1]. This
gene encodes type VII collagen (C7), a major
component of anchoring fibrils at the dermal/
epidermal basement membrane zone (BMZ).
Patients with RDEB suffer from recurrent erosions
in the skin, oral mucosa, and gastrointestinal (GI)
and genito-urinary tracts [2]. Moreover, patients
with RDEB are at high risk of developing aggres-
sive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, which
is associated with a very poor prognosis [3–7].
Currently, there is no cure for RDEB, other than
supportive
and
palliative care.

 significant progress has been made toward more effective treat-
ment of patients with RDEB using a variety of approaches focusing
on repair of genetic defects, protein replacement, and cell thera-
pies [6, 8–16].
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that transplantation of
wild-type (WT) murine hematopoietic progenitor enriched cells
improves survival of col7a12/2 mice [17]. Subsequent clinical
studies in patients with RDEB indicated that allogeneic hemato-
poietic progenitor cell transplantation (AlloHPCT) following mye-
loablative chemotherapy results in improvement in wound
healing and increased C7 protein deposition at the dermal-
epidermal junction (DEJ) [10]. Complications from myeloablative
conditioning, however, have been a major limitation in this thera-
peutic approach. Furthermore, mortality from AlloHPCT is fre-
quently due to delay in neutrophil engraftment, which increases
the risk of the patients contracting opportunistic infections and
developing severe graft versus host disease (GvHD). Our recent
experience, as well as that of others, demonstrates better toler-
ance and less toxicity in patients with RDEB following reduced tox-
icity conditioning and AlloHPCT [18, 19].
Human placental-derived stem cells (HPDSCs) are a source of
stem cells obtained by Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (CCT)’s pro-
prietary process involving perfusion of donated full-term placentas
and depletion of red blood cells, nonviable cells, and tissue debris
[20]. Although both HPDSCs and human umbilical cord blood
(UCB) originate from placentas, the processing, that is, perfusion
of placentas versus gravity collection of blood, has resulted in phe-
notypic and functional differences between these two cell prod-
ucts. As HPDSCs are largely negative for major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II molecules, we initiated a pilot study of
investigating the safety and efficacy of adding HPDSCs without
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching (as universal donor
cells), in allogeneic UCB transplantation in children and adults
with selected malignant and nonmalignant diseases [20]. To date,
there have been no adverse events associated with HPDSC infu-
sions in the 35 patients enrolled to date. However, compared to
the mean of 97% whole donor UCB chimerism at day 30, the aver-
age percentage of whole blood HPDSC chimerism was less than
1%, suggesting a different functional property of HPDSC than UCB
in hematopoietic reconstitution [21]. Nevertheless, HPDSC infu-
sion appeared to facilitate UCB immune reconstitution and reduce
the probability of grade II–IV acute GvHD (aGVHD), compared
with historical data [21]. Furthermore, as HPDSCs are rich in stem
cells, we hypothesize that HPDSCs per se may have direct regener-
ative properties, which would grant their use as a product by itself
for the treatment of RDEB, without any toxic conditioning
regimen.
In this study, as a first step toward bringing HPDSCs to the
clinic in patients with RDEB, we examined the role of HPDSCs on
overall survival and different functional outcomes in a therapeutic
animal model of RDEB. We demonstrate that administration of
HPDSCs, without preconditioning or immunosuppression, has
therapeutic benefits in col7a12/2 mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
The Col7a12/2 RDEB mice were generated by breeding C57BL6/J
Col7a11/2 mice with the genotype determined by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) [22]. C57BL6/J Col7a11/2 mice, kindly
provided by Dr. Jouni Uitto at Thomas Jefferson University, were
developed by targeted ablation of the Col7a1 gene through out-
of-frame deletion of exons 14–18 [22]. All animal studies were
conducted using protocols approved by New York Medical College
Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC).
Preparation of HPDSCs
HPDSCs were prepared and cryopreserved at CCT in a Good Man-
ufacturing Practices-compliant facility, as previously reported [23].
Briefly, postpartum placentas were procured following full-
informed consent of donors with donor eligibility documentation
and quality control. HPDSC isolation and recovery were achieved
by cannulation of the umbilical vessels (two arteries and one vein)
under sterile conditions with polyethylene catheters connected to
a flow-controlled fluid circuit allowing perfusion of the placenta. A
total of 750 ml of perfusion solution (0.9% NaCl injection solution
USP Grade) (VWR, Radnor, PA) was collected from each placenta.
After red blood cell depletion using Hetastarch and volume reduc-
tion, the cells were cryopreserved in a solution containing 5%
human albumin and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with a controlled rate
freezer prior to final storage in the gas phase of a liquid nitrogen
tank. Viability
of
the
HPDSCs
was
determined
using
7-
aminoactinomycin D (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) by flow
cytometry.
Colony Forming Cell (CFU) Assay
CD341 cells were selected from HPDSCs with a human CD34 posi-
tive selection kit and isolated using automated cell separator
RoboSep (StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, Canada). The
CFU assay was performed using MethoCult, following the manu-
facturer’s protocol (StemCell Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, CD341
cells were mixed with complete MethoCult medium supple-
mented with stem cell factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating fac-
tor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
interleukin 3, interleukin 6, and erythropoietin (Epo) and plated in
triplicate at a density of 100, 300, and 1,000 cells per 35 mm plate,
respectively. After 2–3 weeks, the culture was evaluated for col-
ony formation and scoring using an inverted microscope and a
scoring grid.
Flow Cytometry Analysis
Flow cytometry analysis was performed to compare the immuno-
phenotypes of HPDSCs from six placentas with donor-matched
UCB. Post-thawed HPDSCs and UCB were resuspended in phos-
phate buffered solution (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum at a
density of 1 3 106/ml, incubated with conjugated antibodies
(Table 1) according to a standard protocol, and analyzed using BD
LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). To investigate the in vivo trafficking
of HPDSCs, peripheral blood and organs including lung, spleen,
bone marrow, GI, and skin were isolated from the recipient RDEB
mice on different days after HPDSC administration. Following lysis
of the red blood cells from the peripheral blood and mechanical
dissociation of the organs, single cell suspension was immuno-
stained with anti-HLA-A, B, C antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, CA)
and analyzed using MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotech, Inc.,
Auburn, CA).The level of human cell persistence was presented as
an average percentage of HLA-A,B,C positive cells of the total sin-
gle cell suspension from peripheral blood or organs of biological
repeats.

 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-
PCR) Analysis for type VII collagen Gene Expression in
HPDSCs
RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and
cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Prom-
ega, Madison, WI). PCR analysis was performed in standard PCR
conditions (initial denaturation at 948C for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of
948C 30 seconds, 608C 30 seconds and 728C 30 seconds, and fol-
lowed by a final extension of 728C for 3 minutes) with Choice-Taq
Blue DNA Polymerase (Denville Scientific, Inc., Holliston, MA). The
following two sets of COL7A1 primers were used for PCR amplifica-
tions: F1, TGACCCACGGACAGAGTTCG, R1, GATCAGGATGCAGACCT
TGG; F2, GGCTTCTGGGCTTAATGTG, R2, GGGCTGAGTAGTGAAGGAT,
as previously reported [24].
HPDSC Administration in col7a12/2 Mice
HPDSCs were thawed in the buffer composed of 1:1 mixture of
10% Dextran 40 in 0.9% NaCl and 5% human serum albumin and
resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of approxi-
mately 70,000 cells/ll. Next, 15 ll of the HPDSC suspension was
injected into the liver of newborn RDEB mice (D0) using a 31G
needle that was attached to MINJ-PD microINJECTOR (Tritech
Research, Los Angeles, CA) at an injection speed of 0.5 s/ml. The
dose per body weight is about 7 3 105 cells/g in mice. In the
group with repeated HPDSC administration, a second dose (1 3
106) HPDSCs was injected in D5–8 RDEB mice in the liver. The
same volume of the thawing buffer was injected in parallel as a
vehicle control. All the survivors included for the following assays
were genotyped to confirm the genetic knockout of the mice.
Quantitation of Anti-C7 Antibodies in the Sera of
Peripheral Blood
The presence of circulating anti-C7 antibodies in the RDEB mice
following stem cell injection(s) was evaluated by NC1-based
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as published before
with modifications [25]. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Maxi-
Sorp; Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with purified recombinant
NC1 domain of C7, kindly provided by Mei Chen, Ph.D., University
of Southern California, at a concentration of 1.5 lg/ml (0.15 lg/
well) in 100 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 for 1 hour at room tem-
perature. Following overnight incubation with blocking buffer
(PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) at 48C, the plates were
washed three times with PBS with 0.05%Tween-20 (PBST). NC1-
coated wells were subsequently incubated for an hour with 1:100
diluted sera obtained from WT, untreated RDEB, and RDEB mice
on different postnatal days after receiving HPDSCs or unrestricted
somatic stem cells (USSCs) injections, respectively. The serum
from the human C7 injected WT mice (an active EB acquisita (EBA)
model [26]), also kindly provided by Mei Chen, was used as a posi-
tive control. After washing with PBST three times, goat anti-
mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) diluted in PBST with 1% BSA (1: 50,000)
was added to the well and incubated for 30 minutes. After wash-
ing with PBST, SureBlue substrate (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD)
was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT. The reac-
tion was then stopped by hydrogen chloride based solution (KPL).
Optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm on a microplate
reader (Spectramax 320; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Sam-
ples were run in triplicate for each time point.
Histological and Immunocytochemical Analyses
Both front and hind paws as well as GI tract (small intestine) were
excised from the selected mice, embedded in Tissue-Tec OCT
Compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and stored at 2808C.
Six micrometer serial sections were cut for each specimen. H&E
staining was processed following standard procedures, at the Core
Histology Lab of New York Medical College.The percentage of sep-
aration at DEJ was calculated as average ratio of total detached/
overall DEJ per finger digit, for all the paws in the section, quanti-
tated with ImageJ by tracing the DEJ along the periphery of biop-
sies. To determine human cell engraftment in the recipient skin,
the sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with
Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M.) blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) in the presence of 0.1% Triton (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). The slides were then incubated with 1:100 diluted mouse
anti-human nuclei antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 48C
overnight, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-
mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei
were counterstained with Vectashield Mounting Medium with
DAPI (Vector Laboratories).The immunocytochemistry staining for
C7 was performed following the manufacturer’s recommendation:
the cryostat sections were incubated with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 10
minutes at 428C followed by hyaluronidase (2 mg/ml) digestion
for 30 minutes. The slides were then incubated with 1:60

 diluted rabbit anti-COL7A1 (EMD Chemicals, Fort Wentworth, GA)
antibody overnight at 48C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor
488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, NY) and mounting in the Vec-
tashield Mounting Medium with 4’,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole
(DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired by Nikon 90i
Eclipse microscope using the same setting for all the experimental
samples (Nikon Instrument, Inc., Melville, NY). For the preparation
of organotypic paw slice, paws were excised from newborn RDEB
mice, embedded in 3% low-melt agarose gel and cut into 250 lm
slice using a vibratome (Leica Biosystems Wetzlar, Germany). The
paw slices were immediately imaged under Nikon Eclipse TE300
microscope.
Ultrastructural Skin Examination
The preparation of skin biopsies for transmission electron micros-
copy (EM) was as previously described [27]. Skin biopsies were
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde overnight
at 48C. The skin was then washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, fol-
lowed by incubation with 1% osmium tetroxide solution at room
temperature for 1.5 hours. After washing in distilled water, sam-
ples were incubated in 2% uranyl acetate and dehydrated in etha-
nol and propylene oxide and embedded in epoxide resin.
Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate and examined in a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron
microscope. All chemicals and supplies used for EM were pur-
chased from Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc. (Hatfield, PA).
Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to determine the median life
span and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival
between different experimental groups (GraphPad Prism 6). An
unpaired Student’s t test was used to determine the difference in
the percentage of subset populations between HPDSCs and UCB
as well as the separation at DEJ at the basement membrane zone
the WT, untreated RDEB, and HPDSC treated RDEB mice. A p
value < .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
HPDSCs Are Rich in Both Hematopoietic and
Nonhematopoietic Stem Cells
The overall cell types as determined by flow cytometry analysis
are similar between HPDSCs and UCB. In both cell sources, greater
than 80% of the cells are lymphocytes, monocytes, or granulo-
cytes. Among the remaining cells, several different cell types are
identified, including hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs), megakaryocytic precursors, and endothelial progeni-
tors. HPDSCs contain a significantly greater amount of CD341
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells compared with donor-
matched UCB (Fig. 1A). Specifically, a subpopulation of cells with a
phenotype of CD341/CD452 was observed in a significantly
higher concentration in HPDSCs than UCB (1.9% vs. 0.1%,
p < .05), suggesting that the hematopoietic precursors in HPDSCs
are of a particularly immature phenotype. In addition, cells that
are positive for MSC markers, CD105, CD73, and CD200 were also
at a significantly higher concentration in HPDSCs. Moreover, 39%,
78%, 62%, 55%, and 40% of the cells within this MSC-like popula-
tion were positive for the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, CCR5,
CCR7, and CXCR4, respectively, implying chemoattractant proper-
ties in wound repair scenarios (Fig. 1B). In contrast, only 5% of the
cells within MSC-like population were positive for platelet-derived
growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRa), which has been shown to
mediate migration of bone marrow MSCs to wounding via high-
mobility group box 1-PDGFRa axis [28, 29]. In addition, immuno-
phenotyping revealed that HPDSCs have a lower percentage of T
cells than UCB, suggesting a lower risk for GVHD (Fig. 1C).
We also determined that cryopreserved HPDSC CD341 cells
have a high post-thaw viability (91.3%) and cell recovery. In vitro
CFU assays further demonstrated the proliferation and differentia-
tion functions of the progenitors including CFU-erythroid and
burst-forming unit-erythroid, CFU-granulocyte-macrophages and
CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte, from
post-thawed HPDSCs (Fig. 1D).
Intrahepatic Administration(s) of HPDSCs Significantly
Improved the Survival of RDEB Mice
Col7a12/2 mice are born with hemorrhagic erosions and without
treatment have a median life span of 2 days [27]. Due to poor
accessibility to the veins of neonatal mice, we injected HPDSCs or
vehicle in parallel in the liver of newborn RDEB mice, an approach
that is comparable to intravenous administration [27, 30]. We
demonstrated that injection of vehicle composed of dextran and
human serum albumin extended the survival of some recipients;
however, it was not statistically significant compared with the his-
torical survival of untreated RDEB mice (Fig. 2A). We postulate
that the vehicle improved the life span of some recipients by
adjusting fluid balance, similar to the Ringer’s lactate/dextrose
solution as reported before [22]. Significantly, after a single intra-
hepatic HPDSC administration on the day of birth (D0), the
median life span of the RDEB mice was elongated to 7 days
(n 5 32; p � .001 HPDSC treated vs. vehicle) and about 10% of the
recipient mice lived to adulthood (over 3 weeks) (Fig. 2A). Of
note, one recipient survived for 16 weeks before sacrifice. The
HPDSC-treated RDEB mice showed normal eating and grooming
behaviors. However, they were smaller in size and weight, com-
pared to healthy littermates. In patients with RDEB, the cumula-
tive risk of pseudosyndactyly reaches a plateau level of 98% by
the age of 20 and has been suggested to be triggered by pro-
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic phenotype of dermal fibroblasts
[31]. In the RDEB mice treated by HPDSCs, mitten deformity
started to appear at about 8 weeks of age and the digits were
almost completely fused by 12 weeks, particularly in the front
paws (Fig. 2B), similar to our previous report regarding RDEB mice
treated with human cord blood-derived USSCs [27]. We also dem-
onstrated that a second dose of HPDSC on day 5–7 significantly
extended the median life span to 18 days (n 5 24; p � .001 single
vs. repeated HPDSC administration(s)). Almost 40% and 16% of
the recipients survived to adulthood and past 15 weeks of age,
respectively (Fig. 2A). The repeated HPDSC administrations also
appeared to slow down the progression of pseudosyndactyly,
although a larger group size is required for a quantitative analysis.
As demonstrated in Figure 1B, by 12 weeks of age, there were
three distinct digits remaining in the RDEB mice that received
repeated (23) HPDSC administrations.
HPDSC Administration Resulted in C7 Expression in
RDEB Mice Without Eliciting Anti-C7 Antibodies
We first tested whether HPDSCs themselves express type VII colla-
gen and found by RT-PCR and quantitative PCR analyses that
HPDSC are not a source for C7 expression (Fig. 3A and data not
shown). Surprisingly, in contrast to a complete absence of C7 in

 the newborn untreated RDEB skin, a continuous C7 staining
appeared at the DEJ of the paw skin of 1- and 2-week-old HPDSC-
treated RDEB mice (Fig. 3B). In the paw skin of 7-week-old
HPDSC-treated RDEB mouse, C7 was mostly identified in patches,
particularly at or close to the region with dermal-epidermal sepa-
ration. The C7 staining was much less intense in the HPDSC-
treated RDEB mice that survived over three months (12, 14, 15,
and 16 weeks, respectively), but it was still detectable particularly
close to the dermal-epidermal separation (Fig. 3B and data not
shown).
A safety concern for the RDEB therapeutic strategy that
exposes the recipients to foreign C7 protein is the risk of
unwanted immune responses, that is, generating anti-C7 antibody
that subsequently binds to BMZ and initiates an immune attack in
the skin [32]. Therefore, we investigated the sera from HPDSC
administered mice at various time points (n5 7), from 20 to 130
Figure 1.

with those from negative (WTand untreated RDEB mice) and posi-

showed an OD of 0.876 0.01 and 0.0116 0.004, respectively,
with a 1:100 dilution (Fig. 3C). The level of anti-C7 reactivity in
sera of HPDSC treated mice fluctuated from 0.003 on D20 to 0.09
on D130 with an average OD of 0.04 6 0.029. It was previously
reported that positive reactivity of EBA patients with recombinant
C7 domain ranged between 0.3 and 2, and an OD value <0.2 was
considered as negative for the production of autoantibody [26].
Therefore, we can conclude that C7 originated from HPDSC
administration was well-tolerated in the recipients and did not
elicit significant adverse immune response, at least within our
time window of the experiments. In line with our previous work
[27], USSC administration did not result in significant anti-C7 IgG
production in these recipient mice.
HPDSC Administration Increased Adhesion at DEJ but
Did Not Rescue the Defective Anchoring Fibrils
As demonstrated in Figure 4A, a majority portion of epidermis
exhibited detachment from the dermis in the paw skin of RDEB
mice at newborn stage and 1 and 4 weeks after vehicle adminis-
tration (53%–76%; p > .05). The adhesion at DEJ was significantly
improved following administration of HPDSCs (Fig. 4A). Particu-
larly, only about 11% of the paw skin exhibited separation at DEJ,
at 1 and 2 weeks after a single HPDSC treatment (p< .001 com-
pared to newborn and vehicle controls). In addition, although the
adhesion deteriorated at DEJ in the HPDSC-treated mice at later
days (7 and 15 weeks), probably as results of increased abrasion
in the paws and loss of HPDSC cells in vivo (as described below),
the percentage of DEJ separation was still significantly lower in
these mice compared with the controls (p < .05).
We also examined the ultrastructure of RDEB skin after HPDSC
treatment. In the skin of 7- and 15-week-RDEB mice treated with
HPDSCs, numerous hemidesmosomes with defined inner and
outer plaques, similar to the WT, were present and were associ-
ated with bundles of inserting keratin intermediate filaments.
Hemidesmosomes were also connected with the well-formed
anchoring filaments abutting the lamina densa (Fig. 4B). However,
in contrast to the anchoring fibrils in WT skin, there were only
wisp structures emanating from the lamina densa in the skin of
HPDSC treated RDEB mice. Although there were more of these
wisp-like structures following HPDSCs compared to untreated
RDEB mice, HPDSC administration did not lead to the formation
of any anchoring fibrils with normal morphology.
Circulation of HPDSCs after Intrahepatic Injection and
Engraftment in the Skin and GI
To investigate the trafficking of HPDSCs after intrahepatic adminis-
tration, we prepared single cell suspensions from the peripheral
blood, lung, spleen, skin, GI (small intestines) and bone marrow of
recipient RDEB mice and performed flow cytometry analysis based
on the cell surface expression of class I HLA-A,B,C in HPDSC cells
(Fig. 5A). One week after intrahepatic administration, HLA-A, B, C
positive cells were present in the lung and peripheral blood
of col7a12/2 mice (Fig. 5B). Importantly, 0.52% 6 0.44% and
0.11% 6 0.06% of the skin and GI cell suspension from the 1-week-
old recipients (n5 2) were positive for human specific antigen,
respectively (Fig. 5B). The results indicate that HPDSCs entered the
circulation after intrahepatic injection and migrated to the organs
affected by RDEB. Furthermore, among the HLA-A,B,C positive cells
in the skin suspensions, 22% expressed CD45, indicating that both
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells migrated to the skin
(Fig. 5C). In addition, 18% of the human cells expressed CXCR4,
suggestive of an enrichment of the HPDSCs that responded to the
chemoattractant protein SDF1 in the skin. The human cells in the
GI tract also exhibited similar percentage of cell surface marker
expression (data not shown). Consistent with the low level of
PDGFRa expression in the HPDSCs before injection, PDGFRa was
not identified in the human HPDSCs that migrated to skin or GI
tract (data not shown). We further demonstrated that the percent-
age of human cells in skin and GI was increased to 3.47% 6 0.87%
and 0.79% 6 0.12%, respectively, in the 2-week-old recipients
(n5 3) (Fig. 5B). After 3 weeks, while most of the human cells had

 of the intravenously injected MSCs, secondary to the lung [33].
However, whether migration of HPDSCs to the spleen could be
correlated with anti-inflammatory effects on splenic function, as
previously suggested by the effects of MSCs in a chronic stroke rat
model [34], requires further investigation. Another intriguing find-
ing in this analysis is the migration of HPDSCs to the bone marrow
of col7a12/2 mice in the absence of any preconditioning. Similar
to the dynamics in skin and GI tract, the highest level of HPDSC
engraftment (3.8% 6 2.1%) occurred in bone marrow of the recip-
ients 2 weeks after HPDSC administration (Fig. 5B).The identity of
the cells and duration of persistence in bone marrow, skin, and GI
tract of the recipients are currently under investigation.
Cutaneous wounds and esophageal strictures are the most
apparent manifestations in patients with RDEB. What is rarely
reported in patients, but demonstrated in the col7a12/2 mice, is
extensive hemorrhagic erosion in the intestines, in addition to the
paws (Fig. 6A). To investigate the niche of HPDSC in the skin and
GI tract, we performed immunocytochemical staining using
human specific nuclei antibody on the sections of skin and GI
tract. Consistent with the detection of human cells by flow

 cytometry, human specific staining was observed in the skin of
RDEB mice 1, 2, and 2 weeks after HPDSC administration (Fig. 6B).
However, only dermal engraftment was identified and there was
no evidence for their conversion into epidermal or endothelial
cells (data not shown). Human cells were also identified in the
tongue and intestine of the 2-week-old HPDSC treated RDEB mice
(Fig. 6C). Importantly, human cells were not observed in the intes-
tinal villus, but were mainly in the outmost layer of intestine, that
is, serosa, as well as the mesentery, which is continuous with the
serosa. However, human cells were no longer revealed by immu-
nostaining in the biopsies of 6 week or older RDEB mice treated
with HPDSCs.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated that HPDSCs contain a significantly
higher percentage of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic
progenitor cells than cord blood and have important regenerative
functions of HPDSCs in a col7a12/2 mouse model. The human
placenta is not only a crucial organ system for the survival and
growth of the fetus, but also a hematopoietic organ during fetal
development [35–37]. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
persist throughout gestation from placental blood, vessel perfus-
ate and cells from digested placenta tissue. The stromal cells
generated from placenta also possess pericyte characteristics and
may provide a supportive microenvironment for hematopoiesis
[35]. Here, HPDSCs are perfusate from full-term placenta with
minimal manipulation. Ongoing clinical studies have demon-
strated that adding HPDSCs as an adjuvant with UCBT in patients
with malignant and nonmalignant diseases has had no adverse
effects and may reduce the incidence of aGVHD [20].
Regardless of the potential role in supporting hematopoiesis,
we demonstrated in this study that HPDSCs per se had regenera-
tive activity in a col7a12/2 mouse model of RDEB.The median life

 span of the RDEB mice was significantly elongated after HPDSC
administration, similar to what we previously reported after USSC
administration [27]. In contrast to USSCs, which are a relatively
pure population of nonhematopoietic stem cells, HPDSCs consist
of various cellular subsets and do not express significant amount
of type VII collagen. Yet, surprisingly, administration of HPDSCs in
RDEB mice led to deposition of C7 at the basement membrane
zone. As RDEB mice completely lack C7, the detected C7 protein
could only come from the administered HPDSCs. However, the
identity of the HPDSCs that engrafted in the dermis and cellular
origin of the C7 remain to be determined. It is possible that the
nonhematopoietic MSC-like cells in HPDSCs engrafted in the skin
and secreted C7, as they express significant levels of various che-
mokine receptors and flow cytometry analysis revealed an enrich-
ment of CXCR4 positive cells in the RDEB skin a week after HPDSC
administration. On the other hand, some subset of stem cells in
HPDSCs of an immature phenotype may have the ability to
undergo differentiation into a dermal cell fate and contribute to
skin regeneration.
It has to be noted that the anchoring fibrils were still far from
normal in the skin of HPDSC-treated RDEB mice. K€
uhl et al.
recently determined the half-life of C7 in the skin to be approxi-
mately 1 month and the disappearance of anchoring fibrils fol-
lowed the rate of C7 loss [38]. In this study, the C7 was more
continuous along the DEJ within 2 weeks of HPDSC administration
however became less intense and mostly patchy in the skin of 7
weeks and older HPDSC treated RDEB mice.This is consistent with
the loss of C7 over time. The other consideration is that it took 18
months for the anchoring fibrils to mature in human skin regener-
ation from cultured epithelial autografts on full thickness burn
wounds [39]. It is thus likely that the level of C7 secreted by
HPDSCs was insufficient or too short-term for its correct assembly
into anchoring fibrils. Nevertheless, administration of HPDSCs sig-
nificantly improved the adhesion at DEJ, particularly within first 2
weeks of age. One can also infer from the survival curves of the
RDEB mice of different treatment groups that the first week of life
was important and once the animals pass this critical age, they
have a better chance for the long-term survival. Indeed, the com-
plex cellular composition in HPDSCs suggests that the mechanism
of action for skin regeneration is likely to be multifactorial. The
col7a12/2 mice are born with extensive hemorrhagic breakage in
not only the skin, but also the GI tract. In addition to depositing
C7 at DEJ, the monocytes, megakaryocytes, or any unidentified
subset of HPDSCs may have played a role in alleviating hemor-
rhagic blistering and promoting wound healing in RDEB. In
patients with RDEB, chronic inflammation and fibrosis are the
morbid manifestations that further result in pseudosyndactyly
and development of aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carci-
noma [40]. In this study, RDEB mice still developed pseudosyndac-
tyly after HPDSC administration. Nystrom et al. previously
demonstrated that administration of losartan significantly reduces
fibrosis and prolongs the progression of fibrotic digit fusion via
antagonizing transforming growth factor (TGF)-b signaling in C7-
hypomorphic mice [41]. The current study suggests that repeated
HPDSC administration may have delayed the progression of pseu-
dosyndactyly. Future study will quantitatively determine whether
a more frequent administration of HPDSCs may further delay or
slow down the progression of mitten deformities and whether
this effect of HPDSCS is mediated through TGFb signaling. More-
over, continued investigation on the cellular identity of the human
cells isolated from the mucocutaneous membranes of RDEB mice
using single-cell transcriptome analysis will potentially lead to the
development of more effective therapies and facilitate the clinical
translation of HPDSCs in patients with RDEB.
It is important to note that the size of HPDSCs is much smaller
(4–12 lm) compared to other cells such as MSCs that are derived
and cultured in vitro (30 lm in diameter in suspension [42]).
Therefore, the risk of HPDSCs to form emboli in the lung vessels,
even at a high dose, is much lower than that of MSCs. Lee et al.
previously reported that more than 80% of MSCs accumulated in
the lung of mouse recipients within a few minutes of injection,
with formation of emboli in some recipients [43]. The authors also
reported an exponential decrease of MSC signal in the overall
body followed by a complete disappearance after 4 days [43]. In
addition, MSCs generally do not home to bone marrow [42]. This
study demonstrated that in the absence of prior irradiation and
concurrent immunosuppression, HPDSCs circulated from lung to
the peripheral blood and migrated to skin, GI tract, and bone mar-
row. Importantly, 3 weeks post HPDSC administration, even
though very few human cells persisted in the lung or peripheral
blood, their engraftment was still identified in the skin, GI, and
bone marrow. Our previous data suggest that the immune system
in the col7a12/2 mice may be compromised thus allowing a lon-
ger persistence of allogeneic cells than otherwise in healthy recipi-
ents [27]. It is unclear whether this would be the case for the
patients with RDEB. El-Darouti et al. recently demonstrated that
i.v. MSCs with and without the use of cyclosporine similarly
improved wound healing in patients with RDEB, suggesting that
concomitant immunosuppression was not necessary for the MSC
therapy [44]. In this study, the human cells were identified in 3-
week-old mice but were no longer detected in the 6-week or older
RDEB mice. Therefore, the human cells disappeared from the
recipients between 3 and 6 weeks of age. Our future work will
evaluate the effects of concurrent immunosuppression on long-
term engraftment of HPDSC and therapeutic outcomes in the
RDEB mice.
There were several limitations associated with this study
that might impact the translational relevance of the work. Due
to early demise of the col7a1 knockout mice consistently
reported by us and others [17, 22, 27, 45], improvement on the
median life span and long-term survival were used as important
readouts for the therapeutic function of HPDSCs in this animal
model. Although multiple mechanisms as discussed above could
be inferred for the benefits, prolonging the survival of col7a1
knockout mice is not clinically directly relevant to the human
patients with RDEB. Moreover, as a result of poor survival of
col7a12/2 mice, the study was not designed to have a specific
number of survivors at prescribed time points and conclusions
made for later time points were based on low number of mice.
Thus, more animals are required to investigate further therapeu-
tic functions of HPDSCs on fibrosis and mitten deformity, which
develop later in life and are more clinically relevant to patients
with RDEB. Last, in this proof of principle study, each col7a2/2
newborn mouse received about a million HPDSCs. In our clinical
studies, the enrolled patients with malignant and nonmalignant
diseases each received a full HPDSC donor unit, varying from 50
to 500 million cells [20]. Therefore, the dose administered in the
neonatal mice in the current study was high considering their
small body size. Whether there is a threshold for the dose
response in the survival or the level of C7 at DEJ in the col7a12/
2 mice requires further investigation. Nevertheless, based on
disappearance of HPDSCs and decrease of C7 with time in the
540

 treated mice, we speculate that serial administration, rather
than escalating a single dose of HPDSCs would result in more
sustained therapeutic benefits in the treatment of RDEB.
Although the dose per HPDSC unit is limited without ex vivo
expansion, an advantage of using HPDSCs as a cell product is
that there is no shortage of donor sources, that is, placentas.
Therefore, considering a potential demand for serial HPDSC infu-
sions in patients with RDEB, we will next investigate the feasibil-
ity and efficacy of infusing multiunit HPDSCs in col7a12/2 mice.
CONCLUSION
HPDSCs are rich in hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryocytic pre-
cursors, and nonhematopoietic stem cells, which suggest multifac-
torial mechanisms of action for RDEB skin regeneration. Systemic
administration of HPDSCs in col7a12/2 mice alleviated hemor-
rhagic blistering and significantly improved the dermal-epidermal
attachment in the skin. In addition, HPDSCs effectively migrated
from lung to the organs affected by RDEB, that is, skin and GI tract
and deposited C7 without inducing anti-C7 antibodies in the recip-
ient mice.This study provides a basis for a translational pilot phase
I trial to investigate the safety and feasibility of administration of
HPDSC alone or in combination with UCB transplantation in
patients with RDEB.
