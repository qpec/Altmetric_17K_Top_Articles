Excess collagen synthesis (fibrogenesis) in the liver plays a causal role in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD). Methods are needed to identify patients with more rapidly progressing disease and to demonstrate early response
to treatment. We describe here a novel method to quantify hepatic fibrogenesis flux rates both directly in liver tissue and
noninvasively in blood. Twenty-one patients with suspected NAFLD ingested heavy water (2H2O, 50-mL aliquots) two to
three times daily for 3-5 weeks prior to a clinically indicated liver biopsy. Liver collagen fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and
plasma lumican FSR were measured based on 2H labeling using tandem mass spectrometry. Patients were classified by histol-
ogy for fibrosis stage (F0-F4) and as having nonalcoholic fatty liver or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Magnetic reso-
nance elastography measurements of liver stiffness were also performed. Hepatic collagen FSR in NAFLD increased with
advancing disease stage (e.g., higher in NASH than nonalcoholic fatty liver, positive correlation with fibrosis score and liver
stiffness) and correlated with hemoglobin A1C. In addition, plasma lumican FSR demonstrated a significant correlation with
hepatic collagen FSR. Conclusion: Using a well-characterized cohort of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, this study dem-
onstrates that hepatic scar in NASH is actively remodeled even in advanced fibrosis, a disease that is generally regarded as
static and slowly progressive. Moreover, hepatic collagen FSR correlates with established risks for fibrotic disease progression
in NASH, and plasma lumican FSR correlates with hepatic collagen FSR, suggesting applications as direct or surrogate
markers, respectively, of hepatic fibrogenesis in humans. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;65:78-88).
N
onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rep-
resents the most common cause of liver dis-
ease in developed countries, affecting an
estimated 30% of the US population.(1,2) The NAFLD
diagnosis covers a spectrum of disease states ranging
from simple steatosis, termed “nonalcoholic fatty liver”
(NAFL), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with
severe fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver
failure. The rate of NAFLD progression from NAFL
to NASH or from NASH with mild fibrosis to cirrho-
sis varies greatly from patient to patient. A recent

 found that the one-stage fibrosis progression of NAFL
subjects was about half that of NASH subjects (7.1
versus 14.3 years), indicating a correlation between dis-
ease severity and progression rate.(3) Furthermore,
approximately 20% of patients diagnosed with NASH
with fibrosis are found to be “fast progressers,” rapidly
advancing to cirrhosis in fewer than 10 years.(3,4)
Repeat liver biopsies with histopathologic assessment
remain the “gold standard” for monitoring fibrosis pro-
gression in NAFLD patients. As a result of the well-
documented limitations of biopsy (e.g., morbidity from
the procedure, anatomic heterogeneity of fibrosis in the
liver), several noninvasive methods for assessing liver
fibrosis have also gained attention, including the mea-
surement of liver stiffness by transient elastography
(FibroScan) or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)
and serum biomarker panels (e.g., FibroTest, Fibrosis-4
[Fib-4]), each of which has been reported to correlate
with histological fibrosis stage in clinical studies.(2,5-7) A
limitation to these approaches is that they only measure
fibrotic disease status at a moment in time, rather than
predicting the trajectory of future disease progression.
Identification of those patients with fast-progressing
fibrotic disease is therefore typically delayed until they
already have late-stage fibrosis. In addition, with the
slow rate of evolution of liver fibrosis typically requiring
at least 1-2 years for changes in large populations of sub-
jects to be reliably detected, drug trials are unable to
monitor early clinical response to antifibrotic interven-
tions. Diagnostic approaches that effectively predict indi-
vidual clinical fibrotic disease progression over shorter
periods of time would therefore be extremely valuable.(8)
Direct quantification of the flux rate of collagen syn-
thesis and degradation (i.e., turnover) in the liver may, in
principle, predict the likelihood of rapid advancement of
fibrotic liver disease. By monitoring the rate of tracer
incorporation into molecules associated with specific
disease-related pathways, diagnostic approaches using
stable isotope tracers allow for such measurements.(9)
We have measured the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of
hepatic collagen in patients with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection by administering heavy water (2H2O)
prior to liver biopsy combined with tandem mass spec-
trometric (MS/MS) analysis of proteins from liver tis-
sue.(10) We observed a wide range of FSRs for liver
collagen among HCV patients as well as a positive corre-
lation between collagen FSR and histological fibrosis
stage, suggesting more extracellular matrix (ECM)
remodeling in more advanced disease. Furthermore,
shotgun analysis of HCV patient plasma identified the
FSR of circulating lumican, a proteoglycan involved in
collagen fibril formation shown to be overexpressed by
hepatocytes in patients with NASH,(11) as having a sig-
nificant correlation with hepatic collagen FSR, thereby
representing a potential minimally invasive surrogate
marker of liver collagen remodeling rate.
Here, we present an analysis of hepatic collagen and
plasma lumican FSRs measured cross-sectionally in 21
patients diagnosed with NAFLD. Histologic scoring
of steatohepatitis and fibrosis, MRE analysis of liver
stiffness, Fib-4 scoring, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
levels were also assessed to determine the relationship
between hepatic fibrogenesis rate and other factors that
have been established to predict clinical progression
rate in large NAFLD patient populations. We hypoth-
esized that ECM would be dynamic even in advanced
fibrotic disease, that hepatic collagen FSR would corre-
late with established risks for fibrotic disease progres-
sion in NASH, and that plasma lumican FSR would
correlate with hepatic collagen FSR, providing a
potential minimally invasive approach for quantifying
hepatic fibrotic disease activity.

 Participants and Methods
STUDY DESIGN: SUBJECT
RECRUITMENT, 2H2O LABELING,
AND TISSUE COLLECTION
A total of 24 subjects undergoing diagnostic liver
biopsy for suspected NAFLD were recruited by
the NAFLD Research Center(12-15) at the Universi-
ty of California–San Diego. Subjects were carefully
screened and excluded for liver diseases other than
NAFLD and secondary causes of hepatic steatosis
as described (Supporting Information). Subjects
drank 50 mL of 70% 2H2O three times per day for
4 days, followed by twice a day until the date of
liver biopsy, for a total period of 3-5 weeks.
Plasma, urine, and saliva were collected weekly from
the start of heavy water labeling until the time of
biopsy. Twenty-one subjects completed the study
with a confirmed histological diagnosis of NAFLD
(1 patient refused biopsy, 2 patients ultimately
appeared not to have NAFLD). All procedures used
in this study were approved by the University of
California–San Diego Human Research Protections
Program. Subjects provided written informed con-
sent, and Declaration of Helsinki protocols were
followed.
HISTOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
All patients underwent liver biopsies, which were
scored using the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clini-
cal Research Network histological scoring system.(16)
Liver biopsies were scored by an experienced hepato-
pathologist blinded to the patients’ clinical and
radiological data. Hepatic fibrosis was scored on a
five-point scale (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). Hepatic steatosis
and lobular inflammation were scored on a four-
point scale (0, 1, 2, and 3), with hepatic ballooning
and portal inflammation scored on a three-point scale
(0, 1, and 2). The NAFLD activity score (NAS) was
calculated as the sum of the steatosis, lobular inflam-
mation, and ballooning scores, ranging 0-8. Patients
were classified into NAFL and NASH. Patients with
NAFLD who did not meet criteria for NASH were
classified as NAFL. NASH was defined as presence
of ballooning, steatosis, and lobular inflammation
with a pattern consistent with steatohepatitis with or
without perisinusoidal fibrosis.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE
ELASTOGRAPHY
MRE was performed as described(5,17-20) using
commercially available software and hardware from
Resoundant Inc. (Rochester, MN). A detailed descrip-
tion of MRE analytical methods is included (Support-
ing Information).
LIVER TISSUE PREPARATION
Biopsied liver tissue (3-5 mg) was homogenized in
water using a Fast Prep-24 bead mill (MP Biomedical,
Burlingame, CA), followed by hepatic protein quanti-
fication using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo,
Rockford, IL). Liver protein (80 lg) was denatured
with urea (4M) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate
(pH 8). Samples were reduced with 5 mM tris(2-car-
boxyethyl)phosphine for 20 minutes at room tempera-
ture
with
mixing,
followed
by
incubation
with
iodoacetamide (10 mM) in the dark for 20 minutes to
chemically modify reduced cysteines. Following sample
dilution, proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega,
Madison, WI) at 378C overnight. The following day
formic acid was added to a total volume of 5%, and
peptides were concentrated and desalted prior to liquid
chromatography (LC)–MS/MS using a C18 spec tip
(Varian, Palo Alto, CA).
IMMUNOPRECIPITATION OF
PLASMA PROTEINS
Immunoprecipitation of plasma lumican, transform-
ing growth factor beta–induced protein, tenascin C,
and ECM-1 was performed using a combination of
streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (88817; Thermo
Fisher)
and
biotinylated
antibodies
(BAF2846,
BAF2935, BAF3358, BAF3937; R&D Systems).
Plasma samples (1 mL volume) were spiked with 1.5
lg of each biotinylated antibody, followed by overnight
incubation at 48C with rotation. Samples were then
allowed to return to room temperature and transferred
to fresh tubes containing streptavidin-coated magnetic
beads (2.5 lg beads/lg of antibody). Tubes were incu-
bated at room temperature for 60 minutes, followed by
isolation of magnetic beads using a magnetic stand
(DynaMag-2; Thermo Fisher). Beads were then rinsed
three times with 1 mL 0.1% Tween-20 and three times
with phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecific
proteins and residual surfactant, respectively. Proteins
were then eluted twice with 100 lL 33% acetonitrile/

 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluents were combined,
dried by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted
in 50 mM NH4HCO3, 50% trifluoroethanol, and
50 mM dithiothreitol, followed by incubation at
608C for 1 hour. Iodoacetamide (50 mM) was added
to samples, followed by incubation in the dark for
20 minutes. Samples were then diluted, digested with
trypsin overnight, spiked with 0.15% trifluoroacetic
acid, vacuum-centrifuged, and reconstituted in 0.1%
formic acid/3% acetonitrile prior to LC-MS/MS
analysis.
MEASUREMENT OF PLASMA 2H2O
ENRICHMENT
2H2O enrichment in patient plasma was determined
from 75 lL of human plasma by gas chromatographic/
MS analysis as described.(21)
LC-MS/MS PEPTIDE ANALYSIS
Trypsin-digested liver and plasma proteins were
analyzed on Agilent 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight
mass spectrometers fitted with 1260 Chip Cube nano
ESI sources (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
Peptides were separated chromatographically using a
Polaris HR chip (Agilent G4240-62030) consisting of
a 360-nL enrichment column and a 0.075 3 150 mm
analytical column, each packed with Polaris C18-A
stationary phase with 3 lm particle size. Mobile phases
were (A) 5% vol/vol acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid
in deionized water and (B) 95% acetonitrile and 0.1%
formic acid in deionized water. Peptides were eluted at
a flow rate of 350 nL/min with a 27-minute LC gradi-
ent. Each sample was initially analyzed for protein/
peptide
identification
in data-dependent
MS/MS
mode, followed by analysis for peptide quantitative iso-
tope abundance in MS mode. In MS/MS mode,
acquisition rates were 6 Hz for MS and 4 Hz for MS/
MS with up to 20 precursors per cycle. Acquisition in
MS mode was 0.6 Hz.
DETERMINATION OF PROTEIN
FSRs AND RELATIVE
ABUNDANCES
Protein identification, FSR calculations, and data-
filtering criteria were performed as described.(10,22)
Acquired MS/MS spectra were extracted and searched
using Spectrum Mill Proteomics Workbench software
(version
B.04.00;
Agilent
Technologies)
and
a
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
human
protein
database
(20,265 proteins, UniProt.org, release 2013_05). Fixed
modifications (carbamidomethylation of cysteine) and
variable modifications (oxidized methionine, pyroglu-
tamic acid, hydroxylation of proline) were enabled with
up to two missed cleavages permitted. Search results
were autovalidated with a global false discovery rate of
1%. Proteins with scores >11.0 were reported, and a
list of peptides with scores >6 and scored peak intensi-
ties >50% was exported from Spectrum Mill and con-
densed to a nonredundant peptide formula database
using Excel. This database, containing peptide ele-
mental composition, mass, and retention time was
used to extract mass isotopomer abundances (M0-M3)
of each peptide from corresponding MS-only acquisi-
tion files with the Find-by-Formula algorithm in Mass
Hunter (version B.05.00; Agilent Technologies). Soft-
ware developed at KineMed, Inc., was used to calculate
peptide elemental composition and curve-fit parame-
ters for determining peptide isotope enrichment or,
more specifically, the change in fractional abundance
of the parental 12C M0 mass isotopomer, in newly syn-
thesized proteins during the period of heavy water
exposure, based on measured precursor body water
enrichment and the number of amino acid C–H posi-
tions per peptide that metabolically incorporate hydro-
gen and deuterium from body water while free amino
acids. Subsequent data handling was performed using
Microsoft Excel templates, with input of preceding
body water enrichment for each subject, calculating the
median FSR of peptides analyzed for each protein to
yield FSR data at the protein level. Average body water
enrichment from the start of 2H2O labeling until the
time of tissue collection was used for the calculation of
peptide FSRs at each time point. To account for vari-
ability in subject labeling times or to combine data
from multiple sampling time points, protein FSRs per
day were calculated by fitting to a one-phase exponen-
tial association: FSR 5 ln(1 – f)/t, where f is the frac-
tion of the peptide that was newly synthesized at any
time point. Kinetic data from hepatic and plasma pro-
tein digests were filtered to exclude proteins with fewer
than two peptides that had usable isotopic measure-
ments. For individual samples analyzed more than
once in MS mode (analytical replicates), the median
FSR from multiple observations of unique peptides
was used for subsequent calculations of protein FSR.
Correction for observed baseline deviation(9) in iso-
topomer abundances was performed using a linear
model derived from an unlabeled standard sample.
Determination of liver and plasma protein FSRs was

 blinded from histological scoring, MRE scoring, and
blood test results; and all final values for protein FSRs
were locked at the analytic facility prior to unblinding
the subject identities and clinical results by the clinical
team.
STATISTICS
Linear correlation coefficients, significance of non-
zero slopes, t tests, and analysis of variance comparing
hepatic and plasma protein FSRs, magnetic resonance
imaging data, histological scoring, and/or clinical lab
data were performed in GraphPad Prism. P < 0.05
was considered significant.

 completed the study with a confirmed histological
diagnosis of NAFLD (10 NAFL, 11 NASH). Patient
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Subject age
and body mass index were not significantly different
between those diagnosed with NAFL and NASH, and
gender differences were minor between groups (4/10
of NAFL and 6/11 of NASH patients were female).
NAS and fibrosis scores for subjects with NASH (4.55
6 1.13 and 2.18 6 1.17) were significantly higher
than those observed in subjects with NAFL (3.14 6
0.69 and 0.40 6 0.52). The hepatocyte ballooning
subcomponent of NAS scoring was significantly differ-
ent between NASH and NAFL (P < 0.001), while
steatosis and inflammation scores were not. Portal
inflammation score, aspartate transaminase level, and
HbA1c level were also significantly different between
groups (P < 0.05). Noninvasive assessment of liver
stiffness performed by MRE was significantly higher
in patients with NASH than NAFL (P 5 0.03). Fib-4
score was unable to differentiate patients with NAFL
versus NASH.
RELATIONSHIP OF HEPATIC
COLLAGEN FSR WITH FIBROSIS
STAGE
FSR of hepatic collagen (type 1, subunit a1) was sig-
nificantly higher in patients with NASH compared to
NAFL (Fig. 2A; P < 0.05). Collagen FSR in patients
with NAFL ranged 0.08%-0.75% per day (mean 0.43

2.72% per day (mean 0.97 6 0.69%). Of the five
NASH subjects having collagen FSRs >1% per day,
four had histologic fibrosis scores of F2-F4. Linear
regression analysis also demonstrated a significant
positive correlation between histological fibrosis score
and hepatic collagen FSR (Fig. 2B; r 5 0.62, P <
0.01). In addition, hepatic collagen FSR correlated
significantly with noninvasive metrics of liver fibrosis
stage, including liver stiffness by MRE (Fig. 2C; r 5
0.64, P < 0.01) and Fib-4 score (Fig, 2D; r 5 0.58, P
< 0.01). Hepatic collagen FSR also correlated with
HbA1c levels (Fig, 2E; r 5 0.46, P < 0.05) and was
significantly higher in patients with a histologic bal-
looning score of 2 (Fig. 2F; P < 0.05).
COMPARISON OF PLASMA
LUMICAN FSR TO LIVER
COLLAGEN FSR AND FIBROSIS
STAGE
Linear regression analysis revealed a significant cor-
relation between liver collagen FSR and plasma lumi-
can FSR, for all subjects (Fig. 3A; r 5 0.68, P < 0.01)
as well as for subjects with NASH 1 fibrosis only (Fig.
3B; r 5 0.83, P < 0.01). Turnover rates for plasma
lumican ranged from 1.71% to 5.75% per day (Fig.
3C), roughly 3-fold faster than that of hepatic colla-
gen. Similar to hepatic collagen FSR, plasma lumican
FSR also correlated with noninvasive metrics of fibro-
sis stage including liver stiffness (Fig. 3D; r 5 0.70,

Discussion
The clinical progression rate of NAFLD is highly
variable, with histologic degree of fibrosis representing
the strongest current predictor of disease progression.
Accordingly, ECM deposition is believed to play a
central causal role in disease progression, but there are
currently no reliable clinical techniques for quantifying
activity or flux of the fibrotic pathway. Using heavy
water labeling combined with LC-MS/MS analysis to
assess ECM protein remodeling rates and a cross-
sectional study design, we evaluated the hypotheses,
first, that hepatic fibrogenesis rate can be measured in
NAFLD subjects both directly from liver tissue and
noninvasively from blood and, second, that the rate of
fibrogenesis will correlate with established risk factors
for disease progression.
We report the first direct measurements of hepatic
collagen FSR in patients with NAFLD. As opposed to
traditional approaches that monitor fibrosis progres-
sion through serial static measurements over a time
period of months or years, the heavy water labeling
approach described here measures the integrated rate
of hepatic fibrogenic disease activity in a patient over a
time period of weeks. As expected, we observed signifi-
cantly higher hepatic collagen FSR in patients with
NASH versus NAFL, consistent with the documented
higher rate of fibrotic disease progression in NASH.(3)
Similar to our previous study in HCV patients,(10) we
also observed a strong positive correlation between
hepatic collagen FSR and histologic fibrosis stage,
indicating a general acceleration in fibrotic disease
activity with more advanced disease. This conclusion
was also supported by the significant correlation of liv-
er collagen FSR with MRE-quantified liver stiffness,
another indicator of fibrotic disease severity.
It is important to emphasize that collagen FSR
reflects at steady state both synthesis and degradation
rates (i.e., collagen remodeling or turnover) in the tis-
sue and that the measured FSR values of �1%/day for
liver collagen in NASH patients represent a replace-
ment half-life of about 2 months. Because net liver col-
lagen content does not increase at anywhere near a

 doubling time of 2 months, these results reveal the per-
haps surprising conclusion that liver collagen remodel-
ing
rates
are
higher
in
more
advanced
fibrotic
disease—i.e., that the collagen pool in more fibrotic
livers has a shorter half-life than in early disease. This
observation is novel in NAFLD and has potentially
intriguing therapeutic implications, in that dynamic
hepatic scar in NASH may be potentially reversible if
ongoing collagen deposition rates can be reduced.
It is also important to point out that fibrogenesis
rate is fundamentally different from static content of
scar and that the two measurements did not need to
correlate. Fibrosis stage is a static measurement and
represents total accumulation of collagen or ECM over
time, while the FSR is a flux rate and reveals the
dynamics of turnover at the present moment and could
even be inversely correlated (i.e., the more scar, the
longer its life span might be). Our finding that colla-
gen turnover is higher in more advanced stages of liver
fibrosis is in our view novel and pathophysiologically
interesting but not a criterion for validation of the
kinetic measurement.
Hepatic collagen FSR correlated significantly with
HbA1c levels, consistent with previous studies report-
ing a higher prevalence of advanced fibrotic disease in
the subpopulation of NAFLD patients with type 2
diabetes.(23) A correlation between a single HbA1c val-
ue and the cumulative histologic fibrosis stage would
not be expected, but what we measured here was fibro-
genesis rate at a moment in time, just as HbA1c repre-
sents glycemic control at a point in time. Although a
causal relationship cannot be inferred, correlating cur-
rent fibrogenesis rate with current HbA1c is potential-
ly
informative.
Confirming
the
nature
of
this
relationship will require larger studies, however.
We next assessed plasma lumican FSR in NAFLD
based on our previous finding of a significant correla-
tion between hepatic collagen FSR and plasma lumi-
can FSR in patients with HCV infection.(10) We
observed in NAFLD a significant correlation between
plasma lumican FSR and hepatic collagen FSR, pro-
viding a potentially noninvasive approach to identify
patients with active fibrotic disease. We recently
reported a similar heavy water labeling–based “virtual
biopsy” approach for measuring the FSR of skeletal
muscle proteins from the turnover of muscle-specific
proteins that are found in blood (e.g., creatine kinase-
type M and carbonic anhydrase-3).(24) Lumican, a pro-
teoglycan involved in collagen fibril formation and the
regulation of transforming growth factor-b activity, is
not a liver-specific protein but has previously been
shown to be overexpressed in hepatic tissue collected
from patients with NASH.(11) Knockout studies in
mice have also demonstrated a requirement for lumi-
can in the development of liver fibrosis.(25) Hepatic
cell–derived lumican may therefore represent a signifi-
cant proportion of circulating lumican in NASH sub-
jects with active liver fibrosis, allowing the FSR of
lumican in plasma to reflect activity of the fibrogenic
pathway in liver. Importantly, plasma lumican exhibits
approximately 3 times higher FSR than liver collagen,
providing an operational advantage for use as a diag-
nostic marker (a shorter time is required for measurable
clinical labeling).
We used the combined data from weekly plasma
lumican FSR measurements made over 3 weeks for
calculations here, but a shorter heavy water exposure
period (e.g., 1 week) is feasible. Prospective analysis of
the FSR of several other circulating ECM proteins
associated with the fibrotic pathway did not reveal a
significant correlation with hepatic collagen FSR, sug-
gesting that they may not be enriched to the same
degree as lumican in the fibrotic ECM associated with
NASH or are not released to the same extent into plas-
ma. The present study also did not evaluate the utility
of plasma lumican FSR as a prognostic or therapeutic
biomarker of fibrogenesis rate in NAFLD patients.
Additional longitudinal clinical studies of this type are
therefore a priority.
If confirmed in a larger cohort, the findings pre-
sented here have potential implications for patient
management
and
disease
pathogenesis.
Elevated
remodeling of hepatic collagen in patients with
advanced fibrosis indicates that antifibrotic therapies
may be particularly effective in this patient population.
Although antifibrogenic treatments have not been
proven to slow progression or reverse disease in
NAFLD, the ability to measure fibrogenesis rates in
human subjects will be helpful in testing this hypothe-
sis, if effective antifibrogenic agents become available.
The reversibility of liver fibrosis is supported by recent
studies in HCV infection demonstrating the (slow)
resolution of hepatic fibrosis in a large percentage of
patients who achieved sustained viral response follow-
ing treatment with antiviral drugs.(26,27) Analysis of
additional cirrhosis patients is required to determine
whether observed disparities in collagen FSR are indic-
ative of distinct disease progression rates or reflect a
deceleration in collagen remodeling in a subset of
patients associated with end-stage cirrhotic disease.
An important limitation of the present study is the
small number of patients with advanced fibrotic

 disease. Although this was not unexpected, as patients
with advanced fibrotic disease comprise only a small
percentage of NAFLD diagnoses, future studies exam-
ining rate-based markers of fibrotic disease will require
additional patients with advanced disease. It is also
important to note that due to extensive posttransla-
tional modification including crosslinking of hydroxy-
lysyl amino acid residues, type 1 collagen is highly
insoluble, making LC/MS-based analysis of trypsin-
generated collagen peptides inherently difficult. Previ-
ous studies have demonstrated differences in the enzy-
matic digestibility of collagen isolated from tissues at
various stages of fibrotic disease.(28) We have also dem-
onstrated, in both healthy and fibrotic murine tissue,
that subpopulations of collagens defined by acid solu-
bility have distinct FSRs.(21) In the present study, we
employed the straightforward approach of enzymati-
cally digesting all hepatic proteins following tissue
homogenization. Our measurement of hepatic collagen
FSR therefore reflects that subset of collagen molecules
susceptible to enzymatic digestion following physical
disruption of each tissue sample. Increased hepatic col-
lagen FSR observed in patients with advanced fibrotic
disease may therefore reflect a combination of the
increased synthesis/degradation of the digestible colla-
gen pool, as well as a reduction in the digestibility of
more mature collagen fibers.
While the current study provides proof-of-concept
for the potential utility of ECM protein FSR measure-
ments in research trials, we recognize that any test
involving an in vivo stable isotope labeling procedure
in human subjects is more complex than a simple
blood draw. Many widely used procedures in clinical
medicine, however, do involve in vivo administration
of a diagnostic reagent—dye administration in radiology,
radionuclides in nuclear medicine, hormone stimulation
in endocrinology (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, adre-
nocorticotropic hormone, dexamethasone, etc.), and
oral glucose tolerance tests, to name a few. Because the
underlying MS technology advances rapidly—even a
decade ago the measurement of peptide labeling ratios
that we present here using commercially available mass
spectrometers would not have been possible—the label-
ing method described in this article is unlikely to be the
final version or iteration of a method for clinical mea-
surement of fibrogenesis rates. It may therefore be pos-
sible in the near future for a subject to ingest one or a
few doses of stable isotope label, for example, to mea-
sure ECM dynamics.
In summary, the present cross-sectional study dem-
onstrates the dynamicity of liver ECM in NAFLD
and serves to generate several testable hypotheses relat-
ing hepatic fibrogenesis rate to clinical disease progres-
sion. Definitive testing of the predictive value of liver
fibrogenesis rates for clinical progression or early
response to treatment in NAFLD, particularly when
measured by plasma lumican turnover, require addi-
tional longitudinal trials.
