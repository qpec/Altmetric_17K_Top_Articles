Bloodborne infections with Candida albicans are an increasingly recognized complication of
modern medicine. Here, we present a mouse model of low-grade candidemia to determine
the effect of disseminated infection on cerebral function and relevant immune determinants.
We show that intravenous injection of 25,000 C. albicans cells causes a highly localized
cerebritis marked by the accumulation of activated microglial and astroglial cells around yeast
aggregates, forming fungal-induced glial granulomas. Amyloid precursor protein accumulates
within the periphery of these granulomas, while cleaved amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides accu-
mulate around the yeast cells. CNS-localized C. albicans further activate the transcription
factor NF-κB and induce production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), and Aβ peptides enhance both phagocytic and antifungal activity from BV-2 cells.
Mice infected with C. albicans display mild memory impairment that resolves with fungal
clearance. Our results warrant additional studies to understand the effect of chronic cerebritis
on cognitive and immune function.

iverse environmental fungi are increasingly recognized as
causal or contributory to the majority of common
chronic, cutaneous inflammatory conditions such as
atopic
dermatitis
(eczema),
onychomycosis,
and
common
mucosal inflammatory conditions such as pharyngitis/laryngitis,
esophagitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, vaginosis, and colitis1.
Cutaneous candidal disease in the form of mucocutanous can-
didiasis assumes a much more invasive and destructive character
in the context of immunodeficiencies1,2. Fungi are further
implicated in diseases as diverse as rheumatoid arthritis3 and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)4–8.
In addition to their frequent involvement in mucosal and
cutaneous diseases, the fungi are further emerging as major
causes of invasive human diseases such as sepsis, especially in
intensive care units in the context of critical illness. Candidemia
and fully invasive candidiasis, mainly caused by Candida albicans
and related species9,10, is an especially serious concern in the
nosocomial setting where it has emerged as one of the leading
bloodstream infections in developed countries, producing high
mortality and costing >1 billion dollars annually in the United
States alone11. Diagnosis of candidemia can be difficult, as clinical
signs and symptoms are often protean and non-specific, often
presenting late in the course of infection when therapy is much
less likely to be effective12. Moreover, blood fungal cultures and
fungal-based serodiagnostic approaches lack sensitivity. Thus, a
better understanding of fungal, especially candidal, disease
pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy is emerging as an essential
medical challenge of the 21st century.
Unique inflammatory responses have evolved to combat fungi
growing along epithelial surfaces. Careful dissection of mucosal
allergic inflammatory responses has revealed that characteristic
granulocytes (eosinophils), cytokines (interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-
13), and T effector cells (T helper type 2 (Th2) cells; Th17 cells)
are potently fungicidal or at least are required for optimal fungal
clearance at mucosal sites in vivo13,14.
The rising prevalence of candidemia, often nosocomially aided
through intravascular instrumentation, but also occurring as a
consequence of mucosal colonization9, raises fundamental ques-
tions regarding the physiological effect of fungal sepsis and the
immune responses that are activated during disseminated disease.
Fungal sepsis/hematogenous dissemination specifically does not
elicit allergic responses, which instead appear to be reserved to
prevent fungal dissemination from mucosal sites, and rapidly
attenuate in favor of type 1 and type 17 immunity when dis-
semination occurs, at least in the context of hyphal fungal disease
due to Aspergillus spp.13–15. In part, such fungal-immune system
cross-talk involves two-way interactions with innate immune cells
that specifically attenuate fungal, especially Candida, virulence,
and regulate adaptive immunity16,17.
Under resting conditions, the brain receives a relatively large
fraction of the cardiac output (14%) and hence is susceptible to
invasion due to blood-borne pathogens such as Candida spp.
Candida brain infections have long been recognized as the most
common cause of mycotic cerebral abscess seen at autopsy, and
often present as delirium in the context of chronic illness18,19.
Delirium is commonly seen in ICU patients who are highly
susceptible to candidal sepsis, but aside from the tentative asso-
ciation seen between central nervous system (CNS) infection with
Candida spp. and AD4–8, the clinical presentation of metastatic
CNS infection complicating Candida sepsis is poorly understood.
Experimentally, high-grade candidemia is lethal to mice and
produces a profound cerebritis marked by dissemination of the
organism throughout the cerebral cortex and induction of type
one immunity with neutrophilia that is devoid of allergic char-
acter20. However, in many human contexts, candidemia resulting
from a variety of pathologies is likely to be low-grade, involving
periodic showering of the CNS and other organs with relatively
few organisms that may gain vascular entry from mucosal sites16.
In this study, we sought to model the effect of low-grade,
transient candidemia and Candida cerebritis on cerebral function
and further define the major immune mechanisms involved in
resolving these potentially common CNS infections. We show
that hematogenously acquired C. albicans are readily able to
penetrate the mouse blood brain barrier (BBB) and establish a
transient cerebritis that causes short-term memory impairment.
We further show that the cerebritis is characterized by a unique
pathologic structure, the fungal-induced glial granuloma, that is
marked by focal gliosis surrounding fungal cells and the deposi-
tion of both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta
peptides, that latter which promote anti-fungal immunity. These
granulomas are further accompanied by increased production of
the innate cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), and enhanced phagocytic capacity of microglial cells.
Thus, even low-grade candidemia can produce a physiologically
significant brain infection.
Results
Acute model of intracranial fungal infection. To begin to
understand the CNS effects of low-grade, transient fungemia, we
developed a mouse model of fungal cerebritis based on the model
developed by Lionakis et al.20. We developed this model using C.
albicans as this organism is one of the most common fungi iso-
lated from human blood9 and is a significant cause of human
CNS infection21. Intravenous injection of large numbers of C.
albicans (e.g., 105–106 organisms) induces considerable mortality
in mice20. To avoid this and mimic more accurately the transient
and silent fungemias that are likely to occur in humans, we
modified this model to include fewer organisms (2500–50,000
yeast cells). We discovered that a single injection of 25,000 viable
cells of C. albicans into wild-type C57BL/6 mice produced a
transient cerebral infection that was detectable 4 days post chal-
lenge, but largely cleared by day 10 (Fig. 1a, b). This degree of
infection produced no fever or hypothermia (Supplementary
Figure 1A), no obvious abnormal behavior, and no mortality. We
found no evidence pathologically or behaviorally that C. albicans
induced meningitis as a result of our intravenous challenge
protocol.
To determine where in the brain the fungi dispersed after
hematogenous administration, we performed immunofluores-
cence staining on coronal whole brain sections from infected mice
4 days post i.v. injection. We discovered multiple (~5–10/brain),
discrete, roughly spherical lesions, ~50–200 μm in diameter
occurring
in
both
cerebral
hemispheres,
but
sparing
the
cerebellum, that consisted of the central accumulation of cells
that avidly stained for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), a general
marker of polysaccharides, containing small nuclei as assessed by
DAPI (Fig. 1c–e). These lesions further consisted of the focal
aggregation of astrocytes, assessed as GFAP-expressing cells, and
microglia, assessed as IBA1-expressing cells, surrounding the
PAS-positive central cells (Fig. 1c–h). The focal astrocytosis and
microgliosis consisted of a rim of aggregated cells that did not
enter the central areas (Fig. 1f–h). Additional staining by
calcofluor white, which binds specifically to the fungal cell wall
polysaccharide chitin22, confirmed that at the center of these
lesions were numerous yeast cells (Fig. 1i).
In contrast to the more diffuse, disseminated CNS lesions that
result with high-grade C. albicans challenges20, these subclinical
fungal infections induced significant recruitment of cerebral
monocytes, but not neutrophils as demonstrated by flow
cytometry20 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We further did not observe
the conversion of C. albicans yeasts into hyphal forms, a marker

Candida
cerebritis,

or
lymphocytes outside the areas of gliosis (Fig. 1d and data not
shown)20. Together, these observations describe a new type of
CNS lesion arising in the context of subclinical fungal infections
in which the organism is tightly contained in areas of gliosis. We
term this novel type of focal inflammatory process due to CNS
fungi a fungal-induced glial granuloma (FIGG).
FIGGs are linked to activated microglia and innate cytokines.
We conducted additional studies to understand the cellular and
biochemical inflammatory accompaniments of FIGGs. We first
compared IBA-1 stained coronal sections of brains from mice
injected with fungi or sham. Within FIGGs, we observed hyper-
trophic microglia that stained brightly for IBA-1 (IBA-1high),
indicative of microglial activation and proliferation24,25, as
compared to brain from sham-infected mice (Supplementary
Fig. 2). IBA-1high cells were not found in any brain sections of
control mice (data not shown). Enumeration of all and IBA-1high
microglia from coronal sections of different brain regions
revealed increased numbers of both total and especially activated
microglia, consistent with prior findings of microgliosis in asso-
ciation with brain inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 2)24.
The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which
comprises a small family of functionally distinct transcription
factors, is commonly activated in immune contexts, including
during fungal infections where it is required to activate effective
anti-fungal immunity26. We assessed induction of both NF-κB
messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein (p65 subunit) in total
mRNA and protein extracted from brain between 4 and 14 days
following i.v. challenge with 25,000 C. albicans cells (Fig. 2a–c).
Relative to naive brains, we found that NF-κB p65 expression was
significantly elevated at both RNA and protein levels at all
timepoints examined, with the highest levels seen at day 14,
several days past the point at which infection was no longer
detectable (Fig. 1b). These findings were confirmed by demon-
strating the downregulation of the inhibitory NF-κB subunit IκBα
under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Among
many
genes
induced
by
NF-κB
are
the
pro-
inflammatory innate immune cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF27.
These cytokines were profoundly induced in the brains of mice at
most or all times examined after fungal challenge through day 14,
well after the point at which fungi could no longer be cultured

 from brains (Figs. 2d–f; 1b). Microglia are known to produce
these cytokines in the context of other CNS inflammatory
diseases such as AD28,29. We hypothesized that microglia
inducibly secrete IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF in response to C. albicans.
To test this, we utilized the immortalized murine microglial cell
line BV-2. Co-culturing BV-2 cells (1 × 105/ml) with 200 viable
cells of C. albicans led to significantly enhanced secretion of IL-
1β, IL-6, and TNF as compared to control-treated cells (Fig. 2g).
Of note, neither whole C. albicans lysate antigen equal to 200
viable cells nor irradiated C. albicans induced any cytokine

 secretion, whereas purified secreted aspartic proteinases (SAPs)
stimulated the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines as
previously described in a manner that required intact proteinase
activity30,31 (Fig. 2h). Thus, microglial cells upregulate the
production of the type 1 cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF in the
presence of viable fungal cells, possibly via SAPs.
APP is upregulated in FIGGs during C. albicans cerebritis. One
of the hallmarks of chronic brain inflammation and degeneration
(e.g., AD) is the presence of parenchymal plaques composed of
amyloid β (Aβ) peptides that are cleaved from APP32. Studies
have suggested that β-amyloid peptides possess anti-microbial
activity33,34, especially against C. albicans. We sought to deter-
mine if in the context of C. albicans cerebritis brain cells increase
production of APP. To address this, we first performed quanti-
tative PCR on total RNA extracted from brains of mice at dif-
ferent days post infection with C. albicans (Fig. 3a). Relative to
control brains, we found significantly higher expression of APP
mRNA at all timepoints examined after infection out to 10 days.
We also measured APP by western blot from the same brains
and confirmed a progressive, more than threefold increase in
APP production by day 14 following infection with C. albicans
(Fig. 3b, c).
To determine where in the brain enhanced production of APP
was occurring, we performed fluorescent immunohistochemistry
for APP on sections of brain from wild-type mice 4 days after
infection with C. albicans using an antibody that only recognizes
APP and not Aβ. Although APP is widely expressed in brains, we
found that enhanced accumulation of APP following C. albicans
challenge
occurred
almost exclusively
around FIGGs,
and
primarily within the areas of gliosis (Fig. 3d), observations that
were confirmed through additional side-by-side staining of
comparable FIGGs from app–/– mice, in which no APP signal
was detected (Fig. 3e). These results demonstrate that APP is
upregulated in the brain and accumulates around FIGGs in areas
of gliosis, but sparing the central areas that contain the fungi,
during acute C. albicans cerebritis. Of note, the general
appearance of FIGGs did not differ between wild-type and
app–/– mice.
Aβ physically associates with C. albicans within FIGGs. We
next addressed whether cleaved amyloid β peptides localize
similarly to APP using a peptide-specific antibody. Surprisingly,
we found that in contrast to the distribution of APP, amyloid
β peptides were concentrated in the center of the FIGGs, pre-
sumably in direct contact with the fungal cells (Fig. 4a). To again
validate the specificity of the antibody against amyloid β peptides,
we also carried out side-by-side control staining for amyloid
β peptides in brain sections from infected app–/– mice and again
no signal was observed (Fig. 4b). We further determined by
ELISA that soluble amyloid β peptides are persistently elevated in
mouse brains well past fungal challenge and clearance (Fig. 4c, d).
Of note, insoluble amyloid β aggregation was not observed via
thioflavin S staining in this acute infectious model (data not
shown).
APP is cleaved endogenously to yield amyloid β peptides by the
peptidases β secretase (BACE-1) and presenilin 1 (PS1)35,36. To
further support the molecular link between amyloid β peptides
and C. albicans cerebritis, we measured β and γ secretase levels
from mouse brain homogenates and observed a significant
increase in the protein levels of BACE-1 and PS1, which is a
subunit of γ secretase (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, in contrast to
APP, which localized only to areas of gliosis, amyloid β peptides
localized to fungal cells exclusively within the center of FIGGs
through a C. albicans-dependent mechanism that involves the
induction of β and γ secretases.
Aβ promotes anti-fungal immunity by stimulating BV-2 cells.
Previous studies have shown that Aβ peptides interact physically
with C. albicans in vitro and may be directly fungistatic33,34,37.
We first attempted to verify that Aβ peptides possess anti-fungal
activity in vivo. 5xFAD mice that overexpress human APP in the
cerebrum and app−/− mice were challenged i.v. with 25,000
viable cells of C. albicans and brains were removed at different
days post challenge for fungal recovery. We found that clearance
of C. albicans at days 4 and 7 from mouse brain was strongly
impaired by the lack of APP, but conversely was markedly
enhanced in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 5a). Nonetheless, all mice in this
experiment achieved brain sterility by day 10 (Fig. 5a). app−/−
mice further developed significant hypothermia, a sign of over-
whelming infection, while demonstrating significantly impaired
secretion of pro-inflammatory brain cytokines at days 4 and 7
(Supplementary Fig. 5B). These results indicate that APP or Aβ
peptides promote anti-fungal immunity at early timepoints after
infection.
We next utilized an in vitro fungistasis assay38 to determine if
Aβ peptides possess anti-fungal (either fungicidal or fungistatic)
activity (Fig. 5b). This assay involves the microscopic enumera-
tion of growing C. albicans colonies in response to Aβ peptides,
with or without addition of BV-2 cells in comparison to control
conditions. In keeping with prior studies34, we initially incubated
C. albicans with 50 μg/ml of mouse amyloid β peptides or
scrambled control peptide to determine if Aβ peptides were
directly fungistatic. In contrast to prior observations33,34, we
found no inhibition of C. albicans growth under these assay
conditions (Fig. 5c).
We next modified the fungistasis assay by adding BV-2 cells
that had been pre-stimulated with and Aβ peptides or control to
determine if Aβ peptides can indirectly induce fungistasis through
bystander cells. We found that at concentrations of 1 μM (4 μg/
ml), both Aβ 1–40 and 1–42, but not scrambled peptide,
aggregated tightly around yeast cells as previously described34,37.
More importantly, both Aβ1–40 and 1–42, but not scrambled
peptide, significantly stimulated fungistasis when pre-incubated

 with BV-2 cells prior to the addition of yeast cells to the assay
(Fig. 5d). Of note, human Aβ peptides induced similar fungistatic
activity in BV-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6A).
To further define the mechanisms by which APP-derived
peptides induce fungistasis, we first performed a supernatant
transfer experiment in which BV-2 supernatants were collected
after pre-stimulation with Aβ peptides and transferred to
monocultures of C. albicans (Fig. 5e). We discovered that the
Aβ peptide-stimulated, BV-2 cell-free supernatant was sufficient
to induce significant fungistasis as compared to scrambled
peptide in a manner that differed marginally from cultures
having BV-2 cells present (Fig. 5d, e). These data demonstrate
that whereas Aβ peptides fail to exhibit direct anti-fungal activity,
they do stimulate BV-2 cells to secrete one or more soluble anti-
fungal factor.
We confirmed this stimulatory effect of Aβ peptides on
microglia by pre-incubating BV-2 cells with Aβ peptides and then
washing them to remove unbound peptides before addition of C.
albicans. We observed a similar fungistatic effect from these
primed BV-2 cells, further supporting the ability of Aβ peptides
to activate microglia to an enhanced anti-fungal state.
Aβ peptides enhance phagocytic activity of BV-2 cells. Another
potential mechanism by which BV-2 cells might inhibit fungi is
through phagocytosis and intracellular killing39. To explore this

 possibility, we co-cultured BV-2 cells pre-stimulated with Aβ or
scrambled peptide with fluorescent (mNeonGreen-expressing) C.
albicans cells and determined the number of mNeonGreen
+/CD11b+cells as a means of determining cell-yeast interactions.
We found that cell-yeast interactions occurred in 21.9 ± 3.0% of
control peptide-stimulated BV-2 cells, but that Aβ peptides sti-
mulated significantly more such interactions (37.2 ± 2.8% and
41.0 ± 3.2%, Aβ40 versus Aβ42, respectively, p < 0.05, Fig. 6a, b).
To further characterize these events, we customized a gating
strategy to orthogonally compare yeast-BV-2 cell interactions as a
means of determining true yeast uptake by phagocytosis (pro-
ducing overlapping images) from mere cell surface association
(producing non-overlapping images) (Fig. 6c). This analysis
confirmed that both Aβ peptides significantly enhanced phago-
cytosis of C. albicans as compared to control-treated cells
(scrambled peptide: 14.0 ± 2.0% overlap; Aβ 40 peptide: 25.0 ±
2.1% overlap; Aβ 42 peptide: 25.7 ± 2.4% overlap, p < 0.01;
Fig. 6d).
Finally, we confirmed that phagocytically active (CD68+40)
microglial cells cluster densely at the center of FIGGs, in the
immediate vicinity of the yeast clusters (Fig. 6e). Together, these
findings indicate that in addition to enhancing secretion of
soluble anti-fungal factors, Aβ peptides also promote the direct
phagocytic uptake and intracellular killing of yeast cells by
microglia.
Dectin-1 promotes microglial phagocytosis of C. albicans.
Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are recently described,
highly activated microglial cells that surround inflammatory
lesions in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders41,42. Among
many inflammatory markers, DAMs express Dectin-1/Clec7A, a
pattern recognition receptor expressed by phagocytic cells that
recognizes fungal β-glucan43. We confirmed that Dectin-1 is
highly expressed on DAMs of FIGGs (Fig. 7a). To demonstrate if
Dectin-1 is required for the Aβ peptide-enhanced phagocytosis by
microglia, we assessed by flow cytometry the uptake of fluor-
escent C. albicans with and without addition of a blocking anti-
Dectin-1 antibody. We found that Dectin-1 blockade inhibited by
up to 50% the phagocytoic uptake of mNeonGreen+ yeast cells
both at rest and after stimulation by Aβ 1–42 peptide (Fig. 7b–d).
Thus, Dectin-1 expression is enhanced on DAMs associated with
FIGGs and enhances the phagocytic uptake of C. albicans by
microglial cells.

 Low-grade fungal cerebritis transiently impairs memory. We
carried out well-established tests of rodent behavior using naive
and C. albicans-infected wild-type mice to determine if sub-
standard performance in any of these assays could be correlated
with fungal cerebritis. We first conducted open-field tests to
quantify the degree of locomotor activity and anxiety potentially
related to fungal infection that could spuriously influence sub-
sequent behavior tests. (Fig. 8a–e). No significant differences were
found in any of the five indices, suggested that mice were not
experiencing severe stress following infection with C. albicans and
are consistent with our empiric observation that mice were
grossly normal following fungal infection.
We next performed T-maze spontaneous alternation tests in
sham and C. albicans-infected mice. Compared to sham, C.
albicans-infected mice made significantly fewer alternations, and
recovered as the infection cleared by day 10 (Fig. 8f). This result
demonstrated that intracranial infection induces impaired work-
ing spatial memory. However, no difference in contextual fear
conditioning, a form of associative learning and memory, was
observed (Fig. 8g). Thus, acute, low-grade C. albicans cerebritis
induces a transient, mild working memory deficit that is
reversible with clearance of the infection.
Discussion
Although recognized as an increasingly common medical pro-
blem, the long-term health effects of transient candidemia are
almost completely unknown. High-grade candidemia is rapidly
lethal to both humans and mice10,20,44. Here, however, we sought
to understand how low-grade candidal sepsis affects a critical

 target organ, the brain. We discovered that the intravenous
injection of 25,000 viable C. albicans cells is surprisingly well
tolerated in young, healthy mice, producing no gross abnormal-
ities either acutely or chronically. However, a brain parenchymal
infection is clearly established, albeit transiently, involving the
cerebral cortices exclusive of the cerebella and meninges. Such
infection further induces a robust innate immune response
characterized by focal gliosis and monocytosis devoid of neu-
trophils or lymphocytes and marked by the production of the
innate cytokines IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6, and the enhanced
expression of multiple microglial activation markers that enhance
phagocytic function. Such innate inflammation is ultimately
successful in resolving the cerebritis, but we detected a transient
decline in cerebral function that was likely due to the direct effects
of the fungi and the sterilizing inflammation directed against
them. These findings expand our knowledge of the CNS effects of
transient candidemia and have important implications for
understanding the potentially broader role of fungi in CNS
disease.
Our findings demonstrate that the CNS and systemic immune
and physiologic responses to low-grade candidemia (25,000 yeast
cells) differ substantially from high-grade exposures (>250,000
yeast cells). Whereas high-grade candidemia was rapidly and
completely fatal and accompanied by massive cytokine release in
the context of CNS neutrophilia and monocytosis, low-grade
disease yielded no mortality or neutrophilia. Perhaps most
strikingly, rather than diffuse CNS spread of the organism
through the brain cortices as was seen in high-grade disease, low-
grade candidemia yielded a strikingly focal CNS infection in
which numerous organisms were collected in a unique neuro-
pathologic structure that we term FIGGs. The size and spherical
structure of FIGGs containing geographically distinct layers of
inflammatory cells with the pathogen centrally located is highly
reminiscent of more typical granulomas containing histiocytes

 and lymphocytes that have long been known to form around
fungi and other organisms in non-neuronal tissues45.
The CNS is uniquely protected from toxic and microbial
challenges by the BBB, hence it is surprising that hematogenously
acquired C. albicans could readily pass the BBB to proliferate in
the brain parenchyma of our mice46. The BBB is capable of
halting the spread of some bacteria and many viruses to the CNS,
but the unique ability of yeast cells to penetrate endothelia in vivo
and in vitro47, perhaps through elaboration of unique virulence
factors
such
as
proteinases
and
lytic
peptides
such
as
candidalysin31,48, suggests that the main defense of the CNS
against blood-borne fungal, especially candidal, invasion is
immunologic, not physical. Additional studies are required to
understand the microbial receptors and fungal virulence factors
that coordinate such effective protection.
In addition to efficiently sterilizing the brain following low-
grade Candida infection, the innate immune response elicited
appears to also attenuate the pathogenicity of the organism.

potential as marked by extension of pseudohyphae and full
hyphal transformation as was seen in overwhelming CNS
disease16,20. As we observed only yeast forms with no evidence of
hyphae in the brains of our mice, we presume that the immune
response to the Candida, likely including phagocytic immune
cells such as microglia, precluded or reversed such pathologic
transformation49.
As histiocytic granulomas are required for optimal eradication
of pathogens in the periphery45, we presume that FIGGs are
similarly essential to the rapid clearance of C. albicans from the
CNS in our model. This is supported by our demonstration for
the first time that microglia are inducibly activated into a fun-
gicidal/fungistatic state as demonstrated by two processes,
secretion of anti-fungal substances and enhanced phagocytosis.
Another unique aspect of FIGGs is the geographic separation of
the parent protein APP, confined to the FIGG periphery, and Aβ
peptides, located centrally and physically associating with the
fungi. Our data support the possibility that APP is cleaved
through the activity of β and γ secretases, but also raise the
intriguing possibility that APP could also be cleaved by secreted
fungal proteinases. Although we could not confirm that Aβ

 peptides are directly candidacidal33,34,37, we have demonstrated
that these peptides enhance microglial activity generally and anti-
fungal activity specifically. Future studies are required to under-
stand the microglial receptors for Aβ peptides that mediate these
responses and whether Aβ peptides induce similar anti-microbial
responses from other cell types.
In addition to expressing Aβ peptides centrally and being
comprised in part of highly activated DAMs that express CD68
and Dectin-1, FIGGs are further characterized by the presence of
chitin centrally, demonstrating the presence of yeast cell aggre-
gates. Remarkably, these are all features shared in common with
senile plaques of AD50,51. Chitotriosidase, a mammalian enzyme
that degrades chitin, which is not made by mammals, was also
found to be upregulated in brains of AD patients52 and may be a
useful biomarker for AD53.
Moreover, fungi and fungal components have also been
detected in the peripheral blood4,8 and cerebrospinal fluid5,53 of
AD patients. More extensive analysis specifically revealed the
presence of C. albicans and other fungal species in the brains of
AD patients, but not in healthy control brains4,6,7. Allergic
asthma, which we have linked to airway mycosis, a form of
superficial fungal infection of the airway mucosa54, is epidemio-
logically linked to later onset dementia55. Our mice further
developed memory deficits, another hallmark of AD, albeit a
transient form that resolved with fungal clearance. AD is also
associated with neuroinflammation marked by expression of NF-
κB, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF precisely as we observed29.
Regardless of any possible link to AD, we have shown that
transient fungemia in healthy mice has important physiological
consequences,
including
alterations
in
working
memory.
Although transient after a single episode, it is conceivable that
intermittent fungal showering of the vascular space and attendant
low-grade fungal cerebritis that occurs over timeframes of years
could eventually lead to permanent brain damage and lasting
cognitive defects. More importantly, our findings suggest that
resolution of low-grade CNS fungal infections through the use of
antifungals and other means might preclude or even reverse
attendant cognitive decline.
For long-term fungal bloodstream showering to occur, how-
ever, a peripheral site of chronic infection is also required.
C. albicans and other Candida species comprise the normal
microbial flora and such commensal organisms are unlikely to
disseminate
hematogenously56.
However,
multiple
common
medical practices conspire to alter the normal fungal microbiome
or the immune system, leading to pathological enlargement of the
human fungal biomass, often at mucosal sites. Such practices
include the overuse of antibiotics, corticosteroids, hygiene pro-
ducts that disrupt potentially protective mucosal biofilms, and
proton pump inhibitors that neutralize candidacidal stomach
acid16,57. Consequently, the esophagus and more distal gastro-
intestinal tract may become highly colonized with Candida spp., a
pathological condition that leads to systemic spread of the
fungi16,58,59 that in some cases leads to symptomatic fungal
infections of the lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys58,59. Our studies

 have shown that the CNS is also readily infected during low-grade
candidemia, with important acute histologic and physiologic
consequences.
The physiologic impact of chronic systemic fungal dissemina-
tion is not known, but the general importance of chronic organ
inflammation due to unresolved infections and particulate, e.g.,
nanoparticulate carbon black derived from cigarette smoke60,
exposures is chronic inflammation and organ destruction that can
be fatal if not checked. Thus, although a single low-grade chal-
lenge with C. albicans is quickly resolved and results in only
transient physiologic derangement as shown here, the broader
concern with chronic fungemia is diffuse end-organ injury, which
in the CNS could include substantial neuronal loss and long-term,
progressive cognitive impairment. Our findings thus support the
creation of in vivo models that permit dissecting the impact of
chronic candidemia on CNS integrity and function. Such models
are likely to improve our understanding of chronic neurodegen-
erative conditions such as AD.
Methods
Mice. Eight-week-old C57BL/6J male and female mice (wild-type, 5xFAD and
homozygous App−/− mice) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All mice
were bred and housed at the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care-accredited vivarium at Baylor College of Medicine under specific-
pathogen-free conditions. All experimental protocols were approved by the Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine, and
followed federal guidelines.
Sabouraud’s agar plates and broth. Sabouraud’s agar or Sabouraud’s broth (BD,
Sparks, 21152) was dissolved in water at 50 g/l, and autoclaved (liquid, 30 min).
Chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 63103) was added to the solution at
50 mg/l. Sabouraud’s broth was ready then, and the agar solution was sterilely
poured onto Petri dishes (VWR, Radnor, 19087) and cooled overnight. Plates were
sealed and kept at 4 °C for further experiments.
Fungal isolation and maintenance. Wild-type C. albicans was isolated from air-
way secretions of an asthma patient as described61 and propagated on Sabouraud’s
agar plates. Mucoid colonies of C. albicans were harvested after growing to 10 mm
diameter, and populated in Sabouraud’s broth at 37 °C for 4 days. Cells were
collected and dispersed in pyrogen-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Corning
cellgro, Mediatech, Manassus, VA) passed through 40 μm nylon mesh, and washed
twice with PBS by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Fungal cells were then
suspended in PBS and aliquots frozen in liquid nitrogen at 5 × 107/ml. Viability
after freezing (>95%) was confirmed by comparing hemacytometer-derived cell
counts to CFU as determined by plating serial dilutions on Sabouraud’s agar.
Fungal identity was determined by standard morphology (Microcheck, Northfield,
VT) as describe previously14. Thawed, >95% viable cells were washed once,
counted, and suspended in normal saline at indicated concentrations for intrave-
nous injection.
Construction of fluorescent Candida albicans. The pENO1-NEON-NATR plas-
mid contains a codon-optimized version of the NEON gene under the control of
the constitutive ENO1 promoter and with a nourseothricin resistance marker
(NATR). Codon-optimized NEON (GenScrip Piscataway62, NJ) was cloned into
pENO1-dTomato63 using NcoI and PacI, replacing the dTomato gene. The
pENO1-NEON-NATR plasmid was NotI-linearized within the ENO1 segment
before transfection into C. albicans strain SC5314.
Intravenous injection. Viable cells of C. albicans in 100 μl normal saline were
injected through the tail veil using a tuberculin syringe and 27-gauge needle. Mice
are then returned to clean cages, and monitored carefully until resuming normal
grooming.
Brain dissemination assay. Mice were euthanized with pentobarbital (Beutha-
nasia, Intervet Inc., Madison, NJ) and exsanguinated by transecting the descending
aorta followed by perfusing the brain with normal saline. Brains were removed by
sterilely removing the calvarium, weighed, and were put into 1 ml of sterile PBS.
Brains were then homogenized, and spread directly onto Sabouraud’s agar (one
sample per plate). Plates were sealed with Parafilm (Pechiney Plastic Packaging,
Chicago, IL) and incubated at 37 °C for a maximum of 10 days. CFU were
enumerated and species confirmed as described above.
Histology and immunostaining. Mice were perfused with 4% PFA, and the brains
were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C followed by cryoprotection in 40%
sucrose. Coronal sections of 30 μm were cut with a microtome and stored in a
cryoprotectant at −20 °C. For each experiment, sections were collected randomly
from at least three animals. Sections were mounted onto slides and were extensively
washed in PBS, blocked with PBST containing 3% BSA and 2% donkey serum for
30 min, and then incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution
overnight at 4 °C (anti-GFAP (1:1000, Millipore, catalog #MAB3402), anti-Iba1
(1:500, Wako, catalog #019-19741), anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore, Mab 377), anti-
APP (1:250, Abcam, ab32136), anti-Aβ (1:250, Abcam, ab2539), anti-dectin-1
(1:100, Invivogen, #mabg-mdect), anti-CD68 (1:250, Biolegend, catalog #137001)).
After washing, sections or coverslips were incubated in secondary antibody for 1 h
at room temperature and mounted in DAPI solution after final washing.
Calcofluor white stain. Thirty micrometers of sections of brain on slides were
treated with one drop of calcofluor white stain (18909, Sigma-Aldrich) and one
drop of 10% potassium hydroxide for 1 min. The slide is then examined under
ultraviolet light.
Imaging. Fluorescent immunostained brain sections were first imaged using the
EVOS FL Auto system to locate sites of infection, and then were imaged using a
Leica laser confocal microscope.
Enumeration of brain microglia. Immunostained coronal brain sections (30 μm)
were fixed on slides and stained for IBA-1. Using a low-image threshold setting,
total IBA-1-positive cells were first counted, after which IBA-1high cells were
counted after raising the image acquisition threshold beyond which IBA-1low cells
were no longer visible (ImageJ, ver. 1.51J8).
Leukocyte isolation and single-cell suspension from brain. Control and infected
mice were euthanized 4 days post infection. Mice were anesthetized using pento-
barbital (Beuthanasia, Intervet Inc.), perfused with normal saline and brains were
collected in 3 ml of HBSS (Gendepot, Barker, TX) containing 20% FBS, and
homogenized using the plunger portion of a 5 ml syringe in six-well flat bottom
plates. The homogenate was then transferred to a 15 ml tube and added 1.25 ml of
90% Percoll (GE Healthcare) in PBS. Then, the suspension was underlaid with 3 ml
of 70% Percoll and centrifuged at 2450 r.p.m. (1200 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The
leukocytes at the interphase were collected, washed with HBSS, and passed through
a 40 μm filter20.
Cytokine measurement. Following pentobarbital euthanasia, mice were perfused
of blood as above. Brains were then harvested and deaggregated by pressing gently
through 40 μm cell strainers in 3 ml of DMEM medium. The homogenate was then
centrifuged (1400 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were collected. IL-1β, IL-6,
TNF, and amyloid β protein levels were detected using standard ELISA after
comparison to recombinant standard (cytokines: ab210895, ab213749, and
ab212073, Abcam, Cambridge, MA; amyloid β64: capture antibody: #800701,
detection antibody: #805504 or #805404, 1:100, Biolegend, San Diego, CA).
BV-2 fungus co-culture for ELISA. BV-2 cells were originally obtained from
ATCC and maintained frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed, expanded in
DMEM medium, and expression of standard microglial surface markers (TREM2,
CD68, and MCM5 by real-time quantitative PCR) was confirmed. Cells were then
seeded in 1 ml of DMEM (serum-free, Gendepot) in 24-well plates at 100,000 cells
per well for 6 h. Live, irradiated C. albicans (200 cells/ml), C. albicans lysate
(equivalent to 200 cells/ml), SAPs (1 μM), or protease activitity-inhibited SAPs
were then added to each well and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were
then collected for ELISA as described above.
Preparation of C. albicans lysates. C. albicans was cultured in suspension in
liquid Sabouraud’s broth (100 cc), enumerated by hemacytometer and collected by
centrifugation. A planetary ball mill grinder (PM100, Retsch, Hann, Germany) was
used to lyse the cells54. Briefly, pelleted fungal cells were resuspended in 30 ml by
cold PBS, decanted into cold, sterile canisters and an equal volume of zirconium
grinding beads, and centrifuged (550 r.p.m., 5 min, 3 cycles). The canisters were
cooled on ice between each cycle for 5 min, the samples were removed, and cen-
trifuged at 4000 r.p.m. (3700 × g), 30 min, 4 °C in a separate centrifuge. The
supernatants were transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again
(8500 r.p.m./6800 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), from which the supernatants were passed
through 0.22 μm sterilizing filters, adjusted to a protein concentration of 6 mg/ml
and distributed in 0.5 ml aliquots in sterile, 1 ml tubes for storage at −80 °C.
Preparation of irradiated C. albicans. C. albicans was cultured in suspension in
liquid Sabouraud’s broth (100 cc), enumerated by hemacytometer and collected by
centrifugation. Cells were then irradiated using a 137Cs irradiator (3000 rad,
Gamma Cell 40, MSD Nordion, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Inactivation of
C. albicans was confirmed by absent growth on Sabouraud’s agar plate.

 Isolation of secreted aspartic proteinases. SAPs were isolated as previously
described65,66. Briefly, C. albicans was grown in YPD broth (BD, Sparks, 21152) for
24 h at 26 °C. Cells were removed by centrifugation (8500 r.p.m./6800 × g, 5 min,
4 °C) and the supernatants containing SAPs were concentrated 25 times in a Pierce
Protein Concentrator (10 kDA MWCO, #88535, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal-
tham, MA). Concentrated SAPs were then purified by passage through a Pierce
Strong Anion Exchange Spin Column (#90011, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA). 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.0) was used for column binding and 2 M Tris/HCl
(pH 6.0) was used for elution. SAPs were then concentrated again as described
above. SAP concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).
Inhibition of secreted aspartic proteinase. SAPs were incubated with halt pro-
tease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (#78442, Thermo Fisher Scientific) over-
night. SAPs were then washed using 25 mM Tris/HCl (pH6.0) and concentrated as
stated above three times to remove excessive inhibitors before applying to BV-2
cells. Absence of proteinase activity was confirmed by Coomassie Blue proteinase
assay65,66.
Western blot and quantitative PCR. Mice were euthanized and brains perfused
and removed as above, after which they were either lysed using 1 ml of protein lysis
buffer (50 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 2% Triton-X 100, 10% glycerol,
with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor) to extract total protein or 1 ml of
TRIZol solution to extract RNA. NF-κB, Ikb-α, APP, beta secretase 1 (BACE-1),
and presenilin 1 (PS1) levels were detected using western blot (4–12% Nupage Bis-
Tris gel, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using standard technique (antibody: #8242S,
#9242S, 1:1000, Cell signaling, Danvers, MA; ab 32136, 1:5000, Abcam; ab 2077,
1:1000, Abcam; MAB 5232, 1:1000, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA). Uncropped
western blots in main figures are shown in Supplementary Figure 7. Relative
expression of mRNA for APP was detected by two-step, real-time quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with the ABI Perkin Elmer Prism 5700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Taqman
probe (Mm00476361, Mm01344172, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
In vitro fungistasis test using Aβ peptides. Two hundred viable cells of
C. albicans were cultured in 24-well flat tissue culture plates containing 1 ml of
serum-free DMEM in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. Fungal germination events
(FGEs) were counted after 16 h.
In vitro fungistasis assay. BV-2 cells were cultured in 24-well flat tissue culture
plates at 12,000 cells per well for 6 h with stimulation by 1 μM Aβ peptides or
scrambled peptide control (mouse Aβ: A-1007-1, A-1008-1, A-1004-1; human Aβ:
A-1156-1, A-1166-1. rPeptide, Wadkinsville, GA33). C. albicans were added to each
well at 200 viable cells per well in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. FGEs were counted
after 16 h. Percent of fungal growth inhibition was calculated as the (# FGE in wells
containing no cells − # FGE in wells containing cells/# FGE in wells containing no
cells) × 100%. Cell-free supernatants from wells under these conditions were also
transferred into new 24-well plates and 200 viable cells of C. albicans were added to
each well and incubated for another 16 h. FGEs were counted and % FGE inhi-
bition was calculated as above. In some experiments, BV-2 cells were first primed
with 1 μM Aβ peptides or scrambled peptide control overnight in 24-well flat tissue
culture plates at 12,000 cells per well. Cells were washed with fresh medium three
times to remove Aβ peptides before adding C. albicans.
Phagocytosis assay using BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were plated at 1 × 106/ml and
stimulated with 1 μM Aβ peptides or scrambled peptide control for 6 h after which
C. albicans (mNeonGreen) were added at 1 × 106/ml. BV-2 cells were co-cultured
with C. albicans for 2.5 h in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator, and washed with fresh
medium three times. BV-2 cells were then collected using a cell scraper and stained
with APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70, Biolegend). After three
washes with PBS, cells were analyzed using ImageStreamX MKII (Millipore Sigma).
CD11b/mNeonGreen double-positive cells were masked and imaged orthogonally
to characterize fungal-BV-2 cell interactions as representing surface binding alone
or true phagocytosis. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0.7;
Treestar, Ashland, OR).
Flow cytometry analyses. Single-cell suspensions from brain were incubated at
4 °C for 30 min with APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse Ly6C (RB6-8C5, BD
Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70,
eBioscience, San Diego, CA). BV-2 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with PE-
Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70, Biolegend). After three washes with
PBS, flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII (BD Biosciences) and data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0.7; Treestar).
Behavior tests. Twenty-five thousand CFU or equivalent numbers of heat-
inactivated cells of C. albicans were injected intravenously after which behavior
tests were conducted 3 and 10 days later using different groups of mice. Open-field
test, T-maze spontaneous alternation, and contextual fear conditioning was carried
out in order to minimize the effect of stress as previously described67.
Open-field test. Mice were placed in an open arena (40 × 40 × 20 cm) and allowed
to explore freely for 10 min while their position was continually monitored using
tracking software (AnyMaze). Tracking allowed for measurement of distance tra-
veled, speed, and position in the arena throughout the task. Time spent in the
center of the arena, defined as the interior 20 × 20 cm, was then recorded67.
T-maze spontaneous alternation task. The apparatus was a black wooden T-
maze with walls 25 cm high and each arm was 30 cm long and 9 cm wide. A
removable central partition was used during the sample phase but not the test
phase of each trial. Vertical sliding doors were positioned at the entrance to each
goal arm. At the beginning of the sample phase, both doors were raised, and the
mouse was placed at the end of the start arm facing away from the goal arms. Each
mouse was allowed to make a free choice between the two goal arms; after its tail
had cleared the door of the chosen arm, the door was closed, and the mouse was
allowed to explore the arm for 30 s. The mouse was then returned to the end of the
start arm, with the central partition removed and both guillotine doors raised,
signaling the beginning of the test phase. Again, the mouse was allowed to make a
free choice between the two goal arms. This sequence (trial) was repeated 10 times
per day for 2 days. The percentage of alternation was averaged over the 2 days.
Trials that were not completed within 90 s were terminated and disregarded during
analysis67.
Contextual fear conditioning test. Mice were first handled for 5 min for 3 days.
On the training day, after 2 min in the conditioning chamber, mice received two
pairings of a tone (2,800 Hz, 85 dB, 30 s) with a co-terminating foot shock (0.7 mA,
2 s), after which they remained in the chamber for an additional minute and were
then returned to their cages. At 24 h after training, mice were tested for freezing
(immobility except for respiration) in response to the training context (training
chamber). Freezing behavior was hand-scored at 5-s intervals by an observer blind
to the genotype. The percentage of time spent freezing was taken as an index of
learning and memory67.
Statistical analyses. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of the means. Significant
differences relative to PBS-challenged mice or appropriate controls are expressed
by p values of <0.05, as measured by two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way analysis
of variance followed by Dunnett’s test or Tukey’s test for multiple comparison.
Data normality was confirmed using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
