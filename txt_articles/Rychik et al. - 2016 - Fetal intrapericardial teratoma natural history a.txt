BACKGROUND: Intrapericardial teratoma is a rare, lethal tumor often
detected in fetal life. Tumor mass and pericardial effusion cause cardiac
tamponade that, if relieved, could be life-saving. Optimal timing of inter-
vention and methods for effective fetal treatment are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We describe our single-center experience with fetal
intrapericardial teratoma including the first report of successful in utero
surgical resection with survival to term.
STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our database for suspected fetal
intrapericardial teratoma. On fetal ultrasound and echocardiography tumor
size was estimated by calculation of an ellipse and analyzed in relation to
Doppler-derived fetal cardiac output, venous flow patterns, hydrops, and
outcome.
RESULTS: Eight fetuses with suspected intrapericardial teratoma were
seen from 2009 through 2015. Gestational age at initial presentation
ranged from 21-34 (median 26) weeks. Two cases mimicked the
appearance of intrapericardial teratoma, but had no serial change in
cardiac output over time and were ultimately determined to be other types
of tumor. In 6 cases of true intrapericardial teratoma, tumor growth was
extremely rapid and associated with progressive decline in cardiac output
(to <400 mL/kg/min) manifesting in hydrops and death if left untreated.
One case was treated successfully at 31 weeks through ex utero intra-
partum delivery with tumor resection while on placental support. Another
case underwent open fetal surgery and resection at 24 weeks, with
resumption of gestation until delivery at 37 weeks with excellent outcome.
CONCLUSION: Fetal intrapericardial teratoma can be successfully
managed utilizing serial surveillance and by treatment in a timely manner
prior to the predictable onset of hydrops, determined through increasing
tumor size and a declining cardiac output. Surgical resection in utero is
possible, with good results.
Key words: fetal echocardiography, fetal surgery, intrapericardial

Introduction
Teratoma arising from the pericardium
is an extremely rare tumor composed of
endodermal, mesodermal, and ecto-
dermal germinal cell lines.1 Treatment is
readily achieved through surgical resec-
tion with low incidence of recurrence.2,3
However, when intrapericardial tera-
toma is detected in fetal life, mortality is
high. Tumor size can be large and asso-
ciated with pericardial effusion, the
combination of which leads to progres-
sive constraint of filling, cardiac tampo-
nade, fetal hydrops, and death.4
Treatment of fetal intrapericardial
teratoma before birth is a challenge. To
date, management most often includes
observation with temporizing measures
of
pericardial
fluid
drainage5,6
or
delivery, once the fetus reaches a viable
gestational age for postnatal surgical
resection.7-9
Prenatal
resection,
if
possible, would be an ideal means of
treatment. Open fetal surgery for resec-
tion of lung lesions is feasible with good
results, when performed for impending
hydrops prior to onset of severe hemo-
dynamic
compromise.10
A
previous
attempt at removal of a intrapericardial
teratoma in a hydropic fetus did not
result in survival.11 Markers character-
izing the course and predicting in utero
deterioration would be helpful in guid-
ance and timing of effective treatment
strategies.
The aims of this study are to report
our experience with fetal intrapericardial
teratoma, offer insight into monitoring
by fetal echocardiography, and report on
the application of innovative treatment
strategies to deal with this lethal condi-
tion, including successful in utero sur-
gical resection.
Materials and Methods
The database at the Fetal Heart Program
and Center for Fetal Diagnosis and
Treatment at the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia was searched. The diagnosis
of intrapericardial teratoma was sus-
pected through ultrasound assessment
when a large, irregularly shaped mass of
heterogeneous echo-texture appeared to
arise from outside of the cardiac cham-
bers and from within the pericardial sac
lining.
Intrapericardial
teratoma
is
defined as a teratoma arising from within
the pericardial sac, with parietal peri-
cardium covering, to be distinguished
from other masses such as mediastinal
teratoma, or other lung lesions, which
may share similar physiological conse-
quences but by nature may have a
different course and prognosis. Obstet-
rical ultrasound, fetal echocardiography,
and clinical course were reviewed for
each case along with pathology data.
All
patients
underwent
detailed
obstetrical ultrasound and fetal echo-
cardiography. Notation was made of
presence of fluid in body cavities. Fetal
hydrops was defined as significant fluid
accumulation in �2 locations, and in at
least 1 additional space besides the
pericardium
such
as
ascites,
scalp
edema, abdominal wall edema, or skin
edema. Tumor location was character-
ized
and
dimensions
measured.

 tumor shape was irregular but mostly
round or oval, estimate of size was
obtained

measuring
orthogonal
maximum length and maximum width
and calculating the area of an ellipse
[area (cm2) ¼ 3.14 � 1/2

Doppler echocardiography was per-
formed and tracings were obtained in the
ductus venosus (DV) and umbilical vein
(UV) as measures reflecting impediment
to forward venous flow. Abnormal DV
flow patternwas defined as near absent or
reversed flow with atrial contraction;
abnormal UV flow pattern was defined as
presence of venous pulsations.12 Cardiac
output was estimated for right and left
ventricle by pulsed-wave Doppler inter-
rogation across the pulmonic and aortic
valves, respectively, using the formula:
flow ¼ [3.14 � semilunar valve radius2 �
velocity-time integral � heart rate]/esti-
mated weight in kilograms. Normal
combined right and left cardiac output in
the fetus is 400-500 mL/kg/min.13
Quantitative data are described as
range (median) values. Pearson correla-
tion coefficient was used to assess rela-
tionship of tumor size to cardiac output.
Results
From 2009 through 2015, 8 cases of
suspected fetal intrapericardial teratoma
were identified (Table). Gestational age at
initial presentation ranged from 21-34
(median 26) weeks. Serial fetal evalua-
tions with �2 assessments were made
in 5 patients; only 1 evaluation was per-
formed in each of 3 patients (cases 2, 7, 8)
presenting with severe hydrops.
All cases had moderate to large
circumferential pericardial effusion at
initial presentation. In 7 cases, tumor
mass appeared to compress the right
atrium and impair filling of the right
ventricle. In one (case 5), the tumor
appeared to arise from the pericardium
adjacent to the left atrium, extending
leftward and cephalad into the upper
mediastinum.
Pathology
diagnosis
confirmed mature teratoma with multi-
ple germinal cell lines in 6 of 8 patients.
The masses in cases 5 and 6 mimicked
the fetal echocardiographic appearance
of intrapericardial teratoma by exhibit-
ing characteristics of irregular shape, and
heterogeneous echotexture, however on
postnatal pathology were determined to
be an ascending aortic teratoma and an
intracardiac
atrial
hemangioma,
respectively.
Clinical course, management
strategies, and outcomes
Case 1 presented at 22 weeks’ gestation
in a 27-year-old woman with morbid
obesity, hypertension, and gestational
diabetes. A rapidly progressive increase
in tumor size was noted, with a large
cystic component. At 26 weeks’ gesta-
tion, fetal pericardiocentesis was per-
formed and 4 mL of serous fluid
removed. Tumor growth continued un-
abated, with onset of hydrops at 28
weeks and fetal demise at 30 weeks
(Figure 1).
Case 2 presented in a 31-year-old
woman at 31 weeks’ gestation with a
large tumor, ascites, and hydrops. Judg-
ment favored delivery as opposed to
continued fetal management. Due to
concerns about circulatory instability
during transition from fetal to postnatal
life, an ex utero intrapartum therapy
(EXIT) delivery was undertaken.14 The
fetal head and chest were partially
delivered through a uterine hysterotomy.
While still maintained on uteroplacental
support,
median
sternotomy

 performed. The tumor was resected by
dividing fibrous attachments to the
epicardium. To optimize respiratory
mechanics, paracentesis was performed
and 20 mL of ascites fluid removed prior
to cord clamping and fetal ventilation.
After 62 days of neonatal intensive care,
the patient was discharged and at 4 years
of age has no evidence of tumor
recurrence.
Case 3 presented in a 35-year-old
woman at 21 weeks’ gestation without
hydrops, but at 23 weeks a rim of ascites
developed, indicating early onset of
hydrops. The family did not desire
further management and fetal death
ensued at 25 weeks.
Case 4 presented in a 21-year-old
woman at 22 weeks’ gestation without
hydrops. Within 1 week of follow-up a
rim of ascites developed with increase in
tumor size. Realizing the poor prognosis
if left to the natural state, multidisci-
plinary deliberation was undertaken and
the family agreed to pursue open fetal
surgical resection of the tumor. At 24
weeks’ gestational age, maternal lapa-
rotomy and anterior hysterotomy were
performed.15,16 Upper extremities were
brought through the hysterotomy leav-
ing the head and body inside the uterus,
exposing the fetal chest (Figure 2 and
Supplemental
Video).
A
24-gauge
intravenous catheter was placed in the
right hand and a pulse oximeter on the
left hand. Monitoring of cardiac status
was achieved through continuous intra-
operative
fetal
echocardiography.17
Midline
incision
and
sternotomy
exposed a bulging pericardium. To avoid
the negative circulatory consequences of
sudden relief of cardiac tamponade, the
fetus was preloaded with 10 mL/kg of
blood. Manipulation of the teratoma led
to compromise of cardiac function with
onset of severe mitral and tricuspid valve
regurgitation and transient fetal brady-
cardia, which resolved following cessa-
tion
of
tension.
Debulking
of
the
teratoma was undertaken due to tumor
size. At completion of removal, echo-
cardiography revealed decreased filling
of the heart and another 10 mL/kg of
blood infused. Once hemostasis was
ensured, a vessel loop was utilized as a
drain in the anterior chest and the

growth in tumor size was noted during period of prenatal surveillance. CCO remained normal at
>400 mL/kg/min without any decrease throughout period of prenatal surveillance for either of these
cases, neither ultimately identified as intrapericardial teratoma.

 pericardium was left open. The sternum
was closed, the fetus returned to the
uterine cavity, and maternal hysterot-
omy closed. Postoperative course was
uneventful, and serial weekly maternal-
fetal assessments were performed until
37
weeks’
gestation
with
delivery
through low transverse cesarean de-
livery. At birth, the tricuspid valve
annulus was smaller than mitral on
echocardiography, reflecting the residual
of right-sided compression, without ev-
idence for cyanosis or cardiac symptoms.
The child is well at 3 years of age with no
evidence of tumor recurrence.
Case 5 presented in a 23-year-old
woman at 34 weeks’ gestation. A large
irregularly shaped mass was noted in the
left chest, compressing the left atrium
and left ventricle and encasing the
ascending aorta as it extended anteriorly
and cephalad. There was a large peri-
cardial effusion and the tumor was
quite large, yet there was no hydrops and
no change in size of the mass during 3
weeks of follow-up. Elective delivery was
undertaken at 37 weeks’ gestation, and at
cardiac surgery a large encapsulated tu-
mor extending into the upper left
mediastinum, not adherent to any part
of the heart, was noted. The pericardium
was opened and a large bloody effusion
drained. The tumor was mobilized and
found to arise from the ascending aorta,
above
the
sinotubular
junction,
extended onto the underside of the arch
and was adherent to the aortic wall.
During dissection, the aorta was entered
and
cardiopulmonary
bypass
(CPB)
initiated. After
resection, homograft
patch reconstruction of the aorta was
performed. The patient could not be
separated from CPB and after a period of
support with extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, expired.
Case 6 presented in a 31-year-old
woman at 33 weeks’ gestation. An
irregularly
shaped
tumor
associated
with a large pericardial effusion was
noted
in
the
right
atrioventricular
groove with appearance of compres-
sion of the right atrium. Serial evalua-
tion over 4 weeks revealed minimal
increase in tumor size and no signs of
hydrops. Delivery was elected at 37
weeks and the infant was stable at
birth. Surgery was performed in the
first week of life and the tumor was
noted to be inside the right atrium,
adherent to and pushing out the right
atrial free wall. Excision was under-
taken
using
CPB
and
pathology
revealed hemangioma.
Cases 7 and 8 presented at 26 weeks’
gestation. At time of initial presentation,
tumors were very large and hydrops
present. No intervention was undertaken
due to the severe condition of the fetus
and fetal demise subsequently occurred
at 27 and 28 weeks’ gestation.
Tumor size, echocardiographic
markers, and progression of
findings
Tumor size at initial fetal evaluation
ranged from 2.5-19.6 (median 7.0) cm2.
In the 5 cases of serial evaluation, tumor
size increased to a maximum of 3.6-24.7
(median 6.4) cm2. Rapid tumor growth
occurred in 3 cases of confirmed intra-
pericardial teratoma (cases 1, 3, and 4),
with minimal growth in 2 cases, ulti-
mately determined on pathology not to
be of pericardial origin (cases 5 and 6).
No hydrops was present with tumor
size <5 cm2; florid hydrops was present
when tumor size was >9 cm2 in the cases
of confirmed intrapericardial teratoma.
In cases 3 and 4, a small rim of ascites
reflecting early onset of hydrops was
present with tumor size 6.4 and 5.8 cm2,
respectively. Tumor size in case 5 (not of
pericardial origin and positioned left-
ward) grew to be 24.6 cm2, however
there were no signs of hydrops.
Abnormal DV/UV flow patterns were
seen in all cases of hydrops. In the 2 cases
of a small rim of ascites, 1 did (case 3)
and 1 did not (case 4) exhibit DV/UV
flow abnormalities.
Combined cardiac output at initial
presentation ranged from 253-510 (me-
dian 393) mL/kg/min. In all 6 cases of
pathology-confirmed
intrapericardial
teratoma, cardiac output initially pre-
sented at, or rapidly declined to, an
abnormal
level
<400
mL/kg/min
(Figure 3). In the 2 cases of tumor not of
pericardial origin (cases 5 and 6) cardiac
output remained in the normal range
>400
mL/kg/min
during
follow-up
(Figure 4). Analysis of the 6 confirmed
intrapericardial teratoma cases at all
evaluated
points
in
time
demon-
strates combined cardiac output to be
inversely related to tumor size (Pearson
rho ¼ e0.66, P <.001).
Comment
Management of intrapericardial tera-
toma presenting before birth is a chal-
lenge.
Prenatal
diagnosis
often
culminates in fetal death. Resection of an
intrapericardial teratoma after birth is
curative, however treating the fetus with
this condition in utero has to date been
difficult. In the current era of improved
prenatal imaging and cardiovascular
surveillance utilizing fetal echocardiog-
raphy and the potential for in utero
treatment through techniques of fetal
surgery, survival with good outcome
may be possible. In this series, we
describe parameters that characterize
fetal
intrapericardial
teratoma
and
report on successful treatment through
surgical resection in a 31-week fetus
delivered through EXITstrategy and in a
24-week fetus cured through open fetal
surgery.
A number of observations specifically
characterize intrapericardial teratoma
and help distinguish it from other
similar-appearing tumors. In our cases
of pathology-confirmed intrapericardial
teratoma, tumor growth was extremely
rapid, occurring over a period of a few
weeks. Increasing tumor mass led to
cardiac tamponade, with physiological
consequences
of
diminished
cardiac
output, fetal hydrops, and death if left
untreated. Decreasing cardiac output
was directly related to increasing tumor
size. Furthermore, in all cases of true
intrapericardial teratoma the mass arose
on the right side from the region of the
pericardial reflection at the junction of
the ascending aorta and right atrial
appendage, was well encapsulated, and
did not invade adjacent structures. In the
2 cases mimicking intrapericardial tera-
toma there was no significant change in
tumor size over time and no evidence for
an abnormally low cardiac output. In
addition, both presented late in gesta-
tion, resulting in stable newborn infants,
delivered at nearly full term. Despite the
presence of a giant size tumor in case 5,

 Doppler flow patterns in the DV/UV
were normal and there was no hydrops.
Location of the tumor on the left side
may explain the absence of these find-
ings, as the right side of the heart was
unaffected, with preservation of right
ventricle
filling.
Combined
cardiac
output remained normal despite a large
mass, perhaps through compensatory
mechanisms
of
flow
preservation
through the right side of the heart and
the ductus arteriosus. Such mechanisms
of compensation are not possible when
the right side of the heart is compressed
as in true intrapericardial teratoma.
Aggressive rapid tumor growth, with
progressive cardiac tamponade, is thus
the
distinctive
hallmarks
of
this
condition.
Early detection of a relatively small
tumor that is suspicious for intra-
pericardial teratoma based on appear-
ance and location demands careful and
frequent surveillance for change in tu-
mor size and serial assessment of cardiac
output. The objectives are to catch the
condition prior to the onset of hydrops,
so as to avoid treatment while in an
unstable, potentially injured state. Ab-
normalities of Doppler flow patterns in
the DV/UV were mostly present only
once onset of hydrops occurred, there-
fore
this
parameter
may
not
be
an
appropriate
predictor
of
future
impending instability, but rather reflect
cardiovascular instability already pre-
sent. An increase in tumor size and an
abnormally low or declining cardiac
output are therefore indications for
treatment. Although a cystic component
may contribute to the overall tumor
mass
in
intrapericardial
teratoma,
drainage of the cyst may not adequately
relieve tamponade and does not inhibit
rapid tumor growth, as seen in our first
case. Similarly pericardiocentesis alone
may not lead to sufficient relief of tam-
ponade, if the bulk of the tumor mass is
left
untouched.
The
most
effective
treatment is tumor resection.
How best to approach the problem
based on gestational age? Outcomes for
the
premature
infant
>28
weeks’
gestation are good.18 When faced with
progressive increase in tumor size and
decline in cardiac output, delivery >28
weeks
utilizing
the
EXIT
strategy
approach is reasonable. If access cannot
be achieved with delivery and postnatal
resection due to young gestational age,
then successful fetal surgery is possible
if undertaken prior to the onset of fetal
hydrops. We describe the first success-
ful case of fetal surgery for resection of
intrapericardial teratoma, performed at
24 weeks’ gestation. A major contrib-
utor to our success was the ability to
perform the fetal surgery prior to the
onset of hydrops and thus avoid the
development of a critically ill fetus.
Although cardiac output at the time of
fetal surgery was low (310 mL/kg/min),
there was only a small rim of ascites
and no abnormality of DV or UV flow,
indicating a window of opportunity
to
intervene.
Serial
follow-up
of
combined cardiac output revealed an
increase to normal levels after fetal
surgery.
Fetal intrapericardial teratoma can be
successfully treated utilizing serial sur-
veillance and employing treatment prior
to the onset of hydrops. Tumor size,
location, and measured combined car-
diac output aids in decision-making.
Prompt referral for treatment to a
multidisciplinary fetal therapy center at
the time of first diagnosis or at the
earliest signs of increase in tumor size or
decline in cardiac output is essential. If
referred within the appropriate window
of opportunity, consideration for fetal
surgery and resection are possible, with
good results.
