Abstract
Background
Recent in vitro and animal studies have found the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) lansoprazole
to be highly active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Omeprazole and pantoprazole
have no activity. There is no evidence that, in clinical practice, lansoprazole can treat or pre-
vent incident tuberculosis (TB) disease.
Methods and findings
We studied a cohort of new users of lansoprazole, omeprazole, or pantoprazole from the
United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink to determine whether lansoprazole
users have a lower incidence of TB disease than omeprazole or pantoprazole users. Nega-
tive control outcomes of myocardial infarction (MI) and herpes zoster were also studied.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for potential con-
founding by a wide range of factors. We identified 527,364 lansoprazole initiators and
923,500 omeprazole or pantoprazole initiators. Lansoprazole users had a lower rate of TB
disease (n = 86; 10.0 cases per 100,000 person years; 95% confidence interval 8.1–12.4)
than omeprazole or pantoprazole users (n = 193; 15.3 cases per 100,000 person years;
95% confidence interval 13.3–17.7), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 (0.52–0.89).
No association was found with MI (adjusted HR 1.04; 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.08) or
herpes zoster (adjusted HR 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.06). Limitations of this
study are that we could not determine whether TB disease was due to reactivation of latent
infection or a result of recent transmission, nor could we determine whether lansoprazole
would have a beneficial effect if given to people presenting with TB disease.
Conclusions
In this study, use of the commonly prescribed and cheaply available PPI lansoprazole was
associated with reduced incidence of TB disease. Given the serious problem of drug

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• A recent report describes preclinical laboratory findings showing lansoprazole has
strong activity against M. tuberculosis, including drug-resistant strains.
• Other proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole and pantoprazole had no such activity.
• No clinical investigations of this possible protective association with lansoprazole have
yet been reported.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We studied a cohort of new users of lansoprazole, omeprazole, or pantoprazole from the
United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink to determine whether lansoprazole
users have a lower incidence of tuberculosis disease than omeprazole or pantoprazole
users.
• Comparing 527,364 lansoprazole initiators with 923,500 omeprazole or pantoprazole
initiators, lansoprazole users had a lower rate of TB disease with an adjusted HR of 0.68
(0.52–0.89).
• No association was found with negative control outcomes; myocardial infarction
(adjusted HR 1.04; 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.08) or herpes zoster (adjusted HR
1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.06).
What do these findings mean?
• In vitro, animal, and, now, clinical epidemiological data, all suggest that lansoprazole
has activity against M. tuberculosis.
• Pharmacodynamic and early phase clinical trials are warranted to assess whether lanso-
prazole, or its metabolites, might have a role in the prevention or treatment of M. tuber-
culosis infection or tuberculosis disease.
Introduction
In 2015, there were an estimated 10.4 million incident cases of tuberculosis (TB) globally
resulting in approximately 1.4 million deaths [1]. There is little commercial or public invest-
ment in TB research and there are only six novel compounds currently in the TB drug devel-
opment pipeline [2]. In 2015, there were an estimated 480,000 cases of multidrug-resistant TB

 [1]. Treatment regimens for drug-resistant TB (DRTB) are long and unpleasant, with serious
side effects and poor outcomes [1,3,4].
Using a high throughput fibroblast survival assay [5], Rybniker and colleagues found the
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) lansoprazole had activity against M. tuberculosis (MTB), including
drug resistant isolates [6]. This activity was confirmed in murine models and was found to result
from inhibition of the mycobacterial cytochrome bc1 complex, disrupting the respiratory chain
[6]. Omeprazole and pantoprazole, other PPIs, had no activity against MTB. This may be attrib-
uted to lansoprazole being the only PPI with no substitutions on the benzimidazole ring. Such
substitutions are not known to influence treatment efficacy for any existing PPI indication.
Developed for the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases exacerbated by gastric acid pro-
duction, PPIs are among the most widely used drugs globally. Their side effect profile is
favourable compared with drugs used to treat TB [7]. We used the United Kingdom Clinical
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to compare the incidence of TB disease among individuals
taking lansoprazole with that among individuals taking omeprazole or pantoprazole.
Methods
Ethics
The study was approved by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ethics com-
mittee (ref: 11880) and the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) of the Medi-
cines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The final study protocol was made
available to journal reviewers and is attached as supplementary material (S1 Protocol).
Data sources
The CPRD contains anonymised data from UK general practitioners and includes approxi-
mately 8% of the UK population [8]. Information includes comprehensive recording of con-
sultations, diagnoses, prescribed medicines, and basic demographics. Practices and patients
are broadly representative of the UK population [8], and data quality is subject to rigorous
audit. The data have been used to conduct over 900 published studies, and data validity has
been shown to be high for a variety of diagnoses; rates of recorded TB are similar to notifica-
tion data from Public Health England, suggesting good case ascertainment [9]. Over 50% of
CPRD patients have their general practice records linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).
HES include all inpatient National Health Service (NHS) hospitalisations (coded using Inter-
national Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10) [10]. The January 2015 version of CPRD was
used (data available 9th Sep 1987–5th Jan 2015).
Study population and exposure
All patients aged 16 years or over with at least 12 months research-quality follow up in the
CPRD were eligible. From this group, we identified a) all new lansoprazole users and b) all
new omeprazole or pantoprazole users. In both cohorts, patients had to have at least 12 months
prior registration with no previous record of receiving any PPI. No limit on minimum dura-
tion of PPI exposure was made. We used prescribing records to determine intended treatment
duration for each prescription, and imputed the population level median if this information
was missing. In the UK, long term courses of medication are issued in small batches, each
batch being covered by an individual prescription. A typical prescription provides enough
medication to last 1 month, and so a 12-month course of treatment would usually involve 12
prescriptions. Although PPIs are available without prescription in the UK, this is unlikely to
influence our estimates of exposure as it is doubtful many patients would be prescribed a PPI

 and simultaneously obtain a different one without prescription. Patients were excluded if they:
had <12 months prior follow up; prior use of a different PPI; were aged <16 years at start of
PPI treatment; or prior diagnosis of TB.
Outcome
All clinical records indicating TB disease were extracted using Read Codes listed in Supplemen-
tary material (S1 Text). The earliest record was taken as the date of diagnosis. It is well recognised
that there can be a considerable delay between infection with M. tuberculosis and diagnosis of TB
disease. This means the aetiologically relevant exposure is likely to be earlier than the recorded
diagnosis. In a Dutch study, amongst people diagnosed with TB, the median period between
infection and diagnosis was 1.26 years, albeit with substantial variability [11]. For these reasons,
all TB onset dates were moved earlier by 12 months in the primary analysis. Follow-up time for
TB noncases was also censored 12 months earlier, as the final period of follow up would other-
wise become ‘immortal’ time during which an outcome could not occur. Patients with <12
months follow up therefore contributed no follow up to the primary analysis. Supplementary
material (S1 Fig) depicts how typical patient timelines were affected by this offset.
Approximately three-quarters of TB cases in England are among foreign-born individuals
[12]. Given the higher force of infection in most countries of origin, it is likely that much of
this TB results from reactivation of latent infection acquired abroad. The interval between
arrival in England and TB diagnosis varies considerably by country of birth [12]. Among well-
established migrant communities, TB cases may be a result of infection many years prior. The
biology of latent MTB infection is poorly understood [13] and, to our knowledge, there have
been no attempts to quantify the interval between ‘reactivation of latent infection and onset of
symptoms or TB diagnosis. Biologically, the doubling time of MTB might be expected to be
similar in both instances, and the mycobacterial burden required for symptoms to become
apparent might also be expected to be similar. This logic would suggest that the same offset
should be applied. However, given the considerable uncertainty surrounding this assumption,
sensitivity analyses were undertaken (see below). Any misclassification of exposure status
might be expected to bias our effect estimate towards the null.
PPI users are likely to be less healthy than nonusers [14]. The choice of omeprazole and
pantoprazole users as the comparator group should mean we are comparing groups of people
with similar health at baseline. These drugs are considered by most clinicians to be essentially
interchangeable. However, if perceived health also influences the choice of individual PPI, this
could be difficult to detect and account for. To guard against the possibility that any lansopra-
zole effect is driven by an unmeasured imbalance in baseline health, as a posthoc check we ana-
lysed the cohort for two additional ‘control’ outcomes; myocardial infarction (MI; associated
with poor health) and herpes zoster (associated with impaired immunity). There is no reason
to suspect either outcome is influenced by PPI choice. Each outcome was defined as the first
record of this outcome in the CPRD clinical or referral record.
Covariates
Covariates explored as potential confounders included age, sex, calendar year, smoking behav-
ior, body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, ethnicity, drug abuse, any prior use of inhaled/oral cor-
ticosteroids, travel vaccines and antimalarial prescriptions (proxies for travel to TB endemic
regions), diabetes, poorly controlled diabetes (one or more measure of HbA1c > 9% in the pre-
vious year), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, leukaemia, lymphoma,
myeloma, and recorded HIV infection. We also adjusted for two variables measured at the

 practice level: the proportion of new PPI users given lansoprazole each year and the index of
multiple deprivation (IMD) score.
Of note, ciclosporin and tacrolimus, both immunosuppressive drugs, are thought to inter-
act with omeprazole but not other PPIs. It is possible that users of these drugs (who are proba-
bly at higher risk of TB) will be given PPIs other than omeprazole. For this reason, patients
with a history of use of either drug were excluded from the study population.
Statistical analysis
Each participant’s follow up time began at the first prescription for lansoprazole or omepra-
zole/pantoprazole. All subsequent time was classified as follows:
• Lansoprazole–Time covered by lansoprazole prescriptions
• Omeprazole/pantoprazole–Time covered by omeprazole/pantoprazole prescriptions. This
was the baseline against which lansoprazole exposure was compared.
• Unexposed–All time between lansoprazole/omeprazole/pantoprazole exposure periods
(treatment breaks), or between the end of PPI exposure and the end of follow up. This time
is excluded from the main comparison of interest as time off a PPI may represent periods of
better health, and a corresponding change in the risk of TB disease
PPI exposed time included a 60-day period after estimated treatment end date, allowing for
stock piling and nonadherence. People starting treatment with omeprazole/pantoprazole but
later receiving lansoprazole transitioned to the lansoprazole group at that time and vice versa.
End of follow up was the earliest of first recorded TB disease, death, transfer to a different gen-
eral practice, or last data collection date.
Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals,
comparing all lansoprazole-exposed time against all omeprazole- or pantoprazole-exposed
time. A crude model was constructed with just the main exposure variable, followed by a
model adjusting for all potential confounders with complete data. We then investigated poten-
tial confounding by variables with missing data (smoking, BMI, alcohol, ethnicity, and CKD).
To do this, we constructed models excluding people with missing data on each variable. These
variables were only retained in the final model if their inclusion altered the HR by >5%,
thereby ensuring the maximum possible sample size was achieved. We ensured that the pro-
portional hazards assumption was met by examining Schoenfeld residuals. An interaction
term was fitted to look for effect modification between lansoprazole exposure and age. TB inci-
dence was also measured after PPI treatment had been discontinued in an analysis comparing
past lansoprazole users with past omeprazole or pantoprazole users. For the negative control
outcome of MI, additional adjustments were made for the following risk factors if they had
been recorded at any point prior to starting the PPI: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular
disease, peripheral vascular disease, other atheroma, hypertension, heart failure, and statin use.
The burden of TB disease may vary from practice to practice due to differences in patient
populations (e.g., urban versus rural). To see whether this variation was related to the chance
of being prescribed lansoprazole, we calculated practice-level TB prevalence (ever recorded
diagnosis) and practice-level proportion of lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole pre-
scribing accounted for by lansoprazole over the study period. Linear regression was conducted
to describe any association between them.
At the request of referees, we explored indications for PPI prescribing. Indication is not
recorded or linked with the prescribing record by GPs, so we instead examined diagnoses
recorded on the day the PPI was first prescribed.

 Sensitivity analyses
The following sensitivity analyses were undertaken. 1) To address possible delays in diagnosis
or in recording the TB diagnosis in the primary care record and the known variability in the
incubation period, TB onset was redefined as A) date recorded in CPRD, B) 2 years earlier
than recorded, and C) 5 years earlier than recorded. Longer incubation periods than those
described in the Dutch study might be expected in first generation migrants infected in their
country of origin [11]. 2) CPRD-linked HES inpatient data were searched for ICD10 codes
indicating TB (A15–A19). An analysis restricted to CPRD HES-linked practices and time peri-
ods was conducted, taking the earliest of CPRD- or HES-identified TB disease. 3) The time fol-
lowing the end of estimated treatment duration at which we assumed therapy ceased was
extended from 60 to 90 days. 4) Follow-up was censored after cessation or switch of PPI ther-
apy (cessation defined as longer than 60 days not covered by a prescription). 5) As ethnicity is
not recorded for all patients, and is unlikely to be perfectly captured for those with a record,
we conducted an analysis restricted to patients recorded as having any white ethnicity. 6) Very
short courses of lansoprazole therapy may not have an impact on TB incidence; we therefore
conducted an analysis excluding people who received less than a 28-day supply of PPI over the
study period.
Results
Background detail
There were 527,364 new users of lansoprazole and 923,500 new users of omeprazole or panto-
prazole, after exclusions were applied (see Fig 1). The intended treatment duration was missing
for 1% of individual PPI prescriptions, and the population median of 28 days per prescription
was imputed for these records. Table 1 shows the background characteristics of the patients
using data recorded on or before the first PPI prescription. Mean total exposure to PPI was
408 days for lansoprazole users and 386 days for omeprazole or pantoprazole users. Of note,
the lansoprazole group had more current smokers (23% versus 16%) and lansoprazole was
used less frequently than omeprazole and pantoprazole in more recent years (2006 onwards).
Otherwise, the groups were largely similar. The 10 most frequently recorded clinical signs,
symptoms, and diagnoses on the day a PPI was first prescribed were all synonyms for dyspep-
sia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or abdominal pain. This did not differ between lansopra-
zole users and omeprazole or pantoprazole users. The mean time between first PPI
prescription and first record of TB diagnosis was 1.2 years for lansoprazole users (standard
deviation = 2.0) and 1.1 years for omeprazole/pantoprazole users (standard deviation = 1.8).
In the primary analysis, with recorded TB dates moved earlier by 12 months, the rate of TB
was lower with 10.0 cases per 100,000 person-years (pyrs) (95% confidence interval; 8.1–12.4)
in people receiving lansoprazole compared with 15.3 cases per 100,000 pyrs (13.3–17.7) in
those receiving omeprazole/pantoprazole (Table 2). The crude HR was 0.65 (0.51–0.84), with a
fully adjusted HR of 0.68 (0.52–0.89). Censoring follow-up at the first evidence of a treatment
break resulted in a similar effect, with an adjusted HR of 0.59 (0.36–0.97). Considering postex-
posure periods of time when patients received no PPI, there was no detectable difference in TB
incidence between patients who had received lansoprazole and those who had received omep-
razole/pantoprazole. The HR was 0.94 (0.73–1.20), using the same outcome definition as in
the primary analysis (with the outcome date, again, brought forward by 12 months, Table 2).
All sensitivity analyses produced results consistent with the primary analysis. For the analy-
sis of HES/CPRD TB outcomes, confidence intervals were substantially wider and crossed
unity, reflecting the reduced size of the dataset when restricting to patients with linked data

 (Table 2). In sensitivity analyses including variables recorded only in a subset of participants
(IMD, ethnicity and CKD), inclusion of these variables, in a complete case analysis, had little
impact on the HR (S1 Table). An analysis restricted to white patients also found similar results
(HR = 0.72; 0.51–1.03). There was no evidence of an interaction between lansoprazole use and
age, (p = 0.90, S2 Table), and the analysis allowing 90 days without a prescription before
assuming therapy had ceased gave very similar results to the primary analysis (S3 Table).
Using linear regression, we found no evidence of any association between practice level TB
prevalence and the practice level proportion of PPI prescribing accounted for by lansoprazole
(p = 0.98; see S2 Fig for scatterplot).
For the negative control outcome of MI, patients receiving lansoprazole had very similar
rates to those receiving omeprazole/pantoprazole both during periods of PPI exposure
(adjusted HR = 1.04; 1.00–1.08, see Table 3), and post-PPI exposure (adjusted HR 0.98 (0.93–
1.03). A similar pattern was seen for herpes zoster, with an on-treatment adjusted HR of 1.03
(1.00–1.06), and a post-treatment adjusted HR of 1.01 (0.98–1.04).
Discussion
In a large, validated, and nationally representative dataset, we have demonstrated a protective
association between lansoprazole use and newly diagnosed TB disease with an adjusted HR of
0.68 (0.52–0.89) when compared with omeprazole or pantoprazole use. This association was
not seen in past users of these drugs and no association was seen between lansoprazole use and
our negative control outcomes of MI and herpes zoster.
We selected a cohort of new adult users of lansoprazole, omeprazole, or pantoprazole, and
the only clinical exclusion criteria was for patients with previous exposure to ciclosporin or
tacrolimus, in order to avoid a potentially biased sample of lansoprazole patients at increased
risk of TB disease. This exclusion affected approximately 0.1% of otherwise eligible patients,
with all other exclusions based on age, length of time under observation in the CPRD, or prior
history of TB. Our estimate of the TB notification rate in the study population is very similar
to the 10.5 per 100,000 pyrs measured by Public Health England in 2015 [12]. People pre-
scribed PPIs are not a random sample of the general population; they tend to be older and
have more morbidity, especially gastrointestinal disease [14]. Nonetheless, if the association
we report here is due to the pharmacological action of lansoprazole described by Rybniker [6],
we can think of no biological reason why this effect would not be seen in the wider population.
We did not anticipate identifying many true confounders as, to explain our results, these
would need to be associated with both the choice of PPI and TB disease. Whilst multiple risk
factors for TB are known, what matters here is whether they are also associated with the choice
of one PPI over another. Clinicians consider PPIs broadly equivalent and would generally not
consciously select a specific PPI based on patient characteristics. In the UK, choice of specific
drugs within a class may be mandated by guidelines for regional groups of general practition-
ers or influenced by cost, the efficacy of marketing activities, prescriber preference, or habit.
One possible alternate explanation for our results is that regional variation in prescribed PPI
was associated with local rates of TB infection. However, we found no association between
practice level prevalence of TB infection and likelihood of prescribing lansoprazole. Similarly,
whilst both choice of PPI and TB incidence varied over time, adjustment for calendar year did
not affect our results. We were unable to adjust for some TB risk factors such as country of
birth, homelessness, imprisonment, or prior use of biologic therapies. Nonetheless, we were

 able to adjust for proxy measures of some of these factors such as ethnicity, history of RA or
cancer, and socioeconomic status. Indeed, the striking lack of change in the estimated HR
when we adjusted for many potential risk factors suggests that there is little confounding. The
protective association we report here is consistent with lansoprazole having clinical activity
against MTB in humans.
If causal, the protective effect demonstrated may underestimate that which could be
achieved in MTB infection or TB disease. For example, although the patients in our analysis
would mostly have been prescribed their PPI once daily, perfect adherence to this regimen is
unlikely. Adherence to treatment may be better in individuals with a life-threatening infection,
taking treatment for a discrete period of time, and receiving appropriate support.
Little previous work has been done to investigate the association between PPI use and TB.
However, Hsu et al. [15] found an association between acid suppressing medication and an
increased risk of TB disease, which on the surface appears at odds with our findings for lanso-
prazole. However, the association declined to null with increasing duration of therapy with
either a PPI or a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. This points towards reverse causality as a
possible explanation, whereby people with unrecognised early symptoms of TB may be pre-
scribed an acid suppressant.
It is not possible to determine from our results whether the association we demonstrated
was against TB resulting from recent infection or from reactivation of latent infection. Most
TB in England is thought to result from reactivation [12]. Were some individuals to have had
early active disease on starting lansoprazole, use of a single drug might have been insufficient
to prevent the emergence of resistance during the course of ‘treatment’. TB disease (though
not latent infection) is usually treated with a combination of different drugs.
The absence of a persistent effect of lansoprazole after stopping treatment, in the context of
a population within which incident TB is most likely due to reactivation of latent M. tuberculo-
sis infection, suggests that lansoprazole, at these doses, does not sterilise. This is also consistent
with the in vitro data, which suggest lansoprazole metabolites are bacteriostatic [6]. Several
drugs used in regimens to treat TB disease are also bacteriostatic [16], e.g., cycloserine and
para-amino salicylic acid. We note that isoniazid, a key drug used both to treat latent M. tuber-
culosis infection and TB disease, did offer long-term protection in early randomised controlled
trials in individuals with latent infection [17]. However, recent mathematical modeling studies
suggest that M. tuberculosis infection probably persists in the majority of individuals after a
course of isoniazid. These analyses used data from largely HIV positive individuals enrolled in
randomised controlled trials in settings with a high burden of TB disease [18–20]. The biology
of latent M. tuberculosis infection is complex and poorly understood [13]. The balance between

 bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity for particular drugs can vary depending on the dose of
drug given and the metabolic state of the mycobacteria [16]. The precise nature of any effect of
lansoprazole cannot be ascertained from our data.
The original in vitro work found lansoprazole to be acting as a pro-drug [6]. The metabolite
with activity against MTB, lansoprazole sulfide, is produced via intracellular metabolism.
Whilst we could not study the direct effects of lansoprazole sulfide, it is a stable metabolite and
importantly has no activity against the gastric H+ K+ ATPase, the PPI drug target [6].

 Therefore, it might be used to treat MTB with fewer off-target effects. Lansoprazole and its
metabolites have a number of attractive properties. PPIs have a very favourable side effect pro-
file, as compared with drugs currently used to treat TB [7]. There is no evidence that lansopra-
zole interacts meaningfully with drugs commonly used to treat TB or HIV [21]. Lansoprazole
is off-patent with inexpensive generic versions available. In addition, in vitro studies suggest
the drug might have activity against both drug sensitive and drug-resistant strains [6].
We were unable to assess whether TB diagnosis was associated with lansoprazole dose, and
it is not known how the currently licensed dose of lansoprazole compares with the optimal
dose for activity against MTB. The initial in vitro work by Rybniker et al. tested the pro-drug
lansoprazole itself. Strong activity against MTB was detected at a lansoprazole concentration
of 10 μM and half maximal activity (IC50) was observed at 1.47 μM, or 2.2 μM in a second cell
line [5,6]. When given orally at a typical daily dose of 30 mg, Cmax for lansoprazole in human
plasma is 1 mg/ml [22], with little change after dosing for five days. This corresponds to a con-
centration of 2.71μM [23]—i.e., a concentration in plasma greater than the estimated IC50.
Further work to determine whether effective concentrations of the sulfide metabolite can safely
be achieved in relevant tissues in humans may be needed (e.g., in granulomas or pulmonary
cavities). However, very high doses of lansoprazole sulfide (300 mg/kg) have been tolerated by

 mice [6], suggesting it may be possible to treat humans with higher doses than individuals in
CPRD would have been receiving.
In this study, use of lansoprazole was associated with a reduced incidence of TB disease
compared with omeprazole or pantoprazole. To our knowledge, these are the first observations
to suggest that lansoprazole may have clinical activity against MTB in humans. They are con-
sistent with evidence from both in vitro and animal studies [5,6]. Given the problems of anti-
microbial resistance and the adverse side-effects seen with many antituberculous agents, these
results are welcome. Our results do not directly address the question of whether lansoprazole
or its metabolites would be effective as part of a treatment regimen for MTB infection or TB
disease. However, since lansoprazole is safe and well-tolerated, there is a strong case for effi-
cacy studies in humans.
