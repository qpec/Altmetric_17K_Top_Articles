Introduction
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in wom-
en, with 40,610 women predicted to die from breast cancer in 
2017 (1). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by 
absence or minimal expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and pro-
gesterone receptor (PR) and lack of the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (her2) amplification, represents 15%–20% of 
all breast cancers. TNBC is generally more aggressive; although 
many patients respond well to standard anthracycline- and tax-
ane-based chemotherapy, long-term patient survival is poor due to 
high rates of relapse and recurrence (2, 3). Furthermore, there are 
few treatment options for TNBC patients whose tumors are resis-
tant to standard chemotherapy (4). Therefore, there is an urgent 
need to identify additional drugs and drug targets for TNBC 
patients, who have a very poor prognosis. DNA methylation, the 
transfer of a methyl group to a cytosine residue to form 5-methyl-
cytosine (5mC), is a heritable epigenetic process regulating gene 
function in normal mammalian development. However, hyper-
methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions of critical 
growth regulators, such as tumor suppressors, is a major event in 
the origin of many cancers (5). TNBC tumors show extensive pro-
moter hypermethylation of epigenetic biomarker genes compared 
with other breast cancer subtypes in which promoter hypermeth-
ylation events were less frequent (6, 7), suggesting that targeting 
the epigenetic machinery of TNBCs may have clinical benefits.
5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a demethylating 
agent that is approved by many international regulatory agen-
cies, including the US FDA and the European Commission 
(EC), for treating hematological malignancies (8–10) and that 
has become a standard of care for patients with higher risk 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (11, 12). Decitabine suppress-
es DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (13, 14). Three active 
DNMTs have been identified in humans, DNMT1, DNMT3A, 
and DNMT3B (15). DNMT1 recognizes hemimethylated DNA 
generated during DNA replication and then methylates newly 
synthesized CpG dinucleotides (16). DNMT3A and DNMT3B 
mainly work as de novo methyltransferases to establish DNA 
methylation, and they can also methylate hemimethylated 
DNA (17). Decitabine converts to the active thiphosphorylated 
nucleotides, incorporates to DNA as a cytosine substitute, irre-
versibly binds to DNMTs, and traps the enzymes on DNA. This 
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with poor prognosis that lacks targeted therapies, especially 
in patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease. Since DNA methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressors is common 
in cancer, reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine), an FDA-approved DNA 
methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, has proven effective in treating hematological neoplasms. However, its antitumor 
effect varies in solid tumors, stressing the importance of identifying biomarkers predictive of therapeutic response. Here, 
we focused on the identification of biomarkers to select decitabine-sensitive TNBC through increasing our understanding 
of the mechanism of decitabine action. We showed that protein levels of DNMTs correlated with response to decitabine 
in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) organoids originating from chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant TNBCs, suggesting 
DNMT levels as potential biomarkers of response. Furthermore, all 3 methytransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, 
were degraded following low-concentration, long-term decitabine treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The DNMT proteins 
could be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to lysosome-dependent protein 
degradation. Depletion of TRAF6 blocked decitabine-induced DNMT degradation, conferring resistance to decitabine. Our 
study suggests a potential mechanism of regulating DNMT protein degradation and DNMT levels as response biomarkers for 
DNMT inhibitors in TNBCs.

the DNMT function (18). High micromolar doses of decitabine 
rapidly induce DNA damage and cytotoxicity (19, 20). This 
mechanism is different from the mechanisms observed at low-

panel of 15 organoid cultures developed from 15 distinct TNBC 
PDX tumors from patients whose disease was either sensitive (n = 
9) or resistant (n = 6) to standard anthracycline- and taxane-based 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) (Supplemental Table 1; sup-
plemental material available online with this article; https:/
/doi.
org/10.1172/JCI97924DS1) (33). As shown in Figure 1, B–D, we 
observed great variability in decitabine response in these breast 
cancer organoids. Interestingly, we observed that decitabine 
response highly correlated with DNMT3A and DNMT3B protein 
levels and, to a lesser extent, with DNMT1 protein levels (Figure 
1, D–F). Tumors with high expression of all 3 DNMTs were more 
sensitive to decitabine treatment (Figure 1, D and E). These find-
ings suggest that protein levels of these DNMTs might influence 
breast-tumor response to decitabine treatment.
PDXs are considered to be more representative of human 
tumors and are increasingly used as in vivo models for preclin-
ical drug testing (36). To further determine whether the decit-
abine response in the organoids represents the drug sensitivity 
in the preclinical models, we selected 3 PDX models that were 
predicted to be “sensitive” (MCD-01, MCD-11, MCD-03) and 
3 PDX models predicted to be “resistant” (MCD-05, MCD-02, 
MCD-04) based on the organoid testing results (Figure 1D) for 
the in vivo drug tests. Mice were treated with 5 mg/kg decitabine 
according to the dosing schedule shown in Figure 2A. As shown 
in Figure 2B and Supplemental Table 1, the response pattern to 
decitabine in the PDX models was consistent with our observa-
tions in the organoid models.
Furthermore, we tested decitabine sensitivity in PDX organ-
oids and PDX lines derived from both pre- and post-NAC tumor 
(chemotherapy-resistant tumor) and found that the sensitivity 
to decitabine is dependent on the DNMT levels regardless of the 
tumors’ sensitivity to chemotherapy (Supplemental Table 1), sug-
gesting that decitabine might be effective in both settings.
Taken together, the findings that organoids and PDX models 
expressing elevated levels of DNMT proteins are more sensitive 
to decitabine than those expressing low levels of DNMTs suggest 
that DNMT protein levels might serve as biomarkers for decit-
abine-treatment response in TNBC.
Decitabine treatment induces lysosomal degradation of DNMTs. 
Decitabine, when administered at high concentrations, is known 
to degrade DNMT1 protein, resulting in DNA damage at a high 
dose and short-term treatment setting (37). However, the effect 
of decitabine action at low concentrations has not been fully elu-
cidated (22). To explore the mechanism, we first determined the 
protein levels of 3 DNMTs in both control and decitabine-treated 
PDX groups. DNMT1 levels decreased upon low-concentration 
decitabine treatment. Interestingly, both DNMT3A and DNMT3B 
protein levels were also dramatically reduced (Figure 3A) after 
decitabine treatment, whereas decitabine treatment did not affect 
the mRNA levels of all 3 genes (Figure 3B).
To further confirm these results, we treated 3 different TNBC 
cancer cell lines, Hs 578T, BT-549, and MDA-MB-231 cells, with 
100 nM decitabine for 7 days. A reduction of all 3 DNMT proteins, 
but not the mRNAs, in these cells was observed (Figure 3, C and 
D). Clonogenic assay also showed that fewer clones formed after 
decitabine treatment compared with the control group, indicating 
that decitabine inhibits cell proliferation (Figure 3E). Because pro-
In solid cancers, decitabine has been studied mainly using 
high doses, and these studies have shown substantial toxicity 
(25), thereby prohibiting the clinical development of this drug 
in solid tumors. Despite the toxicity, antitumor activity has been 
observed, with decitabine response rates ranging from 6% in 
female reproductive cancer (n = 35) to 50% in breast cancer (n = 4) 
(26). Even though the number of patients in these studies is small, 
the interindividual variation in response to decitabine emphasizes 
the clinical importance of identifying effective markers for select-
ing patients who may benefit from this drug.
Unlike in hematological malignancies, few studies have 
explored the mechanisms of low-dose decitabine in solid tumors. 
Tsai et al. have shown that exposure of epithelial tumor cells to 
decitabine at nanomolar doses produced an antitumor “mem-
ory” response by sustained decrease in genome-wide promoter 
DNA methylation and gene reexpression in key cellular regulatory 
pathways (27). These data suggest that a better understanding of 
decitabine mechanism of action is essential for its application in 
the treatment of solid tumors.
DNMT1 and DNMT3A are reported to be overexpressed in 
5% and 3% of breast carcinomas (6), whereas DNMT3B is over-
expressed in 30% of breast cancers (28). The relationship between 
DNMTs and response to decitabine in solid cancer remains 
controversial. Previous studies suggested that DNMT1 mRNA 
expression is positively correlated with decitabine sensitivity, 
while others suggested a negative correlation between DNMT3B 
mRNA expression and decitabine sensitivity in ovarian (29) and 
pancreatic cancers (30). In the current study, we sought to system-
atically explore the relationship of different DNMT isoforms with 
decitabine-treatment response in TNBCs and to further inves-
tigate the mechanism of decitabine action in the treatment of 
TNBC. We found that DNMT protein levels correlated with decit-
abine response in a breast cancer organoid model derived from 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. This effect was mediat-
ed by decitabine-induced protein degradation of all 3 DNMTs, and 
this process was dependent on the E3 ligase TNF receptor–associ-
ated factor 6 (TRAF6). Collectively, our results point to decitabine 
as a potential new therapeutic for TNBC.
Results
DNMT expression levels dictate tumor sensitivity to decitabine treat-
ment. 3D organoid cultures recapitulate in vivo tissue structural 
organization and more closely resemble the actual tumor biology 
than 2D cultures of primary or immortalized cells (31), thereby 
providing an attractive platform for testing cancer cell response 
to drugs (32). As previously described, we generated a panel of 
PDX models from patients with primary breast cancer recruited 
in a prospective neoadjuvant study of anthracycline- and tax-
ane-based chemotherapy, with PDX models derived from both 
baseline percutaneous biopsy prior to chemotherapy and post-
chemotherapy surgical samples (33, 34). In addition to in vivo 
PDX studies, we also successfully grew organoids using the PDX 
tumors to test response to therapies and to identify molecular 
markers that might be associated with response (Figure 1A).
Previous studies demonstrated that decitabine exhibited 
antitumor activity in breast cancer (30, 35). To identify biomark-
ers for decitabine response, we tested decitabine sensitivity in a

of lysine residues called ubiquitination (38). We also detected 
enhanced ubiquitination of DNMTs in the presence of decitabine 
(Figure 3G). These results suggest that low-concentration and 
long-term decitabine treatment induce degradation of all 3 DNMT 
isoforms predominantly in a lysosome-dependent manner.
The ubiquitin E3 ligase TRAF6 interacts with DNMTs. The E3 ligas-
es are responsible for recognizing specific substrates and catalyzing 
their ubiquitination (38). To determine the potential E3 ligase that is 
responsible for the degradation of DNMTs, we analyzed the protein 
tein can be degraded through several proteolytic pathways, we uti-
lized various inhibitors to block protein degradation: MG132 (pro-
teasome), concanamycin A (lysosome), calpeptin (calpain), and 
Z-VAD-FMK (caspase) to identify the specific pathway. MG132 
only partially rescued the DNMT protein levels, while concanamy-
cin A treatment resulted in the most substantial reversal of DNMT 
protein levels. Moreover, we did not observe any marked effect 
with calpain or caspase inhibitors (Figure 3F). Proteins are marked 
for degradation by the attachment of ubiquitin to the side chain

TRAF6 and DNMTs interact by performing immunoprecipitation 
assays. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed the interaction of endoge-
nous TRAF6 and DNMTs (Figure 4B). To further confirm these inter-
actions, we carried out in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. As 
shown in Figure 4C, bacterial expressed and purified GST-DNMT1

bored a conserved TRAF6-binding motif (PxExx [aromatic (F

esized that TRAF6 might be the E3 ligase that mediates DNMTs’ 
ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether

could pull down purified Myc-TRAF6, indicating a direct interac-
tion. Similar in vitro results were also observed between TRAF6 and 
DNMT3B or DNMT3A, respectively (Figure 4, D and E).
To map the region or regions of TRAF6 involved in the inter-
action with DNMTs, we generated 4 TRAF6 deletion constructs, 
based on TRAF6 domain architecture: RING domain deletion 
(Δ1), the internal CC domain deletion (Δ2), Zinc finger deletion 
(Δ3), and TRAF-C domain deletion (Δ4) (40) (Figure 4F). Dele-
tion of the TRAF-C domain (Δ351–522aa) abrogated the inter-
action among TRAF6 and DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, 
respectively (Figure 4G). Taken together, these data indicate that 
TRAF6 directly interacts with DNMTs and that the interaction is 
dependent on the TRAF6 TRAF-C domain.
TRAF6 ubiquitinates DNMTs and induces protein degradation. 
As TRAF6 is a RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, we next tested 
to determine whether TRAF6 was the E3 ligase for the DNMTs’ 
ubiquitination. We first tested the effect of knockdown of TRAF6 
on DNMT ubiquitination. As shown in Figure 4H, in MDA-MB-231 
cells transfected with TRAF6 siRNA, ubiquitinated DNMTs 
decreased in TRAF6–knocked down cells. Consistently, TRAF6 
CRISPR/Cas9-KO cells also showed defects in ubiquitination of 
DNMTs compared with WT control cells (Figure 4I). To further 
confirm that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity is essential for this process, 
we overexpressed WT TRAF6 and the TRAF6 with an E3-inac-
tive RING mutant (TRAF6C70A) in TRAF6-KO cells. We found 
that overexpression of WT, but not the E3-inactive RING mutant

(TRAF6C70A) TRAF6, in TRAF6-KO cells reversed the decrease in 
DNMT1 ubiquitination caused by TRAF6 depletion (Figure 4J).
Lys-48–linked ubiquitination mainly targets substrates for 
proteasome-mediated 
degradation, 
whereas 
Lys-63–linked 
polyubiquitination is primarily associated with nonproteolytic 
functions, such as regulation of protein activity and lysosomal 
degradation (41). TRAF6 has been reported as mainly mediating 
Lys-63–linked ubiquitination (42). Based on the phenotype, it is 
possible that TRAF6 might facilitate lysosomal degradation of 
DNMTs. To determine whether TRAF6 regulates protein stabil-
ity of DNMTs, we depleted TRAF6 in different breast cancer cell 
lines. Interestingly, knockdown of TRAF6 upregulated the pro-
tein levels of all 3 DNMT members (Figure 5A). Similar findings 
were observed in TRAF6 CRISPR/Cas9-KO MDA-MB-231 breast 
cancer cells (Figure 5B). To determine whether the changes in 3

Decitabine induces ubiquitination and degradation of DNMTs 
through TRAF6. Our data demonstrate that decitabine induc-
es ubiquitination of all 3 DNMTs (Figure 3G) and mediates their 
protein degradation in a lysosome-dependent manner (Figure 
3F). To determine whether the degradation of DNMTs following 
decitabine treatment is dependent on TRAF6, we treated control 
and TRAF6-depleted cells with decitabine (Figure 5E). Depletion 
of TRAF6 reversed the degradation of DNMTs induced by decit-
abine (Figure 5E). These results reveal that decitabine-induced 
DNMT degradation is dependent on TRAF6.
To further determine whether the degradation process might 
affect decitabine efficacy, we performed colony-formation assays. 
In the TRAF6-KO group, more colonies formed following decit-
abine treatment compared with in the control group (Figure 5F), 
changes in global DNA methylation, we determined the glob-
al methylation in TRAF6-WT and TRAF6-KO cells by dot blot 
analysis using anti-5mC antibody (Figure 5C). Consistent with 
the increased DNMT levels in the TRAF6-KO cells, global meth-
ylation levels of 5mC were substantially increased in these cells 
when compared with the WT cells (Figure 5C). To further confirm 
that TRAF6-dependent degradation of all 3 DNMTs depends on 
its E3 ligase activity, we transfected WT and E3 ligase catalytic 
inactive forms of TRAF6 into TRAF6-KO cells and found that 
only the WT TRAF6 promoted degradation of DNMTs, but not 
the TRAF6 C70A mutant that lacks E3 ligase activity (Figure 5D). 
Taken together, these results suggest that TRAF6 is the E3 ubiqui-
tin ligase for all 3 DNMTs and that it regulates their protein stabil-
ity through a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway.

with response to demethylating drugs. Additionally, decitabine 
response was not shown to be associated with the methylation 
status of specific genes (55, 56). Similarly, genome-wide promot-
er DNA methylation studies have not yielded a robust predictive 
signature for response to these drugs (57). However, recent stud-
ies indicated that activation in the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway and 
DNMT1 mRNA expression are correlated with the cytotoxic activ-
ity of decitabine in ovarian cancer (29). More efforts are needed to 
identify molecular markers for prediction of decitabine response 
in cancers, including breast cancer.
In the current study, we demonstrated that in the TNBC PDX–
derived organoids originating from primary tumors that were 
either responsive or resistant to chemotherapy (Supplemental 
Table 1) as well as tumors from after 20 weeks of NAC, DNMT 
protein levels, rather than mRNA levels, were highly correlated 
with decitabine sensitivity (Figure 1, D–F). Preclinical PDX mod-
els also showed greater effects of decitabine in tumors expressing 
higher level of DNMTs (Figure 2B). These findings suggest that 
DNMT protein levels may be biomarkers for decitabine response 
in TNBCs. For patients who might have developed resistance to 
standard chemotherapy and for whom the choices of alternative 
therapies are limited, decitabine could be very effective in a subset 
who have high levels of DNMTs. Although a few studies in solid 
tumors have shown that overexpression of DNMTs is associated 
with resistance to chemotherapy (58, 59), in our limited number 
of PDX-derived organoid models, we did not find a correlation 
between DNMT levels and NAC response using the correspond-
ing clinical pathological complete response (pCR) for these organ-
oids. However, in organoids that expressed high levels of DNMTs, 
decitabine could sensitize the organoids to paclitaxel, the first 
chemotherapy in the NAC regimen used in patients from whom 
PDX organoids were developed (Supplemental Figure 1A). This 
sensitization effect was not dependent on paclitaxel response. 
We understand that the PDX-derived organoids might be differ-
ent from original human tumors at the molecular level. However, 
studies, including ours and many others, suggest that these pre-
clinical models can faithfully represent human tumor biology and 
clinical treatment response (34, 60). Obviously, additional clinical 
and preclinical studies are required to validate all the findings.
Even though many mechanisms have been proposed for the 
antitumor activity of decitabine, the mechanisms underlying how 
decitabine suppresses tumor growth require more investigation. 
Decitabine was first thought to be incorporated into DNA, replac-
ing cytosine in the DNA, leading to the formation of a covalent 
bond between DNMT1 and the 5-aza-cytosine ring that is trapped 
on the DNA. The replication fork progresses in the absence of 
DNMT1, resulting in passive loss of DNA methylation in the 
nascent strand, but not the DNA template (61). DNMT1 was also 
found to be involved in controlling cell growth (62). However, in 
this study, we found that a new mechanism involving the E3 ligase, 
TRAF6, mediated degradation of DNMTs following low concen-
tration of decitabine treatment. A prior study has shown that 
decitabine induces proteosomal-dependent DNMT1 degrada-
tion by APC/CCdh1 in cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and the HCT116 
colon cancer cell line (63, 64). In our study, we found that, not 
only DNMT1, but also DNMT3A and DNMT3B, were degraded 
following low-concentration decitabine treatment in multiple 
suggesting that the intact TRAF6 gene is essential for decitabine’s 
inhibition of breast cancer cell growth. Reconstitution of WT 
TRAF6, but not the TRAF6 C70A mutant, restored the sensitiv-
ity to decitabine treatment, further confirming that TRAF6 E3 
ligase activity is essential in this process (Figure 5G). These results 
suggest that TRAF6 determines breast cancer cell sensitivity to 
decitabine treatment through the regulation of protein stability of 
DNMT isoforms.
Decitabine treatment induces TRAF6 mRNA expression. To further 
explore the mechanism of how decitabine induces TRAF6-mediat-
ed degradation of DNMTs, we assessed TRAF6 expression in vivo 
both before and after decitabine treatment. We observed elevated 
TRAF6 protein levels in PDX tumors after decitabine treatment, as 
shown in Figure 6A. We further examined TRAF6 mRNA expression 
by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Consis-
tent with elevated TRAF6 protein levels, a significant increase in 
mRNA levels was observed in PDX tumors treated with decitabine 
compared with vehicle (Figure 6B). These results were confirmed in 
3 different TNBC cell lines (Figure 6, C and D). Furthermore, TRAF6 
expression was induced by decitabine in a time-dependent manner 
(Figure 6E). These data show that decitabine treatment induces 
TRAF6 expression, resulting in increased protein levels.
Discussion
Identification of biomarkers is critical for selecting patients who 
have a high likelihood of response to a given treatment. In breast 
cancer, ER expression and HER2 gene amplification/expression 
are targets for endocrine therapy and anti-HER2–based therapies, 
respectively (43–45). However, there is a lack of such targets in 
TNBC pointing to effective therapies. New drug targets are greatly 
needed. Because of the prominent role of epigenetic regulation in 
TNBC, targeting epigenetic regulators has shown promising bene-
fit in a series of TNBC cell lines (46).
Demethylating agents have been shown to be effective in the 
treatment of hematological malignancies, and their efficacy in sol-
id tumors was also evaluated in a variety of solid cancers (26, 47). 
Besides azacitidine and decitabine, which are the only demethyl-
ating drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDS (48, 
49), other DNMT inhibitors, such as guadecitabine, hydralazine, 
and MG98, have been investigated as anticancer agents (47). In 
patients with ovarian cancer, increased sensitivity was observed 
toward carboplatin after treatment with either azacitidine (50) or 
decitabine (51, 52). In patients with non–small cell lung carcino-
ma (NSCLC), increased efficacy of subsequent anticancer ther-
apy was observed in patients who received prior azacitidine (53). 
However, a recent phase II clinical trial, including 13 patients with 
advanced TNBC treated with azacidine and the histone deacety-
lase inhibitor entinostat, reported by Connolly et al. showed no 
clinical response in these patients (54). All of these studies sug-
gest that, in patients with solid tumors, more research is required 
to identify a subgroup of patients who might benefit from DNA 
demethylating agents.
Even in patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
only 50% have shown a clinical response to DNMT inhibitors. 
Prior studies have attempted to identify predictive biomarkers in 
patients with MDS or AML, but most found no or relatively weak 
correlation between variation in cancer genomes or epigenomes

led to TRAF6 ubiquitination of all 3 DNMTs (Figure 4, H–J) and 
promoted their degradation (Figure 5, A and B). However, the 
TRAF6 C70A mutant, lacking the E3 ligase activity, lost its capa-
bility to degrade DNMTs (Figure 4J and Figure 5C).
Our study has identified the DNMTs as new targets of K63-
linked polyubiquitination through lysosome-mediated degra-
dation (Figure 4, B–E, H, and I; and Figure 3F). In cancer cells, 
DNMT proteins are polyubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, TRAF6, 
thereby inducing lysosome-dependent protein degradation (Fig-
ure 3, F and G). Although several other proteins were also known 
to be degraded in this manner, such as GABAB1 and mind bomb-2 
(79), the detailed mechanisms involved in K63-linked polyubiquti-
nation–mediated lysosomal degradation need further investiga-
tion. In our study, decitabine treatment upregulated TRAF6 pro-
tein levels and mRNA levels (Figure 6, A–D), leading to enhanced 
degradation of DNMTs (Figure 5, D and E). However, how TRAF6 
transcription is upregulated by decitabine remains unclear. The 
TRAF6 gene is not generally DNA methylated at promoter regions 
in breast cancer cells (Supplemental Table 2), indicating decit-
abine activation of TRAF6 may be through a pathway upstream of 
TRAF6. Kawai et al. has shown that TRAF6 activity was required 
for IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activation (80). Recent studies 
also indicated that decitabine treatment may induce the cancer 
cell endogenous retrovirus and activate IRF7 (81, 82), indicating 
that decitabine may activate endogenous retrovirus and antiviral 
responses that could upregulate TRAF6.
Taking these data together, our study suggests that decitabine 
induces degradation of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B by 
TRAF6 through a lysosome-dependent protein-degradation path-
way (Figure 6F). This is one major mechanism by which decitabine 
inhibits tumor growth. We also found that growth in tumors with 
high DNMT protein levels was greatly suppressed by decitabine 
treatment, suggesting that DNMT protein levels might serve as a 
potential biomarker to guide drug selection in the clinic. Finally, 
TNBC PDX responded to decitabine regardless of chemotherapy 
response. Therefore, TNBC patients with high DNMT levels and 
resistance to standard chemotherapy may still benefit from decit-
abine. Future clinical studies are required to test decitabine or 
decitabine-like drugs in high-risk TNBC patients.
Methods
In vivo mouse maintenance and decitabine drug treatment. Breast cancer 
PDX models were generated from baseline prechemotherapy percuta-
neous biopsy as described previously (33, 34). Liquid nitrogen–preserved 
tumor lines were thawed and injected in 6- to 8-week-old female NSG 
mice (Jackson Laboratory). When xenograft primary tumors reached 1 
cm in diameter, mice were sacrificed and tissue fragments were trans-
planted to 6- to 8-week-old female NOD-SCID mice for the drug tests. 
Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly by a caliper. Once tumors 
reached 150 to 250 mm3, mice were randomized into control (vehicle, 
saline solution) or decitabine (5 mg/kg, i.p. 3 times weekly) groups, with 
each group consisting of 7 to 8 mice. The dose used in mice was convert-
ed from the low dose, 15 mg/m2/d, used in treating human hematopoi-
etic malignancies. This dose in humans can achieve nanomolar plasma 
concentration (83, 84). The dose conversion and calculation were based 
on the FDA recommendation (https:/
/www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/
guidances/ucm078932.pdf) and literature (85).
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 3C) and PDX tumor tissues (Fig-
ure 3A). MG132 only partially inhibited their degradation, but the 
lysosome inhibitor, concanamycin A, dramatically reversed the 
degradation process (Figure 3F). It is possible that the difference 
between our observations and previous studies might be due to 
the different cancer cells and the dose and duration of decitabine 
treatment. Low-dose decitabine has been used in a recent clinical 
trial for advanced lung cancer patients, where it led to a stable and 
durable response in some patients (53). Therefore, in our study, we 
treated the cells and PDX organoids with nanomolar concentra-
tions of decitabine (27), and we observed a significant effect on 
growth inhibition in both breast cancer cell lines (Figure 3E) and 
PDX organoids (Figure 1D). Our findings identify a mechanism of 
action of DNMT inhibitors, which may be useful to elucidate resis-
tance mechanisms for these drugs (65).
The ubiquitin system is composed of a ubiquitin-activat-
ing enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-carrier proteins (E2 enzymes; also 
known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and ubiquitin ligas-
es (E3 enzymes) (66). The ubiquitin protein is a small protein, 
and its molecular weight is around 9 kd. Ubiquitin possesses 7 
lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) and an 
N-terminal methionine (M1) that may be utilized to form poly-
ubiquitin chains. The human genome encodes about 800 E3 
enzymes recognizing a large number of substrates, controlling 
different linkage-chain formation, and manipulating complicat-
ed signaling in the cells (67). The various types of linkage are 
usually associated with different cellular functions. K48 and 
K63 linkage ubiquitinations are the 2 main forms of polyubiq-
uitination, responsible for 52% and 38% of all ubiquitination 
events in HEK293 cells, respectively (68). K48-linked polyubiq-
uitin chains are involved in proteasome-dependent degrada-
tion, while K63-linked ubiquitination is a docking site for medi-
ating protein-protein interactions or conformational changes. 
However, recent studies have also shown that K63-linked ubiq-
uitination can mediate protein degradation. Sic1, dihydrofolate 
reductase, cyclin B1, and troponin 1 are all targeted for prote-
asome-dependent degradation mediated by the K63 linkage 
ubiquitination (69–72). STUB1 interacts with HIF1A and medi-
ates its K63-linked ubiquitination, leading to the degradation 
of HIF1A through the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway 
(73). K63-linked ubiquitination was also reported to selectively 
facilitate the clearance of inclusions associated with neurode-
generative diseases via autophagy (74).
TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that catalyzes lysine 
63–linked (K63-linked) polyubiquitination and functions in Toll-
like receptor signaling (75) and oncogenic activation of Akt (42). 
But it is also found to mediate KIF23 degradation through an auto-
phagy pathway (76). The TRAF6-binding consensus sequence 
(PxExxAr/Ac) is a highly conserved protein–protein interaction 
motif (77, 78) that mediates the binding between TRAF6 and its 
substrates. We also found this conserved motif in DNMTs. Our 
experiments with endogenous immunopreciptation further con-
firmed the interaction of TRAF6 and DNMTs. TRAF6 contains a 
TRAF-C domain, a coiled-coil domain, 5 zinc fingers, and a RING 
domain (40). TRAF6 deletion constructs also showed TRAF6 
binding to DNMTs through its TRAF-C domain, a domain that is 
known to bind to many TRAF6 substrates (78). The interactions

DNMT3A (catalog 31406) and His-tagged DNMT3B (catalog 31413) 
were purchased from Active Motif.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. Methods used 
for performing immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were 
described previously (87). Specifically, cells were lysed with sonica-
tion in NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 
10 mM NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Whole cell lysates were 
obtained by centrifugation and were then incubated with 4 μg anti-
bodies and protein A/G sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 
4°C overnight. The immunocomplexes were then washed 3 times with 
ice-cold NETN buffer. Proteins were eluted in 1× SDS loading buffer 
and then subjected to Western blot.
Dot blot assay for detecting global methylation. The dot blot has been 
previously described (88). Briefly, isolated DNA was denatured in 0.1 
M NaOH for 10 minutes at 95°C. Samples were neutralized with 1 M 
NH4OAC on ice, diluted by 2-fold, and spotted on the Immobilon-Ny+ 
Charged Nylon Membrane (MilliporeSigma). The blotted membrane 
was then washed in 2× SSC buffer, dried at 80°C for 5 minutes, and 
UV cross-linked at 120,000 μJ/cm2. The membrane was then blocked 
in Odyssey buffer (Li-Cor) diluted 1:1 in PBS overnight at 4°C. Mouse 
anti-5mC monoclonal antibody (Active Motif, 1:500) in Odyssey PBS 
was added for 3 hours at room temperature.
Colony-formation assay. Cells were treated with the indicated 
concentrations of decitabine for 7 days and changed to fresh medium 
for another 5 to 10 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 to allow colony formation. 
Colonies were then stained with 5% GIEMSA and counted. Results 
were generated from 3 independent experiments and normalized for 
plating efficiencies.
CRISPR/Cas9-KO. For CRISPR/Cas9-KO of human TRAF6 
in MDA-MB-231 cells, the following small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) 
were used: sgTRAF6-1 (5′-AGTTGACAATGAAATACTGC-3′) and 
sgTRAF6-2 (5′-ACGTGAGATTCTTTCTCTGA-3′). The sg 
RNA 
sequences were cloned into the vector Lenti CRISPR-V2-puro. 
Cells were infected with Lenti-TRAF6-sgRNA-puro, followed by 
extensive selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Single colonies were 
obtained by serial dilution and amplification. Clones were identi-
fied by immunoblotting with anti-TRAF6 antibody and were veri-
fied by DNA sequencing.
mRNA extraction and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 
indicated cells using Quick-RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was per-
formed with the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (AB) using 
the Stratagene Mx3005P Real-Time PCR Detection System (Strat-
agene). The primers for different genes tested were purchased from 
QIAGEN. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
For further information, see Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures.
Statistics. The statistical data were generated from 3 indepen-
dent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by 2-tailed 
Student’s t test for 2-group comparisons and by 1-way ANOVA along 
with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons (comparing to control group) 
wherever appropriate.
Study approval. All animal studies were reviewed and approved 
by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(A17713, A43112, and A35715).
PDX tumor dissociation and human breast cancer cell isolation. 
When tumors grew to 1 cm in diameter, tumors were dissected and 
weighed. For tissue dissociation, a portion of tumor tissue was dissect-
ed and cut into 2 mm3 sections in sterile PBS and incubated with 5 ml of 
the enzyme mix from a human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Bio-
tech) prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Tissue was 
digested at 37°C with rotation on a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi 
Biotech) program for “dissociation of tough tumors” according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. The digested cell mixture was passed 
through a 70 μm MACS SmartStrainer, then a 40 μm MACS Smart-
Strainer to obtain the single-cell suspension. Dissociated cells were 
then spun down and washed with precooled washing buffer. Purified 
breast cancer tumor cells were obtained by removing the mouse cells 
using the Mouse Cell Depletion Purification Kit (Miltenyi Biotech) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Formation of spheroids from PDX tumors and evaluation of decit-
abine response. For 3D cell culture, we used ultralow attachment 
NanoCulture Plate (NCP) (Scivax Corp), which is a scaffold-based 3D 
culture system that easily allows tumors to form spheroids (86). 50 μl 
MEF full medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamax 
[Life Technologies], 1% sodium pyruvate [Life Technologies], nones-
sential amino acids [Life Technologies], and 1% penicillin-strepto-
mycin [Life Technologies]) with 5 μM ROCK inhibitor (Tocris) was 
placed into each well of a 96-well NanoCulture plate. Plates were 
spun at 300 g, and cells were then seeded at a final density of 2 × 104 
cells in 90 μl medium. Growth medium was changed at day 7 using 
full MEF medium without adding ROCK inhibitor. Tumor spheroids 
were then incubated with various concentrations of decitabine for 
another 7 days. Fresh decitabine was added daily. Cell spheroids were 
counted using a Nikon Eclipse Ts100 (Nikon Instruments Inc.), and 
the susceptibility of the cells to decitabine was investigated using the 
percentage of viability.
Cell culture. Human breast cancer Hs 578T (HTB-126), MDA-
MB-231 (HTB-26), BT-549 (HTB-122), and HEK 293T cells were 
purchased from ATCC. Hs 578T and HEK 293T cells were cultured 
in DMEM (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% FBS in 
37°C with 5% CO2. BT-549 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% FBS in 37°C with 5% CO2. 
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (ATCC) 
containing 10% FBS in 37°C without CO2.
Breast cancer tumor spheroids were cultured in full MEF medium 
of DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 100 U/
ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies), 2 mM Glutamax (Life 
Technologies), 1 × MEM NEAA (Thermo Fisher), and 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (Corning) with or without 5 μM ROCK inhibitor (Tocris).
Chemicals, antibodies and plasmids. S/FLAG/SBP-tagged TRAF6 
construct was generated using TRAF6-WT plasmids purchased from 
Origen. All mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis 
(Stratagene), and sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing. Anti-
bodies against DNMT1 (catalog 5032S) and DNMT3A (catalog 3598S, 
2160S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse 
monoclonal DNMT3B antibody (clone 52A1018) was purchased from
