Abstract
Background
The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine prevented Ebola virus disease when used at 2 × 107 pla-
que-forming units (PFU) in a trial in Guinea. This study provides further safety and immuno-
genicity data.
Methods and findings
A randomised, open-label phase I trial in Lambare
´ne
´, Gabon, studied 5 single intramuscular
vaccine doses of 3 × 103, 3 × 104, 3 × 105, 3 × 106, or 2 × 107 PFU in 115 adults and a dose
of 2 × 107 PFU in 20 adolescents and 20 children. The primary objective was safety and tol-
erability 28 days post-injection. Immunogenicity, viraemia, and shedding post-vaccination
were evaluated as secondary objectives. In adults, mild-to-moderate adverse events were
frequent, but there were no serious or severe adverse events related to vaccination. Before
vaccination, Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV)–glycoprotein (GP)–specific and ZEBOV antibodies

 were detected in 11% and 27% of adults, respectively. In adults, 74%–100% of individuals
who received a dose 3 × 104, 3 × 105, 3 × 106, or 2 × 107 PFU had a �4.0-fold increase in
geometric mean titres (GMTs) of ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies at day 28, reaching GMTs
of 489 (95% CI: 264–908), 556 (95% CI: 280–1,101), 1,245 (95% CI: 899–1,724), and 1,503
(95% CI: 931–2,426), respectively. Twenty-two percent of adults had a �4-fold increase of
ZEBOV antibodies, with GMTs at day 28 of 1,015 (647–1,591), 1,887 (1,154–3,085), 1,445
(1,013–2,062), and 3,958 (2,249–6,967) for the same doses, respectively. These antibodies
persisted up to day 180 for doses �3 × 105 PFU. Adults with antibodies before vaccination
had higher GMTs throughout. Neutralising antibodies were detected in more than 50% of
participants at doses �3 × 105 PFU. As in adults, no serious or severe adverse events
related to vaccine occurred in adolescents or children. At day 2, vaccine RNA titres were
higher for adolescents and children than adults. At day 7, 78% of adolescents and 35% of
children had recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus RNA detectable in saliva. The vaccine
induced high GMTs of ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies at day 28 in adolescents, 1,428 (95%
CI: 1,025–1,989), and children, 1,620 (95% CI: 806–3,259), and in both groups antibody
titres increased up to day 180. The absence of a control group, lack of stratification for base-
line antibody status, and imbalances in male/female ratio are the main limitations of this
study.
Conclusions
Our data confirm the acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile of the 2 × 107 PFU dose
in adults and support consideration of lower doses for paediatric populations and those who
request boosting.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• The worst Ebola outbreak in history ended in 2016 after killing about 11,323 individuals
and infecting 28,650 individuals worldwide.
• This public health emergency accelerated efforts to develop a vaccine as part of the strat-
egy to contain the outbreak.
• Two vaccine candidates with preclinical safety and efficacy data obtained from non-
human primates entered human trials.
• The one used in our study is the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, containing a non-infec-
tious portion of a gene from the Zaire Ebola virus introduced into a recombinant vesic-
ular stomatitis virus (rVSV), which itself is unlikely to cause disease in humans.
• To generate data for deployment of the vaccine, several dose-ranging phase I trials were
initiated across centres in the United States, Europe, and Africa.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• We allocated 115 adults aged 18–50 years to receive 1 of the 5 doses used in the trial. A
single intramuscular dose ranging from 3 × 103 to 2 × 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)
was given, and participants were followed up until 6 months post-injection for safety
and immunogenicity.
• Preliminary results led to the selection of the 2 × 107 PFU dose for further development.
• We also included 20 adolescents (13–17 years) and 20 children (6–12 years), who
received the 2 × 107 PFU dose and were followed-up in a similar way as the adults.
• No vaccine-related serious or severe adverse event was reported by any participant.
• A high proportion of our population—even though residing in an area with no history
of Ebola outbreak—had pre-vaccination antibodies specific to the Zaire Ebola virus.
• In adults, antibodies persisted up to 6 months post-injection at doses of 3 × 105 to 2 ×
107 PFU.
• In participants with baseline antibodies, a dose as low as 3 × 104 PFU could induce high
antibody titres up to day 56 post-injection.
• Higher vaccine replication, leading to shedding of the vaccine in saliva and urine,
occurred in children and adolescents.
What do these findings mean?
• Our results and other findings show that this vaccine is safe and immunogenic.
• Lower vaccine doses may be needed in paediatric populations as well as for boosting
after primary vaccination or naturally acquired immunity.
Introduction
The western African Ebola virus disease (EVD) public health emergency of international
concern ended in June 2016 [1], after infecting approximately 28,650 individuals, of whom
11,323 died [2,3]. Global commitment led to landmarks in vaccine development against
EVD, with 8 candidates out of 15 undergoing evaluation in phase I–III clinical trials world-
wide by the end of 2015 [4–6]. A live-attenuated recombinant vaccine consisting of the
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), strain Indiana, with the gene for the Kikwit-95 Zaire Ebola
virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP) replacing the VSV glycoprotein (G) had given acceptable
results in non-human primate challenge models and was selected for accelerated clinical
development. In European and African populations, the VEBCON Consortium (VSV-EBola
CONsortium) carried out parallel dose-escalation phase I trials of the recombinant VSV
(rVSV)–ZEBOV candidate vaccine in Germany (NCT02283099), Kenya (NCT02296983),
and Gabon (PACTR2014000089322) and a double-blind phase I/II randomised controlled

 trial in Switzerland (NCT02287480). Three further phase II/III trials were later launched in
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Results from phase I trials in the US [7] and preclinical
data supported selection of the 2 × 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) dose as the most immu-
nogenic for phase IIb/III trials in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. A final analysis of the
Guinea trial showed that a single dose of 2 × 107 PFU given immediately after contact with
an index case was 100% (95% CI: 70%–100%, P = 0.0045) efficacious in preventing EVD in
individuals, and protected the population through a ring vaccination strategy 10 days or
more post-vaccination [8].
Detailed dose-ranging studies (3 × 105, 3 × 106, 1 × 107, 2 × 107, and 5 × 107 PFU) at the 4
VEBCON sites showed acceptable safety, dose-dependent reactogenicity [9], and high sero-
conversion rates among all participants on day 28 after vaccination [9,10].
In Gabon, 2 seroprevalence studies in epidemic and non-epidemic regions showed varying
proportions of participants with pre-vaccination ZEBOV-specific IgG antibodies [11,12]. In
Lambare
´ne
´, with no reported EVD outbreak, ZEBOV-GP-specific antibody responses after
vaccination were similar at 2 tested doses (3 × 105 and 3 × 106 PFU) [9]. This finding con-
trasted with that in vaccinees in Geneva, where antibody titres at 3 × 105 PFU were signifi-
cantly lower than responses to higher vaccine doses, including 1 × 107 PFU and 5 × 107 PFU
[10]. Additionally, irrespective of vaccine dose, delayed oligoarthritis and skin and mucous
membrane lesions emerged as vaccine-related adverse events in a proportion of recipients
more than 1 week after vaccination in Geneva [10]. These delayed complications were not
observed in Gabon, despite the fact that the same vaccine batch and similar doses were used
[9].
Because of these divergent site-specific observations, we need further assessments of the
vaccine in Ebola virus endemic areas as well as in children. We present a comparison of safety
and immunogenicity outcomes in participants vaccinated with (1) 2 × 107 PFU, the dose used
in the efficacy trial; (2) 2 previously reported doses, 3 × 106 and 3 × 105 PFU [9]; and (3) 2
lower doses, 3 × 104 PFU and 3 × 103 PFU, in African adults. Furthermore, we report, to our
knowledge for the first time, on children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years vaccinated with
2 × 107 PFU.
Methods
Study design and participants
The trial protocol was approved by the Scientific Review Committee of Centre de Recherches
Me
´dicales de Lambare
´ne
´ (CERMEL), the Institutional Ethics Committee of CERMEL, the
National Ethics Committee of Gabon, the World Health Organization (WHO) Ethics Com-
mittee, and the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Universita
¨tsklinikum Tu
¨bingen. The
trial was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201411000919191).
The study was a randomised, open-label, dose-escalation phase I trial at CERMEL in
Gabon. The trial was initially designed to escalate doses to 3 × 105, 3 × 106, and 2 × 107 PFU in
60 adults. After successive protocol amendments, a total of 115 adults (18–50 years), 20 adoles-
cents (13–17 years), and 20 children (6–12 years) were enrolled, between 17 November 2014
and 7 July 2015. Written informed consent was obtained from adults and parents/guardians of
adolescents/children, and written assent from minors aged 11–17 years, prior to study-related
procedures (details are in S3 Text).
Healthy consenting volunteers who were aged 6–50 years and resident in the study area—
which had no history of an Ebola outbreak—and willing to minimise blood/body fluid expo-
sure to their relatives for 5 days post-vaccination were included. Field workers used the door-
to-door approach to invite individuals from the Lambare
´ne
´ community to screen for the

 study. After screening, individuals with a history of severe local or systemic allergic reaction to
vaccination, known allergy to constituents of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, or any acute
or chronic clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition were excluded. All pregnant
and lactating women were excluded. Volunteers who received a licensed vaccine within 14
days (or 30 days for a live vaccine), had a history of blood donation within 60 days prior to vac-
cination, were positive for HIV and/or hepatitis B or C virus infection, or had an immunocom-
promised member in the family were also excluded from the study.
Randomisation and treatment allocation
Randomisation and allocation was performed by an independent investigator from 17 Novem-
ber 2014 until 13 April 2015 using a web-generated sequence. Randomisation in permuted
blocks was performed in 2 stages. In the first, participants were assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to
3 × 105, 3 × 106, and 2 × 107 PFU, and in the second stage, in a ratio of 1:1 to 3 × 103 and
3 × 104 PFU. On 9 December 2014, a temporary consortium-wide safety hold was placed on
doses above 1 × 107 PFU due to adverse events reported at the Swiss site with doses of 1 × 107
and 5 × 107 PFU. In Gabon, only 1 participant had been allocated to the 2 × 107 PFU dose. In
all, 20, 20, 1, 20, and 20 adults were randomised to a vaccine dose of 3 × 105, 3 × 106, 2 × 107,
3 × 103, and 3 × 104 PFU, respectively. Preliminary data from the 20 participants vaccinated
with 3 × 105 PFU and the initial 19 vaccinated with 3 × 106 PFU were previously reported [9].
An unblinded safety review of VEBCON Consortium trials by the data and safety monitor-
ing board lifted the safety hold on 5 January 2015. After this and during the third stage of the
study, 19 adults were vaccinated with 3 × 106 PFU without randomisation. In addition, Merck
Sharp & Dohme selected the 2 × 107 PFU dose for further development, as being the most
immunogenic dose with an acceptable safety profile (S. Gupta, oral presentation at the WHO
Ebola Research and Development Summit, 11–12 May 2015, Geneva) [13,14]. A subsequent
amendment included 20 adolescents and 20 children aged 13 to 17 years and 6 to 12 years,
respectively, to be vaccinated with 2 × 107 PFU. The National Ethics Committee of Gabon rec-
ommended that adults from this population should be vaccinated with the intended dose
before administration to the paediatric cohorts, so an additional 15 adults were included in the
study (S3 Text).
Vaccine and vaccination procedures
The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, developed by the Canadian National Laboratory under the
patent number WO2004011488 A2 and licensed to BioProtection Systems (NewLink Genet-
ics), was the unique intervention in this trial. The vaccine was subsequently sublicensed to
Merck and was manufactured at IDT Biologika (Dessau-Rosslau, Germany). WHO supplied
single-dose vials of 1 × 108 PFU (lot no 0030513) to conduct the trial at CERMEL, from a
donation of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP by the Canadian government to WHO. The dispensed vials
were reconstituted in serial dilutions for vaccination. A single injection of 1 ml of the reconsti-
tuted vaccine for the required dose was administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle
of volunteers at vaccination (S1 Fig).
Safety assessments
The nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events constituted the primary safety endpoint
of the trial. Local and systemic reactogenicity symptoms and signs (solicited adverse events)
were recorded for 14 days post-injection. Unsolicited adverse events, including laboratory
anomalies, were recorded up to 28 days post-injection. Detailed descriptions of all serious

 adverse events were recorded throughout the study follow-up visits, as a secondary safety
endpoint.
Solicited adverse events (pain, swelling, redness) were obtained by direct examination of
the injection site, or direct questioning when follow-up occurred by telephone. Arthralgia and
arthritic symptoms were later added as a solicited adverse event upon the request of the data
and safety monitoring board. Participants were asked specifically if they were experiencing
these symptoms.
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP viraemia and shedding
Plasma, saliva, and urine samples (at screening and days 1, 2, and 7 post-vaccination) were
processed and stored in Trizol LS at the study site, until rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP viral load deter-
minations were performed by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR as a secondary outcome.
The lower limit of detection for rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP RNA was 30 copies/ml, and the lower
level of quantification was 100 copies/ml [9].
Immunological assessments
As a secondary objective, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed on
days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 180 after injection. ZEBOV-specific antibody assays were conducted at
the Institute for Virology, Marburg. Antibodies were detected using an antibody capture
ELISA based on inactivated Ebola Zaire Makona virus particles [15]. ELISA for ZEBOV-GP-
specific antibodies was performed at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases (USAMRIID) using the Kikwit-95 ZEBOV strain GP (standard operating procedure
AP-03-35-00). Antibodies were reported as geometric mean titres (GMTs), or geometric mean
concentrations, of arbitrary ELISA units (AEU) per millilitre with 95% confidence intervals, as
indicated.
Neutralising antibodies (Nabs) were detected using either particles of Ebola virus (Zaire iso-
late Mayinga, AF086833), with the assays being performed in a BSL4 laboratory (Institute for
Virology, Marburg), or VSV pseudovirions expressing the luciferase reporter gene comple-
mented by GP from the Kikwit-95 ZEBOV strain, with assays being performed at USAMRIID.
All 4 assays were previously reported by our team [9,15] and other researchers working on
this candidate vaccine in the US [7].
Statistical analysis
WHO estimated that a sample size of 74–124 participants would be needed across the VEB-
CON Consortium sites to show a 2-fold change in ZEBOV-specific antibody titres between
vaccine doses and proposed a target sample size of approximately 250 participants for all sites
[10]. We described the frequency and intensity of adverse events using counts and percentages,
means and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), for skewed con-
tinuous variables. Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare pairwise propor-
tions. Seropositivity rates were defined as the percentage of participants having AEU above a
cutoff per vaccine group. Seroconversion rates were defined as the percentage of converted
participants in each group. McNemar’s test was used to compare the seropositivity between
day 0 and other days. We used Fisher’s test to perform inter-group comparisons and to deter-
mine the association between the seroconversion rate and seropositivity rate at each time
point. Antibody concentrations or units were normalised using log transformations, and
responses are reported as GMTs with 95% confidence intervals or geometric mean of AEU per
millilitre with 95% confidence intervals. Student’s test or Wilcoxon’s paired test was used to
compare magnitudes of antibody induced between day 0 and other days. All statistical analyses

 were conducted in R statistical software version 3.1.2 [16], except for viraemias (copies/millili-
tre of plasma), which were analysed with a Kruskal–Wallis test combined with Dunn’s multiple
comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 6.
Results
From 21 November 2014 to 13 April 2015, 115 adults were vaccinated with a single injection
of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP at 5 different doses. Twenty adolescents and 20 children were vacci-
nated between 8 May and 7 July 2015 (Fig 1).
Safety and immunogenicity data are reported until month 6 for adults, adolescents, and
children for all 155 participants. In all, 108 (93%) adults and 36 (90%) adolescents and children
attended all planned immunogenicity visits. Mean age and body mass index were similar
among the 5 adult cohorts, with 21 adult women enrolled in the trial (Table 1).
Assessment of 5 vaccine doses in adult volunteers
Reactogenicity and tolerability.
Headaches, fatigue, pain at injection site, gastrointestinal
symptoms, and subjective fever were the most frequent symptoms. Of these, 68% were mild
and 32% moderately intense, with similar frequencies up to day 28 across cohorts in adults.
There were no vaccine-related severe adverse events (Tables 2 and S1).
Monocytes increased and lymphocytes decreased in the first week after vaccination in a
dose-dependent fashion (S5 Table).
Mild-to-moderate symptoms reported at days 56, 84, and 180 and during unscheduled vis-
its were considered unrelated to the study vaccine (S4 Table). Few haematological or biochem-
ical changes of clinical significance were captured as adverse events, and these were followed
up until resolution without sequelae.
A total of 11 adult participants experienced a serious adverse event. Six participants had
malaria requiring hospitalisation, 2 underwent surgery due to appendicitis, and 1 was diag-
nosed with glaucoma. The last probably had the condition prior to enrolment after a detailed
history was obtained, and is now receiving specialised care. Two individuals were hospitalised
for bleeding after dental surgery and gastritis, respectively. All of these events were judged
unrelated to the vaccine. Three women became pregnant after vaccination; they were moni-
tored until delivery. Their neonates had no safety complications.
Immunogenicity.
Eleven adults were excluded from either sampling and/or analysis of
immunogenicity data: a male participant was HIV positive, 3 women became pregnant beyond
day 28 after vaccination, and 7 participants received anti-tetanus vaccine/immunoglobulin.
These participants were not sampled on subsequent visits (days 56, 84, and 180).
ZEBOV-GP-specific and ZEBOV antibodies.
In all, 70%–100% of adult participants vac-
cinated with all doses �3 × 104 PFU reached a greater than 4.0-fold increase of ZEBOV-GP-
specific GMT at day 28. ZEBOV-GP antibody GMTs peaked at day 56, with antibody levels
persistently higher than baseline up to 6 months post-vaccination (Table 3).
About 11% (13/114) of adult participants had ZEBOV-GP-specific ELISA antibody
concentrations > 200 AEU/ml at baseline. The proportions of individuals with high concen-
trations at baseline were inconsistent across vaccine groups and ranged from 0% to 25%. Anti-
body concentrations were significantly higher at day 56 post-vaccination in individuals with
prior antibodies following vaccination with doses of 3 × 103, 3 × 104, and 3 × 106 PFU
(Table 4).
The whole-virion assay is a less sensitive method to detect vaccine-induced antibody
responses, which are directed against GP; 34% and 63% of vaccinees who received a dose equal
to or more than 3 × 105 PFU reached a greater than 2.0-fold increase in ZEBOV antibody

 GMT at day 28 and 56, respectively. Only 40% (30/74) of participants in the dose groups
3 × 105, 3 × 106, and 2 × 107 PFU had a greater than 2.0-fold increase in antibody persisting up
to 6 months post-injection (Table 5).
About 27% (31/115) of adults had ZEBOV antibody concentrations > 500 AEU/ml at base-
line, with inconsistent frequencies (5% to 56%) across dose levels. In adults with pre-vaccina-
tion antibodies, a dose as low as 3 × 104 PFU yielded a 2-fold increase in ZEBOV antibodies
post-injection. Regardless of baseline status, the highest antibody titres were observed with the
2 × 107 PFU dose (Table 6).
Neutralising antibodies.
Nabs for doses of 3 × 104, 3 × 105, 3 × 106, and 2 × 107 were
detected in 52%, 55%, 82%, and 62% of recipients against VSV-based Ebola pseudovirions
(pseudovirion neutralisation assay 50% [PsVNA50]), respectively, and in 70%, 84%, and 56%
of recipients against ZEBOV virus particles. The highest Nab GMTs were observed in recipi-
ents of 2 × 107 PFU. About 35%, 13%, and 25% of participants in the dose groups 3 × 105,
3 × 106, and 2 × 107 PFU, respectively, had baseline Nabs against ZEBOV virus particles
(defined as GMT > GMT + SD at D0). Higher Nab GMTs were observed at day 28 regardless
of baseline antibody status (Tables 7, S8 and S9).
The vaccine dose of 2 × 107 PFU in adult, adolescent, and child
volunteers
Reactogenicity and tolerability.
Twenty adolescents aged 13–17 years and 20 children
aged 6–12 years were vaccinated with 1 intramuscular dose of 2 × 107 PFU. Adolescents and
children reported mostly headaches, fatigue, pain at injection site, gastrointestinal symptoms,
and subjective fever. All reported symptoms were of mild (81% adolescents, 82% children) to
moderate (19% adolescents, 18% children) intensity (Table 2).
As in adults, a general reduction in leukocyte counts was observed in adolescents and chil-
dren within the first 2 days post-injection; leukocytes gradually restored to baseline values by
day 28. An increase in monocyte and lymphocyte counts was observed between days 2 and 7,

serious or severe adverse events occurred. One child was hospitalised for malaria.
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP viraemia and shedding.
Compared to adults vaccinated with
2 × 107 PFU, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP RNA copy numbers in both adolescents and children were
significantly higher at 1,592 (IQR 1,019–2,704) and 1,109 (IQR 663–1,963), respectively, versus
532 (IQR 373–898) in adults (P = 0.001) at day 2 post-injection (Table 8).
For viral shedding, there was a low percentage of positive samples at day 2, albeit below the
level of quantification. At day 7, there was 1 child and 1 adolescent who had quantifiable RNA

ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies are expressed in GMTs with 95% confidence intervals. Seropositivity is defined by geometric mean concentration > 200
AEU/ml. Seroresponse is defined by a �4-fold rise in GMT. P values < 0.05 are given in bold.
*Time point in day(s) since vaccination.
†Wilcoxon’s test for paired data. P < 0.05 indicates a statistical difference in antibody titre between day 0 and other days.
‡McNemar’s test. P < 0.05 indicates a statistical difference in seropositivity rate between day 0 and other days (28, 56, and 84 days post-vaccination).
ΩFisher’s test. P < 0.05 indicates a statistical association between seropositivity and seroresponse for each time point.
βWilcoxon’s test for paired data. P < 0.05 indicates a statistical difference in antibody titre between day 180 post-vaccination and days 28, 56, and 84 post-

dren had detectable RNA, corresponding with peak viraemia at day 2. At day 7, a considerably
higher proportion of adolescents and children, 78% and 35% respectively, had RNA-positive
saliva, with most samples being quantifiable (Figs 2 and S2; S13–S15 Tables).

 Antibody titres were similar between adolescents, adults, and children using GP ELISA regard-
less of baseline antibody status (Figs 3, 4, S3 and S4).
By day 28, 70% and 60% of adolescents and children, respectively, were seropositive with
whole-virion ELISA, compared to 81% of adults injected with 2 × 107 PFU. Using a more sen-
sitive GP ELISA, we obtained higher seropositivity rates, 100%, 100%, and 90% for adults, ado-
lescents, and children, respectively, at day 28. We observed a �4-fold increase in ZEBOV-GP-
specific antibody titres in about 90%–100% of adults, adolescents, and children consistently
from day 28 to 180 post-injection. However, ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies increased up to

 day 180 in children and adolescents (Table 9), while in adults, it peaked at day 56, and there
was a decline until day 180 (Tables 3 and 5).
Lower proportions of adults, adolescents, and children had a �4-fold increase in ZEBOV
antibodies with whole-virion ELISA. Considering a �2-fold increase for this less sensitive
ELISA, the yielded proportions were still much lower than those seen with GP ELISA. How-
ever, the proportion of adolescents and children with a �2- or �4-fold increase in ZEBOV
antibodies increased from day 28 to 56, in contrast to the lack of difference between these time
points in adults (Tables 5, 6 and S6). Thirteen percent of the children, but none of the adoles-
cents, were seropositive for ZEBOV antibodies at baseline. None of the children and 7% of the
adolescents were seropositive for ZEBOV-GP antibodies at baseline. As in adults, children
with ZEBOV antibodies at baseline had higher GMTs at days 28 and 56 compared to those
without baseline antibodies (Tables 6 and S7).
Neutralising antibodies.
Against VSV pseudovirions, about 73% of children and adoles-
cents elicited Nabs, with higher GMTs occurring at day 56 compared to day 28. In all, 95% and
80% of children and adolescents, respectively, had ZEBOV Nabs at day 28. Overall, children
produced significantly higher GMTs of Nabs against ZEBOV particles (20 [95% CI: 13–32]
compared to adolescents and adults, 10 [95% CI: 8–14] and 10 [95% CI: 6–14], respectively,
P = 0.04) (S10–S12 Tables).
Discussion
Although the 2014–2016 EVD emergency in western Africa has ended, the increasing mobility
of people between remote and urban areas and the weak health systems in Ebolavirus endemic
countries suggest that a future outbreak could reassert itself as a major international threat
[17,18]. Risks include increased human-to-human secondary transmission as in the recent epi-
demic [19] as well as continuing transmission after recovery. Halting transmission by vaccina-
tion will be key in curbing future outbreaks [20]. The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP and ChAd3-
ZEBOV vaccine candidates were selected by WHO in August 2014 for fast track clinical evalu-
ation [6]. As part of these efforts, we examined a range of doses for rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in
adults as well as safety and immunogenicity in children.
As reported earlier, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP doses of 3 × 105 and 3 × 106 PFU were well tolerated
by 39 Lambare
´ne
´ participants until day 28 and were safe up to 6 months [9]. Comparable to studies

 in Guinea [21] and US adults [7], transient cases of arthralgia were reported after vaccination
[9,21,22], but no case of arthritis. In Kilifi, Kenya, there were 2 self-limiting, low-severity, and
short-duration cases of arthritis [9,23]. This contrasts with a higher frequency of vaccine-induced
arthritis (24%), dermatitis (9.8%), and vasculitis (2%) in Geneva [9,10,24] and more recently in
Canada, the US, and Spain [25]. There may be similarities between rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine
and rubella vaccine, which also causes transient arthritides in some populations [26–28].
Ongoing studies are investigating the potential mechanisms by which rVSVΔG-ZE-
BOV-GP vaccine might disseminate into peripheral tissues and induce arthritides in specific
hosts. The magnitude of innate immune responses to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine correlated
with the peak of rVSV RNA at day 1 in vaccinees of both Geneva and Lambare
´ne
´ cohorts [29].
Importantly, high-dose vaccinees who experienced arthritis in Geneva had a significantly
lower magnitude of early immune response compared to high-dose vaccinees who did not
experience arthritis. These findings suggest that early and appropriate (in nature and magni-
tude) innate immune responses play a key role in limiting viral replication and dissemination
to tissues and thus prevent the risk of arthritis. With lower vaccine dose (3 × 105 PFU), the
strength of early innate immune responses was similar in cases both with and without arthritis.
Thus, rVSV-ZEBOV-induced arthritis may occur through mechanisms related to either vac-
cine dose or underlying factors that influence immune responses in vaccinees [29].
We observed higher and persistent viraemia in children and adolescents as well as shedding
in saliva and urine, in contrast to the very low proportions or no shedding previously reported
in the saliva of American and European adults vaccinated with 3 × 106 to 5 × 107 PFU [7,9,10].
The shedding in saliva did not correlate with oral symptoms. Although no alarming symptoms
have been detected so far, our finding suggests that a vaccine dose of 2 × 107 PFU exposed the
paediatric population to prolonged or uncontrolled viraemia, with potential to disseminate to
peripheral tissues. Specific studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms pro-
longing viraemia and causing shedding, such as differences in innate responses to vaccine
between adults and younger participants. It is also necessary to assess any potential dissemina-
tion of rVSV-ZEBOV among household members of vaccinated children.
We observed dose-dependent antibody responses to the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. A
very low dose (�3 × 103 PFU) did not generate antibodies measured with either whole-virion
or ZEBOV-GP-specific ELISA. In all individuals vaccinated with 3 × 104, 3 × 105, 3 × 106, and
2 × 107 PFU, the vaccine induced significant increases in ZEBOV-GP-specific antibodies mea-
sured by ZEBOV-GP ELISA alone for 3 × 104 PFU and by both whole-virion and GP ELISAs
for the other vaccine doses. The highest GMTs were observed with 2 × 107 PFU irrespective of
the ELISA method used.
As previously reported [9,11,12], our participants harboured naturally acquired antibodies
against ZEBOV, or possibly related viruses. Western blot analysis of sub-samples showed that
these antibodies were directed more often against nucleocapsid and matrix proteins of
ZEBOV and not against GP. Nonetheless, 11% of our adults had ZEBOV-GP-specific antibod-
ies before vaccination using the GP-specific ELISA. Individuals with baseline antibodies devel-
oped higher antibody titres with a dose as low as 3 × 104 PFU compared to those without. The
vaccine may have elicited higher titres of antibodies in the presence of natural GP-specific anti-
bodies but also in the presence of antibodies directed against other viral components including
nucleocapsid and matrix proteins (detected in baseline sera of some study participants) [9].
In adults, vaccine-induced antibodies peaked at day 56 and declined slowly by day 180. In
children and adolescents, who showed high viraemia at day 2 and shed the vaccine until day 7,
antibody titres increased until day 180. The kinetics of antibodies after vaccination may be
affected by the specificity of pre-existing antibodies, and persistent vaccine replication may
enhance immunogenicity. Also, the highest titres of Nabs against Ebola virus, which paralleled

 those against VSV pseudovirions, were generated at day 28 post-injection, regardless of base-
line seropositivity. The relative roles of neutralising, GP, and non-GP antibodies in protection
against EVD remain undefined, so it is difficult to draw conclusions on the clinical significance
of correlations between GP-binding and neutralising antibodies produced after vaccinations.
The vaccine dose of 2 × 107 PFU showed the optimal safety versus immunogenicity balance
in our adult cohorts as well as in the Geneva and Hamburg cohorts [29,30]. These findings
support the choice to use this dose in the context of outbreaks [8]. However, our data cannot
explain the protection induced by the vaccine within 10 days observed in a phase III trial in
Guinea [8] as the seroconversion rates and antibody titres were very weak before day 28 irre-
spective of the vaccine dose. Innate immune components induced immediately after vaccina-
tion may have played an important role in early protection. A recent study demonstrated the
direct influence of innate immune responses on this vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity [29],
a finding which supports the interest in assessing the efficacy of this vaccine beyond Zaire ebo-
lavirus spp. as innate mechanisms can be cross-reactive.
Lower doses could be considered in vaccination strategies for children and individuals with
impaired innate immune responses to control early rVSV replication. The dose of 3 × 105 PFU
generated significantly fewer rVSV RNA copies and shorter rVSV replication cycles but high
antibody titres, so is of interest. As an incidental finding in our area, where Ebola virus trans-
mission is endemic, a proportion of participants had antibodies directed against the whole-
virus or GP-specific antigen before vaccination [11,12,31]. In those participants, a vaccine
dose as low as 3 × 104 PFU induced high antibody titres, suggesting lower vaccine doses should
be considered in boosting strategies.
There are some limitations of our observations. For example, we cannot relate viral shed-
ding in saliva with the oral symptoms reported by adolescents and children, suggesting that
further studies are needed to evaluate this finding. We did not stratify participants based on
antibody status at enrolment; future studies in Ebola virus endemic areas where such stratifica-
tion is inherent in the design will provide insights into the relationships between naturally
acquired antibodies and vaccine-induced immune responses and safety. We enrolled very few
women across cohorts, leading to imbalances in the male/female ratio in our trial, which may
reflect the general reluctance of women to enrol in phase I studies.
Our study confirms the acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile of the 2 × 107 PFU
dose in adults. However, considering the persistent replication of the rVSVΔGP-ZEBOV-GP
vaccine in children and adolescents, further studies investigating lower doses in this popula-
tion are warranted. In addition, lower vaccine doses should be considered when boosting indi-
viduals with pre-existing antibodies.
