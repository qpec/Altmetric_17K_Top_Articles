Abstract
 Objective—To determine treatment frequency and duration of H2RA/PPI use among infants 
hospitalized within US children’s hospital NICUs and evaluate diagnoses/demographic factors 
associated with use.
 Study design—We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of NICU infants admitted to 43 US 
children’s hospitals within the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database between 
January 2006-March 2013 to determine H2RA/PPI treatment frequency, timing/duration of 
treatment, factors associated with use, percent of infants remaining on treatment at discharge, and 
inter-hospital prescribing variation. We used a modified Poisson regression to calculate the 
adjusted probability of infants ever receiving H2RAs/PPIs in relation to diagnosis, gestation, and 
sex.
 Results—Of the 122,002 infants evaluated, 23.8% (n=28,989) ever received an H2RA or PPI; 
19.0% received H2RAs (n=23187) and 10.5% (n=12823) received PPIs. Extremely preterm infants 
and term infants were the most likely to receive H2RA and PPI treatment. Infants with GERD 
[relative risk (RR): 3.13] and congenital heart disease (RR=2.41) had the highest H2RA/PPI 
treatment probabilities followed by those with an ENT diagnoses (RR=2.34; p<0.05). The 
majority of treated infants remained treated at discharge.
 Conclusion—Despite limited evidence and increasing safety concerns, H2RAs/PPIs are 
frequently prescribed to extremely preterm neonates and those with congenital anomalies and

effectiveness; patient-centered outcomes
Acid suppressive medications including histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have been increasingly prescribed to neonates in recent years,
[1–4] presumably for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and stress ulcer 
prophylaxis. However, neonatal patterns of reflux-type symptoms are different than those of 
older children or adults,[5–9] for which these drugs were US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved. Neonatal trials have not demonstrated improvement in GERD-attributed 
clinical symptoms following H2RA or PPI treatment.[10–12] Additionally, the effectiveness 
and safety of stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2RAs/PPIs is questioned, in adults and older 
children.[13–15] To our knowledge, no outcome-based data on prophylaxis or definitive 
therapy exists for neonates. H2RAs/PPIs are associated with adverse effects, [16–19] and the 
use of these acid suppressive medications in preterm infants has been associated with 
infections, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and increased mortality risk.[20–24] Guidelines 
have cautioned against the liberal use of acid suppression medications, including H2RAs/
PPIs in neonates.[25, 26] Others have reported that PPIs/H2RAs are frequently prescribed to 
infants.[1, 3, 4, 27, 28] However, to our knowledge, the duration of H2RA/PPI use among 
infants hospitalized in NICUs and the risk factors/comorbidities associated with H2RA/PPI 
treatment have never been fully examined. Identifying these variables will inform the design 
of trials to examine the comparative effectiveness of acid suppression versus non-treatment 
in the neonatal population. Therefore, our investigational objectives were to determine 
treatment frequency and duration for H2RA/PPI use among infants hospitalized in neonatal 
ICUs (NICUs) at US children’s hospitals, and to evaluate the association of clinical 
diagnoses, gestational age, and other demographic factors with H2RA/PPI prescribing 
patterns.
 METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants admitted to NICUs within the 43 US 
children’s hospitals with NICUs participating in the Pediatric Health Information System 
(PHIS) (Children’s Hospital Association, Overland Park, KS) between January 2006 and 
March 2013. The Nationwide Children’s Institutional Review Board determined this was not 
human subjects’ research, because it was an analysis of pre-existing, de-identified data and 
involved no patient contact. PHIS, an administrative database, contains daily medication 
records as well as diagnostic data, duration of hospitalization, and demographic 
characteristics. The reliability and validity of PHIS has been documented in several previous 
studies.[29, 30]

 We included all NICU patients with recorded gestational age that were admitted on postnatal 
day 0 or 1 and hospitalized in the NICU for a minimum of 7 days. We excluded infants 
admitted after postnatal day one to minimize exposure to unmeasured acid-suppressive 
treatments at outside hospitals and included only those who remained hospitalized ≥7 days 
to eliminate infants with short hospitalizations due to milder illnesses who might be treated 
in newborn nurseries instead of NICUs at some institutions and who were also unlikely to 
receive acid-suppressive medications.
Thompson-Reuters Healthcare (Ann Arbor, MI), the PHIS data processing partner, 
reorganizes each hospital’s daily charge codes into Clinical Transaction Classification 
(CTC) codes to ensure comparability of charge data among institutions. We evaluated the 
following PPIs: esomeprazole (CTC: 147201), dexlansoprazole (147203), lansoprazole 
(147205), pantoprazole (147211), omeprazole (147215), and rabeprazole (147221) and 
H2RAs: cimetidine (147101), famotidine (147105), ranitidine (147111) and nizatidine 
(147115).
International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic codes: 
<24 weeks (765.21), 24 weeks (765.22), 25–26 weeks (765.23), 27–28 weeks (765.24), 29–
30 weeks (765.25), 31–32 weeks (765.26), 33–34 weeks (765.27), 35–36 weeks (765.28), 
and ≥37 weeks (765.29) were used to classify gestational age at delivery. We gave 
precedence to ICD-9 codes because allowable billing charges are based on gestational age as 
reported via ICD-9. In instances when gestational age was indeterminable due to absent 
ICD-9 codes, gestational age reports from non-billing records were incorporated.
We created binary, composite variables for nine diagnostic categories [gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD), otorhinolaryngology surgery (ENT), GI abnormality, congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), congenital heart disease, congenital lung disease, infection, 
and neurologic abnormality] using ICD-9 codes (Table I; available at www.jpeds.com).
Daily, billed respiratory support as recorded in PHIS was used to assign a diagnosis of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). These infants must have been born before 29 weeks of 
gestation with a birth weight <1500 grams. We chose these gestational (<29 weeks) and 
birth weight (<1500 g) cutoffs to include >97% of infants with BPD.[31] We designated 
those infants with moderate or severe BPD according to the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) Consensus Definition,[32] as modified by Ehrenkranz et al,[33] as having BPD by 
using respiratory charge data to identify those infants who received mechanical ventilation 
(CTC=521166), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (CTC=521162), supplemental 
oxygen (CTC=521171), or a combination of these modalities for the first 28 consecutive 
postnatal days and who remained on supplemental oxygen, CPAP, or mechanical ventilation 
at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.
 Data Analyses
All analyses were conducted by using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). We chose 
to calculate risk ratios rather than odds ratios because H2RA and PPI administration were 
common occurrences in our dataset. We used a modified Poisson regression with a robust 
between-cluster variance estimator to estimate adjusted risk ratios (relative risk) for

 H2RA/PPI receipt while controlling for clustering at the hospital level.[34, 35] Linear 
regression with a random intercept for hospitals was used to evaluate the association of 
clinical risk factors and diagnoses with the timing of the first H2RA or PPI doses in treated 
infants.
 RESULTS
A total of 122,002 infants met inclusion criteria, of which 23.8% (n=28,989) ever received 
either an H2RA or PPI. The proportion of infants who ever received H2RAs was 19.0% 
(n=23,187), while 10.5% (n=12,823) ever received PPIs and 5.8% (n=7,021) ever received 
both at some point during their hospital stay. Patient characteristics including birth gestation 
and diagnoses are shown in Table II (available at www.jpeds.com). Table III (available at 
www.jpeds.com) demonstrates the frequency of H2RA/PPI receipt by gestation, sex, and 
major diagnoses. Within the cohort, 11.2% (n=13,625) of patients received an ICD-9 
diagnosis of GERD. Of these infants diagnosed with GERD, 74.3% (n=10,127) were ever 
treated with an H2RA or PPI; 53.8% (n=7,330) ever received an H2RA and 46.5% 
(n=6,331) a PPI.
 Timing of Treatment
Within the whole cohort, the median postnatal age for first H2RA or PPI receipt was 10 days 
(25th–75th%: 3–28) (range 0–361). Median treatment duration was 15 days (25th–75th%: 6–
35) (range 1–1244). Initial H2RA treatment was at a median of 7 days (25th–75th%: 2–23), 
earlier than the 15-day median (25th–75th%: 4–37) for first PPI treatment. Median H2RA (10 
days with 25th–75th%: 4–22) treatment duration was shorter than for PPIs (19 days with 
25th–75th%: 8–39).
 Treatment Timing and Frequency by Gestational Age
Most treated infants were born at late-preterm (35–36 weeks) or term (≥37 weeks) gestations 
(Table III). However, when viewed proportionally by birth gestation, H2RA and PPI 
treatment percentiles take on a bimodal, U-shaped distribution with extremely-preterm 
infants as or even more likely to be treated relative to late-preterm or term infants (Figure 1, 
A). Among infants born at ≤24-weeks gestation, 28.7% were ultimately treated with H2RAs 
and 18.1% with PPIs; with 27.6% H2RA treatment and 19.6% PPI treatment at 26–26 weeks 
gestations. In comparison, among term infants, 25.0% were treated with H2RAs and only 
12.0% with PPIs.
An infant’s postnatal age at first H2RA and PPI receipt decreased with increasing 
gestational age at birth in a near-linear fashion (Figure 1, B). The percent of the total 
hospitalization that an infant received H2RAs/PPIs increased with gestational maturity at 
birth (Figure 1, C). Although the majority of the most preterm infants (birth gestation ≤ 26 
weeks) were treated later in their hospitalization, 36.1% ever treated with H2RAs and 17.1% 
ever treated with PPIs received their first medication dose in the neonatal period (≤ postnatal 
day 28).

  Treatment Initiation by Diagnosis
In addition to gestational age, specific medical diagnoses had a large impact on the timing of 
H2RA/PPI administration (Table IV; available at www.jpeds.com). After accounting for 
gestational age, sex, and other diagnoses, infants with a GERD diagnosis received their first 
H2RA dose an average of 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.5, 5.8) later than other cohort infants that 
were treated with H2RAs. However, initial PPI dose timing was not significantly different 
[0.8 days (95% CI: −0.1, 1.7)] in infants with a GERD diagnosis. A diagnosis of severe BPD 
at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was associated with a 19.2 day increase (95% CI: 17.7, 20.7) 
in the H2RA treatment start date and 20.4 day increase in PPI start date (95%CI: 18.5, 22.4), 
after controlling for gestational age and other diagnoses. Infants with ENT anomalies, 
congenital lung anomalies, congenital heart disease, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia 
were more likely to be treated early in their hospitalization.
 Multivariable Adjusted Relative Risk of Ever Receiving H2RA or PPI
In our multivariable model, the largest influence on the probability of an infant ever 
receiving an H2RA/PPI, after controlling for gestation and sex, was receipt of a GERD 
diagnosis (Table V). Relative to infants without a GERD diagnosis, those diagnosed with 
GERD had 2.68 (95% CI: 2.36, 3.03) times the risk of ever receiving an H2RA and 5.37 
(95% CI: 4.46, 6.46) the risk of ever receiving a PPI. Infants with congenital heart disease 
had the next highest probability of having ever received an H2RA or PPI (relative risk 2.41 
(95% CI: 2.11, 2.75). ENT diagnoses, typically co-managed by pediatric 
otorhinolaryngologists, had the second highest relative risk of ever receiving a PPI [2.34 
(95% CI 2.13, 2.58)] after infants with a GERD diagnosis. Diagnoses in the categories of GI 
abnormality, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, moderate/severe BPD at 36 weeks, infection, 
congenital lung abnormality, and neurologic abnormality were also all associated with an 
increased probability of receiving H2RA/PPI treatment.
 H2RA and PPI Use at Discharge
Among treated patients, 56.0% (n=16230) ever treated with either an H2RA or PPI were still 
receiving an H2RA/PPI at discharge. An even higher proportion of infants that ever received 
a PPI remained on a PPI at discharge (75.7%; n=9701). Among those that ever received an 
H2RA, 51.7% (n=11993) were receiving an H2RA at discharge.
 National and Hospital-Level Trends in H2RA and PPI Utilization
Hospitals varied both in frequency of H2RA/PPI utilization and ratio of H2RA to PPI use 
(Figure 2, A and B). H2RAs predominated at most hospitals, but a minority (23.3%; n=10 of 
43 hospitals) prescribed PPIs more frequently. H2RA utilization declined annually (23.1% in 
2006 vs. 12.9% in 2013). In contrast, PPI use increased from 2006 until 2010, reaching a 
peak of 12.2%, before declining to 7.9% in 2013 (Figure 3, A). H2RA and PPI use in the 
most preterm infants (≤26-weeks gestation) followed similar patterns (Figure 3, B). The 
median postnatal age at first H2RA and PPI treatment steadily increased in ≤30-week 
gestation infants between 2006–2013 (Figure 3, C). However, for all gestational ages, there 
was little change in the percentage of infants discharged on an H2RA or PPI over the study 
period (Figure 3, D).

  DISCUSSION
Our investigation demonstrates H2RAs/PPIs are frequently prescribed to neonates in US 
children’s hospitals, often to discharge, despite a lack of published evidence for improved 
outcomes following their administration[10–12, 36–38] and increasing concerns for adverse 
effects.[25, 26, 39] By proportion, the highest frequencies of overall acid suppressive 
treatment occurred in extremely-preterm, late-preterm, and term infants. The highest 
frequency of PPI treatment occurred in extremely-preterm infants. The majority of infants 
ever started on an H2RA or PPI, and ~75% of PPI users, remained on treatment at discharge. 
Although, as expected, the highest adjusted probability of H2RA and/or PPI treatment 
occurred in infants with a GERD diagnosis, we unexpectedly found those with congenital 
heart disease had the next highest treatment probability with either drug (H2RA or PPI) and 
those with ENT diagnoses had the second highest probability of receiving PPIs.
The median age at first H2RA/PPI treatment decreased nearly linearly with increasing birth 
gestation. As a result, treated term infants spent the greatest proportion of their 
hospitalization on acid suppressive medications. On average, most preterm infants started 
H2RAs/PPIs at a median postmenstrual age near normal oral feeding introduction (33–34 
weeks). Therefore, we speculate that aerodigestive symptoms including feeding concerns 
and respiratory events purported to be due to GERD likely played a large role in clinicians’ 
decisions to start H2RAs/PPIs for many preterm infants. Nevertheless, ~25% of infants born 
at or below 26 weeks were started on H2RAs/PPIs during the first postnatal month, a time 
early in their development when they are at high risk for infection and morbidities such as 
NEC that have been associated with acid suppression. Total use decreased and the median 
first day of treatment increased in ≤30-week gestation infants over 2006–2013, perhaps 
indicating that physicians have become more cautious with H2RA/PPI use given increasing 
safety concerns. Nonetheless, there was little change in the proportion of infants remaining 
on treatment at discharge.
Clinical diagnoses affected the timing of treatment initiation. Although 74% of infants with 
a GERD diagnosis were treated with H2RA/PPIs, the number of treated patients without a 
GERD diagnosis, just slightly under two-thirds, was unexpected. Median timing of 
H2RA/PPI treatment initiation began at an older age for infants with a GERD diagnosis than 
the overall population. On average, preterm infants diagnosed with moderate/severe BPD 
began acid suppressive medications late in their hospitalization, similar to other preterm 
infants. Conversely, infants with congenital anomalies received H2RAs/PPIs at an earlier 
than median age. Because treatment initiation for all the diagnoses we examined, except for 
moderate/severe BPD, occurred prior to the median treatment date of infants with a GERD 
diagnosis (14 postnatal days), this likely suggests that clinicians are starting acid suppressive 
medication for other reasons such as stress ulcer prophylaxis. We speculate that the 
sustained decrease in H2RA utilization since 2006 and decrease in PPI utilization since 2010 
may be due to changes in clinical practice related to published evidence showing lack of 
efficacy and even harm for H2RA and PPI use in infants.[21–24]
The utility of pharmacologic acid suppression in neonates has been questioned because the 
gastric pH of infants typically remains > 4.0 for 75–90% of the time due to milk buffering.

 [40, 41] Uncomplicated GER symptoms usually resolve by 12 months of age without 
treatment.[42] The few available studies in preterm infants failed to show a reduction in 
symptoms clinically attributed to GERD following acid suppression.[10, 11, 25, 37]
More worrisome is the concern gastric acid suppression may be harmful because stomach 
acidity plays an important role in the gastrointestinal tract host defense as a barrier to 
harmful pathogens.[16, 23, 39, 43] H2RA treatment of infants has been associated with a 
higher bloodstream infection risk.[44–46] Acid suppression in 4–36 month-olds with 
increased pneumonia and gastroenteritis.[47]. A prospective cohort showed ranitidine to be 
associated with infection, NEC, and increased mortality.[24] A nested case-control 
demonstrated a significant relationship between prior H2RA use and NEC.[22] A double-
blinded, multicenter RCT by Orenstein et al found no improvement in GERD-associated 
events following omeprazole administration to infants; instead serious adverse events 
including respiratory events were more common.[11] In adults, PPIs have been associated 
with hospital-acquired pneumonia,[17] acute interstitial nephritis[48], hypergastrinemia-
induced hyperplasia of histamine-secreting gastric enterochromaffin-like cells,[48] 
osteoporosis-related fractures[18], vitamin B12 deficiency,[49] and myocardial infarction.
[19] The effects of long-term acid suppression on the developing gastric mucosa and bones 
of preterm infants are unknown.[36] Given these findings and two multicenter RCTs 
showing no improvement in GERD-associated events in infants,[10, 11] the FDA concluded 
PPIs should only be prescribed to infants with documented acid-induced conditions 
following a trial of conservative measures.[25] Almost all trials and large studies examining 
the effect of acid suppression on GERD relied on non-specific clinical symptoms commonly 
attributed to GERD.[12] To determine if H2RAs/PPIs are beneficial for neonatal GERD 
management, future comparative effectiveness trials should differentiate true GERD-related 
clinical events from similar non-GERD related clinical events via a clear physiological 
GERD diagnosis prior to randomization.
H2RAs/PPIs are used in ill adults and older children for stress ulcer prophylaxis and there is 
controversy regarding the safety and effectiveness of population-wide, empiric prophylactic 
therapy.[13–15, 50] Given the early timing of H2RA/PPI use for cohort patients without a 
GERD diagnosis and our clinical experiences, we speculate most early acid suppression in 
ill neonates is for prophylactic reasons or bloody nasogastric tube aspirates. In light of a lack 
of studies demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of these practices in improving 
important outcomes, our findings support the need for further study.
Our study design has multiple strengths including a generous sample size and rich 
pharmacological information within PHIS that allowed us to determine daily H2RA/PPI 
utilization for each patient. Although our investigation was limited to 43 freestanding US 
Children’s Hospitals, our findings are likely generalizable to other US NICUs because most 
included hospitals serve as major neonatal training centers.
Our study is limited by its retrospective design. The data in PHIS was initially collected for 
hospital administrative purposes instead of research. Although we used hospital charge data 
for specific date of service to determine days on mechanical ventilation, CPAP, and oxygen, 
and dates of H2RA/PPI administration, we had to rely on less specific ICD-9 codes for

 discharge diagnoses of GERD, IVH, PDA, and NEC. Potential recording errors might 
reduce the accuracy of our diagnoses. PHIS data is rigorously screened for errors and 
rejected when quality thresholds are not met. A reliance on discharge diagnoses prevented us 
from examining temporal associations between medication administration and diagnoses, 
including the impact of H2RAs and PPIs on NEC and sepsis incidence. We therefore chose 
not to study the causal effects of H2RAs/ PPIs on important clinical outcomes such as 
mortality, feeding milestones, and length of stay or evaluate the H2RA/PPI safety.
Many infants identified in this study as having GERD diagnoses may not have had true 
pathologic GERD, as diagnosed by pH impedance and manometry, similar to recent RCTs 
that randomized infants with presumed GERD to acid suppressive therapy.[10, 11, 51] The 
ICD-9 diagnosis of GERD itself is highly relevant because it indicates a clinical presumption 
that the infant had GERD, and reflects providers’ practice thought patterns.[52] Clinical 
presumptions, not only concrete diagnoses, often drive treatment decisions.
Our findings support the need for further studies to examine the comparative effectiveness of 
pharmacologic acid suppression versus no treatment, as well as the safety of these 
medications for neonatal patients.

Data are shown as adjusted risk ratios (95% confidence interval). Regression risk ratios for gestational age are reported relative to a reference group 
of ≥37-week gestation infants. Risk ratios were determined by using a modified Poisson regression model with a robust between-cluster variance 
estimator with a random intercept for hospital. Race/ethnicity categories were excluded from the model after they were found to not have a 
statistically significant influence on the probability of ever receiving an H2RA or PPI.
