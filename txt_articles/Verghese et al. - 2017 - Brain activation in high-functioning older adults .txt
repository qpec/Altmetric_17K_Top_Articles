Brain activation in high-functioning older
adults and falls
Prospective cohort study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether brain activity over the prefrontal cortex measured in real time
during walking predicts falls in high-functioning older adults.
Method: We examined166 older persons (mean age 75 years, 51% women) enrolled in a prospec-
tive aging study. High-functioning status defined as the absence of dementia or disability with
normal gait diagnosed by study clinicians. The magnitude of task-related changes in oxygenated
hemoglobin levels over the prefrontal cortex was measured with functional near-infrared spec-
troscopy during motor (walking at normal pace) and cognitive (reciting alternate letters of the
alphabet) single tasks and a dual-task condition (walking while reciting alternate letters of the
alphabet). Incident falls were prospectively assessed over a 50-month study period.
Results: Over a mean follow-up of 33.9 6 11.9 months, 116 falls occurred. Higher levels of
prefrontal cortical activation during the dual-task walking condition predicted falls (hazard ratio
adjusted for age, sex, education, medical illnesses and general mental status 1.32, 95% confi-
dence interval 1.03–1.70). Neither behavioral outcomes (velocity or letter rate) on the dual task
nor brain activation patterns on the single tasks (normal walk or talk alone) predicted falls in this
high-functioning sample. The results remained robust after accounting for multiple confounders
and for cognitive status, slow gait, previous falls, and frailty.
Conclusions: Prefrontal brain activity levels while performing a cognitively demanding walking
condition predicted falls in high-functioning seniors. These findings implicate neurobiological pro-
cesses early in the pathogenesis of falls. Neurology® 2017;88:191–197

Emerging evidence supports cognitive impairment as a major contributor to falls in aging.1,2
Patients with dementia fall more frequently than cognitively intact peers.1,2 Less is known about
the cortical contributions to risk of falls in cognitively normal adults. Among the various
cognitive processes, executive functions are strongly linked to falls2,3 and are subserved by the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and related networks.4 Worse performance on dual tasks that involve
executive functions such as walking while talking (WWT), a mobility stress test,5,6 predicts falls
in older adults without dementia even after accounting for established fall risk factors.6–9
Brain activation imaging, which compares the level of brain activity while an individual per-
forms a task to that in a control state,10 helps reveal subtle alterations in brain function that may
precede clinical dysfunction.4,10 Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive
technology that measures changes in cortical hemodynamic response, an indirect index of neural
activity, while an individual performs cognitively demanding activities.4,11 Using fNIRS, we
showed that WWT elicits a greater degree of PFC neural activity while walking.11,12 Unlike PET
and other neuroimaging methods,4,10 fNIRS has the advantage of studying participants while
they actually walk.4 While compensatory brain activation patterns early in progressive

 neurodegenerative diseases are described,10
whether brain activation in healthy older
adults can predict a multifactorial episodic
phenomenon such as falls is unknown.13
We selected community-dwelling older
adults without dementia and disability to eval-
uate early brain activation changes that predict
falls. Clinical gait abnormalities not only
increase risk for falls and dementia but also
influence
PFC
activation
on
fNIRS.14–16
Hence,
we
further
restricted
our
high-
functioning
cohort
to
individuals
with
clinically normal gaits without mobility limi-
tations. We hypothesized that WWT will
increase the magnitude of PFC activation on
fNIRS in high-functioning older adults, which
in turn would predicts falls.
METHODS Participants. We studied community-residing
adults $65 years of age participating in the Central Control of
Mobility in Aging (CCMA) study.11,12,17,18 The objective of
CCMA is to determine cognitive processes and brain substrates
controlling mobility.11,12,17,18 CCMA procedures were previously
described.11,15,19
Research
assistants
interviewed
potential
participants by telephone to assess eligibility and to rule out
dementia using cognitive screeners.11,12,17,18 Individuals who
passed the interview were invited to in-person visits at our
center.11,12,17,18 Dementia diagnoses were assigned at consensus
case conferences.20 Exclusion criteria for CCMA were the
presence of dementia, inability to walk, active neurologic or
psychiatric disorders severe enough to interfere with study
assessments, presence of major visual or hearing loss, and recent
or planned surgical procedures restricting walking. High-
functioning status was defined as the absence of dementia or
disability
and
presence
of
normal
clinical
gait.
Hence,
additional exclusion criteria for this analysis included disability,
the need for assistance or assistive devices to walk, and presence of
clinical gait abnormalities (see below).14 As previously described,
disability was defined as the need for assistance or inability to
perform any of 7 activities of daily living: bathing, walking, rising
from a chair, dressing, feeding, toileting, and grooming.5
Between June 2011 and December 2013, 349 CCMA par-
ticipants without dementia or disability underwent baseline
fNIRS assessments. After the exclusion of 157 participants
with abnormal gaits (66 neurologic and 91 nonneurologic)
and 26 without follow-up data, 166 high-functioning adults
(mean age 75.0 6 6.1 years, 51% women) were eligible for
this analysis. Falls were prospectively ascertained over a 50-
month period until August 2015.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. All participants provided written informed consent.
The Albert Einstein College of Medicine institutional review
board approved the study protocol.
Walking paradigm. Gait was assessed with a 4 3 14-ft
electronic
walkway
(Zenometrics
LLC,
Peekskill,
NY).17
ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis Software was used to derive
stride velocity (meters per second) from footfall data.17 Two single
tasks and one dual task were presented in random order
to minimize task order and practice effects.11 In the cognitive
single task (Alpha), participants recited alternate letters of the
alphabet for 30 seconds while standing. In the motor single
task, participants were asked to walk on the walkway at their
normal pace for 3 continuous loops consisting of 6 straight
segments and 5 turns, starting with the straight segment.17 For
the dual task, WWT,5,6,21 participants were instructed to walk 3
continuous
loops
while
reciting
alternate
letters
of
the
alphabet.19,22 They were instructed to pay equal attention to
both tasks to minimize task prioritization.21 WWT has high
reliability and excellent validity for predicting falls.5,11,21,23 Gait
(stride) velocity during normal-pace walking and WWT (both
straight segments), as well as correct letter rate per minute
during
Alpha
and
WWT,
were
recorded
as
previously
described.11,17
fNIRS assessment. Details regarding fNIRS are provided in
our recent publications.11,15 In brief, fNIRS measures changes
in cortical hemodynamic response by monitoring changes in
light intensity within near-infrared range.11 fNIRS can assess
brain activity during walking4,11,15 and can handle motion
artifacts.24,25 fNIRS Imager 1000 (fNIRS Devices LLC,
Potomac, MD; sampling rate 2 Hz) was used to assess PFC
hemodynamic activity.11 The fNIRS sensor, consisting of 4
light-emitting diode light sources and 10 photodetectors (16
voxels), was placed using a standard placement over the
participants’ foreheads.24
Preprocessing and signal extraction. To eliminate artifacts
due to respiration, heart rate signals, and unwanted high-
frequency noise, raw intensity measurements at 730 and 850
nm were low-pass filtered with a finite impulse response filter
with a cutoff frequency of 0.14 Hz.25 The modified Beer-Lambert
law was used to calculate oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2),
deoxygenated hemoglobin, and oxygenation index signals.25 Only
HbO2 is reported because it is more reliable and sensitive to
walking-related cerebral oxygenation changes than the other
measures.11 We used a standing 10-second baseline condition
recorded immediately before each of the 3 tasks to determine
relative task-related changes in PFC HbO2 concentrations.11,12
Participants were asked to stand still and count silently
to minimize distractions and to standardize the procedure for the
baseline measurement.11 Levels for the 10-second baseline period
for each of the 3 tasks were adjusted to a mean HbO2 value of
zero so that activation levels were normalized to the same level of
the individualized baseline condition.11
Epoch and feature extraction. All eligible participants com-
pleted fNIRS protocols successfully. Individual mean HbO2 data
were extracted separately for each channel for each condition.12
fNIRS and gait events were synchronized to optimize HbO2
acquisition and extraction during the tasks.4,11,15 Average oxygen-
ation level based on 16 channels in each participant over the entire
talking (Alpha 30 seconds), normal-pace walking, and WWT tasks
was used for analyses.11,15 We reported excellent internal consis-
tency for HbO2 measurements in all 3 conditions.12
Falls. Falls were defined as unintentionally coming down on the
floor or to a lower level not as a result of a major intrinsic or
extrinsic event.26 Research assistants interviewed participants at
yearly in-person visits and every 2 to 3 months between annual
visits by telephone regarding occurrence of any new falls since the
last interview. A standardized questionnaire was used to ensure
consistency between interviewers and over the follow-up. If
participants reported a fall, interviewers ascertained whether
there were any associated injuries (such as fractures). We
reported excellent test-retest reliability for fall self-reports using
this protocol.27

 Other covariates. Study clinicians determined whether gaits
were normal or abnormal after visual inspection of walking pat-
terns.14,16 Abnormal gaits were subtyped as nonneurologic (due
to causes such as arthritis) or neurologic (unsteady, ataxic, frontal,
parkinsonian, neuropathic, hemiparetic, and spastic).14,16 More
details and video web links of abnormal gaits are available.14,16
This gait assessment has excellent test-retest and interrater
reliability.16 Normal gait was defined as the absence of
neurologic or nonneurologic gait abnormalities.
The following covariates were assessed at baseline. General
mental status was assessed with the Repeatable Battery for the
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total score.28 We also
included the Digit Symbol Substitution test, a timed test assessing
executive functions, attention, and processing speed, to assess
cognitive domains linked to falls and WWT.3,29 A comorbidity
count (range 0–9) was obtained by the study clinician from the
presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, arthritis, hypertension,
depression, chronic lung disease, stroke, chronic heart failure,
angina, and myocardial infarction.8,20
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to examine
baseline characteristics. The effect of the magnitude of HbO2
levels during WWT on recurrent falls during follow-up was
studied with the Andersen-Gil extension of the Cox model,30
which is recommended by experts as appropriate to analyze
recurrent fall events31,32 and makes no assumptions about
distribution of the outcome. Robust sandwich covariance
estimates accounted for correlations among multiple events
within the same participant. Associations were reported as
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Model
1 was adjusted for age, sex, education, comorbidity count, and
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological
Status score. We also examined laterality effects (right vs left
channels) on falls.
We conducted secondary analyses to account for potential
confounders. To examine whether brain activation levels during
WWT provided incremental value for predicting falls over brain
activation levels in single tasks, we adjusted model 1 for HbO2
levels during normal walking and Alpha conditions (model 2).
Although we accounted for general mental status in this sample
without dementia, we also adjusted for Digit Symbol Substitution
test scores (model 3).3,29 To test whether WWT PFC activation
levels were an early marker of falls compared to behavioral
markers, we reran model 1 adjusting for WWT velocity (model
4) and correct letter rate.
To account for the possibility that participants who walk
slowest explained our findings, we reran model 1 excluding 15
with slow gait defined with a widely used normal-pace velocity
cut score of 0.80 m/s.33 The sample size precluded examination
of higher cut scores. In addition, our continuous loop protocol
includes slower turns, and the corresponding velocity walking
straight will be higher.17 We repeated model 1 excluding 6 par-
ticipants with instrumental activity limitations (taking medica-
tions 1, writing checks 2, and planning and organizing
activities 3). Finally, because falls may influence baseline brain
activity (reverse causation), we redid analyses excluding 21 par-
ticipants who fell in the 12 months before baseline. Proportional
hazards assumptions of models were examined by testing inter-
actions between time and predictors in models and were ade-
quately met. Statistical analyses were done with SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS Our high-functioning cohort had low
comorbidity
(1.4
illnesses).
While
38.6%
had
arthritis, it was not associated with abnormal gait.
Two participants reported head injuries unrelated to
falls. Study clinicians did not find neurologic signs
of stroke (although 6 self-reported strokes) or other
neurologic
diseases
that
may
limit
mobility.
Velocity was lower in WWT than normal walking
(table 1), demonstrating a dual-task effect. Letter
rate was not different between the WWT and
Alpha conditions.
Over a mean follow-up of 33.9 6 11.9 months,
71 participants reported 116 falls (76% occurred out-
doors and 24% indoors). The incidence rate of falls
was 25 per 100 person-years. Median time to the first
fall was 19.5 months. Thirty-four participants fell
more than once. In this high-functioning cohort,

 most falls were mild, with only 6 (5.2%) resulting in
fractures. Higher PFC activation levels on fNIRS dur-
ing WWT (HR corresponding to a 1-unit increase in
oxygenation level 1.32, 95% CI 1.03–1.70) predicted
falls (table 2).
Older age and female sex among the covariates
included in model 1 predicted falls. However, there
was no interaction between WWT activation levels
and sex in model 1 (p 5 0.60).
Left-sided (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15–2.24) but not
right-sided (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54–1.14) fNIRS
channels predicted falls. Associations of individual
fNIRS channels were not reported to avoid multiple
comparisons in the absence of specific predictions.
Association of HbO2 levels during WWT with
falls in model 1 was unchanged by the exclusion of
persons with slow gait (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13–
1.84), instrumental activity limitations (HR 1.32,
95% CI 1.03–1.69), or prior falls (HR 1.32, 95%
CI 1.01–1.74).
WWT (0.74 SD units) and Alpha (0.68) condi-
tions elicited higher PFC activation than normal
walking (0.04), corroborating their greater cognitive
demands (table 1). However, when fNIRS activation
levels in all 3 conditions were entered together, PFC
activation during WWT but not Alpha predicted falls
(model 2, table 2). The association of PFC activation
during WWT with falls was unchanged when
adjusted for Digit Symbol Substitution test scores
(model 3). The association of WWT activation with
falls remained in model 4, but WWT velocity was not
significant. When adjusted for WWT letter rate in
model 4, the association of WWT activation with
falls was unchanged (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05–
1.71), but WWT letter rate was not significant
(HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–1.01).
The association of WWT activation with falls in
model 1 was similar after the exclusion of 6 cases with
mild cognitive impairment syndrome34 (HR 1.33,
95% CI 1.03–1.72) or 7 with frailty5,35 (HR 1.36,
95% CI 1.06–1.74). There was a low rate of other
adverse events over the 50-month study period; 5
participants developed dementia, 2 became disabled,
and 2 died. Excluding individuals with these incident
events from model 1 did not change the findings (HR
1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.80).
DISCUSSION Our study shows that brain activity
level during a cognitively demanding walking task
predicts
falls
in
high-functioning
community-
dwelling older adults; each 1-SD increase in the
intensity of prefrontal activation during WWT
measured by fNIRS was associated with a 32%
increased risk of falls. The association remained
even after accounting for well-established fall risk
factors. Our finding builds on our behavioral
studies that showed that WWT velocity predicted
falls
in
older
adults
without
dementia
and
disability.6,7 However, these studies did not exclude
individuals with gait abnormalities or slow gait.6,7
While we used cognitive, functional, and gait
performance to define high-functioning status, these
criteria did not result in a sample free of diseases or
clinical impairments. Nonetheless, accounting for

 cognitive and physical frailty and diseases did not
change results.
Our findings are in line with studies that have re-
ported increased brain activity in older adults while
performing cognitively demanding activities.4,10,36
Higher brain activation was reported in persons at
risk for Alzheimer disease, which has a long pre-
clinical phase.10 However, very little is known about
the neural substrates of multifactorial episodic phe-
nomenon such as falls in healthy adults.13 Our find-
ings suggest that changes in brain activity may
precede behavioral abnormalities on mobility tasks
and implicate neurobiological processes early in the
pathogenesis of falls. The underlying biological
mechanisms and the influence of pathologic pro-
cesses such as cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative
diseases on brain activity associated with falls need
to be examined.
Gait performance in normal and WWT condi-
tions
predicts
falls
in
the
general
elderly
population.6,7,9,27 However, when restricted to high-
functioning seniors, neither WWT behavioral out-
comes (velocity or letter rate) nor brain activation
during single tasks (normal walk and talk alone) pre-
dicted falls. Furthermore, excluding individuals with
slow gait strengthened the association of brain activity
with falls. These observations support the hypothesis
that brain activity predictive of falls may precede clin-
ical dysfunction on complex walking conditions (such
as WWT behavioral measures) and may not be eli-
cited by less cognitively demanding conditions such
as normal-pace walking.
The additional processing required for cognitively
demanding tasks such as WWT may be achieved by
altering the magnitude (increasing or sustaining neu-
ral activation levels) or pattern (recruiting more neu-
ral tissue) of brain activity.10,15 Our findings are
consistent with compensatory reallocation models
suggesting that in at-risk older individuals increased
PFC activation brings task performance to near-
normal levels.37 Furthermore, we reported that high
PFC activation was sustained the whole duration of
the WWT task in our participants but not during the
more automatic normal walking condition.11 While
our primary focus was on the magnitude of PFC
activity, our exploratory analysis also indicates a later-
ality effect (pattern); left but not right fNIRS chan-
nels were associated with falls. Reallocation of
resource to areas involved in cognitive processing dur-
ing WWT may compromise gait and increase fall risk.
Activation of left-sided PFC fNIRS channels on other
dual tasks has been reported.36 Although left-sided
fNIRS channels overlie speech areas, PFC activation
during talking alone was not associated with falls.
Excluding 16 left-handed persons did not change
results (data not shown).
The rigorous phenotyping to identify high-
functioning persons, prospective fall ascertainment,
and reliable clinical and statistical procedures are
strengths.11,15,16,27,31,32 The psychometrics,8,21 reli-
ability,23 clinical validity,5–7 and neurobiological
correlates11,12,18,38 of our WWT task are well
established. Support for the validity of our high-
functioning definition is provided by the low co-
morbidity count, low rate of incident adverse
events, and low prevalence of mild cognitive impair-
ment (3.6%)34 and frailty (4.2%)5,35 in the sample
who qualified for this analysis. Moreover, mean gait
velocity on normal walk was higher in this sample
(1.07 m/s) compared to that reported in the overall
CCMA cohort (0.79 m/s) using the same walking
protocol and equipment.11 High reliability of falls
recall over short intervals in our previous study and
over longer intervals in other cohorts was re-
ported.27,39 Potential limitations are noted. We
focused on the PFC on the basis of the relationships
of this brain area established with mobility in pre-
vious studies.22 In the same cohort, we reported that
PFC was associated with WWT in an fMRI study of
imagined walking38 and in a resting-state fMRI
study of the correlates of actual walking.18 We also
reported that a cognitive remediation intervention
targeting PFC-based cognitive processes improved
WWT performance.40 We acknowledge that other
brain areas not examined in our study are impli-
cated in gait control and may have a role in increas-
ing fall risk4 and should be studied. While our
clinical gait assessment is reliable, very mild clinical
signs may be missed. Neurologic gaits are a marker
of brain disease14,16 and can influence PFC activa-
tion patterns on fNIRS.15 It is possible that the
compensatory brain activity may not be seen in
later
clinical
stages
when
gait
abnormalities
occur.2,4,15,16,38 While we reported high correlation
between gait velocity during straight and loop pro-
tocols,11 negotiating turns might be more cogni-
tively demanding. However, this hypothesis is not
supported by lower PFC activation during the nor-
mal walking condition that also had loops. Given
the observational design, our findings do not estab-
lish causality but indicate that WWT brain activity
changes precede falls.
High-functioning older persons at risk for falls
have alterations in brain activity patterns without
obvious behavioral manifestations, which can be
used to assess fall risk and to implicate neural pro-
cesses early in the pathogenesis of falls. Further
studies are needed to establish the underlying bio-
logical and physiologic processes and to identify in-
terventions that may influence brain activity during
complex walking conditions as a prelude to prevent-
ing falls.
