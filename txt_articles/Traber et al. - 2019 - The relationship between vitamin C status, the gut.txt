Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of cardiometabolic risk factors, which together predict increased risk of more serious chronic diseases. We propose that
one consequence of dietary overnutrition is increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut that cause increased inflammation, impaired gut function, and
endotoxemia that further dysregulate the already compromised antioxidant vitamin status in MetS. This discussion is timely because “healthy” individuals are no
longer the societal norm and specialized dietary requirements are needed for the growing prevalence of MetS. Further, these lines of evidence provide the foun-
dational basis for investigation that poor vitamin C status promotes endotoxemia, leading to metabolic dysfunction that impairs vitamin E trafficking through a
mechanism involving the gut-liver axis. This report will establish a critical need for translational research aimed at validating therapeutic approaches to manage
endotoxemia—an early, but inflammation-inducing phenomenon, which not only occurs in MetS, but is also prognostic of more advanced metabolic disorders
including type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as the increasing severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.
1. Introduction
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is at epidemic proportions in the US
[1]. The disorder is associated with the obesity epidemic; it is a serious
public health problem that leads to the increased prevalence and se-
verity of chronic diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, heart
disease, and stroke) and premature mortality [2,3]. Consistent with a
substantial proportion of Americans having circulating ascorbic acid
concentrations indicative of suboptimal or overt deficiency [4], low
circulating ascorbic acid concentrations are commonly associated with
MetS [5] and the progression to type 2 diabetes [6–11]. Inadequate
vitamin C intakes clearly impair vitamin C status [4]; however, ascorbic
acid is also depleted systemically by its reaction with hypochlorous acid
(bleach), an anti-microbial agent produced by neutrophils [12]. Al-
though no studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis, the objective of
this review is to present evidence supporting that poor vitamin C status
in MetS is driven by gut inflammation and barrier dysfunction attrib-
uted to excess dietary energy consumption [13]. Importantly, impaired
gut barrier function in MetS mediates metabolic endotoxemia by in-
creasing the absorption of bacteria and gut-derived endotoxins (e.g. li-
popolysaccharide (LPS)) [13,14] while also impairing vitamin C ab-
sorption [15]. These inter-related events provoke a vicious cycle, both
increasing chronic inflammation and oxidative damage. Thus, the fol-
lowing discussion is an overview of an innovative area of investigation
to establish the importance of adequate vitamin C status along the gut-
liver axis. Improved vitamin C status is hypothesized to alleviate en-
dotoxemia and its consequent pro-inflammatory responses that are
suggested to initiate insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders
[16,17]. Further, because LPS triggers intestinal and hepatic in-
flammation, we propose that improved vitamin C status along the gut-
liver axis would restore vitamin E trafficking and bioavailability that is
otherwise impaired in MetS persons, likely due to their heightened
inflammation in association with poor vitamin C status [18,19]. Ulti-
mately, research translation of these putative benefits of vitamin C
would help establish novel dietary strategies to reduce the growing
public health burden of MetS while also providing investigators new
tools to evaluate gut-liver functions.
2. Metabolic syndrome: definititon and prevalence
MetS is a cluster of conditions that includes at least 3 of 5 risk
factors: hypertension, hyperglycemia, central obesity, hypertriglycer-
idemia, or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (Table 1)
[20]. Approximately 35% of the American adult population is afflicted
with MetS [1]. However, its prevalence occurs in an age-dependent
manner such that ≈ 18% of young adults (20–39 y), ≈ 34% of middle-
aged adults (40–59 y), and ≈ 47% of older adults > 60 y are afflicted.
MetS is a growing epidemic, and its public health impact is emphasized
by data indicating that it increases premature mortality by increasing
the risk for various disorders characterized by inflammation and

 oxidative distress (e.g. fatty liver disease, type II diabetes, cardiovas-
cular disease) [2,3]. Further, many persons with MetS have symptoms
that are subclinical, and therefore are left unmanaged from a pharma-
cological standpoint. Fortunately, MetS development and progression
can be averted by improved diet [21], especially increased intake of
whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and decreased intake
of refined sugars, white flour and saturated fats [22]. However, these
public health recommendations have had little impact [23].
3. Implications of inadequate vitamin C in MetS
Data from NHANES indicate that obese adults have 5–12% lower
micronutrient intakes along with a higher prevalence of nutrient in-
adequacy compared with normal weight adults [24]. Vitamin C intakes
are poor among the obese with 8% of women and 13% of men having
circulating concentrations indicative of vitamin C deficiency [4]. De-
spite the general recognition that nutritional status in MetS is com-
promised, nutrition and medical professionals do not advocate for the
use of antioxidant supplements because there is a lack of scientific ra-
tionale or demonstrated health benefit in humans from the use of these
supplements [25]. Thus, a significant need exists to investigate the in-
teractions of antioxidant nutrients in persons who have MetS or are
obese, and their impact on intestinal function.
Potentially, inadequate vitamin C status in MetS contributes to
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, transcytosis of enteric bacteria,
and an elevation of circulating LPS, which elicits a low-grade in-
flammatory response. By contrast, oral ingestion of large-dose vitamin
C supplements results in limited intestinal vitamin C absorption [26],
with excess ascorbic acid remaining in the gut lumen where it can
potentially exert beneficial effects both on the intestinal cells and mi-
crobiota composition and function.
The gut microbiota composition is an important disease factor [27].
Beneficial changes in gut bacteria composition of persons with MetS
who consumed a Mediterranean diet for two years were observed [28].
At baseline, the abundance in MetS of Bacteroides, Eubacterium and
Lactobacillus genera was higher than in non-MetS controls patients,
whereas the Bacteroides fragilis group, Parabacteroides distasonis,
Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron,
Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii,
Fuso-
bacterium nucleatum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium ado-
lescentis, Ruminococcus flavefaciens subgroup and Eubacterium rectale
were depleted in MetS (all p-values < 0.05). Following long-term
consumption of Mediterranean diet, the populations of P. distasonis, B.
thetaiotaomicron, F. prausnitzii, B. adolescentis and B. longum were
restored in MetS as compared with the microbiota composition in MetS
persons assigned to a low-fat diet (all p-values < 0.05). Moreover,
decreased LPS and cardiac event-free survival were associated with
long-term consumption of a Mediterranean diet, especially in those who
ate fruits and legumes [29], important sources of vitamins C and E,
respectively. Thus, diet composition has major effects not only on
chronic disease risk, but also on microbiota composition and on en-
dotoxemia.
4. Why would improved vitamin C status decrease endotoxemia in
MetS?
4.1. Metabolic endotoxemia
Intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a complication of increased visc-
eral fat that potentiates endotoxemia in MetS [30]. Not only is circu-
lating LPS elevated in MetS, but MetS-associated complications are
further increased by inflammation [16]. NF-κB activation is promoted
intracellularly by reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also by extra-
cellular receptor-mediated signaling (i.e. LPS activates via Toll-like re-
ceptor-4 (TLR4); Fig. 1). Thus, inflammation in MetS is both a cause and
consequence of endotoxin-TLR4 signaling, due to its initiating effects on
inflammation but also to its downstream potentiation of TNFα-TNFR
and ROS generation that exacerbate NFκB activation (Fig. 1).
Normally, LPS is absorbed from the intestine bound to the LPS-
binding protein attached to chylomicrons [31]. This chylomicron-de-
pendent mechanism protects against TLR4-induced inflammation by
Table 1
Clinical Criteria of MetS. Individuals classified with MetS must meet a minimum of 3 of the following 5 established clinical criteria [20].

Fasting blood glucose

Fig. 1. LPS-TLR4-NFκB signaling pathway is an estab-
lished potentiator of TNFα-dependent inflammation in
metabolic disorders. NFκB (e.g. p50-p65) is activated by
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by signaling from Toll-
like receptor-4 (TLR4), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
receptor (TNFR), and other receptors (labeled with “?”).
Vitamin C is hypothesized to improve gut barrier function
to reduce the absorption of endotoxin (LPS), and its con-
sequent signaling via hepatic TLR4. Thus, decreasing LPS
will interrupt the cycle of NFκB activation at the intestine
and the liver otherwise driven by inflammatory mediators,
e.g. TNF-α.

 directing LPS to the lymphatics instead of the portal stream, seques-
tering LPS away from circulating white cells by instead delivering it to
the liver for detoxification [32]. However, increased LPS absorption is
promoted by a high-fat diet that not only increases chylomicron se-
cretion, but also increases gut barrier dysfunction, thereby allowing LPS
passage and increasing circulating LPS, which potentiates endotoxemia-
associated inflammation [13,33–35].
Our assessment of a limited population of relatively healthy adults
with MetS shows that, in association with lower vitamin C status,
persons with MetS not only have metabolic endotoxemia (unpublished
observation; Fig. 2) and increased biomarkers of inflammation but also
lower α-tocopherol (α-TOH) bioavailability [18,19]. These findings
suggest a complex interaction between the antioxidant vitamins and
endotoxin-induced inflammation, as well as with other dietary anti-
oxidants [36]. Although casuality has yet to be established, hypothe-
tically poor vitamin C status drives metabolic endotoxemia, or con-
versely heightened inflammation due to endotoxemia depletes systemic
vitamin C. In support of the latter possibility, dietary vitamin C intakes
(110 mg/d) of MetS persons in our study cohort were above the RDA
(defined as 90 mg/d in men and 75 mg/d in women [37]); yet, MetS
persons had serum ascorbic acid concentrations that were lower than
those of healthy control subjects, who were provided the same rigor-
ously controlled diet.
Endotoxemia may also further impair the already low ascorbate
status in MetS because LPS inhibits absorption of ascorbate [15] by
decreasing sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCT-1 and −2)
[15,38–40]. Additionally, oxidized ascorbate (i.e. dehydroascorbic acid;
DHA) can be taken up by enterocytes via glucose transporters [41,42].
However, when glucose intakes are high, this mechanism has little
benefit on vitamin C status because concentrations of DHA are much
lower than that of glucose [43,44]. Thus, poor vitamin C status in MetS
may not only be the result of low dietary vitamin C intakes [4], which
are exacerbated by impaired absorption of either ascorbate or DHA.
In support of the concept that antioxidants help to maintain gut
barrier function, these nutrients have been reported to be decreased in
the gut mucosa of humans with inflammatory bowel disease [45].
Further, endotoxemia in mice initiates obesity and insulin resistance
[16], while antioxidants mitigate intestinal inflammation [46]. Im-
portantly, in humans, impaired gut barrier function occurs with scurvy
(e.g. [47–49]).
Mounting evidence indicates that endotoxemia, gut permeability,
and NAFLD severity are causally related [50,51]. Various conditions
can impair gut barrier function [52,53], which then drives inflamma-
tion and endotoxemia [54,55]. LPS is the driver of metabolic en-
dotoxemia and has been proposed as the initiator of increased in-
flammation in MetS [16,34]. Indeed, patients with hepatic cirrhosis, a
consequence of NAFLD, have increased circulating endotoxin that
predicted disease severity [56,57]. Children with NAFLD also had in-
creased circulating endotoxin [58], which also strongly predicted
NAFLD severity scores [58]. A sugar probe test indicated that they
experienced increased gut permeability, which correlated with disease
severity (i.e. fibrosis, portal inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning) [59].
The findings in both children [58] and adults [56,57] demonstrate the
prognostic value of endotoxin assessments, and support validating ap-
proaches to attenuate metabolic endotoxemia.
4.2. Vitamin C and barrier function
Animal studies support the concept that vitamin C can reduce the
sequelae of MetS. Although most animals used for basic research are
capable of synthesizing vitamin C, notable exceptions are guinea pigs
and a mutant strain of rats (osteogenic disorder syndrome; ODS rats).
Vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs in response to endotoxemia induction
have increased NF-κB responses in association with exaggerated sys-
temic shock and impaired lung phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis
[60–62], while dietary vitamin C supplementation attenuates en-
dotoxemia and intestinal barrier defects [62]. Vitamin C-deficient ODS
rats also demonstrate increased endotoxemia associated with increased
liver inflammation and gut dysfunction [63], increased gastric mucosal
lesions [64], acute phase responses [65], inflammatory chemokine and
cytokines [66], and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1
(CINC-1) [66]. They also have increased LDL [67], decreased HDL [68]
and impaired synthesis of apo-AI [69]. Thus, the association between
vitamin C deficiency and the hallmarks of MetS (i.e. gut barrier dys-
function, increased endotoxemia, inflammation, altered lipoproteins)
are supported by studies in vitamin C-deficient animals.
Vitamin C at pharmacological doses has demonstrated benefit to
manage sepsis. Intravenous (IV) ascorbate, which temporarily circum-
vents regulatory mechanisms that limit plasma ascorbate [26], is cur-
rently being used to treat sepsis and prevent sepsis-related mortality
[70–72]. Outcomes from IV ascorbate intervention studies provide
critical insights into ascorbate function. For example, administration of
LPS (IV, 20 IU/kg) to humans in an experimental setting decreased
plasma ascorbate concentrations and significantly decreased forearm
blood flow reactivity to acetylcholine, while administration of IV as-
corbate restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation, showing that
ascorbate blocks endotoxemia [73]. In separate studies, patients with
septic shock, who were administered IV ascorbate, had significant re-
ductions in pro-inflammatory biomarkers (i.e. C-reactive protein, pro-
calcitonin) [71], thereby demonstrating the close interrelationship of
inadequate vitamin C status, endotoxemia, and increased inflammation.
In agreement, vitamin C supplementation reverses these effects in vitro
[74], in translational models [62,75–77], and in humans [71,72].
4.3. Oxidative distress and intestinal mucosal barrier redox status
Ascorbate reacts as an antioxidant with hypochlorous acid, an anti-
microbial agent that is produced by neutrophils via myeloperoxidase
(MPO) [12]. Further, intestinal and circulating neutrophils accumulate
high ascorbate levels that function to protect themselves from MPO,
Fig. 2. Both endotoxemia and α-T bioavail-
ability are associated with plasma ascorbic
acid concentrations. A) Persons with MetS in

pherol concentrations (d6-α-T Cmax) during a
vitamin E pharmacokinetics trial [18].

 which is activated during bacterial phagocytosis [37]. Remarkably,
MPO also acts as an “ascorbate peroxidase” that directly consumes as-
corbate [78]. Thus, the oxidative distress that is evident in MetS con-
sists not only of non-specific lipid peroxidation that consumes α-TOH
[79] to potentially increase the risk for NAFLD [80,81], but is also is a
direct consequence of increased inflammatory responses (i.e. MPO) that
deplete vitamin C. Further, we have shown that insufficient ascorbate
results in the more rapid depletion of α-TOH [82,83]. Accordingly,
fecal concentrations of MPO, as well as calprotectin (an abundant
neutrophil protein that is released during inflammation [84]), may be
useful measures to evaluate intestinal inflammation and therapeutic
benefit of supplemental vitamin C. Similarly, restored α-TOH absorp-
tion and gut-liver trafficking that are otherwise dysregulated in MetS
[18] would be expected in response improved vitamin C status.
Another potential benefit of increased vitamin C intake is the im-
provement in barrier function caused by increasing collagen synthesis
in the intestine [77]. This proposed mechanism is consistent with as-
corbate's coenzyme function that hydroxylates proline and lysine to
cross-link collagen [85]. For example, studies in the T84 human crypt-
like epithelial cell line with indomethacin-induced barrier dysfunction
show that bacteria cross the epithelium via a transcellular pathway,
which is abrogated by treatment with vitamin C [74]. Thus, poor as-
corbate status at the gut likely exacerbates barrier dysfunction that
increases the translocation of LPS-derived Gram-negative bacteria to
potentiate inflammation.
Oxygen may play a critical role in gut health. Oxygen gradients
decrease steeply from the upper to lower gastrointestinal tract and also
increase from the lumen to the more vascularized epithelial layer.
Oxygen regulates microbial colonization with more oxygen-tolerant
bacteria in the mucosa (e.g. Helicobacter) whereas obligate anaerobes
(e.g. Firmicutes) are luminal [86,87]. Oxygen gradients also contribute
to microbial biogeography by influencing metabolite production and
modulating redox effectors (e.g. nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, ROS) of
either bacteria or host origin [88]. ROS generated by the intestinal
epithelium [89,90] function to exert redox-responsive cell signaling
(e.g. thiol redox switches) and maintain gut barrier integrity [91,92].
Gut dysbiosis in mouse models promotes obesity or MetS [93] and
dysregulates insulin secretion [94]. We are not aware of any studies
that have directly examined vitamin C alone on microbiota composition
or redox function, but when mice were fed an antioxidant supplement
they demonstrated decreased gut inflammation [46]. Importantly, in
early-weaned piglets with gut dysbiosis and decreased intestinal ROS-
detoxifying capacity, a vitamin C-rich antioxidant cocktail improved
intestinal redox status in association with increased proportions of
commensal bacteria and decreased pathogenic bacteria [95]. A vitamin
C-rich functional food also alleviated metabolic endotoxemia and liver
steatosis in a rat NAFLD model in association with improved microbiota
composition (i.e. greater α-diversity, increased Firmicutes/Bacter-
oidetes ratio) [96]. Further, studies in vitro with an antioxidant cocktail
containing vitamin C facilitated the successful culturing of anaerobic
protozoa in association with decreasing the oxidation-reduction po-
tential (i.e. more reduced environment) and increasing acetate, a short
chain fatty acid that is an important energy source for these micro-
organisms [97]. We therefore posit that greater vitamin C intakes can
directly attenuate metabolic endotoxemia in MetS by improving gut
barrier function, as well as improving microbial diversity and function.
Increased levels of circulating LPS have been observed following
strenuous aerobic exercise [98]. After exercise, the plasma ascorbate
free radical (Asc•-) increased, which suggests an increase in oxidative
distress. However, in this study, oral vitamin C supplementation
(1000 mg) decreased LPS concentrations and increased plasma ascor-
bate from 29 to 121 μM. As might be expected, supplementation also
increased the plasma Asc•- level both before and after exercise. [98]
5. Vitamin C as a pro-oxidant: cause for concern?
The Asc•- is generated in vivo by oxidation of ascorbate [99]. The
steady-state plasma Asc•- levels are affected by many parameters, in-
cluding the pH, concentrations of ascorbate and catalytic metals, as
well as the flux of oxidants. With appropriate controls, the steady-state
level of Asc•- can be used as an indicator of oxidant flux [100]. A
healthy level of plasma ascorbate is considered to be in the range of
≈ 40–80 µM. At these levels of ascorbate, the Asc•- concentration in
whole blood is typically below the limit of detection using standard
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) approaches.
However, IV ascorbate administration can increase plasma ascorbate
concentrations several hundred-fold because it bypasses tight gut-level
regulation that otherwise restricts excess absorption of oral vitamin C
[26]. For example, following repeated daily IV ascorbate infusions
(7,500 mg), peak plasma ascorbate reached ≈2 mM and Asc•- reached a
maximum of 200 nM [101]. Despite these high Asc•- concentrations,
biomarkers of pro-oxidant injury were not increased [101]. Further-
more, in a phase 1 clinical trial, large doses of IV ascorbate were given,
which elevated plasma ascorbate levels to 20–25 mM. Prior to IV as-
corbate infusion, Asc•- in whole blood samples was below the limit of
detection; however, Asc•- was readily observed immediately after IV
ascorbate infusion. Despite this Asc•- increase, the redox state of the
GSSG/2GSH couple, an indicator of oxidative distress, was unchanged
in erythrocytes and a marker of lipid peroxidation, F2-isoprostanes,
actually decreased [102]. These data indicate that high levels of as-
corbate and Asc•- do not provoke oxidative distress. Further, a recent
systematic review found IV ascorbate, despite achieving very high
blood ascorbate concentrations, to be safe [103].
How can the Asc•- increase without inducing adverse effects? Some
of the reactions involving vitamin C and its oxidized forms that can
occur in vivo are shown in Table 2 [104]. However, unlike many radi-
cals that provoke oxidant damage, Asc•- has limited reactivity. For ex-
ample, Asc•- does not covalently react with O2 to generate a more oxi-
dizing peroxyl radical, nor does it readily transfer an electron to
dioxygen to form superoxide; in fact it reacts readily with superoxide
[105]. By the same token, the two-electron oxidation product of as-
corbate, DHA also reacts with superoxide [106]. This is because Asc•- is
neither a strong oxidant nor a strong reductant. Indeed, one-electron
reduction potentials show that Asc•- is both a weak oxidant (Asc•-, H+/
AscH-; +282 mV), as well as a weak reductant, (DHA/Asc•-, −174 mV)
[99]. The observations above, in combination with the thermodynamics
of the DHA/Asc•- /AscH- triad, support that Asc•- is non-toxic from a free
radical biology standpoint; but physiologically, it may actually be re-
vealing favorable health benefits. This concept is consistent with ob-
servations that administration of IV ascorbate administration sufficient
to increase Asc•- has chemoprotective activity [107]. Thus, the in-
creased Asc•- presence indicates that ascorbate is performing its anti-
oxidant and biochemical functions well.

 Asc•- is uniquely different from the vast majority of free radicals.
Because it is so unreactive, it can easily be detected by EPR in plasma or
serum, provided both ascorbate and O2 are present. Although its for-
mation along with the generation of hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by
redox active metals (e.g. iron) [108], this reaction is limited because of
the low levels of redox active iron [109,110]. Further, normal cells have
a large capacity to remove H2O2 [111]. However, in disease, the level of
catalytic iron in cells and tissues can increase. A clear example is in
iron-overload disorders, ranging from issues arising from blood trans-
fusion to hemochromatosis [112,113]. Thus, while there may be con-
cern regarding vitamin C-iron interactions leadings to excess H2O2 ac-
cumulation in specialized populations, its broad use, including IV
ascorbate, has been shown to be quite safe [114].
6. Vitamin C: the critical link to vitamin E adequacy by improving
gut-liver function?
The interactions of antioxidants have been recognized by free ra-
dical chemists for decades [99,115]. We previously addressed this
question by investigating the turnover kinetics of α-TOH in cigarette
smokers; smokers had increased oxidative distress. We found that the
disappearance of α-TOH was inversely related to plasma ascorbate le-
vels [83], but could be normalized by vitamin C supplementation [82].
We have now focused on the possibility that α-TOH bioavailability is
highly dependent upon adequacy of vitamin C, not only to recycle and
maintain α-TOH [99], but also to enhance physiological functions along
the gut-liver axis that facilitate trafficking of α-TOH to achieve vitamin
E adequacy.
Bioavailability [116] is defined as it relates to α-TOH as the extent
and rate of α-TOH incorporation into the circulation, which is depen-
dent upon α-TOH absorption, lipoprotein incorporation, trafficking,
and lipoprotein-mediated tissue uptake, as well as hepatic catabolism
(Fig. 3) [117]. Increased inflammation and oxidative damage in asso-
ciation with low vitamin C status in persons with MetS potentiated
already poor α-TOH status by limiting α-TOH trafficking along the gut-
liver axis [18]. These findings likely help to explain why MetS persons
are at high-risk for liver dysfunction and liver injury that occurs in
NAFLD [118]. Further, it provides a strong premise for the favorable
outcomes of clinical interventions involving antioxidants for improved
liver health. For example, vitamin E supplementation in persons with
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) resolved histological evidence of
its presence in both adults and children [119,120], while also im-
proving liver function in adults [119]. Further, low vitamin C status has
been postulated to promote the progression of simple steatosis to NASH
[81], and an inverse association between vitamin C intake and NAFLD
has been observed in a cross sectional study [80]. These findings sug-
gest that antioxidants are a critical factor for normal function of the gut-
liver axis.
6.1. Oxidative distress depletes α-TOH
Increased oxidative distress results in faster disappearance rates of
plasma α-TOH in cigarette smokers [83,121]. Consistent with correla-
tive evidence that low vitamin C status increases the rate of dis-
appearance of α-TOH [83], findings from a randomized placebo-con-
trolled cross-over study demonstrated that vitamin C supplementation
(500 mg twice daily; 2-wk) restored the rates of disappearance of α-
TOH to levels no different from nonsmoking persons [82]. This ob-
servation is consistent with a mechanism by which ascorbate functions
as an electron-donor to reduce the α-tocopherol radical (α-TO•) back to
α-TOH, the functional form as a donor antioxidant, i.e. it recycles vi-
tamin E [99].
α-TO• + AscH- → α-TOH + Asc•-
Similar to smokers, inadequate vitamin C status in MetS persons
could, in part, impair α-TOH status by increasing oxidative α-TOH
depletion because biomarkers of oxidative distress and inflammation
are higher in MetS persons compared with healthy individuals
[18,19,122] (Fig. 3). Further, participants with MetS had lower plasma
ascorbic acid concentrations despite eating diets with similar amounts
of vitamin C as those consumed by healthy subjects for 3 days prior to
completing α-TOH pharmacokinetic studies [18]. In those pharmaco-
kinetic studies, α-TOH bioavailability was significantly reduced among
MetS persons. Increased oxidative distress and inflammatory bio-
markers were also inversely correlated with lower α-TOH enrichment in
chylomicrons and VLDL. This outcome suggests that poor α-TOH status
in MetS is also due to physiological impairments along the gut-liver axis
that prevent adequate α-TOH packaging and delivery to target tissues.
Thus, decreased vitamin C status in MetS likely contributes to the fur-
ther depletion of α-TOH.

TOH status
The paradigm in MetS of decreased α-TOH status is best described
by the concept of “physiological inadequacy” and is driven in MetS by
impaired trafficking of α-TOH along the gut-liver axis [18]. The chal-
lenge to interpret the lower α-TOH bioavailability and slower plasma α-
TOH turnover observed in MetS [18] is that α-TOH status is difficult to
assess in hyperlipidemic individuals. Because circulating lipoproteins
transport α-TOH with other lipids (e.g. triglyceride, cholesterol),
Fig. 3. Pathways of α-T trafficking, disposition and
catabolism. The “ - " and “+" symbols indicate pathways
that are likely altered by MetS. Dietary α-T, in the pre-
sence of biliary and pancreatic secretions forms micelles,
of which some is absorbed and the remainder excreted in
the feces. Enterocytes secrete α-T-containing chylomicrons
(CM) into the lymphatics, and following one pass through
the circulation, are taken up by the liver. Hepatic α-T has
several possible fates: (i) α-TTP can facilitate its transfer to
lipoproteins (e.g. VLDL, LDL, HDL) that transport α-T to
and from the periphery; (ii) α-T can be excreted in bile;
(iii) α-T can be catabolized to α-CEHC, which can be ex-
creted in bile for fecal excretion, or secreted into plasma,
transported to the kidney and excreted in urine [117]; (iv)
α-T can be oxidized by a peroxyl radical, but this is likely
rapidly reduced to α-T by other antioxidants, such as as-
corbate [137], or (v) α-T may remain in the liver in lipid
droplets. Abbreviations: α-T•, α-tocopheroxyl radical; α-

 elevated blood lipids “trap” α-TOH in the circulation. This process
yields apparently “normal” plasma α-TOH concentrations that mask the
fact that α-TOH concentrations in target tissues are inadequate, thereby
permitting oxidative injury [19,123]. We propose that a urinary vi-
tamin E catabolite, α-CEHC, can be used in conjunction with circulating
α-TOH as a more reliable biomarker of α-TOH status, especially among
hyperlipidemic persons where even lipid-normalized measures of α-
TOH status have limited interpretation [123].
Vitamin E catabolism is not a result of its antioxidant function, but
rather from a xenobiotic process that maintains vitamin E homeostasis
by preferentially catabolizing non-α-TOH forms of vitamin E [124].
While α-TOH is preferentially secreted into plasma as a function of the
hepatic α-TOH transfer protein (α-TTP) [125], cytochrome P450 4F2
initiates xenobiotic metabolism by ω-hydroxylation of the sidechain of
various vitamin E forms [124,126].
During xenobiotic catabolism, the α-TOH-13’-COOH then undergoes
several rounds of β-oxidation in the liver [127], which ultimately re-
sults in the formation of CEHC with carboxymethylbutyl-hydro-
xychromanol (CMBHC) as its immediate precursor (Fig. 4) [126]. It has
been hypothesized that α-CEHC is synthesized endogenously when
hepatic α-TOH concentrations exceed the capacity of α-TTP to facilitate
α-TOH secretion from the liver into the circulation [128]. The first
carboxy catabolite, α-TOH-13’-COOH, has been proposed as a potent
anti-inflammatory agent, which can inhibit 5-lipoxygenase a key en-
zyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid [129].
Thus, it is important to maintain sufficiently high vitamin E intakes so
that excess α-TOH could be used for this anti-inflammatory function.
Previously, we have reported that decreased α-TOH bioavailability
in MetS persons with poor vitamin C status is most likely attributed to
increased inflammation that impairs gut-liver functions that promote α-
TOH enrichment in intestinal-derived chylomicrons and facilitate its
secretion in VLDL from the liver [18]. We also found that this reduced
bioavailability of α-TOH, and hence low α-TOH status in MetS, was
reflected by less urinary α-CEHC excretion [19]. Thus, measures of α-
CEHC in conjunction with α-TOH pharmacokinetic responses can be
used to evaluate the extent to which vitamin C supplementation has
repaired gut and liver function. This approach provides a sensitive
measure of “gut to liver” trafficking of α-TOH and its hepatic catabo-
lism to α-CEHC (Fig. 4). Additionally, lower urinary excretion levels of
deuterium-labeled-α-CEHC
in
MetS
were
significantly
correlated
(p < 0.05) with higher plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, IL-
10, IL-6, insulin and lower plasma concentrations of HDL-C, as well as
with higher diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and BMI.
These findings suggest that our observations concerning vitamin E
catabolism are related to the heightened inflammation and impaired
cardiometabolic health in participants with MetS. Further, insufficient
vitamin C status in MetS likely impairs gut-liver functions to drive in-
creased α-TOH requirements. Establishing these interactions of vita-
mins C and E is important because > 92% of American adults fail to
meet dietary recommendations for vitamin E [130]; furthermore, a
large proportion of individuals have suboptimal circulating α-TOH
concentrations [131].
7. Summary and future research direction
Poor vitamin C status is associated with MetS [5], while better
health outcomes concerning metabolic health are associated with
higher ascorbate status [132]. Poor ascorbate status in MetS likely is
driven by gut inflammation and barrier dysfunction caused by excess
fat consumption [13]. This dysfunction increases LPS absorption and
causes endotoxemia [13,14], as well as decreased absorption of ascor-
bate [15], promoting a cycle of increasing inflammation and oxidative
damage that also further decreases both ascorbate and α-TOH status.
Inflammation likely also drives systemic depletion of ascorbate, as
shown in sepsis patients [133], who despite receiving 50 or 200 mg still
become deficient in vitamin C due to heightened immune responses in
septic shock that increase the rate of oxidation vitamin C, resulting in
its depletion [134]. Taken together, the available data support the
premise that endotoxemia promotes poor vitamin C status and ex-
acerbates inflammation along the gut-liver axis that increases the de-
mand for antioxidant defenses, especially vitamins C and E.
Although significant evidence from preclinical studies support the
concept of vitamin C-dependent improvements in gut-liver health, the
field is currently hampered in its advancement by a lack of clinical

 studies to evaluate these putative benefits on human health. Not only
could translational studies support specialized dietary recommenda-
tions for persons with MetS, they may also result in favorable public
health outcomes by alleviating the growing prevalence of this meta-
bolic condition. Initial steps towards evidence-based recommendations
will require direct hypothesis testing through controlled dietary inter-
ventions in MetS persons. Such studies would entail examining dietary
vitamin C depletion/repletion on changes in gut barrier dysfunction,
metabolic endotoxemia, and trafficking of vitamin E. Such studies are
feasible based on the technologies available to assess site-specific gut
barrier integrity in humans using sugar probes [135], metagenomics
techniques to evaluate microbiota composition and function [136] and
isotopically-labeled vitamin E to evaluate gut-liver lipoprotein secretion
and trafficking [18]. Outcomes of such studies would have important
public health impacts. Specifically, they would promote an under-
standing of the consequences of poor dietary quality relative to in-
adequate vitamin C status, which promotes endotoxemia and resulting
increased risk of metabolic disease due to inadequate antioxidant vi-
tamin protection.
