ABSTRACT: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed 
the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus 
docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly 
called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. 
Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of 
clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been 
examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary 
prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients 
at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary 
heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and 
focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid 
supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We 
limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major 
clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered 
secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the 
rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart 
Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the 
level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence 
from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update 
prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, 
and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with 
other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and 
prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, 
heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

n 2002, the American Heart Association (AHA) pub-
lished a scientific statement, “Fish Consumption, Fish 
Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Cardiovascular Dis-
ease.”1 At that time, evidence from 2 large randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that eicosapen-
taenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supple-
ments significantly reduced fatal cardiac events.2,3 The 
2002 scientific statement recommended that additional 
studies be done to confirm these findings and to define 
the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for 
both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD). On the basis of the evidence summa-
rized in 2002, the AHA recommended that patients with 
documented coronary heart disease (CHD) consume ≈1 
g/d EPA+DHA, preferably from oily fish, but EPA+DHA 
supplements could be considered in consultation with 
a physician.1 In the ensuing years, multiple RCTs have 
been conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementa-
tion of EPA+DHA, provided as prescription medications, 
supplements, or enriched margarine, on the occurrence 
of clinical CVD.
In this update to the 2002 scientific statement, 
we limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of 
supplementation with major clinical CVD end points. 
Details of the RCTs reviewed for this report are pro-
vided in evidence Tables 1 through 7. Secondarily, 
we considered evidence from meta-analyses of RCTs. 
Post hoc subgroup findings, such as among nonstatin 
users, from RCTs that were exploratory and hypoth-
esis generating are not reviewed here because the 
purpose of this advisory is to evaluate the effects of 
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supple-
mentation on primary clinical CVD outcomes in the 
patient populations enrolled in the RCTs. We also did 
not conduct a comprehensive review of the literature 
on the health effects of supplementation, in part be-
cause the goal of our focused review is to determine 
whether there was a need to update the 2002 AHA 
recommendations related to the impact of omega-3 
PUFA supplementation on clinical CVD. We note that 
observational studies have focused on fish intake or 
circulating omega-3 PUFAs and have not specifically 
assessed the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementa-
tion on clinical CVD.
In this advisory, we provide recommendations 
for clinicians and patients when supported by avail-
able evidence from RCTs of clinical CVD. We do not 
provide recommendations based on observational 
studies, physiological or mechanistic studies in hu-
man subjects, or a consensus of expert opinion when 
evidence is insufficient. We indicate in the text and 
Table 8 when the authors of the advisory failed to 
reach a consensus on the class of recommendation, 
and we present both the majority and minority recom-
mendations. We discuss various features of the avail-
able RCTs that may have contributed, at least in part, 
to inconsistent findings in the results of prior RCTs. 
Heterogeneity in the indications, study populations, 
interventions, and outcomes has challenged both 
quantitative and qualitative efforts to synthesize the 
evidence on omega-3 PUFA supplements and clinical 
CVD. We focus on the effects of omega-3 PUFA (the 
term we use to refer to the marine-based omega-3 
PUFA, EPA, and DHA) supplementation in this advi-
sory. This report does not examine studies of dietary 
omega-3 PUFAs from seafood and dietary intake of 
plant-based omega-3 PUFA such as α-linolenic acid 
and clinical CVD.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
OMEGA-3 PUFA (FISH OIL) SUPPLEMENTS
Nonprescription Omega-3 PUFA Supplements
In 2012, 7.8% of adults in the United States (18.8 million) 
reported consuming a fish oil dietary supplement within 
the prior 30 days.18 The primary source of nonprescription 
omega-3 PUFA supplements is fish oil, composed primar-
ily of triglycerides. Some preparations are now available 
as ethyl esters and phospholipids. These supplements 
frequently contain other essential nutrients, including vita-
min D, vitamin E, and mixed tocopherols.19 A recent US 
Department of Agriculture survey of omega-3 PUFA sup-
plements concluded that the most common amounts per 
dose were 180 mg for EPA and 120 mg for DHA.20 The US 
Department of Agriculture supported a study that chemi-
cally analyzed a representative group of commonly avail-
able omega-3 PUFA supplements and concluded that the 
analytical content of EPA and DHA was for the most part 
reflective of the labeled amounts.20 The omega-3 PUFA 
supplements that have been voluntarily tested to confirm 
content independently can be identified by the presence of 
the US Pharmacopeia Convention symbol on the label.21
Prescription Preparations
Currently, there are 5 prescription omega-3 PUFA prod-
ucts available in the United States that are approved for 
the indication of treating severe hypertriglyceridemia. 
These include 4 preparations of omega-3-ethyl esters of 
EPA with or without DHA and 1 preparation composed of 
omega-3 PUFAs in the free fatty acid form.22 The amount 
and ratio of EPA and DHA vary in different preparations. 
Of note, the bioavailability of EPA and DHA also varies by 
the chemical form: Products containing ethyl esters may 
have somewhat lower bioavailability than the free fatty 
acid forms.23 Absorption of both ethyl esters and free fat-
ty acids is enhanced by the presence of dietary fat.24–26
OMEGA-3 PUFA SUPPLEMENTATION AND  
CLINICAL CVD
In the synthesis below, we briefly summarize the pri-
mary clinical questions, approach, findings, and impli-
cations of the available RCTs of omega-3 PUFA supple-
mentation and clinical CVD. The details of the RCTs 
reviewed in the advisory, including the study name, 
clinical indication, study population, sample size, dose 
and formation, follow-up, major findings, and limita-
tions, are provided in the evidence Tables 1 through 7 
and are not included in the text.
PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CHD
There are no reports from RCTs that have targeted exclu-
sively the primary prevention of CHD, that is, the effects 
of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the general population 
of patients without prior CHD. No recommendation for 
treatment with omega-3 PUFA supplements can be made 
for this segment of the population.
PREVENTION OF CVD MORTALITY IN 
DIABETES MELLITUS/PREDIABETES
One large RCT (details provided in Table 1) was de-
signed to examine the effects of omega-3 PUFA supple-
mentation on cardiovascular death among patients with 
or at risk for diabetes mellitus (based on impaired fast-
ing glucose, impaired glucose tolerance). In the ORI-
GIN trial (Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Inter-
vention), the 12 
536 patients randomized to omega-3 
PUFA supplement or placebo were at high risk of CVD, 
with the majority having had a prior CHD event.4 Supple-
mentation with omega-3 PUFA did not affect the risk of 
death resulting from cardiovascular causes or the other 
prespecified secondary cardiovascular outcomes. Ad-
ditionally, post hoc subgroup analyses of patients with 
and without diabetes mellitus or markers of dysglyce-
mia from 5 large RCTs of omega-3 PUFA supplementa-
tion (all included patients with and without prior clinical 
CHD) yielded mixed findings.6,8,12,27,28 There was little 
evidence of a lower risk of CVD among patients with 
or at risk for diabetes mellitus in 2 trials and some 
evidence that these patients may benefit as much as 
or more than those without dysglycemia in the 3 other 
trials. Taken together, available data do not support 
omega-3 PUFA supplementation among patients with 
diabetes mellitus or prediabetes to prevent cardiovas-
cular events. We note that there is a large ongoing RCT 
in the United Kingdom, ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovas-
cular Events in Diabetes), that seeks to examine the ef-
fects of omega-3 PUFA supplements on cardiovascular 
events among patients with diabetes mellitus and free 
of prior clinical CVD.29
Overall, the current evidence from RCTs suggests 
no benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation among 
patients with or at risk for diabetes mellitus to prevent 
CVD (Treatment is not indicated: Class III: No Benefit 
Recommendation).
PREVENTION OF CHD AMONG PATIENTS  
AT HIGH CVD RISK
In addition to the ORIGIN trial, 3 trials (details are pro-
vided in Table 2) enrolled patients at high CVD risk with 
and without prior clinical CHD.4–7 In each of these trials, 
the patients enrolled who were free of prior clinical CHD 
were considered at high risk for CHD on the basis of 
the presence of prior atherosclerotic disease in another 
vascular bed; for example, stroke or peripheral vascu-
lar disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia.

Two of the 3 trials showed no benefit from omega-3 
PUFA supplementation on clinical CHD.6,7
The JELIS trial (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study) 
reported results by prior CVD status.5 Although 80% of 
the patients had no prior clinical CVD, all of the patients 
had a total cholesterol >6.5 mmol/L (>250 mg/dL). 
Patients were randomly assigned to either statin alone 
or statin with 1800 mg/d EPA. The primary end point 
was a composite outcome comprising major coronary 
events, including sudden cardiac death (SCD), fatal and 
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and other nonfatal 
events (unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stent-
ing, or coronary artery bypass grafting). The compos-
ite outcome was reduced among patients treated with 
the omega-3 PUFA supplement: The relative risk (RR) 
reduction was 19% (P=0.01) overall, 19% (P=0.048) 
in those with prior CVD, and 18% (P=0.132) in those 
without prior CVD (P for interaction=0.95). The risk re-
duction occurred primarily from a reduction in unstable 
angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, or percutane-
ous transluminal coronary angioplasty. There was little 
evidence of risk reduction in the hard end points of non-
fatal MI and CHD death.
Overall, there was a lack of consensus on whether 
current evidence from RCTs suggested no benefit of 
omega-3 PUFA supplements among patients at high CVD 
risk, in part because of differences in the weight given to 
the results of the JELIS trial. Although the majority of co-
authors concluded that treatment is not indicted (Class 
III: No Benefit Recommendation), a minority of coauthors 
concluded that treatment of these patients is reasonable 
(Class IIb Recommendation).
SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CHD AND SCD 
AMONG PATIENTS WITH PREVALENT CHD
Five large RCTs, the details of which are provided in 
 
Table 3, have evaluated the effects of omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events in 
patients with prior clinical CHD.2,3,8–10 The average 
dose of omega-3 PUFA was ≈1000 mg/d, and the av-
erage mean duration of the trials was 2 years (range, 
1.0–6.2 years). Primary end points varied across 
these trials. To increase statistical power, several tri-
als evaluated the effects of supplementation on a pri-
mary end point that combined major adverse cardio-
vascular events such as the sum of nonfatal MI, fatal 
CHD, stroke, and CVD death, sometimes also including 
coronary revascularization and angina.
The 2 trials in patients with prior CHD, cited in the 
2002 statement, suggested a benefit of omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation.2,3 One trial demonstrated a reduction in 
hard CVD end points (CVD death, nonfatal MI, and nonfa-
tal stroke: RR, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68–
0.94) among patients with recent MI (within 3 months), 
attributable mostly to a reduction in SCD.2 A second trial 
found that providing an omega-3 PUFA supplement or fish 
advice significantly reduced CHD death but not total CHD 
among patients with recent MI (mean, ≈1.5 months). Of 
note, only one third of the patients in the second RCT 
took an omega-3 PUFA supplement.3 It was included in the 
2002 report, in part because this report focused both on 
dietary intake and omega-3 PUFA supplementation.
Since the 2002 report, 3 additional secondary pre-
vention trials have examined the impact of omega-3

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
PUFA supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events. 
Each found little evidence of an effect of fish oil on its 
primary clinical CVD end point. These trials included a 
short-term (1 year) trial that focused on the prevention 
of SCD (n=57 events) among patients with recent MI,8 a 
trial evaluating major adverse cardiovascular events in 
patients with a distant history of MI (median interval, 3.7 
years),9 and a trial in patients with a recent history of MI, 
unstable angina, or ischemic stroke (within 1 year).10 An-
other RCT, not included in our evidence table, reported 
that advice to increase fish intake or omega-3 PUFA sup-
plementation in patients with clinical angina increased 
the risk of SCD30; however, this was a study of primarily 
dietary advice, not supplementation.
A meta-analysis published in 2012 examined the ef-
fects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation and dietary in-
take in 20 RCTs that enrolled patients at high CVD risk or 
prevalent CHD and patients with an implantable cardio-
verter-defibrillator (total n=68 
680). That meta-analysis 
demonstrated a reduction in CHD death (RR, 0.91; 95% 
CI, 0.85–0.98), possibly as the result of a lower risk of 
SCD (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.01).11 Seven of the trials 
reported the findings for SCD as a separate outcome. 
Of note, the magnitude of the reduction in total mortal-
ity, shown to be attributable mostly to a reduction CHD 
death, was greater in the studies published before 2002 
than in the more recent studies.
Taken together, the cumulative findings from RCTs 
suggest that omega-3 PUFA supplements may reduce 
CHD death, possibly through a reduction in ischemia-
induced SCD, among patients with prior CHD, but the 
treatment does not reduce the incidence of recurrent 
nonfatal MI. Additionally, given that the benefit likely 
outweighs any risk of treatment, the majority of co-
authors concluded that treatment with omega-3 PUFA 
supplements is reasonable for the secondary preven-
tion of CHD death (Class IIa Recommendation); a mi-
nority of coauthors preferred a slightly lower strength 
of recommendation for treatment of patients with this 
indication (Class IIb Recommendation).
PRIMARY PREVENTION OF STROKE
No reports from RCTs of omega-3 PUFA supplements 
have targeted stroke prevention; that is, stroke was not 
the primary outcome in any RCT. However, stroke was in-
cluded as part of a composite clinical CVD outcome in 9 
of 20 RCTs included in a recent meta-analysis11 (Table 4). 
In this meta-analysis, there was little evidence of a reduc-
tion in stroke events in those treated with omega-3 PUFA 
supplements (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93–1.18; P=0.47). 
The findings were similar when examined by whether the 
study sample had prior clinical CHD, the dose of omega-3 
PUFA, and study blinding. The meta-analysis did not ex-
amine the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on hemorrhagic and 
ischemic stroke separately. Of note, other meta-analyses 
reported similar findings.31–33
In the 2 studies that examined stroke subtype (isch-
emic and hemorrhagic) separately, there was little dif-
ference in the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplements 
on the risk of each stroke subtype.5,12 Since the meta-
analysis in 2012, 2 additional RCTs have reported the 
effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on stroke 
outcomes.6,7 In both of these studies, there was little 
evidence that omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduced 
the risk of stroke, both fatal and nonfatal, although there

was a small number of events. Of note, there also is 
little evidence to suggest that omega-3 PUFA supple-
mentation increases the risk of stroke.
Overall, there is no proven benefit of omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation as a means to reduce the risk of stroke 
among patients without a history of stroke (Class III: No 
Benefit Recommendation).
SECONDARY PREVENTION OF STROKE
No RCTs have been designed to examine the effects of 
omega-3 PUFA supplements on cardiovascular events, 
either stroke or other CVDs, among patients with a pri-
or stroke. However, in a post hoc analysis of patients 
with a history of stroke from JELIS, recurrent stroke 
occurred in 33 of the 485 patients (6.8%) randomized 
to EPA versus 48 of 457 patients (10.5%) in the control 
group, for a risk reduction of recurrent stroke of 20% 
(RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64–0.997; number needed to 
treat, 27).34 Given the post hoc analysis, small number 
of events, borderline statistical significance unadjusted 
for multiple testing, and other limitations of the study 
mentioned elsewhere in this advisory, the findings from 
JELIS should be considered hypothesis generating.
Overall, there is no evidence of benefit of omega-3 
PUFA supplementation as a means to reduce the risk of 
recurrent stroke or other CVDs among patients with a 
prior stroke (No Recommendation).
PRIMARY PREVENTION OF HEART FAILURE
To date, no published RCTs have assessed the effect of 
omega-3 PUFA supplements on the primary prevention 
of heart failure. On this basis, no recommendation for 
treatment with omega-3 PUFA supplements can be made 
for the primary prevention of heart failure.
SECONDARY PREVENTION OF OUTCOMES IN 
PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE
In a large RCT (details provided in Table 5) among 
patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart 
Association class II–IV), the effects of omega-3 PUFA 
supplements on the risk of morbidity or mortality 
were examined. Among patients with clinically diag-
nosed heart failure (of any type, severity, and cause), 
omega-3 PUFA supplementation reduced the risk of 
total mortality (death resulting from any cause) by 
9% (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.833–0.998; P=0.041) and 
the risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations 
or death by 8% (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.849–0.999; 
P=0.009) after prespecified adjustment for hospi-
talization for heart failure during the preceding year, 
previous pacemaker, and aortic stenosis.12 Of note, 
91% of the patients enrolled in the RCT had heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular 
ejection fraction <40%), limiting the generalizability 
of the findings in this population. These findings sug-
gest that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may reduce 
heart failure–related hospitalizations and death in pa-
tients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. 
However, heart failure is a heterogeneous disorder, 
particularly among older adults and women, and fur-
ther trials are needed to determine whether the ben-
efits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on prognosis 
vary according to the type, severity, and cause of 
heart failure.
Although based on a single, large RCT, treatment 
with omega-3 PUFA supplements is reasonable among 
patients with heart failure with reduced ejection frac-
tion (Class IIa Recommendation). RCTs are needed 
among patients with heart failure and preserved ejec-
tion fraction.

PRIMARY PREVENTION OF ATRIAL 
FIBRILLATION
There are no data from large randomized, placebo-con-
trolled RCTs of the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementa-
tion on the primary prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF). On 
this basis, no recommendation for treatment with omega-3 
PUFA supplements can be made for the primary preven-
tion of AF. This clinical question should be the focus of 
future RCTs.35
SECONDARY PREVENTION OF AF IN PATIENTS 
WITH PRIOR AF
Two large RCTs, details provided in Table 6, have exam-
ined the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the 
risk of recurrent AF.13,14 In a large RCT, supplementation 
with omega-3 PUFAs did not reduce recurrent AF in pa-
tients overall (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.98–1.52; P=0.08) or 
among subgroups of patients with paroxysmal or persis-
tent AF examined separately.13 Another large RCT also 
found little evidence of benefit of omega-3 PUFA supple-
mentation on recurrent AF (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.90–1.83; 
P=0.17).14 In a meta-analysis that included these 2 larger 
and 6 smaller RCTs, the risk reduction estimate for the 
effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on recurrent 
AF was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.79–1.13).15 Two additional 
RCTs have been published since the meta-analysis, and 
both reported little evidence of benefit of omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation on recurrent AF.36,37 The consistent null 
findings in RCTs is notable given the diverse study design 
features, including patient characteristics, duration of 
treatment, and dose of omega-3 PUFA.
Overall, high-quality evidence from multiple RCTs does 
not support omega-3 PUFA supplementation to prevent 
recurrent AF (Class III: No Benefit Recommendation).
AF AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY
In a large, placebo-controlled RCT of short-term 
omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the prevention of 
postoperative AF after cardiac surgery, omega-3 PUFA 
did not reduce the risk of postoperative AF (RR, 0.96; 
95% CI, 0.77–1.20; P=0.74; Table 7).16 Five additional 
placebo-controlled RCTs also have reported null find-
ings, although these other trials were limited by low 
statistical power (range of postoperative AF events in 
these RCTs, 24–91).38–42 A meta-analysis including all 
6 placebo-controlled RCTs found an RR of 0.92 (95% 
CI, 0.78–1.10).17
Overall, findings from placebo-controlled RCTs, includ-
ing 1 large, adequately powered RCT, do not demonstrate 
a benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation as a means 
to prevent postoperative AF in patients undergoing car-
diac surgery (Class III: No Benefit Recommendation).
MECHANISMS
Although not the focus on this advisory, various mech-
anisms could plausibly explain clinical outcome ben-
efits derived from omega-3 PUFA supplementation. We 
note that a recent review by 2 of the coauthors of this 
advisory (D.M. and J.W) examined available evidence, 
including mechanistic studies, related to the effects of 
omega-3 PUFAs (including dietary omega-3 PUFAs) on 
molecular pathways and risk factors.43 The proposed 
mechanism for the effect on CHD death is related to 
the physiological effects of omega-3 PUFAs in the set-
ting of ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation, which 
includes stabilization of ischemic-induced myocyte 
membrane resting depolarization, rather than major ef-
fects on atherosclerotic progression, plaque stability, 
plaque rupture, or thrombosis.43 Consistent with this 
hypothesis, 2 of 3 trials showing benefit were among 
patients with recent MI, few of whom underwent revas-
cularization procedures,3,44 in which ischemia-induced 
ventricular fibrillation is a major cause of death. The 
largest trial found that benefits were attributable to re-
duced SCD rather than other types of cardiac death 
or nonfatal MI.44 Although omega-3 supplementation 
affects multiple risk factors and pathways that might 
account for the observed benefit of supplementation in 
patients with heart failure and impaired left ventricular 
function, whether there is a predominant mechanism 
that accounts for this effect requires further investiga-
tion. Of note, the doses of omega-3 PUFA supplements 
(≈1000 mg) used in the studies cited in this advisory, 
except for the dose used in the JELIS study (1800 
mg), are generally too low to meaningfully lower tri-
glyceride levels.45–48
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
For the major clinical indications of omega-3 PUFA sup-
plementation noted above, we summarize the strength 
of the recommendation and the level of evidence for 
omega-3 supplementation on the basis of RCTs of clini-
cal end points in Table 8. The criteria used to assign 
the strength of the recommendation and the level of 
evidence are included in the Data Supplement Table. 
We concluded that available evidence does not support 
the use of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the general 
population who are not at high CVD risk, including those 
with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes. Given the avail-
able evidence, there was a lack of consensus about the 
benefits of treatment among those at high CVD risk, as 
noted above. On the basis of the cumulative evidence 
from RCTs with clinical end points, we reassessed the 
recommendations made in the 2002 scientific state-
ment and continue to suggest that, in consultation with 
a physician, omega-3 PUFA supplementation is reason-
able for secondary prevention of CHD in patients with a

recent CHD event such as a recent MI. We also added 
a new recommendation for patients with heart failure 
with reduced left ventricular function, in whom treat-
ment with omega-3 PUFA supplementation might also 
be considered. In contrast, available evidence either is 
lacking or does not support the use of omega-3 PUFA 
supplements as a therapy to prevent incident or recur-
rent stroke and AF. Finally, it is noteworthy that within 
the context of the low doses used in the large RCTs of 
clinical cardiovascular events, there was little evidence 
of major adverse effects such as stroke or bleeding 
associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation (data 
not shown).49
DISCUSSION
In this advisory, we focus on evidence from RCTs related 
to the use of omega-3 PUFA supplements to reduce the 
risk of clinical CVD. Recent evidence has raised questions 
about the recommendations included in the AHA scientific 
statement of 2002 related to secondary prevention of CHD 
and SCD.8–10 Furthermore, evidence related to outcomes 
in patients with heart failure and AF was unavailable at that 
time. Below, we briefly summarize some of the issues in 
the interpretation and application of this evidence.

including chronic progression of stable atherosclerot-

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
ing ischemic-induced ventricular fibrillation, other ar-
rhythmias caused by acute ischemia, and a range of 
cardiac arrhythmias arising from underlying structural 
heart disease rather than acute ischemia. Although 
some determinants of the different pathways leading to 
these conditions are shared (eg, high blood pressure 
increases chronic progression of atherosclerosis, acute 
plaque rupture, and SCD), each of these risk pathways 
also has distinct etiologic and physiological determi-
nants. Just as omega-3 PUFAs have varying dose and 
time responses on pathways of cardiovascular risk, the 
effects on clinical cardiovascular events also appear to 
vary, depending on the specific end point and its patho-
physiological determinants.
The reduction in CHD mortality, presumably by reduc-
ing SCD, is a likely benefit of omega-3 PUFA therapy. 
However, the magnitude of this effect has become more 
uncertain over time. The cumulative meta-analysis of 20 
studies included in our review calculated an ≈10% reduc-
tion in CHD death and SCD but also revealed a striking 
variation in effect size by study date, with earlier studies 
showing large reductions and later studies showing no 
benefit.11 Several explanations could account for these 
discrepant results.
First, observational evidence supports a nonlinear 
effect of omega-3 PUFA on CHD death.50 With increas-
ing public focus on omega-3 consumption,51,52 the 
background dietary consumption of fish in recent trials 
was generally higher than that observed in earlier stud-
ies. (High dietary consumption was particularly evident 
in JELIS, which was conducted in Japan.) Consequently, 
many subjects in recent trials may have already been 
consuming AHA-recommended amounts of omega-3 
PUFAs (eg, at least 1–2 weekly servings of fatty fish) 
so that additional modest omega-3 PUFA supplementa-
tion (eg, 1 g/d) would produce little measurable benefit 
on the risk of CHD death.
Second, it is possible that omega-3 PUFA supplemen-
tation has little benefit in the presence of maximal medi-
cal treatment of CHD (eg, statin therapy, β-blockers, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and 
revascularization). As noted above, fewer patients in the 
earlier trials received statin therapy or revascularization 
after MI; these therapies were much more common in 
recent trials. Potential interaction by background medi-
cations was examined in the primary results reports of 
several trials. One trial4 identified effect modification 
by statin or β-blocker use, although statistical power in 
these subgroup analyses was limited.7,53
Third, post hoc power calculations indicate that 
most recent trials in post-MI patients were substan-
tially underpowered to detect a clinically meaningful 
effect on CHD death, with even less power to detect 
an effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the risk 
of SCD.43 Several of these trials had to alter and ex-
pand their primary end point during follow-up because 
of lower-than-anticipated event rates. Indeed, the risk 
of recurrent events among contemporary patients with 
CHD events is much lower than the corresponding risk 
of post-MI patients from 15 to 20 years ago. Thus, the 
role of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the patient with 
CHD who receives optimal guideline-based therapy in 
2017 is not entirely settled.
On the other hand, we note that even if the benefit 
based on the cumulative evidence is quantitatively mod-
est, a potential reduction in CHD death of 10% would jus-
tify the use of a relatively safe therapy such as omega-3 
PUFA. Although benefits also could be greater in certain 
subsets of patients with CHD such as those with a low 
ejection fraction or low circulating levels of omega-3 PU-
FAs from marine sources, this will need to be demon-
strated in future RCTs. Several trials of omega-3 PUFA 
supplementation that may address some of these issues 
are underway.
Other efforts to synthesize the available evidence 
on the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplements on clini-
cal CVD may have come to different conclusions. These 
differences likely reflect differences in the purpose and 
approach to synthesizing the available evidence. We 
have taken a clinical approach, focusing on RCTs with 
clinical cardiovascular outcomes and the most common 
indications for omega-3 PUFA supplements related to 
clinical cardiovascular events. We have not conflated the 
question of the role of omega-3 PUFA supplementation 
with the effects of omega-3 PUFA intake from seafood 
on clinical CVD, in part, because supplementation and 
dietary intake of omega-3 PUFAs differ in many ways. 
Furthermore, the patient populations, restriction to RCTs 
with clinical cardiovascular end points, and clinical rec-
ommendations addressed in this advisory on omega-3 
PUFA supplements differ from the study populations and 
observational study designs available to assess the im-
pact of omega-3 PUFA intake from seafood on CVD. In 
an effort to reduce the confusion among clinicians, pa-
tients, and the public, we have restricted this advisory to 
clinical questions related to omega-3 PUFA supplements.
Although we did not conduct a formal systematic 
evidence review of the health effects of omega-3 PUFA 
supplements, we agreed on the parameters of the sci-
entific advisory before beginning the review and sought 
to be transparent. Whereas clinical scientists frequently 
differ in how best to handle heterogeneity in study de-
sign and findings, especially when findings appear to be 
inconsistent, we recognize that clinicians and patients 
need to make decisions in the context of uncertainty. Be-
cause RCTs of major disease end points, when available, 
should trump studies of intermediate end points and 
mechanistic studies when clinical decisions are being 
made, we restricted our focus to RCTs. As noted previ-
ously, except for JELIS, all of the RCTs used low doses of 
omega-3 PUFA supplements. Higher doses of omega-3 
PUFA supplements are being studied in ongoing RCTs

(REDUCE-IT [Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With 
EPA–Intervention Trial] and STRENGTH [Statin Residual 
Risk Reduction With Epanova in High CV Risk Patients 
With Hypertriglyceridemia]). Additionally, most of the 
RCTs were of relatively short-term duration of omega-3 
PUFA intake. We acknowledge that a lack of evidence of 
a benefit differs from evidence of a lack of effect. We 
look forward to future reports that address the gaps in 
evidence that we documented. As findings from ongoing 
RCTs are reported, we will assess the need to further 
update this advisory. Importantly, we note that the risk 
of major adverse effects such as bleeding and stroke 
associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation was low 
in the RCTs of clinical cardiovascular outcomes (data not 
shown). In this context of uncertain benefit but no appar-
ent major risk, patient preferences should also influence 
clinical decisions.
CONCLUSIONS
Although recent RCT evidence has raised questions 
about the benefits of omega-3 supplementation to pre-
vent clinical CVD events, the recommendation for pa-
tients with prevalent CHD such as a recent MI remains 
essentially unchanged: Treatment with omega-3 PUFA 
supplements is reasonable for these patients. Even a 
potential modest reduction in CHD mortality (10%) in 
this clinical population would justify treatment with a 
relatively safe therapy. We now recommend treatment 
for patients with prevalent heart failure without pre-
served left ventricular function to reduce mortality and 
hospitalizations (9%) on the basis of a single, large RCT. 
Although we do not recommend treatment for patients 
with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes to prevent CHD, 
there was a lack of consensus on the recommendation 
for patients at high CVD risk. On the other hand, we 
do not recommend treatment to prevent incident stroke 
among patients at high CVD risk and recurrent AF. Be-
cause there are no reported RCTs related to the primary 
prevention of CHD, heart failure, and AF, we were not 
able to make recommendations for these indications. 
RCTs in progress with clinical CVD end points may in-
form recommendations related to these potential indica-
tions for omega-3 PUFA supplementation.
