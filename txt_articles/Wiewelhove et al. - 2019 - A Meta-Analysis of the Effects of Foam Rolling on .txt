Foam rolling is thought to improve muscular performance and flexibility as well as to
alleviate muscle fatigue and soreness. For this reason, foam rolling has become a popular
intervention in all kinds of sport settings used to increase the efficiency of training or
competition preparation as well as to speed post-exercise recovery. The objective of
this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of foam rolling applied before (pre-rolling
as a warm-up activity) and after (post-rolling as a recovery strategy) exercise on sprint,
jump, and strength performance as well as on flexibility and muscle pain outcomes
and to identify whether self-massage with a foam roller or a roller massager is more
effective. A comprehensive and structured literature search was performed using the
PubMed, Google Scholar, PEDro, and Cochrane Library search engines. Twenty-one
studies were located that met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies used pre-rolling,
while seven studies used post-rolling. Pre-rolling resulted in a small improvement in sprint
performance (+0.7%, g = 0.28) and flexibility (+4.0%, g = 0.34), whereas the effect on
jump (−1.9%, g = 0.09) and strength performance (+1.8%, g = 0.12) was negligible.
Post-rolling slightly attenuated exercise-induced decreases in sprint (+3.1%, g = 0.34)
and strength performance (+3.9 %, g = 0.21). It also reduced muscle pain perception
(+6.0%, g = 0.47), whereas its effect on jump performance (−0.2%, g = 0.06) was trivial.
Of the twenty-one studies, fourteen used foam rollers, while the other seven used roller
massage bars/sticks. A tendency was found for foam rollers to offer larger effects on
the recovery of strength performance (+5.6%, g = 0.27 vs. −0.1%, g = −0.01) than
roller massagers. The differences in the effects between foam rolling devices in terms
of pre-rolling did not seem to be of practical relevance (overall performance: +2.7 %,
g = 0.11 vs. +0.4%, g = 0.21; flexibility: +5.0%, g = 0.32 vs. +1.6%, g = 0.39). Overall,
it was determined that the effects of foam rolling on performance and recovery are rather
minor and partly negligible, but can be relevant in some cases (e.g., to increase sprint
performance and flexibility or to reduce muscle pain sensation). Evidence seems to justify
the widespread use of foam rolling as a warm-up activity rather than a recovery tool.

Effects of Foam Rolling
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, foam rolling has become a common practice in all
kinds of sport settings and is highly regarded within the strength
and conditioning field for increasing the efficiency of training
or competition preparation and for accelerating post-exercise
recovery (Healey et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2015; Monteiro and
Neto, 2016). Foam rolling (FR) is a form of self-massage in which
the targeted musculature is rolled and compressed utilizing a FR
device (Peacock et al., 2014). Common FR tools include the foam
roller and various types of roller massage bars/sticks, which come
in several sizes and foam densities.
With foam rollers, athletes use their bodyweight to apply
pressure to the soft tissues during the rolling motion, while
roller massagers are applied with the upper extremities to the
target muscles (Cheatham et al., 2015). The motions place both
direct and sweeping pressure on the soft tissue, stretching it and
generating friction between it and the FR device. Consequently,
FR can be considered a form of self-induced massage because
the pressure that the roller exerts on the muscles resembles the
pressure exerted on the muscles through manual manipulation
by the user himself (Pearcey et al., 2015). Some reasons why
self-massage through FR has become a popular intervention
technique used by both elite athletes and recreationally active
individuals may be its affordable, easy, and time-efficient
applicability as well as its close relationship to massage, which in
turn is believed to benefit athletes by enhancing performance and
recovery (Weerapong et al., 2005).
However, despite the popularity of FR, no consensus
exists on its benefits (Cheatham et al., 2015; Pearcey et al.,
2015). This may be partly due to the fact that few studies
have
examined
the
underlying
physiological
mechanisms
of FR. Nevertheless, the potential effects of FR have been
attributed
to
mechanical,
neurological,
physiological,
and
psychophysiological
parameters
(Aboodarda
et
al.,
2015;
Cavanaugh et al., 2017; Monteiro et al., 2018; Phillips et al.,
2018). The mechanical mechanisms are comprised of a number
of sub-mechanisms, such as reduction in tissue adhesion,
altered tissue stiffness, and thixotropic responses (Aboodarda
et al., 2015; Kelly and Beardsley, 2016). Within neurological
models, it is theorized that FR may potentiate analgesic
effects and muscular recovery by mediating pain-modulatory
systems (e.g., nociceptor and mechanoreceptor sensitivity
and/or
diffuse
noxious
inhibitory
control)
(Cavanaugh
et al., 2017; Jo et al., 2018). The proposed physiological
mechanisms are increased blood flow and parasympathetic
circulation, as well as inflammatory responses and associated
trigger-point break down (Aboodarda et al., 2015; Kelly and
Beardsley, 2016). Psychophysiological responses may include
improved perceptions of well-being and recovery due to the
increase of plasma endorphins, decreased arousal level, an
activation of the parasympathetic response and/or placebo effect
(Weerapong et al., 2005; Phillips et al., 2018).
Due to the potential underlying physiological mechanisms, it
is believed that FR can improve both acute athletic performance
as well as recovery from an intensive bout of physical activity
(Cheatham et al., 2015). Therefore, studies on the effects of
FR have either determined whether massage-like mechanical
pressure with a foam roller or roller massager prior to activity
affects muscle performance (i.e., pre-rolling as a warm-up
activity), or whether FR after an intense bout of exercise
enhances muscle recovery (i.e., post-rolling as a recovery tool).
Unfortunately, the literature on FR that does exist is equivocal
and insufficient, which is why the widespread use of FR is to
date not fully supported by the available empirical data. In
addition, there is currently no meta-analysis that has evaluated
the literature and calculated the pooled effects of FR. This
creates a gap in the translation from research to practice
for strength and conditioning coaches who use FR tools and
recommend these products to their athletes (Cheatham et al.,
2015). Accordingly, the aims of the study were to conduct a
meta-analytical review of the effects of pre-rolling and post-
rolling on performance, flexibility, and muscle pain outcomes
in healthy and physically active individuals and to identify
whether self-massage with a foam roller or a roller massager is
more effective.
METHODS
Search Strategy
A comprehensive and structured search of articles were
performed using the PubMed, Google Scholar, PEDro, and
Cochrane Library search engines. Different sets of seven key
terms (“self-massage,” “foam rolling,” “roller massage,” “roller
massager,” “self-myofascial release,” “performance,” “recovery”)
were combined by Boolean logic (“AND,” “OR”), and the results
were limited to human subjects that were healthy and physically
active as well as to articles written in English. Each database
was searched from the earliest available article up to December
2017. We also searched the reference lists of all incoming
articles and extracted the appropriate publications. From the
954 abstracts reviewed, 110 potentially suitable articles were
identified (Figure 1).
Selection Criteria
The selection of articles for inclusion in this meta-analysis was
based on the following criteria. First, only publications that
appeared in an international, peer-reviewed scientific journal
were selected. Second, a FR intervention had to have been done
as part of the analysis, regardless of which type of FR device
was used for the intervention. Third, the FR intervention had
to have been used either as a warm-up or a recovery routine.
Fourth, before and after the FR intervention, measurements of
performance, flexibility, and/or muscle pain outcomes had to
have been conducted. Fifth, there had to have been a control
condition, where athletes were subdivided either as their own
controls or randomly into an intervention and control group.
The first author was responsible for the study selection. After
the selection process, all studies were discussed among three
authors. In case of disagreement about the inclusion of a study,
a voting process was used to determine if a study should
be included or not. Figure 1 provides a flow chart of the
literature search.

FIGURE 1 | Overview of the selection process for the studies included in this meta-analysis. N indicates the number of studies.
Classification and Quality Assessment of
the Studies
The inclusion criteria were met by 21 studies, 14 of which
used pre-rolling as an exercise warm-up routine, while seven
used post-rolling to enhance recovery mechanisms. For further
analysis, the studies were categorized according to the type of
FR device used (i.e., foam roller or roller massager). Several
studies were included more than once in the analysis. This
was the case, for example, when several follow-up examinations
were carried out (e.g., after 24 and 48 h) or several types of
performance indicators were measured. The Cochrane risk of
bias tool (Higgins et al., 2011) was used to assess the quality of
each included study.
Statistical Analysis and Assessment of
Effect Sizes
A standardized form was used to extract all relevant data and
important methodological details from the studies. For each
study, relative changes in performance, flexibility, and muscle
pain were calculated for the treatment condition and the control
condition. By subtracting the two values, the net effect of the
treatment on changes in performance, flexibility, and muscle pain
was calculated. Effect sizes (ES, Hedges’ g values) were estimated
according to the following formula:
g = cP
�
Mpost, foam rolling − Mpre, foam rolling
� �
Mpost, control − Mpre, control
�
SDpre
where cp is a bias factor recommended for small sample sizes
(Morris, 2008), Mpre, foam rolling, Mpost, foam rolling, Mpre, control, and
Mpost, control are the respective mean values of performance,
flexibility, and muscle pain, and SDpre is the pooled pre-
test standard deviation. This method was chosen because it
has been suggested for the ES calculation of controlled pre-
test-post-test study designs in meta-analyses (Higgins et al.,
2011). Negative effects on performance, flexibility, and muscle
pain are marked with a minus sign ES deviations and 95%
confidence intervals were calculated as described by Borenstein
et al. (2011). In addition, the ES was converted to percentiles
as described by Coe (2002). For example, an ES of 0.5
means that the score of the average subject in the FR group
is 0.5 standard deviations above the average subject in the
control group, and hence exceeds the score of 69%. The value
of 69% indicates that the average subject in the FR group
would score higher than 69% of the control group that was
initially equivalent.
If more than one parameter of performance was measured, a
combined effect was calculated by averaging the relative change
and the ES, and calculating the combined ES variance (Borenstein
et al., 2011). In this context, a correlation coefficient of 0.9 was
used based on the values reported in studies by Harbo et al. (2012)
and Nuzzo et al. (2008).
The total results for the analyzed conditions were determined
by
the
calculation
of
inverse-variance-weighted
g-values
(Borenstein et al., 2011). For nine of the twenty-one studies,
more than one result was included in the analysis because
several follow-up examinations were performed (e.g., after
24 and 48 h). In these cases, the respective results were
combined as described above, assuming correlation coefficients
of 0.9. To combine the different types of sprint, jump,

and strength performances, a correlation coefficient of 0.6
was used.
The data of each individual study as well as weighted-
average values are presented in forest plots. The magnitude
of g was categorized according to Cohen (1992) (i.e., 0.00–
0.19 = negligible effect, 0.20–0.49 = small effect, 0.50–
0.79 = moderate effect, ≥0.80 = large effect). The values are given
with 95% confidence intervals to express the uncertainty of the
true effect. ES can be interpreted as evidence of the benefit of
pre-rolling or post-rolling when the average and 95% confidence
intervals are above zero.
RESULTS
Included Studies
Twenty-one studies with a total number of 454 subjects met
the inclusion criteria, fourteen of which used pre-rolling as an
exercise warm-up strategy (n = 306), while seven used post-
rolling to enhance recovery (n = 148). Of the twenty-one studies,
fourteen used foam rollers, while the other seven used roller
massage bars/sticks. The characteristics of the included studies
are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 (studies using pre-
rolling) and Supplementary Table 2 (studies using post-rolling).
The calculated ES for the effects of FR on performance, flexibility,
and muscle pain outcomes are shown in Figures 2–9.
The use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Higgins et al.,
2011) showed a comparable bias level for most of the included
studies. Regarding selection bias, almost all studies mentioned a
random assignment of their subjects into either a FR or control
group. Accordingly, the risk of selection bias was considered low.
However, in the research article by Sullivan et al. (2013), it was
not explicitly stated how the participants were assigned to the
different groups. Here, the selection bias remained unclear. The
blinding of the subjects was not possible due to the nature of
the FR technique. Consequently, the risk of a placebo bias was
comparatively high. Mikesky et al. (2002) imposed blinding on
researchers and participants during testing. Griefahn et al. (2017)
stated that only the examiners were blinded during outcome
assessments, whereas Cheatham et al. (2017) imposed blinding
only on subjects. None of the other research articles provided any
information on blinding. Regarding attrition bias, only one study
reported on drop-outs (n = 2; Bushell et al., 2015).
Furthermore, to minimize possible learning effects, twelve
studies (Mikesky et al., 2002; MacDonald et al., 2013; Healey
et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2015; Pearcey et al., 2015; Zorko
et al., 2016; Cavanaugh et al., 2017; Cheatham et al., 2017;
D’Amico and Gillis, 2017; Grabow et al., 2017; Casanova et al.,
2018; Phillips et al., 2018) provided participants an organized
familiarization with performance tests prior to the first testing
session; in nine studies (MacDonald et al., 2013; Peacock et al.,
2014; Jones et al., 2015; Pearcey et al., 2015; Cheatham et al., 2017;
D’Amico and Gillis, 2017; Grabow et al., 2017; Casanova et al.,
2018; Phillips et al., 2018), the participants were instructed to
avoid strenuous exercise before and/or during the experimental
period; in seven studies (MacDonald et al., 2013; Pearcey et al.,
2015; Cavanaugh et al., 2017; D’Amico and Gillis, 2017; Grabow
et al., 2017; Rey et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2018), diet control
was mentioned and/or the subjects were asked to maintain
their normal dietary intake and to refrain from nutritional
supplements and alcohol intake during the experimental period;
and in six studies (Mikesky et al., 2002; Macdonald et al., 2014;
Zorko et al., 2016; Cavanaugh et al., 2017; Cheatham et al., 2017;
Rey et al., 2017), it was explicitly stated that each participant was
always examined at approximately the same time of day.
Overall, based on the quality assessment of the studies
included in this meta-analysis, none of the studies was considered
to have a high risk of bias, except for the high risk of placebo bias
that can be inevitable for this kind of studies.

the effects of pre-rolling on performance and flexibility, 10
(MacDonald et al., 2013; Healey et al., 2014; Peacock et al.,
2014; Bushell et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2016;
Cheatham et al., 2017; Griefahn et al., 2017; Sagiroglu et al.,
2017; Phillips et al., 2018) used a cylindrical foam roller (overall
performance: +2.7%, g = 0.11; flexibility: +5.0%, g = 0.32),
while the remaining four studies (Mikesky et al., 2002; Sullivan
et al., 2013; Cavanaugh et al., 2017; Grabow et al., 2017) used a
type of roller massage bar/stick (overall performance: +0.4%,
g = 0.21; flexibility: +1.6%, g = 0.39).
Post-rolling
Post-rolling slightly attenuated exercise-induced decreases in
sprint (+3.1%, g = 0.34) and strength performance (+3.9%,
g = 0.21). It also reduced muscle pain perception (+6.0%,
g = 0.47), whereas the effect on jump performance (−0.2%,
g = 0.06) was trivial. The weighted-average overall performance
change in response to post-rolling was +2.0% (g = 0.19). The
effects of post-rolling using a cylindrical foam roller (strength
performance: +5.6%, g = 0.27; muscle pain: +6.0%, g = 0.55)
were examined by four studies (Macdonald et al., 2014; Pearcey
et al., 2015; Zorko et al., 2016; Fleckenstein et al., 2017), while
the remaining three studies (D’Amico and Gillis, 2017; Rey et al.,
2017; Casanova et al., 2018) used a type of roller massage bar/stick
(strength performance: −0.1%, g = −0.01; muscle pain: +5.8%,
g = 0.20).
DISCUSSION
There is a growing body of literature examining the use of FR as a
warm-up activity (i.e., pre-rolling) or as a recovery strategy (i.e.,
post-rolling); however, the effectiveness of FR is still in question
in both scenarios. The variation in methodological design,
combined with the differences in FR intervention, exercise
modality, and training status of the populations investigated, has
perhaps contributed to the apparently inconsistent findings. This
study used a meta-analytical approach to (1). Explore whether the

sprint, jump, and strength performance as well as flexibility and
muscle pain outcomes and (2). To identify whether self-massage
with a foam roller or a roller massager is more effective. The
results indicate that pre-rolling causes a small acute improvement
in sprint performance and flexibility, while its effect on jump and
strength performance was negligible. Second, when foam rolling
is used as a recovery tool, participants experience slightly reduced
decrements in sprint and strength performance and a small
reduction in the severity of muscle pain. Third, a tendency was
found for foam rollers to offer larger recovery effects than roller
massagers, while the differences in the effects between FR devices
in terms of pre-rolling did not seem to be of practical relevance.
Pre-rolling
Relevant effect sizes for average improvements in performance
due to pre-rolling were found only for sprinting. The total
Hedges’ g of 0.28 (Figure 2) indicates that with the use of pre-
rolling, 58% of the population is likely to experience increased
sprint performance (Coe, 2002). However, the average percentage
improvement in sprint performance was only 0.7%. In this
context, Hopkins et al. (1999) defined the smallest worthwhile
performance enhancement (i.e., in the case of the present study,
the minimum improvement making pre-rolling worthwhile) as
the value increasing the chance of victory for an athlete by 10%.
Based on this definition, they concluded that an enhancement as
small as 0.3–0.4 of the within-athlete standard deviation known
as the coefficient of variation (CV) is important for at least the
best athletes. For sprinting, Malcata and Hopkins (2014) as well
as Tanner and Gore (2013) reported CVs of ∼0.8%. The smallest
important change in sprint performance thus corresponds to
∼0.3%. This shows that although the effect size was rather
small from a purely statistical point of view, when within-athlete
variability is taken into account, the average improvement in
sprint performance induced by pre-rolling is within a range that
is relevant for elite athletes.
However, for recreational athletes, a change in sprint
performance as small as ∼0.3% may be barely noticeable due to a
likely greater within-athlete variability. In this case, the minimum
worthwhile enhancement in sprint performance would be greater
than the change in sprint performance induced by pre-rolling.
Consequently, the effects of pre-rolling on sprint performance
seem to be more relevant for elite athletes, while it is possible that
recreationally active individuals may not benefit substantially
from pre-rolling. Furthermore, the small average overall effect
size for sprint performance is based on only four studies and is
mainly due to the studies conducted by Mikesky et al. (2002)

and Peacock et al. (2014) showing effect sizes of 0.66 and
0.70, respectively. Therefore, it can be speculated that sprint
performance does not, per se, benefit more from pre-rolling than
the other performance components and that the slightly larger
effect sizes found for sprinting are, rather, due to methodological
aspects and/or aberrations in the data. Consequently, sprint
performance results should be interpreted with caution, as the
number of available studies was limited and only two of them
showed a clear positive effect.
Several potential physiological effects of FR could explain
the trend of improved sprint performance following pre-rolling.
One possibility is that FR immediately prior to sprinting
breaks up what are known as barrier trigger-points (Bonci and
Oswald, 1993). These are identified as inflexible bands of muscle
containing knots resulting from muscle spasm. Barrier trigger-
points are typically painless and can result in muscle weakness,
muscle fatigue, and muscle stiffness (Mikesky et al., 2002). All
of these factors could obviously have an impact on sprinting.
FR may break up these trigger-points. Decreasing muscle spasms
would not only decrease the amount of internal resistance to
muscle movement, but also enable the previously spasmodic
tissue to contribute to the athletic activity being performed
(Mikesky et al., 2002). However, this explanation remains highly
speculative, and there is no concrete evidence proving that the
release of trigger-points makes FR effective.
Alternative explanations for acute benefits in performance
could be a potential warm-up and/or placebo effect. Self-massage
with a foam roller necessitates supporting one’s partial body
weight with the upper body, similar to with planking exercises.
These exercises primarily involve isometrically holding the body
in a prone position and are typically used to strengthen the core.
Isometric exercises such as planking are in some ways similar
to FR because the body position is maintained in an analogous
manner, requiring similar isometric actions to support one‘s body
weight. Planking in turn would have a warm-up effect through
possible increased skin and muscle temperature, increased blood
flow, and enhanced flexibility/mobility (Healey et al., 2014).
Moreover, the observed effect of FR might have been confounded
by a potential psychosomatic disorder, meaning the subjects may
have performed better following FR treatment simply because
they believed it would improve their performance (Jo et al., 2018).
It should also be noted that sprint performance mainly
depends on muscle strength and neuromuscular coordination.
However, similar to the findings of Cheatham et al. (2015),
the effects of pre-rolling on jump (g = 0.09) and strength
performance (g = 0.12) were negligible (Figures 3, 4). Thus,

it cannot be definitively determined if the observed effects on
sprint performance were really due to FR. For example, it is
possible that the trend toward improved sprint performance was
the result of a placebo effect, as FR can hardly be blinded. The
reason the other measures of physical performance did not show
trends toward improvements is unclear. Mikesky et al. (2002)
suggested that the measures of jump capacity and strength are
rather one-dimensional when compared with the complexity and
coordination required to sprint. As such, large improvements in
more isolated tasks are not as remarkable, while the combined
effects on more complex, repetitive tasks become more evident.
Although it is a coordinated task, jumping is so brief in duration,
at least compared to sprinting, that any combined improvements
are not afforded a chance to be revealed.
The largest average effect of pre-rolling was related to
flexibility. The overall Hedges’ g of 0.34 (Figure 5) indicates that
62% of the population will experience short-term improvements
in flexibility when using pre-rolling as a pre-exercise warm-up
(Coe, 2002). Cheatham et al. (2015) assumed that the effects of FR
on flexibility would be attributed to the altered viscoelastic and
thixotropic properties of the fascia (i.e., remobilizing the fascia
back to a gel-like state), as well as increases in intramuscular
temperature and blood flow due to the friction created by
the foam roller and the mechanical breakdown of scar tissue.
However, this is merely speculation by the authors and is not
based on direct scientific observations. In addition, hypotheses
related to the mechanisms of pressure-associated changes in
myofascial properties have been questioned. The pressure that is
required to deform firm fascial tissue is greater than the physical
range that is usually achieved by FR (Schleip, 2003). Therefore, a
change in the thixotropic property of the fascia surrounding the
muscle may be more likely (Phillips et al., 2018). This change is
possible because the fascia is composed of colloidal substances
that can become more gelatinous when they encounter heat and
mechanical stress (de Souza et al., 2019). However, in colloidal
substances, the thixotropic effect only lasts as long as the pressure
or heat is applied, and within minutes, the substance returns to
its original gel state (Schleip, 2003). Therefore, it is unlikely that
FR would have a sustained effect on flexibility by changing the
thixotropic property of the fascia.
Apart from this, FR may increase flexibility due to a process
known as autogenic inhibition. As the FR device applies pressure
to the muscle tissue, it is believed that mechanoreceptors called
Golgi tendon organs (GTO) send a message to the central
nervous system that substantial tension is being placed on the
muscle, causing the central nervous system to relax that muscle to

prevent it from tearing (Larson, 2014). However, Edin and Vallbo
(1990) found that GTOs were insensitive to the tension produced
on the tendon through stretching. If stretch-induced GTO
inhibition exists, it is more likely to occur with large-amplitude
stretches and not from the small tensile forces that are exerted
during FR. Furthermore, any possible GTO inhibition subsides
almost immediately after the cessation of tension in the tendon
(Behm, 2018). Therefore, it seems unlikely that this mechanism
would contribute to increased flexibility following FR. The most
plausible explanation for short-term improvements in flexibility
could be the effect of FR on the central pain-modulatory systems.
For example, constant and vigorous pressure exerted on the
soft tissues may overload the skin receptors, thus inhibiting
or minimizing pain sensation and increasing stretch tolerance
(Kelly and Beardsley, 2016; de Souza et al., 2019). This hypothesis
is supported by the findings of Aboodarda et al. (2015) and
Cavanaugh et al. (2017) who have shown that FR can improve
pain perception.
Apart from the study by Sagiroglu et al. (2017), which has
shown that pre-rolling has a harmful effect on jump performance,
the research suggests that pre-rolling may offer small short-
term benefits in promoting flexibility without negatively affecting
muscle performance. This is an important finding to consider
when putting together a menu of warm-up activities, since
training and competition preparation should always aim to
enhance performance. Nevertheless, additional research is
necessary to identify different FR protocols that are relevant to
different sports and to develop guidelines that ensure FR routines
do not impair performance. For example, despite causing an
acute increase in range of motion in the joints, prolonged static
stretching of more than 60 s per muscle is likely to result in
significant performance impairment (Kay and Blazevich, 2012;
Behm et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2018). Therefore, one might assume
that prolonged static stretching is not recommended during
pre-event warm-up activities, especially when performance is
required immediately after stretching. However, in studies that
conducted performance tests >10 min after static stretching,
performance changes were typically statistically trivial unless
extreme stretch protocols were used (Behm et al., 2015).
Moreover, Blazevich et al. (2018) and Reid et al. (2018)
reported that potential performance decrements caused by static
stretching are insignificant with shorter stretching durations
(i.e., <60 s) and appear to be resolved after a complete,
progressive pre-exercise warm-up routine. Therefore, strong
evidence supports the deleterious effects of static stretching prior
to performance (Behm and Chaouachi, 2011), but when used

properly, static stretching can promote flexibility and injury
prevention without negatively affecting muscle performance
(Behm et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2018).
Post-rolling
The current review demonstrates that post-rolling recovers
exercise-induced decreases in sprint and strength performance
more quickly than passive recovery. The overall Hedges’ g of
0.34 and 0.21 for sprint and strength (Figures 6, 8) indicate that
62 and 58%, respectively, of the population will experience the
accelerated recovery of sprint and strength performance when
using post-rolling (Coe, 2002). The average sprint and strength
performance improvements were 3.1 and 3.9%, respectively,
reflecting a range that is clearly higher than the smallest
worthwhile change defined by Hopkins et al. (1999).
Prolonged impairments in muscular function have been
attributed to a multifaceted process from central factors involving
the central nervous system and nervous pathways to peripheral
factors occurring within the muscle itself. However, it is assumed
that subsequent fatigue after intensive exercise would account
for about 80% of the impairments originating from a peripheral
factor (Wiewelhove et al., 2017). Peripheral fatigue includes
physical signs, such as the ultrastructural damage of connective
tissue and muscle tissue, as well as an increase in muscle soreness.
Nevertheless, previous research has indicated that ultrastructural
damage does not always occur following intensive exercise that
leads to muscle soreness (Yu et al., 2002). Therefore, it seems
reasonable that reduced voluntary muscle activation (e.g., central
fatigue due to inhibition caused by muscle soreness, swelling, and
stiffness) also contributes to a reduction in muscular function
(Byrne et al., 2004). Considering this, the recovery of dynamic
performance measures with the use of post-rolling is due to either
the facilitated process of soft-tissue restoration, the accelerated
restoration of central factors, or both.
Although Pearcey et al. (2015) did not directly investigate
the physiological mechanisms of FR, they speculated that
post-rolling might enhance post-exercise recovery of dynamic
performance measures via systemic biomechanical effects. These
include: increased levels of circulating neutrophil; smaller
increases in post-exercise plasma creatine kinase; activated
mechano-sensory sensors that signal transcription of COX7B
and ND1, indicating that new mitochondria are being formed,
which presumably accelerate the healing of the muscle; and less
active heat-shock proteins and immune cytokines, thus reflecting
less cellular stress and inflammation. Furthermore, the reduced
perception of pain may positively affect the short-term recovery

process of muscular function (Zorko et al., 2016), and improved
perception of muscle soreness may be critical for the restoration
of exercise performance, since muscular function is impaired in
the presence of muscle pain (Graven-Nielsen et al., 2002). These
mechanisms will be described in more detail below.
However, the effects of post-rolling on performance should
again be interpreted with caution, as the overall effects on
sprint (p = 0.12) and strength performance (p = 0.28) were
not significant and the number of available studies was limited.
Merely one study found a clear benefit of post-rolling for
sprint performance (D’Amico and Gillis, 2017), while only two
studies showed post-rolling had a clear positive effect on strength
performance (Zorko et al., 2016; Fleckenstein et al., 2017).
In addition, the effects of post-rolling on jump capacity were
negligible (Figure 7), although research has demonstrated a clear
relationship between sprint, jump, and strength performance in
athletes (Comfort et al., 2014). Therefore, it remains questionable
whether the average post-rolling-induced enhancements of
performance recovery were really due to a true physiological
effect of FR or whether the placebo effect or methodological
aspects contaminated these results.
The largest average effects of FR in general and post-rolling
in particular were found for the alleviation of perceived
muscle pain. The total Hedges’ g of 0.47 (Figure 9) indicates
that with the use of post-rolling, 66% of the population
is likely to experience reduced muscle pain (Coe, 2002).

Effects of Foam Rolling

while

damage, creates an increase in tissue osmotic pressure that
sensitizes the nociceptors, also resulting in the sensation of pain
(Hill et al., 2014; Macdonald et al., 2014).
In this regard, FR-like treatments in animal models have
been shown to induce an anti-nociceptive response by mediating
an endogenous release of oxytocin into the plasma and in
the central grey matter located around the cerebral aqueduct
in the midbrain (Agren et al., 1995; Lund et al., 2002; Jay
et al., 2014). Thus, one plausible mechanism to explain the
reduction in muscle soreness following FR is the activation of
descending inhibitory pathways, using the central gray matter-
opioid system and oxytocin (Jay et al., 2014). Moreover, it
has been proposed that FR-like mechanical stress may remove
trigger points from the muscle tissue, leading to improved pain
perception. Myofascial trigger points are a common source of
musculoskeletal pain. It is thought that application of massage-
like mechanical pressure on trigger points can prevent the
unnecessary firing of muscle spindles afferent discharges from the
trigger point, can reduce trigger point-induced muscle spasms,
and ultimately decrease pain (Aboodarda et al., 2015). However,
this explanation remains highly speculative because there is no
concrete evidence for the effectiveness of brief rolling massages
for trigger point therapy.
As proposed by Aboodarda et al. (2015) and Cavanaugh
et al. (2017), the most plausible explanation for the mediation
of perceived muscle pain following FR could be the effect
of rolling massages on the central pain-modulatory systems.
Their findings suggest that FR performed on muscles that
contain a hypersensitive tender spot and FR performed on
the contralateral muscle group can both provide an acute
increase in the pain threshold. Since the increase in the pain
threshold has a transient and non-localized effect, they suggest
that massage-like mechanical pressure can provide analgesic
effects through the ascending pain inhibitory system (gate
theory of pain) and the descending anti-nociceptive pathway
(diffuse noxious inhibitory control), respectively. Although the
physiological mechanisms underlying the analgesic effect of
FR have yet to be demonstrated empirically, a reduction
in the sensation of muscle soreness is beneficial to athletes
and may improve their readiness to participate in physical
activity (Hill et al., 2014).

Effects of Foam Rolling
FIGURE 9 | Forest plot summarizing the effects of post-rolling on muscle pain. For each study, the timing of the post-test is included in parentheses. The studies are

Foam Rollers vs. Roller Massagers
Although pre-rolling effects were greater with the use of roller
massagers, larger average percentage changes were seen with
the use of foam rollers. Due to this contradictory finding, it is
difficult to conclude whether pre-rolling with foam rollers or
with roller massagers is superior. On the other hand, post-rolling
showed both larger effects and greater percentage changes when
it was administered with foam rollers, while the benefits of pre-
rolling with roller massagers were less significant. Consequently,
post-rolling seems to be more effective if foam rollers are
used. However, as the number of high-quality and well-designed
studies on FR is limited, the conclusions drawn above should be
treated cautiously. Further studies would be necessary to confirm
that different FR devices lead to different effects.
Limitations
The results from the present meta-analysis provide evidence
that the effects of FR on performance and recovery are rather
minor and partly negligible, but can be relevant in some cases
(e.g., to increase flexibility or to reduce muscle pain sensation).
However, any meta-analysis is limited by the data available and
there are several limitations for this analysis. First, most of the
included studies contain small sample sizes, which result in
reduced statistical power. Second, none of the included studies
were able to blind their patients to the treatment due to the
nature of the FR technique. As such, the placebo effect cannot
be eliminated. Third, the methodology varied widely between
the studies. For example, the majority of the published studies
have not standardized and/or measured the applied pressure
of the rolling action, while only a few studies have used a
kind of pressure roller apparatus to maintain a constant rolling
intensity. Consequently, there may be large ranges in the pressure
exerted through FR. Furthermore, the FR procedures differed
in terms of the duration of the application, the FR device
used, and the muscles targeted. Fourth, with respect to the
subjects’ training status, the studies recruited both elite athletes
and recreationally active or untrained individuals. Overall, these
differences may explain some of the inconsistent findings within
the current literature and future research should account for this
inconsistency by at least directly measuring as well as reporting
and standardizing the degree of pressure induced through FR.
Finally, the statistical analysis is based only on articles that were
published before January 2018. However, the vast majority of
articles published since January 2018 confirm the pooled effects
of FR, which are calculated in this meta-analysis. For example,

Chadwick Smith (2018), Killen et al. (2018), Macgregor et al.
(2018), Madoni et al. (2018), Monteiro et al. (2018, 2019a,b),
and Smith et al. (2018, 2019) were able to confirm that FR can
improve flexibility, perceived muscle pain perception, and/or the
recovery of strength performance, while Madoni et al. (2018)
found that FR had no effect on jump performance.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this meta-analysis illustrates that pre-rolling seems
to be an effective strategy for short-term improvements in
flexibility without decreasing muscle performance. The review
has also shown that the improvement of sprint performance to
be expected from the use of pre-rolling, as well as the recovery
rate of the performance measures of speed and strength with
post-rolling, are significant enough to be relevant for at least
elite athletes. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain
elusive and the effects are in part contradictory. While the
effects of FR on muscle function were less clear, the positive
effects of alleviating muscle soreness with a larger body of
evidence endorse the utilization of post-rolling. As psychological
aspects play an important role in most sports, the fact that an
athlete feels less pain after pre-rolling might be sufficient to
justify its use despite the absence of measurable physiological
benefits (Poppendieck et al., 2016). In addition, the almost
complete absence of side effects might favor recovery-supporting
FR intervention.
However, since the physiological mechanisms of the potential
benefits of FR are not fully understood, care should be taken
by athletes and coaches, particularly when considering that
potential harmful side effects are also suggested when FR is
applied (Freiwald et al., 2016). Further, it must be noted that
in the available studies, different FR intervention protocols
(e.g., different FR devices) were combined with different
types of fatigue-inducing exercises and outcome measures,
making it difficult to compare the results. In addition, there
are not enough high-quality and well-designed studies on
FR to draw any definite conclusions. Finally, due to the
heterogeneity of the methodological designs among the included
studies, there is no consensus on the optimal FR intervention
(i.e., in terms of treatment time, pressure, and cadence,
etc.). The existing literature thus provides some evidence to
support the utilization of FR interventions in sports practice.
However, the limited evidence should be considered prior
to integrating foam rolling as a warm-up activity and/or a
recovery tool.
