Abstract
Gut bacteria strongly influence our metabolic, endocrine, immune, and both peripheral and central nervous systems.
Microbiota do this directly and indirectly through their components, shed and secreted, ranging from fermented and digested
dietary and host products to functionally active neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, and g-aminobutyric acid.
Depression has been associated with enhanced levels of proinflammatory biomarkers and abnormal responses to stress.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be marked in addition by low cortisol responses, and these factors seem to
predict and predispose individuals to develop PTSD after a traumatic event. Dysregulation of the immune system and of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis observed in PTSD may reflect prior trauma exposure, especially early in life. Early life,
including the prenatal period, is a critical time in rodents, and may well be for humans, for the functional and structural
development of the immune and nervous systems. These, in turn, are likely shaped and programmed by gut and possibly
other bacteria. Recent experimental and clinical data converge on the hypothesis that imbalanced gut microbiota in early life may
have long-lasting immune and other physiologic effects that make individuals more susceptible to develop PTSD after a traumatic
event and contribute to the disorder. This suggests that it may be possible to target abnormalities in these systems by
manipulation of certain gut bacterial communities directly through supplementation or indirectly by dietary and other novel
approaches.

Highlights
�
Enhanced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and
low cortisol predispose individuals to develop post-
traumatic stress disorder after a traumatic event.
Childhood trauma contributes to a proinflammatory
state and low cortisol in adulthood.
�
Stress is a major factor known to alter the gut micro-
biota and the gut barrier function.
�
Early life is a vulnerable period during which the gut
microbiome shapes the host immune homeostasis and
the nervous system.
�
Stress-induced alteration of the gut microbiota early
in life may elicit long-lasting immune consequences
and increase the risk of developing stress-related dis-
orders later in life. This article offers novel therapeu-
tic approaches via manipulation of the microbiota to
improve symptomatology.
In this article, we review recent experimental and clinical
evidence that highlights the possible major roles of the
immune system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
and the overlooked role of the gut microbiota in the devel-
opment of psychiatric disorders, with special emphasis on
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It has been suggested
that the earliest contact with pioneer bacteria probably deter-
mine, shape, and even program metabolic, endocrine,
immune, and nervous functions.1-7 These crucial interactions
are likely to be bidirectional with major consequences for
short- and long-term health.
While this review focuses on mostly afferent (gut to
brain) potential beneficial effects of gut microbiota, it is
important to emphasize that brain-gut microbiota pathways
may also have significant physiologic and even deleterious
effects on health. Lyte et al8 emphasized that stress may
change the gut microbiome and even promote the activation
of virulence genes in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas.
Another aspect of brain-gut pathways not covered here but
that may have relevance to the subject is the controversial
topic of the efferent cholinergic anti-inflammatory
response.9,10 On both topics, the reader is referred elsewhere
for further coverage.
The technical advances afforded by molecular biology
have uncovered the staggering complexity of the commu-
nities of microorganisms that share our bodies. Trillions of
bacteria are ever present in our guts, and although we can
identify them by their molecular signatures, only a fraction
(<30%) has been cultured to date, rendering cause-and-effect
relationships to disordered health lacking in evidence and
unconvincing. Nevertheless, the body of evidence that is
emerging in work with rodents, and beginning to emerge
clinically, is hard to ignore.
It is clear that massive, terrifying, and/or chronic trauma
may be associated with subsequent development of PTSD
and that such individuals have higher risk of developing
another mental health problem including depression, anxi-
ety, alcohol and/or drug abuse, and suicidal thoughts. How-
ever, only a certain percentage of people so exposed present
subsequent signs of psychopathology. The factors that
underlie susceptibility or resilience to stress are still not
clear, but biological markers of these traits are beginning
to be elucidated.
Specific Brain Biomarkers Associated with
Susceptibility to Stress
Using the ‘‘social defeat’’ paradigm, a model of PTSD and
depression, genetically identical mice can be split into 2
groups according to their biological and behavioural
responses to chronic stress.11 ‘‘Susceptible’’ mice showed
symptoms typically associated with PTSD such as social
avoidance, depression-like behaviour (e.g., anhedonia,
weight loss), and increase in addictive drug reward. The
‘‘resilient’’ mice were resistant to these behavioural changes.
Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels
(a key regulator of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway) and
signalling in the nucleus accumbens induced the susceptibil-
ity to social defeat stress. Moreover, a postmortem brain
analysis in depressed patients revealed that the protein
expression of BDNF was increased in the nucleus accum-
bens compared with nondepressed subjects.11
Another recent study highlighted the potential role of
the g-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B(1) receptor in mediat-
ing social avoidance and depressive-like behaviour fol-
lowing social defeat.12 Mice lacking GABAB(1a) receptors
were susceptible whereas mice lacking GABAB(1b) receptor
were resilient to chronic stress-induced behavioural
abnormalities.
These studies therefore suggest that the effects of
chronic stress are associated with changes in the expression
of genes involved in certain neurotrophic activity and
neurotransmission.

 Dysregulation of the Immune System and
HPA Axis Are Involved in the
Psychopathology of Stress-Related
Disorders
Numerous clinical studies have found positive correlations
between the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, particu-
larly interleukin (IL)–6, tumor necrosis factor–a, and the
acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) and depres-
sion.13-15 Although such correlations do not imply a cause-
effect relationship, several recent experimental and clinical
studies have highlighted the predictive value of inflamma-
tion in the development of psychological symptoms, sug-
gesting that the proinflammatory immune response
precedes the onset of depression.
Using the social defeat paradigm, Hodes et al16 showed
that, compared with resilient mice, susceptible mice that
later developed a depressive-like phenotype had increased
leucocyte counts before stress exposure. Furthermore, these
immune cells released higher amounts of IL-6 in response to
acute stress or when stimulated ex vivo with lipopolysac-
charide (LPS), suggesting that dysregulated immune phy-
siology and higher IL-6 levels are risk factors for stress
susceptibility. These results are in line with those found in
a prospective clinical study performed in more than 1800
war zone–deployed Marines and Navy combatants.17 Plasma
CRP levels before deployment were significantly associated
with postdeployment PTSD symptom emergence, suggest-
ing that levels may be prospectively associated with resili-
ence versus risk for PTSD. Indeed, data obtained in Bosnian
war PTSD sufferers identified higher IL-6 levels released by
LPS-stimulated blood cells compared with control subjects.18
Social and psychological stresses activate the HPA axis,
which results in increased corticotropin-releasing hormone
(CRH) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. PTSD is hypothe-
sized to reflect a sustained stress response. However,
although patients have high levels of CRH, they have unex-
pectedly low levels of cortisol compared with healthy sub-
jects, suggesting dysregulation of the negative feedback
system of the HPA axis.19 Disruption of the HPA axis
appears to be sustained as low cortisol levels persist decades
after the initiating traumatic event.19 Ehring and McFarlane
have shown that an initially low cortisol concentration
immediately after the trauma predicts subsequent PTSD
diagnosis,20,21 and prior trauma is a well-described risk fac-
tor that predisposes for later PTSD development. Emerging
research findings also indicate that low cortisol levels shortly
after the traumatic event may reflect a previous earlier
trauma and increase the risk of developing PTSD later in
life.22 A recent meta-analysis has confirmed that child-
hood trauma contributes to a proinflammatory state in
adulthood.23
Although the mechanisms of action are unclear,
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be
effective in reducing depression for treatment-resistant
patients.24 Ke
´ri et al25 showed that CBT reduced the initially
elevated expression of TLR4 and NFkB in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of depressed patients. Greater reduction
of proinflammatory markers during CBT was associated
with a more pronounced clinical improvement.
Although it is established that inflammation is associated
with depression26-28 and, more recently, with stress-related
disorders, the origin of inflammation in patients with psy-
chiatric disorders remains poorly determined. One factor
could be disordered gut barrier function since its impairment
may allow translocation to the internal milieu29 of bacteria
and their components such as LPS and peptidoglycans,
which induce the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.
Furthermore, a focus on the gut is even more appropriate
since specific families of gut bacteria and their products are
largely responsible for the generation and maintenance of
counterinflammatory cellular systems.30,31 Stress is also a
major factor known to increase the permeability of the gut
barrier,32,33 and depression as well as alcohol dependence
are psychiatric conditions associated with a ‘‘leaky gut.’’34,35
Thus, a major candidate source of systemic inflammation in
stress and (or) depression could well be the result of disor-
dered gut barrier function.
Not surprisingly, in view of the correlation of inflamma-
tory changes, impaired gut barrier function, and depression,
there have been attempts to determine if anti-inflammatory
treatment might be therapeutic. A double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial showed that addition of a
COX-2 inhibitor to standard antidepressant therapy induced
a greater improvement of depressive symptoms than antide-
pressant alone.36 However, the trial consisted of a small
number of patients and has yet to be replicated in a large
cohort. Regarding the effects of antidepressants on systemic
inflammation, the results are highly controversial: studies
have demonstrated that antidepressants can both decrease
or increase inflammatory cytokines.37 Another important
and neglected area for investigation is the possibility that
many of the drugs that seem to be psychoeffective might
be having their effects though action on the gut microbiome.38
Since recovery from depression is associated, in some but
not all studies, with reduced and normalized biomarkers of
inflammation,39 greater attention to restoration of impaired
barrier gut function in psychiatric diseases in general is
warranted.
The Gut Microbiota: A Novel Actor
Mediating Behavioural Changes
Numerous experiments in the past few years, especially
those using germ-free (GF) mice have confirmed the gut
microbiome as a major new player in the development, struc-
ture, and function of both the enteric and central nervous
systems40,41 as well as the maintenance and integrity of the
blood-brain barrier.42 Recently, experimental and clinical
data have suggested the important role of intestinal bacteria
in mediating changes in brain function and behaviour such as
depression, anxiety, and cognition.1 For instance, GF mice
206
The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 61(4)
 exhibit reduced anxiety-like behaviour40,43 and impaired
working memory44 compared with normal conventionally
raised mice. Bercik et al,45 in a landmark study, showed that
the behavioural traits of a more anxiety-like phenotype could
be effectively adoptively transferred to mice that exhibited a
less anxious phenotype by colonization with their donor gut
bacteria. Behaviour was therefore correlated with a specific
gut microbial community. Other studies have shown that the
administration to mice of specific strains of beneficial bac-
teria such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Bifidobacterium
longum can ameliorate anxiety- and depressive-like beha-
viours.46,47 Changes in behaviour induced by modification
of the gut microbiota were accompanied by changes in
brain neurochemistry including changes in BDNF and
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expression.43,45 However,
how gut bacteria can communicate with the brain to affect
the behaviour is highly complex and involves several meta-
bolic, neural, and immune pathways that are summarized
hereafter.
Intestinal microbiota have a huge metabolic activity.
Colonic bacteria ferment and digest host-derived and dietary
components such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids and
convert them into various metabolites that can be either
beneficial or harmful for health.48 For instance, fermentation
of carbohydrates leads to production of short-chain fatty
acids, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which can
have beneficial impact for health. They provide energy
for colonocytes, improve ion absorption, have anti-
inflammatory properties, and regulate serotonin production
and enterochromaffin cell numbers.49-51 Furthermore buty-
rate, an effective histone deacetylase inhibitor, had greater
antidepressant-like effects than fluoxetine in a mouse
model.52 Conversely, digestion of proteins results in the pro-
duction of potentially toxic metabolites such as phenolic and
sulphur-containing compounds.53 Intestinal epithelial cells
exposed to phenol show, in a dose-dependent manner, an
increase in paracellular permeability due to delocalization
of the intercellular tight junctions.54,55
Also, molecules with neuroactive properties, such as
GABA, serotonin, and dopamine, can also be produced by
commensal bacteria.56 These secreted neurotransmitters,
which are not transported across the blood-brain barrier,
may stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to release mole-
cules that in turn modulate neural signalling to influence
brain functions and behaviour.1 In addition to the products
secreted by the bacteria, it has been shown that membrane
components of bacteria such as capsular polysaccharide A
from Bacteroides fragilis as well as membrane vesicles
budded from the cell surface of B. fragilis or L. rhamno-
sus JB-1 can have profound anti-inflammatory and
neuronal affects that recapitulate effects of parent
bacteria.57,58
The tryptophan/kynurenine pathway could also be
involved in gut-brain interactions. The essential amino acid
tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin, and serum levels
depend on the presence or absence of gut bacteria.59
Tryptophan is also converted into kynurenine, a very potent
immunoregulatory component, by indoleamine dioxygenase
and subsequently into other metabolites, such as kynurenic
acid and quinolinic acid, each of which has potent neurotoxic
or neuroprotective properties. To complicate matters even
more, the production of systemic serotonin is dependent on
the presence of gut bacteria,51 and consumption of a probio-
tic (Bifidobacterium infantis) altered the tryptophan/kynur-
enine pathway and was associated with antidepressant
effects in a rodent study.60
Another important mediator in the gut-brain communica-
tion is the vagus nerve, as shown in vagotomy mouse model
studies,46,47 in which its section interrupts the behavioural
effects of certain orally administered probiotics. The vagus
is the major nerve of the parasympathetic system, which
conveys information from internal organs to the brain. How
intestinal bacteria activate the vagal afferents has been
poorly studied, but good evidence exists that this activation
is not direct but occurs through intrinsic primary afferent
neurons (IPANs) located within the gut wall.61 IPANs are
thought to be the first responders to luminal stimuli such as
bacteria, their metabolites, or neuroactive substances
released by intestinal epithelial cells, and then to relay the
signal to the vagus. Indeed, commensal bacteria produce
metabolites that signal to the colonic enterochromaffin cells,
which in turn produce serotonin basolaterally that then sti-
mulates the enteric nervous system.51 The important role of
the vagus is emphasized by the fact that electrical vagal
stimulation has been authorized by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of drug-resistant depression
and intractable epilepsy.62-64
Finally, the HPA axis has also been demonstrated to be
part of the gut-brain axis. Sudo et al65 have shown that
exposure to stress induced an exaggerated activation of the
HPA axis in GF mice, which was fully reversed by recon-
stitution with the probiotic B. infantis early in life.
An important clinical study investigated the gut micro-
biome in a well-characterized group of alcohol-dependent
subjects admitted to hospital for withdrawal treatment.66 A
major subgroup presented with increased intestinal perme-
ability and strong alterations of specific gut microbiota com-
position, whereas the remainder showed gut permeability
and microbiota similar to those of healthy controls. The
dysbiosis was characterized by decreased levels in the anti-
inflammatory bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and
Bifidobacterium, higher plasma levels of the leukocyte che-
motactic factor IL-8, and increased scores of depression,
anxiety, and alcohol craving. This study also suggested that
specific metabolites produced by the bacteria, such as phenol
and indole compounds, could affect the intestinal barrier
integrity.
Others have reported alteration of gut microbiota in
patients with major depressive disorders including increased
levels of Alistipes and Oscillibacter,67,68 reduced levels of
Faecalibacterium,67 as well as increased fecal levels in a
bacterial product, isovaleric acid.69 Taken together, these
La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie 61(4)
207
 recent clinical data suggest that the anxious and depressive
symptomatology, commonly found in PTSD patients, may
well be associated with alterations of the gut microbiota
composition and functionality. The data further open the
possibility that through dietary and (or) beneficial bacteria
supplementation, it may eventually be possible to affect dis-
ordered behaviours.
Although stress is known to induce gut barrier altera-
tions,32 the effect of social stress on gut microbiota remains
largely unknown. One study showed that mice exposed to a
social stressor exhibited decreased bacterial diversity and
richness associated with increased levels of circulating
proinflammatory cytokines.70 It remains to be determined
if in the social defeat paradigm stress resilience and suscept-
ibility are associated with different patterns of gut micro-
biota. Correspondingly, whether there is an association
between gut microbiota composition and severity of symp-
toms in PTSD sufferers deserves to be explored.
In conclusion, the balance of communities of commensal
bacteria seems to play an important role in the regulation of
the gut barrier function as well as the immune and nervous
systems, which in turn can affect brain function and
behaviour.
Lasting Consequences of Early-Life Stress
The acquisition of microbes occurs at birth, although even
this dogma has been recently questioned since the intrauter-
ine environment may not be sterile.71-73 Indeed, orally admi-
nistrated Enterococcus fecium to pregnant mice were
detected in the amniotic fluid and meconium of pups imme-
diately after birth by caesarean delivery.73 Aagaard et al74
showed that the human placenta harbors a nonpathogenic
and metabolically rich microbiome. How and if the gut
microbes routinely access the foetus remains unknown,
although bacterial translocation from the maternal gut to
bloodstream and thence to the amniotic fluid, which is con-
stantly swallowed by the foetus, is one possible explanation.75
Many rodent physiologic systems are programmed by the
time of weaning (i.e., the same time that their increased gut
permeability is restored to normal adult function). The adult
microbiome gut profile is also thought to be achieved at
weaning, and attempts to change this with antibiotics only
result in a tendency to revert to the characteristic profile
normally seen in adults.76,77 Although it has not been estab-
lished that an equivalent to weaning in rodents occurs at all
in humans, it is generally accepted that the human gut
achieves an adult and characteristic individual profile after
about 1 to 3 years of life.78-80 Ba
¨ckhed et al81 showed that
cessation of breast-feeding is required for maturation into
adult-like microbiome.
Experimentally, stress in early life is associated with
alterations of the bacterial colonization of the gut in
infants82,83 and induces long-term effects in adulthood both
immunologically and from the point of view of abnormal
behaviour.2,84 Maternal separation of pups during the
neonatal period is used in rodents to mimic early-life stress
and is associated with enhanced activity of the HPA axis85 as
well as increased colonic permeability in pups due to ele-
vated CRH. Barreau et al86 showed that rats submitted to
maternal separation exhibited long-term alteration of gut
physiology in adulthood: increased colonic permeability,
bacterial translocation, and intestinal inflammation. Also,
Sudo et al65 were the first to show that colonizing GF mice
early in life with a single bacterial species (B. infantis) was
effective in normalizing the HPA axis response to stress in
adulthood.
Bacterial colonization of GF mice early in life promoted
normalized behaviour, whereas colonization in adult GF
mice failed to do this.40,87 Examination of the contribution
of microbiota in early life to the development of social beha-
viour in GF mice revealed increased social avoidance and
reduced preference for social novelty in adulthood.88 Post-
weaning bacterial colonization normalized the social avoid-
ance but failed to reverse the reduced novel social
interactions, suggesting that in rodents, only certain beha-
viours are programmed early in life through microbial
colonization.
The extent, if any, to which early life represents a critical
window in humans is not known and is viewed with scepti-
cism, but the timing of an insult must be taken into account
when analyzing its potential for long-term effects. As men-
tioned in the previous section, the positive relationship
between inflammatory markers and depressive symptoms
has been found in numerous studies, which were mostly
performed in high-income and industrialized countries.
Compared with North American populations, the plasma
levels of CRP and IL-6 are exceptionally low in young adults
living in low-income countries, despite higher burdens of
infectious diseases.89 This cannot be explained by lower
levels of obesity/overweight or by genetic differences.
Rather, converging lines of evidence point to the potential
importance of early-life environmental factors in shaping the
inflammatory phenotype. The microbiota hypothesis indeed
suggests that the higher microbial exposure in infancy may
explain the lower level of proinflammatory markers and the
subsequent absence of correlation between inflammation
and depression in adulthood among low-income nations.90,91
On the other hand, diminished exposure to microbes in the
perinatal period (as in Western societies) may affect the gut
microbiota, enhance the inflammatory response, and
increase the risk of developing psychiatric conditions later
in life when stress occurs.91 Also, epidemiologic studies
reveal that stressful events in childhood can undoubtedly
influence the subsequent onset of psychiatric disorders such
as depression and anxiety.92-94 The underlying mechanisms
are still unclear, but studies reported that early-life stress
leads to a proinflammatory phenotype as well as alteration
of hippocampal neurogenesis that could have long-lasting
negative effects.95,96
Further studies addressing more physiologically relevant
alterations in the early-life gut microbiota such as
208
The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 61(4)
 psychological stress70,82,97 or the use of antibiotics are
required. Regarding stress, only one human study98 reported
that maternal stress during pregnancy was associated with a
disturbed pattern of infant gut microbiota demonstrating
decreased levels of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus
and Bifidobacterium and increased levels of potential patho-
gens Escherichia and Enterobacter. This aberrant coloniza-
tion pattern was related to more gastrointestinal symptoms
and allergy in infants. The assessment of the psychological
symptoms of these infants later in life would be interesting to
make a clinical link between early-life stress and long-term
behaviour. Furthermore, associations have now been
recorded between the use of antibiotics in early life and the
occurrence of diseases in adulthood—mainly allergic
asthma99,100 and obesity.101,102 There is strong evidence that
immune and metabolic alterations associated with early-life
antibiotic treatment in mice could be driven by alterations of
the gut microbiota.103,104 Overall, these recent data also sug-
gest that early life represents a critical window during which
alteration of the gut microbiota may have long-lasting con-
sequences in term of immune, metabolic, and behavioural
responses. More data in clinically relevant animal models
and human psychiatric conditions are urgently needed.
New Targets in the Treatment of PTSD
Finally, we think that targeting the gut microbiota, the poten-
tial key modulator of the immune and nervous systems,
could lead to a greater improvement in the emotional symp-
toms of patients suffering from depression or anxiety. The
composition and the function of the bacterial community
inhabiting the gut can be improved through dietary interven-
tions or the use of beneficial bacteria such as probiotics. In
this respect, clinical trials have largely been inadequate in
design or in numbers of subjects involved. However, those
that have been conducted have shown that the administration
of different species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
were associated with an improvement in mood,105 a decrease
in anxiety,106 and a decrease in psychological distress,107
particularly in subjects with low cortisol levels.108 Also,
administration of fermented milk products containing pro-
biotics was shown to affect the activity of brain regions that
control central processing of emotions in women.109 How-
ever, all of these studies have been performed in healthy
volunteers. There is an urgent need for well-designed,
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials aimed at
determining the effect of bacterial supplements and con-
trolled changes in diet on psychological symptoms and cog-
nitive functions in patients with well-documented mental
health problems. This particularly applies to PTSD patients
characterized by long-lasting low cortisol levels.
Conclusion
Accumulating data suggest that enhanced peripheral levels
of proinflammatory cytokines and low cortisol predispose
individuals
to
develop
PTSD
after
a
traumatic
event.16,17,20,21 Childhood trauma contributes to a proinflam-
matory state and low cortisol in adulthood.23
There is now evidence, at least in rodents, of the existence
of a vulnerable window in early life during which the gut
microbiome shapes the host immune homeostasis, particu-
larly gut immunity110,111 as well as the nervous system.2 The
concept of ‘‘early life’’ is not clearly defined in the literature.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the intrauterine envi-
ronment is not sterile,73 as originally thought. Therefore, the
prenatal period may also be part of this critical window, as
the development of immune and nervous systems may be
influenced by microbial exposure or metabolites originating
from the maternal microbiota. Therefore, results obtained
from GF studies have to be very cautiously transposed to
human health and disease.
The microbiota hypothesis91 postulates that colonization
with a ‘‘healthy’’ diverse microbiota community during this
specific vulnerable period may decrease susceptibility to
diseases later in life, whereas dysbiosis induced by antibiotic
treatment or stress in childhood may increase the risk of
developing immune, metabolic, and behavioural disorders.
The effectiveness of current antidepressant drug therapies
in treating PTSD is limited, and it is interesting that CBT
alone may reduce a proinflammatory profile, especially an
inflammatory profile linked to leaky gut.25 To our knowl-
edge, the role of the gut microbiota in the development of
PTSD has never been investigated. Studies should aim at
determining whether childhood trauma is associated with
alterations of the gut microbiota and whether dysbiosis early
in life could promote the development of PTSD later in life
when subjects are reexposed to traumatic events. This would
consider the gut microbiota as a new biological factor med-
iating vulnerability versus resilience to stress and may sug-
gest new targets in the treatment of PTSD.
