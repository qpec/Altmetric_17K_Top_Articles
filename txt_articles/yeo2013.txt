ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate the efficacy of the five
ear acupuncture points (Shen-men, Spleen,
Stomach, Hunger, Endocrine), generally used in
Korean clinics for treating obesity, and compare
them with the Hunger acupuncture point.
Methods A randomised controlled clinical trial
was conducted in 91 Koreans (16 male and 75
female, body mass index (BMI)≥23), who had
not received any other weight control treatment
within the past 6 months. Subjects were divided
randomly into treatment I, treatment II or sham
control groups and received unilateral auricular
acupuncture with indwelling needles replaced
weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment I group received
acupuncture at the five ear acupuncture points,
treatment II group at the Hunger acupuncture
point only and the sham control group received
acupuncture at the five ear acupuncture points
used in treatment I, but the needles were
removed immediately after insertion. BMI, waist
circumference, weight, body fat mass (BFM),
percentage body fat and blood pressure were
measured at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after
treatment.
Results For the 58 participants who provided
data at 8 weeks, significant differences in BMI,
weight and BFM were found between the
treatment and control groups. Treatment groups
I and II showed 6.1% and 5.7% reduction in
BMI, respectively (p<0.004). There were no
significant differences between the two
treatment groups.
Conclusions This finding suggests that the five
ear acupuncture points, generally used in Korean
clinics, and the Hunger point alone treatment are
both effective for treating overweight people.
INTRODUCTION
Excess body weight is the sixth most
important
factor
contributing
to
the
overall burden of disease worldwide.1
While the average life expectancy has
decreased, owing in part to obesity, the
major adverse effects include cardiovas-
cular disease, type 2 diabetes and several
cancers.2
3 WHO describes obesity as
one of the most blatantly visible, yet most
neglected, public health problems.4
Auricular acupuncture therapy is based
on the understanding that the external ear
represents all parts of the human body,
including the internal organs, and pro-
vides acupuncture points corresponding
to these parts.5 Auricular acupuncture
therapy was discovered by Dr Paul Nogier
based on observations that backaches were
cured after the patient received a burn on
their ear.6 Dr Nogier pictured an auricle
as a fetus that was curled up and upside
down; he used his anatomical knowledge
to treat diseases by applying pressure to
the reaction points that represent the
internal organs. This treatment method
was first reported at the International
Acupuncture Medical Academy in 1956
(Marseilles,
France).6
It

used
for
obesity,7 8 smoking,9 10 drug addiction11
and other conditions.12–14 Auricular acu-
puncture therapy for obesity has been
reported to be relatively safe, economical,
effective and to reduce body weight by
decreasing the desire to eat.15 16

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This was a randomised controlled clinical trial (figure 1).
Each patient was allocated to receive unilateral auricu-
lar acupuncture at five ear acupuncture points once a
week for 8 weeks (treatment I), at the Hunger acupunc-
ture point alone (treatment II), or assigned to the
control group. Three sets of group numbers were
generated by computer and placed in opaque sealed
envelopes. Subjects drew put one envelope which was
then opened by an independent investigator who did
not participate in the study process. Subjects were
instructed to eat the same number of meals regularly
and not to eat any snacks, meat or wheat flour meal.
Meals comprised one bowl of rice (210 g) for subjects
>70 kg and two-thirds of a bowl of rice (140 g) for
those <70 kg, with instructions to eat side dishes
balanced with the rice. Also, subjects were instructed
not to take exercise other than that required for their
daily work.
Subjects and setting
The trial was conducted from April to September
2006. Ninety-one Koreans (16 male and 75 female)
with a body mass index (BMI) ≥23, who answered
advertisements posted in daily newspapers and in hos-
pital pamphlets, were included in the study. The
Asia-Pacific Region of WHO defines BMI≥30 as
severe
obesity,
30>BMI≥25
as
obesity
and
25>BMI≥23 as overweight for the Asian population.
In this study, we defined BMI≥23 as obesity in a
broad sense.25
The sample size calculation was based on a previous
study which used a similar intervention in similar
patient groups and the same primary outcome instru-
ment.20 A total of 123 individuals volunteered to par-
ticipate and their suitability for the study was verified
using the inclusion and exclusion criteria through tele-
phone
interview
and
a
preliminary
examination
before the study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria
are listed in table 1.
The 91 participants were allocated randomly into
the treatment I (n=31), treatment II (n=30) or
control (n=30) group. The study was approved by the
institutional
review
board
of
the
department
of
applied Korean medicine of Kyung Hee University
and all subjects provided informed consent (AKMC
IRB 0601-01-A3).
Treatment
Treatment I subjects received unilateral acupuncture
with indwelling needles at five ear acupuncture points
(Shen-men, Stomach, Spleen, Hunger, Endocrine),
which are generally used in Korean clinical treatments
(see online supplementary figure S1).19 20 Treatment
II subjects received an indwelling needle unilaterally at
the Hunger acupuncture point only, whose specificity
has
been
reported.19

 acupuncture in one ear on the first visit. One week
later, the applied needles were removed and the same
treatment was performed on their other ear. The
needles used for the treatment groups were tack-like,
0.2×2 (head diameter×point length) mm-sized Dong
Bang acupuncture needles. The heads of tack-like
needles are fixed on surgical tape so that when the
steel points are inserted, the needles remain attached
to the skin (Suwon, Korea). The depth of insertion
was 2 mm. The control group received sham acupunc-
ture at the five ear acupuncture points used in treat-
ment I group at their first visit. The needles used for
the control group were fixed on surgical tape, but
were removed immediately after insertion (2 mm),
while the surgical tape remained on the acupuncture
points (figure 2). After 1 week, the surgical tape was
removed and the same procedure was performed on
their other ear. A single doctor of traditional Korean
medicine performed all treatments.26 Treatment was
carried out once a week for 8 weeks; subjects were
blinded to their group assignment.
All three groups were subject to a reduced-intake
diet regimen with exercise forbidden (see “Study
design” section), to exclude any confounding factor
that might affect the treatment.
Measurement
The outcomes were BMI, waist circumference (WC),
weight, body fat mass (BFM), percentage body fat
(PBF) and blood pressure (BP). W
eight was measured
once a week from before the start of treatment
through 8 weeks and after removing the needles at
8 weeks
(nine
measurements
in
total)
using
the
Fatness Measuring System DS-102 (Dong Sahn Jenix,
Korea). Height was measured twice at the beginning
of the study using the Fatness Measuring System
DS-102 and the mean was recorded. WC, BFM, PBF
and BP were measured at 4-week intervals, before
treatments at 1 and 5 weeks and after removing the
needles at 8 weeks (three measurements in total). WC
was measured half way between the lowest subcostal

 line and the top of the iliac crest. BFM and PBF were
measured by the bioelectrical impedance method
using the InBody330 (Biospace, Korea). BP was mea-
sured after resting for 5 min, using a sphygmomanom-
eter (HICO, Japan). One trained nurse performed all
measurements and was blinded to the participants’
group. Compliance with diet and exercise regimen
was recorded by the patients and checked weekly at
the clinic. W
e also provided instructions to any sub-
jects with problems in complying with the regimen.
Analysis
All
measurements
are
presented
as
frequencies;
descriptive statistics and continuous variables are pre-
sented as mean±SD. Analysis of variance was con-
ducted to compare changes in physical measurements.
Any measurement that showed a significant change in
F value was processed using multiple comparisons by
least significant difference. To identify the factors
associated with changes in the measurements, a mul-
tiple regression analysis was conducted. In all analyses,
p<0.05 was considered to indicate a significant differ-
ence, using the SPSS V
.12.0 software. Only the partici-
pants who provided information at 8 weeks were
included in the statistical analysis.
RESULTS
As shown in figure 1, 91 participants were rando-
mised to three groups. Nine participants dropped out
of each of the two treatment groups and 15 from the
control group.
Groups were similar at baseline (table 2) except for
a significant difference in mean age (p=0.029) of the
three groups.
Body mass index
There were significant differences in BMI among the
three groups from 4 weeks. The treatment and control
groups differed significantly, from 3 weeks (figure 3).
Treatment groups I and II showed 6.1% and 5.7%
reduction in BMI (p<0.004) at 8 weeks. No signifi-
cant difference in BMI was found between the treat-
ment I and treatment II groups (table 3).
Age and baseline BMI were significantly associated
with the reduction in BMI. With increased age and
higher baseline BMI, the percentage reduction of BMI
was greater. Although age differed significantly among
the three groups, the effects according to treatment
group remained significant after controlling for age
and baseline BMI (see online supplementary table S1).
Waist circumference
WC decreased in all three groups from 4 to 8 weeks
and the reduction was greatest in the treatment I
group. There were no significant differences between
the three groups after 4 weeks (F=2.20; p=0.145);
however, the three groups differed significantly after
8 weeks (F=4.58; p=0.018). Further, after 8 weeks,
there was a significant difference between the treat-
ment I and control groups, but not between the treat-
ment II and control groups (table 3).
Only gender was significantly associated with base-
line WC; the mean baseline WC of women was
10.6 cm less than that of men. Only age affected WC

reduction of WC was greater. However, after control-
ling for age, an increase in the percentage reduction in

eight differed significantly between the treatment
groups and the control group after 4 weeks, whereas
there was no significant difference between treatment

BFM, body fat
There were no significant differences in BFM between
the three groups after 4 weeks (F=1.30; p=0.279),

DISCUSSION
After 8 weeks of treatment, BMI, WC and weight dif-
fered significantly between the control group and the
treatment groups. This difference was supported by
differences in WC and BFM, but not BP
. The differ-
ence between treatment groups in WC did not persist
when corrected for age.

 In this study, withdrawals occurred mostly from 3
to 5 weeks owing to dissatisfaction with weight loss,
difficulty in following the dietary regimen, schedule
conflict and unknown reasons. The most common
reasons, dissatisfaction with, and difficulty following,
the dietary regimen, were particularly notable in the
control group. This supports the suggestion that the
treatment groups found it easier than the control
group to regulate the desire to eat. Also, compliance
was
high
after
1–2 weeks,
but
not
thereafter.
Therefore, more positive management may be neces-
sary to enhance the compliance from 3 weeks onward
(see online supplementary table S3).
W
e aimed to blind participants using the same acu-
puncture points for treatment I group and the control
group. However, even if the acupuncture needle is
removed
immediately,
the
temporary
stimulation
might produce an effect in the control group. Despite
this possibility, significant differences between the
treatment I group and the control group remained. In
future studies, the effect according to duration of
stimulation should be investigated. Also, only single
blinding of the subjects was conducted because it was
not possible to blind the operator by use of a sham
needle.27
Significant differences among the treatment I, treat-
ment
II
and
control
groups
were
evident
from
4 weeks. Thus, in future studies, treatment should be
continued for at least 4 weeks. The percentage reduc-
tion of BMI was greater with increased age and base-
line BMI. However, the effects according to the
treatment groups remained significant after control-
ling for age and baseline BMI.
WC measurements were reduced in treatment I
compared with the treatment II and control groups,
though this trend disappeared when corrected for age.
Also, we recognised that measurement of WC is
subject to greater measurement error than body
weight or BMI. It has been reported that the effective-
ness of acupuncture for patients with obesity is related
to metabolic function.28 29 Increased metabolic func-
tion promotes metabolisation of fat and results in
weight loss.30 Through this mechanism, our results
suggest that treatment I is more useful than treatment
II in metabolising abdominal fat. Thus, continuous
stimulation of the five acupuncture points generally
used in Korean clinics resulted in a significant reduc-
tion in central obesity in comparison with continuous
stimulation of the Hunger acupuncture point only, or
temporary stimulation of the five acupuncture points.
If the trend we found is supported by other studies,
stimulation of the Hunger acupuncture point is more
convenient and a good choice; whereas if the patients
have central obesity, then the five acupuncture points
generally used in Korean clinics should be used. Age
and baseline BMI may influence the effectiveness of
auricular acupuncture treatment of obesity. Further
studies are necessary to clarify the correlation between
the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture treatment
and age and baseline BMI.
One limitation of our study is the statistical differ-
ence in age between treatment groups I and II, which
might have affected the results. Also, the study sample
might have been too small to identify a small differ-
ence
between
the
acupuncture
treatments.
The
dropout rate was high at 36%. As obesity is a long-
term problem, future studies need to test the effective-
ness of acupuncture for longer follow-up periods.
Finally, we did not test the blinding of the control
group; participants in this group might have examined
the adhesive dressings in their ears and found no
needles.
CONCLUSIONS
Both five-needle acupuncture treatment generally used
in Korean clinics and one-needle treatment at the
Hunger point appear to be effective in reducing body
weight in the short term. The five-needle treatment
may be better for reducing WC.
Summary points
▸
Auricular acupuncture is often used to induce weight
loss.
▸
We randomised overweight people to a five-point
treatment, a single-point treatment and a sham
control over 8 weeks.
▸
Both treatments were more effective than the sham
control.
