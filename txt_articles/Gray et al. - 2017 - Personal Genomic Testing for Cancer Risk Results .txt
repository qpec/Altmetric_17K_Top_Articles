Purpose
Significant concerns exist regarding the potential for unwarranted behavior changes and the
overuse of health care resources in response to direct-to-consumer personal genomic testing
(PGT). However, little is known about customers’ behaviors after PGT.
Methods
Longitudinal surveys were given to new customers of 23andMe (Mountain View, CA) and Pathway
Genomics (San Diego, CA). Survey data were linked to individual-level PGT results through a secure
data transfer process.
Results
Of the 1,042 customers who completed baseline and 6-month surveys (response rate, 71.2%), 762
had complete cancer-related data and were analyzed. Most customers reported that learning about
their genetic risk of cancers was a motivation for testing (colorectal, 88%; prostate, 95%; breast,
94%). No customers tested positive for pathogenic mutations in highly penetrant cancer sus-
ceptibility genes. A minority of individuals received elevated single nucleotide polymorphism-based
PGT cancer risk estimates (colorectal, 24%; prostate, 24%; breast, 12%). At 6 months, customers
who received elevated PGT cancer risk estimates were not significantly more likely to change their
diet, exercise, or advanced planning behaviors or engage in cancer screening, compared with in-
dividuals at average or reduced risk. Men who received elevated PGT prostate cancer risk estimates
changed their vitamin and supplement use more than those at average or reduced risk (22% v 7.6%,
respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.44 to 8.18). Predictors of 6-month behavior include
baseline behavior (exercise, vitamin or supplement use, and screening), worse health status (diet
and vitamin or supplement use), and older age (advanced planning, screening).
Conclusion
Most adults receiving elevated direct-to-consumer PGT single nucleotide polymorphism-based
cancer risk estimates did not significantly change their diet, exercise, advanced care planning, or
cancer screening behaviors.

INTRODUCTION
Although the vast majority of cancer genomic
testing occurs within the health care system, direct-
to-consumer (DTC) personal genomic testing
(PGT) is an innovation that seeks to democratize
access to genomic technologies and enhance efforts
in cancer control. However, there are growing
concerns about the potential for unwarranted
health behavior change and the overuse of health
care resources in the wake of PGT.1 These concerns
often stem from the fact that the modest increases
in cancer risk associated with single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) based testing are not cur-
rently considered medically actionable.2,3 Critics of
DTC-PGT have expressed concerns that customers
may inappropriately alter their health behavior on
the basis of highly uncertain genetic information
that has little or no known clinical utility, that
they may not receive proper guidance on health
decisions, and that they may strain an already
overburdened health care system if they pursue
costly follow-up care based on PGTresults.4-8 Early
studies of PGTsuggested that customers may rely on
their physicians to help interpret results and rec-
ommend follow-up testing based on PGT data,9-11
and recent work suggests that some customers

 change health behaviors after testing.12-14 In contrast, others have
found little evidence to suggest that customers significantly alter
their health behaviors after PGT.15-18
The future of PGT remains an area of intense debate. For the
time being, the US Food and Drug Administration has limited
consumer access to the health component of some PGTs out of
concern that such testing could have significant health conse-
quences. In its warning letter to 23andMe (Mountain View, CA), the
Food and Drug Administration expressed specific concerns about
BRCA1/2-related cancer risk assessment given that such testing is
considered a high-risk indication.19 In addition, the American
Medical Association called for a ban on DTC advertising of pre-
scription drugs and medical devices, citing concerns that DTC
advertising may inflate demand.20 Although policymakers are ac-
tively debating the regulation of the genomic testing industry
broadly,21-24 and of PGT specifically, regulatory decisions are sig-
nificantly hampered by a lack of data that evaluate the effect of PGT
on customer health behaviors and health care resource use.25-27
The Impact of Personal Genomics (PGen) Study is a pro-
spective, longitudinal cohort study that was designed to examine
the psychosocial, behavioral, and health outcomes related to DTC-
PGT. The objective of the present analysis was to determine
whether customers who received elevated SNP-based PGT cancer
risk estimates were more likely to change their health-related (ie,

 diet, exercise, vitamin and supplement use, and advanced care
planning) and cancer screening behaviors than customers who
received average or reduced PGT cancer risk estimates. Because we
were most interested in the use of relatively high-cost screening
modalities, we evaluated mammography and colonoscopy for
breast and colon cancer screening, respectively. Because imaging
modalities and invasive procedures are not widely used for prostate
cancer screening, we evaluated use of prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) testing for prostate cancer. We hypothesized that customers
who receive elevated PGT cancer risk estimates would not sig-
nificantly alter their health-related behaviors but that they would
be more likely to engage in cancer screening than consumers who
receive average or reduced PGT cancer risk estimates. Secondary
objectives were to describe individuals’ cancer-related motivations
for PGTand to describe individual-level PGT cancer risk estimates.
METHODS
Study Design and Procedures
New customers of 23andMe28 and Pathway Genomics (San Diego,
CA)29 were invited to enroll onto the PGen Study between March and July
2012. Participants were invited to complete three Web-based surveys at the
following time points: at baseline (BL) before receiving results and 2 weeks
and 6 months (6M) after viewing results. PGT results were returned to
customers per standard company practice and then deidentified, linked to
survey data, and provided to researchers. The PGen Study was approved by

Study Measures
Participants from both companies received a single genetic risk es-
timate based on genotyping of multiple SNPs for breast (women only),
prostate (men only), and colorectal cancer. Consistent with prior analyses
of PGen data, a threshold relative risk (RR) level was selected to distinguish
between elevated and nonelevated genetic risk, with results dichoto-
mized into the following two categories: average or reduced genetic risk
(23andMe RR , 1.2; two lowest Pathway categories) and elevated genetic
risk (23andMe RR $ 1.2; three highest Pathway categories).35 The survey
also queried participants about their interest in learning their cancer
genetic risk and about BL cancer risk perceptions.38 At 6M, participants
were asked about changes in their diet and exercise behaviors and use of
vitamins and herbal supplements that were specifically motivated by their
PGTresults and about changes, or plans to make any changes, to advanced
care planning (eg, creating a will, advance directives) as a result of learning
their genetic information.39 Mammography, colonoscopy, and PSA testing
were measured at BL and 6M.40 Additional details on the study measures
are included in the Appendix (online only).
Statistical Analyses
Data from the BL and 6M surveys were analyzed. Participants were
excluded if they reported any prior cancer diagnosis, reported prior genetic
testing, and/or had missing data on demographic characteristics or PGT
cancer risk estimates. We estimated whether participants’ BL health
behaviors met published standards by comparing participants’ self-
reported dietary and exercise behaviors with recommendations from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and examined
screening behaviors for participants younger and older than age 50 years
(Appendix). We reported BL vitamin and/or supplement use as a di-
chotomous response (any use v no use).
Separate analyses were conducted for each behavioral outcome. Par-
ticipants who affirmatively answered that they had made changes in their
health behavior (eg, diet, exercise) that were specifically motivated by their
PGT results were compared with those who did not make changes. We
examined univariable associations between PGT risk estimates for each
cancer and behaviors at 6M using the x2 and Fisher’s exact tests. We ex-
amined unadjusted associations between participants’ genetic risk scores and
their 6M behaviors according to whether the participant was above or below
the recommended behavior level (or used vitamins or supplements) at BL.
We then fit multivariable logistic regression models to examine the same
associations, adjusting for all covariates of interest (ie, age, race, ethnicity,
sex, education, employment, income, family history of cancer, insurance
status, and health status) plus the BL behavior specific to the behavioral
outcome (eg, BL fruit and vegetable consumption for 6M changes in diet, BL
mammography for 6M mammography use) regardless of statistical sig-
nificance. Additionally, because health-related behaviors may be influenced
by the risk of developing diseases other than cancer, for these outcomes, we
adjusted for participants’ PGT risks for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart
disease. Finally, because interest in cancer risk information and cancer risk
perception can be predictors of screening, we adjusted for these items in the
models for the screening outcomes. In exploratory analyses, we evaluated the
associations between genetic risk scores and screening at 6M for participants
younger than age 50 years and in those age 50 years or older.

Personal Genomic Testing for Cancer Risk
 Given our sample size, the observed proportion of participants with
elevated risk, and a one-sided type I error rate of 0.05, our study had power
of 80% to detect absolute differences in excess of 20%, 12%, and 20% for
changes motivated by being at elevated risk for breast, colorectal, or
prostate cancer, respectively. No variable had $ 10% missing data. All
statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics, PGT Results, and BL
Behaviors
An enrollment summary is shown in Figure 1. De-
mographic and health characteristics and PGTrisk estimates for
the 762 participants included in at least one cancer screening
behavior analysis are listed in Table 1. Self-reported BL be-
haviors are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. At BL, 68% of
participants used vitamins or supplements, 43% met CDC
dietary recommendations, and 35% met CDC exercise rec-
ommendations. At BL, participants age 50 years and older re-
ported high rates of past screening (mammogram, 97%;
colonoscopy, 75%; PSA, 80%).
Health-Related Behaviors and Cancer Screening at 6M
At 6M, a minority of participants made changes in their diet
(31%), exercise behavior (26%), advanced care planning behavior
(6%), or use of vitamins/herbal supplements (21%) in response to
PGT. Overall, screening since receiving PGT test results, as re-
ported on the 6M survey, was 26% for mammography, 7% for
colonoscopy, and 19% for PSA testing. Across all three cancers,
participants who reported screening in the year before ordering
PGTwere the most likely to report screening at 6M. This trend was
maintained after stratification by age (, v $ 50 years), with the
exception of prostate cancer, where frequency counts were small. A
small percentage of participants who reported no prior history of
screening at BL reported screening at the 6M follow-up (mam-
mography, 0.6%; colonoscopy, 2.0%; PSA, 2.5%) with slightly
higher reported rates of colonoscopy (6.5%) and PSA testing
(7.1%) in participants age 50 and older.
Associations Between Genetic Risk and Behavior at 6M
Results of univariable analyses between PGT risk scores and
outcomes are listed in Tables 3-7. Six-month vitamin or supple-
ment use significantly changed among men who were vitamin or
supplement users at BL, and the use of PSA testing went up among
men who had not reported PSA testing at BL.
Figure 3 and Appendix Tables A1 and A2 (online only) present
the multivariable logistic regression model results for 6M be-
haviors. Individuals with elevated cancer genetic risk scores were
not significantly more likely to change their diet, exercise, use of
vitamins or herbal supplements, or cancer screening behavior or
engage in more advanced care planning than individuals who
received average or reduced risk estimates, with one exception;
men who had elevated PGT prostate cancer risk estimates were
more likely to change their vitamin or herbal supplement use (22%
of participants at elevated risk v 8% not at elevated risk; adjusted
odds ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.44 to 8.18). Other significant predictors
of behavior change at 6M include BL behavior (eg, vigorous ex-
ercise; vitamin/supplement use; mammography, colonoscopy, and
PSA testing), worse health status (for diet and vitamin or sup-
plement use), and older age (for advanced planning and for
mammography, PSA and colonoscopy). Finally, higher incomes

 were inversely associated with 6M changes in exercise, and women
were more likely to report 6M changes in advanced care planning.
Participants’ perception of elevated cancer risk at BL was a sig-
nificant predictor only of colonoscopy use. Finally, we found no
significant associations between elevated risk scores and 6M
screening in participants younger than age 50 or age 50 and older
(Appendix Table A3, online only).
DISCUSSION
This study uses a longitudinal design to examine the impact of
return of DTC-PGT cancer risk test results from two prominent
PGT companies on study participants’ cancer-related behaviors.
Consistent with our hypothesis, most PGT customers did not alter
their health-related behaviors in the wake of PGT cancer results,
with one exception; men who received elevated PGT prostate
cancer risk estimates were significantly more likely to change their
vitamin or supplement use than men who received average or
reduced risk estimates. Counter to our hypothesis, however, we
found that individuals who received elevated PGT cancer risk
estimates did not have higher cancer screening rates at 6 months
than individuals who received average or reduced PGT cancer risk
estimates. It should be noted that our ability to detect changes in
cancer screening in our sample of PGT customers was limited,
particularly for those older than age 50 years, because customers
tended to be high users of cancer screening at BL. In contrast, our
ability to detect changes in dietary and exercise behavior was
greater given that only 35% to 45% of participants reported BL
behaviors that were consistent with CDC recommendations.
Although it is not possible to generalize the results of this study
to all Americans, it is important to study early adopters of PGT as
a first step in understanding how direct access to genetics may or
may not affect health-related behaviors and health care use. Our data
advance the field by addressing the questions of whether customers
will change their health-related behaviors or use cancer screening
after receiving PGT results. The provision of DTC-PGT SNP risk
estimates to consumers remains controversial because the clinical
implications of low effect size risk variants are uncertain and the use
of SNP data to independently predict cancer risk is limited.2,3,41,42
Other studies have found that participants report visiting providers
and altering their health behaviors in the wake of testing12-14;
however, recent review articles suggest that the effect of PGT on
personal health behaviors is minimal.4,27,43 Our data confirm and
extend the cancer-related findings from the Scripps study,15,16 in that
neither that study nor ours found significant associations between
the return of individuals’ condition-specific genetic risk estimates
and health-related behaviors or cancer-related screening. Our data
also contribute to the evolving body of literature that indicates that
individuals infrequently alter their risk behaviors after the receipt of
genetic risk estimates. Recent meta-analyses of studies investigating
DNA-based risk estimate testing find no changes in physical activity,
smoking, diet, medication or supplement use, or other unintended
adverse effects of testing.44,45
The association between the receipt of elevated PGT prostate
cancer risk estimates and the use of dietary supplements among
men is notable given the conflicting data about the relative benefits
and harms of vitamin and supplement use for prostate cancer pre-
vention and management.46-51 In fact, the American College of
Preventive Medicine recently recommended against the use of sup-
plements (ie, multivitamins, vitamin E, and b-carotene) for cancer
prevention.52 Our findings are also consistent with data from the Risk
Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer’s Disease (REVEAL) study in
which investigators found that 16% of participants reported a change
in dietary supplement use (eg, vitamins E, gingko biloba) after un-
dergoing genetic risk assessment for Alzheimer disease.53 Notably,
individuals who had at least one copy of the allele that confers an
elevated risk of Alzheimer disease (ie, apolipoprotein E e4) had an
odds of supplement use 4.75 times the odds of individuals without the
elevated risk allele. However, given that our survey asked specifically
about changes in vitamin or supplement use related to PGT testing, we
are unable to determine whether vitamin or supplement use increased
or decreased. Additionally, customers tended to be high vitamin and
supplement usersat BL, and the changes invitamin and supplement use
after PGT tended to be greatest among BL users. Given the growing
nutraceutical industry in the United States and the paucity of regulation
of dietary supplements, findings such as these raise questions about
how PGTand clinic-based genetic testing might be contributing to the
growth of this industry and highlight the need for studies that spe-
cifically focus on the use of nutraceuticals after genomic testing.
Variation across studies in regard to the effect of PGT on
health-related behavior may be attributed to multiple factors.

Personal Genomic Testing for Cancer Risk
 a gatekeeping role when it comes to accessing medical technol-
ogies. Differences in cancer risk perception may be another factor,
because multiple studies have shown that perceived risk is often
predictive of cancer screening behavior.54 Kaufman et al12 found
that PGT customers who considered themselves to be at high risk
for colon cancer were more likely to discuss PGT results with
a physician, change their diet, and increase their physical activity.
Carere et al35 evaluated perceived cancer risk among the broader
PGen Study cohort and found that, with the exception of per-
ceptions for lung cancer risk, consumers who received an elevated
PGT risk result had modest mean positive changes in their risk
perception. Among our participants, colon cancer risk perception
before testing was an independent predictor of colonoscopy use
after PGT. Another factor that may contribute to variation in
customer behavior after testing is customer PGT result compre-
hension. A separate PGen Study analysis found that customers
generally interpreted PGTrisk estimates correctly; however, cancer
risk estimates were not specifically evaluated.33 Kaufman et al12
found that the majority of PGT customers interpret test results
correctly when presented with hypothetical scenarios, and the
Multiplex Initiative found that most individuals who received
testing recalled what had been reported.18 Other studies dem-
onstrate that individuals in the general population often mis-
interpret PGT test results when presented with hypothetical
scenarios.55 Finally, heterogeneity in study populations may in-
fluence PGTuse and post-PGT behavior. Early adopter populations

Fig 3. Behavioral and cancer screening changes specifically motivated by personal genomic testing (PGT) risk for (A) breast cancer, (B) colorectal cancer, and (C) prostate
cancer. Adjusted proportions and odds ratios from multivariable logistic regression are shown. All models are adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, sex, education, employment,
household income, family history of cancer, health insurance, health status, and baseline behavior. Baseline behavior was defined by participant reports of fruit and
vegetable consumption (diet); number of days of leisure-time physical activity (exercise); use of vitamins or herbal supplements; and mammography, colonoscopy, or
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing within the year before testing. Of note, there was no baseline item that specifically pertained to advanced planning. All models
except for the mammography, colonoscopy, or PSA outcome are adjusted further for PGT risk for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and coronary heart disease. The model for the
mammography outcome is adjusted further for interest in genetic risk for breast cancer and baseline perceived risk for breast cancer. The model for the colonoscopy
outcome is adjusted further for interest in genetic risk for colorectal cancer and baseline perceived risk for colorectal cancer. The model for the PSA outcome is adjusted
further for interest in genetic risk for prostate cancer and baseline perceived risk for prostate cancer.

 (such as those explored in our study and others12,15) may be higher
health care users in general, especially compared with a more
diverse sample such as the Multiplex population.18 Additional
research is needed to determine whether there are specific cus-
tomer populations that will be more likely to alter their behavior or
use more health resources after PGT.
Our findings should be interpreted in the context of a few
limitations. First, although we specifically intended to study cur-
rent PGT users and the PGen Study sample is demographically
representative of the DTC-PGT user population,31 our sample is
not representative of the general population. Unlike the general
population, a large proportion of participants had previously re-
ceived cancer screening, with 91% of participants older than age 50
years reporting having been screened in the past (mammography,
97%; colonoscopy, 76%; PSA, 79%). For comparison, in 2010, the
national estimate of adults age 50 to 75 years receiving a colo-
noscopy was 54.9%.56 It is unclear how PGT would influence the
cancer screening behaviors of those who do not meet the rec-
ommended rates of screening. Second, the study included
6 months of follow-up, but observing behavior changes may take
longer, especially for screening behaviors that require a provider
order and behaviors that are recommended on an annual or less
frequent basis. Third, only limited clinical data were collected. For
instance, clinical factors that may be associated with screening
recommendations (eg, having received radiation) were not cap-
tured. Additionally, the survey did not ask about cancer screening
through other modalities, such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, or other
potential confounders (eg, physician ambivalence toward PGT test
results). Finally, we had limited power to detect greater behavior
change among participants at elevated risk compared with par-
ticipants at average or reduced risk for some outcomes. None-
theless, our findings may not have differed substantially had we had
greater power; among our participants, for example, mammog-
raphy use was actually lower among the elevated risk group.
In summary, our study found that adults receiving elevated
SNP-based cancer risk estimates from PGT did not significantly
alter their diet, exercise, or advanced care planning behavior and
were not more likely to engage in cancer screening than adults
receiving average or reduced risk estimates. Given the fact that
SNP-based risk estimates have limited clinical use, patients
need to be prepared for the ambiguities inherent in PGT, and
providers need to be prepared to counsel patients about such
testing. If PGT expands to additional clinical settings and
larger populations, future research will need to assess its as-
sociation with cancer-related behaviors in broader populations
and health care resource use that may or may not accrue as
a result.

Appendix
Supplemental Methods
Study Measures
Genetic risk estimates. Participants from both companies received a single genetic risk estimate based on genotyping of multiple
single nucleotide polymorphisms for breast (women only), prostate (men only), and colorectal cancer. 23andMe (Mountain View,
CA) customers were presented with a relative risk (RR) for each cancer, whereas Pathway Genomics (San Diego, CA) customers
received results on a five-category scale corresponding to increasing RR of cancer (eg, Learn More). To harmonize genetic risk
information across companies, a threshold RR level was selected to distinguish elevated from nonelevated genetic risk, and results
were dichotomized into the following two categories: average or reduced genetic risk (23andMe RR , 1.2; two lowest Pathway
categories) and elevated genetic risk (23andMe RR $ 1.2; three highest Pathway categories).
Interest in learning cancer genetic risk. Interest in learning cancer genetic risk was assessed using a single item (three categories
from “not at all interested” to “very interested”).
Cancer risk perceptions. At baseline, participants were asked to rate their chances of developing breast cancer (women only),
prostate cancer (men only), and colorectal cancer “compared to the average [man or woman] of [the same] age.” Responses were
recorded on a five-point scale ranging from “much lower than average” to “much higher than average”;34 alternatively, participants
could select “I have been diagnosed with this condition.”
Lifestyle behavior, supplement use, advanced care planning behaviors. At 6 months, participants were asked about changes in
their diet and exercise and use of vitamins or herbal supplements that were specifically motivated by their personal genomic testing
results and about changes, or plans to make any changes, to advanced care planning (eg, creating a will, advance directives) as
a result of learning their genetic information.35
Screening behaviors. Mammography, colonoscopy, and prostate-specific antigen testing were measured at baseline and
6 months using questions from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Questionnaire,36 modified to reflect a 6-month
window of interest.
Use of vitamins and herbal supplements. At baseline, participants were asked “Are you currently taking any vitamins on a regular
basis (most days)?” and “Are you currently taking any herbal supplements?” Response options were “yes” or “no.”
Comparisons of Participants’ Self-Reported Behaviors With Published Standards
Dietary recommendations. To estimate whether participants’ baseline dietary behaviors met published standards, we compared
their self-reported behaviors with 2010 recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.
choosemyplate.gov/fruit and http://www.choosemyplate.gov/vegetables). For diet, we equated a serving (the unit of measurement
included in the survey items) with 1 cup and rounded up where necessary. For example, if the recommendation was 1.5 cups per
day, then we required the participant to report having two or more servings per day.
• Recommendations for fruit intake by age and sex
• Women age 19 to 30 years = 2 cups per day
• Women older than age 30 years = 1.5 cups per day (round up to two servings)
• Men = 2 cups per day
• Recommendations for vegetable intake by age and sex
• Women age 19 to 50 years = 2.5 cups per day (round up to three servings)
• Women older than age 50 years = 2 cups per day

 • Men = 3 or 2.5 cups per day, depending on age (round up to three servings)
Exercise recommendations. To estimate whether participants’ baseline exercise behaviors met published standards, we
compared their self-reported behaviors with 2008 recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://
www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/index.htm). For exercise, we calculated an equivalent mix of moderate and vigorous activity as
(2 3 vigorous + moderate) exceeding the threshold set for moderate activity. Recommendations for exercise by age were as follows:
• Age 18 to 64 years (1 or 2 or 3)
1. 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per
week
2. 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per
week
3. An equivalent mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more
days per week
• Age 65 years or older (1 or 2 or 3)
1. 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per
week
2. 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week
3. An equivalent mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more
days per week

*Corresponding to cancer associated with specific screening outcome. For example, for the outcome of mammography, interested in genetic risk for cancer indicates
interest in genetic risk for breast cancer and PGT elevated cancer risk indicates elevated risk for breast cancer.
‡Corresponding to specific screening outcome. For example, for the outcome of mammography, this variable indicates whether the participant received a mam-
mography within the year befire testing. Patients who reported “don’t know or not sure” are included in the group of patients who were not screened in the year before
testing.
