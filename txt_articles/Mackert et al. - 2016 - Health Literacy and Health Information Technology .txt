Abstract
Background: Approximately one-half of American adults exhibit low health literacy and thus struggle to find and use health
information. Low health literacy is associated with negative outcomes including overall poorer health. Health information
technology (HIT) makes health information available directly to patients through electronic tools including patient portals, wearable
technology, and mobile apps. The direct availability of this information to patients, however, may be complicated by
misunderstanding of HIT privacy and information sharing.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether health literacy is associated with patients’ use of four types of
HIT tools: fitness and nutrition apps, activity trackers, and patient portals. Additionally, we sought to explore whether health
literacy is associated with patients’ perceived ease of use and usefulness of these HIT tools, as well as patients’ perceptions of
privacy offered by HIT tools and trust in government, media, technology companies, and health care. This study is the first
wide-scale investigation of these interrelated concepts.
Methods: Participants were 4974 American adults (n=2102, 42.26% male, n=3146, 63.25% white, average age 43.5, SD 16.7
years). Participants completed the Newest Vital Sign measure of health literacy and indicated their actual use of HIT tools, as
well as the perceived ease of use and usefulness of these applications. Participants also answered questions regarding information
privacy and institutional trust, as well as demographic items.
Results: Cross-tabulation analysis indicated that adequate versus less than adequate health literacy was significantly associated
with use of fitness apps (P=.02), nutrition apps (P<.001), activity trackers (P<.001), and patient portals (P<.001). Additionally,
greater health literacy was significantly associated with greater perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness across all HIT
tools after controlling for demographics. Regarding privacy perceptions of HIT and institutional trust, patients with greater health
literacy often demonstrated decreased privacy perceptions for HIT tools including fitness apps (P<.001) and nutrition apps
(P<.001). Health literacy was negatively associated with trust in government (P<.001), media (P<.001), and technology companies
(P<.001). Interestingly, health literacy score was positively associated with trust in health care (P=.03).

 Conclusions: Patients with low health literacy were less likely to use HIT tools or perceive them as easy or useful, but they
perceived information on HIT as private. Given the fast-paced evolution of technology, there is a pressing need to further the
understanding of how health literacy is related to HIT app adoption and usage. This will ensure that all users receive the full
health benefits from these technological advances, in a manner that protects health information privacy, and that users engage
with organizations and providers they trust.

Introduction
Health literacy—how people obtain, understand, use, and
communicate about health information to make informed
decisions [1]—is related to a host of poor health outcomes and
increased health care system costs. With approximately one-half
to one-third of US adults struggling with health information
[2,3], from reading medication labels to following instructions
from health care providers, the need for improved models of
communicating clear and compelling health information is
pressing.
eHealth 
(the 
practice 
of 
using 
the 
Internet 
and
telecommunication technology to provide health communication
and services) [4] presents a powerful tool for bringing health
information to low health-literate audiences in ways that are
easier to access. Indeed, populations in which low health literacy
is more prevalent, such as households with low incomes and
racial or ethnic minorities [2], are also found to be the most
likely to own and rely on a smartphone to access the Internet
[5]. Searching for health topics is a common activity among
those with smartphones; a recent survey from the Pew Research
Center suggested that 62% of individuals who own smartphones
used their phone to acquire information about a health condition
or topic [5]. In this study, we further examined the relationship
between eHealth and health literacy by exploring an emerging
concept, that of health information technology (HIT), which
ranges from personalized fitness trackers to apps on
smartphones, to patient portals for electronic health record
(EHR) systems.
The rapid adoption of mobile phones and smartphones among
populations who are more likely to have low health literacy
presents a tremendous opportunity for improving access to
health information and tools to improve health [6]. eHealth
interventions developed specifically to meet the needs of lower
health-literate users can be more broadly acceptable to
health-literate users too [6,7]. Overall, creating effective eHealth
interventions is an opportunity that could be easily missed,
however, if designers of personal HIT apps do not keep in mind
the needs and preferences of lower health-literate audiences.
Hayrinen et al argue that, as HIT continues to evolve, the “needs
and requirements of different users [should be] taken into
account” [8]. Similarly, Bickmore and Paasche-Orlow argue
that, if researchers work to reduce the barriers related to
accessing and using this technology, HIT may “level the playing
field” for patients of low health literacy [9]. By enabling this
group to receive health information at the right time and place,
patients’ understanding and use of this information will be
facilitated [9]. Ensuring the broadest possible successful
adoption of HIT will ensure a new “digital divide” does not
emerge between more health-literate users who can benefit from
personal HIT apps and less health-literate users who might
struggle to use them to their full potential.
As new HIT tools have become much more widely available,
health-oriented apps designed for patients have exploded in
recent years. There are now thousands of health-related apps
offered through Apple and Android phone services available to
patients for a wide variety of health concerns, from management
of chronic illness management, to sleep behavior monitors,
physical activity and educational and training videos, and calorie
counters. For example, app searches performed by Eng and Lee
[10] uncovered 240 applicable results for the Android platform
when searching for “diabetes” and close to 600 apps designed
for use on an iPhone. Additionally, recent industry reports
indicate that the use of fitness and nutrition apps continues to
grow in popularity as Americans are increasingly willing to use
mobile phone apps to help manage their health [11]. Many of
these apps are relatively affordable and are compatible with a
variety of devices including mobile phones, tablets, computers,
and wearable technology. The growth in this market over the
past 5 years suggests that HIT tools are now available to a wider
demographic, one that spans patients’ abilities to manage health
information.
Another recent development in technology designed for patients
is the creation of EHRs and patient portals, through which
patients can directly access their health information when
connected to the Internet. With the passing of the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act in 2009, there has been notable growth in the
number of nonfederal acute care hospitals becoming equipped
with and using EHRs in the United States [12]. Between 2009
and 2014, the percentage of these hospitals adopting basic EHR
grew from 12.2% to 75.5% [12]. In 2014, 34.4% of the EHRs
adopted offered patients “comprehensive” information, including
notes and orders from their provider and nurse, laboratory
analyses and results, and support for taking medications
appropriately (eg, guidelines, interaction information, and
dosing) [12]. Patients, then, have a great deal of their personal
health information at their fingertips and can monitor changes
in their health through a patient portal. Additionally, EHRs
enable patients to contact their provider with questions about
information presented in the EHR and changes over time. There
is limited research available regarding the factors that determine
whether a patient will use a patient portal or EHR. However, in
one study, the use of a personal health record was determined

 by patients’ perceived ease of use of the technology, as well as
their belief in the advantages offered by the technology and
their ability to test-drive and witness the functions of the EHR
[13]. Among hospitals that have not yet adopted EHRs, an
increasing number have indeed been able to become equipped
for EHR technology [12], and thus the availability of this
technology is projected to continue to expand. Furthermore,
health care providers are likely motivated to adopt EHRs by
incentives provided by the federal government and to avoid
penalties [14,15]. More research is needed to better understand
patients’ reception of this technology.
A review of the recent literature in this area suggests that
evidence on patients’ perceptions and use of HIT tools is rather
limited. Most of the research in the area of HIT has focused on
health care providers’ perceptions of and experiences with these
technologies and their benefits to patient care as a whole [16-18],
yet even these studies were noted as limited [16]. However, it
is the hope that HIT tools will “improve the quality of health
care [and] prevent medical errors” for patients [19] as well.
Governmental agencies note that, by providing patients with
HIT tools, they put the patients in charge of their health care
[20]. Additionally, this may facilitate the concept of a
patient-centered medical home, which aims to bring together
patients, their providers, and technology to develop a central
place of communication and treatment [21]. This fundamentally
changes the paradigm of patient care as it works to minimize
previous barriers to patients having direct access to their
personal health files and creates situations in which patients
might feel empowered to track and manage their health.
However, providing patients with opportunities to engage with
their health information directly over electronic sources also
puts patients’ private information at risk. This could come in
two forms. First, patients who perceive themselves as having a
high ability to manage health information may unknowingly
share information they do not intend to and unknowingly share
personal information they would prefer to be private. On the
other hand, some patients may be reluctant to admit struggles
and ask for assistance with health information, and thus may
not make full use of HIT or could make mistakes that may
compromise their personal information.
Privacy and the protection of personal health information varies
across HIT apps, something perhaps not known by all patients.
For example, EHRs must abide by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)’s Privacy Rule,
which stipulates specific “safeguards” and rules about how a
patient’s health information is handled and disclosed through
an electronic platform such as a patient portal. Because the
Internet is available to everyone, these regulations help ensure
that a patient’s health information will not be “leaked” or be
available to others who do not share an agreement with a health
organization (such as an insurance company). These policies
were set forth to “elicit greater consumer confidence, trust, and
participation in electronic health information exchange” by
patients of all backgrounds [22]. These regulations have
extended privacy coverage so that some businesses such as
Google are indeed held responsible for maintaining privacy of
patient health information [13]. These policies, however, are
limited to only EHRs and health information managed by health
systems. As such, they do not yet apply to other HIT tools such
as the aforementioned health apps and fitness trackers.
These types of privacy policies may lead to a greater sense of
trust in the companies or institutions associated with various
types of HIT. Trust is often an important factor contributing to
the adoption of new technologies [23-25]; however, such
policies could be misleading to patients who struggle with low
health literacy, who might assume that all HIT have similar
patient privacy rules and regulations. The degree to which a
patient exhibits trust in institutions that may develop various
HIT, such as health care organizations, the government,
information technology companies, and media outlets, may
influence their likelihood of adopting HIT and could be
associated with health literacy level.
The purpose of this study was to investigate how health literacy
might be related to use of a variety of HIT apps. Further, it was
intended to investigate how health literacy is related to two
crucial elements associated with HIT usage: (1) understanding
privacy issues related to HIT adoption and (2) trust in various
stakeholders associated in various ways with growth in HIT.
As such, 4 research questions guided this research. (1) Is health
literacy associated with a patient’s use of various forms of HIT
apps including fitness and nutrition apps, activity trackers, and
patient portals? (2) Is health literacy associated with a patient’s
perceived ease of use and usefulness of these HIT apps? (3) Is
a patient’s health literacy associated with perceptions of privacy
associated with HIT apps? (4) Is a patient’s health literacy
associated with perceptions of trust in various institutions
(government, media, technology companies, and health care)?
The remainder of this paper provides an overview of research
methods and a report of study results. This is followed by a
discussion of the implications of this investigation for future
research, practice, and policy. HIT has tremendous potential to
improve the health of users, and this study is a crucial step
toward better understanding how health literacy is associated
with HIT adoption and ensuring that users of all levels of health
literacy can realize those benefits.
Methods
Procedure
We recruited participants from an invitation-only research panel.
All were enrolled members of the panel and received an email
notification of their qualification for the study and a link to an
online survey. The study took approximately 20 minutes to
complete and participants were compensated for their time. The
online survey included items to assess health literacy,
participants’ use and perceptions of four different types of HIT,
and demographic information. The study protocol was approved
by the relevant institutional review board.
Measures
Health Literacy
To measure health literacy, participants completed the task-based
Newest Vital Sign (NVS) measure of health literacy. This
measure asks patients to read and answer 6 questions about a
nutrition label [26]. Sample questions include “If you eat the

 entire container, how many calories will you eat?” and “Pretend
that you are allergic to the following substances: penicillin,
peanuts, latex gloves, and bee stings. Is it safe for you to eat
this ice cream?” These questions require participants to use
basic quantitative (eg, 250 calories × 4 servings) and qualitative
(eg, the list of ingredients includes peanut oil, and therefore
someone allergic to peanuts should not eat the ice cream)
problem-solving skills. Patients are awarded 1 point for each
correct answer they provide. As such, health literacy scores
using this measure range from a total of 0 to 6, where a score
<4 indicates a potential for low health literacy [26]. The NVS
is a valid and reliable measure of health literacy and commonly
used in studies on this topic [26-32].
HIT Use
Participants were asked if they had ever used four different
types of HIT: fitness apps (eg, C25K, MapMyRun, FitStar
Personal Trainer), nutrition apps (eg, MyFitnessPal, Weight
Watchers), activity trackers (eg, Fitbit, BodyBug, a pedometer),
and patient portals (eg, BlueAccess, myUHC).
HIT Perceptions
For each HIT, participants were asked to indicate their degree
of agreement on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to
7 = strongly agree) with a statement related to perceived ease
of use (eg, “Learning to use a fitness app is easy for me.”) and
usefulness (eg, “Using a nutrition app is beneficial to me.”).
Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are core
constructs of the technology acceptance model [33] and are
helpful concepts for understanding participants’ adoption and
use of HIT.
HIT Privacy
Perceptions of privacy were assessed for each HIT: fitness apps
(Cronbach alpha=.763), nutrition apps (Cronbach alpha=.779),
activity trackers (Cronbach alpha=.795), and patient portals
(Cronbach alpha=.821). Participants were asked to indicate their
agreement with 6 statements using a 7-point Likert scale (1 =
strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Sample items are “I
am certain that all the information I reveal on nutrition apps
remains under my control” and “I tell intimate, personal things
about me to be stored in nutrition apps without hesitation” [34].
Trust
Perceptions of trust were examined for four different institutions:
government (Cronbach alpha=.925), media (Cronbach
alpha=.868), technology companies (Cronbach alpha=.885),
and the health care system (Cronbach alpha=.824). Two items
assessed trust in each institution. Participants were asked to
indicate their agreement with statements using a 7-point Likert
scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree); sample items
are “I feel assured the government does a good job making laws
that protect people’s health information” and “I feel the media
does a good job monitoring issues related to health information
privacy.”
Demographics
We collected specific demographic information on sex,
race/ethnicity, age, income, and whether the participant worked
in health care.
Results
Participants
A total of 5151 American adults reflecting the demographic
composition of the United States in terms of sex, age,
race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status participated in this
study. After removing participants with missing data, we
included a total of 4974 participants for analysis. Table 1 shows
the demographic distribution of the sample. Overall, 15.96%
(794/4974) of the sample exhibited low health literacy, by
achieving a score of ≤3 on the NVS measure of health literacy.
In the full sample, 27.64% (1375/4974) indicated having ever
used a fitness app, 33.89% (1686/4974) had used a nutrition
app, 33.39% (1661/4974) had used an activity tracker, and
41.95% (2087/4974) had used a patient portal.
Research Question 1
Research question 1 explored how the use of various HIT tools
may differ between participants with adequate health literacy
(NVS score ≥4) and those with less than adequate health literacy
(NVS score ≤3) [26]. Cross-tabulation analysis indicated that
adequate versus less than adequate health literacy was
significantly associated with use of fitness apps, (χ2
1,
N=4974=5.663, P=.02), nutrition apps (χ2
1, N=4974=18.885, P<.001),
activity trackers (χ2
1, N=4974=54.754, P<.001), and patient portals
(χ2
1, N=4974=102.642, P<.001). Across all HIT tools, fewer
participants with less than adequate health literacy indicated
technology use than those with adequate health literacy (Table
2).
Research Question 2
Research question 2 further examined participants’ perceptions
of various HIT; hierarchical linear regression analysis explored
the association between perceived ease of use and usefulness
for each technology and total NVS score. Specifically, we
conducted eight regression models in which we regressed
demographics (step 1) and total NVS score (step 2) onto
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness for four types
of HIT (fitness apps, nutrition apps, activity trackers, and patient
portals).
Overall, all eight models were significant (Table 3,Table 4,Table
5,Table 6), accounting for between 3.3% and 9.1% of total
variance. Of most relevance to our study, NVS score was
significantly associated with perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness across all HIT after controlling for demographics
(see Table 3,Table 4,Table 5,Table 6 for demographic details).

NVS score
aRegression of demographics onto perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.
bRegression of Newest Vital Sign score onto perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.
cNVS: Newest Vital Sign.
For fitness apps, NVS score was positively associated with both
perceived ease of use (b=.126, t4892=8.546, P<.001, beta=.123)
and usefulness (b=.057, t4890=3.818, P<.001, beta=.056) such
that as NVS score increased, fitness apps were perceived as
easier to use and more useful. Results were similar for NVS
score associated with nutrition app ease of use (b=.135,
t4873=9.246, P<.001, beta=.134) and usefulness (b=.063,
t4872=4.236, P<.001, beta=.063), activity tracker ease of use
(b=.133, t4881=9.005, P<.001, beta=.130) and usefulness (b=.061,
t4877=4.054, P<.001, beta=.060), and patient portal ease of use
(b=.115, t4885=7.861, P<.001, beta=.116) and usefulness (b=.079,
t4884=5.686, P<.001, beta=.084).
Research Question 3
Research question 3 sought to understand how health literacy
might influence perceptions of privacy associated with HIT.
Hierarchical linear regression analysis suggested that NVS score
was significantly associated with perceptions of privacy for
fitness apps, nutrition apps, and activity trackers after controlling
for demographics (Table 7).
Overall, all four regression models explained a significant
proportion of variance in privacy perceptions, ranging from
1.3% to 6.1% (Table 7). NVS score was negatively associated
with privacy perceptions of fitness apps (b=–.106, t1333=–4.528,
P<.001, beta=–.127) and nutrition apps (b=–.087, t1628=–3.825,
P<.001, beta=–.097). Thus, as NVS score decreased, perceptions
of privacy were more likely to be positive. Although the overall
models for activity trackers and patient portal privacy were
indeed significant, the variance explained was not significantly
associated with NVS score in either model (activity trackers:
b=–.048, t1609=–1.938, P=.053, beta=–.049; patient portal:
b=.024, t2021=1.1014, P=.03, beta=.023).
Research Question 4
Research question 4 looked at the association between health
literacy and perceptions of trust in various institutions
(government, media, technology companies, and health care).
Four hierarchical regression models examined the association
of NVS score and trust in each institution; the models explained
a significant proportion of variance in trust perceptions, ranging
from 0.06% to 4.6% (Table 8). After controlling for
demographics, NVS score was negatively associated with trust
in government (b=–.091 t4887=–5.513, P<.001, beta=–.081),
media (b=–.126, t4880=–8.494, P<.001, beta=–.126), and
technology companies (b=–.161, t4874=–10.705, P<.001,
beta=–.158). However, NVS score was positively associated
with trust in health care (b=.031, t4868=2.141, P=.03, beta=.032).

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to better understand how health
literacy is associated with HIT adoption, and relevant issues
such as information privacy and trust. In this study, patients
with low health literacy were less likely to use HIT tools or
perceive them as easy or useful, but they perceived information
on HIT as private. To our knowledge, this is the first wide-scale
investigation of these interrelated concepts.
As might have been expected, HIT adoption—linked to
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness—was associated
with higher health literacy. This stands to reason, given that
health literacy is defined as how people obtain, understand, use,
and communicate about health-related information [1]. Our
results suggest that the actual design of HIT apps, ranging from
wearable technology to patient portals, has room for
improvement so that lower health-literate audiences will perceive
the apps as more useful and easy to use. Indeed, Bickmore and
Paasche-Orlow [9] argue that researchers do not often consider
the limitations of patients of varying abilities when designing
HIT tools. Given that more health-literate users still appreciate
the simplicity and approach of interventions designed for lower
health-literate users [7,35], a focus on design and usability for
lower health-literate users would benefit all users. This is
particularly true given the importance of first impressions in
evaluating technology such as patient portals [36], meaning that
gaining attention from patients may be difficult if their initial
experiences are not positive. The relationship between health
literacy and perceived ease of use was stronger than that between
health literacy and perceived usefulness; while users’ perceived
usefulness might be driven by some factors beyond the control
of HIT developers (eg, potential users might already be
successfully managing a chronic condition and see no need for
a diet app), perceived ease of use matters for all potential users
and a focus on usability could lower barriers to users trying an
app and successfully integrating it into their lives.
The association between health literacy and privacy issues
related to HIT apps was straightforward: lower health literacy
was associated with greater perceptions of privacy when using
HIT apps. This relationship points to fruitful directions for future
research, including focused study of how users of various health
literacy levels make decisions about information to share with
apps and by what criteria they judge the privacy protections of
various HIT apps. This finding also suggests a need for
education on information privacy, perhaps as part of
interventions designed to build health literacy and computer
self-efficacy skills for underserved populations, to help them
make the most informed decisions possible about their health
information privacy.
The relationship between health literacy and trust in various
stakeholders associated with HIT apps was more nuanced. Less
health-literate participants were less trusting of the government,
media, and technology companies; the relationship between low
health literacy and trust in government as an information source
is not new [37], but this research confirms that finding with a
more representative sample. At the same time, those with lower
health literacy were more likely to place trust in health care
providers. Further research is needed to better understand the
drivers of these feelings of trust, but they have major
implications for how HIT apps might be successfully rolled out
to the public. The greater feelings of trust in health care
providers among lower health-literate users suggest that
companies and government organizations interested in rolling
out new HIT to lower health-literate populations should consider
partnering with trusted health care providers to help ensure
adoption.
This study has several limitations that must be acknowledged
when considering the implications of these findings and
directions for future research. First and foremost, this was an
online survey. While the final sample was generally
representative of the US public on key demographic measures,
all users must have had some level of comfort with technology
to be part of the participant pool—the participants in this study
were almost certainly more comfortable with the Internet than
were the US public. Additionally, the study sample was more
health-literate than the general US population. More targeted
data collection focused on less health-literate users is needed
to confirm these findings, but the association of health literacy
with HIT usage and associated issues in this sample suggests
that these associations with less health-literate and
technologically sophisticated users may be even more
pronounced. Given the recent emergence of HIT, this study only
asked participants whether they had ever used the technologies
of interest (ie, fitness and nutrition apps, activity trackers, and

 patient portals); thus, some may have used the HIT only one
time while others used it regularly. Future research would benefit
from a more precise measure of HIT use. The variety of new
HIT apps also means that the potential privacy issues involved
in their use is constantly evolving, suggesting more focused
attention on measurement of different privacy issues related to
HIT usage are needed to strengthen research in this area going
forward.
We used a valid and reliable measure of health literacy, the
NVS, in this study [26]; however, disagreement exists in the
field about the best method for measuring health literacy [38].
Indeed, there are numerous measures of health literacy that
capture this concept in a variety of ways, including general and
topic-specific health literacies [39]. Future work should explore
the impact of general, objective health literacy (as measured in
this study) versus self-reported or topic-specific literacy (such
as fitness or nutrition health literacy) on HIT use. Finally, while
the focus of this study was on the relationship between health
literacy level and various factors related to HIT, the proportion
of variance explained in each model indicates there may be
other important factors that should be considered. Future
research should explore patients’ comfort with and previous
history of using new technology to find and use health
information.
HIT apps, from smartphone apps to wearables devices to patient
portals, have seen widespread adoption in recent years. The
pace of development and capabilities of such tools will only
increase in the future. There is a pressing need to understand
how health literacy is related to HIT app adoption and usage to
ensure that all users receive the full health benefits from these
technological advances, in a manner that protects health
information privacy, and that users engage with organizations
and providers they trust.
