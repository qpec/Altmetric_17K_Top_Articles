Abstract
Inverse associations between dairy consumption and CVD have been reported in several epidemiological studies. Our objective was to
conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of dairy intake and CVD. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify
studies that reported risk estimates for total dairy intake, individual dairy products, low/full-fat dairy intake, Ca from dairy sources and CVD,
CHD and stroke. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to generate summary relative risk estimates (SRRE) for high v. low intake and
stratified intake dose–response analyses. Additional dose–response analyses were performed. Heterogeneity was examined in sub-group and
sensitivity analyses. In total, thirty-one unique cohort studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis. Several statistically significant
SRRE below 1.0 were observed, namely for total dairy intake and stroke (SRRE = 0·91; 95 % CI 0·83, 0·99), cheese intake and CHD
(SRRE = 0·82; 95 % CI 0·72, 0·93) and stroke (SRRE = 0·87; 95 % CI 0·77, 0·99), and Ca from dairy sources and stroke (SRRE = 0·69; 95 % CI 0·60,
0·81). However, there was little evidence for inverse dose–response relationships between the dairy variables and CHD and stroke after
adjusting for within-study covariance. The results of this meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies have shown that dairy consumption may
be associated with reduced risks of CVD, although additional data are needed to more comprehensively examine potential dose–response
patterns.
Key words: Meta-analyses: Epidemiology: Dairy products: Milk: CVD: Stroke: CHD
The global health burden of CVD, including CHD and stroke, is
immense, as CVD is the leading cause of mortality worldwide,
accounting for approximately 30 % of all deaths(1). CVD is the
leading cause of death in Europe, accounting for over four
million deaths each year(2). In Europe, CHD and stroke account
for the first and second most common causes of death, with an
estimated 1·8 million and almost 1·1 million deaths each year,
respectively, although both of these rates have been declining
in most European countries from 1990 to 2010(2). CVD is the
leading cause of death in the USA, and it is responsible for
approximately 600 000–800 000 deaths/annum, or one out of
every three to four deaths(3–6). In the USA, the relative rate of
CVD and stroke declined significantly from 2000 to 2010, but
each year approximately 795 000 people experience a new or
recurrent stroke(3,4). The most common type of heart disease in
the USA is coronary artery disease, which is responsible for
380 000 deaths annually(3,4,6).
Several factors, including modifiable lifestyle factors, have
been identified that increase or decrease the risk of CVD. In a
recent paper regarding trends in CVD, the population attribu-
table fraction was reported to be 40·6 % for high blood pressure
on CVD mortality, and lower yet still meaningful attributable
fractions were observed for smoking, poor diet, insufficient
physical activity and abnormal blood glucose levels(7). On the
basis of a 2014 joint report from the American Heart Association
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National
Institutes of Health, and other governmental agencies, it was
suggested that the declining trend in CVD and stroke rates are
because of enhanced and proactive CVD risk factor control
interventions, such as hypertension control efforts that were
initiated over the past few decades(3,4). Other interventions
have included efforts to control diabetes mellitus and high
cholesterol and smoking cessation programs(3,4,8). Despite these
successful efforts, CVD remains the most significant public
health burden of disease in many countries, including Europe
and the USA.
Several previous studies and meta-analyses have examined
the relationship between dairy intake and CVD and related

 outcomes, with inverse associations generally observed(9–13).
Most recently, Qin et al.(14) conducted a meta-analysis of dairy
consumption and CVD and found statistically significant inverse
associations for dairy consumption and total CVD and stroke,
cheese intake and stroke and CHD, and low-fat dairy intake
and stroke. However, the authors did not perform any dose–
response analyses, and used broad categories of dairy variables
and outcome variables in their analyses.
Given the accumulating epidemiological data on the rela-
tionship between dairy intake and CVD and CVD-related
outcomes, the objective of the present study was to conduct a
comprehensive meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies that
updates the state of the epidemiological science. The specific
aims were as follows: (i) to estimate summary associations
between total dairy intake and specific dairy products and CVD,
CHD and stroke; (ii) to conduct sub-group and sensitivity
analyses by descriptive study characteristics to identify potential
sources of heterogeneity and to evaluate patterns of associa-
tions; (iii) evaluate dose–response using categorical intake
analyses and linear splines; and (iv) to evaluate the potential for
publication bias.
Methods
We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic
reviews
and
meta-analyses
(PRISMA)
guidelines
for
this
systematic review and meta-analysis(15). The PRISMA checklist
has been submitted to the journal as an attachment to this
manuscript. The twenty-seven checklist items pertain to the
content of a systematic review and meta-analysis, which
includes the title, abstract, methods, results, discussion and
funding.
Literature search and study identification
A
comprehensive
literature
search
was
conducted
using
PubMed to identify prospective cohort studies that investigated
dairy consumption and CVD. Additional literature searches
using Embase were performed as well. The exposures of
interest included total dairy intake, specific dairy products (e.g.
milk, cheese, yoghurt), Ca from dairy products (reported as an
analytical variable in the individual studies) and low- and full-fat
dairy intake. The outcomes of interest included CVD, CHD and
stroke. Thus, a comprehensive literature search through March
2015, with no lower date limit, was conducted. The search
included the following terms: (‘dairy products’ [MeSH] OR ‘dairy
calcium’ OR milk OR yogurt OR cheese OR cream OR butter OR
dairy) AND (‘heart diseases’ [MeSH] OR ‘vascular diseases’
[MeSH] OR ‘death, sudden’ [MeSH] OR ‘heart disease’ OR
‘stroke’ OR ‘cerebrovascular accident’ OR ‘sudden death’ OR
‘cardiac arrest’ OR ‘cardiovascular disease’ OR ‘coronary artery
disease’ OR ‘heart failure’ OR ‘cardiovascular mortality’ OR
‘coronary death’ OR CHD OR CVD OR ‘cardiac death’ OR
‘myocardial infarction’ OR angina) AND (‘randomized con-
trolled trial’ [PT] OR ‘cohort studies’ [MeSH] OR cohort OR RCT
OR ‘randomized controlled trial’) NOT (‘animal experimenta-
tion’ [MeSH] OR ‘case reports’ [PT] OR ‘cross-sectional studies’
[MeSH] OR ‘case-control studies’ [MeSH] OR editorial [PT] OR
letter [PT] OR ‘in vitro’ [PT] OR comment [PT] OR review [PT] OR
‘review literature as topic’ [MeSH]). Supplementary literature
searches included screening of reference lists from all relevant
studies, pertinent review articles and meta-analyses. All search
results were screened by two authors.
To be included in the meta-analysis, a published study had to
meet the following criteria: (1) prospective design; (2) adult
human population; (3) English language; and (4) provide risk
estimates and measures of variance for dairy intake and CVD.
Total dairy intake, individual dairy products (e.g. yoghurt or
milk) and dairy-derived Ca intakes were eligible exposure
variables in each study. We did not include studies of dietary
patterns, such as ‘dairy product patterns’ and CVD outcomes.
Total CVD (fatal or non-fatal), CHD (fatal or non-fatal) and
stroke (fatal or non-fatal, including specific types of stroke)
were included as outcomes. The literature search flow diagram
is shown in Fig. 1.
Data extraction and statistical analysis
The following data were extracted from each study: first author,
publication year, cohort name, year of diet assessment, geographic
location, sample size, years of follow-up, population demographic
characteristics, diet assessment method, dairy exposure and
definitions, CVD and related outcomes (including the author-based
definitions and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
codes), median or range of intakes across quantiles, relative
risk (RR) and 95 % CI in each quantile of intake and statistical
adjustments. If more than one article from the same study
population was published, data from the publication with the
longest follow-up were extracted. If one cohort had more than one
publication but each publication presented results from at least one
unique analysis (e.g. the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study),
data were extracted for all unique analyses. Two investigators
ascertained individual study information independently.
Random-effects models were used to calculate summary
relative risk estimates (SRRE), 95 % CI and corresponding
P values for heterogeneity. The study weights were equal to the
inverse of the variance of each study’s effect estimate according
to the methodology developed by DerSimonian and Laird(16).
Relative risks comparing the highest with the lowest category
of intake were combined across all studies to produce the
summary associations. When both crude and multivariate
adjusted RR were provided, we extracted the most fully adjus-
ted risk estimate. Primary meta-analysis models were created
for total dairy consumption, specific dairy products (milk,
cheese and yoghurt), full-fat and low-fat dairy intake, Ca from
dairy sources and total CVD, CHD and stroke. We made an
effort to not mix and match different dairy products together,
and we harmonised our outcome classifications based on
similar disease rubrics. To be included in the total dairy intake
analyses, dairy intake had to be reported in the individual
studies as a composite variable representing dairy intake from
all sources. For example, if data for total milk only was reported
in a study, these data would go into the milk only analyses.
Similarly, total CVD was required to be reported as a composite
of all CVD outcomes rather than specific outcomes, such as

 stroke. Thus, we generated meta-analyses based on specific
dairy products, such as milk, and specific outcomes, such
as CHD or stroke. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses were
conducted to evaluate variability by descriptive study factors
and to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Sub-group
models were generated when three or more studies provided
relevant
data
to
be
meta-analysed.
One-study-removed
sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the relative
influence each study had on the overall model.
We used two different approaches to estimate any possible
dose–response patterns. First, we created meta-analysis models
based on stratified categories of dairy intake. This involved
extracting all available relative risk and 95 % CI data from all
intake categories from all prospective cohort studies. Then, RR
were combined and meta-analysed according to their intake
category. Using this approach, no assumptions were made
concerning linearity, and this method allows for the evaluation
of risk based on varying levels of dairy consumption. However,
this method does not account for within-study intake correla-
tions. Thus, in our second dose–response approach, we con-
ducted linear trend analyses that account for correlated intakes
within studies. Specifically, when events and the number of
person-years per category of dairy intake were available, or
when they could be extrapolated using the methods described
by Aune(17), they were used as input into the two-stage fixed-
effects model described by Greenland and Longnecker(18) using
the
Stata
command
for
generalised
least-squares
trend
(GLST)(19,20) to estimate a summary risk ratio per dose of dairy
intake. Linear splines were used to model dose effects where
knots were placed at the same cut-off points for each dairy
category described in this manuscript. Tests for linearity were
conducted to determine whether splines improved GLST
model fit. A limitation to this method is that the number of
cases and person-years for each intake category are required
for analytical inclusion, and not all studies reported this
information. As a result, more data points were included
in the stratified intake analyses, although the GLST analyses
are able to account for within-study covariance. In addition,
we ran restricted cubic spline GLST analyses; however,
these models did not perform better than the linear GLST
models. Thus, we reported results from the linear spline
analyses.
Most studies reported results in terms of servings per d for
total dairy intake, milk and cheese, although some studies

 reported results based on g/d metrics. Therefore, we harmo-
nised units by converting g/d to servings in these instances.
To do this, we reviewed the distribution of intake in the
individual studies and we also reviewed the United States
Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database(21).
A single serving of milk was considered as 244 g, and a serving
of cheese was considered as 35 g. We were not able to convert
grams of total dairy intake to servings because total dairy intake
represents variable products (e.g. cheese, milk, yoghurt) with
variable conversions. Some studies reported data for dairy
intake and CVD/CHD/stroke per standard deviation of the
mean in g/d or by unit increase in component score(22–24); thus,
data from these studies were used in our dose–response
analyses only.
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran’s
Q test and I2 statistic, which indicates the percentage of variation
attributable to between-study heterogeneity(25). The presence of
publication bias was assessed visually by examining a funnel plot
measuring the standard error as a function of effect size, as well
as performing Egger’s regression method and the Duval and
Tweedie imputation method(26). We generated forest plots for
models of total dairy intake and CVD, CHD and stroke.
All statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis Software (version 3.3.070; Biostat) and Stata
(version 14).
Results
A total of thirty-one unique prospective cohort studies were
included in the meta-analysis (Table 1)(22–24,27–54). Studies were
published between 1996 and 2015 with baseline dietary
assessment periods ranging between 1965 and 2001. Over one
million participants were analysed for CVD or CVD-related
outcomes across the studies. In the majority of studies, ICD
codes for the CVD outcomes were provided. For CVD, ICD-9
codes 390–459 and ICD-10 codes 100–199 were reported; for
CHD, ICD-9 codes 400–414, 427·5, 429·2, 798·1, 798·2, 798·9
and ICD-10 codes 120–125 were reported; and for stroke, ICD-9
codes 430–439 and ICD-10 codes 160–169 were reported.
Follow-up periods ranged between 5 and 26 years, with most
studies following up participants for 10–20 years. Studies were
conducted in a variety of countries, including the USA, Europe,
the Nordic countries, Australia and Japan. Dairy intake infor-
mation was ascertained via FFQ, and while some studies
reported results data for total dairy intake other studies reported
data for specific products, such as milk, or specific constituents,
such as dairy Ca. We made a concerted effort to make our
analytical models as homogeneous as possible in terms of dairy
exposure and CVD outcomes. Thus, if a study-specific variable
was recorded as ‘total milk’, results data for this variable were
not included in the meta-analysis model of individual study
variable labelled as ‘total dairy intake’. Midpoint values of dairy
servings per d ranged between 0·1 and 9·3 for total dairy intake,
0·3 and 3·5 for milk and 0·3 and 6·0 for cheese. However, the
greatest proportion of intake categories ranged between 1
and 3 servings/d for total dairy intake, and between 1 and
2 servings/d for milk and cheese.
Meta-analysis results
The meta-analysis results are summarised in Table 2.
Total dairy intake. Only four cohort studies reported a com-
posite ‘total dairy intake’ variable with specific results data for a
composite ‘total CVD’ variable(32,39,44,51). Meta-analysis of these
studies resulted in an SRRE of 0·88 (95 % CI 0·75, 1·04) with
moderate heterogeneity (PH = 0·076, I2 = 52·7) (Fig. 2). There
was no statistical evidence of publication bias in this model
(P = 0·39).
The SRRE based on the meta-analysis of seven studies of total
dairy intake and total CHD was 0·91 (95 % CI 0·80, 1·04)
(Fig. 3)(30,33,36,39,44,48,50), with significant heterogeneity (PH =
0·038, I2 = 52·8) that was explained, in part, by descriptive
study factors. Sub-group analysis of the three US studies
showed no association between total dairy intake and risk of
total CHD (SRRE = 0·99; 95 % CI 0·92, 1·07)(30,33,36). The
remaining four studies were all conducted among study parti-
cipants from different countries. Four studies evaluated total
dairy intake and CHD risk among women, resulting in an SRRE
of 0·86 (95 % CI 0·71, 1·05)(30,33,39,48). Only one study reported
results data specifically for men. Meta-analysis of studies with
follow-up periods of 15 years or less resulted in a statistically
significant SRRE of 0·81 (95 % CI 0·71, 0·93) with little hetero-
geneity (PH = 0·549, I2 = 0·0)(33,44,48,50), but no association
(SRRE = 1·00) was found in the analysis of studies with greater
than 15 years of follow-up(30,36,39). There was modest variability
between full-fat dairy intake (SRRE = 1·05; 95 % CI 0·93, 1·19)
and low-fat dairy intake (SRRE = 0·90; 95 % CI 0·82, 0·98) on
CHD risk(30,36,44,50). We stratified total dairy intake into three
categories of intake but no patterns of associations based on
levels of intake were apparent, with SRRE of 0·88, 0·93 and 0·86,
based on <1·5 servings, 1·5–3 servings and >3 servings,
respectively. Furthermore, the GLST procedure did not show a
pattern of linear dose–response (RR per serving = 1·00; 95 % CI
0·98, 1·01), and the use of linear spline modelling did not
provide evidence of a non-linear dose–response (χ2 P value =
0·11). No evidence of publication bias was detected in the
model of total dairy intake and CHD (P = 0·41).
Intake of total dairy intake was associated significantly
and
inversely
with
total
stroke
(SRRE = 0·91;
95 %
CI
0·83, 0·99) with moderate heterogeneity (PH = 0·072; I2 = 44·5)
(Fig. 4)(31,39–41,43,44,49). The heterogeneity was explained, in
part, by certain study characteristics, namely duration of follow-
up, fat content and dose. Meta-analysis of studies that followed
up participants longer than 15 years resulted in an SRRE of 0·88
(95 % CI 0·82, 0·95, PH = 0·492, I2 = 0·0). Adding Louie et al.(44)
to this model (the mean follow-up in this study was 15 years)
did not change the SRRE but made the model more homo-
geneous
(PH = 0·614, I2 = 0·00). Both full-fat
dairy intake
(SRRE = 0·91; 95 % CI 0·84, 0·99) and low-fat dairy intake
(SRRE = 0·90; 95 % CI 0·83, 0·96) were associated inversely and
significantly with stroke, with no heterogeneity found in each
model. Less than 1·5 servings and 1·5 or more servings of total
dairy intake were associated inversely and statistically sig-
nificantly with total stroke. We were unable to conduct GLST
analyses because of lack of intake, cases per strata and person-
year information in the articles.

 Milk. The summary association between total milk intake and
total CVD was 0·94 (95 % CI 0·86, 1·03, PH = 0·167, I2 = 38·1),
but it was based on only four studies(32,46,51,54). Collectively,
milk consumption was not associated with CHD, with summary
associations observed slightly above and below the null value
across sub-group analyses by country, sex, follow-up duration
and dose. Meta-analysis of total milk and total stroke produced
a non-statistically significant summary association of 0·90 (95 %
CI
0·79,
1·02)
with
significant
heterogeneity
(PH < 0·001,
I2 = 79·6). The study by Larsson et al.(40) appeared to be an
outlier. Removal of this study in a sensitivity analyses resulted in
an SRRE of 0·85 (95 % CI 0·79, 0·92) and made the model more
homogeneous (PH = 0·163, I2 = 34·7). Although SRRE were
similar and in the inverse direction, the model for total milk and
total stroke among study participants followed up more than
15 years was homogeneous (PH = 0·780, I2 = 0·0). No dose–
response relationship between total milk consumption and total
stroke was apparent in our categorical intake analyses. More-
over, testing for dose–response using the GLST procedure
resulted in no dose–response pattern (RR per serving = 1·0;
95 % CI 0·98, 1·02), and there was no evidence that using linear
splines significantly improved model fit (χ2 P value = 0·85).
Cheese. Cheese intake was associated inversely and non-
statistically significantly with total CVD (SRRE = 0·89; 95 % CI
0·78, 1·01, PH = 0·317, I2 = 13·0), but only three studies reported
results data for this relationship(23,47,51). Consumption of cheese
was associated with a statistically significant inverse SRRE of
0·82 (95 % CI 0·72, 0·93) with minimal heterogeneity (PH =
0·639, I2 = 0·0) for total CHD risk(29,35,47,48,50). Analytical models
based on intake categories were all homogeneous, and ana-
lyses based on 0–0·5 servings and >0·5–1·5 servings were not
statistically significant, whereas >1·5 servings of cheese was
associated with a statistically significant inverse SRRE of 0·86
(95 % CI 0·79, 0·94). In addition, analysis using the GLST pro-
cedure resulted in a 2 % (RR per serving = 0·98; 95 % CI 0·95,
1·01), albeit non-statistically significant, decrease in the RR of
CHD for every serving increase of cheese intake after taking
covariance into account. However, the use of linear splines did
not significantly improve GLST model fit (χ2 P value = 0·67). As
with CHD, cheese intake was associated inversely and statisti-
cally significantly with total stroke (SRRE = 0·87; 95 % CI 0·77,
0·99, PH = 0·198, I2 = 33·5)(35,40,41,47). Although a consistent
pattern of intake response was not as clear, statistically sig-
nificant inverse associations were found for >0·5–1·5 servings
and for >1·5 servings of cheese and total stroke. GLST analyses
did not support a significant pattern of association based on
linear analyses (RR per serving = 0·99; 95 % CI 0·97, 1·01) or the
use of linear splines (χ2 P value = 0·485).
Yoghurt. Yoghurt consumption was not associated significantly
with CVD or CHD. More studies are needed to evaluate the
potential relationship between yoghurt intake and CVD and
CVD-related outcomes.
Calcium from dairy products. Ca from dairy sources (as a
reported variable in the individual studies) was not associated

 significantly with total
CHD (SRRE = 0·94; 95 % CI 0·82,
1·08)(28,42,52,53), but it was associated with a strong and statisti-
cally significant inverse SRRE for total stroke (SRRE = 0·69; 95 %
CI 0·60, 0·81, PH = 0·274, I2 = 21·2)(27,37,42,52,53). A non-linear
pattern of inverse associations for total stroke based on 0–100,
100–300 and >300 mg of dairy Ca was observed. We were
unable to complete a GLST analysis on Ca from dairy product
because of a lack of intake, cases per strata and person-year
information in the articles.
Discussion
Because of the significant public health burden of CVD, iden-
tifying modifiable factors that may decrease the risk of this
disease is of great importance. Thus, we conducted a compre-
hensive meta-analysis to estimate associations between dairy
intake and CVD, CHD and stroke by using all available data
from prospective cohort studies. Although based on data from
observational studies, our analyses indicate that dairy con-
sumption may be associated inversely with CVD, CHD and
stroke, based on extreme quantile comparisons. Collectively,
the large majority of summary associations were <1·0, with
many statistically significant inverse associations. Although the
summary associations were not overly strong in magnitude (as
is commonplace in nutritional epidemiology studies), many
analyses produced 5–15 % reductions in CVD, CHD and
stroke risk.
On the basis of data from the USDA, the average American
consumes approximately 1·85 servings of dairy/d, with men
and women over the age of 20 years consuming 1·95 and 1·50
servings,
respectively(55).
However,
the
USDA
currently
recommends an equivalency of three cups of dairy per d, with a
focus on fat-free or low-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese. We did
not observe clear monotonic inverse trends based on increasing
dairy intake and CVD outcomes, but the majority of our strati-
fied intake analyses show that up to three (or above) servings of
total dairy intake may be associated inversely with CHD and
stroke risk. Similarly, cheese consumption was associated
inversely with CHD and stroke risk at all levels of intake, with
statistically significant SRRE at >1·5 servings. In contrast, no
clear or consistent patterns of inverse associations based on
frequency of milk intake were apparent, which was partly
because of greater data inflection in the individual studies. Our
GLST and linear spline analyses did not produce significant
inverse dose–response trends based on increasing frequency of
dairy intake. Such analyses require studies to report the number
of cases and person-years in each intake strata using a pro-
portional hazards modelling structure. As such, our GLST ana-
lyses included fewer studies based on limited reporting
compared with the stratified intake analyses. However, the
GLST modelling accounts for within-study covariance. Addi-
tional studies, with more complete data reporting for each dairy
intake strata, are needed to more comprehensively examine
potential dose–response patterns.
Our results are concordant with previously published meta-
analyses of dairy consumption and CVD, CHD and stroke. The
most recently published meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies of dairy consumption and CVD reported a summary RR
of 0·88 (95 % CI 0·81, 0·96) for dairy consumption and overall
risk of CVD(14), as well as a statistically significant inverse
association for stroke (RR = 0·87; 95 % CI 0·77, 0·99). However,
the authors did not perform any dose–responses analyses, and
used broader categories of dairy variables and outcome vari-
ables in their analyses. Because broad categories of dairy vari-
ables were used (e.g. milk included with total dairy intake) in
their analyses, a larger number of studies were included in their
analytical models. In contrast, our analyses were rigorously
specific to the type of dairy variable in that we did not combine
different types of dairy products unless a composite dairy
variable was reported in a study. Despite these methodological
differences, our summary findings were relatively consistent.
There are several potential mechanisms by which dairy
intake may beneficially have a role in CVD risk reduction. Dairy
products are a rich source of (i) minerals, such as Ca, K and Mg;
(ii) vitamins, such as riboflavin and vitamin B12; and (iii) pro-
tein, such as whey and casein(56). Individually, collectively or
interactively, all of these nutrient sources may have a favourable
effect on CVD. The potential role of Ca intake and supple-
mentation on CVD risk is a controversial topic, with some stu-
dies suggesting an increased risk while other studies indicating
a null or decreased risk(57–59). However, the source of Ca may
be important.
Although the epidemiological evidence appears to support a
beneficial role of dairy intake on CVD and other chronic disease
outcomes, some researchers have suggested that consumption
of dairy products, a source of SFA, may contribute to an
increase in heart disease. Experimental evidence from human
studies have shown that high intake of SFA increases plasma
levels of LDL-cholesterol(60,61), although milk and dairy pro-
ducts have also been associated with an increase in HDL-
cholesterol and blood pressure reduction(11,61–64). Indeed, the
potential role of diets that are high in SFA on CVD risk is unclear
and controversial, although emerging science suggests that a
potential role of SFA on CVD risk may not be merited. Risk may
depend on the substitutions for SFA that occur as different foods
may affect risk in variable ways(56,65–68). In a meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies, intake of SFA was not associated
with an increased risk of CHD (RR = 1·07; 95 % CI 0·96, 1·19),
stroke (RR = 0·81; 95 % CI 0·62, 1·05) or CVD (RR = 1·00; 95 %
CI 0·89, 1·11) based on comparisons of extreme quintiles(68).
Although our analytical models were harmonised based on
similar exposure and similar outcome classifications, the data
used in this meta-analysis were generated from observational
studies. Therefore, the validity of a meta-analysis is not immune
to limitations, particularly in nutritional epidemiology where
information bias is a predominant concern. In an effort to garner
a better understanding of any potential relationships between
dairy products and CVD, CHD and stroke, we conducted a
variety of unique meta-analyses to discern any potential pat-
terns of associations. Although most analyses produced inverse
associations, it may be possible that those who consume dairy
products, particularly low-fat dairy intake, may engage in other
favourable dietary and lifestyle habits. However, our analyses of
full-fat dairy intake and cheese were not associated with posi-
tive associations for CVD. Rather, inverse associations were

 generally observed for these dietary variables. Furthermore,
most of the observational studies included in this analysis
adjusted for dietary and lifestyle factors, such as physical
activity, sedentary lifestyle and hypertension.
Conclusions
Future prospective studies of dairy consumption and CVD
should focus on isolating the independent effects of specific
types of dairy products on specific CVD outcomes while clearly
indicating the intake levels per stratum. In addition, reporting
RR by varying levels of statistical adjustment may further
elucidate the relevant potential confounding factors on dairy
intake
and
CVD,
and
may
help
researchers
estimate
more accurately the independent effects of dairy intake.
The current meta-analysis serves as an update and expansion
to the existing body of literature on this topic. The results of
this meta-analysis have shown that dairy consumption (high v.
low
intake)
may
be
associated
with
reduced
risks
of
CVD, CHD and stroke, although a dose–response relationship
is not clear based on the existing evidence. Additional
studies are needed that model dairy intake as a continuous
variable to provide a better understanding of any potential
dose–response patterns. As future studies are published,
new meta-analyses may be warranted to continually refine
our understanding of the relationship between dairy intake
and CVD.
