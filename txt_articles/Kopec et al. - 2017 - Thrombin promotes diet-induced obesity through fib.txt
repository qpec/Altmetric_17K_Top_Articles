Introduction
Obesity is a health care crisis of global pandemic status, with an 
estimated 34% of adults and 17% of children in the United States 
classified as obese as defined by a BMI greater than or equal to 30 
kg/m2 (1). The detrimental effects of obesity are due to the fact that 
it induces a state of chronic “metabolic inflammation” whereby the 
control of energy and metabolites in adipose, liver, and muscle tis-
sue is directed largely by innate immune cells (e.g., macrophages) 
and soluble effector molecules (e.g., cytokines) (2–7). Metabolic 
inflammation predisposes individuals to metabolic syndrome and 
associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 
diabetes (T2D), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), osteo-
arthritis, and various cancers that are the most frequent causes of 
death in the United States and most Westernized countries (1, 8).
Obesity is also characterized as a hypercoagulable state. Asso-
ciation studies have documented elevated circulating levels of von 
Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII, and biomarkers of coag-
ulation activity (e.g., thrombin-antithrombin [TAT] complexes, 
thrombin f1+2, D-dimer) in obese individuals (9–11). Activated 
protein C (APC) resistance increases with BMI, in part because of 
elevated factor VIII levels (12). A Mendelian randomization study 
determined that the risk of deep vein thrombosis increased 3.4-
fold for severely obese patients compared with normal-weight 
individuals (13). More notably, both initial risk and severe mor-
bidity and mortality outcomes for vaso-occlusive diseases (e.g., 
coronary artery disease and stroke) positively correlate with the 
degree of obesity in patients (9, 10, 14, 15). Collectively, these 
observations support the notion that obesity increases the risk of 
thromboembolic disease.
Emergent observations in obese patients have suggested 
a reciprocal relationship between the thrombin/fibrin(ogen) 
axis and obesity/metabolic inflammation. A genetic association 
analysis to evaluate the correlation of thrombophilia mutations 
with superficial vein thrombosis determined that factor VLeiden 
is independently associated with a BMI greater than or equal to 
28 kg/m2 (16). Levels of procoagulant factors (e.g., fibrinogen, 
factor VII, factor VIII) are higher in obese patients with T2D 
than in those without T2D (17). Multiple thrombotic risk factors 
(e.g., APC resistance, protein S/protein C deficiency, prothrom-
bin G20210A) are not only frequently present in patients with 
Obesity promotes a chronic inflammatory and hypercoagulable state that drives cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
fatty liver disease, and several cancers. Elevated thrombin activity underlies obesity-linked thromboembolic events, 
but the mechanistic links between the thrombin/fibrin(ogen) axis and obesity-associated pathologies are incompletely 
understood. In this work, immunohistochemical studies identified extravascular fibrin deposits within white adipose tissue 
and liver as distinct features of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) as well as obese patients. Fibγ390–396A mice carrying a mutant 
form of fibrinogen incapable of binding leukocyte αMβ2-integrin were protected from HFD-induced weight gain and elevated 
adiposity. Fibγ390–396A mice had markedly diminished systemic, adipose, and hepatic inflammation with reduced macrophage 
counts within white adipose tissue, as well as near-complete protection from development of fatty liver disease and 
glucose dysmetabolism. Homozygous thrombomodulin-mutant ThbdPro mice, which have elevated thrombin procoagulant 
function, gained more weight and developed exacerbated fatty liver disease when fed a HFD compared with WT mice. In 
contrast, treatment with dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, limited HFD-induced obesity development and suppressed 
progression of sequelae in mice with established obesity. Collectively, these data provide proof of concept that targeting 
thrombin or fibrin(ogen) may limit pathologies in obese patients.

Results
Fibrinogen drives high-fat diet–induced obesity through the γ390–396 
αMβ2-binding motif. To investigate whether fibrin(ogen) could con-
tribute to diet-induced obesity, fibrin(ogen) immunohistochemis-
try was performed on epididymal white adipose tissue and liver 
sections from WT mice fed either a control diet (CD) or a high-fat 
diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Little to no fibrin(ogen) deposits were 
detected in either adipose (Figure 1A) or liver (Figure 1B) from 
mice fed a CD. However, robust fibrin(ogen) deposits were found 
throughout the extravascular spaces between hypertrophic adipo-
cytes in HFD-fed mice (Figure 1A). The most intense fibrin(ogen) 
staining appeared to be in areas between adipocytes in regions 
with macrophage accumulation in what have been termed “crown” 
structures (19). Fibrin(ogen) staining was present throughout the 
liver sinusoids of HFD-fed mice that showed evidence of steato-
sis (Figure 1B). Importantly, sections of visceral adipose tissue 
from obese patients revealed an identical pattern with extravas-
cular fibrin(ogen) deposits present in the adipose tissue and most 
intense in macrophage-rich “crown” structures (Figure 1A). Extra-
vascular fibrin(ogen) deposits were absent in visceral adipose 
from nonobese individuals. Similarly, liver sections from obese 
patients with NASH displayed robust fibrin(ogen) deposits in the 
sinusoids, whereas liver sections with a normal histological pre-
sentation were fibrin(ogen)-free (Figure 1B). Collectively, these 
findings support the concept that fibrin(ogen) could contribute to 
obesity pathogenesis in both humans and mice.
To gain mechanistic insight into the role of fibrinogen in 
HFD-induced obesity, we used 2 complementary mouse strains 
expressing function-selective variants of fibrin(ogen): (a) Fgg 390-
396A (hereafter termed Fibγ390–396A) mice (20), which express a 
mutant form of fibrinogen that has normal clotting function but 
lacks the binding motif for the leukocyte integrin receptor αMβ2, and 
(b) Fgg Δ5 (hereafter termed FibγΔ5) mice (21), carrying a homozy-
gous deletion in fibrinogen for the final 5 amino acids of the γ chain 
that encode the platelet integrin αIIbβ3–binding motif. Cohorts of 
WT and Fibγ390–396A mice were fed a CD and HFD (60% of kcal from 
fat) for 20 weeks. A marked and statistically significant protection 
from body weight gain was observed in Fibγ390–396A mice fed the 
HFD compared with HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 2A), with no effect 
of genotype on body weight gain in mice fed CD. The difference in 
body weight between HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A and WT mice was signif-
icant as early as 4 weeks after starting on the HFD, and the differ-
ential increased throughout the 20-week HFD period (Figure 2, B 
and C, respectively). Body mass composition analysis revealed that 
the difference in body weight was secondary to reduced fat mass 
in Fibγ390–396A mice compared with WT mice, as analyzed at 12 and 
16 weeks on HFD (Figure 2, D and E, respectively). Further, the 
epididymal and inguinal white adipose tissue (eWAT and iWAT, 
respectively) depots isolated from HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice at the 
end of the challenge period were significantly smaller than eWAT 
and iWAT from HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 2, F and G).
In contrast, FibγΔ5 mice fed an identical 60% HFD gained the 
same amount of weight as WT mice over the course of the chal-
lenge period (Figure 2H). Total body weights of CD-fed or HFD-
fed mice were not different between WT and FibγΔ5 mice at any 
time point during the challenge period (see Figure 2, I and J, for 
representative time points of 9 weeks and 16 weeks, respective-
NAFLD, but are associated with the severe form of this disease, 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and advanced liver fibro-
sis (18). Although these association studies are highly intrigu-
ing and have serious potential clinical implications, significant 
knowledge gaps remain, including whether elevated thrombin 
activity and adipose fibrin deposits are causative factors in 
obesity and the identification of potential mechanisms linking 
thrombin and fibrin to obesity sequelae.
Here, we directly explored the hypothesis that fibrin-
(ogen) and thrombin activity exacerbate diet-induced obesity, 
metabolic inflammation, and associated sequelae. To test this 
hypothesis, mice carrying genetically imposed deficiencies or 
functional mutations in fibrinogen, factor XIII, thrombomod-
ulin, or protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) were analyzed 
for changes in body weight gain and altered inflammatory and 
metabolic parameters in both adipose tissue and liver. Our find-
ings provide a mechanistic link between elevated procoagulant 
function and fibrin(ogen)-driven inflammation in adipose and 
liver to exacerbation of obesity and obesity-associated sequelae. 
Further, in proof-of-concept studies using the direct thrombin 
inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, we demonstrate that inhibiting 
thrombin activity ameliorates the development of obesity and 
severity of associated sequelae.

To determine whether the protection from HFD-induced 
weight gain observed in Fibγ390–396A mice was limited to the spe-
cific diet tested, we evaluated weight gain in mice using a sep-
arate set of diets. Here, a HFD formulated to 45% of kcal from 
fat was used with a corresponding CD with 10% of kcal from fat. 
Similar to analyses using the 60% HFD, Fibγ390–396A mice fed the 
ly). No genotype-dependent differences in the weight of eWAT 
(Figure 2K), iWAT (Figure 2L), or liver (not shown) were observed 
in tissues harvested at the end of the challenge period for either 
CD-fed or HFD-fed WT and FibγΔ5 mice. Collectively, these find-
ings indicate that the γ390–396 motif of fibrin(ogen) specifically pro-
motes HFD-induced obesity.

However, similarly to WAT, the BAT weights of Fibγ390–396A mice 
fed a HFD were significantly lower than those in HFD-fed WT 
mice (Figure 3C). Additionally, no genotype-dependent differ-
ences in gene expression of key mediators of thermogenesis (i.e., 
Ucp1 and Ucp2) were observed in HFD-fed WT and Fibγ390–396A 
mice (Figure 3, D and E, respectively).
The fibrinogen γ390–396 motif supports binding to the coag-
ulation transglutaminase factor XIII in addition to binding the 
leukocyte integrin receptor αMβ2 (23). To determine whether the 
decrease in body weight following HFD feeding observed in 
Fibγ390–396A mice relative to WT mice involved factor XIII, mice 
deficient in the catalytic A subunit of factor XIII (F13a1–/–) and WT 
mice were fed the 60% HFD and CD for 20 weeks. In contrast to 
results with Fibγ390–396A mice, weight gain of F13a1–/– mice was vir-
tually identical to that of WT mice (Supplemental Figure 2, A–C). 
Similarly, there were no genotype-dependent differences in the 
weight of eWAT or liver for either CD-fed or HFD-fed WT and 
F13a1–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 2, D and E, respectively).
Fibγ390–396A mice are protected from the development of HFD- 
induced systemic and local inflammation. To determine wheth-
er the lower body weight gain and fatty liver disease observed 
in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice were indeed linked to a reduction 
in systemic and local inflammation, we first measured circulat-
ing proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in plasma. TNF-α, 
MCP-1, and IL-17A have each been linked to exacerbation of 
obesity-associated sequelae (24–28), and each was significantly 
45% HFD gained more weight than those on CD, but, impor-
tantly, gained significantly less weight compared with WT mice 
fed the 45% HFD (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental mate-
rial available online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/
JCI92744DS1). The significant difference in weight gain was 
first apparent at 7 weeks on HFD, and the differential increased 
to the end of the challenge period at 20 weeks (Supplemental 
Figure 1, B and C, respectively). Analysis of eWAT and iWAT 
revealed that these tissues had a significantly greater mass in 
WT mice fed the 45% HFD compared with Fibγ390–396A mice (Sup-
plemental Figure 1, D and E, respectively).
The difference in weight gain displayed by the Fibγ390–396A 
mice on either the 60% or the 45% HFD could not be explained 
by differences in food consumption (Figure 3A and data not 
shown, respectively). In addition, the weight gain difference did 
not appear to be linked to differences in intestinal fat absorp-
tion, as no genotype-dependent difference in fat absorption was 
detected in mice fed a CD or HFD for 16 weeks (Figure 3B). How-
ever, HFD-fed WT mice overall displayed significantly higher fat 
absorption than CD-fed mice (Figure 3B), as previously described 
(22). Similarly, the difference in HFD-induced weight gain did 
not appear to be linked to differential compensatory changes in 
brown adipose tissue (BAT). As expected, the BAT weight in WT 
mice was significantly higher in HFD-fed animals than in CD-fed 
animals (Figure 3C). A significant increase was also observed 
for Fibγ390–396A mice when comparing CD- and HFD-fed animals. 
Figure 3. Fibγ390–396A mice consume the same amount of food, have similar intestinal fat absorption, and have reduced brown adipose tissue weight fol-
lowing HFD challenge compared with WT mice. (A) Food consumption based on weight of food consumed per mouse per week for WT and Fibγ390–396A mice 
fed a CD (n = 4 per genotype) and a 60% HFD (n = 9 per genotype). (B) Intestinal fat absorption using the behenic acid assay (see Methods) for WT and 
Fibγ390–396A mice fed either a CD or a 60% HFD for 16 weeks (n = 4 mice per genotype per diet). (C) Brown adipose tissue (BAT) weights of WT and Fibγ390–396A

VA with Student­Newman­Keuls post hoc test. *P < 0.05 for analyses comparing differences between genotypes on the same diet. #P < 0.05 for analyses 
comparing differences between diets with mice of the same genotype.

similar pattern, with adipocyte area being small in CD-fed mice, 
significantly elevated in HFD-fed WT mice, but comparatively sig-
nificantly lower in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice (Figure 5C). An analy-
sis was performed for neutrophils in eWAT, but few if any positive 
cells were identified in any of the eWAT tissue samples (data not 
shown). Collectively, these results suggest that Fibγ390–396A mice are 
protected from the development of inflammation associated with 
obesity as well as obesity itself.
Fibγ390–396A mice are protected from the development of HFD- 
induced fatty liver disease and glucose dysmetabolism. To determine 
whether reduced weight gain in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice was 
linked to protection from the development of obesity sequelae, 
we first evaluated fatty liver disease. Histological analysis of liv-
er sections revealed significant steatosis in HFD-fed WT mice but 
not in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice (Figure 6A). This tracked with 
liver weights of HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice that were significant-
ly lower compared with those of HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 6B). 
Fibrin(ogen) deposits were absent in livers from CD-fed mice but 
were readily detected in the liver sinusoids of HFD-fed WT mice 
around hepatocytes displaying histological evidence of steatosis 
(Figure 6A). Fibrin(ogen) deposits were detected in the liver sinu-
soids of HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice (Figure 6A), but like the dimin-
ished steatosis, these fibrin(ogen) deposits were also significantly 
reduced (Figure 6C). Matching the changes in liver histology, liv-
er triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in HFD-fed WT 
mice compared with Fibγ390–396A mice (Figure 6D). Notably, the fat-
ty liver disease in HFD-fed WT mice was associated with signif-
icant hepatocellular damage as indicated by elevated serum ala-
nine aminotransferase (ALT; Figure 6E). HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice 
elevated in HFD-fed WT mice compared with CD-fed WT mice 
(Figure 4, A–C, respectively). However, circulating levels of these 
proinflammatory mediators were significantly lower in HFD-fed 
Fibγ390–396A mice compared with WT mice (Figure 4, A–C). Proin-
flammatory macrophages and effector molecules have been 
linked to exacerbation of adiposity in diet-driven obesity (29–31). 
Thus, we examined expression of genes encoding inflammatory 
markers in eWAT. Here, eWAT mRNA levels of F4/80 (Adgre1) 
and TNF-α (Tnf) were significantly elevated in HFD-fed WT 
mice compared with CD-fed WT mice but significantly lower in 
HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice (Figure 4, D and F). MCP-1 mRNA lev-
els (Ccl2) in eWAT were not different between HFD-fed WT and 
Fibγ390–396A mice, although each was elevated in comparison with 
corresponding CD-fed animals (Figure 4E).
To further evaluate the effect of the fibrinogen γ390–396A muta-
tion on adipose inflammation, eWAT tissue sections from CD- 
and HFD-fed mice were stained for adipose tissue macrophages 
(ATMs) using the macrophage marker F4/80. In CD-fed animals, 
F4/80+ cells were sparse in both genotypes (Figure 5A). In con-
trast, F4/80+ cells were readily detected in eWAT from HFD-fed 
WT mice and appeared clustered in “crown” structures (Figure 
5A). F4/80+ cells were also observed in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice, 
but appeared fewer in number. Quantification of F4/80+ cells indi-
cated a significant increase in cell number for HFD-fed mice over 
CD-fed mice for both genotypes, although the number of F4/80+ 
cells was significantly reduced in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice com-
pared with HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 5B). Consistent with the 
notion that fibrin(ogen)-driven macrophage function was promot-
ing adiposity, quantification of adipocyte size revealed a strikingly

(D–F) Levels of mRNA in eWAT for the macrophage marker F4/80 (Adgre1) (D), the macrophage chemokine MCP­1 (Ccl2) (E), and the proinflammatory

dent­Newman­Keuls post hoc test. *P < 0.05 for analyses comparing differences between genotypes on the same diet. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 for analyses 
comparing differences between diets with mice of the same genotype.

were protected from hepatocellular injury as indicated by serum 
ALT activity equivalent to that of CD-fed mice (Figure 6E). Hepat-
ic inflammatory markers were also examined. Levels of Adgre1 
mRNA were elevated in HFD-fed mice compared with CD-fed 
animals, but no genotype-dependent difference was observed 
(Figure 6F). Significantly reduced hepatic mRNA levels of Ccl2 
and Tnf were observed in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice compared WT 
mice (Figure 6, G and H, respectively). The potential molecular 
basis of significantly diminished steatosis in Fibγ390–396A mice was 
revealed through analysis of gene products associated with lipid 
accumulation/lipogenesis. Hepatic mRNA levels of the nuclear 
receptor PPARγ (Pparg), the fatty acid sensor CIDEA (Cidea), and 
the fatty acid transporter CD36 (Cd36) were each significantly 
lower in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice compared with WT mice (Fig-
ure 6, I–K, respectively).
HFD-mediated changes in glucose metabolism were also 
determined. Analysis of fasting blood glucose levels showed that 
HFD-fed mice of both genotypes had significantly higher blood 
glucose levels compared with CD-fed mice (Figure 7A). Impor-
tantly, glucose clearance was impaired by HFD challenge, but 
clearance was significantly more efficient in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A 
mice compared with HFD-fed WT mice as analyzed by 2-hour 
glucose tolerance tests (Figure 7B). Similarly, HFD-fed WT mice 
displayed a profound loss of insulin sensitivity as shown by insulin 
tolerance tests compared with CD-fed mice. Insulin sensitivity in 
HFD-challenged Fibγ390–396A mice was significantly improved com-
pared with that in HFD-fed WT mice (Figure 7C). Accordingly, we 
observed significantly elevated fasting insulin levels in HFD-fed 
mice compared with CD mice, but insulin levels were significant-
ly lower in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice compared with HFD-fed WT 
mice (Figure 8A). Consistent with differential body weights, the 
adipokines leptin and resistin were significantly higher in HFD-
fed WT mice compared with HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice at 20 weeks 
(Figure 8, B and C, respectively). Interestingly, leptin, resistin, and 
adiponectin were each significantly lower in Fibγ390–396A mice com-
pared with WT mice fed a CD (Figure 8, B–D, respectively).
Mice with a genetically imposed procoagulant state exhibit exacerbated 
 
obesity following a HFD challenge. The effect of diet and fibrinogen 
genotype on coagulation parameters was assessed by measurement 
of TAT, D-dimer, and platelet factor 4 (PF4) in the plasma of CD-fed 
and HFD-fed WT and Fibγ390–396A mice. HFD challenge resulted in 
significantly higher TAT and D-dimer levels in WT mice compared 
with CD-fed mice (Table 1). Notably, plasma levels of both of these 
coagulation markers were also elevated in Fibγ390–396A mice fed a HFD 
compared with a CD (Table 1). Plasma levels of the platelet activation 
marker PF4 were similar across diet and genotype (Table 1), suggest-
ing that differential platelet activation was not the basis of fibrinogen 
genotype–dependent differences in HFD-induced obesity.
To investigate whether enhanced procoagulant function 
itself could alter the development of diet-induced obesity 
and obesity-associated disease sequelae, we evaluated HFD- 
induced obesity in mice homozygous for a Glu404Pro mutation 
in the thrombomodulin receptor (ThbdPro). ThbdPro mice exhibit 
a hypercoagulable state due to significantly reduced thrombin 
binding and disrupted thrombomodulin-dependent protein C 
activation by the mutant receptor. Both ThbdPro and WT ani-
mals gained significantly more weight on the HFD than cohorts 
of mice fed a CD (Supplemental Figure 3A). However, ThbdPro 
mice fed a HFD gained significantly more weight than WT mice 
fed a HFD (Supplemental Figure 3A). The significant geno-
type-dependent difference in body weight was first apparent at 
approximately 11 weeks on the HFD (Supplemental Figure 3B) 
and persisted through 16 weeks (Supplemental Figure 3C). MRI-
based body mass composition revealed a significant increase in

(Supplemental Figure 4B). HFD-fed ThbdPro mice had significantly 
higher liver triglyceride levels than WT mice fed a HFD (Supple-
mental Figure 4C). Similarly, HFD-fed ThbdPro mice had signifi-
cantly higher ALT levels relative to HFD-fed WT mice and mice fed 
a CD (Supplemental Figure 4D). Inflammatory genes in the liver 
were not significantly elevated in HFD-fed ThbdPro mice compared 
with HFD-fed WT mice (Supplemental Figure 4, E–G). However, 
hepatic mRNA levels of the lipogenic genes Pparg, Cidea, and Cd36 
(Supplemental Figure 4, H–J) were significantly higher in HFD-fed 
ThbdPro mice compared with HFD-fed WT mice. Taken together, 
these data indicate that defective thrombomodulin function exac-
erbates obesity-induced fatty liver disease.
HFD studies in ThbdPro and Fibγ390–396A mice suggested that 
(a) dysregulated thrombin activity promotes obesity and (b) the 
mechanism of thrombin-driven obesity is linked to fibrinogen. 
To determine whether the mechanisms of thrombin-driven 
 
HFD-induced obesity could also be mediated through the 
thrombin substrate protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), we 
analyzed HFD-induced obesity using PAR1-deficient mice 
(F2r–/–). Cohorts of F2r–/– mice and WT mice were fed the same 
eWAT weights of HFD-fed ThbdPro mice were significantly ele-
vated compared with those of HFD-fed WT mice (Supplemental 
Figure 3F), and the iWAT weights trended higher (Supplemental 
Figure 3G). The increase in adiposity for ThbdPro mice was asso-
ciated with increased adipose inflammation. Levels of mRNA 
for F4/80 (Adgre1), MCP-1 (Ccl2), and TNF-α (Tnf) were each 
significantly elevated in eWAT of HFD-fed ThbdPro mice com-
pared with HFD-fed WT mice (Supplemental Figure 3, H–J).
The liver weight of HFD-fed ThbdPro mice was significantly ele-
vated compared with that of HFD-fed WT mice (Supplemental Fig-
ure 4A). Microscopic analysis of livers from CD-fed WT and ThbdPro 
mice indicated a normal liver histology (Supplemental Figure 4B), 
whereas livers from HFD-fed WT mice revealed robust steatosis 
that was exacerbated in HFD-fed ThbdPro mice (Supplemental Fig-
ure 4B). Notably, immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections 
revealed significant fibrin(ogen) deposits lining the hepatic sinu-
soids of HFD-fed WT mice, which appeared elevated in liver sec-
tions of HFD-fed ThbdPro mice in terms of both the area and intensity 
of staining (Supplemental Figure 4B). Liver sections from CD-fed 
mice revealed little fibrin(ogen) staining regardless of genotype

more weight and fat mass compared with mice fed CD (Figure 
9F). Importantly, the extent of weight gain in weeks 12–20 was 
markedly reduced in HFD-fed mice receiving DE compared 
with mice receiving HFD without DE, a change attributable to 
reduced accumulation of fat mass, not lean mass (Table 3). Dif-
ferences in body weight could not be accounted for by differences 
in food consumption (not shown). Serum ALT activity increased 
dramatically in mice fed HFD from weeks 12 to 20, denoting the 
onset of hepatocellular injury and more severe NAFLD (Table 3). 
Serum ALT failed to increase in HFD-fed DE-treated mice (Table 
3), indicating that in addition to limiting HFD-induced adiposity, 
DE treatment in established obesity suppresses the progression of 
existing NAFLD. Histological assessment of liver tissue from mice 
at the end of the 20-week evaluation period indicated lower extent 
of microvesicular steatosis, the form of lipid accumulation spe-
HFD and CD used in Fibγ390–396A and ThbdPro studies (i.e., 60% 
of kcal from fat). Consistent with previous studies (32), no gen-
otype-dependent difference in weight gain was observed in 
WT and F2r–/– mice on either diet (Supplemental Figure 5A). 
Indeed, the weights of individual HFD-fed WT and F2r–/– mice 
were comparable at multiple weeks on the diet (Supplemental 
Figure 5, B and C). Further, the weights of eWAT and livers iso-
lated from WT and F2r–/– mice at the end of the challenge period 
were not different between CD-fed or HFD-fed animals (Sup-
plemental Figure 5, D and E, respectively).
The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate protects mice 
from HFD-induced obesity development and successfully treats estab-
lished obesity sequelae. In agreement with an earlier report (33), we 
found that prophylactic administration of dabigatran etexilate (DE) 
(7.5 mg/g diet) over the course of 20 weeks attenuated body weight 
gain (and fat mass) in mice fed a HFD (60% of kcal from fat) (Figure 
9, A–C), indicating protection from obesity in 2 distinct HFD-induced 
obesity models. Our working hypothesis was that the beneficial effect 
of DE was through prevention of thrombin-mediated fibrin deposi-
tion in WAT of HFD-fed mice. DE treatment significantly reduced 
levels of high–molecular weight fibrin species (defined as >350 kDa) 
in extracts of eWAT from HFD-fed mice, as determined by capil-
lary-based Western blotting (Figure 9D). The absence of these fibrin 
species in plasma clots formed using F13a1–/– plasma confirmed the 
identity of these species as prototypical cross-linked fibrin.
To address whether DE could rescue established obesity, mice 
were fed CD or HFD without the drug for 12 weeks to induce obe-
sity (Table 2). The mice then continued to receive the same diet 
for an additional 8 weeks, but were randomized to receive diet 
with or without DE during this rescue arm of the study (Figure 
9E). As expected, HFD-fed mice without DE continued to gain

(ogen) is a potent proinflammatory disease modifier of inflamma-
tory arthritis, neuroinflammatory disease, muscular dystrophy, 
and colitis (35–38). Here, we show evidence of extensive fibrin-
(ogen) deposition in both WAT and liver from obese mice that was 
absent in nonobese mice. These fibrin(ogen) deposits appeared to 
serve as foci for the accumulation of macrophages. Importantly, 
a virtually identical fibrin(ogen) staining pattern was observed 
in adipose tissue from obese patients, providing direct evidence 
in support of a role for this provisional matrix protein in human 
obesity- 
related disease.
Fibrin(ogen) deposits in tissues may influence the obese phe-
notype through several non–mutually exclusive mechanisms. 
However, our data suggest that a key mechanism of protection 
from HFD-induced obesity observed in Fibγ390–396A mice is down-
cifically associated with the most detrimental manifestations of 
NAFLD (data not shown) (34). In addition, DE treatment of HFD-
fed mice provided a significant protection from HFD-induced 
increase in blood glucose levels (Table 3). Collectively, these stud-
ies are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that interven-
tion with a direct thrombin inhibitor attenuates the progression of 
HFD- 
induced obesity and its associated pathologies.
Discussion
A key objective of our studies presented here was to determine 
whether fibrinogen promotes exacerbation of HFD-induced obe-
sity, adipose tissue inflammation, and the downstream develop-
ment of metabolic sequelae. Supporting a functional role for fibrin 
deposits are previous findings indicating extravascular fibrin-

macrophages were observed in the eWAT of HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A 
mice, which was likely a product of overall reduced inflammation 
in these animals. In regard to adipocyte function, it is notable that 
when adipose tissue expands as a consequence of HFD feeding, 
preadipocytes are programmed to differentiate, permitting a 
hyperplastic expansion of functional adipocytes that preserves 
insulin sensitivity. Adipose infiltration by ATMs has been shown 
to promote an adipogenic deficit by suppressing preadipocyte dif-
ferentiation (41, 42). It is possible that WAT fibrin(ogen) deposits 
promote both production of key proinflammatory soluble media-
tors that drive obesity sequelae and ATM-mediated suppression of 
preadipocyte differentiation.
Our studies directly implicate the γ390–396 motif in fibrin 
(ogen)-
driven HFD-induced obesity. This motif supports binding to the 
leukocyte integrin receptor αMβ2. A recent study documented 
significantly diminished adipose tissue inflammation as well as 
protection from HFD-induced insulin resistance and fatty liver 
disease in αM-deficient mice, results that are complementary to 
our data (43). Intriguingly, HFD-fed αM-deficient mice did not 
show protection from weight gain, suggesting either that various 
αM ligands have opposing effects on HFD-induced WAT adipos-
ity, or that the γ390–396 motif promotes WAT weight gain through 
mechanisms separate from αM. In this regard, the β2-integrin fam-
ily member αXβ2 (CD11c/CD18) has been shown to bind fibrino-
gen through the γ390–396 domain and is expressed by monocytes/
macrophages (44, 45). Inflammatory CD11c+ cells are significantly 
increased in obese adipose tissue and appear to contribute to the 
obese phenotype (46–48).
The coagulation transglutaminase factor XIII also binds the 
fibrinogen γ390–396 motif (23). F13a1 gene expression is significantly 
upregulated in WAT of both obese patients and mice fed a HFD 
(49, 50). Further, factor XIII has been suggested to act as a neg-
ative regulator of adipogenesis (50). Nevertheless, we show that 
loss of factor XIII activity does not phenocopy results observed in 
Fibγ390–396A mice, as F13a1–/– mice gain the same amount of weight 
as WT mice following HFD feeding. Collectively these findings 
suggest that the primary effect of the γ390–396A mutation in obesi-
regulation of adipose inflammation and ATM function. This 
hypothesis is supported by multiple previous studies. In 2 separate 
reports, the elimination of macrophages in mice resulted in sig-
nificant protection from HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity 
analogous to the protection from obesity we observed in Fibγ390–396A 
mice (29, 30). The obesity phenotype is specifically associated 
with accumulation and activation of M1-polarized proinflammato-
ry macrophages, whereas M2-polarized antiinflammatory macro-
phages are associated with a lean phenotype and protection from 
obesity (31, 39). It is possible that adipose fibrin(ogen) functions 
through the γ390–396 motif to drive ATMs to the obese M1 pheno-
type. Our gene expression analyses indicating reduced Tnf-α and 
Ccl2 mRNA expression in WAT from HFD-challenged Fibγ390–396A 
mice are consistent with this concept. Fibrin(ogen) γ390–396A may 
alter obesity by failing to stimulate M1 polarization or by active-
ly promoting a protective M2 polarization in adipose. Although 
additional investigation is required to define the precise impact of 
fibrin(ogen) on macrophage activation in obesity, it is notable that 
we did not observe higher levels of M2 markers (e.g., Arg1) in WAT 
from HFD-challenged Fibγ390–396A mice (data not shown), suggest-
ing that fibrin(ogen) γ390–396A expression results in a failure of M1 
polarization, rather than an active shift toward an M2 phenotype.
A central question addressed by the current study was how 
fibrin(ogen) modifies the local expression of soluble mediators that 
influence the obesity phenotype. Notably, the genetic elimination 
or pharmacological depletion of either TNF-α or MCP-1 results 
in significant protection from HFD-induced insulin resistance 
and NAFLD (24, 26, 40). We observed significantly reduced local 
expression of Tnf-α mRNA levels in HFD-challenged Fibγ390–396A 
mice that tracked with protection from the development of glu-
cose dysmetabolism and NAFLD. We postulate that the reduction 
in obesity sequelae is a function of diminished body weight and 
adiposity in HFD-fed Fibγ390–396A mice. However, the protection 
from HFD-induced NAFLD may be multifactorial, a product of 
reduced weight gain and reduced local fibrin-driven inflamma-
tion in the liver. Notably, the single loss of either TNF-α or MCP-
1 does not confer protection from weight gain and increased 
adiposity (24, 26, 40). This suggests that fibrin(ogen) alters the 
function of adipocytes or preadipocytes (a) through a requisite 
combination of soluble mediators, (b) through ATM-mediated 
mechanisms beyond the production of proinflammatory media-
tors, (c) by directly engaging adipocytes or preadipocytes, or (d) 
by some combination of these mechanisms. Diminished F4/80+

obesity-associated sequelae in mice suggests that targeting throm-
bin may be a beneficial therapeutic approach. Previous studies 
showed that intervention with another thrombin inhibitor, arga-
troban, significantly reduced systemic inflammation and plasma 
cholesterol levels in mice with established hypercholesterolemia 
and obesity (71). Could the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), 
currently relegated to antithrombotic therapy, be therapeutical-
ly beneficial in patients with established obesity? Obesity and its 
sequelae often coexist with atrial fibrillation, a primary indication 
for NOAC therapy (72). Notably, weight loss itself has been shown 
to reduce stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation (73). Thus, 
NOAC therapy in patients with an existing indication may confer 
an additional metabolic benefit. Although the treatment strategy 
is anchored in strong and reproducible experimental results, the 
idea of treating patients with metabolic syndrome and obesity 
with NOACs may be viewed as challenging. However, the overall 
favorable bleeding risk profile of these agents, together with the 
emergence of highly specific and efficacious reversal agents for 
available NOACs, may ultimately tip the risk/benefit balance to 
favor this possibility.
In this study, we define a novel mechanism of inflammation in 
experimental obesity mediated by the fibrin(ogen) leukocyte inte-
grin αMβ2–binding motif. Through gain- and loss-of-function stud-
ies targeting thrombin generation and downstream substrates, 
these studies are, to our knowledge, the first to ascribe throm-
bin-driven obesity to a function of fibrin(ogen) and not PAR1 
signaling. Moreover, to our knowledge, these studies are the first 
to experimentally demonstrate that procoagulant mutations are 
capable of exacerbating obesity-associated pathologies, authenti-
cating association studies in humans (16, 17, 74).
The deciphered mechanism is responsive to modulation with 
thrombin-targeted FDA-approved therapeutic agents. More spe-
cifically, fibrin-driven obesity appears amenable to targeted inhi-
bition of the fibrin(ogen) γ390–396 motif. In summary, the thrombin/
fibrin(ogen) axis is not only a critical trigger of HFD-mediated 
systemic inflammation, but a pharmacologically and genetical-
ly adjustable driver of obesity and related pathologies such as 
NAFLD and glucose dysmetabolism.
Methods
Mice. ThbdPro, Fgg 390–396A (Fibγ390–396A), Fgg Δ5 (FibγΔ5), F13a1–/–, and 
F2r–/– mice backcrossed 7 generations to C57BL/6 were all previously 
described (20, 21, 75–77). Age-matched littermates of WT and homo-
zygous mutant male mice between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks were 
used. For DE experiments, male C57BL/6J mice at 6 weeks of age 
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and allowed to acclimate 
in the animal facility for 2 weeks before being enrolled in studies. 
Mice were housed at an ambient temperature of 22°C with alternat-
ing 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles, and provided water and rodent 
chow ad libitum before study initiation.
HFD-induced obesity. Mice were fed ad libitum a CD of standard 
mouse chow that provides about 13% of the kilocalories (kcal) derived 
from fat (Laboratory Autoclavable Rodent Diet 5010; LabDiet) or a 
HFD with 60% of the kcal derived from fat (catalog D12492; Research 
Diets Inc.). In some experiments, mice were fed a CD with 10% of the 
kcal derived from fat (catalog 56834; Test Diet) or a HFD with 45% of 
the kcal derived from fat (catalog 55629; Test Diet). In DE studies, mice 
ty is not mediated simply by a decrease in factor XIII binding. A 
recent study by Myneni and colleagues indicated that HFD-fed 
F13a1–/– mice gain the same amount of weight as WT mice, aligned 
with our findings, but that F13a1–/– mice had diminished adipose 
tissue inflammation and were protected from insulin resistance 
(51). It was suggested that the mechanism of factor XIII exacer-
bation of adipose inflammation and obesity sequelae was linked 
to fibronectin (51); however, a possible link to fibrin(ogen) was 
not considered. We postulate that factor XIII may be influencing 
HFD-induced pathologies through a mechanism whereby cross-
linked fibrin drives a greater proinflammatory response and has 
a greater impact on ATM function than non–cross-linked fibrin, a 
general hypothesis supported by previous work in our laboratory 
(52). However, defining the precise interplay of fibrin(ogen) and 
factor XIII in obesity sequelae, including insulin resistance and 
NAFLD, remains for future investigation.
The identification of fibrinogen as a potent modifier of obe-
sity implicates both upstream coagulation system components 
and downstream fibrinolytic factors as potential obesity mod-
ifiers. In this regard, elevated circulating levels of tissue factor 
(TF) and factor VII have been documented in obese patients 
with T2D and in mice fed a HFD (9, 10). High levels of blood-
borne TF are considered a biomarker of severe microvascular 
disease in T2D patients (53, 54). Further, TF mRNA levels and 
activity are increased in the visceral adipose tissue of obese 
mice; specifically, TF expression is high in infiltrating ATMs (55, 
56). Direct evidence of a causative relationship for TF in obesity 
was shown in mice lacking the cytoplasmic tail of TF, which con-
ferred protection from HFD-induced weight gain and insulin 
resistance that was linked to TF/factor VIIa–mediated signaling 
by PAR2 in ATMs (57). Additionally, mice with low TF expres-
sion in the bone marrow compartment similarly were protected 
from HFD-induced weight gain (58). Here, we provide strong 
evidence that the TF/thrombin/fibrin(ogen) pathway also pro-
motes obesity, glucose dysmetabolism, and fatty liver disease. 
Fibrinolytic/plasminogen activation system components have 
long been associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. In 
particular, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is marked-
ly elevated in obese patients and is considered a biomarker of 
obesity and metabolic syndrome (59–62). Visceral adipose tis-
sue is the largest source of PAI-1 in obese patients and is derived 
from both adipocytes and infiltrating ATMs (62–65). The genet-
ic elimination of PAI-1 in mice fed a HFD has been shown to 
result in diminished obesity and insulin resistance in several 
studies (66–69). In addition, mice deficient in tissue plasmino-
gen activator (tPA) were shown to develop exacerbated obesity 
following HFD challenge (70). Collectively these findings are all 
consistent with the concept that persistent fibrin deposits drive 
diet-induced obesity.
Analyses of ThbdPro mice indicated that these animals devel-
op exacerbated HFD-induced obesity and associated sequelae. 
Although it is possible that the increased obesity observed in 
these animals was secondary to loss of Thbd antiinflammatory 
mechanisms, our data are consistent with our prevailing hypoth-
esis that it is exacerbated thrombin procoagulant function driv-
ing HFD-induced obesity in these mice. Indeed, our finding that 
therapeutic DE administration effectively halts the progression of

after 18 weeks on diet. Human recombinant insulin (Novolin-R; Novo 
Nordisk) was administered by i.p. injection at a dose of 0.75 U/kg body 
weight. Blood glucose readings were taken at 15-minute intervals. For 
both glucose and insulin tolerance tests, AUC was determined for 
blood glucose profiles from individual mice.
Hepatic triglyceride determination. Hepatic triglyceride content 
was determined as described previously (78). Briefly, 100 mg of frozen 
liver tissue was homogenized, mixed with chloroform/methanol (2:1), 
and incubated overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, H2O was 
added with collection of the lower lipid phase by centrifugation and 
vacuum concentration. The lipid pellets were dissolved in a mixture 
of isopropanol and Triton X-100 and analyzed spectrophotometrical-
ly for triglycerides (600 nm) using commercially available reagents 
(Pointe Scientific).
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR. Total RNA 
was isolated from 100 mg of tissue using Trizol (Ambion) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA (1 μg) was used for cDNA syn-
thesis with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied 
Biosystems). Levels of TNF-α (Tnf), MCP-1 (Ccl2), F4/80 (Adgre1), 
PPARγ (Pparg), CIDEA (Cidea), CD36 (Cd36), UCP1 (Ucp1), UCP2 
(Ucp2), and β2-microglobulin (B2m) were determined using TaqMan 
gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI StepOne Plus 
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The expression of 
each gene was normalized relative to B2m expression levels, and rela-
tive expression level determined using the Pfaffl method (79).
Detection of fibrin(ogen) by capillary Western blotting. To assess 
WAT levels of cross-linked high–molecular weight fibrin(ogen), 100 
mg of eWAT was homogenized in 8 M urea, 40 mM DTT, 12.5 mM 
EDTA based on protocols outlined previously (23, 80), rotated end 
over end in a 60°C incubator for 2 hours, and incubated stationary 
at 60°C overnight (~15 hours). Samples were collected by centrifu-
gation and resolved on Wes 66- to 440-kDa 25-microcapillary gels 
(Protein Simple). Fibrin(ogen) was detected with polyclonal rabbit 
anti–human fibrinogen antibody (reference A0080; Dako) per the 
manufacturer’s protocol (Protein Simple). To identify precise spe-
cies, in vitro fibrin polymerization was performed using citrated 
WT and F13a1–/– mouse plasma, stimulated with human α-throm-
bin (2 U/ml final) (Enzyme Research Laboratories) in a CaCl2 (10 
mM final) buffer for 30 minutes at 37°C. Samples were processed 
in urea/DTT/EDTA buffer, and fibrin(ogen) species were detected 
using capillary Western blot.
Intestinal fat absorption. Mice were fed with a CD or 60% HFD for 
16 weeks, after which a diet containing 5% sucrose polybehenate, a 
nonabsorbable food additive, was fed to the mice ad libitum for 3 days. 
Fecal pellets were collected on days 3 and 4. Fat absorption was calcu-
lated from the ratios of behenic acid to other fatty acids in the diet and 
in the feces by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters.
Statistics. In studies in which the weights of mice over time were 
determined, the data were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA. 
Comparison of 2 groups was performed using a 2-tailed Student’s t 
test. Comparison of 3 or more groups was performed using 1-way or 
2-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. P values for 
all comparisons are indicated in the figure legends, but for all analyses 
the criterion for statistical significance was P less than 0.05.
Study approval. Mice were maintained in Association for Assessment 
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International–accredited 
facilities and approved by the IACUC at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital 
were fed a 60% HFD (catalog 112252; Dyets Inc.) identical to catalog 
D12492 from Research Diets Inc. with or without 7.5 mg/g DE. Control 
mice were fed modified AIN-93M CD (Dyets Inc., 10% of kcal derived 
from fat) with or without 7.5 mg/g DE. Both the HFD and the CD with 
and without DE were formulated to contain 1% peanut flavoring to 
mask the bitter taste of the drug. Note that terminal circulating DE 
concentrations were determined for each group and found to be 388.2 
and 248.0 ng/ml for the CD and HFD groups, respectively, in the pro-
phylactic study and 327.0 and 358.2 ng/ml for the CD and HFD groups, 
respectively, in the rescue study. The total body weight of mice and 
weight of food consumed were determined weekly. Whole body com-
position analysis was determined as indicated using a 3-in-1 analyzer 
for fat mass, lean mass, and water (EchoMRI or Bruker NMR). At the 
end of the observation period, mice were euthanized for collection of 
citrate plasma, serum, and organ harvest. The weight of eWAT, iWAT, 
BAT, and liver was determined at harvest.
Histopathology and clinical chemistry. Mouse eWAT and a medi-
al or left lateral lobe of the liver were used for histological analysis. 
Biopsy samples of human visceral adipose and liver were obtained 
from the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Pediatric Obesity Tissue 
Repository from obese patients with either normal liver histology 
or a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NASH. Tissue sections 
of visceral adipose from nonobese individuals were obtained from 
Origene. Formalin-fixed tissue sections (5 μm) were stained with 
H&E or by immunohistochemistry with either a rabbit polyclon-
al anti–mouse fibrinogen antibody (previously described in ref. 
36) or a monoclonal anti–human fibrinogen antibody (reference 
A0080; Dako). Fibrin(ogen) staining was quantified using ImageJ 
(NIH). Epididymal adipose sections stained with F4/80 (catalog 
MCA497G; Bio-Rad Laboratories) were scanned and digitized using 
a Virtual Slide System VS110 (Olympus). The area of individual adi-
pocytes was calculated using Olympus cellSens Dimension Desk-
top Software (version 1.15). Specifically, 50 individual adipocytes 
selected from at least 5 different areas of the digitized sections were 
analyzed per sample.
For genetically modified mice, blood was collected at the end 
of the observation period from the inferior vena cava in citrate. For 
studies where mice were treated with DE-containing chow, blood 
was collected by retro-orbital bleeding after 12 weeks on CD or HFD 
and analyzed for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glu-
cose levels. ELISA analysis was used to determine the plasma levels 
of TAT complexes (Siemens Enzygnost TAT kit), D-dimer (Biomatik 
Mouse D-dimer kit), and PF4 (RayBio Mouse PF-4 ELISA kit). Serum 
ALT activity was determined using a commercially available reagent 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and adi-
pokines were determined using Milliplex Magnetic Bead multiplex or 
single-plex kits (Millipore) and read using a Bio-Plex (Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories). Concentrations were calculated from standard curves using 
recombinant proteins and expressed in picograms per milliliter or 
micrograms per milliliter.
For analysis of blood glucose, mice were fasted for 6 hours fol-
lowed by blood glucose measurements taken using an ACCU-check 
Performa meter (Roche) from a tail vein blood sample. Glucose tol-
erance tests were performed after 16 weeks on diet. Mice were fasted 
for 6 hours, and dextrose was administered by i.p. injection at a dose 
of 1 g/kg mouse body weight with blood glucose readings taken at 
15-minute intervals. Insulin tolerance tests were performed on mice
