 IMPORTANCE—Emotional and behavioral symptoms in cognitively normal older people may be 
direct manifestations of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology at the preclinical stage, prior to 
the onset of mild cognitive impairment. Loneliness is a perceived state of social and emotional 
isolation that has been associated with cognitive and functional decline and an increased risk of 
incident AD dementia. We hypothesized that loneliness might occur in association with elevated 
cortical amyloid burden, an in vivo research biomarker of AD.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether cortical amyloid burden is associated with greater 
loneliness in cognitively normal older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Cross-sectional analyses using data from the 
Harvard Aging Brain Study of 79 cognitively normal, community-dwelling participants. A 
continuous, aggregate measure of cortical amyloid burden, determined by Pittsburgh Compound 
B–positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), was examined in association with loneliness in linear 
regression models adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOEε4), socioeconomic status, 
depression, anxiety, and social network (without and with the interaction of amyloid and 
APOEε4). We also quantified the association of high amyloid burden (amyloid-positive group) to 
loneliness (lonely group) using logistic regression, controlling for the same covariates, with the 
amyloid-positive group and the lonely group, each composing 32%of the sample (n = 25).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Loneliness, as determined by the 3-item UCLA 
Loneliness Scale (possible range, 3–12, with higher score indicating greater loneliness).
RESULTS—The 79 participants included 43 women and 36 men with a mean (SD) age of 76.4 
(6.2) years. Mean (SD) cortical amyloid burden via PiB-PET was 1.230 (0.209), and the mean 
(SD) UCLA-3 loneliness score was 5.3 (1.8). Twenty-two (28%) had positive APOEε4 carrier 
status, and 25 (32%) were in the amyloid-positive group with cortical PiB distribution volume 
ratio greater than 1.2. Controlling for age, sex, APOEε4, socioeconomic status, depression, 
anxiety, and social network, we found that higher amyloid burden was significantly associated 
with greater loneliness: compared with individuals in the amyloid-negative group, those in the 
amyloid-positive group were 7.5-fold (95%CI, 1.7-fold to 34.0-fold) more likely to be classified as 
lonely than nonlonely (β = 3.3, partial r = 0.4, P = .002). Furthermore, the association of high 
amyloid burden and loneliness was stronger in APOEε4 carriers than in noncarriers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—We report a novel association of loneliness with cortical 
amyloid burden in cognitively normal older adults, suggesting that loneliness is a neuropsychiatric 
symptom relevant to preclinical AD. This work will inform new research into the neural 
underpinnings and disease mechanisms involved in loneliness and may enhance early detection 
and intervention research in AD.
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a pathophysiological process encompassing preclinical, mild 
cognitive impairment and dementia stages that leads to progressive neuropsychiatric, 
cognitive, and functional declines.1,2 Concerted research has focused on characterizing 
sensitive biological and neuropsychological markers of AD at the preclinical stage, prior to 
the onset of mild cognitive impairment, to identify high-risk individuals for secondary 
prevention trials.1,3,4 At the same time, there has been less attention to late-life emotional 
and behavioral changes (known as neuropsychiatric symptoms) in preclinical AD and their 
association with AD biomarkers in at-risk, cognitively normal older people. Although

 neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and irritability are known to predict 
progression from normal cognition to prodromal AD,2,5 their pathological correlates are not 
yet defined. Furthermore, relatively little is known of the range of emotional and behavioral 
changes that are part of the natural history of preclinical AD.
Loneliness is a perceived state of social and emotional isolation that has been associated 
with cognitive6–10 and functional11 decline and an increased risk of incident AD dementia.6 
As such, loneliness may be a sensitive clinical marker of pathological brain changes in older 
people. Importantly, loneliness is a specific construct that can be reliably measured and 
distinguished from depression, anxiety, and objective social isolation through the use of 
well-established instruments.12,13 In community-dwelling elderly persons, loneliness has 
been prospectively associated with declines in delayed recall, adjusting for 
sociodemographic factors, depression, and social isolation over 4 years,9 with worsening 
memory performance over 12 years, independent of demographics, medical burden, social 
network, and baseline depression,10 and with increased progression to AD dementia over 4 
years in models adjusting for demographics, premorbid intelligence, depression, social 
network, vascular health, and levels of social, cognitive, and physical activity.6 Thus, while 
loneliness may accompany depression,14 interpersonal loss,15 or objective isolation,16 we 
hypothesized that late-life loneliness might also have a distinct role as a prototypical 
symptom of AD-related molecular pathologies beginning in preclinical AD.
The current research model of preclinical AD describes a pathological process that begins 
with a prolonged stage of cerebral amyloidosis, detectable with established positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques,17 followed by a neurodegenerative stage 
defined by tau aggregation and propagation as well as progressive amyloidoisis.3,18,19 Early 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in the form of subtle alterations in socioemotional perception or 
regulation, such as loneliness, may be measurable in association with amyloidosis and/or 
early pathological tau aggregation in older people before the onset of mild cognitive 
impairment. The genetic risk factor apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOEε4) may also influence early 
neuropsychiatric symptom expression; it has been shown to modify amyloid-related 
mechanisms involved in memory decline17 and to promote disease progression20 at the 
preclinical stage.
The aim of the present study is to examine the cross-sectional association of in vivo 
measurements of cortical amyloid burden with loneliness in an ongoing, observational 
cohort of cognitively normal older adults that includes a subset of individuals with high 
cortical amyloid burden characteristic of preclinical AD. We hypothesized that higher 
amyloid burden would predict greater loneliness, after controlling for age, sex, APOEε4 
carrier status, and potential confounders such as anxiety, depression, social network, and 
socioeconomic status.

 Findings
In a cross-sectional study of 79 community-dwelling older adults, higher brain amyloid 
burden was associated with more frequent feelings of isolation, being left out, and 
lacking companionship, independent of sociodemographic factors, objective measures of 
social network, depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Meaning
Loneliness, characterized by subtle feelings of social detachment, may be associated with 
early brain changes in preclinical Alzheimer disease, prior to mild cognitive impairment.
Methods
Participants
The sample was a subset of participants returning for year 4 assessments as part of the 
Harvard Aging Brain Study, an ongoing, observational study of older adult volunteers aimed 
at defining neurobiological changes in the early AD pathway and other trajectories of 
cognitive aging. The Partners Human Research Committee approved this study, and all 
participants provided written informed consent.
Participants were English-speaking, community-dwelling men and women who were 
cognitively normal, aged between 65 and 90 years, and free from active, major psychiatric 
disorders when originally enrolled in the cohort (eAppendix in the Supplement).21 For this 
study, data were obtained from 79 participants undergoing year 4 assessments that included 
specialized instruments for loneliness, anxiety, and social network characteristics. All 
participants in this study were cognitively normal based on Clinical Dementia Rating22 
global score 0 and education-adjusted performance for the Wechsler Logical Memory 
subtest and the Mini-Mental State Examination.23
Clinical Measures
Loneliness was measured using the 3-itemversion of the UCLA Loneliness Scale, a 
validated, self-rated instrument that has been implemented in numerous epidemiologic 
studies of aging (eAppendix in the Supplement).9,11,13,24 Study participants were asked the 
following 3 questions: “How often do you feel you lack companionship?” “How often do 
you feel left out?” “How often do you feel isolated from others?” Each question was scored 
on a 4-point scale: 1, never; 2, rarely; 3, sometimes; or 4, often. The total score was the sum 
of the 3 answers (possible range, 3–12, with higher score indicating greater loneliness). 
Loneliness ratings were completed in a blinded fashion with regard to other assessments and 
procedures.
Seven items corresponding to anxiety symptoms from the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS)25 were used to calculate an anxiety score; each statement was 
rated for frequency (range, 0–3), with higher score indicating greater anxiety (total score 
possible range, 0–21). Self-reported depression was calculated as the total score from the 30-
item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)26 (item score, 0–1; total score, 0–30; higher score 
indicates greater severity).26 A social network score27–30 and a social activity score6,31 were

 calculated from questions probing numbers and types of social ties and frequency of social 
contacts from established epidemiological surveys.28,31 The social network score was 
calculated as the sum of 4 binary domain scores based on whether or not the study 
participant was (1) married or living with a partner; (2) had, in total, 3 or more friends, 
children, or other relatives who visited monthly; (3) was a member of a community group; 
and (4) was a participant in religious services or activities (possible range, 0–4, with higher 
score indicating greater network). A separate measure of social activity was calculated as the 
total number of children, other relatives, and friends who visited monthly or more (range, 0–
36 in the sample).
Based on APOEε4 genotype, participants were classified as either APOEε4 carriers or 
noncarriers. In addition, a Hollingshead score was calculated according to primary 
occupation and educational attainment (range, 11–65 in the sample, with higher score 
indicating lower socioeconomic status).32
Pittsburgh Compound B–PET Data
Fibrillar amyloid burden was measured using the Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET criteria 
according to established protocols at the Massachusetts General Hospital PET facility.33–36 
PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) was calculated for an aggregate of cortical regions 
including frontal, lateral temporal and lateral, and medial parietal regions, a summary 
measure used in prior studies.36,37 The primary analyses used a continuous measure of PiB 
retention, whereas a dichotomous PiB variable was used in secondary models. Using the 
aggregate PiB DVR value, a dichotomous amyloid variable was defined by a Gaussian 
mixture modeling approach in which high-amyloid (amyloid-positive) or low-amyloid 
(amyloid-negative) groups were based on a PiB DVR cutoff value of 1.2, as previously 
published.17
Statistical Analysis
Unadjusted associations between loneliness and the continuous predictor terms, and 
associations among these predictors, were evaluated using Pearson correlations.
In the first of 3 multiple linear regression models, we examined the cross-sectional 
association of cortical amyloid burden, as a continuous variable (PiB), with UCLA 
loneliness score (UCLA-loneliness), adjusting for age, sex, and APOEε4 carrier status 
(model 1). Building on model 1, we then estimated the association of PiB with UCLA-
loneliness, adjusting for the original set of predictors as well as Hollingshead score, levels of 
depression (GDS) and anxiety (HADS-anxiety) symptoms, and social network score (model 
2). Neuropsychiatric and psychosocial explanatory variables and potential confounders were 
included in the second analysis, as in prior research on loneliness,6,16 to closely define the 
unique association between amyloid burden and loneliness.
In a third analysis (model 3), we tested whether APOEe4 modifies the association between 
PiB and UCLA-loneliness by repeating model 2 but including an additional term for the 
multiplicative interaction of APOEε4 and PiB.

 For linear regression models, we reported unstandardized coefficient estimates (β) and 
standardized estimates with confidence intervals (CI), significance test results (P values), 
and percent variance accounted for by the model as a whole, adjusted for the degrees of 
freedom (adjusted R2). Residuals from the final models were examined to ensure that their 
distributions reasonably satisfied model assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.
For secondary logistic models, the significance test for the overall model was a likelihood 
ratio test, and significance tests for individual predictors and 95%CIs for odds ratios (ORs) 
were based on a Wald χ2 test.
Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and SPSS 23 (IBM) 
statistical software.
Results
Demographic, clinical, and imaging data are reported in Table 1. The mean score for UCLA-
loneliness was 5.3 (range for participants, 3–10; possible range, 3–12). Nineteen percent of 
the sample (n=15) endorsed feelings of lacking companionship sometimes or often, while 
19% (n=15) reported feeling left out sometimes or often, and 14% (n=11) felt isolated from 
others sometimes or often. Often, the highest rating for these items, was endorsed a total of 3 
times in the sample (once for each item), each by a different participant. The individual 
UCLA-loneliness items were moderately correlated with each other (r = 0.5 for all pairs; P 
< .001), consistent with inter-item correlations reported elsewhere.13 All 3 items were 
correlated with the UCLA-loneliness total score (r = 0.8; P < .001).
There was an unadjusted association of UCLA-loneliness score with PiB (r = 0.3; P = .03), 
age (r = −0.2; P = .04), GDS (r = 0.3; P = .005), and HADS-anxiety scores (r = 0.3; P = .01) 
but not with Hollingshead score or measures of social network or social activity. In addition 
to its unadjusted association with loneliness, PiB was also correlated with HADS-anxiety 
score (r = 0.2; P = .04) but not with GDS score (r = −0.0003; P = .90). Only 6 participants 
(8%) exceeded the GDS cutoff for mild depression (>11), and 5 participants (6%) exceeded 
the HADS-anxiety threshold for mild anxiety (>8).
Association of Amyloid Burden With Loneliness
We found that higher PiB was associated with greater UCLA-loneliness, adjusting for age, 
sex, and APOEε4 carrier status (for PiB, β = 3.0 and P = .005; for the model, adjusted R2 = 
0.11 and P = .01). Age, but not sex or APOEε4, was also significantly associated in the 
model (for age, β = −0.09 and P = .02). We also found that higher PiB was associated with 
greater UCLA-loneliness, in the second model, adjusting for the full complement of 
explanatory variables and potential confounders, and the model as a whole was significant 
(see Table 2 and Figure for supporting data). Other factors significantly associated with 
UCLA-loneliness were higher GDS score and younger age (Table 2), findings consistent 
with those of prior research.14,24 Results of model 2 were unchanged when the analysis was 
repeated with the social network score replaced by the measure of social activity or by 
dichotomous variables relating to being married or partnered or being a widow or widower.

 To enhance interpretability of the associations between PiB and UCLA-loneliness, we used 
logistic regression models to evaluate the association of higher PiB (as a continuous 
measure) or greater amyloid burden with being lonely rather than non-lonely. Those 
participants who endorsed any of the 3 UCLA-loneliness items as present sometimes or 
often were classified as lonely, a group that made up 32% of the sample (n = 25).
Modeling amyloid burden as a continuous variable and adjusting for the full set of covariates 
as in model 2, we found that higher PiB was significantly associated with being lonely. For 
each interval change of 0.1 DVR of PiB, there was a 75%increased odds of being lonely 
rather than nonlonely: for 0.1 DVR PiB, OR, 1.75 (95%CI, 1.2–2.5); P = .003; for the 
model, P < .001. Comparing the amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative groups, we found 
that individuals in the amyloid-positive group had 7.5 times higher odds of being lonely vs 
nonlonely than those in the amyloid-negative group: amyloid-positive, OR, 7.5 (95% CI, 
1.7–34.0); P = .01); model, P = .002. In a simplified model controlling only for age, the OR 
for being lonely in the amyloid-positive vs the amyloid-negative group was 3.1 (95%CI, 
1.01–9.5), P = .04; for the model, P = .01.
Supplemental data regarding vascular health, health behaviors, and psychiatric 
characteristics are reported in the eTable in the Supplement, and additional secondary 
analyses were performed (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Interaction of PiB and APOEε4 Status in Association With UCLA-Loneliness
We further evaluated whether the association of PiB to UCLA-loneliness was modified by 
APOEε4 status, controlling for age, sex, Hollingshead score, GDS, HADS-anxiety, and 
social network score. We found that the association of PiB with UCLA-loneliness was 
greater in the APOEε4 carriers than in noncarriers (Table 3). For each 0.1 DVR of PiB, the 
mean UCLA-loneliness score was increased by an additional 0.5 units in APOEε4 carriers 
vs noncarriers.
Discussion
In a community-based sample of cognitively normal older people, we found that higher in 
vivo cortical amyloid burden was associated with greater feelings of loneliness, suggesting 
that loneliness is a novel neuropsychiatric symptom in preclinical AD. Amyloid-positive 
individuals were 7.5 times more likely than amyloid-negative persons to endorse any 
loneliness item sometimes or often. In addition, the association of amyloid burden and 
loneliness was stronger in carriers of the AD genetic risk factor APOEε4 than in noncarriers, 
further strengthening the link between AD pathophysiology and loneliness.
These results reveal that the distinct construct of loneliness may be a symptom of amyloid 
accumulation. Feelings of isolation, lacking companionship, or being left out were endorsed 
as sometimes present by 14% (n=11) to 19% (n=15) of our participants, a few of whom 
reported frequent loneliness or elevated depression. Importantly, our analyses controlled for 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and for objective measures of social connection. 
Therefore, relatively subtle, self-reported feelings of social detachment may be among the 
first symptoms of brain changes due to AD prior to the stage of mild cognitive impairment.

 Loneliness or other subtle impairments in social-emotional perception or behavior could 
arise in preclinical AD due to amyloid-related alterations in neural activity at a local or 
network level. In young adults, loneliness has been associated with smaller gray matter 
volume in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus, a key area involved in sensory 
processing and social perception.38 This area of the brain has multiple connections with 
limbic, frontal, and parietal structures including the amygdala and regions of the default 
mode network involved in social cognition and emotional regulation.39,40 Functional 
neuroimaging studies of grieving persons have shown that the posterior cingulate cortex, a 
major node of the default mode network, is coactivated in response to grief-related 
photographs and words and may be important in regulating other emotional and cognitive 
inputs to mediate adaptive behavioral responses.41–45
It is also possible that the subjective experience of loneliness or detachment may promote 
amyloid accumulation, or there may be dynamic and reciprocal effects over time. Numerous 
epidemiological studies have established that antecedent social and psychosocial factors, 
including loneliness, are related to adverse outcomes such as depression, cognitive decline, 
functional impairment, and earlier mortality in older people.11,16,46–48 Social 
disengagement, manifesting as low numbers of social ties, contacts, and group activities, has 
been associated with cognitive decline in population-based studies of older people, even in 
those individuals with relatively high baseline cognitive and functional status.46,47 Many 
studies have also found independent effects on long-term cognition for more qualitative 
social and socioemotional constructs such as emotional support,47 negative social 
interactions,49 and loneliness.6,9 Within this body of work, loneliness has been viewed as a 
marker of psychosocial stress, closely related to depression,50 bereavement,15 and other 
experiences of social disconnection,51,52 with downstream effects on neural networks and 
systemic health, mediated by stress-related53–55 and inflammatory processes.56,57 
Examining a relatively healthy, older-age sample, we found that measures of depressive 
symptoms and amyloid burden were each strongly and independently associated with 
loneliness, which may indicate that there are dissociable dimensions and pathological 
mechanisms involved in loneliness in aging adults.
Loneliness has rarely been examined as a potential outcome of neurobiological changes due 
to cognitive disorders such as AD.6 A large clinical-pathological cohort study of 
nondemented elderly participants found that, over the course of 4 years, greater loneliness 
was independently associated with declines in multiple cognitive domains and a doubling of 
the risk of AD dementia.6 Despite this, the researchers found no association of loneliness at 
baseline with density of β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, or cerebral infarctions at 
autopsy (adjusting for age at death, sex, and education), and they concluded that other 
neurobiological mechanisms, possibly linked to depression pathophysiology, may be 
involved.6 While their results point toward loneliness as a factor that potentiates cognitive 
decline and AD, our methods and cross-sectional analyses differed by focusing exclusively 
on in vivo measurements of amyloid in a more select, elderly sample with normal cognition, 
relatively low vascular disease burden, and a low burden of depressive symptoms. In models 
adjusting for depression, anxiety, and social network, our findings provide a snapshot of 
loneliness as a possible stage-specific, social perception strongly related to higher amyloid

 burden in older adults who may also be experiencing subtle cognitive changes in preclinical 
AD.
We also found that the association of higher cortical amyloid burden with greater loneliness 
was stronger in APOEε4 carriers than noncarriers. In addition to its known direct effects on 
amyloid aggregation and clearance,58 the APOEε4 allele may also indirectly affect AD 
pathogenesis and memory decline17 through increased neuroinflammation,59 altered 
neuroenergetics,60,61 or impaired synaptic plasticity.62,63 Future longitudinal studies are 
planned to examine whether APOEε4 influences unidirectional and/or bidirectional 
associations of amyloid burden and loneliness over time. In addition, studies of loneliness in 
association with both amyloid and regional tau burden are ongoing to further validate 
loneliness as an early neuropsychiatric symptom in the preclinical AD staging framework.
Limitations
A limitation of the present study is the demographic profile of the participants, who, on 
average, had high intelligence and educational attainment and limited racial and 
socioeconomic diversity. These characteristics, together with the participants’ more 
favorable mental and physical health, may reduce the external validity of our findings. We 
did not assess personality factors, such as neuroticism, that may share variance with 
loneliness or predictors in these analyses. Importantly, our findings are preliminary. 
Loneliness is commonly associated with loss and depression in older people. In a clinical 
setting, we do not have a method to adjust for these factors for a given individual when 
considering AD risk.
Conclusions
We report a novel association of loneliness and cortical amyloid burden in cognitively 
normal older adults and present evidence for loneliness as a neuropsychiatric symptom 
relevant to preclinical AD. This work will inform new research into the neurobiology of 
loneliness and other socioemotional changes in late life and may enhance early detection and 
intervention research in AD.

 Figure. Cross-sectional Relation of Cortical Amyloid Burden and Loneliness
Multiple linear regression analysis was performed for loneliness, measured by the 3-item 
UCLA-3 Loneliness Scale (higher score indicates greater loneliness), as the dependent 
variable. Evaluated associations included amyloid burden (a continuous aggregate measure 
of cortical amyloid by Pittsburgh Compound B–positron emission tomography [PiB-PET] 
distribution volume ratio [DVR]), age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOEε4) carrier status, 
Hollingshead score, depression, anxiety, and social network score.
