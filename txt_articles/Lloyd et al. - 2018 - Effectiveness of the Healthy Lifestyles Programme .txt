Background Although childhood overweight and obesity prevalence has increased substantially worldwide in the past 
three decades, scarce evidence exists for effective preventive strategies. We aimed to establish whether a school-based 
intervention for children aged 9–10 years would prevent excessive weight gain after 24 months.
Methods This pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of the Healthy Lifestyles Programme (HeLP), a school-
based obesity prevention intervention, was done in 32 schools in southwest England. All state-run primary and junior 
schools in Devon and Plymouth (UK) with enough pupils for at least one year-5 class were eligible. Schools were 
assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated sequence to either intervention or control, stratified by the number of year-5 
classes (one vs more than one) and the proportion of children eligible for free school meals (<19% [the national average] 
vs ≥19%). HeLP was delivered to year-5 children (ages 9–10 years) over 1 year, and included dynamic and interactive 
activities such as physical activity workshops, education sessions delivered by teachers with short homework tasks, 
drama sessions, and setting goals to modify behaviour (with parental support and one-to-one discussions with HeLP 
coordinators). The primary outcome was change in body-mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) between 
baseline and 24 months, analysed in children with BMI data available for both timepoints. This study is registered with 
the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial register, number ISRCTN15811706, and the trial status is 
complete.
Findings Between March 21, 2012, and Sept 30, 2013, 32 eligible schools with 1324 children were recruited, of which 
16 schools (676 children) were randomly assigned to the HeLP intervention and 16 schools (648 children) to control. 
All schools that began the trial completed the intervention, and 1244 children (628 in intervention group and 616 in 
control group) had BMI data at both baseline and 24 months for the primary outcome analysis. Mean BMI SDS was 
0·32 (SD 1·16) at baseline and 0·35 (1·25) at 24 months in the intervention group, and 0·18 (1·14) at baseline and 
0·22 (1·22) at 24 months in the control group. With adjustment for school-level clustering, baseline BMI scores, sex, 
cohort, and number of year-5 classes and socioeconomic status of each school, the mean difference in BMI SDS score 
(intervention–control) at 24 months was –0·02 (95% CI –0·09 to 0·05), p=0·57. One parent reported an adverse event 
related to their child’s eating and activity behaviours, but agreed for the child to continue trial participation after 
discussion with the chief investigator.
Interpretation Despite a theoretically informed and extensively piloted intervention that achieved high levels of 
engagement, follow-up, and fidelity of delivery, we found no effect of the intervention on preventing overweight or 
obesity. Although schools are an ideal setting in which to deliver population-based interventions, school-based 
interventions might not be sufficiently intense to affect both the school and the family environment, and hence the 
weight status of children. Future research should focus on more upstream determinants of obesity and use whole-
systems approaches.

Introduction
Childhood obesity is considered by WHO to be one of 
the most serious public health challenges worldwide 
for the 21st century,1 and research has therefore largely 
focused 
on 
preventive 
approaches. 
The 
UK 
Government2 views schools as central to tackling the 
obesity crisis because they are an ideal setting in which 
to actively engage children and their families across the 
socioeconomic spectrum to improve diet and physical 
activity behaviours. In 2017, the Government has 
pledged to invest the revenue from the sugar levy (a tax 
on sugar-sweetened beverages) into school-based 
programmes to encourage physical activity and 
balanced diets.3
However, findings from systematic reviews4,5 showed 
that the effectiveness of school-based obesity pre-
vention programmes is inconclusive and contradictory: 
interventions are highly heterogeneous in design and

most studies have methodological weaknesses, such as 
insufficient statistical power, high levels of attrition, 
differential uptake and follow-up, and only short-term 
follow-up (12 months on average).4–6
In line with WHO’s Health Promoting Schools 
framework,7 we developed the Healthy Lifestyles Pro-
gramme (HeLP), consisting of activities that were 
compatible with the English national school curriculum 
and promoting messages in a manner that could affect 
both the wider school culture and specific behaviours of 
children and their families. The objective of this trial was 
to ascertain whether HeLP was effective in preventing 
childhood obesity.
Methods
Study design
This two-arm, pragmatic, school-based, cluster random-
ised controlled trial with masked outcome assessment 
was done in 32 schools in the southwest of England. 
Ethics approval was given by the Peninsula College of 
Medicine and Dentistry Research Ethics Committee 
(reference number 12/03/140), and research governance 
approval by the Royal Devon and Exeter National Health 
Service Trust (study number 1304762). The full trial 
protocol has been published8 and is also available online.
Participants
All state-run primary and junior schools in Devon and 
Plymouth (UK) with enough pupils for at least one year-5 
class (children aged 9–10 years) were eligible. Schools for 
children whose additional needs cannot be met in a 
mainstream setting were excluded because they were 
unlikely to be teaching the standard national curriculum, 
around which the intervention had been designed. 
Schools willing to participate and fulfilling the inclusion 
criteria were then purposefully sampled by JL and KW to 
represent a range of school sizes (one to three year-5 
classes), locations (urban and rural), and socioeconomic 
status (<19% and ≥19% of children eligible for free school 
meals). We aimed to have half of the schools in the trial 
with at least the national average proportion of pupils 
eligible for free schools meals (19% at the time of 
recruitment of schools). Before randomisation, head 
teachers from all schools gave written informed consent. 
To accommodate the logistics and personnel re-
quired for delivering the week-long drama component 
of the intervention to each year-5 class, the trial ran 
across two cohorts (cohort 1 commenced the trial in 
September, 2012, and cohort 2 in September, 2013). 
Schools that were eligible but not sampled for the trial 
were asked if they were prepared to go on a waiting list, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before the Healthy Lifestyles Programme (HeLP) was designed, a 
2005 Cochrane systematic review recommended that 
interventions to prevent childhood obesity should have a 
rigorous assessment design that enables sufficiently powered 
analysis of what is working or not and for whom the 
intervention is working, and that stakeholders should be 
included in the development of the programme. A 2009 
Cochrane systematic review of school-based obesity prevention 
interventions was unable to make definitive conclusions 
because studies were heterogeneous and only five of 38 studies 
followed up participants for more than 12 months. In 2011, a 
meta-analysis of 27 studies aiming to prevent obesity in 
children aged 6–12 years found some evidence for the 
effectiveness of combined diet and physical activity 
interventions; policies and strategies that appeared to be 
promising included providing support for teachers to 
implement health promotion strategies and activities in 
schools, and parental support that encourages healthy 
behaviour in children. In 2015, a review of childhood obesity 
prevention studies showed a moderate strength of evidence to 
support the effectiveness of school-based interventions. The 
Active for Life Year 5 (AfLY5) cluster randomised controlled trial 
tested a school-based intervention for children aged 9–10 years. 
The programme included lessons and child–parent interactive 
homework plans and was adapted from the American Planet 
Health Programme. No effect on weight status or on objectively 
measured physical activity or diet was found at 12 months.
Added value of this study
HeLP was developed using an intervention mapping approach 
involving relevant behaviour change theories, best available 
evidence, and extensive involvement of teachers, head 
teachers, families, and children. To our knowledge, our study is 
the most comprehensive obesity prevention trial to date, 
involving a large, nationally representative sample of children 
aged 9–10 years and using prespecified standard methods for 
randomisation and analysis. The HeLP intervention was 
delivered with a high degree of fidelity and engaged more than 
90% of children and 75% of their families. The evidence from 
this study therefore has internal validity and is potentially 
widely applicable.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results highlight the tension facing childhood obesity 
prevention programmes, because schools are an ideal setting in 
which to deliver population-based interventions. However, 
taking into account the inconclusive evidence from the most 
recent systematic reviews and the results from both ours and 
the AfLY5 trial, we believe that individually focused 
school-based interventions targeting a single age group are 
unlikely to be sufficiently intense or family focused to affect the 
weight status of children. Future research should focus on more 
upstream determinants of obesity and use whole-systems 
approaches.

in case any of the schools allocated to participate in 
cohort 2 dropped out during the interim 1-year period 
before commencing participation.
All children in all year-5 classes within each recruited 
school were invited to participate, and their parents or 
carers could choose to opt their child out before baseline 
measurements were taken (full details in protocol).8 All 
children who were on the registration list at one of the 
recruited schools at the start of the autumn term 2012 
(for cohort 1) or 2013 (for cohort 2), and whose parents or 
carers did not complete an opt-out form, were classed as 
participants.
Randomisation and masking
The trial manager (JL) was responsible for recruiting 
schools via the Devon Association of Primary School 
Heads and local primary school learning community 
meetings. Schools were randomly allocated (1:1) to the 
intervention or control group using a computer-
generated sequence using two school-level stratification 
factors: one versus more than one year-5 class and the 
proportion of children eligible for free school meals 
(<19% vs ≥19%). Randomisation was done by a statistician 
(RST) in the UK Clinical Research Collaboration-
registered Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit immediately 
after all schools had been recruited in 2012, but each 
school’s allocated group (intervention or control) was not 
communicated to the schools, parents, or researchers 
until after baseline measurements had been taken. RST 
ensured that numbers of control and inter 
vention 
schools were equal in both cohorts to facilitate trial 
delivery.
Because of the nature of the intervention, school staff, 
children, and individuals delivering the intervention 
could not be masked to group allocation. Anthropometric 
measures at 18 and 24 months were collected by inde-
pendent, masked, trained assessors who were not 
involved in the trial. We made a timeline cluster diagram 
for the trial to show the masking procedures for each 
measure at each timepoint (appendix). At the 24-month 
primary endpoint, when secondary schools contained a 
mixture of children from intervention and control 
primary schools, an assessment of the fidelity of assessor 
masking was made to ascertain whether a child had 
revealed their group allocation during the measurement 
process. If the child had revealed their group allocation 
in any way then this was recorded by the assessor.
Procedures
In schools assigned to the intervention group, HeLP was 
delivered to year-5 children (ages 9–10 years) over three 
school terms (roughly 12 weeks per term). HeLP consisted 
of four phases, which were ordered to enable and support 
behaviour change by targeting school and family 
environments and giving children the strategies and 
motivation to improve their snacking and activity-related 
behaviours (panel). Findings from the first pilot of the 
intervention9 (delivered to children aged 8–11 years, school 
years 4–6) showed that year-5 children were most receptive 
to the healthy lifestyle messages and engaged their parents 
to the greatest extent. Also, the school could more feasibly 
run the HeLP activities in year 5 than year 6, when the 
curriculum focused on standard assessment tasks. As a 
result, the intervention was targeted at students in year 5, 
while also trying to affect the wider school environment.9 
The programme delivered a general healthy lifestyle 
message with a focus on behaviours such as the 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, healthy and 
unhealthy snacking, physical activity, and reducing screen 
time. An overarching message promoted was the 
80/20 rule, which recommended eating healthily and 
being active at least 80% of the time. HeLP was designed 
to fit in with the national curriculum at key stage 2, and all 
lessons and drama sessions included learning objectives 
Panel: Summary of intervention phases
Phase 1: creating a supportive context (spring term of year 5)
The aim is to establish relationships between all stakeholders (ie, head teachers, teachers, 
support staff, children, and parents) and raise awareness of the programme. Professional 
sports people and dancers run practical workshops and introduce the importance of 
healthy lifestyles to create a buzz in the school and set a positive atmosphere for future 
activities. At the end of this phase, children showcase the skills they have learnt in a 
parent assembly, in which parents are given further information about the programme by 
the Healthy Lifestyles Pro 
gramme (HeLP) coordinator.
Phase 2: intensive healthy lifestyle week (summer term of year 5)
Education lessons are delivered by the class teacher each morning and interactive drama 
activities by a local drama group every afternoon during the week. Short and simple 
homework tasks are given at the end of each session for the children to complete in time 
for the next session. The drama framework is built around four characters (Disorganised 
Duncan, Football Freddie, Snacky Sam, and Active Amy), each represented by an actor, 
whose attributes relate to the three key programme behaviours (reducing unhealthy 
snacking, increasing physical activity, and reducing sedentary activities). Children are 
asked to choose the character they felt they most resemble and, throughout the week, 
work closely with that actor to help the character change their behaviour. These sessions 
are dynamic and interactive and involve role play, games, dance, problem solving, food 
tasting, and forum theatre. The themes for each lesson and drama session are as follows: 
energy in and out, overcoming temptation, decision making and responsibility, food 
marketing, and goal setting.
Phase 3: personal goal setting with parental support (summer term of year 5)
Children are encouraged to reflect on their own behaviours and set goals (based on the 
HeLP messages) with their parents. After reflection with parents, each child has a 10-min 
one-to-one goal-setting discussion with a HeLP coordinator. A sheet with each child’s 
goals and the name and attributes of the character the child worked with is sent directly 
home to parents and a copy is also kept at school in the children’s healthy lifestyles folder.
Phase 4: reinforcement activities (autumn term of year 6)
A range of components were used to refocus the children and their parents on the HeLP 
messages and behaviour change strategies. This phase includes a further lesson led by the 
class teacher, a drama workshop delivered by the actors, an assembly delivered by the class 
to the whole school about the programme, and a second one-to-one goal discussion with 
a HeLP coordinator.

relating to personal social and health education, science, 
numeracy, and literacy (see further details in the 
appendix). The development, content, and theoretical 
underpinning of the intervention have been published 
previously.10
One year-5 class per school had their physical activity 
levels assessed using accelerometers. If a school had 
more than one year-5 class, a computer-generated 
sequence was used to randomly select one class. Children 
were asked to wear a waterproof triaxial accelerometer 
continuously (including at night) for 8 consecutive days 
on the wrist of their non-dominant arm.
Schools assigned to the control group continued 
standard education provision throughout their partici-
pation in the trial, and had no access to any of the HeLP 
resources and scripts, which have not been published 
and were not made available by the research team beyond 
the intervention schools. Control schools each received 
£1000 for their participation following the collection of 
18-month data.
Baseline assessments were done in the autumn term 
of school year 5 between October and November (2012 for 
cohort 1 and 2013 for cohort 2). Delivery of the inter-
vention began the following term (January, 2013, for 
cohort 1 and January, 2014, for cohort 2). Follow-up 
outcome measures were taken at 18 and 24 months after 
baseline. All measurements were taken at school during 
the school day. Fidelity of intervention delivery was 
assessed in relation to both content and the quality of 
delivery (appendix).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the change in body-mass 
index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) between 
baseline and 24-month follow-up. BMI was calculated 
and converted to centiles using the LMS method for 
constructing normalised growth standards.11 Categori-
sations of underweight, normal, overweight, or obese 
were based on the definitions from Cole and 
colleagues.12
Secondary outcomes were BMI SDS at 18 months; 
the percentage of children classified as underweight, 
healthy weight, overweight, and obese at 18 and 24 months; 
waist circumference SDS at 18 and 24 months; percentage 
body fat SDS at 18 and 24 months; physical activity 
measured using accelerometry at 18 months; and self-
reported scores for the number of different types of 
energy-dense snacks, healthy snacks, healthy foods 
(positive food markers), and unhealthy foods (negative 
food markers) consumed per day using the validated Food 
Intake Questionnaire (FIQ)13 at 18 months (appendix).
Details of methods of data collection for the 
anthropometric and behavioural measures are in the 
appendix. An adverse event was considered to include 
unusual dieting or physical activity  behaviours or 
noticeable weight loss. Any adverse event could be reported 
by school staff, parents, HeLP coordinators, or actors.
Statistical analysis
Our sample size calculation assumed a mean of 35 children 
aged 9–10 years per school, with coefficient of variance of 
0·5 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0·02. To 
have 90% power, with a two-sided 5% significance level, to 
detect a between-group difference in BMI SDS of 0·25 units 
at 24 months, assuming an SD of 1·3 and adjusting for 
baseline BMI SDS (assumed within-child correlation of 
0·8), we needed to have 24-month outcome data from at 
least 762 children. Allowing for up to 20% loss to follow-up, 
we aimed to recruit 28 schools with at least 952 children.
The primary analyses were done in children with BMI 
data available for both baseline the 24-month follow-up 
by a statistician masked to the allocated group. Because 
of the high levels of completeness of data and low 
proportion of children categorised as non-compliers, the 
multiple imputation approach for handling missing 
outcome data was replaced by a best-case and worst-case 
scenario, and the planned complier average causal effect 
analyses were dropped.14
All comparative analyses allowed for the clustering of 
children within schools15 using a likelihood-based 
random-effects regression modelling approach that uses 
all available data and provides valid estimates of the effect 
of the intervention, when data are assumed to be missing 
at random. Most of the outcomes were of a continuous 
nature and thus linear models were fitted. Weight status 
was analysed using a random-effects ordinal logistic 
regression model with three categories (underweight or 
healthy weight, overweight, and obese) and a random-
effects logistic regression model with two categories 
(underweight or healthy weight and overweight or 
obese); for simplicity, only the results of the logistic 
regression models are reported here.
All primary comparative analyses were adjusted for the 
two school-level stratification factors (proportion of chil-
dren eligible for free school meals and number of year-5 
classes), cohort, sex, and the baseline values for the 
outcome under consideration, when available. Adjusted 
between-group mean differences (intervention minus 
control) and odds ratios (intervention vs control), with 
corresponding 95% CIs, were calculated for all outcomes. 
p values are two sided and were considered significant at 
0·05 or less. Between-group differences with adjustment 
only for clustering are given for completeness.15 The 
intraclass correlation coefficient (with 95% CI) from the 
random-effects regression models are reported for all 
outcomes.
Additional preplanned exploratory subgroup analyses 
were done to assess whether any effect of the HeLP 
intervention on the primary outcome was modified by 
sex, baseline BMI SDS, number of year-5 classes within a 
school, child-level socioeconomic status, or trial entry 
time (ie, cohort effect). We also fitted a repeated measures 
model to all the BMI SDS data at baseline, 18 months, 
and 24 months, including effects of time and the 
interaction term between allocated group and time, to

assess whether the effect of the intervention differed over 
time.
For the physical activity analysis, children were included 
if they had data on at least three weekdays and one 
weekend day, each with a minimum of 10 h per day.16 In 
the analyses, non-wear of the accelerometer was 
established by at least two accelerometer axes with an SD 
less than 13 mg and a range less than 50 mg over a 60-min 
period, 
using 
moving 
increments 
of 
15 
mins.17 
Accelerometers were set to record at 85·7 Hz and data 
were downloaded using GeneActiv PC software, version 1.4, 
and analysed using the GGIR software package for R.
We also did parallel economic and process analyses 
(see analysis plan in the protocol), which will be reported 
separately. A detailed statistical analysis plan has been 
published.14 All analyses were done in Stata, version 14.0, 
unless otherwise stated.

Results
Between March 21, 2012, and Sept 30, 2013, 36 eligible 
schools were identified, of which four were placed on the 
waiting list. We recruited 32 schools with 1371 eligible 
children, of whom 1324 participated in the study (figure 1). 
16 schools (676 children) were assigned to the intervention 
group and 16 schools (648 children) to the control group. 
We compared characteristics of the primary schools in 
the HeLP trial with other primary schools in Devon and 
England (appendix p 2). HeLP schools had a similar 
average number of pupils, deprivation, and academic 
achievement to English schools; however, the proportion 
of pupils with English as a second language was 
significantly lower than the national average (4·1% in 
HeLP schools vs 16·8% in all schools in England), 
although it was nearly double the proportion in Devon 
schools as a whole, which is 2·6%. The intervention and 
control groups had similar school-level and child-level 
baseline characteristics, including physical activity and 
food intake questionnaire scores (table 1). At baseline, 
although anthropometric measurements between the 
groups were largely similar, a greater proportion of 
children in the intervention group were overweight or 
obese than in the control group (table 1).
All 32 schools completed the trial. All schools in the 
intervention group completed or nearly completed the 
whole programme and the quality of delivery in all 
schools was at or above the established appropriate level 
(appendix). 629 (93%) of the 676 children in the inter-
vention group were categorised as compliers (ie, they 
received at least four of the five drama sessions and the 
one-to-one goal-setting discussion in phase 3). No not-
able differences in uptake were seen between the 
two cohorts (appendix). 353 (52%) of the 676 children

had family attending at least one parent event and 
652 (96%) children set goals with the HeLP coordinator 
in phase 3. 411 (63%) of these 652 children had parental 
support, shown by a parent signature on the goal-setting 
sheet or written comments about how the parent would 
support the child in achieving their goals.
1244 children were included in the primary analysis of 
BMI SDS because both baseline and 24-month BMI data 
were available for them (figure 1). In the measurement 
training sessions before anthropometric measures were 
taken, inter-rater reliability for height and waist circum-
ference was high (coefficients of variations were, 
respectively, 0·2% and 1·3% at baseline, 0·1% and 1·2% 
at 18 months, and 0·1% and 0·4% at 24 months). No child 
had reported his or her allocated group to the masked 
assessor at 24-month follow-up. Of the 886 children who 
wore accelerometers, 851 (96%) had usable physical 
activity data files (ie, files could be downloaded and were 
not corrupted) at baseline and 788 (89%) had usable data 
at 18 months; similarly, the number of children with valid 
physical activity data after the application of the minimum 
wear requirements (three weekdays and one weekend day 
with a minimum of 10 h of wear time per day) was 
830 (94%) at baseline and 745 (84%) at 18 months. 701 
(79%) of the 886 children achieved the full 7 days of 10 h 
wear time per day. No evidence suggested differences 
between the groups in terms of the com 
pleteness of 
outcome measures throughout the trial, although more 
children in the intervention group were lost to follow-up 
than in the control group (figure 1). No differences were 
noted between control and intervention schools at either 
baseline or 18 months in terms of the number and type of 
school nutrition and physical activity policies they had in 
place (data not shown).
Mean BMI SDS at 24 months was 0·35 (SD 1·25) in 
children in the intervention group and 0·22 (1·22) in 
those in the control group (table 2). With adjustment for 
school-level clustering, baseline BMI scores, sex, cohort, 
and number of year-5 classes and socioeconomic status 
of each school, the mean difference in BMI SDS score 
(intervention–control) at 24 months was –0·02 (95% CI 
–0·09 to 0·05, p=0.57).
According to the repeated measures model, no 
significant difference in mean BMI SDS existed between 
the two allocated groups at baseline (0·30 [95% CI 0·18 
to 0·41] in the intervention group and 0·18 [0·06 to 0·30] 
in the control group, p=0·17; figure 2). The BMI 
SDS predicted by the model was 0·30 (95% CI 0·18 to 
0·41) in the intervention group and 0·21 (0·09 to 0·33) 
in the control group at 18 months, increasing to 0·33 
(0·21 to 0·45) in the intervention group and 0·23 (95% 
CI 0·11 to 0·35) in the control group by 24 months 
(figure 2). The sensitivity analyses to explore assumptions 
about missing primary outcome data produced results 
that were consistent with the primary analysis (appendix). 
We found no evidence that the intervention effect was 
modified in any of the prespecified subgroups (appendix).
No significant differences were seen between the groups 
in any of the other anthropometric outcomes at either 18 or 
24 months (table 2), nor any of the physical activity 
outcomes at 18 months (table 3). The adjusted means of 
FIQ scores (both weekly and weekday) for energy-dense 
snacks and negative food markers were lower in the 
intervention group than in the control group (table 4). The 
discrete values of the weekday and weekend scores, 
bounded by zero, suggested that the assumptions for 
modelling in a linear model might not be fully met, despite 
the apparent symmetrical, normal shape of the data in the 
plots. Therefore, random-effects ordinal logistic regression 
models were also fitted to these outcomes. A positive effect

of the intervention was still seen on the weekday scores for 
energy-dense snacks and negative food markers (data not 
shown); however, the p values are close to 0·05 and the 
difference could be due to chance.
The intraclass correlation coefficient for BMI SDS at 
24 
months 
was 
0·014 
(95% 
CI 
0·003–0·069; 
appendix p 12).
Three children withdrew from the trial (two from the 
control group and one from the intervention group), and 
one adverse event was reported by a concerned parent 
about her child’s eating and activity behaviours 
(overexercising and restricting food intake). After 
discussion with the chief investigator, the parent was 
happy for their child to remain in the study and continue 
to participate in the intervention.
Discussion
The risk of childhood obesity is related to a complex 
interaction of factors at the individual, family, school, and 
societal levels. The HeLP intervention was developed 
using intervention mapping based on previous evidence 
of effective approaches to modifying children’s risk factors 
for obesity and creating supportive school and home 
environments for healthy behaviours; it was extensively 
piloted to ensure acceptability and feas 
ibility.10,19,20 In this 
large school-based cluster randomised controlled trial we 
showed high fidelity to intervention delivery and 
participation by children and families, and successfully 
collected data on 84–96% of children for all outcome 
measures. We found no evidence of an intervention effect 
on the primary outcome of BMI SDS at 24 months, nor on 
any of the objectively measured anthropometric or 
physical activity outcomes. Based on self-report data, there 
was some weak evidence of a small but significant 
difference in favour of the intervention group in the mean 
number of different types of unhealthy snacks (energy 
dense) and unhealthy foods (negative markers) consumed.
Evidence from systematic reviews5,21 suggests that some 
school-based intervention programmes that target physical 
activity and diet and involve activities to engage families 
have a modest effect on weight outcomes; however, the 
reviews identify significant between-study heterogeneity 
and acknowledge that most of the included studies have a 
moderate-to-high risk of bias. The most recent, 
methodologically rigorous, UK trial of a school-based 
intervention aimed at increasing physical activity, reducing 
sedentary behaviour, and increasing fruit and vegetable 
consumption in the same age group as HeLP, the Active 
for Life Year 5 trial,22 reported no difference between 
children in the intervention and control groups in the three 
primary outcomes (accelerometer-assessed moderate to 
vigorous physical activity, accelerometer-assessed sedentary 
activity, self-reported fruit and vegetable servings) or in the 
secondary outcome of weight status at 12 months.
In the HeLP trial, we aimed to address the metho-
dological shortcomings identified in other studies and 
assess an intervention that included the behaviour 
change techniques believed most likely to affect 
identified causal pathways for obesity.23 It also aimed to 
engage children, families, and schools. We specifically 
sought to minimise key sources of bias, including 
recruitment, performance, and detection biases, by 
recruiting schools and children and collecting baseline 
measures before randomisation (to reduce differential 
uptake), capturing evidence of changes in school 
policies around food or physical activity during the trial, 
and using assessors who were masked to group 
allocation to measure the anthropometric outcomes. 
Although the FIQ was completed before revealing group 
allocation at baseline, the children were aware of their 
group allocation at the 18-month and 24-month follow-
ups (appendix p 3). We also recognise that the HeLP 
coordinators collected measurements in both control 
and intervention schools, so contamination in the 
control schools might have occurred. However, the 
interaction between the coordinators and the control 
schools and children was minimal compared with that 
in the intervention schools, so taking the measurements 
probably did not affect obesity-related behaviours of the 
children to any great extent.
Sample size calculations, which allowed for the 
anticipated level of clustering as estimated from the 
exploratory trial and English National Child Measurement 
Programme (NCMP) data,19,24 suggested that the trial 
needed outcome measures from 762 children at 24-month 
follow-up to detect a clinically meaningful difference in 
BMI SDS. However, the larger number of children per

school than that anticipated, as well as successful trial 
recruitment and retention, meant that primary outcome 
data were available for 1250 children. Only a low risk of 
attrition bias existed in the study because few eligible 
children (34 [2%] of 1371) were opted out by their parents 
or carers and we achieved exceptional levels of follow-up 
at both 18 and 24 months for all outcome measures.
Reviews of school-based obesity prevention and obesity 
management trials in children have shown low 
participation, differential dropout, and high loss to follow-
up.5,6,21,25 For example, completeness of anthropometric 
data in school-based obesity prevention programmes has 
ranged from 70% to 80% for follow-up of 24 months or 
more,26–28 and the percentage of children providing a 
representative pattern of their physical activity levels 
across the entire week (at least three weekdays and one 
weekend day of 10 h wear time) tends to be much lower 
(40–60%).16 In the HeLP trial, 84% of children met this 
minimum wear time criteria and 79% provided data on 
7 days, showing one of the most complete follow-ups and

best compliance with physical activity assessment of 
obesity prevention trials in children of this age group. We 
attribute this to the extensive stakeholder involvement in 
the intervention development, trial design and delivery, 
and building of trusting and supportive relationships 
with schools, children, and families.20,29
We weighted school recruitment to achieve a similar 
proportion of pupils eligible to receive free school meals 
as the national average, which is higher than the average 
for Devon (12·7%). 14 (44%) of the 32 participating 
schools had more than 19% pupils eligible for free school 
meals. Participating schools were larger than the average 
primary school in Devon, but in other respects, schools 
were representative of Devon and the anthro 
pometric 
data from the children in the trial were broadly similar to 
the Devon NCMP year-6 data (no county-level data are 
available for year-5 classes because these measurements 
are taken in reception and year 6 only).30 The representative 
sample gives us confidence that the results are likely to be 
applicable to a wider population. We used the proportion 
of children with English as a second language as a proxy 
of ethnicity, and, although the included schools reflect the 
proportion of children from minority ethnic groups 
typical for Devon (6%), this value is substantially lower 
than 
the 
average 
proportion 
in 
England 
(28%; 
appendix 
p 
2).31
We found that a theoretically informed complex 
intervention, which was feasible and acceptable to schools, 
children, and their families and achieved a high level of 
engagement, failed to change diet and physical activity 
behaviours and had no effect on weight status. Schools are 
ideal locations for childhood obesity prevention pro-
grammes given their near-universal reach of children

across the socioeconomic spectrum; however, the capacity 
of such programmes to affect family behaviour patterns is 
poor. Children aged 9 and 10 years spend most of their 
time in either the school or family environment and it was 
these two environments we sought to affect, giving 
children the necessary skills to identify and make healthy 
diet and activity choices and engage their parents in 
supporting these behaviours. We gave the children 
autonomy to select which behaviours they wished to 
change and encouraged their families to identify how they 
would support their child to achieve their goals. However, 
the programme did not affect BMI SDS or physical 
activity, suggesting that we were unsuc 
cessful in our 
overarching aim to affect both the school and family 
environments. Although HeLP used several activities to 
directly engage parents as well as activities to engage other 
year groups within the school, the programme did not 
explicitly seek to affect school policies or physical aspects 
of the school environment. Furthermore, in seeking to 
minimise the burden of delivery for schools, the use of 
external delivery personnel for much of the programme 
might have minimised any effect on school culture. 
However, we think schools are unlikely to find a more 
intensive programme feasible or acceptable to implement.
We believe that these findings, and results from other 
large, rigorous studies, call into question the likelihood 
that individually focused, school-based obesity prevention 
programmes can ever be sufficient to reduce the risks of 
obesity in primary school children. In 2015, The Lancet’s 
second Obesity Series called for an “urgent rethinking of 
the causes, enablers, and barriers to change” by focusing 
on the “reciprocal nature of the interaction between the 
environment and the individual”,32 in which feedback 
loops perpetuate food choices and behaviours. Schools 
have an important role in creating supportive social and 
physical environments; however, unless upstream 
determinants of obesity are also addressed, families are 
unlikely to feel supported or motivated to change their 
behaviours. Such whole-systems approaches to childhood 
obesity prevention are theoretically attractive, but both 
their practical application and evidence for their 
effectiveness are currently absent and will require 
rigorous investigation.
Contributors
KW was the chief investigator. JL, SC, SL, CG, SGD, RST, and KW were 
involved in all stages of the HeLP trial, including conception, design, 
interpretation of data, and in seeking funding. VP, ER, and RT provided 
stakeholder input into the development phases and the trial. JL and KW 
were responsible for the conduct of the study. JL led the development of 
the HeLP intervention, managed the delivery of the trial, and managed 
the HeLP data collection with input from KW and other members of the 
study team. CA and SGD advised on the theoretical design of the 
intervention and the psychological and behavioural measures of change. 
SC wrote the statistical analysis plan, with analyses undertaken by AS 
and SC. MH supervised LP in the management of the physical activity 
data and its preparation for statistical analysis by AS and SC. JL, SC, and 
KW wrote the first draft of this paper and JL coordinated contributions 
from the other coauthors. All authors contributed to the writing and 
critical revision of the manuscript.
