Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths. The expression of the transcription factor C/EBPa (CCAAT/
enhancer binding protein a) is frequently lost in non–small cell lung cancer, but the mechanisms by which C/EBPa
suppresses tumor formation are not fully understood. In addition, no pharmacological therapy is available to
specifically target C/EBPa expression. We discovered a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients in whom
negative/low C/EBPa expression and positive expression of the oncogenic protein BMI1 (B lymphoma Mo-MLV
insertion region 1 homolog) have prognostic value. We also generated a lung-specific mouse model of C/EBPa
deletion that develops lung adenocarcinomas, which are prevented by Bmi1 haploinsufficiency. BMI1 activity is
required for both tumor initiation and maintenance in the C/EBPa-null background, and pharmacological inhibition
of BMI1 exhibits antitumor effects in both murine and human adenocarcinoma lines. Overall, we show that C/EBPa
is a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and that BMI1 is required for the oncogenic process downstream of C/EBPa
loss. Therefore, anti-BMI1 pharmacological inhibition may offer a therapeutic benefit for lung cancer patients with
low expression of C/EBPa and high BMI1.
INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer accounts for 30% of tumor-related deaths (1). Most pa-
tients are refractory to current treatments; therefore, understanding
the mechanisms that control lung tumorigenesis is essential to design
new therapies. One event that frequently occurs in primary non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the lack of expression of the transcription
factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa) by either hyper-
methylation (2) or genetic loss (3). C/EBPa controls tissue-specific
gene expression and promotes proliferation arrest in terminally differ-
entiated cells from several tissues, including pulmonary cells (4). C/
EBPa acts as a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia (4–7),
and it is down-regulated in hepatic carcinogenesis (8), squamous cell
skin carcinomas (9), and squamous cell cancers of the head and neck
(10) and is dysregulated in prostate cancer (11).
C/EBPa knockout mice display perinatal lethality with severe hy-
poglycemia and respiratory distress (12, 13). Lung-specific in utero
loss of C/EBPa results in delayed maturation of the lung, respiratory
arrest, and lethality after birth, caused by epithelial cell expansion and
loss of airspace (14, 15). C/EBPa loss causes lack of differentiation,
hyperproliferation, and increased survival of type II alveolar cells, with
an overall down-regulation of genes involved in differentiation, and
up-regulation of proliferation, tumor progression, and cell survival
genes (14). In addition, induction of C/EBPa expression in human
lung cancer cells resulted in differentiation and growth reduction, at-
tributable to proliferation arrest and apoptosis (16).
The mechanisms by which C/EBPa suppresses tumor formation
are unclear. No pharmacological therapy is available to specifically tar-
get the large subsets of patients with loss of C/EBPa expression.
We hypothesized that C/EBPa could be performing its protective
function by helping to restrain the activity of critical proto-oncogenes.
Similar to what we observed in C/EBPa−/− hematopoietic stem cells
(17), reciprocal expression between C/EBPa and BMI1 (B lymphoma
Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog) also occurs in lung cancer.
Here, we report that more than 80% of C/EBPa-negative/low adeno-
carcinoma patients are positive for the expression of the oncogenic
protein BMI1 and that this expression pattern has prognostic value.

 that inhibits it, we demonstrated that BMI1 has a critical in vivo role
in supporting and maintaining the transformed phenotype of C/
EBPa-null cells, pointing to the therapeutic potential of targeting
BMI1 in C/EBPa-negative/low adenocarcinoma patients.
RESULTS
A subset of C/EBPa-negative/low and BMI1-positive
human adenocarcinomas is amenable to BMI1
pharmacological inhibition
To address the molecular mechanisms by which C/EBPa suppresses
transformation, we analyzed gene expression profile changes of a hu-
man adenocarcinoma cell line (H358) after overexpression of an
inducible form of C/EBPa (16). Upon C/EBPa up-regulation, both
BMI1 mRNA and protein were markedly reduced (Fig. 1A). To inves-
tigate whether C/EBPa performs its tumor-suppressing function by
restraining BMI1 expression, we examined the correlation between
C/EBPa and BMI1 protein amounts in primary lung cancer patient
specimens through immunohistochemistry (IHC). The clinicopatho-
logical information available for the tissue microarray, including diag-
nosis, tumor stage, cancer stage, and lymph node involvement, is
displayed in Table 1 (for adenocarcinoma cases) and table S1 (for
all NSCLC cases, including adenocarcinomas). IHC analysis per-
formed on 261 NSCLC patient tissues demonstrated a range of
BMI1 protein expression (0 to 3+) in different NSCLC subtypes anal-
yzed, as shown in fig. S1 (A to G). The adenocarcinoma cases (69.6%)
were negative/low for C/EBPa expression (0, 1+), as previously de-
scribed (16), and 82.8% of them were positive for BMI1 expression
(1+ to 3+) (Fig. 1B). Examples of adenocarcinoma staining are
presented in Fig. 1C. To investigate whether BMI1 expression corre-
lates with prognosis in lung cancer for patients with negative/low C/
EBPa expression, we compared overall survival in 490 lung adenocar-
cinoma samples available in The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA; lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data set at https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/],
as well as three different publicly available microarray expression data-
bases (18–20), containing data from additional 490 NSCLC patients.
When the 490 TCGA adenocarcinoma patients were stratified
according to absent/low C/EBPa expression, the survival difference be-
tween BMI1low and BMI1high lung cancers was in favor of BMI1low
patients (P = 0.041) (Fig. 1D). All NSCLC microarray cohorts [fig. S2, A
(n = 133, P = 0.044) and B (n = 181, P = 0.038)] showed a difference in
survival between C/EBPa-negative/low BMI1low and BMI1high sub-
groups, except for the Tang et al. study (n = 176) (fig. S2C) (20).
Overall, our data show that more than 80% of C/EBPa-negative/
low adenocarcinomas display positive BMI1 expression and that this
expression pattern has prognostic value. We have thus identified a
molecular subtype of human adenocarcinomas, which may be amena-
ble to BMI1 inhibition therapy.
C/EBPa is a tumor suppressor in lung cancer, and its loss
correlates with increased BMI1 expression
The observation that loss of C/EBPa is a common event in NSCLC
(16) prompted us to study the in vivo consequences of C/EBPa dele-
tion in adult lungs. We used the Clara Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP)
promoter to drive conditional Cre recombinase–induced deletion of
C/EBPa in pulmonary epithelial cells. Doxycycline-treated mice were
referred to as C/EBPaLung-D mice, to indicate their targeted C/EBPa
deletion in lung cells (fig. S3A). Histopathologic analysis showed that
6 to 8 months after doxycycline treatment, ~33% of the C/EBPaLung-D
mice (n = 102) developed pulmonary adenocarcinomas (Fig. 2A, left
panel), whereas no tumorigenesis could be detected in heterozygous
mice (n = 58) (fig. S3B). Although most of the C/EBPaLung-D mice
with tumors showed one lesion per lung, 12% of them displayed
multiple foci per lung (fig. S3C). Pulmonary cells depleted of the hema-
topoietic and endothelial component [lineage-negative (Lin−) cells]
obtained from tumors arising in C/EBPaLung-D mice did not express
detectable amounts of C/EBPa RNA (Fig. 2B). Similarly, IHC staining
confirmed the absence of C/EBPa protein (Fig. 2A, right panel), and
Southern blot assays demonstrated complete excision of the C/EBPa
gene in tumors (Fig. 2C). In summary, lung-specific deletion of C/
EBPa in adult lung epithelium facilitates adenocarcinoma formation,
validating the hypothesis that C/EBPa acts as a pulmonary tumor
suppressor in vivo. Murine primary adenocarcinomas displayed
reciprocal expression between C/EBPa and BMI1 (Fig. 2, D and
E), similarly to human adenocarcinomas. Such a reciprocal gene expres-
sion pattern was recapitulated in a primary C/EBPa-null tumor cell line
derived from the C/EBPaLung-D pulmonary tumors (Fig. 2, D and E),

nocompromised NSG (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immuno-
deficient/interleukin-2 receptor g null) mice (fig. S3D) and to form
multiple pulmonary metastatic foci upon bloodstream injection (fig. S3E).
C/EBPa restrains BMI1 expression
Retroviral introduction of C/EBPa in the murine C/EBPa-null pul-
monary tumor cells was sufficient to decrease both Bmi1 mRNA
(Fig. 3A) and protein expression (Fig. 3B), suggesting that C/EBPa
is involved in Bmi1 gene regulation. Similarly, overexpression of an
inducible form of C/EBPa (16) in the human adenocarcinoma cell
line H358 was able to decrease BMI1 expression by 83%, as com-
pared to the empty vector control (Fig. 1A), suggesting that repres-
sion of BMI1 by C/EBPa is conserved between murine and human
pulmonary cells. Together, these data indicate that C/EBPa nega-
tively affects BMI1 expression in lung cancer cells.
BMI1 is required for lung tumor initiation and maintenance
Next, we asked whether tumor initiation was affected in C/EBPa
conditional lung knockout mice in the context of Bmi1 haploinsuf-
ficiency (Bmi1WT/GFP) (fig. S4A) (21). These mice display a ~50%
reduction in Bmi1 RNA expression in Lin− lung cells, as compared
to Bmi1WT/WT mice (fig. S4B). Upon doxycycline treatment, C/
EBPaLung-D × Bmi1WT/WT mice (n = 26) developed tumors at the

daily for 2 weeks with PTC-209 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle control. Tumor
burden was measured with calipers at the beginning of the pharma-
cological treatment and after 7 and 15 days from initiation of treat-
ment. The figure indicates tumor volume versus time of treatment (in

 expected incidence (34.6%), whereas C/EBPaLung-D animals with re-
duced BMI1 expression (n = 28), as well as control mice (n = 25),
did not develop any tumors (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that decreased
BMI1 expression was sufficient to inhibit tumor formation. To test
whether Bmi1 knockdown was sufficient to also affect tumor growth
in already transformed cells, we performed subcutaneous transplanta-
tion assays in NSG mice. After transduction of the murine C/EBPa-null
pulmonary tumor cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP)–coupled
lentiviral shRNAs against Bmi1 (sh1 and sh2) or a control shRNA
(sh-Luciferase), we verified that Bmi1 RNA (fig. S4C, left panel)
and protein expression (fig. S4C, right panel) was silenced in GFP+
cells. Injection of cells displaying Bmi1 knockdown resulted in the
formation of smaller tumors (Bmi1-sh1 versus control, P = 0.0001;
Bmi1-sh2 versus control, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B), as well as a decreased
percentage of mice with tumors (83.3% of Bmi1-sh1–infected and
66.6% of Bmi1-sh2–infected mice developed tumors, as compared
to 100% of the Luc-sh-control–infected mice). At day 30, tumor
growth was specifically affected in mice injected with Bmi1-sh1–
infected (P = 0.036) or Bmi1-sh2–infected cells (P = 0.033), as com-
pared to sh-Luciferase–infected cells (Fig. 4C). At the time of harvest,
GFP+ tumor cells from both Bmi1-sh1– and Bmi1-sh2–infected cells
maintained reduced Bmi1 expression (fig. S4D). At harvest, tumors
derived from Bmi1-sh1– and Bmi1-sh2–infected cells were mainly
GFP−, as compared to Luc-sh-control–derived tumors (fig. S4, E, low-
er panel, and F), suggesting that the tumors found in Bmi1-sh1 and
Bmi1-sh2 grafts were derived from the small percentage (less than 3%,
as shown in fig. S4, E, upper panel, and F) of nontransduced (GFP−)
cells that have outgrown the GFP+ population when co-injected into
the NSG mice. Murine C/EBPa-null pulmonary tumor cells trans-
duced with a GFP-coupled retroviral construct to overexpress C/EBPa
(MSCV-C/EBPa) demonstrated a 50% decrease in BMI1 expression
as compared to control vector (MSCV)–transduced cell (Fig. 3A).
Therefore, we assessed their ability to grow tumors in subcutaneous
transplantation assays in NSG mice. Injection of GFP+ MSCV-C/
EBPa–transduced cells resulted in the formation of smaller tumors
at day 30 (P = 0.0077), as compared to GFP+ MSCV-transduced cells
(Fig. 4D). Overall, these data indicate that BMI1 is required to main-
tain the transformed phenotype of C/EBPa-null pulmonary cancer
cells and allow their growth.
BMI1 inhibition therapy reduces tumor growth
in lung tumorigenesis
We next investigated whether modulation of BMI1 expression was
sufficient to reduce tumor burden. To devise a targeted therapy to an-
tagonize the oncogenic effect of BMI1, we used a compound (PTC-
209) (fig. S5A) capable of reducing BMI1 translation (22). PTC-209 is
a low–molecular weight molecule identified by high-throughput
screening of compounds using gene expression modulation by small
molecules (GEMS) technology, in which the GEMS reporter vector
contains the luciferase open reading frame flanked by and under post-
transcriptional control of the BMI1 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions
(22). Western blots of the C/EBPa-null line exposed to increasing con-
centration of PTC-209 (0.7 and 1.5 mM) or 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) control showed that BMI1 protein was efficiently decreased
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), to 35 and 5% that of DMSO-
treated cells, respectively (fig. S5B). BMI1 is a key component of the
epigenetic complex PRC1 (Polycomb repressive complex 1), and other
components of the PRC1/2 complex (RING1, EZH1, EZH2, and
EED) were unaffected (fig. S5C, upper panel) or just mildly affected
(SUZ12) by PTC-209 treatment (fig. S5C, lower panel). PTC-209
treatment was also accompanied by a slightly increased histone 3 with
trimethylated lysine 27 and by abrogation of histone 2A lysine 119
ubiquitination, as expected, because BMI1 catalyzes the H2AK119Ub
modification (fig. S5C, lower panel). Gene expression profiling and
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of C/EBPa-null cells exposed
to PTC-209 (1.5 mM) or DMSO control showed enrichment of
BMI1 target genes (Fig. 5B). Specifically, most BMI1-activated targets
(23) were down-regulated in PTC-treated cells (P = 0.002), and most
genes repressed by BMI1 (23) were up-regulated with PTC treatment
(P < 0.001). These results corroborate the observation that PTC-209
effectively inhibits BMI1 protein expression (Fig. 5A) and that Bmi1
mRNA is also down-regulated upon PTC-209 treatment (fig. S5D).
Further, we observed that BMI1 in vitro inhibition resulted in an
increased percentage of C/EBPa-null lung cancer cells arrested in a
nondividing state (Fig. 5C), which prompted us to test PTC-209
effects on in vivo tumor maintenance. After developing measurable
tumors, NSG mice were treated daily with PTC-209 or vehicle control
for 1 month. Tumor growth was specifically affected in PTC-209–treated
animals (n = 6), in which the tumor burden was decreased by 70%
(P = 0.00001) compared to that observed in vehicle-treated mice (n =
6) (Fig. 5D). PTC-209 treatment altered the cell cycle profile, with
BMI1 in vivo inhibition consistently showing an increase in cells in
G0 phase (average of 76.9 ± 2.3% in PTC-209–treated compared to
39.1 ± 8.7% in vehicle-treated cells, P = 0.002), as shown in Fig. 5E.
A panel of human NSCLC cell lines (adenocarcinoma cell lines
H322, A549, H23, H1975, H358, PC9, Calu-3, H1755, and H1650;
adenosquamous carcinoma cell line H647; bronchial carcinoid cell line
H727; and carcinoma cell lines Calu-1 and H1299) expressed almost
undetectable amounts of C/EBPa and medium/high amounts of
BMI1 (fig. S5E). We could not identify any NSCLC cell line with
substantial expression of C/EBPa. In contrast, C/EBPa was expressed
in medium/high amounts in the breast cancer cell line MDA-231 and
in the ovarian cancer cell lines Ovcar-3, Skov3, and 36M2, which all
had medium to low amounts of BMI1 expression (fig. S5E).
Upon treatment of the adenocarcinoma cell lines H322, A549,
H23, H1975, H358, and PC9 with PTC-209 (1.5 mM) or DMSO con-
trol for 48 hours, the amount of BMI1 protein decreased across the six
cell lines to a mean of 5.49% of the expression in the absence of the
inhibitor (SD, 2.39) (Fig. 5F), and PTC-209 treatment increased the
percentage of cells arrested in a nondividing state in all the human
adenocarcinoma cell lines analyzed (fig. S5F). Consistently, when mice
xenografted with the human adenocarcinoma cell lines were treated
with daily injections of PTC-209, they all responded to BMI1 in vivo
inhibition treatment, showing a significant tumor growth reduction
(P = 0.037 for H322 cells, P = 0.025 for A549 cells, P = 0.026 for H23
cells, P = 0.026 for H1975 cells, P = 0.042 for H358 cells, and P = 0.032
for PC9 cells), as compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5G). Overall,
our data suggest that BMI1 is a critical and druggable target, because
PTC-209 effectively reduced tumor growth and maintenance in C/
EBPa-null/low tumors positive for BMI1 expression.

 resistance, relapse, and progression of the cancer. Previously, we have
shown that C/EBPa expression is frequently decreased/abrogated in
human lung cancers (4, 16). We have also suggested that the loss of
C/EBPa could be an important event in the multistep program of
transformation (14). However, the key molecular events required for
C/EBPa-deficient cells to trigger lung tumorigenesis were still unclear.
Here, we identified a subset of C/EBPa-negative/low adenocarcinoma
patients, in which we observed an inverse correlation of C/EBPa and
BMI1 expression. We highlighted the therapeutic potential of target-
ing BMI1 in this subset of patients by describing a compound that in-
hibits BMI1 and blocks its oncogenic role. We generated mice with
specific targeted deletion of C/EBPa in adult lung epithelium, which de-
veloped pulmonary adenocarcinomas with 33% penetrance, thus estab-
lishing C/EBPa as a bona fide lung tumor suppressor in vivo. Tumors
growing in the murine model recapitulated the abnormal expression of
the C/EBPa/BMI1 axis observed in more than 80% of C/EBPa-negative/
low adenocarcinoma patients, confirming that they are an important
preclinical tool. We showed that C/EBPa-null tumor formation is
dependent on the presence of two functional Bmi1 alleles, implying that
Bmi1 gene dosage is a critical checkpoint that lung cells must overcome
to achieve transformation.
BMI1 is a key component of the epigenetic complex PRC1, which
is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, including NSCLCs,
lymphomas, leukemias, neuroblastoma, skin tumors, and breast and
colorectal carcinomas (24–32). BMI1 inhibition was recently found
to reduce tumor burden in human colorectal xenograft models (22),
similarly to what we observed in lung cancer. Specifically, by knocking
down Bmi1, a gene that lies at the heart of stem cells’ self-renewal
machinery (33), Kreso et al. observed a decrease in human colon
cancer tumor mass in mouse xenografts, as well as a decrease in the
total number of tumors initiated, suggestive of BMI1’s role in regulat-
ing cancer-initiating cells (22). Thus, identification of factors modulat-
ing BMI1 expression has generated major clinical interest. Among the
mechanisms proposed to affect its expression, BMI1 copy number was
analyzed in NSCLCs but found to be unchanged (32). Chromosomal
aberrations that may result in up-regulation of BMI1 expression were
shown in a case of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (34). Increased
gene transcription of BMI1 has been described in Hodgkin’s lympho-
ma cell lines, in which nuclear factor kB signaling contributes to its
up-regulation (35). In breast and gastric cancers, BMI1 expression
is repressed by MEL-18, a Polycomb gene with tumor suppressor
activity (36). Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms controlling BMI1 up-
regulation in lung cancer and other epithelial tumors remain un-
identified. Because our data indicate that C/EBPa contributes to
inhibit BMI1 expression, we propose that reducing C/EBPa protein
relieves its repressive activity on BMI1 transcription. We showed that
inhibition of BMI1 expression by shRNA in tumorigenic C/EBPa-null
cells impairs their tumor-propagating ability. Similarly, pharmaco-
logical inhibition of BMI1 protein impairs lung tumor growth in
C/EBPa-deficient/low cells by efficiently decreasing cell cycle progres-
sion, demonstrating the role of BMI1 in the transformed phenotype
of C/EBPa-null/low tumor cells. In addition, we observed that BMI1
expression correlates with prognosis among CEBPa-null/low lung
adenocarcinoma patients.
Further studies will be needed to elucidate the molecular mecha-
nism through which C/EBPa loss contributes to pulmonary tumori-
genesis. C/EBPa may repress BMI1 through down-regulation of c-MYC.
C/EBPa directly represses c-MYC in human myeloid cells (37). Con-
versely, stable overexpression of c-MYC results in an up-regulation
of BMI1 expression, whereas knockdown of c-MYC results in a sub-
stantial down-regulation of the endogenous BMI1 expression in the
human fibrocystic breast epithelial cell line MCF10A (36). MEL-18
down-regulates BMI1 expression in breast and gastric cancers via
c-MYC repression (36) and may be involved in this regulatory loop.
Down-regulation/inactivation of C/EBPa is a required step in the
development of several tumor types in addition to NSCLC, making its
downstream effectors potential markers and therapeutic targets. Loss
of C/EBPa in keratinocytes contributes through yet unknown mecha-
nisms to the accumulation of ultraviolet light B–induced mutations and
accelerates skin cancer progression (38). In hematopoietic malignan-
cies, C/EBPa modulates cell growth through repression of oncogenes
c-Myc, N-Myc, Bmi1, and Sox4 (17, 37, 39, 40). We hypothesize that the
C/EBPa/BMI1 axis will be central to cancer cell biology in other ma-
lignancies as well, given the numerous reports underlining both de-
creased activity of C/EBPa and increased expression of BMI1 in
many cancer types (4, 7, 41).
In conclusion, our studies show that C/EBPa is a tumor suppressor
in lung cancer and that BMI1 is a downstream mediator of the onco-
genic process. This suggests that the lung cancer subtype defined by
the loss of C/EBPa expression might specifically benefit from BMI1
inhibitory therapy, which is being evaluated in a clinical trial (clinical
trial identifier NCT02404480 at ClinicalTrials.gov). Because BMI1
plays a substantial role in many solid tumors, including one of the
most aggressive models of lung cancer, defined by inducible expres-
sion of mutated K-Ras (42), and its expression is positively correlated
with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and recurrence
(43), our findings are of interest to help design better therapeutics
for oncologic cancer patients displaying a positive BMI1 signature.

Study design
The objective of this study was to assess the physiological consequences
of the genetic deletion of C/EBPa in lung epithelial cells. A murine
pulmonary-specific C/EBPa conditional knockout model was gener-
ated to study the tumor suppressor function of C/EBPa.
The numbers of mice required for the experiments depicted in Fig. 4
and fig. S3 were not based on differences identified a priori, nor were
formal power calculations done before conducting those experiments.
In the experiment using 28 Bmi1-haploinsufficient C/EBPaLung-D mice
and 26 C/EBPaLung-D mice with normal Bmi1 expression (Fig. 4A),
there would have been 86% power by Fisher’s exact test to distin-
guish between a 30% rate of tumor in the 26 C/EBPaLung-D mice
with normal Bmi1 expression and a 1% rate of tumor in the 28 Bmi1-
haploinsufficient C/EBPaLung-D mice, testing at the 0.05 two-sided level.
In the experiment that uses 102 C/EBPaLung-D mice and 58 C/
EBPaLung-D (heterozygous) mice (Fig. 3B), there would have been
greater than 99% power to detect a difference in the rate of tumor
formation of 30% compared to 1%, using Fisher’s exact test and testing
at the 0.05 two-sided level of significance.
shRNA-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of BMI1 was also
evaluated to determine BMI1’s role as a therapeutic target in C/EBPa-
negative/low adenocarcinoma xenografts. Replicate experiments were
