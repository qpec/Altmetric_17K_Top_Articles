Comparison of Male vs Female Resident Milestone
Evaluations by Faculty During Emergency Medicine
Residency Training

IMPORTANCE Although implicit bias in medical training has long been suspected, it has been
difficult to study using objective measures, and the influence of sex and gender in the
evaluation of medical trainees is unknown. The emergency medicine (EM) milestones provide
a standardized framework for longitudinal resident assessment, allowing for analysis of
resident performance across all years and programs at a scope and level of detail never
previously possible.
OBJECTIVE To compare faculty-observed training milestone attainment of male vs female EM
residents throughout residency training
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter, longitudinal, retrospective cohort
study took place at 8 community and academic EM training programs across the United
States from July 1, 2013, to July 1, 2015, using a real-time, mobile-based, direct-observation
evaluation tool. The study examined 33 456 direct-observation subcompetency evaluations
of 359 EM residents by 285 faculty members.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Milestone attainment for male and female EM residents as
observed by male and female faculty throughout residency and analyzed using multilevel
mixed-effects linear regression modeling.
RESULTS A total of 33 456 direct-observation evaluations were collected from 359 EM
residents (237 men [66.0%] and 122 women [34.0%]) by 285 faculty members (194 men
[68.1%] and 91 women [31.9%]) during the study period. Female and male residents achieved
similar milestone levels during the first year of residency. However, the rate of milestone
attainment was 12.7% (0.07 levels per year) higher for male residents through all of residency
(95% CI, 0.04-0.09). By graduation, men scored approximately 0.15 milestone levels higher
than women, which is equivalent to 3 to 4 months of additional training, given that the
average resident gains approximately 0.52 levels per year using our model (95% CI,
0.49-0.54). No statistically significant differences in scores were found based on faculty
evaluator gender (effect size difference, 0.02 milestone levels; 95% CI for males, −0.09 to
0.11) or evaluator-evaluatee gender pairing (effect size difference, −0.02 milestone levels;
95% CI for interaction, −0.05 to 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although male and female residents receive similar
evaluations at the beginning of residency, the rate of milestone attainment throughout
training was higher for male than female residents across all EM subcompetencies, leading to
a gender gap in evaluations that continues until graduation. Faculty should be cognizant of
possible gender bias when evaluating medical trainees.

omen remain significantly underrepresented in aca-
demic medicine, with the greatest attrition in com-
mitmenttoacademiaappearingtooccurduringresi-
dency. It has been hypothesized that unconscious bias may be
asignificantcontributortothisattrition.1Thispossibilityiscon-
ceivable considering that within medicine women comprise
only one-third of the physician workforce, continue to earn a
lower adjusted income, hold fewer faculty positions at aca-
demic institutions, and enjoy fewer positions of leadership in
medical societies and departments.1-4 Indeed, a recent study5
surveying more than 1000 US academic medical faculty mem-
bers found that 70% of women perceived gender bias in the
academic environment compared with 22% of men.
To date, only a handful of studies6-9 have examined the
role of sex and gender in medical education evaluations.
Among these studies, an analysis6 of 5 years of evaluations of
medical trainees rotating through gastroenterology clinics at
the Mayo Clinic found that gender differences in evaluation
play a larger role at more senior levels of training. A cross-
sectionalstudy7ofinternalmedicineresidentsduringtheirfirst
2 years of training at the University of California, San Fran-
cisco, revealed that male residents were consistently rated
higher than their female colleagues in 9 dimensions of perfor-
mance. A similarly designed study conducted at Yale
University,8 however, found no significant evidence of gen-
der bias in the evaluation of their internal medicine resi-
dents. Likewise, Holmboe et al9 asked faculty members to
evaluate scripted videos of resident performance and found
no differences in evaluation based on faculty or resident
gender.
Many of these studies7,8 are now more than a decade old,
making comparisons with current demographic data problem-
atic. Moreover, none of these studies6-9 examined medical
trainees across institutions, and many were performed using
institutional or unvalidated evaluation scales, limiting the ex-
ternal validity of their findings. In addition, the studies have
conflictingoutcomesandwidelyvaryingmethods,whichmake
interpreting the findings difficult and comparisons among
these studies nearly impossible. Furthermore, vignette-style
studies9maybepronetotheHawthorneeffect,wherebyevalu-
ators are less likely to be discriminatory in their evaluations
knowingthattheyarebeingevaluated.Lastly,fewstudieshave
examined bias using direct observation of skills.
The recently adopted Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education’s (ACGME’s) Next Accreditation System
(NAS) milestone evaluations offers a novel method of study-
inggenderbias.TheNASmilestoneevaluationsystemisacom-
petency-based evaluation framework that is now used by all
training programs to evaluate resident and fellow progress.10
This nationally standardized, longitudinal system allows for
analysis of trainee performance across all years and training
programs, at a scope and level of detail never previously pos-
sible, and can facilitate multicenter studies on many aspects
of graduate medical education.
Emergency medicine (EM) was one of the first specialties
to adopt the NAS and develop milestones through a rigorous
process that included a consensus of national experts, and it
is the only specialty to have engaged most residency pro-
grams in a national milestone validation study, resulting in sig-
nificant revision of the milestones before implementation.11-13
To date, EM is the only specialty to have had the reliability
and validity of their milestones supported using psychomet-
ric analysis by the ACGME, which included data from 100%
of EM programs.11,14 This study aims to compare the evalua-
tion of male vs female residents by faculty throughout train-
ing using a novel longitudinal, multi-institutional data set
that consists of EM milestone evaluations based on direct
observation.
Methods
This study was approved as exempt research by the Univer-
sity of Chicago Institutional Review Board. Data from all in-
stitutions were pooled, and all identifying information was re-
moved to create a composite data set. Written consent for data
use was obtained from all participating programs.
Study Population
Data for this longitudinal, retrospective analysis were col-
lected at 8 hospitals from July 1, 2013, to July 1, 2015. Train-
ing programs were included in this study if they had already
adopted InstantEval, a direct-observation mobile app for col-
lecting milestone evaluations. For purposes of standardiza-
tion,only3-yearACGME-accreditedEMtrainingprogramswere
included.Residents’genderwasdeterminedbyexaminingboth
names and photos for all residents and faculty that were sub-
mitted to InstantEval by the program. In cases of ambiguity,
we looked at the residents’ profiles on their program's web-
site to determine gender.
Data Collection
DatawerecollectedusingInstantEval,version2.0(MonteCarlo
Software LLC), a software application available on the mobile
devices and tablets of faculty members to facilitate real-time,
direct-observation milestone evaluations. Faculty members
chose when to complete evaluations, whom to evaluate, and
the number of evaluations to complete, although most pro-
grams encouraged set numbers of daily point-of-care or end-
of-shift evaluations (generally ranging from 1 to 3 evaluations
Key Points
Question How does gender affect the evaluation of emergency
medicine residents throughout residency training?
Findings In this longitudinal, retrospective cohort study of 33 456
direct-observation evaluations from 8 emergency medicine
training programs, we found that the rate of milestone attainment
was higher for male residents throughout training across all
subcompetencies. By graduation, this gap was equivalent to more
than 3 months of additional training.
Meaning The rate of milestone attainment throughout training is
significantly higher for male than female residents across all
emergency medicine subcompetencies, leading to a wide gender
gap in evaluations that continues until graduation.

per shift). Each evaluation consisted of a milestone-based
performance level (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5) on 1 of 23
possible individual EM subcompetencies, along with an
optional text comment given to a resident by a single faculty
member (eFigure in the Supplement). Subcompetencies
more procedural in nature were grouped as procedural sub-
competencies.
When performing an evaluation, faculty members were
presented with all descriptors of the individual milestone lev-
els, as written by the ACGME and the American Board of Emer-
gency Medicine. This data set, therefore, represents direct-
observation evaluations produced at the individual evaluator
levelratherthanthefinalevaluationsproducedbyclinicalcom-
petency committees.
Statistical Analysis
Trainee and faculty demographic data were tabulated, and a
1-sample test of proportions was used to assess gender differ-
ences in our study population compared with the national
population of EM resident and attending physicians. Differ-
ences in the number of evaluations between the 2 groups were
assessed using a 2-sample t test. Gaps in training were de-
tected by time difference greater than 1 month between sub-
sequent evaluations of a given resident.
Given that our sample size was large, appeared nearly
normally distributed (skewness = −0.2, kurtosis = 2.7), and
was without a substantial number of outliers, we analyzed
the milestones as continuous rather than ordinal data. To
explore the effect of resident and attending physician gen-
der pairings on evaluations, scores given by male and
female attending physicians were averaged separately for
each resident and compared using a paired t test for both
resident genders.
A 3-level mixed-effects model with both nested and
crossed random effects using restricted maximum likeli-
hood was used to examine the association between mile-
stone evaluation scores and resident gender over time.
In our primary model, evaluations (level 1) were nested
within residents and attending physicians (crossed at level
2), who were nested in training programs (level 3). Resi-
dents were assigned random intercepts. Each model
included fixed effects for the amount of time spent in resi-
dency, resident gender, and their interaction. To account for
potential confounders, factors such as training within a
community or academic program, being evaluated by a
male or female attending physician, the interaction of
attending and resident physician gender, and whether a
procedural subcompetency was being evaluated were
included as fixed effects in subsequent models. The normal-
ity of the standardized residuals was verified using quantile-
quantile plots.
Differences in training programs were assessed by fit-
ting an analysis of variance model using the mean score per
resident for each postgraduate year (PGY) and assessing the
training program by resident gender interaction. Analyses
were performed using STATA statistical software, version 14
(StataCorp). Statistical significance was presumed at P < .05
(2-tailed test).
Results
Demographic Characteristics
A total of 33 456 direct-observation evaluations were col-
lectedfrom359EMresidents(237men[66.0%]and122women
[34.0%]) by 285 faculty members (194 men [68.1%] and 91
women [31.9%]) during the study period. The proportion of fe-
male residents in our study (34.0%) was not significantly dif-
ferent from the proportion of female residents in EM nation-
ally (37.5%; P = .12).15 However, our study sample had a slightly
higher proportion of female attending physicians (91 [31.9%])
compared with the national population of EM physicians
(25.5%;P = .02).15Ourstudyincludedevaluationsfrom8train-
ing programs (6 academic and 2 community programs)
(Table 1). The training programs represent all 4 US Census–
designated regions of the United States (Northeast, Midwest,
South, West) in a mix of rural, suburban, and urban settings.
Training programs ranged from 21 to 54 residents.
Because of the adoption of InstantEval by training pro-
grams at different times during the study period, this data set
represents 350 resident-years of evaluations. A total of 9832
evaluations (29.4%) were of PGY1 residents, 13 129 (39.2%) of
PGY2residents,and10493(31.4%)ofPGY3residents.Themean
numbers of evaluations received during the study period were
96forfemaleresidentsand87formaleresidents,althoughthis
difference was not statistically significant (P = .21). Similarly,
the mean numbers of evaluations were 125 for male attend-
ing physicians and 101 for female attending physicians, which
wasalsonotstatisticallysignificant(P = .25).Finally,therewere
no statistically significant differences in the mean duration or
frequency of training gaps between male and female resi-
dents (male residents had a mean of 2.77 periods [4 continu-
ous weeks each] with no evaluations vs 2.54 periods with no
evaluations for females; P = .85).

Descriptive Analysis
Frequency distributions for the milestone levels assigned to
male and female residents in PGY1 and PGY3 are shown in the
Figure. The PGY1 score distributions appear to be similar for
male and female residents; however, the PGY3 distributions
suggest that male residents are evaluated at higher milestone
levels more frequently. This trend was observed in 7 of 8 train-
ing programs included in the study.
Mean scores per EM subcompetency were calculated for
PGY1 and PGY3 residents (Table 2). In the first year of resi-
dency, male and female residents were evaluated compara-
bly, with female residents receiving higher evaluations in sub-
competencies, such as multitasking, diagnosis, and
accountability. For PGY3 residents, men were evaluated higher
on all 23 subcompetencies. No statistically significant differ-
ences were found in the scores given by male and female fac-
ulty members, indicating that faculty members of both sexes
evaluated female residents lower.
Mixed-Effects Model Analysis
Results from the mixed-effects linear regression model are
given in Table 3. Consistent with the means calculated in
Table 2, our model demonstrated that female residents were
evaluated higher than male residents at the beginning of resi-
dency, but this factor was only weakly significant (−0.07; 95%
CI, −0.14 to −0.004). The rate of milestone attainment, de-
fined as the increase in the mean milestone level achieved over
time, was 0.52 levels per year (95% CI, 0.49-0.53). Male resi-
dents had a significant, 13% higher rate of milestone attain-
ment (0.07 milestone levels per year; 95% CI, 0.04-0.09). This
higher rate of attainment led to a higher mean milestone score

for men after the first year of residency that continued until
graduation. By graduation, men were evaluated approxi-
mately 0.15 milestone levels higher than women, equivalent
to 3 to 4 months of additional training, given the overall
increase of 0.52 milestone levels per year. This effect was
consistent for procedural and nonprocedural subcompeten-
cies, as well as across training programs. No overall differ-
ences in milestone scores were found based on evaluator
gender (effect of 0.02 milestone levels; 95% CI, −0.09 to
0.11) or evaluator-evaluatee gender pairing (effect of −0.02
milestone levels; 95% CI, −0.05 to 0.01), indicating that
male and female faculty members evaluated residents simi-
larly. Additional significant predictors of milestone score
included time spent in residency (effect of 0.52 levels per
year; 95% CI, 0.49-0.54; P < .001) and whether a procedural
skill was evaluated (effect of −0.04 levels; −0.06 to −0.03;
P < .001) (Table 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the EM mile-
stones,whichhavestrongevidenceofvalidity,toquantifygen-
der bias in trainee evaluations using a longitudinal, multi-
center data set. We found that despite starting at similar levels,
the rate of milestone attainment throughout training is higher
for male than female residents across all EM subcompeten-
cies, leading to a wide gender gap in evaluations by gradua-
tion. Because of our data structure, we were able to use ro-
bust statistical modeling techniques to test potential
mechanisms that may produce the significant gender gap ob-
served, while controlling for other characteristics, such as
evaluator gender and grading tendencies.
It is worth exploring the mechanism of these findings. One
possibility is that gender differences in this study were at least
partially driven by implicit gender bias, defined as an uncon-
scious preference for, or prejudice against, one gender over an-
other. Of importance, evaluators are generally unaware that
suchbiasesareoperating,andthesebiasesmayevenbeatodds
with their professed beliefs. Several aspects of our data sup-
port this implicit gender bias hypothesis. We found that men
and women were evaluated similarly at the beginning of train-
ing, with women, in fact, receiving higher mean scores on sev-
eral subcompetencies. This finding suggests that male and fe-
male residents entered training with similar skills and funds
of knowledge. However, as women progressed through the
same residency programs, they were consistently evaluated
lower than their male colleagues. By PGY3, women were
evaluated lower on all 23 EM subcompetencies, including
the potentially more objective procedural subcompetencies
and potentially more subjective nonprocedural subcompe-
tencies. Such a uniform trend may suggest implicit bias
rather than diminished competency or skill, especially con-
sidering that men and women began residency with similar
skills and knowledge.
Research from the social sciences has yielded a number
of insights into conscious and subconscious drivers of gen-
der bias in medical education and the effects they have over
time.16-20 Senior residents are expected to assume leader-
ship roles and display agentic traits, such as assertiveness
and independence, which are stereotypically identified as
male characteristics.18 When female residents assume lead-
ership roles and display agentic qualities during later years
of training, they may incur a penalty for violating expected
gender roles—a phenomenon that has been described as role
incongruity or the likeability penalty.16,18-20 Compounding
the problem is the concept of stereotype threat, where mem-
bers of a group characterized by negative stereotypes may
actually perform below their actual abilities in situations
where the negative stereotype becomes salient.17 Thus, one
way to interpret our findings is that a widening gender gap
is attributable to the cumulative effects of repeated disad-
vantages and biases that become increasingly pronounced
at the more senior levels of training.
Other factors that may contribute to the observed evalu-
ation gap include disparate opportunities in accessing men-
torship, practicing skills, and obtaining meaningful feed-
back. For example, it has been established that gender plays a
strongroleinthementor-menteerelationship.21However,there
are disproportionately fewer female faculty members in EM,
which may reduce mentorship opportunities for female resi-
dents. It is also possible that male residents had more
opportunities to practice their skills in the emergency
department, and their higher evaluation scores are attribut-
able to more clinical experience. Although not statistically
significant, the lower than expected number of evaluations
for female residents may represent less feedback from
attending physicians or less participation in observed clini-
cal opportunities.
It is also possible that women have systematic dis-
advantages in certain domains of clinical practice that are
leading to this gap. We found larger differences between
men and women in certain subcompetencies, such as
airway management and general approach to procedures.
A more thorough evaluation of such drivers may allow
simple solutions to these problems, such as designing ergo-
nomic laryngoscopes for women or adding protocols to
adjust bed height in the case of the airway management
subcompetency.

postgraduate year 3, the mean milestone score will be 0.15 levels higher for
men compared with women, representing 3 to 4 mo of training. Initial
adjustment for male residents represents the relative fixed difference in
milestone scores for men compared with women (the intercept for male
residents).

Social determinants, such as motherhood and maternity
leave, have been discussed as potential drivers of the gender
gap in the workplace in several studies.1,3,22 Such factors
would likely be more pronounced during training, which is
consistent with our findings. However, few training gaps
were detected in our study, and the frequency and duration
of these gaps did not differ significantly for male and female
residents.
Given the disparity we observed, future research is needed
to better understand the mechanisms behind these trends so
that we can design effective interventions that promote gen-
der equity in medicine. Although it was beyond the scope of
this study, our data include nearly 15 000 text comments along
with the numerical evaluations that may provide additional
important insights into why the gender gap emerges. In addi-
tion, studies of participant observation of medical education
have been found to effectively uncover biases. Thus, future re-
search using qualitative methods is warranted to better un-
derstand the context in which these evaluations occur.23
Regardless of the specific factors behind our findings, our
study highlights the need for awareness of gender bias in resi-
dency training, which itself may partially serve to mitigate it.
Implementing focused evaluation and communication tech-
niques based on proven models of effective evaluation and
feedbackstrategies,combinedwithcontinuedrecruitmentand
training efforts to narrow the gender and mentorship gaps in
medicine, may also help attenuate gender differences in evalu-
ations during residency.3,17 Training programs may also con-
sider introducing implicit bias training and addressing stereo-
type threat by promoting a more inclusive and supportive
culture.1,17,18
Understanding bias in the NAS is also important because
the milestone evaluation system is a critical piece in begin-
ning the transition from the current structure and process
system of postgraduate medical education to a competency-
based medical education system.13,24 Under a competency-
based medical education system, residents will graduate only
after demonstrating competency in the core areas of a spe-
cialty, which can even lead to variable training lengths from
resident to resident. On the basis of the findings of our model,
female residents would require an additional 3 to 4 months of
training to graduate at the same level as their male counter-
parts. Because a resident’s milestone evaluations may one day
influence how long they spend in training, it is imperative that
the evaluation system be rigorously validated and investi-
gated for any possible bias.
Limitations
This study should be interpreted within the context of cer-
tain limitations. The influence of sex and gender on evalua-
tions is highly complex, and given the observational nature of
our study and the difficulty of establishing causality, many of
our explanations will remain speculative until further re-
search provides a fuller understanding. It is possible that we
did not attribute gender correctly based on name and photo
review. Furthermore, the type of feedback solicited by resi-
dents, or given by evaluators, may have varied because of se-
lection bias. In addition, although all programs used the same
evaluation tool, use of the app likely varied by program, at-
tending physician, and shift. Although our study includes aca-
demicandcommunitytrainingprogramsthroughoutthecoun-
try in urban, suburban, and rural settings of all sizes, our data
may not be reflective of all EM programs because only pro-
gramsthathadadopteduseoftheInstantEvalsoftwareforresi-
dent evaluations were included in the study.
Conclusions
Although male and female EM residents are evaluated simi-
larly at the beginning of residency, the rate of milestone
attainment throughout training is higher for male than
female residents, leading to a wide gender gap in evalua-
tions across all EM subcompetencies by graduation.
Although the specific factors that drive these outcomes
remain to be determined, this study highlights the need to
be cognizant of gender bias and the necessity of further
research in this area.
