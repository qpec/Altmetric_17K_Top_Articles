risk of non-partner sexual violence in India

Abstract
Background: Globally, one in ten individuals practice open defecation. Despite media speculation that it
increases women’s risk of sexual violence, little empirical evidence supports the claims. We investigate the
relationship between household sanitation facilities and women’s risk of non-partner sexual violence (NPSV)
in India, where nearly half of the population lives without a pit or toilet.
Methods: We use the most recent NPSV data, from the National Family Health Survey-III, to estimate logistic
regression models of the effects of household sanitation facilities (toilet, pit, or none) on NPSV in the last year
among women who have resided in their current home for one year or more. These effects are estimated
net of other socioeconomic factors, compared to effects of household sanitation facilities on child diarrhea,
and, as a falsification test, compared to effects of household sanitation facilities on intimate partner sexual
violence (IPSV) in the last year.
Results: Net of their socioeconomic status, women who use open defecation are twice as likely to face NPSV
as women with a household toilet. This is twice the association between open defecation and child diarrhea.
The results of our falsification test indicate that open defecation is not correlated with IPSV, thus disconfirming a
simultaneous selection of women into open defecation and sexual violence.
Conclusions: Our findings provide empirical evidence that lacking household sanitation is associated with higher risk
of NPSV.

Background
Nearly half of the world’s population (42 %) continues to
lack access to improved sanitation conditions, with more
than one in ten (13 %) individuals forced to defecate in
the open [1]. The majority of these individuals (59 %)
reside in India. Since 1990, the Indian government has
introduced nationwide campaigns to improve sanitation
facilities across the country—first under the Total
Sanitation Campaign (TSC), and most recently under the
Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) [2]. However, the lack of
improved sanitation remains a major public health
concern [1, 3].
To date, public health research on open defecation has
centered on its link to multiple infectious diseases, with a
focus on its connection to ill health, particularly among
children, who are especially vulnerable to diarrhea-related
morbidity [4, 5]. However, more recently, media has
highlighted how poor sanitation extends beyond specific
disease etiologies, suggesting that open defecation may
put women at higher risk of NPSV [6]. Despite media
accounts suggesting this link, scant empirical evidence
exists., Qualitative research has linked women’s lack
of household sanitation and clean water sources to a
heightened fear of sexual violence in India [7, 8],
Vietnam [8], Kenya [9], and Ghana [10]. In the Indian
state of Orissa, a majority of respondents feared un-
wanted sexual encounters such as being watched, indecent
exposure, and NPSV. Another study confirmed that
adolescent girls and young women—especially those resi-
ding in the local slum—were sexually victimized while
accessing sanitation sources [11]. One recent study of
women in Kenya linked open defecation to higher odds of
NPSV [12].

 We contribute to this body of literature by examining
whether women’s lack of household sanitary facilities is
associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing NPSV.
We use the most recent data available on sexual violence
in India to test this relationship, estimating the effects
net of other socioeconomic characteristics, and employing
information from time-specific questions that ensure
household sanitation facilities preceded violent incidents.
We further rule out selection bias with a falsification test
in which we use household sanitation facilities to predict
intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV). To contextualize
the magnitude of our findings, we conduct a parallel
analysis of the relationship between household sanitation
facilities and risk of waterborne illness, specifically, child
diarrhea.
Our study is an important extension of research on
violence against women, exploring a predictor of NPSV
that is not well researched. While the data are from
2005-06, they are the most recently available data on
sexual violence in India. Moreover, there is no reason to
believe that the effects of open defecation on NPSV are
period specific. We examine this association by joining
two distinct literatures on sexual violence and water,
sanitation and hygiene. It has been pointed out that
discussions about making progress toward Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) 7c – to “halve, by 2015,
the proportion of the population without sustainable
access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation” – have
overlooked the importance of this goal for women’s safety
[13]. There is a critical need to understand the implica-
tions of sanitation facilities beyond the realm of illness.
We argue that access to sanitation is a major factor
in understanding sexual violence against women, and
utilizing toilets may substantially mitigate some women’s
risk of NPSV.
Methods
We analyze data from the 2005–06 Indian National
Family Health Survey- III (NFHS), a nationally represen-
tative dataset collected by ICF international and the
Indian Ministry of Health using a stratified random
sampling approach [14]. 68 % of women from the full
sample were selected for the domestic violence module,
with one woman between the ages of 15 and 49 randomly
selected from each household to answer questions about
their exposure within the past year to different types of
violence, including NPSV. Nearly all women agreed to
participate in the module (99 %), which was administered
in a private setting to help ensure accuracy of reports. We
exclude the small percentage (4 %; N = 2,908) of women
who had not resided in their current household for at least
one year at the time of the survey, given that we have data
on the sanitary facilities solely in women’s current house-
hold. Because the measure of household sanitary facilities
is at a single point in time, it is possible they changed over
the course of the preceding year. The final analytic sample
consists of 75,619 women.
To analyze the relationship between household sanita-
tion facilities and NPSV, we classify women’s household
sanitation facilities into three categories: (1) toilet (i.e.,
flush, compost, and dry toilets), (2) pit/latrine, and (3)
open defecation, which refers to respondents whose
property does not contain any type of sanitation facility.
We distinguish sexual violence from physical violence
using World Health Organization (WHO) definitions.
They define physical violence – being pushed, kicked,
shoved, dragged on purpose – largely in the realm of
intimate partner violence (IPV), while non partner
violence is defined largely by sexual violence. Specifically,
as any woman aged 15 and over being forced to perform
any sexual act that they did not want, by someone other
than husband or partner [15]. Our measure of NPSV is
based on responses to two questions. First, all women
were asked: “At any time in your life, as a child or as an
adult, has anyone ever forced you in any way to have
sexual intercourse or perform any other sexual acts?”
Never-married respondents who replied “yes” were then
asked: “In the last twelve months, has anyone forced you
to have sexual intercourse or perform any other sexual
acts against your will?” Ever-married respondents who
replied “yes” were asked the same question but were spe-
cifically asked whether “anyone other than your (current/
last) husband” had forced them to perform such acts. ‘Yes’
answers from both never- and ever-married respondents
are coded 1; ‘no’ answers for ever experiencing sexual
violence or for experiencing sexual violence from some-
one other than a husband in the prior twelve months
are coded 0. Twelve respondents refused to answer
the question and are omitted from the analysis (<0 · 01 %
of the sample). No information about the perpetrators, or
report of NPSV to authorities, or severity of attack was
asked in this survey, which would have added to our
understanding of NPSV in India.
We begin our investigation with a bivariate analysis of
household sanitation facilities and NPSV. We then
conduct a multivariate analysis that adjusts for respon-
dents’ demographic characteristics, including number of
years of education (0–23); age (15–49 years); relationship
status (never married, married, widowed, not living
together); caste and religion (upper caste Hindu; sche-
duled caste/tribe Hindu; other backward caste Hindu;
lower class Muslim; forward class Muslim; other sched-
uled caste/tribe, Christian, or Buddhist; and other); level
of urbanization (mega city, large city, small city, large
town, small town, rural); and geographic region (North,
North-central, North-east, East, West, and South). Last,
we rerun our multivariate model of NPSV adjusting for
both demographic characteristics and household assets,

 which are characterized using both a dummy for electri-
city and a categorical measure of roof material (natural;
man-made and semi-permanent; and man-made and
permanent). Because NPSV is measured dichotomously,
we use logistic regressions to conduct all bivariate and
multivariate analyses.
We estimate two parallel sets of analyses. First, to
put the magnitude of our estimated associations of the
relationship between women’s access to sanitation facil-
ities and NPSV in perspective, we test the relationship
between household sanitation facilities and diarrhea
among children. This analysis is limited to mothers with
a child younger than age five residing in their same
household (N = 25,285; 33 % of the analytic sample).
Among respondents with children of this age, those who
report that at least one child has had diarrhea within the
preceding two weeks are coded (1) for “at least one child
sick”; those who report that no child has had diarrhea
within the preceding two weeks are coded (0) for “none.”
Among this sample of respondents, the proportions
reporting at least one young child with diarrhea are
10 % (95 % CI 0 · 09-0 · 10) for those using a toilet,
13 % (95 % CI 0 · 11-0 · 14) for those using a pit/latrine,
and 12 % (95 % CI 0 · 11-0 · 13) for those using open
defecation (bivariate analysis not shown).
Second, to address whether the observed associations
with NPSV reflect the selection of disadvantaged women
into both households that lack sanitation facilities and
higher risk of sexual violence, or are specific only to
NPSV, we explore whether lack of sanitation facilities is
also associated with IPSV. Though we account for socio-
economic factors in our main analyses, we recognize that
other unobserved factors could drive a spurious asso-
ciation between household sanitation facilities and sexual
violence. However, if this were the case, we would also
anticipate to observe an association between household
sanitation facilities and IPSV. Because there is no reason
to believe there is a direct association between household
sanitation facilities and IPSV, documenting such an asso-
ciation would suggest our findings are spurious. However,
finding no direct association between sanitation and IPSV
would strengthen support that any observed association
between household sanitation facilities and NPSV reflects
a non-spurious process. Among the full sample, propor-
tions reporting IPSV in the prior 12 months are 5 %
(95 % CI 0 · 04-0 · 05) for those using a toilet and 8 %
for those using either a pit/latrine (95 % CI 0 · 07-0 · 09)
or open defecation (95 % CI: 0 · 07-0 · 08).
In our analyses of both child diarrhea, and IPSV, we
adjust for the same demographic characteristics and
household assets as our most saturated model of NPSV.
All analyses are weighted to provide nationally represen-
tative estimates. For ease of interpretation, we present
the results of all logistic regressions in terms of odds-
ratios (Tables 2, 3 and 4).
Results
Only 53 % (95 % CI 0 · 52-0 · 53) of respondents in
our sample have access to sanitation facilities in the
household; 8 % (95 % CI 0 · 08-0 · 08) use pits/latrines;
and 39 % (95 % CI 0 · 38-0 · 39) use open defecation
(univariate analysis not shown). As shown in Fig. 1,
women’s access to household sanitation facilities varies
substantially across regions of India. For instance, in
Northeast India, only 10 % (95 % CI 0 · 10-0 · 11) of
respondents defecate in the open compared to 50 %
(95 % CI 0 · 49-0 · 50) of respondents in East India.

 As presented in Table 1, NPSV is rare in the Indian
context. According to our estimates, 0 · 1 % (95 % CI
0 · 001-0 · 001) of respondents using toilets, 0 · 1 %
(95 % CI 0 · 0004-0 · 002) of respondents using pits/
latrines, and 0 · 2 % (95 % CI 0 · 001-0 · 002) of respondents
using open defecation had experienced NPSV in the prior
year. Despite its rarity, our descriptive analysis indicates
that NPSV is twice as common among women using
open defecation than it is among women using toilets
(t-tests confirm this difference; p < 0.05), though we

 found no statistically significant difference in risk of
NPSV among women using pits/latrines versus open
defecation (analysis not shown).
The logistic regression model results shown for Model 1
of Table 2 confirm a significant association between
household sanitary facilities and NPSV. Compared to
women who have access to a toilet in their household,
Indian women who must open defecate have 2.14 times
the risk of NPSV (p < .01). The results for Model 2 – which
includes the demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic
factors – confirm the association is robust, though the
strength of the association is slighted attenuated (p < .05).
The results for Model 3 – which adds in measures of
household assets and infrastructure – also support the
significant association between open defecation and NPSV.
Analysis including interaction terms with demographic
and socioeconomic correlates was not significant.
To put the magnitude of this association in perspec-
tive, Table 3 presents the results of a parallel analysis of
household sanitation facilities and young children’s re-
cent diarrhea (within two weeks preceding survey).
Households that lack sanitary facilities have higher bur-
dens of child diarrhea compared to households with a
flushed toilet. We found that, compared to their peers
who live in a house with a flush toilet, households using
a pit/latrine or open defecation have 44 % and 27 %
higher odds of having children with diarrheal disease,
respectively. Although it is large and significant, the as-
sociation between sanitation facilities and child diarrhea
is only about one-fourth the size of the one between
household sanitation facilities and NPSV, demonstrating
the strength of the relationship with NPSV.
It is possible that Indian women who lack adequate
household sanitation facilities share other traits that

 drive their higher risk of both living in a household
without sanitary facilities and sexual violence. If this is
the case, we expect there to be a comparable association
between household sanitary facilities and IPSV within
the prior year (Table 4). That is, a significant association
between household sanitation facilities and IPSV—two
factors not theoretically related—would suggest that our
sanitation-NPSV results are likely due to some unmeas-
ured characteristics or processes. We find no evidence
that open defecation is significantly associated with an
elevated risk of IPSV, lending support to the conclusion
that open defecation places women at uniquely higher
risk of one type of sexual violence: non-partner.
Discussion
The separate issues of household sanitation and women’s
risk of sexual violence in India have received substantial

 attention from both scholars and policymakers in recent
years [11, 16]. However, little research has asked whether
the two issues are linked. Reliable statistics on NPSV are
likely to be downward biased due to underreporting,
particularly in the South Asian context, however, a
systematic review found that 3.3 % of women in India
and Bangladesh reported this type of violence – distinct
from IPSV [17]. Non-profits dedicated to improving
sanitation and water projects around the world have
begun to include gender and violence components in
their agenda [18, 19]. Though this suggests an increasing
awareness of the link between NPSV and household
sanitation, much more empirical research is needed on

 this topic. Additionally, improving a household’s sanitary
conditions is not necessarily the solution to minimizing
NPSV. Studies have shown that about 50 % of toilets built
by Indian governmental programs are not used for their
intended purpose [4, 20], and at least one study suggests
that in North India, many people prefer open defecation
to toilet use [21]. For toilets to protect women against
NPSV, they must be used in place of open defecation.
Improving the social acceptability of toilet use is thus
imperative, and our study provides concrete evidence
of immediate incentives for behavioral change. Our study
is the first to quantify the relationship between sanitation
facilities and NPSV in India and confirms the relevance
of household sanitation facilities for women’s safety as
well as children’s health.
Our study has some limitations. First, the data we use
are from 2005-06, which unfortunately, are the most
recent available data from India. Given the attention this
topic has received and the fact that a new wave of data
will not be available for at least another two years, we
believe it is important to disseminate this information
now, and that the new wave of data will only further
confirm our findings. Second, we cannot assess a direct
causal linkage between NPSV and toilet facilities because
our data are cross-sectional; however, we establish tem-
poral ordering by restricting our measures of NPSV in
the last year among women who have resided in their
current home for one year or more. Finally, we recognize
that the intent of the DHS data collection was not to focus
on domestic violence or sanitation, but are modules
included in the survey. Thus the types of questions
asked in these modules were limited in scope and depth,
thus we are unable to ascertain detailed circumstances
and consequences of NPSV.
Conclusion
Our results, which suggest that women who use open
defecation have twice the odds of NPSV than women
who use household toilets, indicate that infrastructure
improvements can provide women with some level of
protection against NPSV. Our findings provide further
rationale for NGOs and the Indian government to ex-
pand sanitation programs, and raise new questions about
the potentially protective role of sanitation facilities in
other contexts beyond India.
