Scientific Summary: Growing concern about suicide risk among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) necessi-
tates population-based research to determine rates in representative samples and to inform appropriate prevention
efforts. This study used existing surveillance data in Utah to determine incidence of suicide among individuals with ASD
over a 20-year period, and to characterize those who died. Between 1998 and 2017, 49 individuals with ASD died by sui-
cide. Suicide cumulative incidence rates did not significantly differ between 1998 and 2012 across the ASD and non-ASD
populations. Between 2013 and 2017, the cumulative incidence of suicide in the ASD population was 0.17%, which was
significantly higher than in the non-ASD population (0.11%; P < 0.05). During this period, this difference was driven by
suicide among females with ASD; suicide risk in females with ASD was over three times higher than in females without
ASD (relative risk (RR): 3.42; P < 0.01). Among the individuals with ASD who died by suicide, average age at death and
manner of death did not differ significantly between males and females. Ages at death by suicide ranged from 14 to
70 years (M[SD] = 32.41[15.98]). Individuals with ASD were significantly less likely to use firearms as a method of suicide
(adjusted odds ratio: 0.33; P < 0.001). Study results expand understanding of suicide risk in ASD and point to the need for
additional population-based research into suicide attempts and ideation, as well as exploration of additional risk factors.
Findings also suggest a need for further study of female suicide risk in ASD. Autism Res 2019, 12: 658–666. © 2019 The

Lay Summary: This study examined suicide risk among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Utah over a
20-year period. Risk of suicide death in individuals with ASD was found to have increased over time and to be greater
than in individuals without ASD between 2013 and 2017. Females with ASD were over three times as likely to die from
suicide as females without ASD. Young people with ASD were at over twice the risk of suicide than young people without
ASD. Individuals with ASD were less likely than others to die from firearm-related suicides.

Introduction
Suicide is a global public health crisis [WHO, 2018]. In the
U.S., 12.93 per 100,000 individuals die by suicide per year,
making it the tenth leading cause of death overall, and the
second leading cause of death among young people ages
10–34 [CDC, 2016]. Suicide occurs more commonly
among males than females at a ratio of 3.5 to 1, respec-
tively [NIMH, 2018]. Women also tend to use less violent
methods of suicide than males [Ajdacic-Gross et al., 2008].
Families, clinicians, and autistic individuals have raised
growing concern as emerging research suggests high rates
of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among individuals
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [Veenstra-Vander-
Weele, 2018]. However, much of this research to date has
focused on clinical or convenience samples reporting vary-
ing rates [Zahid & Upthegrove, 2017]; little population-
based data exists on risk of death by suicide in the ASD
population. In this study, we focused specifically on
suicide death among individuals with ASD in Utah to
identify incidences and characteristics of the decedents.
This type of population-based research is needed to fully
understand the problem of suicide in ASD and who is at
risk while expanding on prior studies.
Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in ASD
Review studies have reported wide ranging rates of
suicidal thoughts and behaviors in ASD populations

 2017]. Zahid and Upthegrove [2017] identified studies
reporting a range of suicide attempts from 7% to 47%
and suicidal ideation in up to 72% of cases in small
samples. Cassidy et al. [2014] reported suicidal ideation
in 66% of their clinical sample of 374 adult-diagnosed
individuals with ASD (specifically, Asperger’s syndrome)
in the United Kingdom. This rate exceeded that of the
general population by over ninefold. Chen et al. [2017]
recently published a population-based study that exam-
ined suicide attempts among 5,618 Taiwanese adoles-
cents and adults with ASD. These individuals with ASD
experienced
higher
rates
of
suicide
attempts
when
compared with 22,472 age- and sex-matched controls
(3.9% vs. 0.7%, respectively), even after accounting for
relevant demographic characteristics and co-occurring
psychiatric diagnoses (hazard ratio = 6.07; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 4.64–7.93) [Chen et al., 2017].
Because suicide is a relatively rare occurrence, and ASD
affects approximately 2% of the population, some researchers
have opted to examine relationships between suicidality and
autistic traits within samples of individuals without an ASD
diagnosis. For example, Culpin et al. [2018] recently identified
a significant relationship between social communication
impairments and suicidal intent among over 5,000 youth in
the U.K. (adjusted RR = 2.14, P = 0.004). In a sample of
163 young adults in the U.K., Pelton and Cassidy [2017] also
found that self-reported autistic traits predicted suicidal
behavior in mediation models, with significant indirect
effects
found through both perceived burdensomeness
(P = 0.001) and thwarted belonging (P = 0.001).
Suicide Deaths in ASD
Only one study, to our knowledge, has examined suicide
death among individuals with ASD using population-based
data. This study, conducted in Sweden by Hirvikoski et al.
[2016], used national health data to determine causes of
mortality in ASD. Overall, 83 individuals with ASD in their
sample (0.31%) died by suicide, compared with 0.04% of
the general population—almost an eight-fold difference
[Hirvikoski et al., 2016]. They identified suicide as one of
the top three most common causes of premature mortality
among individuals with ASD without co-occurring intellec-
tual disability (ID); this group was over nine times as likely
to die by suicide than those without ASD (OR: 9.40; 95%
CI: 7.43–11.9). Individuals with ASD and ID also had higher
rates than in the general population, but this risk was less
pronounced (OR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.14–5.11). Results regard-
ing females with ASD completing suicide were notable.
Because both suicide and ASD are less common among
females when considered independently, one might expect
suicide among females with ASD to be quite rare. However,
in Hirvikoski et al.’s [2016] study, females with ASD were
over 13 times more likely than females in the general popu-
lation to die by suicide (OR: 13.05; 95% CI: 8.73–19.5).
Study Purpose
Existing research on suicidal thoughts and behaviors have
often relied on clinical or convenience samples. These
approaches introduce methodological biases that can
result in over- and under-inflated reporting of suicidality
in ASD. The single prior population-based study of suicide
death among individuals with ASD occurred in Sweden. In
this study, we used existing population-wide surveillance
data in the U.S. state of Utah to calculate the incidence
(in 5-year intervals) of suicide deaths in people with ASD
over a 20-year period (1998 to 2017) in total, as well as by
sex, and compared suicide risk in people with versus with-
out ASD. Further, we examined death certificate data on
cases who had an ASD diagnosis and died by suicide
(i.e., ASD + suicide cases) including sex, race, death age,
occupational status, marital status, and manner of death
(i.e., specific suicide method), and compared these charac-
teristics in males versus females. Finally, we compared
characteristics of ASD + suicide cases with other suicide
cases (i.e., non-ASD + suicide cases). Based on existing
research, we hypothesized that suicide incidence would be
significantly higher in the ASD population than in the
non-ASD population. In particular, we anticipated that the
incidence of suicide among females in the ASD population
would be significantly higher than females in the non-
ASD
population.
We
also
hypothesized
that
violent
methods of death would be more frequently used in males
with ASD than females with ASD, and that the frequency
of violent method of death use would be higher in individ-
uals with ASD compared to those without ASD.
This is the first U.S. study to examine incidence of sui-
cide death in a population-based sample of individuals
with and without ASD. By studying completed suicide
(rather than suicidality) among individuals with an iden-
tified ASD diagnosis (rather than autistic traits) in a state
population (rather than using clinical samples), we are
able to reduce potential sources of bias and understand
suicide risk in the U.S. context.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Utah
Registry of Autism and Developmental Disabilities (URADD)
Oversight Committee and the Institutional Review Boards
of the University of Utah, Utah Department of Health, and
Resource for Genetic and Epidemiologic Research Review
Committee, which is an oversight body that regulates Utah
Population Database (UPDB) access. The period of time of
the study was 1998 to 2017, observed in 5-year intervals.
Data Sources
Four sources of existing data were utilized for this study:
URADD statewide autism surveillance data, statewide
INSAR
Kirby et al./Suicide and ASD
659
 suicide surveillance data collected by the Utah Office of
the Medical Examiner (OME), the UPDB, and Utah’s
Indicator-Based Information System for Public Health
(IBIS-PH). URADD and OME data were linked with UPDB
data
internally
by
UPDB
staff
and
identifiers
were
removed prior to analysis by the research team.
Utah registry of autism and developmental dis-
abilities. URADD is a statewide registry of individuals
with an ASD diagnosis. In Utah, ASD is a reportable health
condition under Utah Health Code Chapter 26 Title 7 Sec-
tion 4, which established URADD to conduct state and
population-wide ascertainment for ASD. ASD case status
is determined by URADD based on the presence of a
community-based medical diagnosis of ASD; the electronic
data warehouses of all major healthcare providers in Utah,
including the Utah Department of Health, private/public
clinics and hospitals, and behavioral health centers, are
queried on a biannual basis to identify individuals with an
ASD diagnostic code (i.e., ICD-9 299.X or ICD-10 F48.X).
URADD data was linked to anonymous numeric case
identifiers within the UPDB for this study. All data linking
within the UPDB is secure, using encrypted servers.
Although URADD also ascertains children with ASD based
on an autism special education eligibility, the current ASD
cohort were identified exclusively through the presence of
an ASD diagnosis in medical records.
The URADD data used for this study included 16,904
(76% male, 24% female) total individuals with ASD alive at
the beginning of 1998 and at least 5 years of age in 2013.
The ages of those at least 5 years in 1998 (start of first time
period) ranged from 5–89 (M(SD) = 18.29(14.48)), and in
2013 (start of final time period) ranged from 5–95
(M(SD) = 18.38(12.05)). Race was documented as 72.5%
White, 24.5% Unknown, 1.5% Multiple Races, and < 1%
for all other racial groups, and ethnicity was documented
as 8% Hispanic, 39% not Hispanic, and 53% Unknown.
OME suicide dataset. The Utah OME has had a
research partnership with the University of Utah for two
decades, and maintains data on all suicide deaths in the
state.
Suicide
determination
is
made
by
the
state-
centralized Utah OME using consistent protocols involv-
ing review of detailed investigation of the scene of the
death and circumstances of death, determination of med-
ical conditions by full autopsy, review of medical and
other public records concerning the case, interviews with
survivors, and toxicology (drugs, alcohol, nicotine, etc.).
Suicide determination is given conservatively due to its
impact on survivors. As with URADD data, OME data
from suicide cases were securely linked within the UPDB
to allow matching with ASD case status for this study.
The OME data used for this study included 8,827 (78%
male, 22% female) total individuals who died by suicide
between 1998 and 2017. Their ages at death ranged from
7 to 97 (M(SD) = 41.8(17.3)). Race was documented as
92.3% White, 2.7% Multiple races, 2.2% Unknown, 1.2%
American Indian or Alaska Native, and < 1% for all other
racial groups, and ethnicity was documented as 8%
Hispanic, 80% not Hispanic, and 12% Unknown.
Utah population database. The UPDB is a large, state-
wide database containing demographic, vital records,
medical and genealogical data, and supports research on
genetics, epidemiology, demography, and public health.
The UPDB has been established for over 30 years and
contains death certificate data since 1904. The UPDB can
internally link to other compatible data sources, and has
strict protocols in place to protect data security; the UPDB
links to the OME and URADD datasets. For this study,
birth and death certificate data were also securely linked.
Study investigators were given deidentified data for
analysis.
Utah’s
indicator-based
information
system
for
public health. The final data resource accessed was
whole population statistics for the state of Utah, available
from IBIS-PH (Retrieved 31 May 2018 and 5 December
2018 from the Utah Department of Health, Indicator-
Based Information System for Public Health Web site:
http://ibis.health.utah.gov),
including
the
population
count of individuals over the age of 5 years by sex within
four time periods (1998–2002; 2003–2007; 2008–2012;
2013–2017). We subtracted URADD sample sizes to gener-
ate non-ASD population count. For this study, we did not
have access to detailed demographic data on the entire
population over the 20 year period.
Variables
Variables included in this study from the URADD and
OME suicide datasets were sex (male/female), birth date
(month and year), death date (month and year), age at
death (in years), marital status (never married, married,
other [widowed, divorced, separated, other], missing or
unknown), and occupational status (multiple categories
collapsed into: student, employed, did not work, miss-
ing). Socioeconomic status was examined, but missing
data on employment precluded inclusion. ASD case status
was determined by inclusion in URADD. Suicide case sta-
tus was determined by inclusion in the OME suicide data-
set. Method of death information from death certificates
was categorized two ways, first as violent or nonviolent
and second as firearm-related or not. As they have been
conceptualized elsewhere [e.g., Stenbacka & Jokinen,
2015], methods considered to be violent included fire-
arm/gunshot, hanging or strangulation, and blunt force
injury (e.g., jumping from a high point, stepping in front
of a train), and those considered non-violent included

 poisoning by asphyxiants (e.g., carbon monoxide) and
intoxication (e.g., drug overdose).
Data Analysis
We used R, Version R.3.4.4, and the Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 25, to conduct the data
analysis. Children under the age of 5 at the beginning of
each study interval were not included in the calculations.
Cumulative incidences were calculated within five-year
intervals in the ASD and non-ASD populations, overall
and by sex. RR for suicide in the ASD versus the non-ASD
populations was calculated, overall and by sex; unad-
justed RR was used because we did not have demographic
data on the non-ASD population on the individual level.
Incidence rates, accounting for person-time (years), were
also calculated within five-year intervals in the ASD pop-
ulation; we did not have sufficient data to complete this
analysis in the non-ASD population. Death ages for the
ASD + suicide cases were examined by time period and
sex. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to test for differ-
ences in case characteristics (i.e., sex, race, death age,
marital status, occupational status, method of death)
between males and females and between ASD + suicide
cases and non-ASD + suicide cases.
Based on our results, we conducted additional ana-
lyses to further understand study findings. First, due to
the relatively young ages of suicide cases in the ASD
population and the known issues related to diagnostic
ascertainment of ASD over time, we calculated the
2013–2017 cumulative incidence focused specifically on
young people (5–30 years of age at the beginning of the
time period) in the ASD and non-ASD populations.
Second, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to
determine if age and/or sex explained our findings
related to suicide deaths involving firearms.
Results
Incidence
Cumulative incidences of suicide deaths in the ASD and
non-ASD populations during each five-year time interval,
along with the unadjusted RR, are displayed in Table 1.
In the first 15 years of the study (1998–2012), we did not
observe differences in suicide cumulative incidences
between the ASD and non-ASD populations. For the most
recent time interval (2013–2017), the cumulative inci-
dence of suicide death in the ASD population was 0.17%,
which is significantly higher than the non-ASD popula-
tion cumulative incidence of 0.11% (RR: 1.57 [95% CI:
1.08–2.28]). All seven of the females in the ASD popula-
tion who died by suicide had a death date in the most
recent time interval (2013–2017). Between 2013 and
2017, the cumulative incidence for females in the ASD
population was 0.17%, which is significantly higher than
the female non-ASD population cumulative incidence of
0.05% (RR: 3.43 [95% CI: 1.63–7.23]). We also directly
compared female and male groups in the 2013–2017 time
interval, finding that non-ASD males were significantly
more likely than non-ASD females to die by suicide (RR:
3.15 [95% CI: 2.89–3.44]), but the RR of suicide did not
differ between males and females with ASD (RR: 0.94
[95% CI: 0.40–2.20]). Incidence rates, accounting for
person-years, in the ASD population are displayed in
Table 2. The observed pattern of increase over time is
consistent with the cumulative incidence results. The
highest incidence rate was observed in the 2013–2017
time interval, with an incidence rate of 0.32.
When looking specifically at young people at risk dur-
ing the 2013–2017 time period, we identified a signifi-
cantly higher cumulative incidence of suicide in females
with vs. without ASD (0.15% [95% CI: 0.003–0.302]
vs. 0.03% [95% CI: 0.026–0.035], RR: 5.07 [95% CI:

 1.883–13.636]). In contrast, there not a significant differ-
ence in the cumulative incidence of suicide in males with
vs. without ASD (0.17% [95% CI: 0.083–0.252] vs. 0.11%
[95% CI: 0.083–0.252], RR: 1.56 [95% CI: 0.936–2.603]).
When
looking
at
the
total
population
(males
and
females), the cumulative incidence of suicide among
young people with ASD during 2013–2017 was signifi-
cantly higher than in the non-ASD population (0.16%
[95% CI: 0.09–0.238] vs. 0.07% [95% CI: 0.065–0.074],
RR: 2.38 [95% CI: 1.509–3.744]).
Case Characteristics
In total, we identified 49 individuals with ASD who died by
suicide during the 20-year period. Table 3 contains descrip-
tion of case characteristics and sex differences. There were
seven females (14%) and 42 males (86%). Regarding race,
44 (88%) of the cases were White, five (10%) were multiple
races, and one (2%) was American Indian or Alaska native;
none of the cases were known to be of Hispanic ethnicity
(98% non-Hispanic, 2% unknown). The cases closely reflect
the racial demographics of the state (Utah residents are
90.9% White), though diverge on ethnicity (Utah residents
are 14% Hispanic; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017). Males and
females did not significantly differ regarding death age,
marital status, or occupational status.
In comparison with non-ASD + suicide cases, ASD + sui-
cide cases had significantly younger average death ages
(32.4 years vs. 41.8 years; t = −3.8, P < 0.001). When look-
ing at death ages over time, we identified wider age spans
in the second half of the observed period; the youngest
(14 years) and oldest (70 years) cases died between 2008
and 2017 (see Table 4).
Males and females with ASD did not differ regarding
method of suicide. Combined, 73% of the ASD + suicide
cases used methods for suicide considered to be violent; the
remaining 26% used nonviolent methods. ASD + suicide
cases were equally likely as the non-ASD + suicide group to
use
violent
suicide
methods
(36/49
vs.
6,490/8,414;
χ2 = 0.37, P = 0.54), but significantly less-likely to use fire-
arms as
a
means
of
suicide
(12/49 vs.
4,516/8414;
χ2 = 16.68, P < 0.001). When accounting for death age and
sex, individuals with ASD were still significantly less likely
to use firearms (OR: 0.33 [95% CI: 0.17–0.64]).
Discussion
In this study, we used existing population-wide suicide
and ASD surveillance data to determine the incidence of
suicide among individuals known to have a diagnosis
of ASD in Utah over a 20-year period. Through the use of
unique data resources, we were able to conduct the first

 population-based study of suicide in a U.S. statewide ASD
population. Our study complements existing epidemio-
logical work in Sweden [Hirvikoski et al., 2016]. Our
results reveal lower incidence of suicide death for individ-
uals with ASD than Hirvikoski et al.’s study, which may
reflect differing methods of ascertainment of ASD status
and/or actual differences in suicide rates. Rates could
differ across countries for many reasons that are related
to suicide rate differences in the general population
including environmental factors [Holopainen, Helama,
Björkenstam, & Partonen, 2013], sociocultural factors
[Amitai & Apter, 2012], and service access and provision
[Hester, 2017]. The incident rate identified in this study,
which accounted for person-time, suggested 32 suicides
per 50,000 (6.4 per 10,000) person years in the ASD pop-
ulation during the 2013–2017 period.
Although, we observed slight increases in the inci-
dence of suicide death in the ASD population across
time, the rates were consistent with those in the general
population except in the final time period. The diagnos-
tic criteria for ASD has broadened over time, and ascer-
tainment of accurate ASD diagnosis for those without
ID has improved as well [CDC, 2018]. These changes
could have affected the observed low incidences in the
earlier time periods during which individuals with ASD
without ID were likely to be under-ascertained using a
community-based, administrative records approach, espe-
cially considering Hirvikoski et al.’s [2016] finding that
suicide in individuals with autism occurred more com-
monly among those without ID.
The incidence estimates during the most recent time
interval suggested suicide risk was higher in the ASD
vs. the non-ASD population; however, this difference was
accounted for by females with ASD who died by suicide.
Although there were no documented cases of suicide
death among females with ASD during the first 15 years
of the surveillance period, there was a sharp rise in the
final time period (2013–2017) in which seven females
with ASD completed suicide. The rate during this time
period was equivalent to rates among males with and
without ASD. There is evidence that women, especially
those with higher intellectual functioning, are often
diagnosed with ASD later in life, and some may never
receive a formal diagnosis [Lai, Lombardo, Auyeung,
Chakrabarti, & Baron-Cohen, 2015]. Therefore, autistic
females who died by suicide during the earlier years of
this study may have been disproportionately less likely to
receive an ASD diagnosis. In our analyses focused on
young people during the 2013–2017 period, females with
ASD were found to be over five times more likely to die
by suicide than their non-ASD peers, though the confi-
dence intervals were notably large for this finding.
Our findings related to females with ASD in the most
recent time period (2013–2017) are consistent with those
of Hirvikoski et al. [2016]. Females with ASD have often
been overlooked in research [Lai et al., 2015]; our study
results provide further justification for enhancing focus
on females. Some studies have shown that females with
ASD may face a variety of challenges including sexual
abuse, social difficulties, and conflicts between ASD traits
and feminine identity [Bargiela, Steward, & Mandy,
2016]. Traumatic experiences and identity conflicts are
known risk factors for suicide in the general population.
Further, studies have shown that females may feel the
need and have the ability to “camouflage” or cover-up
their autism symptoms [Bargiela et al., 2016], and one
recent study suggested that these camouflaging behaviors
are
significantly
associated
with
suicidality
in
ASD
[Cassidy, Bradley, Shaw, & Baron-Cohen, 2018].
Unemployment is common among individuals with
ASD, and has been posited to relate to high rates of sui-
cidal behavior [e.g., Pelton & Cassidy, 2017]. Thus, it is
notable that approximately half (49%) of the individuals
with ASD who completed suicide in our sample were
listed on their death certificate to either have an occupa-
tion or be a student (an additional 40% had no data).
These results may imply that individuals with ASD who
are employed or enrolled in school are not necessarily at
lower risk for suicide. Employment is an important prior-
ity for adults with ASD, but based on our findings, we
note that placement in a job should not be viewed as de
facto suicide prevention. Future studies should further
examine employment status with more complete data, as
well as other key factors such as job satisfaction, overall
quality of life, and mental health.
When comparing individuals who died by suicide with
and without ASD, we found that those with ASD were sig-
nificantly younger in age when they died. This may be
related to particular challenges faced by young people with
ASD, such as identity formation and social difficulties, dur-
ing adolescence and the transition to adulthood. Alterna-
tively, this finding may be attributable to fewer older
individuals with diagnoses of ASD resulting from increased
measured prevalence of childhood ASD diagnosis over the
last two decades (CDC, 2018). Emerging research on early
mortality in ASD [e.g., Hirvikoski et al., 2016] may also
contribute to explaining the observed age differences. We

 also looked specifically at risk among young people, and
found that young people with ASD have over twice the risk
of suicide than young people without ASD. Thus, there is a
notable risk among youth with ASD; however, we caution
interpretation that suicide is uniquely a problem for youth
with ASD, and encourage future research to consider risks,
potential causal factors, and prevention methods for older
adults as well.
We also compared method of suicide between individ-
uals with and without ASD. The groups did not differ in
their use of violent and nonviolent methods. Prior
research has suggested that individuals with ASD may
attempt suicide with more lethal means [Kato et al.,
2013] and may use particularly “bizarre acts” (Demirkaya,
Tutkunkardas, & Mukaddes, 2016, p. 2923). In our sam-
ple, we did not see higher rates of violent methods, nor
did we identify approaches that seemed unusual when
comparing ASD versus non-ASD suicide decedent groups.
However, suicide decedents with ASD were significantly
less likely than those without ASD to use firearms as a
method of suicide. This difference was not accounted for
by age at death or sex of the decedents, maintaining a
three-fold reduced risk of firearm use. In 2013, approxi-
mately 31.9% of adults in Utah owned a firearm, slightly
exceeding
the
national
average
of
29.1%
[Kalesan,
Villarreal, Keyes, & Galea, 2016]. Although limiting fire-
arms access is an important suicide prevention approach
for any population [Lewiecki & Miller, 2013], the ASD
group’s use of non-firearm suicide methods merits further
consideration when developing suicide prevention efforts
directed to this population.
Limitations & Future Directions
Despite the strengths of population-based research, there
are limitations to this study. One limitation surrounds
the challenge of complete ascertainment regarding both
ASD and suicide classifications. Suicide can be difficult to
determine, and determinations are made conservatively;
medical examiners are reluctant to label a death as suicide
if uncertain about the individual’s intention to die
[Rocket et al., 2014]. This may especially be the case
among individuals with developmental disabilities such
as ASD, for whom determining intent is no doubt diffi-
cult. Another limitation is that inadequate data on intel-
lectual ability was available to examine the influence ID
may have on suicide risk in individuals with ASD. ASD
classifications may also be limited; not all individuals
who may meet criteria for ASD have received a diagnosis,
particularly among older individuals [Lai & Baron-Cohen,
2015] and females [Loomes, Hull, & Mandy, 2017]. Fur-
ther, we did not have access to additional data that could
have enhanced the study, including data necessary to cal-
culate suicide incidence rates in the non-ASD population,
to control for potential confounders in the incidence
analyses, and to examine additional variables that may
be important, such as socioeconomic status. Finally, case
reports have described individuals who did not receive an
ASD diagnosis until after a suicide attempt [Zahid &
Upthegrove, 2017]. Suicide completion would preempt
such opportunity for diagnosis. Therefore, our data may
under-represent the true incidence of suicide death in the
ASD population.
Future population-based studies should investigate sui-
cidal ideation and suicide attempts in the ASD popula-
tion as well as the influence of co-occurring ID and
psychiatric diagnoses on suicide risk associated with ASD.
Additional research is needed on females with ASD in
particular to determine potential sources of social and
biological influences that could contribute to suicide risk.
Further, while we recognize that there is evidence of mul-
tiple causes of premature mortality in ASD [Bilder et al.,
2013; Hirvikoski et al., 2016; Mandell, 2018], few other
causes of death affect such young individuals in the ASD
population. Over half of the identified suicide death cases
in the ASD population were individuals under age
30, and young people with ASD were found to be at
greater risk than those without ASD. Therefore, better
understanding of suicide risks among young people may
particularly be important for future research.
Conclusion
Using 20 years of surveillance data in Utah, we identified
incidence of suicide among individuals with a diagnosis
of ASD. Findings in the most recent time period suggest
that individuals with ASD may be at higher risk for sui-
cide. This risk is especially pronounced among females.
Additional research is needed to apply population-based
methods to study suicide attempts and ideation in ASD
and to improve understanding of the unique needs of
females with ASD in regards to suicide risk.
