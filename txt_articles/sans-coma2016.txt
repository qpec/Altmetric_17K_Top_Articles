As far as is known, this paper gives the first description of a two-headed shark embryo belonging
to an oviparous species, Galeus atlanticus (Carcharhiniformes: Scyliorhinidae). The specimen was
detected among 797 embryos intended for cardiovascular studies, which represents a defect incidence
of 0·
13%. Each head had a mouth, two eyes, a brain, a notochord and five gill openings on each side.
The two heads fused behind the gills. On the single body, there were four anticipated dorsal fins, two
anterior, right and left and two posterior, right and left. Ventrally, the specimen possessed two pairs
of pectoral fins, a pair of pelvic fins and one anal fin. Two adjacent notochords, two neural tubes and
two dorsal aortas ran along the body, which bent 180∘ at its posterior portion. There were two hearts,
two oesophaguses, two stomachs, two livers, but a single intestine with a spiral valve. Previous reports
of conjoined twins in sharks are scarce and only refer to oviparous and ovoviviparous species. Seven
dicephalous sharks reported so far were similar to the specimen described here, namely, with two totally
separated heads on one body. Instead, only one case of diprosopus shark has been reported; it had a
single body and a single head with partial duplication of the face. Two further cases described in the
literature as dicephalous or simply as abnormal sharks should be better regarded as diprosopus, while
another three cases, also considered dicephalous, showed a mixture of characteristics of diprosopia
and dicephalia.

INTRODUCTION
The term dicephalous designates parapagus (fused side by side) conjoined twins with
two totally separated heads on one body, the anterior (upper in humans) part of which
shows a variable degree of duplication (Bondeson, 2001). Instead, diprosopus, also
known as craniofacial duplication, indicates presence of a single body and a single
head, in which parts or all of the face are duplicated (Okazaki et al., 1987; Hähnel
et al., 2003; Biasibetti et al., 2011).
It is known that, although with a low incidence, two-headed conjoined twins
occur in all major groups of vertebrates (Hevia-Hormazábal et al., 2011). In sharks,
dicephaly has been documented in a limited number of specimens of ovoviviparous and

viviparous species belonging to the orders Squaliformes (Bosinceano, 1934; Lozano
Cabo, 1945) and Carcharhiniformes (Gopalan, 1970; Goto et al., 1981; Delpiani et al.,
2011; Galván-Magaña et al., 2011; Muñoz-Osorio et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2013).
Diprosopia, which is a much less frequent congenital malformation than dicephalia,
has been reported in birds, mammals (Mukaratirwa & Sayi, 2006) and, recently, in a
blue shark Prionace glauca (L. 1758) embryo (Hevia-Hormazábal et al., 2011).
The aim here is to record a two-headed embryo of Atlantic sawtail catshark Galeus
atlanticus (Vaillant 1888), an oviparous species belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae
of the order Carcharhiniformes. Moreover, a review of the literature on dicephalous
and diprosopus sharks has shown that some cases reported as dicephalous should be
better regarded as diprosopus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The two-headed specimen was detected among 797 embryos of G. atlanticus intended for
cardiovascular studies. Fertilized eggs were obtained from adult females collected by scientific
vessels of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in the western Mediterranean (Alboran Sea
and Vera Gulf) in April and May during 2005–2011. The eggs were transferred to the labora-
tory, where they were maintained in perforated plastic cages placed in an indoor 60 l tank with
well aerated seawater. An external filter device kept the water clear, with a temperature rang-
ing between 15 and 18∘ C. Nitrite concentration and water density were monitored during the
experiment. There was no exposure of the eggs to teratogenic agents.
The development of the embryos of G. atlanticus could be well followed by viewing them
through the transparent walls of the egg capsule. This allowed the detection of the two-headed
embryo. The egg was opened and the embryo was carefully removed, over-anaesthetized
with 0·
04% MS-222 (Sigma Chemical Co.; www.sigmaaldrich.com) in elasmobranch buffer
(16·
38 g l−1 NaCl, 0·
89 g l−1 KCl, 1·
11 g l−1 CaCl2, 0·
38 g l−1 NaHCO3, 0·
06 g l−1 NaHPO4 and
21·
6 g l−1 urea, pH 7·
2). Before freeing the embryo from the vitelline sac, it was photographed
with a Leica MZ10F stereomicroscope (www.leica.com), equipped with a Leica DFC500
camera. The degree of development of the embryo was estimated under the stereomicroscope
according to the stages established by Ballard et al. (1993) in the small spotted catshark
Scyliorhinus canicula (L. 1758), which is closely related to G. atlanticus (Rodríguez et al.,
2013).
For comparative purposes, a normal embryo of the same developmental stage was examined
using the same histological protocol. The embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in elas-
mobranch buffer (ratio of fixative to tissue volume was 70:1), dehydrated in a graded series
of ethanol and embedded in paraffin (Histosec; www.merckmillipore.com). They were serially
sectioned in longitudinal orientation, at 8 μm, on a Leitz 1512 microtome (Leica). The sections
were stained with Delafield’
s haematoxylin–eosin. The images were acquired by an Olym-
pus VS120 virtual microscopy slide scanning system (www.olympus.com) equipped with the
VS-ASW software (Olympus) and viewed using the free-of-charge software OlyVIA (Informer
Technologies, Inc.; www.informer.com).

classification, characterized externally by the presence of an incomplete circle of pig-
ment over the eyeballs, whereas no pigment is anywhere else on the body (Fig. 1). At
this stage, the mouth has acquired its curved final shape [Fig. 1(a), (b), (e)].
In the anomalous embryo, the two heads were placed on the right and left. The right
was somewhat longer than the left. In each of them, the nose formed a right angle to the

axis of the body, a trait that also corresponds to stage 29 of Ballard et al. (1993). More-
over, each head showed a normal mouth, two eyes, two nostrils and five pairs of gill
openings, through which several external gill filaments emerged. The heads met behind
the gill openings [Fig. 1(a)–(c)], just posteriorly to two pectoral girdles, each one asso-
ciated with a pair of pectoral fins (Fig. 2). The two adjacent pectoral fins, located at
the vertex formed by the two heads, were fused proximally [Fig. 2(b)]. From this point
backwards, the single body was first straight and then bent through 180∘ [Fig. 1(a)]. On
the ventral side of the straight portion of the body, there were two symmetrical pelvic
fins [Fig. 1(b)]. On the dorsal side of this portion two parallel finfolds, right and left,
were present [Figs 2(a) and 3(a)]. In each fin fold, two anticipated dorsal fins, ante-
rior and posterior, could be recognized, so that overall four developing dorsal fins were
present, two anterior, right and left, and two posterior, right and left. The two fin folds
ran dorsally along the posterior part of the body up to the tip of the tail. From there,
a single ventral finfold extended ventrally [Fig. 3(b)] until reaching the posterior limit
of the cloaca. An indentation in the ventral finfold denoted the posterior limit of the
anticipated anal fin. The present anomalous embryo had a yolk sac and a yolk stalk that
contained the vitelline duct and vitelline vessels [Fig. 1(b)].

In each head of the dicephalous embryo there was a brain [Figs 2 and 3(a)] and

The right heart was placed within a pericardial cavity bounded caudally by a fully
developed transverse septum, whereas the left heart was not totally enclosed in its
cardiac cavity because the left transverse septum was incomplete [Fig. 3(a)]. There
were two oesophaguses, two stomachs and two livers [Fig. 3(a)]. The pyloric regions
of the stomachs merged, giving rise to a single, complete intestine that contained a

single spiral valve [Fig. 3(a)]. The two notochords did not bind; they ran parallel,
each accompanied by its corresponding neural tube, until the caudal part of the ani-
mal [Fig. 2(a)]. Two dorsal aortas ran along the single body of the embryo [Fig. 3(a),
(b)]. Below the notochords there was a single pair of developing kidneys [Figs 2(a) and
3(a)] and a single pair of gonadal ridges [Fig. 2(a)]. Images of a normal embryo for bet-
ter understanding of the anomalies detected in the two-headed specimen are shown in
Figs 1(d), (e) and 3(c), (d).
DISCUSSION
The dicephalous and diprosopus sharks reported so far belonged to viviparous and
ovoviviparous species. Most specimens were embryos found incidentally in pregnant
females. Thus, this paper is the first to describe the occurrence of dicephalia in an
oviparous shark, specifically G. atlanticus.
The two-headed embryo was detected in the laboratory where eggs are regularly
kept in standardized conditions for embryological cardiovascular studies. Of the 797
embryos examined, the anomalous specimen represents a defect incidence of 0·
13%,
which seems to be the first estimation of the frequency of dicephalia in sharks. This
value, however, should be taken with caution since it refers to a single species. The data
in the literature about the incidence of dicephalia in different vertebrate taxa are notably
divergent because they usually result from grouping different types of conjoined twins
(Logroño et al., 1997; Vanderzon et al., 1998; Bondeson, 2001; Hähnel et al., 2003).
This abnormal embryo was unequivocally dicephalous as it had two totally sepa-
rated heads that merged just behind the gills. From this point there was a single body,
traversed by two notochords, two neural tubes and two dorsal aortas. Organs and vis-
cera, such as the heart, liver and stomach, were duplicated. Instead, there was a single
intestine, two kidneys and two gonadal ridges as in normal sharks. Externally, the devel-
oping dorsal fins and pectoral fins were duplicated, whereas there was only one pair of
pelvic fins and a single anal fin.
In reviewing the literature on two-headed sharks, seven cases were found resembling
the dicephalous specimen reported here. One of these cases was a squalomorph; the
other six were galeomorphs (Table I). Although the accuracy of the descriptions differs
considerably among the authors, there seems to be no doubt that the seven specimens
can be considered genuinely dicephalous, each having two fully differentiated heads
on a single body.
Hevia-Hormazábal et al. (2011) reported the finding of a foetus of P. glauca,
which they described as diprosopus tetrophthalmus (Table I). Unlike the preceding
dicephalous specimens, the diprosopus fish had a partial craniofacial duplication, with
four eyes and four nostrils. The chondrocranium and the upper jaws were normal,
but the oral cavities were interconnected and converge in a single pharynx. There
was a single vertebral column, which had a thoracic lordosis and a helical torsion in
its caudal portion. According to the authors, their paper was the first to describe a
diprosopus shark. Two cases which had been described as dicephalous some years
before, however, should be better considered diprosopus (Table I). The first case is that
of the embryo of a picked shark Squalus acanthias L. 1758 reported by Bosinceano
(1934). The anomalous specimen showed duplication of several facial structures (eyes,
noses, nostrils and mouths), but it had only one chondrocranium and two spiracles,

right and left, of gill openings. Interestingly, the single body was twisted helically, a
condition which can be well seen in both the photograph and drawing of the specimen
included in the paper of Bosinceano (1934). The second case is that of the anomalous
foetus of P. glauca reported by Mancini et al. (2006). The animal had a single head
with two mouth openings. In addition, its trunk was rolled from the pelvic to the
caudal fin.
Two of the three embryos of P. glauca were correctly diagnosed as dicephalous
by Goto et al. (1981). The individuals were designated by the authors as Chosi and
Kumanonada specimens, according to their respective geographical origins. A further
two anomalous embryos, which they referred to as Torishima and Sendai specimens,
had duplicated facial structures and two vertebral columns in the cranial portion which
fused into one in the caudal region of the animal. The body was twisted helically, similar
to the diprosopus embryos mentioned above (Table I).
A particular case of an anomalous shark described as dicephalous is that recorded
by Muñoz-Osorio et al. (2013). It was the embryo of a smalltail shark Carcharhinus
porosus (Ranzani 1839), which had a single body, with normal fins and two heads
which originated anterior to the gills (Table I). Each head had a mouth, a single gill
opening and two eyes. The attachment site of the heads was in the back of the skull.
The body of the embryo was supported by a well-developed vertebral column. Another
under-developed vertebral column, however, ran along the whole body, which showed
no helical winding. Thus, the anomalous specimen shared characteristics, such as dupli-
cation of several facial elements, suggesting a diprosopus condition and the presence
of two vertebral columns, which rather points to dicephalia.
Only eight of the 14 conjoined twin sharks reported so far can be considered
truly dicephalous. A further three anomalous animals, including that reported by
Hevia-Hormazábal et al. (2011) should be better regarded as diprosopus. The remain-
ing three cases were possibly dicephalous, but it is difficult to give a convincing
diagnosis. These data are summarized in Table I.
It is generally assumed that conjoined twins result from incomplete splitting of
the embryonic axis (Kaufman, 2004). Fusion of monozygotic twins, as suggested by
Spencer (1992), is no longer believed to be the base of this congenital malformation
(Kaufman, 2004; Biasibetti et al., 2011). Several factors, such as genetic predisposi-
tion, viral infections, metabolic disorders and environmental alterations, have been
adduced as possible causes of conjoined twinning (Kaufman, 2004; Biasibetti et al.,
2011). Moreover, experimental studies have been conducted with more or less success
to induce the development of conjoined twins (Kaufman, 2004). The aetiology of
conjoined twinning and thus, of dicephaly, however, is still uncertain. In this context,
it should be emphasized that the dicephalous embryo of G. atlanticus reported here
developed under identical environmental conditions as the other embryos, none of
which showed malformations. Moreover, there was no known exposure of the embryos
to teratogenic agents. On this basis, an intrinsic, i.e. genetic, disorder seems to be the
most plausible cause of maldevelopment.
Diprosopia was initially described as a subtype of symmetrical twinning, resulting
from a minimal fission of the cephalic end (Pavone et al., 1987). A divergence occur-
ring just at this site of the embryo would lead to monocephalous diprosopia, while a
more caudal divergence would lead to dicephalous twins (Machin & Sperber, 1987).
This notion, however, is doubtful since the true morphogenetic cause or causes of
craniofacial duplications remain uncertain (Costa et al., 2014). As summarized by

these authors, several developmental errors have been suggested as producing diproso-
pus twins, including duplication of elements derived from the first branchial arch
(McLaughlin, 1949; Maisels, 1981); split notochord complex (Morton, 1957; Avery &
Hayward, 1969); sequestration of totipotent cells (Davies et al., 1973); forking of the
notochord; duplications of embryonic structures such as the prosencephalon, the olfac-
tory placodes and the maxillary; mandibular growth centres around the margins of the
stomatodeal plate (Barr, 1982) and duplication of neural crest derivatives (Carles et al.,
1995). Exogenous factors such as hyperthermia, hypoxia, nutritional deficiencies, viral
infections, toxins, drugs and chemicals have been proposed as potential inducers of the
pathogenetic mechanisms causing diprosopia (Mukaratirwa & Sayi, 2006). Moreover,
genetically encoded morphogenetic disorders have been adduced as possible causes
of facial malformations (Mukaratirwa & Sayi, 2006; Costa et al., 2014). Mutation of
dlx homeobox genes expressed by neural crest cells (Young et al., 2000; Depew et al.,
2002; Heude et al., 2010) might lead to duplication of craniofacial elements (Costa
et al., 2014). In addition, it has been suggested that an increased production of sonic
hedgehog (SHH) protein may be involved in the formation of diprosopus individuals
(Onankpa et al., 2014). It is known that disruption in SHH signalling during facial
morphogenesis can perturb mediolateral patterning at the neural plate, resulting in
holoprosencephaly and cyclopia (Hu & Helms, 1999). In contrast, increasing SHH in
the frontonasal process promotes mediolateral expansion of the face (hypertelorism).
Experimental studies on chick Gallus gallus embryos have demonstrated that the most
severe cases of hypertelorism also exhibit apparent duplications of the midline facial
structures (Hu & Helms, 1999; Young et al., 2000). A fact that deserves a comment
is that in the diprosopus sharks, the single vertebral column was rolled helically. The
concurrence of both malformations does not seem a purely random event, at least in
free-living sharks. It rather points to a common aetiology based on morphogenetic
disorders inherent to the individual and not to the product of exogenous factors.
The possible morphogenetic relationship between dicephalia and diprosopia remains
an open question. The Torishima and Sendal embryos reported by Goto et al. (1981)
and the specimen described by Muñoz-Osorio et al. (2013) suggest a possible aetio-
logic link between both malformations. Further information on these defects in differ-
ent groups of vertebrates, however, is needed to shed more light on this issue.
