Abstract
This study examined whether additional information on parents’ employment and household 
characteristics would help explain the differences in children’s UTD vaccination status using the 
2008 National Immunization Survey and its associated Socioeconomic Status Module. After 
controlling for basic sociodemographic factors in multivariable analyses, parent’s work schedules 
and ease of taking time off from work were not associated with UTD vaccination status among 19- 
to 35-month-old children. We also conducted a stratified analysis to test the heterogeneous effects 
of the factors among children at three age-restricted maternal education levels and found the 
benefit of paid sick leave had a significant association only among families where the mother had 
a college degree. Families who had moved since the child’s birth, especially if the mother had high 
school or lower education, were less likely to have children UTD on the vaccine series.

Introduction
The 2014–2015 measles outbreak in California reminds us of the importance of timely 
vaccination1–3. While many factors influence children’s up-to-date (UTD) vaccination 
status, commonly used explanatory variables are frequently limited to demographic and 
basic socioeconomic factors, such as race, family income, parents’ education, employment 
status, and insurance type4–9. Studies on parental delay or refusal of their children’s 
vaccination found parents’ perceptions, beliefs, and concerns of vaccination strongly 
influenced timely vaccination4–5. Parents’ work schedules and time conflicts, as one might

 think of, were not one of the reasons that parents delay their children’s vaccination. There is 
little direct evidence on the extent to which parents’ work schedules and time availability 
would affect children’s UTD vaccination status, despite some indirect evidence was found to 
indicate the connection. One study suggested that flexibility in scheduling an appointment 
might help urban families keep immunization visits6. A limited number of studies on 
maternal leaves or paid sick leaves confirm that earned sick days help workers and their 
children access to preventive care10–14. The scarcity of studies on parents’ work schedule 
and children’s vaccination status might be partially due to the lack of data. Detailed 
information on parent work schedule and ease of taking time off are rare. This study 
exploited novel data from the 2008 National Immunization Survey (NIS) and its associated 
Socioeconomic Status (SES) module and explored whether the additional information on 
parent employment and household characteristics would help explain the differences in 
children’s UTD vaccination status. The NIS-SES module was incorporated into the NIS only 
in 2008. The data allowed us to consider additional factors such as parent’s work schedule, 
ease of taking leave from work, availability of paid sick leave, and family mobility in 
addition to the traditional sociodemographic characteristics. While the distribution of 
employment and other characteristics among parents has likely changed since these data 
were collected, we would expect the association between such factors and children’s 
vaccination status to remain relatively constant. We examined the association between these 
variables and children’s UTD status based on completion of the combined (4:3:1:3:3:1:4) 
vaccine series of ≥4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, ≥3 
doses of poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; ≥3 doses of 
Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine; ≥1 dose of varicella 
vaccine; and ≥4 doses of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The conclusions 
drawn from this analysis could expand the understanding of the influence of parent 
employment and socioeconomic and household characteristics on vaccination. These data 
may also shed light on issues related to delayed or missed vaccinations15.
Methods
Study sample
Data from the NIS SES module, administered January through June 2008, were analyzed in 
conjunction with data from the 2008 NIS. The NIS is a nationally representative random-
digit-dialed telephone survey of households with children aged 19–35 months used to 
monitor childhood vaccination coverage. Household interviews with the child’s parent or 
guardian are followed by a mailed survey to the child’s vaccination providers (with consent 
of the respondent) to obtain provider-reported vaccination histories. Data are weighted to 
adjust for households with multiple telephone lines, household nonresponse, and exclusion 
of households without telephones16. The SES module, which was included in the NIS in 
2008 (but no other years), collected additional employment and socioeconomic status 
information from primary caregiver of children aged 19 to 35 months. Module questions 
were answered from the perspective of this person. For the children included in this analysis, 
over 95% of the primary caregivers were parents. For simplicity, we refer to all primary 
caregivers as parents, although a small proportion were identified as grandparents, other 
family members, friends, etc. There were 8,768 parents that completed the SES module and

 7,450 (85%) children had adequate provider-reported vaccination records and were assigned 
final weights. We restricted this analysis to children who had adequate provider data and 
whose responding parent reported s/he was employed based upon a positive response to the 
question “Are you currently employed?” Information on number of hours worked per week 
was not collected; therefore, we were unable to distinguish part-time from full-time 
employment. In total, 4,160 out of the 7,450 children (56% of the sample) had a responding 
parent that was employed and were included in the analysis.
Vaccination UTD status
Based on the ACIP-recommended vaccine schedule in place during the survey period, 
sampled children were determined to be UTD if their provider-reported vaccination history 
included ≥4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, ≥3 doses of 
poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; ≥3 doses of Haemophilus 
influenzae type b vaccine; ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine; ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine; and 
≥4 doses of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. This is referred to as the 
combined (4:3:1:3:3:1:4) vaccine series17.
Additional employment and socioeconomic measures
In addition to traditional sociodemographic variables (child’s gender, child’s age, mother’s 
racial/ethnic group, mother’s education, number of children under 18 years in the household, 
family income, and insurance status), we also included in this analysis the parent’s ease of 
taking leave from work, work schedule, the availability of paid sick leave, family mobility, 
child care participation, and parent’s concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness. Ease 
of taking time off from work was assessed with the question “In general, how easy is it for 
you to take time off from your job?” Respondents were asked to choose from “very easy”, 
“somewhat easy”, “somewhat hard”, “very hard to do”, or “impossible”.
For our analyses, we collapsed the responses into two levels –easy (very or somewhat easy) 
and hard (somewhat or very hard or impossible). Work schedule was classified into three 
categories — daytime, nighttime or evening, or other schedules, such as rotating shifts. The 
availability of paid sick leave was determined by asking whether the parent was able to take 
time off from work and still be paid if s/he or another family member was sick. To measure 
family mobility, we determined the number of times the family had moved since the child’s 
birth and whether moves were in-state or out-of-state. We analyzed mobility since the 
child’s birth using three categories — never moved, out-of-state move, and in-state move. 
Child care participation was defined as attending a child care center or day care at least once 
a week during the past month. Parents were asked whether they had ever refused or delayed 
administration of a particular vaccine; those that responded in the affirmative (n=720; 17.3% 
of the sample) were asked an open-ended question as to their reason(s) for this decision. 
Responses were reviewed, and parents were considered to have safety/effectiveness concerns 
if they explicitly mentioned safety or effectiveness as the reason or if their response was 
related to: perceived risk of intussusception or autism, concerns about thimerosal or 
mercury, having heard or read bad things in the media, concern about there being too many 
shots, fear of side effects, having other children who experienced a reaction to a vaccine, an 
assertion that the child is healthy, or a report that the child had an egg allergy. Those who

 provided an explanation not deemed to be related to safety or effectiveness (e.g. cost or 
inability to get an appointment) and those that did not refuse/delay any vaccinations were 
considered to not have safety / effectiveness concerns.
Statistical Analyses
Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between child’s UTD status and the 
work-related variables, after controlling for basic sociodemographic characteristics. Among 
children with adequate provider data and an employed parent, we first conducted bivariable 
analyses to examine the association between UTD status and each of the individual 
socioeconomic and work-related variables (see Table 1 for a full list of variables); we then 
conducted multivariable analyses. We also performed a stratified analysis by mother’s age-
restricted education level. Children with mothers aged 20 and above were stratified into 
three groups—mothers who had received college degrees, mothers who had some college, 
and mothers with high school or lower education. We restricted mother’s age to 20 and 
above, since individuals of these ages are old enough to complete or have some college 
education. We did not consider mothers aged 19 or below as a separate group, because the 
sample size of this group was too small (n=22) and many variables had missing values. In all 
multivariable analyses, we also included state fixed effects to control for any unobservable 
variation across states. Prevalence ratios of the estimates were reported because of the cross-
sectional study design18.
Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 11.0 (Research Triangle 
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), a statistical package that accounts for complex, 
weighted survey designs when calculating variances. All estimates in the analysis were 
weighted to be representative of the geographic area of the sample and nationally.
Results
Descriptive statistics for all characteristics included in the analysis for children aged 19 to 35 
months with adequate provider data and an employed parent in the 2008 NIS-SES module 
are presented in Table 1. Numbers of observations (unweighted), weighted percentages, and 
95% confidence intervals are reported by UTD status. Statistically significant differences in 
percentages of various categories of each variable were evaluated using Chi-square tests. 
There were 2,981 children (72%) UTD and 1,179 (28%) not UTD. There were no 
statistically significant differences in UTD status by child’s gender, mother’s race/ethnicity, 
responding parent’s ease of taking leave, or work schedule (all p-values>0.10). However, 
UTD children appeared to be older, had a higher percentage of being insured, with more-
educated mothers, and with a higher percentage of child care participation than children who 
were not UTD. Among parents of the UTD children, a higher percentage, relative to those of 
the not-UTD children, had access to paid sick leave, while a lower percentage had concerns 
about vaccine safety/effectiveness. UTD children also tended to live in households with 
fewer children, higher incomes, and less mobility, compared to children who were not UTD 
(all p-values<0.05).
The association between child’s UTD status and social factors was examined in bivariable as 
well as multivariable logistic regressions (Table 2). Some factors showed a significant

 association (p-value<0.05) with UTD status in the bivariable analysis but not in the 
multivariable analysis, including mother being black, mother having a high school diploma, 
being in the highest income group (income-to-poverty ratio greater than or equal to 4), child 
care participation, and no paid sick leave. In both bivariable and multivariable models, 
uninsured children, children of mothers with less than high school education, children from 
families with four or more children in the household or those who had moved within or out 
of state, and children with parents who had concerns about vaccine safety/effectiveness were 
less likely to be UTD on the vaccine series.
We further stratified the sample by mother’s age-restricted education level and examined 
whether the effects of the factors varied by subgroup. In Table 3, results of the stratified 
analysis among mothers aged 20 or above at three education levels are reported. More 
significant associations were identified among mothers aged 20 and above with college 
degrees compared to less-educated mothers. This group also had the most observations 
among the three groups. In the regression among this group, child’s age, insurance status, 
and parent’s concerns about vaccine safety/effectiveness were significantly associated with 
UTD status, which was the same as in the overall multivariable results (Table 2). Children of 
black mothers, higher family income, represented by greater income-to-poverty ratios, or 
children of parents without paid sick leave were less likely to be UTD compared to the 
reference. Results for children of mothers in the two lower maternal education groups 
varied. Children aged 30–35 months were still more likely to be UTD, but not those 24–29 
months among mothers with some college education. For children of mothers aged 20 and 
above with some college, uninsured children or children whose parent had concerns about 
vaccine safety/effectiveness were still less likely to be UTD compared to the reference. All 
other factors failed to show a statistically significant association with children’s UTD status 
in this group. For children of mothers aged 20 and above with high school education or less, 
uninsured status or parent’s concerns about vaccine safety/effectiveness were no longer 
associated with UTD status. However, family mobility significantly lowered the likelihood 
of being UTD with vaccination.
Discussion
Although one might expect that parents who felt it was hard to take leave from work or 
always had day-time work schedules would experience difficulties in keeping their young 
children UTD on vaccinations. However, our results based on NIS-SES module data did not 
show such an association among children aged 19 to 35 months. Availability of paid sick 
leave was associated with UTD status only among children of mothers aged 20 years or 
above with college degrees, but not among children of mothers age 20 or above with less 
education. Children who experienced residential moves, regardless of whether with-in-state 
or out-of-state moves, were less likely to be UTD than those that did not move. The 
association was significant and strongest among children of mothers with the lowest 
education level and may reflect the challenge of keeping accurate vaccination records when 
multiple providers are involved. Parents’ concerns about vaccine safety/effectiveness 
appeared to be a strong predictor of lower likelihood of being UTD on the combined 
4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series, except among children of mothers with the lowest education. This might 
be expected, given that, by definition, those categorized as having safety/effectiveness

 concerns refused or delayed at least one vaccine. It is not known, however, whether the 
vaccine(s) refused or delayed were part of the combined series. This relationship should be 
examined in greater detail, with vaccine-specific data. In almost all regression analyses, 
children in older age groups had a higher likelihood of being UTD. A possible explanation 
is, as children get older, there is more time for parents to catch up with vaccine schedules. 
Child care participation was not significantly associated with UTD status after controlling 
for other factors in multivariable analyses. Family income, as a traditional socioeconomic 
measure, did not have a significant association with UTD status among children of mothers 
aged 20 or above with less-than-college education. For children of mothers aged 20 or above 
with college degrees, income was found to be negatively associated with UTD status. It is 
possible that income accounted for the effects of some unobserved variables in this group. In 
the multivariable analysis based on the whole sample (Table 2), income was not significant 
when we included mother’s education as a covariate.
The heterogeneous effects of factors shown in the stratified analysis also have some program 
implementation implications. Vaccination programs targeting different sociodemographic 
groups may need to adjust their strategies according to different risk factors. Among parents 
with college education, more efforts would be needed to address their concerns about 
vaccine safety/effectiveness, which was negatively related to UTD status. For mothers with a 
high school education or less, more mobile families and those with more children appear to 
have faced challenges in obtaining all the necessary childhood vaccinations. Additional 
research is needed to identify the particular needs of this subpopulation.
This study is subject to several limitations. First, data collected in 2008 may not reflect 
current employment, sociodemographic, and household characteristics of parents with young 
children. However, relationships between these characteristics and the children’s vaccination 
status would not be expected to vary dramatically over this time. Many of the factors 
associated with UTD status, such as family mobility, insurance status, and parental concerns, 
have been observed in other studies. The lack of association with parental paid sick leave 
and work schedules was not anticipated and requires further study. One previous work10 
described the association of paid leave and vaccination among employees, rather than that 
among employees’ children. Three other studies11,12,14 looked at the effect of maternity 
leave on the uptake of vaccines recommended for newborns and infants. There is little 
available information on the relationship between parental leave and vaccination among 
young children more than 1-year-old. The NIS-SES module data are among the most 
comprehensive available for this purpose. Another potential limitation is that employment 
factors used in this study were based on information only as it related to the child’s primary 
caregiver. Employment data on other adult household members were not collected and thus 
were not available to our analysis. Also, the survey assessed employment status at the time 
of the interview, not necessarily at the time that the child was due to receive vaccinations. 
Our UTD definition was based on the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 vaccine series, which was also used in 
national vaccination coverage estimates using NIS data15. We did not include influenza and 
hepatitis A vaccines. Coverage rates could differ if these two additional vaccines were 
included. Additionally, vaccination histories may be incomplete if not all relevant providers 
were contacted and able to return accurate vaccination information. Finally, nonresponse 
bias may remain even after the weighting adjustment.

 Conclusion
Our findings based on the 2008 NIS-SES module revealed associations between a variety of 
social factors and vaccination UTD status of children aged 19 to 35 months. Family 
mobility, parents’ concerns about vaccine safety, number of children in the household, 
child’s age, and insurance status were strongly associated with UTD vaccination status. Few 
associations were found between parental employment and UTD vaccination status. 
Different sociodemographic groups had different risk factors for vaccination. Results could 
help expand the understanding of barriers to UTD vaccination status among young children 
with working parents. Future research may look at children of other age groups and examine 
whether parental employment has a stronger association with UTD status among older 
children.

aThe 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 vaccine series includes ≥4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and any acellular pertussis vaccine including diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine or diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and 
pertussis vaccine, ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; ≥3 doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine; ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine; 
and ≥4 doses of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
bDue to small sample size, the estimates were not reported.
cWald-F statistics and p-values from the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodnessness of fit tests were reported. The null phypothesis is that the observed number of events in a given group is equal to the predicted 
number of events in the same group, across all groups. Larger p-values indicate the null hypothesis is not rejected and the model is good fit for the data.
