 How Strongly Does Appetite Counter Weight Loss?
Quantification of the Feedback Control
of Human Energy Intake
David Polidori1, Arjun Sanghvi2, Randy J. Seeley3, and Kevin D. Hall2
Objective: To quantify the feedback control of energy intake in response to long-term covert manipula-
tion of energy balance in free-living humans.
Methods: A validated mathematical method was used to calculate energy intake changes during a 52-
week placebo-controlled trial in 153 patients treated with canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter
inhibitor that increases urinary glucose excretion, thereby resulting in weight loss without patients being
directly aware of the energy deficit. The relationship between the body weight time course and the calcu-
lated energy intake changes was analyzed using principles from engineering control theory.
Results: It was discovered that weight loss leads to a proportional increase in appetite resulting in eating
above baseline by �100 kcal/day per kilogram of lost weight—an amount more than threefold larger than
the corresponding energy expenditure adaptations.
Conclusions: While energy expenditure adaptations have often been considered the main reason for
slowing of weight loss and subsequent regain, feedback control of energy intake plays an even larger
role and helps explain why long-term maintenance of a reduced body weight is so difficult.

Introduction
Body weight is believed to be regulated by feedback control of both
energy intake and energy expenditure. Several experiments in humans
have quantified how energy expenditure adapts in response to altera-
tions of energy intake and body weight. For example, Leibel et al.
found energy expenditure adaptations of several hundreds of kilocalo-
ries per day acting to resist weight loss (1). In contrast, energy intake
adaptations have yet to be accurately quantified in humans despite the
widespread belief that feedback control of energy intake is critical for
body weight regulation and acts as part of a complex neurobiological
system to determine overall human food intake behavior (2).
Why has the assessment of human energy intake feedback control
lagged the quantification of energy expenditure changes with weight
loss? First, we lacked the ability to accurately measure changes in
free-living energy intake in large numbers of people over extended
time periods. While accurate energy intake measurements can be
performed while subjects are housed in laboratory settings, such
studies are typically of short duration, and the artificial nature of the
environment makes it difficult to translate the results to the real
world (3). Indeed, free-living energy intake is known to fluctuate
widely from day to day and exhibits little short-term correlation
with energy expenditure or body weight (4). Therefore, observations
over long time scales are required, thereby making laboratory-based
studies impractical.
Unfortunately, free-living subjects are notorious for being unable to
provide accurate estimates of energy intake using self-report meth-
ods (5), and the expense and difficulty of employing objective bio-
marker methods severely limit their applicability. To address this
important problem, we recently validated an inexpensive mathemati-
cal method for calculating energy intake changes using repeated
body weight data in 140 free-living subjects over a 2-year calorie
restriction study and found that the mean calculated energy intake

 changes were within 40 kcal/day of those determined using an
expensive biomarker method (6).
The second impediment to quantifying energy intake control in
humans is that we lacked an intervention that increases energy out-
put by a known amount without participants consciously knowing
that this is occurring. Rather, most interventions that alter body
weight or energy expenditure also evoke cognitive responses that
may mask the effect of weight changes per se on the feedback con-
trol of energy intake. For example, engaging in an exercise program
might increase energy expenditure and lead to weight loss, but exer-
cise is a conscious behavior that does not have an effective placebo
control. Furthermore, exercise has a complex role in modulating
appetite (7) and may induce compensatory changes in other compo-
nents of total energy expenditure that are difficult to quantify.
Therefore, changes in energy intake during an exercise program may
not solely be due to feedback mechanisms controlling body weight
but are likely to also involve conscious changes in behavior.
Here, we used data from a placebo-controlled trial in patients with
type 2 diabetes who were treated for 1 year with canagliflozin, an
inhibitor of sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), thereby increas-
ing energy output in the form of urinary glucose excretion (UGE)
(8). In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with canagliflozin at
a dose of 300 mg/day increases mean daily UGE by approximately
90 g/day which is sustained at the same level throughout the dura-
tion of treatment (9) without directly altering energy expenditure
(10,11) or central pathways controlling energy intake and without
the patients being directly aware of the energy deficit. In other
words, SGLT2 inhibition provides a novel way to covertly perturb
human energy balance that largely bypasses the volition and con-
scious awareness of the subjects. Any observed increased energy
intake countering the weight loss induced by SGLT2 inhibition
therefore likely reflects the activity of the feedback control system.
We calculated the free-living energy intake changes in 153 patients
treated with 300 mg/day canagliflozin over a 52-week trial using the
measured body weight data and an assumed mean UGE of 90 g/day
as inputs to a mathematical model that has recently been validated
against an expensive biomarker method (6). We found that the feed-
back control of energy intake in humans was proportional to the
amount of weight lost and was substantially stronger than the con-
trol of energy expenditure.
Methods
Calculating changes in energy intake during
canagliflozin treatment
We used measured body weight, BW, and baseline patient character-
istics in the previously published placebo-controlled trail of canagli-
flozin (8). We calculated the changes in energy intake, DEI, for
each subject using a validated mathematical method (6) using the
following equation:
DEIi5q dBWi
dt
1eðBWi2BW0Þ1
Dd
12b
ð
Þ BW01UGE
(1)
The inputs to the model were the change of body weight versus
baseline over each interval,
BWi2BW0
ð
Þ, and the moving average
of the measured body weight time course was used to calculate the
rate of change of body weight over each interval, dBWi/dt. The
interval length was t 5 (N 2 1) 3 T, where N 5 2 was the number
of body weight measurements per interval and T 5 52 was the num-
ber of days between measurements. Three subjects treated canagli-
flozin and two subjects treated with placebo had missing body
weight data at one time point, and linear interpolation was used to
impute the missing data.
Equation (1) is a linearization of a mathematical model of adult
body weight dynamics that was developed and validated using data
obtained primarily from controlled feeding studies in adult humans
with longitudinal measurements of changes in body composition as
well as both resting and total energy expenditure (12-14). The model
parameter q was the effective energy density associated with the
body weight change:

The model parameters cFFM and cFM are the regression coefficients
relating resting metabolic rate to fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass
(FM), respectively. Parameters qFM and qFFM are the energy den-
sities associated with changes in FM and FFM, respectively. Most
physical activities involve locomotion and have an energy cost that
is proportional to body weight for a given intensity and duration of
activity. The baseline physical activity parameter was d0 and Dd
represents changes in physical activity that can be informed by
objective measurements, if available. Without such measurements,
physical activity changes are often assumed to be zero (Dd 5 0)
with the realization that the calculated energy intake changes may
be in error, especially at the individual level where substantial phys-
ical activity changes can occur throughout a study. Averaging over
many individuals with the assumption that Dd 5 0 can also result in
a biased mean energy intake change of the group, but our previous
validation study demonstrated that this bias is likely to be <40 kcal/
day when studying >100 individuals (6).
The parameter b accounts for the adaptation of energy expenditure
during a diet perturbation, DEI, and was determined using data from
eight human studies that measured changes in body composition as
well as both total and resting energy expenditure before and after
achieving a period of long-term stability at a lower weight (13).
Parameters gFM and gFFM account for the biochemical cost of tissue
deposition and turnover assuming that the change of FFM is primar-
ily accounted for by body protein and its associated water.
The parameter a represents the relationship between changes of lean
and fat mass: a � dFFM=dFM5C=FM where C 5 10.4 kg is the
Forbes parameter. This simple model of body composition change
provides accurate predictions that have been demonstrated to be
consistent across different ethnic groups and sexes (15). For modest
weight changes, a can be considered to be approximately constant
with FM fixed at its initial value FM0. The larger the initial fat
mass, FM0, the smaller the parameter a, as previously described
(14). The parameter UGE represents the energy losses as a result of

 increased urinary excretion of glucose with canagliflozin treatment.
Model parameter values are given in Table 1.
In addition to validating our mathematical model using body compo-
sition and energy expenditure data from controlled feeding studies
(12-14), the model has also demonstrated accurate weight loss pre-
dictions regardless of medication usage or comorbid conditions,
including type 2 diabetes, in free-living individuals with obesity fol-
lowing reduced calorie diets (16).
Modeling feedback control of energy intake
While many hormonal and neuronal factors are known to be
involved in the regulation of food intake (2), general properties of
the feedback relationship between changes in body weight and
changes in energy intake have not been well characterized or quanti-
fied. We tested the ability of two potential feedback models to
describe the observed body weight profiles in response to sustained
canagliflozin treatment.
In the first model, referred to as “proportional control,” changes in
the signals regulating food intake depend only on the current body
weight and are not dependent on the duration or rate of weight loss.
In this model, the aggregate effects of different feedback signals
regulating body weight are described by the equation:
DEI t
ð Þ52kP3DBW t
ð Þ
(4)
where the parameter kP > 0 quantifies the feedback strength. To sim-
ulate how proportional control of energy intake affects body weight
kinetics during canagliflozin treatment, we added a UGE term to a
validated mathematical model of adult human body weight dynam-
ics (14) and calculated the mean DEI time course during placebo
treatment to capture the typical weight loss effect of being in the
trial (see Figure 1). Equation (4) was then added to the placebo
energy intake to simulate the mean proportional control of DEI dur-
ing canagliflozin treatment. The best fit parameter kP was deter-
mined by a downhill simplex algorithm implemented using Berkeley
Madonna software (version 8.3; http://www.berkeleymadonna.com)
to minimize the sum of squares residuals between the simulation
outputs and the measured mean body weight and the calculated
mean DEI.
We also investigated another possible model for body weight regula-
tion that was previously suggested (17) such that changes in energy
intake also depend on how long body weight has deviated from
baseline, which is expressed as an integral term quantified by a
parameter kI >0:

Results
Table 2 represents the characteristics of the type 2 diabetic subjects
who completed the 52-week study and had body weight measurements
throughout. The full study cohort was previously reported (8). In
response to the sustained increase in UGE with canagliflozin treat-
ment, mean body weight declined and reached a new equilibrium sev-
eral kilograms lower and significantly more than the placebo group
whose mean body weight loss was less than 1 kg (Figure 1A). To
explain the measured body weight changes in the treatment group
given the estimated increases in UGE, energy intake was calculated to
have increased by �350 kcal/day at steady state (Figure 1B) which is
similar to recent estimates of the mean energy intake changes during
90 weeks of empagliflozin treatment, another SGLT2 inhibitor (18).
In the placebo group, mean energy intake was calculated to transiently
decrease by �100 kcal/day over the first several weeks and return to
near baseline after 15 weeks (Figure 1B).
Note that as body weight declined during SGLT2 inhibition, energy
intake increased above baseline until it compensated for the loss of
calories via UGE, after which, a new equilibrium was reached. This
general pattern of response, in which a sustained perturbation (caloric
loss via UGE) leads to a new equilibrium at a lower body weight, sug-
gests that the endocrine signals responding to weight loss (such as lep-
tin) act as part of a proportional feedback control system as shown in
the curves depicted in Figure 2 illustrating that proportional feedback
control (as defined by Equation (4) with the parameter kP 5 95 kcal/
day per kg) mimics the observed body weight and energy intake pat-
terns in humans receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.
In contrast, despite the persistent increase in UGE, if the system reg-
ulating body weight included integral feedback control (Equation
(5)), body weight would ultimately have been restored to baseline
values even in the presence of sustained increases in UGE. This out-
come is a well-known result from control theory that integral feed-
back is a necessary and sufficient condition for a system to produce
zero steady-state error (i.e., return to baseline body weight) in
response to a sustained perturbation (i.e., persistently increased
UGE) and that a proportional feedback system will always have a
nonzero steady-state error (i.e., a sustained reduction in body
weight) in response to a sustained perturbation. In contrast, for any
value of kI > 0, a system including integral feedback in the regula-
tion of energy intake would have only transient weight loss during
sustained SGLT2 inhibitor treatment as shown for the integral feed-
back model in Figure 2.
By modeling the mean changes in energy intake obtained with
SGLT2 inhibitor treatment using the proportional feedback model,

 our results quantify the strength of energy intake feedback control in
humans. On average, energy intake increased by �100 kcal/day per
kilogram of weight lost—an effect substantially greater than the
�30 kcal/kg/day changes in energy expenditure observed with 10%
to 20% weight loss in subjects with obesity (1).
To illustrate the importance of our results for obesity treatment, con-
sider the body weight trajectory depicted in Figure 3A that resulted
from long-term participation in a structured commercial weight loss
program (19) and illustrates the ubiquitous body weight time course
characterized by initial weight loss, a plateau after 6 to 8 months,
followed by slow weight regain (20). The calculated energy intake
corresponding to this mean body weight trajectory is illustrated in
Figure 3B showing an initial reduction of �700 kcal/day from
baseline followed by an exponential relaxation towards baseline
intake over the ensuing months despite continued weight loss. The
estimated energy expenditure corresponding to this intervention is also
shown in Figure 3B and indicates relatively minor changes in
comparison to the changes in energy intake.
Note that at the point of maximum weight loss occurring at the �8-
month plateau, energy intake had already returned to within 100 kcal/
day of baseline. After 1 year, the average energy intake was practically
at baseline levels while body weight was still reduced by �5 kg. A
similar pattern of relapsing diet adherence has been observed using
objective biomarker methods during an intensive 2-year calorie
restriction study where calorie intake was much lower during the early
period of weight loss than after the body weight had plateaued (6,21).
The calculated energy intake time course during the lifestyle intervention
suggests that diet adherence lapsed very early with subjects returning to
their previous caloric intake and a corresponding weight plateau followed
by slow weight regain. While this might be interpreted as indicating that
the participants rapidly decreased their efforts to adhere to the interven-
tion, it is enlightening to consider their food intake behavior within the
context of the proportional feedback control system. The dashed curve in
Figure 3B illustrates the energy intake pattern corresponding to the
increased appetite in response to the feedback signals arising from the
body weight changes shown in Figure 3A. The difference between the
increased appetite and the actual energy intake is depicted in Figure 3C
and is a quantitative index of the ongoing effort to sustain the intervention
in the face of the continuing biological signals to overeat. In this context,
a substantial persistent effort is required to avoid overeating above base-
line to satisfy the increased appetite during the intervention despite the
average energy intake returning to near baseline levels.
Discussion
In the absence of ongoing efforts to restrain food intake following
weight loss, feedback control of energy intake will result in eating
above baseline levels with an accompanying acceleration of weight
regain. Such behavior has been previously observed in rodent mod-
els when a return to ad libitum feeding following diet restriction
resulted in hyperphagia until the lost weight was regained (22). This
phenomenon has been also observed in lean men following experi-
mental semistarvation (23) or short-term underfeeding (24-26).
Hyperphagia in these studies was believed to result from homeo-
static signals arising from loss of both body fat and lean tissues
(27,28), but a conscious desire to regain lost weight cannot be ruled
out and may have contributed to increased food intake.
Previous studies of energy intake regulation in humans have
employed short-term diet manipulations to measure compensatory
changes in energy intake (29-32). While such studies can provide
useful information about the influence of episodic appetite signals
on short-term modulation of energy intake, the results cannot be
readily extrapolated to the long time scales associated with regula-
tion of human energy balance and do not provide information about
how weight changes influence energy intake.
Figure 3 Energy balance dynamics during a lifestyle intervention for weight loss
(19). (A) Average body weight (�) typically decreases and reaches a plateau after 6
to 8 months of a lifestyle intervention followed by slow weight regain. (B) Energy
expenditure changes relatively little during the intervention (dotted curve) whereas
energy intake (solid curve) initially drops by a large amount followed by an expo-
nential return toward baseline (thin horizontal gray line). The proportional feedback
from the body weight loss induces a large increase in appetite (dashed curve) that
is resisted by the attempt to sustain the intervention. (C) The average effort during
the intervention was defined as the difference between the increased appetite and
the actual energy intake. A substantial effort persists during the intervention despite
a return to near baseline energy intake. Mean 6 95% CI.

 Long-term inhibition of SGLT2 provides a unique probe for assess-
ment of human energy homeostasis since the mechanism of action is
clear, its effect on energy output is consistent, and the intervention
is unlikely to directly affect central pathways involved in regulation
of food intake. In contrast, other interventions aimed at increasing
energy expenditure, such as exercise (7) or exogenous delivery of
thyroid hormone (33), have pleiotropic effects and their impact on
energy expenditure can be highly variable.
The suggestion that the signals controlling energy intake act as a
proportional feedback system without integral feedback is consistent
with the roughly proportional changes in appetite-regulating hor-
mones that occur rapidly in response to weight loss and do not fur-
ther increase as weight loss is sustained (as would occur with inte-
gral feedback) (34). We do not yet know whether the simple
proportional controller represented by Equation (4) is valid for a
range of weight losses. For example, it may be possible that small
weight changes are uncompensated by changes in energy intake
such that the control system engages only after sufficient weight
loss to cross some threshold (35). Furthermore, larger weight losses
may result in energy intake adaptations corresponding to a nonlinear
function of body weight change. Future research is required to
address these questions and more fully characterize the energy
intake feedback control system, characterize its variability between
individuals, and identify its physiological mediators in humans.
Proportional feedback control of energy intake may help explain
why the calculated exponential decay of diet adherence during
weight loss interventions markedly contrasts with self-reported
measurements that indicate persistence of diet adherence and no sig-
nificant differences in caloric consumption between the period of
early weight loss compared with the later time when weight has pla-
teaued (36). This has led to speculation that the 6- to 8-month
weight plateau may be entirely due to slowing of metabolic rate
rather than loss of diet adherence. Our results suggest otherwise and
further illustrate that self-reported energy intake measurements are
quantitatively unreliable (5). Nevertheless, the relative constancy
self-reported energy intake over the first 6 months corresponds well
with the calculated persistent effort to resist the increased appetite
and the drive to overeat at above baseline levels. Therefore, self-
reported measurements of energy intake may more accurately reflect
the perceived effort of the dieter to adhere to the intervention rather
than their actual energy intake.
An important limitation of our study is that we did not have direct
measurements of energy expenditure following SGLT2 inhibition.
Rather, we calculated the expected energy expenditure changes
using our mathematical model that was previously validated to accu-
rately simulate the response to weight changes resulting from con-
trolled changes in energy intake (12-14). Therefore, the calculated
energy intake changes assumed that SGLT2 inhibition did not
directly influence energy expenditure which is consistent with data
from a 4-week study in humans showing no significant changes in
pre- or postmeal energy expenditure after 4 weeks of treatment with
the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (10) and data showing no signifi-
cant changes in oxygen consumption in rodents treated with canagli-
flozin (11).
We restricted our analysis to the group mean rather than attempt to
characterize individual responses since UGE was not directly meas-
ured in each subject but was assumed to be �90 g/day based on
previous measurements in people with type 2 diabetes treated with
300 mg/day canagliflozin (9,37,38). A subset of subjects in the pres-
ent study underwent a meal tolerance test where UGE was meas-
ured; their mean increase in UGE over the 3 h meal test was 14.7 g
(39); this is similar to the value observed following meals in other
studies where mean 24 h UGE was measured to be �90 g/day and
suggests that the mean daily UGE is unlikely to be substantially dif-
ferent than what was assumed. Therefore, there is a correspondingly
small uncertainty in the mean calculated proportional control of
energy intake (�100 kcal/day per kg of body weight lost) at the
group level. Measuring daily UGE in individuals during long-term
studies with SGLT2 inhibitors would enable the individual subject
variability in the magnitude of the compensatory energy intake
responses to be characterized.
In summary, our results provide the first quantification of the energy
intake feedback control system in free-living humans. We found that
appetite increased by �100 kcal/day above baseline per kilogram of
lost weight—an effect several-fold larger than the corresponding
energy expenditure adaptations. The few individuals who success-
fully maintain weight loss over the long term do so by heroic and
vigilant efforts to maintain behavior changes in the face of increased
appetite along with persistent suppression of energy expenditure
(40) in an omnipresent obesogenic environment. Permanently sub-
verting or countering this feedback control system poses a major
challenge for the development of effective obesity therapies.O
