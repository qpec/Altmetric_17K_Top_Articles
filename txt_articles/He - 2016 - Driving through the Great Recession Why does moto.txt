Abstract
The relationship between short-term macroeconomic growth and temporary mortality increases 
remains strongest for motor vehicle (MV) crashes. In this paper, I investigate the mechanisms that 
explain falling MV fatality rates during the recent Great Recession. Using U.S. state-level panel 
data from 2003–2013, I first estimate the relationship between unemployment and MV fatality rate 
and then decompose it into risk and exposure factors for different types of MV crashes. Results 
reveal a significant 2.9 percent decrease in MV fatality rate for each percentage point increase in 
unemployment rate. This relationship is almost entirely explained by changes in the risk of driving 
rather than exposure to the amount of driving and is particularly robust for crashes involving large 
commercial trucks, multiple vehicles, and speeding cars. These findings provide evidence 
suggesting traffic patterns directly related to economic activity lead to higher risk of MV fatality 
rates when the economy improves.

Introduction
The relationship between short-term macroeconomic fluctuation and mortality is rather 
counterintuitive. During economic recessions, when economic activities experience 
significant declines, job losses are linked to worse individual health outcomes through 
pathways such as losing health insurance coverage and experiencing greater financial and 
material hardships (Burgard, Ailshire, & Kalousova, 2013). Instead, temporary economic 
downturns are often associated with lower than expected mortality at the population level. 
Previous literature suggests that these observed short-term benefits may occur because 
individuals on the aggregate have more time to engage in healthy behaviors and less money 
to spend on alcohol and cigarettes (Burgard, Ailshire, & Kalousova, 2013; Ruhm, 2000). 
Consistently, a strong relationship between macroeconomic fluctuation due to motor vehicle 
deaths has remained persistent through as least the past three decades (Ruhm, 2000,2015).

 Motor vehicle crashes represent a major public health hazard and are the leading cause of 
death for those aged 5 to 25 in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
2014). An average of 37,850 people have died from motor vehicle crash each year from 
2004 to 2012, amounting to one death almost every 14 minutes (author’s calculation based 
on FARS). Despite their significance, motor vehicle death rates in the United States actually 
fell every year since 2006 until its recent uptick in 2012 (NHTSA, 2013). Most dramatically, 
the number of motor vehicle deaths plummeted 18 percent in just two years from 41,259 
deaths in 2007 to 33,808 deaths in 2009 (NHTSA, 2009, 2010). These temporary declines in 
motor vehicle fatalities coincide with the Great Recession of 2007–2009, the longest 
economic recession since the Great Depression.
In this paper, I examine the relationship between macroeconomic fluctuations and motor 
vehicle fatality through exposure and risk factors. I augment previous literature by exploring 
fatal risk factors relating to large trucks, speeding, and other types of collisions. The findings 
uncover substantial mechanisms that have not been taken into account in previous studies. 
More broadly, this study provides more insight into the pro-cyclical relationship for motor 
vehicle deaths and carries important policy implications to combat rising traffic fatalities 
during economic expansions.
Background
In an influential paper using panel data models, Ruhm (2000) establishes that all-cause 
mortality varies pro-cyclically with state unemployment rate in the United States over a 20-
year period. To be precise, pro-cyclical mortality means that mortality moves in the same 
direction as macroeconomic conditions deviate above or below the long-term linear trend. 
This relationship suggests that mortality temporarily rises during economic expansions (i.e. 
when unemployment decreases) and falls during economic contractions (i.e. when 
unemployment increases). Thus, falling and rising mortality in this paper refers to temporary 
higher and lower than expected mortality given that the expectation is a linear trend. As 
unemployment climbs by one percentage point, Ruhm (2000) predicts a 0.5 percent decrease 
in total mortality rate. While the magnitude of the effect appears to be small, unemployment 
often rises by more than one percentage point annually during recessionary periods, thus 
leading to significant declines in mortality (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2015). Other papers 
using data from Germany (Neumayer, 2004), Japan (Tapia Granados, 2008), and OECD 
countries (Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006) also produce results that mirror Ruhm’s (2000) 
findings.
When researchers decompose this relationship by cause- specific deaths, they find that the 
pro-cyclicality is largely driven by acute causes of death especially those due to motor 
vehicle crashes, cardiovascular diseases, and pneumonia (Ruhm, 2000; Tapia Granados, 
2008; Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006). Mortality patterns for acute causes of death respond 
strongly to short-term macroeconomic change unlike those for causes of death with slower 
disease progression, such as cancer (Ruhm 2000, 2003). In particular, motor vehicle 
fatalities in the United States have consistently shown a strong, pro-cyclical relationship. 
Ruhm (2000) suggests that a one-percentage point increase in unemployment lowers the 
motor vehicle fatality rate by 3 percent, compared to a 0.5 percent reduction for all-cause

 mortality. In more recent estimates, Ruhm (2015) finds that the association of a one-
percentage point increase in unemployment rate for motor vehicle fatality rate has attenuated 
to 0.9 percent in 2010, but remains significant. Two recent studies that specifically examine 
the impact of macroeconomic indicators on motor vehicle fatality also arrive at similar 
conclusions. Cotti and Tefft (2011) use state-quarter-year panel data models and estimate 
that motor vehicle fatality rate decreases by 1.63 percent for each percentage point increase 
in state unemployment rate between 2003 and 2009. In a study of motorcycle fatalities, 
which account for 14 percent of all traffic deaths, French and Gumus (2014) also find the 
effect of unemployment rate to be 1.8 for motorcycle mortality over several decades in the 
United States.
Previous studies examine the association between macroeconomic indicators on motor 
vehicle fatality by evaluating various exposure and risk factors. Exposure relates to changes 
in the amount of driving at the population level. During economic downturns, overall traffic 
volume has been hypothesized to shrink because fewer individuals are commuting to work 
and less commercial activity is occurring on the road (Burgard, Ailshire, & Kalousova, 
2013; Ruhm, 2000). At the same time, individual consumption patterns might also change as 
people tend to make fewer leisure trips such as going to restaurants and shopping (Cotti and 
Tefft, 2011; Burgard, Ailshire, & Kalousova, 2013). Using vehicle miles travelled (VMT), a 
widely accepted measure of driving exposure, existing papers provide conflicting evidence 
on the importance of driving exposure in explaining pro-cyclical trends for motor vehicle 
deaths. In an earlier study, Wagenaar’s (1984) time series analysis did not find VMT to 
explain the link between macroeconomic fluctuations and motor vehicle mortality rates in 
Michigan. More recently, Cotti and Tefft (2011) find state personal income per capita, but 
not state unemployment rate, to be positively associated with VMT per capita between 2003 
and 2009 in the United States.
In this literature, studies also direct their attention to the risk of certain types of fatal crashes 
given a fixed exposure of driving. Most studies focus on drunk driving as a risky behavior 
that might explain increases in motor vehicle fatalities when the economy improves 
(Wagenaar and Streff, 1989; Ruhm, 1995, Cotti and Tefft, 2011). During economic 
downturns, individuals are hypothesized to have less disposable income to spend on 
detrimental normal goods such as alcohol and cigarettes (Ruhm, 2000). Although others 
contend that higher unemployment has no effect (Xu 2013) or might even increase alcohol 
consumption (Frijters, Johnston, Lordan, & Shields, 2013), Cotti and Tefft (2011) recently 
find unemployment rates to be negatively associated with drunk-driving fatalities at the state 
level. In the context of the Great Recession, they suggest that alcohol-related driving 
fatalities account for a significant amount of the decline in motor vehicle fatalities between 
2007 and 2009.
The existing literature does not adequately address the link between macroeconomic 
indicators and motor vehicle fatality. Most importantly, previous literature has insufficiently 
explored the scope of mechanisms that could help explain cyclical variations in fatal motor 
vehicle crashes. Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities should be examined in conjunction with 
other types of potentially risky driving behaviors or crash types. Several other plausible 
factors have been hypothesized to explain the pro-cyclical nature of motor vehicle fatality

 but have not yet been empirically tested. First, there may be changes in the composition of 
vehicles during economic downturns, namely in a decrease in the proportion of commercial 
trucks. French and Gumus (2014) suggest that fewer commercial vehicles during economic 
downturns can help improve overall road safety because commercial trucks may pose greater 
danger than passenger cars. Recent statistics show only four percent of all registered 
vehicles are large trucks (henceforth defined as having a gross weight over 10,000 lbs), but 
they are involved in crashes accounting for 12 percent of all fatalities each year (Lyman and 
Braver, 2003). In another study, Wagenaar (1984) only includes fatalities including 
passenger cars noting that the economy might have a direct effect on truck traffic. However, 
the ability to differentiate among these various crash types is essential for policy 
interventions when the economy improves. Because large trucks are generally tied to 
commercial and economic activity, they could play an important role in the relationship 
between macroeconomic fluctuations and motor vehicle fatality rate. Another important risk 
factor that is missing in this empirical literature is speeding, which is a factor in up to one-
third of all fatal motor vehicle crashes (Liu, Chen, Subramanian, & Utter, 2005). Cotti and 
Tefft (2011) suggest that the risk behavior of speeding might increase when the economy 
improves because of the rising opportunity cost of time. Further, speeding-related fatalities 
may be tied to drunk driving. A government report find speeding involved in over 40 percent 
of drunk driving crashes compared to just 14 percent of sober crashes (Liu, Chen, 
Subramanian, & Utter, 2005).
Additionally, no study has examined this specific relationship past the recent U.S. Great 
Recession, officially dated December 2007 to June 2009 (National Bureau of Economic 
Research). The large macroeconomic fluctuations over the Great Recession presents an ideal 
setting for understanding the relationship between macroeconomic change on motor vehicle 
fatality. Although Cotti and Tefft's (2011) study period stretches through the year 2009, 
which marks the end of the Recession, macroeconomic conditions had not yet subsided to 
pre- Recession levels. In fact, unemployment rate remained at 10 percent in late-2009, 
doubled what it was in late-2007 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015). By 2013, 
unemployment rate had already reached its peak and fallen for three consecutive years 
(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015).
Objective
Despite compelling evidence supporting the strong empirical relationship between motor 
vehicle fatality rates and macroeconomic conditions, few papers have attempted to 
understand the link between the two. Using panel data methods, I will analyze the rise and 
fall of motor vehicle fatality in the recent recessionary period in order to answer the 
following research questions: 1) Has the pro-cyclical relationship between motor vehicle 
fatality and unemployment persisted through the recent Great Recession? 2) How do 
exposure and risk factors explain the associations between unemployment and motor vehicle 
fatality rate?
This paper will first analyze new data after the Great Recession through 2013 to capture 
recent improvements in macroeconomic conditions. More importantly, I will expand the 
current understanding of pro-cyclical motor vehicle fatalities by providing a deeper analysis

 into the specific exposure and risk factors that drive pro-cyclical motor vehicle fatality rates. 
By disaggregating types of motor vehicle crashes, I provide alternative explanations to better 
understand the mechanisms linking macroeconomic conditions and motor vehicle fatality. 
My results will show that the story of pro-cyclical motor vehicle fatality aligns more with an 
explanation of direct changes in commercial activities on the road and cannot simply be 
explained by changes in drunk driving fatalities.
Methods
Data and Measures
Combining several government data sources, I produce a panel dataset in order to model the 
relationship between unemployment and motor vehicle fatality rate. Consistent with past 
research, the level of analysis in this paper is at the state-level. My sample includes 550 
(50×11) state-year observations with 50 U.S. states excluding the District of Columbia from 
2003 to 2013.
The main dependent variable is motor vehicle fatality rate per 100,000 people. Motor vehicle 
death counts come from the Fatal Analysis and Reporting System (FARS) database. Under 
the umbrella of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), FARS is a 
national census that details every motor vehicle crash which occurs on a public road and 
results in at least one death within 30 days. The NHTSA compiles state-level documents 
such as police reports, hospital reports, and registration records for the FARS database and 
coding of crash type. The American Community Survey and the Decennial Census from the 
U.S. Census Bureau provide mid-year population estimates used in the denominator to 
calculate fatality rates.
I also use FARS to identify five different types of motor vehicle crashes and calculate 
fatality rates for each type. Specifically, I examine crashes involving large trucks, crashes 
involving a speeding vehicle, crashes involving a drunk driver, crashes involving a single 
vehicle or multiple vehicles, and crashes in urban areas or rural areas. A few terms need 
additional clarification. As previously stated, large trucks are defined by the NHTSA as over 
10,000 lbs. Figure 1 shows examples of trucks that meet the specifications of that definition. 
Drunk driving is best determined through direct police reports of driver's blood alcohol 
content. Because a large percentage of driver's BAC is missing in FARS, NHTSA also 
releases a multiple imputation dataset for imputed BAC values based on other characteristics 
of the crash (Subramanian, 2002). Consistent with French and Gumus’ (2014) definition, I 
define crashes involving a drunk driver when a driver's blood alcohol content (BAC) is at or 
above 0.08 g/dL. This group is compared with crashes involving no drunk drivers. In 
supplementary analysis, I present results for noalcohol involved crashes where all drivers 
have a BAC of 0.
I further decompose the dependent variable, motor vehicle fatality rates, into the product of 
two terms: risk and exposure of motor vehicle crashes. Following Cotti and Tefft’s (2011) 
decomposition, risk is operationalized as motor vehicle deaths divided by million vehicle-
miles travelled (VMT) while exposure is defined as million VMT divided by the population. 
VMT estimates for each state are from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The

 motivation for the decomposition is to understand whether fluctuations in motor vehicle 
fatality rates are mainly due to changes in the amount of driving (i.e. exposure) or in the 
number of deaths given a fixed amount of driving (i.e. risk). An increase in the exposure 
term can occur if there are more drivers on the road or if the same number of drivers are 
travelling greater distances. On the other hand, an increase in the risk term suggests higher 
likelihood of experiencing motor vehicle fatalities given a fixed amount of VMT. These 
terms are also important for interventions that might target how much versus how 
dangerously people are driving.
Unemployment rate is the main explanatory variable and serves as a proxy for 
macroeconomic conditions in previous studies (Ruhm, 2000; French and Gumus, 2014; 
Cotti and Tefft, 2011). Data on unemployment rates are obtained from the United States 
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Moreover, I account for a host of state- and year-specific policy controls that have been 
shown to affect motor vehicle fatalities (Dee, Grabowski, & Morrisey, 2005; Ferdinand et 
al., 2015). In line with previous research, I include beer tax and gasoline prices in 2013 
dollars (Cotti and Tefft, 2011; French and Gumus, 2014; Grabowski and Morrisey, 2004; 
Morrisey and Grabowski, 2011). On the policy side, I include the following driving-related 
laws: bans on handheld devices, bans on texting and driving, primary enforcement of 
seatbelt laws, 0.08 legal BAC limit, and presence of graduated driver licensing (GDL) 
program for teenage drivers. The policy controls are coded as dummy variables for the years 
with the laws enacted. If a law becomes effective in the during the calendar year, I use a 
fractional value for the year as others have done in similar analysis. (Dee, Grabowski, & 
Morrisey, 2005). Table A1 summarizes the definitions and sources for each of the control 
variables.
Analytical Strategy
In the results, I will first show descriptive trends of the main independent and dependent 
variables. I will then illustrate detrended, bivariate relationships for unemployment and the 
five types of motor vehicle crashes.
Following the descriptive analysis, I will estimate regression models using Ruhm's (2000) 
baseline model in Equation 1:
(Eq.1)
The outcome, H, is the natural logged motor vehicle fatality rate for state j at year t. E is 
unemployment rate, the macroeconomic indicator. X is a set of tax and policy controls at the 
state-year level. The equation also includes national year effects with year dummy variables 
and state fixed effects. Time effects capture national level time trends, such as improvements 
in car safety, which might also influence the outcome variable (Muazzam and Nasrullah, 
2011). State fixed effects eliminate possible endogeneity from time invariant state 
characteristics. Finally, the equation includes an error term and robust standard errors.

 First, I run the regression with the outcome, H, as total motor vehicle fatality rate to 
determine the magnitude of the pro-cyclical relationship during the study period. I also test 
whether using age-standardized fatality rates as the outcome would change the magnitude of 
the relationship since motor vehicle fatality rates are not constant across ages and the 
population composition changes over time. After standardizing fatality rates to the 2010 
U.S. age distribution with five-year age groups, I find the coefficients to be almost identical. 
Thus, all analysis in the paper uses the crude fatality rates.
In the next set of regressions, I decompose total motor vehicle fatality rate into risk (i.e. 
fatalities per million VMT) and exposure (i.e. million VMT per 100,000 people). Equation 2 
shows that with the outcome logged, motor vehicle fatality rate can be decomposed into the 
sum of logged risk and logged exposure. As shown in Cotti and Tefft’s (2011), this 
decomposition allows me to conduct two separate regression analysis with each component 
set as the outcome. Again, the purpose of the decomposition is to assess the contribution of 
each component to the pro-cyclical relationship between unemployment and motor vehicle 
fatality rates.
(Eq. 2)
Finally, I run regression analysis with the outcome as motor vehicle fatality rate for each of 
the five types of crashes introduced earlier in the paper and their complements. By 
disaggregating motor vehicle fatality rates into types of crashes, I examine previously 
unexplored mechanisms that can provide insight into the pro-cyclicality patterns of motor 
vehicle deaths.
Results
Descriptive Trends
I first show descriptive trends of the independent and dependent variables during this study 
period. Figure 2a illustrates the large variation in average state unemployment rate between 
2003 and 2013. At the onset of the Great Recession in 2007, unemployment rate sits low at 
just under 4.5 percent on average across states but soon jumped to almost 9 percent at the 
end of the recession in 2010. In more recent years, unemployment rate on average has 
experienced a steady decline and is on pace to return to pre-recession levels.
Figure 2b shows the trend for total motor vehicle fatality rate during the 11-year study 
period. Average state motor vehicle fatality rate holds steady at above 16 per 100,000 from 
2003 to 2006. In 2007, the average fatality rate drops below 16 per 100,000 and continues to 
fall until it reaches just below 12 per 100,000 in 2011. After an increase in 2012, average 
motor vehicle fatality rate falls to the lowest level in 2013. The decline in average motor 
vehicle fatality rates is 8.4 percent annually during the years of the Great Recession in 2007–
2009, which is significantly larger than the declines from 2003–2006. Figure 2c and 2d 
compares the trend between the risk and exposure components of the decomposition in 
Equation 2. The trend in risk (2c) is represented by average state motor vehicle deaths per

 million VMT while exposure (2d) is the average state million VMT per 100,000 people. 
Whereas the risk term appears to mimic the fatality rate trend in Figure 2c, the exposure 
component remains relatively flat from 2003 to 2013.
Detrended Relationships
Figures 3a to 3f illustrate bivariate relationships between unemployment rate and different 
types of motor vehicle fatality rates from 2003 to 2013. All rates have been detrended and 
normalized in order to understand associations as rates rise above and below the linear trend 
measured in standard deviations from the mean rate. Figure 3a clearly shows the pro-
cyclicality of all motor vehicle fatality rates – as the economy improves in the first half of 
the study period (using the proxy of unemployment declining below the trend), motor 
vehicle fatality rates increase above the trend. I find the pro-cyclical pattern to persist into 
the second half of the study period.
The rest of the Figure 3 examines complementary pairs of motor vehicle fatality rates with 
unemployment rate. Moving from Figures 3b to 3f, I compare large truck and non-large 
truck fatality rates (3b), speeding and non-speeding fatality rates (3c), drunk and non-drunk 
fatality rates (3d), single and multiple vehicle fatality rates (3e), and rural and urban fatality 
rates (3f). While pro-cyclicality cannot be visually determined alone, several noticeable 
deviations around the timing of the Great Recession should be mentioned. The graph in 
Figure 3b shows that fatalities involving large trucks (triangle icon) decline to over two 
standard deviations below the mean in 2009 compared to less than one standard deviation 
below the mean for non-large truck fatality rates (square icon). Similarly, in Figure 3f, 
fatality rates in urban areas (triangle icon) drop to almost two standard deviations below the 
mean in 2009 compared to rural fatality rates (square icon) which deviate less than one 
standard deviation below the mean. The patterns for the other pairs, including drunk and 
non-drunk fatalities, are rather similar, and procyclicality for all the pairs cannot be 
discerned by the graphs alone. However, fatalities involving large trucks falls sharply toward 
the end of the Great Recession and could be a significant contributor to the pro-cyclical 
relationship between unemployment and motor vehicle fatalities.
Regression Analysis
Building on the descriptive graphs, I run multivariate regression analysis to assess the 
significance of the associations at the state-level. Table 1 displays the regression results for 
the association between state unemployment rate and total state motor vehicle fatality rate. 
The coefficient in the first model with just state fixed effects and national linear time trend is 
−0.0282 (p<0.05). For each percentage point increase in unemployment rate, motor vehicle 
fatality decreases by 2.82 percent. With the inclusion of tax and policy controls, the 
coefficient changes slightly to −0.0288 (p<0.05). Results from Table 1 suggests that the 
significant, pro-cyclicality of motor vehicle fatality has persisted in the recent decade and 
through the Great Recession.
In order to better understand what is driving the pro-cyclical nature of motor vehicle 
fatalities, I decompose total motor vehicle fatality rate into aforementioned risk and 
exposure components. As stipulated by Equation 2, the regression coefficient from the risk

Author Manuscript
 and exposure components would add up to the coefficient for total fatality rate (−0.0288). 
Table 2 presents this decomposition result with three different models that have the same 
independent variables but three different outcomes (i.e. total fatality rate, risk component, 
and exposure component). The interpretation for Table 2 is that for each percentage point 
increase in unemployment, the risk (i.e. fatalities per million VMT) decreases by 2.5 percent 
(p<0.05) compared to a 0.4 percent nonsignificant decrease in the exposure (i.e. a million 
VMT per 100,000 people). The decomposed coefficients also mean that the risk component 
accounts for 88 percent (0.0252/0.0288) of the motor vehicle pro-cyclical relationship. This 
finding is not surprising given the descriptive graph in Figure 2d depicts a flat line for the 
exposure component.
After establishing that the risk, and not exposure, accounts for almost all of the motor 
vehicle pro-cyclicality, I now examine the relationship between unemployment and various 
crash types in order to pinpoint specific types of crashes that elevate fatality risk. Table 3 
presents the regression coefficients for unemployment rate for the five types of crashes and 
their complements. I only show the main unemployment coefficients in Table 3 because only 
three coefficients for the control variables have significant associations with the outcome. 
Detailed results with all coefficients are presented in Table A2. Although adding tax and 
policy control variables do not change the unemployment coefficients significantly, I direct 
my attention to the results in the second and fourth column with the full control variables 
included.
The first row of Table 3 compares the cyclical relationship between motor vehicle fatalities 
involving large trucks and those not involving large trucks. The regression coefficients for 
large truck fatalities is significant at −0.0837 (p<0.001). Each percentage increase in 
unemployment rate equates to an 8.4 percent decrease in fatalities involving large trucks. In 
contrast, fatality rates for crashes that do not involve large trucks are not significant 
(coefficient = −0.0207, NS).
The second row examines fatality rates for crashes involving speeding and those not 
involving speeding. Results show speeding-related fatalities are significantly pro-cyclical 
(coefficient = −0.0503, p<0.05) while fatalities not involving speeding are not significantly 
procyclical (coefficient = −0.0201, NS). Each percentage increase in unemployment rate is 
met with a 5.3 percent decrease in speeding-related motor vehicle fatalities.
Moving onto the next row in Table 3, I find that both drunk driving and non-drunk driving 
fatalities are significantly pro-cyclical. When unemployment increases by one percentage 
point, drunk driving fatality rates are expected to fall 3.6 percent (p<0.05) compared to 2.5 
percent for non-drunk driving fatality rates (p<0.05).
The fourth row compares single-vehicle fatalities and multi-vehicle fatalities. I find multi-
vehicle fatality rates to be pro-cyclical whereas single-vehicle fatality rates are a-cyclical. 
Multi-vehicle fatality rates are expected to decline 4.1 percent (p<0.05) as unemployment 
rate climbs by one percentage point compared to only a 2 percent (NS) decrease for single-
vehicle fatality rates.

 Finally, the last row in Table 3 shows regression coefficients for rural and urban motor 
vehicle fatality rates. Fatality rates in urban areas respond more strongly to changes in 
unemployment. For each percentage point increase in unemployment rate is expected to 
lower urban fatality rates by 4.6 percent (p<0.05) and rural fatality rates by 1.7 percent (NS).
Collectively, the results in Table 3 reveal significant pro-cyclical motor vehicle fatality for 
crashes involving large trucks, crashes involving speeding, multi-vehicle crashes, crashes in 
urban areas, and both drunk and non-drunk driving crashes. Although past research 
singularly focuses on drunk driving crashes as an explanation for motor vehicle fluctuations, 
these results illuminate other types of crashes that sync with the macroeconomic cycle.
Additional Analysis
To rule out the alternative hypothesis that alcohol-related driving is the underlying cause of 
these other types of fatal crashes, I conduct the same regression analysis with only fatalities 
involving no alcohol (BAC = 0) to see if the results remain robust. If these other types of 
crashes are indeed related to drunk driving, then the significant results in Table 3 would not 
hold in the no-alcohol involved sample. Table 4 shows the results of this additional analysis 
for the four types of crashes – those involving large trucks, speeding vehicles, multiple 
vehicles, and in urban areas. All the regression coefficients remained robust in Table 4 
except for urban crashes which are no longer significant due to larger standard errors 
(coefficient = −0.0408, NS). For speeding crashes and multi-vehicle crashes, each 
percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with a 5.4 and 3.9 percent decrease 
(both p<0.05) in fatality rates, respectively. The same increase in unemployment is expected 
to decrease no-alcohol related large truck fatality rates by over 10 percent (p<0.001).
Discussion and Conclusion
Following up on the objectives of the paper, my results confirm that total motor vehicle 
fatality has remained strongly pro-cyclical in the recent decade including the years through 
the Great Recession. For all fatal motor vehicle crashes, each percentage point increase in 
unemployment rate predicts a significant 2.9 percent decrease in fatality rate. Both the 
magnitude and the direction of this association is consistent with or even larger than those in 
past findings (Cotti and Tefft, 2011; French and Gumus, 2014; Ruhm, 2015). I also show 
that the risk of fatalities per million VMT contributes 88 percent to the magnitude of the pro-
cyclical relationship. The significance of the risk component also aligns with previous 
findings (Cotti and Tefft, 2011). This result suggests that reductions in motor vehicle 
fatalities during economic downturns cannot be explained by fewer miles driven on average 
but by reduction in the risk of death per miles driven.
More importantly, the results offer new explanations for why motor vehicle fatality rates 
fluctuate with changes in unemployment. Previous studies have almost solely focused on 
drunk driving as the explanation for pro-cyclical motor vehicle fatality (Wagenaar and Streff, 
1989; Ruhm, 1995, Cotti and Tefft, 2011). Contradicting Cotti and Tefft’s (2011) previous 
assertion that only drunk driving fatalities are pro-cyclical, I find both drunk-driving and 
non-drunk driving related crashes to exhibit pro-cyclical patterns. Combined with the

 significant findings by crash type, I dismantle the existing explanation that changes in drunk 
driving alone are sufficient to explain the pro-cyclicality of motor vehicle fatalities.
The most compelling finding is that fatalities involving large truck are predicted to drop over 
8 percent for each percentage point increase in unemployment rate. Among crashes without 
alcohol, large truck fatalities are expected to decrease by an astonishing 10 percent for each 
percentage point rise in unemployment rate. These numbers stand in stark contrast to only a 
nonsignificant 2 percent decrease in fatalities not involving large trucks given the same 
change in unemployment rate. Large trucks over 10,000 lbs, as defined in this paper, are 
most likely tied to commercial uses. French and Gumus (2014) previously raise the 
(untested) hypothesis that motor vehicle fatalities increase during economic booms because 
of the changing composition of vehicles on the road. Specifically, more trucks on the road 
could lead to more dangerous driving conditions and more severe crashes for smaller 
passenger cars and motorcycles. Figure 4 shows the trend for proportion of truck 
registrations as a proxy for truck composition. Indeed, while proportion of truck registration 
climbs steadily in the beginning of the study period, it stalled during the Great Recession 
from 2007 to 2009 before rising again. This trend supports the hypothesis that fatalities 
involving large trucks increase when the economy improves because of changes in vehicle 
mix.
The results also reveal significant pro-cyclical relationships between unemployment and 
crashes involving multiple-vehicles and those in urban areas. A temporary increase in these 
types of crashes, along with commercial trucks, when the economy improves suggests 
mechanisms related to congested urban traffic. While the decomposition analysis does not 
find number of miles travelled to vary with the economic cycle, it is possible that the 
distance travelled remain relatively stable but are distributed differently across economic 
cycles. For instance, cars might be more likely to be travelling at the same time along the 
same flow of traffic, syncing with a typical commuting schedule. In that case, driving during 
economic booms can increase drivers’ exposure to other cars on the road by driving at the 
same time, thus elevating their risk of colliding in a multi-vehicle crash. While multi-vehicle 
crashes remain robust to the analysis of only no-alcohol involved crashes, results for urban 
crashes are no longer tenable in the same analysis, suggesting that urban fatalities are more 
likely related to drunk driving. These new findings on the significant pro-cyclicality of 
multi-vehicle crashes and, to a lesser extent, urban crashes expand our current understanding 
of mechanisms beyond the drunk driving paradigm.
I also test the hypothesis that speeding-related fatalities increase during temporary economic 
improvements. Proposed by Cotti and Tefft (2011), the theory is that people are more likely 
to drive in a hurry when the opportunity cost of time is high. Speeding-related fatalities are 
indeed significantly pro-cyclical even when I exclude alcohol-related crashes, suggesting 
that speeding is not only a by product of drunk driving behaviors (Liu, Chen, Subramanian, 
& Utter, 2005). Instead, the risk of speeding fatalities is a function of opportunity costs.
This study is not without limitations. First, FARS data is based on aggregated reports, 
including original police reports at the scene of the crash. The reliability of these reports 
may come into question with less concrete variables, such as speeding, which are based on 
He

 eyewitness reports. However, even without witnesses, excessive speeding may be inferred 
from the severity of the crash. A second limitation lies in operationalizing exposure to motor 
vehicle crash. Vehicle miles travelled (VMT) only measures exposure by distance and does 
not capture total time spent driving or exposure to numbers of cars on the road. Another 
potential problem with VMT is that the average number of passengers in vehicles can vary 
across time due to changes in carpooling, for example, and thus lead to variations in 
exposure not captured by VMT. However, data from the U.S. Census Bureau suggests that 
carpooling rates for commuting purposes have experienced a small and steady decline with 
no observable differences during the recent recession (McKenzie and Rapino, 2011; 
McKenzie, 2015). Nevertheless, I include VMT because it is a reliable, nationally reported 
measure that has been consistently used in previous studies. Future research can explore 
different exposure factors by taking advantage of transportation time-use data such as those 
from the National Household Travel Survey. Finally, there is an issue with endogeneity and 
causality. To alleviate concerns of endogenous variables, I include state fixed effects and 
national time trends in the regression. Even with fixed effects and a host of state-level 
controls, I am not able to account for other unobserved, time-varying variables that might 
correlate with the independent and dependent variables. Moreover, the regression results can 
only suggest strong associations between macroeconomic change and fatality rates rather 
than causal relationships. While I cannot rule out reverse causation, it is certainly more 
plausible for state-level unemployment to cause changes in state-level motor vehicle fatality 
rates than the reverse direction.
The findings carry important implications for informing policy and future research on 
reducing motor vehicle fatalities. Implementing policies targeting fatalities involving 
commercial trucks would be valuable toward the goal of reducing total motor vehicle deaths. 
Future research should examine whether the fault lies with truck drivers or the other drivers. 
If drivers of commercial trucks are inadequately trained or overworked, then the point of 
intervention should start in the trucking industry. On the other hand, perhaps passenger car 
drivers do not know how to navigate around large trucks. In that case, urban planner and 
road safety organizations should determine how to improve driving conditions when large 
and small vehicles share the road. Another direction for future research is to understand how 
time and space constraints can explain the pro-cyclical patterns of these crashes. 
Commercial activity on the road may be occurring at the same time each day, creating 
congested roads that make navigating traffic difficult and unsafe. If these types of fatal 
crashes take place at certain times, such as during rush hour, policy implications might be to 
incentivize workers to take public transportation, implement telework programs, or create 
different routes for commuters and commercial traffic.
The subject of how population-level mortality fluctuates with the economic cycle is of 
interest to many social scientists. Research on previous recessionary periods suggests that 
economic downturns may lead to temporary improvements in population health and 
mortality. But Ruhm’s (2015) recent paper asserts that pro-cyclicality of total mortality have 
waned in the recent cycle because some causes of death, such as cancer and poisoning, have 
emerged as counter-cyclical. Despite weakening relationships for the overall trend, motor 
vehicle crash is one of the few causes of death that remains pro-cyclical through recent years 
(Ruhm 2015). The findings in this paper bolster evidence on the persistent strength of motor

 vehicle fluctuations across the economic cycle. My findings reveal the important role large 
truck, multi-vehicle, and speeding crashes play in influencing the pro-cyclical relationship. 
Collectively, these are risk factors that broadly suggests motor vehicle fatality rates rise 
during economic booms because of a direct increase in commercial activity and brings to 
light the potential traffic hazards of work itself. The policy implications should help 
practitioners and policymakers alike pinpoint specific areas where they could intervene to 
reduce preventable motor vehicle fatalities in the future.
