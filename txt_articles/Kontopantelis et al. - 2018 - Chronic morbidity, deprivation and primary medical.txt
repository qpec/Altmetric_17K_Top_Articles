Abstract
Background: Primary care provides the foundation for most modern health-care systems, and in the interests of equity,
it should be resourced according to local need. We aimed to describe spatially the burden of chronic conditions and
primary medical care funding in England at a low geographical level, and to measure how much variation in funding is
explained by chronic condition prevalence and other patient and regional factors.
Methods: We used multiple administrative data sets including chronic condition prevalence and management
data (2014/15), funding for primary-care practices (2015-16), and geographical and area deprivation data (2015). Data
were assigned to a low geographical level (average 1500 residents). We investigated the overall morbidity burden
across 19 chronic conditions and its regional variation, spatial clustering and association with funding and
area deprivation. A linear regression model was used to explain local variation in spending using patient
demographics, morbidity, deprivation and regional characteristics.
Results: Levels of morbidity varied within and between regions, with several clusters of very high morbidity
identified. At the regional level, morbidity was modestly associated with practice funding, with the North
East and North West appearing underfunded. The regression model explained 39% of the variability in practice funding,
but even after adjusting for covariates, a large amount of variability in funding existed across regions. High morbidity and,
especially, rural location were very strongly associated with higher practice funding, while associations were more modest
for high deprivation and older age.
Conclusions: Primary care funding in England does not adequately reflect the contemporary morbidity burden. More
equitable resource allocation could be achieved by making better use of routinely available information and big data
resources. Similar methods could be deployed in other countries where comparable data are collected, to identify
morbidity clusters and to target funding to areas of greater need.

 Background
Primary care plays a vital role in coordinating care and
managing demand in the community, and provides the
cornerstone of many modern health-care systems [1]. Sys-
tems with a strong primary- care focus are associated with
lower care costs, higher patient satisfaction levels, better
overall health, lower medication use and a decrease in
hospitalisation and emergency department visits [2, 3].
Primary-care-focused health care can also reduce the im-
pact of socioeconomic factors on health [3], leading to im-
provements in overall health and reductions in health
inequalities across population subgroups [4].
One of the ongoing challenges for primary care is to
tackle variability in outcomes, and to contribute towards
breaking the link between wealth and health [5]. Whilst
coordinated primary-care initiatives can help to reduce
health inequalities, they can also unintentionally increase
them: universal interventions that are effective in im-
proving population health, such as smoking cessation
programmes [6], often increase inequities because they
are more effective in affluent areas [7]. Efforts to im-
prove equity are also undermined if resources are not al-
located according to need. The UK’s National Health
Service (NHS) is built on a strong primary-care base
and provides universal comprehensive care free at the
point of delivery, but striking inequities in health out-
comes remain [8].
In an attempt to address this, in the early 2000s the
UK
government
pursued
a
range
of
interventions
intended to improve equity and reformed the method of
funding primary-care practices. A new national General
Medical Services contract for general practitioners was
introduced in 2004, with two main funding components.
Core funding for essential and key additional services
was calculated using the Carr–Hill global sum formula
[9, 10], based on the number of registered patients,
adjusted for patient factors (including age, sex, turnover,
morbidity and mortality) and the local context (staff mar-
ket forces and rurality). This core funding was supple-
mented by a new pay-for-performance programme – the
Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) – introduced
with the aim of increasing overall funding for primary care
and reducing variation in quality between providers [11].
QOF payments were dependent on practice performance
against over 100 quality targets relating to practice organ-
isation, patient experience and clinical management of
chronic conditions. Payments for clinical targets were ad-
justed according to the relative prevalence of the relevant
condition in the practice population. Further investment
in primary care was targeted at deprived areas in 2007 and
2008 [12], with the aim of supporting local efforts to
tackle chronic disease and increasing physician numbers
in areas where physician recruitment and health-care
delivery can be challenging [13].
For several reasons, these initiatives did not fully ad-
dress the inequitable distribution of resources and its
contribution towards the perpetuation of health inequal-
ities [14]. First, funding under the QOF programme ini-
tially favoured larger practices in more affluent areas,
which tended to perform better against the quality tar-
gets [15, 16]. Gaps in performance rapidly narrowed [15,
17], although there was no clear evidence for improve-
ment in patient outcomes [18], or impact on mortality
over the longer term [5, 19]. Second, payment adjust-
ments intended to protect practice incomes had unin-
tended consequences. For the clinical QOF targets,
relative prevalence was calculated based on the square
root of disease prevalence rather than prevalence itself,
and practices with low disease prevalence – below the
5th percentile – were treated as if prevalence were equal
to the 5th percentile. These adjustments were intended
to retain parity between practices with respect to quality
payments, but had the effect of uncoupling the relation-
ship between workload and remuneration, disadvanta-
ging practices with high disease prevalence, which were
more likely to be in deprived areas. For this reason, from
2009 onwards the prevalence adjustment was calculated
based on actual prevalence. Third, the global sum for-
mula for core funding does not directly adjust for patient
deprivation and uses a measure of morbidity based on
Standardised Limited Long-Standing Illness data derived
from the 1998–2000 Health Survey for England [9].
There are long-standing concerns that this formula does
not fully reflect the pressures and costs that deprivation
imposes on practices [20]. In response to these concerns,
under the 2004 contract, practices received a Minimum
Practice Income Guarantee (MPIG), a correction pay-
ment to prevent their core funding, based on the new
global sum formula, falling below historical levels. MPIG
began to be phased out in 2014 with aim of equalising
weighted funding per patient across all practices by 2021
[20, 21]. This has left many practices in deprived areas
facing financial hardship and urgently calling for a fairer
system of resource allocation [21]. NHS England, NHS
Employers and the British Medical Association are com-
mitted to revising the Carr–Hill formula to reflect
deprivation better [10, 22], but agreement on a new sys-
tem of allocation has yet to be reached.
Since the introduction of the QOF in 2004, annually
updated prevalence data have been available for numer-
ous chronic conditions at the practice level, and these
could provide more precise, timely and comprehensive
information for determining health-care need. In this
study, we aimed to describe the overall chronic condi-
tion burden, as measured by prevalence data derived
from the 2014/15 QOF, and to evaluate its association
with primary medical care funding in England for 2015-
16. More specifically, we aimed to (a) spatially describe
Kontopantelis et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:19 
Page 2 of 13
 the overall chronic condition burden and payments to
primary-care practices at a low geographical level; (b)
quantify and describe the variability and spatial cluster-
ing in these two measures, across ten English regions
and (c) measure how much of the variation in spending
is explained by the overall chronic condition burden and
how much by other relevant population factors measur-
able at a low geographical level, in particular area
deprivation.
Methods
Our primary unit of analysis was the Lower Layer Super
Output Area (LSOA) in England: 32,844 geographical
administrative units with an average population of 1500.
Deprivation was measured though the 2015 Index of
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) [23]. To measure the mor-
bidity burden we created a chronic morbidity index
(CMI), calculated as the sum of 19 chronic condition
registers in the 2014/15 QOF, divided by the total prac-
tice population. Unfortunately, the measure cannot cap-
ture comorbidity since that information is not recorded
within the QOF. Someone with two conditions would be
entered independently in the two respective registers.
NHS payments to general practices for 2015-16 were re-
ported by NHS Digital, covering all centrally managed
payment schemes (global sum, MPIG, balance of PMS
(Personal Medical Services) expenditure, QOF and en-
hanced services)
and also
the decentralised
Local
Enhanced Services scheme. Although other local pay-
ments were not captured (for example, Local Author-
ity public health funding) the reported payments were
in effect the bulk of the income for general practices
[24]. Both funding and the CMI were assigned to
LSOAs using methodology previously described [12].
Further details of the data and the methods used to
attribute them to the LSOA level are provided in
Additional file 1: Appendix 1.
Analyses
The outcome of interest was average primary medical
funding per patient in 2015-16. The key covariates were
the IMD 2015 and the CMI of the 2014/15 QOF mea-
sured at the LSOA level. Correlations between the IMD
and the CMI were calculated using Pearson’s rho for the
whole of England and each of the ten regions (at the
LSOA level, weighted for 2014 population estimates).
Funding and the CMI were visualised using spatial maps
for all of England and each region. After aggregating at
the regional level (weighting for 2014 LSOA popula-
tions), scatter plots were used to describe the relation-
ship between the outcome and each of the two key
covariates. Box plots were plotted to describe the distri-
bution of funding and CMI within each region.
Spatial
autocorrelation
for
funding
per
person,
deprivation and morbidity (correlation in a signal among
nearby locations in space) was assessed and quantified
using Moran’s I. This measure accounts for the multi-
dimensional and multi-directional nature of spatial auto-
correlation, and can identify the presence of clusters. A
higher value than the one expected under a random
spatial pattern would indicate that, using morbidity as
an example, areas with high levels of morbidity are clus-
tered together and, hence, a high morbidity LSOA is
more likely to be bordered by (or have as close neigh-
bours) LSOAs with similarly high morbidity levels. We
calculated Moran’s I for each region and the whole of
England, to allow for within-England comparisons.
A linear regression model, weighted for 2015 LSOA size,
was used to quantify the strength of association between
average primary medical care funding per person and re-
gion, demographic characteristics (age, sex and ethnicity),
urbanity, the CMI and the IMD. A second model with
interaction
terms
is
discussed
in
Additional
file 1:
Appendix 1. Our choice between unadjusted (denomin-
ator = attribution population) and adjusted (denominator
= LSOA population) per patient cost was informed by the
predictive power of the regression models, with the
former metric leading to better models. Hence, all ana-
lyses and graphs we present use unadjusted funding.
Analyses were executed with Stata v14.1 and R v3.3.1.
Most comparisons are statistically significant due to the
size of the data set and thus, we focus on effects sizes
where possible. All variables we used were complete.
Results
A total of 56,924,424 patients were registered with a
general practice in January 2015. Total funding for prac-
tices in 2015-16 was £7.61 billion. Based on the number
of registered patients, the median annual primary med-
ical care funding per patient, minus prescription and dis-
pensing
costs,
was
£133.7
at
the
LSOA
level
[interquartile range (IQR), £123.5 to £148.0] (Table 1
and Fig. 1). Total median regional spending per person
varied from £125.4 in South Central to £145.7 in York-
shire and the Humber. Based on population estimates
rather than registers, funding per person was higher, at
£140.4 (IQR, £128.4 to £156.9). The median CMI for
England was 0.51 conditions at the LSOA level (IQR,
0.45 to 0.57), with the highest levels observed in the
North East (median, 0.59; IQR, 0.54 to 0.62) and the
lowest in London (median, 0.38; IQR, 0.34; 75th centile,
0.42). Correlations between the IMD and the CMI,
weighted for LSOA population sizes in 2014 (rather than
2015, since the CMI is based on 2014/15 QOF data),
were very weak for each region and close to zero for
England. The largest (absolute) rho was observed for the

The spatial variability of the CMI and average funding

(regional spatial maps are also provided in Additional

morbidity were concentrated in large areas in the North
East, the East Midlands and the East of England. London
and parts of its neighbouring regions (South Central,
South East and East of England) that are close to the
capital consistently had the lowest CMI levels. For
average funding per person, we also observed great
regional variability, which did not necessarily match
the CMI patterns. For example, there were very low
levels of funding for many parts of the North West –
and funding for the region as a whole was relatively
low compared to other regions – whereas the overall

 CMI level in the region was the second highest na-
tionally. We also calculated the ratio of CMI over
average funding per person (×1000), which is plotted
in Fig. 4 and highlights clusters of variability in every
region and a pattern of higher ratios in the North
West and the North East.
The associations between funding per person and
CMI, and between funding per person and IMD, are
illustrated at the regional level in Fig. 5 (plots at dif-
ferent geographic levels are provided in Additional
file 3: Appendix 3). Increasing funding per person is
associated with increasing levels of the CMI, with
outliers at high and low levels of CMI (London, with
the lowest level of CMI, has relatively high funding
per person, and the North East and the North West
regions, with the highest CMI levels, have relatively
low funding). The association between funding per
person and IMD is unclear, and IMD levels do not
appear to be related to primary medical care funding
at the regional level.

the CMI, the IMD and funding is presented in Fig. 6.
For the CMI, we observed high regional variability in
spatial
autocorrelation,
ranging
between
0.147
for
London and 0.471 for the South West. This indicates
that London has the least clustering of areas with similar
levels of CMI, and the South West has the greatest clus-
tering. For the IMD, spatial autocorrelation levels were
lower and had less variation, ranging from 0.109 in
London to 0.194 in the South East. Levels of spatial
autocorrelation were also modest for funding, but
there was greater variability between regions, ranging
from 0.074 in the West Midlands to 0.242 in the East
of England.

 After adjusting for demographics, urbanity, the CMI
and the IMD, there was large variability in funding be-
tween regions (Table 2). Compared to Yorkshire and the
Humber, the region with the highest average funding per
person, adjusted funding in the South East was £14.50
[95% confidence interval (CI), 13.38 to 15.62] lower per
person. The CMI was a strong predictor of funding, with
a 0.1-unit increase, i.e. from 0.513 (50th centile) to 0.613
(89th centile), associated with a £8.12 (95% CI, 7.71 to
8.54) increase in funding per person. The IMD was also
a strong predictor with a 10-unit increase in IMD, i.e.
from 17.4 (50th centile) to 27.4 (71st centile), associated
with a £2.26 (95% CI, 2.06 to 2.45) increase in funding
per person. The strongest independent predictor was ur-
banity, with rural areas associated with £35.71 (95% CI,
35.02 to 36.41) higher funding per person. Other large
associations were observed for LSOAs with a large
population over 60 and more females. An increase of
10% in patients over 60 within an LSOA (i.e. from 23.1%
or the 50th centile to 33.1% or the 84th centile) was as-
sociated with a £2.54 (95% CI, 2.12 to 2.95) increase per
person. The association for females is weaker than it ap-
pears because sex distribution is generally well balanced.
An increase of 1% in females, i.e. an increase from 51%
(50th centile) to 52% (73rd centile), was associated with
a £0.49 (95% CI, 0.39, 0.59) decrease per person.
Discussion
Primary-care funding in England is only modestly as-
sociated with morbidity burden, as measured by the
CMI at the regional level, with the North East and
North West having the highest levels of morbidity
but only average levels of funding. We observed great
variability in the CMI both within and between re-
gions, with clusters of very high morbidity burden in
the North East, East Midlands and East England.

 Spatial clustering of the CMI was high, especially for
the South West, and was not associated with area
deprivation in the patient locality, while funding was
more uniformly distributed across space. Although
morbidity, deprivation and age were strong predictors
of funding, the strongest predictor was rurality, with
less funding per person in urban centres. The model
explained a reasonable level of variability in funding
(39%), but even after adjusting for covariates, there
was large variability between regions, which was also
observed in relation to the strength of the associa-
tions between morbidity and funding, and between
deprivation and funding.
Strengths and limitations of the study
The strength of the study lies in the quality of the
databases and their sizes. We investigated the whole of
England and over 55 million people being served by a
universal health system. Through their electronic health
records, we calculated a measure of morbidity, the CMI,
and linked it to funding per person. The CMI is de-
signed to capture overall health needs for 19 common
chronic conditions rather than multi-morbidity, but we
would expect it to be a strong proxy for multi-morbidity.
The study has the potential for ecological fallacy, with
practice-level information assigned to geographies. Al-
though, we have assessed that risk and found it to be low
in terms of deprivation (see Additional file 1: Appendix 1),
the assignment could be improved by using age–sex
stratification weights at the LSOA level. A second limita-
tion is that ethnicity and urbanity information was avail-
able for 2011 and we necessarily assumed there has been
little change over time. Although this will not be the case
for all regions and LSOAs, the 2001 and 2011 versions of
these variables were very strongly correlated, indicat-
ing little change over time. A third limitation is that

Kontopantelis et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:19

 we could not directly assess multi-morbidity in any
form, due to the way the data are collected in
England. It has been shown in Scotland that multi-
morbidity is higher in deprived areas and is associ-
ated with higher demand but not additional funding
[25]. Fourth, our analysis is dependent on accurate
diagnosis and recording of conditions within primary
care. There is a danger that any future system of
resource allocation based on practice registers would
incentivise practices to inflate these registers. Finally, to
weight the regression models for LSOA sizes, we necessar-
ily used standard regression models rather than spatial-
autoregressive models, which may have affected our
estimates. However, the estimated spatial autocorrelation
for the whole of England is low and should not affect the
precision of our model estimates.

 The
low-level
geographical
approach
includes
advantages as well as risks. It allows us to control
analyses for population characteristics that are linked to
the small area geography, especially area deprivation. It
also enables us to plot detailed spatial maps to visualise
the parameters of interest and to identify geographical
clusters of high and low need. These analyses can inform
future service reorganisations and, by identifying areas
where the observed morbidity load is lower than expected,
uncover possible under-diagnosis and unmet need [26].
Findings
We failed to identify a strong association between the
overall morbidity burden, as measured by the recorded
prevalence of QOF conditions, and area deprivation. Al-
though multi-morbidity levels are positively associated
with deprivation [27], and the onset of multi-morbidity
occurs much earlier in people living in the most de-
prived areas [28], our findings are not contradictory.
First, mean age is lower in deprived inner-city areas,
which
offsets
the
unadjusted
association
between
deprivation and morbidity. Second, although associa-
tions between deprivation and prevalence rates have
been observed for conditions such as diabetes even
when not adjusted for age [29], these balance out across
the whole spectrum of conditions (at the practice level,
Pearson’s rho = 0.05). However, this may also be an indi-
cation of under-diagnosis in more deprived areas and
better case finding and recording in more affluent areas.
Regional variability in the CMI highlights the varying
levels of prevalence for QOF conditions across England.
The highest CMI levels were observed in the North East
(median 0.59 conditions per person) and the lowest in
London (median 0.38 conditions, reflecting its younger
population). Our findings are broadly in agreement with
previous reports for individual conditions at a higher
geography [30], considering we report an aggregate
measure. However, our low-geography mapping ap-
proach facilitates within-region investigations and the
identification of geographical clusters of high disease
prevalence. Large clusters of very high prevalence were
observed for the North East, East Midlands and East
England, and additional resources or reorganisation of
services may be needed to serve these populations better
[for example, extended opening hours or redistribution
of general practitioners (GPs)]. Levels of spatial cluster-
ing were particularly high for the South West (there
were no large high-prevalence clusters but there was a
high level of spatial variation across the whole region),
which could also inform the organisation of care. Im-
portantly, although regional CMI levels were broadly as-
sociated with average primary medical care funding per
person, the North East, North West and London appear
to be outliers, with fewer than expected resources
allocated to the North East and the North West, and
more to London. In particular for Greater Manchester,
and its very recently devolved health and social care
spending, a £2bn a year funding gap is expected by 2020
if demand trends are not curbed and existing barriers to
efficiency
and effectiveness are not removed http://
www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i1495.long.
This
imbal-
ance between health need and resource allocation may be
a contributing factor to the North–South divide in young
adult mortality rates [31].
At the low-geography level, patient age, sex, ethnicity,
morbidity (CMI), deprivation (IMD) and rurality ex-
plained a higher level of variation in funding than a pre-
vious model at the practice level for England [32]. More
importantly, unlike in previous work at the practice
level, we found the expected positive associations be-
tween funding and patient morbidity, deprivation and
age. This may be an indication of the strength of our ap-
proach
at
the
low
geographical
level,
where
area
deprivation can be modelled in greater detail. However,
regional variations in funding existed even after adjust-
ing for all these parameters, with the South East, North
East, North West and South Central having the lowest
levels of adjusted funding. As expected, morbidity,
deprivation and age were strong predictors of funding.
Rurality was also a very strong independent predictor,
with rural areas receiving an adjusted average of £35.70
more per patient. Prescribing and dispensing costs have
been suggested as explaining this disparity, but these
costs were excluded from our analyses. The higher cost
seems to be at least partially driven by the smaller list
sizes in practices located in rural areas (on average 831
fewer patients), while staffing levels are similar in both
rural (average full-time equivalent of 4.2 GPs and 2.3
nurses) and urban settings (average full-time equivalent
of 4.1 GPs and 2.1 nurses).
Conclusions
To meet societal goals of providing equitable health care,
funding for primary-care systems must be distributed ac-
cording to need, fully accounting for the impact of
deprivation. We have described the morbidity burden in
England at a low geographical level using routinely col-
lected administrative data. Not only have we identified un-
explained regional variation in common morbidities, we
have also found evidence that the current allocation of re-
sources to primary care does not account for all important
health needs. More optimal resource utilisation in primary
care in the UK is required [25], and better use of the
wealth of information resources already available could
help to achieve this aim through the design of fairer re-
source allocation formulae. It is, therefore, vital that the
disease registers introduced as part of the QOF are
retained and updated when the scheme is phased out.

Page 11 of 13
 Similar information is also routinely collected in other de-
veloped countries, and the methods we have described
can be highly relevant, both in identifying disease clusters
or under-diagnosis, and in matching resources to need.
Findings from such analyses are used in countries that use
public-sector allocation mechanisms, whether central (e.g.
Ireland and France) or devolved (e.g. Denmark, Sweden
and Spain), to directly inform resource allocation. In
countries
with
insurance-based
mechanisms
(e.g.
France, Germany and the Netherlands), analyses can be
used to identify mismatches between allocation and
need,
which
may
require
government
intervention
through risk equalisation schemes [33] or alternative
mechanisms. This will require difficult decisions about
the fundamental aims of resource allocation and –
within a limited health budget – a commitment to tack-
ling oversupply as well as undersupply [34].
