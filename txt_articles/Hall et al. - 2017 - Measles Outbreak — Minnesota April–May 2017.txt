On April 10, 2017, the Minnesota Department of Health 
(MDH) was notified about a suspected measles case. The patient 
was a hospitalized child aged 25 months who was evaluated for fever 
and rash, with onset on April 8. The child had no history of receipt 
of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and no travel history or 
known exposure to measles. On April 11, MDH received a report 
of a second hospitalized, unvaccinated child, aged 34 months, with 
an acute febrile rash illness with onset on April 10. The second 
patient’s sibling, aged 19 months, who had also not received MMR 
vaccine, had similar symptoms, with rash onset on March 30. Real-
time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) 
testing of nasopharyngeal swab or throat specimens performed at 
MDH confirmed measles in the first two patients on April 11, and 
in the third patient on April 13; subsequent genotyping identified 
genotype B3 virus in all three patients, who attended the same child 
care center. MDH instituted outbreak investigation and response 
activities in collaboration with local health departments, health 
care facilities, child care facilities, and schools in affected settings. 
Because the outbreak occurred in a community with low MMR 
vaccination coverage, measles spread rapidly, resulting in thousands 
of exposures in child care centers, schools, and health care facilities. 
By May 31, 2017, a total of 65 confirmed measles cases had been 
reported to MDH (Figure 1); transmission is ongoing.
Investigation and Results
After receiving notification of the first case on April 10, MDH 
and the Hennepin County Human Services and Public Health 
Department began an investigation. The Council of State and 
Territorial Epidemiologists and CDC case definition* was used 
* An acute illness in a Minnesota resident during January 1, 2017–May 12, 2017, 
characterized by generalized, maculopapular rash lasting ≥3 days with a temperature 
≥101°F (≥38.3°C) and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis. A confirmed case is an acute 
febrile rash illness with isolation of measles virus from a clinical specimen; or 
detection of measles-virus specific nucleic acid from a clinical specimen using 
polymerase chain reaction; or immunoglobulin G seroconversion or a significant 
rise in measles immunoglobulin G antibody using an evaluated and validated 
method; or a positive serologic test for measles immunoglobulin M antibody; or 
direct epidemiologic linkage to a case confirmed by one of these methods.
to identify confirmed cases of measles in Minnesota (1). A health 
alert was issued April 12, which notified health care providers 
of the two measles cases in Hennepin County and provided 
recommendations concerning laboratory testing for measles 
and strategies to minimize transmission in health care settings. 
Emphasis was placed on recommendations for all children 
aged ≥12 months to receive a first dose of MMR. Providers 
identified patients with suspected measles based on clinical 
findings and reported suspected cases to MDH. Testing with 
rRT-PCR was performed at MDH on nasopharyngeal or throat 
swabs and urine specimens. Among persons testing positive by 
rRT-PCR who had received vaccine ≤21 days before the test, 
genotyping was performed to distinguish wild-type measles virus

(genotype B3 virus) from the vaccine virus (genotype A virus). 
Patients (or their parents or guardians) with confirmed measles 
were interviewed by local public health officials to confirm symp-
toms, onset date, and exposure history for the 21 days before 
rash onset and identify contacts during their infectious period 
(4 days before through 4 days after rash onset). Contacts were 
defined as persons who had any contact with patients during 
their infectious period.
Among the 65 confirmed cases, the median patient age was 
21 months (range = 3 months–49 years). Patients were residents 
of Hennepin, Ramsey, LeSueur, and Crow Wing counties. 
During April 10–May 31, confirmed measles patients were iden-
tified in five schools, 12 child care centers, three health care facili-
ties, and numerous households; an estimated 8,250 persons were 
potentially exposed to measles in these settings. Rash onset dates 
ranged from March 30–May 27, 2017. Sixty-two (95%) cases 
were identified in unvaccinated persons, including 50 (77%) in 
children aged ≥12 months (i.e., age-eligible for MMR vaccina-
tion). U.S.-born children of Somali descent (Somali children) 
accounted for 55 (85%) of the cases. Among the three patients

with a history of measles vaccination, all had received 2 MMR 
doses before illness onset. As of May 31, 20 (31%) patients had 
been hospitalized, primarily for treatment of dehydration or 
pneumonia; no deaths had been reported.
Public Health Response
Rosters and attendance records were obtained from child 
care centers and schools where persons might have been 
exposed to measles, and the vaccination status of each 
attendee was verified through the Minnesota Immunization 
Information Connection, a system that stores electronic 
immunization records (http://www.health.state.mn.us/
miic). Health care facilities similarly identified contacts 
who were exposed to measles patients and followed up with 
susceptible (i.e., unvaccinated, pregnant, or immunocom-
promised) exposed persons. In accordance with the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices 2013 guidelines (2), 
postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with MMR or immune 
globulin was recommended for susceptible, exposed persons. 
Persons who received PEP with MMR within 72 hours of 
exposure or with immune globulin within 6 days of exposure 
were placed on a 21-day self-monitoring symptom watch for 
development of fever or rash, but could continue attending 
child care and school. Susceptible exposed persons who 
did not receive PEP according to recommendations were 
excluded from child care centers or school, and MDH rec-
ommended that they avoid public gatherings for 21 days, 
including having visitors who were susceptible to measles 
virus. By May 31, at least 154 persons had received PEP 
(26 MMR doses and 128 courses of immune globulin), 
and 586 susceptible exposed persons who did not receive 
recommended PEP were excluded from child care centers or 
school and advised to receive MMR vaccination to protect 
against future measles illness.
On April 18, as the outbreak continued, MDH recom-
mended an accelerated MMR schedule; to provide additional 
protection, a second dose of MMR vaccine was recommended 
for children who had received a first dose >28 days previ-
ously.† These recommendations were initially for all children 
living in Hennepin County and for all Minnesota Somali 
children regardless of county of residence, because MMR 
coverage rates among Somali children in Hennepin County 
have declined since 2007. In 2014, coverage with the first 
dose of MMR among Somali children in Hennepin County 
was 35.6% (Figure 2). In response to the rapid increase in the 
† The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends 
MMR vaccine for prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella for persons aged 
≥12 months. ACIP recommends 2 doses of MMR vaccine routinely for children, 
with the first dose administered at age 12 through 15 months and the second 
dose administered at age 4 through 6 years before school entry. https://www.
cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm.
number of reported cases, on May 4, 2017, MDH recom-
mended an accelerated vaccination schedule for all children 
aged ≥12 months residing in all counties where a measles case 
had been reported during the previous 42 days; MDH further 
recommended that health care providers throughout the state 
consider using an accelerated schedule.
Previously established culturally appropriate community out-
reach approaches (e.g., working with community and spiritual 
leaders, interpreters, health care providers, and community 
members) (3) were intensified during the outbreak. Using exist-
ing partnerships, state and local public health officials worked 
with MDH Somali public health advisors, Somali medical pro-
fessionals, faith leaders, elected officials, and other community 
leaders to disseminate educational materials, attend community 
events, and create opportunities for open dialogue and educa-
tion about measles and concerns about MMR vaccine. Child 
care centers and schools were provided talking points and 
informational sheets on measles and MMR vaccine, and posters 
with key messages were distributed in mosques and shopping 
malls popular with the Somali community. Community out-
reach focused on oral communication, which is preferred by 
this community, including radio and television messaging and 
telephone call-in lines that permit approximately 500 persons 
at a time to listen to a health professional.
Outreach to encourage vaccination was increased during the out-
break. By the second week of May, the average number of MMR 
vaccine doses administered per week in Minnesota had increased 
from 2,700 doses before the outbreak to 9,964, as reported by the 
Minnesota Immunization Information Connection.
Discussion
Minnesota law requires that children aged ≥2 months be 
vaccinated against certain diseases or file a medical or consci-
entious exemption to enroll in school, child care, or school-
based early childhood programs. Before 2008, first-dose MMR 
vaccination coverage among Minnesota-born Somali children 
aged 2 years in Hennepin County exceeded 90%. However, 
MMR vaccination coverage rates declined among Minnesota’s 
Somali-American community members starting with the 2008 
birth-year cohort. The decline in vaccination coverage was in 
response to concerns about autism, the perceived increased 
rates of autism in the Somali-American community, and the 
misunderstanding that autism was related to MMR vaccine 
(3,4). Studies have consistently documented that there is not 
a relationship between vaccines and autism (5,6). The low 
vaccination rate resulted in a community highly susceptible to 
measles. Parental concerns were addressed by building trust with 
the community and identifying effective, culturally appropriate 
ways to address questions, concerns, and misinformation about 
MMR vaccine. In 2011, a smaller measles outbreak began in

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 
but continues to circulate in many regions of the world and can 
be imported into the United States by travelers. Measles vaccine 
is highly effective, with 1 dose being 93% effective and 2 doses 
being 97% effective at preventing measles.
What is added by this report?
In a community with previously high vaccination coverage, 
concerns about autism, the perceived increased rates of autism 
in the Somali-American community, and the misunderstanding 
that autism was related to the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) 
vaccine resulted in a decline in MMR vaccination coverage to a 
level low enough to sustain widespread measles transmission in 
the Somali-American community following introduction of the 
virus. Studies have consistently documented that there is not a 
relationship between vaccines and autism.
What are the implications for public health practice?
This outbreak demonstrates the challenge of combating 
misinformation about MMR vaccine and the importance of 
creating long-term, trusted relationships with communities to 
disseminate scientific information in a culturally appropriate 
and effective manner.
the Somali community in Hennepin County and resulted in 21 
cases, including eight cases in persons of Somali descent (4,7). 
At that time, the 1-dose MMR vaccination coverage rate among 
Somali children aged 2 years in Hennepin County was 54%. The 
source of the 2011 outbreak was a Somali child aged 30 months 
who acquired measles while visiting Kenya (7). However, the 
source of the current outbreak is unknown, which suggests that 
additional cases have likely occurred that did not come to the 
attention of health care providers or public health departments.
Although indigenous measles transmission has been elimi-
nated in the United States, the virus continues to circulate 
widely in many regions of the world, including Africa, 
Europe, and parts of Asia, and is often introduced into the 
United States by international travelers (8). High measles 
vaccination coverage rates across subpopulations within com-
munities are necessary to prevent the spread of measles. The 
current Minnesota measles outbreak, with 31% (20 of 65) of 
cases requiring hospitalization, demonstrates the importance 
of addressing low vaccination coverage rates to ensure that 
children are adequately protected from a potentially serious 
vaccine-preventable disease (3).
