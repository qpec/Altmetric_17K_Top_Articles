Abstract
Background
After more than a decade of steadily declining notifications, the number of reported cholera
cases has recently increased in Vietnam. We conducted a matched case-control study to
investigate transmission of cholera during an outbreak in Ben Tre, southern Vietnam, and to
explore the associated risk factors.
Methodology/Principal findings
Sixty of 71 diarrheal patients confirmed to be infected with cholera by culture and diag-
nosed between May 9 and August 3, 2010 in Ben Tre were consecutively recruited as
case-patients. Case-patients were matched 1:4 to controls by commune, sex, and 5-year
age group. Risk factors for cholera were examined by multivariable conditional logistic
regression. In addition, environmental samples from villages containing case-patients
were taken to identify contamination of food and water sources. The regression indicated
that drinking iced tea (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 8.40, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.84–39.25), not always boiling drinking water (aOR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.03–6.67), having
the main source of water for use being close to a toilet (aOR = 4.36, 95% CI: 1.37–13.88),
living with people who had acute diarrhea (aOR = 13.72, 95% CI: 2.77–67.97), and little
or no education (aOR = 4.89, 95% CI: 1.18–20.19) were significantly associated with
increased risk of cholera. In contrast, drinking stored rainwater (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI:
0.04–0.63), eating cooked seafood (aOR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.10–0.73), and eating steamed
vegetables (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07–0.70) were protective against cholera. Vibrio cho-
lerae O1 Ogawa carrying ctxA was found in two of twenty-five river water samples and
one of six wastewater samples.

 Conclusions/Significance
The magnitude of the cholera outbreak in Ben Tre was lower than in other similar settings.
This investigation identified several risk factors and underscored the importance of contin-
ued responses targeting cholera prevention in southern Vietnam. The association between
drinking iced tea and cholera and the spread of V. cholerae O1, altered El Tor strains war-
rant further research. These findings might be affected by a number of limitations due to
the inability to capture asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections, the possible underre-
porting of personal unhygienic behaviors, and the purposive selection of environmental
samples.
Author summary
Cholera is a highly contagious, acute diarrheal illness, which poses a profound health
threat in many parts of the less developed world. The majority of cases are reported from
Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia, and the Americas (i.e., Haiti) where infections are
primarily transmitted through ingestion of contaminated water. Today in the era of
widely available rehydration therapies and antibiotics, deaths due to cholera are quite
rare. Despite this, early detection of contaminated water sources is crucial for directing
early interventions for curbing community-wide transmission. The authors found evi-
dence linking an outbreak of cholera in southern Vietnam to consumption of unsafe
water, especially drinking iced tea. This finding suggests the need for a water-monitoring
system at ice-making plants. Further research is needed to confirm the biological link
between iced tea consumption and cholera infection. Larger studies should also be con-
ducted to understand the clinical consequences of infection with the new cholera agent
(V. cholerae O1, altered El Tor strains).
Introduction
Cholera is a highly contagious diarrheal disease, caused by infection of the Gram-negative bac-
terium Vibrio cholerae [1]. Areas with poverty, high population-density, poor sanitation, poor
education levels, and lack of potable water are at risk for cholera outbreaks [2–4]. An estimated
1.3–4.0 million illnesses and 21,000–143,000 deaths are attributed directly to the disease,
which is predominantly seen in Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia, and the Americas (i.e.,
Haiti) [5]. Consumption of contaminated water is thought to be the main mode of transmis-
sion [6–8].
Prior to implementation of control measures, Vietnam suffered a disproportionate burden
of cholera. For example, between 1979 and 1996, there were 56,050 reported cases of cholera
and 1,272 deaths due to cholera in this country [9]. Oral cholera vaccination programs were
introduced in highly endemic areas through a national expanded program of immunization in
1997 [10]. The program, in conjunction with improved personal hygiene and access to potable
drinking water associated with both health promotion programs and economic growth, led to
a substantial drop in the number of notified cholera cases [6, 10]. However, these gains have
not been sustained. Resource constraints [10] as well as the modest vaccine effectiveness, esti-
mated to be 76% during the outbreak and 50% after 3–5 years [11, 12], have jeopardized the
long-term impact of this program.

 There were a total of 3,646 cholera cases reported between 2006 and 2010 in Vietnam,
which was nearly five times higher than the number of notification made during 2001–2005
(747 cases) [13]. Of concern, from both a clinical and public health perspective, is the emer-
gence and transmission of V. cholerae O1, El Tor strains that produce the classical cholera
toxin [14] and the circulation of strains genetically resistant to certain antibiotics [9, 15]. Out-
breaks in Hanoi and neighboring regions in northern Vietnam in 2007–2008 have been linked
to contaminated food, especially dog meat, raw vegetables, and raw pig/duck blood [11, 13].
However, the pathways for the transmission of cholera in other parts of the country have not
yet been investigated.
In this article, we report a cholera outbreak in the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre in
2010. We conducted a matched case-control study to identify risk factors for cholera infection,
and examined environmental samples to identify contaminated food and water sources. These
data are useful for informing targeted and effective responses to cholera outbreaks in Vietnam.
Methods
Study settings
Ben Tre province is located in the Mekong Delta region of southern Vietnam. It has a popula-
tion of 1.3 million people and a largely agricultural economy. This coastal province is about
1.25 meters above sea level and is almost surrounded by water (Fig 1). Due to low piped-water
coverage, river water is generally used as one of the main sources of water among the popula-
tion. The last mass oral cholera vaccine program was implemented in 2002, and no cholera

 cases had been reported since 2005 [10, 16]. However, in 2010, an outbreak of cholera occurred
in the province, starting in Mo Cay town on May 9. A total of 71 cases were identified in the
outbreak (Fig 1).
Collection of food and water samples
We employed a purposive sampling technique to collect water samples from several types of
water sources in Mo Cay and Giong Trom towns, where the first cholera cases were reported
in this outbreak. They included 25 samples of river water obtained from the rivers closest to
case-patients’ houses; six samples of indoor water, six wastewater samples, and two samples of
drinking water in case-patients’ houses. In addition, 27 samples of fresh seafood were obtained
from local markets where the case-patients lived.
Case-control study
From June 4 through July 2, 2010, we conducted a matched case-control study with a target
sample size of 60 case-patients and 240 controls. Because the outbreak occurred in a not well-
defined population and required rapid investigation, the case-control study would be the most
appropriate choice of study design to identify risk factors for cholera infection [17]. In this
study, the matching by age groups, sex, and living areas was used [18]. The sample size of this
study for 80% power at 5% level of significance was calculated on the basis of the estimated
percentage of controls exposed to unsafe water (30%), the ratio of controls to cases (4), and an
odds ratio (OR, 2.25) as per the method of Kelsey and colleagues [19]. The estimated magni-
tude of OR that we used to calculate the sample size came from the previous work of Hoge and
his colleagues [8]. The smallest reported OR was selected to ensure that the study was large
enough and had sufficient statistical power in identifying risk factors with an expected OR of
2.25 or higher.
During this outbreak, all patients with acute watery diarrhea who sought diagnosis and
treatment for their disease at local health facilities were immediately transferred to the nearest
cholera treatment center. In all, there were four centers, which were established soon after the
outbreak was confirmed and located in three distant local hospitals and one neighboring hos-
pital (Fig 1). In these centers, case-patients were identified, quarantined, and treated, and they
were considered eligible for inclusion if they had laboratory-confirmed V. cholerae identified
through conditional culture of rectal swabs and resided permanently in Ben Tre province. For
this study, case-patients identified since the beginning of the outbreak were consecutively
recruited until the target sample size was reached. Case-patients who were under cholera treat-
ment were prospectively recruited through the four cholera treatment centers, while case-
patients who had already been discharged from these health facilities were contacted and
recruited at their homes.
For each case, four community-based controls [20] were selected and matched by com-
mune, sex and 5-year age group to control for the potential confounding effects of these three
factors. They were recruited at their homes on the same day as the interview of their matched
case. Specifically, the control search began with random selection of four sub-communes in
the area where the case resided by using Microsoft Excel. In each of these sub-communes, cur-
rently registered houses were numbered and one house was then chosen by hand drawing
from the Vietnamese bingo game, a set containing 90 balls numbered 1–90. Interviewers
subsequently accessed the selected house, in which all household members were primarily
screened by sex and age to identify a potential control. Controls were further screened by
interviewers to ensure that they had not had acute diarrhea in the month prior to the interview.
If no person in that house met the inclusion criteria, the interviewers went to the next house to

 the left until a matched control was found. No control persons that we approached refused to
participate in the present study and be interviewed.
Trained health-workers used a structured questionnaire to collect the study information
during face-to-face interviews. This questionnaire was adapted from a cholera case investiga-
tion form previously developed and used in Ho Chi Minh City in 2008. For the present study,
it was extended and included a section for controls. Risk variables included were based on
reports in the literature [8, 21] and primary assessments conducted at the beginning of the out-
break. The questionnaire contained questions to elicit information on socio-demographic
characteristics, exposure to people with diarrheal diseases, recent travel history, and detailed
consumption of food and water. The logic and language of questions were tested locally in Ben
Tre before being used to collect data. For children aged <6 years, interviews were conducted
with their parents or guardians. Potential contaminated food sources were identified through
dichotomous questions about the different types of food eaten, eating places, and cooking
methods (e.g., well-cooked, stir fried, cooked rare, and raw) within five days before the onset
of diarrhea for case-patients or five days before being interviewed for control persons. Partici-
pants were also asked about their sources and characteristics of water used for drinking, cook-
ing, and bathing, and their drinking habits (e.g., the use of boiled water and drinking water
with ice) via several dichotomous questions in the previous seven days. Clinical symptoms and
health-seeking behaviors since the onset of diarrheal symptoms were also collected. Rectal
swabs were collected from controls after completion of the interview.
Laboratory analysis
During the outbreak, rectal swabs of people with acute diarrhea were directly placed in Cary Blair
Transport Medium and transported daily to the Pasteur Institute, Ho Chi Minh City (PI-HCMC)
for identification of V. cholerae using a standard testing protocol [22, 23]. All controls’ rectal swabs
and environmental samples were stored at the Ben Tre Provincial Preventive Centre and trans-
ported fortnightly to the PI-HCMC for testing. Specifically, swab specimens were enriched in alka-
line peptone water (Oxoid) and inoculated for 6–8 hours. We then cultured the bacterial solution
obtained on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar (Merck) and carried out biochemical and
agglutination tests (Denka Seiken). We further used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify
the V. cholera isolations from the swab culture, environmental samples, to identify the genomic
region encoding the O1/O139 genotypes, and to detect cholera toxins and other toxin-specific
genes, specifically ctxA, ctxB, rtxC, and rstC, using previously published primers [24–28] according
to the PCR method described by Nguyen et al.[29]. A 9 μl of amplicon was separated by electro-
phoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with an ultraviolet light on the Gel Doc System (Bio-
Rad Laboratories). Test results were immediately reported to the attending physicians and the
local preventive centers for personal treatment and prevention purposes, respectively.
Ethical statements.
In Vietnam, the emergence of cholera is a significant health threat
that requires a rapid public health response to protect the entire community from this severe,
highly contagious diarrheal disease, and minimize any negative domino effects on population
health. For this reason and in view of case-patients’ consent for cholera diagnosis and treat-
ment at hospitals and the minimal risks to the subjects in this outbreak investigation, our
request of a waiver of documentation of written informed consent for all participants was
reviewed and approved by the local health authority in Ben Tre. A prepared sample verbal con-
sent script was read to the participants. Verbal consents were obtained from all participants
and documented through the use of a record of names kept in a secure and locked cabinet
at the PI-HCMC. The outbreak investigation and study procedures have been reviewed and
ratified by the PI-HCMC Institutional Review Board (reference number: 16/CN-HÐÐÐ).

 Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata version 14 (StataCrop LP, College Station, TX).
Information about the participants in the case-control study were initially explored using
descriptive statistics (including frequency and proportion for categorical variables and median
and range for continuous variables), with comparisons between case-patients and controls
made by McNemar’s chi-square tests. Children aged <6 years were classified as not having
consumed a certain food or water if their parents or guardians reported that they did not con-
sume it over the study period. To identify risk factors for cholera, conditional logistic regres-
sion with forward selection was used to estimate matched OR and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) as per the method of Hosmer and his colleagues [30]. Initially, univariate analyses were
employed to identify variables that were potential risk factors for cholera infection. Those vari-
ables with p<0.25, along with those which have been acknowledged to have biologic plausibil-
ity for increasing the risk of cholera, were considered for inclusion in the multivariable model.
The analysis began by fitting the base model, which included cholera variable, participants’
age, and a variable that yielded the lowest corresponding p-value in univariate analyses. The
variable with the next lowest p-value was progressively added to the model, and its contribu-
tion to model fit was tested by the log likelihood ratio test. If the test yielded a p-value less than
0.05, it was kept in the model. This process continued until the added variable made no signifi-
cant improvement in model fit. As the level of education may behaviorally influence personal
eating and drinking habits, we investigated potential effect modification by creating interac-
tion terms between it and the other variables retained in the final model. In a sensitivity analy-
sis, to accommodate missing data, we applied multiple imputation by chained equations, with
an assumption of missingness at random. Ten imputed datasets were used with 1,000 itera-
tions. We compared the risk factors found between the original and imputed data sets.
Results
The outbreak
From May 9 (epidemiologic week 19) through August 3 (epidemiologic week 31), 2010, 71 cases
of cholera were identified in all towns of Ben Tre province. The area with the highest number of
cases was Mo Cay (46 cases), followed by Giong Trom (12 cases) and Ba Tri (7 cases) (Fig 1). The
number of cases continued to increase, peaked during May 30 to June 5 (epidemiologic week 22),
and then gradually decreased over time (Fig 2). No case-patient died during the outbreak.
After confirmation of the outbreak on May 12, 2010, Ben Tre rapidly rolled-out its control
activities in the entire province. It included measures to isolate and treat case-patients at four
cholera treatment centers, clean and disinfect their houses with chloramine B, and provide
chloramine B to enhance the use of chloramine-treated water among people living in the
areas where the case-patients emerged. Case-patient’s close contacts were traced, given a single
dose of prophylactic ciprofloxacin, and monitored their health. Education campaigns were
additionally made to encourage people in the entire province to practice safe water, proper
sanitation, and food safety. As reports of primary risk assessments suggested a potential link
between drinking iced water and the illness, on June 11, 2010, the government of Ben Tre pro-
hibited the manufacture, transportation, sale, or supply of commercial ice in the two most
affected towns of Mo Cay and Giong Trom.
Laboratory and environmental results
In total, only V. cholerae O1 Ogawa, El Tor biotype was isolated from 71cholera cases. The
ctxA, ctxB, rtxC, and rstC genes were exhibited in 97%, 100%, 100%, and 97% of all isolates,

 suggesting a presence of altered El Tor strains that combine characteristics of classical and El
Tor strains. Due to resource constraints, only 193 rectal swabs taken from 240 controls were
tested for cholera. V. cholerae was not detected in any controls’ rectal swabs.
Two out of twenty five river water samples and one out of six wastewater samples were cul-
ture positive for V. cholerae. PCR analysis revealed the presence of V. cholerae O1 Ogawa car-
rying ctxA in all of these three positive-culture samples. V. cholerae was absent in two samples
of drinking water, six samples of indoor water, and twenty-seven samples of fresh seafood.
Case-control investigation
After excluding seven case-patients lost to follow-up and four case-patients whose disease
occurred after the target sample size had been reached, a total of 60 case-patients occurring
from May 9 through June 26 were consecutively included in a matched case-control study and
matched to 240 controls. Forty case-patients were prospectively recruited through the cholera
treatment centers and twenty case-patients were recruited at their homes. The case-patients
were interviewed from June 4 through July 2, 2010. Nine case-patients and 32 control persons
had missing data on at least one variable. Except for age, no significant discrepancies were
recorded between the missing and non-missing subjects on variables (Table A in S1 File).
Demographic features and risk factors are listed in Table 1. Two thirds of subjects were
females. Participants’ ages ranged from two months to 83 years for the case-patients and from
one month to 87 years for the controls. For those aged six years or older, 73% of the case-

 patients and 57% of the controls reported having little education (primary education or
illiterate).
The median number of case-patient’s stools within a day prior to hospital admission was
eight (range: 2–20), 55% had watery stools, 40% had abdominal pain, and 53% had vomiting.
The mean time of admission to local hospitals was 0.7 days after the onset of the disease, and
the mean time lag between case onset and enrolment of controls was 12 days among the case-
patients.
Fishpond or river toilets were frequent in both the case-patient’s and control’s houses (73%
and 73%, respectively). A flush toilet in house was reported in 22% of the case-patients and
25% of the controls (p = 0.404). Thirty percent of the case-patients reported that their main
sources of water for use were close to a toilet, whereas only 14% of the controls had a similar
situation (p <0.001). A self-report of changes in the color, odor, appearance and taste of water
used was seen in 15% of the case-patients and 8% of the controls (p = 0.029).
Among the case-patients surveyed, 22% reported drinking iced tea within one week before
the disease onset, compared with 3% of the controls in the week before being interviewed (p <
0.001). A higher percentage of the case-patients than the controls consumed water with ice
(81% vs. 68%, p = 0.001), unboiled water (65% vs. 43%, p <0.001), and sedimented river water
(12% vs. 5%, p = 0.014). Up to 52%, 33%, and 42% of the case-patients used sedimented river
water as the source of water for bathing, brushing teeth/gargling, and cooking, respectively.
These levels were nearly twice as high as those for the controls (30%, 16%, and 21%, respec-
tively; all p-values <0.001). The case-patients were less likely to use stored rainwater for both
drinking (70% vs. 89%, p <0.001) and cooking (23% vs. 41%, p <0.001), but they were more
likely to drink bottled water (20% vs. 13%, p = 0.027) than the controls. The use of indoor tap
water for both drinking and cooking was rarely seen in this sample.
The case-patients were less likely to eat cooked seafood (62% vs. 81%, p<0.001), steamed
vegetables (12% vs. 31%, p <0.001) and raw vegetables (23% vs. 32%, p = 0.027) in comparison
with the controls.
While only 2% of the controls were living with people who had acute diarrhea, 15% of the
case-patients did so (p <0.001). The case-patients had a greater percentage of travel out of
town in the week prior to the disease onset than the controls (37% vs. 20%, p <0.001).

regression are summarized in Table 2. Individuals who reported drinking iced tea (adjusted
OR (aOR) = 8.40, 95% CI: 1.84–39.25), not always boiling drinking water (aOR = 2.62, 95%
CI: 1.03–6.67), living with people who had acute diarrhea (aOR = 13.72, 95% CI: 2.77–67.97),
having the main household sources of water for use close to a toilet (aOR = 4.36, 95% CI: 1.37–
13.88), and having little or no education (aOR = 4.89, 95% CI: 1.18–20.19) were significantly
associated with an elevated risk of cholera. The risk of cholera was lower among persons who
drank stored rainwater (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04–0.63), ate cooked seafood (aOR = 0.27, 95%
CI: 0.10–0.73), and ate steamed vegetables (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07–0.70). No significant
interactions were recorded throughout the analysis. Only the level of education become insig-
nificant in another regression analysis based on a multiple imputation approach (Table B in
S1 File).
Discussion
In this investigation of the 2010 Ben Tre cholera outbreak, most risk factors identified have
been previously described and associated with exposure to unsafe water (such as, not always
drinking boiled water, main source of water close to toilet) or with proximity with another
possible case who had acute diarrhea. Our results revealed a significantly increased risk of

 cholera among individuals who reported drinking iced tea in the week before the onset of their
illness. We also observed substantial cholera risk reductions in some subpopulations, specifi-
cally those who drank stored rainwater and ate cooked seafood or steamed vegetables.
Our study suggested that the spread of cholera in Ben Tre was quite considerable, but not
nearly as high as had been seen in Hanoi [11] and other Southeast Asian settings [31, 32].

 chloramine B to treat surface water, its low population density (an estimated 533 people/km2),
and a prohibition of ice block production business during the outbreak could have contributed
to the relatively smaller size of the outbreak in Ben Tre province. In agreement with previous
studies [14, 26, 32, 33], we found evidence that V. cholerae O1, altered El Tor was prevalent
among the case-patients. There were no reported deaths attributable to any strains of cholera
among the case-patients in this outbreak. This finding could help to address the previously
reported clinical concern that the spread of these strains with increased severity would lead to
more cholera deaths in some areas of the world [34].
We know of no previous studies that have reported increased risk of infection specifically
associated with iced tea consumption. Locally, iced tea is made by adding cooled boiled tea to
a glass or bottle of ice. Ice is typically bought from street vendors rather than prepared at home
in rural or semi-rural areas of Vietnam because less than one-eighth (12%) of rural households
own a refrigerator [35]. A previous hospital-based case-control study conducted in Thailand
demonstrated that consumption of ice was significantly associated with increased risk of chol-
era in a bivariate analysis but was not significant in the multivariable model [8]. In our out-
break investigation, we were not able to obtain commercial and household ice for testing for
the presence of V. cholerae in ice. We were therefore unable to ascertain the underlying micro-
biological mechanism leading to the association between drinking iced tea and cholera. A pre-
vious study, conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, showed that a large percentage of ice (35%) and
beverages (24%) were contaminated with V. cholerae [36]. In Vietnam where untreated wells
and surface water (i.e. river water) have been commonly used for making commercial ice, it
is possible for V. cholerae to be introduced into commercial ice, and such contamination
could have triggered this resurgence of cholera in Ben Tre province. The observation that the
decline in the weekly reported number of cholera was seen after the local government prohib-
ited on the manufacture, transportation, sale, or supply of commercial ice in the outbreak area
supports this hypothesis. In future outbreaks, further epidemiological and microbiological
investigation of the association between commercial ice and cholera is warranted. The micro-
biological quality of the water used at ice manufacturing plants should be tested regularly.
Our other risk factors for cholera included living with people who had acute diarrheal ill-
ness and not always boiling drinking water. These are well-described predictors of cholera in
endemic countries [8, 37]. The association between having the main source of water for use
being close to the toilets indicates that pollution of drinking water sources by contaminated
feces remains a problem in Vietnam and could lead to further spread of disease in future chol-
era outbreaks [38]. As expected, we found that drinking stored rainwater, eating cooked sea-
food, and eating steamed vegetables were protective against cholera, and these results are
consistent with findings from several previous studies [21, 39]. Local public health authorities
should rapidly roll out a response that involves appropriate case management and greater pro-
motion of proper sanitation, safe water, and food safety in the event of a cholera outbreak [40].
Our observation that individuals who reported little or no education were at a higher risk of
cholera is consistent with the results of a previous case-control study in Harare City, Zimba-
bwe in which having attained less than secondary education was found to be a risk factor for
cholera [41]. Poor education is part of the cycle of poverty, which includes crowded living con-
ditions, malnourishment, poor household sanitation and personal hygiene practices [42],
which are well-known to be important risk factors for cholera [43].
This study has several limitations. First, the number of cholera cases reported herein might
not have reflected the actual burden of cholera in Ben Tre province. The vast majority of peo-
ple infected with V. cholerae are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and thus might not
seek healthcare services [44]. Second, detection of V. cholerae in some water samples obtained
only from Mo Cay and Giong Trom should be interpreted with caution, because the degree to

 which these samples are representative of environmental sources in other towns throughout
the province where case-patients occurred is unknown. Third, selection of controls from the
commune where the case-patients resided can limit exploration of some important geographi-
cal and cultural risk factors, such as exposure to river water, due to similar exposures between
the controls and the case-patients. Fourth, reduced recall of information may have occurred
among case-patients recruited and interviewed late. To reduce the need to recall distant expo-
sures among both the case-patients and controls, study questions were specific to food/water
and location. Fifth, about 20% of controls’ rectal swabs were not tested for cholera, potentially
misclassifying case-patients as controls. However, such misclassification was unlikely as 80%
of controls’ rectal swabs tested were negative for V. cholerae. Sixth, as with other behavioral
studies that depend entirely on face-to-face interviews, this study may under-report some
important risks, such as food and personal hygiene practices. To reduce this bias, we selected
well-trained, experienced, and unprejudiced interviewers after the interview training. Lastly,
our study may not have enough power to detect rare risk factors for cholera.
Despite these limitations, this present study has important implications for Vietnam’s chol-
era responses. This emergence of cholera due to V. cholerae O1, altered El Tor emphasizes the
need for increased efforts to prevent the spread of cholera in southern Vietnam. Along with
traditional approaches that focus on enhancement of safe water, sanitation, and food safety,
combined with periodic provision of oral cholera vaccines, a water quality monitoring system
at ice-making plants should be established. It is vital to ensure the quality of the water supply,
reduce the introduction of V. cholerae into ice, and subsequently lower the risk of cholera in
Vietnam, a tropical setting where consumption of iced drinks is common.
