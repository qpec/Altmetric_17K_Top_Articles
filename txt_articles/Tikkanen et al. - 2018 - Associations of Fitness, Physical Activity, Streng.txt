BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown inverse associations 
among fitness, physical activity, and cardiovascular disease. However, little 
is known about these associations in individuals with elevated genetic 
susceptibility for these diseases.
METHODS: We estimated associations of grip strength, objective 
and subjective physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness with 
cardiovascular events and all-cause death in a large cohort of 502 
635 
individuals from the UK Biobank (median follow-up, 6.1 years; 
interquartile range, 5.4–6.8 years). Then we further examined these 
associations in individuals with different genetic burden by stratifying 
individuals based on their genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease 
and atrial fibrillation. We compared disease risk among individuals in 
different tertiles of fitness, physical activity, and genetic risk using lowest 
tertiles as reference.
RESULTS: Grip strength, physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness 
showed inverse associations with incident cardiovascular events (coronary 
heart disease: hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77–
0.81; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.97; and HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.63–0.74, 
per SD change, respectively; atrial fibrillation: HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–
0.76; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91–0.95; and HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.56–0.65, 
per SD change, respectively). Higher grip strength and cardiorespiratory 
fitness were associated with lower risk of incident coronary heart disease 
and atrial fibrillation in each genetic risk score group (Ptrend <0.001 in each 
genetic risk category). In particular, high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness 
were associated with 49% lower risk for coronary heart disease (HR, 
0.51; 95% CI, 0.38–0.69) and 60% lower risk for atrial fibrillation (HR, 
0.40; 95%, CI 0.30–0.55) among individuals at high genetic risk for these 
diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Fitness and physical activity demonstrated inverse 
associations with incident cardiovascular disease in the general 
population, as well as in individuals with elevated genetic risk for these 
diseases.

C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public 
health issue and societal burden worldwide. Ex-
ercise has been highlighted as a cost-effective 
strategy for CVD prevention; it improves cardiorespi-
ratory fitness (CRF) and muscular strength, which are 
both shown to be inversely associated with future CVD 
events in population-based studies.1,2 However, fitness 
and physical activity are hard to measure accurately and 
consistently on a large scale; thus, observational analy-
ses prospectively relating fitness and physical activity 
with new-onset CVD among healthy individuals have 
typically been limited to smaller study samples and self-
reported measures. Moreover, the extent to which the 
genetic risk for CVD can be compensated with exercise 
is not known.
In this article, we analyzed objective and subjective 
measures of fitness and physical activity together with 
information of CVD risk factors and genomics in rela-
tion to prospective CVD disease events and all-cause 
death in 502 
635 individuals from the UK Biobank. We 
had 2 aims: (1) evaluate associations of fitness and 
physical activity with incident cardiovascular disease 
and all-cause death, and (2) assess whether these as-
sociations are modified by genetic risk.
METHODS
Study Sample
From 2006 to 2010, >500 
000 individuals 40 to 69 years of 
age were enrolled in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal cohort 
study based in the United Kingdom. Participants have under-
gone a range of physical measurements, detailed assessments 
about health-related factors, and sampling of blood, urine, 
and saliva. The participants have also agreed to have their 
future health, including disease events, monitored. In our 
study, we utilized the data collected at the UK Biobank assess-
ment centers at baseline, combined with information on inci-
dent disease events from the hospital and death registry. After 
excluding individuals who had withdrawn consent at the time 
of the study and prevalent CVD events (N=19 
933), 482 
702 
individuals remained in our study sample for observational 
analyses of CVD. In addition, 2524 individuals reported too 
high or low reported values for physical activity variables 
according to data cleaning rules of International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ),3 and these were removed in 
analyses involving physical activity data. For analyses of CRF, 
we utilized a subset of 66 
438 individuals free from CVD at 
the baseline who underwent a submaximal exercise test on a 
treadmill. In addition, we also analyzed a subset of 103 
702 
individuals with objectively measured physical activity with a 
wrist-worn accelerometer. To evaluate the gene‒environment 
interaction effects of fitness and physical activity on disease 
incidence, we used 468 
095 individuals with genome-wide 
genetic data available (19 
311 prevalent CVD cases removed). 
The UK Biobank study was approved by the North West 
Multi-Center Research Ethics Committee, and all participants 
provided written informed consent to participate in the UK 
Biobank study. The study protocol is available online.4 The 
data reported in this article are available via application to the 
UK Biobank to other researchers for purposes of reproducing 
the results or replicating the procedure.
Baseline Data
In this study, the exposures of interest were different mea-
sures of fitness and physical activity (grip strength, total physi-
cal activity, and CRF). Grip strength was measured in a sitting 
position using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer. 
The participants were asked to squeeze the device as hard as 
they could for 3 seconds, and the maximum value reached 
during that time was recorded. Both hands were measured 
in turn (UK Biobank field ID 46 for left hand and 47 for right 
hand). In line with prior studies,5,6 to adjust for confounding 
of strength by body mass, we calculated relative grip strength 
as an average of measurements of right and left hand divided 
by weight (ID 21002). Physical activity was assessed with a 
short form IPAQ questionnaire,3 which includes 6 questions 
of frequency (IDs 864, 884, and 904) and duration (IDs 874, 
894, and 914) of walking, moderate-intensity exercise, and 
vigorous exercise. The answer “Unable to walk” in 864 was 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In this study of ≈500 
000 individuals from the UK 
Biobank, we report and compare the associations 
of objective and subjective measures of fitness and 
physical activity with prospective cardiovascular dis-
ease events and all-cause death.
• We found consistent and robust inverse associa-
tions, particularly between objective measures of 
fitness and physical activity, and 6 cardiovascular 
outcomes and total mortality.
• Using genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease 
and atrial fibrillation, we show that these inverse 
associations were present in each genetic risk cate-
gory, suggesting that elevated genetic risk for these 
diseases can be compensated for by exercise.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Little is known about the risk-modifying effects of 
exercise in individuals with increased genetic risk of 
cardiovascular disease.
• Our results demonstrating the risk-decreasing asso-
ciations of exercise across genetic risk strata have 
important public health impact; the knowledge 
that lifestyle choices have substantial effects on 
disease risk could encourage individuals to initiate 
a healthier lifestyle to reduce their overall risk.
• In the longer term, identifying subgroups based on 
genetic risk that benefit most from lifestyle inter-
ventions could help personalize prevention strate-
gies of chronic diseases.
• Furthermore, personalized prevention and treat-
ment strategies could help motivate individuals 
more efficiently compared with general guidelines.

recoded to 0, and “Prefer not to answer” and “Do not know” 
in all 6 variables were set missing. Objective assessment of 
physical activity was measured for a 7-day period using an 
Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer. The nonwear 
time was detected and imputed by the expert working group, 
and total physical activity was calculated by averaging all 
worn and imputed values.7 CRF was assessed with net oxy-
gen consumption, calculated from individuals’ body weight 
and maximum workload (ID 6032) during the cycle ergometry 
on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) using the equation 
net oxygen consumption=7+10.8(workload)/weight.8
In addition, we used information of potential confound-
ers, specifically age (field ID 21022), sex (ID 31), region of 
the UK biobank assessment center (ID 54; recoded to three 
groups: United Kingdom, Scotland, and Wales), ethnicity 
(ID 21000; recoded to 4 groups: white, black, Asian, and 
mixed), Townsend index reflecting socioeconomic status (ID 
189), smoking status (ID 20116; current, former, and never), 
body mass index (ID 21001), diabetes mellitus (ID 2443), lipid 
medication (ID 20003; including simvastatin, pravastatin, flu-
vastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, nicotinic acid 
product, or fenofibrate), systolic blood pressure (ID 4080, but 
if missing ID 93), and height (ID 50) as covariates in our mod-
els. The details of these measurements can be found in the 
study protocol.4
Outcomes and Follow-Up
The disease outcomes were defined as primary or second-
ary events using inpatient hospital and death registry data 
linked to the UK Biobank. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was 
defined as International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th 
edition (ICD-9) codes 410 to 411, edition 10 codes I20.0, I21, 
and I22, and surgical codes for percutaneous transluminal 
coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft (codes 
K40-K46, K49-K50, and K75). Stroke was defined as ischemic 
(ICD-9: 433–434; ICD-10: I63) or hemorrhagic stroke (ICD-
9: 430–432; ICD-10: I60–I62). Heart failure was defined as 
ICD-9 code 428 and ICD-10 code I50. Atrial fibrillation (AF) 
was defined as ICD-9 code 427.3, ICD-10 code I48, and surgi-
cal codes K50.1 and K62.2–K62.4. The hospital registry-based 
follow-up ended on March 31, 2015, in England; August 
31, 2014, in Scotland; and February 28, 2015, in Wales. 
Individuals were censored on these dates, the time of event 
in question, or the time of death, whichever occurred first. 
Death because of CVD was defined using the same ICD-10 
codes for different end points from the death registry. Death 
registry included all deaths that occurred before January 31, 
2016, in England and Wales and before November 30, 2015, 
in Scotland.
Statistical Analysis
Missing values of the baseline data were imputed with mul-
tivariate imputation by chained equation by using predictive 
mean matching.9 By using all variables of the final analysis 
model (frequency and duration of exercise, grip strength, 
body mass index, smoking, lipid medication, systolic blood 
pressure, diabetes mellitus, height, and Townsend index), the 
Nelson‒Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, and the event 
indicator as the input, we selected predictors for each variable 
with missing values by using quickpred function from mice 
package in R. This function computes predictor matrix for 
each variable based on (1) correlations between observed val-
ues of the variable of interest and other variables, and (2) cor-
relations between an indicator of missingness of the variable 
of interest and other variables. We performed 5 repetitions 
of imputations. The imputed values were compared with the 
observed values to evaluate the performance of the imputa-
tion. We then performed data quality control for frequency 
and duration variables and calculated total physical activity 
(IPAQ-PA) as MET hours per week according to the IPAQ scor-
ing protocol.3 We did not perform imputation for the CRF and 
acceleration variables.
Associations among measures of fitness, physical activ-
ity, and CVD events were analyzed using Cox proportional 
hazards models. The distributions of subjective (IPAQ) and 
objective (accelerometer) measures of physical activity were 
skewed, whereas the distributions of grip strength and CRF 
were approximately normal (Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Thus, to facilitate comparison between effect 
sizes of different measures, physical activity measures were 
first rank transformed, and then all measures were scaled to 
standard normal distribution. Analyses were conducted sep-
arately for CHD, AF, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and 
heart failure, as well as for composite CVD events. In sec-
ondary analyses, we also analyzed associations with all-cause 
death. Accelerometer data were used for all-cause death 
analysis only because of short follow-up (data were collected 
from May 2013 to December 2015). For each end point, we 
ran 3 sets of multivariable-adjusted models: (1) adjusting for 
age, sex, and region of the UK Biobank assessment center; 
(2) additional adjustment for possible confounders,2 including 
ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, lipid medication, sys-
tolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, height, and Townsend 
index; and (3) adjusting for IPAQ-PA or grip strength in addi-
tion to those in (2). Proportional hazards assumption was 
assessed using Schoenfeld’s test, and when not fulfilled 
(P≤0.001), we added interaction terms with time for those 
covariates for which proportional hazards assumption was 
not met. In addition, we stratified all models by region to 
allow different baseline hazard function for each stratum. All 
analyses were conducted separately for 5 imputed datasets, 
and results were pooled with Rubin’s rule.9
Next, we evaluated the risk-modifying associations of fit-
ness and physical activity in individuals with different genetic 
risk load for CHD and AF. First, we calculated a genetic risk 
score (GRS) for CHD and AF representing joint effects of 
individual and independent genetic markers. The genetic 
markers were selected from the largest (external from the 
UK Biobank) published genome-wide association study for 
CHD10 and AF,11 and the GRS was calculated as the weighted 
sum of the risk alleles by using effect sizes from the reference 
genome-wide association study10,11 as weights (Tables I and 
II in the online-only Data Supplement). The GRS was then 
divided into tertiles to stratify individuals into high, interme-
diate, and low genetic risk categories. Similarly, we stratified 
grip strength, IPAQ-PA, and CRF into tertiles to compare haz-
ard ratios for subjects in different groups. Individuals at the 
lowest GRS and grip strength, IPAQ-PA, and CRF tertile were 
used as the reference group in each model. In addition, we 
conducted a subgroup analysis by estimating the hazard ratios

(HRs) in each genetic risk group separately. Furthermore, to 
evaluate whether there was an interaction between exercise 
traits and genetic risk of CHD, we added interaction terms 
among the measures of fitness, physical activity, and GRS. The 
models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, genotype array, 
and 10 principal components and stratified by region of the 
UK Biobank assessment center.
RESULTS
The study characteristics are shown in Table 1. Mean 
age at baseline was 56.5 years (SD, 8.1 years), and 54% 
of subjects were females. During follow-up (median 6.1 
years; interquartile range, 5.4–6.8 years; 2 
899 
342 per-
son-years at risk), 20 
914 incident CVD cases occurred 
in participants free from the disease at baseline (8518 
CHD, 9836 AF, 2222 ischemic stroke, 1116 hemorrhag-
ic stroke, and 3298 heart failure events).
Observational Analyses
The results from observational analyses are shown in 
Tables 2 and 3. We found inverse associations between 
grip strength and all outcomes (HR between 0.59 for 
heart failure and 0.90 for hemorrhagic stroke) in our 
age-, sex-, and region-adjusted models. The associations 
were slightly attenuated when adjusting for confound-
ing factors but still highly significant. Grip strength was 
also associated with these end points after adjusting for 
IPAQ-PA.
Higher levels of IPAQ-PA were associated with lower 
risk of CVD events and all-cause death, but the as-
sociations were more modest than for grip strength 
(Tables 2-4). Associations with the composite CVD 
outcome, heart failure, and all-cause death remained 
significant after adjusting for confounding factors and 
grip strength. Physical activity assessed with a wrist-
worn accelerometer had the strongest inverse associa-
tion with all-cause death when compared with all oth-
er measures (HR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.46–0.58; Table 4). The HR for the subjective measure 
of physical activity, IPAQ-PA, was notably more modest 
than that of the objective measurement (HR, 0.83; 95% 
CI, 0.82–0.84; Table 4) than the association of physi-
cal activity objectively measured by accelerometer. The 
correlation of these 2 measures was modest (R=0.20), 
indicating substantial measurement inaccuracy in self-
reported physical activity.
In a subgroup analysis including 66 
438 individuals 
who underwent a submaximal fitness test, CRF was in-
versely associated with all CVD events, except hemor-
rhagic stroke (no. of events=91). The strongest associa-
tions were observed for heart failure (HR, 0.56; 95% 
CI, 0.49–0.65) and AF (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.56–0.65).
There were some evidence of nonlinear associations 
of fitness and physical activity on CVD events (Figures II 
through IV in the online-only Data Supplement) and all-
cause death (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement). 
In particular, the association of IPAQ-PA was U-shaped for 
CHD, AF, and CVD (Pnonlinearity <0.0001). However, objec-
tively measured physical activity by accelerometry did not 
show a similar U-shaped association with mortality (Figure 
V in the online-only Data Supplement).
Interactions Among Fitness, Physical 
Activity, Strength, and Genetic 
Determinants of CVD
Overall, individuals in the highest tertiles of the CHD 
and AF GRSs showed increased risk for incident CHD 
and AF when compared with those in the lowest ter-
tile (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.67–1.87; HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 
1.86–2.06, respectively). Further adjustment for tra-
ditional CVD risk factors (body mass index, smoking, 
lipid medication, systolic blood pressure, and diabe-
tes mellitus), grip strength, and physical activity did 
not change the results notably (Table 5). To compare 
the HRs for those at extreme ends of the GRS distri-
butions, we divided the CHD and AF GRSs into 20

groups. Those at the highest 5% of the GRS distri-
butions had 2.7- and 3.4-fold increased risk for CHD 
and AF, respectively, when compared with those at 
the lowest 5% (95% CI, 2.38–3.17 and 2.97–3.93, 
respectively; Table 5).
Grip strength and CRF demonstrated inverse asso-
ciations with incident CHD and AF in each GRS group 
(Ptrend <0.001 in each GRS group; Figures 1 and 2). High 
CRF was associated with 49% lower risk for CHD (HR, 
0.51; 95% CI, 0.38–0.69) and 60% lower risk for AF 
(HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30–0.55, compared with those at 
low CRF group) among individuals at the highest ter-
tiles of CHD and AF GRSs (Tables III and IV in the online-
only Data Supplement). Similarly, high grip strength 
was associated with lower risk for CHD (HR, 0.69; 95% 
CI, 0.62–0.75) and AF (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56–0.67), 
compared with those at low grip strength (Tables III and 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
IPAQ-PA showed inverse associations with CHD in the 
lowest and highest GRS group (Ptrend =0.007 and Ptrend 
=0.003, respectively) and with AF in the intermediate 
and highest GRS group (Ptrend <0.001 and Ptrend =0.004, 
 
respectively), but the inverse patterns of associations 
were more modest than for grip strength and CRF. The 
hazard ratio in the high CHD GRS group was 0.89 (95% 
CI, 0.82–0.96) and in the high AF GRS group 0.90 (95% 
CI, 0.83–0.97), compared with those at low IPAQ-PA 
(Tables III and IV in the online-only Data Supplement).

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
The overall inverse linear association of grip strength 
was strongest in the lowest GRS group (Pinteraction =0.0002 
for CHD, Pinteraction =0.01 for AF). For CRF, the pattern 
was similar for CHD (Pinteraction =0.03), whereas for AF, 
there was no statistically significant interaction (Pinteraction 
=0.22). For IPAQ-PA, we observed no significant differ-
ences by GRS groups (Pinteraction =0.52 for CHD, Pinteraction 
=0.37 for AF).
DISCUSSION
Principal Findings
In this study of 502 
635 individuals from the UK Bio-
bank, we analyzed the associations of objective and 
subjective measures of fitness and physical activity with 
6 cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality, and we 
explored these associations in individuals with different 
genetic burden for CVD. Our main findings were 2-fold. 
First, in an observational study of unprecedented size, 
we established that fitness and physical activity dem-
onstrated inverse associations with different types of 
incident CVD events. In addition, among all measures 
of fitness and physical activity, accelerometry-based 
physical activity showed the strongest inverse associa-
tion for the risk of premature death. It is interesting 
to note that the associations for questionnaire-based 
physical activity were weaker than those for objectively 
measured physical activity, and the correlation between 
these measures was low (R=0.20). Second, the inverse 
associations of grip strength and CRF with CHD and 
AF were seen in each category of genetic risk, indicat-
ing that maintaining good fitness can compensate for 
genetic risk of these diseases.
Comparison With Prior Literature
Exercise has been highlighted as a cost-effective pre-
vention strategy for CVD. Both human and animal 
studies have demonstrated multifactorial effects of 
exercise,12 including skeletal muscle growth, vascular 
remodeling, and beneficial effects on metabolism. Ex-
ercise also induces structural changes in cardiac muscle, 
which helps to protect against ischemic damage.12 In-
tervention studies have reported that both aerobic and 
strength training have favorable effects on cardiovas-
cular risk factors in individuals at high risk for CVD (eg, 
those with dyslipidemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus).13–15
Because of the challenges of measuring fitness and 
physical activity, studies relating these traits with pro-
spective CVD in the general population have previously 
been limited by small sample size or lack of measurement 
accuracy. Attempts to combine data in meta-analyses 
have had to use broad categories of fitness and physical 
activity to harmonize the data across many small stud-
ies.16,17 Compared with these studies, the UK Biobank 
has a clear advantage because the traits were measured 
in the same way in >500 
000 individuals. Nevertheless, 
our results are consistent with previous meta-analyses 
reporting weaker associations for questionnaire-based 
physical activity assessment when compared with objec-
tive measures.16 This finding suggests that associations 
of physical activity with outcome are most likely under-
estimated in studies using questionnaire data. Moreover, 
our results demonstrated a modest correlation between 
self-reported and objective physical activity, as well as a

U-shaped association between self-reported but not ob-
jective physical activity and all-cause death, suggesting 
that some additional factors might explain an increased 
risk in those individuals reporting high values of self-
reported physical activity.
Observational studies have reported contradictory re-
sults on the relationship among physical activity, fitness 
and AF. Although moderate-intensity exercise has been 
shown to decrease the risk of AF, especially long-term 
strenuous endurance exercise has been associated with 
an increased risk.18 For example, in contrast to our re-
sults, a large study conducted in Swedish young men at 
military service reported a positive association between 
CRF and AF.2 The contradictory results in the field might

be explained by several methodological factors, such as 
the confounders included, as well as different age dis-
tributions and sex. The majority of studies, including the 
study by Andersen and colleagues,2 have been conduct-
ed only in men. Indeed, it has been suggested that the 
exercise-associated AF mostly affects male endurance 
athletes, and the etiology might be different from that 
of general AF,18 presumably examined in the present 
study. In the present study, we were able to adjust for 
a large set of potential confounders, and this strength-
ened the inverse association between CRF and AF.
Clinical Implications
Little is known about the risk-modifying effects of ex-
ercise among individuals with increased genetic risk for 
cardiovascular diseases. Our results showing inverse 
associations of grip strength and CRF with CVD out-
comes across different categories of cardiovascular 
genetic risk are in line with a recent study19 reporting 
similar associations of healthy lifestyle (defined by 4 
lifestyle factors: smoking, obesity, physical activity, and 
diet) in each of the genetic risk score strata for CHD. 
Although the direct comparison is not feasible because 
of differences in variable definitions, together these 
studies highlight the importance of lifestyle factors in 
the prevention of CVD, as well as in genetically predis-
posed individuals, demonstrating the nondeterministic 
nature of genetic risk. They also stress the potential 
advantages of genetic risk profiling for better detec-
tion of individuals at increased risk for CVD. Although 
more information is needed to evaluate how people 
understand the genetic risks, the knowledge that life-
style choices have substantial effects on the disease 
risks could encourage individuals to initiate a healthier 
lifestyle to reduce their overall risk.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study include a large study sample 
with objective and subjective measures of fitness and 
physical activity and a prospective ascertainment of dif-
ferent types of CVD events. Our study also has limita-
tions. First, the tradeoff for the large sample collection 
is weaker measurement accuracy. For example, grip 
strength is a simple proxy for general muscular strength 
level, and it captures mainly upper body strength, espe-
cially when measured in a sitting position. However, it is 
highly correlated with knee extension muscle strength 
(r=0.77–0.81),20 which makes it a decent indicator of 
general strength level in large samples, where more 
detailed assessments of muscular strength are not fea-
sible. Moreover, CRF was measured with a submaximal 
fitness test, which is less accurate but more applicable 
and safer in large samples than a laborious maximal 
fitness test. Furthermore, some unmeasured or inad-
equately measured confounders could have had an ef-
fect on the results obtained in our analyses.
Second, as in any population-based cohort study, the 
disease prevalence and incidence rates derived in the UK 
Biobank are not broadly generalizable because of healthy 
volunteer bias among study participants. That is, when 
compared with the general population, the UK Biobank 
participants had fewer self-reported illnesses and were 
less likely to be obese, smoke, and drink alcohol.21 How-
ever, valid assessment of associations between exposures 
and outcomes does not require participants to be repre-
sentative of the population at large. Thus, associations 
among fitness, physical activity, and disease events are 
still likely be generalizable to other populations.21
 Last, although our analyses were conducted in a co-
hort with different ethnicities, the majority of participants 
were of European ancestry. Hence, the generalizability of 
the results to other ethnicities is not fully understood.
Conclusions
In conclusion, different measures of fitness and physical 
activity demonstrated inverse associations with future 
CVD events and all-cause death in a large population-
based sample. Among those at high, intermediate, or 
low genetic predisposition for CHD and AF, there was 
a graded inverse association with these parameters 
among each strata of genetic risk. Future studies eval-
uating the effects of strength versus aerobic training 
on subclinical or clinical cardiovascular outcomes could 
help to tailor exercise programs for individuals with el-
evated genetic risk for these diseases.
