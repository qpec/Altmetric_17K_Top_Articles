The emergence and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are an increasing cause of death worldwide,
resulting in a global ‘call to action’ to avoid receding into an era lacking effective antibiotics. Despite the urgency,
the healthcare industry still relies on a single in vitro bioassay to determine antibiotic efficacy. This assay fails to
incorporate environmental factors normally present during host-pathogen interactions in vivo that significantly
impact antibiotic efficacy. Here we report that standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) failed to detect
antibiotics that are in fact effective in vivo; and frequently identified antibiotics that were instead ineffective as
further confirmed in mouse models of infection and sepsis. Notably, AST performed in media mimicking host en-
vironments succeeded in identifying specific antibiotics that were effective in bacterial clearance and host surviv-
al, even though these same antibiotics failed in results using standard test media. Similarly, our revised media
further identified antibiotics that were ineffective in vivo despite passing the AST standard for clinical use. Sup-
plementation of AST medium with sodium bicarbonate, an abundant in vivo molecule that stimulates global
changes in bacterial structure and gene expression, was found to be an important factor improving the predictive
value of AST in the assignment of appropriate therapy. These findings have the potential to improve the means by
which antibiotics are developed, tested, and prescribed.

1. Introduction
Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a leading cause of death worldwide
and undermine advances in medical and surgical management of
multiple diseases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013;
World Health Organization, 2014). Despite this urgent threat (World
Health Assembly, 2014; U.S. White House, 2015), the healthcare indus-
try continues to rely on a single bioassay standardized in 1961 by the
World Health Organization to determine antibiotic efficacy (World
Health Organization, 1961). Although this bioassay has been immensely
valuable for several decades, it is fundamentally flawed because it is
based largely on in vitro efficacy, and often fails to correlate with patient
outcome (Kubicek-Sutherland et al., 2015). Reliance on this bioassay
may have inadvertently contributed to the rise in multidrug-resistant
bacteria because it disqualifies efficacious compounds (Diene and
Rolain, 2014).
A key parameter that guides decisions regarding antimicrobial
therapy is the clinical breakpoint: the antimicrobial concentrations that
are used to define isolates as susceptible (“S”), intermediate (“I”), or re-
sistant (“R”) (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2012a;
European Committee on Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing, 2014). Clinical
breakpoints are established by a sequential procedure. (1) In vitro effica-
cy is assessed by standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST),
which determines the minimum inhibitory concentration (“MIC”) of an-
tibiotics to which a pathogen is sensitive. (2) Pharmacokinetic/pharma-
codynamic (PK/PD) parameters are measured in animals (dosing,
distribution, localization). (3) Efficacy/toxicity is established in animals
for a limited number of model pathogens. (4) Dosing protocols are vali-
dated with limited patient clinical data. Unfortunately, this testing pipe-
line is fundamentally unsound because the first step, AST, is performed
on Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB), a rich laboratory medium that fails to
recapitulate most aspects of host environments. So, the fact that clinical
breakpoints are based on a foundational assay performed in vitro raises
questions as to how relevant they are to patient outcome.
Supporting this notion, several reports suggest that the clinical pre-
dictive value of AST in the assignment of appropriate therapy is limited.
(1) Clinical observations have given rise to the “90–60” rule:

 “susceptible” infections respond well to appropriate therapy in 90% of
cases, whereas “resistant” infections respond well to these antibiotics
in 60% of cases (Doern and Brecher, 2011; Rex and Pfaller, 2002). (2)
Pneumococcal patients treated with antibiotics that failed standard
tests (discordant therapy) had similar treatment outcomes as those
that passed standard tests (concordant therapy) (Victor et al., 2003).
(3) AST-recommended antibiotics failed to clear Salmonella enterica
Typhimurium and Enterobacter cloacae in murine models of sepsis
(Kubicek-Sutherland et al., 2015; Band et al., 2016). (4) An AST-
disqualified antibiotic cleared multidrug-resistant Gram-negative path-
ogens in murine pulmonary models of infection (Lin et al., 2015). Here
we propose that the antimicrobial testing assay should be revamped
to account for pathogen conditions in the host, and show several cir-
cumstances in which susceptibility testing in host-mimicking media is
more accurate than standard AST in predicting antibiotic efficacy in
vivo. We have termed this behavior in vivo altered susceptibility
(IVAS), providing insight into why some patients fail to respond to cer-
tain antibiotics despite passing standard tests for clinical use.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Bacterial Strains and Media
Staphylococcal clinical isolates analyzed included USA300, a commu-
nity-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) isolate
causing the most MRSA infections in the United States (Diekema et al.,
2014); and 9 isolates from human sepsis patients (Santa Barbara
Cottage Hospital, 2016) with various host sites of pathogen origin
including blood, wound, urine, sputum (termed MRSA Blood
[MT3302]; Wound [MT3315]); MSSA (Blood [MT3305]; Wound
[MT3307]; Urine [MT3309]; Sputum [MT3314]); and CoNS (S.
epidermidis, blood [MT3320]; S. lugdunensis, blood [MT3317]; S. warneri,
blood [MT3321]). S. pneumoniae (SPN) clinical isolates included D39
(ser. 2) (Lanie et al., 2007), and 5 SPN isolates derived from the naso-
pharynx of children with sickle cell anemia at risk for invasive pneumo-
coccal disease (Daw 1 [serotype 6]; Daw 2 [serotype 23]; Daw 19
[serotype 6]; Daw 20 [serotype 11]; Daw 25 [serotype 35C]) (Daw et
al., 1997; Carter et al., 2014). Gram-negative bacterial isolates included
Salmonella spp., Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, TY1212; and
var. 5 (04)-9639; S. Dublin Lane; S. Newport (03)-721; S. Choleraesuis
χ3236 (Heithoff et al., 2012; Heithoff et al., 2008); E. coli ATCC 25922;
UPEC J96; UPEC ECR12; UPEC ATCC 11775; APEC χ7126; A96 χ7117;
EPEC χ2927); RDEC-1 χ2862; EPEC JPN 15; Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
(YPIII/pIB1; IP32953; IP2515; IP2666) (Kubicek-Sutherland et al.,
2014); Shigella flexneri ATCC 29903; Providencia stuartii ATCC 29914;
Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090; Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883;
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145. All Staphylococcus strains were
isolated on Tryptic Soy Broth Agar (TSA) incubated at 37 °C in ambient
air. S. pneumoniae strains were isolated on Columbia Sheep's Blood
Agar (CSBA) and grown in Todd-Hewitt Broth (THB) supplemented
with 2% yeast extract incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Gram
negative bacteria were isolated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (Davis et al.,
1980) incubated at 37 °C or 28 °C (Yersinia) in ambient air. Standard
AST broth medium is Mueller–Hinton Broth (MHB) supplemented
with CaCl2 and MgCl2 to make cation-adjusted MHB (Ca-MHB)
(Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2012a). AST was also
performed in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM (Dulbecco
and Freeman, 1959); High Glucose [Life Technologies]); Lacks medium
(Lacks, 1966); modified Lacks medium (MLM) (Hathaway et al.,
2012); or low phosphate, low magnesium medium (LPM) (Coombes
et al., 2004). DMEM cultures were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator; all
other conditions were incubated in ambient air. To facilitate growth,
DMEM was supplemented with 5% LB broth for Staphylococci, and 5%
Lysed Horse Blood (LHB) for S. pneumoniae; MLM was supplemented
with 5% THB for S. pneumoniae D39.
2.2. MIC Assays
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines by either broth or agar dilution (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute, 2012a; Wiegand et al., 2008). For determination of
MIC in alternative media conditions, bacteria were obtained from over-
night culture (Staphylococci and Gram-negative bacteria) or after a 4 h
incubation period (S. pneumoniae) in specified medium and diluted
into same medium containing 2-fold serial dilutions of antibiotics. To
control for the potential effects of pH and media composition for LPM
pH 5.5 comparisons, antibiotic resistance and clinical breakpoint desig-
nations were calculated by comparing the MIC in LPM medium divided
by the MIC in MHB medium at both pH 5.5 and pH 7 (unbuffered) (ratio
of LPM pH 5.5/pH 7.0 to MHB pH 5.5/pH 7.2) (Kubicek-Sutherland et al.,
2015). MIC values were derived after 20 h incubation, and were the re-
sult of at least 6 independent determinations.
2.3. Sodium Bicarbonate Susceptibility Assays
Strains were grown in MHB pH 7.2; unbuffered; MHB adjusted to
pH 7.2 with 100 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Fisher Scien-
tific); and DMEM liquid pH 7.4 (containing 44 mM NaHCO3; Difco/
Becton Dickinson). All other media conditions were adjusted to pH 7.4
with 100 mM Tris including: MHB medium w/NaHCO3; and NaHCO3-
free powdered DMEM w/wo NaHCO3. Bacteria were grown overnight
in specified medium and diluted as described above. For S. pneumoniae
isolates, NaHCO3 assays were performed in MHB medium in the CO2 in-
cubator due to viability considerations since S. pneumoniae isolates test-
ed did not grow in either MHB medium with NaHCO3 in ambient air; or
in DMEM in the absence of NaHCO3 in the CO2 incubator. MIC values
were the result of at least 6 independent determinations.
2.4. Virulence Assays
2.4.1. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) Infection
S. Typhimurium 14028 (dose of 102 CFU) and S. pneumoniae Daw 25
(dose of 9 × 107 CFU) were grown overnight in LB or Todd-Hewitt me-
dium with 2% yeast extract, respectively, and sub-cultured to A600 = 0.4,
resuspended in 0.15 M NaCl, and administered to mice via the i.p. route
of infection
2.4.2. Intravenous (i.v.) Infection
MRSA USA300 (dose 1 × 108 CFU), MRSA Blood (MT3302; dose 1.5 ×
108 CFU) and MSSA Wound (MT3307; dose of 2 × 108 CFU) were grown
overnight in TSB and sub-cultured to A600 = 0.4; and K. pneumoniae
ATCC 13883 (dose of 2 × 108 CFU) were grown overnight in LB medium.
Strains were resuspended in 0.15 M NaCl and administered i.v. to mice
by retro-orbital injection.
2.4.3. Antibiotic Treatment
Infected mice were treated (or mock-treated) with the following
dosing regimens beginning 2 h post-infection: azithromycin
(100 mg/kg/day), ceftiofur (40 mg/kg/day), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day),
cephalothin (200 mg/kg/day), ciprofloxacin (30 mg/kg/day), colistin
(30 mg/kg/day), co-trimoxazole (15 mg/kg/day), daptomycin
(10 mg/kg/day), erythromycin (100 mg/kg/day), tetracycline
(100 mg/kg/day), or trimethoprim (30 mg/kg/day).
2.4.4. Bacterial Clearance
Mice infected with MSSA Wound (MT3307; dose of 4 × 108 CFU)
were treated with azithromycin or co-trimoxazole. All drug doses
were delivered once every 24 h except cephalothin, ciprofloxacin,
colistin, and co-trimoxazole, which were delivered once every 12 h; cef-
triaxone and ceftiofur were given every 12 h for MRSA Blood (MT3302)
experiments. All drugs were delivered by the i.p. route with the
174
S.C. Ersoy et al. / EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 173–181
 exception of cephalothin (subcutaneous). Mouse survival was assessed
for 10 days post-infection. Equal numbers of male and female 10- to 12-
week-old litter-mate C57BL/6J mice were used in all virulence studies.
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
California, Santa Barbara approved all mouse research protocols under-
taken herein.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance for difference in proportions of animal surviv-
al was calculated using Chi-square (Epi Info 7, CDC). For all statistical
analyses, a significance level (P) of b0.05 was considered to be statisti-
cally significant. Degrees of statistical significance are presented as
***P b 0.001, **P b 0.01, or *P b 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Antibiotic MICs Are Markedly Different When Derived From Host-
mimicking Media vs. Standard MHB Medium
A collection of human and veterinary clinical isolates was subjected
to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in host-mimicking media vs.
standard MHB medium. Four host-mimicking media were examined in-
cluding (i) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), a tissue culture
medium supporting mammalian cell growth (Dulbecco and Freeman,
1959); (ii) Lacks medium, supporting pneumococcal growth (Lacks,
1966; Trombe et al., 1992); (iii) modified Lacks medium (MLM),
simulating the nasopharynx for invasive pneumococcal carriage
(Hathaway et al., 2012); and (iv) low-phosphate, low-magnesium me-
dium (LPM pH 5.5), simulating the macrophage phagosome in which
many intracellular pathogens reside/replicate (Coombes et al., 2004;
Steele-Mortimer, 2008). Emphasis was placed on the identification of
pathogen-antibiotic combinations that exhibited altered MICs from
host-mimicking media relative to standard MHB medium; and whose
MICs crossed clinical breakpoint designations that are used to define
isolates as susceptible (“S”), intermediate (“I”), or resistant (“R”), and
can impact clinical decision making on appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Thus, we sought to identify antibiotics for which a given pathogen is
classified as “S” in MHB medium but “R” in host-mimicking media (S
to R); and antibiotics for which a given pathogen is classified as “R” in
MHB medium but “S” in host-mimicking media (R to S).
3.1.1. Staphylococcus (MRSA; MSSA; CoNS)
A panel of antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine was
tested for efficacy against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant and
-sensitive S. aureus (MRSA/MSSA), and coagulase negative Staphylococ-
cus (CoNS) (Fig. 1). Growth of Staphylococcus in tissue culture medium
and modified Lacks medium conferred increased susceptibility to
azithromycin, erythromycin, and streptomycin relative to MHB medium
(4 to 256-fold; Fig. 1a). Conversely, Staphylococcus exhibited increased
resistance to daptomycin and rifampin in modified Lacks medium, and
to tetracycline in tissue culture medium, relative to MHB medium (4
to 16-fold). Table 1 lists pathogen-antibiotic combinations that exhibit-
ed at least an 8-fold change in MIC when derived in host-mimicking
media vs. standard MHB medium and whose altered MICs crossed clin-
ical breakpoint designations that advise on patient therapy. For exam-
ple, antibiotics for which MRSA was classified as “R” in MHB medium,
but classified as “S” in tissue culture medium (cephalothin); and antibi-
otics for which MSSA was classified as “I” in MHB medium, but classified
as “S” in tissue culture medium (erythromycin) (Supplementary Table
1a). Notably, although many pathogen-antibiotic combinations have
significant changes in MIC in host-mimicking media, many do not
cross breakpoint designations (R to S; S to R) and would not alter phy-
sician making on appropriate therapy. For example, 3/3 MRSA isolates
exhibited a 4- to 32-fold increased susceptibility to oxacillin in tissue
culture medium, but the “altered MICs” of two MRSA isolates did not
cross clinical breakpoints. Thus, they remain “Resistant” to oxacillin as
defined by AST standards for clinical use.
3.1.2. S. pneumoniae
Altered MICs were also examined for S. pneumoniae clinical isolates
tested in host-mimicking media vs. standard MHB medium. Most
S. pneumoniae strains tested showed increased susceptibility to
azithromycin in tissue culture medium and modified Lacks medium rel-
ative to MHB medium; and increased resistance to daptomycin and tri-
methoprim in modified Lacks medium (4 to 32-fold; Fig. 1b). Many S.
pneumoniae MICs derived in host-mimicking media crossed clinical
breakpoint designations (listed in Table 1); e.g., antibiotics for which
S. pneumoniae was classified as “S” in MHB medium, but classified as
“R” in modified Lacks medium (trimethoprim); and those for which S.
pneumoniae classified was “R” in MHB medium, but classified as “S” in
modified Lacks medium (azithromycin) (Supplementary Table 1b).
3.1.3. Gram-negative Bacteria
Antibiotic efficacy was also examined for Gram-negative bacterial
isolates tested in host-mimicking media vs. standard MHB medium. A
subset of these antibiotics (10 of 20), which were not subject to acute
pH and/or media composition effects under LPM pH 5.5 conditions
(Kubicek-Sutherland et al., 2015), were also interrogated. Several
Gram-negative bacteria were associated with increased resistance to
colistin or polymyxin B in tissue culture medium and LPM pH 5.5 condi-
tions relative to MHB medium (4 to 512-fold) (Fig. 1c). Growth of
Yersinia spp. (4 of 4 isolates) was associated with increased susceptibil-
ity to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole in tissue culture medium rela-
tive to MHB medium (8 to 64-fold). Many Gram-negative bacteria
MICs derived in host-mimicking media crossed clinical breakpoint des-
ignations (listed in Table 1); e.g., Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) suscep-
tibility to colistin was classified as “S” in MHB medium but “R” in tissue
culture medium (Supplementary Table 1c–f).
3.1.4. Comparison Summary of MICs Derived From Host-mimicking Media
vs. Standard MHB Medium
We evaluated the percentage of pathogen-antibiotic combinations
that resulted in altered MICs when derived from host-mimicking
media vs. standard MHB medium (Fig. 2a). Although the MICs obtained
from host-mimicking media were comparable to those from MHB medi-
um for approximately two-thirds of cases tested (852/1311), one third
of these cases exhibited at least a 4-fold change in MIC, which may sig-
nal altered antibiotic susceptibility in vivo. Further, 8.2% (107/1311) of
altered MICs derived from the host-mimicking media tested resulted
in a change in clinical breakpoint designation, which may impact physi-
cian decision making (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these data suggest that
inclusion of environmental factors normally present during host-patho-
gen interactions may improve the predictive value of standard AST in
identifying effective antibiotics to treat microbial infections.
3.2. Drug Testing in Host-mimicking Media Improves the Assignment of
Appropriate Antibiotic Therapy
Several pathogen-antibiotic combinations that exhibited altered
MICs in host-mimicking media were tested for efficacy in murine
models of sepsis. We focused on antibiotics whose MICs exhibited at
least an 8-fold altered susceptibility in host-mimicking media relative
to standard MHB medium, and whose MICs crossed clinical breakpoint
designations. This analysis was limited to human and veterinary clinical
isolates that also infect mice.
3.2.1. MRSA, MSSA
All mice (10/10) survived infection with MRSA (USA300) following
treatment with cephalothin or ceftriaxone (Fig. 3a; P b 0.001), identified
as efficacious in tissue culture medium even though these agents failed
standard testing in MHB medium (R to S; R to I; Supplementary Table
175
S.C. Ersoy et al. / EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 173–181
 1a). Similarly, nearly all mice (8/10) survived MSSA (MT3307) infection
following treatment with erythromycin (P b 0.001), identified as bioac-
tive in tissue culture medium but relatively ineffective by standard test-
ing (I to S). Treatment with co-trimoxazole, often used clinically
(Holland et al., 2014), failed to improve survivorship (1/10; P = 1.0),
as predicted by testing in tissue culture medium but not MHB medium
(S to R).
Further analysis was done using a MRSA isolate (MT3302) linked to
a fatal case of human sepsis. AST in host-mimicking media was evaluat-
ed in an effort to retroactively identify alternative therapeutic options.
Treatment with cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or ceftiofur) resulted in
high efficacy in murine models of MRSA sepsis (8/10; 7/10; P b 0.001;
P b 0.01). Both of these antibiotics were identified as efficacious in tissue
culture medium even though they were rejected by standard testing (R
to I). Further, all mice (10/10) survived treatment with daptomycin and
ciprofloxacin (Fig. 3a; P b 0.001), as predicted by testing of daptomycin
in standard MHB medium and tissue culture medium; and of ciproflox-
acin in all media examined (Supplementary Table 1a). Notably, testing
of daptomycin in modified Lacks medium predicted resistance (S to
R), indicating that this drug may be effective against certain types of in-
fections but not others (e.g., systemic vs. localized).
3.2.2. S. pneumoniae
Despite passing standard testing in MHB medium, trimethoprim
failed to protect mice (0/10) from SPN infection (strain Daw 25)
(Fig. 3b; P = 1.0), as predicted by testing in modified Lacks medium
Fig. 1. Comparison of pathogen-antibiotic combinations that exhibited altered MICs derived from host-mimicking media relative to standard MHB medium. A panel of antibiotics was
screened for altered MICs against (a) Staphylococcus spp., (b) S. pneumoniae, and (c) Gram-negative bacteria when tested in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), Lacks
medium, modified Lacks medium (MLM), low-phosphate, low-magnesium medium (LPM pH 5.5) relative to standard MHB medium, according to CLSI guidelines (Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute, 2012a; Wiegand et al., 2008). Values depict the fold-change in MICs when derived in host-mimicking media relative to standard MHB medium (test/
standard condition). Increased susceptibility depicted in blue; increased resistance depicted in red. MIC values were obtained from at least 6 independent determinations.
176
S.C. Ersoy et al. / EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 173–181
 (S to R; Supplementary Table 1b). Further, all mice (10/10) survived fol-
lowing treatment with ceftriaxone (P b 0.001), for which susceptibility
was indicated in all media tested.
3.2.3. Gram-negative Bacteria
Colistin, a drug of last resort (Yahav et al., 2012), failed to protect
mice (1/10) from infection with S. Typhimurium (ST14028) (Fig. 3c;
P = 1.0), as predicted by testing in tissue culture medium (S to R; Sup-
plementary Table 1c). Conversely, all mice (10/10) survived treatment
with ciprofloxacin (P b 0.001), for which susceptibility was indicated
in all media tested. Additionally, most mice (8/10) survived infection
with K. pneumoniae following treatment with tetracycline (P b 0.001).
Such efficacy was predicted by standard testing in MHB and LPM
pH 5.5 media (S to S), which mimics the macrophage phagosome
wherein K. pneumoniae resides and replicates during infection (Cano
et al., 2015) (Supplementary Table 1f). Such efficacy was comparable
to treatment with ciprofloxacin (8/10; P b 0.001) that has established
activity against intracellular pathogens (Carryn et al., 2003). Notably,
testing of tetracycline in tissue culture medium predicted resistance
(S to R), suggesting that testing in media that reflect the intracellular
lifestyle of K. pneumoniae is a more accurate predictor of treatment out-
come for this pathogen.
3.2.4. Bacterial Clearance
Bacterial clearance from circulation in the blood was investigated
following treatment with antibiotics predicted as highly efficacious by
testing in standard MHB medium (co-trimoxazole) or tissue culture
medium (azithromycin), respectively (Supplementary Table 1a). Treat-
ment with the AST-recommended antibiotic, co-trimoxazole, was
ineffective in MSSA (MT3307) clearance as predicted by testing in
host-mimicking media (S to R) (Fig. 3d). This treated cohort exhibited a
progressive bacteremia (up to 2.5 × 105 colony forming units (CFU)/ml
blood by day 6), with all mice (10/10) succumbing to infection by day
10 (open boxes). Such efficacy was comparable to that of untreated an-
imals (open circles). Conversely, as predicted by testing in tissue culture
medium, azithromycin was able to clear MSSA from circulation, with all
mice (10/10) surviving the infection and harboring ≤ 2 × 103 CFU/ml in
the blood at day 10 (closed boxes; P b 0.001). These data suggest that
Table 1
AST in host-mimicking media identifies MICs that cross clinical breakpoint designations which advise on patient therapy.

 drug testing in host-mimicking media improves the predictive value of
standard AST in the assignment of appropriate therapy.
3.3. Addition of NaHCO3 to Standard MHB Medium Improves the Accuracy
of Antibiotic Efficacy In Vivo
We suspected that sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) may be a key in
vivo molecule contributing to antibiotic susceptibility for a number of
pathogens for the following reasons. NaHCO3 serves as an abundant
ionic factor present in mammalian tissues that stimulates global chang-
es in bacterial structure, gene expression, and membrane permeability
that correspond to increased susceptibility to human cationic antimi-
crobial peptides (Dorschner et al., 2006). NaHCO3 is present in nearly
all host-mimicking media examined that resulted in altered antibiotic
susceptibility relative to MHB medium. Thus, we evaluated whether
supplementation of standard MHB medium with physiological levels
of NaHCO3 improved the predictive value of the AST standard for clinical
use. This analysis was initially focused on Staphylococcus-antibiotic
combinations that exhibited at least an 8-fold change in MIC in tissue
culture medium vs. MHB medium, representing 13.5% (31/230) of com-
binations examined (Fig. 1a, top panel).
We investigated the fold-change between MICs derived in MHB me-
dium in the presence/absence of NaHCO3 (test/standard condition; left
of slash); and in tissue culture medium in the absence/presence of
NaHCO3 (test/standard condition; right of slash) (Fig. 4a; Supplementary
Table 2a). Increased susceptibility is depicted in blue; increased resis-
tance is depicted in red. Four phenotypic classes were identified.
Class 1 (21/31). Addition of NaHCO3 to MHB medium resulted in MICs
similar to tissue culture medium; its removal from tissue culture
medium resulted in MICs similar to MHB medium (azithromycin,
erythromycin, tetracycline).
Class 2 (5/31). Addition of NaHCO3 to MHB medium resulted in MICs
similar to tissue culture medium; its removal from tissue culture
medium had no effect on the MIC (ceftriaxone, ceftiofur).
Class 3 (2/31). Addition of NaHCO3 addition to MHB medium had no
MIC effect; its removal from tissue culture medium resulted in MICs
similar to MHB medium (oxacillin).
Class 4 (3/31). Addition/removal of NaHCO3 had no effect on MICs in
MHB medium or tissue culture medium (trimethoprim). These data
indicate that addition of NaHCO3 to MHB medium restored the
altered susceptibility observed in tissue culture medium in 83.9%
(26 of 31) of cases tested.
Next, we examined whether physiological levels of NaHCO3 in MHB
medium were required to stimulate the altered susceptibility observed
in tissue culture medium. A dose response analysis of MRSA (USA300;
MT3302) and MSSA (MT3307) strains revealed that physiological levels
of NaHCO3 (~25 mM) (Mayo Clinic, 2017) were necessary to induce al-
tered antibiotic susceptibility in MHB medium (Fig. 4b). These data

Pathogen-antibiotic combinations that exhibited altered MICs in host-mimicking media relative to standard MHB medium and whose MICs crossed clinical breakpoint designations
were evaluated in murine sepsis models of (a) S. aureus (MRSA [USA300]; MSSA Wound [MT3307]; MRSA Blood [MT3302]); (b) S. pneumoniae (SPN Daw25); and (c) S. Typhimurium
(ST 14028) and K. pneumoniae (KPN ATCC13883). (d) MSSA (MT3307) clearance from blood circulation was examined following treatment with antibiotics predicted as highly
effective via testing in standard MHB medium (co-trimoxazole, open boxes) or tissue culture medium (DMEM) (azithromycin, closed boxes), respectively. Untreated mice (open
circles); expired mice (gray region); Colony Forming Units (CFU); Limit of Detection (LOD) = 100 CFU/ml (Patterson et al., 2013). Ten mice were evaluated per cohort. ***P b 0.001,
**P b 0.01, or *P b 0.05.

S.C. Ersoy et al. / EBioMedicine 20 (2017) 173–181
 suggest that NaHCO3 may be a key in vivo component contributing to
antibiotic susceptibility for a number of pathogens. Supporting this sug-
gestion, supplementation of MHB medium with physiological levels of
NaHCO3 also resulted in altered drug susceptibilities in S. pneumoniae
and Salmonella spp. isolates (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Table 2b, c). Fur-
ther, many altered MICs crossed clinical breakpoint designations (listed
in Table 1), and such predicted changes in antibiotic efficacy were con-
firmed in mouse models of infection and sepsis (Fig. 2a); e.g., MRSA
(cephalothin [R to S]; ceftriaxone [R to I]); and MSSA (erythromycin [I
to S]); (Supplementary Table 2a). These findings suggest that supple-
mentation of standard MHB medium with physiological levels of
NaHCO3 improved the predictive value of AST in the assignment of ap-
propriate antibiotics for therapeutic intervention.
4. Discussion
Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a significant cause of sepsis, the
most common cause of death in hospitalized patients, with an annual
incidence of 1 million cases and 200,000 deaths in the U.S. alone
(Deutschman and Tracey, 2014). This dire perspective reflects the failed
efforts to fully contain bacteria with the misuse of antibiotics, and the
legal, financial, and scientific hurdles to discovering new ones. We dem-
onstrate that one viable approach to address this alarming threat is to
incorporate host-mimicking media in standard AST methods for clinical
use. Validation of the improved predictive value of AST in the assign-
ment of appropriate antibiotic therapy was provided in several Gram-
positive and -negative animal models of infection and sepsis. Our
findings suggest that standard AST may be hindering optimal patient
treatment, and slowing the process of discovery of new, effective, and
safe antibiotics because it disqualifies efficacious compounds. Suscepti-
bility testing that accounts for the biology of a pathogen in the context of
its host may enable the re-purposing of omitted antibiotics while aiding
the discovery of new ones by screening compounds under conditions
that more accurately reflect the host milieu.
Altered drug susceptibility in vivo provides insight as to why some
patients fail to respond to certain antibiotics despite passing standard
susceptibility tests. Our findings with a MRSA isolate from a deceased
patient provide a clear example as antibiotics omitted by standard AST
Fig. 4. Supplementation of standard MHB medium with physiological levels of NaHCO3 improves the predictive value of AST in the assignment of appropriate antibiotics for therapeutic
intervention. (a) S. aureus exhibiting at least an 8-fold change in MIC in tissue culture medium (DMEM) vs. MHB medium were subjected to susceptibility tests in the presence and absence
of physiological levels of NaHCO3. Values represent MIC fold-change when derived in MHB medium in the presence/absence of NaHCO3 (test/standard condition; left of slash); and in
DMEM medium in the absence/presence of NaHCO3 (test/standard condition; right of slash). Increased susceptibility is depicted in blue; increased resistance is depicted in red.
Stippled boxes represent those that exhibited b8-fold altered susceptibility between MHB and DMEM media. To control for pH and buffer considerations, strains were grown in MHB
pH 7.2; MHB adjusted to pH 7.2 w/100 mM Tris; and DMEM liquid pH 7.4 (containing 44 mM NaHCO3); all other media conditions were adjusted to pH 7.4 with 100 mM Tris
including: MHB w/NaHCO3; and NaHCO3-free powdered DMEM w/wo NaHCO3 (Supplementary Table 2a). (b) Dose response analysis of MRSA (USA300; MT3302) and MSSA
(MT3307) antibiotic susceptibility following exposure to increasing concentrations of NaHCO3 in standard MHB medium. AZM (azithromycin); ERY (erythromycin); CFX (ceftriaxone).
(c) Susceptibility of S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp. in the presence/absence of physiological levels of NaHCO3 in MHB and/or DMEM media. For S. pneumoniae, values represent
fold-change between MICs derived in MHB medium in the presence/absence of NaHCO3 (test/standard condition). For Salmonella spp. values represent fold-change between MICs
derived in MHB medium in the presence/absence of NaHCO3 (test/standard condition; left of slash); and DMEM in the absence/presence of NaHCO3 (test/standard condition; right of
slash). No change (NC), Resistant (R). MICs were a consensus of at least 6 independent isolates.

 were highly efficacious in bacterial clearance. If these alternative thera-
peutic options had been made available to clinicians managing this case,
it may have changed the patient outcome. Additionally, we show that
supplementation of standard MHB medium with physiological levels
of sodium bicarbonate improved the predictive value of AST in the as-
signment of appropriate therapy. The molecular basis likely involves
the role of NaHCO3 as an abundant ionic factor that stimulates global
changes in bacterial structure and gene expression, leading to alter-
ations in bacterial cell wall thickness and membrane permeability that
correspond with increased susceptibility to human cationic antimicro-
bial peptides (Dorschner et al., 2006). Two potential alternative mecha-
nisms include the role of bicarbonate in the maintenance of blood pH
(Hermansen and Osnes, 1972; Rosenthal, 1948); and/or the inhibition
of growth and viability of periodontal pathogens (Newbrun et al.,
1984). However, these mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in the im-
proved predictive value of AST due to the inclusion of Tris buffer in the
test media to preclude bicarbonate-mediated pH fluctuations that can
affect antibiotic potency and bacterial cell viability.
Standard AST in clinical use has likely contributed to the alarming
rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitals because high doses of
ineffective antibiotics are given to infected patients without the knowl-
edge that the host environment may render bacteria inherently resis-
tant to the antibiotics prescribed to kill them. Based on the findings of
this study, rather than extending the dose/duration of an antibiotic
that is not effective, physicians might consider that the more appropri-
ate approach is to prescribe a totally different antibiotic. Standard AST in
combination with host-mimicking media may serve as a valuable tool in
advising clinicians on appropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics identi-
fied by both approaches were efficacious in every animal model exam-
ined; thus, such cases should bestow high confidence in clinical decision
making on appropriate therapy. Conversely, physicians should exercise
caution in cases where marked MIC disparities occur between testing in
host-mimicking media vs. standard MHB medium. Further, predicted
drug failure in a particular host-mimicking media may indicate that cer-
tain drugs may be effective against certain types of infections but not
others (e.g., systemic vs. localized). Supporting this suggestion, MRSA
inactivates daptomycin by releasing membrane phospholipids under
certain experimental conditions (Pader et al., 2016); and herein we
show that a MRSA isolate was susceptible to daptomycin in tissue cul-
ture medium and in a murine model of sepsis, but displayed resistance
in other host-mimicking media examined (minimal Lacks medium).
Future considerations must be given to host-pathogen interactions
that can also influence drug susceptibility. (1) Animals, including pri-
mates, often tolerate drugs differently than humans (pharmacokinetic
parameters such as drug clearance, volume of distribution, and half-
life can result in unanticipated changes in antimicrobial efficacy)
(Ambrose et al., 2007; Deziel et al., 2005). (2) Bacterial community com-
position can compromise antibiotic efficacy (antibiotic deactivation or
biofilm production provides passive resistance for all microbes within
a polymicrobial environment) (Vega and Gore, 2014; Sorg et al.,
2016). (3) Antimicrobial selection is based on drug concentrations
achieved in plasma, but concentrations achieved in different tissues
and sites of infection may be greater or less depending on the drug's
properties (pH at the infection site or within an organelle can dictate
lipid solubility of the drug or its distribution in cells and tissues)
(Logan et al., 2012). (4) Antibiotic resistance may be inadvertently trig-
gered by diet, underlying conditions in the patient, or by clinical inter-
ventions that may disrupt drug efficacy (ascorbic acid treatment of
urinary tract infections to lower urine pH) (Carlsson et al., 2001). (5)
Many patients that develop multidrug-resistant infections have co-
morbidities, immunosuppressive therapy and/or the presence of inva-
sive medical devices that impact susceptibility to indicated pathogens
(Paterson and Bonomo, 2005).
Our findings suggest that the susceptibility testing in media that re-
flect the host milieu will not only improve the predictive value of AST in
the assignment of appropriate antibiotic therapy, but also provides a
new paradigm for drug discovery and therapeutic intervention for in-
fectious diseases. However, such testing will always be open to further
improvement, especially as we learn more about the subtle nuances of
host-pathogen interactions in natural environments that influence the
impact of antibiotics on bacterial clearance (e.g., virulence factors, eco-
logical factors, and cell physiological parameters).
