ABSTRACT 
Background: Social engagement and social isolation are key determinants of mental health in older 
age, yet there is limited evidence on how public policies may contribute to reducing isolation, 
promoting social engagement, and improving mental health among older people. This study examines 
the impact of the introduction of an age friendly transportation policy, free bus passes, on the mental 
health of older people in England.  
Methods: We use an instrumental variable approach that exploits eligibility criteria for free bus 
passes to estimate the impact of increased public transportation use on depressive symptoms, 
loneliness, social isolation, and social engagement. 
Results: Eligibility for the free bus travel pass was associated with an 8% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 6.4% to 9.6%) increase in the use of public transportation among older people. The IV model 
suggests that using public transport reduces depressive symptoms by 0.952 points (95% CI: -1.712 to 
-0.192) on the CES-D scale. IV models also suggest that using public transport reduces feelings of 
loneliness (β: -0.794, 95% CI: -1.528 to -0.061), increases volunteering at least monthly (β: 0.237, 
95% CI: 0.059 to 0.414), and increases having regular contact with children (β: 0.480, 95% CI: 0.208 
to 0.752) and friends (β: 0.311, 95% CI: 0.109 to 0.513). 
Conclusion: Free bus travel is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and feelings of 
loneliness among older people. Transportation policies may increase older people’s social 
engagement and consequently deliver significant benefits to mental health.

INTRODUCTION  
Depressive disorders as the second leading cause of disability worldwide.[1] Social 
isolation,[2] loneliness,[3] and social engagement[4] have been identified as critical risk factors for 
depression in older age, and the World Health Organisation [5] has emphasised the need for age-
friendly policies to promote social inclusion and engagement among older people. However, there is 
limited evidence of how specific policies targeted at older people may promote social engagement, 
reduce loneliness and isolation, and in turn influence mental health.   
 
Evidence suggests that access to public transportation may promote social engagement in 
older age.[6, 7] In April 2006, the government implemented a policy of free bus travel on local 
services for people aged 60 and older in England.[8] In April 2008, the concessionary fare was 
extended to free bus travel nationwide.[8] Recent research suggests the bus passes have been 
associated with increases in public transportation use[9, 10] and physical activity levels,[11] and with 
lower rates of obesity.[10] Findings from qualitative studies suggest the free bus passes may have also 
improved quality of life and increased social engagement.[12-15] However, to our knowledge, no 
quantitative study has examined the effects of the free bus pass policy on mental health. 
In this paper, we exploit the natural experiment provided by the introduction of free bus 
passes and data from a large, representative cohort of older people in England to examine the impact 
of increased public transport use on depressive symptoms. In addition, we explore whether social 
isolation, loneliness, and social engagement may explain the link between transport use and 
depressive symptoms.  
METHODS 
Data 
We used data from 7 waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing [ELSA], a 
representative cohort of residents of England aged 50 years and above and their younger partners.[16] 
The sample consisted of 18,453 participants residing in England who were surveyed at one or more 
time points between 2002 and 2014. 
Statistical Analysis 
 5 
 
We used two-stage least squares [2SLS] instrumental variable [IV] regression models,[17-19] 
a common econometric technique used to examine the relationship between an outcome and an 
‘endogenous’ exposure— a variable determined by other variables in the model.[20] An endogeneity 
test indicated IV was preferable to ordinary least squares [OLS] (Appendix Table 1). The IV model 
exploits the semi-random variation in public transport use generated by the introduction of the policy 
and the age-eligibility threshold. Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the two stages in the IV models. In the 
first stage equation, the endogenous exposure (public transport use) is regressed on the instrument 
(eligibility for free bus travel) and all control variables. In the second stage equation, the outcome 
(depressive symptoms) is regressed on the predicted values of transport use derived from the first 
stage and all control variables. Analyses were conducted in Stata, version 14,[21] using the ivreg and 
ivreg2[22] commands. 
The Instrument: Free Bus Pass Eligibility 
We used a binary variable to indicate whether individuals were eligible for free bus travel at 
each wave, based on government eligibility criteria: people aged 60 years or older were classified as 
eligible between April 2006 and March 2010. Since April 2010, the eligibility age has been increasing 
in monthly increments in accordance with the increases in women’s state pension age.[8] As birth 
month is not publicly available in ELSA, , we rounded up the eligibility age between April 2010 and 
2014 as follows: 61 (2010-2012), 62 (2012-2013), and 63 (2014). Between 2010 and 2014, there were 
1,892 individuals who were not eligible based on our rounded-up eligibility ages, but who may have 
met the government’s actual age criteria. We excluded these individuals from the main analyses 
during the years their eligibility statuses were potentially misclassified, but we incorporated them 
under various eligibility assumptions in sensitivity analyses. 
Three assumptions about the instrument (eligibility for free bus passes) must be met for the 
IV model to yield unbiased estimates; it must (1) be associated with the endogenous exposure variable 
(public transport use) in the first stage, (2) be uncorrelated with the outcome (depressive symptoms) 
except through its impact on public transport use, and (3) be independent of unmeasured confounders. 
F-statistics from the first stage of the 2SLS model were greater than 10, confirming that bus pass 
eligibility is strongly associated with public transport, meeting the first condition.[23] The 
 6 
 
introduction of the bus pass and the age eligibility threshold were exogenous policy changes. 
However, a potential concern is that many individuals eligible for the bus pass were also eligible for 
state pensions. We therefore adjust for receipt of pensions in all models to control for their potential 
effect on depressive symptoms. Conditional on pension receipt and other observed covariates, we do 
not expect eligibility for free bus travel to influence depressive symptoms other than by increasing 
transport use. 
Public Transportation Use 
In 2002 and 2004, participants were asked: “Do you use public transport… a lot, quite often, 
sometimes, rarely, or never.” In 2006, this question changed to: “How often do you use public 
transport… every day or nearly every day, 2 or 3 times a week, once a week, 2 or 3 times a month, 
once a month or less, or never.” As never was the only consistent category, a binary variable was 
created that assigned a 1 to users of public transportation and a 0 to non/never users at each wave. In 
sensitivity analyses, we tested different cut-off points for the binary variable. We also restricted the 
range of data to 2006 through 2014, after the change in questionnaire, to confirm our main results 
were not an artefact of the question change.   
Depressive Symptoms, Loneliness, Social Isolation, and Social Engagement 
We used the total 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] score 
to assess depressive symptoms.[24, 25] The CES-D scale assesses interpersonal relations, positive 
affect, depressed affect, and somatic activity. Each item was scored as 1 if the participant has the 
depressive symptom, with reverse coding used for the 2 positive affect items. This resulted in a CES-
D score ranging from 0 to 8.  
We also examined potential mechanisms linking transport use and depressive symptoms, 
including loneliness, social isolation, and social engagement. Loneliness was evaluated using the 3-
item University of California Los Angeles [UCLA] Loneliness scale.[26] The items included in the 
UCLA Loneliness Scale are how often the respondent feels (1) they lack companionship, (2) left out, 
and (3) isolated from others. These items were scored as 1 for a response of “hardly ever or never,” as 
2 for “some of the time,” and as 3 for “often” and then summed for a score ranging from 3 (not 
lonely) to 9 (very lonely). Social isolation was assessed using the 5-item scale developed by Shankar 
 7 
 
et al[27] with each of the following items scored as 1: (1) Not married or cohabitating, (2) Less than 
monthly contact (including face-to-face, telephone or written/e-mail contact) with children, (3) Less 
than monthly contact with other immediate family, (4) Less than monthly contact with friends, (5) 
Does not participate in any organisations, religious groups, or committees. These items are summed 
for a score ranging from 0 (not socially isolated) to 5 (very socially isolated).  
For social engagement measures, we created binary variables to indicate whether respondents 
volunteered at least monthly, were a member of any group/club/organisation, and whether they had a 
least monthly face to face contact with children, other immediate family members, and friends.  
Controls  
We controlled for age, gender, at least one limitation in the activities of daily living [ADL’s], 
at least one limitation in the instrumental activities of daily living [IADL’s], car ownership, the 
natural log of net total non-pension household wealth, the natural log of equivalised household 
income, marital status (married, cohabitating, single/never married, widowed, divorced, separated), 
number of children in the household (0, 1, 2, 3+), and household region (North East, North West, 
Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South East, 
South West).  
A potential concern was that the bus pass eligibility age overlapped with women’s state 
pension age (Appendix Tables 2-3; Appendix Figure 2). Therefore, we also controlled for 
employment status (employed, unemployed, retired, out of labour force) and indicators of whether the 
respondent received a state pension or a private pension. In sensitivity analyses, we also (a) controlled 
for the natural log amount of state and private pensions received, (b) ran sub-group analyses by 
gender, and (c) restricted the sample to people who were out of the labour force and thus less likely to 
be eligible for pensions. 
To further examine the robustness of our results, we implemented a linear fixed effect model, 
[28] which did not use the instrument, thus avoiding potential issues from overlap between bus pass 
eligibility age and women’s state pension age. The fixed effect model exploited the longitudinal 
nature of the data and estimated whether changes in transport use were associated with changes in 
depressive symptoms within individuals. Fixed effect models use each individual as their own control 
 8 
 
to effectively eliminate all time-invariant confounding. We incorporated a wide range of covariates to 
control for measured time-varying factors.  
RESULTS 
Across all waves, 8.9% of the sample used public transport a lot or nearly every day, 11.3% 
used it quite often or 2-3 times per week, 17.2% used it sometimes or 2-5 times per month, 29.7% 
used it rarely or less than once a month, and 32% never used public transportation (Appendix Table 
4). Table 1 indicates that public transport users differed from non-users along several dimensions at 
baseline. For example, transport users were more likely to be female, retired, and to receive pensions, 
while they were less likely to have physical limitations and be socially isolated or depressed. 
Appendix Figure 3 shows that transport use varies with age, and in most years, transport use increases 
from age 50 to around age 70, after which it declines. 
Insert Table 1 
Figure 1 shows locally weighted regression smoothed curves of CES-D scores by age, 
separately for public transport users and non-users. The U-shaped curves show an average decrease in 
depressive symptoms around retirement age (60-65 years) followed by an increase in depressive 
symptoms thereafter for both users and non-users of public transport. Figure 2 suggests that transport 
users have lower average CES-D scores than non-transport users at every age. On average across all 
ages, transport users have a 0.31 lower CES-D score than non-transport users.  
Insert Figure 1  
Models estimating the association between transport use and depressive symptoms are 
summarised in Table 2. Column 1 of Table 2 presents the estimates from an OLS model and suggests 
that transport use is associated with less depressive symptoms (β: -0.122, 95% Confidence Interval 
[CI]: -0.161 to -0.083). Column 2 summarises results from the IV model. First-stage IV results 
suggest that eligibility for the free bus pass was associated with an 8% (95%CI: 6.4% to 9.6%) 
increase in public transportation use. A supplementary analysis using a logistic model indicates that 
eligibility for free bus travel was associated with increased odds of using public transportation (Odds 
Ratio: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.64) (Appendix Table 5). A supplementary model using ordinal 
categories of transport use also yields consistent results (Appendix Table 6). Results from the second 
 9 
 
stage of the IV (Table 2) suggest that increased transport use—due to eligibility for the free bus 
pass—leads to a significant decline in CES-D depressive symptom scores (β: -0.952, 95% CI: -1.712 
to -0.192). Results were of a smaller magnitude but significant and in the same direction in the fixed 
effect model (β: -0.059, 95% CI: -0.096 to -0.021) (Table 2, column 3).  
Insert Table 2 
Table 3 shows second stage results from IV models that estimate the associations between 
public transport use and loneliness, social isolation, and social engagement. Transport use was 
associated with a reduction in the UCLA loneliness score (β: -0.794, 95% CI: -1.528 to -0.061), and 
an increase in volunteering at least monthly (β: 0.237, 95% CI: 0.059 to 0.414). Transport use was 
also associated with increased face to face contact with children (β: 0.480, 95% CI: 0.208 to 0.752) 
and friends (β: 0.311, 95% CI: 0.109 to 0.513), but less contact with other family members (β: -0.320, 
95% CI: -0.566 to -0.073). We did not find associations between transport use and social isolation or 
group membership.  
Insert Table 3 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Figure 2 and Appendix Tables 7 to 13 summarise results from sensitivity analyses. Estimates 
were similar to the main results in models using logged amounts of private and state pensions, 
applying sampling and non-response weights provided by ELSA, and including individuals with 
potentially misclassified eligibility statuses. Results were also consistent in models restricting the 
sample to the period 2006-2014, during which there was no change in our measure of transport use 
(Figure 2), and in models using different cut-offs for the binary transportation variable (Appendix 
Table 8). Results for women were similar to the main estimates and to the results for men (Figure 2). 
Estimates were also consistent when restricting the sample to people out of the labour force 
(Appendix Table 9), as well as in models that excluded all controls (Appendix Table 10) and used 
multiple imputation for missing values (Appendix Tables 11-13). 
Insert Figure 2 
For most years, we had no data on frequency of bus pass use. However, in 2012 and 2014, 
ELSA participants were asked whether they had the bus pass and how often they used it in the past 
 10 
 
month. Most people who were eligible for the free bus fare reported having the bus pass (81% in 
2012, 83% in 2014). In supplementary IV models, we examined the impact of frequency of bus pass 
use on depressive symptoms (Appendix Table 14). These results suggest a dose-response relationship 
whereby more frequent use of the bus pass was associated with lower depressive symptoms.  
DISCUSSION 
 
 In this study, we show that increased public transportation use, as a result of the free bus 
pass, reduced depressive symptoms in older age. Our results suggest that benefits from increased 
transport use likely stem from reduced loneliness, increased participation in volunteering activities, 
and increased contact with children and friends. Our findings provide evidence that age-friendly 
transportation policies can improve mental health and encourage social engagement among older 
people.  
Our findings expand upon previous studies showing that the free bus passes were associated 
with benefits to physical health, through increases in physical activity, decreases in adiposity,[11] and 
lower rates of obesity.[10] Our study suggests that the benefits also extend to mental health and social 
engagement. These results are consistent with findings from qualitative interviews suggesting that the 
bus passes improved quality of life and well-being,[12, 15] and increased participation in social 
activities.[15]  
There are other mechanisms through which use of public transportation may improve mental 
health among older people. Increased use of public transportation may provide psychological benefits 
from exercise and time spent outdoors, both of which have been linked to mental health.[29, 30] 
Additionally, there is evidence that driving cessation is associated with increased depressive 
symptoms among older people.[31, 32] Free bus passes may offset some of these negative effects by 
offering older people the means to travel without a car.  
An important finding from our study is that increased transportation use was associated with 
reduced loneliness. There is a lack of large-scale interventions targeting loneliness,[33] a measure of 
dissatisfaction with the quantity and quality of social relations[34] that is relatively common in later 
life.[33] Using a quasi-experimental approach, our study shows that a policy which increases access 
to public transport for older people may offer potential to reduce loneliness.  
 11 
 
Despite the strengths of our study, there are several limitations. ELSA does not include 
urban/rural identifiers to examine effect heterogeneity across regions. Some local areas offer 
additional concessionary transport fares for older people, which are separate from the national bus 
fare scheme.[8] Although we could not study these local schemes, in sensitivity analyses, we found 
that results did not change when excluding participants from London, which has the most extensive 
set of concessionary fares (Appendix Table 15). Another limitation refers to potential violation of the 
second and third IV assumptions. For example, although we controlled for pension receipt, there may 
be some residual confounding, and we cannot fully rule out that some effect we observe in IV models 
may reflect the impact of pensions. Likewise, bus pass eligibility may have directly influenced 
depressive symptoms, for example, by making people feel valued by the government. Nevertheless, it 
is reassuring that our results were robust in fixed effect models that do not use bus pass eligibility as 
an instrument but rather exploit longitudinal changes in transport use. In addition, although less 
precisely estimated, gender-stratified results showed that estimates were similar for women and men, 
despite the fact that among the latter, state pension age is different from bus pass eligibility age. 
Overall, notwithstanding the limitations of each approach, these results provide some reassurance that 
there is a plausible relationship between public transport use and depressive symptoms.  
We note that results from the IV model were larger than those from fixed effect and OLS 
models. A potential explanation is that the IV estimate captures the local average treatment effect 
[LATE], which is the effect of increased transport use on people who changed their behaviour as a 
result of the bus pass policy (the compliers).[17] By contrast, fixed effect estimates may be closer to 
the average treatment effect, and therefore of much smaller magnitude than the LATE. 
This study suggests that an age-friendly public transportation policy, the free bus pass, 
positively impacted the mental health of older adults. Concerns have been raised about the high costs 
of the free bus scheme, which amount to approximately one billion pounds per year.[35] These 
concerns, however, overlook potential savings from reduced depressive symptoms, as the annual cost 
of diagnosed depression in England has been estimated at 7.5 billion pounds.[36] Increased transport 
use was also associated with increased social engagement, particularly volunteering. This suggests 
that the free bus pass may also bring wider societal benefits.[11, 37] Failure to consider these 
 12 
 
unanticipated mental health and social benefits of the free bus pass policy may lead to an 
overestimation of the cost and underappreciation of the value of the policy.
