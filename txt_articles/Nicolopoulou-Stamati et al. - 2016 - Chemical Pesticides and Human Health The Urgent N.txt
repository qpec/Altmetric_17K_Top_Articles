The industrialization of the agricultural sector has increased the chemical burden on 
natural ecosystems. Pesticides are agrochemicals used in agricultural lands, public 
health programs, and urban green areas in order to protect plants and humans from var-
ious diseases. However, due to their known ability to cause a large number of negative 
health and environmental effects, their side effects can be an important environmental 
health risk factor. The urgent need for a more sustainable and ecological approach has 
produced many innovative ideas, among them agriculture reforms and food production 
implementing sustainable practice evolving to food sovereignty. It is more obvious than 
ever that the society needs the implementation of a new agricultural concept regarding 
food production, which is safer for man and the environment, and to this end, steps such 
as the declaration of Nyéléni have been taken.

iNTRODUCTiON
Pesticides are substances or mixtures of substances that are mainly used in agriculture or in public 
health protection programs in order to protect plants from pests, weeds or diseases, and humans from 
vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and schistosomiasis. Insecticides, fungicides, 
herbicides, rodenticides, and plant growth regulators are typical examples (1–3). These products 
are also used for other purposes, such as the improvement and maintenance of non-agricultural 
areas like public urban green areas and sport fields (4, 5). Furthermore, there are other less known 
applications of these chemical substances, such as in pet shampoos (4), building materials, and boat 
bottoms in order to eliminate or prevent the presence of unwanted species (6).
Many of the pesticides have been associated with health and environmental issues (1, 2, 7–12), 
and the agricultural use of certain pesticides has been abandoned (2). Exposure to pesticides can be 
through contact with the skin, ingestion, or inhalation. The type of pesticide, the duration and route 
of exposure, and the individual health status (e.g., nutritional deficiencies and healthy/damaged 
skin) are determining factors in the possible health outcome. Within a human or animal body, 
pesticides may be metabolized, excreted, stored, or bioaccumulated in body fat (1, 2, 13). The numer-
ous negative health effects that have been associated with chemical pesticides include, among other 
effects, dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, carcinogenic, respiratory, reproductive, and 
endocrine effects (1, 2, 8, 10, 14–30). Furthermore, high occupational, accidental, or intentional 
exposure to pesticides can result in hospitalization and death (1, 31).
Residues of pesticides can be found in a great variety of  
everyday foods and beverages, includ-
ing for instance cooked meals, water, wine, fruit juices, refreshments, and animal feeds (32–39). 
Furthermore, it should be noted that washing and peeling cannot completely remove the residues

(40). In the majority of cases, the concentrations do not exceed 
the legislatively determined safe levels (36, 39, 41, 42). However, 
these “safe limits” may underestimate the real health risk as in 
the case of simultaneous exposure to two or more chemical 
substances, which occurs in real-life conditions and may have 
synergistic effects (1, 43). Pesticides residues have also been 
detected in human breast milk samples, and there are concerns 
about prenatal exposure and health effects in children (13, 44–46).
This current review aims at highlighting the urgent need for a 
new concept in agriculture involving a drastic reduction in the use 
of chemical pesticides. Given the fact that the health effects have 
been extensively discussed in the current literature, this paper 
focuses on the major chronic health effects and recent findings 
regarding health effects that have been associated with exposure 
to common classes of chemical pesticides, i.e., organochlorines, 
organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, triazines, and neo-
nicotinoids. More emphasis is given to the widely used herbicide 
“glyphosate,” which is an organophosphate pesticide very closely 
related to current agriculture (47). The important health effects, 
as discussed below, reveal the urgent need for implementing 
alternative solutions.
ORGANOCHLORiNe PeSTiCiDeS
The most widely known organochlorine pesticide is dichlorodi-
phenyltrichloroethane, i.e., the insecticide DDT, the uncontrolled 
use of which raised many environmental and human health 
issues (2, 48, 49). Dieldrin, endosulfan, heptachlor, dicofol, and 
methoxychlor are some other organochlorines used as pesticides.
There are a few countries that still use DDT or plan to rein-
troduce it for public health purposes (13, 48, 49). Furthermore, 
DDT is also used as a solution in certain solvents (2). It is a 
ubiquitous chemical substance, and it is believed that every living 
organism on Earth has a DDT body burden, mainly stored in 
the fat (48, 50). There is also evidence that DDT and its metabo-
lite p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) may have 
endocrine-disrupting potential and carcinogenic action (48). 
In utero exposure to both DDT and DDE has been associated 
with neurodevelopmental effects in children (51). Moreover, a 
recent study related DDE to hepatic lipid dysfunction in rats (50).
The general class of organochlorine pesticides has been asso-
ciated with health effects, such as endocrine disorders (10, 52), 
effects on embryonic development (53), lipid metabolism (54), 
and hematological and hepatic alterations (55). Their carcinogenic 
potential is questioned, but concerns about possible carcinogenic 
action should not be underestimated (38, 39, 56, 57).
ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PeSTiCiDeS
Organophosphates, which were promoted as a more ecologi-
cal alternative to organochlorines (58), include a great variety 
of pesticides, the most common of which is glyphosate. This 
class also includes other known pesticides, such as malathion, 
parathion, and dimethoate; some are known for their endocrine-
disrupting potential (10, 59, 60). This class of pesticides has been 
associated with effects on the function of cholinesterase enzymes 
(58), decrease in insulin secretion, disruption of normal cellular 
metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats (54), and also 
with genotoxic effects (61) and effects on mitochondrial function, 
causing cellular oxidative stress and problems to the nervous and 
endocrine systems (54).
Population-based studies have revealed possible relations 
between the exposure to organophosphorus pesticides and 
serious health effects including cardiovascular diseases (62), 
negative effects on the male reproductive system (63) and on the 
nervous system (58, 64–66), dementia (67), and also a possible 
increased risk for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (68). Furthermore, 
prenatal exposure to organophosphates has been correlated with 
decreased gestational duration (69) and neurological problems 
occurring in children (70).
Regarding glyphosate, the safety of which is the subject of an 
ongoing scientific controversy (60, 71–76), it is the most widely 
used herbicide in current agriculture (47, 75), especially since the 
introduction of glyphosate-tolerant genetically modified crops, 
such as certain types of soybean and maize (60, 77–80). Its exten-
sive use in genetically modified soybean cultivation has raised 
concerns about possible synergistic estrogenic effects due to the 
simultaneous exposure to glyphosate and to the phytoestrogen 
“genistein,” which is a common isoflavone present in soybeans 
and soybean products (80, 81).
Glyphosate can display endocrine-disrupting activity (80, 82), 
affect human erythrocytes in vitro (83), and promote carcino-
genicity in mouse skin (84). Furthermore, it is considered to cause 
extreme disruption in shikimate pathway, which is a pathway 
found in plants and bacteria as well as in human gut bacteria. 
This disruption may affect the supply of human organism with 
essential amino acids (85). Commercial glyphosate formulations 
are considered to be more toxic than the active substance alone 
(80, 83, 86, 87). Glyphosate-based herbicides, such as the well-
known “Roundup,” can cause DNA damages and act as endocrine 
disruptors in human cell lines (60) and in rat testicular cells (88), 
cause damages to cultured human cutaneous cells (89), and 
promote cell death in the testicular cells of experimental animals 
(88, 90). There is evidence also for their possible ability to affect 
cytoskeleton and intracellular transport (91).
A recent study examined the possible relation between 
glyphosate, genetically modified crops, and health deteriora-
tion in the USA. Correlation analyses raised concerns about 
possible connections between glyphosate use and various 
health effects and diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, 
strokes, autism, kidney failure, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s 
diseases, and cancer (82). Furthermore, there are concerns 
about the possible ability of glyphosate to cause gluten intoler-
ance, a health problem associated with deficiencies in essential 
trace metals, reproductive issues, and increased risk to develop 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (92).
CARBAMATe PeSTiCiDeS
Carbamate pesticides, such as aldicarb, carbofuran, and ziram, 
are another class of chemical pesticides that have been associated 
with endocrine-disrupting activity (10, 93), possible reproductive 
disorders (63, 93), and effects on cellular metabolic mechanisms 
and mitochondrial function (54). Moreover, in vitro studies have 
 3

Chemical Pesticides and Human Health
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org
July 2016 | Volume 4 | Article 148
revealed the ability of carbamate pesticides to cause cytotoxic 
and genotoxic effects in hamster ovarian cells (94) and to induce 
apoptosis and necrosis in human immune cells (95), natural killer 
cells (96, 97), and also apoptosis in T lymphocytes (98).
Furthermore, it has been confirmed that carbaryl, which 
belongs to the category of carbamate pesticides, can act as a 
ligand for the hepatic aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription 
factor involved in the mechanism of dioxin toxicity (99). There 
is also evidence for the ability of carbamate pesticides to cause 
neurobehavioral effects (65, 100), increased risk for dementia 
(67), and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (101).
OTHeR CLASSeS OF CHeMiCAL 
PeSTiCiDeS
Triazines, such as atrazine, simazine, and ametryn, are another 
class of chemical pesticides that have been related to endocrine-
disrupting effects and reproductive toxicity (10, 102, 103). 
Moreover, it was found that there is a possible statistical relation-
ship between triazine herbicides and breast cancer incidence 
(104). Atrazine is the most known of the triazines, and it is a very 
widely used herbicide that has been associated with oxidative 
stress (103), cytotoxicity (105, 106), and dopaminergic effects 
(107, 108). Furthermore, the exposure of experimental animals 
to atrazine has been associated with reproductive toxicity (109) 
and delays in sexual maturation (110).
Synthetic pyrethroids, such as fenvalerate, permethrin, and 
sumithrin, are considered to be among the safer insecticides 
currently available for agricultural and public health purposes 
(111, 112). However, there is evidence for their ability to dis-
play endocrine-disrupting activity (10, 113–115), and to affect 
reproductive parameters in experimental animals including 
reproductive behavior (114, 116). Furthermore, a recent study 
related more than one pyrethroid metabolite to DNA damages 
in human sperm, raising concerns about possible negative effects 
on human reproductive health (117). It should also be mentioned 
that there are also concerns about their possible ability to display 
developmental neurotoxicity (25, 118, 119).
Neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, thiacloprid, 
and guadipyr, are relatively new and also the most extensively 
used insecticides (120) that were promoted for their low risk for 
non-target organisms (121). However, there is plenty of evidence 
to the contrary (115, 122–125); their effect on bees is a common 
example (124, 125). There is also evidence for possible effects 
on the endocrine and reproductive systems of animals (115, 
126, 127). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that neonicoti-
noids are able to increase the expression of the enzyme aromatase, 
which is engaged in breast cancer and also plays an important role 
during developmental periods (128).
URGeNT NeeD TOwARD CLeANeR AND 
SAFeR AGRiCULTURAL PRACTiCeS
Current agricultural practices include the wide production 
and extensive use of chemicals known for their ability to cause 
negative health effects in humans and wildlife and to degrade the 
natural environment. Therefore, an urgent strategic approach is 
needed for a reduction in the use of agrochemicals and for the 
implementation of sustainable practices. Furthermore, current 
agriculture has to implement environmentally friendlier prac-
tices that pose fewer public health risks. Reforming agricultural 
practices aligned to fulfill these criteria is a step toward the 
sustainability of the agricultural sector in contrast to precision 
agriculture (129–134).
However, the reduction in the use of agrochemicals by applying 
them only when and where they are necessary, the spatiotemporal 
variability of all the soil and crop factors of a given field must 
be taken into consideration. This variability includes yield, field, 
soil, and crop variability but also factors, such as wind damage or 
flooding. Technological systems, such as geographical informa-
tion systems, global positioning systems, and various sensors, 
can be useful (130–132, 135). These technological systems are 
developed by precision agriculture which of course we do not 
endorse, but we consider that selected technological tools can 
be used to decrease risks for environmental pollution and water 
pollution and to enhance economic benefits stemming from the 
reduction in the use of chemical products (130, 132).
It should be clear that the reform into an aggregate of machine-
centered procedures and losing a human-centered character are 
not the desired. In contrast, the reduction in the use of pesticides 
assisted by innovative technological methods we strongly believe 
that may reduce the use of chemical substances or maybe it can 
lead to a total abandonment in many cases, such as in the case 
of urban green areas. The decision of the Italian village of Mals 
near the Austrian and Swiss borders to ban the use of pesticides 
and produce pesticide-free foods can be considered as a pioneer 
example across Europe. In 2014, more than 70% of the inhab-
itants of Mals who participated in a referendum voted against 
the use of pesticides (136). This historical decision apart that is 
consistent with the food sovereignty concept, which is discussed 
in the following section, also declares the need for disseminat-
ing information for raising awareness of the public in order to 
develop informed consents.
An innovative idea developed by the international movement 
“Via Campesina,” was the democratic concept of food sovereignty 
that has accompanied the progress toward sustainability for more 
than 20 years. It acquired a strong basis in 2007 in the African 
village Nyéléni in Mali, where representatives from more than 
eighty countries adopted the “Declaration of Nyéléni.” According 
to its principles, all the people of the world have the right to 
choose their own national and local policies to eliminate poverty, 
malnutrition, and hunger, to protect their traditions and also the 
natural environment (137–141).
The industrialization of agriculture has brought a series of 
problems including economic, social, and environmental impacts 
that local populations cannot manage. Furthermore, the overpro-
duction of food, export-oriented monocultures, the demand for 
cheap labor, and the other characteristics of industrialization have 
clearly failed to solve the problems of hunger and malnutrition. 
On the contrary, inequitable food distribution, overexploitation 
of land and water sources, the overuse of agrochemicals, and the 
degradation of the natural environment are some of the results of 
the dominant agricultural model (138, 142–144). Food sovereignty 
 4

Chemical Pesticides and Human Health

promotes social, economic, and environmental  
sustainability, for 
instance, through the protection of the indigenous population 
and the production of food for distribution in local markets, and 
there is an ongoing effort for its recognition as a basic human 
right (138–140, 142, 145).
The dominant agricultural model has increased the chemical 
burden on natural environment (140, 142). Moreover, interna-
tional agrochemical companies absorb traditional agricultural 
companies, leading to an industrialized agriculture model and 
leaving the local farmers and small producers to face the con-
sequences (138, 143). In many cases, these people are obliged to 
adopt environmentally unfriendly techniques to increase their 
production in order to survive in the market, causing more envi-
ronmental degradation (138). However, due to the fact that food 
sovereignty does not necessarily mean pesticide-free, organic 
food production, and because it does not determine pesticide use 
levels, for this reason, international eco-friendly standards should 
be implemented. People must be free to decide the method of 
production of their own food, and an important component of 
this decision concerns agrochemical products. The decision of 
the people of Mals to reject pesticides can be considered a step 
in this direction.
DiSCUSSiON
The need for protection against pests is a given and has its roots 
in antiquity, when both organic and chemical substances were 
applied as pesticides (146). Since then, numerous chemical pesti-
cides have been produced, and now multinational agrochemical 
companies, which mostly control global food production, apply 
new chemical substances with pesticide properties and imple-
ment biotechnological advances, thus diverging from traditional 
agricultural methods. Furthermore, current agricultural practices 
are based on the wide use of chemical pesticides that have been 
associated with negative impacts on human health, wildlife, and 
natural environment (9, 11, 120, 147, 148).
Current agriculture has to deal with important factors, such 
as population growth, food security, health risks from chemical 
pesticides, pesticide resistance, degradation of the natural envi-
ronment, and climate change (149–155). In recent years, some 
new concepts regarding agriculture and food production have 
appeared. A concept as such is climate-smart agriculture that 
seeks solutions in the new context of climate change (152, 153). 
Another major ongoing controversy exists between the advocates 
and the opponents of genetically engineered pesticide-resistant 
plants, regarding not only their safety (29, 156, 157) but also their 
impact on pesticide use (158–160).
Furthermore, the real-life chronic exposure to mixture of 
pesticides with possible additive or synergistic effects requires 
an in depth research. The underlying scientific uncertainty, the 
exposure of vulnerable groups and the fact that there are numer-
ous possible mixtures reveal the real complex character of the 
problem (161–163). The combination of substances with prob-
ably carcinogenic or endocrine-disrupting effects may produce 
unknown adverse health effects. Therefore, the determination of 
“safe” levels of exposure to single pesticides may underestimate 
the real health effects, ignoring also the chronic exposure to 
multiple chemical substances.
Taking into consideration the health and environmental 
effects of chemical pesticides, it is clear that the need for a new 
concept in agriculture is urgent. This new concept must be based 
on a drastic reduction in the application of chemical pesticides, 
and can result in health, environmental, and economic benefits 
(164) as it is also envisaged in European Common Agricultural 
Policy (CAP) (165).
We believe in developing pesticide-free zones by implement-
ing a total ban at local level and in urban green spaces is easily 
achievable. Furthermore, alternative procedures to the current 
model of food production should be implemented in new agricul-
tural policies targeting sustainable development and protection 
of the consumers’ health. Despite the difficulties of establishing 
an innovative concept, the transition to a new cleaner and safer 
agricultural model is necessary.
