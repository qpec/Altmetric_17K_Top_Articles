p38α activation of multiple effectors may underlie the failure of global p38α inhibitors in clinical trials. A unique inhibitor 
(CDD-450) was developed that selectively blocked p38α activation of the proinflammatory kinase MK2 while sparing p38α 
activation of PRAK and ATF2. Next, the hypothesis that the p38α–MK2 complex mediates inflammasome priming cues was 
tested. CDD-450 had no effect on NLRP3 expression, but it decreased IL-1β expression by promoting IL-1β mRNA degradation. 
Thus, IL-1β is regulated not only transcriptionally by NF-κB and posttranslationally by the inflammasomes but also 
posttranscriptionally by p38α–MK2. CDD-450 also accelerated TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA decay, inhibited inflammation in mice 
with cryopyrinopathy, and was as efficacious as global p38α inhibitors in attenuating arthritis in rats and cytokine expression 
by cells from patients with cryopyrinopathy and rheumatoid arthritis. These findings have clinical translation implications 
as CDD-450 offers the potential to avoid tachyphylaxis associated with global p38α inhibitors that may result from their 
inhibition of non-MK2 substrates involved in antiinflammatory and housekeeping responses.

Introduction
The mechanisms that govern posttranscriptional regulation 
of inflammasome components are unknown despite advances 
in transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of these 
constituents. NF-κB regulates the transcription of pro-IL1β 
and NLRP3 (Bauernfeind et al., 2009; Segovia et al., 2012) and 
is activated by IκB kinase 2 (IKK2), which itself is phosphory-
lated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β–activated kinase 
1 (TAK1; Sakurai, 2012). TAK1 also activates p38α MAPK (p38α; 
Sakurai, 2012), suggesting that p38α plays a role in inflam-
masome priming signals. Specific docking domains present in 
p38α substrates facilitate the binding of these proteins to p38α 
(Mayor et al., 2007). Relevant p38α substrates include MAPK-ac-
tivated protein kinase 2 (MK2), p38α-related/activated protein 
kinase (PRAK), and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). 
Activated MK2 phosphorylates downstream effectors including 
adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich element binding proteins such as 
tristetraprolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
A0, which modulate the stability of mRNA containing AU-rich 
elements such as those encoding TNF-α and IL-6 (Taylor et al., 
1996; Hitti et al., 2006). Evidence strongly indicates that p38α 
inflammatory actions are mediated by MK2 (Kotlyarov et al., 
1999; Hegen et al., 2006).
IL-1β and IL-18 are overproduced in cryopyrin-associated 
periodic syndromes (CAPS), a spectrum of autoinflammatory 
disorders caused by NLRP3-activating mutations (Hoffman 
and Brydges, 2011; de Jesus et al., 2015). Anti–IL-1β biologics 
are widely used in the treatment of CAPS, but these drugs have 
drawbacks including high price, the requirement for parenteral 
administration, the potential for development of resistance, and 
the lack of efficacy against skeletal lesions (Neven et al., 2010; 
Rigante et al., 2011; Sibley et al., 2012). IL-1β production is also 
increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a disease in which TNF-α 
expression and p38α activity are up-regulated (Rosengren et al., 
2005; Mbalaviele and Monahan, 2008; Kolly et al., 2010). We 
recently reported that TNF-α is also involved in the pathogenesis 
of cryopyrinopathies (McGeough et al., 2017). Because p38α regu-
lates the expression of multiple inflammatory mediators includ-
ing IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, inhibition of this kinase should in the-
ory provide superior efficacy compared with targeted blockade 
of individual factors. Several relatively safe p38α inhibitors were

developed to test this principle, but unfortunately, they failed in 
phase II RA clinical studies for reasons including the lack of sus-
tained efficacy (Hammaker and Firestein, 2010; Genovese et al., 
2011; Kyttaris, 2012). Potential explanations for the transient effi-
cacy include limited dosing to avoid toxicity, inadequate distribu-
tion to the site of inflammation or pain, down-regulation of anti-
inflammatory pathways, redundancy in the signaling network, 
or the inhibition of key proteins that are involved in the feedback 
regulation of other MAPK pathways. In this regard, inhibition of 
feedback mechanisms may up-regulate other proinflammatory 
pathways, resulting in increased inflammation. Thus, there is 
still a need for the development of a safe and efficacious p38α 
pathway inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
including CAPS and RA.
CDD-450 selectively blocks p38α activation of MK2 while 
sparing the inhibition of other effectors of p38α. CDD-450 inhib-
its the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and is as efficacious 
as global p38α inhibitors in decreasing inflammation in disease 
models. Thus, selective inhibition of the p38α–MK2 complex, 
which may be desirable from a safety standpoint, is not only 
achievable pharmacologically but is also efficacious in inhibiting 
inflammatory diseases in preclinical models.
Results and discussion
Selective inhibition of p38α–MK2 decreases IL-1β, IL-6, and 
TNF-α production by promoting mRNA instability
CDD-450 (Fig. S1 A) was designed to selectively bind to and 
inhibit the p38α–MK2 complex. It exhibited decreased potency 
for inhibiting p38α alone or bound to other substrates as it was 
at least 700× more potent in inhibiting p38α–MK2 than p38α–
PRAK or p38α–ATF2 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, a classical 
p38α inhibitor, CDD-110, a racemate of PH-797804 (Hope et 
al., 2009), inhibited p38α–MK2 and p38α–PRAK with similar 
potency (Fig. 1 C).
The interface between p38α and docked MK2 creates unique 
binding surfaces near the p38α ATP site and an additional MK2-de-
rived cleft relative to p38α alone (ter Haar et al., 2007). These new 
surfaces and cleft exhibit suitable properties for targeted drug 
design (Fig. S1 B). CDD-450 was designed to interact with the 
p38α and MK2 surfaces of the interface cleft in the docked com-
plex (Fig. S1 C). The CDD-450 MK2 binding region had dissimilar 
residues relative to PRAK, resulting in the observed differential 
in inhibitor binding to the two complexes. In contrast, binding 
interactions of the inhibitor CDD-110 were primarily limited to 
the p38α surface of the docked complex (Fig. S1 D). Surface plas-
mon resonance analysis of p38α binding to immobilized MK2 
in the presence of CDD-450 demonstrated a stabilization of the 
complex (increased t1/2) relative to p38α–MK2 alone (47.5×) or 
the p38α–MK2 complex in the presence of CDD-110 (4×; Fig. S1 
E). These observations indicate that CDD-450 binds more tightly 
to and stabilizes p38α–MK2 relative to CDD-110. CDD-450 was 
also highly selective across the human kinome, displaying >350× 
potency differential for inhibiting the 193 kinases tested (Fig. 
S1, F and G). Thus, CDD-450 selectively inhibits the p38α–MK2 
inflammatory axis with minimal cross-reactivity for blocking 
p38α activation of other substrates involved in antiinflammatory 
and housekeeping responses. Selective inhibitors of p38α–MK2 
have been reported, but their efficacy in disease models was not 
evaluated (Cumming et al., 2015).
The role of p38α and MK2 in posttranscriptional regulation 
of IL-1β is not well studied. CAPS offer a model for testing the 
hypothesis that the p38α–MK2 axis regulates inflammasome 
priming signals as these disorders are associated with overse-
cretion of IL-1β and are generally responsive to treatment with 
biological IL-1 inhibitors (Koné-Paut and Galeotti, 2015). From 
among these syndromes, neonatal-onset multisystem inflamma-
tory disease (NOM 
ID) is the most severe phenotype (Agostini et 
al., 2004; de Jesus et al., 2015; Hoffman and Broderick, 2016). To 
determine whether p38α–MK2 regulates inflammasome priming 
signals, we used NOM 
ID mice expressing constitutively activated 
NLRP3 in myeloid cells driven by lysozyme M-Cre (Qu et al., 2015; 
Wang et al., 2017). The phenotype of these mice resembles that 
of mice globally expressing NLRP3 mutant, although the disease 
is less severe in mice with myeloid-restricted expression of the 
transgene (Bonar et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). 
LPS markedly induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA expression 
in WT and NOM 
ID bone marrow macrophages (BMMs; Fig. 1 D 
and not depicted); these responses correlated with p38α and 
MK2 activation (Fig. S2, A and B) and were inhibited by CDD-
450 (Fig. 1 D). MK2 phosphorylation peaked at 30 min before 
returning to baseline levels 180 min after stimulation. CDD-450 
inhibited the transient LPS-stimulated MK2 phosphorylation at 
15 and 30 min, but it had little effect at 180 min, when MK2 acti-
vation returned to baseline state (Fig. S2 B). CDD-450 was not 
cytotoxic at efficacious concentrations tested in this study (not 
depicted). This inhibitor crossed over p38β (Fig. S1 F), but the lit-
erature overwhelmingly indicates that p38α but not p38β drives 
inflammation in diseases (Hale et al., 1999; Korb et al., 2006). 
IL-1β mRNA biosynthesis was also inhibited by a selective IKK2 
inhibitor, PHA-408 (Fig. 1 D; Mbalaviele et al., 2009), consistent 
with NF-ҡB’s role in inflammasome priming signals. LPS stimu-
lated the expression of NLRP3 mRNA and protein (Figs. 1 E and 
S2 B) and IL-18 mRNA to a lesser degree (Fig. 1 F). Notably, NLRP3 
and IL-18 expression was decreased by IKK2 inhibitor (Fig. 1, E 
and F) but not CDD-450 (Figs. 1 E and S2 B; unpublished data). 
CDD-450 also had no effect on the expression of NLRP3 interact-
ing partners including the adapter protein ASC, caspase-1, and 
the kinase NEK7 (not depicted; Broz and Dixit, 2016; Shi et al., 
2016; Man et al., 2017).
The role of p38α–MK2 in the stability of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, 
and NLRP3 transcripts in WT or NOM 
ID BMMs stimulated with 
LPS was studied. CDD-450 promoted the degradation of IL-1β 
mRNA (Fig. 1, G and H) and IL-6 mRNA (Fig. S2 C) but had no 
effect on the decay of NLRP3 mRNA (Fig. 1, I and J). To reinforce 
these observations, PF-3644022 was used because it directly tar-
gets MK2 (Mourey et al., 2010) but not the p38α–MK2 complex. 
Consistent with the concept of the p38α–MK2 axis, PF-3644022 
promoted the degradation of mRNA encoding IL-1β (Fig. 1 K) and 
TNF-α (Fig. 1 L). The IKK2 inhibitor had no impact on mRNA 
stability (Fig. 1, G-J), consistent with the function of NF-ҡB 
in the regulation of transcription but not posttranscriptional 
events. Importantly, IL-1β secretion by LPS-primed WT and 
NOM 
ID BMMs was separately inhibited by both CDD-450 and

IKK2 inhibitor (Fig. 1, M and N). Recent evidence implicating 
kinases in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Broz and 
Dixit, 2016; Man et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017) prompted us to 
determine the effect of CDD-450 in the activation of this inflam-
masome, which can be monitored through the binding of the 
fluorescent FLI 
CA FAM-YVAD-FMK probe to active caspase-1 
(Alippe et al., 2017). Exposure of LPS-primed cells to the NLRP3 
inflammasome activator nigericin resulted in activation of 
caspase-1, detected as green fluorescent foci (Fig. S2 D). Con-

CDD-450 had no effect on this response (Fig. S2 E), which was 
absent in caspase-1/11-deficient cells as expected (Fig. S2 F). 
Collectively, the results show that CDD-450 inhibits IL-1β pro-
duction through promotion of IL-1β mRNA instability but not 
destabilization of inflammasome assembling signals. As a result, 
this inhibitor should in principle inhibit IL-1β production driven 
by any inflammasome.
CDD-450 attenuates NOM 
ID-associated complications in mice
NOM 
ID mice were used to evaluate the in vivo role of p38α–
MK2 in NOM 
ID pathogenesis. Because constitutive activation of 
the NLRP3 inflammasome caused premature lethality (Bonar et 
al., 2012), we generated Nlrp3fl(D301N)/+;CreER mice for postnatal 
conditional tamoxifen-induced NLRP3 activation and gener-
ation of viable adult NOM 
ID mice (conditional NOM 
ID; NOM 
IDc). CDD-450 and CDD-111, a global p38α inhibitor previously 
reported as SD-0006 (Burnette et al., 2009), were formulated 
in chow with the inhibitor level (parts per million) selected 
based on achieving sustained >60% inhibition of LPS-induced 
TNF-α expression (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the efficacy of CDD-
450 but not CDD-111 in blocking LPS-induced TNF-α expres-
sion persisted for up to 4 wk after dosing. These results sug-
gest that the p38α–MK2 specificity exhibited by CDD-450 may 
avoid transient efficacy associated with global p38α inhibitors. 
WT mice fed with normal chow or CDD-450 chow gained body 
weight undistinguishably (Fig. S2 G). In a separate experiment, 
WT mice fed with CDD-450–containing chow and treated with 
tamoxifen lost body weight compared with mice given normal 
chow (Fig. S2 H). Concomitant exposure to CDD-450 chow 
and tamoxifen was therefore not well tolerated; the under-
lying mechanisms are unknown. Despite this caveat, CDD-
450–treated NOM 
IDc mice lost significantly less body weight 
than untreated NOM 
IDc mice (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, ∼35% 
of untreated NOM 
IDc mice developed skin lesions, and 20% of 
these mice died over the 7-wk period, but neither occurred in 
CDD-450–treated mice (Fig. 2 C).
Inflammation in NOM 
IDc mice was associated with increased 
p38α phosphorylation (Fig. S2 I), over-production of IL-1β 
(Fig. 2 D) and IL-18 in bone marrow (Fig. S2 J), and splenomegaly 
(Fig. 2 E). These responses correlated with an increased num-
ber of white blood cells (Fig. 2 F) accompanied by neutrophilia 
(Fig. 2 G), anemia (Fig. 2 H), thrombocytosis (Fig. 2 I), and inflam-
mation in multiple organs including liver (Fig. 2, J–M, dotted cir-
cle), spleen, and brain (not depicted). As shown in these figures, 
all the inflammatory responses in NOM 
ID mice were attenuated 
by CDD-450. The antiinflammatory effects of CDD-450 are likely 
underrepresented because untreated NOM 
IDc mice with severe 
disease died prematurely and were therefore not included in 
endpoint readouts. Thus, selective inhibition of p38α–MK2 
impairs IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and disease manifestations 
in NOM 
IDc mice. CDD-450 likely decreased IL-18 expression in 
vivo (Fig. S2 J) by indirectly inhibiting systemic inflammation 
because it had no direct effect on the expression of this cytokine 
in vitro (Fig. 1 F). Collectively, these findings are consistent with 
other data indicating that ablation of IL-1 receptor in NOM 
ID 
mice prevented splenomegaly (Fig. S2 K) and skeletal dysplasia 
(Wang et al., 2017).
CDD-450 prevents bone destruction in NOM 
ID mice
Skeletal complications including low bone mass are hallmarks of 
NOM 
ID (Hill et al., 2007). Osteopenia caused by increased osteo-
clast differentiation was also observed in NOM 
ID mice (Bonar 
et al., 2012; Snouwaert et al., 2016). An increased number of 
osteoclasts was observed on trabecular bone surfaces (Fig. 3, A 
and B, arrowheads) and on cortical bone surfaces (Fig. 3, C and 
D) in NOM 
IDc mice—a phenotype that was prevented by CDD-
450. Consistent with in vivo results, CDD-450 inhibited in vitro 
osteoclast formation induced by RAN 
KL (Fig. 3, E and F), the 
obligatory osteoclastogenic cytokine that activates p38α among 
other pathways in osteoclast precursors (Matsumoto et al., 2000; 
Mansky et al., 2002; Mbalaviele et al., 2006). These results are 
also consistent with previous research implicating MK2 in phys-
iological and pathological bone resorption through regulation of 
osteoclast differentiation (Braun et al., 2013). Collectively, these 
results indicate that treatment with CDD-450 prevents osteope-
nia in NOM 
IDc mice through inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.
CDD-450 inhibits cytokine production in human cells and 
prevents joint destruction in inflammatory arthritis in rats
To evaluate how these findings may translate into human tissues, 
experiments were conducted using human peripheral blood 
monocyte (PBMC) isolated from CAPS patients in which the 
disease is triggered by exposure to low temperatures and from 
a healthy control. CAPS PBMC spontaneously produced high 
amounts of IL-1β at 32°C but not at 37°C (Fig. 4 A), whereas IL-1β 
production by healthy control PBMC required LPS treatment 
(Fig. 4 B). In both cases, CDD-450 reduced IL-1β secretion and 
promoted IL-1β mRNA instability (Fig. 4 C). Although the effects 
of CDD-450 on NLRP3 and IL-18 mRNA expression in CAPS 
PBMC were not analyzed, the data show that CDD-450 inhibits 
IL-1β production by normal and CAPS PBMC.
As noted above, IL-1β production is increased in RA 
(Mbalaviele et al., 2017). Because IL-1β levels and p38α activity 
are dysregulated in RA (Mbalaviele and Monahan, 2008) and 
IL-1β and TNF-α regulate the expression of each other (Bot et al., 
1990; Ikejima et al., 1990; Wei et al., 2005; Tian et al., 2013), RA 
represents another disease for determining the impact of p38α–
MK2 inhibition. We found that LPS, TNF-α, and IL-1β robustly 
stimulated IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3 mRNA expression in synovial 
fibroblasts from an RA patient (Fig. 4, D–F). Because IL-1β was 
more potent than LPS or TNF-α in regulating its own expression 
under our experimental conditions, the effects of CDD-450 on 
IL-1β–induced responses were tested. CDD-450 decreased IL-1β 
mRNA levels (Fig. 4 G), which correlated with accelerated loss of 
IL-1β transcripts (Fig. 4 H). In various in vitro systems and animal 
models, CDD-450 inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-α 
and IL-1β with IC50 in the 1–10-nM range and IL-6 with IC50 in the 
100-nMrange (Fig. S3, A and B). CDD-450 also accentuated deg-
radation of TNF-α mRNA induced by IL-1β in RA synovial fibro-
blasts (Fig. 4 I) or LPS in human PBMC (not depicted). Although 
CDD-450 blocked MK2 phosphorylation induced by IL-1β in RA 
synovial fibroblasts (Fig. 4 J) and LPS in U937 cells (Fig. S3 C), it 
had no inhibitory effect on LPS activation of the IKK2, ERK1/2, 
and JNK pathways in U937 cells (Fig. S3, D–F). It remains unclear 
whether CDD-450 regulated TNF-α production in vivo directly

or indirectly via IL-1β. In any case, CDD-450 actions are specific 
to p38α–MK2 blockade because it spared IKK2, JNK, and ERK1/2 
pathways while exhibiting comparable efficacy in inhibiting 
MK2 and HSP27 phosphorylation and cytokine production.
The efficacy of CDD-450 was evaluated in streptococcal cell 
wall (SCW)-induced arthritis in the rat, a model in which numer-
ous inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β are 
highly expressed (Mbalaviele et al., 2006). CDD-450 treatment 
(oral gavage, 2×/day dosing) was administrated therapeutically 
starting on day 9, the onset period of the chronic inflammatory 
phase. Arthritis in the SCW model was characterized by the 
swelling of the hind paw particularly the ankle joints (Fig. 5 A). 
CDD-450 inhibited paw swelling as did CDD-110, results that 
were consistent with 3D microcomputed tomography (µCT) 
reconstruction pictures showing the joint protective effects of 
CDD-450 (Fig. 5 B). Bone mineral density was also preserved by 
CDD-450 (Fig. 5 C). These findings demonstrate that CDD-450 
exhibits disease-modifying properties, protecting joints from 
destruction in a model of inflammatory arthritis.
CDD-450 has the potential to translate the observed preclin-
ical efficacy into clinical studies based upon its oral drug-like 
properties. Metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic proprieties 
of CDD-450 (e.g., long half-life, low clearance, high oral bioavail-
ability, and high volume of distribution; Fig. S3 G) are consistent

with oral, 1×/day or 2×/day dosing in humans. Furthermore, 
CDD-450 was not genotoxic or mutagenic and did not inhibit the 
cardiac hERG channel. In vivo safety experiments in the rat sug-
gest that CDD-450 was well tolerated at exposures >30× higher 
than the predicted Cmax efficacious exposure (Fig. S3 G).
In conclusion, CDD-450 selectively blocks p38α activation 
of the proinflammatory kinase MK2 while sparing p38α acti-
vation of other effectors such as PRAK and ATF2. Use of CDD-
450 helped to reveal a critical role of the p38α–MK2 pathway 
in NLRP3 inflammasome priming. CDD-450 also inhibited other 
inflammatory pathways (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6), implying that 
potential indications for this drug candidate expand beyond 
inflammasopathies. These findings may have clinical implica-
tions because CDD-450 (a) is at least as efficacious as clinically 
evaluated global p38α inhibitors in suppressing inflammation 
in both animal disease models and patients’ cells, and (b) it 
offers the potential to avoid transient efficacy associated with 
global p38 inhibitors that may result from their inhibition of 
non-MK2 substrates involved in antiinflammatory and house-
keeping functions.
Materials and methods
Animals and inhibitors
Cre-ERTM (B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-cre/Esr1*)5Amc/J) mice and IL-1 
receptor–deficient (Il-1r−/−) mice were purchased from The 
Jackson Laboratory. Nlrp3fl(D301N)/+ mice have been previously 
described (Bonar et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017). Cre-ERTM mice 
and Nlrp3fl(D301N)/+ mice were crossed to generate Nlrp3fl(D301N)/+; 
Cre-ERTM mice and Cre-ERTM mice. Injection of tamoxifen 
(i.p.; 75 mg/kg body weight; Sigma-Aldrich) once every other 
day, three times per week for 2 wk to Nlrp3fl(D301N)/+;Cre-ERTM 
mice and Cre-ERTM mice yielded NOM 
IDc mice and control 
mice, respectively. NOM 
ID mice with constitutive activation 
of NLRP3 in myeloid cells driven by lysozyme M-Cre have been 
previously described (Wang et al., 2017). Caspase-1/11–defi-
cient mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All 
mice were on the C57BL/6 background for >10 generations, and 
mouse genotyping was performed by PCR. SCW arthritis in rats 
was induced as previously described (Mbalaviele et al., 2006). 
In brief, adult female Lewis rats (180 g) were injected i.p. with 
15 mg/kg, body weight, of the SCW preparation (BD). The acute

phase of the disease was monitored by measuring paw edema 
between days 2 and 8. On day 9, rats displaying paw edema 
were sorted into groups (8 rats/group) and then dosed with the 
inhibitors by oral gavage. Edema was monitored by measuring 
paw volume using a plethysmometer every other day until day 
21. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee of Washington University School of 
Medicine in St. Louis. CDD-450 is a proprietary inhibitor of 
Aclaris Therapeutics Inc. The IKK2 and MK2 inhibitors used in 
this study were reported as PHA-408 (Mbalaviele et al., 2009) 
and PF-3644022 (Mourey et al., 2010), respectively, whereas 
the two global p38 inhibitors used, CDD-111 and CDD-110, were 
reported as SD-0006 (Burnette et al., 2009) and PH-797804 
(Hope et al., 2009), respectively. CDD-110 was the racemate of 
PH-797804. All of these compounds were synthesized by Con-
fluence Discovery Technologies, Inc.

LPS endotoxemia
Adult male Lewis rats (200–220 g; five/group; Harlan Sprague 
Dawley) and adult female mice (18–20 g; Charles River Labs) 
were fasted for 18 h before oral dosing. Compounds were pre-
pared as fine aqueous suspensions in 0.5% methylcelluose and 
0.025% Tween-20 in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and administered 
by oral gavage in a volume of 0.5 ml for 1 h before intravenous 
injection of LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 for rats or 
Salmonella typhosa for mice; Sigma-Aldrich) at a dose of 1 mg/
kg (rats) or 0.025 mg/kg (mice) in 0.5 ml sterile saline (Bax-
ter Healthcare). Blood was collected in serum separator tubes 
via cardiac puncture 90 min (rats) or 60 min (mice) after LPS 
injection. Serum was stored at −20°C until TNF-α levels were 
determined using a Proinflammatory Panel 1 mouse kit (Meso-
Scale Diagnostics).
For IL-1β and IL-18 measurements in bone marrow, flushed 
bone marrow was centrifuged, and the supernatants were col-
lected as described previously (Bonar et al., 2012). IL-1β and IL-18 
levels were quantified using the eBioscience ELI 
SA kit and Meso-
Scale Diagnostics kit, respectively.
Peripheral blood analyses
Complete blood counts were performed by the Washing-
ton University School of Medicine Division of Comparative 
Medicine Diagnostic Laboratory as previously described 
(Wang et al., 2017).
Cell cultures
For all in vitro pharmacology experiments except otherwise 
specified, cells were pretreated with vehicle (0.5% DMSO, final 
concentration) or inhibitors (in 0.5% DMSO, final concentration) 
for 1 h before stimulation with the indicated ligand or ligands. 
Protein expression or phosphorylation was measured by ELI 
SA, 
Western blotting, or using MesoScale Diagnostics kits.
BMMs were obtained by culturing mouse bone marrow cells 
in culture media containing a 1:10 dilution of supernatant from 
the fibroblastic cell line CMG 14-12 as a source of macrophage 
colony–stimulating factor (Takeshita et al., 2000), a mitogenic 
factor for BMMs, for ∼5 d in a 10-cm dish as previously described 
(Alippe et al., 2017). Nonadherent cells were removed by vigorous 
washes with PBS, and adherent BMMs were detached with tryp-
sin-EDTA and cultured in culture media containing a 1:10 dilution 
of supernatant from the fibroblastic cell line CMG 14-12.
To activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, BMMs were plated at 
104 cells per well on a 96-well plate and maintained for 24 h in 
culture media containing a 1:10 dilution of CMG supernatant. 
Cells were pretreated with vehicle, CDD-450, or IKK2 inhibitor, 
followed by treatment with 100 ng/ml LPS or PBS without chang-
ing media for 3 h and then with 15 µM nigericin (AdipoGen) for 
30 min, and conditioned media were collected for IL-1β analysis.
For osteoclast formation, BMM were plated at 5 × 103 cells per 
well in a 96-well plate in culture media containing a 1:50 dilution 
of CMG and 100 ng/ml receptor activator of NF-ҡB ligand (RAN 
KL), a required cytokine for osteoclast differentiation. Media 
with supplements were changed every other day and maintained 
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Synovial fibroblasts from RA tissues were obtained as previ-
ously described (Mbalaviele et al., 2009). Human PBMCs were 
isolated from a CAPS patient or healthy control following proce-
dures approved by Ethics Committees of the University of Cali-
fornia, San Diego, and Washington University School of Medi-
cine in St. Louis.
Human whole blood obtained from healthy human volunteers 
was preincubated with vehicle or various concentrations of CDD-
450 before treatment with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 
4 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Samples were centrifuged at 1,800 g for 
5 min, and then supernatants were harvested and assayed for 
TNF-α production.
Rat whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into hepa-
rin vacutainer tubes and centrifuged to obtain plasma, which was 
used to measure TNF-α levels.
Human premonocytic cells (U937; ATCC) grown in RPMI 
1640 containing 10% FBS (Gibco) were induced to differentiate 
into macrophages upon treatment with 20 ng/ml PMA (Sig-
ma-Aldrich) for 24 h. Cells were then pretreated with vehicle 
or CDD-450 before stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Al-
drich) for 4 h. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were measured in 
conditioned media.

Histology
Tissue samples were processed as described previously (Wang et 
al., 2017). In brief, long bones were fixed in 10% formalin, decal-
cified in 14% (wt/vol) EDTA, pH 7.2, for 10–14 d at room tempera-
ture, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5-µm thicknesses, and 
mounted on glass slides. The sections were stained with H&E and 
tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) as described previ-
ously (Wang et al., 2017). Photographs were taken using NanoZo-
omer (Hamamatsu Photonics).
Bone mass and microstructure
Hind paws obtained from Lewis female rats were analyzed at day 
21 by µCT system (vivaCT 40; Scanco Medical AG) as previously 
described (Mbalaviele et al., 2006).
TRAP staining
Cytochemical staining for TRAP was used to identify osteoclasts 
as described previously (Alippe et al., 2017). In brief, cells on a 
96-well plate were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.1% Triton 
X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with 
water and incubated with the TRAP staining solution (leukocyte 
acid phosphatase kit; Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 30 
min. Under light microscopy, multinuclear TRAP-positive cells 
with ≥3 nuclei were scored as osteoclasts.
mRNA expression analysis
Total RNA was harvested from cultured cells using the Pure-
Link RNA mini kit (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was then 
synthesized with the iScript reverse transcription kit (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories) and quantified using primers listed in Table S1. 
Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using 
the SYBR green gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems). To 
study mRNA stability, cells were treated with PBS, 100 ng/ml LPS, 
or 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 3 h and then exposed to 1 µg/ml actinomycin 
D (Sigma-Aldrich) to block RNA synthesis and/or CDD-450, IKK2 
inhibitor, or MK2 inhibitor, and cells were lysed 0, 2, 4, or 6 h 
later. Total RNA was extracted, and then the rates of IL-1β, IL-6, 
NLRP3, and TNF-α mRNA decay were monitored by qPCR.
Western blot analysis
Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with RIPA buffer 
(50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NaDOAc, 0.1% SDS, 
and 1.0% NP-40) plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors (2 mM 
NaVO4, 10 mM NaF, and 1 mM PMSF) and cOmplete protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). For tissue extracts, liver tissues were 
homogenized and lysed with RIPA buffer containing phosphatase 
and protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined 
by the Bio-Rad Laboratories method, and equal amounts of pro-
teins were subjected to SDS-PAGE gels (12%). Proteins were trans-
ferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with p-MK2 
(Thr334), MK2, p-p38α, p38α antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling 
Technologies), NLRP3 antibody (AdipoGen), pro–caspase-1, or 
β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight at 
4°C followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary goat anti–mouse 
IRDye 800 (Rockland) or goat anti–rabbit Alexa Fluor 680 (Molec-
ular Probes), respectively. The results were visualized using the 
Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Microscopic analysis of active caspase-1
BMM were plated at 5 × 104 cells per well on a 96-well plate and 
maintained for 24 h in culture media. They were primed with 
100 ng/ml LPS for 3 h and treated with 10 µM CDD-450 and/or 
15 µM nigericin for 30 min. Cells were incubated with the FLI 
CA 
FAM-YVAD-FMK probe (ImmunoChemistry Technologies) for 
30 min at 37°C, washed twice with PBS/FBS, and fixed with 10% 
buffered formalin. Cells were then counterstained with Fluoro 
gel II containing DAPI (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Images 
were taken with a DP70 Olympus digital camera coupled with 
an IX51 Olympus inverted microscope, captured with QCapture 
Pro software (QImaging), and analyzed with ImageJ software 
(National Institutes of Health).
p38α–MK2, p38α–PRAK, and p38α–ATF2 assays
Inactive p38α (2 µM) was incubated with MgATP (200 µM) and 
constitutively active MKK6 (40 nM) in buffer containing 25 mM 
Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% BSA, and 
1 mM DTT for 2 h at room temperature. p38α activity (60 pM, 
final concentration) toward nonphosphorylated GST-MK2 (1 nM, 
final concentration) or nonphosphorylated GST-PRAK (10 nM, 
final concentration) was determined by measuring MK2 or PRAK 
kinase activity via phosphorylation of a fluorescently labeled 
HSP27 peptide (FITC KKK 
ALS 
RQL 
SVAA). HSP27 peptide sub-
strate and MgATP were held constant at 1 µM and 10 µM, respec-
tively. HSP27 phosphorylation was quantified using IMAP assay 
technology (Molecular Devices) and the Analyst HT plate reader 
(Surplus Solutions LLC) using standard fluorescence polariza-
tion settings. ATF2 and MgATP were held constant at 100 nM 
and 4 µM, respectively, and incubated with p38α (62.5 pM, final 
concentration) at room temperature to measure ATF2 phosphor-
ylation. Phosphorylated ATF2 was measured using the MesoScale 
Diagnostics kit. Inhibitor potency was calculated by fitting dose–
response data to the four-parameter logistical IC50 equation.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
All reactions were performed at room temperature. The CM5 
sensor chip was prepared using standard Biacore methodology. 
In brief, after docking and priming with distilled water using the 
QUI 
CKI 
NJE 
CT command, the CM5 surface was subjected to two 
consecutive 20-µl pulses each of 50 mM NaOH, 10 mM HCl, 0.1% 
SDS, and 0.085% H3PO4 at a flow of 100 µl/min. Afterward, the 
integrated microfluidic cartridge was washed and primed with 
running buffer. To activate the CM5 surface, 400 mM 1-eth-
yl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and 
100 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide (GE Healthcare) were mixed 
50:50, and the mixture was injected for 7 min (35 µl) at a flow rate 
of 5 µl/min. Next, the anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare) was 
diluted in 10 mM NaOAc and injected over the desired flow cell. 
This was then followed by a 7-min (35 µl) injection of ethanol-
amine. For amine coupling and testing of inhibitors, the running 
buffer consisted of 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Tris (2-car-
boxyethyl) phosphine HCl, and 0.005% Tween-20. The running 
buffer was filtered (0.45 µm) and degassed at 25°C before use.
GST-MK2 (EMD Millipore) was captured with the amine-cou-
pled anti-GST antibody for 2 min. Afterward, recombinant p38α 
(10 nM; Invitrogen) was injected in the presence or absence of

way ANO 
VA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, or two-way 
ANO 
VA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test as well as the 
Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test for comparison of survival curves in 
Prism (6.0; GraphPad Software).
