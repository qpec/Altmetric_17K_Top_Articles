Flaviviruses continue to cause globally relevant epidemics and have emerged or re-emerged
in regions that were previously unaffected. Factors determining emergence of flaviviruses and
continuing circulation in sylvatic cycles are incompletely understood. Here we identify
potential sylvatic reservoirs of flaviviruses and characterize the macro-ecological traits
common to known wildlife hosts to predict the risk of sylvatic flavivirus transmission among
wildlife and identify regions that could be vulnerable to outbreaks. We evaluate variability in
wildlife hosts for zoonotic flaviviruses and find that flaviviruses group together in distinct
clusters with similar hosts. Models incorporating ecological and climatic variables as well as
life history traits shared by flaviviruses predict new host species with similar host char-
acteristics. The combination of vector distribution data with models for flavivirus hosts allows
for prediction of global vulnerability to flaviviruses and provides potential targets for disease
surveillance in animals and humans.

 T
he recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) across South
America and the spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in
North America in the early 2000s reflect the increasing
public health risk and pandemic potential posed by flaviviruses
globally1. Flaviviruses are transmitted among a wide variety of
mammalian and avian hosts, with sylvatic cycles that perpetuate
new outbreaks through spillover into humans and hinder disease
prevention and control efforts. Migratory birds are hypothesized
to have spread WNV in temperate areas of the Old and New
World, and human WNV outbreaks in North America have been
associated with corresponding WNV outbreaks in wild birds2,3.
Flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) have well-recognized sylvatic cycles that
maintain viral circulation in wild reservoirs between outbreaks in
human populations4. Therefore, improved understanding of the
potential wildlife host involvement in the transmission of emer-
ging flaviviruses is essential. For instance, data about the trans-
mission of ZIKV in South American wildlife are critical to inform
on maintenance of the virus in the region, as sylvatic hosts can
serve as a source of recurring epidemics and impede efforts for
long-term disease prevention5.
Surveillance programs which aim to identify sylvatic hosts of
viral diseases face many logistical hurdles, including accessing
wild species that often reside in remote habitats and procuring
large numbers of high-quality samples for virus detection.
However, recognition of wildlife hosts for zoonotic pathogens is
important for evaluating pathogen evolution within wildlife
reservoir populations, advancing early detection of outbreaks
through identification of sentinel species, mitigating risk at
animal–human interfaces, and monitoring threats that zoonotic
pathogens might pose to wildlife6. When compared to viruses
with a limited host range, zoonotic viruses with high host plas-
ticity are more likely to spread after spillover by secondary
human-to-human transmission and are known to have greater
geographic spread7. While vector-borne viruses have greater host
plasticity in general7, members of the flavivirus genus demon-
strate a varying propensity towards host range; some infect spe-
cies within a narrow range of taxonomic relatedness while others
infect a wide range of vertebrate taxa4.
In addition to viral traits8, host and environmental factors such
as the ecological niche of reservoir hosts, host interactions with
potential vectors, and seasonal and climatic conditions play a
significant role in sustaining viral persistence and evolution in
sylvatic host populations9. Identifying macro-ecological patterns
that facilitate viral persistence is crucial for understanding global
variation in prevalence and propensity of flavivirus for epide-
miologically important sylvatic cycles. Here, we collect data from
published reports of non-human vertebrate hosts for thirty-five
zoonotic flaviviruses (66% of the species within the genus Flavi-
virus10) known to cause human infection and associated with at
least one non-human vertebrate host. We characterize the
environmental and life history traits of known flavivirus hosts
and identify new hosts whose trait profiles indicate a high
probability for harboring flaviviruses. Our results identify regions
with a high number of potential flavivirus hosts and vulnerability
to sylvatic transmission.
Results
Mammalian and avian hosts of Flaviviruses. Among thirty-five
zoonotic flaviviruses, we identified thirty flaviviruses with non-
human vertebrate hosts reported with natural flavivirus infection
confirmed by either virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), or plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). We
detected 140 mammals (out of 5,536 mammal species11) and 277
avian species (out of 10,424 avian species12) as recognized hosts
for flaviviruses. Flaviviruses were found to have an average of 18.9
hosts with a median of 4 hosts. Taken together, flaviviruses had a
wide range of propensity for host plasticity based on diversity of
species discovered to date, ranging from four flaviviruses (Bou-
boui virus, Cacipacore virus, Iguape virus, and Koutango virus)
with only one host species, to WNV with a maximum of 194 host
species recognized to date (Table 1, Supplementary Data file 1).
Cluster analyses of zoonotic flaviviruses revealed multiple pro-
minent clusters of viruses which share hosts from similar tax-
onomical
orders.
Group
1
viruses
(ZIKV,
YFV)
were
predominantly found in primate hosts. Group 2 viruses, which
included WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Usutu virus
(USUV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), were found in
a variety of birds and mammalian orders. Lastly, Group 3 viruses
included Rio Bravo virus (RBV), Dakar bat virus (DBV), and
Entebbe bat virus (ENTV) that were exclusive to bats. Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV) did not cluster
with any other flaviviruses (Fig. 1).
Macroecological traits of flaviviral hosts. We constructed a
generic model using the generalized boosted regression tree
method for all flaviviruses and developed three stratified models
based on virus cluster Groups 1, 2, and 3 and independent models
for TBEV, JEV, and DENV to predict if a species is a flaviviruses
host (or host of one of the viruses from the groups). Although
TBEV shared hosts similar to WNV, SLEV, and USUV, it was
modeled separately as it is transmitted by ticks while the other
viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes. The optimal number of
recursive trees where the holdout deviance was minimized in our
models varied from 1,250 to 11,200 trees. Details of the number

 of trees, cross-validation AUC, and holdout AUC are shown in
Supplementary Table 1.
The generic model for all flaviviruses revealed the relative
importance of 29 host traits related to host ecology, conservation
status, physiology, geographical distribution, vector distribution,
climatic
variables,
anthropogenic
variables,
and
bird
and
mammalian diversity within the host range that influenced the
probability of mammalian and avian species hosting flaviviruses,
with a cross-validation AUC of 0.906 (Supplementary Table 1).
The variable describing the northernmost latitude of host species
distribution (northernmost bound), showed the highest relative
influence for this generic model followed by the geographical
range of the species (log distribution area km2). The number of
PubMed hits for species was used to control for sampling effort
and reporting bias, was found to be the third most important
variable. When the generic model was run both including and
excluding number of PubMed hits, nine out of the top ten
variables were retained as significant, indicating that although
some species are well-studied, sampling effort did not substan-
tially bias the overall results and interpretation for important
macro-ecological traits of flavivirus hosts. With the exclusion of
number of PubMed hits, westernmost bound of species distribu-
tion, metabolic rate, and body mass gained relative variable
importance and rank, while the variables related to species
population trend and latitude of species distribution centroid
went down in the ranking. Southernmost bound was the new
variable introduced into the top ten variables, which was
otherwise ranked 12th for the generic model (Supplementary
Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Data file 2).
The trait profile of flavivirus-positive hosts indicated that hosts
tend to have a wider geographic range, reside in more isothermal
regions (between latitudes of 10°N–40°N) compared to non-host
species, and have range distributions centered in subtropical
regions, (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3).
In addition to northernmost latitude bound, southernmost and
westernmost longitude bounds of host distribution were also
found to be influential in multiple models. Host body mass (g)
and metabolic rate for flavivirus host species showed a bimodal
pattern, and species with scavenging habits showed a greater
likelihood of hosting flaviviruses. The family Atelidae (New
World monkeys, including howler, spider, woolly, and woolly
spider monkeys) showed the highest relative influence for hosting
flaviviruses compared to other families with respect to its
influence on overall model predictions (Supplementary Data
file 2). Additionally, an increase in the relative probability of a
group of mosquitos and ticks within the host distribution range
(12th and 14th influential variables respectively), was associated
with higher probability of mammalian and bird species hosting
flaviviruses (Supplementary Data file 2, Supplementary Figure 4).
Results of the generic model were heavily influenced by a large
number of avian hosts reported for WNV, SLEV, and USUV.
Overall, the geographical range of the species, host body mass (g),
and the number of PubMed hits for the hosts were among the top
ten most influential variables in all independent and virus group
models (Fig. 2).
Model for YFV and ZIKV (Group 1 model) revealed the
influence of all 29 host traits had on hosting Group 1 viruses
and did not detect any taxonomical clustering within Primates.
Hosts for YFV and ZIKV from orders Primates and Rodentia
were heavier in mass, had higher metabolic rates, and had a
wider distribution area with higher annual precipitation within
their geographical distribution than non-host species (Supple-
mentary Figure 5). Critically endangered Primate species were
more likely to be hosts for Group 1 viruses than species with
other IUCN Red list classification status (Supplementary
Figure 5).
The predictive model for Group 2 viruses (WNV, SLEV,
USUV) primarily found in avian hosts showed that species
positive for these viruses had similar geographic distribution, with
five out of the top ten variables related to geographic distribution
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 6). Host species had larger
distribution areas generally centered around the Nearctic region
compared to non-host species. Species were clustered in the avian
families Accipitridae, Mimidae, and Columbidae which had the
highest
relative
influence
compared
to
all
other
families
(Supplementary Data file 2).

 Within Chiroptera, species positive for bat-specific flaviviruses
RBV, ENTV, and DBV (Group 3) were found to be heavier in
weight and residing in regions with higher human density (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Figure 7). Model results for TBEV showed that
body mass and diet preference influenced the likelihood of being
a host for TBEV. Likelihood of being a host for TBEV was also
influenced by anthropogenic factors, such land use type and
density of livestock
within the host
distribution (Fig.
2,
Supplementary Figure 8). Body mass of species showed a bimodal
pattern for its partial dependence on the likelihood of being
DENV hosts. DENV hosts were found to be living in areas with
higher mammalian and avian diversity and with a high
probability of mosquito presence (Supplementary Figure 9).
JEV hosts were found in regions with higher human population
density and in species that had a higher metabolic rate than non-
host species (Supplementary Figure 10).
Identification and distribution of novel flaviviral hosts. Virus
group and independent virus-specific models were used to predict
probabilities for species to host flaviviruses, given data on known
hosts and their respective ecological traits. Known hosts for each
modeled zoonotic flavivirus, along with model-based predicted
probabilities are shown in Supplementary Data file 3. The pre-
dicted probabilities for species for all the models were not highly
correlated with any of the geographical traits of species indicating
that model predictions were not geographically biased towards any
regions of human outbreaks (Supplementary Figure 11). Out of
112 predicted host species (top 5% of species) for YFV and ZIKV
(Group 1), 21 were primate species. These species on an average
had 20% probability (SD = 17.0) for being a host for YFV and
ZIKV. Nine of the 21 primate species predicted have not yet been
detected with Group 1 viruses by confirmatory tests such as virus
isolation, PCR, or validated serology (PRNT). Among the nine
predicted new hosts, only the Guinea baboon (Papio papio) has
had YFV previously detected by serology (Supplementary Data
file 3)13. Species from Rodentia (4% mean probability, SD = 6.3,
n = 97) showed significantly lower probabilities for being YFV and
ZIKV hosts compared to Primates (Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon
P < 0.005, Supplementary Figure 12). The geographical ranges of
predicted host species for Group 1 viruses were more widely dis-
tributed than the geographical ranges of serologically-confirmed
and antigenically-confirmed positive species and showed a higher
host diversity in Africa, Asia, and South America (Fig. 3). Areas in
North America and Europe indicate the distributions of predicted
rodent species as hosts for YFV and ZIKV, but rodent species had
very low probabilities, compared to primate species in other
regions. When geographical distributions of species were weighted
by model-predicted YFV and ZIKV host probability values, the
probability map showed hotspots with high probabilities for YFV
and ZIKV sylvatic hosts in South Asia and mid-eastern Africa
(South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia), and a small hotspot
in the eastern coast of South America (Fig. 4).
The model predicted a total of 708 novel hosts for WNV,
SLEV, and USUV, which have 254 currently recognized hosts

 (WNV = 194 hosts, SLEV = 72 hosts, and USUV = 65 hosts).
Only species from the order Charadriiformes (12% mean
probability, SD = 10.0, n = 95) showed a significantly different
probability of hosting Group 2 viruses than species from the
order Accipitriformes (39% mean probability, SD = 31.0, n = 40,
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.005) and
species
from
Strigiformes
(38%,
SD = 29.7,
n = 19,
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.01, Supple-
mentary Figure 12). Orders that showed high predicted mean
probabilities for being hosts for WNV, SLEV, or USUV were
Cathartiformes (56%, SD = 36.4, n = 4), and Columbiformes
(34%, SD = 28.7, n = 13). Of non-avian species, Equus ferus
(order Perissodactyla) was in the top 5% of predicted hosts, with a
probability of 8% for being a host for Group 2 viruses. None of
the primates species were in the top 5% of predicted species
even though Macaca sylvanus is a known host for WNV14,15 and
Ateles paniscus, and Sapajus apella have been detected positive for
SLEV15,16 (Supplementary Data file 3). Overall, two regions,
North America and central Europe, showed high species richness
of predicted hosts (including correctly identified known hosts) of
Group 2 viruses compared to other regions (Figs. 3, 4). When the
model for WNV, SLEV, and USUV was run by relabeling species
as positive only when they were found positive by PCR or virus
isolation, the model predicted higher mean probabilities for
species from the orders Accipitriformes, Anseriformes, Carnivora,
Charadriiformes,
Galliformes,
Passeriformes,
and
Rodentia
(Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05). The
changes in the probabilities were due to changed number of
Orders included in the modeling procedure as some orders
dropped out from the model as they only had species positive by
PRNT (Supplementary Table 2). Predicted species in the alternate
model with species confirmed only by PCR or virus isolation,
revealed hotspots in the same geographical region of North
America (Supplementary Figure 13).
The model for TBEV predicted 494 hosts in addition to the
already recognized 75 hosts for this virus (Supplementary Data
file 3). Only species from the order Passeriformes (19% mean
probability, SD = 27.6, n = 156) showed a significantly higher
probability of hosting TBEV than species from order Charadrii-
formes
(4%
mean
probability,
SD = 13.0,
n = 75,
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.04, Supple-
mentary Figure 12). Mean probabilities for other Orders were not
significantly different from each other (Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon
Bonferroni-adjusted P > 0.05, Supplementary Figure 12). The
geographical distribution of these species showed high species
diversity clusters across Europe and Russia (Fig. 3), with similar
hotspots when geographical distributions were weighted for the
predicted host probabilities (Fig. 4).
Results for the Group 3 (RBV, ENTV, and DBV) model
indicated that top 5% of species with the highest predicted
probabilities included 42 bat species that have not yet been
detected positive for Group 3 flaviviruses. Mean predicted
probabilities for hosting Group 3 viruses for families within
Chiroptera were not significantly different from each other
(Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon Bonferroni-adjusted P > 0.05), but
leaf-nosed bat species (Phyllostomidae) had the highest mean
probability of 26% (SD = 24.2, n = 10, Supplementary Figure 12).
Additionally, model results showed two geographical clusters
with high predicted host diversity: one extending across central
sub-Saharan Africa to the southeastern coast of Africa, and the
second encompassing the Neotropic region and Central Americas
(Figs. 3, 4).
The model for DENV predicted 173 host species, of which 139
are new, potentially unrecognized host species. The average
probability for being a host for DENV among species in orders
Didelphimorphia (mean = 18%, SD = 26.4, n = 16), Chiroptera
(mean = 9%, SD = 14.2, n = 75), Rodentia (mean = 6%, SD =
11.3, n = 53), Primates (mean = 5%, SD = 2.9, n = 12), and
Perissodactyla (mean = 3%, SD = 0.9, n = 13,) were not statisti-
cally different from each other (Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon
Bonferroni-adjusted P > 0.05, Supplementary Figure 12). Pre-
dicted species for DENV showed high, combined host species
richness in the neotropical region stretching from the Central
American tropics in the north to the northern Bolivian and
Paraguayan regions in the south, covering all of Brazil (Figs. 3, 4).
The JEV model predicted 408 host species, of which 388 would be
new hosts. Their distribution showed high species richness in
Southeast Asia, central Europe, and Australia (Figs. 3,
4). Order
Cetartiodactyla (mean = 3%, SD = 7.0, n = 45,) showed significantly
higher average mean predicted probabilities than Passeriformes

Discussion
The recent expansion of diseases such as ZIKV into Asia-Pacific
regions and the Americas in 201617, WNV in North America in
19992, and the persistent global disease burden caused by YFV,
DENV, and JEV18, emphasize the need to identify animal species
capable of hosting flaviviruses and perpetuating human cases by
sylvatic transmission. We evaluate current knowledge of host
species to enhance prediction of potential new sylvatic hosts of
flaviviruses in order to address important gaps in current
knowledge based solely on wildlife surveillance efforts. Models
highlight important features of sylvatic hosts and the macro-
ecological factors underlying variation in the propensity of fla-
viviruses to infect certain vertebrate species. Regions highlighted
with a high number of predicted wildlife hosts have heightened
risk of spillover of flaviviruses because we suspect there is a higher
likelihood of suitable sylvatic hosts that could maintain the virus
in nature. These maps can be used to guide surveillance efforts in
the event of an outbreak to verify wild reservoir species and
obtain needed data on epidemiological factors related to trans-
mission of viruses within host species and animal–human inter-
faces and/or vectors involved in transmission. Hierarchical
clusters of flaviviruses based on similarity in host propensity
resulted in groups which are part of the same flavivirus sero-
complexes. For example, RBV and DBV are part of the Rio Bravo
virus group, and WNV, USUV, and SLEV are part of the Japanese
encephalitis virus group. Hence, while the clusters are comprised
of viruses that are known to be phylogenetically similar, we
demonstrate their ecological similarities as well. Whereas pre-
vious studies have used similar machine learning approaches to
predict novel hosts for a single taxa group19,20, our modeling
approach enabled evaluation of macro-ecological patterns shared
by viruses from ecologically diverse viral genus across all mammal
and bird species.
Life history traits such as host body mass and metabolic rates
were influential in models for multiple flavivirus groups. Hosts
with higher metabolic rates, especially bats and rodents that
generally have a more fast-paced life history strategy, have been
associated with a propensity to host a higher number of zoonotic
agents including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa19,20. It has been
hypothesized that the cost of a fast-paced life history reduces
investments in the development of innate immunity, allowing
species to host more pathogens21. Higher body temperature and
metabolic rates of bats are also hypothesized to aid the ability of
these species to host a wide range of pathogenic infections22. Our
models indicate a similar trend among flaviviruses hosts, espe-
cially for YFV, ZIKV, and JEV. For all stratified models, flavivirus
hosts had heavier weight than non-host vertebrate species. Even
though taxonomical orders showed variation in the mean pre-
dicted probabilities, none of the taxonomical orders were found
to have significantly higher probabilities for hosting flaviviruses in
stratified models, except for primates which were found to have a
significantly higher probability as YFV and ZIKV hosts. Life
history traits and host ecology were more related to the sus-
ceptibility of species to flavivirus infection and could play an
important role in the coevolution of hosts and flaviviruses.
Most flaviviruses are critically dependent on climatic condi-
tions favoring recruitment and dispersal of their vectors and are
likely to emerge or re-emerge in new areas due to projected cli-
mate change23,24. Travel of infected people and vectors has also
enabled the emergence and re-emergence of flaviviruses in
regions with suitable climate and vector distribution. The pre-
sence of a large number of susceptible hosts, as well as an increase
in suitable environmental conditions related to climate change,
could allow vectors to thrive and aid in establishing sylvatic cycles
in newly predicted regions24. Our analyses indicate areas at
increased risk of sustained sylvatic transmission with the ecolo-
gical ingredients that could favor flavivirus transmission, even in
previously naïve regions. Results indicate a heightened risk of
establishing sylvatic cycles of JEV in Europe and southern Aus-
tralia, where host species with potential to maintain viral

 circulation exist. Similarly, predicted host species in Southeast
Asia could facilitate establishment of sylvatic cycles of YFV and
ZIKV. Therefore, these regions with high host diversity should
inform on future flavivirus surveillance and outbreak prepared-
ness. Historically, YFV successfully spilled back into sylvatic cycle
in South America after its introduction in the 17th and 18th
centuries25. On the other hand, established sylvatic cycles of
DENV has not yet been detected despite the endemicity of this
virus in South America. For emerging flaviviruses such as ZIKV,
there is growing concern for the establishment of sylvatic cycles
due to spillback transmission from humans to wildlife in geo-
graphical regions predicted with high ZIKV host diversity26.
Maintenance of these viruses in non-vertebrate hosts pose a great
hurdle for disease control efforts, where public health measures
such as vaccines could control disease transmission in urban
settings, but sylvatic cycles could continue to be a source of
spillover to populations in rural areas26. Moreover, sylvatic cir-
culation of flaviviruses could alter primate population dynamics
and contribute to extinction risks in vulnerable primate popula-
tions as has been evident for YFV-related primate declines in
South America with outbreaks that have decimated populations
of howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.)27.
Macro-ecological traits related to the geographical distribution
of potential hosts of flaviviruses were highlighted in all models.
Species in tropical and subtropical regions showed an overall
trend of higher likelihood for hosting flaviviruses due to which
hotspots of higher host richness for JEV, DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and
for bat-specific flaviviruses were seen across tropical regions of
Southeast Asia, South America and Africa. These regions are
biodiverse and coincide with high human density, recent urba-
nization, conversion of land for agriculture, and deforestation—
all of which can lead to increase in frequency of contact between
humans and wildlife, thus increasing chances of viral spillover to
humans28. Geographical features such as the distribution area of
species have been previously found to be important in deter-
mining the likelihood of rodent and bat species carrying zoonotic
agents19,20. Species with widespread distributions include com-
monly found peri-urban species, which have frequent interactions
with
humans
that
can
lead
to
spillover
at
high-risk
animal–human
transmission interfaces.
The significance of
wider geographical distribution area, human population and
livestock density, and land use patterns may indicate a general-
ized host trait pattern towards synanthropic species.
Following the first discovery of ZIKV in 1947 in a sentinel
rhesus macaque in Uganda29, efforts to recognize potential nat-
ural wildlife reservoirs for ZIKV have been limited. As of 2017,
the World Health Organization categorizes Southeast Asia as a
region with active human transmission of ZIKV. However, evi-
dence of ZIKV in Southeast Asian primates to date is limited to
detection of exposure in Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus)
from Eastern Sabah, Malaysia in 1996–199830,31. Our model
results predict additional host candidates, Macaca fascicularis,
and Macaca nemestrina, which should be evaluated further for
their potential to maintain ZIKV and their ability to pose ongoing
spillover risk to humans.
Human cases of yellow fever have never been reported in Asia,
but the potential for an outbreak with sylvatic maintenance YFV
exists, as appropriate vectors are present if the virus is intro-
duced32. Moreover, our models identified species with a high
probability for hosting both YFV and ZIKV in South Asia,
including three primate species (Fig. 3). Among these is the
widely distributed Macaca mulatta, commonly used as an animal
model in laboratory experiments29. Another species with a high
probability for hosting YFV and ZIKV in this region is the
gray langur (Semnopithecus entellus), which has yet to be found
positive for either YFV or ZIKV. To date, evidence for ZIKV in
wildlife in South Asia is limited to serological detection (com-
plement fixation test) in three rodent species, the bandicoot rat
(Bandicota bengalensis), Indian gerbil (Tatera indica), and Indian
desert gerbil (Meriones hurrianae)33. However, recent detection
of human cases with a local strain of ZIKV indicates there is
sustained transmission of the virus within the region34, empha-
sizing a need for wildlife surveillance in this region.
The geographical distribution of predicted host probabilities
for YFV and ZIKV in South America indicate lower probabilities
within the Amazonian rainforests and higher probabilities around
the forest perimeter. Suitability risk maps for human outbreaks of
YFV are also known to follow a similar geographical distribu-
tion35, indicating comparable risk for both humans and wildlife
and intermingling of the sylvatic cycle with the urban cycle of
YFV. Species in this region with high probabilities for hosting
YFV and ZIKV include several species of howler monkeys
(Alouatta caraya, Alouatta gauriba, and Alouatta sara). These
species are known to be sentinels for YFV outbreaks, as popu-
lations of these species often suffer die-offs due to YFV infection
in advance of detection in nearby human populations6,27. Our
model also predicts a howler monkey species in Central America,
Alouatta pigra, which has not yet been detected positive with YFV
or ZIKV. South and Central America, which have active con-
current ZIKV and YFV transmission, should be a focus for fur-
ther investigation to understand the potential conservation
implications of co-circulation of both YFV and ZIKV in these
susceptible primate populations.
The Group 2 model indicated two regions of high host diver-
sity for WNV, USUV, and SLEV, in North America and in
Central Europe (Figs. 3, 4). After the introduction of WNV in
North America, the virus caused high mortality in corvids and
has been documented to cause significant reductions in the
populations of other passerines36,37. Species with high probability
for hosting Group 2 viruses include five corvid species from
North America and the critically endangered Californian condor
(Cathartidae family). Certain species, especially Accipitriformes
and Anseriformes, are expected to be important in maintaining
and spreading Group 2 viruses via migration.
Competent reservoirs for TBEV are known to be small forest
mammals, insectivores, and livestock species, but the role of
passerines and their ticks in the transmission of the infection is
not well understood, even though multiple species have been
detected positive38. Louping-ill virus (LIV), which is known to be
highly homologous39 and shares similar biogeography to TBEV,
was also found to share similar mammalian hosts (LIV has been
detected in only one bird species, Lagopus lagopus)38. The geo-
graphical distribution of potential hosts for bat flaviviruses (RBV,
ENTV, and DBV) when compared to predicted bat hosts for
filoviruses shows similar hotspots in central Africa, but varying
distribution in Southeast Asia19. Along with being restricted to
bats, these three viruses do not have any recognized vector to
date.
Dengue virus is known to have a distinct sylvatic cycle and has
been detected in sentinel primate species40. To date, DENV has
been detected via confirmatory tests (PRNT, PCR, or virus iso-
lation) only in macaques (Macaca nemestrina) in Thailand41.
The model for DENV identified eleven new Primate hosts out of
which only Macaca fascicularis42 and Pongo pygmaeus30 have
been previously detected serologically positive. Other instances of
detection of DENV in primates are limited to Old World mon-
keys by serological tests with poor specificity to DENV (Chlor-
ocebus
sabaeus,
Erythrocebus
patas42,
Presbytis
melalophos,
Trachypithecus cristatus43, and Macaca sinica44). Our model
results indicate that marsupials (Didelphidae family) and bats
from families Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, Molossidae, and

 Americas while in Asia results point towards bats as likely hosts.
Field studies are needed to elucidate the potential roles for pri-
mates and bats in the transmission and maintenance of DENV,
especially in Asia.
Japanese encephalitis virus has been circulating endemically in
Eastern and Southeastern Asia. We identified potential passerine
hosts from regions in Southeast Asia and Europe. The high
probability regions in the Indian subcontinent predicted in this
study coincide with regions known to have reported cases of
JEV45. Concern for the establishment of a JEV endemic cycle in
Europe is rising due to the introduction of this virus by move-
ment of people and the increasing suitability of the climate to
sustain vectors, especially given the detection of JEV in a Culex
pipiens mosquito in northern Italy46. Based on our predictions,
potential host species that could sustain JEV transmission exist in
Europe, including some of the most common passerines, such as
the Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) and the Carrion Crow
(Corvus corone).
Results presented here highlight significantly important species
and regions of the world that should be prioritized for sylvatic
surveillance of flaviviruses. Surveillance targets should be con-
sidered for their role as reservoir, amplifying, or dead-end hosts,
as well as their ability to produce a level of viremia that is likely to
propagate transmission. For example, WNV cases in humans are
associated with the proliferation of virus in avian amplification
hosts, but not with infected equines or humans because the latter
two species produce little viremia47. Similarly, vectors and eco-
logical conditions that are likely to facilitate transmission to
humans will greatly impact the propensity of predicted species in
hotspot regions to perpetuate sylvatic cycles. The host diversity
hotspots shown here include both the wintering and breeding
grounds of migratory birds, especially in case of WNV, SLEV, and
USUV which inlcude temperate regions that are not likely to
favor year round transmission because of reduced abundance of
vectors and shorter summer seasons. Even with well-informed
targets for surveillance, field-based detection of flaviviruses in
wild animal hosts requires a large-scale effort with a low prob-
ability of detecting positives, especially given the very short
duration of infection for most flaviviruses. Sero-surveys, which
are becoming increasingly specific, have been used to detect
positive animals during ongoing outbreaks (e.g., of 4–6% for
WNV in wild birds47). Detection of YFV in animals is often
triggered by mortality events in New World monkeys27,48. Aside
from outbreak investigations, comprehensive longitudinal sam-
pling efforts for sylvatic host detection has been uncommon due
to logistical hurdles.
We demonstrate that macroecological host traits can be used to
predict undiscovered hosts of zoonotic viruses over diverse ver-
tebrate taxa including birds and mammals. Our analyses identi-
fied potential regions with high host diversity that could be
prioritized for flavivirus surveillance, and we were able to narrow
down avian and mammalian targets with potentially important
roles in sylvatic transmission. Large-scale ecological and climate
changes will lead to shifts in the distribution of both hosts and
vectors, with direct implications for spillover risk of flaviviruses
from host species. As global surveillance efforts continue to
generate more data on the distribution of wildlife hosts and as
new hosts are discovered, the modeling framework presented here
can be used to anticipate regions with flavivirus emergence vul-
nerability and better inform on the impact of sylvatic transmis-
sion on global health.
Methods
Datasets. A list of known viruses from the Flavivirus genus was generated using
the NCBI taxonomy database49 and the 2016 taxonomy report of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)10,50. A systematic literature review of
peer-reviewed articles published through September 2016 was completed using
PubMed taxonomy IDs to collect data on all vertebrate hosts of thirty-five zoonotic
flaviviruses covering two-thirds of all viruses in the genus Flavivirus10 globally. We
assumed a flavivirus to be zoonotic if it was known to be reported in humans as
well as in a non-human vertebrate host, despite the absence of specific evidence of
transmission from animals to humans. Similarly, GenBank entries were down-
loaded and used to search for hosts51. Other databases such as Global Infectious
Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON)52, the Centers for Disease Control
Arbovirus catalog53, the World Animal Health Information System OIE, the World
Health Organization, ProMED54, and the virus pathogen database and analysis
resource (ViPR)55, were also queried.
Experimental infections of animals in laboratory settings were excluded to
collect data only on hosts of flaviviruses which can get infected via natural
infection. For all flaviviruses, positive serological detection except with the plaque
reduction neutralization test (PRNT) in a host was not considered conclusive, due
to poor test specificity and cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Such hosts were
classified as “suspected hosts” unless serologic detection was followed by a
confirmatory test. Detection of a virus by virus isolation, molecular assay (PCR), or
plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) was considered confirmatory56.
Hierarchical clustering of viruses according to their confirmed hosts in different
orders was done using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index to identify clusters of
flaviviruses sharing similar sylvatic hosts.
For all species of mammals and birds, life history, physiological, and ecological
trait data were collected from multiple sources. Taxonomic classification,
conservation status, habitat utilization, and population temporal trend data were
collated from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) using
the letsR R package57. Data for body temperature, metabolic rate58, body mass, and
foraging attributes such as diet, foraging strata, and foraging time were also
included59. Habitat distribution (global range) of terrestrial mammals and birds
were downloaded from IUCN12 and BirdLife International60, respectively.
Shapefiles describing geographical range of species are suitable for calculating the
distributions of bio-climatic, and diversity-related species traits and for generating
presence/absence matrices for the species distribution57. These distribution
shapefiles were used to calculate geographical bounds, distribution areas, and
geographical centroids for the species distribution.
Global distribution data for bioclimatic variables, mammalian and avian
diversity and anthropogenic variables were collected from multiple sources61–63.
For each of the global raster datasets, we calculated zonal statistics for all species
using their geographical habitat distributions. A complete list of variables, their
explanations, sources, and calculated statistics can be found in Supplementary
Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4.
The interactions of vectors and hosts, biting preferences of ticks and
mosquitoes, and vector competence are all critical parameters in maintaining virus
circulation in a sylvatic environment. Since these data are not available, we
included a variable describing the spatial distribution of vectors within the
geographic range of a host. A systematic literature review was also done to identify
flavivirus vectors. Distribution data for 18 of the most common known mosquito
vectors and eight of the most common known tick vectors were procured from
VectorMap64, which included vector species that have been reported to carry 28
out of 35 flavivirus species evaluated in this analysis (Supplementary Table 5).
Mosquito and tick species distribution rasters represented probabilities for the
occurrence of the species, with values ranging from 0 to 1. These rasters were then
superimposed and summed together to generate two separate cumulative
distribution maps of mosquito vectors and tick vectors. These cumulative
distribution rasters were finally used to calculate zonal statistics for all bird and
mammalian species. Missing data were imputed using Kth-nearest neighbor
imputation methods using five nearest neighbors.
To control for potential reporting bias due to imbalanced sampling efforts to
collect and report data on flavivirus hosts, we included the number of primary
publications in PubMed using a MeSH term search for the avian and mammalian
species as a proxy for study efforts, assuming that surveillance efforts for vertebrate
species will be proportional to the number of citations available for them. This
approach also allowed us to account for geographical variation in the surveillance
as species are geographically distributed. Supplementary Figure 14 shows the
geographical variation in the PubMed hits used in the generic model to account for
sampling biases. Many of the large-scale surveillance programs target probable
species candidates, and hence sufficient sampling effort among animals that have
tested negative for a virus was rare. While knowledge of true negative species would
have facilitated model training, ascertainment of species status as non-hosts (i.e.,
unable to harbor flavivirus infection naturally) was not feasible. Thus, we choose a
conservative approach of identifying species that share similar macro-ecological
traits as known hosts. For modeling purposes, we generated a binary code for each
mammal and bird species (1, if the species is currently known to host any flavivirus
and 0, if not, Supplementary Data file 3), generating a baseline for prediction based
on known species, which will be iteratively improved following the discovery of
new flaviviruses hosts with appropriate field data.
Analysis and modeling. We applied generalized boosted regression tree (BRT)
methods using the aforementioned twenty-nine host traits as predictors for binary
code generated for species to host a flavivirus (generic Flavivirus model). Such

 models are useful here, as boosting improves the predictive performance of many
weak models substantially, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and can
automatically handle interaction effects between predictors11. For this analysis,
data were partitioned into training and holdout sets (80% of observations used for
training, 20% used as holdout) and relative sizes of positive samples were kept
similar in both the sets (Supplementary Table 1). For model building, we used a 10-
fold cross-validation method to avoid overfitting for tuning model parameters.
Using this method, training data were randomly partitioned into ten, equal-sized
subsamples and each subsample was retained once as testing data, while the rest of
the data was used to train the model. We used the gbm step function from R
package gbm65, to assess the optimal number of boosting trees, as described in Elith
et al.11 The BRT model generates additive models in a step-wise manner while
optimizing the differentiable loss function. At each stage, a regression tree was fit
on a Bernoulli loss function. The holdout dataset was then used for external
validation of the model performance. Relative influence of host traits was estimated
using the equation developed by Friedman for tree-based methods66 and is based
on the number of times a variable is selected for splitting, weighted by the squared
improvement to the model as a result of each split averaged over all trees11. For
assessment of the robustness of the methodology with respect to reporting bias, we
reran the generic model by excluding the host factor related to the number of
primary publications in PubMed.
To evaluate the clustering of hosts due to phylogenetic relatedness within
taxonomic groups, we included dummy categorical variables for all host families
related to the model. Along with the generic flaviviruses model, which was
developed to explore macroecological traits of Flavivirus sylvatic hosts, individual
models were developed for flaviviral clusters and flaviviruses that did not cluster
with any other virus (TBEV, JEV, and DENV). The stratified models were
developed to explore the virus-specific host patterns and to minimize biases related
to variability in research effort among viruses. Bias towards the inclusion of more
well-studied hosts is likely to influence results of the generic model. Binary
responses for these models were based on whether a host species was known to
carry any of the viruses within each virus group. Virus-specific models were
restricted only to species from taxonomical orders with confirmed hosts for those
viruses (Supplementary Table 4). To evaluate model robustness to species
classifications, we developed a second model for group 2 viruses (WNV, SLEV, and
USUV) with hosts reclassified as positive only if they had been detected positive by
PCR or virus isolation (and not considering species found positive by PRNT).
We explored 90th and 95th percentiles of our model predictions and probability
values that maximized the true positive rate + true negative rate for the holdout
datasets to identify the threshold that best highlighted species as probable hosts for
flaviviruses. Known geographic distributions12,60 of predicted species in the 95th
percentile of model predictions were plotted to identify regions with a higher
diversity of predicted hosts. To represent model-predicted probabilities with
species distributions, we assigned predicted probability values for each host species
to the raster layer representing the geographical ranges of the hosts and summed
the probabilities across all the raster layers to generate maps showing hotspots with
high predicted host probability.
