AbsTrACT
This guideline aimed to advance current understandings 
regarding the diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic 
interventions for ankle sprains by updating the existing 
guideline and incorporate new research. A secondary 
objective was to provide an update related to the 
cost-effectiveness of diagnostic procedures, therapeutic 
interventions and prevention strategies. It was posited 
that subsequent interaction of clinicians with this 
guideline could help reduce health impairments 
and patient burden associated with this prevalent 
musculoskeletal injury. The previous guideline provided 
evidence that the severity of ligament damage can be 
assessed most reliably by delayed physical examination 
(4–5 days post trauma). After correct diagnosis, it can be 
stated that even though a short time of immobilisation 
may be helpful in relieving pain and swelling, the patient 
with an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture benefits 
most from use of tape or a brace in combination with an 
exercise programme. 
New in this update: Participation in certain sports is 
associated with a heightened risk of sustaining a lateral 
ankle sprain. Care should be taken with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usage after an ankle 
sprain. They may be used to reduce pain and swelling, 
but usage is not without complications and NSAIDs 
may suppress the natural healing process. Concerning 
treatment, supervised exercise-based programmes 
preferred over passive modalities as it stimulates the 
recovery of functional joint stability. Surgery should 
be reserved for cases that do not respond to thorough 
and comprehensive exercise-based treatment. For the 
prevention of recurrent lateral ankle sprains, ankle braces 
should be considered as an efficacious option.
InTroduCTIon
A lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is a frequently incurred 
musculoskeletal injury, with a high prevalence 
among the general population and individuals who 
participate in sports.1 2 About 40% of all traumatic 
ankle injuries occur during sports. For indoor 
sports, an incidence of 7 LAS per 1000 exposures 
has been reported.3 Despite the high prevalence and 
incidence of LAS injuries, it has been reported that 
only approximately 50% of individuals who incur 
a LAS seek medical attention.4 A large propor-
tion of individuals who sustain a LAS will develop 
chronic ankle instability (CAI).5–7 CAI may be 
defined as persistent complaints of pain, swelling 
and/or giving way in combination with recurrent 
sprains for at least 12 months after the initial ankle 
sprain,8–11 which in turn may lead to (long-term) 
absenteeism from work and sports. Treatment 
costs in combination with sick leave lead to a high 
socioeconomic burden.4 7 12 Additionally, associa-
tions with joint degeneration and osteochondral 
lesions have been reported over time.13 Adequate 
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of injury recur-
rence could forestall the development of long-term 
injury-associated symptoms and hence substantially 
reduced the associated socioeconomic burden.
Despite the increasing number of published 
studies on this topic, heterogeneity in treatment 
strategies persists worldwide. This necessitated the 
development of an international evidence-based 
clinical guideline.14 Since the publication of this 
guideline, additional studies have been undertaken 
and published on this topic.
In order to provide an update of the multidisci-
plinary clinical guideline, a multidisciplinary guide-
line committee was formed. The committee included 
health professionals who were directly involved in 
the care of patients with LAS in clinical practice or 
research environments and included general prac-
titioners, emergency physicians, musculoskeletal 
radiologists, occupational physicians, orthopaedic 
surgeons, rehabilitation physicians, physical ther-
apists, athletic trainers, sports massage therapists, 
sports physicians and trauma surgeons. This clinical 
guideline incorporates the most recently published 
peer-reviewed literature on the topic of LAS injury. 
The aim of this updated evidence-based clinical 
guideline is to facilitate uniformity of diagnosis and 
treatment of acute LAS injury, with the primary 
purpose of reducing the long-term injury-associated 
symptoms resulting from this prevalent injury.
The multidisciplinary guideline committee devel-
oped this update in order to assist all healthcare 
professionals, in both primary and secondary care 
settings, involved in the care of patients who have 
sustained an acute LAS injury. These include general 
practitioners, emergency physicians, musculoskel-
etal radiologists, occupational physicians, ortho-
paedic surgeons, rehabilitation physicians, physical 
therapists, athletic trainers, sports massage thera-
pists, sports physicians, trauma surgeons and other 
professionals involved in lower extremity muscu-
loskeletal injuries. This updated Clinical Prac-
tice Guideline (CPG) will enable these healthcare

MATErIAls And METhods
The initial guideline was constrained in its recommendations due to 
limitations in available published literature, limiting assessment by 
means of meta-analyses.14 Due to the considerable number of new 
studies on LAS, it was decided by the guideline committee that an 
update of the original document was warranted.
search and data collection
T
o provide updated recommendations on the diagnosis and treat-
ment of acute LAS injuries and the prevention of injury recurrence, 
a search was performed to identify all potential relevant articles 
published from January 2009—the search date of the initial guide-
line—up to September 2016 (online supplementary appendix 1). 
The search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane and 
PEDro using the database-specific search translation on the topics of 
predisposing and prognostic factors, diagnostics, treatment, preven-
tion and return to work and sports. For each subtopic addressed in 
this guideline, an individual search was performed, which is avail-
able in the appendix. All searches consisted of the common terms 
‘ankle sprain’, ‘ankle injury’ and their database-specific synonyms, 
combined with topic specific terms such as ‘prevention’ and all 
available synonyms. T
o ensure all relevant articles were identified, 
the current search results were combined with the articles identified 
by the initial guideline and references of all relevant articles were 
checked for possibly missed inclusions.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they included indi-
viduals aged at least 16 years with acute LAS. Studies published 
in Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, Danish or Swedish 
were all eligible for inclusion. Narrative reviews, case reports and 
cadaveric analyses were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria 
were reported medial ankle involvement, fractures or other 
concomitant injuries/pathology and CAI. In addition to the orig-
inal search, a manual search of all reference lists of included studies 
was performed to identify relevant articles that may not have been 
identified by the search strategy. There were no inclusion or exclu-
sion criteria formed regarding outcome measures. In addition to 
including all outcomes assessed in the previous guideline (see the 
individual searches in online supplemenatry appendix 1), all other 
outcomes concerning risk/prognostic factors, diagnostics, treatment, 
prevention and work/sports resumption were included. If multiple 
follow-up time points were included in the assessment, the latest 
postintervention assessment was included.
data selection
After duplicate removal all studies were screened by two 
researchers (GV and AH/BFWvdD) independently using the 
Rayyan15 screening tool as advised by the Dutch Cochrane 
Society. Disagreements among the researchers who performed 
the initial screening were resolved in a consensus meeting. Subse-
quently, the same pair of researchers assessed full texts inde-
pendently, followed by another consensus meeting to resolve 
disagreements. If disagreement persisted, the senior author 
(GMMJK) was consulted to reach consensus. To avoid loss of 
original data for systematic reviews, all the included studies were 
manually checked for eligibility and relevant data.
Evidence and guideline quality
Quality of evidence of included articles was classified in order of 
scientific value (tables 1 and 2). Recommendations were based 
on the best available evidence. Statements formed by evidence 
from multiple studies, and the summarised level of evidence of 
the full statement was provided. The same was done for the level 
of evidence of the recommendations.
As this guideline concerns an update, as recommended by the 
EQUATOR-network, the CheckUp list was used for this guide-
line to help emphasise new information and changes imple-
mented in this updated CPG.16 Additionally, theAppraisal of 
Guidelines for Research & Evaluation (AGREE) II criteria were 
followed in order to ensure complete reporting of methods and 
results and improve transparency and quality.
data extraction
All outcomes that were described by at least two of the 
included studies were extracted for the meta-analyses (online

supplementary appendix 3). If outcomes concerned the same 
variable and were measured similarly (eg, pain on an 11-point 
Likert scale), they were pooled using Review Manager (RevMan; 
V
.5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, The 
Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Data that could not be pooled 
were assessed qualitatively.
Formulation of recommendations
Individual topics were assigned to the appropriate coauthors 
depending on their field of expertise in order to formulate 
recommendations based on the collected evidence. They subse-
quently received the corresponding studies to enable them to 
write the corresponding paragraph according to the method 
section predefined content to ensure uniformity. Results of 
these diagnostic, treatment and preventive recommendations 
were provided with the corresponding levels of evidence of the 
included conclusions. Aspects such as potential harm of inter-
ventions, patients’ perspective, costs and logistics were care-
fully considered when formulating the final recommendations. 
Recommendations were explicitly mentioned under ‘Recom-
mendations’; including the full recommendation based on all the 
available evidence and including a statement about whether this 
recommendation changed since this update.
In addition to recommendations on diagnostics, an overview of 
treatment and prevention strategies is provided in tables 3 and 4 
by pooling the data of studies assessing the same treatment/preven-
tive measure (number of patients (N); relative risk (RR) or mean 
difference (MD) and 95% CI).
New information was explicitly mentioned under ‘What’s 
new?’.
Implementation
To ensure implementation of a multidisciplinary view in this 
CPG in all phases of rehabilitation after sustaining a LAS, the 
guideline committee consisted of an emergency medicine physi-
cian, epidemiologists, general practitioner, musculoskeletal 
radiologist, orthopaedic surgeons, movement scientists, phys-
iotherapists and rehabilitation specialist (see affiliations). All 
members, apart from the two senior supervisors (RAdB and 
GMMJK), participated either in the search and selection of 
evidence or in reading, extracting and implementing data into 
this CGP
. Apart from full review by all coauthors, the two senior 
authors additionally functioned as external reviewers by means 
of full detailed review to ensure this CPG was compliant with 
the AGREE II criteria and to optimise quality, assess applicability 
in clinical practise and feasibility of results.

rEsulTs
To systematically evaluate and summarise all available evidence 
concerning LAS, a broad literature search was undertaken specif-
ically related to the following areas: (1) predisposing and prog-
nostic factors; (2) diagnostics, (3) treatment, (4) prevention and 
(5) return to work/sport. This search resulted in the identifica-
tion of a total of 10 
067 studies. After title and abstract screening 
and reading full texts, a total of 194 articles were eligible for 
inclusion in this guideline (online supplementary appendix 2). 
All fields of evidence with regard to relevant diagnostic tools, 
reliability of diagnostics, different treatment modalities and 
their efficacy, as well as prevention interventions including their 
cost-effectiveness will in turn be discussed. Recommendations 
will be provided based on the available level of evidence (tables 1 
and 2).
Predisposing factors
Predisposing factors are defined as factors that increase the 
risk of sustaining a LAS. Risk factors for LAS can be classified 
as either intrinsic (patient-related factors, eg, proprioception) 
or extrinsic (eg, sports or environmental characteristics). An 
important aspect that should be considered by clinicians when 
addressing predisposing factors is whether they can be modified 
or not. Modifiable risk factors may be targeted by (preventive) 
treatment.
Intrinsic risk factors
There are a number of intrinsic risk factors, which substantially 
heighten the risk of sustaining a LAS. These include limited dorsi-
flexion ROM,17–19 reduced proprioception18 20–23 and (preseason) 
deficiencies in postural control/balance (positive single-leg 
balance test (RR 2.54, 95% 
CI 1.02 to 6.03)20–22 24–28 (level 1). In 
addition, other modifiable risk factors which heighten the risk of 
sustaining a LAS include body mass index (BMI) and high medial 
plantar pressures during running28–33 (level 3). Concerning BMI, 
included results are conflicting as to whether a higher or lower 
BMI increases the risk of incurring a LAS. Our meta-analysis 
showed a greater risk of sprains in patients with a lower BMI 
(mean difference (MD) −0.08, 95% 
CI −0.14 to –0.02)23 34 
(level 2). Additional factors that may contribute to an increased 
risk are reduced strength,18 20–23 35 coordination,25 cardiorespira-
tory endurance,25 limited overall ankle joint ROM and decreased 
peroneal reaction time18 20–23 (level 3).
Concerning non-modifiable risk factors, females have a higher 
risk of sustaining a LAS compared with males (RR 1.25, 95% 
CI 
1.17 to 1.34)29 36 (level 3). Despite a history of LAS being 
described as a strong predictor, pooling results lead to a non-sig-
nificant risk ratio (RR 1.44, 95% 
CI 0.96 to 2.16)18 21 22 37–39 
(level 2). Additional factors correlated to an increased risk of 
sustaining a LAS are physical characteristics such as greater 
height, ankle joint configuration, foot posture index, anatomical 
abnormalities in ankle and knee alignment and multiple clinical 
defects28–33 (level 3).
What’s new: An increase in available data made it possible 
to identify female sex as well as potentially a lower BMI being 
risk factors for ankle sprains. Additionally, a recommendation is 
provided which was missing in the original guideline.
Recommendation (new): When treating patients with an acute 
LAS, modifiable risk factors such as deficiencies in propriocep-
tion and ROM should be identified and if possible included in a 
prevention and/or rehabilitation programme to mitigate the risk 
for recurrent sprains (level 3).
Extrinsic risk factors
Irrespectively of patients’ wish to switch sports, the main modi-
fiable extrinsic risk factor for LAS appears to be the type of sport 
practised. The highest incidence of LAS was found for aeroball, 
basketball, indoor volleyball, field sports and climbing.29 40 41

The incidence of LAS was dependent on the level of participa-
tion.29 40 41 In volleyball, landing after a jump is the most important 
risk factor41 42 (level 2). Playing soccer on natural grass (vs arti-
ficial turf: RR 0.53, 95% 
CI 0.48 to 0.59)43–45 as well as being 
a defender (42.3% of all sprains)46 47 increased the incidence of 
LAS (level 2). Concerning shoe wear, high heels (9.5 vs 1.3 
cm) 
heighten the risk of incurring a LAS48 (level 3).
The only non-modifiable factor was sex. Despite girls having 
an increased risk of LAS compared with boys, in-competition 
risk for LAS is higher in boys (RR 3.42, 95% 
CI 3.20 to 3.66) 
compared with girls (RR 2.71, 95% 
CI 2.48 to 2.95)36 (level 3).
What’s new: The new search resulted in a significant increase 
in data. The subsequent performed meta-analyses made it 
possible to identify the size of the increased risk of playing soccer 
on natural grass, the risk associated with being a defender and 
the risk while playing sports at a competitive level. New recom-
mendations are provided concerning the high impact of sport.
Recommendation (new): Extrinsic risk factors, although 
outside of the patient, may provide a significant increase in the 
risk at sustaining a LAS. Healthcare professionals involved in 
treating patients who sustain a LAS should take notice especially 
of the type of sport practised but also of other extrinsic risk 
factors, as modifications may lower the risk at future sprains and 
other ankle injuries (level 2).
Prognostic factors
Following an acute LAS, pain decreases rapidly within the first 
two 
weeks after injury.49 However, a substantial proportion of 
patients report long-term unresolved injury-associated symp-
toms. At a follow-up of 1–4 years, 5%–46% of patients still 
experience pain,49–51 3%–34% of patients experience recurrent 
sprains49–51 and 33%–55% of patients report instability.49 51 
Additionally, a higher physical workload load may be associated 
with an increased risk of recurrent sprains (RR 1.09, 95% 
CI 
0.52 to 1.19; RR 0.96, 95% 
CI 0.36 to 1.2) and ankle insta-
bility (RR 1.16, 95% 
CI 0.71 to 1.18; RR 1.10, 95% 
CI 0.57 
to 1.19).51 Even clinical signs of anterior impingement were 
found in 25% of patients, of which 82% were radiographically 
confirmed50 (level 3).
Despite initial treatment consisting of taping/bracing and 
physical rehabilitation, up to 40% of individuals who have 
sustained a LAS develop CAI.52 This may indicate that not all 
factors contributing to the success or failure of rehabilitation 
are known. Some of the known unfavourable prognostic factors 
identified for the development of CAI were an inability to 
complete jumping and landing within 2 weeks after a first-time 
LAS, deficiencies in dynamic postural control,53 altered hip joint 
kinematics54 and lack of mechanical stability/increased ligament 
laxity 8 weeks after an ankle sprain.55 56 Other factors that may 
influence the prognosis are sports participation at a high level,57 
being a young male,52 increased BMI52 and greater body height52 
(level 3). Finally, acute postural balance impairments persisting 
after LAS may also contribute to the development of CAI.58 
Due to the neuromuscular origin of some of these prognostic 
factors, physical therapy might be helpful to improve physical 
impairments after a LAS and prevent progression to CAI.59 60 
Based on the limited evidence concerning the risk factors for 
developing CAI following an ankle sprain, further research on 
prognostic factors is required and may provide additional and 
more uniform insights.61 62
What’s new: Over the past years more data have become 
available on negative prognostic factors that may indicate slow 
or incomplete rehabilitation. This enabled us to modify the 
previous recommendation, which lacked a conclusion due to 
insufficient evidence.
Recommendation (modified): Following acute LAS, adequate 
attention should be directed towards the patient’s current level 
of pain, their workload and level of sports participation. These 
may all negatively influence recovery and increase the risk of 
future injury recurrence. Hence, they should be addressed early 
in the treatment process (level 3).
diagnostics
In case of a severe ankle sprain, a fracture should be excluded 
by proper use of the Ottawa ankle rules (OAR), and if indi-
cated, conventional radiographic imaging should be undertaken 
(table 5). Since only 15% of patients with LAS, who are exam-
ined using a radiograph, are diagnosed with an ankle fracture, 
the OAR have been developed to rule out a fracture.63 The 
OAR are an accurate and valid tool, which can be used with 
patients who have a suspected ankle/foot fracture within 1 
week 
after the initial trauma (level 1).63–67 A high incidence of less 
serious traumas may lower the predictive value of the OAR in 
clinical practice.68 69 To avoid unnecessary use of radiographs, 
the OAR are recommended as a primary physical examination 
tool to rule out the likelihood of foot/ankle fractures by emer-
gency physicians, general practitioners or physiotherapists63 70–73 
(level 1). The Bernese ankle rules (BAR) have been developed as 
response to the high rate of unnecessary radiographs based on

Consensus statement
OAR findings. However, the sensitivity of the BAR is too low to 
promote clinical use74 (level 2).
In general, ankle ligament injuries are classified into three 
grades representing increasing injury severity: grade I, mild 
ankle sprain; grade II, moderate sprain/microligament lesions; 
and grade III, severe sprain/full ligament lesion.75 In cases where 
a haematoma is present, accompanied by pain on palpation 
around the distal fibula and/or a positive anterior drawer test, 
a rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments likely exists. The sensi-
tivity (84%) and specificity (96%) of physical examination using 
the anterior drawer test are optimised if clinical assessment is 
delayed for between 4 and 5 days post injury68 69 76 77 (level 2). 
Ultrasonography has similar sensitivity (92%) but lacks speci-
ficity (64%) compared with delayed examination, and addition-
ally depends on the availability of an experienced technician 
and equipment.69 78 In case of suspicion of high-grade ligament 
injuries, osteochondral defects, syndesmotic injuries and occult 
fractures, an MRI can be performed78 because of its excellent 
sensitivity (93%–96%) and specificity (100%) for visualising 
these injuries.79–83 Poor availability of MRI in combination with 
the high prevalence of ankle sprains limits the use of MRI in 
acute settings, but in case of persisting symptoms it may be used 
to diagnose underlying joint damage. In case of suspicion of 
complete uncomplicated rupture of the anterior talofibular liga-
ment, an MRI is not needed as the sensitivity and specificity of 
delayed physical examination are sufficient.69 Other diagnostic 
modalities are stress radiographs and arthrography. Due to the 
limited diagnostic value of stress views in combination with 
pain in the acute setting while stressing the ligaments, these are 
regarded as obsolete and should not be used. As arthrography is 
an invasive procedure and its sensitivity and specificity are equal 
to delayed physical examination, it is also not recommended as 
a diagnostic tool in the acute setting78 (level 2).
What’s new: To ensure readability, the OAR were included in 
this diagnostics section. To make sure this guideline provides a 
complete overview of the many decision rules which the OAR 
belong to, table 5 was added including the parametric properties 
of the most popular clinical decision rules. The recommendation 
includes a short summary by providing an overview of the most 
important diagnostic steps, which was missing in the previous 
guideline.
Recommendation (new): Regarding the clinical assessment of 
damage to the anterior talofibular ligament, the sensitivity (84%) 
and specificity (96%) of assessment using the anterior drawer are 
optimised if clinical assessment is delayed for between 4 and 5 
days post injury. In case of a suspected fracture, the OAR should 
be applied (level 2).
Treatment
Rest Ice Compression Elevation (RICE)
RICE is a conservative treatment method that has not been rigor-
ously investigated, and the efficacy of this combination is ques-
tionable. The individual elements of ice and compression have 
been the subject of numerous scientific investigations; however, 
there is little scientific support for their efficacy in reducing inju-
ry-associated symptoms following acute LAS.
The limited available evidence showed that the efficacy of 
cryotherapy for reducing acute LAS injury-associated symptoms 
is unclear (33 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), n=2337)84 85 
(level 1). There are no indications that the isolated use of ice can 
increase function, as well as decrease swelling and pain at rest 
among individuals who have sustained an acute LAS (27 RCTs, 
n=1670)84 86–90 (level 2). In combination with exercise therapy, 
cryotherapy has a greater effect on reducing swelling compared 
with heat application (one RCT, n=30)86 (level 2). The combi-
nation of cryotherapy and exercise additionally results in signifi-
cant improvements in ankle function in the short term, allowing 
patients to increase loading during weight bearing compared 
with standard functional treatment (one RCT, n=101)91 (level 
3).
Evidence regarding the efficacy of compression therapy after 
acute LAS is also inconclusive (three RCTs, N=86)87–89 (level 2).
As a combined therapeutic modality, the use of RICE plus 
multimodal physiotherapy compared with RICE alone provides 
no additional benefits. Both treatments provide pain reduction, 
increase patient function and reduce ankle swelling (one RCT, 
n=28)92 (level 2).
Regarding the individual effects of rest and elevation after 
LAS, no evidence was available.
What’s new: No new statements could be made based on the 
newly identified studies. The increased evidence indicates that 
the individual aspects of RICE are not effective, apart from cryo-
therapy, if provided in combination with exercise therapy.
Recommendation (modified): There is no evidence that RICE 
alone, or cryotherapy, or compression therapy alone has any 
positive influence on pain, swelling or patient function. There-
fore, there is no role for RICE alone in the treatment of acute 
LAS (level 2).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
NSAIDs are commonly prescribed for patients who have 
sustained an acute LAS, with the primary purpose of reducing 
pain. Pooling the results of current studies shows that the use 
of oral or topical NSAIDs results in less pain in the short term 
(<14 days) without significantly increasing the risk of adverse 
events compared with placebo (26 RCTs, n=4225)93–97 (level 1) 
(table 3). However, studies that included other NSAIDs instead 
of a placebo were excluded from this review98–102; additionally, 
the included participants were relatively young and healthy 
and thus potentially less prone to side effects. A comparison 
between selective NSAIDs (celecoxib 200 
mg two times daily) 
and non-selective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac) 
(four RCTs, n=1490) concluded that celecoxib was non-infe-
rior to non-selective NSAIDs for the primary outcome of pain 
following an acute LAS injury. Adverse events did not occur 
more frequently99 103–105 (level 1). Diclofenac showed superior 
results at days 1 and 2 compared with piroxicam (two RCTs, 
n=201) and ibuprofen (one RCT, n=60) for reducing pain 
during motion in patients with mild-to-severe acute ankle sprains 
and equal adverse event rates98 101 (levels 2 and 3). Contradicting 
results have been reported on the effect of diclofenac for pain 
during rest, swelling and inflammation,.98 101 No differences in 
effect were seen when comparing a fixed dosage (500 
mg two 
times daily) to an as-needed naproxen dosage (one RCT, n=135, 
MDpain−0.13 (−0.38 to 0.12))106 (level 3). Despite dose differ-
ences, paracetamol (cq. acetaminophen) seems to be equally 
effective as NSAID usage (three RCTs, n=450) for pain (one 
RCT, n=86, MD 1.80, 95% 
CI −1.42 to 5.02), swelling (two 
RCTs, n=186, MD −0.07, 95% 
CI −0.29 to 0.14) and ROM 
(one RCT, n=100, MD 0.70, 95% 
CI −0.62 to 2.02)107–109 (level 
1). Opioid analgesics are equally effective for pain relief, but lead 
to significantly more side effects (two RCTs, n=869)100 110 (level 
2). The use of NSAIDs may delay the natural healing process as 
the inflammation suppressed by NSAIDs is a necessary compo-
nent of tissue recovery.111

Consensus statement
Besides these commonly prescribed analgesics, other pharma-
ceutical treatment modalities were described: venotonic drugs 
did not result in enhanced outcomes for pain and swelling 
compared with paracetamol and RICE112 (level 2); platelet-rich 
plasma injections were not superior for pain and functional 
outcomes compared with placebo injections (one RCT, n=37)113 
(level 3), and topically applied Traumeel (one RCT, n=449)114 
(level 2) was not superior compared with diclofenac topical gel 
for ankle oedema, pain and function. Periarticular hyaluronic 
acid injections compared with placebo (two RCTs; n=158) did 
show a positive effect on pain, nor did they result in a quicker 
time to return to sport or reduced prevalence of recurrent 
sprains115 116 (level 2).
What’s new: Based on the search results concerning treatment, 
the committee agreed on implementing a topic on NSAIDs. Over 
the past years much research has been undertaken on NSAIDs 
in relation to musculoskeletal injuries, and in many countries 
they are available without prescription. However, before recom-
mending NSAIDs, their effect in the specific context of an ankle 
sprain had to be assessed.
Recommendation (new): NSAIDs may be used by patients who 
have incurred an acute LAS for the primary purpose of reducing 
pain and swelling. However, care should be taken in NSAID 
usage as it is associated with complications (level 2) and may 
suppress or delay the natural healing process.
Immobilisation
A minimum of 4 weeks in a lower leg cast following an acute 
LAS results in less optimal outcomes compared with functional 
support and exercise strategies with a duration of 4–6 
weeks117118 
(22 RCTs, n=2304) (level 1). More recent evidence (three RCTs, 
n=694) showed that a short period (<10 days) of immobilisa-
tion with a plaster cast or rigid support can be of added value in 
the treatment of acute lateral ligament injury as it decreases pain 
and oedema and improves functional outcome119–122 (level 2).
What’s new: Despite the inclusion of new recent studies, there 
were no new findings.
Recommendation (not changed): Use of functional support 
and exercise therapy is preferred as it provides better outcomes 
compared with immobilisation. If immobilisation is applied to 
treat pain or oedema, it should be for a maximum of 10 days 
after which functional treatment should be commenced (level 2).
Functional treatment
Functional support
Functional supports in the form of an ankle brace or tape are 
often used following acute LAS. These external supports differ 
from rigid immobilisation and allow the patient to load the 
damaged tissues in a protected manner. Treatment with any 
type of real ankle support was more effective compared with 
treatment with less adequate support such as a compression 
bandage or a tubigrip5 122 (level 2). Wearing compression stock-
ings beyond the acute phase is not helpful in the treatment of 
acute lateral ankle ligament injury123 (level 3). The success of 
functional treatment is, however, dependent on the severity of 
the injury. For example, if a sprain is complicated by a ligament 
avulsion fracture results may be inferior to those in patients with 
isolated ligament injury.124
The superiority of one external support over another is 
debated rigorously in the literature.125–127 A meta-analysis 
(n=892) showed a lace-up brace or a semi-rigid brace should 
be preferred to the use of an elastic bandage125 (level 1). Use of 
an ankle brace results in better outcome compared with other 
types of functional treatment such as sports tape (non-elastic) or 
kinesiotape (elastic), without showing any side effects.128 Based 
on a small systematic review (n=276), it can be concluded that 
kinesiotape is unlikely to provide sufficient mechanical support 
in unstable ankles129 (level 1).
What’s new: New evidence emphasises that the use of external 
supports (ie, braces) is preferred over immobilisation. Addition-
ally, the preferred time frame during which the use of external 
support is advised is outlined. Overall, the core message of this 
section remains unchanged.
Recommendation (modified): Use of functional support for 
4–6 weeks is preferred over immobilisation. The use of an ankle 
brace shows the greatest effects compared with other types of 
functional support (level 2).
Exercise
Among patients who seek professional healthcare following 
an acute LAS, exercise therapy is often an integral component 
of the treatment administered. Exercise therapy programmes 
mainly consist of neuromuscular and proprioceptive exercises. 
Exercise therapy programmes that are initiated early following 
an acute LAS injury have established efficacy. They can reduce 
the prevalence of recurrent injuries130–132 (10 RCTs, n=1284) 
(RR 0.62, 95% 
CI 0.51 to 0.76), as well as the prevalence of 
functional ankle instability131 133 (3 RCTs, n=174) (RR 0.80, 
95% 
CI 0.64 to 1.00). Furthermore, they are associated with a 
quicker time to recovery and enhanced outcomes130 133–136 (level 
1). Including supervised physiotherapy has shown to have some 
benefit in patients with a severe ankle sprain compared with 
a mild LAS as measured by PROMs,60 and whence compared 
with a home exercise programme137 138 (level 1). Additionally, 
supervised exercise therapy may lead to improvements in ankle 
strength138 and proprioception,138 faster return to work139 and 
sport,134 compared with performing the exercise programme 
without supervision or guidance (level 1). Many articles, 
however, contradict these findings, concluding that there is 
no effect from the addition of supervised exercise therapy to 
conventional treatment alone (two RCTs, n=130)140 141 (level 
2) nor an improvement of postural balance after exercise 
therapy131 142 (level 1).
What’s new: New evidence has become available on the 
specific effects of different types of exercise/rehabilita-
tion programmes; especially the beneficial effect of exercise 
therapy on preventing recurrent sprains, reducing the risk of 
functional instability and expediting the recovery of ankle 
joint function.
Recommendation (modified): Exercise therapy should be 
commenced after LAS to optimise recovery of joint functionality. 
Whether exercise therapy should be supervised or not remains 
unclear due to contradictory evidence and requires further 
research (level 1). 
Manual mobilisation
Manual joint mobilisation can provide a short-term increase in 
ankle joint dorsiflexion ROM following acute LAS131 143–147 (12 
RCTs, n=427) (level 1). Additionally, joint mobilisation has been 
reported to decrease pain143 (level 1). Manual therapy combined 
with exercise therapy resulted in better outcomes compared with 
exercise therapy alone137 (level 3).
What’s new: Despite findings by the previous version of this 
guideline that manual mobilisation only results in short-term 
treatment effects, current evidence shows added value of manual 
mobilisation when used in combination with exercise therapy.

Consensus statement
Recommendation (modified): A combination with other treat-
ment modalities, such as exercise therapy, enhances the efficacy 
of manual joint mobilisation and is therefore advised (level 3).
Surgical therapy
Surgical therapy for acute lateral ligament injuries has been 
performed abundantly until it was recognised that conservative 
treatment provides equal effects and that not all patients require 
surgery in order to resolve complaints148–151 (level 1). Nowadays, 
surgery is mainly reserved for patients who have chronic insta-
bility after a LAS and who have not responded to a comprehen-
sive exercise-based physiotherapy programme. Long-term effects 
of surgical treatment in cases of acute lateral ligament injury 
correspond with those of functional treatment. Surgery seems 
superior at decreasing the prevalence of recurrent LAS, which is 
important as recurrent LAS in turn may increase the risk for the 
subsequent development of osteoarthritis (one RCT, n=51)13 
(level 2). There is limited evidence for longer recovery times, 
higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility 
and complications in patients who received surgical treatment 
(20 RCTs, n=2562)150 (level 1). More recent studies show that 
outcomes in terms of recovery of ankle activity and instability 
are significantly better for surgical treatment than for functional 
treatment (12 RCTs, n=1413)152 (level 1). As a previous sprain 
is a predictor for recurrent ankle sprains, this may be related to 
increased ligament laxity. This laxity is resolved during surgery. 
Based on this indirect evidence, it may be suggested that surgical 
therapy helps prevent recurrent ankle sprains. However, a large 
percentage (60%–70%) of individuals who sustain a LAS respond 
well to non-surgical treatment programmes,149 and therefore 
treating all patients with LAS would mean unnecessary exposure 
to an invasive intervention for many patients, not to mention costs 
 
(level 1).
What’s new: New evidence supports the rationale for being 
reserved with the recommendation of surgery for all patients 
following LAS. This lead to refinement of the recommendation 
regarding surgery.
Recommendation (modified): Despite good clinical outcomes 
of surgery after both chronic injuries and an acute complete 
lateral ligament rupture, functional treatment is still the preferred 
method as not all patients require surgical treatment. This also 
helps to avoid unnecessary exposure to invasive (over) treatment 
and unnecessary risk of complications149 152 (level 1). However, 
treatment decisions have to be made on an individual basis. In 
professional athletes, surgical treatment may be preferred to 
ensure quicker return to play.151
Other therapies
Other treatment modalities less frequently used do not always 
show a treatment effect. For example, no effect on pain, oedema, 
function and return to play has been shown for ultrasound153 154 
(level 1), laser therapy155 (level 1), electrotherapy156–158 (level 
1) and shortwave therapy159–163 (level 2) in the treatment of 
acute LAS. Evidence on acupuncture is inconclusive concerning 
the therapeutic effect due to large heterogeneity between 
studies164 165 (level 1). A small cohort study indicated that local 
vibration therapy may be effective in patients with LAS by 
increasing dorsiflexion and eversion and decreasing perceived 
ankle stiffness,166 while another study indicated the possible 
beneficial effect of Bioptron light therapy in addition to cryo-
therapy167 (level 3).
What’s new: Acupuncture, vibration therapy and Bioptron 
light therapy were added to the present update. Concerning the 
other identified therapies, new evidence did not change previous 
statements.
Recommendation (not changed): As no strong evidence exists 
on the effectiveness of these treatment modalities, they are not 
advised in the treatment of acute LAS (level 2).
Communication between professionals
Since there are various disciplines involved in the care for patients 
with LAS, it is preferable to make working arrangements at a 
regional level on indications for referral, division of tasks and 
what information is provided by healthcare professionals. The 
different disciplines involved in primary and secondary care are 
emergency physicians, sports masseurs and physical therapists, 
sports physicians and general practitioners, orthopaedic and 
trauma surgeons, radiologists, medical officers for occupational 
medicine and rehabilitation physicians. Within referral between 
healthcare professionals, optimal communication is preferred. 
What information should be communicated between healthcare 
professionals depends on the phase of LAS; the diagnostic phase, 
the treatment phase and the guidance phase.14 168–170
What’s new: The checklist and statements from the previous 
version of this guideline were not subject to change. The most 
important factor remains communication.
Recommendation (not changed): To refine communication 
between healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of 
patients with LAS, a communication check list is recommended 
(table 4).14 168–170
Prevention
Functional support
The use of brace or tape reduces the risk of both recurrent (RR 
0.30, 95% 
CI 0.21 to 0.43) and first-time ankle sprains (RR 
0.69, 95% 
CI 0.49 to 0.96), especially in those who participate 
in sports4 125 171 172 (level 1). Kinesiotape may also have a preven-
tive effect in patients who have already sustained a LAS due to its 
effects on postural control171 (five RCTs, n=276) (level 1). The 
use of a brace or tape is a personal choice and based on practical 
usability and costs. Associated adverse events are rare.4 125 171 172 
Ankle brace or tape usage has not shown any beneficial effects 
on proprioceptive acuity in patients who sustained recurrent 
ankle sprains or those who have functional ankle instability 
(eight RCTs, n=152) (level 1). This conclusion was consistent 
when the two aspects of proprioception, sense of movement and 
joint position, were considered separately.129 No differences in 
prevention of recurrent sprains were found between different 
types of tape and brace as support.117 172 173
What’s new: In addition to updating the risk ratios by 
including new studies, a  risk ratio is provided for the preventive 
effect of tape and brace for first-time ankle sprains. Additionally 
information on the effect on proprioception and adverse events 
was included. This new evidence did not change the previous 
recommendation.
Recommendation (not changed): Both tape and brace have a 
role in the prevention of recurrent LAS despite limited evidence 
on mechanisms that leads to these beneficial effects (level 1). The 
choice of usage should depend on personal preferences.
Exercise therapy
Coordination and balance training have been shown to prevent 
recurrent ankle sprains.4 The assessment of the effect of exercise 
therapy as in neuromuscular training (mainly proprioception) has 
shown a positive effect towards prevention of LAS132 139 173–175 
and especially recurrent LAS. A meta-analysis (two RCTs, n=130)

illustrated that exercise therapy had a protective effect compared 
with usual care on preventing recurrent LAS (RR 0.62, 95% 
CI 
0.51 to 0.76). Usual care was defined as ‘any form of rehabilita-
tive treatment used by the athlete, without any interference from 
the authors’ (cited from Hupperets et al).176 This effect is even 
larger in athletes (RR 0.38, 95% 
CI 0.23 to 0.62)38 177 (level 1). 
When exposing athletes with recurrent sprains to proprioceptive 
training, to improve joint position sense, their risk of recurrence 
of LAS is reduced to the same level as healthy controls4 42 177–180 
(level 3). Exercise therapy such as coordination and balance 
training mainly seem to be effective for recurrent ankle sprains 
up to 12 months after the initial sprain,4 131 176 181 but not on 
first-time ankle sprains21 38 175 182 (level 1).
What’s new: More positive effects of different training 
programmes have become available, strengthening the recom-
mendation of the previous guideline.
Recommendation (not changed): For this reason, it is advised 
to start exercise therapy, especially in athletes, as soon as possible 
after the initial sprain to prevent recurrent LAS. Exercise therapy 
should be included into regular training activities as much as 
possible as home-based exercise (level 1). The preventive effect 
of exercise therapy for first-time LAS lacks evidence (table 6).
Footwear
No evident conclusions exist on the role of footwear in the 
prevention of ankle sprains (level 2). Wearing low-fitted or 
high-fitted shoes did not show any difference in preventive 
effect (three RCTs, n=3410)4 172 183 (level 1). Despite the lack 
of evidence, some authors prefer high-fitted shoes,73 117 whereas 
other authors describe a preference of low-fitted shoes120 (level 
1). Possibly shoes being new is of greater importance compared 
with the height of the shaft of the shoe in preventing ankle 
sprains.4 Also, no difference in LAS incidence is seen when 
wearing sports shoes with or without a cushioned column.91
What’s new: New evidence corresponded with the evidence 
found in the previous guideline.
Recommendation (not changed): Due to the inconclusiveness 
of evidence, no recommendations can be made concerning shoe 
wear (level 1).
resuming work
To facilitate return to work, discrimination between different 
degrees of injury can support the initial treatment and 
identification of the prognosis in relation to return to work184 
(level 4). Additionally, a schedule for work resumption (table 7), 
which takes into account all task requirements, may assist in 
optimisation of the reintegration process185 186 (level 3). T
wo 
systematic reviews stated wearing a brace provided better 
functional outcome compared with no brace, without limiting 
return to work (two RCTs, n=157)125 128 (level 2). Immediate 
post-traumatic mobilisation and functional treatment also seem 
to have a positive effect on the treatment of acute LAS and lead 
to shorter sick leave and faster return to work compared with 
immobilisation131 187–189 (level 1).
What’s new: With the current focus on productivity and socio-
economic burden, return to work is of substantial importance. 
Based on new available evidence, table 7 was expanded and the 
advice on return to work was further specified.

Consensus statement
Recommendation (modified): To speed up return to work, a 
brace and immediate functional treatment in combination with a 
return to work schedule are advised (level 3).
sport resumption
LAS may lead to multiple problems such as proprioception 
disturbances. These disturbances seem to originate from the 
central nervous system above the level of the spinal reflex 
(level 2) and may result in functional instability.190–192 Addi-
tionally, delayed response time of the peroneal muscle has been 
detected, possibly due to traction injury of the peroneal nerve.193 
However, motor-unit insufficiencies seen after a LAS seem to 
last shorter than those after other lateral ankle injuries not based 
on an inversion trauma mechanism178 193–195 (level 2). Strength 
deficits are present following LAS. For these reasons, early func-
tional treatment is advised and should address proprioception, 
muscle response time and muscle strength,196–200 enabling early 
return to sport participation187 188 (level 2).
What’s new: In addition to the many new and varying types 
of rehabilitation programmes, recent results showed that super-
vised exercise provides better outcomes compared with non-su-
pervised training.
Recommendation (modified): Supervised exercises focusing on 
a variety of exercises such as proprioception, strength, coordina-
tion and function will lead to a faster return to sport in patients 
after a LAS134 and are therefore recommended (level 1).
Cost-effectiveness
Costs of injury
Estimated societal costs of ankle sprains, as reported in the liter-
ature, vary between €360201 and €1100202 per individual (level 
2). This disparity in reported costs is due to, among others, vari-
ations in healthcare system, population, and type and severity of 
injury. Although most patients with ankle sprain do not receive 
supervised rehabilitation203 (level 3), these values indicate that 
ankle sprains have a substantial financial impact on society. Addi-
tionally, added to these costs in the short term, patients with 
ankle sprain are at risk of developing chronic conditions, which 
in turn may lead to subsequent costs. Consequently, optimised 
treatment and prevention will provide economic benefits in 
addition to clinical effects for the individual.
Diagnostics
The OAR provide a valid and reliable cost-effective tool to 
diagnose fractures after an ankle sprain203 (level 3). In 1995, it 
was shown that implementing the OAR as opposed to existing 
hospital protocols resulted in cost savings between €7.01 and 
€30.96 per patient204 (level 3). More recently, implementation of 
the OAR through emergency department nurses has been shown 
to be a cost-effective method to diagnose and manage ankle 
sprains205 (level 3). As an alternative to the OAR, the low-risk 
ankle rule provides a cost-effective tool to diagnose paediatric 
ankle fractures, with an estimated reduction in required radio-
graphs of around 60%206 (level 3).
Treatment
Functional treatment is clinically the treatment strategy of choice 
for ankle sprains. No full cost-effectiveness studies are known 
to compare functional treatment against immobilisation as treat-
ment. In regards to indirect costs, a functional approach (3–5 
days of rest, ice, compression and elevation with early weight 
bearing, after which active exercise is commenced) leads to the 
fastest resumption of work and daily life activities compared 
with any other kind of treatment207 (level 3). For protection, 
ankle support may be indicated to facilitate return to work. A 
semirigid brace is suggested to be the most cost-effective option 
compared with taping208 (level 3).
Prevention
Preventive efforts against first-time and recurrent ankle sprains 
have shown high cost benefits208 (level 3). Both neuromus-
cular training and ankle braces have been proven beneficial 
as a preventive investment due to lower societal costs, mainly 
achieved through reduced indirect costs209 (level 2). Compari-
sons between measures have indicated bracing to be superior to 
taping210 and neuromuscular training211 as a preventive option 
(level 1). Of note is that the latter statement is only valid for the 
preventive value of bracing. Neuromuscular training has been 
associated with clinical benefits other than prevention alone, 
which should also be considered212 (level 1) (table 8).
dIsCussIon
After an acute LAS it is important to first exclude the presence 
of any fractures. To this end the OAR can be used, having a high 
sensitivity and specificity. Subsequently, functional treatment in 
the form of exercise and functional support (ie, brace or tape) is 
preferred over immobilisation. Still a short time of immobilisa-
tion may help diminish complaints of pain and swelling in case 
of a lateral ligament injury. In case of ROM restriction, mobil-
isation therapy may provide help, but combination with exer-
cise therapy is advised. Surgery should be reserved for patients 
with lateral ligament ruptures to avoid unnecessary invasive 
treatment and risk of complications. In the prevention of ankle 
sprains, functional support is effective in patients with both first-
time and recurrent LAS, but seems most effective in preventing 
recurrent sprains. Exercise therapy, however, has only shown a 
significant preventive effect for recurrent ankle sprains. For first-
time LAS, there was mainly a lack of evidence as studies did not 
explicitly name whether their included population had previ-
ously suffered a LAS or not. Additionally, this may be explained 
by a lack of research on exercise in a population who has never 
suffered a LAS as exercise is mostly commenced after injury 
during rehabilitation.
Overall there is no clear evidence on the role of other forms 
of therapy such as (high-fitted and low- fitted and sports) shoe 
wear, vibration and electrostimulation therapy in the treatment 
and prevention of (recurrent) LAS. There are no conclusions on 
acupuncture since there were no studies that involved a sham 
acupuncture group. On the exact role of BMI, we cannot provide 
any conclusive recommendations. Whereas a lower BMI seems 
to increase the risk of sustaining an initial ankle sprain, a higher 
BMI seems to be a prognostic factor for persistent complaints 
and incomplete recovery.
Apart from the side effects reported for NSAIDs usage and 
complications resulting from surgery, no complications have 
been reported for functional support devices such as tape or 
brace.213 This is despite some known adverse effects such as 
rashes, which may need more detailed reporting in articles 
studying such devices.
By development of this CPG on ankle sprains, all current 
evidence is considered to provide insight into the best evidence-
based practice. To ensure readability, all information was 
categorised, summarised and recommendations provided sepa-
rately explicating the effectiveness per treatment or preventive 
modality. Overall, this guideline provides strong evidence per 
treatment and preventive modality by combining multiple RCTs

showing consistent results. The AGREE II reporting guidelines 
have been used in an attempt to optimise the quality of this CPG.
Provided evidence may, however, be influenced by publication 
bias, indicated by the limited amount of evidence on negative 
effects or treatment without any clinical effect. Level of evidence 
and bias assessment using GRADEpro were not possible due to 
the large amount of included studies. As an alternative, each state-
ment was provided with a level of evidence according to tables 1 
and 2. There is also the effect of selection bias. Ankle sprains 
are very common, and many people sustaining LAS do not seek 
medical advice. Therefore, the effect of ‘no intervention’ on the 
outcome after LAS remains unknown. Most contradictory results 
were found in small studies showing both positive and nega-
tive effects, levelling out to a neutral MD or RR. Additionally, 
most studies only included injured patients, whereas there is 
some conflict in the evidence of certain preventive measures in 
patients with first-time LAS. For this, more research is needed to 
enable adequate comparison between preventive effects based 
on a history of ankle sprains, preferably within the same study 
group. The best available evidence has been included in this 
guideline. However, the preferred approach by both patients 
and healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process, treatment 
and prevention of LAS has not. This is due to a lack of evidence 
on subjective data, apart from patient satisfaction after under-
going a certain treatment. More evidence on this topic may help 
identify the best treatment strategy per patient.
By including all steps that may be encountered by a patient 
from the moment of sustaining an ankle sprain up to full 
recovery, this guideline also includes all procedures consid-
ered and possibly performed by healthcare professionals. 
Thus, this guideline has a clinical focus and may provide 
support for all healthcare professionals encountering patients 
with ankle sprain irrespective of the phase of rehabilitation 
the patient is in. Many of the steps addressed in this guideline 
are steps in daily clinical practice, whether they are proven 
effective or not. There is a need for a clear policy that can be 
implemented worldwide. By updating the guideline on ankle 
sprains, the first step is taken towards such a policy. Further 
awareness regarding this guideline, to enable healthcare 
providers to follow the state-of-the-art recommendations, 
must be raised by means of scientific publication, scientific 
referral, congresses and raising awareness among the various 
professional associations.
Future perspectives and research
This update provides the most recent evidence on diagnostics, 
treatment and prevention for acute LAS. As more evidence has 
become available, often of a higher evidence level, this enabled the 
use of meta-analyses where there was a lack of evidence in the initial 
guideline. However, not all recommendations were supported by 
meta-analysis. Also, some recommendations lack evidence from 
RCTs. A future update might be required if enough new studies 
become available. Thus this guideline may be updated after 5–10 
years to ensure content and recommendations remain up to date 
using the same methodology and search strategy. If relevant new 
treatment methods, preventive techniques or other aspects are 
identified, these will receive appropriate attention depending on 
their importance for patients who sustained a LAS. In a future 
update, the methodological quality may be included to formulate 
conclusions based on the quality and reliability of results, as may be 
done using the GRADEpro tool.
Future research is required in the field of different functional 
treatment and prevention strategies, identifying superiority 
between different types of support and training and for which 
specific subpopulations these are effective (eg, recurrent or first-
time LAS). Additional research may be performed on prefer-
ences of patients and healthcare professionals: what do patients 
prefer on forehand before undergoing treatment and what were 
their experiences? Which treatments do healthcare professionals 
prefer and is this dependent on injury severity, and so on, as this 
may contribute to formulating future recommendations.
