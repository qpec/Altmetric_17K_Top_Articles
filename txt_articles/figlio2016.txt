Long-term Cognitive and Health Outcomes of School-Aged
Children Who Were Born Late-Term vs Full-Term
David N. Figlio, PhD; Jonathan Guryan, PhD; Krzysztof Karbownik, PhD; Jeffrey Roth, PhD
IMPORTANCE Late-term gestation (defined as the 41st week of pregnancy) is associated with
increased risk of perinatal health complications. It is not known to what extent late-term
gestation is associated with long-term cognitive and physical outcomes. Information about
long-term outcomes may influence physician and patient decisions regarding optimal
pregnancy length.
OBJECTIVE To compare the cognitive and physical outcomes of school-aged children who
were born full term or late term.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed Florida birth certificates from 1994 to
2002 linked to Florida public school records from 1998 to 2013 and found 1 442 590
singleton births with 37 to 41 weeks’gestation in the Florida Bureau of Vital Statistics. Of
these, 1 153 716 children (80.0%) were subsequently located in Florida public schools. Linear
and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of gestational age with
cognitive and physical outcomes at school age. Data analysis took place between April 2013
and January 2016.
EXPOSURES Late-term (born at 41 weeks) vs full-term (born at 39 or 40 weeks) gestation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES There were a number of measures used, including the
average Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test mathematics and reading scores at ages
8 through 15 years; whether a child was classified as gifted, defined as a student with superior
intellectual development and capable of high performance; poor cognitive outcome, defined
as a child scoring in the fifth percentile of test takers or having a disability that exempted him
or her from taking the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test; and Exceptional Student
Education placement owing to orthopedic, speech, or sensory impairment or being
hospitalbound or homebound.
RESULTS Of 1 536 482 children born in Florida from singleton births from 1994 to 2002 with
complete demographic information, 787 105 (51.2%) were male; 338 894 (22.1%) of mothers
were black and 999 684 (65.1%) were married at time of birth, and the mean (SD) age for
mothers at time of birth was 27.2 (6.2) years. Late-term infants had 0.7% of an SD (95% CI,
0.001-0.013; P = .02) higher average test scores in elementary and middle school, 2.8%
(95% CI, 0.4-5.2; P = .02) higher probability of being gifted, and 3.1% (95% CI, 0.0-6.1;
P = .05) reduced probability of poor cognitive outcomes compared with full-term infants.
These cognitive benefits appeared strongest for children with disadvantaged family
background characteristics. Late-term infants were also 2.1% (95% CI, −0.3 to 4.5; P = .08)
more likely to be physically impaired.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There appears to be a tradeoff between cognitive and
physical outcomes associated with late-term gestation. Children born late-term performed
better on 3 measures of school-based cognitive functioning but worse on 1 measure of
physical functioning relative to children born full term. Our findings provide longer-run
information for expectant parents and physicians who are considering delivery at full term
vs late term. These findings are most relevant to uncomplicated, low-risk pregnancies.

onsiderable evidence has accumulated suggesting that
full-term infants (born at 39 or 40 weeks’gestation)
have better health and cognitive outcomes in child-
hood and into adulthood than early-term infants (born at 37
or 38 weeks’gestation), though many articles are limited by
missing data.1-7 This evidence was the basis for the 1999 rec-
ommendationoftheAmericanCollegeofObstetriciansandGy-
necologists (ACOG) against elective induction before 39 weeks
of gestation and the subsequent 2013 recommendation of the
ACOGDefining“Term”PregnancyWorkgroup.8,9Becauseterm
infants after 40 weeks face elevated risks (especially delivery
and respiratory complications), the ACOG workgroup cited a
U-shaped association between weeks of gestation and prob-
ability of risk, with optimal birth outcomes at 39 and 40 weeks,
and recommended that the 41st week of gestation be labeled
late term.10-12
Current standards of care have been based primarily on
outcomesobservedimmediatelyafterbirth.ThisU-shapedges-
tational age-risk probability association noted in birth out-
comes may not capture trajectories seen later in childhood and
adulthood.13-15 Specifically, there is reason to believe that cog-
nitive outcomes continue to improve with increased gesta-
tion beyond full term. Because fetal maturation continues be-
tween full term and late term (for example, birth weight
increases by an average of 106 g between full term and late
term16 and is associated with higher test scores, educational
attainment, and wages17-21 [also P Bharadwaj, PhD, J Eber-
hard, PhD, C Neilson, PhD, unpublished data, 2013]), chil-
drenbornlatetermmaysubsequentlydemonstratehighercog-
nitive functioning, even if they initially face greater risks of
health complications during the perinatal period.17,18,22 In-
deed, recent evidence23 indicates that late-term gestation is
associated with mental and psychomotor development at 3,
6, and 12 months. In addition, social scientists have estab-
lished that effects not seen on average may still be present in
the extremes of the distribution24,25; therefore, increased ges-
tation could have particularly strong effects on the likelihood
that a child will be intellectually gifted or, alternatively, cog-
nitively impaired. We therefore hypothesized that late-term
infants may have worse perinatal outcomes but may exhibit
better cognitive outcomes later in childhood. We also inves-
tigated whether worse physical health observed at birth per-
sisted later in childhood.
We used birth records matched with school records for all
singletons born between 1994 and 2002 in Florida to study
these questions. We investigated the association between
ACOG’
s3termpregnancygroups(earlyterm,fullterm,andlate
term) and scores at ages 8 through 15 on the Florida Compre-
hensive Assessment Test (FCAT), the state’
s criterion-
referenced examination administered for assessing students,
teachers, and schools universally and annually to third-grade
through tenth-grade students. We also studied the probabil-
ity of being intellectually gifted or physically disabled (ie, hav-
ing orthopedic, speech, or sensory impairment or being hos-
pitalboundorhomebound)orhavingapoorcognitiveoutcome
(ie, performing below the fifth percentile on the FCAT or hav-
ing a serious disability that exempts the child from being
tested). We also analyzed whether these associations dif-
fered by maternal education level. Studying the heteroge-
neousdevelopmentalassociationsofgestationisimportantbe-
causedifferentsociodemographicsubgroupshavedifferentrisk
factors; infants from families with a low socioeconomic sta-
tus often experience reduced birth weight, poor nutrition, im-
pairedimmunitydevelopment,andincreasedexposuretohaz-
ardous or stressful environments.26-29 This study provides
information about whether the late-term pregnancy defini-
tion currently being recommended on the basis of perinatal
health conditions can be validated using longer-term child-
hood cognitive and physical outcomes.
Florida is an appropriate location to study these ques-
tions because it is a large state with a heterogeneous popula-
tion; 45% of mothers are racial or ethnic minorities and 23%
are foreign-born. Florida’
s educational data warehouse is also
among the most comprehensive in the United States. There-
fore, Florida offers a unique opportunity to study long-term
cognitive and physical outcomes associated with gestation
using linked health and education data.
Methods
Data
Our study sample was composed of all singleton children
born in Florida between 1994 and 2002 and educated in
Florida public schools. After rigorous review of Family Edu-
cational Rights and Privacy Act and Health Insurance Porta-
bility and Accountability Act regulations, as well as institu-
tional review board approval from Northwestern University,
the University of Florida, and Florida’
s education and health
agencies, the Florida agencies matched children by first and
last names, date of birth, and Social Security number.
Informed consent was waived because data were deidenti-
fied for analysis. Common variables excluded from the
match were used as checks of match quality.
Between 1994 and 2002, 1 442 590 singleton births with
gestations between 37 and 41 weeks were recorded by the
Florida Bureau of Vital Statistics. Of these children, 1 153 716

Key Points
Question Are cognitive and physical outcomes at school age
better or worse for late-term infants compared with full-term
infants?
Findings In this observational study using population-level
matched birth and school data from Florida, late-term infants had
better cognitive outcomes in school but higher rates of physical
disability than full-term infants. The results were particularly
pronounced in disadvantaged families.
Meaning Long-term outcomes indicate that late-term delivery
may be more beneficial for low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancies
than was previously thought based on proximate birth outcomes.

til school age, attended a Florida public school, and had school
records indicating their performance on the FCAT and their Ex-
ceptional Student Education classification. Our calculations
from the American Community Survey, a 1% representative
sample of the US population, indicated that 80.9% of 5-year-
olds born in Florida remained in Florida and attended public
school.30 Because this match rate is nearly identical to the
80.0% rate at which school records were matched to data from
the Florida Bureau of Vital Statistics, we concluded that vir-
tuallyallpotentiallymatchablechildrenwerematched.Among
matched children, 963 368 of 1 153 716 (83.5%) had math and
reading scores on the FCAT, 171 903 (14.9%) left Florida pub-
lic schools before the first tested grade, and 18 445 (1.6%) were
ineligible to take the FCAT, missed the test for some other un-
specified reason, or had not yet reached the third grade by the
2012-2013schoolyear.Wematched320 559of398 559(80.4%)
of early-term infants, 716 085 of 896 301 (79.9%) of full-term
infants, and 117 072 of 147 690 (79.3%) of late-term infants.
Differences in covariates between the Florida population
of births and those matched to Florida public school records
are reported in Table 1. Compared with the overall popula-
tion of children born in Florida, children observed in Florida
public schools were more likely to be black (25.1% vs 22.1%),
have younger mothers (13.5% vs 12.0%) with lower education
levels(22.4%belowhighschooleducationvs20.0%),andhave
unmarried mothers (38.9% vs 34.9%).
Clinical estimates of gestational age are recorded in the
birth certificate. Of the children with matched birth and school
records, 255 056 of 1 009 006 (25.3%) were early-term in-
fants (37 or 38 weeks’gestation), 566 292 (56.1%) were full-
terminfants(39or40weeks’gestation),and91 438(9.1%)were
late-term infants (41 weeks’gestation). Additionally, 81 434
(8.1%) of matched births were preterm (<37 weeks’gestation)
and 14 786 (1.5%) were postterm (>41 weeks’gestation).
Methods
We examined 3 cognitive outcome variables: (1) average FCAT
score at ages 8 through 15 years, standardized at the grade and
year level for the entire population and matched to school rec-
ords to have a mean (SD) of 0 (1) to facilitate interpretation of
effect sizes; (2) whether a child was classified as gifted, de-

superior intellectual development and is capable of high
performance”31; and (3) whether a child had a poor cognitive
outcome,definedaseitherscoringwithinthelowest5%ofper-
formers in the state or having a disability that prevented the
child from taking the FCAT. These latter 2 variables, repre-
senting high or low cognitive outcomes, were expressed in
terms of probability. We also examined 2 physical outcomes:
(1) whether abnormal conditions of the newborn were ob-
served in the birth record (most commonly, assisted ventila-
tion, hyaline membrane disease/respiratory distress, and me-
conium aspiration syndrome) and (2) whether physical
disabilities (an orthopedic, speech, or sensory impairment or
being hospitalbound or homebound) were observed in the stu-
dent’
s record. These variables were also expressed in terms of
probability.
We used linear and logistic regression methods with ges-
tational age categorical variables to assess the association be-
tween the 3 gestational age groups (early term, full term, and
late term) and the 5 outcome variables. We set the mean value
of each outcome to 0 for the full-term infant group so that the
results represented differences relative to a full-term refer-
ence group. Because family background characteristics influ-
ence gestational age, we controlled for maternal race/
ethnicity, age at birth, educational level, neighborhood income
level via zip code at time of birth, marital and immigration sta-
tuses, and number of previous births as well as child’
s sex and
birth month and year to disentangle the effects of gestational
age from socioeconomic conditions. Thus, the estimates of the
association between gestational age and the 5 outcomes are in-
dependent of observed family background characteristics. We
further stratified by maternal education to gauge differences in
associations by 1 measure of socioeconomic status. All analy-
ses were performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp).32
Results
Gestational Age Groups
Table 2 displays the association between gestational age and
test scores, gifted status, and poor cognitive outcomes, as well
as abnormal conditions recorded on the birth records and
physical disabilities in school. Late-term infants outper-
formedfull-terminfantsalongall3cognitivedimensions.Late-
term infants scored 0.7% of a standard deviation (95% CI,
0.001-0.013;P = .02)higheronstandardizedteststhandidfull-
term infants and were 2.8% more likely to be gifted (95% CI,
0.4-5.2; P = .02) and 3.1% less likely to have poor cognitive out-
comes (95% CI, 0.0-6.1; P = .05) relative to full-term infants.
While modest in magnitude, these differences are not trivial;
all cognitive differences between late-term and full-term in-
fantswereaboutone-halfthedifferenceobservedbetweenfull-
term and early-term infants (0.7% of an SD higher test scores
vs 1.5%; 2.8% higher rate of gifted vs 4.5%; and 3.1% lower rate
of poor cognitive outcomes vs 7.0%). On the other hand, late-
term infants had 6% higher rates of abnormal conditions at
birth (P < .001) and 2.1% higher rates of physical disabilities
at school age (95% CI, −0.3 to 4.5; P = .08) than full-term in-
fants. The difference in the rate of physical disability be-
tween late-term and full-term infants was also about one-
third the difference observed between full-term and early-
term infants (2.1% higher rate of physical disability vs 6.7%).
High cognitive outcomes and physical disabilities frequently
overlapped. There was no difference between children with
and without physical disabilities in the probability of high test
scores, although children with physical disabilities tended to
have a higher rate of very low test scores.
Potential Biases Due to Gestational Age Mismeasurement
One might be concerned that these results are due to mismea-
surement of gestational age. There exists considerable evi-
dence that gestational age is often mismeasured.33-35 We have
no way of knowing precisely what factors clinicians used when
determining the clinical estimate of gestational age that ap-
pears on the birth certificates, but we conducted sensitivity
analyses to identify 2 groups of families where we expected
measurement to be better. First, we limited the analysis to the
94.5% of mothers who spoke English or Spanish at home ac-
cording to school records (Table 2). We believe that these in-
dividuals were more likely to have fewer language barriers
wheninteractingwithclinicians.Second,welimitedtheanaly-
sis to the 83.7% of pregnancies in which prenatal care began
in the first trimester, as we suspected that gestation was more
likely to be correctly dated when prenatal care began early
(Table 2). In both cases, the cognitive advantage for late-term
gestations is stronger than those observed in the overall popu-
lation, suggesting that mismeasurement of gestational age bi-
ases the estimated cognitive advantage for late-term gesta-
tion toward 0.
Potential Biases Due to Selection
One might also be concerned that there is selection into ges-
tational age groups for some groups of pregnancies that are ex-
pectantly managed. Table 2 excludes observations with a high
degree of pregnancy risk,36 specifically children with congen-
ital anomalies (most commonly, cleft lip or palate; polydac-
tyly,syndactyly,oradactylyheartmalformations;clubfoot;and
Down syndrome) regardless of whether there were recorded
maternal health or previous pregnancy problems. Table 2 ad-
ditionallyexcludesobservationsinwhichthemotherwasolder
than 35 years and those in which there was an observed labor
or delivery complication (most commonly, moderate or heavy
meconium, breech or malpresentation, and fetal distress),
which often led to planned deliveries. While estimates vary
across specification for abnormal conditions and physical dis-
abilities, they remain very stable with regard to the 3 cogni-
tive outcomes.
Table 2 presents results from the subset (41.6%) of cases
in which all of the selection conditions were met (ie, pregnan-
ciesinwhichmismeasurementwaslowerbecauseprenatalcare
commencedinthefirsttrimesterandbecausethemotherspoke
English or Spanish and in which selection was less likely to be
an issue because none of the risk factors considered were pres-
ent). We continue to find that children born late term have
higher test scores and higher rates of being labeled gifted as
well as higher rates of physical disability than children born

comes is no longer statistically significant at conventional lev-
els because of the higher standard errors (4% lower; P = .12),
and the estimated increase in abnormal conditions seen in the
full population is not observed in this “cleanest” subset (0.5%
higher; P = .90).
Heterogeneity by Family Background
We investigated the degree to which the different gestational
age results in childhood cognition and health were similar
across maternal education groups. Table 3 stratifies the data
bymaternaleducationgroupsandbypregnanciesinwhichpre-
natal care started in the first trimester, when gestational dat-
ing is more likely to be accurate. Both the estimated cognitive
gains as well as the estimated physical disabilities associated

in outcomes between full-term and late-term infants appeared
greaterforlow-educationvshigh-educationfamilies.Thesepat-
terns of findings are present in cases in which we restrict analy-
sis to low-risk, uncomplicated pregnancies (and less chance of
selectionintogestationalagegroup)andtopregnanciesinwhich
gestational age is less likely to be misclassified.
Discussion
The present study has several limitations. While we con-
trolled for a wide range of covariates to reduce the risk of se-
lection bias and performed sensitivity analyses on the subset
of the population that had low-risk and uncomplicated preg-
nancies, which are less likely to have planned deliveries, it is
possiblethatourresultsmaynotaccuratelyrepresentthestudy
population. It may be the case that families with some unmea-
sured advantage were more likely to continue their pregnan-
cies to late term and that the findings reported herein reflect
thisunmeasuredcharacteristicofadvantagedfamilies.Wealso
do not know which births were induced or performed with
scheduled cesarean sections. In addition, while we at-
tempted in several ways to identify pregnancies in which ges-
tational age was more likely to be correctly measured, our re-
sults may be driven in part by mismeasurement of gestational
age. For instance, if clinical estimates of gestation were based
on ultrasound estimates, then these estimates could in part be
a proxy for measures of infant size. An ideal study would be
able to make use of hospital– or other institution–specific prac-
tice differences to have an exogenous source of variation to as-
certain the causal consequences of gestation and more pre-
cise measurement of conception dates. However, we know of
no data that can provide these ideal features at present.
There are other possible selection issues that we cannot di-
rectlyaddresswiththematchedhealth-educationdata.First,chil-
dren who died prematurely could not be included into the
matched data set. However, we observed from linked birth and
infant death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention for Florida births between 1995 and 2002 that while
early-term infants were more likely to die as a neonate or in in-
fancy than full-term infants, there was no observed difference
between late-term and full-term infants (and in fact, late-term
infantsareslightlylesslikelytodieininfancy).Second,itispos-
siblethatourresultscouldbeaffectedbydifferentialratesofan-
tepartumstillbirth.However,wedonothaveaccesstodatathat
allow us to determine the extent, if any, of this potential bias.
Conclusions
Our findings that cognitive and physical outcomes are better
for full-term infants than early-term infants provide further
confirmation of the recommendation by ACOG and other
groups to avoid scheduling elective, nonmedically indicated
inductionsoflaborbefore39weeks’gestation,usingmorethor-
ough and complete data than have generally been available in
the extant literature. Our linkage of birth data to school rec-
ords suggests that there may be a previously undocumented
