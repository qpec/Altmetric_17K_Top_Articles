Loss of cardiomyocytes is a major cause of heart failure, and while the adult heart has a
limited capacity for cardiomyogenesis, little is known about what regulates this ability or
whether it can be effectively harnessed. Here we show that 8 weeks of running
exercise increase birth of new cardiomyocytes in adult mice (~4.6-fold). New cardiomyocytes
are identified based on incorporation of 15N-thymidine by multi-isotope imaging mass
spectrometry (MIMS) and on being mononucleate/diploid. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that exercise after myocardial infarction induces a robust cardiomyogenic response in an
extended border zone of the infarcted area. Inhibition of miR-222, a microRNA increased by
exercise in both animal models and humans, completely blocks the cardiomyogenic exercise
response. These findings demonstrate that cardiomyogenesis can be activated by exercise
in the normal and injured adult mouse heart and suggest that stimulation of endogenous
cardiomyocyte generation could contribute to the benefits of exercise.

raditionally the adult mammalian heart was viewed as
having negligible capacity for cardiomyogenesis. While we
now recognize the adult heart has some regenerative
capacity, its extent has been a topic of considerable controversy.
Quantitation
of
cardiomyogenesis
is
challenging
because
cardiomyocytes are frequently polyploid and multinucleated1 and
many experimental approaches cannot distinguish generation of a
second nucleus or ploidization from true mitotic events. Classical
methods
for
studying
cardiomyocyte
proliferation
use
antibodies raised against mitotic markers and microscopy to
visualize cell division. These methods are broadly applicable, but
are susceptible to technical variability and present challenges for
quantifying rare events such as a transient expression of
cell cycle markers. A major benefit of multi-isotope imaging mass
spectrometry
(MIMS)
is
that
it
enables
high-resolution
quantification
of
prospectively-administered,
non-radioactive
stable isotope tracers, which do not interfere with biochemical
reactions2,3. Importantly, we previously demonstrated that mea-
surement of stable isotope tracers of DNA synthesis with MIMS
enables quantitative discrimination between DNA repair and
mitosis, as DNA repair incorporates orders of magnitude less
thymidine
than
cell
mitosis3.
Multiple
studies
have
used
quantitative analyses of DNA isotope labeling to demonstrate a
similar
baseline
rate
of
cardiomyogenesis
in
adult
humans4,5 and mice3. However, whether this basal level of car-
diomyogenesis can be enhanced by physiological stimuli remains
unclear.
This issue has considerable clinical importance since many
cardiac diseases are associated with loss of cardiomyocytes in the
adult heart6,7. In animal models, a remarkably modest attrition of
cardiomyocytes (as few as 23 per 10,000 cells) is sufficient to
induce fatal heart failure8. This is quantitatively similar to the
number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes seen in human heart fail-
ure9,10. Thus, a modest imbalance between the loss and birth of
cardiomyocytes in the adult heart could have profound implica-
tions for cardiac health, and continuous stimulation of cardio-
myogenesis might counteract age-related loss of cardiomyocytes.
Repetitive exercise protects the heart from disease, with an
impact similar to many drug interventions11–14, although the
basis for these benefits is incompletely understood. Regular
exercise enhances cardiac function and increases myocardial
mass, an effect that has historically been ascribed exclusively to
increased
cardiomyocyte
size15,16.
Expression
profiling
of
exercised
hearts
identified
an
increase
in
transcription
factors associated with cell cycle progression17. Cardiomyocyte
markers of proliferation were also increased17,18. However, these
studies did not account for ploidy and multinucleation, nor
did they distinguish DNA repair from cell cycle activity;
consequently this work was viewed as hypothesis-generating and
inconclusive19.
To definitively address whether exercise increases the birth
of cardiomyocytes, here we study the effects of monitored
voluntary exercise in mice with or without ischemic injury by
analyzing genomic 15N-thymidine incorporation with MIMS,
combined with cardiomyocyte nuclei tracing to assess nucleation
and in situ hybridization to quantify ploidy. We find that
voluntary running exercise significantly increases the number
of 15N-thymidine labeled, mononuclear, diploid, cardiomyocytes
in
normal
adult
and
injured
mouse
hearts,
indicating
exercise
stimulates
cardiomyogenesis.
Mechanistically,
we
show that the exercise-induced
increase in cardiomyocyte
15N-thymidine labeling can be abolished by inhibition of
miR-222,
a
microRNA
increased
by
exercise
in
both
animal
models
and
humans.
We
conclude
that
exercise
stimulates cardiomyogenesis in the injured and uninjured adult
mouse heart and that miR-222 is necessary for the cardiomyo-
genic response.
Results
Exercise enhances 15N-thymidine-positive cells in the heart. We
subjected young adult C57Bl/6 mice (2 months old) to 8 weeks of
monitored voluntary wheel running (averaging 5.57 ± 0.63 km/
day, mean ± s.e.m.) with continuous infusion of 15N-thymidine.
Consistent
with
previous
studies17,20,
exercised
mice
demonstrated physiologic cardiac remodeling characterized by
increased cardiac mass (Supplementary Fig. 1a), augmented
echocardiographic
(Supplementary
Fig.
1b),
and
cellular
measures of hypertrophy (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). Messenger
RNA analysis also confirmed an increased alpha/beta myosin
heavy chain (MYH6/MYH7) ratio consistent with physiological
hypertrophy (Supplementary Fig. 1e). No signs of systolic
dysfunction or increased apoptosis were detected in the hearts
of exercised mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). As previously
described2,3, we leveraged the sub-organelle resolution of MIMS,
that allowed detection of characteristic ultrastructures, such as
sarcomeres, to quantify incorporation of 15N-thymidine within
cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1a). We analyzed 1209 cardiomyocytes from
four sedentary mice compared with 1130 cardiomyocytes from
four exercised mice. Cardiomyocyte nuclei that underwent DNA
synthesis during the labeling period were identified by 15N
labeling. These cells displayed a stereotypical pattern of peripheral
heterochromatin and a distinct nucleolus (Fig. 1a). We observed a
low frequency of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in sedentary
control mice (1.24% = 0.02% per day), consistent with our
previous results3. However, exercised mice had a significantly
higher fraction of 15N-thymidine labeled cardiomyocytes (3.62%
= 0.06% per day, p = 0.0003, Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio
(OR) = 2.997, confidence interval (CI) 1.65–5.45) (Fig. 1b, c). In
conjunction with the increase in cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis,
we also detected an increase in 15N-thymidine labeled non-
cardiomyocytes (non-CMs) in exercised hearts compared to
sedentary controls (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To determine if this
increase in 15N-thymidine labeled non-CMs was accompanied by
an exercise-induced neo-angiogenic response, we analyzed the
capillary
density
by
immunohistochemistry
and
found
an
increased number of capillaries per cardiomyocyte following
exercise training (4.14 ± 0.07 vs. 3.75 ± 0.08 capillaries/cardio-
myocyte in exercised vs. sedentary controls, mean ± s.e.m.,
p < 0.05, two-sided t test) (Supplementary Fig. 2d). These findings
are consistent with exercise-induced angiogenesis, which has been
previously described21,22.
Exercise induces cardiomyogenesis. To account for the poly-
ploidy and multinucleation that can be seen in cardiomyocytes1,3,
particularly during hypertrophic growth23, we performed cardi-
omyocyte tracing on serial periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-stained
sections
in
both
directions
to
the
15N-thymidine-labeled
cardiomyocyte nuclei to define the number of nuclei contained
in each cell (Fig. 2a). We then utilized in situ hybridization
targeting the Y-chromosome in adjacent sections to assess ploidy
of each 15N-thymidine labeled cardiomyocyte nucleus (Fig. 2a).
Although we identified polyploid (≥4n) and binucleated 15N-
thymidine cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2b), we also observed a higher
frequency of diploid/mononucleated 15N-thymidine-labeled cells
in exercised hearts relative to those from sedentary mice (Fig. 2c),
consistent with an exercise-mediated increase in cardiomyogen-
esis (1.15% vs. 0.25%, p = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test, OR = 4.695, Cl
1.44–15.53)
(Fig.
2c).

 the same hearts (Fig. 2d). Although rare, we also found
15N-thymidine
labeled
cardiomyocytes
with
a
disturbed
sarcomere structure and two adjacent nuclei that appeared to
have completed cytokinesis at the time of tissue harvest
(Supplementary
Fig.
2e).
Taken
together,
these
results
demonstrate that regular exercise over 8 weeks increased
cardiomyogenesis. The numbers translate into a 4.6-fold increase
in cardiomyogenesis in exercised animals (0.25% per 8 weeks =
0.0045% per day in sedentary vs. 1.15% per 8 weeks = 0.021%
per
day
in
exercised
animals).
These
data
suggest
that
the exercised heart is capable of generating new cardiomyocytes
at a projected annual rate of 7.5% vs. 1.63% in sedentary
conditions.
Exercise after MI increases the area of proliferation. Exercise
mitigates adverse remodeling when initiated after myocardial
infarction (MI) in animal models25–27 and humans28, attenuating
fibrosis,
dilatation,
and
cardiac
dysfunction,
although
the
mechanisms
are
incompletely
understood.
We
sought
to
determine whether exercise-induced cardiomyogenesis could
contribute to the benefits of exercise after ischemic injury. Young
adult mice underwent experimental MI by ligation of the left
anterior descending artery followed by voluntary running or
sedentary activity, started 24 h after ischemic injury with con-
tinuous labeling with 15N-thymidine for 8 weeks during the
exercise regimen. We have previously shown that cardiomyocyte
cell cycle activity increases in the peri-infarct region3. In this
study, we confirmed this increase in the peri-infarct region in
15N-thymidine labeled cardiomyocytes in both sedentary (22.8%)
and exercised (20.4%) mice, consistent with our previous data,
but with no significant difference between the two groups
(Fig. 3a–c). Distinct from the peri-infarct region, exercise led to a
substantially
higher
proportion
of
15N-thymidine
labeled
cardiomyocytes over 8 weeks in the extended border zone region
(>400 μm from infarct) (19.1% 15N-thymidine labeled cardio-
myocytes in exercised vs. 5.3% in sedentary mice, p < 0.0001,
Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 3d). When examining the nucleation and
ploidy status of 15N-thymidine labeled cardiomyocytes in this
extended border region, we found a higher frequency of diploid/

consistent with an exercise-mediated increase in cardiomyogen-
esis (0.4% vs. 2.7% of total cardiomyocytes, p = 0.004, Fisher’s
exact test, OR = 6.931, CI 1.87–30.83) (Fig. 3f). The higher fre-
quency of proliferating cells in the remote area, has also been
observed after MI in mice exposed to hypoxia29. Transgenic
activation of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in animals
improves cardiac function after infarction30. Thus, the exercise-
induced cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity seen after MI would be
expected to favorably influence cardiac remodeling and likely
contributes to the well-documented benefits of exercise in this
setting25–28.
Inhibition of miR-222 blocks exercise-induced cardiac growth.
To explore the mechanism of the cardiomyogenic exercise
response, we studied the role of miR-222, a microRNA (miRNA)
that increases in response to exercise in both animal models and
humans, and plays an important role in the cardiovascular effects
of exercise18,31. Although our prior work had suggested a role for
miR-222 in cardiomyocyte proliferation18, these studies were
based on work in neonatal rather than adult cardiomyocytes, and
proliferation markers that could not unambiguously identify
mitotic events in vivo18. First, we confirmed that voluntary wheel
running induced miR-222 expression in the adult mouse heart
(Fig. 4a). Next, we inhibited miR-222 upregulation by weekly
injection of a sequence-specific locked nucleic acid inhibitor
(LNA)-anti-miR-222, together with 15N-thymidine administra-
tion during the 8-week voluntary exercise protocol. Exercised
mice injected with scrambled LNA-anti-miR (LNA-Ctr) and
sedentary mice treated with LNA-anti-miR-222 served as con-
trols. After 8 weeks of voluntary wheel running, LNA-Ctr treated
mice developed physiologic cardiac hypertrophy (Fig. 4b). The
cardiac hypertrophic response was attenuated in exercised mice
treated with LNA-anti-miR-222, confirming that miR-222 is
necessary for exercise-induced cardiac growth even over longer
duration (8 weeks) than previously examined18. To determine

Fig. 3 Exercise induces cardiomyogenesis in an extended MI border zone. Mice were subjected to experimental myocardial infarction (MI) by ligation of the
left anterior descending artery and exposed to exercise or sedentary activity for 8 weeks, starting 24 h post surgery. Subcutaneous osmotic pumps were
implanted to continuously label mice with 15N-thymidine for eight weeks following surgery. a Myocardial ischemic injury results in extensive DNA synthesis
in the peri-infarct area. 15N:14N hue-saturation-intensity image (HSI mosaic) (left) demonstrates 15N+ cells while 14N mass image (center) and PAS staining
(right) demonstrate presence of cardiomyocytes (white arrow) and a visible scar/fibrosis (dark purple PAS staining, red asterisks). The HSI mosaic scale
ranges from blue, where the ratio is equivalent to natural ratio (0% above natural ratio (enrichment over natural ratio)), to red, where the ratio is 150%
above natural ratio. Scale bar = 60 μm. b Representative magnifications from the peri-infarct and extended border zone areas. Mass 14N image (top left,

 whether miR-222 also mediates exercise-induced cardiomyogen-
esis, we compared the frequency of
15N-thymidine labeled
cardiomyocytes
in
exercised
hearts
after
treatment
with
either LNA-anti-miR-222 or LNA-Ctr (Fig. 4c, d). Interestingly,
miR-222 inhibition fully prevented the increase in 15N-thymidine
incorporation in response to exercise (Fig. 4c, d). miR-222 inhi-
bition also led to a more modest induction in exercise-induced
15N-thymidine-positive non-CMs (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To further explore the mechanisms by which miR-222
regulates
exercise-induced
cardiomyogenesis,
we
performed
quantitative
gene
expression
analysis
from
sedentary
and
exercised mouse hearts for relevant genes previously validated
as direct targets of miR-22218. Our data demonstrate that after
8 weeks of endurance exercise, HIPK1 gene expression remained
significantly inhibited, without a significant change in p27 or
HIPK2
expression
(Fig.
4e).
Moreover,
HIPK1
expression
increased significantly with miR-222 inhibition (Fig. 4f) (which
abolished exercise-induced cardiomyogenesis) while p27 and
HIPK2 expression did not. Taken together with our previously
published data demonstrating that HIPK1 is a direct target of
miR-222 with anti-proliferative effects in cardiomyocytes18, these
data strongly suggest that HIPK1 contributes to miR-222’s
modulation of exercise-induced cardiomyogenesis.

 We further investigated other pathways recently linked to
cardiomyocyte proliferation. For example, we examined a panel
of hypoxia-induced genes32,33, and found an increase in Slc2a
(GLUT1) and LDHA expression after 8 weeks of exercise,
pointing to a significant metabolic adjustment potentially due
to increased Hif1a activity (Fig. 5a). However, these changes were
not significantly affected by miR-222 inhibition suggesting they
do not contribute to miR-222’s modulation of cardiomyogenesis
(Fig. 5b). In contrast, we did find that miR-222 inhibition
increased expression of CCNG2 (cyclin G2), a relevant cell cycle
regulator, but could not find CCNG2 as a predicted miR-222
target (through Pictar and Targetscan). We went on to specifically
check CCNG2 expression in miR-222 overexpressing neonatal rat
ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs), and found an increase in
CCNG2 expression, strongly suggesting that this is not a direct
miR-222 target (Fig. 5c).
Cell cycle regulators that are reportedly downstream effectors
of the Hippo pathway, another pathway implicated in cardio-
myocyte proliferation, were increased in exercised hearts. While
CDK1, CCNB1, and TEAD2, for example, were all upregulated
with exercise (Fig. 5d), miR-222 inhibition caused further
increase of those Hippo/cell cycle regulators (Fig. 5e). We

the role of the Hippo pathway in endurance exercise although

Discussion
Our data collectively demonstrate that regular running exercise
stimulates an increase in new cardiomyocyte formation, and
support the idea that exercise can activate the adult mammalian
heart’s endogenous capacity to regenerate. Moreover, these stu-
dies indicate that miR-222, and potentially other miR-222-
independent cell cycle regulators, are necessary for exercise-
induced cardiomyogenesis and suggest that enhanced cardiac
regeneration may contribute to the benefits of exercise after
myocardial injury. Our observations raise the intriguing possi-
bility that this is a more general effect of exercise, and that
identifying the signals responsible could have therapeutic impli-
cations. Repeated exercise could favorably shift the balance
between cardiomyocyte birth and loss. Although the extent of
cardiomyogenesis remains limited, the relative increase is sig-
nificant (~4.6-fold) and the number of new cardiomyocytes
formed is much greater than the modest number of apoptotic
cardiomyocytes sufficient to cause lethal heart failure8 and thus
seems likely to influence these outcomes. However, one limitation
of this study is that the exercise regimen the mice underwent is
difficult to compare to human exercise scenarios. Understanding

 the long-term impact of exercise on cardiomyocytes and
responsible mechanisms may provide new insights into cardiac
regeneration and new opportunities for intervention.
Methods
Mice. All mice were maintained and studied using protocols in accordance with
the Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals and approved by Harvard
University (protocol number 16-05-273) and Massachusetts General Hospital
(protocol number 2015 N000029) Animal Care and Use Committees. Two-month-
old male C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Charles River.
Running exercise protocol and 15N-thymidine labeling. Starting at an age of
2 months, osmotic minipumps (Alzet) were implanted subcutaneously, delivering
15N-thymidine (Cambridge Isotopes) at a rate of 20 μg h−1 and exchanged weekly
for 8 weeks. Mice were individually housed in plexiglass cages (36 L × 20 W × 15 H
cm) that contained a stainless-steel running wheel (diameter 11.4 cm; Mini-Mitter,
Starr Life Science, USA) equipped with a tachometer. Mice ran voluntarily. Mouse
activity and cardiac hypertrophy response was controlled for by recording daily
running and morphometric analysis. The sedentary control mice were kept in the
same cage system lacking running wheels.
Experimental myocardial infarction. Mice were subjected to experimental MI.
Surgeries were performed by a single operator with >20 years of experience in the
performance of coronary ligation in rodents. In brief, the animals were anesthetized
with isoflurane, intubated, and ventilated. After the thoracic cavity was opened, the
left anterior descending coronary artery was permanently ligated approximately 2
mm below the left atrial appendage. The chest was closed and an osmotic mini-
pump (Alzet) administrating 15N-thymidine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at a
rate of 20 μg h−1, was implanted subcutaneously and the animal was placed in
recovery. The pump was exchanged weekly for 8 weeks.
miR-222 inhibition. LNA-anti-miR injections were performed as previously
described18. Two-month-old C57Bl/6 male mice were subcutaneously injected with
10 mg kg−1 of LNA-modified anti-miR-222 (LNA-anti-miR-222) or scrambled
control (LNA-Ctr) reconstituted in saline for three consecutive days after osmotic
pump implantation and then weekly after pump exchanges throughout the
experiment. LNA-anti-miR oligonucleotides were purchased from Exicon.
Echocardiographic studies. Echocardiography was performed on conscious mice
by using a GE Vivid E90 with a L8-18i-D probe. Parasternal long-axis views, short-
axis views, and two-dimensional-guided M-mode images of short axis at the
papillary muscle level were recorded. The average of at least three measurements
was used for every data point from each mouse.
Sample preparation and MIMS data acquisition and analysis. Tissues were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), embedded in LR (London resin) white,
sectioned (0.5–1 μm), and mounted on silicon chips. MIMS analyses were con-
ducted with ion microscopy (NanoSIMS 50 and a large-radius NanoSIMS 50L,
Cameca) as described previously2,3. Briefly, a focused Cs+ ion beam (size <100 nm)
is rastered over the sample surface. The impact of the Cs+ ion beam on the sample
surface generates the sputtering of multiple secondary ions from the probed
nanovolume (corresponding to a pixel in the image). For each nanovolume, the
secondary-ion intensities for 12C−, 12C14N−, 12C15N−, and 31P− were recorded in
parallel. The detection of nitrogen requires the use of poly-atomic ions 12C14N−
and 12C15N− as a proxy for 14N and 15N. A hue-saturation-intensity transfor-
mation of the 12C15N−/12C14N− ratio image provides a visual representation of
regions where the ratio is above natural abundance (natural 15N/14N 0.37%),
indicative of 15N-thymidine labeling. Observers blinded to group assignment
performed cardiomyocyte counts as well as the following analyses.
Nucleation and cell volume analysis. Serial sections (0.5–1 μm) were cut from LR
white embedded heart to cover up to 100 μm of tissue below and above the section
that was mounted on the chip. Sections were stained with a modified PAS
staining protocol to identify individual cardiomyocytes. Slides were immersed for
2 × 30 min in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols, incubated in Periodic
acid solution overnight and then in Schiff’s reagent for two nights, washed, and
dehydrated and cleared before mounting. Slides were imaged on a NanoZoomer
Whole Slide Scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics). Magnified PAS image in Fig. 3a was
taken on Airy Scan LSM800 with Axiocam color camera (Zeiss). To analyze
nucleation, 15N-thymidine-positive cardiomyocytes were tracked by locating the
cardiomyocyte in every section of the serial above and below the level of the
nucleus for as long as it was present. The total number of nuclei was counted for
each cell. PAS-stained sections were also used to confirm cells labeled as cardio-
myocytes and non-CMs in all cohorts and adjustments have been made for mis-
labeled cells if necessary. Outlined 15N-positive cells were also used to calculate
total cellular volume.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization. Sections were incubated in 1 M sodium thio-
cyanate for 10 min at 80 °C, washed in PBS, and treated for 2 min in 0.2% Triton X
(in PBS), digested with Proteinase K (50 μg ml−1) for 30 min at 56 °C. Sections
were rinsed in 1× PBS, post-fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 5 min and treated for 10 min
with 50% formamide/4× standard saline citrate buffer at 37 °C. Slides were air-
dried and biotinylated-labeled chromosome Y paint (IDMF 1057, Empire Geno-
mics) was suspended in hybridization mix, applied to sections, and sealed under
glass with rubber cement. Samples were denatured at 69 °C for 3 min. After
overnight incubation at 42 °C, slides were washed three times with 2× standard
saline citrate buffer, two 10 min washes each with PBS containing 0.1%
Tween (PBST), all at room temperature. Samples were blocked with PBST/10%
goat serum and incubated for 1 h in streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488
(S32354, Invitrogen) before being washed and mounted. Sections were imaged on a
LSM 510 Inverted Confocal (Zeiss LSM 510) and analyzed with Zen lite software
(Zeiss).
Capillary density and cross-sectional area quantification. Hearts from animals
that underwent the above described exercise regimen but that were not used for LR
white embedding and MIMS were snap frozen in OCT (optimal cutting tem-
perature) as previously described18. Thick sections of 6 μm were cut from the
frozen tissue and placed on a glass cover slip, air-dried for 5 min, followed by a
brief 10 min fixation with fresh 4% PFA. Sections were immunofluorescently
stained with both CD31 (BD Pharmingen) and wheat germ agglutinin (488-oregon
green, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to analyze capillary density (capillaries/cardio-
myocyte) and cross-sectional area using
standard procedures. AlexaFluor (555-texas red) fluorescent dye (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was used as secondary antibody. Images were taken on a Leica SP8
confocal microscope.
Cell death assay by TUNEL staining. Slides were rehydrated through xylene and
graded concentrations of ethanol and stained for cell death using the TMR (tetra-
methylrhodamine)-red TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
end labelled) Kit (in situ cell death Detection Kit-TMR Red; Roche, Basel, Swit-
zerland) as per manufacturers instruction. Briefly, slides were incubated for 30 min
at 37 °C in 20 μg ml−1 proteinase K, washed twice in 1× PBS 5 min at room
temperature and incubated at 37 °C in a red fluorescent (TMR-red) TUNEL cell
death detection reagent. Cardiomyocytes were identified by simultaneous immu-
nostaining cardiac troponin T (1:200 dilution, ab8295, Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
After washing with 1× PBST (1× PBS added with 0.1% Tween), slides were
counterstained with DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2′-phenylindol, dichloride; Thermo
Scientific/Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) to visualize the nuclei. Finally, slides were
washed and mounted and all quantitative analyses were performed. All images
were post-processed in ImageJ (NIH) software. Approximately 14,000 troponin-T-
positive cardiomyocytes were counted for the TUNEL analysis. LR = London Resin
OCT = optimal cutting temperature TMR = Tetramethylrhodamine TUNEL =

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR. RNA was isolated from both
tissue and cell samples using Trizol (Qiagen), and phase separation followed by
column purification (Zymo Research). RNA of 1 μg was added to reverse tran-
scription reactions (Applied Bioscience) and quantitative PCR was carried out
using SYBR-green (Bio-Rad).
Cardiomyocyte isolation and culture and gene expression. Primary NRVMs
were prepared from 1- to 2-day-old rats by use of the neonatal cardiomyocyte
isolation system (Worthington Biochemical Corp.). Isolated NRVMs were purified
by Percoll gradient centrifugation and plated in 60 mm dishes at 1 × 106 cells per
well and cultured in DMEM/5% FBS/10% horse serum for 24 h. Before treatment,
NRVM were synchronized, and cultured in 0.2% FBS DMEM media. miRNA-222
as well as control precursors (pre-miR) were purchased from Invitrogen. Trans-
fection of pre-miR was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, total
RNA was isolated from treated NRVM with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to
standard protocols and submitted to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular
Diagnostics Laboratory for microarray assay using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230
v2.0. Microarray data analysis was performed with Affymetrix Microarray Data
Analysis tools.
Statistical analysis. Statistical testing was performed using Prism 3.0/7.0
(Graphpad). For echocardiographic and morphometric analyses, as well as gene
expression, cross-sectional area, capillary density, and cell death/volume,
results are presented as mean ± s.e.m. from n = 3–5 animals per group and were
compared by using two-sided t tests (significance level p < 0.05). More than two
groups were compared by using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s
correction for multiple comparisons. Data comparing event rates, i.e.,
15N-thymidine-positive and -negative cardiomyocytes and non-CMs, were
compared using Fisher’s exact test based on the total number of cells counted as
unit of analysis (significance level p < 0.05) and are presented as percentage of total
