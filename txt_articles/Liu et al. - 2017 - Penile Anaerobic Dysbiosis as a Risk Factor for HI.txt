ABSTRACT
Sexual transmission of HIV requires exposure to the virus and infection
of activated mucosal immune cells, specifically CD4� T cells or dendritic cells. The
foreskin is a major site of viral entry in heterosexual transmission of HIV. Although
the probability of acquiring HIV from a sexual encounter is low, the risk varies even
after adjusting for known HIV risk factors. The genital microbiome may account for
some of the variability in risk by interacting with the host immune system to trigger
inflammatory responses that mediate the infection of mucosal immune cells. We
conducted a case-control study of uncircumcised participants nested within a
randomized-controlled trial of male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda. Using penile (cor-
onal sulcus) swabs collected by study personnel at trial enrollment, we characterized
the penile microbiome by sequencing and real-time PCR and cytokine levels by elec-
trochemiluminescence assays. The absolute abundances of penile anaerobes at en-
rollment were associated with later risk of HIV seroconversion, with a 10-fold in-
crease in Prevotella, Dialister, Finegoldia, and Peptoniphilus increasing the odds of HIV
acquisition by 54 to 63%, after controlling for other known HIV risk factors. In-
creased abundances of anaerobic bacteria were also correlated with increased cyto-
kines, including interleukin-8, which can trigger an inflammatory response that re-
cruits susceptible immune cells, suggesting a mechanism underlying the increased
risk. These same anaerobic genera can be shared between heterosexual partners
and are associated with increased HIV acquisition in women, pointing to anaerobic
dysbiosis in the genital microbiome and an accompanying inflammatory response as
a novel, independent, and transmissible risk factor for HIV infection.
IMPORTANCE
We found that uncircumcised men who became infected by HIV dur-
ing a 2-year clinical trial had higher levels of penile anaerobes than uncircumcised
men who remained HIV negative. We also found that having higher levels of penile
anaerobes was also associated with higher production of immune factors that recruit
HIV target cells to the foreskin, suggesting that anaerobes may modify HIV risk by
triggering inflammation. These anaerobes are known to be shared by heterosexual
partners and are associated with HIV risk in women. Therefore, penile anaerobes
may be a sexually transmissible risk factor for HIV, and modifying the penile micro-
biome could potentially reduce HIV acquisition in both men and women.

educing sexual transmission is crucial to ending the HIV pandemic. Not all sexual
exposures to HIV result in productive infection, and the susceptibility of individuals
to infection can be heterogeneous (1). There are known risk factors for HIV, such as
inconsistent condom use, higher number of sexual partners, and circumcision status,
among others (2–4); however, even when these factors are combined, they do not fully
explain the heterogeneity in susceptibility (5).
The foreskin is the major site of HIV exposure and viral entry in uncircumcised
heterosexual men (2–4), and the interplay between the immune responses and genital
microbiome at this site could be an important determinant of host HIV susceptibility.
Genital inflammation promotes HIV acquisition and transmission (6, 7). In particular,
increased levels of chemoattractant cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monokine in-
duced by interferon gamma (MIG) in the penile coronal sulcus have been linked to
increased density of highly HIV-susceptible CD4� T cells in the underlying foreskin
tissue, with consequent increased HIV risk (8).
Proinflammatory responses, including at the genital mucosa (7, 9), can be elicited by
shifts in the human microbiome (9–12) and specifically, in association with dysbiosis,
which is an imbalance in the microbiome that compromises health (13, 14). Thus,
changes in the genital microbiome that provoke inflammation could facilitate infection
by pathogens, such as HIV; this may explain how a vaginal ecological imbalance could
increase HIV risk (15, 16), or how reducing penile anaerobes could decrease HIV risk
(17).
Penile anaerobes decrease significantly after medical male circumcision (17), a
procedure that also reduces HIV risk in men by 60% (2–4). In the current study, we
tested the hypothesis that penile anaerobe abundance directly increases HIV risk by
inducing proinflammatory response in the foreskin. Using a case-control study design,
we compared the microbiome and cytokine levels in the penile coronal sulci in
uncircumcised men who seroconverted (cases) and uncircumcised controls who re-
mained persistently HIV seronegative (controls) during a randomized-controlled trial of
medical male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda.
RESULTS
We assessed the associations between penile anaerobic bacteria, cytokines, and HIV
acquisition, using data from 182 uncircumcised men, 46 who became infected with HIV
(cases) and 136 who remained uninfected (controls), in a case-control study nested
within a 2-year randomized-controlled trial of male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda (2).
We focused on the 10 anaerobic genera that were most greatly reduced following male
circumcision (17) and that may play a functional role in the noted association between
male circumcision and reduced risk of HIV acquisition. These genera composed an
average 62% of the total penile bacterial load in study participants. For each anaerobic
genus of interest, we estimated its absolute abundance, measured in the number of
16S rRNA gene copies per swab, as the product of total penile bacterial load and
relative (proportional) abundance of each genus in the sample.
Men who acquired HIV had significantly higher abundances of penile anaerobes at
study baseline than men who remained HIV negative during the trial, including
Prevotella (P � 0.04), Dialister (P � 0.01), Mobiluncus (P � 0.02), Murdochiella (P � 0.04),
and Peptostreptococcus (P � 0.085) compared to the controls (see Table S1 in the
supplemental material). However, total penile bacterial loads were similar in cases and
controls at study baseline (P � 0.21). Likewise, composition of the penile microbiome
at study baseline did not differ significantly between cases and controls (P � 0.06 by
permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PerMANOVA]) (Fig. S1 and S2). Com-
paring other risk factors at baseline, we found that higher numbers of nonmarital sexual

 partners, inconsistent condom use, among other factors were associated with increased
HIV acquisition during the trial (Table 1) (2).
The risk of HIV infection increased with higher penile anaerobic bacterial abundance
in regression analyses, which was consistent with the higher baseline mean abundance
noted in men who later became infected by HIV (Fig. 1; Table S2). In unadjusted
analysis, we found remarkably consistent relationships between anaerobe abundance
and HIV seroconversion among 5 of the 10 anaerobic genera at baseline: for each
10-fold increase in the abundance of these organisms, the odds of seroconversion
increased by 28 to 40% (Fig. 1, purple bars; Table S2).
After adjustment for risk factors, the association between abundance of anaerobic
bacteria and the odds of HIV seroconversion actually strengthened (Fig. 1, whisker
plots; Table S2), indicating that the increased risk associated with higher densities of
anaerobic bacteria was independent of other risk factors. Genera associated with the
greatest risk increase in seroconversion with each 10-fold increase in abundance
included Prevotella (adjusted odds ratio [AdjOR] � 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.23 to 2.26), followed by Dialister (AdjOR � 1.57; 95% CI; 1.21 to 2.10), and six other
genera of anaerobic bacteria (Peptoniphilus, Finegoldia, Porphyromonas, Mobiluncus,
Peptostreptococcus, and Murdochiella) (Fig. 1; Table S2).
Markers of inflammation that have been associated with increased HIV risk (8),
particularly penile interleukin-8 (IL-8), increased with the abundance of penile anaero-
bic bacteria; however, the relationships were not linear (Fig. 2; Table S3). The odds of
having any levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1� [IL-1�], interleukin 8 [IL-8],

 macrophage chemoattractant 1 [MCP-1], monokine induced by interferon gamma
[MIG], macrophage inflammatory protein 3� [MIP-3�], RANTES [regulated on activation,
normal T cell expressed and secreted], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor [GM-CSF]) detected increased significantly with the densities of anaerobic bac-
teria, where the greatest risk increases were seen in having a higher number, i.e., three
or more detected cytokines in the coronal sulcus (Table 2; Fig. S3).
IL-8 was the most commonly detected cytokine among those measured. The
relationship between many anaerobic genera and IL-8 was best fit by a piecewise linear
model, suggesting a threshold effect, where strong associations with IL-8 concentra-
tions in picograms per milliliter (log10)—as indicated by the steep slope—were seen
only above specific anaerobic bacterial thresholds (i.e., the breakpoint [c]) (Fig. 2;
Table S3). Above such thresholds, we found that the concentration of IL-8—which can
initiate an inflammatory response—was significantly correlated with the absolute abun-
dances of penile anaerobes associated with higher risk of seroconversion, such as Prevotella
(slope after the breakpoint [c] used in the piecewise spline model [slopepost-c] � 0.56; c �
8 log10 copies of 16S rRNA gene per swab; r2 � 0.14), Dialister (slopepost-c � 0.35; c � 6.5
log10 copies of 16S rRNA gene per swab; r2 � 0.15), and Peptostreptococcus (slopepost-c �
1.08; c � 6.5 log10 copies of 16S rRNA gene per swab; r2 � 0.19) (Fig. 2). In contrast,
Negativicoccus, which was unrelated to HIV seroconversion, was not associated with
concentrations of IL-8 at any level of abundance (slope � �0.05; r2 � 0.03) (Fig. 2; Table S3).
DISCUSSION
High densities of anaerobic bacteria on the penis appeared to increase the risk of
HIV acquisition in men, a novel risk factor that operated independently of other known
FIG 1 Relationship between the absolute abundances of anaerobic bacteria and risk of HIV serocon-
version in the case-control study. At study baseline, each 10-fold increase in the absolute abundance
(measured in the log10-transformed number of 16S rRNA gene copies per swab) of anaerobic bacteria
Prevotella, Dialister, Finegoldia, Peptoniphilus, and Peptostreptococcus increased the odds of HIV infection.
The risk for seroconversion further increased after adjustment for age, marital status, number of
extramarital sexual partners, condom use, and genital discharge symptoms. Under each genus, the
adjusted odds ratio (i.e., the mean adjusted odds of HIV seroconversion per 10-fold increase in absolute
abundance of bacteria) and 95% confidence interval (in parentheses) are shown. Graphically, the 95%
confidence interval for the unadjusted odds ratio is shown as purple bar for each genus, and the mean
and 95% confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio is shown as a whisker plot. Detailed results can
be found in Table S2 in the supplemental material.

 risk factors that we measured. We found that as the absolute abundance of anaerobes
increased, the concentrations of chemokines in the penile coronal sulcus increased as
well, suggesting a plausible mechanism whereby anaerobic dysbiosis influences HIV
infection risk.
This study focused on the risk of HIV seroconversion associated with penile anaer-
obe abundance using samples from uncircumcised men as the trial baseline. As a result,
our study’
s estimates are likely conservative, given that the potential shift in the penile
microbiome from the study baseline to time of seroconversion is expected to attenuate
our findings. By using baseline samples, we ensured that the differences in microbiome
composition preceded HIV infection, which can have a major effect on the microbiome.
The temporal shift in the penile microbiome is expected to be limited based on our
earlier study of the penile microbiome in HIV-uninfected uncircumcised men (17).
We previously found in the same cohort of men that greater HIV risk was associated
with increased IL-8 and other chemokines in the coronal sulcus (8), and the current
work strongly suggests that the penile microbiome affects chemokine levels in the
coronal sulcus. Higher densities of anaerobic bacteria could induce the production of
the chemokine interleukin-8 (18), which primarily recruits neutrophils (19–21). Neutro-
phils can be further activated by bacterial antigens to produce MIP-3� and MCP-1,
chemokines that recruit Th17 helper T cells (22–24), a T-cell subset especially susceptible
to HIV infection (25–28). Thus, the response of the immune system to shifts in the penile
microbiome may facilitate productive infection by HIV. In other words, the genital
microbiome may influence seroconversion risk by modulating the very target of HIV
infection—the human immune system.
Anaerobic dysbiosis may be a general mechanism affecting the risk of HIV acquisi-
tion in both men and women. A similar anaerobic dysbiosis occurs in women with
bacterial vaginosis (29), which also increases their risk of HIV infection (15, 30–33). In
men, this anaerobic dysbiosis largely resolves in response to circumcision (17), an

 intervention that reduces the risk of HIV infection (2–4). Furthermore, these anaerobic
bacteria are shared by sexual partners, indicating that the dysbiosis itself is sexually
transmissible (34). Our findings explain these independent lines of evidence and
implicate sexually transmitted anaerobic dysbiosis in the genital microbiome as a risk
factor for HIV infection that is not only common to both men and women but also
sexually transmissible between them.
Our findings support the potential for novel HIV prevention strategies aimed at
reducing the abundance of high-risk genital anaerobes. While hygiene improvements
such as genital washing have not been effective in reducing HIV risk (35), narrow-
spectrum antimicrobials, such as bacteriocins, or phage therapies that eliminate specific
anaerobes (36, 37), or pre- and probiotic strategies may reduce colonization by high-
risk genital anaerobes. Such methods may be used independently or as adjuvants to
other interventions to further reduce HIV risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and sample collection. We conducted a randomized trial of male circumcision for HIV
prevention in 2004 to 2006 (2). In this study, HIV-uninfected, uncircumcised men 15 to 49 years old were
randomized to either immediate circumcision or circumcision delayed for 24 months as described
previously (2, 38). At enrollment, all consenting men provided interview information on sociodemo-
graphic, behavioral, and health characteristics and underwent a physical examination. Study participants
were provided access to regular reproductive health services and monitored 6, 12, and 24 months later
for up to 24 months to assess HIV status and sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition, as described
in detail elsewhere (2). Microbiome and cytokine data were drawn from the baseline visit.
At each visit, clinical officers collected penile swabs using premoistened Dacron swabs and rotated
twice around the full circumference of the penis at the coronal sulcus, the junction between the glans
and the shaft of the penis. The swabs were immediately placed in 1-ml Digene specimen transport
medium (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) at 4°
C for less than 4 h and then vortexed, aliquoted, and
stored at �80°
C until analysis. The study was approved by four institutional review boards (IRBs): the
Science and Ethics Committee of the Uganda Virus Research Institute (Entebbe, Uganda), the HIV
subcommittee of the National Council for Science and Technology (Kampala, Uganda), the Committee for
Human Research at Johns Hopkins University’
s Bloomberg School of Public Health (Baltimore, MD), and
the Western Institutional Review Board, the IRB of record for the Translational Genomics Research
Institute (Olympia, WA).
The current case-control study included only trial participants randomized to the delayed circumci-
sion arm of the trial, who remained uncircumcised for the duration of the trial, as medical male
circumcision can drastically alter the penile microbiome (17). Cases were defined as participants who
seroconverted during the 2-year study period, and the controls were participants who remained HIV
uninfected during the 2-year study period. Each case was matched to three controls selected at random.
Penile microbiome characterization. DNA isolation and purification were performed using the
collected coronal sulcus swabs as previously described (38). Briefly, 500 �l of 1 ml of Digene specimen
transport medium was used in DNA extraction with the QIAamp DNA blood MDx kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’
s instructions. The purified DNA was eluted into 100 �l of
Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer and stored at �80°
C until quantitative PCR (qPCR) and sequencing analyses.
The total penile bacterial load from each swab was measured using a 16S rRNA gene-based
broad-coverage qPCR targeting the V3-V4 region as described previously (34, 39) using 1 �l of purified
DNA in 10-�l reaction mixture volumes on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT fast real-time PCR system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA).
The relative abundances of penile bacteria in each coronal sulcus swab were characterized by
sequencing the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region using a two-step PCR protocol validated for samples with
low biomass. Briefly, the first PCR step incorporates Illumina MiSeq 5= sequencing primer (CS1/CS2), a
heterogeneity spacer, and 16S rRNA gene primers, and the second PCR step incorporates Illumina MiSeq
3= Flowcell Linker sequence, a 6-bp sample-specific index, and complementary sequences to the MiSeq
5= sequencing primer (CS1/CS2) from the first amplification. Additional details on amplicon sequencing
analysis can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material. The resultant amplicon library was
sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using 600 cycles to produce 300 bp paired-end reads per the
manufacturer’
s instructions (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).
The resultant paired-end reads were processed as follows. First, the reads were trimmed to retain
bases with high quality scores. The quality-checked reads were then assembled to generate a single
stitched read with dual barcodes; the single stitched reads were then assigned to the original samples
and underwent additional quality checks and trimming. The resultant binned and trimmed sequences
were dereplicated at a similarity level of 97% using USEARCH (version 5.2.32), and chimeric sequences
were removed using UCHIME (version 5.1) (40). Following this, the resultant sequences were classified at
each taxonomic level at �97% bootstrap confidence level using a web service for the Naïve Bayesian
Classifier (v.2.10) (41). Classification results for each sample are enumerated to generate an abundance
matrix for analysis. Additional details on bioinformatic analysis can be found in Text S1.
Cytokine measurement. An electrochemiluminescence detection system using a custom human
Ultra-Sensitive kit from Meso Scale Discovery (Rockville, MD) was used to assay cytokines in coronal

 sulcus swabs. All cytokines examined were detected in coronal sulcus swabs; however, as cytokine levels
other than IL-8 were generally low, we analyzed detection of the seven cytokines measured as present
or absent based on the lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) for each cytokine. IL-8 was detected in 60%
of coronal sulcus swabs (range, �1.5 to 7,405.7 pg/ml) and also analyzed as a continuous variable. The
LLoQs used in this study were as follows: 0.6 pg/ml for IL-1�, 1.5 pg/ml for IL-8, 0.6 pg/ml for MCP-1, 0.3
pg/ml for MIG, 3.0 pg/ml for MIP-3�, 0.6 pg/ml for RANTES, and 0.3 pg/ml for GM-CSF.
Absolute abundance estimation. The absolute abundance of each of the 10 anaerobic genera
shown to be reduced by male circumcision was calculated as absolute abundance � total penile
bacterial load (measured as the total number of copies of 16S rRNA gene per swab by broad-coverage
real-time PCR) � relative abundance of a specific anaerobic genus (measured as the number of 16S rRNA
gene sequences assigned to a genus in a given sample divided by the total number of 16S rRNA
sequences obtained for that sample from sequencing). Log10-transformed absolute abundance was used
in the linear and logistic models.
Statistical analysis. We compared the demographic and behavioral characteristics of cases and
controls at trial enrollment by Fisher exact test to inform adjusted models. The total penile bacterial load
and absolute abundance of 10 penile anaerobes of cases and controls were compared by Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test. Penile microbiome composition of cases and controls were compared by permutational
analysis of variance using absolute abundance data in Euclidean distance and 999 permutations. The
relationships between the abundance of penile anaerobes and risk of HIV seroconversion were assessed
using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, regressing participant status (case/control)
on the log10-transformed penile anaerobe abundance, performed separately for each genus. The
multivariate models were adjusted for age, marital status, number of extramarital sexual partners,
condom use, and genital discharge symptoms, all of which are previously established epidemiologic risk
factors (2).
The odds of having 1, 2, or �3 cytokines detected compared to no cytokines detected associated
with each 10-fold increase in bacterial abundance were determined using multinomial logistic regression
models. We also examined the relationship between foreskin IL-8 concentrations and abundance of
penile anaerobes determined using piecewise linear regression, where a single breakpoint (c) for the
spline model was empirically selected based on r2. Slope estimates (slopepre-c and slopepost-c) represent-
ing the slope before and after the breakpoint and their respective P values, as well as Akaike information
criterion (AIC) scores from comparisons of the linear model to the piecewise linear model were
presented. The underlying data trend characterized using a nonparametric b-spline function was plotted
together with the best-fitting model. All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.2.4.
