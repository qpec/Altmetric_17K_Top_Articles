Abstract
Pediatric abusive head trauma (AHT) is a leading cause of fatal child maltreatment among young 
children. Current prevention efforts have not been consistently effective. Policies, such as paid 
parental leave could potentially prevent AHT, given its impacts on risk factors for child 
maltreatment. To explore associations between California’s 2004 paid family leave (PFL) policy 
and hospital admissions for AHT, we used difference-in-difference analyses of 1995–2011 US 
state-level data before and after the policy in California and seven comparison states. Compared to 
seven states with no PFL policies, California’s 2004 PFL showed a significant decrease of AHT 
admissions in both < 1 and < 2year-olds. Analyses using additional data years and comparators 
could yield different results.

In the United States, pediatric abusive head trauma (AHT) is a leading cause of fatal child 
maltreatment among young children.[1] Survivors can suffer severe, long-term neurological 
and physical impairment.[2] The majority of victims are less than 2 years old, with peak 
incidence between 9–20 weeks.[2] This peak coincides with developmentally typical 
episodes of prolonged and inconsolable infant crying.[2]AHT prevention has primarily 
focused on providing parents of newborns with information about infant crying and the 
dangers of violent infant shaking.[2] Although such programs initially yielded promising 
results,[3] subsequent rigorous evaluation efforts failed to show reductions in serious AHT 
incidence.[4
Societal-level interventions, such as public policies, reach broader segments of the 
population and may have a longer, sustained impact on reducing child maltreatment.[5] In 
particular, paid family leave (PFL) policies that allow new mothers to delay re-entry into the 
workforce may hold promise for AHT prevention. New mothers can care for their infants

 instead of or alongside male caregivers (most perpetrators of AHT are males). Research 
based on individual-level data suggests PFL is associated, perhaps not causatively, with 
positive parental and child health outcomes, including reduced maternal depression[6] and 
preschoolers’ externalizing behaviors.[7] PFL can also reduce family stress by improving 
family income during the time leave is taken and beyond.[8]A possible mechanism to 
explain effects beyond the period of PFL is maternal stress and depression’s effects on a 
child’s hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system which alters the child’s response to stress and 
affects other systems, including emotional regulation.[9
In 2002, California enacted PFL (Senate Bill 1661), Family Temporary Disability Insurance, 
to provide wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for a 
seriously ill relative or to bond with a new child; this bill began paying benefits to eligible 
parents on July 1, 2004.[10] The state’s law provides up to six weeks of partially paid leave 
(up to 55% of employees’ wages) for employees qualifying for State Disability Insurance 
(SDI). Average benefits paid under the law ranged from $405 a week in 2004 to $526 in 
2013.[10] When taken consecutively with benefits provided by California’s SDI, employees 
have up to 12 weeks of partially paid leave after the birth of a baby. Based on previous 
evidence that PFL can reduce parental stress and depression and children’s externalizing 
behaviors (known risk factors for child maltreatment[11]), we explored the associations 
between California’s PFL policy and AHT hospital admissions. Previous analyses using an 
interrupted time series design (not reported) led to inconclusive results most likely due to 
lack of power. It also lacked controls for potential confounders. Our current analyses use a 
difference-in-difference design.
METHODS
We constructed a panel data set which included the annual data of California and 7 
comparison states. We used difference-in-difference analyses of publicly-available, state-
level data from 1995–2011 to compare the population rate of AHT hospital admissions in 
California versus other US states that had no PFL policy change before and after the policy 
change.
Data
We identified inpatient admissions with AHT diagnoses (referred to as AHT admissions) in 
the 1995–2011 Statewide Inpatient Databases (SID) from the Healthcare Cost and 
Utilization Project.[12] SID is the largest publicly-available, state-based, all-payer (i.e., 
patients with public insurance, private insurance, and no insurance), inpatient care database 
in the US, reporting all inpatient discharges annually in participating states.[12] Admissions 
were included in this analysis if a combination of International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and External Cause of Injury diagnosis codes 
indicated definite or probable AHT based on the CDC definitions.[13] We calculated the 
annual age-specific population rate of AHT admissions among children by age per 100,000 
population.[14] Data on 2002 California AHT admissions was unavailable so we 
interpolated the state’s rate that year from surrounding years’ data using Proc Expand in 
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 Our main analysis investigated AHT admissions among children < 1 year old, which 
includes the peak AHT incidence and partially coincides with parents’ paid time off under 
California’s PFL law. Given PFL’s associations with effects beyond the period of paid leave, 
we also investigated a longer-term impact from parents’ paid time off by including AHT 
admissions among children up to two years of age.
Comparison states
Each US state determines whether to release its data through SID and not all states choose to 
do so. States selected for comparisons to California were based on a combination of 
available SID data for all study years and the generosity of states’ parental leave policies. 
This resulted in a group of seven states (all those with complete data and a parental leave 
generosity rating of C or less, on a “grading” scale of A- to F from the National Partnership 
for Women and Families;[15] Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
and Wisconsin). New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington had complete data but 
were excluded because these states had B ratings; and South Carolina was excluded because 
their data had differing age groups across the study years. Table 1 summarizes parental leave 
policies in the seven selected states.
Statistical Analysis
In these regression models, the dependent variable was AHT admission rate per 100,000 
population in California and in the comparator states from 1995–2011. The policy variable 
takes the value of 0 from 1995 to 2004 and the value of 1 from 2005 (for <1 year-old model) 
and from 2006 (for < 2 year-old model) to 2011 for California and the value of 0 from 1995 
to 2011 for the 7 comparison states. In the unadjusted model, we included only the PFL 
policy variable plus the state and year dummy variables which captured time-invariant state 
characteristics and time effects common to all 8 states, respectively. In the adjusted model, 
we included two additional variables (unemployment rate and percentage of adults with 
education less than high school), to control for economic and parental factors and their 
potential impacts on AHT admissions. For both unadjusted and adjusted models, we used 
the robust standard errors which were robust to potential misspecification such as 
heteroscedasticity or within-panel serial correlation in the error term. A p-value of <.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Figure 1 demonstrates AHT admission rates for children < 1 year of age (dark gray) and < 2 
years of age (light gray) per 100,000 population in California (squares) and the comparison 
(triangles) states’ group average from 1995–2011. This figure shows increases in AHT 
admission rates starting in 2007 thru 2009 in comparator states while California’s rates 
remained relatively stable.
Table 2 reports the regression results. Our difference-in-difference analysis shows that the 
implementation of the PFL policy was significantly associated with a level decrease of 5.8 in 
the AHT admissions per 100,000 children < 1 year, when the unemployment rate and the 
percentage of adults with education less than high school were not controlled (unadjusted

 estimate). After controlling for the unemployment rate and the percentage of adults with 
education less than high school (adjusted estimate), our analysis still shows a significant 
decline; specifically, implementation of the PFL policy was associated with a decrease of 5.1 
in the AHT admissions per 100,000 children < 1 year. The changes in the AHT admissions 
per 100,000 < 2 years are similar. The implementation of the PFL policy was significantly 
associated with a level decrease of 2.8 or 3.2 in the AHT admissions per 100,000 < 2 years, 
depending on whether the unemployment rate and the percentage of adults with education 
less than high school were controlled for or not.
DISCUSSION
Given the small evidence base for policies to reduce child maltreatment and PFL’s impact 
on risk factors for child abuse, we explored the impact of California’s PFL policy on AHT 
hospitalization rates. Our difference-in-difference analyses shows that the implementation of 
the PFL policy was significantly associated with a decrease in AHT admissions in both 
children < 1 and < 2 years of age. Specifically, while the comparison states experienced 
increases in AHT rates during the years known as the Great Recession (an increase others 
have also observed[16]), California did not.
Although significant, this difference occurred despite low uptake of the policy’s benefits. 
Participation in California’s PFL policy started at 25% in the first year of implementation 
but remains low—just 38% of eligible parents in 2014.[10] In addition, those at higher risk 
for perpetrating AHT (i.e., non-Whites, high school education or less[17]) were less likely to 
(or perhaps, could not afford to given only partial reimbursement) take leave under the 
policy.[8] Furthermore, over half of parents at highest risk of AHT (younger, non-Whites, 
those with less education or household income) were unaware of this law in California.[8] 
This differential access to PFL, which results in more advantaged groups gaining access to 
the benefits, could contribute to increasing the inequitable burden of AHT. Moreover, when 
parents did take advantage of California’s PFL and SDI, they only took, on average, six 
weeks of leave[18]—not enough to cover the period of increased infant crying associated 
with AHT. The impact of California’s PFL policy on AHT may or not be greater if more 
parents at high risk were aware of the law, could afford to take advantage of it, and used the 
full 12 weeks allowable. Extending PFL to cover the full period of increased infant crying 
and peak AHT incidence (i.e., 20 weeks[2]) may or not improve its impact. These are both 
important questions for future research to explore.
Although the use of the commonly used econometric difference-in-difference analysis to 
better estimate the effects compared with nonintervention control states is an important 
methodological strength, our analysis was limited to AHT inpatient admissions, and did not 
examine, for example, AHT diagnosed in other clinical settings or AHT mortality. In 
addition, administrative coding in hospital records likely underestimates true AHT 
prevalence although the ICD codes we used have shown a sensitivity of 92% and specificity 
of 96% for hospital admissions[19]. The state comparisons to California were limited by 
data availability in SID.. Analysis of this issue at the individual or family level, capturing 
parents’ PFL participation, would facilitate more robust conclusions about the impact of
