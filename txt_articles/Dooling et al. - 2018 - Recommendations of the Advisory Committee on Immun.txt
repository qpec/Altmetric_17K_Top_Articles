Introduction
On October 20, 2017, Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, 
Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline, [GSK] Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina), a 2-dose, subunit vaccine 
containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with 
a novel adjuvant (AS01B), was approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in 
adults aged ≥50 years. The vaccine consists of 2 doses (0.5 mL 
each), administered intramuscularly, 2–6 months apart (1). On 
October 25, 2017, the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) recommended the recombinant zoster vaccine 
(RZV) for use in immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years.
Herpes zoster is a localized, usually painful, cutaneous erup-
tion resulting from reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus 
(VZV). Herpes zoster is common: approximately one million 
cases occur each year in the United States (2). The incidence 
increases with age, from five cases per 1,000 population in 
adults aged 50–59 years to 11 cases per 1,000 population 
in persons aged ≥80 years (2). Postherpetic neuralgia, com-
monly defined as persistent pain for at least 90 days following 
the resolution of the herpes zoster rash, is the most common 
complication and occurs in 10%–13% of herpes zoster cases 
in persons aged >50 years (3,4). Among persons with herpes 
zoster, the risk for developing postherpetic neuralgia also 
increases with age (3–5).
Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) (Zostavax, Merck and Co., Inc., 
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), a 1-dose live attenuated 
strain of VZV, is licensed for the prevention of herpes zoster 
in immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years and is recom-
mended by the ACIP for use in immunocompetent adults aged 
≥60 years (6). Since licensure, vaccine coverage has increased 
each year, and by 2016, 33% of adults aged ≥60 years reported 
receipt of the vaccine (CDC, provisional unpublished data). 
ACIP considered use of RZV, as well as existing recommenda-
tions, to develop vaccination policy which would be safe and 
reduce disease burden. This report serves as a supplement to the 
2008 Prevention of Herpes Zoster Recommendations of ACIP 
for the use of ZVL in adults aged ≥60 years and subsequent 
updates (6–8); it outlines recent ACIP recommendations as 
well as guidance for use of RZV and ZVL in adults.
Methods
From March 2015 to October 2017, the ACIP Herpes 
Zoster Vaccines Work Group (Work Group; see acknowl-
edgments for members and their affiliations) participated 
in monthly or bimonthly teleconferences to review herpes 
zoster epidemiology and the evidence for the efficacy, safety, 
and programmatic factors of RZV and ZVL. According to 
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the Work Group defined 
critical and important outcomes, conducted a systematic 
review of the evidence, and subsequently reviewed and dis-
cussed findings and evidence quality (https://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/acip/recs/grade/) (9).
A cost effectiveness analysis comparing RZV, ZVL, or no 
vaccine was conducted by CDC from a societal perspective, 
using an analytic horizon of time of vaccination through the 
end of life. Model inputs were based on published literature 
where available and relied on unpublished data and Work 
Group expert opinion when necessary. It was modeled that 
ZVL effectiveness against herpes zoster would wane to zero 
4–12 years following vaccination, depending on age at vac-
cination (4,10–13). In the absence of long-term effectiveness 
data, it was modeled that RZV effectiveness in adults aged 
50–69 years or ≥70 years would wane to zero 19 years following 
vaccination based on the rate of waning observed during the 
first 4 years of clinical trials as well as expert opinion (13–15). 
Economic analyses were also conducted for RZV in cohorts 
previously vaccinated with ZVL. In keeping with CDC practice 
(16,17), the purpose of the economic analysis was to model 
the proposed recommendation; therefore, full adherence to a 
2-dose RZV regime was assumed in baseline models. Lower 
rates of 2-dose adherence were evaluated in sensitivity analyses.
Since 2015, RZV was discussed at five ACIP meetings. In 
addition to the aforementioned data, several independent 
health economic studies (18,19), (Merck, unpublished data, 
2017), as well as immunogenicity data were presented. Long-
term immunogenicity of RZV (20) and immunogenicity and 
safety of RZV in ZVL recipients (21) were considered, with 
recognition that there are no standard immunologic correlates 
of protection for prevention of herpes zoster.
At the October 2017 meeting, three proposed recommen-
dations were presented to the committee, and, after a public

comment period, were approved by the voting ACIP members 
as follows: 1) RZV is recommended for immunocompetent 
adults aged ≥50 years (14 voted in favor, 1 opposed*), 2) RZV 
is recommended for immunocompetent adults previously vac-
cinated with ZVL (12 voted in favor, 3 opposed), and 3) RZV 
is preferred over ZVL (8 voted in favor, 7 opposed). This report 
summarizes the data considered, the quality of evidence, and 
rationale for recommendations.
Summary of Findings
As a result of the GRADE process, key outcomes were 
designated as critical (prevention of herpes zoster and posther-
petic neuralgia, serious adverse events following vaccination) 
or important (duration of protection, reactogenicity). All 
outcomes were considered for both RZV and ZVL compared 
with no vaccination. There were no clinical studies that com-
pared the vaccines directly with one another (head-to-head). 
Supporting evidence for the Work Group’s findings is available 
online (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/herpes-
zoster.html) (22).
Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV). Efficacy of RZV was 
evaluated in a two-part, phase III multicenter clinical trial 
which enrolled >30,000 participants, who were randomized 
1:1 to receive vaccine or saline placebo (14,15). The median 
follow-up time was 3.2 years for Zoster Efficacy Study in 
Adults 50 Years of Age or Older (ZOE-50) (14), and 3.7 years 
for Zoster Efficacy Study in Adults 70 Years of Age or Older 
(ZOE-70) (15). The efficacy for the prevention of herpes zoster 
was 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89.6–99.3) in 
persons aged 50–59 years and 97.4% (95% CI = 90.1–99.7) 
in persons aged 60–69 years (14). Using pooled data from both 
study arms, vaccine efficacy was 91.3% (95% CI = 86.8–94.5) 
in participants aged ≥70 years (15). Vaccine efficacy in the 
first year after vaccination was 97.6% (95% CI = 90.9–99.8) 
and was 84.7% (95% CI = 69.0–93.4) or higher for the 
remaining 3 years of the study in persons aged ≥70 years. 
Efficacy for prevention of postherpetic neuralgia was 91.2% 
(95% CI = 75.9–97.7) in adults aged ≥50 years and 88.8% 
(95% CI = 68.7–97.1) in those aged ≥70 years (15).
Serious adverse events (an undesirable experience associated 
with the vaccine that results in death, hospitalization, disability 
or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious 
outcome) were examined in eight studies sponsored by GSK, 
which included 29,965 subjects (15,264 RZV recipients) (22). 
Overall, rates of serious adverse events over the study periods 
were similar in the RZV and placebo groups.
* Laura Riley submitted that her opposed vote was cast in error. This is reflected 
in the official minutes; however, because the disclosure occurred after the session 
was closed, the original vote remains unchanged.
Injection-site and systemic grade 3 solicited adverse events 
(reactions related to vaccination which were severe enough 
to prevent normal activities) were actively surveyed in eight 
studies involving 10,590 subjects (22). Among the subset of 
subjects completing the 7-day diary card for reactogenicity in 
phase III clinical trials (9,936), 16.5% of vaccine recipients 
reported any grade 3 adverse event compared with 3.1% of 
placebo recipients (14,15). Grade 3 injection-site reactions 
(pain, redness, and swelling) were reported by 9.4% of vac-
cine recipients, compared with 0.3% of placebo recipients and 
grade 3 solicited systemic events (myalgia, fatigue, headache, 
shivering, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms) were reported 
by 10.8% of vaccine recipients and 2.4% of placebo recipients 
(14,15). Whereas there were no differences in the proportions 
of local grade 3 reactions between dose 1 and dose 2, systemic 
grade 3 reactions were reported more frequently after dose 2 
(1). Overall, the most common solicited adverse reactions 
(grade 1–3) were pain (78%), myalgia (45%), and fatigue 
(45%) (1).
Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL). Two randomized clinical trials 
and seven observational studies were reviewed to evaluate the 
performance of a single dose of ZVL in preventing herpes zoster 
(22). A randomized clinical trial in persons aged 50–59 years 
found that the efficacy was 70% (95% CI = 54–81) (median 
follow-up time was 1.3 years) (12). A randomized trial in 
persons aged ≥60 years found that the efficacy was 64% 
(95% CI = 56–71) in persons aged 60–69 years and 38% 
(95% CI = 25–48) in persons aged ≥70 (median follow-up 
time was 3.1 years) (4). Estimates from observational stud-
ies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are consistent; 
observational estimates are within the 95% CI of the RCT 
estimates (22). The duration of protection has been studied 
out to 11 years, including the first 4 years of the RCT and then 
follow-on, nonblinded studies which used a modeled control 
group from years 7–11 (4,10,11). Shorter follow-up periods 
have been evaluated in observational studies using administra-
tive health data (22). Studies concur that there is a substantial 
decrease in effectiveness following the first year after receipt 
of ZVL, and, by 6 years postvaccination, vaccine effectiveness 
against herpes zoster is <35% (10,23–25). During years 7–8 
postvaccination, observational study estimates of effectiveness 
ranged from 21%–32% (23,24). In the longest study of ZVL, 
estimates of effectiveness were no longer statistically significant 
9–11 years postvaccination (11). In a phase III clinical trial, 
vaccine efficacy against post herpetic neuralgia was 65.7% 
(95% CI = 20.4–86.7) in persons aged 60–69 years and 66.8% 
(95% CI = 43.3–81.3) in participants aged ≥70 years (median 
follow-up of 3.1 years) (4); these estimates are consistent with 
estimates from observational studies (22). Notably, in obser-
vational studies, vaccine effectiveness against postherpetic

neuralgia was longer-lasting than effectiveness against herpes 
zoster itself (23,26).
Serious adverse events related to ZVL were examined in 
eight high quality RCTs, 13 RCTs with limitations, and an 
additional seven observational studies (22). Overall, serious 
adverse events occurred at similar rates in vaccinated and pla-
cebo groups. Whereas injection site reactions were reported 
in 48% of vaccine recipients and 17% of placebo recipients 
in phase III clinical trials, post hoc analysis indicates that 
no more than 0.9% of vaccine recipients reported any given 
injection site symptom as grade 3 (22). In addition, in rare 
instances, ZVL vaccine strain has been documented to cause 
disseminated rash as well as herpes zoster in immunocompetent 
recipients (22,27), and life-threatening and fatal complications 
in immunocompromised recipients (28,29).
Cost effectiveness. The CDC analysis was conducted 
from a societal perspective over a lifetime. It estimated that 
vaccination with RZV, compared with no vaccination, cost 
$31,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), on average, 
for immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years. The numbers 
of persons needed to be vaccinated with RZV to prevent one 
case of herpes zoster and one case of postherpetic neuralgia are 
11–17 and 70–187, respectively. Estimates of costs per QALY 
for vaccination with RZV 8 weeks following ZVL (estimated by 
immediate revaccination in the model) ranged from $15,000 
per QALY in persons aged 80–89 years to $117,000 per QALY 
for persons aged 50–59 years. Under most assumptions, vac-
cination with RZV prevented more disease at lower overall 
costs than did vaccination with ZVL. In probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses, 73.5% 2-dose completion (range = 38.8%–96.3%) 
coupled with 1-dose initial effectiveness estimates of 90% and 
69% were applied, and RZV remained the most cost-effective 
strategy (13).
ACIP also reviewed independent cost-effectiveness analyses 
by an academic group (18), GSK (19), and Merck (Merck, 
unpublished data, 2017). The academic group estimated RZV 
costs per QALY of $30,000 when vaccination occurred at age 
60 years. The GSK model estimated RZV costs per QALY of 
$12,000, on average, for recipients aged ≥60 years. Although 
analytic approaches and model inputs differed, both groups 
found that RZV was more cost effective than ZVL. Merck 
modeled vaccination at age ≥60 years and estimated $107,000 
per QALY for RZV and $83,000 per QALY for ZVL, with ZVL 
as the most cost-effective vaccine in most scenarios.
Summary of the Quality of Evidence Across 
Outcomes
The body of evidence for benefits of RZV (prevention of 
herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia and duration of pro-
tection against herpes zoster) was primarily informed by one 
high quality RCT that studied vaccine efficacy through 4 years 
postvaccination. The GRADE evidence type was judged as 1, 
the strongest level of evidence (22). The evidence for possible 
harms (serious adverse events and reactogenicity) was reported 
in the same RCT and was consistent across additional smaller, 
less rigorous studies. Overall, the estimates of possible harms 
were supported by GRADE evidence type 1 (22).
The body of evidence for benefits of ZVL (prevention of 
herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, and duration of 
protection against herpes zoster) was large, including a high 
quality prelicensure RCT as well as a postlicensure RCT and 
observational studies of effectiveness. The level of vaccine effec-
tiveness for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic 
neuralgia was supported by GRADE evidence type 1 (22). 
The duration of protection beyond 4 years was supported by 
GRADE evidence type 2 because the studies lacked blinding, 
and beyond 6 years, lacked randomization and a true control 
group. The evidence for possible harms of ZVL (serious adverse 
events and reactogenicity) was supported by GRADE evidence 
type 1 from multiple RCTs and supported by observational 
studies and a decade of experience (22,29).
Rationale
RZV use in immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years. 
With high efficacy among adults aged ≥50 years, and modest 
waning of protection over 4 years following vaccination, RZV 
has the potential to prevent substantial herpes zoster disease 
burden. Vaccinating adults starting at age 50 will prevent dis-
ease incidence in midlife, and the vaccine will likely continue to 
provide substantial protection beyond 4 years as recipients age.
RZV use in immunocompetent adults who previously 
received ZVL. In separate clinical trials, RZV estimates of 
efficacy against herpes zoster were higher than ZVL estimates 
in all age categories. The difference in efficacy between the 
two vaccines was most pronounced among recipients aged 
≥70 years. Studies have shown that ZVL effectiveness wanes 
substantially over time, leaving recipients with reduced 
protection against herpes zoster. RZV elicited similar safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity profiles regardless of prior 
ZVL receipt; therefore, ZVL recipients will likely benefit from 
vaccination with RZV.
Preferential use of RZV. In separate clinical trials, for all 
age categories, RZV estimates of efficacy against herpes zoster 
were higher than those for ZVL. Estimates of efficacy against 
postherpetic neuralgia are also higher for RZV than for ZVL; 
however, CIs overlap. ZVL efficacy wanes substantially during 
the 4 years following receipt. As a result of higher and more 
long-lasting efficacy, RZV is estimated to prevent more herpes 
zoster and postherpetic neuralgia compared with ZVL. ACIP 
acknowledged that several aspects of RZV performance will

be further elucidated postlicensure, including the possibility 
of a rare adverse event related to the vaccine, the long-term 
duration of protection, the adherence to the 2-dose schedule, 
and the effectiveness and duration of protection of 1 dose of 
RZV. Some ACIP members preferred to recommend both 
vaccines with no preference until real-world data could be 
accrued, including head-to-head studies. The majority of ACIP 
members voted to recommend RZV preferentially (Box).
Clinical Guidance
General use. RZV may be used in adults aged ≥50 years, 
irrespective of prior receipt of varicella vaccine or ZVL, and 
does not require screening for a history of chickenpox (vari-
cella). ZVL remains a recommended vaccine for prevention of 
herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults aged ≥60 years (6). 
Care should be taken not to confuse ZVL, which is stored in 
the freezer and administered subcutaneously, with RZV, which 
is stored in the refrigerator and administered intramuscularly.
Dosing schedule. Following the first dose of RZV, the 
second dose should be given 2–6 months later (1). The vac-
cine series need not be restarted if more than 6 months have 
elapsed since the first dose; however, the efficacy of alternative 
dosing regimens has not been evaluated, data regarding the 
safety of alternative regimens are limited (30), and individu-
als might remain at risk for herpes zoster during a longer than 
recommended interval between doses 1 and 2. If the second 
dose of RZV is given less than 4 weeks after the first, the 
second dose should be repeated. Two doses of the vaccine are 
necessary regardless of prior history of herpes zoster or prior 
receipt of ZVL.
Timing of RZV for persons previously vaccinated with 
ZVL. Age and time since receipt of ZVL may be considered 
to determine when to vaccinate with RZV. Studies examined 
the safety and immunogenicity of RZV vaccination adminis-
tered ≥5 years after ZVL (21); shorter intervals have not been 
studied. However, there are no data or theoretical concerns 
to indicate that RZV would be less safe or less effective when 
administered at an interval of <5 years. Clinical trials indicated 
lower efficacy of ZVL in adults aged ≥70 years; therefore, a 
shorter interval may be considered based on the recipient’s age 
when ZVL was administered. Based on expert opinion, RZV 
should not be given <2 months after receipt of ZVL.
Coadministration with other vaccines. CDC’s general best 
practice guidelines for immunization advise that recombinant 
and adjuvanted vaccines, such as RZV, can be administered 
concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other adult vac-
cines (31). Concomitant administration of RZV with Fluarix 
Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine) (QIV) has been studied, and 
there was no evidence for interference in the immune response 
BOX. Recommendations for the use of herpes zoster vaccines
In October 2017, the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) made the following three 
recommendations: 
1. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is recommended 
for the prevention of herpes zoster and related 
complications for immunocompetent adults aged 
≥50 years.
2. RZV is recommended for the prevention of herpes 
zoster and related complications for 
immunocompetent adults who previously received 
zoster vaccine live (ZVL).
3. RZV is preferred over ZVL for the prevention of 
herpes zoster and related complications. 
These recommendations serve as a supplement to the 
existing recommendations for the use of ZVL in immu-
nocompetent adults aged ≥60 years.
to either vaccine or safety concerns (32). Evaluation of coad-
ministration of RZV with 23-valent pneumococcal polysac-
charide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax23) and tetanus toxoid, 
reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, 
adsorbed (Tdap, Boostrix) is ongoing. The safety and efficacy 
of administration of two adjuvanted vaccines (e.g., RZV and 
adjuvanted influenza vaccine [Fluad]), either concomitantly 
or at other intervals, have not been evaluated.
Counseling for reactogenicity. Before vaccination, provid-
ers should counsel RZV recipients about expected systemic 
and local reactogenicity. Reactions to the first dose did not 
strongly predict reactions to the second dose (33); vaccine 
recipients should be encouraged to complete the series even 
if they experienced a grade 1–3 reaction to the first dose of 
RZV. The impact of prophylactic analgesics in conjunction 
with RZV has not been studied.
Special Populations
Persons with a history of herpes zoster. Herpes zoster can 
recur. Adults with a history of herpes zoster should receive RZV. 
If a patient is experiencing an episode of herpes zoster, vaccina-
tion should be delayed until the acute stage of the illness is over 
and symptoms abate. Studies of safety and immunogenicity of 
RZV in this population are ongoing.
Persons with chronic medical conditions. Adults with 
chronic medical conditions (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes 
mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pulmonary disease) 
should receive RZV.
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Immunocompromised persons. As with ZVL, the ACIP 
recommends the use of RZV in persons taking low-dose 
immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., <20 mg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent or using inhaled or topical steroids) and persons 
anticipating immunosuppression or who have recovered from 
an immunocompromising illness (6). Whereas RZV is licensed 
for all persons aged ≥50 years, immunocompromised persons 
and those on moderate to high doses of immunosuppressive 
therapy were excluded from the efficacy studies (ZOE-50 
and ZOE-70), and thus, ACIP has not made recommenda-
tions regarding the use of RZV in these patients; this topic is 
anticipated to be discussed at upcoming ACIP meetings as 
additional data become available.
Persons known to be VZV negative. Screening for a history 
of varicella (either verbally or via laboratory serology) before 
vaccination for herpes zoster is not recommended. However, 
in persons known to be VZV negative via serologic testing, 
ACIP guidelines for varicella vaccination should be followed. 
RZV has not been evaluated in persons who are VZV sero-
negative and the vaccine is not indicated for the prevention 
of chickenpox (varicella).
Contraindication
Allergy. RZV should not be administered to persons with a 
history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any 
component of this vaccine.
Precautions
Current herpes zoster infection. RZV is not a treatment 
for herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia and should not be 
administered during an acute episode of herpes zoster.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding. There are no available data to 
establish whether RZV is safe in pregnant or lactating women 
and there is currently no ACIP recommendation for RZV use 
in this population. Consider delaying vaccination with RZV 
in such circumstances.
Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Reactions
Adverse events that occur in a patient following vaccina-
tion can be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting 
System (VAERS). Reporting is encouraged for any clinically 
significant adverse event even if it is uncertain whether the 
vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a 
report to VAERS is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.
html or by telephone at 1–800–822–7967.
Future Research and Monitoring Priorities
Studies of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of herpes 
zoster vaccines in defined immunocompromised populations 
are ongoing. ACIP will consider these data as they become 
available and revise recommendations accordingly. In addi-
tion, CDC will monitor coverage of RZV and adherence to 
the 2-dose schedule. Short-term and long-term effectiveness 
of RZV will be assessed through longitudinal studies of clini-
cal trial participants as well as through observational studies.
As with all new vaccines, CDC will monitor adverse events 
following immunization through VAERS and the Vaccine Safety 
Datalink. Additional post-marketing safety monitoring will 
include studies conducted by GSK and reported to the FDA. 
Monitoring RZV is particularly important given the vaccine’s 
novel adjuvant and its high reactogenicity and immunogenicity.
