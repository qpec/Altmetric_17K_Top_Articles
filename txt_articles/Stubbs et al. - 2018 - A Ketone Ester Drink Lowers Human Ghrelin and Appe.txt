Objective: The ketones D-b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate are elevated during prolonged fast-
ing or during a “ketogenic” diet. Although weight loss on a ketogenic diet may be associated with
decreased appetite and altered gut hormone levels, it is unknown whether such changes are caused by
elevated blood ketones. This study investigated the effects of an exogenous ketone ester (KE) on appetite.
Methods: Following an overnight fast, subjects with normal weight (n 5 15) consumed 1.9 kcal/kg of KE,
or isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), in drinks matched for volume, taste, tonicity, and color. Blood samples
were analyzed for BHB, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine
tyrosine (PYY), and a three-measure visual analogue scale was used to measure hunger, fullness, and
desire to eat.
Results: KE consumption increased blood BHB levels from 0.2 to 3.3 mM after 60 minutes. DEXT con-
sumption increased plasma glucose levels between 30 and 60 minutes. Postprandial plasma insulin,
ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels were significantly lower 2 to 4 hours after KE consumption, compared
with DEXT consumption. Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and
desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with con-
sumption of DEXT.
Conclusions: Increased blood ketone levels may directly suppress appetite, as KE drinks lowered
plasma ghrelin levels, perceived hunger, and desire to eat.

Introduction
Successful weight loss requires prolonged maintenance of a dietary
calorie deficit. Perceived hunger is a significant barrier to long-term
weight loss (1). Diets that are “ketogenic” (low carbohydrate, high
fat) are an effective strategy for weight loss and have been experi-
mentally and anecdotally linked to decreased appetite (2-4). During
a ketogenic diet, the body produces ketone bodies from lipid stored
in adipose tissue. Ketones are then oxidized throughout the body as
an alternative energy source during low dietary carbohydrate intake,
when falling blood glucose levels threaten cerebral function (5).
Decreased appetite during a ketogenic diet may be linked to ele-
vated plasma ketone levels (6).
The mechanism whereby ketones could decrease appetite may be
via central actions in the brain or by changes to peripheral
hormone secretion (6). To support a central effect, intracerebral
infusions of the ketone body D-b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) decrease
food intake in rodents (7), and BHB increases expression of orexi-
genic neuropeptides (i.e., agouti-related peptide) in hypothalamic
cells in vitro (8).
Evidence for peripheral effects can be seen in patients following a
ketogenic diet, who have altered fasting and postprandial levels of
some gut hormones, including the “hunger hormone,” ghrelin (3,9).
Ghrelin is produced by oxyntic cells of the stomach, and circulating
plasma levels are highest during periods of starvation, whereas lev-
els are rapidly downregulated following a meal (10). Ghrelin acts on
the hypothalamus and vagus nerve to stimulate feeding (11), and
basal circulating plasma levels are raised following periods of
restricted food intake and weight loss. Importantly, increased basal

 ghrelin is implicated in overeating, and weight regain, following a
diet (10).
We have developed a ketone ester (KE) drink that rapidly raises lev-
els of blood BHB without dietary manipulation (12,13), thereby
allowing any direct satiating effect of ketones, per se, to be sepa-
rated from other dietary and adaptive changes that accompany a
ketogenic diet. In this study, we sought to determine whether KE
drinks suppressed appetite via changes in plasma ghrelin levels.
Methods
Study design and participants
A randomized, single-blinded, crossover study examined the effects
of isocaloric KE and dextrose (DEXT) drinks on appetite in healthy
participants with normal weight (n 5 15) (Figure 1A). An external
Research Ethics Committee (NHS Queen’s Square 14/LO/0288)
approved the study, which was conducted at the University of
Oxford in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study
was approved as a “basic science study” according to the definition
from the UK Health Research Authority. Participants were healthy,
aged 21 to 42, and had no history of major illness (anthropometric
characteristics are provided in Table 1). Participants provided writ-
ten informed consent prior to inclusion. Drink order was randomized
prior to commencement.
Visit protocol
Participants refrained from alcohol and caffeine for 24 hours prior
to each visit and consumed an identical evening meal at the same
time before each visit. Testing started at 0800 hours following an
overnight (> 8 h) fast, with a minimum of 72 hours between visits.

 Venous blood samples (2 mL) were obtained by using a 22-gauge
catheter inserted into an antecubital vein. Fasting blood samples
were collected prior to all interventions and then at regular intervals
for 4 hours following the study drink. At identical time points, par-
ticipants completed a validated three-measure visual analogue scale
(VAS) to assess “hunger,” “desire to eat,” and “fullness” (14). Each
drink contained 1.9 kcal/kg of BHB (from KE) or DEXT. Drinks
were diluted to 500 mL with a commercially available citrus-
flavored drink containing 65 kcal (5 g of carbohydrate) (Glaceau;
Coca-Cola Great Britain, London, UK). The DEXT drink was taste-
matched by using a bitterness additive (Symrise, Holzminden,
Germany).
Analysis
Blood BHB was measured by using a handheld monitor and reagent
strips (Precision Xtra, Abbott Diabetes Care, Maidenhead, UK).
Blood samples were stored on ice and centrifuged; duplicate plasma
aliquots were stored at 2808C and analyzed within 6 weeks. Plasma
glucose was assayed by using a commercial analyzer (ABX Pentra;
HORIBA ABX SAS, Montpellier, France), while insulin and total
ghrelin were measured by using commercially available enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Mercodia AB, Uppsala,
Sweden, and Merck, Millipore, Germany). Total glucagon-like pep-
tide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) assays were per-
formed by the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory of the National
Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research
Centre (http://www.cuh.org.uk/core-biochemical-assay-laboratory).
Statistical methods
Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical
analysis. VAS scores were measured as a distance (mm) and nor-
malized by taking the baseline distance for each visit as zero. Val-
ues are means 6 standard error of the mean (SEM) with significance
at P < 0.05. Following initial tests to ensure that normality and sphe-
ricity assumptions were not violated, two-way repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Mann-Whitney U test with post
hoc correction was performed, as appropriate. Correlations were cal-
culated between blood BHB and VAS score for each individual dur-
ing the KE visit at each time point post baseline (total points 5 105)
by using a two-tailed Pearson test (with Pearson r reported as r and
significance as P) with a 95% confidence interval.
Results
Following KE consumption, blood BHB levels rapidly increased to
3.3 6 0.2 mM after 1 hour and gradually fell over the remaining 3
hours, whereas DEXT administration had no effect on BHB levels
(Figure 1B). The perception of hunger and desire to eat fell by a simi-
lar extent after both drinks, but KE lowered both parameters by �50%
for 1.5 to 4 hours compared with DEXT drinks (Figure 2A-2B). Per-
ceived fullness was the same following both DEXT and KE drinks
(Figure 2C). Increasing ketonemia was significantly correlated to
decreased hunger, desire to eat, and increased fullness (Figure 2D-2F).
To explore possible mechanisms for these observations, we compared
plasma glucose, insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels after KE and
DEXT drinks. Plasma glucose levels were significantly higher 30
minutes after DEXT consumption than after KE consumption
(5.8 6 0.5 mM vs. 5.1 6 0.2 mM, P 5 0.02) (Figure 2G). Plasma insu-
lin levels rose after both KE and DEXT consumption, but levels were
threefold higher 30 minutes after DEXT administration, compared
with KE administration (38 6 5 mU/L vs. 13 6 2 mU/L, P < 0.001)
(Figure 2H). After 90 minutes, there were no significant differences
between plasma glucose and insulin levels following KE and DEXT
drinks. Plasma ghrelin fell to � 320 pg/mL 1 hour following both
drinks, but the postprandial rise in ghrelin was significantly attenuated
following KE administration, remaining > 100 pg/mL lower between
2 to 4 hours post drink than after DEXT. Total ghrelin area under the
curve (AUC) was significantly lower with KE than with DEXT
(86,294 6 6,193
pg�min/mL
vs.
103,780 6 9,136
pg�min/mL,
P < 0.05) (Figure 2I-2L). As expected, GLP-1 and PYY were elevated
following DEXT administration. However, plasma GLP-1 and PYY
levels were not raised in response to KE drinks after 30 minutes and
were lower than DEXT (GLP-1: 15 pg/mL vs. 8 pg/mL, P < 0.001;
PYY: 68 pg/mL vs. 57 pg/mL, P 5 0.001) (Figure 2J-2K).
Discussion
Ketogenic diets can decrease appetite and reduce calorie intake, but
the exact mechanism for the suppressed appetite is unclear (2,3,9).
Elevated blood BHB occurs during both exogenous and endogenous
ketosis; therefore, BHB may be a direct mediator of the lower appetite
and altered gut hormone levels seen in both settings. Here, we found
that KE drinks delayed the onset of hunger and lowered the desire to
eat, in conjunction with a delayed rise in plasma ghrelin levels. Appe-
tite suppression observed following KE drinks was not attributable to
higher plasma levels of insulin, glucose, GLP-1, or PYY, which are
conventionally believed to be signals that decrease appetite (15-17).
Hunger and satiety are signaled by two opposing neural pathways in
the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus: neuropeptide Y (NPY)/
agouti-related peptide neurons and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)
neurons, respectively. Ghrelin, commonly known as the hunger hor-
mone, activates orexigenic NPY neurons. NPY-expressing neurons
inhibit anorexigenic POMC neurons at both their site of origin in
the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (via GABAergic inhibition)
and in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus by antago-
nism of MC4 receptor activation (1). Damping the activity of NPY-
expressing “hunger” neurons by decreasing ghrelin levels may there-
fore be highly effective in reducing overall food intake.
A putative mechanism whereby BHB could alter gut hormone secre-
tion is through receptor binding to gut enteroendocrine cells; for
example, BHB antagonizes GPCR-41 (18), a Gi/Go protein-coupled
receptor expressed throughout the small bowel. Lower levels of fast-
ing plasma ghrelin were observed in patients on a ketogenic diet
who achieved ketosis during weight loss (3,9), with the fall in appe-
tite being correlated to the level of ketosis. However, the effect of
BHB alone in such studies is difficult to ascertain in conjunction
with increased dietary fat and protein. It is prudent to note that Hall
et al. showed that diets low in fat resulted in greater body fat loss
than carbohydrate-restricted diets, highlighting that metabolic adap-
tation during caloric restriction is complex (18).
It remains unclear to what extent BHB acts centrally in the brain to
directly modulate appetite, although such effects are likely, given
the evolutionary role of BHB as a cerebral metabolic fuel (5,6).

 Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of calorie restriction in Par-
kinson’s disease is directly linked to des-acyl ghrelin signaling
through AMP-activated protein kinase, which plays a pivotal role in
the regulation of POMC and NPY neuron activity, and the effect of
BHB may therefore also be mediated centrally (19). In the future,
KE drinks could be used in studies that combine neuroimaging with
blood analysis to clarify the interaction between the central and
peripheral effects of ketosis on appetite in the absence of the con-
founding contributions of the ketogenic diet.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that the levels of GLP-1 and
PYY, both satiety signals, were also downregulated by acute KE
administration. Given the acute effects of KE consumption on the
endocrine system shown here, the potential for adaptations over
time, and the mild effects of KE drinks on acid-base homeostasis
(unpublished data), it is unclear whether KE consumption could be
used for long-term appetite control. Therefore, until any chronic
effects are fully characterized, ketone supplements should not be
used to replace dietary strategies for weight control.

 Conclusion
Exogenous ketosis following KE drinks reduced two measures of
appetite, hunger and desire to eat, compared with DEXT drinks.
This occurred in conjunction with decreased levels of the hunger
hormone, ghrelin. Therefore, KE drinks offer a unique opportunity
to isolate and exploit the effects of ketosis on appetite without other
dietary interventions.O
