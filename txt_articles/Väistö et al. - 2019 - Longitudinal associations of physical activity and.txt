Background: There are few prospective studies on the associations of changes in 
objectively measured vigorous physical activity (VPA∆), moderate‐to‐vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA∆), light physical activity (LPA∆), and sedentary time (ST∆) 
with changes in cardiometabolic risk factors (∆) in children. We therefore investi-
gated these relationships among children.
Methods: The participants were a population sample of 258 children aged 6‐8 years 
followed for 2 years. We assessed PA and ST by a combined heart rate and move-
ment sensor; computed continuous age‐ and sex‐adjusted z‐scores for waist circum-
ference, blood pressure, and fasting insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and high‐density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; and constructed a cardiometabolic risk score (CRS) of 
these risk factors. Data were analyzed using linear regression models adjusted for 
age, sex, the explanatory and outcome variables at baseline, and puberty.
Results: VPA∆ associated inversely with CRS∆ (β = −0.209, P = 0.001), body fat 
percentage (BF%)∆ (β = −0.244, P = 0.001), insulin∆ (β = −0.220, P = 0.001), and 
triglycerides∆ (β = −0.164, P = 0.012) and directly with HDL cholesterol∆ 
(β = 0.159, P = 0.023). MVPA∆ associated inversely with CRS∆ (β = −0.178, 
P = 0.012), BF%∆ (β = −0.298, P = <0.001), and insulin∆ (β = −0.213, P = 0.006) 
and directly with HDL cholesterol∆ (β = 0.184, P = 0.022). LPA∆ only associated 
negatively with CRS∆ (β = −0.163, P = 0.032). ST∆ associated directly with CRS∆

INTRODUCTION
Insufficient levels of physical activity (PA) and excess seden-
tary time (ST) have been associated with overweight, insulin 
resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, elevated blood 
pressure, and the clustering of these cardiometabolic risk 
factors in children.1-3 This clustering of risk factors among 
otherwise healthy children may be a biological marker of 
poor cardiometabolic health.4 Moreover, an unfavorable car-
diometabolic risk profile during childhood and adolescence 
has been linked to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, 
type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in adulthood.5-7
Cross‐sectional studies have linked higher levels of ob-
jectively measured PA,1,8,9 especially more vigorous PA 
(VPA),10-12 with lower cardiometabolic risk in children and 
adolescents. To the best of our knowledge, there are few pro-
spective studies on the associations of objectively measured 
PA, particularly PA at different intensity levels, with car-
diometabolic risk factors in children.13-16 The results of these 
studies suggest that at least moderate‐intensity PA is required 
to reduce cardiometabolic risk among children.
Screen time assessed by questionnaires, a widely used mea-
sure of ST, has been directly associated with cardiometabolic 
risk factors in cross‐sectional studies among children and ad-
olescents.3,17,18 However, cross‐sectional studies have found 
weak or no associations of objectively measured total ST with 
cardiometabolic risk factors in children.9,19,20 Moreover, on the 
basis of recent reviews, there is limited evidence from longitu-
dinal studies on the associations of objectively measured total 
ST with clustered cardiometabolic risk factors in children.21,22
We investigated the cross‐sectional and longitudinal asso-
ciations of objectively measured total PA energy expenditure 
(PAEE), PA at different intensity levels, and total ST with overall 
cardiometabolic risk and individual cardiometabolic risk factors 
in a 2‐year follow‐up study in a general population of children.

METHODS
2.1 | Study design and study population
The present analyses are based on the baseline and 2‐year 
follow‐up data from the Physical Activity and Nutrition 
in Children (PANIC) Study that is an ongoing controlled 
PA and dietary intervention study (ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT01803776) in a representative population sample of 
primary school children from the city of Kuopio, Finland. 
Altogether 736 children aged 6‐8 years who started the 
first grade in primary schools in 2007‐2009 were invited 
in the baseline examinations, and 512 (70%) of them par-
ticipated. Complete data on variables used in the statistical 
analyses were available for 399 children at baseline (198 
girls, 201 boys) and for 258 children at 2‐year follow‐up 
(140 girls, 118 boys). 
2.2 | Assessment of PA and ST
Physical activity and ST were assessed using a combined 
heart rate and movement sensor (Actiheart, CamNtech 
Ltd, Papworth, UK), a light and waterproof device23 
which is attached to the chest with standard electrocar-
diogram (ECG) electrodes (Bio Protech Inc, Wonju, 
South Korea). The monitor was set to record heart rate 
and body movement in 60‐second epochs. The participants 
were instructed to carry on with their usual behavior and 
to wear the monitor during all daily activities, including 
sleep, shower, sauna, and swimming. The activity patterns 
of school children are known to vary markedly between 
weekdays and weekend days.24 The participants were 
therefore requested to wear the monitor continuously for 
a minimum of four consecutive days, including two week-
days and two weekend days, to obtain more representative 
information on PA and ST. Altogether 73% of the partici-
pants at baseline and 63% of the participants at 2‐year fol-
low‐up wore the Actiheart monitor for at least 4 days the 
average wear time being 4.7 days at baseline and 4.1 days 
at 2‐year follow‐up. We accepted PA and ST data for the 
statistical analyses if there was a minimum of 48 hours 
of activity recording in weekday and weekend day hours 
that included at least 12 hours from morning (3 am‐9 am), 
noon (9 am‐3 pm), afternoon (3 pm‐9 pm), and night (9 pm‐3 
am) to avoid potential bias from over‐representing specific 
times and activities of the days.
Heart rate data were cleaned25 and individually cali-
brated with sleeping heart rate and parameters obtained 
Sakari Sohlberg Foundation; the Finnish 
Doctoral Programs in Public Health
(β = 0.218, P = 0.003), BF%∆ (β = 0.212, P = 0.016), and insulin∆ (β = 0.159, 
P = 0.049).
Conclusions: Increased VPA and MVPA and decreased ST were associated with 
reduced overall cardiometabolic risk and major individual risk factors. Change in 
LPA had weaker associations with changes in these cardiometabolic risk factors. Our 
findings suggest that increasing at least moderate‐intensity PA and decreasing ST 
decrease cardiometabolic risk in children.

from maximal exercise tests26,27 performed by the Ergoselect 
200 K® electromagnetic bicycle ergometer (Ergoline, Bitz, 
Germany) and the Cardiosoft® V6.5 Diagnostic System ECG 
device (GE Healthcare Medical Systems, Freiburg, Germany). 
The heart rate data were finally combined with trunk accel-
eration data in a branched equation model to estimate activ-
ity intensity time‐series,28 as described previously.29 PAEE 
was calculated by integrating the intensity time‐series, where 
time distribution of activity intensity was generated by using 
standard metabolic equivalents (METs) in 0.5 increments. 
Sleep duration was analyzed from the Actiheart recordings 
by a trained exercise specialist and confirmed by a physician, 
if necessary. The time of falling asleep was defined as accel-
erometer counts decreasing to zero and heart rate to a plateau 
level. The time of waking up was defined as accelerometer 
counts increasing and remaining above zero and heart rate 
increasing and remaining above the plateau level. We defined 
total ST as time spent in activity ≤1.5 METs excluding sleep 
and light PA (LPA), moderate PA (MPA), and VPA as time 
spent in activity >1.5 and ≤4.0 METs, >4.0 and ≤7.0 METs, 
and >7.0 METs, respectively, by defining 1 MET as 71.2 J/
min/kg. Moderate‐to‐vigorous PA (MVPA) included MPA 
and VPA.
2.3 | Assessment of cardiometabolic risk 
factors and calculation of cardiometabolic 
risk score
The children attended the examinations in the research fa-
cility between 7 am and 10 am having fasted for 12 hours. 
A research nurse measured blood pressure, assessed body 
size and composition, and took blood samples. Body height 
was measured three times using a calibrated wall‐mounted 
stadiometer to accuracy of 0.1 cm the children standing in 
the Frankfurt plane without shoes. We used the mean of 
the nearest two values in the analyses. Body weight was 
measured twice using the Inbody 720® bioimpedance de-
vice (Biospace, Seoul, Korea) to accuracy of 0.1 kg the 
children having emptied the bladder and wearing light 
underwear.30 We used the mean of the two values in the 
analyses. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by divid-
ing body weight (kg) with body height (m) squared. BMI‐
standard deviation score was calculated using Finnish 
reference data.31 Body fat percentage was measured using 
the Lunar® dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry device 
(Lunar Prodigy Advance; GE Medical Systems, Madison, 
WI, USA) the children being in the non‐fasting state, hav-
ing emptied the bladder, and being in light clothing with 
all metal objects removed.32 The assessment of fasting 
serum insulin and fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, 
high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low‐den-
sity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been explained 
previously.33 Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin 
Resistance (HOMA‐IR) was calculated using the formula 
fasting serum insulin (mU/L) × fasting plasma glucose 
(mmol/L)/22.5.34 Blood pressure was measured manually 
from the right arm using a calibrated Heine Gamma® G7 
aneroid sphygmomanometer (Heine, Optotechnic GmbH, 
Herrsching, Germany) to accuracy of 2 mm Hg. The meas-
urement protocol included a rest of 5 minutes and thereaf-
ter three measurements in the sitting position at 2‐minute 
intervals. The mean of all three measurements was used 
as the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We calculated 
the cardiometabolic risk score using continuous z‐score 
variables adjusted for age and sex using the formula, 
Zwaistcircumference +Zinsulin +Zglucose +Ztriglycerides−
ZHDLcholesterol +Ztheaverageofsystolicanddiastolicbloodpressure
a larger score indicating a higher cardiometabolic risk.35
2.4 | Assessment of pubertal status
A research physician assessed pubertal status using a 5‐stage 
scale described by Tanner.36 The boys were defined having 
entered clinical puberty if their testicular volume assessed by 
an orchidometer was ≥4 (Stage ≥ 2). The girls were defined 
having entered clinical puberty if their breast development 
had started (Stage ≥ 2).
2.5 | Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using the IBM 
SPSS Statistics software, Version 25.0 (IBM Corp. 
Armonk, NY, USA). To normalize skewed distributions, 
a natural logarithmic transformation was performed for 
waist circumference, body fat percentage, triglycerides, 
and HDL cholesterol, and a square root transformation 
was performed for insulin. Differences in basic charac-
teristics between sexes were tested using the independent 
samples T test for continuous variables with normal distri-
butions and the chi‐square test for categorical variables. 
The cross‐sectional associations of total ST, LPA, MVPA, 
VPA, and PAEE with the cardiometabolic risk score and 
independent cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline were 
analyzed using linear regression models adjusted for age, 
sex, and puberty. The longitudinal associations of changes 
in total ST, LPA, MVPA, VPA, and PAEE with changes 
in the cardiometabolic risk score and independent cardio-
metabolic risk factors during 2‐year follow‐up were ana-
lyzed using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, 
and the explanatory and outcome variables at baseline as 
well as the change in pubertal status during 2‐year follow‐
up. We adjusted the longitudinal data for the explanatory 
and outcome variables at baseline to control for varia-
tion in their initial levels that could affect the changes in 
these variables and thereby partly explain the associations

observed. We additionally adjusted the cross‐sectional 
data for baseline body fat percentage and the longitudi-
nal data for baseline body fat percentage and the change 
in body fat percentage during 2‐year follow‐up to study 
whether body fat content partly explained the associations 
observed. Adjustment for baseline lean body mass or the 
change in lean body mass had no effect on the cross‐sec-
tional or longitudinal associations, so these data are not 
presented in the results. Associations with P‐values <0.05 
were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
3.1 | Basic characteristics
Girls were shorter and lighter and had higher body fat per-
centage, smaller waist circumference, higher fasting serum 
insulin, and lower fasting plasma glucose compared to boys 
(Table 1). Furthermore, girls had longer total ST, higher 
LPA, and lower MVPA, VPA, and PAEE than boys.
3.2 | Cross‐sectional associations at baseline
Higher total ST was associated with a higher cardiometa-
bolic risk score, higher body fat percentage, waist circumfer-
ence, insulin, HOMA‐IR, glucose, systolic blood pressure, 
and diastolic blood pressure, and lower HDL cholesterol ad-
justed for age, sex, and puberty (Table 2). The associations 
of total ST with the cardiometabolic risk score (β = 0.116, 
P = 0.013), insulin (β = 0.138, P = 0.006), and HOMA‐IR 
(β = 0.141, P = 0.005) attenuated but remained statistically 
significant after further adjustment for body fat percentage. 
Total ST was not related to other cardiometabolic risk factors 
adjusted for body fat percentage.
Light physical activity was inversely associated with 
the cardiometabolic risk score, body fat percentage, waist 
circumference, insulin, HOMA‐IR, glucose, and diastolic 
blood pressure and was directly related to HDL choles-
terol adjusted for age, sex, and puberty (Table 2). The 
associations of LPA with the cardiometabolic risk score 
(β = −0.101, P = 0.022), insulin (β = −0.101, P = 0.034), 
and HOMA‐IR (β = −0.110, P = 0.022) weakened but 
remained statistically significant after additional adjust-
ment for body fat percentage. LPA was not associated with 
other cardiometabolic risk factors adjusted for body fat 
percentage.
Lower MVPA was associated with a higher cardiometa-
bolic risk score and higher body fat percentage, waist circum-
ference, insulin, HOMA‐IR, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, 
systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure ad-
justed for age, sex, and puberty (Table 2). The associations 
of MVPA with insulin (β = −0.125, P = 0.018), HOMA‐
IR (β = −0.120, P = 0.025), and systolic blood pressure 
(β = −0.114, P = 0.043) weakened but remained statistically 
significant after further adjustment for body fat percentage. 
MVPA was not related to other cardiometabolic risk factors 
adjusted for body fat percentage.
The inverse associations of VPA with the cardiometa-
bolic risk score, body fat percentage, waist circumference, 
insulin, HOMA‐IR, and LDL cholesterol were slightly 
weaker, and the direct association between VPA and HDL 
cholesterol was slightly stronger than the relationships of 
MVPA to these cardiometabolic risk factors after adjust-
ment for age, sex, and puberty (Table 2). The associations 
of VPA with cardiometabolic risk factors were no longer 
statistically significant after further adjustment for body fat 
percentage.
Lower PAEE was associated with a higher cardiomet-
abolic risk score and higher body fat percentage, waist 
circumference, insulin, HOMA‐IR, triglycerides, LDL 
cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood 
pressure adjusted for age, sex, and puberty (Table 2). 
The relationships of PAEE to cardiometabolic risk score 
(β = −0.103, P = 0.038), insulin (β = −0.146, P = 0.006), 
HOMA‐IR (β = −0.148, P = 0.006), and systolic blood 
pressure (β = −0.130, P = 0.022) weakened but remained 
statistically significant after further adjustment for body 
fat percentage. PAEE was not associated with other car-
diometabolic risk factors adjusted for body fat percentage.
3.3 | Longitudinal associations during 2‐
year follow‐up
Increased total ST was associated with an increased cardio-
metabolic risk score and increased body fat percentage, waist 
circumference, and insulin adjusted for age, sex, total ST, 
and respective cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline and 
incident puberty (Table 3). The association of increased total 
ST with an increased cardiometabolic risk score weakened 
but remained statistically significant after further adjustment 
for baseline body fat percentage and the change in body fat 
percentage (β = 0.155, P = 0.029). The change in total ST 
was not related to the change in insulin after adjustment 
for baseline body fat percentage and the change in body fat 
percentage.
The change in LPA was inversely associated with the 
change in the cardiometabolic risk score adjusted for age, 
sex, LPA, and the cardiometabolic risk score at baseline 
and incident puberty (Table 3). This relationship was no 
longer statistically significant after additional adjustment 
for baseline body fat percentage and the change in body 
fat percentage. The change in LPA was not associated with 
the changes in individual cardiometabolic risk factors ad-
justed for age, sex, LPA, respective cardiometabolic risk 
factors at baseline, and incident puberty (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
The main finding of this longitudinal study is that increased 
VPA, MVPA, and PAEE as well as decreased ST were associ-
ated with a reduced cardiometabolic risk score and decreased 
body fat percentage, waist circumference, fasting serum in-
sulin, and HOMA‐IR during 2‐year follow‐up in a general 
population of children. Moreover, increased VPA, MVPA, 
and PAEE were associated with elevated plasma HDL cho-
lesterol, and increased VPA was related to decreased plasma 
triglycerides. However, increased LPA was associated only 
with a decreased cardiometabolic risk score. We also found 
cross‐sectional associations of lower VPA, MVPA, LPA, and 
PAEE as well as longer total ST with a higher cardiometa-
bolic risk score and most of the individual cardiometabolic 
risk factors in children.
Our cross‐sectional findings on the inverse associations of 
MVPA and VPA with overall cardiometabolic risk, body fat 
content, and insulin resistance in children are in accordance 
with the results of some earlier cross‐sectional studies.1,20,37 
The results of the few previous prospective studies on the asso-
ciations of objectively measured PA with cardiometabolic risk 
factors in pediatric populations suggest that at least moderate‐
intensity PA is required to reduce cardiometabolic risk among

observed that increased VPA and MVPA were associated with 
decreased overall cardiometabolic risk, body fat content, and 
insulin resistance but also with reduced dyslipidemia during 
2‐year follow‐up in a general population of children.
Previous studies have mainly focused on the associations 
of MVPA, VPA, and total PA with cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors and therefore little is known about the relationships of 
LPA to cardiometabolic risk factors.38 However, there are 
some earlier cross‐sectional and prospective studies on the 
associations of LPA with cardiometabolic risk factors in 
children, but the results of these studies have been incon-
sistent.16,39 In our cross‐sectional analyses, lower LPA was 
associated with higher overall cardiometabolic risk, body 
fat content, insulin resistance, and fasting plasma glucose as 
well as lower plasma HDL cholesterol. In the longitudinal 
analyses, however, increased LPA was associated only with 
decreased overall cardiometabolic risk.
Earlier cross‐sectional studies have shown direct associ-
ations of screen time assessed by questionnaires with car-
diometabolic risk factors among children and adolescents.3,10 
However, previous cross‐sectional studies have found weak 
or no associations of objectively measured total ST with 
overall cardiometabolic risk, body fat content, plasma HDL 
cholesterol, and blood pressure among children.21,40,41 We 
observed direct cross‐sectional associations of total ST with 
the cardiometabolic risk score, body fat content, and insulin 
resistance in children. Importantly, there are few earlier lon-
gitudinal studies on the associations of objectively measured 
total ST with cardiometabolic risk factors in children.21,41 In 
our longitudinal analyses, ST was directly associated only 
with overall cardiometabolic risk among children.
The beneficial associations of PA and the harmful as-
sociations of ST with some cardiometabolic risk factors in 
children have been found to be partly explained by body 
fat content.13,42 In line with these results, we observed that 
body fat content partly explained the cross‐sectional and 
longitudinal associations of PA at different intensity levels 
and ST with cardiometabolic risk factors. Importantly, the 
longitudinal associations of VPA and PAEE with overall 
cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia 
and the longitudinal association between ST and overall car-
diometabolic risk remained even after controlling for body 
fat content. However, the longitudinal associations of LPA 
and MVPA with cardiometabolic risk factors did not persist 
after taking body fat content into account. These findings 
suggest that the associations of increased vigorous PA with 
decreased overall cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance, 
and dyslipidemia and the association between decreased ST 
and reduced overall cardiometabolic risk are explained also 
by other physiological mechanisms than change in body fat 
content. One of these mechanisms could be enhanced insulin 
sensitivity in skeletal muscle in response to exercise train-
ing.43,44 The results of some studies suggest that increasing at 
least moderate‐intensity PA improves insulin sensitivity in-
dependent of adiposity not only in adults but also in children 
and adolescents.2,45 Moreover, there is some evidence that 
sedentary behavior impairs endothelial function, increases 
oxidative stress, and elevates blood pressure independent of 
adiposity among children and youth.9,19,20,40,46
The strengths of the present study include the relatively 
large population sample of children, the longitudinal study 
design with 2‐year follow‐up, the objective and valid assess-
ment of free‐living movement behavior, as well as the com-
prehensive and detailed assessment of cardiometabolic risk 
factors, and possible confounding factors. These character-
istics of the study enabled us to investigate and compare the 
magnitude of the associations of the changes in PA at differ-
ent intensity levels and the change in ST with the changes 
in a number of cardiometabolic risk factors in a general 
population of children. Even though we used a longitudinal 
approach, however, we cannot draw conclusions about the 
causality of the relationships of PA and ST with cardiometa-
bolic risk factors among children.
A limitation of our study is that the assessment of move-
ment behavior by the Actiheart® monitor, which combines 
information of heart rate and body movements, may overesti-
mate LPA and underestimate ST because not only PA but also 
sympathetic activation at rest increases heart rate.47-49 In case 
of some children, it may also have been difficult to deter-
mine the time of falling asleep or waking up which may en-
tail some error into ST estimation. Moreover, Actiheart® is a 
device for measuring the intensity and energy expenditure of 
PA but not different types of PA that reflect PA as a behavior. 
Another limitation of the study is the use of relatively long 
epochs during the Actiheart® recording, because 60‐second 
epochs may have limited our ability to detect the relatively 
common intermittent bouts of PA among children.50

CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal study showed that increased VPA, MVPA, 
and PAEE and decreased total ST were associated with re-
duced overall cardiometabolic risk and major individual 
cardiometabolic risk factors, including adiposity, insulin 
resistance, and dyslipidemia, among school‐aged children. 
Increased LPA had weaker associations with changes in 
cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings suggest that in-
creasing at least moderate‐intensity PA provides additional 
cardiometabolic benefits, including decreased overall car-
diometabolic risk, reduced adiposity, improved insulin sensi-
tivity, decreased plasma triglycerides, and increased plasma 
HDL cholesterol, beyond less intensive PA among children. 
Our observations also suggest that not only increasing at least 
moderate‐intensity PA but also decreasing total ST improves 
cardiometabolic health in children.

PERSPECTIVES
The findings of our longitudinal study emphasize increas-
ing at least moderate‐intensity PA and decreasing total ST 
to improve cardiometabolic health in general populations 
of school‐aged children. Long‐term follow‐up and inter-
vention studies starting in childhood and having objective 
measures of PA and ST and comprehensive assessments of 
cardiometabolic risk factors are needed to provide further 
evidence for the beneficial effects of increasing PA and 
decreasing sedentary ST in reducing cardiometabolic risk 
later in life.
