ABSTRACT
Aims
To test the efficacy of the Tobacco Status Project (TSP) Facebook smoking cessation intervention for young
adults relative to referral to an on-line program on biochemically verified 7-day abstinence from smoking.
Design
Two-group parallel randomized controlled trial, comparing TSP (n = 251) to on-line control (n = 249) with
follow-up to 12 months. Setting
On-line, throughout the United States. Participants
Young adult cigarette
smokers (mean age 21 years; 73% white, 55% female, 87% daily smokers). Interventions and comparator
TSP
provided private Facebook groups tailored to stage of change to quit smoking, daily contacts, weekly live counseling
sessions, and for those ready to quit, six cognitive behavioral therapy counseling sessions. Some TSP groups were
assigned randomly to receive a monetary incentive for engagement. Control provided referral to the National Cancer
Institute Smokefree.gov website. Measurements: primary outcome
Biochemically verified 7-day abstinence over
12 months. Secondary outcomes
Post-treatment (3-month) abstinence; reported abstinence, quit attempt,
reduction in smoking, readiness to quit smoking over 12 months. Findings
Verified 7-day abstinence was not
significantly different for intervention compared with control over 1 year: month 3 (8.3 versus 3.2%), 6 (6.2 versus
6.0%), and 12 (5.9 versus 10.0%); odds ratio (OR) = 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23, 4.97;
retention = 71%. There was an effect at 3 months (OR = 2.52; CI = 1.56, 4.04; P < 0.0001). There were no
12-month treatment effects for reported abstinence (P = 0.746), reduction in smoking by 50% or more
(P = 0.533), likelihood of having made a quit attempt (P = 0.387) or stage of change over time (0.968). Partici-
pants in TSP engaged more and rated the intervention more favorably than those in the control condition.
Conclusions
Compared with referral to a smoking cessation website, a novel USA-focused Facebook smoking ces-
sation intervention did not improve abstinence from smoking over 1 year, but increased abstinence at the end of
treatment and was engaging to participants.

INTRODUCTION
Tobacco kills more than 7 million people each year world-
wide [1], and young adulthood is the age at which people
are most likely to smoke. In the United States, one in four
young adults reported past month cigarette use in 2016
[2]. Almost all smokers (98%) report starting before
the age of 26 years [3], and more than 2000 US youth
and young adults become daily cigarette smokers each
day [3,4].
Young adults are just as motivated to quit as other adult
age groups, yet are less likely to use evidence-based treat-
ments for smoking cessation (e.g. medication, counseling,
quit lines [5–7]. On-line programs offer the potential for
expanding the reach of cessation services; however, large
drop-offs in engagement have been observed over time
[8–13].
Social media have been harnessed to disseminate infor-
mation widely about a broad range of health concerns, in-
cluding smoking cessation [14–17]. Facebook, the most

 popular social media platform in the United States, is used
by 88% of US young adults aged 18–29, 79% of whom
access it daily [18], making it promising to deliver public
health messaging. Reports of smoking cessation support
groups on Facebook have shown the platform to be useful
for sharing experiences and providing encouragement and
information [19], engaging young adults concerning
tobacco prevention [20] and show positive short-term
outcomes (e.g. 25% reported 7-day abstinence at 2 weeks
in a pilot feasibility study of adults motivated to quit
smoking (n = 15) [21]; 47% reported 7-day abstinence
at 3 months in a trial including web and social-media
components for young adults ready to quit smoking
(n = 102) [22]. Research is needed to determine whether
a Facebook intervention, without additional supports, is
efficacious for both those ready and not ready to quit
smoking; whether abstinence can be verified biochemi-
cally; and whether abstinence rates can be maintained
past 3 months.
Using Facebook, our group developed the Tobacco
Status Project (TSP), a motivationally tailored smoking
cessation intervention. TSP is a 90-day cessation program
combining Facebook posts tailored to participants’ readi-
ness to quit smoking with weekly live group counseling
sessions. Given the success of monetary incentives in
recruiting participants to randomized clinical trials [23]
and in yielding short-term abstinence to substance use
[24] among previous studies, we additionally randomized
participants to receive a monetary incentive tied to
engagement in the intervention. An initial feasibility trial
with 79 young adults in seven Facebook groups achieved
self-reported 7-day abstinence rates of 21% at 6 months
(9% of 79 biochemically verified) and 18% at 12 months
(9% verified) [25]; 92% of participants remained in a
Facebook group for the full 3-month intervention; and
61% (48/79) commented on at least one post, with more
commenting among those randomized to receive a mone-
tary incentive (median 16) compared to no incentive
(median = 7) [26].
The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to
test the hypothesis that among young adult smokers of cig-
arettes, the TSP Facebook intervention would result in
greater biochemically verified abstinence from smoking rel-
ative to awebsite referral control condition over 12months.
Secondary outcomes included a comparison of biochemi-
cally verified point prevalence at the end of treatment
(3 months), and reported 7-day abstinence, reduction in
cigarettes smoked, whether a quit attempt was made and
readiness to quit smoking (proportion in preparation, ac-
tion or maintenance stage of change) over 12 months.
We also examined patterns and correlates of engagement
in both groups, and evaluated a monetary incentive for en-
gagement in the TSP intervention as a moderator of en-
gagement and smoking abstinence.
METHODS
Study design
A parallel, two-group, randomized controlled trial with
follow-up assessments conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months
was used. Details about study design, intervention and con-
trol condition, and measures are reported elsewhere [27].
Participants
Participants were recruited over 10 months from October
2014 to July 2015, primarily from Facebook, based on an
advertisement campaign developed and used previously
by the team [28]. Advertisements included a link to the
study’s website on Qualtrics [29] with a description of the
study and an eligibility survey. Inclusion criteria were
English-literate young adults, aged 18–25 years, who re-
ported smoking ≥ 100 cigarettes in their life-times; and at
the time of recruitment reported smoking at least one cig-
arette per day on 3 or more days of the week on average.
Intention to quit smoking was not required for trial enroll-
ment; the intervention and control conditions were tai-
lored to stage of change for quitting smoking. Additional
inclusion criteria were regular Facebook use (≥ 4 days per
week) and access to a digital camera (e.g. on a phone or
computer) to send a picture as part of the biochemical val-
idation procedure (see ‘Outcome measures’ below). Indi-
viduals who had participated in the TSP feasibility study
were excluded [25]. In total, 500 participants completed
a baseline assessment and were randomized to a study con-
dition (Fig. 1).
Study procedure
The UCSF Institutional Review Board approved the study
procedures. Informed consent to participate was obtained
on-line through the study website. Three multiple-choice
questions confirmed understanding of study risks [30];
identity was verified by e-mail or social media; the on-line
baseline assessment link was then e-mailed. Following
baseline completion, the participants were randomized
to TSP (n = 251) or control (n = 249) 1 : 1 using a
blocked random assignment sequence generated by the
study biostatistician (K.L.D.). The randomization table
was held by D.E.R. and the research assistants obtained
the group assignment once the baseline assessment was
completed.
Randomization
was
stratified
by
daily
smoking status (yes/no) and stage of change for quitting
smoking pre-contemplation, contemplation and prepara-
tion [31], variables known to be related to outcomes
and addressed by the intervention [32]. Within the TSP
condition, participants were placed in a Facebook group
tailored to stage of change. All groups were assigned
randomly 1 : 1 to a monetary incentive condition (daily,

 weekly, monthly or no incentive), within stage of change
(pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation), using
a scheme generated by the biostatistician and held by
the first author. TSP groups began on a rolling basis
starting when the first participant had been waiting no
longer than 2 weeks; thus, group size varied [26,27].
Twenty-nine Facebook secret groups were created (nine
pre-contemplation, 11 contemplation and nine prepara-
tion; group size ranged from three to 18). Groups were
open for the duration of the trial (12 months), although
content was generated by the study team only for the
first 3 months.
Immediately after randomization, participants in both
conditions were linked by e-mail to the Smokefree.gov
website and encouraged to use it actively for the duration
of the trial. Assessments were conducted on-line at base-
line, 3, 6 and 12 months’ follow-up. In both conditions,
participants received their choice of gift cards in the
amount of $20 per assessment and a $20 bonus for com-
pleting all three assessments, for a total possible incentive
of $100.
Interventions
Tobacco Status Project (TSP) intervention
The TSP was implemented entirely through ‘secret’ (i.e. en-
tirely private) Facebook groups. TSP participants were
assigned to a Facebook group matched to their baseline
stage of change for quitting smoking (pre-contemplation,
contemplation, preparation). The group-based interven-
tion had three main features.
First,
Facebook
posts
containing
evidence-based
smoking cessation strategies were designed to be delivered
each day for 90 days via Facebook. Posts were based on the
US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation [5]
and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change
[33]. Posts in all groups included a combination of images,
videos and text designed to reflect the experience of young
adults and elicit a response from participants (see
Supporting information, Appendix S1 for a sample of posts
in each group).
Secondly, the intervention incorporated weekly ‘The Dr
Is In’ live sessions with a PhD-level smoking cessation
counselor, during which the counselor provided some lim-
ited content for discussion and participants could ask ques-
tions and receive support using Facebook commenting
features. Content for sessions was based initially on motiva-
tional interviewing, and cognitive behavioral coping skills
for smoking cessation were discussed as participants were
ready to make a quit attempt.
Thirdly, in the preparation groups, six manualized
45-minute cognitive–behavioral treatment (CBT) sessions
over 12 weeks were delivered biweekly through Facebook
events (a tool for scheduling live communications on
Facebook’s newsfeed within private groups). Sessions
were adapted for social media delivery from a tobacco
treatment manual targeted to adolescents and young
adults [34,35] that attended to peer relationships, family
influences and the co-use of alcohol and illicit drugs.

 Group members could attend the events live, and had ac-
cess to session content throughout the 90-day interven-
tion period.
Additionally, and only in TSP groups, groups were ran-
domized to one of four incentive conditions tied to engage-
ment in the intervention (daily, weekly, monthly or no
incentive). Participants in incentive groups could earn
giftcards based on comments made to Facebook posts at
the end of the assigned period [$1 (or $0) each day in the
daily condition, $7 (or $0) each week in the weekly condi-
tion, and $30 (or $0) each month in the monthly condi-
tion], up to a maximum of $90 at the end of the 90-day
intervention. This was in addition to the $100 incentive
that all study participants could earn for completing
follow-up assessments. Of the 29 groups, seven were
assigned randomly to receive no incentive, six daily, eight
weekly and eight monthly incentives.
Control group
Participants received a referral to the National Cancer In-
stitute’s Smokefree.gov website. Features include a website
tailored to readiness to quit smoking, a texting program,
Smartphone application, on-line live chat and a Facebook
page. The site includes programs for general adults,
women, Spanish-speaking adults and teens. The treat-
ments available to control participants met US Clinical
Practice Guidelines for treating nicotine dependence [5].
Measures
Primary outcome measure
The primary outcome was biochemically verified 7-day
point prevalence abstinence over 12 months as recom-
mended by the Society for Research on Nicotine and To-
bacco Workgroup on abstinence measures [36]. At each
follow-up assessment participants reporting ‘no smoking,
not even a puff’ in the past 7 days were coded as abstinent
from cigarettes and mailed a NicAlert saliva cotinine test
strip with previously established diagnostic accuracy [37]
and asked to record two pictures: one giving a saliva sam-
ple and another of the test result. Participants with a sali-
vary cotinine level < 11 ng/ml [38] were considered
confirmed non-smokers. If participants indicated active
use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or an electronic
nicotine delivery system (ENDS; e.g. an e-cigarette) to aid
in smoking cessation, saliva cotinine confirmed abstinence
and reported NRT/ENDS use were recorded and reported
separately from biochemically verified abstinence. In
analyses, those who reported abstinence from all other
tobacco than an e-cigarette to quit smoking and returned
saliva cotinine results showing a cotinine range between
11–30 ng/ml were treated as abstinent.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes included: (1) biochemically verified
abstinence at treatment end (3 months); (2) reported
7-day abstinence from cigarettes (including all reports of
abstinence not verified biochemically); (3) reduction of
cigarette consumption by 50% or more (yes/no) between
baseline and each follow-up; (4) presence of at least one
24-hour tobacco quit attempt in the assessment time
period (yes/no); and (5) proportion of participants in prep-
aration, action or maintenance stages of change at all
time-points [33].
Baseline measures
We assessed participants’ age, gender, race/ethnicity,
completed education, annual income, housing stability,
employment, marital status and smoking history [39]. Ad-
ditional measures included the Fagerström Test of Cigarette
Dependence (FTCD) [40]; a three-item Social Smoking
measure used previously with young adults [41]; and the
Thoughts about Abstinence scale (desire, success and diffi-
culty, rated on 10-point scales and goal-related to smoking
coded as 0 = no goal, 1 = intermediate goal or 2 = quitting
for good) [42].
Treatment acceptability/engagement
An eight-item measure, used in our prior work [25], was
administered at intervention end (3 months) to assess
whether the intervention components in each condition
were accessed and general reactions (e.g. ‘The [interven-
tion] was helpful’). The items were reported on a four-point
scale from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’. Propor-
tions of those reporting ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ were
computed for each item. In addition, for TSP
, participant
comments were tallied across all intervention content
(study-generated posts, user-generated posts, live sessions
and CBT sessions) during the 3-month intervention period
(comment volume).
Data analyses
To examine abstinence versus smoking status at the 3–12-
month follow-ups by condition (the primary hypothesis),
we estimated and tested a logistic regression model using
a mixed-effects model (via PROC GLIMMIX in SAS version
9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The model accounted
for dependence of responses within individuals attributable
to repeated measures and, clustering effects due to treat-
ment group membership, for dependence of responses
within Facebook groups, and allowed us to derive effect es-
timates from all available data. Analysis was conducted
first using all available data included in the modeling and
participants assigned to the treatment condition to which
they were randomized. We chose this strategy because it

 is consistent with current statistical practice [43,44], con-
cerns put forth by a Society for Research on Nicotine and
Tobacco task force on analysis in clinical trials [45], and
published trials from our group [39,46]. The independent
variables were TSP versus control condition and time, plus
variables that are known to be related to successful quit-
ting (daily smoking status and stage of change at baseline).
The outcome variable was verified abstinence, treating re-
ported ENDS or NRT use for cessation as abstinent as long
as no other nicotine or tobacco product was used. The
study was powered to detect differences of approximately
5% in rates of use [27]. Follow-up logistic regression
analyses compared abstinence at treatment end (3 months)
between treatment and control groups, with the same
covariates as the primary analysis. Reported abstinence,
50% reduction in cigarettes/week and making a 24-hour
quit attempt were modeled similarly. To be consistent with
some of the literature, the analysis of the primary outcome
was repeated after imputing all missing data as positive for
smoking (i.e. intent-to-treat).
Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare comment
volume by stage of change and incentive condition. Bivar-
iate models predicted whether demographic and smoking
variables predicted comment volume. Two analyses tested
the effects of comment volume (Wilcoxon’s signed rank)
and incentive (Person’s χ2) on 3-month abstinence. Out-
come variables were biochemically verified abstinence
and self-reported abstinence.
RESULTS
Retention
Participant characteristics are in Table 1. Follow-up
completion was 71.0% (355 of 500) at 3 months, 68.4%
(342 of 500) at 6 months and 70.8% (354 of 500) at 12
months with no difference in number of follow-up
assessments completed between treatment and control
(χ2 = 3.64, P = 0.302), baseline readiness to quit smoking
(χ2 = 6.673, P = 0.352), daily smoking status (χ2 = 1.231,
P = 0.746) nor, among those in the TSP condition
(n = 251), assignment to a group with a monetary incen-
tive (χ2 = 5.69, P = 0.770). Forty participants (16%) left
their Facebook group at some point during the 3-month in-
tervention period, with dropout greatest among those in
pre-contemplation (24%) compared to contemplation
(10%) or preparation (18%; χ2 = 6.79, P = 0.033).
Primary outcome: biochemically verified 7-day abstinence
Smoking status throughout 12 months is reported in
Table 2. We obtained saliva cotinine test results on approx-
imately half of participants self-reporting abstinence at
3 months (22 of 36; 61%), 6 months (24 of 50; 48%)
and 12 months (34 of 69; 49%), with no difference in
receipt of cotinine test results by treatment condition. In
analyses using available data, and considering those who
reported using only ENDS as abstinent from cigarettes, we
modeled the abstinence rates over 12 months and found
no significant difference by treatment condition [(month
3 [8.3% vs. 3.2%]), 6 [6.2% vs. 6.0%], and 12 [5.9% vs.
10.0%]; odds ratio (OR) = 1.07; 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 0.23, 4.97; P = 0.924; Table 3]. Re-analysis with
missing data coded as smoking produced similar results
(OR = 1.0; CI = 0.24, 4.46; P = 0.969). Five participants
reported sustained abstinence throughout 12 months
(two treatment; three control).
Secondary outcomes
Comparisons between treatment and control at treatment
end (3 months), controlling for baseline stage of change
and daily smoking status, found a significant difference be-
tween treatment and control (OR = 2.52; CI = 1.56, 4.04;
P <0.0001). Findingsweresimilarwith missing= smoking
(OR = 2.71 (CI = 1.02–7.22; P = 0.039). Readiness to quit
and daily smoking at baseline predicted abstinence over the
12 months, with daily smokers and those in preparation
more likely to be abstinent over time than those in pre-
contemplation (Table 3).
Self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence was
13.6% (23 of 169) for treatment and 7.5% (14 of 186)
for control participants at the 3-month follow-up, 18.6%
(29 of 156) and 14.5% (25 of 172) at 6 months and
21.8% (37 of 170) and 20.8% (38 of 183) at 12 months,
respectively, with OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 0.26, 6.36;
P = 0.746 for the overall model; Table 3. Abstinence in-
creased over 1 year in both groups, with the largest abso-
lute difference between groups at 3 months (6.1%).
There were no significant treatment effects over 12 months
for reduction in cigarettes smoked, quit attempts or likeli-
hood of being ready to quit or quit (Table 3).
Treatment engagement
Participants in both groups rated the extent to which study
treatment materials were engaging and useful (Fig. 2). TSP
participants gave significantly higher ratings on all mea-
sures compared to the control condition (all P < 0.001).
Highest ratings were for ease of understanding the inter-
vention (96%), thinking about what they read (92%) and
believing the material gave sound advice (91%).
Among TSP participants, 77% (n = 192) commented at

plation (median = 7; IQR = 0–57). Groups with an incen-

DISCUSSION
The TSP Facebook quit smoking intervention did not re-
duce significantly the odds of a biochemically verified quit
over 12 months when compared to an evidence-based
website. However, this study, the first to report use of
Facebook as a smoking cessation intervention, resulted
in a high level of engagement, a good level of active par-
ticipation and limited dropout. In secondary analyses,
end-of-treatment differences were found between TSP
and the control condition on 3-month biochemically ver-
ified abstinence. The lack of differences over 1 year may
reflect as much the relatively low compliance to bio-
chemical verification procedures as actual lack of differ-
ences between conditions; certainly, compliance needs
to be increased if biochemically verification is to be used
as the gold standard in internet-based studies. The loss of
differences in abstinence to 12 months also suggests the
potential value of extending the intervention duration.
The intervention did not result in differences in reported
abstinence, reduction in smoking, likelihood of a quit at-
tempt or readiness to quit smoking over 12 months. The
null findings to 1-year follow-up may be due to the rela-
tively short duration of the 3-month intervention and
the inclusion of young adult smokers not ready to quit.
Interventions aimed at engaging and treating smokers
not prepared to quit have typically extended intervention
contacts to 12 months with an 18-month follow-up, and
have demonstrated increases in abstinence over time
[46,47].
TSP was engaging for young adults, with limited drop-
out, and generally solicited active participation comparable
to or greater than other social media intervention

 programs [22,48,49], especially given that only one-
quarter of the TSP group indicated a desire to quit at inter-
vention start. In the control condition, our quit rates were
similar to those found in other clinical trials with referral to
Smokfree.gov as a condition (e.g. 6.8% [50] and 10% [51]
reported
abstinence
among
motivated
adults
after
3 months).
In both treatment conditions, as expected, abstinence
over time was more likely among those in preparation
compared to contemplation or pre-contemplation. Within
the TSP condition, despite not being ready to quit, those in
pre-contemplation commented as frequently as those
ready in the next month (preparation). This suggests that
the social media environment can be an engaging tobacco
treatment tool for those not ready to quit. Those not ready
to quit may have participated in the trial solely for incen-
tives, yet the engagement in these groups suggests that a
longer intervention could aid this group in moving toward
abstinence. In our feasibility trial, content related to deci-
sional balance (increasing the pros and decreasing the
cons of change) was most engaging in both pre-
contemplation and contemplation groups [52], and its
prominence in the pre-contemplation groups was probably
also engaging in the clinical trial. Those in contemplation,
however, were less engaged, suggesting that the content
may not have been as well designed as in the other two
groups. Indeed, commenting was also less frequent in con-
templation groups than other groups in the feasibility trial
[25]; while changes were made, additional changes may
be needed to engage those in contemplation in a future de-
livery of the TSP
. A more detailed examination of engage-
ment by content type and group factors (e.g. size) is
warranted.
The effectiveness of a monetary incentive at increasing
engagement in the TSP group shows that, for widespread
dissemination, monetary incentives may be needed to
maximize participation, especially for those ready to quit
during the next 6 months. Cost-effectiveness analysis is
warranted and planned for the future. Although engage-
ment in TSP was unrelated to abstinence in this study, this
is probably due in part to low power to detect an effect
given a relatively low abstinence rate.
Three intervention strategies were used with varying
success. A high proportion of engagement with daily
posting and ‘The Dr Is In’ live sessions (77% commented
at least once) suggest that content delivered ‘publicly’
within groups was effective at engaging users. While it
is impossible to discern from a wholly digital study
whether viewing a post was associated with behavior
change, and we used a proxy of commenting to measure
engagement, it is likely that many more users who did
not comment still engaged in some way with the inter-
vention and may have changed their thoughts and/or be-
haviors as a result. Additional research should evaluate
whether engagement varied by content or design features
of postings or individual characteristics of participants.
CBT
sessions
implemented
in
‘events’
within
the
Facebook groups were less engaging. CBT sessions that
were implemented using Facebook’s private messaging
feature in the feasibility trial of TSP [25] were moved to
a more public format within the private Facebook groups
for this trial to maximize reach within groups. Unfortu-
nately, engagement in the organized events for these ses-
sions still remained low (16% of those in preparation
commented at least once), suggesting that live sessions
within groups were a better use of counselor time. ‘The
Dr Is In’ sessions were more effective, and may be the
only strategy needed for live sessions in future interven-
tion delivery.
Our study sample was similar to the US population of
smokers, with almost half men and almost three-quarters
non-Hispanic white. Our study recruited 45% males, more
than other on-line smoking cessation trials, which tend
to have a majority of women [53,54]. Social media, or at
least Facebook, may be particularly useful for engaging
young men in tobacco treatment. Our intervention was
designed to appeal to the general audience of young
adult smokers and it is unknown whether it would be as
engaging to vulnerable smokers [e.g. mental health popu-
lations, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning,
queer (LGBTQ)+-identified young adults]. Trials evaluat-
ing the efficacy of the TSP to tailored interventions for
special populations are under way (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT03163303, NCT03259360). Although nicotine re-
placement is recommended by the clinical practice guide-
lines for smoking cessation [5], the large proportion of
participants smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes per day
suggested that nicotine replacement would not be indi-
cated for most participants. We did not provide nicotine
replacement in this study, and no participant reported
using nicotine replacement in a cessation attempt during
the trial, despite a majority of participants reporting at
least one quit attempt at each time-point. In contrast,
ENDS use, common among young adults [55], was re-
ported as a quit strategy. The pros and cons of using
ENDS for cessation should be addressed in smoking cessa-
tion interventions with young adults. Overall quit rates
in the trial were fairly low; provision of nicotine replace-
ment as an adjunct to the on-line treatment may help to
improve these rates in future studies, albeit with a threat
to external validity given its lack of dissemination in the
real world.
Limitations include that some groups in the TSP condi-
tion (rather than control) received a monetary incentive
for engagement. There is some debate as to the utility of
the Transtheoretical Model as a predictor of smoking cessa-
tion [56], yet many studies have found it to lead to short-
and long-term smoking cessation [57–65].

 CONCLUSIONS
The social media intervention had a significant effect on
abstinence while the intervention was active. Once re-
moved, the treatment effects were not sustained in
follow-up assessments to 1 year. The intervention modality
and channel appears effective in reaching and engaging
young adult smokers, which has been a challenging group
to treat. Future work should examine feasible strategies for
sustaining the effects, perhaps with more extended inter-
ventions, given the chronicity of tobacco addiction and
the major health harms accumulated with continued
smoking.
