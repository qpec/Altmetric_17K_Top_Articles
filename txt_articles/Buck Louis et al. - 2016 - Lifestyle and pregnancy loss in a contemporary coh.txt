Abstract
 Objective—To estimate pregnancy loss incidence in a contemporary cohort of couples whose 
lifestyles were measured during sensitive windows of reproduction to identify factors associated 
with pregnancy loss for the continual refinement of preconception guidance.
 Design—Prospective cohort with preconception enrollment.
 Setting—16 counties in Michigan and Texas.
 Patients—344 couples with a singleton pregnancy followed daily through 7 post-conception 
weeks of gestation.
 Interventions—None. Daily, couples recorded use of cigarettes, caffeinated and alcoholic 
beverages, and multivitamins. Women used fertility “monitors” for ovulation detection and digital 
pregnancy tests. Pregnancy loss was denoted by conversion to a negative pregnancy test, onset of

 menses or clinical confirmation depending upon gestation. Using proportional hazards regression 
and accounting for right censoring, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (aHR; 95% CI) for couples’ lifestyles (cigarette smoking, alcoholic and caffeinated 
drinks, multivitamins) during three sensitive windows: preconception, early pregnancy and 
periconception.
 Main outcomes measured—Incidence and risk factors for pregnancy loss.
 Results—98/344 (28%) women with a singleton pregnancy experienced an observed 
pregnancy loss. In the preconception window, loss was associated with female age ≥35 years 
(1.96; 1.13-3.38) accounting for couples’ ages, female and male consumption >2 daily caffeinated 
beverages (1.74; 1.07-2.81 and 1.73; 1.10-2.72, respectively), and females’ vitamin adherence 
(0.45; 0.25-0.80). The findings were similar for lifestyle during the early pregnancy and 
periconception windows.
 Conclusions—Couples’ preconception lifestyle factors were associated with pregnancy loss, 
though women’s multivitamin adherence dramatically reduced risk. The findings support continual 
refinement and implementation of preconception guidance.

 Introduction
Over the past few decades, the detection of pregnancy for many women not receiving 
infertility treatment has shifted from clinical settings to the privacy of the home. This change 
is largely attributed to the development of a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) beta-
subunit radioimmunoassay (1), leading to the availability of the first early pregnancy test in 
1976. Currently, there are ≈60 home pregnancy test kits available in the U.S. accounting for 
approximately $228 million in annual sales (2,3). Home pregnancy tests now generate more 
revenue than any other over-the-counter home diagnostic test, including those for blood 
pressure or glucose testing (4), and are used by approximately 85%-90% of women for 
identifying pregnancy (5).
The shift in pregnancy detection from the clinical setting to the home means that women 
may now recognize more pregnancies than they did when clinical identification was the 
norm, usually occurring after 1-2 missed periods. To date, only a few prospective cohort 
studies with preconception enrollment of women or couples have ever been conducted 
worldwide to estimate the incidence of pregnancy loss. Overall, loss rates range from a low 
of 8% among 92 pregnant women in Newcastle, UK (6) to a high of 52% among 118 
pregnant women in Southampton, UK (7). Recent data from the U.S. National Survey of 
Family Growth noted an increasing pattern of self-reported miscarriage between 1970 and 
2000, with much of the increase being for losses in the first 7 weeks of gestation, possibly 
reflecting women’s use of home pregnancy testing (8). While various risk factors have been 
identified from past research ranging from health and pregnancy history to lifestyle, recent 
guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes the absence

 of any known interventions to prevent pregnancy loss except for anti-phospholipid syndrome 
and progesterone supplementation for recurrent losses (9).
Another notable societal change in pregnancy is the shift in thinking from pregnant females 
to pregnant couples, as evident by colloquial terms such as “we are pregnant” along with the 
early and sustained involvement of male partners during prenatal care and delivery in many 
cases. Despite such changes, research has traditionally focused on characteristics of either 
the female or male partner relative to pregnancy loss but not both in light of few couple-
based cohorts.
We sought to estimate the incidence of pregnancy loss and lifestyle risk factors in a 
contemporary cohort of couples desiring pregnancy who were recruited prior to conception 
and followed throughout trying and pregnancy. This design facilitated the capture of early 
pregnancy and losses consistent with the time period in which most losses occur. Pregnancy 
loss is an endpoint indicative of reproductive and/or developmental toxicity that may be 
associated with a variety of environmental exposures. Another unique aspect of this design is 
the ability to assess potential male-mediated risk factors for pregnancy loss such as age, 
employment and use of cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine in the context of women’s lifestyle 
(10-13). As such, this approach goes beyond most of the available research conducted to 
date that focuses exclusively on female determinants and offers insight for preconception 
guidance that is increasingly focusing on both men and women.
 Material and Methods
 Study Design and Population
The study cohort comprised 347/501 (69%) women who had an observed pregnancy while 
participating in the LIFE Study, which was designed and powered to examine the association 
between environmental and lifestyle factors and fecundity impairment among couples, 
including pregnancy loss. We excluded three couples with twin pregnancies resulting in a 
cohort comprising 344 couples with singleton pregnancies. The LIFE Study utilized 
population-based sampling frameworks to recruit couples discontinuing contraception for 
purposes of becoming pregnant from 16 counties in Michigan and Texas. By design, 
eligibility criteria were minimal and included: 1) in a committed relationship; 2) ability to 
communicate in English or Spanish; 3) females aged 18-40 and males aged ≥18 years; 4) 
females’ menstrual cycles between 21-42 days as required by the fertility monitors; 5) no 
history of injectable hormonal contraception in past year or currently breastfeeding for 6+ 
months; 6) no clinically diagnosed infertility in either partner; and 7) off contraception <2 
months. Prior to enrollment, female partners’ urines were tested to ensure they were not 
pregnant. Human subjects approval was obtained from participating institutions, and all men 
and women gave written informed consent before data collection. Complete details about the 
population-based sampling framework utilized along with response rates have been 
previously published (14).

  Data Collection and Follow-up
Couples were interviewed individually upon enrollment to ascertain socio-demographic, 
lifestyle, and medical history information, followed by the measurement of height and 
weight to calculate body mass index (BMI). The couple was then instructed in the 
completion of daily journals to record their lifestyle behaviors in a manner consistent with 
how people think about such exposures (e.g., number of cigarettes smoked per day, number 
of alcoholic and caffeinated beverages consumed per day, taking daily multivitamins). 
Females also reported sexual intercourse, menses, and home pregnancy test results. Couples 
completed journals daily until a positive home pregnancy test or up to 12 months of trying. 
Pregnant women continued journals daily through 7 post-conception weeks gestation then 
monthly journals until a loss or delivery. Journals were purposefully designed to be short to 
minimize participant burden and encourage daily adherence.
Standardized prompts were provided in the daily journals regarding lifestyle. Specifically, 
one alcoholic drink equaled one can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine, a shot of liquor, or a 
mixed drink. A caffeinated drink equaled a cup of coffee, tea, or can of soda (excluding 
decaffeinated or caffeine free beverages). Vitamins included over-the-counter multivitamins 
and prescription prenatal vitamins, and were dichotomized relative to daily usage (yes/no). 
Couples reported the daily number of cigarettes smoked and alcoholic and/or caffeinated 
beverages consumed, and were instructed to record a zero if none was used. Couples had the 
option of reporting data via the web or in returning weekly journal cards consistent with 
prospective measurement.
 Home Fertility and Pregnancy Testing
Women were trained in the use of the Clearblue® Fertility Monitor (Inverness Medical 
Innovations, Waltham, MA), a urinary test kit that tracks estrone-3-glucuronide and 
luteinizing hormone (LH) to predict the day of ovulation and help couples time intercourse 
to maximize their chances of conceiving. In comparison to the gold standard of 
ultrasonography for the detection of ovulation, the monitor is reported to accurately detect 
the LH surge (99%) (15). Women also were trained in the use of the Clearblue® digital 
pregnancy test, which has demonstrated sensitivity and reliability for detecting 25 mIU/mL 
of hCG, and demonstrated accuracy by women (16). Women tested their urine for pregnancy 
on the day they expected menstruation consistent with manufacturer’s guidance. Pregnancy 
loss was defined as conversion to a negative pregnancy test, clinical confirmation, or onset of 
menstruation depending upon gestational dating and included two women with ectopic 
pregnancies. Three twin pregnancies were excluded from analysis.
 Statistical Analysis
The cohort was first characterized by pregnancy outcome to identify factors associated with 
loss, with significance based upon either the Chi-square or the Kruskal-Wallis tests. We 
estimated the cumulative incidence of pregnancy loss following conception using Kaplan-
Meier techniques, while accounting for right censoring (withdrawals), and the time required 
to become pregnant. For pregnancy cycles with missing fertility monitor data required for 
estimating the day of ovulation (n=59; 17%), we assumed ovulation to be 14 days prior to 
the first positive pregnancy test. This assumption is consistent with the secretory phase being

 less variable than the proliferative phase of the cycle (17). We defined time-to-pregnancy 
loss as the number of observed days between ovulation or the monitor’s peak fertility day 
(LH surge) and the date of the reported loss. The peak (LH) monitor day was assumed to be 
the day of conception, given the ovum’s short (≈24 hours) interval for fertilization.
A priori, we defined three sensitive windows for ascertainment of couples’ lifestyles and 
time-to-pregnancy loss: 1) preconception window, time from enrollment to estimated 
conception; 2) early pregnancy window, the day following conception (or peak LH) through 
7 post-conception weeks and 3) periconception window, inclusive of the two windows as an 
overall summary window. Thereafter, women converted to monthly reporting for the 
remainder of pregnancy through loss or delivery.
To ensure proper model specification, we thoroughly inspected spaghetti plots for each 
lifestyle by partner during each window and modeled lifestyles as daily averages over the 
observed time in each window. Since only women completed early pregnancy journals, we 
assumed male partners’ preconception lifestyle remained the same during early pregnancy. 
To maintain a couple based analytic framework, we included the male partner in the 
estimation of HRs for early pregnancy and periconception along with the prospectively 
measured female exposures.
We first modeled each lifestyle behavior separately during each of the sensitive windows 
then included potential confounders that were identified a priori based on a review of the 
literature: female age (18), couples ages modeled as the difference (years) given their known 
correlation and reports of male age being associated with loss (10), couples’ BMI 
(continuous) (19,20) sexual frequency (21), and prior history of loss conditional on gravidity 
(22). Using Cox’s proportional hazards model (23), we modeled time to loss (post-
conception days) to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after 
first assessing potential non-linear relationships using splines. Despite assessing non-linear 
relations for all behaviors and characteristics (e.g., age, alcohol, BMI) with pregnancy loss, 
we only observed threshold effects only for female age (≥35 years) and male and female 
caffeinated beverage consumption at ≈2 daily cups depending upon the sensitive window. 
We modeled these risk factors, accordingly. We estimated the average number of daily 
cigarettes smoked and alcoholic drinks consumed to fully utilize all daily information in 
keeping with pregnancy being cycle based. Also, averages were thought to be amenable to 
guidance rather than to simply model totals during the windows. Multivitamin usage was 
modeled in terms of adherence or the proportion of days during each sensitive window the 
female or male partner reported taking vitamins, ranging from 0 (no vitamins taken) to 1 
(vitamins taken daily). Intercourse frequency was modeled as the average number of acts 
during the pregnancy cycle. Separate models were run for each of the three time intervals in 
anticipation that couples may change their behaviors or lifestyles when becoming pregnant. 
We empirically assessed such lifestyle changes using paired T-tests.
 Results
Ninety-eight (28%) of the 344 couples who became pregnant during the study experienced a 
pregnancy loss. Among women becoming pregnant, the cumulative incidence of pregnancy

 loss following the estimated day of conception increased during early pregnancy then 
plateaued (≈72 days) with 1% of losses occurring in the first 10 days, and increasing to 15% 
by 30 days, and 28% by 126 days. All losses occurred before 22 weeks gestation. Notably, 
time-to-pregnancy as prospectively ascertained was not associated with pregnancy loss 
(Figure 1, panels a and b, respectively; p=0.97).
Few significant differences emerged regarding baseline characteristics and pregnancy loss 
status among couples achieving an observed pregnancy with the exception of maternal age 
≥35 years after accounting for the difference in couples’ ages given their correlated nature 
(r=0.70), and paternal education (≤high school versus higher) (Table 1). Certain lifestyles 
were significantly (p<0.05) associated with pregnancy loss across various sensitive windows 
(Figure 2). During the preconception window, male but not female partner’s caffeinated 
beverage consumption was positively (62% and 41%; p<0.001) associated with pregnancy 
loss, while female vitamin adherence was negatively associated (59% and 69%; p=0.02). 
During the early pregnancy and periconception windows, partners’ caffeine consumption 
was positively associated with pregnancy loss, while female partner’s vitamin adherence was 
negatively associated (p<0.001).
Several significant adjusted hazard ratios emerged for lifestyle in each sensitive window 
along with female age ≥35 years accounting for the couples’ ages (Table 2). Most notably, 
female caffeine consumption >2 daily caffeinated drinks remained significantly associated 
with pregnancy loss [preconception (aHR=1.74; 1.07-2.81), early pregnancy (aHR=3.05; 
1.75-5.34), and periconception (aHR=2.58; 1.56-4.27)]. Similarly, male partners’ caffeinated 
beverage consumption also was significantly associated with loss [preconception 
(aHR=1.73; 1.10-2.72), early pregnancy (aHR=1.88; 1.21-2.93), and periconception 
(aHR=1.75; 1.12-2.74)]. Female vitamin adherence was associated with a reduced risk of 
loss in every sensitive window [preconception (aHR=0.45; 0.25-0.80), early pregnancy 
(aHR=0.21; 0.10-0.43), and periconception (aHR= 0.22; 0.11-0.44)]. None of the other 
lifestyle characteristics were significantly associated with pregnancy loss in any of the final 
adjusted models.
 Discussion
In our couple-based prospective cohort that was enrolled prior to conception, the incidence 
of pregnancy loss among couples who achieved a recognized pregnancy during the study 
was 28%, which is comparable (25% to 31%) to earlier estimates from prior preconception 
cohort studies that utilized urinary hormonal profiles to define pregnancy loss (24-26). 
However, our incidence is notably higher than that reported for a prospective occupational 
cohort of couples recruited prior to conception who were followed for 6 months (17%; 
12%-22%) (27). Time-to-pregnancy was not associated with pregnancy loss in our study 
affirming recent data from a large pregnancy cohort study (28). Our incidence estimate 
relative to earlier cohorts does not support an increased incidence of pregnancy loss as 
suggested by survey data (8). Still, the relatively high incidence underscores the inefficiency 
of human reproduction (29).

 While female age has long been associated with pregnancy loss, we observed a threshold 
effect at ≥35 years even when accounting for the difference in the couples’ ages. The extent 
to which this finding reflects aged gametes or cumulative environmental exposures inclusive 
of lifestyle requires further investigation. Couples’ lifestyle behaviors were associated with 
pregnancy loss, most notably consumption of >2 daily caffeinated beverages. The relation 
between consumption of caffeinated beverages and pregnancy loss has received considerable 
research, with much of the available evidence relying upon retrospective ascertainment of 
caffeine consumption including after pregnancy loss that may induce reporting bias (30). 
Interpreting our findings within the context of available literature that utilized prospective 
cohort designs with preconception enrollment is challenging in light of few such studies. 
However, a recent preconception cohort study that recruited women trying for pregnancy via 
the internet reported a positive association between females’ caffeine consumption during 
early pregnancy but not prior to conception and pregnancy loss (31). However, there are 
noteworthy differences between the methods used in this study and ours that may impact 
findings, including a lower incidence of pregnancy loss in the internet based cohort study in 
comparison to ours (14% and 28%, respectively), reliance on last menstrual period for 
gestational dating versus capture of the peak LH day as an estimate of conception in our 
study, and reliance on a single measurement of recalled caffeine intake prior to and during 
pregnancy in the internet based study in comparison to our capture of daily consumption 
before and during early pregnancy. Pregnancy based cohorts also have reported affirming 
other studies focusing on caffeine consumption during early pregnancy (32,33), but 
contrasting with a negative finding in another preconception cohort study (34). Our 
observation that preconception caffeine consumption >2 daily beverages is also associated 
with pregnancy loss fails to support reverse causation as a possible explanation, where one 
assumes that women with healthy pregnancy may avoid caffeine consumption due to nausea/
vomiting or food aversions believed associated with a healthy pregnancy.
With regard to alcohol consumption whose prevalence was much higher than that for 
cigarette smoking in our cohort, earlier authors reported couples’ alcohol consumption (≥10 
weekly drinks) in the conception cycle to be associated with a higher risk of spontaneous 
abortion (35) as was consuming ≥4 weekly drinks in a cohort of pregnant women (36). We 
did not observe alcohol consumption to be associated with pregnancy loss after covariate 
adjustment, which may reflect differences in the sampling framework (e.g., recruitment of 
occupational and pregnant women versus population based sampling), differences in the 
baseline prevalence of alcohol consumption or its timing and frequency during sensitive 
windows, model specification that includes multivitamin usage, or residual confounding by 
other lifestyle factors such as smoking or caffeine consumption.
An important and previously unreported lifestyle behavior is the tremendous reduction in 
pregnancy loss associated with vitamin adherence irrespective of sensitive window. For 
example, a 55% reduction in pregnancy loss was found for women taking vitamins daily 
(100% adherence) in the preconception periods versus those who did not (0% adherence), 
increasing to a 79% reduction for adherence during early pregnancy. In an extended analysis, 
we assessed whether preconception multivitamin usage is independent of early pregnancy 
usage and vice versa with the important caveat that women’s behaviors were correlated over 
windows resulting in very inefficient estimators for effect decomposition and findings that

 may be susceptible to collider bias in the presence of unmeasured confounders. The 
unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for daily preconception multivitamin usage controlling 
for similar usage in the early pregnancy window reflected the importance of the 
preconception window (HR=0.58; 95% CI 0.34, 0.96 and HR=0.83; 95% CI 0.34, 2.04, 
respectively) (data not shown). Similarly when modeling early pregnancy vitamin adherence 
controlling for similar preconception usage, a reduced risk of loss was observed in the 
unadjusted and adjusted analyses (HR=0.25; 95% CI 0.13, 0.49 and 0.23; 95% CI 0.07, 
0.73), respectively. These data may support usage in both sensitive windows.
This strong protective effect for preconception multivitamin usage is somewhat consistent 
with findings from a preconception cohort of female Chinese textile workers, where women 
in the highest versus lowest quartile of vitamin B6 had a lower odds of pregnancy loss 
(aOR=0.5; CI 0.3-1.0) (37). Related support stems from previous studies that involved self-
reported vitamin or folate usage and pregnancy loss. Pregnant women were queried about 
the combined use of multi- and prenatal-vitamins, which were associated with a significantly 
reduced odds of loss and self-reported pregnancy loss corroborated by medical records (38). 
In a cohort of women with prospectively collected folate intake and self-reported pregnancy 
loss, women in the highest versus lowest quintile of folate intake had a 19% reduction in risk 
of loss (39). Collectively, these data are supportive of a beneficial association between 
vitamin usage and pregnancy loss.
Our study has many strengths including its unique population-based couple design that 
captured both partners’ lifestyles in advance of and during early pregnancy or time intervals 
that are typically missed when relying on pregnancy cohorts. Our use of fertility monitors 
enabled us to accurately estimate conception using ovulation as its proxy, and use of digital 
pregnancy tests with demonstrated validity and user accuracy (16). We also were able to 
quantify small but highly significant (P ≤0.001) reductions in women’s daily mean number 
of cigarettes smoked (−0.15) or alcoholic (−0.34) and caffeinated (−0.51) beverages 
consumed between the preconception and early pregnancy sensitive windows, underscoring 
the need for continual guidance aimed at promoting healthy behaviors.
Still, important limitations need to be considered when interpreting the findings. We chose 
to assess pregnancy loss without further categorization relative to gestational age in light of 
no established standard endocrine criteria for defining loss (40). We recognize that we may 
have missed some losses if hCG concentrations were below analytical sensitivity limits or 
given the molecular heterogeneity of hCG and its variants. For instance, despite our 
standardized protocol for testing for pregnancy, it is possible that some women tested too 
late and thereby missed an hCG rise and fall. We also did not have information on the 
specific types of beverages consumed or specific vitamins taken that would be helpful to 
delve into potential biologic mechanisms underlying the association between multivitamin 
behavior and pregnancy loss, nor did we have information on decaffeinated or caffeine free 
beverages or other aspects of lifestyle such as physical activity, diet, recreational drugs or 
sleep habits. As such, we cannot rule out the potential for residual confounding.

  Conclusions
In summary, our data suggest that couples’ lifestyles are associated with the risk of 
pregnancy loss, including during the preconception period, emphasizing the need for 
continued efforts to promote healthy lifestyles before pregnancy begins, viz., preconception 
guidance. Our findings underscore the feasibility and utility of prospective cohort designs 
with preconception recruitment of couples for assessing exposures associated with 
reproductive and developmental toxicants in support of an earlier conclusion (41). Also, 
couples might continue to be advised that advanced age increases the risk of pregnancy loss 
and to limit caffeinated intake to fewer than 3 daily beverages irrespective of source, and that 
women should continue to take daily multivitamins before and during pregnancy consistent 
with clinical guidance. Our findings are not intended to suggest substituting decaffeinated or 
caffeine free beverages as a safer alternative, as we did not query couples on these products. 
Collectively, our findings are supportive of the need for ongoing efforts to ensure couples 
receive preconception guidance, and our findings await corroboration from other 
preconception couple based cohorts to ensure preconception guidance issued for the U.S. 
population (http://www.cdc.gov/preconception) are responsive to discoveries to the extent 
possible.
In conclusion, our findings are highly relevant for contemporary cohorts of couples at risk 
for or planning pregnancy who might want to adopt or maintain lifestyles that minimize the 
risk of pregnancy loss. All such lifestyles are amenable to change, and such guidance has 
been shown to influence healthy behaviors (42).
